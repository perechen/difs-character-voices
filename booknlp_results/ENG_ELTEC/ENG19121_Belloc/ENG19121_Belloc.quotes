441	444	446	447	Anna Wolsky	72	" Well ? "
464	503	504	505	Sylvia Bailey	67	" Have you yet decided , my dear , what we shall do this afternoon ? There are a dozen things open to us , and I am absolutely at your service to do any one of them ! "
511	516	517	517	she	67	" I feel lazy , "
520	560	517	517	she	67	" I 've been at the Bon Marché ever since nine o'clock , and I feel more like having a rest than going out again , though it does seem a shame to stay in a day like this ! "
625	628	629	629	she	197	" Tiens ! "
633	640	642	642	she	197	" what have you got there ? "
653	657	658	658	she	197	" Madame Cagliostra ? "
663	758	658	658	she	197	" Now where did I hear that name ? Yes , of course it was from our chambermaid ! Cagliostra is a friend of hers , and , according to her , a marvellous person — one from whom the devil keeps no secrets ! She charges only five francs for a consultation , and it appears that all sorts of well - known people go to her , even those whom the Parisians call the Gratin , that is , the Upper Crust , from the Champs Elysées and the Faubourg St. Germain ! "
759	770	772	772	Sylvia	67	" I do n't think much of fortune - tellers , "
776	800	772	772	Sylvia	67	" I went to one last time I was in London and he really did n't tell me anything of the slightest interest . "
813	815	808	808	she	67	" Pharaoh "
895	904	906	907	Madame Wolsky	73	" I do believe in fortune - tellers , "
910	975	906	907	Madame Wolsky	73	" and that being so I shall spend my afternoon in going up to Montmartre , to the Rue Jolie , to hear what this Cagliostra has to say . It will be what you in England call ' a lark ' ! And I do not see why I should not give myself so cheap a lark as a five - franc lark ! "
976	993	995	995	Sylvia	67	" Oh , if you really mean to go , I think I will go too ! "
1165	1168	1153	1162	Several quiet Frenchmen , who had offices in the neighbourhood	214	" en pension "
1772	1811	1767	1768	Madame Wolsky	73	" If I were you , Sylvia , I would certainly leave your pearls in the office this afternoon . Where is the use of wearing them on such an expedition as that to a fortune - teller ? "
1812	1821	1823	1823	Sylvia	67	" But why should n't I wear them ? "
1828	1869	1870	1871	Sylvia Bailey	67	" Well , in your place I should certainly leave anything as valuable as your pearls in safe keeping . After all , we know nothing of this Madame Cagliostra , and Montmartre is what Parisians call an eccentric quarter . "

2954	2965	2967	2968	Sylvia Bailey	67	" Surely a fortune - teller ca n't live here ? "
2980	2982	3019	3019	she	72	" Pharaoh "
2990	3001	3009	3009	she	72	" Oh , yes , this is evidently the place ! "
3085	3092	3094	3094	Sylvia	67	" She must have gone out , "
3142	3147	3128	3129	a woman	309	" Qui est là ? "
3204	3213	3215	3215	Sylvia	67	" We have come to see Madame Cagliostra , "
3235	3243	3218	3218	She	67	" Madame Cagliostra , at your service ! "
3300	3304	3295	3296	the French	321	" shut in , "
3358	3367	3369	3372	the fat little woman	323	" My ancestor , Count Cagliostro , ladies ! "
3375	3409	3410	3410	She	311	" As you will soon see , if you have , as I venture to suppose , come to consult me , I have inherited the great gifts which made Count Cagliostro famous . "
3415	3439	3410	3410	She	311	" What is it you desire of me ? Do you wish for the Grand Jeu ? Or do you prefer the Crystal ? "
3467	3475	3476	3476	she	68	" No doubt you have been told , "
3480	3522	3476	3476	she	68	" that my fee is five francs . But if you require the Grand Jeu it will be ten francs . Come , ladies , make up your minds ; I will give you both the Grand Jeu for fifteen francs ! "
3690	3694	3695	3695	she	72	" Very well , "
3704	3721	3695	3695	she	72	" Very well ! We will both take the Grand Jeu at fifteen francs the two . "
3729	3734	3735	3735	she	72	" It will be , "
3744	3753	3735	3735	she	72	" my ' treat , ' dear friend . "
3782	3847	3777	3777	she	67	" Yes , yes ! It shall be so . I insist ! I see you do not believe in our hostess 's gift . There are , however , one or two questions I must ask , and to which I fancy she can give me an answer . I am anxious , too , to hear what she will say about you . "
3930	3942	3943	3943	she	71	" We might at least ask her to open the window , "
4009	4014	4015	4015	she	316	" No , no ! "
4018	4056	4015	4015	she	316	" It would dissipate the influences . I can not do that ! On the contrary , the curtains should be drawn close , and if the ladies will permit of it I will light my lamp . "
4121	4124	4142	4143	the soothsayer	341	" Suspension , "
4162	4170	4172	4173	Anna Wolsky	72	" You will take my friend first , "
4189	4242	4183	4183	she	316	" Would you rather I went away , dear ? I could wait on the staircase till you were ready for me to come back . It is not very pleasant to have one 's fortune told when one is as young and as pretty as you are , before other people . "
4243	4254	4256	4257	Sylvia Bailey	67	" Of course I do n't mind your being here ! "
4280	4305	4306	4307	Madame Cagliostra	68	" The truth is that I should feel rather frightened if you were to leave me here all by myself . So please stay . "
4485	4509	4482	4482	she	68	" Madame has led a very placid , quiet life . Her existence has been a boat that has always lain in harbour — "
4515	4531	4532	4532	she	68	" I spent my childhood at Dieppe , and that often suggests images to me , "
4549	4644	4538	4538	she	68	" To return to Madame and her fate ! The boat has always been in harbour , but now it is about to put out to sea . It will meet there another craft . This other craft is , to Madame , a foreign craft , and I grieve to say it , rather battered . But its timbers are sound , and that is well , for it looks to me as if the sails of Madame 's boat would mingle , at any rate for a time with this battered craft . "
4645	4654	4656	4656	Sylvia	67	" I do n't understand what she means , "
4662	4671	4656	4656	Sylvia	67	" Do ask her to explain , Anna ! "
4672	4681	4683	4685	the older woman	349	" My friend asks you to drop metaphor , "
4704	4707	4708	4708	she	341	" Well , "
4712	4771	4708	4708	she	341	" I see you falling in love , and I also see that falling in love is quite a new experience . It burns , it scorches you , does love , Madame . And for awhile you do not know what it means , for love has never yet touched you with his red - hot finger . "
4772	4776	4780	4780	herself	67	" How absurd ! "
4782	4805	4780	4780	herself	67	" She actually takes me for a young girl ! What ridiculous mistakes fortune - tellers do make , to be sure ! "
4806	4815	4818	4819	Madame Cagliostra	68	" — But you can not escape love , "
4823	4857	4818	4819	Madame Cagliostra	68	" Your fate is a fair man , which is strange considering that you also are a fair woman ; and I see that there is already a dark man in your life . "
4879	4891	4861	4862	Bill Chester	79	" But this fair man knows all the arts of love . "
4907	4950	4896	4896	her	68	" He will love you tenderly as well as passionately . And as for you , Madame — but no , for me to tell you what you will feel and what you will do would not be delicate on my part ! "
4975	4981	4984	4985	Madame Cagliostra	68	" You are a foreigner , "
5003	5011	5013	5016	the fortune - teller	316	" But though you are a foreigner , "
5021	5094	5013	5016	the fortune - teller	316	" it is quite possible that you will never go back to your own country ! Stop — or , perhaps , I shall say too much ! Still if you ever do go back , it will be as a stranger . That I say with certainty . And I add that I hope with all my heart that you will live to go back to your own country , Madame ! "
5150	5184	5185	5185	She	68	" There is something here I do not understand ; something which I miss when I look at you as I am now looking at you . It is something you always wear — "
5203	5228	5229	5229	Sylvia	67	" I see them and yet they are not there ! They appear like little balls of light . Surely it is a necklace ? "
5250	5260	5262	5263	the woman	311	" These balls of light are also your Fate ! "
5266	5293	5262	5263	the woman	311	" If you had them here — I care not what they be — I should entreat you to give them to me to throw away . "
5300	5310	5311	5311	she	73	" I do n't think you would do that , "
5326	5334	5335	5335	she	73	" Have you heard of a mascot ? "
5339	5351	5335	5335	she	73	" Of a mascot which brings good fortune to its wearer ? "
5365	5397	5354	5354	her	67	" Well , if so , you have , of course , heard of objects which bring misfortune to their wearers — which are , so to speak , unlucky mascots ? "
5472	5476	5478	5479	Madame Cagliostra	68	" Your friend , "
5491	5567	5483	5483	herself	68	" should dispossess herself as quickly as possible of her necklace , of these round balls . They have already brought her ill - fortune in the past , they have lowered her in the estimation of an estimable person — in fact , if she is not very careful , indeed , even if she be very careful — it looks to me , Madame , as if they would end by strangling her ! "
5573	5581	5582	5582	she	67	" Of course she means my pearls , "
5585	5598	5582	5582	she	67	" But how absurd to say they could ever do me harm . "
5599	5603	5605	5606	Anna Wolsky	72	" Look here , "
5609	5668	5605	5606	Anna Wolsky	72	" you are quite right , Madame ; my friend has a necklace which has already played a certain part in her life . But is it not just because of this fact that you feel the influence of this necklace so strongly ? I entreat you to speak frankly . You are really distressing me very much ! "
5678	5686	5687	5687	she	68	" Well , perhaps it is so , "
5692	5774	5775	5775	She	68	" Of course , we are sometimes wrong in our premonitions . And I confess that I feel puzzled — exceedingly puzzled — to - day . I do not know that I have ever had so strange a case as that of this English lady before me ! I see so many roads stretching before her — I also see her going along more than one road . As a rule , one does not see this in the cards . "
5791	5797	5798	5798	she	68	" And yet after all , "
5802	5872	5798	5798	she	68	" I may be wrong ! Perhaps the necklace has less to do with it than I thought ! I do not know whether the necklace would make any real difference ! If she takes one of the roads open to her , then I see no danger at all attaching to the preservation of this necklace . But the other road leads straight to the House of Peril . "
5873	5879	5881	5882	Sylvia Bailey	67	" The House of Peril ? "
5884	5922	5881	5882	Sylvia Bailey	67	" Yes , Madame . Do you not know that all men and women have their House of Peril — the house whose threshold they should never cross — behind whose door lies misery , sometimes dishonour ? "
5923	5926	5928	5929	Anna Wolsky	72	" Yes , "
5931	5955	5956	5956	She	72	" that is true , quite true ! There has been , alas ! more than one House of Peril in my life . "
5959	5973	5956	5956	She	72	" But what kind of place is my friend 's House of Peril ? "
5974	5982	5984	5987	the fortune - teller	316	" It is not a large house , "
5999	6033	5984	5987	the fortune - teller	316	" It is a gay , delightful little place , ladies — quite my idea of a pretty dwelling . But it is filled with horror unutterable to Madame . Ah ! I entreat you"—she
6037	6055	5956	5956	She	72	Sylvia—"to beware of unknown buildings , especially if you persist in keeping and in wearing your necklace . "
6056	6094	6095	6096	Anna Wolsky	72	" Do tell us , Madame , something more about my friend 's necklace . Is it , for instance , of great value , and is it its value that makes it a source of danger ? "
6191	6199	6200	6200	she	68	" I can not tell you that , "
6203	6344	6200	6200	she	68	" I can not even tell you of what the necklace is composed . It may be of gold , of silver , of diamonds , of pearls — it may be , I 'm inclined to think it is , composed of Egyptian scarabei . They , as you know , often bring terrible ill - fortune in their train , especially when they have been taken from the bodies of mummies . But the necklace has already caused this lady to quarrel with a very good and sure friend of hers — of that I am sure . And , as I tell you , I see in the future that this necklace may cause her very serious trouble — indeed , I see it wound like a serpent round her neck , pressing ever tighter and tighter — "
6352	6356	6357	6357	she	68	" And now , "
6365	6374	6376	6376	she	68	" I will deal with you , Madame , "
6771	6795	6768	6768	she	68	" I regret , Madame , that I can tell you nothing — nothing at all ! I feel ill — very ill ! "
6830	6873	6874	6874	Her	68	" I know I 've disappointed you , Mesdames , but I hope this will not prevent your telling your friends of my powers . Allow me to assure you that it is not often that I am taken in this way ! "
6908	6916	6917	6917	she	68	" I will only charge five francs , "
6922	6933	6917	6917	she	68	" for I know that I have not satisfied you . "
6951	6960	6961	6961	she	68	" No wonder the poor woman feels faint , "
6965	6995	6961	6961	she	68	" It 's absurd to sit with a window tight shut in this kind of room , which is little more than a box with three people in it ! "
7006	7017	7018	7018	she	68	" I must beg you to go away , Mesdames , "
7023	7033	7018	7018	she	68	" Five francs is all I ask of you . "
7061	7077	7078	7078	she	72	" You saw something in the cards which you do not wish to tell me ? "
7082	7098	7078	7078	she	72	" I do not mind being told the truth . I am not a child . "
7099	7106	7108	7109	the Frenchwoman	343	" I swear I saw nothing ! "
7112	7129	7108	7109	the Frenchwoman	343	" I am too ill to see anything . The cards were to me perfectly blank ! "
7153	7163	7164	7164	she	72	" Mesdames , I beg you to excuse me , "
7168	7188	7164	7164	she	72	" If you do not wish to give me the five francs , I will not exact any fee . "
7236	7239	7261	7262	one another	191	" Mesdames ! "
7247	7257	7258	7258	They	378	" Mesdames , I implore you to come back ! "
7283	7286	7287	7287	she	72	" Well , "
7292	7306	7287	7287	she	72	" I knew you had something to tell me . What is it ? "
7307	7310	7312	7313	Madame Cagliostra	68	" No , "
7316	7340	7312	7313	Madame Cagliostra	68	" I must have the other lady here , too . You must both be present to hear what I have to say . "
7350	7363	7341	7341	Anna	72	" Come up Sylvia ! She wants to see us both together . "
7403	7409	7411	7412	the soothsayer	341	" Stand side by side , "
7432	7510	7425	7425	she	341	" I dare not let you go away without giving you a warning . Your two fates are closely intertwined . Do not leave Paris for awhile , especially do not leave Paris together . I see you both running into terrible danger ! If you do go away — and I greatly fear that you will do so — then I advise you , together and separately , to return to Paris as soon as possible . "
7511	7520	7522	7523	Anna Wolsky	72	" One question I must ask of you , "
7526	7541	7425	7425	she	341	" How goes my luck ? You know what I mean ? I play ! "
7542	7552	7554	7557	the fortune - teller	316	" It is not your luck that is threatened , "
7561	7612	7554	7557	the fortune - teller	316	" on the contrary , I see wonderful luck ; packets of bank - notes and rouleaux of gold ! It is not your luck — it is something far , far more important that is in peril . Something which means far more to you even than your luck ! "
7620	7628	7629	7629	she	386	" I wonder what that can be ? "
7632	7638	7629	7629	she	386	" It is your life ! "
7639	7643	7645	7645	Anna	72	" My life ? "
7647	7665	7645	7645	Anna	72	" I do not know that I value my life as much as you think I do . "
7666	7688	7629	7629	she	386	" The English have a proverb , Madame , which says : ' A short life and a merry one . ' "
7689	7708	7629	7629	she	386	" Can you predict that I shall have , if a short life , then a merry one ? "
7709	7712	7714	7715	Madame Cagliostra	68	" Yes , "
7717	7724	7714	7715	Madame Cagliostra	68	" that I can promise you . "
7735	7759	7731	7731	her	386	" And more , I can predict — if you will only follow my advice , if you do not leave Paris for , say"—she
7769	7802	7803	7803	she	386	calculation—"twelve weeks , I can predict you , if not so happy a life , then a long life and a fairly merry one . Will you take my advice , Madame ? "
7810	7857	7803	7803	she	386	" Believe me , I do not often offer advice to my clients . It is not my business to do so . But I should have been a wicked woman had I not done so this time . That is why I called you back . "
7858	7877	7879	7879	Anna	72	" Is it because of something you have seen in the cards that you tender us this advice ? "
7890	7895	7896	7896	she	386	" No , no ! "
7900	7935	7896	7896	she	386	" I repeat that the cards told me nothing . The cards were a blank . I could see nothing in them . But , of course , we do not only tell fortunes by cards"—she
7943	7953	7954	7954	She	386	" There is such a thing as a premonition . "
7971	7988	7954	7954	She	386	" And now I leave the question of the fee to the generosity of these ladies ! "
8032	8293	8026	8026	Anna	72	" Now , is n't that a typical Frenchwoman ? She really did feel ill , she really saw nothing in my cards , and , being an honest woman , she did not feel that she could ask us to pay ! Then , when we had gone away , leaving only five francs , her thrift got the better of her honesty ; she felt she had thrown away ten good francs ! She therefore called us back , and gave us what she took to be very excellent advice . You see , I had told her that I am a gambler . She knows , as we all know , that to play for money is a foolish thing to do . She is aware that in Paris it is not very easy for a stranger to obtain admittance — especially if that stranger be a respectable woman — to a gambling club . She therefore said to herself , ' I will give this lady far more than ten francs ' worth of advice . I will tell her not to go away ! As long as she remains in Paris she can not lose her money . If she goes to Dieppe , Trouville , any place where there is a Casino , she will lose her money . Therefore I am giving her invaluable advice — worth far more than the ten francs which she ought to be made to give me , and which she shall be made to give me ! ' "
8294	8301	8303	8303	Sylvia	67	" I suppose you are right , "
8306	8342	8303	8303	Sylvia	67	" And yet — and yet — she certainly spoke very seriously , did she not , Anna ? She seemed quite honestly — in fact , terribly afraid that we should go away together . "
8343	8355	8357	8358	Madame Wolsky	73	" But there is no idea of our going away together , "
8363	8462	8357	8358	Madame Wolsky	73	" I only wish there were ! You are going on to Switzerland to join your friends , and as for me , in spite of Madame Cagliostra 's mysterious predictions , I shall , of course , go to some place — I think it will be Dieppe ( I like the Dieppe Casino the best)—where I can play . And the memory of you , my dear little English friend , will be my mascot . You heard her say that I should be fortunate — that I should have an extraordinary run of good fortune ? "
8463	8466	8468	8468	Sylvia	67	" Yes , "
8470	8474	8468	8468	Sylvia	67	" but do not forget"—she
8510	8530	8544	8546	the other hastily	392	husband—"do not forget , Anna , that she told you you would not live long if you went away . "
8531	8542	8544	8546	the other hastily	392	" She was quite safe in saying that to me , "
8548	8616	8544	8546	the other hastily	392	" People who play — those who get the gambling fever into their system when they are still young — do not , as a rule , live very long . Their emotions are too strong , too often excited ! Play should be reserved for the old — the old get so quickly deadened , they do not go through the terrible moments younger people do ! "
8738	8748	8723	8723	She	390	l'Opéra—"Beflower yourselves , gentlemen and ladies , beflower yourselves ! "
9186	9197	9198	9198	she	73	" I have to go out of town this morning , "
9201	9221	9198	9198	she	73	" but the place I am going to is quite near , and I shall be back this afternoon . "
9222	9228	9230	9230	Sylvia	67	" Where are you going ? "
9234	9241	9230	9230	Sylvia	67	" Or is it a secret ? "
9242	9251	9252	9252	Anna	72	" No , it is not a secret . "
9256	9281	9252	9252	Anna	72	" I am going to go to a place called Lacville . I do not suppose you have ever heard of Lacville , Sylvia ? "
9288	9293	9295	9295	Anna	72	" I thought not , "
9304	9309	9310	9310	she	72	" Good - bye ! "
9437	9447	9434	9434	She	72	" Guide - Book to Paris and its Environs , "
9464	9466	9434	9434	She	72	" Lacville "
9761	9767	9769	9769	Sylvia	67	" I want to know , "
9804	9829	9778	9781	the hotel - keeper	449	seen!—"I want to know , M. Girard , which is the best way to a place called Lacville ? Have you ever been there ? "
9830	9833	9835	9836	M. Girard	81	" Lacville ? "
9853	9935	9936	9936	Sylvia	67	" Yes , indeed , I have been there , Madame ! Not this season yet , but often last summer , and I shall be going there shortly again . I have a friend there — indeed , he is more than a friend , he is a relation of mine , who keeps the most select hotel at Lacville . It is called the Villa du Lac . Is Madame thinking of going to Lacville instead of to Switzerland ? "
9941	10013	9936	9936	Sylvia	67	" Oh , no ! But Madame Wolsky is there to - day , and I should have gone with her if I had been ready when she came down . It has turned so hot that I feel a few hours in the country would be pleasant , and I am quite likely to meet her , for I suppose Lacville is not a very large place , M. Girard ? "
10035	10038	10039	10039	he	449	" Lacville ? "
10042	10102	10039	10039	he	449	" well — Dame ! Lacville is Lacville ! It is not like anything Madame has ever seen . On that I would lay my life . First , there is a most beautiful lake — that is , perhaps , the principal attraction;—then the villas of Lacville — ah ! they are ravishingly lovely , and then there is also"—he
10108	10111	10020	10020	he	449	her—"a Casino . "
10112	10116	10118	10118	Sylvia	67	" A Casino ? "
10128	10207	10209	10210	M. Girard	81	" But to see the Casino properly Madame must go at night , and it would be well if Madame were accompanied by a gentleman . I do not think Madame should go by herself , but if Madame really desires to see Lacville properly my wife and I will make a great pleasure to ourselves to accompany her there one Sunday night . It is very gay , is Lacville on Sunday night — or , perhaps , "
10213	10234	10209	10210	M. Girard	81	" Madame , being English , would prefer a Saturday night ? Lacville is also very gay on Saturday nights . "
10235	10246	10248	10248	Sylvia	67	" But is there anything going on there at night ? "
10252	10261	10248	10248	Sylvia	67	" I thought Lacville was a country place . "
10262	10279	10281	10284	the hotel - keeper	449	" There are a hundred and twenty trains daily from the Gare du Nord to Lacville , "
10287	10331	10281	10284	the hotel - keeper	449	" A great many Parisians spend the evening there each day . They do not start till nine o'clock in the evening , and they are back , having spent a very pleasant , or sometimes an unpleasant , soirée , before midnight . "
10332	10339	10341	10341	Sylvia	67	" A hundred and twenty trains ! "
10345	10358	10341	10341	Sylvia	67	" But why do so many people want to go to Lacville ? "
10481	10493	10494	10494	he	449	" Many people go to Lacville in order to play baccarat , "
10510	10525	10526	10526	he	449	" But apart from the play , Lacville is a little paradise , Madame , "
10531	10571	10526	10526	he	449	" It is a beauteous spot , just like a scene in an opera . There is the romantic lake , edged with high , shady trees and princely villas — and then the gay , the delightful Casino ! "
10572	10580	10494	10494	he	449	" And is there a train soon ? "
10581	10677	10678	10679	M. Girard	81	" I will look Madame out a train this moment , and I will also give her one of my cousin Polperro 's cards . Madame has , of course , heard of the Empress Eugénie ? Well , the Villa du Lac once belonged to one of the Empress 's gentlemen - in - waiting . The very highest nobility stay at the Villa du Lac with my cousin . At this very moment he has Count Paul de Virieu , the brother - in - law of a duke , among his clients — "
10688	10726	10727	10727	he	81	" You see , Madame , my cousin was chef to the Emperor of Brazil 's sister — this has given him a connection among the nobility . In the winter he has an hotel at Mentone , "
10738	10747	10748	10748	he	81	" There is a train every ten minutes , "
10753	10824	10748	10748	he	81	" from the Gare du Nord . Or , if Madame prefers it , she could walk up from here to the Square of the Trinité and take the tramway ; but it is quicker and pleasanter to go by train — unless , indeed , Madame wishes to offer herself the luxury of an automobile . That , alas ! I fear would cost Madame twenty to thirty francs . "
10825	10834	10836	10836	Sylvia	67	" Of course I will go by train , "
10840	10854	10836	10836	Sylvia	67	" and I will lunch at your cousin 's hotel , M. Girard . "
11037	11043	11023	11023	Sylvia	67	" Lacville - les - Bains "
11166	11171	11173	11174	the lady	490	" I really think , "
11177	11207	11173	11174	the lady	490	" that we might have chosen some other place than Lacville in which to spend to - day ! There are many places the children would have enjoyed more . "
11208	11215	11217	11218	her husband	254	" But there is no place , "
11224	11236	11217	11218	her husband	254	" where I can spend an amusing hour in the afternoon . "
11237	11249	11255	11255	her	455	" Ah , my friend , I feared that was coming ! "
11258	11281	11255	11255	her	455	" But remember what happened the last time we were at Lacville — I mean the afternoon when you lost seventy francs ! "
11282	11290	11292	11293	the man	185	" But you forget that other afternoon ! "
11296	11324	11325	11325	Sylvia	67	" I mean the afternoon when I made a hundred francs , and bought you and the children a number of delightful little gifts with the money ! "
11393	11445	11447	11448	his mother	502	" No , no , my sweet cabbage , that will happen quite soon enough , when thou art older ! If thou art in the least like thy father , there will certainly come a time when thou also wilt go and lose well - earned money at the Tables , "
11451	11465	11467	11469	the sweet cabbage	503	" But if I win , then I shall buy thee a present , "
11577	11587	11589	11592	her fellow - traveller	514	" Is this Madame 's first visit to Lacville ? "
11602	11626	11627	11627	Sylvia	67	" If so , Madame would doubtless like to make her way to the lake . Would she care to accompany us thither ? "
11688	11697	11700	11701	some one	518	" It will be enchanting by the lake ! "
11893	11899	11901	11902	the Frenchman	535	" Is it not lovely ? "
11905	11939	11901	11902	the Frenchman	535	" And the water of the lake is so shallow , Madame , there is no fear of anyone being drowned in it ! That is such an advantage when one has children . "
11940	11953	11954	11955	his wife	455	" And it is a hundred times more charming in the afternoon , "
11961	11992	11993	11993	She	455	" for then the lake is so full of little sailing - boats that you can hardly see the water . Oh , it is gay then , very gay ! "
12007	12048	12049	12049	She	455	" I suppose Madame is going to one of the great restaurants ? As for us , we shall make our way into a wood and have our luncheon there . It is expensive going to a restaurant with children . "
12203	12213	12214	12214	She	67	" Hôtel Pension , Villa du Lac , Lacville . "
12230	12235	12236	12236	she	67	" Do you know , "
12239	12247	12236	12236	she	67	" where is the Villa du Lac ? "
12248	12253	12255	12257	the old man	557	" Certainly , Madame , "
12260	12283	12255	12257	the old man	557	" It is there , close to you , not a hundred yards away . That big white house to our left . "
12302	12340	12299	12299	he	557	" The Villa du Lac once belonged to the Marquis de Para , who was gentleman - in - waiting to the Empress Eugénie . He and his family lived on here long after the war , in fact"—he
12343	12428	12299	12299	he	557	voice—"till the Concession was granted to the Casino . You know what I mean ? The Gambling Concession . Since then the world of Lacville has become rather mixed , as I have reason to know , for my wife and I have lived here fifteen years . The Marquis de Para sold his charming villa . He was driven away , like so many other excellent people . So the Villa du Lac is now an hotel , where doubtless Madame has friends ? "
12564	12568	12569	12569	he	234	" Madame Bailey ? "
12578	12604	12569	12569	he	234	" Have I the honour of greeting Madame Bailey ? My cousin telephoned to me that you might be coming , Madame , to déjeuner ! "
12612	12628	12607	12607	Sylvia	67	" I am delighted , I am honoured , by the visit of Madame Bailey ! "
12827	12844	12846	12847	M. Polperro	93	" I have arranged for Madame a little table in what we call the lake window , "
12849	12862	12863	12863	he	93	" As yet Lacville is very empty . Paris is so delightful , "
12866	12882	12883	12883	he	93	" but very soon , when the heat comes , Lacville will be quite full , "
12887	12903	12904	12904	He	93	" I myself have a very choice clientèle — I do not deal with rubbish . "
12910	12979	12981	12981	he	93	" My clients come back to me year after year . Already I have six visitors , and in ten days my pension will be au grand complet . It is quality , not quantity , that I desire , Madame . If ever you know anyone who wishes to come to Lacville you may safely recommend them — I say it with my hands on my heart , "
12987	12993	12981	12981	he	93	words—"to the Villa du Lac . "
13165	13171	13161	13161	she	588	" hard - earned money . "
13595	13607	13608	13608	he	93	" Would M. le Comte prefer scrambled eggs or an omelette ? "
13613	13617	13619	13619	his	93	" M. le Comte "
13630	13638	13619	13619	his	93	" Scrambled eggs , my good Polperro . "
13694	13706	13707	13707	she	620	" Would Madame like to have her coffee in the garden ? "
13823	13846	13847	13847	he	93	" If Madame should ever care to make a little stay at Lacville , how happy Madame Polperro and I would be ! "
13850	13880	13847	13847	he	93	" I have a beautiful room overlooking the lake which I could give Madame . It was reserved for a Russian Princess , but now she is not coming — "
13881	13892	13894	13894	Sylvia	67	" Perhaps I will come and stay here some day , "
13915	13942	13897	13897	she	67	" But I am going to Switzerland next week , so it will have to be the next time I come to France in the summer . "
13943	13948	13950	13951	M. Polperro	93	" Does Madame play ? "
13955	13958	13960	13960	Sylvia	67	" I ? "
13964	13999	13960	13960	Sylvia	67	" No , indeed ! Of course , I play bridge — all English people play bridge — but I have never gambled , if you mean that , monsieur , in my life . "
14000	14010	14012	14013	M. Polperro	93	" I am delighted to hear Madame say so , "
14017	14109	14012	14013	M. Polperro	93	" People now talk of Lacville as if there was only the Casino and the play . They forget the beautiful walks , the lovely lake , and the many other attractions we have to offer ! Why , Madame , think of the Forest of Montmorency ? In old days it was quite a drive from Lacville , but now a taxi or an automobile will get you there in a few minutes ! Still the Casino is very attractive too ; and all my clients belong to the Club ! "
14503	14517	14518	14518	he	662	" Does Madame wish to go straight to the Room of the Games ? "
14809	14816	14817	14817	he	677	" Does Madame want a seat ? "
14821	14837	14817	14817	he	677	" If so , I can procure Madame a seat in a very few moments . "
14856	14867	14868	14868	she	67	" I only came in to look for a friend , "
14873	14881	14868	14868	she	67	" but my friend is not here . "
14925	14931	14910	14911	Madame Wolsky	73	" Then that is settled ? "
14941	14969	14971	14971	her	67	" You will fill up all the formalities , and by the time I arrive the card of membership will be ready for me ? This kind of thing"—she
14980	14994	15002	15002	her	67	left—"is no use to me at all ! I only like le Grand Jeu "
15029	15032	15025	15025	he	681	" Sylvia ! "
15033	15036	15037	15038	Mrs. Bailey	71	" Anna ! "
15052	15088	15090	15092	the Polish lady	228	" So you came after me ? Well ! Well ! I never should have thought to have seen my dear Puritan , Sylvia Bailey , in such a place as the Casino of Lacville ? "
15095	15117	15090	15092	the Polish lady	228	" However , as you are here , let us enjoy ourselves . Would you like to risk a few francs ? "
15138	15146	15147	15147	she	72	" This is a child 's game ! "
15152	15184	15147	15147	she	72	" I can not understand how all these clever Parisians can care to come out here and lose their money every Saturday and Sunday , to say nothing of other days ! "
15185	15196	15198	15198	Sylvia	67	" But I suppose some of these people make money ? "
15227	15274	15202	15202	she	67	" Oh yes , no doubt a few may make money at this game ! But I have just been arranging , with the aid of the owner of the Pension where I am going to stay when I come here , to join the Club . "
15289	15354	15285	15285	she	67	" You see , my dear child , there are two kinds of play here — as there are , indeed , at almost every Casino in France . There is this game , which is , as I say , a child 's game — a game at which you can make or lose a few francs ; and then there is Baccarat ! "
15360	15363	15365	15365	Sylvia	67	" Yes ? "
15368	15452	15365	15365	Sylvia	67	" Baccarat is played here in what they call the Club , in another part of the building . As there is an entrance fee to the Club , there is never such a crowd in the Baccarat Room as there is here . And those who belong to the Club ' mean business , ' as they say in your dear country . They come , that is , to play in the way that I understand and that I enjoy play ! "
15568	15575	15576	15576	he	691	" Everything is arranged , Madame ! "
15579	15615	15576	15576	he	691	" Here is your membership card . May I have the pleasure of taking you myself to the Club ? Your friend can come too . She does not want to play , does she ? "
15640	15649	15628	15628	He	691	" Madame , or is it Mademoiselle ? — "
15650	15653	15655	15655	Anna	72	" Madame ! "
15659	15685	15655	15655	Anna	72	" — Madame can certainly come in and look on for a few moments , even though she be not a member of the Club . "
15887	15896	15897	15897	he	691	" It is nearly half - past one ! "
15901	15919	15897	15897	he	691	" Surely , it is time that we began ! Who takes the Bank to - day ? "
15920	15924	15926	15929	the Comte de Virieu	99	" I will , "
15980	16007	15963	15963	she	67	" neither a recreation nor an intellectual exercise , but simply a means for the rapid exchange of money well suited to persons of impatient temperament . "
16414	16425	16426	16426	she	67	" Do you think I might put down ten francs ? "
16439	16447	16432	16433	the other	422	" Yes , of course you can ! "
16467	16472	16474	16474	Anna	72	" Leave it on , "
16476	16482	16474	16474	Anna	72	" and see what happens — "
16537	16546	16547	16547	he	714	" Has Madame got her card of membership ? "
16664	16674	16675	16675	he	619	" Of course , this young lady may play , "
16679	16702	16675	16675	he	619	" and as Banker I wish her all good luck ! This is probably her first and her last visit to Lacville . "
16723	16750	16751	16751	He	619	" Take her away , Madame , when she has won a little more ! Do not give her time to lose what she has won . "
16783	16790	16791	16791	she	67	" We thank you , Monsieur , "
16795	16807	16808	16808	He	619	" But I think we have been here quite long enough . "
16816	16834	16808	16808	He	619	" I will now take you a drive , Sylvia . We have had sufficient of this ! "
16854	16912	16842	16846	many were the curious glances	722	" It will amuse you to see something of Lacville . As that gentleman said , I do not suppose you will ever come here again . And , as I shall spend most of my time in the Casino , I can very well afford to spare a little while out of it to - day ! "
16964	16973	16975	16976	Madame Wolsky	73	" First you will go round the lake , "
16981	16998	16975	16976	Madame Wolsky	73	" and then you will take us to the Pension Malfait , in l'Avenue des Acacias . "
17133	17148	17150	17150	Anna	72	" This sort of thing will go on up till about nine this evening ! "
17155	17250	17251	17251	she	72	" Think , my dear — a hundred and twenty trains daily ! That room in the Casino where I first saw you will be crammed to suffocation within an hour , and even the Club will be well filled , though I fancy the regular habitués of the club are rather apt to avoid Saturday and Sunday at Lacville . I myself , when living here , shall try to do something else on those two days . By the way — how dreadful that I should forget!—have you had a proper déjeuner ? "
17272	17362	17363	17363	Anna	72	" The Villa du Lac ? I have heard of it , but surely it 's an extremely expensive hotel ? The place I 've chosen for myself is farther away from the Casino ; but the distance will force me to take a walk every day , and that will be a very good thing . Last time I was at Monte Carlo I had a lodging right up in Monaco , and I found that a very much healthier plan than to live close to the Casino , "
17368	17398	17363	17363	Anna	72	" The Pension Malfait is really extraordinarily cheap for a place near Paris . I am only going to pay fifty - five francs a week , tout compris ! "
17475	17486	17488	17488	Sylvia	67	" I suppose no one lives here in the winter ! "
17550	17566	17568	17568	Anna	72	" In the winter ? Why , in the winter Lacville is an absolute desert , "
17571	17629	17568	17568	Anna	72	" You see , the Casino only has a summer Concession ; it can not open till April 15 . Of course there are people who will tell you that Lacville is the plague - pit of Paris , but that 's all nonsense ! Lacville is neither better nor worse than other towns near the capital ! "
17655	17661	17568	17568	Anna	72	" Hôtel - Pension Malfait . "
17662	17671	17673	17673	Anna	72	" This is the place I have found ! "
17675	17694	17695	17695	Sylvia	67	" Would you care to come in and see the room I 've engaged from next Monday week ? "
17839	17846	17847	17847	he	103	" Madame has brought her friend ? "
17859	17920	17921	17921	He	103	" I hope that Madame 's friend will come and stay with us too ? I have a charming room which I could give this lady ; but later on we shall be very full — full all the summer ! The hot weather is a godsend for Lacville ; for it drives the Parisians out from their unhealthy city . "
17949	17962	17963	17963	he	103	" Madame Wolsky has brought this good lady to see our Pension ! "
17966	17978	17963	17963	he	103	" and perhaps she is also coming to stay with us — "
18073	18085	18087	18088	M. Malfait	103	" An English lady was staying here not very long ago , "
18090	18118	18087	18088	M. Malfait	103	" and she bought that table and left it to me as a little gift when she went away . That was very gracious on her part ! "
18195	18199	18201	18202	M. Malfait	103	" My clientèle , "
18205	18226	18227	18227	He	103	" is very select and chic . Those of my guests who frequent the Casino all belong to the Club ! "
18287	18290	18292	18292	Anna	72	" Well , "
18296	18342	18292	18292	Anna	72	" I suppose we had better leave now , but we might as well go on driving for about an hour , and then , when it is a little cooler , we will go back to Paris and be there in time for tea . "
18392	18398	18399	18399	he	726	" Even five years ago , "
18402	18489	18491	18492	the man	185	" much of this was forest , Mesdames ; but now — well , Dame!—you can understand people are eager to sell . There are rumours that the Concession may be withdrawn from the Casino — that would be terrible , some say it would kill Lacville ! It would be all the same to me , I should always find work elsewhere . But it makes everyone eager to sell — those , I mean , who have land at Lacville . There are others , "
18511	18574	18494	18494	he	726	pace—"who declare that it would be far better for the town — that there would be a more solid population established here — you understand , Mesdames , what I mean ? The Lacville tradesmen would be as pleased , quite as pleased , or so some of them say ; but , all the same , they are selling their land ! "
18855	18929	18930	18930	she	72	" After all , why should n't you come out to Lacville , Sylvia ? You ca n't go to Switzerland alone , and you certainly do n't want to go on staying in Paris as Paris is now ! I do not ask you to go to the Pension Malfait , but come to the Villa du Lac . You will soon make acquaintances in that sort of place — I mean , "
18933	18951	18930	18930	she	72	" in your hotel , not in the town . We could always spend the mornings together — "
18952	18967	18969	18969	Sylvia	67	" — And I , too , could join the Club at the Casino , "
18973	18987	18989	18989	Anna	72	" No , no , I do n't want you to do that ! "
19055	19063	19064	19064	she	67	" I do n't see why not ! "
19067	19084	19064	19064	she	67	" You yourself say that there is no harm in gambling if one can afford it . "
19335	19355	19356	19356	he	93	" This was the bed - chamber of Madame la Comtesse de Para , the friend of the Empress Eugénie "
19439	19451	19453	19454	M. Polperro	93	" Madame will find the Villa du Lac far more lively now "
19457	19487	19453	19454	M. Polperro	93	" Last week I had only M. le Comte Paul de Virieu — no doubt Madame has heard of his brother - in - law , the Duc d'Eglemont ? "
19491	19504	19505	19505	she	67	" Yes , he won the Derby , a famous English race , "
19522	19532	19533	19533	she	67	" And does the Count own horses , too ? "
19536	19574	19533	19533	she	67	" Oh , no , Madame . He loves them , yes , and he is a fine horseman , but Count Paul , alas ! has other things that interest and occupy him more than horses ! "
20330	20340	20341	20341	he	868	" I hope Madame is satisfied with her dinner , "
20345	20360	20341	20341	he	868	" Madame must always tell me if there is anything she does not like . "
20370	20381	20382	20382	he	868	" Félicie ! You must look very well after Madame , "
20386	20395	20397	20397	he	868	" Make her comfortable , attend to her slightest wish"—and
20398	20403	20404	20404	he	868	chuckled—"This is my niece , "
20407	20431	20404	20404	he	868	" a very good girl ! She is our adopted daughter . Madame will only have to ask her for anything she wants . "
20477	20483	20484	20484	she	67	" Thank you so much , "
20487	20512	20484	20484	she	67	" but I am more than comfortable ! And after dinner I shall go to the Casino to meet my friend , Madame Wolsky . "
20653	20671	20672	20672	Sylvia	67	" If , as I suppose , Madame , seeing that you have come back to Lacville — "
20701	20735	20736	20736	He	619	" — and you wish to join the Club at the Casino , I hope , Madame , that you will allow me to have the honour of proposing you as a member . "
20746	20771	20736	20736	He	619	" It is far better for a lady to be introduced by someone who is already a member , than for the affair to be managed"—he
20775	20801	20736	20736	He	619	voice—"by an hotel keeper . I am well known to the Casino authorities . I have been a member of the Club for some time — "
20812	20826	20828	20828	Sylvia	67	" But I am not yet sure that I shall join the Club , "
20841	20875	20876	20876	Sylvia	67	" I beg your pardon , Madame ! I misunderstood . I thought you told M. Polperro just now in the dining - room that you were going to the Casino this evening . "
20905	20915	20916	20916	she	67	" Yes , I am going to the Casino , "
20920	20964	20916	20916	she	67	" but only to meet a friend of mine there , the lady with whom I was the other day when you so kindly interfered to save us , or rather to save me , from being ignominiously turned out of the Club . "
20974	20981	20967	20967	she	67	" Wo n't you sit down ? "
20998	21053	20994	20994	he	99	" I fear you will not be allowed to go into the Club this time unless you become a member . They have to be very strict in these matters ; to allow a stranger in the Club at all is a legal infraction . The Casino authorities might be fined for doing so . "
21054	21061	21063	21063	Sylvia	67	" How well you speak English ! "
21069	21077	21078	21078	he	99	" I was at school in England , "
21083	21110	21078	21078	he	99	" at a Catholic College called Beaumont , near Windsor ; but now I do not go there as often as I should like to do . "
21167	21173	21174	21174	she	67	" Wo n't you smoke ? "
21177	21188	21174	21174	she	67	" Are you sure you do n't mind , Madame ? "
21189	21199	21201	21201	she	67	" No , of course I do n't mind ! "
21232	21240	21227	21227	her	67	" My father smoked all day long — "
21297	21305	21307	21308	the girl	896	" I have brought Madame a shawl , "
21312	21321	21307	21308	the girl	896	" for it 's getting a little cold , "
21367	21373	21374	21374	she	67	" I must go now , "
21381	21410	21374	21374	she	67	" I promised to meet my friend in the hall of the Casino at half - past eight . She must be there waiting for me , now . "
21411	21429	21431	21432	the Count	619	" If you will allow me to do so , I will escort you to the Casino , "
21530	21543	21544	21544	he	99	" I think I ought to introduce myself to you , Madame , "
21548	21556	21544	21544	he	99	" My name is Paul de Virieu . "
21557	21564	21565	21565	she	67	" And mine is Sylvia Bailey , "
21601	21677	21596	21597	the Count	619	" Will you pardon me , Madame , if I take the liberty of saying that you should arrange for your friend to call for you on those evenings that you intend to spend at the Casino ? It is not what English people call ' proper ' for you to go to the Casino alone , or only accompanied by a stranger — for I , alas ! am still a stranger to you . "
21725	21731	21732	21732	he	619	" You see , Madame , "
21737	21787	21732	21732	he	619	" you look very young — I mean , pardon me , you are very young , and I will confess to you that the first time I saw you I thought you were a ' Miss. ' Of course , I saw at once that you were English . "
21788	21802	21804	21804	Sylvia	67	" An English girl would hardly have come all by herself to Lacville ! "
21809	21822	21804	21804	Sylvia	67	" Oh , Madame , English young ladies do such strange things ! "
21864	21873	21876	21877	Count Paul	94	" Perhaps I do not make myself clear , "
21901	21943	21879	21879	He	94	" Not very long ago a lady had her hand - bag snatched from her within a few yards of the police - station , in the centre of the town . Everyone comes here to make or to lose money — "
21944	21956	21957	21957	she	913	" But most of the people look so quiet and respectable , "
21961	21983	21957	21957	she	913	" That is true , but there are the exceptions . Lacville contains more exceptions than do most places , Madame . "
22008	22025	22026	22026	Sylvia	67	" Anna ? Anna ? Here I am ! I 'm so sorry I 'm late ! "
22061	22073	22075	22077	the Polish lady	228	" I see you 've already made one acquaintance , Sylvia , "
22080	22106	22107	22107	Sylvia	67	" That 's the man who was so kind the last time we were here together . He is staying at the Villa du Lac , "
22114	22123	22107	22107	Sylvia	67	" His name is Count Paul de Virieu . "
22124	22141	22142	22142	Anna	72	" Yes , I am aware of that ; I know him by sight quite well , "
22146	22166	22168	22168	Sylvia	67	" And he has offered to propose me as a member of the Club if I wish to join , "
22170	22179	22181	22182	Anna Wolsky	72	" I shall propose you — of course ! "
22184	22231	22181	22182	Anna Wolsky	72	" But I do not think it is worth worrying about your membership to - night . We can spend the evening downstairs , in the public Salle des Jeux . I should not care to leave you alone there , even on a Monday evening . "
22232	22246	22248	22248	Sylvia	67	" You talk as if I were sugar or salt that would melt ! "
22254	22267	22269	22269	Anna	72	" One has to be very careful in a place like Lacville , "
22272	22296	22297	22297	She	72	" There are all sorts of queer people gathered together here on the look - out for an easy way of making money . "
22306	22339	22297	22297	She	72	" You are not only very pretty , my dear Sylvia , but you look what the people here probably regard as being of far more consequence , that is , opulent . "
22340	22345	22347	22347	Sylvia	67	" So I am , "
22350	22395	22347	22347	Sylvia	67	" opulent and very , very happy , dear Anna ! I am so glad that you brought me here , and first made me acquainted with this delightful place ! I am sure Switzerland would not have been half as amusing as Lacville — "
22597	22604	22605	22605	she	72	" It 's an odd thing , "
22612	22662	22605	22605	she	72	" but I do n't see here any of the people I 'm accustomed to see at Monte Carlo . As a rule , whenever one goes to this kind of place one meets people one has seen before . We gamblers are a caste — a sect part ! "
22663	22676	22678	22678	Sylvia	67	" I ca n't bear to hear you call yourself a gambler , "
22690	22720	22684	22684	Anna	72	" Believe me , my dear , there is not the difference you apparently think there is between a gambler and the man who has never touched a card . "
22740	22769	22736	22736	she	72	" Yes , I do know someone here after all ! That funny - looking couple over there were at Aix - les - Bains all last summer . "
22770	22777	22779	22779	Sylvia	67	" Which people do you mean ? "
22782	22842	22843	22844	Sylvia Bailey	67	" Do n't you see that long , thin man who is so queerly dressed — and his short , fat wife ? A dreadful thing happened to them — a great friend of theirs , a Russian , was drowned in Lac Bourget . It made a great deal of talk in Aix at the time it happened . "
23111	23126	23128	23128	Anna	72	" The man — their name is Wachner — only plays on a system , "
23130	23216	23128	23128	Anna	72	" He is in fact what I call a System Maniac . That is why he keeps noting down the turns in his little book . That sort of gambler ought never to leave Monte Carlo . It is only at Monte Carlo — that is to say , at Roulette — that such a man ever gets a real chance of winning anything . I should have expected them to belong to the Club , and not to trouble over this kind of play ! "
24050	24054	24049	24049	his	93	" M'sieur le Comte "
24058	24062	24049	24049	his	93	" M'sieur le Comte "
24199	24203	24195	24195	Sylvia	67	" Come in ! "
24223	24235	24236	24236	he	93	" I have come to ask if Madame has slept well , "
24239	24274	24236	24236	he	93	" and also to know if she would like an English breakfast ? If yes , it shall be laid in the dining - room , unless Madame would rather have it up here . "
24275	24285	24287	24287	Sylvia	67	" I would much rather come downstairs to breakfast , "
24289	24318	24287	24287	Sylvia	67	" but I do not want anything yet , M. Polperro . It will do quite well if I have breakfast at half - past eight or nine . "
24571	24584	24585	24585	he	99	" I hope my going out so early did not disturb you , "
24593	24601	24585	24585	he	99	" I saw you at your window . "
24609	24622	24623	24623	she	67	" I had already been awake for at least half an hour , "
24626	24647	24623	24623	she	67	" I suppose you ride ? Most of the Englishwomen I knew as a boy rode , and rode well . "
24648	24681	24682	24682	Sylvia	67	" My father was very anxious I should ride , and as a child I was well taught , but I have not had much opportunity of riding since I grew up . "
24712	24715	24703	24703	she	67	" No , "
24719	24721	24703	24703	she	67	" Yes "
25026	25034	25035	25035	he	99	" Have you yet visited the potager ? "
25047	25049	25043	25043	him	99	" Potager "
25059	25070	25043	25043	him	99	" I think you call it the kitchen - garden . "
25078	25117	25075	25075	his	99	" The people who built the Villa du Lac a matter of fifty years ago were very fond of gardening . I think it might amuse you to see the potager . Allow me to show it you . "
25163	25238	25143	25143	Sylvia	67	" Strange to say when I was a child I was often at the Villa du Lac , for the then owner was a distant cousin of my mother . He and his kind wife allowed me to come here for my convalescence after a rather serious illness when I was ten years old . My dear mother did not like me to be far from Paris , so I was sent to Lacville . "
25239	25250	25252	25252	Sylvia	67	" What a curious place to send a child to ! "
25254	25334	25252	25252	Sylvia	67	" Ah , but Lacville was extremely different from what it is now , Madame . True , there was the lake , where Parisians used to come out each Sunday afternoon to fish and boat in a humble way , and there were a few villas built round the lake . But you must remember that in those prehistoric days there was no Casino ! It is the Casino which has transformed Lacville into what we now see . "
25335	25345	25347	25347	Sylvia	67	" Then we have reason to bless the Casino ! "
25494	25500	25501	25501	Sylvia	67	" What a delightful place ! "
25504	25521	25501	25501	Sylvia	67	" But this garden must cost M. Polperro a great deal of money to keep up — "
25528	25611	25522	25525	The Comte de Virieu	1019	" Far from it ! Our clever host hires out his potager to a firm of market gardeners , part of the bargain being that they allow him to have as much fruit and vegetables as he requires throughout the year . Why , the potager of the Villa du Lac supplies the whole of Lacville with fruit and flowers ! When I was a child I thought this part of the garden paradise , and I spent here my happiest hours . "
25612	25635	25501	25501	Sylvia	67	" It must be very odd for you to come back and stay in the Villa now that it is an hotel . "
25636	25644	25645	25645	he	1020	" At first it seemed very strange , "
25649	25661	25645	25645	he	1020	" But now I have become quite used to the feeling . "
25677	25687	25688	25688	he	1020	" Would you care to go into the orangery ? "
25691	25723	25688	25688	he	1020	" There is not much to see there now , for all the orange - trees are out of doors . Still , it is a quaint , pretty old building . "
25877	25883	25885	25887	Paul de Virieu	99	" Let us sit down , "
25926	25938	25939	25939	he	1020	" Are you thinking of staying long at Lacville , Madame ? "
25943	25949	25950	25950	she	67	" I do n't know , "
25954	25982	25950	25950	she	67	" It will depend on my friend Madame Wolsky 's plans . If we both like it , I daresay we shall stay three or four weeks . "
26031	26035	26036	26036	he	535	" Mrs. Bailey ! "
26039	26049	26036	26036	he	535	" Will you permit me to be rather impertinent ? "
26085	26120	26121	26121	He	535	" I ask you , Madame , to leave Lacville ! I ask permission to tell you frankly and plainly that it is not a place to which you ought to have been brought . "
26146	26150	26151	26151	she	67	" But why ? "
26155	26164	26151	26151	she	67	" Why should I not stay at Lacville ? "
26165	26209	26210	26210	He	535	" Oh , well , there can be no harm in your staying on a few days if you are desirous of doing so . But Lacville is not a place where I should care for my own sister to come and stay . "
26216	26246	26210	26210	He	535	quicker—"Indeed , I will say more ! I will tell you that Lacville may seem a paradise to you , but that it is a paradise full of snakes . "
26247	26250	26252	26252	Sylvia	67	" Snakes ? "
26255	26265	26252	26252	Sylvia	67	" You mean , of course , human snakes ? "
26270	26320	26266	26266	He	535	" Every town where reigns the Goddess of play attracts reptiles , Madame , as the sun attracts lizards ! It is not the game that does so , or even the love of play in the Goddess 's victims ; no , it is the love of gold ! "
26330	26410	26411	26411	he	535	" Lacville as a gambling centre counts only next to Monte Carlo . But whereas many people go to Monte Carlo for health , and for various forms of amusement , people only come here in order to play , and to see others play . The Casino , which doubtless appears to you a bright , pretty place , has been the scene and the cause of many a tragedy . Do you know how Paris regards Lacville ? "
26415	26420	26421	26421	Sylvia	67	" No — yes , "
26424	26438	26421	26421	Sylvia	67	" You see I never heard of Lacville till about a week ago . "
26446	26462	26442	26442	her	67	" But I have heard that the Paris trades - people do n't like Lacville . "
26463	26471	26472	26473	the Count	619	" Let me tell you one thing , "
26479	26503	26472	26473	the Count	619	" Every tradesman in Paris , without a single exception , has signed a petition imploring the Government to suspend the Gambling Concession ! "
26504	26510	26512	26512	Sylvia	67	" What an extraordinary thing ! "
26520	26627	26628	26628	He	1032	" Pardon me , it is not at all extraordinary . A great deal of the money which would otherwise go into the pockets of these tradesmen goes now to enrich the anonymous shareholders of the Casino of Lacville ! Of course , Paris hotel - keepers are not in quite the same position as are the other Parisian trades - people . Lacville does not do them much harm , for the place is so near Paris that foreigners , if they go there at all , generally go out for the day . Only the most confirmed gambler cares actually to live at Lacville . "
26647	26693	26694	26695	The Count	619	" Yes , I know what you must be thinking , and it is , indeed , the shameful truth ! I , Madame , have the misfortune to be that most miserable and most God - forsaken of living beings , a confirmed gambler . "
26726	26738	26739	26739	he	1032	" I will tell you my story in a few words , "
26764	26890	26745	26745	he	1032	" I was destined for what I still regard as the most agreeable career in the world — that of diplomacy . You see how I speak English ? Well , Madame , I speak German and Spanish equally well . And then , most unhappily for me , my beloved mother died , and I inherited from her a few thousand pounds . I felt very miserable , and I happened to be at the moment idle . A friend persuaded me to go to Monte Carlo . That fortnight , Madame , changed my life — made me what the English call ' an idle good - for - nothing . ' Can you wonder that I warn you against staying at Lacville ? "
26928	26952	26953	26953	she	67	" It is very kind of you to tell me this , and I am very much obliged to you for your warning , "
26975	27060	26969	26969	he	1034	" The lady with whom you first came to Lacville — I mean the Polish lady — is well known to me by sight . For the last three years I have seen her at Monte Carlo in the winter , and at Spa and Aix - les - Bains in the summer . Of course I was not at all surprised to see her turn up here , but I confess , Madame , that I was very much astonished to see with her a"—he
27063	27093	26953	26953	she	67	moment—"a young English lady . You would , perhaps , be offended if I were to tell you exactly what I felt when I saw you at the Casino ! "
27094	27104	27106	27106	Sylvia	67	" I do not suppose I should be offended , "
27109	27145	27106	27106	Sylvia	67	" I felt , Madame , as if I saw a lily growing in a field of high , rank , evil - smelling — nay , perhaps I should say , poisonous — weeds . "
27146	27155	27157	27157	Sylvia	67	" But I can not go away now ! "
27173	27209	27210	27210	She	67	" It would be most unkind to my friend , Madame Wolsky . Surely , it is possible to stay at Lacville , and even to play a little , without anything very terrible happening ? "
27330	27356	27357	27357	he	99	" I am not so foolish as to pretend that the people who come and play in the Casino of Lacville are all confirmed gamblers , "
27362	27417	27357	27357	he	99	" We French take our pleasures lightly , Madame , and no doubt there is many an excellent Parisian bourgeois who comes here and makes or loses his few francs , and gets no harm from it . But , still , I swore to myself that I would warn you of the danger — "
27680	27688	27689	27689	she	67	" I want to thank you again , "
27693	27752	27689	27689	she	67	" for your kindness in giving me this warning . You know we in England have a proverb , ' Forewarned is forearmed . ' Well , believe me , I will not forget what you have said , and — and I am grateful for your confidence . Of course , I regard it as quite private . "
27771	27845	27766	27766	he	619	" I am afraid the truth about me is known to all those good enough to concern themselves with my affairs . I am sure , for instance , that your Polish friend is well aware of it ! You see before you a man who has lost every penny he owned in the world , who does not know how to work , and who is living on the charity of relations . "
27859	27869	27870	27870	he	619	" The horse you saw me ride this morning , "
27878	27966	27870	27870	he	619	" is not my horse ; it belongs to my brother - in - law . It is sent for me every day because my sister loves me , and she thinks my health will suffer if I do not take exercise . My brother - in - law did not give me the horse , though he is the most generous of human beings , for he feared that if he did I should sell it in order that I might have more money for play . "
27984	28035	27980	27981	the Count	619	" And now , au revoir , Madame , and forgive me for having thrust my private affairs on your notice ! It is not a thing I have been tempted ever to do before with one whom I have the honour of knowing as slightly as I know yourself . "
28562	28567	28568	28568	she	349	" We meet again ! "
28584	28602	28568	28568	she	349	" This is not very much like Aix - les - Bains , is it , Madame ? "
28608	28625	28626	28626	She	349	" Still it is a pretty place , Lacville , and cheaper than one would think . "
28639	28664	28626	28626	She	349	" As for us — my husband and I — we have taken a small villa ; he has grown so tired of hotels . "
28665	28675	28677	28677	Anna	72	" But surely you had a villa at Aix ? "
28684	28705	28706	28706	she	349	" Yes , we had a villa there , certainly . But then a very sad affair happened to us — "
28709	28717	28719	28719	she	349	" You may have heard of it ? "
28736	28744	28745	28745	she	349	" Yes , I heard all about it "
28749	28776	28745	28745	she	349	" You mean about your friend who was drowned in the lake ? It must have been a very distressing thing for you and your husband . "
28777	28791	28793	28793	Sylvia	67	" Yes , indeed ! He never can bear to speak of it . "
28834	28838	28851	28851	she	455	" Ami Fritz ! "
28855	28886	28851	28851	she	455	" Say , ' How d'you do , ' to this lady ! You will remember that we used to see ' er at Aix , in the Casino there ? "
28887	28890	28851	28851	she	455	" Ami Fritz "
28899	28902	28903	28904	his wife	455	" Yes , "
28910	28956	28958	28958	she	455	" that sad affair made Aix very unpleasant to us ! After that we spent the winter in various pensions , and then , instead of going back to Aix , we came ' ere . So far , I am quite satisfied with Lacville . "
28977	28987	28988	28988	she	455	" Lacville is a cosy , ' appy place ! "
29101	29105	29090	29096	this long , lanky man whose wife	1108	" Ami Fritz . "
29106	29119	29120	29120	she	455	" Now ' e is what the English call ' obby-'orse riding , "
29128	29148	29149	29149	she	455	" To see ' i m in all ' is glory you should see my Fritz at Monte Carlo ! "
29155	29205	29149	29149	she	455	" There ' as never been a system invented in connection with that devil - game , Roulette , that L'Ami Fritz does not know , and that ' e ' as not — at some time or other — played more to ' is satisfaction than to mine ! "
29214	29254	29207	29207	she	455	" ' E can not ring many changes on Baccarat , and I do not often allow ' i m to play downstairs . No , no , that is too dangerous ! That is for children and fools ! "
29296	29304	29306	29308	the older woman	349	" Let us leave them at it ! "
29312	29368	29306	29308	the older woman	349	" It will be much nicer in the garden , Madame , for it is not yet too ' ot for out of doors . By the way , I forgot to tell you my name . That was very rude of me ! My name is Wachner — Sophie Wachner , at your service . "
29369	29379	29408	29409	Madame Wachner	67	" And my name is Bailey — Sylvia Bailey . "
29380	29392	29306	29308	the older woman	349	" Ah , I thought so — you are a Mees ! "
29393	29396	29398	29398	Sylvia	67	" No , "
29401	29407	29398	29398	Sylvia	67	" I am a widow . "
29416	29419	29420	29420	she	67	" Ah , "
29425	29440	29420	29420	she	67	" that is sad — very sad for one so young and so beautiful ! "
29529	29541	29542	29542	she	67	" My ' usband , ' e was in business there , "
29546	29550	29551	29551	she	67	" And you ? "
29584	29595	29597	29597	Sylvia	67	" Oh , this is my first visit to France , "
29599	29609	29597	29597	Sylvia	67	" and I am enjoying it very much indeed . "
29610	29621	29623	29624	Madame Wachner	67	" Then you ' ave not gambled for money yet ? "
29626	29636	29637	29637	She	67	" In England they are too good to gamble ! "
29648	29668	29637	29637	She	67	" I never in my life played for money till last week , and then I won thirty francs ! "
29669	29681	29597	29597	Sylvia	67	" Ah ! Then now surely you will join the Club ? "
29682	29685	29687	29687	Sylvia	67	" Yes , "
29692	29712	29687	29687	Sylvia	67	" I suppose I shall join the Club . You see , my friend is so fond of play . "
29713	29719	29721	29722	the other	422	" I believe you there ! "
29726	29781	29721	29722	the other	422	" We used to watch Madame Wolsky at Aix — my ' usband and I. It seems so strange that there we never spoke to ' er , and that now we seem to know ' er already so much better than we did in all the weeks we were together at Aix ! But there"—she
29787	29807	29721	29722	the other	422	sigh—"we ' ad a friend — a dear young friend — with us at Aix - les - Bains . "
29808	29814	29816	29816	Sylvia	67	" Yes , I know , "
29820	29824	29816	29816	Sylvia	67	" You know ? "
29832	29842	29825	29826	Madame Wachner	67	" What is it that you know , Madame ? "
29843	29874	29721	29722	the other	422	" Madame Wolsky told me about it . Your friend was drowned , was he not ? It must have been very sad and dreadful for you and your husband . "
29875	29880	29882	29883	Madame Wachner	67	" It was terrible ! "
29886	29889	29882	29883	Madame Wachner	67	" Terrible ! "
29917	29921	29923	29924	Madame Wachner	67	" Look here ! "
29927	29969	29970	29970	she	67	" Why should not L'Ami Fritz escort Madame Wolsky to the Casino while you and I take a pretty drive ? I am so tired of that old Casino — and you will be so tired of it soon , too ! "
29984	30014	30016	30017	Madame Wolsky	73	" Yes , do take a drive , dear . You have plenty of time , for I intend to spend all this afternoon and evening at the Casino , "
30028	30055	30056	30056	she	72	" It will do quite well if you come there after you have had your tea . My friend will never go without her afternoon tea ; "
30062	30071	30073	30074	Madame Wachner	67	" I , too , love afternoon tea ! "
30081	30109	30073	30074	Madame Wachner	67	" Then that is settled ! You and I will take a drive , and then we will ' ave tea and then go to the Casino . "
30128	30146	30148	30149	Madame Wolsky	73	" You will enjoy a drive on this hot day , even with that funny old woman , "
30153	30202	30208	30208	her	73	" And meanwhile I will get your membership card made out for the Club . If you like to do so , you might have a little gamble this evening . But I do not want my sweet English friend to become as fond of play as I am myself"—there
30211	30225	30208	30208	her	73	" However , I do not think there is any fear of that ! "
30289	30314	30276	30277	the man	185	" There is nothing to be done here at all , Sophie ! It is foolish of us to waste our time like this ! "
30322	30347	30317	30318	Madame Wachner	67	" You are always so gloomy , so hopeless ! I tell you there is something to be done . Leave it to me ! "
30366	30434	30360	30362	the old woman	1128	" My ' usband , Madame , always says there is nothing to be done ! You see , ' e is tired of ' is last system , and ' e ' as not yet invented another . But , bah ! I say to ' i m that no doubt luck will come to - day . ' E may find Madame Wolsky a mascot . "
30443	30456	30457	30458	Madame Wachner	67	" I ' ave asked them to telephone for an open carriage , "
30468	30488	30457	30458	Madame Wachner	67	" It will be here in three or four minutes . Shall we drive you first to the Casino ? "
30497	30500	30502	30503	Monsieur Wachner	111	" No , "
30507	30518	30502	30503	Monsieur Wachner	111	" certainly not ! I will walk in any case . "
30519	30526	30528	30528	Anna	72	" And I will walk too , "
30536	30566	30528	30528	Anna	72	" There is no need at all for us to take you out of your way . You had better drive at once into the open country , Sylvia . "
30813	30830	30808	30809	Madame Wachner	67	" Ah , but soon you will marry again ; no doubt you are already engaged ? "
30831	30836	30837	30837	Sylvia	67	" Oh , no ! "
30842	30863	30839	30839	her	67	" But you are young and beautiful . It would be a crime for you not to get married again ! "
30871	30876	30877	30877	she	67	" I love beauty , "
30881	30977	30978	30978	she	67	" You did not see me , Madame , last week , but I saw you , and I said to my ' usband , ' There is a very beautiful person come to Lacville , Fritz ! ' ' E laughed at me . ' Now you will be satisfied — now you will ' ave something to look at , ' ' e says . And it is quite true ! When I come back that night I was very sorry to see you not there . But we will meet often now , "
30982	30996	30978	30978	she	67	" for I suppose , Madame , that you too intend to play ? "
31008	31015	31017	31017	Sylvia	67	" I shall play a little , "
31021	31037	31017	31017	Sylvia	67	" but of course I do not want to get into the habit of gambling . "
31038	31066	31067	31067	She	67	" No , indeed , that would be terrible ! And then there are not many who can afford to gamble and to lose their good money . "
31073	31078	31079	31079	she	67	" But , there , "
31087	31109	31082	31082	her	67	grave—"it is extraordinary ' ow some people manage to get money — I mean those ' oo are determined to play ! "
31163	31172	31173	31173	she	67	" I never talk of it before Fritz , "
31177	31241	31243	31243	her	67	" but , of course , we both often think of it still . Oh , it was a terrible thing ! We were devoted to this young Russian friend of ours . He and Fritz worked an excellent system together — the best Fritz ever invented — and for a little while they made money . But his terribly sad death broke our luck"—she
31247	31253	31255	31255	Sylvia	67	" How did it happen ? "
31272	31403	31260	31261	Madame Wachner	67	" They went together in a boat on Lake Bourget — it is a real lake , that lake , not like the little fishpond ' ere . A storm came on , and the boat upset . Fritz did his best to save the unfortunate one , but ' e could not swim . You can imagine my sensations ? I was in a summer-'ouse , trembling with fright . Thunder , lightning , rain , storm , all round ! Suddenly I see Fritz , pale as death , wet through , totter up the path from the lake . ' Where is Sasha ? ' I shriek out to ' i m. And ' e shake ' is ' ead despairingly — Sasha was in the lake ! "
31458	31468	31470	31470	Sylvia	67	" And was it long before they found him ? "
31476	31485	31487	31488	Madame Wachner	67	" They never did find ' i m , "
31497	31555	31490	31490	her	67	" That was the extraordinary thing — Sasha 's body was never found ! Many people thought the money ' e ' ad on ' is person weighed ' i m down , kept ' i m entangled in the weeds at the bottom of the lake . Did not your friend tell you it made talk ? "
31556	31559	31561	31561	Sylvia	67	" Yes , "
31563	31576	31578	31579	Madame Wachner	67	" ' E ' ad not much money on ' is person , "
31581	31619	31578	31579	Madame Wachner	67	" but still there was a good deal more than was found in ' is bed - room . That , of course , was ' anded over to the authorities . They insisted on keeping it . "
31620	31632	31634	31634	Sylvia	67	" But I suppose his family got it in the end ? "
31636	31703	31705	31705	her	67	" No . ' E ' ad no family . You see , our friend was a Russian nobleman , but he had also been a Nihilist , so ' e ' ad concealed ' is identity . It was fortunate for us that we ' ad got to know an important person in the police ; but for that we might ' ave ' ad much worry"—she
31708	31791	31792	31792	She	67	" They were so much annoyed that poor Sasha ' ad no passport . But , as I said to them — for Fritz quite lost ' is ' ead , and could say nothing — not ' alf , no , not a quarter of the strangers in Aix ' as passports , though , of course , it is a good and useful thing to ' ave one . I suppose , Madame , that you ' ave a passport ? "
31817	31821	31823	31824	Sylvia Bailey	67	" A passport ? "
31828	31847	31823	31824	Sylvia Bailey	67	" No , indeed ! I 've never even seen one . Why should I have a passport ? "
31848	31865	31867	31868	Madame Wachner	67	" When you are abroad it is always a good thing to ' ave a passport , "
31871	31924	31925	31925	she	67	" You see , it enables you to be identified . It gives your address at ' ome . But I do not think that you can get one now — no , it is a thing that one must get in one 's own country , or , at any rate , "
31929	31942	31927	31927	herself	67	" in a country where you ' ave resided a long time . "
31943	31951	31953	31953	Sylvia	67	" What is your country , Madame ? "
31955	31967	31968	31969	Madame Wachner	67	" Are you French ? I suppose Monsieur Wachner is German ? "
31974	32004	31971	31971	her	67	" Oh , ' e would be cross to ' ear that ! No , no , Fritz is Viennese — a gay Viennese ! As for me , I am"—she
32007	32033	32077	32078	Madame Wachner	67	moment—"well , Madame , I am what the French call ' une vraie cosmopolite'—oh , yes , I am a true citizeness of the world . "
32062	32075	32077	32078	Madame Wachner	67	" I ask you to come and ' ave tea with me , "
32083	32133	32077	32078	Madame Wachner	67	" We are not very far from the Châlet des Muguets , and I ' ave some excellent tea there . We will ' ave a rest , and tell the man to come back for us in one hour . What do you think of that , Madame ? "
32134	32142	32144	32144	Sylvia	67	" It is very kind of you , "
32201	32207	32210	32211	Madame Wachner	67	" Au Châlet des Muguets , "
32256	32270	32272	32273	Madame Wachner	67	" The good people of Lacville are in a hurry to make money , "
32277	32300	32272	32273	Madame Wachner	67	" I am told that land here has nearly trebled in value the last few years , though houses are still cheap . "
32301	32313	32315	32315	Sylvia	67	" It seems a pity they should destroy such beautiful woods , "
32336	32350	32351	32351	she	422	" I do not care for scenery — no , not at all ! "
32691	32703	32704	32704	she	67	" It is a pretty ' ouse , is it not ? "
32713	32728	32704	32704	she	67	" And only one thousand francs , furnished , for the ' ole season ! "
32751	32764	32766	32767	Madame Wachner	67	" We come in May , and we may stay till October , "
32776	32852	32766	32767	Madame Wachner	67	" I made a bargain with a woman from the town . She comes each morning , cooks what I want , and does the ' ousework . Often we ' ave our déjeuner out and dine at ' ome , or we dine close to the Casino — just as we choose . Food is so dear in France , it makes little difference whether we stay at ' ome or not for meals . "
32903	32907	32908	32908	she	67	" Walk in , "
32912	32923	32908	32908	she	67	" and welcome , Madame , to my ' ome ! "
32964	32972	32973	32973	she	67	" This is our dining - room , "
32977	32996	32973	32973	she	67	" Walk in , Madame . It is ' ere we had better ' ave tea , perhaps . "
33159	33165	33167	33168	Madame Wachner	67	" Is it not charming ? "
33170	33182	33185	33185	her	67	" And now I will show you our pretty little salon ! "
33319	33327	33329	33330	Madame Wachner	67	" And now I will get tea , "
33333	33342	33344	33344	Sylvia	67	" Will you not let me help you ? "
33348	33360	33344	33344	Sylvia	67	" I love making tea — every Englishwoman loves making tea . "
33380	33398	33400	33401	Madame Wachner	67	" Oh , but your pretty dress ! Would it not get ' urt in the kitchen ? "
33431	33438	33440	33440	Sylvia	67	" What a charming little cuisine ! "
33483	33494	33550	33550	she	67	" Your day servant must be an exceptionally clean woman . "
33495	33498	33500	33501	Madame Wachner	67	" Yes , "
33509	33547	33500	33501	Madame Wachner	67	" she is well enough . But , oh , those French people , how eager they are for money ! Do you suppose that woman ever stays one minute beyond her time ? No , indeed ! "
33645	33655	33656	33656	she	67	" Does the wood belong to you , too ? "
33665	33670	33671	33671	she	67	" Oh ! no , "
33674	33680	33671	33671	she	67	" that is for sale ! "
33681	33692	33694	33694	Sylvia	67	" You must find it very lonely here at night , "
33698	33714	33694	33694	Sylvia	67	" you do not seem to have any neighbours either to the right or left . "
33715	33727	33729	33730	Madame Wachner	67	" There is a villa a little way down the road , "
33733	33757	33729	33730	Madame Wachner	67	" But we are not nervous people — and then we ' ave nothing it would be worth anybody 's while to steal . "
33827	33870	33821	33823	the old woman	1128	" As to our money , I will show you where we keep it . Come into my bed - room ; perhaps you will take off your hat there ; then we shall be what English people call ' cosy . ' "
34022	34031	34032	34032	she	67	" This is the ' English comfortable , ' "
34051	34078	34032	34032	she	67	" My ' usband will never allow me to take a ' ouse that has no bath - room . ' E is very clean about ' imself"—she
34098	34113	34114	34114	she	67	" I suppose there are still many French houses without a bath - room , "
34117	34120	34122	34123	Madame Wachner	67	" Yes , "
34126	34133	34135	34135	her	67	" the French are not a clean people,"—she
34139	34150	34152	34152	Sylvia	67	" I suppose you keep your money in that box ? "
34162	34174	34152	34152	Sylvia	67	" No , indeed ! This is where I keep it ! "
34207	34215	34217	34218	Madame Wachner	67	" My money is all ' ere ! "
34223	34236	34217	34218	Madame Wachner	67	" It rests — oh , so cosily — against my petticoat . "
34263	34302	34255	34256	Madame Wachner	67	" La ! La ! it will be strong ! I only put a pinch for ourselves . And now go into the dining - room , and I will bring the teapot there to you , Madame ! "
34303	34308	34310	34310	Sylvia	67	" No , no , "
34313	34328	34310	34310	Sylvia	67	" why should we not drink our tea here , in this pretty kitchen ? "
34336	34340	34329	34330	The other	422	" Shall we ? "
34341	34347	34349	34349	Sylvia	67	" Yes , of course ! "
34399	34411	34413	34414	Madame Wachner	67	" I will go and see if the carriage is there , "
34558	34566	34568	34569	Madame Wachner	67	" Yes , the carriage is there , "
34573	34640	34568	34569	Madame Wachner	67	" And now we must be quick , or L'Ami Fritz will be cross ! Do you know that absurd man actually still thinks ' e is master , and yet we ' ave been married — oh , I do not know ' ow many years ! But he always loves seeing me even after we ' ave been separated but two hours or so ! "
34673	34681	34682	34682	she	67	" I really wonder you do that , "
34685	34701	34682	34682	she	67	" Just think how easy it would be for anyone to get into the house ! "
34702	34730	34732	34733	Madame Wachner	67	" Yes , that is true , but there is nothing to steal . As I tell you , we always carry our money about with us , "
34742	34758	34735	34735	She	67	" and I should advise you to do so too , my dear young friend . "
34790	34801	34802	34802	she	73	" I could n't think what had happened to you ! "
34809	34828	34802	34802	she	73	" But here is your membership card , Sylvia . Now you are free of the Baccarat tables ! "
34891	34896	34897	34897	she	67	" Here , Fritz , "
34902	34910	34897	34897	she	67	" You can now begin your play ! "
34920	34923	34897	34897	she	67	" Ami Fritz "
35034	35041	35042	35042	she	2555	" I have been quite lucky , "
35047	35129	35042	35042	she	2555	" I have made three hundred francs , and now I think I will rest a bit ! Slip in here , dear , and I will stand behind you . I do not advise you to risk more than twenty francs the first time ; on the other hand , if you feel en veine , if the luck seems persistent — it sometimes is when one first plays with gold — then be bold , and do not hesitate ! "
35257	35276	35228	35228	he	99	" Faites vos jeux , Messieurs , Mesdames ! Le jeu est fait ! Rien ne va plus ! "
35301	35312	35314	35314	Anna	72	" Leave your money on , and see what happens , "
35316	35326	35314	35314	Anna	72	" After all you are only risking twenty francs ! "
35401	35416	35418	35418	Anna	72	" You had better take up your winnings , or someone may claim them , "
35421	35433	35435	35435	Sylvia	67	" Oh , but I do n't like to do that , "
35437	35443	35444	35444	She	67	" Of course you must ! "
35494	35504	35468	35468	she	67	" Please do n't be cross with me , kind friend,"—that
35516	35523	35524	35524	He	99	Virieu—"but this is so very exciting ! "
35561	35565	35547	35547	He	99	" amie Anglaise ! "
35566	35580	35582	35582	Anna	72	" Are you going to leave the whole of it on this time ? "
35584	35607	35610	35610	Sylvia	67	" Yes , I think I will . It 's rather fun . After all , I 'm only risking twenty francs ! "
35618	35641	35643	35643	Anna	72	" What a pity you did n't start playing with a hundred francs ! Think of how rich you would be now , "
35652	35685	35643	35643	Anna	72	" But it is clear , child , that you are going to do well this evening , and I shall follow your luck ! Take the money off now , however . "
35776	35782	35786	35786	she	67	" A Madame la main ! "
35916	35924	35926	35926	Anna	72	" Now put on a hundred francs , "
36015	36024	36006	36008	the whole table	1247	" That pretty Englishwoman is playing for the first time!"—so
36163	36200	36153	36153	she	67	" I would like to embrace you ! But I know that English ladies do not like kissing in public . It is splendid — splendid ! Look at all the people you have made happy . "
36201	36209	36211	36211	Sylvia	67	" But how about the poor banker ? "
36215	36230	36211	36211	Sylvia	67	" Oh , ' e is all right . ' E is very rich . "
36265	36270	36271	36271	she	73	" Two thousand francs ! "
36276	36288	36289	36289	she	73	" That is very good for a beginning . And you ? "
36305	36309	36311	36312	Madame Wachner	67	" L'Ami Fritz , "
36314	36352	36353	36353	she	73	" will play ' is system , Mesdames . However , I am glad to say that to - day he soon gave it up in honour of our friend here . What ' ave you made ? "
36357	36363	36364	36364	he	111	" Only eight hundred francs , "
36372	36396	36364	36364	he	111	" If you had given me more than that hundred francs , Sophie , I might have made five thousand in the time . "
36397	36400	36401	36401	she	73	" Bah ! "
36404	36434	36401	36401	she	73	" That does not matter . We must not risk more than a hundred francs a day — you know how often I 've told you that , Fritz . "
36540	36554	36556	36557	Madame Wachner	67	" Let us come out of this place and ' ave some ices , "
36561	36583	36556	36557	Madame Wachner	67	" When l'Ami Fritz ' as a stroke of luck ' e often treats ' is old wife to an ice . "
36713	36725	36727	36727	Sylvia	67	" I do n't mean to play again to - night , "
36731	36737	36727	36727	Sylvia	67	" I feel dreadfully tired , "
36825	36860	36862	36862	Anna	72	" I 'm sure that if you had played again , and if we had followed your play , we should have added to our winnings instead of losing , as we have done , "
36865	36871	36862	36862	Anna	72	" I 'm so sorry , "
36887	36891	36893	36895	the Polish woman	386	" Forgive me ! "
36900	36953	36893	36895	the Polish woman	386	" I ought not to have said that to you , dear little friend . No doubt we should all have lost just the same . You know that fortune - teller told me that I should make plenty of money — well , even now I have had a splendid day ! "
36954	36969	36971	36971	Sylvia	67	" Do come back with me and have dinner at the Villa du Lac , "
37008	37015	37016	37016	she	67	" They seem nice homely people , "
37019	37028	37016	37016	she	67	" and Madame Wachner was really very kind . "
37029	37043	37045	37045	Anna	72	" Yes , no doubt ; but she is a very strict wife , "
37048	37106	37045	37045	Anna	72	" The poor man had not one penny piece till she came in , and he got so angry and impatient waiting for her ! I really felt inclined to lend him a little money ; but I have made it a rule never to lend money in a Casino ; it only leads to unpleasantness afterwards . "
37142	37152	37154	37154	Anna	72	" Why , there is the Comte de Virieu ! "
37167	37177	37154	37154	Anna	72	" I had no idea he was staying here . "
37178	37186	37188	37188	Sylvia	67	" Yes , he is staying here , "
37225	37244	37245	37245	she	72	" I can not help being sorry that you are staying in the same hotel as that man , "
37250	37337	37245	37245	she	72	" Do not get to know him too well , dear Sylvia . The Count is a worthless individual ; he has gambled away two fortunes . And now , instead of working , he is content to live on an allowance made to him by his sister 's husband , the Duc d'Eglemont . If I were you , I should keep on very distant terms with him . He is , no doubt , always looking out for a nice rich woman to marry . "
37530	37542	37543	37543	she	73	" I am exceedingly surprised to see him here at Lacville , "
37550	37574	37543	37543	she	73	" I should have expected him to go to a more chic place . He always plays in the winter at Monte Carlo . "
37582	37587	37588	37588	she	67	" But , Anna , "
37591	37608	37588	37588	she	67	" surely the Comte de Virieu is only doing what a great many other people do ! "
37615	37622	37623	37623	she	72	" I see what you mean , "
37626	37805	37623	37623	she	72	" You think it is a case of ' the pot calling the kettle black . ' How excellent are your English proverbs , dear Sylvia ! But no , it is quite different . Take me . I have an income , and choose to spend it in gambling . I might prefer to have a big house , or perhaps I should say a small house , for I am not a very rich woman . But no , I like play , and I am free to spend my money as I like . The Comte de Virieu is very differently situated ! He is , so I 've been told , a clever , cultivated man . He ought to be working — doing something for his country 's good . And then he is so disagreeable ! He makes no friends , no acquaintances . He always looks as if he was doing something of which he was ashamed . He never appears gay or satisfied , not even when he is winning — "
37806	37817	37819	37819	Sylvia	67	" He does not look as cross as Monsieur Wachner , "
37823	37830	37832	37832	Anna	72	" Monsieur Wachner is like me , "
37835	37863	37832	37832	Anna	72	" He probably made a fortune in business , and now he and his wife enjoy risking a little money at play . Why should they not ? "
37864	37881	37883	37883	Sylvia	67	" Madame Wachner told me to - day all about their poor friend who was drowned , "
37886	38038	37883	37883	Sylvia	67	" Ah , yes , that was a sad affair ! They were very foolish to become so intimate with him . Why , they actually had him staying with them at the time ! You see , they had a villa close to the lake - side . And this young Russian , it appears , was very fond of boating . It was a mysterious affair , because , oddly enough , he had not been out in the town , or even to the Casino , for four days before the accident happened . There was a notion among some people that he had committed suicide , but that , I fancy , was not so . He had won a large sum of money . Some thought the gold weighed down his body in the water—. But that is absurd . It must have been the weeds . "
38039	38056	38058	38058	Sylvia	67	" Madame Wachner told me that quite a lot of money was found in his room , "
38061	38132	38058	38058	Sylvia	67	" No , that is not true . About four hundred francs were found in his bed - room . That was all . I fancy the police made themselves rather unpleasant to Monsieur Wachner . The Russian Embassy made inquiries , and it seemed so odd to the French authorities that the poor fellow could not be identified . They found no passport , no papers of any sort — "
38133	38139	38141	38141	Sylvia	67	" Have you a passport ? "
38143	38162	38141	38141	Sylvia	67	" Madame Wachner asked me if I had one . But I 've never even seen a passport ! "
38163	38166	38168	38168	Anna	72	" No , "
38170	38240	38168	38168	Anna	72	" I have not got a passport now . I once had one , but I lost it . One does not require such a thing in a civilised country ! But a Russian must always have a passport , it is an absolute law in Russia . And the disappearance of that young man 's passport was certainly strange — in fact , the whole affair was mysterious . "
38241	38253	38255	38255	Sylvia	67	" It must have been terrible for Monsieur and Madame Wachner , "
38258	38284	38255	38255	Sylvia	67	" Oh yes , very disagreeable indeed ! Luckily he is entirely absorbed in his absurd systems , and she is a very cheerful woman . "
38285	38292	38293	38293	Sylvia	67	" Yes , indeed she is ! "
38299	38330	38293	38293	Sylvia	67	" I am glad we have got to know them , Anna . It is rather mournful when one knows no one at all in a place of this kind . "
38627	38630	38626	38628	Monsieur Wachner—"L'Ami Fritz	121	Wachner—"L'Ami Fritz , "
38844	38846	38847	38847	he	79	" fuss "
39747	39753	39741	39741	she	67	" down on her luck , "
40145	40154	40155	40155	she	67	" The only one I do not like , "
40161	40234	40155	40155	she	67	" is that Count — if indeed Count he be ? He is so arrogant , so proud , so rude ! We have known him for years , have L'Ami Fritz and I , for we are always running across him at Monte Carlo and other places . But no , each time we meet he looks at us as if he was a fish . He does not even nod ! "
40235	40254	40256	40257	Anna Wolsky	72	" When the Comte de Virieu is actually playing , he does not know that other people exist , "
40279	40305	40261	40261	She	72	" I used to watch him two years ago at Monte Carlo , and I have never seen a man more absorbed in his play . "
40306	40312	40314	40315	Madame Wachner	67	" That is no excuse ! "
40319	40391	40314	40315	Madame Wachner	67	" Besides , that is only half the truth . He is ashamed of the way he is spending his life , and he hates the people who see him doing it ! It is shameful to be so idle . A strong young man doing nothing , living on charity , so they say ! And he despises all those who do what he himself is not ashamed to do . "
40437	40457	40459	40460	his wife	455	" Fritz ! Go and see if that is the carriage I ordered to come here at nine o'clock , "
40502	40533	40493	40493	her	455	" I work and work and work , but you do nothing ! Do try and help me — it is for your sake I am taking all this trouble ! "
40595	40599	40603	40603	he	94	" Ami Fritz . "
40610	40613	40614	40614	he	94	" Sophie , "
40621	40638	40614	40614	he	94	" the carriage is here ! Come along — we have wasted too much time already — "
40679	40690	40691	40691	she	72	" What a strange , lonely place to live in ! "
40711	40741	40691	40691	she	72	" And that wood over there — I should be afraid to live so near a wood ! I should think that there might be queer people concealed there . "
40742	40759	40691	40691	she	72	" Bah ! Why should we be frightened , even if there were queer people there ! "
40760	40777	40778	40779	Madame Wachner	67	" Well , but sometimes you must have a good deal of money in this house . "
40782	40826	40778	40779	Madame Wachner	67	" When we have so much money that we can not carry it about , and that , alas ! is not very often — but still , when Fritz makes a big win , we go into Paris and bank the money . "
40827	40836	40838	40838	Anna	72	" I do not trouble to do that , "
40840	40857	40858	40858	she	67	" for I always carry all my money about with me . What do you do ? "
40864	40875	40877	40877	Sylvia	67	" I leave it in my trunk at the hotel , "
40879	40906	40877	40877	Sylvia	67	" The servants at the Villa du Lac seem to be perfectly honest — in fact they are mostly related to the proprietor , M. Polperro . "
40907	40916	40918	40919	Madame Wachner	67	" Oh , but that is quite wrong ! "
40923	40951	40953	40953	she	67	" You should never leave your money in the hotel ; you should always carry it about with you — in little bags like this . See ! "
40987	41001	41002	41002	she	67	" That is the way to carry money in a place like this ! "
41007	41020	41002	41002	she	67	" But now hurry , or all our evening will be gone ! "
41520	41523	41512	41512	she	67	" friendship . "
41535	41547	41525	41525	she	67	" Friendship , I fancy , means one heart between two . "
41618	41625	41651	41651	Félicie	123	" Toc , toc , toc ! "
41717	41731	41732	41732	She	67	" Madame Bailey , Villa du Lac , Lacville - les - Bains . "
41756	41761	41777	41777	her	1387	ran—"Marie - Anne d'Eglemont . "
41875	41885	41886	41886	he	94	" Have you received a note from my sister ? "
41906	41916	41866	41866	his	94	" When I told her how you and I had become"—he
41927	41957	41866	41866	his	94	" good friends , she said how much she would like to meet you . I know that you and my dear Marie - Anne would like one another — "
41958	41975	41977	41977	Sylvia	67	" It is very kind of your sister to ask me to come and see her , "
41983	41993	41994	41994	he	1393	" I am going back to Paris this evening , "
41998	42040	41994	41994	he	1393	" to stay with my sister for a couple of nights . So if you can come to - morrow to lunch , as I think my sister has asked you to do , I will meet you at the station . "
42063	42156	42058	42059	Count Paul	94	" I told Marie - Anne that you were fond of riding , and , with your permission , she proposes to send over a horse for you every morning . And , Madame — forgive me — but I told her I feared you had no riding habit ! You and she , however , are much the same height , and she thinks that she might be able to lend you one if you will honour her by accepting the loan of it during the time you are at Lacville . "
42171	42187	42189	42190	the Count	619	" If you will write a line to my sister some time to - day , "
42192	42202	42189	42190	the Count	619	" I will be the bearer of your letter . "
42492	42496	42488	42488	he	107	" the King , "
42813	42816	42810	42810	she	67	" Dear Madame "
42822	42825	42819	42819	she	67	" Dear Duchesse "
42904	42905	42881	42882	The maid	1434	" Madame,"—so
42908	42962	42881	42882	The maid	1434	note—"it occurs to me that you might like to answer my sister in French , and so I venture to send you the sort of letter that you might perhaps care to write . Each country has its own usages in these matters — that must be my excuse for my apparent impertinence . "
43207	43216	43217	43218	her friend	202	" Why ' ave you not come before ? "
43221	43235	43237	43237	she	67	" Madame Wolsky is making such a sensation ! Come quick — quick ! "
43247	43259	43262	43263	Madame Wachner	67	" I come downstairs to see if I could find you , "
43301	43311	43313	43314	Madame Wachner	67	" A party of young men out from Paris , "
43320	43348	43313	43314	Madame Wachner	67	" are throwing about their money . It might have been terrible . But no , it is a great piece of good fortune for Madame Wolsky ! "
43520	43525	43527	43528	Madame Wachner	67	" One of them , "
43531	43605	43527	43528	Madame Wachner	67	" had already lost eight thousand francs when I went downstairs to look for you ! See , they are still losing . Our friend has the devil 's own luck to - night ! I have forbidden L'Ami Fritz to play at all . Nothing can stand against her . She sweeps the money up every time . If Fritz likes , he can go downstairs to the lower room and play . "
43690	43699	43742	43742	she	72	" Faites vos jeux , Messieurs , Mesdames . "
43702	43713	43742	43742	she	72	" Le jeu est fait ! Rien ne va plus ! "
43790	43805	43808	43808	someone	933	" This is the first time a woman has held the Bank this month , "
43818	43849	43808	43808	someone	933	" Yes , and it is by far the best Bank we have had this month — in fact , it 's the best play we 've had this season ! "
43882	43913	43914	43915	Anna Wolsky	72	" I hope , Madame , you are not going away . I propose now to take the Bank ; surely , you will allow me to have my revenge ? "
43918	43921	43922	43922	she	72	" Certainly ! "
43925	43937	43938	43938	He	1454	" I propose to go on playing for some time longer . "
44009	44013	43993	43993	banker	1460	" follow her luck "
44110	44119	44120	44120	she	1464	" Oh , why is not Fritz here ? "
44123	44148	44120	44120	she	1464	" How sorry I am I sent him downstairs ! But , never mind , his old wife is making some money for once ! "
44174	44191	44171	44171	he	1240	" Well , Madame , I congratulate you ! You must have a very powerful mascot . "
44198	44208	44209	44209	she	72	" It is pleasant to win from a millionaire , "
44214	44254	44255	44255	She	72	" for one knows it does not hurt him ! That young man has a share in the profit on every piece of sugar sold in France , and you know how fond the French are of sweet things ! "
44268	44278	44280	44281	Madame Wachner	67	" What will you do with all your money ? "
44284	44301	44302	44302	she	72	" I told one of the ushers to have it all turned into notes for me , "
44306	44355	44302	44302	she	72	" As to what I shall do with it!—well , I suppose I shall have to go into Paris and bank some of it in a day or two . I sha n't play to - morrow . I shall take a rest — I deserve a rest ! "
44363	44373	44375	44376	Madame Wachner	67	" Shall we drop you at the Pension Malfait ? "
44379	44399	44400	44400	she	72	" It is right on our way home , you know . I , too , have made money — "
44464	44475	44477	44477	Sylvia	67	" I wish I had come in a little earlier , "
44480	44502	44477	44477	Sylvia	67	" I 've never seen you take the Bank before . Surely this is the first time you have done so ? "
44503	44565	44630	44630	She	72	" Yes , this is the first time I have ever been tempted to take the Bank at Lacville . But somehow I suddenly felt as if I should be lucky to - night . You see , I 've made a good deal of money the last day or two , and Madame Wachner persuaded me to try my luck . "
44566	44581	44477	44477	Sylvia	67	" I wish you had told me you were thinking of taking the Bank . "
44582	44589	44591	44591	Anna	72	" I would have told you , "
44594	44629	44591	44591	Anna	72	" if I had seen you to - day . But I have been seeing very little of you lately , Sylvia . Why , you are more with Madame Wachner than with me ! "
44671	44686	44687	44687	she	72	" I will come and see you for a little while to - night , "
44691	44713	44714	44714	She	72	" for I am going to spend to - morrow in Paris — with a friend who is there just now — "
44728	44734	44736	44736	Anna	72	" Yes , do come ! "
44739	44785	44736	44736	Anna	72	" You can stay with me while the carriage takes the Wachners on home , and then it can call for you on the way back . I should not like you to walk to the Villa du Lac alone at this time of night . "
44786	44804	44806	44806	Sylvia	67	" Ah , but I 'm not like you ; I have n't won piles of money ! "
44810	44825	44806	44806	Sylvia	67	" No , but that makes very little difference in a place like this — "
44851	44856	44857	44857	he	112	" I congratulate you ! "
44861	44888	44857	44857	he	112	" What a splendid thing to go on winning like that . I wish I had been there , for I might have followed your luck ! "
44905	44916	44917	44918	Monsieur Wachner	111	" And what will you do with all that money ? "
44922	44936	44917	44918	Monsieur Wachner	111	" It is a great sum to carry about , is it not ? "
44937	44962	44964	44965	his wife	455	" It is far better to carry about one 's money than to trust it to anyone but to a well - managed bank , "
44974	45007	44964	44965	his wife	455	" As for the hotel - keepers , I would not trust them with one penny . What happened to a friend of ours , eh , Fritz , tell them that ? "
45024	45035	45037	45038	her husband	254	" I do n't know what you are talking about , "
45042	45141	45142	45142	she	1477	" Yes , you do ! That friend of ours who was boarding in one of those small houses in the Condamine at Monte Carlo , and who one day won a lot of money . He gave his winnings to his hotel - keeper to keep for the night . Next day the man said his safe had been broken open by a foreign waiter who had disappeared . Our friend had no redress — none at all ! Malfait may be a very good sort of man , but I would not give him your money — "
45147	45154	45156	45157	Madame Wolsky	73	" No , of course not , "
45159	45230	45156	45157	Madame Wolsky	73	" I should never think of entrusting a really large sum of money to a man of whom I know nothing . It is , as you say , very much better to keep one 's money on one 's person . It 's the plan I 've always followed . Then , if it is stolen , or if one loses it , one has only oneself to blame . "
45231	45240	45241	45241	she	1477	" It is very exciting taking the Bank , "
45248	45262	45241	45241	she	1477	" I think I shall take the Bank again next time I play . "
45287	45298	45282	45283	Madame Wachner	67	" Will you both come to supper to - morrow ? "
45304	45314	45315	45315	she	67	" I am going into Paris for the day , "
45318	45337	45315	45315	she	67	" and I shall feel tired when I get back . But many thanks , all the same . "
45338	45342	45343	45343	Wachner	67	" Then you must come"—Madame
45348	45359	45343	45343	Wachner	67	" We also will have a rest from the Casino . "
45360	45371	45343	45343	Wachner	67	" Very well ! I accept gratefully your kind invitation . "
45372	45390	45343	45343	Wachner	67	" Come early . Come at six , and we can ' ave a cosy chat first . "
45391	45397	45343	45343	Wachner	67	" Yes , I will ! "
45440	45450	45451	45451	she	67	" You need not light a candle , Anna , "
45454	45493	45451	45451	she	67	" It 's so pleasant just now , so quiet and cool , and the light would only attract those horrid midges . They seem to me the only things I have to find fault with in Lacville ! "
45509	45512	45513	45513	she	72	" Sylvia , "
45516	45532	45513	45513	she	72	" dear little Sylvia ! Sometimes I feel uneasy at having brought you to Lacville . "
45543	45554	45533	45533	She	72	" Indeed , you need feel nothing of the kind . "
45589	45605	45606	45606	she	67	" You need never think that I run the slightest risk of becoming a gambler , "
45614	45698	45606	45606	she	67	" I was looking at my account - book to - day , and I find that since I have been here I have lost seventy francs . Two days ago I had won a hundred and ten francs . So you see it is not a very serious matter , is it ? Just think of all the fun I 've had ! It 's well worth the money I 've lost . Besides , I shall probably win it all back — "
45699	45708	45710	45711	Anna Wolsky	72	" I was not thinking of the money , "
45731	45747	45750	45750	Anna	72	" I 'm afraid that you are becoming very fond of the Comte de Virieu , "
45760	45853	45750	45750	Anna	72	" You must forgive me , Sylvia , but I am older than you are . Have you thought of the consequences of this friendship of yours ? I confess that at the beginning I credited that man with the worst of motives , but now I feel afraid that he is in love — in fact I feel sure that he is madly in love with you . Do you know that he never takes his eyes off you in the Club ? Often he forgets to pick up his winnings .... "
45893	45931	45885	45885	she	67	" You can believe me when I say that he has never said a word of love to me . He has never even flirted with me . I give you my word that that is so ! "
45932	46020	45885	45885	she	67	" Ah , but it is just that fact that makes me believe that he cares . Flirtation is an English art , not a French art , my dear Sylvia . A Frenchman either loves — and when he loves he adores on his knees — or else he has no use , no use at all , for what English people mean by flirtation — the make - believe of love ! I should feel much more at ease if the Count had insulted you — "
46021	46024	45885	45885	she	67	" Anna ! "
46025	46041	45885	45885	she	67	" Yes , indeed ! I am quite serious . I fear he loves you . "
46058	46110	46054	46054	Anna	72	" Of course , I do not regard him with trust or with liking . How could I ? On the other hand , I do not go as far as the Wachners ; they , it is quite clear , evidently know something very much to the Count 's discredit . "
46111	46119	46121	46121	Sylvia	67	" I do n't believe they do ! "
46125	46169	46121	46121	Sylvia	67	" It is mere prejudice on their part ! He does not like them , and they know it . He thinks them vulgar sort of people , and he suspects that Monsieur Wachner is German — that is quite enough for him . "
46170	46198	46200	46200	Anna	72	" But , after all , it does not really matter what the Wachners think of the Comte de Virieu , or what he thinks of them , "
46202	46219	46200	46200	Anna	72	" What matters is what you think of him , and what he thinks of you . "
46236	46242	46244	46246	the Polish lady	228	" You do not realise , "
46250	46291	46244	46246	the Polish lady	228	" what your life would be if you were married to a man whose only interest in life is play . Mind you , I do not say that a gambler does not make a kind husband . We have an example"—she
46294	46330	46331	46331	Sylvia	67	little—"in this Monsieur Wachner . He is certainly very fond of his wife , and she is very fond of him . But would you like your husband always to prefer his vice to you ? "
46336	46345	46331	46331	Sylvia	67	" But why am I talking like that ? "
46352	46454	46346	46347	Anna Wolsky	72	" It is absurd of me to think it possible that you would dream of marrying the Comte de Virieu ! No , no , my dear child , this poor Frenchman is one of those men who , even if personally charming , no wise woman would think of marrying . He is absolutely ruined . I do not suppose he has a penny left of his own in the world . He would not have the money to buy you a wedding ring . You would have to provide even that ! It would be madness — absolute madness ! "
46455	46461	46463	46463	Sylvia	67	" I do not think , "
46470	46522	46463	46463	Sylvia	67	" that there is the slightest likelihood of my ever marrying the Comte de Virieu . You forget that I have known him only a short time , and that he has never said a word of love to me . As you say , all he cares about is play . "
46523	46544	46546	46546	Anna	72	" Surely you must be as well aware as I am that lately he has played a great deal less , "
46548	46585	46546	46546	Anna	72	" and the time that he would have spent at the Club — well , you and I know very well where he has spent the time , Sylvia . He has spent it with you . "
46586	46595	46597	46597	Sylvia	67	" And is n't that a good thing ? "
46601	46644	46597	46597	Sylvia	67	" Is n't it far better that he should spend his time talking to me about ordinary things than in the Casino ? Let me assure you again , and most solemnly , Anna , that he never makes love to me — "
46645	46658	46546	46546	Anna	72	" Of course it is a good thing for him that he plays less"—Anna
46660	46707	46597	46597	Sylvia	67	impatiently—"but is it best for you ? That is what I ask myself . You have not looked well lately , Sylvia . You have looked very sad sometimes . Oh , do not be afraid , you are quite as pretty as ever you were ! "
46755	46763	46744	46744	Anna	72	" Shall we go away from Lacville ? "
46770	46815	46765	46766	Madame Wolsky	73	" There are a hundred places where you and I could go together . Let us leave Lacville ! I am sure you feel just as I do — I am sure you realise that the Comte de Virieu would never make you happy . "
46821	46830	46831	46831	she	67	" I do not want to go away , "
46843	46846	46847	46847	she	73	" Ah ! "
46850	46875	46847	46847	she	73	" I understand . He is the friend you are to meet to - morrow — that is why you are going into Paris ! "
46880	46887	46890	46890	Anna	72	" I understand it all now , "
46892	46980	46890	46890	Anna	72	" That is the reason why he was not there to - night . He has gone into Paris so as not to compromise you at Lacville . That is the sort of gallantry that means so little ! As if Lacville matters — but tell me this , Sylvia ? Has he ever spoken to you as if he desired to introduce his family to you ? That is the test , remember — that is the test of a Frenchman 's regard for a woman . "
46989	46997	46998	46998	They	1489	" The carriage for Madame has arrived . "
47029	47039	47040	47040	she	73	" God bless you , my dear little friend ! "
47043	47111	47040	47040	she	73	" and forgive all I have said to you to - night ! Still , think the matter over . I have lived a great deal of my life in this country . I am almost a Frenchwoman . It is no use marrying a Frenchman unless his family marry you too — and I understand that the Comte de Virieu 's family have cast him off . "
47150	47166	47167	47167	she	72	" We will meet the day after to - morrow , is that not so ? "
47725	47730	47718	47718	he	99	" petite amie Anglaise , "
48508	48522	48504	48504	he	99	" My brother - in - law does not like motor - cars , "
48622	48626	48627	48627	he	99	" Every Frenchman , "
48632	48692	48627	48627	he	99	" is in love with love , and when you hear — as you may do sometimes , Madame — that a Frenchman is rarely in love with his own wife , pray answer that this is quite untrue ! For it often happens that in his wife a Frenchman discovers the love he has sought elsewhere in vain . "
48702	48810	48699	48699	he	99	" As for marriage — well , marriage is in my country regarded as a very serious matter indeed ! No Frenchman goes into marriage as light - heartedly as does the average Englishman , and as have done , for instance , so many of my own English schoolfellows . No , to a Frenchman his marriage means everything or nothing , and if he loved a woman it would appear to him a dastardly action to ask her to share his life if he did not believe that life to be what would be likely to satisfy her , to bring her honour and happiness . "
48831	48858	48825	48825	she	67	" But would love ever make the kind of Frenchman you describe give up a way of life that was likely to make his wife unhappy ? "
48880	48923	48924	48925	The victoria	1550	" Yes ! He might easily give up that life for the sake of a beloved woman . But would he remain always faithful in his renunciation ? That is the question which none , least of all himself , can answer ! "
48969	48992	48993	48993	he	94	" My brother - in - law has never cared to move west , as so many of his friends have done , "
48996	49019	48993	48993	he	94	" He prefers to remain in the old family house that was built by his great - grandfather before the French Revolution . "
49456	49469	49441	49442	Count Paul	94	" My dear godmother , let me present to you Mrs. Bailey , "
49547	49561	49562	49563	the Duchesse	1547	" I wish to thank you for your kindness to my poor Paul , "
49572	49583	49562	49563	the Duchesse	1547	" You have so much influence over him , Madame . "
49589	49598	49586	49586	her	67	" Ah ! But yes , you have ! "
49605	49658	49659	49659	She	67	" You know what I mean ? You know what I would ask you to do ? My husband could give Paul work in the country , work he would love , for he adores horses , if only he could be rescued from this terrible infatuation , this passion for play . "
49700	49706	49707	49707	she	1594	" Sit down , Madame , "
49733	49740	49741	49741	she	1595	" Permit me to embrace you , "
49745	49777	49778	49778	She	1595	" You are a very pretty creature ! And though no doubt young lips often tell you this , the compliments of the old have the merit of being quite sincere ! "
49807	49821	49822	49824	the old lady	1595	" Madame Bailey 's rouge is natural ; it does not come off ! "
49838	49890	49891	49891	She	1595	" Not but what a great deal of nonsense is talked about the usage of rouge , my dear children ! There is no harm in supplementing the niggardly gifts of nature . You , for instance , Marie - Anne , would look all the better for a little rouge ! "
49915	49927	49928	49928	she	1547	" But I should feel so ashamed if it came off , "
49932	49953	49928	49928	she	1547	" if , for instance , I felt one of my cheeks growing pale while the other remained bright red ? "
49954	50043	49928	49928	she	1547	" That would never happen if you used what I have often told you is the only rouge a lady should use , that is , the sap of the geranium blossom — that gives an absolutely natural tint to the skin , and my own dear mother always used it . You remember how Louis XVIII . complimented her on her beautiful complexion at the first Royal ball held after the Restoration ? Well , the Sovereign 's gracious words were entirely owing to the geranium blossom ! "
50557	50561	50562	50562	she	72	" Come in , "
50584	50587	50582	50582	Anna	72	" Entrez ! "
50649	50655	50656	50656	Sylvia	67	" Madame Wolsky est partie . "
50660	50663	50656	50656	Sylvia	67	" Partie ? "
50674	50677	50704	50705	the man	185	" Sortie . "
50693	50700	50701	50701	she	67	" Then the lady was out ? "
50707	50716	50717	50717	he	185	" The lady has left the Pension Malfait , "
50722	50728	50717	50717	he	185	" She has gone away . "
50729	50736	50737	50737	Sylvia	67	" There must be some mistake ! "
50743	50755	50737	50737	Sylvia	67	" My friend would never have left Lacville without telling me . "
50761	50778	50756	50757	The commissionaire	1620	" But I have brought back a motor - cab as Madame directed me to do . "
51050	51057	51058	51058	she	67	" Madame Wachner ! Madame Wachner ! "
51132	51145	51146	51146	she	67	" Have you heard that Anna Wolsky is away for the day ? "
51149	51198	51146	51146	she	67	" I have received such a mysterious message from the Pension Malfait ! Do come with me there and find out where she has gone and when she is coming back . Did she say anything about going into Paris when she had supper with you last night ? "
51267	51274	51275	51275	she	67	" I can not tell you , "
51282	51290	51275	51275	she	67	" what has happened to Madame Wolsky — "
51291	51298	51300	51300	Sylvia	67	" What has happened to her ! "
51302	51311	51275	51275	she	67	" What do you mean , Madame Wachner ? "
51312	51324	51325	51326	Madame Wachner	67	" Oh , of course , nothing ' as ' appened . "
51332	51368	51325	51326	Madame Wachner	67	" All I mean is that Madame Wolsky did not come to us yesterday evening . We stayed in on purpose , but , as English people say so funnily , she never turn up ! "
51369	51382	51275	51275	she	67	" But she was coming to tea as well as to supper ! "
51383	51421	51275	51275	she	67	" Yes , we waited for ' er a long time , and I ' ad got such a beautiful little supper ! But , alas ! she did not come — no , not at all . "
51422	51438	51325	51326	Madame Wachner	67	" How odd of her ! Perhaps she got a telegram which contained bad news — "
51439	51442	51444	51445	Madame Wachner	67	" Yes , "
51448	51496	51444	51445	Madame Wachner	67	" no doubt . For this morning when I go to the Pension Malfait , I ' ear that she ' as gone away ! It was for that I was ' urrying to the Villa du Lac to see if you knew anything , dear friend . "
51497	51501	51503	51503	Sylvia	67	" Gone away ? "
51507	51536	51325	51326	Madame Wachner	67	" But it is inconceivable that Anna could have left Lacville without telling me — or , for the matter of that , without telling you , too — "
51537	51552	51554	51555	Madame Wachner	67	" She ' as taken what you in England call ' French leave , ' "
51558	51592	51554	51555	Madame Wachner	67	" It was not very considerate of ' er . She might ' ave sent us word last night . We would not then ' ave waited to ' ave our nice supper . "
51593	51604	51606	51606	Sylvia	67	" She ca n't have gone away without telling me , "
51628	51645	51646	51648	The older woman	349	" I am sure she would never have done such a thing . Why should she ? "
51653	51662	51663	51663	she	349	" I expect she will come back soon , "
51667	51697	51663	51663	she	349	" She ' as left her luggage at the Pension Malfait , and that , after all , does not look as if she ' as gone for evare ! "
51698	51703	51705	51705	Sylvia	67	" Left her luggage ? "
51712	51763	51765	51765	her	349	" Why , then , of course , she is coming back ! I expect she has gone to Paris for a night in order to see friends passing through . How could the Pension Malfait people think she had gone — I mean for good ? You know , Madame Wachner"—she
51782	51797	51769	51769	she	349	say—"you know that Anna won a very large sum of money two nights ago . "
51830	51840	51854	51855	Madame Wachner	67	" I do hope nothing has happened to her ! "
51841	51853	51854	51855	Madame Wachner	67	" ' Appened to ' er ? What do you mean ? "
51860	51869	51871	51871	she	67	" Who ever thought of such a thing ! "
51886	51930	51871	51871	she	67	" As to her winnings — yes , she won a lot of money the night she took the bank . But , remember that she ' as ' ad plenty of time yesterday to lose it all again — ah , yes ! "
51931	51942	51944	51944	Sylvia	67	" But she meant to give up play till Monday , "
51948	51960	51944	51944	Sylvia	67	" I feel sure she never went inside the Casino yesterday . "
51961	51975	51871	51871	she	67	" Oh , but she did . My ' usband saw her there . "
51976	51981	51983	51983	Sylvia	67	" At what time ? "
51987	51992	51983	51983	Sylvia	67	" Let me see — "
51993	52015	51871	51871	she	67	" Of course , it must have been early , as you were back waiting for her late in the afternoon . "
52016	52088	51871	51871	she	67	" Yes , it must have been early . And once in the Casino!—well , dear friend , you know as well as I do that with Madame Wolsky the money flies ! Still , let us suppose she did not lose ' er money yesterday . In that case surely Madame Wolsky would ' ave done well to leave Lacville with ' er gains in ' er pocket - book . "
52263	52280	52282	52282	Sylvia	67	" I am quite sure Anna did not mean to be rude , dear Madame Wachner , "
52286	52312	52282	52282	Sylvia	67	" You know she may have sent you a letter or a message which miscarried . They are rather careless people at the Pension Malfait . "
52313	52324	52326	52327	the other	422	" Yes , of course , that is always possible , "
52362	52370	52371	52371	she	67	" Look ' ere , my dear , "
52376	52393	52371	52371	she	67	" do not worry about Madame Wolsky . Believe me , she is not worth it . "
52408	52434	52402	52403	Madame Wachner	67	" She thought of nothing but play — that is the truth ! Play , play , play ! Other times she was half asleep ! "
52450	52510	52447	52447	she	67	" I believe in my ' eart that she ' as gone off to Aix . The play ' ere was not big enough for ' er . And remember that you ' ave good friends still left in Lacville . I do not only speak of me and of my ' usband , but also of another one . "
52583	52609	52611	52611	Sylvia	67	" We will , at any rate , go in and find out when Anna left , and if she said where she was going , "
52613	52620	52622	52623	Madame Wachner	67	" If you do not mind , "
52625	52657	52622	52623	Madame Wachner	67	" I will remain out here , in the car . They have already seen me this morning at the Pension Malfait . They must be quite tired of seeing me . "
52761	52767	52768	52768	she	135	" Bon jour , Madame ! "
52772	52875	52768	52768	she	135	" I suppose you also have come to ask me about Madame Wolsky ? But I think you must have heard all there is to hear from the lady whom I see out there in the car . I can tell you nothing more than I have already told her . Madame Wolsky has treated us with great want of consideration . She did not come home last evening . Poor Malfait waited up all night , wondering what could be the matter . And then , this morning , we found a letter in her room saying she had gone away ! "
52876	52883	52885	52885	Sylvia	67	" A letter in her room ? "
52887	52902	52768	52768	she	135	" Madame Wachner did not tell me that my friend had left a letter — "
52910	52990	52904	52905	Madame Malfait	135	" Madame Wolsky need not have troubled to write ! A word of explanation would have been better , and would have prevented my husband sitting up till five o'clock this morning . We quite feared something must have happened to her . But we have a great dislike to any affair with the police , and so we thought we would wait before telling them of her disappearance , and it is indeed fortunate that we did so ! "
52991	53004	53006	53006	Sylvia	67	" Will you kindly show me the letter she left for you ? "
53223	53229	53230	53230	she	67	" What a strange thing ! "
53238	53318	53230	53230	she	67	" How extraordinary it is that my friend should have gone away like this , leaving her luggage behind her ! What can possibly have made her want to leave Lacville in such a hurry ? She was actually engaged to have dinner with our friends , Monsieur and Madame Wachner . Did she not send them any sort of message , Madame Malfait ? I wish you would try and remember what she said when she went out . "
53329	53342	53343	53343	she	343	" If you ask me to tell you the truth , Madame , "
53349	53381	53343	53343	she	343	" I have no doubt at all that your friend went to the Casino yesterday and lost a great deal of money — that she became , in fact , décavée . "
53399	53458	53396	53396	she	343	" But Madame Wolsky is a very honest lady , that I will say for her . You see , she left enough money to pay for everything , as well as to provide my servants with handsome gratuities . That is more than the last person who left the Pension Malfait in a hurry troubled to do ! "
53459	53484	53486	53486	Sylvia	67	" But is it not extraordinary that she left her luggage , and that she did not even tell you where she was going ? "
53494	53595	53486	53486	Sylvia	67	" Pardon me , Madame , that is not strange at all ! Madame Wolsky probably went off to Paris without knowing exactly where she meant to stay , and no one wants to take luggage with them when they are looking round for an hotel . I am expecting at any moment to receive a telegram telling me where to send the luggage . You , Madame , if you permit me to say so , have not had my experience — my experience , I mean , in the matter of ladies who play at the Lacville Casino . "
53613	53661	53609	53609	she	1666	" True , Madame Wolsky has not behaved as badly as she might have done . Still , you must admit that it is rather inconsiderate of her , after engaging the room for the whole of the month of August , to go off like this ! "
53699	53715	53716	53716	she	1666	" Madame will not say too much about her friend 's departure , will she ? "
53721	53766	53716	53716	she	1666	" I do not want any embarrassments with the police . Everything is quite en règle , is it not ? After all , Madame Wolsky had a right to go away without telling anyone of her plans , had she not , Madame ? "
53771	53783	53784	53784	she	67	" Certainly , she had an entire right to do so , "
53788	53820	53784	53784	she	67	" But , still , I should be much obliged if you will send me word when you receive the telegram you are expecting her to send you about the luggage . "
53821	53824	53826	53827	Madame Wachner	67	" Well ? "
53839	53854	53831	53831	Sylvia	67	" Have you learnt anything ? Have they not had news of our friend ? "
53855	53869	53871	53871	Sylvia	67	" They have heard nothing since they found that odd letter of hers , "
53873	53885	53871	53871	Sylvia	67	" You never told me about the letter , Madame Wachner ? "
53886	53906	53908	53909	Madame Wachner	67	" Ah , that letter ! I saw it , too . But it said nothing , absolutely nothing ! "
53925	53943	53918	53918	Anna	72	" I should have thought they would have had a telegram to - day about the luggage . "
53944	53949	53951	53951	Sylvia	67	" So would I , "
53957	53978	53871	53871	Sylvia	67	" I should never , never have expected Anna Wolsky to go off like that . So — so mysteriously — "
53979	54002	54004	54005	Madame Wachner	67	" Well , there , I quite disagree with you ! It is just what I should have expected her to do ! "
54007	54061	54062	54062	She	67	" She told me of that visit you both made to the soothsayer . Perhaps she made up in her mind to follow that person 's advice . Our friend was always a little mysterious , was she not ? Did she ever talk to you of her family , of her friends ? "
54069	54074	54076	54076	Sylvia	67	" Yes — no , "
54080	54108	54076	54076	Sylvia	67	" I do not think poor Anna has many relations . You see , she is a widow . I believe her father and mother are dead . "
54109	54130	54062	54062	She	67	" Ah , that is very sad ! Then you do not know of anyone to write to about her ? "
54131	54134	54136	54136	Sylvia	67	" I ? "
54138	54179	54136	54136	Sylvia	67	" No , of course I do n't know of anyone to write to . How could I ? I have n't known her very long , you know , Madame Wachner . But we became friends almost at once . "
54197	54209	54210	54210	she	67	" Can I drive you back to the Châlet des Muguets ? "
54213	54229	54210	54210	she	67	" Somehow I do n't feel inclined to take a drive in the forest now . "
54230	54237	54239	54240	Madame Wachner	67	" If you do not mind , "
54242	54262	54263	54263	She	67	" I should prefer to be driven to the station , for l'Ami Fritz had to go to Paris . "
54267	54288	54263	54263	She	67	" To fetch money , as usual ! His system did not work at all well yesterday — poor Fritz ! "
54289	54293	54295	54295	Sylvia	67	" How horrid ! "
54297	54312	54295	54295	Sylvia	67	" It must be very disappointing to your husband when his system goes wrong . "
54313	54318	54320	54321	the wife	1672	" Yes , very , "
54324	54389	54320	54321	the wife	1672	" But when one system fails — well , then he at once sets himself to inventing another ! I lose a great deal more in the lower room playing with francs than Fritz does at baccarat playing with gold . You see , a system has this good about it — the player generally comes out even at the end of each month . "
54390	54396	54404	54405	the other	422	" Does he , indeed ? "
54451	54462	54463	54463	she	67	" We must not let you become low - spirited ! "
54466	54490	54463	54463	she	67	" It is a great pity your kind friend has gone away . But doubtless you will soon be going away , too ? "
54499	54556	54494	54494	Sylvia	67	" Perhaps it would be well not to say too much concerning Madame Wolsky having left like this . She might come back any moment , and then she would not like it if there had been a fuss made about it ! If I were you I would tell nobody — I repeat emphatically nobody . "
54564	54634	54557	54558	Madame Wachner	67	" You do not know what the police of Lacville are like , my dear friend . They are very unpleasant people . As you were Anna 's only friend in the place , they might give you considerable trouble . They would ask you where to look for her , and they would torment you incessantly . If I were you I would say as little as possible . "
55393	55422	55423	55423	he	94	" Paris was so hot , and my sister found that friends of hers were passing through , so I came back earlier than I meant to do , "
55432	55438	55423	55423	he	94	" Is anything the matter ? "
55456	55467	55439	55439	He	94	" Did you have a bad night at the tables ? "
55473	55484	55470	55470	her	67	" Something so strange — so unexpected — has happened . "
55489	55496	55470	55470	her	67	" Anna Wolsky has left Lacville ! "
55497	55501	55502	55503	Count Paul	94	" Left Lacville ? "
55531	55544	55545	55545	He	94	" Have you and she quarrelled , Mrs. Bailey ? You permit ? "
55555	55561	55548	55548	she	67	" Yes , please do , "
55567	55583	55545	55545	He	94	" Quarrelled ? Oh , no ! She has simply gone away without telling me ! "
55596	55602	55603	55603	he	99	" That 's very strange , "
55606	55625	55603	55603	he	99	" I should have thought your friend was not likely to leave Lacville for many weeks to come . "
55678	55686	55687	55687	he	99	" But where has Madame Wolsky gone ? "
55691	55704	55687	55687	he	99	" And why has she left ? Surely she is coming back ? "
55741	55767	55731	55732	Mrs. Bailey	71	" That 's the extraordinary thing about it ! I have n't the slightest idea where Anna is , or why she has left Lacville . "
55776	55828	55731	55732	Mrs. Bailey	71	" She did not give me the slightest warning of what she was thinking of doing ; in fact , only a few days ago , when we were talking of our future plans , I tried to persuade her to come back to England with me on a long visit . "
55829	55836	55837	55837	he	1703	" Tell me all that happened , "
55906	55911	55912	55912	she	67	" They all think , "
55917	55966	55912	55912	she	67	" that Anna went to the Casino and lost all her money — both the money she made , and the money she brought here ; and that then , not liking to tell even me anything about it , she made up her mind to go away . "
55967	55973	55975	55976	Count Paul	94	" They all think this ? "
55980	55991	55975	55976	Count Paul	94	" Whom do you mean by all , Mrs. Bailey ? "
55992	56006	55912	55912	she	67	" I mean the people at the Pension Malfait , and the Wachners — "
56007	56017	55912	55912	she	67	" Then you saw the Wachners to - day ? "
56018	56032	56034	56034	Sylvia	67	" I met Madame Wachner as I was going to the Pension Malfait , "
56036	56110	56034	56034	Sylvia	67	" and she went there with me . You see , the Wachners asked Anna to have supper with them yesterday , and they waited for her ever so long , but she never came . That makes it clear that she must have left Lacville some time in the early afternoon . I wish — I can not help wishing — that I had not gone into Paris yesterday , Count Paul . "
56123	56128	56129	56129	she	67	" No , no , "
56134	56185	56129	56129	she	67	" Of course , I do not mean that ! I had a very , very happy time , and your sister was very kind and sweet to me . But it makes me unhappy to think that Anna may have been worried and anxious about money with me away — "
56216	56225	56226	56226	she	67	" Do you believe in fortune - tellers ? "
56230	56235	56226	56226	she	67	" Are you superstitious ? "
56236	56248	56249	56249	he	99	" Like everyone else , I have been to such people , "
56253	56313	56249	56249	he	99	" But if you ask my true opinion — well , no ; I am quite sceptical ! There may be something in what these dealers in hope sometimes say , but more often there is nothing . In fact , you must remember that a witch generally tells her client what she believes her client wishes to hear . "
56314	56347	56348	56349	Mrs. Bailey	71	" Madame Wachner is inclined to think that Anna left Lacville because of something which a fortune - teller told her — indeed told both of us — before we came here . "
56361	56366	56367	56367	he	1706	" Tiens ! Tiens ! "
56370	56406	56367	56367	he	1706	" That is an odd idea ! Pray tell me all about it . Did you and your friend consult a fashionable necromancer , or did you content yourselves with going to a cheap witch ? "
56407	56414	56415	56415	Sylvia	67	" To quite a cheap witch . "
56484	56492	56493	56493	she	67	" The woman called herself Madame Cagliostra , "
56498	56541	56493	56493	she	67	" and she only charged five francs . In the end we did pay her fifteen . But she gave us plenty for our money , I assure you — in fact , I ca n't remember half the things she said ! "
56542	56550	56551	56552	Count Paul	94	" And to you was prophesied — ? "
56564	56642	56561	56561	Sylvia	67	" Oh , she told me all sorts of things ! As you say they do n't really know anything ; they only guess . One of the things that she told me was that it was possible , in fact , quite likely , that I should never go back to England — I mean at all ! And that if I did so , I should go as a stranger . Was n't that absurd ? "
56643	56647	56649	56650	Count Paul	94	" Quite absurd , "
56654	56693	56649	56650	Count Paul	94	" For even if you married again , Madame ; if you married a Frenchman , for instance , you would still wish to go back to your own country sometimes — at least , I suppose so . "
56694	56700	56561	56561	Sylvia	67	" Of course I should . "
56752	56827	56828	56828	Sylvia	67	" She said almost the same thing to Anna . Was n't that odd ? I mean she said that Anna would probably never go back to her own country . But what was really very strange was that she did not seem to be able to see into Anna 's future at all . And then — oh well , she behaved very oddly . After we had gone she called us back — "
56834	56837	56839	56840	Count Paul	94	" Well ? "
56843	56848	56839	56840	Count Paul	94	" What happened then ? "
56884	56962	56864	56864	he	94	" She made us stand side by side — you must understand , Count , that we had already paid her and gone away — when she called us back . She stared at us in a very queer sort of way , and said that we must not leave Paris , or if we did leave Paris , we must not leave together . She said that if we did so we should run into danger . "
56963	56968	56970	56971	the Count	619	" All rather vague , "
56973	57005	56970	56971	the Count	619	" And , from the little I know of her , I should fancy Madame Wolsky the last woman in the world to be really influenced by that kind of thing . "
57057	57070	57072	57072	Sylvia	67	" Oh , but at the time Anna was very much impressed , "
57076	57174	57072	57072	Sylvia	67	" Far more than I was — I know it made her nervous when she was first playing at the tables . And when she lost so much money the first week we were here she said to me , ' That woman was right . We ought not to have come to Lacville ! ' But afterwards , when she began to be so wonderfully lucky , she forgot all about it , or , rather , she only remembered that the woman had said to her that she would have a great run of luck . "
57175	57184	57186	57187	Count Paul	94	" Then the woman said that , too , "
57200	57211	57195	57196	his godmother	1711	" I felicitate you on your conquest , naughty Paul ! "
57235	57266	57229	57229	She	1595	" Why not turn over a new leaf ? Why not marry this pretty creature ? We should all be pleased to see you behave like a reasonable human being . "
57274	57287	57269	57269	Sylvia	67	" Yes , the woman said that Anna would be very lucky . "
57308	57327	57300	57300	his	99	" I presume you have already telephoned to the hotel in Paris where you first met Madame Wolsky ? "
57328	57340	57342	57342	Sylvia	67	" Why , it never occurred to me to do that ! "
57344	57350	57342	57342	Sylvia	67	" What a good idea ! "
57351	57354	57355	57355	he	94	" Wait , "
57358	57368	57355	57355	he	94	" I will go and do it for you . "
57381	57432	57378	57378	his	94	" I am sorry to say the people at the Hôtel de l'Horloge know nothing of Madame Wolsky . They have had no news of her since you and she both left the place . I wonder if the Wachners know more of her disappearance than they have told you ? "
57433	57439	57441	57441	Sylvia	67	" What do you mean ? "
57447	57454	57455	57455	he	94	" They 're such odd people , "
57463	57489	57455	57455	he	94	" And you know they were always with your friend . When you were not there , they hardly ever left her for a moment . "
57490	57526	57528	57528	Sylvia	67	" But I thought I had told you how distressed they are about it ? How they waited for her last evening and how she never came ? Oh no , the Wachners know nothing , "
57756	57767	57768	57768	he	93	" Oh no , do not go to the police ! "
57775	57825	57768	57768	he	93	" No , no , I do not advise you to do that ! Heaven knows I would do anything in reason to help you , Madame , to find your friend . But I beg of you not to ask me to go for you to the police ! "
57854	57860	57861	57861	she	67	" I will go myself , "
57883	57894	57895	57895	he	99	" What is it you will do yourself , Madame ? "
57906	57922	57923	57923	she	67	" I feel that I should like to speak to the police about Anna Wolsky , "
57926	57973	57923	57923	she	67	" It is the first thing one would do in England if a friend suddenly disappeared — in fact , the police are always looking for people who have gone away in a mysterious manner . You see , I ca n't help being afraid , Count Paul"—she
57976	58025	57876	57879	the Comte de Virieu	99	voice—"that Anna has met with some dreadful accident . She has n't a friend in Paris ! Suppose she is lying now in some hospital , unable to make herself understood ? I only wish that I had a photograph of Anna that I could take to them . "
58026	58069	57923	57923	she	67	" Well , there is a possibility that this may be so . But remember it is even more probable that Madame Wolsky is quite well , and that she will be annoyed at your taking any such step to find her . "
58070	58073	58075	58075	Sylvia	67	" Yes , "
58079	58147	58075	58075	Sylvia	67	" I know that is quite possible . And yet — and yet it is so very unlike Anna not to send me a word of explanation ! And then , you know in that letter she left in her room at the Pension Malfait she positively promised to send a telegram about her luggage . Surely it is very strange that she has not done that ? "
58148	58160	58163	58165	Comte de Virieu	99	" Well , if you really wish the police communicated with , "
58167	58181	58163	58165	Comte de Virieu	99	" I will go to the police - station here , with pleasure . "
58182	58190	58192	58192	Sylvia	67	" Why should we not go together ? "
58196	58249	58250	58250	He	99	" By all means . But think over what we are to say when we get there . If your friend had not left the letter behind her , then , of course it would be our positive duty to communicate with the police . But I can not help being afraid — "
58254	58261	58263	58263	Sylvia	67	" Of what are you afraid ? "
58266	58285	58263	58263	Sylvia	67	" I am afraid that Madame Wolsky may be very much offended by your interference in the matter . "
58286	58291	58293	58293	Sylvia	67	" Oh , no ! "
58295	58344	58293	58293	Sylvia	67	" Indeed , in that you are quite mistaken ! I know Anna would never be offended by anything I could do . She was very fond of me , and so am I of her . But in any case I am willing to risk it . You see"—her
58348	58356	58293	58293	Sylvia	67	quivered—"I am really very unhappy about Anna — "
58357	58370	58372	58373	the Count	619	" When would you like to go to the Commissioner of Police ? "
58375	58387	58372	58373	the Count	619	" Is there any reason why we should not go now ? "
58388	58411	58451	58452	Count Paul	94	" No . Let us go at once . I only had the feeling that you might hear from her any moment . "
58497	58502	58503	58503	he	94	" Here we are ! "
58507	58517	58519	58519	Sylvia	67	" It does n't look a very imposing place , "
58606	58611	58612	58612	he	1732	" Monsieur ? Madame ? "
58640	58648	58649	58649	he	1732	" What can I do for you ? "
58652	58659	58662	58662	he	1732	" I am at your service , "
58708	58716	58717	58717	he	1732	" Madame has now been at Lacville three weeks?"—and
58735	58771	58717	58717	he	1732	" And her friend , a Polish lady named Wolsky , has left Lacville rather suddenly ? Madame has , however , received a letter from her friend explaining that she had to leave unexpectedly ? "
58772	58775	58777	58777	Sylvia	67	" No , "
58781	58900	58777	58777	Sylvia	67	" the letter was not sent to me ; it was left by my friend in her bed - room at the Pension Malfait . You see , the strange thing , Monsieur , is that Madame Wolsky left all her luggage . She took absolutely nothing with her , excepting , of course , her money . And as yet nothing has come from her , although she promised to telegraph where her luggage was to be sent on to her ! I come to you because I am afraid that she had met with some accident in the Paris streets , and I thought you would be able to telephone for us to the Paris Police . "
58922	58927	58928	58928	he	1739	" Well , Madame , "
58931	58958	58928	58928	he	1739	" I will certainly do everything I can . But I must ask you to provide me first with a few more particulars about your friend . "
58959	58977	58777	58777	Sylvia	67	" I will tell you everything I know . But I really do not know very much . "
58978	58982	58984	58985	the Commissioner	1740	" Her age ? "
58987	59003	58984	58985	the Commissioner	1740	" I do not know her age , but I suppose she is about thirty . "
59004	59011	59012	59012	Sylvia	67	" The place of her birth ? "
59017	59042	59012	59012	Sylvia	67	" What is her permanent address ? Surely you know with whom you could communicate the news of an accident having happened to her ? "
59043	59054	59055	59055	Sylvia	67	" I am afraid I do n't even know that . "
59141	59148	59149	59149	he	1740	" Malfait ? Malfait ? Malfait ? "
59180	59184	59196	59196	He	1740	" Pension Malfait . "
59207	59216	59217	59217	he	1740	" The Pension Malfait has a good reputation ! "
59225	59233	59217	59217	he	1740	" I gather from what you say , Monsieur,"—he
59241	59270	59271	59272	Count Paul	94	Count—"that Madame and her friend did not play in a serious sense at the Casino — I mean , there was no large sum of money in question ? "
59288	59291	59292	59292	she	67	" Yes , "
59295	59350	59292	59292	she	67	" my friend did play , and she played rather high . She must have had a large sum of money in her possession when she left Lacville , unless she lost it all on the last day . But I was in Paris , and so I do n't know what she did . "
59356	59367	59368	59368	he	1740	" Ah , but that alters the case very much ! "
59371	59420	59368	59368	he	1740	" I must request you to come with me to the Pension Malfait . We had better pursue our inquiries there . If this Madame Wolsky had a large sum of money in notes and gold , it becomes very important that we should know where she is . "
59497	59501	59502	59502	he	1740	" And Madame , "
59507	59526	59502	59502	he	1740	" is staying at the Villa du Lac ? It is a charming house , with historic associations . "
59622	59629	59630	59631	M. Malfait	103	" Everything is quite en règle , "
59655	59688	59650	59653	the Commissioner of Police	3590	" You see , Monsieur le Commissaire , it is quite simple . The lady left us a letter explaining why she was obliged to go away . I do not know why Madame"—he
59691	59768	59821	59821	he	143	Sylvia—"thought it necessary to go to you ? We have been perfectly open about the whole matter . We are respectable people , and have absolutely nothing to hide . Madame Wolsky 's boxes are there , in her bed - room ; I might have let the room twice over since she left , but no , I prefer to wait , hoping that the lady — the very charming lady — will come back . "
59769	59782	59784	59785	the Commissioner	1740	" By the way , where is the letter which she left ? "
59793	59802	59784	59785	the Commissioner	1740	" I should like to see that letter . "
59803	59809	59811	59812	Monsieur Malfait	143	" Where is the letter ? "
59824	59840	59821	59821	he	143	" I will ask my wife for the letter . She looks after the correspondence . "
59866	59870	59871	59871	she	135	" The letter ? "
59875	59921	59922	59922	she	135	" Mon Dieu ! I do not know where I have put it . But by this time I almost know it by heart . It was a pleasing letter , for it spoke very warmly of our establishment . But where is the letter ? "
59937	59957	59922	59922	she	135	" Ah ! I remember to whom I showed it last ! It was to that agreeable friend of Madame Wolsky"—she
59964	59967	59922	59922	she	135	" agreeable , "
59978	60039	59922	59922	she	135	" It was to that Madame Wachner I last showed it . Perhaps she put it in her pocket , and forgot to give it me back . I know she said she would like her husband to see it . Monsieur and Madame Wachner often take their meals here . I will ask them if they have the letter . "
60040	60063	60065	60066	the Commissioner	1740	" Well , at any rate , we had better open Madame Wolsky 's trunks ; that may give us some clue , "
60165	60173	60175	60177	the police official	1765	" If your friend possessed a passport , "
60183	60216	60175	60177	the police official	1765	" she has evidently taken it with her . There is nothing of any consequence at all in those boxes . We had better shut them up again , and leave them . "
60233	60241	60242	60242	He	1765	" Well , where is the letter ? "
60252	60263	60265	60266	Monsieur Malfait	143	" I will send you the letter to - morrow , "
60269	60310	60265	60266	Monsieur Malfait	143	" The truth is , we handed it to a lady who was also a friend of Madame Wolsky , and she evidently forgot to give it back to us . We will find out whether she has kept it . "
60322	60328	60315	60318	the Commissioner of Police	3590	" It is quite clear that Madame"—he
60334	60392	60393	60393	He	143	Sylvia—"knows very little of Lacville , Monsieur le Comte ! Why , people are always disappearing from Lacville ! My time would indeed be full were I to follow all those who go away in a hurry — not but what I have been only too delighted to do this for Madame and for Monsieur le Comte . "
60405	60412	60413	60413	he	143	" I am pleased to think , "
60418	60476	60413	60413	he	143	" that Madame herself is not likely to meet with any unpleasant adventure here , for the Villa du Lac is a most excellent and well - conducted house . Be assured , Madame , that I will find out in the next few hours if your friend has met with an accident in the Paris streets . "
60498	60519	60494	60495	the Count	619	" Well , we have done what you wished . But it has not had much result , has it ? "
60526	60573	60522	60522	her	67	" No , Count Paul . I am afraid I made a mistake in going to the police . The Malfaits are evidently very angry with me ! And yet — and yet , you know in England it 's the first thing that people do . "
60579	60653	60656	60656	he	94	" It is a matter of absolutely no consequence . But you see , you never quite understand , my dear friend , that Lacville is a queer place , and that here , at any rate , the hotel - keepers are rather afraid of the police . I was even glad that the Commissioner did not ask to look over your boxes , and did not exact a passport from you ! "
60659	60708	60656	60656	he	94	" But I see that you are dreadfully anxious about Madame Wolsky , and I myself will communicate with the Paris police about the matter . It is , as you say , possible , though not probable , that she met with an accident after leaving you . "
61239	61248	61231	61231	her	67	" Have you had news of Madame Wolsky ? "
61280	61294	61295	61297	the older woman	349	" If only she had come to us as she arranged to do ! "
61307	61349	61295	61297	the older woman	349	" Then , at any rate , we should know something ; she would not have concealed her plans from us entirely ; we were , if new friends , yet on such kind , intimate terms with the dear soul ! "
61457	61460	61451	61451	Sylvia	67	" friendship . "
61923	61926	61928	61928	she	67	" investment , "
62411	62418	62419	62419	he	94	" Come into the garden — , "
62441	62442	62437	62437	he	94	" Maud"—but
62474	62477	62469	62469	he	94	" Madame . "
62478	62488	62489	62489	she	67	" It 's so nice and cool up here , "
62493	62507	62508	62508	She	67	" I do n't believe it is half so cool in the garden ! "
62756	62763	62765	62766	Count Paul	94	" Something very serious has happened , "
62859	62865	62866	62866	she	67	" What is the matter ? "
62870	62878	62866	62866	she	67	" Has anything happened to your sister ? "
62879	62885	62886	62886	he	619	" Thank God — no ! "
62890	62912	62886	62886	he	619	" But something else , something which was to be expected , but which I did not expect , has happened — "
62929	62946	62926	62926	he	619	" My kind godmother , the little Marquise you met last week , died last night . "
62969	62984	62985	62985	She	67	" How dreadful ! She seemed quite well when we saw her that day — "
63004	63036	63037	63037	He	619	" Ah ! but she was very , very old — over ninety ! Why , she was supposed to be aged when she became my godmother thirty odd years ago ! "
63048	63061	63037	63037	He	619	" She has left me in her will two hundred thousand francs . "
63062	63069	63070	63070	Sylvia	67	" Oh , I am glad ! "
63096	63111	63078	63081	the Comte de Virieu	99	" Eight thousand pounds ? Does it seem a fortune to you , Madame ? "
63112	63118	63120	63120	Sylvia	67	" Of course it does ! "
63122	63141	63142	63142	he	619	" It frees me from the necessity of being a pensioner on my brother - in - law , "
63164	63173	63174	63174	she	67	" You will not play with this money ? "
63182	63205	63174	63174	she	67	" It is no use my making a promise , especially to you , that I might not be able to keep — "
63217	63240	63206	63206	He	619	" But I promise that I will not waste or risk this money if I can resist the temptation to do so . "
63259	63284	63285	63285	he	619	" Do you wish me to give you my word of honour that I will not risk any of this money at the tables ? "
63325	63331	63332	63332	he	619	" Do you exact it ? "
63343	63355	63339	63339	Sylvia	67	" Could you keep your word if I did exact it ? "
63356	63368	63369	63369	He	619	" Ah , you have learnt to know me too well ! "
63425	63432	63433	63433	he	94	" And has anything happened here ? "
63436	63446	63433	63433	he	94	" Is there any news of your vanished friend ? "
63502	63632	63493	63493	he	619	" I wish to say something to you , and I am now going to speak as frankly as if you were — my sister . You are wrong to waste a moment of your time in regretting Madame Wolsky . She is an unhappy woman , held tightly in the paws of the tiger — Play . That is the truth , my friend ! It is a pity you ever met her , and I am glad she went away without doing you any further mischief . It was bad enough of her to have brought you to Lacville , and taught you to gamble . Had she stayed on , she would have tried in time to make you go on with her to Monte Carlo . "
63667	63689	63658	63658	She	67	" Tell me , did you ask Madame Wolsky to go away ? Please do n't mind my asking you this ? "
63690	63699	63700	63700	he	1860	" I ask Madame Wolsky to go away ? "
63706	63785	63786	63786	he	1860	" Such a thought never even crossed my mind . It would have been very impertinent — what English people would call ' cheeky'—of me to do such a thing ! You must indeed think me a hypocrite ! Have I not shared your surprise and concern at her extraordinary disappearance ? And her luggage ? If I had wished her to go away , I should not have encouraged her to leave all her luggage behind her ! "
63849	63875	63842	63844	the older woman	349	" I should not be surprised if that Count de Virieu persuaded your friend to go away . He wants the field clear for himself . "
63912	63924	63925	63925	she	67	" Of course , I do n't think you a hypocrite , "
63929	63974	63925	63925	she	67	" but you never did like poor Anna , and you were always telling me that Lacville is n't a place where a nice woman ought to stay long . I thought you might have said something of the same kind to Madame Wolsky . "
63975	63982	63983	63984	Count Paul	94	" And do you really suppose , "
63996	64026	64027	64027	he	94	" that your friend would have taken my advice ? Do you think that Madame Wolsky would look either to the right or the left when the Goddess of Chance beckoned?"—and
64040	64055	64056	64056	Sylvia	67	" But the Goddess of Chance did not beckon to her to leave Lacville ! "
64059	64074	64056	64056	Sylvia	67	" Why , she meant to stay on here till the middle of September — "
64075	64084	64085	64085	Count	94	" You asked me a very indiscreet question just now"—the
64154	64158	64159	64159	she	67	" Did I ? "
64163	64249	64159	64159	she	67	" Yes ! You asked me if I had persuaded Madame Wolsky to leave Lacville . Well , now I ask you , in my turn , whether it has ever occurred to you that the Wachners know more of your Polish friend 's departure than they admit ? I gathered that impression the only time I talked to your Madame Wachner about the matter . I felt sure she knew more than she would say ! Of course , it was only an impression . "
64253	64268	64269	64269	she	67	" At first Madame Wachner seemed annoyed that I made a fuss about it , "
64273	64358	64269	64269	she	67	" But later she seemed as surprised and sorry as I am myself . Oh , no , Count , I am sure you are wrong — why you forget that Madame Wachner walked up to the Pension Malfait that same evening — I mean the evening of the day Anna left Lacville . In fact , it was Madame Wachner who first found out that Anna had not come home . She went up to her bed - room to look for her . "
64359	64370	64372	64373	the Count	619	" Then it was Madame Wachner who found the letter ? "
64376	64477	64372	64373	the Count	619	" Oh , no , it was not Madame Wachner who found it . Anna 's letter was discovered the next morning by the chambermaid in a blotting - book on the writing table . No one had thought of looking there . You see they were all expecting her back that night . Madame Malfait still thinks that poor Anna went to the Casino in the afternoon , and after having lost her money came back to the pension , wrote the letter , and then went out and left for Paris without saying anything about it to anyone ! "
64478	64488	64490	64493	the Comte de Virieu	99	" I suppose something of that sort did happen , "
64496	64500	64501	64501	he	99	" And now , "
64510	64524	64501	64501	he	99	" I think I will take a turn at the Casino after all ! "
64549	64557	64558	64558	he	99	" You see what I am like , "
64568	64582	64558	64558	he	99	" I wish you had made me give you my word of honour . "
64636	64659	64631	64631	Sylvia	67	" I think I shall go and have tea with the Wachners . They never go to the Casino on Saturday afternoons . "
64670	64686	64687	64687	he	99	" I ca n't think what you see to like in that vulgar old couple , "
64691	64696	64687	64687	he	99	" To me there is something"—he
64711	64712	64687	64687	he	99	" louche"—"sinister
64733	64734	64730	64731	the Wachners	114	" "
64737	64744	64730	64731	the Wachners	114	" echoed Sylvia , really surprised . "
64775	64776	64767	64767	they	114	" "
64782	64786	64779	64779	you	0	" he said . "
64813	64823	64808	64808	he	99	" Sylvia looked pained , nay more , shocked . "
64839	64844	64833	64833	they	1874	" she said slowly . "
64859	64865	64850	64850	you	0	" the Count protested lightly . "
64888	64896	64897	64898	Old Dutch	148	his"—he hesitated , then ended his sentence with "
64900	64907	64897	64898	Old Dutch	148	" Sylvia could not help smiling . "
64915	64919	64897	64898	Old Dutch	148	" she exclaimed , "
64944	64957	64958	64958	I	0	" Somehow they were friends again . His next words proved it . "
64990	65042	64981	64981	I	0	" And he was even better than his word , for he went on with Sylvia till they were actually within sight of the little , isolated villa where the Wachners lived . There , woman - like , she made an effort to persuade him to go in with her . "
65046	65051	65052	65053	Madame Wachner	67	" she said urgently . "
65074	65083	65059	65059	She	67	" But Count Paul smilingly shook his head . "
65093	65098	65084	65084	I	0	" he said deliberately . "
65111	65121	65107	65107	I	0	hope"—he looked again straight into Sylvia Bailey 's ingenuous blue eyes—"that
65133	65134	65122	65123	the Wachners	114	" "
65137	65144	65122	65123	the Wachners	114	" she cried , blushing violently . "
65164	65165	65166	65166	It	1880	" "
65206	65235	65203	65203	my	0	" She looked at him to see if he was sincere . His face was very grave ; and she looked at him with perplexed , unhappy eyes . "
65243	65247	65203	65203	my	0	" she said . "
65257	65271	65250	65250	you	0	" But the Comte de Virieu was both vexed and angry with himself . "
65284	65288	65250	65250	you	0	" he muttered . "
65400	65440	65393	65393	I	0	" And then , with one of his sudden , stiff bows , the Comte de Virieu turned on his heel , leaving Sylvia to make her way alone to the little wooden gate on which were painted the words "
65445	65629	65393	65393	I	0	" Sylvia pushed open the little white gate of the Châlet des Muguets and began walking up the path which lay through the neglected , untidy garden . To eyes accustomed to the exquisitely - kept gardens of an English country town , there was something almost offensive in the sight presented by the high , coarse grass and luxuriant unkemptness of the place , and once more Sylvia wondered how the Wachners could bear to leave the land surrounding their temporary home in such a state . But the quaint , fantastic - looking , one - storeyed châlet amused and rather interested her , for it was so entirely unlike any other dwelling with which she was acquainted . To - day a deep , hot calm brooded over the silent house and deserted - looking garden ; the chocolate - coloured shutters of the dining - room and the drawing - room were closed , and Sylvia told herself that it would be delightful to pass from the steamy heat outside into the dimly - lighted , sparsely - furnished little "
65632	65866	65393	65393	I	0	" there to have a cup of tea and a pleasant chat with her friends before accompanying them in the cool of the early evening to the Casino . Sylvia always enjoyed talking to Madame Wachner . She was a little bit ashamed that this was so , for this cosmopolitan woman 's conversation was not always quite refined , but she was good - natured and lively , and her talk was invariably amusing . Above all , she knew how to flatter , and after a chat with Madame Wachner Sylvia Bailey always felt pleased both with herself and with the world about her . There was very little concerning the young Englishwoman 's simple , uneventful life with which Madame Wachner was not by now acquainted . She was aware for instance , that Sylvia had no close relations of her own , and that , like Anna Wolsky , Mrs. Bailey knew nobody — she had not even an acquaintance — living in Paris . This fact had enlisted to a special degree Madame Wachner 's interest and liking for the two young widows . Sylvia rang the primitive bell which hung by the door which alone gave access , apart from the windows , to the Châlet des Muguets . After some moments the day - servant employed by Madame Wachner opened the door with the curt words , "
65874	65885	65886	65886	They	1886	" The woman added , in a rather insolent tone , "
65894	65902	65886	65886	They	1886	" and her manner said plainly enough , "
65931	66061	66062	66062	I	0	" Sylvia felt vexed and disappointed . After what had been to her a very exciting , agitating conversation with Count Paul , she had unconsciously longed for the cheerful , commonplace talk of Madame Wachner . As she stood there in the bright sunlight the thought of the long , lonely , hot walk back to the Villa du Lac became odious to her . Why should she not go into the house and rest awhile ? The more so that the Wachners would almost certainly return home very soon . They disliked Paris , and never stayed more than a couple of hours on their occasional visits there . In her careful , rather precise French , she told the servant she would come in and wait . "
66075	66105	66066	66067	Madame Wachner	67	" she said , smiling ; and after a rather ungracious pause the woman admitted her into the house , leading the way into the darkened dining - room . "
66119	66125	66107	66107	you	67	" asked Sylvia . The woman hesitated—"I
66132	66136	66107	66107	you	67	" she mumbled . "
66158	66183	66152	66152	They	1892	" She bustled out of the room for a few moments and then came back , holding a big cotton parasol in her hand . "
66228	66229	66219	66219	she	67	" "
66259	66281	66251	66252	Madame Wachner	67	" Sylvia spoke shortly . She did not like the day - servant 's independent , almost rude way of speaking . "
66323	66372	66315	66316	Madame Wachner	67	" The woman spoke quickly , her eyes fixed expectantly on the lady sitting before her . Mrs. Bailey suddenly realised , or thought she realised , what that look meant . She took her purse out of her pocket and held out a two - franc piece . "
66375	66380	66315	66316	Madame Wachner	67	" she answered coldly , "
66396	66417	66385	66386	Madame Wachner	67	" The woman 's manner altered ; it became at once familiar and servile . After profusely thanking Sylvia for her "
66420	66441	66385	66386	Madame Wachner	67	" she laid the cotton parasol on the dining - table , put her arms akimbo , and suddenly asked , "
66458	66459	66454	66456	the Polish lady	228	" "
66462	66468	66454	66456	the Polish lady	228	" Sylvia looked up surprised . "
66493	66512	66513	66514	The lady	490	" She was astonished that the Wachners should have mentioned the matter to this disagreeable , inquisitive person . "
66531	66532	66524	66524	She	490	" "
66542	66547	66537	66537	you	1907	" said Sylvia quickly . "
66579	66580	66574	66574	she	73	" "
66622	66623	66612	66612	she	490	" "
66641	66647	66624	66624	I	0	" said Mrs. Bailey quickly . "
66681	66719	66675	66675	She	490	" The servant looked at her fixedly , and Sylvia 's face became what it seldom was — very forbidding in expression . She wished this meddling , familiar woman would go away and leave her alone . "
66740	66760	66734	66734	I	0	" The Frenchwoman took up her parasol and laid the house key on the table , then , with a "
66771	67206	66734	66734	I	0	" she noisily closed the door behind her . A moment later , Sylvia , with a sense of relief , found herself in sole possession of the Châlet des Muguets . Even the quietest , the most commonplace house has , as it were , an individuality that sets it apart from other houses . And even those who would deny that proposition must admit that every inhabited dwelling has its own special nationality . The Châlet des Muguets was typically French and typically suburban ; but where it differed from thousands of houses of the same type , dotted round in the countrysides within easy reach of Paris , was that it was let each year to a different set of tenants . In Sylvia Bailey 's eyes the queer little place lacked all the elements which go to make a home ; and , sitting there , in that airless , darkened dining - room , she wondered , not for the first time , why the Wachners chose to live in such a comfortless way . She glanced round her with distaste . Everything was not only cheap , but common and tawdry . Still , the dining - room , like all the other rooms in the châlet , was singularly clean , and almost oppressively neat . There was the round table at which she and Anna Wolsky had been so kindly entertained , the ugly buffet or sideboard , and in place of the dull parquet floor she remembered on her first visit lay an ugly piece of linoleum , of which the pattern printed on the surface simulated a red and blue marble pavement . Once more the change puzzled her , perhaps unreasonably . At last Sylvia got up from the hard cane chair on which she had been sitting . There had come over her , in the half - darkness , a very peculiar sensation — an odd feeling that there was something alive in the room . She looked down , half expecting to see some small animal crouching under the table , or hiding by the walnut - wood buffet behind her . But , no ; nothing but the round table , and the six chairs stiffly placed against the wall , met her eyes . And yet , still that feeling that there was in the room some sentient creature besides herself persisted . She opened the door giving into the hall , and walked through the short passage which divided the house into two portions , into the tiny "
67209	68110	66734	66734	I	0	" Here also the closed shutters gave the room a curious , eerie look of desolate greyness . But Sylvia 's eyes , already accustomed to the half - darkness next door , saw everything perfectly . The little sitting - room looked mean and shabby . There was not a flower , not even a book or a paper , to relieve its prim ugliness . The only ornaments were a gilt clock on the mantelpiece , flanked with two sham Empire candelabra . The shutters were fastened closely , and the room was dreadfully hot and airless . Once more Sylvia wondered why the Wachners preferred to live in this cheerless way , with a servant who only came for a few hours each day , rather than at an hotel or boarding - house . And then she reminded herself that , after all , the silent , gaunt man , and his talkative , voluble wife , seemed to be on exceptionally good terms the one with the other . Perhaps they really preferred being alone together than in a more peopled atmosphere . While moving aimlessly about the room , Sylvia began to feel unaccountably nervous and oppressed . She longed to be away from this still , empty house , and yet it seemed absurd to leave just as the Wachners would be returning home . After a few more minutes , however , the quietude , and the having absolutely nothing to do with which to wile away the time , affected Sylvia 's nerves . It was , after all , quite possible that the Wachners intended to wait in Paris till the heat of the day was over . In that case they would not be back till seven o'clock . The best thing she could do would be to leave a note inviting Madame Wachner and L'Ami Fritz to dinner at the Villa du Lac . Count Paul was to be in Paris this evening , so his eyes would not be offended by the sight of the people of whom he so disapproved . Madame Wachner would probably be glad to dine out , the more so that no proper meal seemed to have been prepared by that unpleasant day - servant . Why , the woman had not even laid the cloth for her employers ' supper ! Sylvia looked instinctively round for paper and envelopes , but there was no writing - table , not even a pencil and paper , in the little drawing - room . How absurd and annoying ! But , stay — somewhere in the house there must be writing materials . Treading softly , and yet hearing her footsteps echoing with unpleasant loudness through the empty house , Sylvia Bailey walked past the open door of the little kitchen , and so to the end of the passage . Then something extraordinary happened . While in the act of opening the door of Madame Wachner 's bed - room , the young Englishwoman stopped and caught her breath . Again she had suddenly experienced that unpleasant , eerie sensation — the sensation that she was not alone . But this time the feeling was far more vivid than it had been in the dining - room . So strong , so definite was Sylvia 's perception of another presence , and this time of a human presence , in the still house , that she turned sharply round — But all she saw was the empty passage , cut by a shaft of light thrown from the open door of the kitchen , stretching its short length down to the entrance hall . Making a determined effort over what she could but suppose to be her nerves , she walked through into the Wachners ' bed - room . It was very bare and singularly poorly furnished , at least to English eyes , but it was pleasantly cool after the drawing - room . She walked across to the window , and , drawing aside the muslin curtains , looked out . Beyond the patch of shade thrown by the house the sun beat down on a ragged , unkempt lawn , but across the lawn she noticed , much more particularly than she had done on the two former occasions when she had been in the house , that there lay a thick grove of chestnut trees just beyond the grounds of the Châlet des Muguets . A hedge separated the lawn from the wood , but like everything else in the little property it had been neglected , and there were large gaps in it . She turned away from the window — Yes , there , at last , was what she had come into this room to seek ! Close to the broad , low bed was a writing - table , or , rather , a deal table , covered with a turkey red cloth , on which lay a large sheet of ink - stained , white blotting - paper . Flanking the blotting - paper was a pile of Monsieur Wachner 's little red books — the books in which he so carefully noted the turns of the game at the Casino , and which served him as the basis of his elaborate gambling "
68113	68660	66734	66734	I	0	" Sylvia went up to the writing - table , and , bending over it , began looking for some notepaper . But there was nothing of the sort to be seen ; neither paper nor envelopes lay on the table . This was the more absurd , as there were several pens , and an inkpot filled to the brim . She told herself that the only thing to do was to tear a blank leaf out of one of L'Ami Fritz 's note - books , and on it write her message of invitation . If she left the little sheet of paper propped up on the dining - table , the Wachners would be sure to see it . She took up the newest - looking of the red note - books , and as she opened it she suddenly felt , and for the third time , that there was a living presence close to her — and this time that it was that of Anna Wolsky ! It was an extraordinary sensation — vivid , uncanny , terrifying — the more so that Sylvia Bailey not only believed herself to be alone in the house , but supposed Anna to be far from Lacville .... Fortunately , this unnerving and terrifying impression of an unseen and yet real presence did not endure ; and , as she focussed her eyes on the open book she held in her hand , it became fainter and fainter , while she realised , with a keen sense of relief , what it was that had brought the presence of her absent friend so very near to her . There , actually lying open before her , between two leaves of the little note - book , was a letter signed by Anna Wolsky ! It was a short note , in French , apparently an answer to one Madame Wachner had sent reminding her of her engagement . It was odd that the Wachners had said nothing of this note , for it made Anna 's conduct seem stranger than ever . Opposite the page on which lay the little letter , Monsieur Wachner had amused himself by trying to imitate Anna 's angular handwriting . Sylvia tore out one of the blank pages , and then she put the note - book and its enclosure back on the table . She felt vaguely touched by the fact that the Wachners had kept her friend 's last letter ; they alone , so she reminded herself , had been really sorry and concerned at Anna 's sudden departure from the place . They also , like Sylvia herself , had been pained that Madame Wolsky had not cared to say good - bye to them . She scribbled a few lines on the scrap of paper , and then , quickly making her way to the dining - room , she placed her unconventional invitation on the round table , and went out into the hall . As she opened the front door of the Châlet des Muguets Sylvia was met by a blast of hot air . She looked out dubiously . She was thoroughly unnerved — as she expressed it to herself , "
68663	69618	69619	69620	The Gambler	430	" Feeling as she now felt , walking back through the heat would be intolerable . For the first time Lacville became utterly distasteful to Sylvia Bailey . She asked herself , with a kind of surprise , of self - rebuke , why she was there — away from her own country and her own people ? With a choking sensation in her throat she told herself that it would be very comfortable to see once more the tall , broad figure of Bill Chester , and to hear his good , gruff English voice again . She stepped out of the house , and put up her white parasol . It was still dreadfully hot , but to the left , across the lawn , lay the cool depths of the chestnut wood . Why not go over there and rest in the shade ? Hurrying across the scorched grass to the place where there was an opening in the rough hedge , she found herself , a moment later , plunged in the grateful green twilight created by high trees . It was delightfully quiet and still in the wood , and Sylvia wondered vaguely why the Wachners never took their tea out there . But foreigners are very law - abiding , or so she supposed , and the wood , if a piece of no - man 's land , was for sale . Up a path she could see the back of a large board . It was clear that this pretty bit of woodland would have been turned into villa plots long ago had it been nearer to a road . But it was still a stretch of primeval forest . Here and there , amid the tufts of grass , lay the husks of last autumn 's chestnuts . Sylvia slowly followed the little zigzag way which cut across the wood , and then , desiring to sit down for awhile , she struck off to the right , towards a spot where she saw that the brambles and the undergrowth had been cleared away . Even here , where in summer the sun never penetrated , the tufts of coarse grass were dried up by the heat . She glanced down ; no , there was no fear that the hard , dry ground would stain her pretty cotton frock . And then , as she sat there , Sylvia gradually became aware that close to her , where the undergrowth began again , the earth had recently been disturbed . Over an irregular patch of about a yard square the sods had been dug up , and then planted again . The thought passed through her mind that children must have been playing there , and that they had made a rude attempt to destroy their handiwork , or rather to prevent its being noticed , by placing the branch of a tree across the little plot of ground where the earth had been disturbed . It was this broken branch , of which the leaves had shrivelled up , that had first drawn her attention to the fact that someone must have been there , and recently . Her thoughts wandered off to Bill Chester . He was now actually journeying towards her as fast as boat and train could bring him ; in a couple of hours he would be in Paris , and then , perhaps , he would come out to Lacville in time for dinner . Sylvia had not been able to get a room for him in the Villa du Lac , but she had engaged one in the Pension Malfait — where she had been able to secure the apartment which had been occupied by Anna Wolsky , whose things had only just been moved out of it . She could not help being sorry that Bill would see Lacville for the first time on a Sunday . She feared that , to his English eyes , the place , especially on that day , would present a peculiarly — well , disreputable appearance ! Sylvia felt jealous for the good fame of Lacville . Out in the open air her spirits had recovered their balance ; she told herself that she had been very happy here — singularly , extraordinarily happy .... Of course it was a pity when people lost more money than they could afford at the Casino ; but even in England people betted — the poor , so she had been told , risked all their spare pence on horse racing , and the others , those who could afford it , went to Monte Carlo , or stayed at home and played bridge ! After all , where was the difference ? But , of course , Bill Chester , with his tiresome , old - fashioned views of life , would think there was a great difference ; he would certainly disapprove of the way she was now spending her money .... Something told her , and the thought was not wholly unpleasing to her , that Bill Chester and the Comte de Virieu would not get on well together . She wondered if Count Paul had ever been jealous — if he were capable of jealousy ? It would be rather interesting to see if anything or anyone could make him so ! And then her mind travelled on , far , far away , to a picture with which she had been familiar from her girlhood , for it hung in the drawing - room of one of her father 's friends at Market Dalling . It was called "
69624	69750	69751	69751	Madame	2550	" She had always thought it a very pretty and pathetic picture ; but she no longer thought it so ; in fact , it now appeared to her to be a ridiculous travesty of life . Gamblers were just like other people , neither better nor worse — and often infinitely more lovable than were some other people .... At last Sylvia got up , and slowly made her way out of the wood . She did not go back through the Wachners ' garden ; instead , she struck off to the left , on to a field path , which finally brought her to the main road . As she was passing the Pension Malfait the landlady came out to the gate . "
69753	69759	69751	69751	Madame	2550	" she cried out loudly , "
69796	69854	69778	69778	her	73	" Sylvia felt very glad — glad , and yet once more , perhaps unreasonably , hurt . Then Anna had been in Paris all the time ? How odd , how really unkind of her not to have written and relieved the anxiety which she must have known her English friend would be feeling about her ! "
69869	70041	69865	69867	the English gentleman	1918	" went on Madame Malfait amiably . She was pleased that Mrs. Bailey was giving her a new guest , and it also amused her to observe what prudes Englishwomen could be . Fancy putting a man who had come all the way from England to see one , in a pension situated at the other end of the town to where one was living oneself ! William Chester , solicitor , and respected citizen of Market Dalling , felt rather taken aback and bewildered as he joined the great stream of people who were pouring out of the large suburban station of Lacville . He had only arrived in Paris two hours before , and after a hasty dinner at the Gare du Nord he had made inquiries as to his best way of reaching Lacville . And then he was told , to his surprise , that from the very station in which he found himself trains started every few minutes to the spot for which he was bound . "
70046	70056	69865	69867	the English gentleman	1918	" added the man of whom he had inquired , "
70071	70219	69778	69778	her	73	" Chester had imagined Sylvia to be staying in a quiet village or little country town . That was the impression her brief letters to him had conveyed , and he was astonished to hear that Lacville maintained so large and constant a train service . Sylvia had written that she would engage a room for him at the boarding - house where she was staying ; and Chester , who was very tired after his long , hot journey , looked forward to a pleasant little chat with her , followed by a good night 's rest . It was nine o'clock when he got into the Lacville train , and again he was vaguely surprised to see what a large number of people were bound for the place . It was clear that something special must be going on there to - night , and that "
70225	70270	70564	70565	Madame Bailey	67	" must be on a very splendid scale . When he arrived at Lacville , he joined the great throng of people , who were laughing and talking , each and all in holiday mood , and hailed an open carriage outside the station . "
70277	70441	70564	70565	Madame Bailey	67	" he cried . The cab could only move slowly through the crowd of walkers , and when it finally emerged out of the narrow streets of the town it stopped a moment , as if the driver wished his English fare to gaze at the beautiful panorama spread out before his eyes . Dotted over the lake , large and mysterious in the starlit night , floated innumerable tiny crafts , each gaily hung with a string of coloured lanterns . Now and again a red and blue rocket streamed up with a hiss , dissolving in a shower of stars reflected in the still water . Down to the right a huge building , with towers and minarets flung up against the sky , was outlined in twinkling lights . The cab moved on , only for a few yards however , and then drove quickly through high gates , and stopped with a jerk in front of a stone staircase . "
70448	70455	70564	70565	Madame Bailey	67	" said Chester incredulously to himself . "
70470	70471	70564	70565	Madame Bailey	67	" "
70476	70486	70564	70565	Madame Bailey	67	" he asked interrogatively , and the cabman said , "
70491	70523	70564	70565	Madame Bailey	67	" The Englishman got out of the cab , and ascending the stone steps , rang the bell . The door opened , and a neat young woman stood before him . "
70532	70563	70564	70565	Madame Bailey	67	" he said in his slow , hesitating French . There came a torrent of words , of smiles and nods — it seemed to Chester of excuses — in which "
70566	70577	70578	70578	I	0	" frequently occurred . He shook his head , helplessly . "
70584	70645	70578	70578	I	0	" The maid turned away ; and Chester , with an agreeable feeling of relief that at last his journey was ended , took his bag off the cab , and dismissed the man . What a delightful , spacious house ! Sylvia had not been so very foolish after all . M. Polperro came forward , bowing and smiling . "
70656	70664	70648	70651	the gentleman Madame Bailey	1926	" he said , rubbing his hands . "
70707	70708	70694	70694	she	67	" "
70719	70727	70713	70714	Mrs. Bailey	71	" asked Chester , surprised and disappointed . "
70767	70791	70753	70753	M'sieur	151	" Chester had not much sense of humour , but he could not help smiling to himself at the other 's pompous words . "
70809	70813	70793	70793	you	151	" he said , "
70826	70957	70816	70816	I	0	" M. Polperro burst into a torrent of agitated apologies . There was alas ! no room for Madame Bailey 's friend — in fact the Villa du Lac was so extraordinarily prosperous that there never was a room there from May till October , unless one of the guests left unexpectedly ! But Mr. Chester — was not that his name?—must not be cast down , for Mrs. Bailey had secured a beautiful room for him in another pension , a very inferior pension to the Villa du Lac , but still one in which he would be comfortable . Chester now felt annoyed , and showed it . The thought of turning out again was not a pleasant one . But what was this funny little Frenchman saying ? "
71003	71045	71046	71046	You	0	" And he went on to tell Chester , who was getting bewildered with the quick , eager talk , that this special dinner had been served at eight o'clock , and that Madame Bailey had entertained two friends that evening . "
71056	71057	71046	71046	You	0	" "
71063	71122	71061	71061	M'sieur	151	" It had never occurred to Chester that there would be a Casino in the place where Sylvia was spending the summer . But then everything at Lacville , including the Villa du Lac , was utterly unlike what the English lawyer had expected it to be . M. Polperro spread out his hands with an eloquent gesture . "
71128	71132	71123	71123	I	0	" he said , "
71176	71300	71123	71123	I	0	" Strange — very strange ! At home in Market Dalling Sylvia had always been fond of going to bed quite early ; yet now , according to the hotel - keeper , she was perhaps going to stay out till one o'clock — till one o'clock on Sunday morning ! M. Polperro led Chester into the stately , long drawing - room ; but in a very few moments he reappeared , having taken off his white apron and his chef 's cap , and put on a light grey alpaca coat and a soft hat . As they hurried along the path which skirts the lake , Chester began to feel the charm of the place . It was very gay and delightful—"very
71303	71339	71123	71123	I	0	" so the English lawyer told himself . The lake , too , looked beautiful — mysteriously beautiful and fairy - like , in the moonlight . Soon they turned into a narrow dark lane . "
71351	71358	71123	71123	I	0	" said M. Polperro , ruefully , "
71371	71393	71394	71394	I	0	" and he chuckled happily . When in front of the great glass doors , he touched Chester on the arm . "
71408	71416	71417	71417	I	0	" he said in a low voice . "
71470	71508	71456	71456	I	0	" The Playing Rooms ? Sylvia a member of a club ? And — for Chester 's quick , legal mind had leapt on the fact — of a gambling club ? No , that was incredible . "
71517	71522	71509	71509	I	0	" he said distantly . "
71537	71545	71551	71551	she	71	" M. Polperro looked very much surprised . "
71554	71559	71551	71551	she	71	" he answered confidently . "
71589	71595	71586	71586	M'sieur	151	" he shrugged his shoulders . "
71609	71642	71596	71596	I	0	" Without answering , Chester paid the couple of francs admission for himself and his companion , and they walked slowly through the lower rooms , threading their way through the crowd . "
71659	71660	71652	71653	Madame Bailey	67	" "
71671	71964	71968	71968	M'sieur	151	" said Chester , impatiently . He was beginning , or so he thought , to understand . The Club was evidently a quiet , select part of the Casino , with a reading room and so on . Sylvia had probably made friends with some French people in her hotel , and they had persuaded her to join the Club . He was beginning to throw off his tiredness ; the unaccustomed atmosphere in which he found himself amused and interested , even if it rather shocked him . Ten minutes later he also , thanks to the kind offices of M. Polperro , and by the payment of twenty francs , found himself a member of the Club ; free of that inner sanctuary where the devotees of the fickle goddess play with gold instead of silver ; and where , as even Chester could see , the people who stood round the table , risking with quiet , calculating eyes their twenty - franc pieces and bank - notes , were of a very different social standing from the merry , careless crowd downstairs . In the Baccarat Room most of the men were in evening clothes , and the women with them , if to Chester 's eyes by no means desirable or reputable - looking companions , were young , pretty , and beautifully dressed . Still , the English lawyer felt a thrill of disgust at the thought that Sylvia Bailey could possibly be part of such a company . Baccarat was being played at both tables , but the crowd of players centred rather round one than the other , as is almost always the way . M. Polperro touched his companion on the arm . "
71970	71975	71976	71976	I	0	" he said briefly , "
71996	72630	71989	71990	Madame Bailey	67	" Chester shook the owner of the Villa du Lac cordially by the hand . The little man had been really kind and helpful . It was a pity there was no vacant room in his hotel . He made his way to the further table , and gradually reached a point of vantage where he could see those of the players who were seated round the green cloth . As is generally the case when really high play is going on , the people who were playing , as also those watching them , were curiously quiet . And then , with a shock of surprise which sent the blood to his cheeks , Chester suddenly saw that Sylvia Bailey was sitting nearly opposite to where he himself was standing . There are certain scenes , certain human groupings of individuals , which remain fixed for ever against the screen of memory . Bill Chester will never forget the sight which was presented to him in the Lacville Casino by the particular group on which his tired eyes became focussed with growing amazement and attention . Sylvia was sitting at the baccarat table next to the man who was acting as Banker . She was evidently absorbed in the fortunes of the game , and she followed the slow falling of the fateful cards with rather feverish intentness . Her small gloved hands rested on the table , one of them loosely holding a tiny ivory rake ; and on a bank - note spread open on the green cloth before her were two neat piles of gold , the one composed of twenty - franc , the other of ten - franc pieces . Chester , with a strange feeling of fear and anger clutching at his heart , told himself that he had never seen Sylvia look as she looked to - night . She was more than pretty — she was lovely , and above all , alive — vividly alive . There was a bright colour on her cheek , and a soft light shining in her eyes . The row of pearls which had occasioned the only serious difference which had ever arisen between them , rose and fell softly on the bosom of her black lace dress . Chester also gradually became aware that his beautiful friend and client formed a centre of attraction to those standing round the gambling - table . Both the men and the women stared at her , some enviously , but more with kindly admiration , for beauty is sure of its tribute in any French audience , and Sylvia Bailey to - night looked radiantly lovely — lovely and yet surely unhappy and ill - at - ease . Well might she look both in such a place and among such a crew ! So the English lawyer angrily told himself . Now and again she turned and spoke in an eager , intimate fashion to a man sitting next her on her left . This man , oddly enough , was not playing . Sylvia Bailey 's companion was obviously a Frenchman , or so Chester felt sure , for now he found himself concentrating his attention on Mrs. Bailey 's neighbour rather than on her . This man , to whom she kept turning and speaking in a low , earnest tone , was slim and fair , and what could be seen of his evening clothes fitted scrupulously well . The Englishman , looking at him with alien , jealous eyes , decided within himself that the Frenchman with whom Sylvia seemed to be on such friendly terms , was a foppish - looking fellow , not at all the sort of man she ought to have "
72633	73162	71984	71984	I	0	" on her travels . Suddenly Sylvia raised her head , throwing it back with a graceful gesture , and Chester 's eyes travelled on to the person who was standing just behind her , and to whom she had now begun speaking with smiling animation . This was a woman — short , stout , and swarthy — dressed in a bright purple gown , and wearing a pale blue bonnet which was singularly unbecoming to her red , massive face . Chester rather wondered that such an odd , and yes — such a respectable - looking person could be a member of this gambling club . She reminded him of the stout old housekeeper in a big English country house near Market Dalling . Sylvia seemed also to include in her talk a man who was standing next the fat woman . He was tall and lanky , absurdly and unsuitably dressed , to the English onlooker , in a white alpaca suit and a shabby Panama hat . In his hand he held a little book , in which he noted down every turn of the game , and it was clear to Chester that , though he listened to Mrs. Bailey with civility , he was quite uninterested in what she was saying . Very different was the attitude of the woman ; she seemed absorbed in Sylvia 's remarks , and she leant forward familiarly , throwing all her weight on the back of the chair on which Mrs. Bailey was sitting . Sometimes as she spoke she smiled in a way that showed her large , strong teeth . Chester thought them both odd , common - looking people . He was surprised that Sylvia knew them — nay more , that she seemed on such friendly terms with them ; and he noticed that the Frenchman sitting next to her — the dandyish - looking fellow to whom she had been talking just now — took no part at all in her present conversation . Once , indeed , he looked up and frowned , as if the chatter going on between Mrs. Bailey and her fat friend fretted and disturbed him . Play had again begun in earnest , and Sylvia turned her attention to the table . Her neighbour whispered something which at once caused her to take up two napoleons and a ten - franc piece from the pile of gold in front of her . Very deliberately she placed the coins within the ruled - off space reserved for the stakes . Bill Chester , staring across at her , felt as if he were in a nightmare — gazing at something which was not real , and which would vanish if looked at long enough . Could that lovely young woman , who sat there , looking so much at home , with the little rake in her hand be Sylvia Bailey , the quiet young widow whose perfect propriety of conduct had always earned the praise of those matrons of Market Dalling , whom Chester 's own giddier sisters called by the irreverent name of "
73165	73385	71989	71990	Madame Bailey	67	" ? It was fortunate that none of these respectable ladies could see Sylvia now ! To those who regard gambling as justifiable , provided the gambler 's means allow of it , even to those who habitually see women indulging in games of chance , there will , of course , be something absurd in the point of view of the solicitor . But to such a man as Bill Chester , the sight of the woman for whom he had always felt a very sincere respect , as well as a far more enduring and jealous affection than he quite realised , sitting there at a public gaming table , was a staggering — nay , a disgusting — spectacle . He reminded himself angrily that Sylvia had a good income — so good an income that she very seldom spent it all in the course of any one year . Why , therefore , should she wish to increase it ? Above all , how could she bear to mingle with this queer , horrid crowd ? Why should she allow herself to be contaminated by breathing the same air as some of the women who were there round her ? She and the stout , middle - aged person standing behind her were probably the only "
73387	73588	71984	71984	I	0	" women in the Club . And then , it was all so deliberate ! Chester had once seen a man whom he greatly respected drunk , and the sight had ever remained with him . But , after all , a man may get drunk by accident — nay , it may almost be said that a man always gets drunk by accident . But , in this matter of risking her money at the baccarat table , Sylvia Bailey knew very well what she was about . With a thrill of genuine distress the lawyer asked himself whether she had not , in very truth , already become a confirmed gambler . It was with an assured , familiar gesture that Sylvia placed her money on the green cloth , and then with what intelligent knowledge she followed the operations of the Banker ! He watched her when her fifty francs were swept away , and noted the calm manner with which she immediately took five louis from her pile , and pushed them , with her little rake , well on to the table . But before the dealer of the cards had spoken the fateful words : "
73599	73797	73798	73798	Bill	79	" Mrs. Bailey uttered an exclamation under her breath , and hurriedly rose from her chair . She had suddenly seen Chester — seen his eyes fixed on her with a perplexed , angry look in them , and the look had made her wince . Forgetting that she still had a stake on the green cloth , she turned away from the table and began making her way round the edge of the circle . For a moment Chester lost sight of her — there were so many people round the table . He went on staring , hardly knowing what he was doing , at the four pounds she had left on the green cloth . The cards were quickly dealt , and the fateful , to Chester the incomprehensible , words were quickly uttered . Chester saw that Sylvia , unknowing of the fact , had won — that five louis were added to her original stake . The fair - haired Frenchman in evening dress by whom Mrs. Bailey had been sitting looked round ; not seeing her , he himself swept up the stake and slipped the ten louis into his pocket . "
73836	73892	73825	73825	you	79	" The bright colour , which was one of Sylvia 's chief physical attributes , had faded from her cheeks . She looked pale , and her heart was beating uncomfortably . She would have given almost anything in the world for Bill Chester not to have come down to the Club and caught her like this—"caught
73893	73903	73904	73904	I	0	" was the expression poor Sylvia used to herself . "
73909	73916	73825	73825	you	79	" she went on , breathlessly , "
73990	74062	73988	73988	Bill	79	" Chester said nothing . He was still looking at her , trying to readjust his old ideas and ideals of Sylvia Bailey to her present environment . Sylvia suddenly grew very red . After all , Bill Chester was not her keeper ! He had no right to look as angry , as — as disgusted as he was now doing . Then there came to both a welcome diversion . "
74076	74161	74068	74068	you	155	" Madame Wachner had elbowed her way through the crowd to where Chester and Mrs. Bailey were standing . Her husband lagged a little way behind , his eyes still following the play . Indeed , even as his wife spoke L'Ami Fritz made a note in the little book he held in his hand . When in the Baccarat Room he was absolutely absorbed in the play going on . Nothing could really distract him from it . Sylvia felt and looked relieved . "
74166	74170	74164	74164	Bill	79	" she exclaimed , "
74192	74193	74179	74179	She	67	" "
74212	74242	74203	74203	We	1966	" Chester bowed . She had a pleasant voice , this friend of Sylvia 's , and she spoke English well , even if she did drop her aitches ! "
74247	74258	74203	74203	We	1966	late"—Chester turned to Sylvia , but he spoke quite pleasantly . "
74271	74337	74267	74267	you	79	" Sylvia was addressing the woman she had just introduced to Chester , but her eyes were wandering towards the gambling table . Perhaps she had suddenly remembered her five louis . Chester smiled a little grimly to himself . He wondered if Sylvia would be surprised to hear that her neighbour , the fair Frenchman to whom she had been talking so familiarly , had "
74339	74346	74203	74203	We	1966	" her stakes and her winnings . "
74370	74463	74363	74363	Fritz	112	" The devoted wife spoke rather crossly . They all four turned , and slowly walked down the room . Sylvia instinctively fell behind , keeping step with Monsieur Wachner , while Chester and Madame Wachner walked in front . The latter had already taken the measure of the quiet , stolid - looking Englishman . She had seen him long before Sylvia had done so , and had watched him with some attention , guessing almost at once that he must be the man for whom Mrs. Bailey had waited dinner . "
74475	74480	74469	74469	your	112	" she observed smiling . "
74509	74526	74551	74552	Madame Wolsky	73	" She lowered her voice a little , but Chester heard her next words very clearly . "
74640	74790	74629	74629	She	71	" Chester looked kindly at Madame Wachner . It was very decent of her — really good - natured and motherly — to take such an interest in poor Sylvia and her delinquencies . Yes , that was the way to take this — this matter which so shocked him . Sylvia Bailey — lovely , wilful , spoilt Sylvia — was a very young woman , and ridiculously innocent , as this old lady truly said . He , Chester , knew that a great many nice people went to Monte Carlo , and spent sometimes a good deal more money than they could afford at the tables . It was absurd to be angry with Sylvia for doing here what very many other people did in another place . He felt sincerely grateful to this fat , vulgar looking woman for having put the case so clearly . "
74801	74806	74807	74807	I	0	" he answered awkwardly ; "
74823	74859	74814	74814	you	1978	" he looked round him with distaste . They were now downstairs , part of a merry , jostling crowd , which contained , as all such crowds naturally contain , a rather rowdy element . "
74874	74887	74872	74872	herself	71	" He was going to add something , when Sylvia walked forward . "
74893	74903	74890	74891	Count Paul	94	" she asked , anxiously , of Madame Wachner . "
74917	74925	74905	74905	he	94	" Madame Wachner shook her head slightly . "
74933	74965	74966	74967	Count Paul	94	" she said , and then cast a meaning glance at Chester . It was an odd look , and somehow it inspired him with a prejudice against the person , this "
74969	74977	74966	74967	Count Paul	94	" of whom Sylvia had just spoken . "
74984	75029	74981	74981	he	94	" There was relief , nay gladness , ringing in Mrs. Bailey 's frank voice . The Comte de Virieu was pushing his way through the slowly moving crowd . Without looking at the Wachners , he placed ten louis in Sylvia 's hand . "
75036	75042	75030	75030	Your	0	" he said , briefly . "
75068	75076	75064	75064	I	0	" Chester 's prejudice grew , unreasonably . "
75104	75159	75094	75095	Mrs. Bailey	71	" He acknowledged Sylvia 's introduction of the Count very stiffly , and he was relieved when the other turned on his heel — relieved , and yet puzzled to see how surprised Sylvia seemed to be by his departure . She actually tried to keep the Count from going back to the Club . "
75176	75194	75094	75095	Mrs. Bailey	71	" she said , in a tone of deep disappointment . But he , bowing , answered , "
75203	75212	75197	75197	Madame	2550	" He waited a moment , then muttered , "
75227	75286	75197	75197	Madame	2550	" Sylvia turned away . Tears had sprung to her eyes . But Chester saw nothing of her agitation , and a moment later they were all four out in the kindly darkness . Even to Chester there was something grateful in the sudden stillness in which he and the three others found themselves on leaving the Casino . "
75306	75321	75322	75322	One	2530	" he exclaimed , as they made their way up the rough little lane . "
75340	75341	75387	75387	you	1991	" "
75351	75361	75387	75387	you	1991	" answered Madame Wachner , laughing her jovial laugh . "
75392	75393	75387	75387	you	1991	" "
75397	75466	75467	75467	I	0	" said L'Ami Fritz , in his deep voice , and Chester turned , rather surprised . It was the first word he had heard Monsieur Wachner utter . Sylvia was trying hard to forget Count Paul and his broken promise , and to be her natural self . As they emerged into the better - lighted thoroughfare , where stood a row of carriages , she said , "
75479	75486	75467	75467	I	0	" Madame Wachner officiously struck in , "
75531	75532	75513	75513	e	2563	" "
75539	75545	75513	75513	e	2563	" said Sylvia , anxiously . "
75555	75556	75513	75513	e	2563	" "
75559	75565	75513	75513	e	2563	" said Chester , shortly . "
75580	75591	75571	75571	he	2000	" They were now close to the Villa du Lac . "
75605	75609	75595	75595	I	0	" said Sylvia . "
75627	75784	75595	75595	I	0	" And then Chester started off with his two strange companions . How very unlike this evening had been to what he had pictured it would be ! Years before , as a boy , he had spent a week at a primitive seaside hotel near Dieppe . He had thought Lacville would be like that . He had imagined himself arriving at a quiet , rural , little country inn , and had seen himself kindly , if a little shyly , welcomed by Sylvia . He could almost have laughed at the contrast between the place his fancy had painted and the place he had found , at what he had thought would happen , and at what had happened ! As they trudged along , Chester , glancing to his right , saw that there were still a great many boats floating on the lake . Did Lacville folk never go to bed ? "
75787	75797	75595	75595	I	0	" said Madame Wachner , quickly divining his thoughts , "
75850	75870	75871	75871	I	0	" She sighed , a long , sentimental sigh , and looked across , affectionately , at L'Ami Fritz . "
75884	75888	75871	75871	I	0	" she said . "
75906	76027	75903	75904	the French	118	" Her husband strode forward in gloomy silence , probably thinking over the money he might have made or lost had he played that evening , instead of only noting down the turns of the game . Madame Wachner babbled on , making conversation for Chester . She was trying to find out something more about this quiet Englishman . Why had he come to Lacville ? How long was he going to stay here ? What was his real relation to Sylvia Bailey ? Those were the questions that the pretty English widow 's new friend was asking herself , finding answers thereto which were unsatisfactory , because vague and mysterious . At last she ventured a direct query . "
76041	76042	76029	76029	you	2006	" "
76048	76053	76029	76029	you	2006	" said Chester shortly . "
76108	76143	76174	76174	them?—dowagers	2013	" He asked the question abruptly ; he was already full of dislike and suspicion of everything , though not of everybody , at Lacville . These Wachners were certainly nice , simple people . "
76157	76163	76174	76174	them?—dowagers	2013	" said Madame Wachner cautiously . "
76205	76258	76282	76282	I	0	Casino"—she told the lie with bold deliberation . Some instinct told her that while Chester was at Lacville Sylvia would not go to the Casino as often as she had been in the habit of doing . There was a pause — and then again Madame Wachner asked the Englishman a question : "
76279	76280	76260	76260	you	1965	" "
76285	76429	76282	76282	I	0	" he said heavily , without really thinking of what he was saying . They were now walking along broad , shady roads which reminded him of those in a well - kept London suburb . Not a sound issued from any of the houses which stood in gardens on either side , and in the moonlight he saw that they were all closely shuttered . It might almost have been a little township of empty houses . Again the thought crossed his mind what a dangerous place these lonely roads might be to a man carrying a lot of gold and notes on his person . They had not met a single policeman , or , indeed , anyone , after they had left the side of the lake . At last Madame Wachner stopped short before a large wooden door . ' "
76434	76439	76440	76440	I	0	" she said briskly . "
76507	76508	76509	76509	You	0	" "
76514	76598	76509	76509	You	0	" said Chester heartily — and , indeed , he did feel this entire stranger 's kindness exceptional . How fortunate that Sylvia had come across such a nice , simple , kindly woman in such a queer place as Lacville ! But Madame Wachner 's good - natured proposal had never to be seriously considered , for when her vigorous hand found and pulled the bell there came sounds in the courtyard beyond , and a moment later the door swung open . "
76603	76612	76615	76617	the English gentleman	1918	" cried M. Malfait in a loud voice . "
76624	76639	76615	76617	the English gentleman	1918	" said Madame Wachner quickly ; and at once the Frenchman 's voice softened . "
76649	76654	76647	76647	M'sieur	151	" he said amiably . "
76692	76702	76681	76681	they	398	" Chester was shaking hands cordially with the Wachners . "
76710	76715	76704	76704	you	2027	" he said heartily . "
76743	76783	76734	76734	you	2027	" Once the good - natured couple had walked off arm in arm into the night , the door of the Pension Malfait was locked and barred , and Chester followed his landlord into the long , dark house . "
76798	76806	76794	76796	queer characters about	2030	" said M. Malfait ; and then , "
76835	76850	76831	76831	Bass	157	" he said , solicitously . But the Englishman shook his head , smiling . "
76855	76865	76866	76866	I	0	" he said slowly , in his bad French , "
76882	76883	76886	76886	M'sieur	151	" "
76891	76897	76886	76886	M'sieur	151	" said the landlord civilly . "
76925	76944	76945	76945	I	0	" They were walking through the lower part of the house , and then suddenly M. Malfait exclaimed , "
76966	77018	76953	76953	I	0	" The pleasant vista of a good hot bath floated before Chester 's weary brain and body . Really the house was not as primitive as he had thought it when he had seen the landlord come forward with a candle . M. Malfait turned round and flung open a door . "
77028	77033	76953	76953	I	0	" he said proudly . "
77046	77132	76953	76953	I	0	" And it did ! For the odd little room into which Chester was shown by his host served as store cupboard as well as bath - room . It was lined with shelves on which stood serried rows of pots of home - made jam , jars of oil and vinegar , and huge tins of rice , vermicelli , and tapioca , in a corner a round zinc basin — but a basin of Brobdignagian size — stood under a cold water tap . "
77156	77162	77167	77167	M'sieur	151	" said the landlord pompously . "
77186	77199	77167	77167	M'sieur	151	" He shut the door carefully , and led the way upstairs . "
77204	77210	77201	77201	we	2040	" he whispered at last . "
77265	79103	77247	77247	she	2045	" He put the candle down , and bowed himself out of the room . Chester looked round the large , bare sleeping chamber in which he found himself with the agreeable feeling that his long , hot , exciting day was now at an end . Yes , it was a pleasant room — bare , and yet furnished with everything essential to comfort . Thus there was a good big , roomy arm - chair , a writing - table , and a clock , of which the hands now pointed to a quarter to one o'clock . The broad , low bed , pushed back into an alcove as is the French fashion , looked delightfully cool and inviting by the light of his one candle . When M. Malfait had shown him into the room the window was wide open to the hot , starless night , but the landlord , though he had left the window open , had drawn the thick curtains across it . That was all right ; Chester had no wish to be wakened at five in the morning by the sunlight streaming into the room . He meant to have a really long rest . He was too tired to think — too tired to do anything but turn in . And then an odd thing happened . Chester 's brain was so thoroughly awake , he had become so over - excited , that he could not , try as he might , fall asleep . He lay awake tossing about hour after hour . And then , when at last he did fall into a heavy , troubled slumber , he was disturbed by extraordinary and unpleasant dreams — nightmares in which Sylvia Bailey seemed to play a part . At last he roused himself and pulled back the curtains from across the window . It was already dawn , but he thought the cool morning air might induce sleep , and for a while , lying on his side away from the light , he did doze lightly . Quite suddenly he was awakened by the sensation , nay , the knowledge , that there was someone in the room ! So vivid was this feeling of unwished - for companionship that he got up and looked in the shadowed recess of the alcove in which stood his bed ; but , of course , there was no one there . In fact there would not have been space there for any grown - up person to squeeze into . He told himself that what he had heard — if he had heard anything — was someone bringing him his coffee and rolls , and that the servant had probably been trying to attract his attention , for , following his prudent custom , he had locked his door the night before . He unlocked the door and looked out , staring this way and that along the empty passage . But no , in spite of the now - risen sun , it was still early morning ; the Pension Malfait was sunk in sleep . Chester went back to bed . He felt tired , disturbed , uneasy ; sleep was out of the question ; so he lay back , and with widely - open eyes , began to think of Sylvia Bailey and of the strange events of the night before . He lived again the long hour he had spent at the Casino . He could almost smell the odd , sweet , stuffy smell of the Baccarat Room , and there rose before him its queer , varied inmates . He visioned distinctly Sylvia Bailey as he had suddenly seen her , sitting before the green cloth , with her money piled up before her , and a look of eager interest and absorption on her face . There had always been in Sylvia something a little rebellious , a touch of individuality which made her unlike the other women he knew , and which fascinated and attracted him . She was a woman who generally knew her own mind , and who had her own ideas of right and wrong . Lying there , he remembered how determined she had been about those pearls .... Chester 's thoughts took a softer turn . How very , very pretty she had looked last evening — more than pretty — lovelier than he had ever seen her . There seemed to be new depths in her blue eyes . But Chester was shrewd enough to know that Sylvia had felt ashamed to be caught by him gambling — gambling , too , in such very mixed company . Well , she would soon be leaving Lacville ! What a pity those friends of hers had given up their Swiss holiday ! It would have been so jolly if they could have gone on there together . He got tired of lying in bed . What a long night , as well as a very short night , it had been ! He rose and made his way down to the primitive bath - room . It would be delightful to have any sort of bath , and the huge zinc basin had its points — As Chester went quickly back to his room , instead of feeling refreshed after his bath , he again experienced the disagreeable sensation that he was not alone . This time he felt as if he were being accompanied by an invisible presence . It was a very extraordinary and a most unpleasant feeling , one which Chester had never experienced before , and it made him afraid — afraid he knew not of what . Being the manner of man he was , he began to think that he must be ill — that there must be something the matter with his nerves . Had he been at home , in Market Dalling , he would have gone to a doctor without loss of time . Long afterwards , when people used to speak before him of haunted houses , Bill Chester would remember the Pension Malfait and the extraordinary sensations he had experienced there — sensations the more extraordinary that there was nothing to account for them . But Chester never told anyone of his experiences , and indeed there was nothing to tell . He never saw anything , he never even heard anything , but now and again , especially when he was lying awake at night and in the early morning , the lawyer felt as if some other entity was struggling to communicate with him and could not do so .... The whole time he was there — and he stayed on at Lacville , as we shall see , rather longer than he at first intended — Chester never felt , when in his room at the Pension Malfait really alone , and sometimes the impression became almost intolerably vivid . But the longest night , the most haunted night , and Chester 's night had indeed been haunted , comes to an end at last . After he had had another bath and a good breakfast he felt a very different man to what he had done three or four hours ago , lying awake in the sinister , companioned atmosphere of his bed - room at the Pension Malfait . Telling his courteous landlord that he would not be in to luncheon , Chester left the house , and as it was still far too early to seek out Sylvia , he struck out , with the aid of the little pocket - map of the environs of Paris with which he had been careful to provide himself , towards the open country . And as he swung quickly along , feeling once more tired and depressed , the Englishman wondered more and more why Sylvia Bailey cared to stay in such a place as Lacville . It struck him as neither town nor country — more like an unfinished suburb than anything else , with almost every piece of spare land up for sale . He walked on and on till at last he came to the edge of a great stretch of what looked like primeval woodland . This surely must be part of the famous Forest of Montmorency , which his guide - book mentioned as being the great attraction of Lacville ? He wondered cynically whether Sylvia had ever been so far , and then he plunged into the wood , along one of the ordered alleys which to his English eyes looked so little forest - like , and yet which made walking there very pleasant . Suddenly there fell on his ear the sound of horses trotting quickly . He looked round , and some hundred yards or so to his right , at a place where four roads met under high arching trees , he saw two riders , a man and a woman , pass by . They had checked their horses to a walk , and as their voices floated over to him , the woman 's voice seemed extraordinarily , almost absurdly , familiar — in fact , he could have sworn it was Sylvia Bailey 's voice . Chester stopped in his walk and shrugged his shoulders impatiently . She must indeed be dwelling in his thoughts if he thus involuntarily evoked her presence where she could by no stretch of possibility be . But that wandering echo brought Sylvia Bailey very near to Chester , and once more he recalled her as he had seen her sitting at the gambling table the night before . In grotesque juxtaposition he remembered , together with that picture of Sylvia as he had seen her last night , the case of a respectable old lady , named Mrs. Meeks , the widow of a clergyman who had had a living in the vicinity of Market Dalling . Not long after her husband 's death this old lady — she had about three hundred a year , and Chester had charge of her money matters — went abroad for a few weeks to Mentone . Those few weeks had turned Mrs. Meeks into a confirmed gambler . She now lived entirely at Monte Carlo in one small room . He could not help remembering now the kind of remarks that were made by the more prosperous inhabitants of Market Dalling , his fellow citizens , when they went off for a short holiday to the South , in January or February . They would see this poor lady , this Mrs. Meeks , wandering round the gaming tables , and the sight would amuse and shock them . Chester knew that one of the first things said to him after the return of such people would be , "
79133	79419	79115	79116	Mrs. Meeks	158	" And now he told himself ruefully that it would be enough to make honest George Bailey turn in his grave could he see his pretty , sheltered Sylvia sitting in the Casino at Lacville , surrounded by the riffraff collected there last night , and actually taking an active part in the game as well as risking her money with business - like intentness . He wondered if he could persuade Sylvia to leave Lacville soon . In any case he would himself stay on here three or four days — he had meant only to stay twenty - four hours , for he was on his way to join a friend whose Swiss holiday was limited . The sensible thing for Sylvia to do would be to go back to England . Chester reached the Villa du Lac at half - past eleven and as he went out into the charming garden where he was told he would find Mrs. Bailey he told himself that Lacville was not without some innocent attractions . But Mrs. Bailey was not alone in this lovely garden . Sitting on the lawn by her was the Frenchman who had been with her when Chester had first caught sight of her at the Casino the night before . The two were talking so earnestly that they only became aware of his approach when he was close to them , and though Chester was not a particularly observant man , he had an instant and most unpleasant impression that he had come too soon ; that Sylvia was not glad to see him ; and that the Frenchman was actually annoyed , even angered , by his sudden appearance . "
79431	79438	79115	79116	Mrs. Meeks	158	" said Sylvia , getting up . "
79452	79461	79449	79449	they	2051	" she turned to the Comte de Virieu . "
79470	79481	79464	79464	Madame	67	" he said ; and then he added , bowing , "
79518	79519	79520	79520	You	67	" "
79534	79576	79531	79532	the Duchesse	1547	" faltered Sylvia . Chester looked at her sharply . This Frenchman 's sister ? The Duchesse?—how very intimate Sylvia seemed to be with the fellow ! As the Count turned and sauntered back to the house she said rather breathlessly , "
79620	79637	79610	79612	the Duc d'Eglemont	849	" And as he made no answer she went on , as if on the defensive . "
79686	80006	79680	79680	he	99	" While they were enjoying the excellent luncheon prepared for them by M. Polperro , Chester was uncomfortably aware that the Count , sitting at his solitary meal at another table , could , should he care to do so , overhear every word the other two were saying . But Paul de Virieu did not look across or talk as an Englishman would probably have done had he been on familiar terms with a fellow - guest in an hotel . Instead he devoted himself , in the intervals of the meal , to reading a paper . But now and again Chester , glancing across , could see the other man 's eyes fixed on himself with a penetrating , thoughtful look . What did this Frenchman mean by staring at him like that ? As for Sylvia , she was obviously ill at ease . She talked quickly , rather disconnectedly , of the many things appertaining to her life at home , in Market Dalling , which she had in common with the English lawyer . She only touched on the delightful time she had had in Paris , and she said nothing of Lacville . Long before the others had finished , Count Paul got up ; before leaving the dining - room , he turned and bowed ceremoniously to Sylvia and her companion . With his disappearance it seemed to Chester that Sylvia at once became her natural , simple , eager , happy self . She talked less , she listened more , and at last Chester began to enjoy his holiday . They went out again into the garden , and the wide lawn , with its shaded spaces of deep green , was a delicious place in which to spend a quiet , idle hour . They sat down and drank their coffee under one of the cedars of Lebanon . "
80018	80024	79680	79680	he	99	" he said at last . "
80044	80048	80038	80038	I	0	Sylvia"—he looked at her gravely—"that
80056	80057	80058	80058	You	0	" "
80071	80077	80058	80058	You	0	" she exclaimed , deprecatingly . "
80107	80121	80124	80124	you	2060	" He shook his head at her — playfully , but seriously too . "
80126	80131	80124	80124	you	2060	" he asked dryly . "
80139	80158	80136	80137	Madame Wachner	67	" said Sylvia suddenly , and Chester thought there was a little touch of relief in her voice . "
80162	80221	80159	80160	Madame Wachner	67	" And then the Englishman , gazing at the stout , squat figure which was waddling along the grass towards them , remembered . This was the good lady who had been so kind to him the night before ; nay , who had actually offered to give him a bed if the Pension Malfait had been closed . "
80230	80238	80222	80222	We	2063	" she said , partly addressing Chester , "
80271	80301	80250	80251	Madame Sylvia	67	" She fixed her bright little eyes on Sylvia 's face . Sylvia looked at Chester ; she was smiling ; he thought she would like him to accept . "
80309	80320	80307	80307	you	67	" he said cordially . Sylvia nodded her head gaily : "
80331	80335	80328	80329	Madame Wachner	67	" she exclaimed . "
80368	80369	80404	80405	l'Ami Fritz	110	" "
80372	80391	80404	80405	l'Ami Fritz	110	" said Madame Wachner . And then , to Chester 's satisfaction , she turned and went away . "
80398	80402	80392	80392	I	0	" she said , "
80421	80422	80412	80412	E	110	" "
80428	80433	80424	80426	a nice woman	3665	" said Chester heartily , "
80472	80473	80464	80470	a number of people in the hotel	2070	" "
80479	80505	80464	80470	a number of people in the hotel	2070	" she stopped abruptly . She certainly had come to know the Comte de Virieu , but he was the exception , not the rule . "
80558	80572	80574	80574	you	0	" She spoke without thinking — in fact she uttered her thoughts aloud . "
80592	80597	80574	80574	you	0	" he said slowly . "
80604	80609	80600	80600	I	0	" she protested eagerly . "
80630	80831	80620	80620	I'm	0	" Chester never forgot that first day of his at Lacville . It was by far the pleasantest day he spent there , and Sylvia Bailey , woman - like , managed entirely to conceal from him that she was not as pleased with their expedition as was her companion . Thanks to M. Polperro 's good offices , they managed to hire a really good motor ; and once clear of the fantastic little houses and the waste ground which was all up for sale , how old - world and beautiful were the little hamlets , the remote stretches of woodland and the quiet country towns through which they sped ! On their way back , something said by Sylvia surprised and disturbed Chester very much . She had meant to conceal the fact that she was riding with Paul de Virieu each morning , but it is very difficult for one accustomed always to tell the truth to use deceit . And suddenly a careless word revealed to Chester that the horsewoman whose voice had sounded so oddly familiar to him in the Forest that morning had really been Sylvia herself ! He turned on her quickly : "
80842	80847	80839	80840	this Frenchman	1076	" he asked quietly . "
80852	80856	80839	80840	this Frenchman	1076	" she answered . "
80875	80927	80873	80873	her	3245	" she raised her voice , and blushed deeply in the rushing wind . Chester felt his mind suddenly fill with angry suspicion . Was it possible that this Comte de Virieu , this man of whom that nice Madame Wachner had spoken with such scorn as a confirmed gambler , was "
80930	81002	81003	81003	Sylvia	67	" to Sylvia ? It was a monstrous idea — but Chester , being a solicitor , knew only too well that in the matter of marriage the most monstrous and disastrous things are not only always possible but sometimes probable . Chester believed that all Frenchmen regard marriage as a matter of business . To such a man as this Count , Mrs. Bailey 's fortune would be a godsend . "
81005	81045	81046	81046	Sylvia	67	" he exclaimed , in a low , stern voice . He turned round and looked at her . She was staring straight before her ; the colour had faded from her cheek ; she looked pale and tired . "
81048	81052	81046	81046	Sylvia	67	" he repeated . "
81065	81087	81046	81046	Sylvia	67	" She glanced quickly at the man sitting by her side . His voice was charged with emotion , with anger . "
81095	81099	81046	81046	Sylvia	67	" he repeated . "
81119	81131	81112	81112	your	67	" Sylvia got up and touched the driver on the shoulder . "
81136	81142	81112	81112	your	67	" she said in French , "
81151	81160	81163	81163	Bill	79	" Then she sank back in her seat . "
81187	81188	81181	81181	We	2082	" "
81206	81207	81181	81181	We	2082	" "
81210	81217	81181	81181	We	2082	" said Sylvia , very quietly , "
81265	81266	81269	81269	he	99	" "
81272	81278	81269	81269	he	99	" asked Chester , hoarsely . "
81290	81311	81279	81279	You	79	" she answered , passionately ; and then , after a pause , she added , in a low voice : "
81324	81426	81322	81322	Bill	79	" Her eyes were full of tears . As for Chester , he felt a variety of conflicting emotions , of which perhaps the strongest was a determination that if he could not get her no one else should do so . This — this damned French gambler had touched Sylvia 's kind heart . Surely she could n't care for a man she had only known a month , and such an affected , dandified fellow , too ? It was with relief that they both became aware a few moments later that they were on the outskirts of Lacville . "
81434	81438	81322	81322	Bill	79	" exclaimed Sylvia . "
81447	81659	81322	81322	Bill	79	" The English lawyer stared at the bright pink building ; with curiosity and amusement . It was indeed a funny little place , this brick - built bungalow , so fantastically and , to his British eyes , so ridiculously decorated with blue china lozenges , on which were painted giant lilies of the valley . But he had not long to look , for as the car drew up before the white gate Madame Wachner 's short , broad figure came hurrying down the path . She opened the gate , and with boisterous heartiness welcomed Chester and Sylvia into the neglected garden . Chester looked round him with an involuntary surprise . The Wachners ' home was entirely unlike what he had expected to find it . He had thought to see one of those trim , neat little villas surrounded by gay , exquisitely tended little gardens which are the pride of the Parisian suburban dweller . Madame Wachner caught his glance , and the thought crossed her mind uncomfortably that she had perhaps made a mistake , a serious mistake , in asking this priggish - looking Englishman to come to the Châlet des Muguets . He evidently did not like the look of the place . "
81669	81675	81701	81701	e	2092	" she exclaimed , regretfully . "
81747	81748	81742	81742	e	2092	" "
81754	81760	81742	81742	e	2092	" broke in Sylvia frankly , "
81851	81852	81842	81842	I	0	" "
81855	81864	81842	81842	I	0	" said Madame Wachner , glancing at her , "
81882	81883	81877	81877	Fritz	110	" "
81923	81928	81929	81929	I	0	" went on Sylvia . "
81954	81955	81956	81956	You	2087	" "
81962	81971	81956	81956	You	2087	" echoed Madame Wachner in a startled tone . "
81979	81986	81972	81972	You	2087	" she shook her head gravely . "
82005	82038	81996	81996	We	2101	" L'Ami Fritz stood waiting for his visitors in the narrow doorway . He looked more good - tempered than usual , and as they walked in he chatted pleasantly to Chester . "
82042	82048	81996	81996	We	2101	" he said , importantly . "
82069	82306	82060	82060	We	2101	" And Sylvia Bailey was amused , as well as rather touched , to see the preparations which had been made in the little dining - room for the entertainment of Bill Chester and of herself . In the middle of the round table which had looked so bare yesterday was a bowl of white roses — roses that had never grown in the untidy garden outside . Two dessert dishes were heaped up with delicious cakes — the cakes for which French pastrycooks are justly famed . There was also a basin full of the Alpine strawberries which Sylvia loved , and of which she always ordered a goodly supply at the Villa du Lac . Madame Wachner had even remembered to provide the thick cream , which , to a foreign taste , spoils the delicate flavour of strawberries . They were really very kind people , these Wachners ! Looking round the funny little dining - room , Sylvia could not help remembering how uncomfortable she had felt when sitting there alone the day before . It was hard now to believe that she should have had that queer , eerie feeling of discomfort and disquietude in such a commonplace , cheerful room . She told herself that there probably had been some little creature hidden there — some shy , wild thing , which maybe had crept in out of the wood . "
82317	82335	82309	82309	I	0	" said Madame Wachner pleasantly , and Sylvia gaily insisted on accompanying her hostess into the kitchen . "
82354	82369	82370	82370	I	0	" said Madame Wachner jovially . The young Englishwoman shook her head , smiling . "
82379	82383	82370	82370	I	0	" she cried . "
82423	82447	82470	82472	a strange person	2113	" She looked wistfully at her companion . Madame Wachner was in the act of pouring the boiling water into her china teapot . "
82452	82460	82470	82472	a strange person	2113	" she said , bending over it , "
82507	82515	82502	82502	she	2563	" she shrugged her shoulders , expressively . "
82525	82530	82518	82518	she	2563	" said Sylvia slowly . "
82584	82621	82559	82559	She	73	" Madame Wachner had now made the tea . She turned and stood with arms akimbo , staring out of the little window which gave on the sun - baked lawn bounded by the chestnut wood . "
82624	82629	82559	82559	She	73	" she said slowly , "
82688	82689	82678	82678	you	0	" "
82702	82710	82690	82690	She	2563	" said Sylvia in a low voice . "
82714	82723	82690	82690	She	2563	dear"—Madame Wachner put her fat hand on Sylvia 's shoulder—"you
82789	83374	83387	83388	L'Ami Fritz	112	" Carrying the teapot she led the way into the dining - room , and they sat down round the table . The little tea - party went off fairly well , but Chester could not forget his strange conversation with Sylvia in the motor . Somehow , he and she had never come so really near to one another as they had done that afternoon . And yet , on the other hand , he felt that she was quite unlike what he had thought her to be . It was as if he had come across a new Sylvia . Madame Wachner , looking at his grave , absorbed face , felt uneasy . Was it possible that this Englishman intended to take pretty Mrs. Bailey away from Lacville ? That would be a pity — a very great pity ! She glanced apprehensively at her husband . L'Ami Fritz would make himself very unpleasant if Sylvia left Lacville just now . He would certainly taunt his wife with all the money they had spent on her entertainment — it was money which they both intended should bear a very high rate of interest . The two following days dragged themselves uneventfully away . Sylvia did her best to be kind to Bill Chester , but she felt ill at ease , and could not help showing it . And then she missed the excitement and interest of the Casino . Bill had not suggested that they should go there , and she would not be the one to do so . The long motoring expeditions they took each afternoon gave her no pleasure . Her heart was far away , in Brittany ; in imagination she was standing by a grave surrounded by a shadowy group of men and women , mourning the old Marquise who had left Count Paul the means to become once more a self - respecting and respected member of the world to which he belonged by right of birth .... Had it not been for the Wachners , these two days of dual solitude with Chester would have been dreary indeed , but Madame Wachner was their companion on more than one long excursion and wherever Madame Wachner went there reigned a kind of jollity and sense of cheer . Sylvia wondered if the Comte de Virieu was indeed coming back as he had said he would do . And yet she knew that were he to return now , at once , to his old ways , his family , those who loved him , would have the right to think him incorrigible . As is the way with a woman when she loves , Sylvia did not consider herself as a factor affecting his return to Lacville . Nay , she was bitterly hurt that he had not written her a line since he had left . And now had come the evening of the day when Count Paul had meant to come back . But M. Polperro said no word of his return . Still , it was quite possible that he would arrive late , and Sylvia did not wish to see him when in the company , not only of Bill Chester , but also of the Wachners . Somehow or other , she had fallen into the habit each evening of asking the Wachners to dinner . She did so to - day , but suggested dining at a restaurant . "
83390	83473	83387	83388	L'Ami Fritz	112	" said Madame Wachner decidedly . And after a slight demur Sylvia consented . They dined at the hotel which is just opposite the Casino . After the pleasant meal was over , for it had been pleasant , and the cheerful hostess had taken special pains over the menu , Sylvia weary at the thought of another long , dull evening in the drawing - room of the Villa du Lac , was secretly pleased to hear Madame Wachner exclaim coaxingly : "
83542	83546	83547	83547	You	152	" Chester smiled . "
83558	83564	83547	83547	You	152	" he said , lightly . "
83577	83587	83565	83565	I	0	" Why should he be a spoil - sport ? "
83631	83640	83627	83629	Comte de Virieu	99	" Madame Wachner looked at the speaker significantly . "
83643	83647	83648	83650	The poor Count	2126	" she said . "
83691	83975	83688	83688	i	0	" Sylvia was startled . She wondered how the Wachners could have come to know of the Count 's legacy . She got up , with a nervous , impatient gesture . How dull , how long , how intolerable had been the last two days spent by her in the company of Bill Chester , varied by that of talkative Madame Wachner and the silent , dour Ami Fritz ! Her heart felt very sore . During that last hour she and Count Paul had spent together in the garden , she had begged him to stay away — to spend the rest of the summer with his sister . Supposing he took her at her word — supposing he never came back to Lacville at all ? Sylvia tried to tell herself that in that case she would be glad , and that she only wanted her friend to do the best , the wisest thing for himself . Such were her thoughts — her painful thoughts — as she walked across from the restaurant to the entrance of the Casino . Two whole days had gone by since she had been there last , and oh ! how long each hour of those days had seemed ! The two oddly - assorted couples passed through into the hall , and so up to the closely - guarded doors of the Club . The Baccarat Room was very full , fuller than usual , for several parties of merry , rather boisterous young men had come out from Paris to spend the evening . She heard the words that were now so familiar , solemnly shouted out at the further table : "
83987	84159	83688	83688	i	0	" There was a pause , and there fell on Sylvia 's ears the murmur of two voices — the voice of the official who represented the Casino authorities , and the deep , low voice which had become so dear to her — which thrilled her heart each time she heard it . Then Count Paul had come back ? He had not followed her advice ? And instead of being sorry , as she ought to have been , she was glad — glad ! Not glad to know that he was here in the Casino — Sylvia was sorry for that — but glad that he was once more close to her . Till this moment she had scarcely realised how much his mere presence meant to her . She could not see Paul de Virieu , for there was a crowd — a noisy , chattering crowd of over - dressed men , each with a gaudily - dressed feminine companion — encompassing her on every side . "
84174	84183	83688	83688	i	0	" A pause — then the words repeated . "
84190	84224	84225	84225	You	2129	" Monsieur Wachner leant his tall , lean form over Sylvia . She looked up surprised , L'Ami Fritz very seldom spoke to her , or for the matter of that to anyone . "
84234	84239	84225	84225	You	2129	" he said imperiously . "
84263	84287	84255	84255	you	2129	" She looked at him hesitatingly . His words made her remember the friend to whom she so seldom gave a thought nowadays . "
84299	84327	84294	84294	Anna	72	" she whispered . Monsieur Wachner stared at her , and a look of fear , almost of terror , came over his drawn , hatchet face . "
84334	84339	84294	84294	Anna	72	" he exclaimed harshly . "
84348	84355	84356	84356	Sylvia	67	" And then Chester broke in , "
84366	84561	84356	84356	Sylvia	67	" he cried rather impatiently . It angered him to feel that she would not do in his presence what she would most certainly have done were he not there . And then Sylvia suddenly made up her mind that she would play . Count Paul was holding the Bank . He was risking — how much was it?—twenty thousand francs . Eight hundred pounds of his legacy ? That was madness , absolute madness on his part ! Well , she would gamble too ! There came across her a curious feeling — one that gave her a certain painful joy — the feeling that they two were one . While he was risking his money , she would try to win his money . Were he in luck to - night , she would be glad to know that it would be her money he would win . M. Wachner officiously made room for her at the table ; and , as she sat down , the Comte de Virieu , looking round , saw who had come there , and he flushed and looked away , straight in front of him . "
84567	84641	84356	84356	Sylvia	67	" said Monsieur Wachner eagerly indicating Sylvia . And the croupier , with a smile , pushed the two fateful cards towards the fair young Englishwoman . Sylvia took up the two cards . She glanced down at them . Yes , L'Ami Fritz had been right . She was in luck to - night ! In a low voice she uttered the welcome words — in French , of course — the words "
84643	84645	84646	84647	The King	3309	" and "
84649	84904	84646	84647	The King	3309	" as she put the cards , face upwards , on the green cloth . And then there came for her and for those who backed her , just as there had done on that first fateful evening at the Casino , an extraordinary run of good fortune . Again and again the cards were dealt to Sylvia , and again and again she turned up a Nine , a Queen , a King , an Eight—. Once more the crowd excitedly followed her luck , staring at her with grateful pleasure , with fascinated interest , as she brought them temporary wealth . The more she won , the more she made other people win , the more miserable Sylvia felt , and as she saw Count Paul 's heap of notes and gold diminishing , she grew unutterably wretched . Eight hundred pounds ? What an enormous lot of money to risk in an evening ! Then there came a change . For a few turns of the game luck deserted her , and Sylvia breathed more freely . She glanced up into Count Paul 's impassive face . He looked worn and tired , as well he might be after his long journey from Brittany . Then once more magic fortune came back . It seemed as if only good cards — variations on the fateful eights and nines — could be dealt her . Suddenly she pushed her chair back and got up . Protesting murmurs rose on every side . "
84916	84939	84914	84914	her	67	" she heard one or two people murmur discontentedly . Chester was looking at her with amused , sarcastic , disapproving eyes . "
84942	84946	84914	84914	her	67	" he exclaimed . "
84976	84977	84967	84969	that poor fellow	2133	" "
84981	84986	84967	84969	that poor fellow	2133	" she answered mechanically . "
85008	85026	85001	85001	I	0	" he was still speaking with a good deal of sarcasm in his voice . But still , "
85030	85063	85001	85001	I	0	" and even against his will Chester was impressed . Ninety pounds represents a very heavy bill of costs in a country solicitor 's practice . Sylvia looked dully into his face . "
85066	85071	85001	85001	I	0	" she said slowly . "
85122	85123	85110	85110	he	3511	" "
85129	85188	85110	85110	he	3511	" exclaimed Chester drily . And then they became silent , for close by where they now stood , a little apart from the table , an angry altercation was going on between Monsieur and Madame Wachner . It was the first time Sylvia had ever heard the worthy couple quarrelling in public the one with the other . "
85198	85207	85189	85189	I	0	" L'Ami Fritz was saying between his teeth . "
85313	85373	85307	85307	I	0	" Sylvia looked round , a good deal concerned . Madame Wachner 's face was red , and she was plainly very angry and put out . But when she saw that she and her husband had attracted the attention of their English friends , she made a great effort to regain her self - control and good humour . "
85377	85381	85307	85307	I	0	" she said , "
85455	85502	85453	85453	Fritz	112	" And suiting her action to her words , she put her arm familiarly through Sylvia 's and together they walked out of the Baccarat Room , followed by Chester . When they were in the vestibule Madame Wachner turned to him with a rueful smile : "
85508	85512	85453	85453	Fritz	112	" she said , "
85568	85571	85560	85560	you	2143	dear"—she turned to Sylvia—"that
85627	85628	85618	85621	the Comte de Virieu	99	" "
85642	85647	85630	85631	the Count	619	" said Sylvia slowly . "
85657	85664	85652	85652	e	112	" the other spoke quite crossly , "
85719	85732	85679	85680	M. Polperro	93	melt"—she chuckled , as if the thought was very pleasant to her . "
85772	85779	85781	85781	you	2143	" she looked affectionately at Sylvia . "
85783	85791	85792	85792	you	2143	Sir"—Madame Wachner turned to Chester with a broad smile—"even
85840	85841	85838	85838	you	2143	" "
85849	85855	85838	85838	you	2143	" said Chester , laughing . "
85877	85878	85866	85866	I	0	" "
85887	85893	85881	85881	you	2143	" asked Madame Wachner inquisitively . "
85927	85941	85916	85916	I	0	" The three were now approaching the gates of the Villa du Lac . "
85946	85950	85951	85951	I	0	" cried Chester . "
85972	85993	85961	85961	I	0	" He spoke lightly , but there was an undercurrent of reproach in his voice , or so Sylvia fancied . "
85998	86048	85961	85961	I	0	" she said , and her voice was tremulous . As she held out her hand the little fancy bag which held all her winnings , the bundle of notes and loose pieces of gold , fell to the ground . Madame Wachner stooped down and picked it up . "
86055	86061	85961	85961	I	0	" she exclaimed , enviously . "
86079	86080	85961	85961	I	0	" "
86089	86093	85961	85961	I	0	" said Sylvia . "
86103	86236	85961	85961	I	0	" But she was not thinking of what she was saying . Her heart was full of anguish . How could Paul de Virieu have been so mad as to risk such an immense sum , a tenth part of the fortune — for fortune it was — which had just been left to him ? Sylvia hated herself for having contributed to his losses . She knew that it was absurd that she should feel this , for the same cards would certainly have been dealt to whoever had happened to take them from the croupier . But still , superstition is part of the virus which fills the gambler 's blood , and she had certainly won a considerable part of the money Count Paul had lost to - night . "
86246	86253	86238	86238	I	0	" asked Chester of Madame Wachner . "
86284	86290	86272	86272	E	0	" Madame Wachner sighed heavily . "
86306	86307	86308	86308	I	0	" "
86318	86323	86324	86324	I	0	" he said kindly . "
86364	86365	86369	86369	he	111	" "
86373	86460	86369	86369	he	111	" again Madame Wachner sighed , and Chester 's heart went out to her . She was a really nice old woman — clever and intelligent , as well as cheerful and brave . It seemed a great pity that she should be cursed with a gambler for a husband . As they went back into the Casino they could hear the people round them talking of the Comte de Virieu , and of the high play that had gone on at the club that evening . "
86468	86537	86463	86463	he	111	" they heard someone say . And Madame Wachner looked anxious . If Count Paul were winning , then her Fritz must be losing . And alas ! her fears were justified . When they got up into the Baccarat Room they found L'Ami Fritz standing apart from the tables , his hands in his pockets , staring abstractedly out of a dark window on to the lake . "
86540	86546	86549	86549	Fritz	112	" cried Madame Wachner sharply , "
86551	86552	86549	86549	Fritz	112	" "
86559	86566	86549	86549	Fritz	112	" he shook his head angrily . "
86619	86656	86608	86608	I	0	" he looked at her disconsolately , deprecatingly . Chester also looked at Madame Wachner . He admired the wife 's self - restraint . Her red face got a little redder . That was all . "
86663	86674	86608	86608	I	0	" she said a trifle coldly , and in French . "
86709	86717	86699	86699	I	0	" Monsieur Wachner shook his head gloomily . "
86729	86946	86699	86699	I	0	" She turned and led the way out . As Sylvia went slowly and wearily up to her room a sudden horror of Lacville swept over her excited brain . For the first time since she had been in the Villa du Lac , she locked the door of her bed - room and sat down in the darkness . She was overwhelmed with feelings of humiliation and pain . She told herself with bitter self - scorn that Paul de Virieu cared nothing for her . If he had cared ever so little he surely would never have done what he had done to - night ? But such thoughts were futile , and soon she rose and turned on the electric light . Then she sat down at a little writing - table which had been thoughtfully provided for her by M. Polperro , and hurriedly , with feverish eagerness , wrote a note . Dear Count de Virieu — I am very tired to - night , and I do not feel as if I should be well enough to ride to - morrow.—Yours sincerely , Sylvia Bailey . That was all , but it was enough . Hitherto she had evidently been — hateful thought — what the matrons of Market Dalling called "
86949	87011	86699	86699	I	0	" in her manner to Count Paul ; henceforth she would be cold and distant to him . She put her note into an envelope , addressed it , and went downstairs again . It was very late , but M. Polperro was still up . The landlord never went to bed till each one of his clients was safe indoors . "
87027	87046	87017	87020	the Comte de Virieu	99	" she said briefly . And then , as the little man looked at her with some surprise , "
87087	87097	87100	87100	Madame	2550	" She tried to smile . M. Polperro bowed . "
87123	87656	87116	87116	He	619	" But the promises of Southerners are pie - crust . Doubtless M. Polperro meant the Count to have the note that night , but he put it aside and forgot all about it . Sylvia had a broken night , and she was still sleeping heavily when she was wakened by the now familiar sound of the horses being brought into the courtyard . She jumped out of bed and peeped through an opening in the closed curtains . It was a beautiful morning . The waters of the lake dimpled in the sun . A door opened , and Sylvia heard voices . Then Count Paul was going riding after all , and by himself ? Sylvia felt a pang of unreasoning anger and regret . Paul de Virieu and M. Polperro were standing side by side ; suddenly she saw the hotel - keeper hand the Count , with a gesture of excuse , the note she had written the night before . Count Paul read it through , then he put it back in its envelope , and placed it in the breast pocket of his coat . He did not send the horses away , as Sylvia in her heart had rather hoped he would do , but he said a word to M. Polperro , who ran into the Villa and returned a moment later with something which he handed , with a deferential bow to the Count . It was a cardcase , and Paul de Virieu scribbled something on a card and gave it to M. Polperro . A minute later he had ridden out of the gates . Sylvia moved away from the window , but she was in no mood to go back to bed . She felt restless , excited , sorry that she had given up her ride . When at last her tea was brought in , she saw the Count 's card lying on the tray : Madame — I regret very much to hear that you are not well — so ran his pencilled words — but I trust you will be able to come down this morning , for I have a message to give you from my sister . Believe me , Madame , of all your servants the most devoted . Paul de Virieu . They met in the garden — the garden which they had so often had to themselves during their short happy mornings ; and , guided by an instinctive longing for solitude , and for being out of sight and out of mind of those about them , they made their way towards the arch in the wall which led to the potager . It was just ten o'clock , and the gardeners were leaving off work for an hour ; they had earned their rest , for their work begins each summer day at sunrise . It was therefore through a sweet - smelling , solitary wilderness that Count Paul guided his companion . They walked along the narrow paths edged with fragrant herbs till they came to the extreme end of the kitchen - garden , and then — "
87664	87683	87116	87116	He	619	" he asked abruptly . Sylvia nodded . These were the first words he had uttered since his short "
87697	87752	87690	87690	Madame	67	" He stepped aside to allow her to go first into the large , finely - proportioned building , which was so charming a survival of eighteenth - century taste . The orangery was cool , fragrant , deserted ; remote indeed from all that Lacville stands for in this ugly , utilitarian world . "
87759	87775	87755	87755	you	67	" he said slowly . And then , as if echoing his companion 's thoughts , "
87793	87794	87791	87791	Madame	67	" "
87806	87851	87797	87797	you	0	" said Sylvia , trying to speak lightly . She sat down on the circular stone seat , and , as he had done on that remembered morning when they were still strangers , he took his place at the other end of it . "
87854	87863	87797	87797	you	0	" he said , looking at her fixedly . "
87874	87880	87868	87868	I	0	" Sylvia made no answer . "
87895	87916	87893	87893	me	0	" He did not look at her as he spoke ; he was tracing imaginary patterns on the stone floor . "
87921	87932	87917	87917	I	0	" he concluded , in a low , bitter tone , "
87944	87951	87917	87917	I	0	" And still Sylvia remained silent . "
87958	87975	87953	87953	you	67	" he asked , rather roughly . And then at last she looked up and spoke . "
87986	87990	87978	87978	you	0	" she said , "
88010	88011	87999	87999	I	0	" "
88021	88035	88018	88018	you	67	" he exclaimed and he jumped up and came and stood before her . "
88106	88107	88092	88092	you	67	" "
88117	88121	88110	88110	you	0	" she faltered . "
88133	88139	88127	88127	you	0	" He shrugged his shoulders . "
88146	88150	88143	88144	a fool	2175	" he answered , bitterly—"a
88188	88201	88185	88186	your friend	2563	" he stopped short and then ended his sentence with the words , "
88218	88224	88225	88225	You	67	" Sylvia also got up . "
88230	88236	88225	88225	You	67	" she said , coldly . "
88244	88245	88246	88246	I	0	" "
88254	88261	88250	88250	you	67	" said Count Paul , seriously . "
88285	88329	88330	88330	You	67	" Sylvia shook her head . She was angry — more hurt and angry than she had ever felt before in her life . She told herself passionately that the Comte de Virieu was refusing that which had not been offered to him . "
88335	88341	88330	88330	You	67	" she answered , lightly . "
88384	88393	88381	88382	one another	191	" She waited , and gently she added , "
88401	88402	88399	88399	you	67	" "
88409	88414	88407	88407	myself	0	" he said sombrely . "
88514	88544	88545	88545	I	0	" His voice had sunk to a hoarse whisper , and he was gazing into Sylvia 's pale face with an anguished look of questioning and of pleading pain . "
88554	88578	88551	88552	Count Paul	94	" Sylvia heard herself uttering gently , composedly , the words which meant at once so much and so little to them both . "
88595	88600	88592	88592	you	94	" she concluded mechanically . "
88610	88615	88604	88604	you	0	" he answered slowly . "
88660	88669	88644	88644	he	152	" Her words stung him in his turn . "
88672	88677	88644	88644	he	152	" he said roughly . "
88686	88693	88683	88684	Mrs. Bailey	71	" He muttered between his teeth , "
88701	88706	88694	88695	Mr. Chester	152	" And then aloud , "
88753	88762	88741	88741	you	2190	" Sylvia gave a little cry of protest . "
88771	88813	88768	88769	Count Paul	94	" She still tried to speak lightly , but the tears were now rolling down her cheeks — and then in a moment she found herself in Paul de Virieu 's arms . She felt his heart beating against her breast . "
88819	88827	88768	88769	Count Paul	94	" he whispered brokenly , in French , "
88836	88837	88832	88832	I	0	" "
88844	88849	88832	88832	I	0	" she said piteously , "
88856	88876	88832	88832	I	0	" Her hand had sought his hand . He grasped it for a moment and then let it go . "
88899	89254	88894	88894	I	0	" he said , but , being human , he did not give her up there and then . Instead , he drew her closer to him , and his lips sought and found her sweet , tremulous mouth . And Chester ? Chester that morning for the first time in his well - balanced life felt not only ill but horribly depressed . He had come back to the Pension Malfait the night before feeling quite well , and as cheerful as his disapproval of Sylvia Bailey 's proceedings at the Casino allowed him to be . And while thoroughly disapproving , he had yet — such being human nature — been glad that Sylvia had won and not lost ! The Wachners had offered to drive him back to his pension , and he had accepted , for it was very late , and Madame Wachner , in spite of her Fritz 's losses , had insisted on taking a carriage home . And then , though he had begun by going to sleep , Chester had waked at the end of an hour to feel himself encompassed , environed , oppressed by the perception — it was far more than a sensation — that he was no longer alone . He sat up in bed and struck a match , at once longing and fearing to see a form,—the semblance of a human being — rise out of the darkness . But all he saw , when he had lighted the candle which stood on the table by his bed , was the barely furnished room which , even in this poor and wavering light , had so cheerful and commonplace an appearance . Owing no doubt to his excellent physical condition , as well as to his good conscience , Chester was a fearless man . A week ago he would have laughed to scorn the notion that the dead ever revisit the earth , as so many of us believe they do , but the four nights he had spent at the Pension Malfait , had shaken his conviction that "
89261	89592	89255	89256	dead men	2193	" Most reluctantly he had come to the conclusion that the Pension Malfait was haunted . And the feeling of unease did not vanish even after he had taken his bath in the queer bath - room , of which the Malfaits were so proud , or later , when he had eaten the excellent breakfast provided for him . On the contrary , the thought of going up to his bed - room , even in broad daylight , filled him with a kind of shrinking fear . He told himself angrily that this kind of thing could not go on . The sleepless nights made him ill — he who never was ill ; also he was losing precious days of his short holiday , while doing no good to himself and no good to Sylvia . Sending for the hotel - keeper , he curtly told him that he meant to leave Lacville that evening . M. Malfait expressed much sorrow and regret . Was M'sieur not comfortable ? Was there anything he could do to prolong his English guest 's stay ? No , M'sieur had every reason to be satisfied , but — but had M. Malfait ever had any complaints of noises in the bed - room occupied by his English guest ? The Frenchman 's surprise and discomfiture seemed quite sincere ; but Chester , looking into his face , suspected that the wondering protests , the assertion that this particular bed - room was the quietest in the house , were not sincere . In this , however he wronged poor M. Malfait . Chester went upstairs and packed . There seemed to be a kind of finality in the act . If she knew he was ready to start that night , Sylvia would not be able to persuade him to stay on , as she probably would try to do . At the Villa du Lac he was greeted with , "
89603	89819	89255	89256	dead men	2193	Virieu"—and he thought he saw a twinkle in merry little M. Polperro 's eyes . Poor Sylvia ! Poor , foolish , wilful Sylvia ! Was it conceivable that after what she had seen the night before she still liked , she still respected , that mad French gambler ? He looked over the wide lawn ; no , there was no sign of Sylvia and the Count . Then , all at once , coming through a door which gave access , as he knew , to the big kitchen - garden of the villa , he saw Mrs. Bailey 's graceful figure ; a few steps behind her walked Count Paul . Chester hurried towards them . How odd they both looked — and how ill at ease ! The Comte de Virieu looked wretched , preoccupied , and gloomy — as well he might do , considering the large sum of money he had lost last night . As for Sylvia — yes , there could be no doubt about it — she had been crying ! When she saw Chester coming towards her , she instinctively tilted her garden hat over her face to hide her reddened eyelids . He felt at once sorry for , and angry with , her . "
89829	89834	89820	89820	I	0	" he said abruptly , "
89879	89900	89901	89901	You	2195	" Sylvia gave him a listless glance , and made no comment on his news . Chester felt rather nettled . "
89915	89919	89901	89901	You	2195	" he said . "
89925	89933	89920	89920	I	0	" she answered in a low voice . "
89948	89949	89934	89934	I	0	" "
89956	89990	89950	89950	I	0	" said the Comte de Virieu . And then , as he saw , or fancied he saw , a satirical expression pass over the Englishman 's face , he added rather haughtily : "
90055	90063	90040	90041	Mrs. Bailey	71	fact"—and then Count Paul gave an odd little laugh—"I
90082	90106	90075	90080	a member of our Alpine Club	2199	" Chester made a sudden resolve , and , what was rare in one so constitutionally prudent , acted on it at once . "
90115	90120	90108	90108	you	2202	" he said quietly , "
90156	90178	90148	90148	Count	94	" The Comte de Virieu remained silent for what seemed to the two waiting for his answer a very long time . "
90192	90474	90148	90148	Count	94	" he said at last . He did not look at Sylvia . He had not looked her way since Chester had joined them . With a hand that shook a little he took his cigarette - case out of his pocket , and held it out to the other man . The die was cast . So be it . Chester , prig though he might be , was right in his wish to remove Sylvia from his , Paul de Virieu 's , company . The Englishman was more right than he would ever know . How amazed Chester would have been had he been able to see straight into Paul de Virieu 's heart ! Had he divined the other 's almost unendurable temptation to take Sylvia Bailey at her word , to impose on her pathetic ignorance of life , to allow her to become a gambler 's wife . Had the woman he loved been penniless , the Comte de Virieu would probably have yielded to the temptation which now came in the subtle garb of jealousy — keen , poisoned - fanged jealousy of this fine looking young Englishman who stood before them both . Would Sylvia ever cling to this man as she had clung to him — would she ever allow Chester to kiss her as she had allowed Paul to kiss her , and that after he had released the hand she had laid in his ? But alas ! there are kisses and kisses — clingings and clingings . Chester , so the Frenchman with his wide disillusioned knowledge of life felt only too sure , would win Sylvia in time . "
90489	90496	90499	90499	you	2205	" he asked the other man , "
90507	90508	90499	90499	you	2205	" "
90519	90727	90511	90511	I	0	" They strolled off together towards the house , and Sylvia walked blindly on to the grass and sat down on one of the rocking - chairs of which M. Polperro was so proud . She looked after the two men with a sense of oppressed bewilderment . Then they were both going away — both going to leave her ? After to - day — how strange , how utterly unnatural the parting seemed — she would probably never see Paul de Virieu again . The day went like a dream — a fantastic , unreal dream . Sylvia did not see Count Paul again alone . She and Chester went a drive in the afternoon — the expedition had been arranged the day before with the Wachners , and there seemed no valid reason why it should be put off . And then Madame Wachner with her usual impulsive good nature , on hearing that both Chester and the Comte de Virieu were going away , warmly invited Sylvia to supper at the Châlet des Muguets for that same night , and Sylvia listlessly accepted . She did not care what she did or where she went . At last came the moment of parting . "
90739	90755	90728	90728	I	0	" she said , and Chester , rather surprised , raised one or two objections . "
90762	90767	90756	90756	I	0	" she cried angrily . "
90789	90908	90777	90777	you	79	" And she did go to the station — only to be sorry for it afterwards . Paul de Virieu , holding her hand tightly clasped in his for the last time , had become frightfully pale , and as she made her way back to the Casino , where the Wachners were actually waiting for her , Sylvia was haunted by his reproachful , despairing eyes . It was nearly nine o'clock , and for the moment the Casino was very empty , for the afternoon players had left , and the evening serie , as M. Polperro contemptuously called them — the casual crowd of night visitors to Lacville — had not yet arrived from Paris . "
90912	90919	90777	90777	you	79	" said Madame Wachner , suddenly , "
90935	90937	90777	90777	you	79	" The "
90942	91220	91221	91221	I	0	" had been watching her husband and Sylvia playing at Baccarat ; both of them had won , and Sylvia had welcomed , eagerly , the excitement of the tables . Count Paul 's muttered farewell echoed in her ears , and the ornately decorated gambling room seemed full of his presence . She made a great effort to put any intimate thought of him away . The next day , so she told herself , she would go back to England , to Market Dalling . There she must forget that such a place as Lacville existed ; there she must banish Paul de Virieu from her heart and memory . Yes , there was nothing now to keep her here , in this curious place , where she had eaten , in more than one sense , of the bitter fruit of the tree of knowledge . With a deep , involuntary sigh , she rose from the table . She looked at the green cloth , at the people standing round it , with an odd feeling that neither the table nor the people round her were quite real . Her heart and thoughts were far away , with the two men both of whom loved her in their very different ways . Then she turned with an unmirthful smile to her companions . It would not be fair to let her private griefs sadden the kindly Wachners . It was really good of them to have asked her to come back to supper at the Châlet des Muguets . She would have found it terribly lonely this evening at the Villa du Lac .... "
91226	91248	91221	91221	I	0	" she said , addressing herself more particularly to Madame Wachner ; and the three walked out of the Club rooms . "
91255	91268	90777	90777	you	79	" Sylvia asked diffidently ; she knew her stout friend disliked walking . "
91273	91279	90777	90777	you	79	" said Monsieur Wachner shortly . "
91307	91460	91461	91461	I	0	" He so seldom interfered or negatived any suggestion that Sylvia felt a little surprised , the more so that it was really a long walk from the Casino to the lonely Châlet des Muguets . But as Madame Wachner had nodded assent to her husband 's words , their English guest said no more . They started out into the moonlit night , Sylvia with her light , springing step keeping pace with L'Ami Fritz , while his wife lagged a step behind . But , as was usual with him , M. Wachner remained silent , while his companions talked . To - night , however , Madame Wachner did not show her usual tact ; she began discussing the two travellers who were now well started , no doubt , on their way to Switzerland , and she expressed contemptuous surprise that the Comte de Virieu had left Lacville . "
91471	91476	91465	91465	e	2215	" she said cheerfully , "
91529	91691	91692	91692	I	0	" As she spoke she laughed coarsely , and Sylvia made no answer . She thought it probable that she would never see the Comte de Virieu again , and the conviction hurt intolerably . It was painful to be reminded of him now , in this way , and by a woman who she knew disliked and despised him . She suddenly felt sorry that she had accepted the Wachner 's invitation . To - night the way to the Châlet des Muguets seemed longer than usual — far longer than it had seemed the last time Sylvia had walked there , when Count Paul had been her companion . It seemed as if an immense time had gone by since then .... Sylvia was glad when at last the three of them came within sight of the familiar white gate . How strangely lonely the little house looked , standing back in the twilit darkness of a summer night . "
91693	91717	91718	91718	I	0	wonder"—Sylvia Bailey looked up at her silent companion , L'Ami Fritz had not opened his lips once during the walk from the Casino , "
91753	91754	91751	91751	she	2220	" "
91761	91766	91751	91751	she	2220	" he answered shortly . "
91789	91800	91777	91779	all sensible people	2222	" Madame Wachner was now on Sylvia 's other side . "
91803	91810	91777	91779	all sensible people	2222	" she interposed , rather breathlessly , "
91851	91852	91838	91838	I	0	" "
91859	91865	91855	91855	I	0	" said Sylvia , smiling . "
91909	91910	91900	91900	I	0	" "
91915	91922	91900	91900	I	0	" said Madame Wachner , heartily , "
91946	91970	91930	91930	rogues	2226	" and Sylvia 's hostess laughed in the darkness her hearty , jovial laugh . Suddenly she bent forward and addressed her husband . "
91989	91997	91979	91979	you	110	" She nodded , explaining to Sylvia , "
92016	92041	92044	92044	I	0	" Sylvia had the instant feeling — she could not have told why — that his wife 's question had greatly annoyed Monsieur Wachner . "
92050	92055	92044	92044	I	0	" he snapped out . "
92062	92063	92044	92044	I	0	" "
92079	92083	92065	92065	I	0	" said Sylvia . "
92152	92153	92147	92147	me	0	" "
92168	92173	92157	92160	the person in question	2236	" said Madame Wachner . "
92194	92334	92157	92160	the person in question	2236	" Monsieur Wachner pushed opened the white gate , and all three began walking up through the garden . The mantle of night now draped every straggling bush , every wilted flower , and the little wilderness was filled with delicious , pungent night scents . When they reached the front door L'Ami Fritz stooped down , and began looking under the mat . Sylvia smiled in the darkness ; there seemed something so primitive , so simple , in keeping the key of one 's front door outside under the mat ! And yet foolish , prejudiced people spoke of Lacville as a dangerous spot , as the plague pit of Paris . Suddenly the door was opened by the day - servant . And both the husband and wife uttered an involuntary exclamation of surprise and displeasure . "
92341	92372	92337	92337	you	0	" asked Madame Wachner harshly . There was a note of dismay , as well as of anger , in her voice . The woman began to excuse herself volubly . "
92396	92397	92386	92386	I	0	" "
92414	92426	92427	92427	You	0	" said her mistress , in a low , quick voice . "
92500	92738	92739	92739	I	0	" The woman turned and threw open the door of the dining - room . Then she struck a match , and lighted a lamp which stood on the table . Sylvia , as is often the case with those who have been much thrown with French people , could understand French much better than she could speak it , and what Madame Wachner had just hissed out in rapid , mumbling tones , surprised and puzzled her . It was quite untrue that she , Sylvia , had to be back at the Villa du Lac by ten o'clock — for the matter of that , she could stay out as long and as late as she liked . Then , again , although the arrangement that she should come to supper at the Châlet des Muguets to - night had been made that afternoon , the Wachners had been home , but they had evidently forgotten to tell their servant that they were expecting a visitor , for only two places were laid in the little dining - room into which they all three walked on entering the house . Propped up against the now lighted lamp was a letter addressed to Monsieur Polperro in a peculiar , large handwriting . L'Ami Fritz , again uttering that queer guttural exclamation , snatched up the envelope , and hurriedly put it into his breast - pocket . "
92751	92760	92739	92739	I	0	" observed the day - servant , cringingly . "
92785	92786	92769	92769	M'sieur	151	" "
92789	92796	92769	92769	M'sieur	151	" said Monsieur Wachner , shortly . "
92816	92856	92857	92857	Fritz	112	" And again Sylvia felt surprised . Surely he had said — or was it Madame Wachner?—that they had arranged for a man to call for it . His wife shouted out his name imperiously from the dark passage , "
92870	92930	92866	92866	I	0	" He hurried out of the room , and Sylvia and the servant were thus left alone together for a few moments in the dining - room . The woman went to the buffet and took up a plate ; she came and placed it noisily on the table , and , under cover of the sound she made , "
92938	92956	92936	92936	Madame	2550	" she whispered , thrusting her wrinkled , sharp - featured face close to the Englishwoman 's . "
92980	93050	92963	92963	you	2550	" Sylvia stared at her distrustfully . This femme de ménage had a disagreeable face ; there was a cunning , avaricious look in her eyes , or so Mrs. Bailey fancied ; no doubt she remembered the couple of francs which had been given to her , or rather extorted by her , on the occasion of the English lady 's last visit to the Châlet des Muguets . "
93057	93072	92963	92963	you	2550	" the servant went on , speaking very quickly , and under her breath . "
93099	93193	93090	93097	not one to want embarrassments with the police	2250	" And Sylvia suddenly remembered that those were exactly the words which had been uttered by Anna Wolsky 's landlady in connection with Anna 's disappearance . How frightened French people seemed to be of the police ! There came the sound of steps in the passage , and the Frenchwoman moved away quickly from Sylvia 's side . She took up the plate she had just placed on the table , and to Sylvia 's mingled disgust and amusement began rubbing it vigorously with her elbow . Monsieur Wachner entered the room . "
93204	93209	93202	93202	Annette	168	" he said patronisingly . "
93246	93247	93250	93250	M'sieur	151	" "
93252	93277	93250	93250	M'sieur	151	" Without looking again at Sylvia the woman went out of the room , and a moment later the front door slammed behind her . "
93318	93347	93311	93311	she	2654	" observed Monsieur Wachner solemnly . Madame Wachner now came in . She had taken off her bonnet and changed her elastic - sided boots for easy slippers . "
93354	93358	93350	93352	those French people	3193	" she exclaimed . "
93378	93384	93370	93370	Annette	168	" She shrugged her shoulders . "
93394	93515	93370	93370	Annette	168	" asked Sylvia ; she left the room before Madame Wachner could answer her , and hurried down the short , dark passage . The door of the moonlit kitchen was ajar , and to her surprise she saw that a large trunk , corded and even labelled , stood in the middle of the floor . Close to the trunk was a large piece of sacking — and by it another coil of thick rope . Was it possible that the Wachners , too , were leaving Lacville ? If so , how very odd of them not to have told her ! As she opened the door of the bed - room Madame Wachner waddled up behind her . "
93520	93524	93370	93370	Annette	168	" she cried . "
93593	93594	93578	93578	Darby	169	" "
93606	93726	93578	93578	Darby	169	" Sylvia was taking off her hat ; she put it , together with a little fancy bag in which she kept the loose gold she played with at the gambling tables , on Madame Wachner 's bed . She felt vaguely uncomfortable , for even as Madame Wachner had spoken she had become aware that the bed - room was almost entirely cleared of everything belonging to its occupants . However , the Wachners , like Anna Wolsky , had the right to go away without telling anyone of their intention . As they came back into the dining - room together , Mrs. Bailey 's host , who was already sitting down at table , looked up . "
93733	93738	93578	93578	Darby	169	" he exclaimed harshly . "
93761	93787	93756	93756	I	0	" Sylvia had never heard the odd , silent man speak in such a tone before , but his wife answered quite good - humouredly , "
93811	93869	93788	93788	You	2258	" And sure enough , within a moment of her saying those words there came a sound of shuffling footsteps on the garden path . Monsieur Wachner got up and went out of the room . He opened the front door , and Sylvia overheard a few words of the colloquy between her host and his messenger . "
93905	93909	93952	93952	M'sieur	151	me"—Monsieur Wachner raised his voice—"to
93929	93946	93919	93919	I	0	" There was a jingle of silver , and then Sylvia caught the man 's answering , "
93954	94001	93952	93952	M'sieur	151	" But L'Ami Fritz did not come back at once to the dining - room . He went out into the garden and accompanied the man down to the gate . When he came back again he put a large key on the dining - table . "
94004	94014	93952	93952	M'sieur	151	" he said , with a grunt of satisfaction . "
94026	94181	93952	93952	M'sieur	151	" They all three sat down at the round dining - table . To Sylvia 's surprise a very simple meal was set out before them . There was only one small dish of galantine . When Sylvia Bailey had been to supper with the Wachners before , there had always been two or three tempting cold dishes , and some dainty friandises as well , the whole evidently procured from the excellent confectioner who drives such a roaring trade at Lacville . To - night , in addition to the few slices of galantine , there was only a little fruit . Then a very odd thing happened . L'Ami Fritz helped first his wife and himself largely , then Sylvia more frugally . It was perhaps a slight matter , the more so that Monsieur Wachner was notoriously forgetful , being ever , according to his wife , absorbed in his calculations and "
94184	94303	94304	94304	Fritz	112	" But all the same , this extraordinary lack of good manners on her host 's part added to Sylvia 's feeling of strangeness and discomfort . Indeed , the Wachners were both very unlike their usual selves this evening . Madame Wachner had suddenly become very serious , her stout red face was set in rather grim , grave lines ; and twice , as Sylvia was eating the little piece of galantine which had been placed on her plate by L'Ami Fritz , she looked up and caught her hostess 's eyes fixed on her with a curious , alien scrutiny . When they had almost finished the meat , Madame Wachner suddenly exclaimed in French . "
94335	94430	94323	94323	You	112	" Monsieur Wachner made no answer . He got up and pulled the drawer of the buffet open . Taking out of it a wooden spoon and fork , he came back to the table and began silently mixing the salad . The two last times Sylvia had been at the Châlet des Muguets , her host , in deference to her English taste , had put a large admixture of vinegar in the salad dressing , but this time she saw that he soused the lettuce - leaves with oil . At last , "
94440	94459	94437	94438	Mrs. Bailey	71	" he said brusquely , and in English . He spoke English far better than did his wife . "
94462	94466	94437	94438	Mrs. Bailey	71	" she said . "
94475	94767	94473	94473	you	112	" And Sylvia , smiling , looked across at Madame Wachner , expecting to see in the older woman 's face a humorous appreciation of the fact that L'Ami Fritz had forgotten her well - known horror of oil . Mrs. Bailey 's dislike of the favourite French salad - dressing ingredient had long been a joke among the three , nay , among the four , for Anna Wolsky had been there the last time Sylvia had had supper with the Wachners . It had been such a merry meal ! To - night no meaning smile met hers ; instead she only saw that odd , grave , considering look on her hostess 's face . Suddenly Madame Wachner held out her plate across the table , and L'Ami Fritz heaped it up with the oily salad . Sylvia Bailey 's plate was empty , but Monsieur Wachner did not seem to notice that his guest lacked anything . And at last , to her extreme astonishment , she suddenly saw him take up one of the two pieces of meat remaining on the dish , and , leaning across , drop it on his wife 's plate . Then he helped himself to the last remaining morsel . It was such a trifling thing really , and due of course to her host 's singular absent - mindedness ; yet , even so , taken in connection with both the Wachners ' silence and odd manner , this lack of the commonest courtesy struck Sylvia with a kind of fear — with fear and with pain . She felt so hurt that the tears came into her eyes . There was a long moment 's pause — then , "
94774	94780	94769	94769	you	2263	" asked Madame Wachner harshly , "
94791	94829	94786	94789	the Comte de Virieu	99	" Her voice had become guttural , full of coarse and cruel malice , and even as she spoke she went on eating voraciously . Sylvia Bailey pushed her chair back , and rose to her feet . "
94838	94843	94830	94830	I	0	" she said quietly , "
94848	94868	94869	94869	I	0	late,"—her voice shook a little . She was desperately afraid of disgracing herself by a childish outburst of tears . "
94883	94935	94878	94881	Monsieur Wachner 's escort	2265	" She saw her host shrug his shoulders . He made a grimace at his wife ; it expressed annoyance , nay , more , extreme disapproval . Madame Wachner also got up . She wiped her mouth with her napkin , and then laid her hand on Sylvia 's shoulder . "
94940	94952	94878	94881	Monsieur Wachner 's escort	2265	" she exclaimed , and this time she spoke quite kindly , "
95081	95082	95073	95073	my	0	" "
95105	95267	95268	95269	Mr. Chester	152	" said Monsieur Wachner solemnly . And then Madame Wachner burst out into a sudden peal of laughter — laughter which was infectious . Sylvia smiled too , and sat down again . After all , as Paul de Virieu had truly said , not once , but many times , the Wachners were not refined people — but they were kind and very good - natured . And then she , Sylvia , was tired and low - spirited to - night — no doubt she had imagined the change in their manner , which had so surprised and hurt her . Madame Wachner was quite her old self again ; just now she was engaged in heaping all the cherries which were in the dessert dish on her guest 's plate , in spite of Sylvia 's eager protest . L'Ami Fritz got up and left the room . He was going into the kitchen to make the coffee . "
95278	95284	95268	95269	Mr. Chester	152	" said Madame Wachner pleasantly . "
95340	95354	95334	95334	you	152	" Sylvia unclasped the string of pearls and laid it on the table . "
95362	95367	95334	95334	you	152	" she said modestly . "
95461	95481	95451	95451	I	0	" Madame Wachner reverentially took up the pearls in her large hand ; she seemed to be weighing them . "
95487	95499	95451	95451	I	0	" she said at length , and now she spoke French . "
95502	95506	95451	95451	I	0	" said Sylvia , "
95518	95519	95507	95507	you	152	" "
95524	95531	95507	95507	you	152	" went on her hostess musingly , "
95556	95557	95553	95553	I	0	" "
95560	95565	95553	95553	I	0	" said Sylvia again , "
95595	95596	95582	95582	You	152	" "
95608	95613	95582	95582	You	152	" observed Madame Wachner , "
95625	95637	95666	95666	you	152	" she was still speaking in that thoughtful , considering tone . "
95646	95652	95666	95666	you	152	" said Sylvia , smiling . "
95721	95722	95711	95711	I	0	" "
95732	95756	95724	95724	you	0	" asked Madame Wachner , this time in English , and fixing her small , dark eyes on the fair Englishwoman 's face . "
95764	95771	95724	95724	you	0	" Sylvia grew a little red . "
95808	95904	95787	95788	Mr. Chester	152	" Through the open door she thought she heard Monsieur Wachner coming back down the passage . So she suddenly took the pearls out of the other woman 's hand and clasped the string about her neck again . L'Ami Fritz came into the room . He was holding rather awkwardly a little tray on which were two cups — one a small cup , the other a large cup , both filled to the brim with black coffee . He put the small cup before his guest , the large cup before his wife . "
95916	95921	95907	95907	you	0	" he said solemnly . "
95946	95951	95938	95938	I	0	" Sylvia looked up . "
95955	95959	95938	95938	I	0	" she exclaimed , "
95997	95998	95991	95991	I	0	" "
96007	96020	96002	96002	you	0	" Madame Wachner spoke good - humouredly , but with great determination . "
96047	96077	96043	96044	L'Ami Fritz	112	mixture"—she laughed heartily . And again ? Sylvia noticed that Monsieur Wachner looked at his wife with a fixed , rather angry look , as much as to say , "
96092	96093	96087	96087	you	0	" "
96110	96145	96150	96150	I	0	" Sylvia had suddenly seen a vision of herself lying wide awake during long dark hours — hours which , as she knew by experience , generally bring to the sleepless , worrying thoughts . "
96160	96164	96150	96150	I	0	" she repeated . "
96176	96183	96172	96172	you	0	" Madame Wachner spoke very persuasively . "
96258	96404	96236	96236	He	112	" The coffee did look very tempting and fragrant . Sylvia had always disliked coffee in England , but somehow French coffee was quite different ; it had quite another taste from that of the mixture which the ladies of Market Dalling pressed on their guests at their dinner - parties . She lifted the pretty little cup to her lips — but the coffee , this coffee of L'Ami Fritz , his special mixture , as his wife had termed it , had a rather curious taste , it was slightly bitter — decidedly not so nice as that which she was accustomed to drink each day after déjeuner at the Villa du Lac . Surely it would be very foolish to risk a bad night for a small cup of indifferent coffee ? She put the cup down , and pushed it away . "
96414	96419	96236	96236	He	112	" she said firmly . "
96428	96439	96236	96236	He	112	" Madame Wachner shrugged her shoulders with an angry gesture . "
96444	96452	96453	96453	Fritz	112	" she said , and then imperiously , "
96476	96655	96469	96469	I	0	" He got up and silently obeyed his wife . Before leaving the room he slipped the key of the garden gate into his trousers pocket . A moment later Sylvia , left alone , could hear them talking eagerly to one another in that strange , unknown tongue in which they sometimes — not often — addressed one another . She got up from her chair , seized with a sudden , eager desire to slip away before they came back . For a moment she even thought of leaving the house without waiting for her hat and little fancy bag ; and then , with a strange sinking of the heart she remembered that the white gate was locked , and that L'Ami Fritz had now the key of it in his pocket . But in no case would Sylvia have had time to do what she had thought of doing , for a moment later her host and hostess were back in the room . Madame Wachner sat down again at the dining - table , "
96659	96666	96469	96469	I	0	" she exclaimed , rather breathlessly . "
96690	96785	96682	96683	L'Ami Fritz	112	" Rather unwillingly , Sylvia again sat down . Monsieur Wachner was paying no attention either to his guest or to his wife . He took up the chair on which he had been sitting , and placed it out of the way near the door . Then he lifted the lighted lamp off the table and put it on the buffet . As he did so , Sylvia , looking up , saw the shadow of his tall , lank figure thrown grotesquely , hugely , against the opposite wall of the room . "
96794	96852	96682	96683	L'Ami Fritz	112	" he said curtly . And his wife , gulping down the last drops of her coffee , got up and obeyed him . Sylvia suddenly realised that they were getting ready for something — that they wanted the room cleared . As with quick , deft fingers she folded up the cloth , Madame Wachner exclaimed , "
96877	97300	96861	96861	Sylvia	67	" Sylvia Bailey looked across at the speaker , and reddened deeply . She felt very angry . Never in the course of her pleasant , easy , prosperous life had anyone ventured to dismiss her in this fashion from their house . She rose , for the second time during the course of her short meal , to her feet — And then , in a flash , there occurred that which transformed her anger into agonised fear — fear and terror . The back of her neck had been grazed by something sharp and cold , and as she gave a smothered cry she saw that her string of pearls had parted in two . The pearls were now falling quickly one by one , and rolling all over the floor . Instinctively she bent down , but as she did so she heard the man behind her make a quick movement . She straightened herself and looked sharply round . L'Ami Fritz was still holding in his hand the small pair of nail scissors with which he had snipped asunder her necklace ; with the other he was in the act of taking out something from the drawer of the buffet . She suddenly saw what that something was . Sylvia Bailey 's nerves steadied ; her mind became curiously collected and clear . There had leapt on her the knowledge that this man and woman meant to kill her — to kill her for the sake of the pearls which were still bounding about the floor , and for the comparatively small sum of money which she carried slung in the leather bag below her waist . L'Ami Fritz now stood staring at her . He had put his right hand — the hand holding the thing he had taken out of the drawer — behind his back . He was very pale ; the sweat had broken out on his sallow , thin face . For a horrible moment there floated across Sylvia 's sub - conscious mind the thought of Anna Wolsky , and of what she now knew to have been Anna Wolsky 's fate . But she put that thought , that awful knowledge , determinedly away from her . The instinct of self - preservation possessed her wholly . Already , in far less time than it would have taken to formulate the words , she had made up her mind to speak , and she knew exactly what she meant to say . "
97309	97330	96861	96861	Sylvia	67	" Sylvia said , quietly . Her voice shook a little , but otherwise she spoke in her usual tone . "
97351	97361	97343	97343	you	2282	" The man looked questioningly across at his wife . "
97370	97379	97343	97343	you	2282	" he said , in his guttural voice . "
97382	97389	97343	97343	you	2282	" exclaimed Madame Wachner , decidedly , "
97417	97422	97425	97425	Sylvia	67	" she said imperiously . "
97434	97484	97425	97425	Sylvia	67	" She made a gesture as if she also meant to bend down .... But Sylvia Bailey made no attempt to obey the sinister order . Slowly , warily she edged herself towards the closed window . At last she stood with her back to it — at bay . "
97487	97492	97425	97425	Sylvia	67	" she said quietly , "
97544	97581	97541	97542	Ami Fritz	110	" and there was a tone of pleading , for the first time of pitiful fear , in her soft voice . She looked at him piteously , her large blue eyes wide open , dilated — "
97595	97746	97541	97542	Ami Fritz	110	" exclaimed Madame Wachner harshly . She stepped forward and gripped Sylvia by the arm , pulling her violently forward . As she did so she made a sign to her husband , and he pushed a chair quickly between Mrs. Bailey and the window . Sylvia had lost her point of vantage , but she was young and lithe ; she kept her feet . Nevertheless , she knew with a cold , reasoned knowledge that she was very near to death — that it was only a question of minutes,—unless — unless she could make the man and woman before her understand that they would gain far more money by allowing her to live than by killing her now , to - night , for the value of the pearls that lay scattered on the floor , and the small , the pitiably small sum on her person . "
97754	97760	97748	97748	you	2285	" she said , desperately , "
97774	97797	97763	97763	I	0	" Madame Wachner suddenly laid her hand on Sylvia 's arm , and tried to force her down on to her knees . "
97805	97811	97800	97800	you	2285	" she cried , furiously . "
97822	97937	97800	97800	you	2285	" She looked across at her husband , and there burst from her lips a torrent of words , uttered in the uncouth tongue which the Wachners used for secrecy . Sylvia tried desperately to understand , but she could make nothing of the strange , rapid - spoken syllables — until there fell on her ear , twice repeated , the name Wolsky .... Madame Wachner stepped suddenly back , and as she did so L'Ami Fritz moved a step forward . Sylvia looked at him , an agonised appeal in her eyes . He was smiling hideously , a nervous grin zig - zagging across his large , thin - lipped mouth . "
97945	97951	97938	97938	You	2285	" he muttered in English . "
97962	98147	98148	98148	I	0	" He put out his left hand , and the long , strong fingers closed , tentacle - wise , on her slender shoulder . His right hand he kept still hidden behind his back — The great open - air restaurant in the Champs Élysées was full of foreigners , and Paul de Virieu and Bill Chester were sitting opposite to one another on the broad terrace dotted with little tables embowered in flowering shrubs . They were both smoking,—the Englishman a cigar , the Frenchman a cigarette . It was now half - past seven , and instead of taking the first express to Switzerland they had decided to have dinner comfortably in Paris and to go on by a later train . Neither man felt that he had very much to say to the other , and Chester started a little in his seat when Paul de Virieu suddenly took his cigarette out of his mouth , put it down on the table , and leant forward . He looked at the man sitting opposite to him straight in the eyes . "
98165	98228	98229	98229	You	2290	" he said , deliberately . Chester stared back at him , telling himself angrily as he did so that he did not in the least know what the Frenchman was driving at ! What did Paul de Virieu mean by saying this stupid , obvious thing , and why should he drag in the question of his being happy or unhappy ? "
98244	98256	98232	98232	I	0	" said Chester shortly . Then , very deliberately he added , "
98316	98353	98309	98309	She	71	" He stopped abruptly , for he had no wish to discuss Sylvia and Sylvia 's affairs with this foreigner , however oddly intimate Mrs. Bailey had allowed herself to get with the Comte de Virieu . "
98362	98369	98309	98309	She	71	" observed the Count , meditatively . "
98387	98462	98384	98385	Mr. Chester	152	" The English lawyer thought the remark too obvious to answer . Of course Lacville was a queer place — to put it plainly , little better than a gambling hell . He knew that well enough ! But it was rather strange to hear the Comte de Virieu saying so — a real case , if ever there was one , of Satan rebuking sin . So at last he answered , irritably , "
98483	98503	98474	98475	Mrs. Bailey	71	" His mind was full of Sylvia . He seemed to go on speaking of her against his will . "
98513	98521	98504	98504	Her	71	" explained Paul de Virieu , quickly . "
98573	98793	98795	98795	you	2302	" Bill Chester tilted back the chair on which he was sitting . Once more he asked himself what on earth the fellow was driving at ? Were these remarks a preliminary to the Count 's saying that he was not going to Switzerland after all — that he was going back to Lacville in order to take care of Sylvia . Quite suddenly the young Englishman felt shaken by a very primitive and , till these last few days , a very unfamiliar feeling — that of jealousy . Damn it — he would n't have that . Of course he was no longer in love with Sylvia Bailey , but he was her trustee and lifelong friend . It was his duty to prevent her making a fool of herself , either by gambling away her money — the good money the late George Bailey had toiled so hard to acquire — or , what would be ever so much worse , by making some wretched marriage to a foreign adventurer . He stared suspiciously at his companion . Was it likely that a real count — the French equivalent to an English earl — would lead the sort of life this man , Paul de Virieu , was leading , and in a place like Lacville ? "
98823	98886	98803	98803	I	0	" He stared hard at the Count , and noted with sarcastic amusement the other 's appearance — so foppish , so effeminate to English eyes ; particularly did he gaze with scorn at the Count 's yellow silk socks , which matched his lemon - coloured tie and silk pocket handkerchief . Fancy starting for a long night journey in such a "
98891	98947	98803	98803	I	0	" Well ! Perhaps women liked that sort of thing , but he would never have thought Sylvia Bailey to be that sort of woman . A change came over Paul de Virieu 's face . There was unmistakable relief — nay , more — even joy in the voice with which the Frenchman answered , "
99056	99057	99060	99063	that funny old couple	2311	" "
99086	99098	99099	99100	The Wachners	114	" observed Chester . Paul de Virieu shook his head decidedly . "
99106	99111	99112	99112	They	114	" he said slowly . "
99206	99219	99191	99191	they	114	" The Count lowered his voice , and leant over the table . "
99224	99227	99191	99191	they	114	" he went on—"nay
99309	99341	99301	99301	they	114	" Chester looked across at his companion . At last he was really impressed . Blackmailing is a word which has a very ugly sound in an English lawyer 's ears . "
99348	99353	99301	99301	they	114	" he said suddenly , "
99378	99379	99380	99380	You	0	" "
99394	99469	99380	99380	You	0	" said Paul de Virieu , drily . He also had suddenly experienced a thrill of that primitive passion , jealousy , which had surprised Chester but a few moments before . But the Count was a Frenchman . He was familiar with the sensation — nay , he welcomed it . It showed that he was still young — still worthy to be one of the great company of lovers . Sylvia , his "
99474	99726	99380	99380	You	0	" seemed to have come very near to him in the last few moments . He saw her blue eyes brim with tears at his harsh words — he thrilled as he had thrilled with the overmastering impulse which had made him take her into his arms — her hand lay once more in his hand , as it had lain , for a moment this morning . Had he grasped and retained that kind , firm little hand in his , an entirely new life had been within his reach . A vision rose before Paul de Virieu — a vision of Sylvia and himself living heart to heart in one of those small , stately manor - houses which are scattered throughout Brittany . And it was no vague house of dreams . He knew the little château very well . Had not his sister driven him there only the other day ? And had she not conveyed to him in delicate , generous words how gladly she would see his sweet English friend established there as châtelaine ? A sense of immeasurable loss came over Paul de Virieu — But , no , he had been right ! Quite right ! He loved Sylvia far too well to risk making her as unhappy as he would almost certainly be tempted to make her , if she became his wife . He took off his hat and remained silent for what seemed to his companion quite a long time . "
99740	99746	99733	99734	Mrs. Bailey	71	" he asked at last . "
99751	99755	99733	99734	Mrs. Bailey	71	" replied Chester . "
99796	99802	99788	99788	her	71	" He added , stiffly , "
99827	99911	99818	99818	They	2776	" Paul de Virieu shrugged his shoulders . He felt suddenly uneasy — afraid he hardly knew of what . There was no risk that Sylvia Bailey would fall a victim to blackmailers — she had nothing to be ashamed of , nothing to conceal . But still he hated to think that she was , even now , alone with a man and woman of whom he had formed such a bad impression . He took his watch out of his pocket . "
99924	99929	99818	99818	They	2776	" he said slowly . "
99944	99945	99818	99818	They	2776	" "
99957	99980	99948	99948	you	2331	" There was that sarcastic inflection in the Englishman 's voice which the Count had learned to look for and to resent . "
99983	99997	99948	99948	you	2331	" Count Paul looked at Bill Chester significantly , and his look said , "
100036	100086	100087	100087	I	0	" During the short train journey back to Lacville they hardly spoke . Each thought that the other was doing a strange and unreasonable thing — a thing which the thinker could have done much better if left to himself . At Lacville station they jumped into a victoria . "
100100	100106	100087	100087	I	0	" said Chester , hesitatingly . "
100204	100216	100194	100194	I	0	" Paul de Virieu spoke in a constrained , preoccupied voice . "
100237	100308	100194	100194	I	0	" Chester 's voice unwittingly became far more cordial ; if the Frenchman did not wish to see Sylvia , why had he insisted on coming back , too , to Lacville . The hall of the Villa du Lac was brightly lit up , and as the victoria swept up the short drive to the stone horseshoe stairway , the Comte de Virieu suddenly grasped the other 's hand . "
100312	100316	100194	100194	I	0	" he exclaimed , "
100356	100458	100336	100336	he	2342	" Chester was rather touched , as well as surprised . But what queer , emotional fellows Frenchmen are to be sure ! Although Count Paul , as Sylvia used to call him , had evidently been a little bit in love with her himself , he was quite willing to think of her as married to another man ! But — but there was the rub ! Chester was no longer so sure that he wanted to marry Sylvia . She had become a different woman — she seemed to be another Sylvia to the one he had always known . "
100473	100480	100459	100459	I	0	" he said a little awkwardly . "
100505	100506	100495	100496	Mrs. Bailey	71	" "
100511	100516	100520	100520	she	71	" muttered the other . "
100524	100582	100520	100520	she	71	" Chester jumped out of the carriage and ran quickly up the stone steps , and rang the bell . The door was opened by M. Polperro himself . Even busier than usual was the merry , capable little chef , for as it happened Madame Polperro had had to go away for two or three days . "
100588	100593	100520	100520	she	71	" said Chester abruptly , "
100621	100622	100623	100623	I	0	" "
100633	100816	100629	100629	I	0	" M. Polperro did not know what to make of this big Englishman who had come in out of the night , bringing no luggage with him but one little bag . Then he suddenly remembered ! Why , of course , this was the friend of the pretty , charming , wealthy Madame Bailey ; the English gentleman who had been staying during the past few days at the Pension Malfait ! A gentleman who was called after a well - known cheese — yes , Chester was his name . Then this Mr. Chester 's departure from Lacville had been a fausse sortie — a ruse to get rid of the Comte de Virieu , who was also in love with the lovely young English widow ? Ah ! Ah ! M. Polperro felt very much amused . Never had he heard of anything so droll ! But the Englishman 's tale of love was not to run smooth after all , for now another complication had arisen , and the very last one any sensible man would have expected ! "
100821	100827	100819	100819	M'sieur	151	" said M. Polperro demurely , "
100851	100861	100838	100838	you	0	but"—he hesitated , and with a sly look added , "
100890	100891	100886	100887	Madame Bailey	67	" "
100898	100902	100886	100887	Madame Bailey	67	" echoed Chester . "
100913	100914	100904	100905	Mrs. Bailey	71	" "
100939	100983	100937	100937	her	67	" The little man could hardly keep serious . Oh ! those Englishmen , who are said to be so cold ! When in love they behave just like other people . For Chester was staring at him with puzzled , wrathful eyes . "
101025	101035	101021	101021	M'sieur	151	" He really could not resist that last thrust . "
101039	101044	101021	101021	M'sieur	151	" repeated Chester incredulously . "
101089	101090	101079	101079	you	151	" "
101095	101096	101079	101079	you	151	" "
101104	101105	101098	101098	you	151	" "
101110	101488	101098	101098	you	151	" M. Polperro , followed closely by the Englishman , trotted off into his office , a funny little hole of a place which had been contrived under the staircase . It was here that Madame Polperro was supposed to spend her busy days . M. Polperro felt quite lost without his wife . Slowly , methodically , he began to turn over the papers on the writing - table , which , with one chair , filled up all the place . There had evidently been a lovers ' quarrel between these two peculiar English people . What a pity that the gentleman , who had very properly returned to beg the lady 's pardon , had found his little bird flown — in such poetic terms did the landlord in his own mind refer to Sylvia Bailey . The pretty Englishwoman 's presence in the Villa du Lac had delighted M. Polperro 's southern , sentimental mind ; he felt her to be so decorative , as well as so lucrative , a guest for his beloved hotel . Mrs. Bailey had never questioned any of the extras Madame Polperro put in her weekly bills , and she had never become haggard and cross as other ladies did who lost money at the Casino . As he turned over the papers — bills , catalogues , and letters with which the table was covered , these thoughts flitted regretfully through M. Polperro 's mind . But he had an optimistic nature , and though he was very sorry Madame Bailey had left the Villa du Lac so abruptly , he was gratified by the fact that she had lived up to the ideal he had formed of his English guest . Though Madame Bailey had paid her weekly bill only two days before — she was en pension by the day — she had actually sent him a hundred francs to pay for the two days ' board ; the balance to be distributed among the servants .... There could surely be no harm in giving this big Englishman the lady 's letter ? Still , M. Polperro was sorry that he had not Madame Polperro at his elbow to make the decision for him . "
101493	101509	101510	101510	I	0	" he said at last , taking a piece of paper out of the drawer . "
101539	101578	101537	101537	himself	151	" Chester took the folded - up piece of notepaper out of the little Frenchman 's hand with a strange feeling of misgiving . He came out into the hall and stood under the cut - glass chandelier — "
101585	101590	101579	101579	You	2654	" he exclaimed quickly ; "
101599	101600	101594	101595	Mrs. Bailey	71	" "
101629	101663	101619	101620	the lady	490	" Chester looked down to where the man 's fat finger pointed . In the strange , the alien handwriting , were written two words which for a moment conveyed nothing to Chester , "

101669	101735	101736	101737	Monsieur Polperro	137	" ; as for the writing , stiff , angular , large , it resembled Sylvia 's sloping English caligraphy as little as did the two words purporting to be her signature resemble the right spelling of her name . A thrill of fear , of terrifying suspicion , flooded Bill Chester 's shrewd but commonplace mind . Slowly he read the strange letter through : "
101747	101835	101836	101836	Yours	2364	" I am leaving Lacville this evening in order to join my friend Madame Wolsky . I request you therefore to send on my luggage to the cloak room at the Gare du Nord . I enclose a hundred - franc note to pay you what I owe . Please distribute the rest of the money among the servants . I beg to inform you that I have been exceedingly comfortable at the Villa du Lac , and I will recommend your hotel to all my friends . "
101840	101844	101847	101847	his	2365	" Sylvea Baylee . "
101888	101891	101894	101896	Paul de Virieu	99	" Well ? "
101898	101909	101911	101911	Chester	79	" Come into the house — now , at once ! "
101915	101921	101911	101911	Chester	79	" Something extraordinary has happened ! "
101959	101969	101971	101971	Chester	79	" This letter purports to be from Sylvia Bailey , "
101974	102026	101971	101971	Chester	79	" but of course it is nothing of the sort ! She never wrote a line of it . It 's entirely unlike her handwriting — and then look at the absurd signature ! What does it mean , Virieu ? Can you give me any clue to what it means ? "
102096	102107	102109	102110	Count Paul	94	" Yes , I think I know what it means , "
102115	102164	102165	102165	He	94	" A letter like this purported to come from Madame Wolsky when she disappeared . But do not let us make a scene here . Let us go at once where I believe she is , for if what I fear is true every moment is of value . "
102182	102188	102189	102189	he	94	" Get into the carriage , "
102194	102201	102189	102189	he	94	" I will see to everything . "
102214	102223	102225	102226	Count Paul	94	" We may need two or three gendarmes , "
102228	102237	102225	102226	Count Paul	94	" It 's worth the three minutes delay . "
102257	102260	102261	102262	The Count	619	" Gendarmerie . "
102291	102302	102303	102303	he	619	" We must make room for these good fellows somehow , "
102346	102350	102352	102353	the Count	619	" And now , "
102358	102379	102352	102353	the Count	619	" five louis , my friend , if you can get us to the Châlet des Muguets in seven minutes — "
102414	102424	102427	102428	the Englishman	156	" If the man does n't drive more carefully , "
102430	102448	102427	102428	the Englishman	156	" we shall be spilt — and that wo n't do us any good , will it ? "
102454	102478	102449	102450	The Count	619	" If there 's an accident you get nothing , my friend ! Drive as quickly as you like , but drive carefully . "
102639	102670	102636	102636	his	94	" Speak , Mr. Chester , speak as loud as you can ! Shout ! Say anything that you like ! They may as well hear that we are coming — "
102707	102795	102693	102693	he	152	" We are going to pay an evening call — what you in England call an evening call ! We are going to fetch our friend — our friend , Mrs. Bailey ; she is so charming , so delightful ! We are going to fetch her because she has been spending the evening with her friends , the Wachners . That old she - devil — you remember her , surely ? The woman who asked you concerning your plans ? It is she I fear — "
102796	102805	102806	102807	the man	185	" Je crois que c'est ici , Monsieur ? "
102814	102823	102806	102807	the man	185	" I have done it in six minutes ! "
102891	102904	102906	102907	the Count	619	" We are in time . Thank God we are in time , "
102917	102942	102914	102914	his	619	" If we were not in time , there would be no light . The house of the wicked ones would be in darkness . "
102957	103001	102949	102949	he	619	" You had better all three stay in the garden , while my friend and I go up to the house . If we are gone more than five minutes , then you follow us up to the house and get in somehow ! "
103011	103016	102949	102949	he	619	" Oui , M'sieur . "
103105	103110	103111	103114	the old military watchword	2412	" Qui va là ? "
103189	103194	103195	103195	she	67	" Who goes there ? "
103201	103225	103195	103195	she	67	" I fear , Messieurs , that you have made a mistake . You have taken this villa for someone else 's house ! "
103238	103250	103235	103235	her	67	" It is I , Paul de Virieu , Madame Wachner . "
103275	103314	103315	103315	He	619	" I have brought Mr. Chester with me , for we have come to fetch Mrs. Bailey . In Paris Mr. Chester found news making her return home to England to - morrow a matter of imperative necessity . "
103330	103343	103345	103345	he	619	" We have proof that she is spending the evening with you , "
103359	103367	103368	103368	he	619	" If they deny she is there , "
103374	103401	103368	103368	he	619	" we will shout for the gendarmes and break in . But I doubt if they will dare to deny she is there unless — unless — "
103492	103500	103502	103503	Monsieur Wachner	111	" I pray you to come in , "
103514	103584	103589	103589	he	111	" I am pleased to see you , sir , the more so that your friend , Mrs. Bailey , is indisposed . A moment ago , to our deep concern , she found herself quite faint — no doubt from the heat . I will conduct you , gentlemen , into the drawing - room ; my wife and Mrs. Bailey will join us there in a minute , "
103828	103833	103834	103834	she	67	" Such a misfortune ! "
103839	103968	103969	103969	She	67	" Such a very great misfortune ! The necklace of our friend ' as broken , and ' er beautiful pearls are rolling all over the floor ! We ' ave been trying , Fritz and myself , to pick them up for ' er . Is not that so , Sylvia ? Mrs. Bailey is so distressed ! It ' as made ' er feel very faint , what English people call ' queer ' . But I tell ' er we shall find them all — it is only a matter of a little time . I asked ' er to take some cognac my ' usband keeps for such bad moments , but no , she would not ! Is not that so , Sylvia ? "
104013	104016	104017	104017	she	67	" Yes , "
104021	104045	104017	104017	she	67	" the string of my pearls broke . I was taken faint . I felt horribly queer — perhaps it was the heat . "
104075	104078	104068	104068	him	94	" queer . "
104392	104395	104396	104396	he	79	" Sylvia , "
104401	104455	104396	104396	he	79	" I suppose we ought to be going now . We have a carriage waiting at the gate , so we shall be able to drive you back to the Villa du Lac . But , of course , we must first pick up all your pearls . That wo n't take long ! "
104542	104561	104562	104562	he	112	" I did not think you would want to go back into my wife 's bed - room , "
104663	104674	104675	104675	he	112	" This is the best way to find the pearls , "
104762	104765	104766	104766	he	111	" There , "
104775	104783	104766	104766	he	111	" I think they are all there . "
104919	104925	104926	104926	she	67	" They killed Anna Wolsky , "
104929	104957	104926	104926	she	67	" She is lying buried in the wood , where they meant to put me if you had not come just — only just — in time ! "
105057	105065	105066	105067	the Count	619	" I forbid you to touch her ! "
105100	105150	105087	105089	Paul de Virieu	94	" You will remember the disappearance from Lacville of a Polish lady ? I have reason to believe these people murdered her . When once I have placed Madame Bailey under medical care , I will return here . Meanwhile you , of course , know what to do . "
105151	105164	105087	105089	Paul de Virieu	94	" But M'sieur , ought I not to detain this English lady ? "
105165	105214	105087	105089	Paul de Virieu	94	" Certainly not . I make myself responsible for her . She is in no state to bear an interrogation . Lock up these people in separate rooms . I will send you reinforcements , and to - morrow morning dig up the little wood behind the house . "
105235	105242	105245	105245	Chester	79	" Are you coming , Sylvia ? "
105350	105358	105359	105360	the Count	619	" To Paris , Hôtel du Louvre , "
105367	105380	105382	105382	he	94	" You can take as long as you like over the journey ! "
105388	105396	105397	105397	he	94	" The air will do her good , "
105600	105605	105606	105606	he	94	" Speak to her , "
105613	105634	105606	105606	he	94	" Take her hand and try to rouse her , Mr. Chester . I feel very anxious about her condition . "
105695	105700	105701	105701	he	726	" My dear girl ! "
105704	105727	105701	105701	he	726	" I 'm afraid those people frightened you badly ? I suppose you began to suspect they meant to steal your pearls ? "
105796	105800	105802	105804	Paul de Virieu	94	" My God ! "
105806	105826	105802	105804	Paul de Virieu	94	" Do you not understand , Chester , what happened to - night ? They meant to kill her ! "
105827	105832	105834	105834	Chester	152	" To kill her ? "
105873	105876	105877	105877	he	94	" Sylvia ! "
105880	105908	105877	105877	he	94	" Rouse yourself , and tell us what took place ! If what the Count says is true , something must be done , and at once ! "
105916	105937	105909	105909	He	94	" The police ought to take Mrs. Bailey 's full statement of all that occurred without any loss of time ! "
105963	105974	105975	105975	she	67	" Oh , Bill , let me try to forget ! "
105989	105995	105986	105986	she	67	" They killed Anna Wolsky — "
106007	106038	106001	106001	she	67	" I would not think of her — I forced myself not to think of her — but now I shall never , never think of anyone else any more ! "
106098	106108	106109	106109	he	94	" You must not say that , ma chérie , "
106127	106147	106109	106109	he	94	" it would be too cruel to the living , to those who love you — who adore you . "
106165	106263	106149	106149	he	94	" Do not be afraid , Mr. Chester , those infamous people shall not be allowed to escape ! Poor Madame Wolsky shall surely be avenged . But Mrs. Bailey will not be asked to make any statement , except in writing — in what you in England call an affidavit . You do not realise , although you doubtless know , what our legal procedure is like . Not even in order to secure the guillotine for Madame Wachner and her Fritz would I expose Mrs. Bailey to the ordeal of our French witness - box . "
106264	106275	106277	106277	Chester	152	" And how will it be possible to avoid it ? "
106318	106358	106304	106304	he	94	" I have an announcement to make to you , Mr. Chester . It is one which I trust will bring me your true congratulations . Mrs. Bailey is about to do me the honour of becoming my wife . "
106369	106391	106359	106359	He	94	" I am giving her an undertaking , a solemn promise by all I hold most sacred , to abandon play — "
106554	106560	106561	106561	he	152	" I do congratulate you , "
106568	106576	106561	106561	he	152	" you deserve your great good fortune . "
106586	106599	106582	106582	he	152	" My dear , it is to him you owe your life . "
