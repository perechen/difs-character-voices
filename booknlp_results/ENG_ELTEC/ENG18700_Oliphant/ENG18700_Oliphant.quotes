2481	2646	2447	2447	I	0	" Just at present colonial bishops are rather scarce articles , and I have never heard of one in England with a palace , though there are a good many of them dotted about in snug livings , retaining only their lawn sleeves , either to laugh in or remind them of the dignity and the hardships of which they did not die abroad . Their temptations are of a totally different nature from theirs who are members of the House of Peers , and they must be treated apart ; in fact , you will have to take them with the missionaries and colonial clergy . I quite agree with you that if there is one thing that is more urgently needed than a missionary to the ball - room , it is a missionary to the missionaries ; and as you have had so much experience of their operations abroad , you might become a very useful labourer in the ecclesiastical vineyard . "
2671	2674	2675	2675	I	0	" Why , "
2679	2803	2675	2675	I	0	" should there be a set of men who preach to others , and are never preached at themselves ? Every class and condition of life has its peculiar snares and temptations , and one class is set apart to point them out — surely there should be somebody to perform that kind office for them which they do for others . He who is paid to find out the mote that is in his brother 's eye , and devotes his energies to its discovery , is of all men the one who requires the most kind and faithful friend to show him the beam which is in his own . I will be that friend , and charge nothing for it , "
2822	2827	2828	2828	he	110	" My impulsive friend , "
2831	2977	2828	2828	he	110	" this is a very serious subject ; we must beware lest we fall into the error which we blame in others . It is one thing to see the need of the missionary , it is another to rush headlong upon the work . However , I am able to offer you an opportunity of beginning at once , for I have just come to tell you that Dickiefield has given us a joint invitation to go down to - morrow to Dickiefield , to stay till Parliament opens ; we shall be certain to find a choice assortment of pagan and theological curiosities in that most agreeable of country - houses , and you may possibly meet the identical colonial bishop at whose palace you proposed staying . The three o'clock train lands us exactly in time for dinner . Will you come ? "

3410	3502	3406	3406	he	336	" My parents were both Hindoos . Before I was converted my other name was Juggonath ; now I am John . I became acquainted with a circle of dear Christian friends in Bombay , during my connection , as catechist , with the Tabernacle Missionary Society , was peculiarly favoured in some mercantile transactions into which I subsequently entered in connection with cotton , and have come to spend my fortune , and enter public life , in this country . I was just expressing to our dear friend here , "
3512	3546	3406	3406	he	336	" my regret at finding that he shares in views which are becoming so prevalent in the Church , and are likely to taint the Protestantism of Great Britain and part of Ireland . "

3623	3793	3621	3621	Dickiefield	120	" he is not so unsound as he looks , and he is not unique , like the other . I flatter myself I have under my roof the only well - authenticated instance of the Hindoo converted millionaire . It is true he became a ' Government Christian ' when he was a poor boy of fifteen , and began life as a catechist ; then he saw a good mercantile opening , and went into cotton , out of which he has realised an immense fortune , and now is going into political life in England , which he could not have done in an unconverted condition . Who ever heard before of a Bombay man wanting to get into Parliament , and coming home with a carte du pays all arranged before he started ? He advocates extension of the franchise , ballot , and the Evangelical Alliance , so I thought I would fasten him on to Broadhem — they'll help to float each other . "
3794	3803	3804	3804	I	0	" Who else have you got here besides ? "
3807	3890	3804	3804	I	0	" Oh , only a petroleum aristocrat from the oil regions of America — another millionaire . He is a more wonderful instance even than Chundango , for he was a poor man three months ago , when he ' struck oil . ' You will find him most intelligent , full of information ; but you will look upon him , of course , as the type of the peculiar class to which he belongs , and not of Americans generally . "

I understand that his great wealth , so far from having proved a snare to him , has enabled him to join in many companies for the improvement of Bombay , and that his theological views are quite unexceptionable .

5438	5638	5435	5435	I	0	" I can guess what it is ; he is a little too Radical for you , but you must not mind that ; depend upon it , an ambitious young peer ca n't do better than ally himself with the Manchester school . They have plenty of talent , but have failed as yet to make much impression upon the country for lack of an aristocrat . It is like a bubble company in the City ; they want a nobleman as chairman to give an air of respectability to the direction . He might perhaps be a prophet without honour if he remained in his own country , so he is quite right to go to Manchester . I look upon cotton , backed by Exeter Hall , as so strong a combination , that they would give an immense start in public life to a young man with great family prestige , even of small abilities ; but as Broadhem has good natural talents , and is in the Upper House into the bargain , the move , in a strategical point of view , so far as his future career is concerned , is perfect . "
5639	5649	5651	5652	Lady Ursula	124	" I can not tell you , Lord Frank , "
5654	5791	5792	5792	she	124	" how distressed I am to hear you talk in this way . As a woman , I suppose I am not competent to discuss politics ; and if Broadhem conscientiously believes in manhood suffrage and the Low Church , and considers it his duty before God to lose no opportunity of propagating his opinions , I should be the first to urge his using all the influence which his name and wealth give him in what would then become a sacred duty ; but the career that you talk about is not a sacred duty . It is a wretched Will - o'-the - wisp that tempts men to wade through mire in its pursuit , not the bright star fixed above them in the heavens to light up their path . I firmly believe , "
5803	6013	6014	6014	She	376	" that that one word ' Career , ' has done more to demoralise public men than any other word in the language . It is one embodiment of that selfishness which we are taught from our cradles . Boys go to school with strict injunctions if possible to put self at the top of it . They take the highest honours at the university purely for the sake of self . How can we expect when they get into Parliament that they should think of anything but self , until at last the most conscientious of them is only conscientious by contrast ? Who is there that ever tells them that personal ambition is a sin the most hateful in the sight of God , the first and not the last ' infirmity of noble minds ' ? I know you think me foolish and unpractical , and will tell me mine is an impossible standard ; but I do n't believe in impossible standards where public morality is concerned . At all events , let us make some attempt in an upward direction ; and as a first step I propose to banish from the vocabulary that most pernicious of all words , ' A Career . ' "

6608	6611	6612	6612	I	0	" Yes , "
6623	6842	6843	6843	I	0	" Well , just as I struck oil , one of your English lords came over there for the purpose of what he called ' getting up petroleum ' and we were roommates in the same hotel for some time , and got quite friendly ; and when he saw my new kerosene lamp , and found I was coming to have it patented in this country , he promised to help me to get up a Patent Lamp Company , and gave me letters to some of your leading aristocracy ; so , before leaving , I saw the President , and told him I would report on the state of feeling in your highest circles about our war . We know what it is in your oppressed classes , but it ai nt every one has a chance , like me , of finding out how many copperheads there are among your lords . My father , sir , you may have heard of by name — Appollonius T. Wog , the founder , and , I may say , the father of the celebrated ' Pollywog Convention , ' which was named after him , and which unfortunately burst up just in time to be too late to save our country from bursting up too . "
6876	6881	6882	6882	he	131	" Well , sir , "
6885	6969	6882	6882	he	131	" I have only been here a few days , and I have seen considerable people ; but none of them were noblemen , and they are the class I have to report upon . The Earl of Broadhem , here , is the first with whom I have conversed , and he informs me that he has just come from one of your universities , and that the sympathies of the great majority of your rising youth are entirely with the North . "
6970	6996	7060	7060	he	131	" You may report to your Government that the British youth of the present day , hot from the university , are very often prigs . "

7008	7024	7005	7006	Mr Wog	131	" the last word , however , is one with which I am not acquainted . "

7661	7698	7652	7653	Mr Wog	131	" and as I do n't know where Piccadilly is , I 'll just ask the Bishop to bring me along . There is a good deal of law going on between your bishops just now , "
7705	7816	7699	7701	our American friend	406	" and I should like to know the rights of it . We in our country consider that your Ecclesiastical Court is a most remarkable institution for a Christian land . Why sir , law is strictly prohibited in a certain place ; and it seems to me that you might as well talk of a good devil as a religious court . If it is wrong for a layman to go to law , it must be wrong for a bishop . What 's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander ; that proverb holds good in your country as well as mine , do n't it ? "
7817	7833	7835	7835	Dickiefield	120	" The Ecclesiastical Court is a court of discipline and doctrine rather than of law , "
7837	7871	7835	7835	Dickiefield	120	" Well , it 's a court anyhow you fix it ; and your parsons must be a bad lot to want a set of lawyers reg'larly trained to keep them in order . "
7872	7888	7890	7891	the Bishop	336	" Perhaps Parson Brownlow would have been the better of a court of some kind , "
7893	7960	7890	7891	the Bishop	336	" It seems to me that to be a minister of the Gospel at one moment , a colonel at another , and the Governor of a State at a third , illustrates the abuses which arise when such courts do n't exist . With us , now , when a man once takes orders , he remains in them for the rest of his life . "
7961	7974	7976	7977	Mr Wog	131	" Even after he has concluded not to obey them , eh ? "
7979	7985	7986	7986	I	0	" Ah , Mr Wog , "
7989	8268	7986	7986	I	0	" before you return to the oil regions , you must make yourself acquainted with the enormous advantages connected with a State Church . You must grasp the idea that it is founded chiefly upon Acts of Parliament — that the clergy are only a paid branch of the Civil Service , exercising police functions of a very lofty and important character . The ' orders ' come from the Queen , the ' Articles ' are interpreted by the Privy Council , and ' England expects every clergyman to do his duty . ' As I think some of the late doctrinal decisions of the judicial committee are questionable , I am drawing up a bill for the reform of the Protestant religion , and for the addition of a fortieth article to the existing thirty - nine . If I can carry it through both Houses of Parliament , all the convocations in Christendom can not prevent the nation from accepting it as absolute divine truth ; and I shall have the extreme satisfaction of feeling that I am manufacturing a creed for the masses , and thus securing a theological progress commensurate with our educational enlightenment . As long as the law of the land enables a majority of the Legislature to point out the straight and narrow way to the archbishops and bishops who have to lead their flocks along it , I have no fear for the future . It must be a comfort to feel , that if the worst comes to the worst , you have , as in the House of Commons , to lean upon ' my lord . ' "
8271	8275	8277	8278	the Bishop	336	" dry ecclesiastical humour "
8297	8303	8304	8304	he	336	" I do n't think , "
8309	8330	8304	8304	he	336	" that this is either the place or the mode in which to discuss subjects of so solemn a nature . "
8331	8341	8342	8342	I	0	" I was only speaking of the system generally , "
8345	8390	8342	8342	I	0	" and did not propose to enter here upon any doctrinal details of a really sacred character ; those I leave to ecclesiastical dignitaries and learned divines with initials , to ventilate in a sweet Christian spirit in the columns of the daily press . "
8404	8408	8397	8397	his	336	" good night , "
8411	8416	8418	8418	Dickiefield	120	" Really , Frank , "
8420	8465	8418	8418	Dickiefield	120	" it is not fair of you to drive my guests to bed before they have finished their pipes in that way . What you say may be perfectly true , but there can be no sort of advantage in stating it so broadly . "
8466	8531	8554	8554	he	110	" My dear Dickiefield , how on earth is our friend Wog here to understand what his southern countryman would call ' our peculiar institution , ' if somebody does not enlighten him ? I want him , on his return , to point out to the President the advantage of substituting a State Church for the State rights which are so rapidly disappearing . "
8562	8576	8577	8577	he	110	" If the effect of your preaching is to drive your listeners away , "
8582	8594	8577	8577	he	110	" I am afraid it will not meet with much success . "
8595	8608	8609	8609	I	0	" It is a disagreeable task , but somebody must do it , "
8616	8847	8609	8609	I	0	" It makes me quite sad to look at these poor wandering shepherds , who really mean to do right , but who are so utterly bewildered themselves , that they have lost all power of guiding their flocks without the assistance of lawyers . When did these latter bring back ' the key of knowledge , ' that one of old said they had ' taken away ? ' or why are they not as ' blind leaders of the blind ' now as they were then ? If I speak harshly , it is because I fancy I see a ditch before them . I shall feel bound to trouble the Bishop again with a few practical remarks . There is no knowing whether even he may not be brought to perceive that you might as well try to extract warmth from an iceberg as divine inspiration from the State , and that a Church without inspiration is simply a grate without fire . The clergy may go on teaching for doctrine the commandments of men , and stand and shiver in a theology which comes to them filtered through the Privy Council , and which is as cold and gloomy as the cathedrals in which it is preached . But the congregations who are crying aloud for light and heat will go and look for them elsewhere . "
8848	8857	8859	8859	Grandon	110	" You are a curious compound , Frank , "
8861	8898	8899	8899	he	110	" I never knew a man whose moods changed so suddenly , or whose modes of thinking were so spasmodic and extreme ; however , I suppose you are intended to be of some use in the world"—and
8911	8941	8899	8899	he	110	" By the way , we must leave by the early train to - morrow if we want to get to town in time for the opening of Parliament . "
8942	8953	8954	8954	I	0	" I think I shall stay over to - morrow , "
8957	8997	8954	8954	I	0	" Broadhem is going up , but the ladies are going to stay two days longer , and the House can open very well without me ; besides , Chundango and the Bishop are going to stay over Sunday . "
8998	9006	9008	9008	Grandon	110	" That is an inducement , certainly , "
9010	9020	9008	9008	Grandon	110	" Come , you must have some other reason ! "
9021	9027	9029	9029	I	0	" My dear old fellow , "
9039	9092	9029	9029	I	0	" my time is come at last . Have n't you remarked what low spirits I have been in since dinner ? I ca n't bear it for another twenty - four hours ! You know my impulsive sensitive nature . I must know my fate at once from her own lips . "
9093	9098	9100	9100	Grandon	110	" Whose own lips ? "
9109	9117	9118	9118	I	0	" Lady Ursula 's , of course ! "
9121	9140	9118	9118	I	0	" I knew her very well as a child , so there is nothing very sudden about it . "
9159	9170	9157	9157	you	0	" he said , in a deeper tone than usual . "
9186	9187	9178	9178	you	0	" "
9196	9204	9205	9205	I	0	" and I turned from him abruptly . "
9226	9417	9157	9157	you	0	" thought I , as I penned the above for their benefit , after which I indulged in two hours of troubled sleep . Flityville , March 20 . As the event which I am about to recount forms the turning - point of my life — unless , indeed , something still more remarkable happens , which I do not at present foresee , to turn me back again — I do not feel that it would be either becoming , or indeed possible , for me to maintain that vein of easy cheerfulness which has characterised my composition hitherto . What is fun to you , O my reader ! may be death to me ; and nothing can be further from my intention than to excite the smallest tendency to risibility on your part at my misfortunes or trials . You will already have guessed what these are ; but how to recur to those agonising details , how to present to you the picture of my misery in its true colours,—nothing but the stern determination to carry out my original design , and the conscientious conviction that "
9427	9501	9157	9157	you	0	" may be made a profitable study to my fellow - men , could induce me in this cold - blooded way to tear open the still unhealed wound . I came down to breakfast rather late on the morning following the events narrated in the last chapter . Broadhem and Grandon had already vanished from the scene ; so had Mr Wog , who went up to town to see what he called "
9503	9508	9157	9157	you	0	elephant,"—an American expression , signifying "
9516	9599	9600	9600	My	0	" The phrase originated in an occurrence at a menagerie , and as upon this occasion Mr Wog applied it to the opening of Parliament , it was not altogether inappropriate . I found still lingering over the debris of breakfast my host and hostess , Lady Broadhem and her daughters , the Bishop and Chundango . The latter appeared to be having all the talk to himself , and , to give him his due , his conversation was generally entertaining . "
9604	9609	9600	9600	My	0	" he was saying , "
9666	9672	9657	9657	I	0	" with an upward glance , "
9686	9687	9691	9691	you	0	" "
9700	9705	9691	9691	you	0	" asked Lady Broadhem . "
9732	9733	9709	9709	she	419	" "
9742	9749	9735	9735	you	0	" I asked , somewhat abruptly . "
9756	9760	9735	9735	you	0	" said John ; "
9777	9814	9767	9775	some Christian young person as a yoke - mate	423	" There was a self - satisfied roll of his eye as he said this , which took away from me all further desire for the bacon and eggs I had just put on my plate . "
9819	9824	9767	9775	some Christian young person as a yoke - mate	423	" said Lady Broadhem , "
9863	9864	9861	9861	them	428	" "
9874	9880	9865	9868	The Rajah of Sattara	429	" said Chundango , unblushingly ; "
9896	9897	9882	9882	they	428	" "
9905	9922	9923	9923	I	0	" said Dickiefield to the Bishop , to divert attention from Chundango 's last barefaced assertion . "
9944	9945	9925	9925	they	428	" "
9948	9952	9925	9925	they	428	" said Joseph ; "
10015	10016	10018	10018	me	0	" "
10027	10031	10018	10018	me	0	" said Dickiefield , "
10118	10119	10120	10120	I	0	" "
10134	10139	10120	10120	I	0	" said the Bishop . "
10150	10151	10142	10142	you	0	" "
10158	10169	10194	10194	you	0	" replied Dickiefield , with a twinkle in his eye , "
10197	10227	10194	10194	you	0	" The Bishop named one , when I interrupted him , for I felt Dickiefield had not put the case fairly as regarded the first Minister of the Crown . "
10238	10242	10243	10243	he	437	" said I ; "
10666	10667	10671	10672	my lord	2022	" "
10682	10733	10679	10680	Lord Dickiefield	120	" said the Bishop , very stiffly ; for there was an absence of that deference in my tone to which those who love the uppermost seats in the synagogues are accustomed , but which I reserve for some poor labourers who will never be heard of in this world . "
10738	10743	10679	10680	Lord Dickiefield	120	" I went on , "
10886	10901	10853	10853	God	130	" said I , turning to the Bishop , who looked flushed and angry , "
10916	10917	10918	10919	Lord Frank	116	" "
10926	10942	10918	10919	Lord Frank	116	" broke in Lady Broadhem , who had several times vainly endeavoured to interrupt me , "
10988	10989	10990	10991	Lady Broadhem	166	" "
10993	10999	10990	10991	Lady Broadhem	166	" said I , sternly , "
11159	11187	11208	11208	literates	491	trade?"[1 ] Lady Broadhem seemed a little cowed by my vehemence , which some might have thought amounted to rudeness , but would not abandon the field . "
11191	11195	11208	11208	literates	491	" she said , "
11303	11304	11305	11305	I	0	" "
11418	11438	11439	11440	Good fellow	507	" and I felt I had sown seed in the ecclesiastical vineyard , and would leave it to fructify . "
11444	11456	11442	11442	Frank	116	" I overheard Dickiefield say , as I left the room ; "
11468	11469	11442	11442	Frank	116	" "
11472	11476	11442	11442	Frank	116	" I thought , "
11559	11563	11547	11547	I	0	" I soliloquised ; "
11620	11819	11609	11609	She	124	" These were the thoughts that passed through my somewhat bewildered brain , as I stepped out upon the terrace and lit my cigar . So far from my nerves becoming steadier , however , under the usually soothing influence , I felt my heart beating more rapidly each time I endeavoured to frame the sentence upon which was to depend the happiness of my life , until at last my resolution gave way altogether , and I determined to put upon paper , in the form of an interrogatory , the momentous question . A glass door opened from a recess in the drawing - room upon the terrace on which I was walking , and in it , on my former visits , I had been in the daily habit of writing my letters . It was a snug retreat , with a fire all to itself , a charming view , and a portière which separated it or not from the drawing - room , according to the wish of the occupant . The first question I had to consider when I put the writing materials before me was , whether I ought to begin , "
11824	11827	11820	11822	Dear Lady Ursula	124	" or , "
11833	11843	11830	11831	Lady Ursula	124	" I should not have entertained the idea of beginning "
11847	11956	11830	11831	Lady Ursula	124	" did I not feel that having known her as a child entitled me to assume a certain intimacy . However , on further consideration , I adopted the more distant form , and then my real difficulty began . While looking for an inspiration at the further end of the avenue which stretched from the lawn , I became conscious of a figure moving slowly towards me , which I finally perceived to be that of Lady Broadhem herself . In my then frame of mind , any escape from my dilemma was a relief , and I instinctively left the still unwritten note and joined her . "
11975	11976	11977	11977	I	0	" "
11986	11988	11977	11977	I	0	" she replied,—"the
12016	12037	12005	12005	I	0	" She put a marked emphasis on the last word , I ca n't imagine why , so I said , "
12078	12079	12081	12081	me	0	" "
12083	12102	12081	12081	me	0	" said Lady Broadhem , pulling a little box like a card - case out of her pocket , "
12117	12118	12110	12110	I	0	" "
12131	12139	12145	12145	he	147	" I said , with a sigh . "
12180	12181	12145	12145	he	147	" "
12221	12234	12218	12218	I	0	" she said , looking with a sidelong glance into my face , "
12246	12405	12244	12244	himself	515	" and she stopped suddenly , as though she had spoken under some irresistible impulse . I do n't remember having blushed since I first went to school , but if Lady Broadhem could have seen the colour of my skin under my thick beard , she would have perceived how just her penetration had been . Still I was a good deal puzzled at the quickness with which she had made a discovery I imagined unknown , even to the object of my affections , to say nothing of the coarseness of her alluding to it to me in that direct manner . What had I said or done that could have put her on the scent ? I pondered in vain over the mystery . My conduct had been most circumspect during the few hours I had been in love ; nothing but the sagacity with which the maternal instinct is endowed could account for it . "
12415	12421	12407	12407	you	516	" said I , timidly . "
12527	12593	12594	12594	Dear	521	" with which most encouraging speech Lady Broadhem turned towards the house , leaving me overcome with rapture and astonishment , slightly tinged with disgust at finding that the girl I loved was thrown at my head . I did not delay , when I got back to my recess in the drawing - room , to tear up with a triumphant gesture my note beginning "
12596	12602	12594	12594	Dear	521	" and to commence another , "
12608	12609	12605	12606	Lady Ursula	124	" "
12621	12626	12628	12628	me	0	" I went on , "
12879	12881	12874	12874	I	0	" sentiment "
12912	12915	12905	12905	I	0	" Jewel . "
12932	12938	12922	12922	Chundango	140	" Remember , Lady Ursula , "
12944	13001	12922	12922	Chundango	140	" there are very few men who could offer their brides such a collection of jewels as I can . Think , that although of a different complexion from yourself , I am of royal blood . You are surely too enlightened and noble - minded to allow the trivial consideration of colour to influence you . "
13002	13006	13008	13009	Lady Ursula	124	" Mr Chundango , "
13026	13039	13020	13020	she	124	" you really must excuse me from listening to you any more . "
13040	13045	13047	13047	Chundango	140	" Stop one moment , "
13069	13085	13062	13062	I	0	" I have not made this proposal without receiving first the sanction of Lady Broadhem . "
13086	13090	13093	13093	I	0	" Deceitful old hypocrite "
13099	13193	13093	13093	I	0	" When I told her ladyship that I would settle a million 's worth of pounds upon you in jewellery and stock , that my blood was royal , and that all my aspirations were for social distinction , she said she desired no higher qualification . ' What , dear Mr Chundango , ' she remarked , ' matters the colour of your skin if your blood is pure ? If your jewellery and your conversion are both genuine , what more could an anxious mother desire for her beloved daughter ? ' "
13194	13202	13204	13204	Ursula	124	" Spare me , I implore you , "
13213	13225	13204	13204	Ursula	124	" You do n't know the pain you are giving me . "
13315	13319	13320	13320	he	140	" Lady Broadhem , "
13333	13408	13320	13320	he	140	room—"I do not understand Lady Ursula 's conduct . I thought obedience to parents was one of the first precepts of the Christian religion ; but when I tell her your wishes on the subject of our marriage , she forbids me to speak . I will now leave her in your hands , and I hope I shall receive her from them in the evening in another and a better frame of mind ; "
13421	13429	13431	13432	Lady Broadhem	166	" What have you done , Ursula ? "
13441	13611	13431	13432	Lady Broadhem	166	" I suppose some absurd prejudice about his colour has influenced you in refusing a fortune that few girls have placed at their feet . He is a man of remarkable ability ; in some lights there is a decided richness in his hue ; and Lord Dickiefield tells me he fully expects to see him some day Under - Secretary for India , and ultimately perhaps in the Cabinet . Moreover , he is very lavish , and would take a pride in giving you all you could possibly want , and in meeting all our wishes . He would be most useful to Broadhem , whose property , you know , was dreadfully involved by his father in his young days - in fact , he promised me to pay off — 300,000 of the debt upon his personal security , and not ask for any interest for the first few years . All this you are throwing away for some girlish fancy for some one else . "
13617	13621	13623	13623	I	0	" Dear girl , "
13625	13661	13623	13623	I	0	" she loves me , and I 'll rush in and tell her that I return her passion . Moreover , I will overwhelm that old woman with confusion for having so grossly deceived me . "
13720	13727	13728	13728	I	0	" Is it righteous,—Lady Broadhem — — "
13736	13748	13732	13732	she	166	" My indignation ? Yes , Lord Frank , it is . "
13749	13851	13853	13853	I	0	" No , Lady Broadhem ; I did not allude to your indignation , which is unjustifiable . I was about to express my feelings in language which I thought might influence you with reference to the deception you have practised upon me . You gave me to understand only half an hour ago that you approved of my attachment to your daughter ; you implied that that attachment was returned — indeed , I have just overheard as much from her own lips ; and now you deliberately urge her to ally herself with — the thought is too horrible ! "
13866	13870	13872	13873	Lady Broadhem	166	" Lord Frank , "
13877	13974	13872	13873	Lady Broadhem	166	" you had no business to overhear anything ; however , I suppose the state of your feelings must be your excuse . It seems that we entirely misunderstood each other this morning . The attachment I then alluded to was the one you have just heard Mr Chundango declare . I did so , because I thought of asking you to find out some particulars about him which I am anxious to know . I was utterly ignorant of your having entertained the same feelings for Ursula . What settlements are you prepared to make ? "
14004	14046	14047	14048	Lady Broadhem	166	" I shall make Broadhem a liberal allowance , and settle an annuity upon yourself , which my solicitor will pay you quarterly . I know the family is poor ; it will give me great pleasure to keep you all . "
14117	14138	14106	14106	she	166	" Forgive the natural anxiety of a mother , Lord Frank , as I forgive you for that last speech . "
14186	14191	14192	14192	I	0	" Dear Lady Broadhem , "
14212	14274	14192	14192	I	0	" how thankful we ought to be that on an occasion of this kind we can both so thoroughly command our feelings ! Believe me , your anxiety for your daughter 's welfare is only equalled by the fervour of my affection for her . Shall we say — 100,000 in stock , and Flityville Park as a dower - house ? "
14275	14282	14284	14285	her ladyship	2136	" What stock , Lord Frank ? "
14295	14308	14192	14192	I	0	" not Mexicans or Spanish passives , I do most fervently trust . "
14309	14312	14314	14314	I	0	" No , "
14318	14327	14314	14314	I	0	" nearly all in Confederate and Greek loans . "
14328	14331	14332	14332	she	166	" Oh ! "
14347	14356	14358	14358	she	166	" What is the matter , Lady Broadhem ? "
14371	14407	14365	14365	I	0	" I was only joking ; you need be under no apprehension as to the securities — they are as sound as your own theology , and would satisfy the Lord Chancellor quite as well . "
14408	14769	14358	14358	she	166	" Oh , it was not that ! Perhaps some day when you and dear Ursula are married , I will tell you all about it ; for you have my full consent ; and I need not say what an escape I think she has had from that black man . Entre nous , as it is most important you should understand exactly the situation , I must correct one error into which you have fallen ; she is not in love with you , Lord Frank ; you must expect a little opposition at first ; but that will only add zest to the pursuit , and my wishes will be paramount in the end . The fact is , but this is a profound secret , your friend Lord Grandon has behaved most improperly in the matter . He came down on some pretence of instilling his ridiculous notions into Broadhem , who took a fancy to him when we were all staying at Lady Mundane 's , and I strongly opposed it , as I fancied , even then , he was paying Ursula too much attention ; but she has such influence with Broadhem that she carried her point , because , she said , her brother could only get good from him . What exactly passed at Broadhem I do n't know ; but I was so angry at the idea of an almost penniless Irish peer taking advantage of his opportunities as a visitor to entrap my girl 's affections , that I told him I expected some people , and should want his bedroom . He left within an hour , and Ursula declares he never uttered a word which warranted this decisive measure ; but people can do a good deal without ' uttering , ' as she calls it ; and I am quite determined not to let them see anything of each other during the season . Fortunately Lord Grandon scarcely ever goes out , and Broadhem , whose eyes are opened at last , has promised to watch him . Whoever Ursula marries must do something for Broadhem . "

15018	15024	15025	15025	she	166	" My dear Lord Frank , "
15028	15140	15025	15025	she	166	" after all it might have been worse . Supposing that Lord Grandon had not been your friend , or had not had the absurd Quixotic ideas which I understand he has of the duties of friendship , he might have given you immense trouble ; as it is , I am sure he has only to know the exact state of the case to retire . I know him quite well enough for that . I look upon it as providential . Had it been Mr Chundango , Grandon would most probably have persevered . Now he is quite capable of doing all he can to help you with Ursula . "
15166	15177	15179	15179	I	0	" I am so glad to think , Lady Broadhem , "
15186	15268	15179	15179	I	0	" that you do not suspect me of such a ridiculous exaggeration of sentiment . So far from it , it seems to impart a peculiar piquancy to the pursuit when success is only possible at the sacrifice of another 's happiness ; and when that other is one 's oldest friend , there is a refinement of emotion , a sort of pleasurable pain , which is quite irresistible . To what element in our nature do you attribute this ? "
15269	15278	15280	15281	Lady Broadhem	166	" To original sin , I am afraid , "
15298	15310	15312	15312	I.	0	" Oh , it is not at all ' original , ' "
15313	15375	15312	15312	I.	0	" Whatever other merit it possesses , it ca n't claim originality — it is the commonest thing in the world ; but I think it is an acquired taste at first — it grows upon you like caviar or olives . I remember some years ago , in Australia , running away with the wife of a charming fellow — — "
15376	15397	15468	15469	Lady Broadhem	166	" Oh , Lord Frank , Lord Frank , please stop ! Have you repented ? and where is she ? "
15398	15401	15402	15402	I	0	" No , "
15405	15424	15402	15402	I	0	" I never intend to repent ; and I 'll tell you where she is after the marriage . "
15479	15484	15486	15486	she	166	" How very dreadful ! "
15494	15511	15512	15512	she	166	" We must forget the past , and try and reform ourselves , must n't we ? "
15518	15553	15512	15512	she	166	" but I had no idea that you had passed through a jeunesse orageuse . Do you know , I think men , when they do steady , are always the better for it . "
15554	15584	15486	15486	she	166	" Well , I hope Lady Ursula may keep me quiet ; nothing else ever has yet . I suppose you wo n't expect me to go to church ? "
15585	15601	15603	15604	Lady Broadhem	166	" We 'll talk about that after the marriage , to use your own expression , "
15610	15648	15512	15512	she	166	" Because , you know , I am worse than Grandon as regards orthodoxy . Now , Chundango is so thoroughly sound , do n't you think , after all , that that is the first consideration ? "
15649	15676	15486	15486	she	166	" To tell you the truth — but of course I never breathed it to Ursula — I attach a good deal of importance to colour . "
15677	15790	15792	15792	I	0	" Ah , I see ; you classify us somewhat in this way : first , if you can get it , rich , orthodox , and white ; second , rich , heterdox , and white ; third , rich , orthodox , and black . Now , in my opinion , to attach any importance whatever to colour is wicked . My objections to Mr Chundango do not apply to his skin , which is as good as any other , but to his heart , which I am afraid is black . I prefer a pure heart in a dark skin to a black heart in a white one , "
15799	15822	15792	15792	I	0	" Supposing that out of friendship for Grandon I should do the absurd thing of withdrawing my pretensions , what would happen ? "
15823	15897	15908	15909	Lady Broadhem	166	" I should insist upon Ursula 's marrying Mr Chundango . I tell you in confidence , Lord Frank , that pecuniary reasons , which I will explain more fully at another time , render it absolutely necessary that she should marry a man with means within the next six months . The credit of our whole family is at stake ; but it is impossible for me to enter into details now . "

16774	16792	16773	16773	I.	0	" It ought to be under your hand , for I left it exactly on that spot . "
16793	16796	16797	16797	she	124	" No , "
16800	16840	16797	16797	she	124	" I found mamma writing here when I came , and she took a packet of letters away with her ; perhaps she put yours among them by mistake . She will be back from her drive almost immediately . "
16841	16846	16848	16848	I.	0	" I hope so , "
16849	16860	16797	16797	she	124	" I should be sorry to leave without seeing her . "
16861	16878	16879	16879	She	124	" To leave , Lord Frank ! I thought you were going to stay till Monday . "
17014	17028	17029	17029	she	124	" What 's the matter ? what 's the matter , Lord Frank ? "
17032	17039	17029	17029	she	124	" Osseous matter , osseous matter , "
17414	17432	17433	17433	she	124	" Lord Frank , do let me ring the bell and send for a glass of water , "
17438	17480	17433	17433	she	124	" Thanks , no ; the fact is , that letter I have lost causes me the greatest anxiety , and when I thought what the consequences might be of its going astray I felt a little faint for a moment . "
17481	17485	17487	17488	Lady Ursula	124	" Dear me , "
17492	17579	17580	17580	she	124	" I will make mamma look for it at once , and I am sure if it is a matter in which my sympathy could be of any use , you will appreciate my motive in offering it ; but I do think in this world people might be of so much more use to each other than they are , if they would only trust one another , and believe in the sincerity of friendship . Although you did try to shock me last night , "
17587	17700	17580	17580	she	124	" I have heard so much of you from Lord Grandon , and know how kind and good you are , although he says you are too enthusiastic and too fond of paradoxes , but I assure you I consider you quite an old friend . You remember , years ago , when I was a little girl , how you used to gallop about with me on my pony in the park at Broadhem ? You wo n't think me inquisitive , I am sure , in saying this , but there are moments sometimes when it is a relief to find a listener to the history of one 's troubles . "
17701	17727	17728	17728	I	0	" But when , by a curious fatality , that listener is the cause of them all , these moments are not likely to arrive , "
18027	18074	18023	18023	I	0	" Ha ! ha ! ha ! Lady Ursula , if you only knew what a comic aspect that last kind speech of yours has given to the whole affair . Do n't think me ungrateful or rude , but — ha ! ha ! ha ! "
18081	18176	18076	18076	I	0	" When once my sense of humour is really touched , I always seem to see the point of a joke to quite a painful degree . Upon two occasions I have suffered from fits after punning , and riddles always make me hysterical ; but I assure you , you unconsciously made a joke just now when you asked me to tell you exactly what I felt , which I shall remember as long as I live , for it will certainly be the death of me — ha ! ha ! ha ! "
18217	18221	18223	18224	Lady Broadhem	166	" Dear me , "
18232	18251	18227	18227	her	166	" how very merry you are!—at least Lord Frank is . You seem a little pale , dear , "
18256	18262	18227	18227	her	166	" what is the matter ? "
18263	18297	18227	18227	her	166	" Oh , nothing , mamma . Lord Frank has been looking for a letter in the recess . You do n't happen to have put it up with yours , do you ? "
18298	18308	18310	18311	Lady Broadhem	166	" No , my dear , I think not , "
18318	18348	18310	18311	Lady Broadhem	166	" Who was it to , Lord Frank , if you will pardon my curiosity ? I shall find it more easily if you will give me the address . "
18349	18354	18356	18356	I	0	" Nobody in particular , "
18358	18422	18356	18356	I	0	" so it does not matter ; you can keep it and read it . It is a riddle ; that is what has been amusing us so much . Lady Ursula has been making such absurd attempts to guess it . Good - bye , Lady Broadhem . Here is the servant come to say that my fly is at the door . "
18423	18434	18436	18436	she	166	" Good gracious ! Why , where are you going ? "
18470	18493	18495	18495	I	0	" Oh , only to Flityville to get everything ready ; you know what a state the place is in . Now , "
18506	18597	18598	18598	I	0	" I shall indeed have an object in putting it in order , and I shall expect you and Lady Ursula to come some day soon and suggest the improvements . I have only one request to make before leaving , and I do so , Lady Ursula , in the presence of your mother and sister ; and that is , that until I see you again , the subject of our conversation just now may never be alluded to between yourselves . Trust in me , Lady Broadhem , "
18606	18627	18628	18628	I	0	" and promise me you will not ask Lady Ursula what I have just told her ; if you do , "

18660	18667	18668	18668	I	0	" And now , Lady Ursula , "

19484	19635	19636	19636	I	0	" have I been attacking this poor colonial bishop and the Establishment to which he belongs , and what have I given him in return ? I expose the abuses of his theological and ecclesiastical system , but I provide him with no remedy . I fling one big stone at the crystal palace in which Protestantism is shrivelling away , and another big stone at the crystal palace in which Catholicism is rotting , and I offer them in exchange the cucumber - frame under which I am myself squatting uncomfortably . I owe them an apology . Unfortunately I have not yet found either the man or the body of men who do not prefer hard cash to an apology — provided , of course , it be properly proportioned to the susceptibility of their feelings or the delicacy of their sense of honour . Fairly , now , "

19885	19971	19882	19882	I	0	" at my turning myself into a hermit at this most inopportune season of the year ; but the fact is , that shortly after you left Dickiefield , I became so deeply impressed with the responsibility of the great work I had undertaken , that I perceived that a period of retirement and repose was absolutely necessary with a view to the elaboration of some system which should enable me to grapple with the great moral and social questions upon which I am engaged . "
20149	20800	20804	20804	Jonah	154	" Looked at from what I may term ' externals , ' we simply present to the world at large the ignoble spectacle of a nation of usurers trembling over our money - bags ; looked at from internals , I perceive that we are suffering from a moral opiate , to the action of which I attribute the unhappy complaints that I have endeavoured to describe . This pernicious narcotic has been absorbed by us for hundreds of years unsuspected and unperceived under the guise of a popular theology . We have become so steeped in the insane delusion , now many centuries old , that we are a Christian nation , that I anticipate with dread the reaction which will take place when men awaken to the true character of the religious quackery with which they have been duped , and , overlooking in their frenzy the distinction which exists between ancient and modern Christianity , will repudiate the former with horror , which , after all , does not deserve to be condemned , for it has never yet been tried as a political system in any country . Individuals only profess to be theoretically governed by it . Nor would it be possible , as society is at present constituted , for any man to carry out its principles in daily life . That any statesman would be instantly ruined who should openly announce that he intended to govern the country on purely Christian principles , may be made clear to the simplest comprehension . For instance , imagine our Foreign Minister getting up in the House of Commons and justifying his last stroke of foreign policy upon the ground that we should ' love our neighbours better than ourselves , or penning a despatch to any power that we felt ' persecuted ' by blessing it . When do we even do good to anybody in our national capacity , much less to them ' that hate us ' ? We certainly pray like Chinamen when we want to propitiate an angry Deity about the cattle - plague ; but who ever heard of ' a form of prayer to be used ' for nations ' who despitefully use us . ' Fancy the Chancellor of the Exchequer informing us that instead of laying up for the nation treasures upon earth , he proposed realising all that the country possessed and giving it to the poor . Christian Churchmen and statesmen do not therefore sufficiently believe in the power and efficacy of the Christian moral code to trust the nation to it alone . Hence they have invented ecclesiastical organisations and theological dogmas as anodynes ; and the people have been lulled into security by the singular notion , that if they supported the one and professed to believe in the other , they were different from either Mohammedans or Bhuddists . In a word , it is the curse of England that its intellect can see truths which its heart will not embody . The more I think of it the more I am disposed to risk the assertion , that if , as is supposed , the moral code called Christian is divine , it is only not practicable , literally , by the nation for lack of national heart - faith . I tell you this in confidence , for I am already considered so wild and visionary upon all these matters , and so thoroughly unsound , that I should not like it to be generally known , for fear of its injuring my political prospects . In the mean time it will very much assist me in arriving at some of my conclusions , if you will kindly procure for me , from any leading member of the Legislature , lay or clerical , answers to the following questions : — "
20830	20855	20804	20804	Jonah	154	" Second , Specify the sins which were probably committed in Chorazin or Bethsaida , but which have not yet been perpetrated in London . "
20916	20967	20983	20983	I	0	" Fourth , Does the saying that the love of money is the root of all evil apply to a nation as well as to an individual?—and if not , how does it happen that the more we accumulate wealth , the more we increase poverty and misery and crime ? "

22475	22481	22482	22482	she	166	" How stupid I am ! "
22485	22596	22482	22482	she	166	" my poor mind gets quite bewildered . I was thinking of stock , not men ; they went down again three more yesterday , and my broker declines altogether to carry them on from one account to another any more . I bought at 60 , and they have done nothing but go down ever since . I generally go by Lord Staggerton 's advice , and he recommended me to sell a bear some months ago ; but that stupid little Spiffy Goldtip insisted that it was only a temporary depression , and now he says how could he know that President Davis would replace Johnston by Hood . "
22597	22613	22614	22614	I	0	" Very tiresome of Davis : but you should have employed more than one broker , "
22617	22642	22614	22614	I	0	" Persons of limited capital and speculative tendencies should operate mysteriously . Your right hand should not know what your left hand is doing . "
22643	22679	22403	22403	she	166	" Hush , Frank ! you can surely be business - like without being profane . I was completely in Spiffy 's hands ; Lady Mundane told me she always let him do for her , and"—here
22684	22880	22403	22403	she	166	voice—"I know he has access to the best sources of information . I used to employ Staggerton , but he is so selfish that he never told me the best things ; besides which , of course , I was obliged to have him constantly to dinner ; and his great delight was always to say things which were calculated to shock my religious friends . Moreover , he has lately been doing more as a promoter of new companies than in buying and selling . Now Spiffy is so very useful in society , and has so much tact , that although there are all kinds of stories against him , still I did not think there was any sufficient reason to shut him out of the house . There was quite a set made against the poor little man at one time — worldly people are so hard and uncharitable ; so , partly for the sake of his aunt , Lady Spiffington , who was my dear friend , and partly , indeed , because Staggerton had really become useless and intolerable , I put my affairs entirely into Spiffy 's hands .

22891	22903	22905	22906	Lady Broadhem	166	" That I must pay up — 27,000 to - morrow , "
22917	22934	22935	22935	I	0	" You should have kept his lordship to act as a check on the Honourable Spiffington , "

22964	22973	22961	22961	she	166	" What more do you want to know ? "

22989	23039	22961	22961	she	166	" I do n't see that that is at all necessary . Here is Spiffington 's letter , from which you will see how much I must pay to - morrow ; my assurance that I can not produce so large a sum at such short notice is enough . "
23040	23070	22961	22961	she	166	" You can surely have no difficulty in finding some one who would lend you the money , provided you were to pay a sufficiently high rate of interest . "
23087	23167	23083	23083	she	166	" Frank , it was on no hasty impulse that I telegraphed for you . I do not feel bound to enter into all the details of my private affairs , but I do feel that if there is one man in the world upon whom , at such a crisis , I have a right to rely , it is he to whom I have promised my daughter , and who professes to be devotedly attached to her . "
23168	23175	23177	23177	I	0	" In short , Lady Broadhem , "
23186	23253	23177	23177	I	0	" you are willing to part with your daughter to me on condition of my paying a first instalment of — 27,000 down , with the prospect of ' calls ' to an unlimited extent looming in the background . I doubt whether you will find Chundango prepared to go into such a very hazardous speculation , but I should recommend you to apply to him . "
23346	23349	23350	23350	I	0	" What ! "
23353	23376	23350	23350	I	0	" is it reserved for the mother of the girl I love to make me call her ' a hazardous speculation ' ? "
23551	23673	23548	23549	Lady Broadhem	166	" Heavens , Frank , do n't stare so wildly — you quite frighten me ! I have only asked for your advice , and you make use of expressions and fly off in a manner which nothing but the excitability of your temperament can excuse . I assure you I am worried enough without having my cares added to by your unkindness . There , if you want to know the exact state of my affairs , look through my papers — you will find I am a woman of business ; and I have got an accurate list which I shall be able to explain . Of course all the more important original documents are at my solicitor 's . "
23809	23813	23815	23816	Lady Broadhem	166	" Dear Frank , "
23831	23976	23823	23823	her	166	" I know I have been very imprudent , but I did it all for the best . You can understand now why I hesitated to tell you everything at first . You do n't know how much it has cost me , and to what means I am obliged to resort to keep up my courage ; besides , I have got into such a habit of concealment that I could not bear that even you should know the desperate state of our affairs , though I had no idea that in so short a time you could have unravelled such complicated accounts and arrived at the terrible result . Perhaps you would like me to leave you for a few moments . I will go and say good - night to Ursula , whom I heard going up - stairs just now . "

24551	24620	24622	24622	I	0	" Ha ! ha ! Lady Broadhem ! the means you take to keep up your courage , which you so delicately alluded to just now , have come in most opportunely . What a fool I was to make mountains out of molehills , and call the little ills of life miseries ! We will soon see what these little imprudences are the old lady talks of . "
24806	24814	24816	24816	she	166	" Gracious , what is the matter ? "
24827	24830	24818	24818	My	0	" poison . "
24831	24838	24840	24840	she	166	" Frank , speak to me ! "

24880	24887	24889	24889	she	166	" Where did you get it ? "
24940	24942	24931	24931	her	166	" You fool"—she
24955	24958	24960	24960	she	166	same—"you fool , "
24965	25034	24960	24960	she	166	" what did you go poking under the pillow for ? You are no more poisoned than I am ; it is a draught I am obliged to take for nervous depression , and your imagination has almost frightened you into a fit . I put ' poison ' on it to keep the servants from prying . Come , get up , be a man — do , "
25054	25059	25061	25061	I	0	" Dearest Lady Broadhem , "
25069	25244	25061	25061	I	0	" I can not tell what comfort you give me . I was just beginning to regret the world I thought I was about to leave for ever , when your assurance that I have not taken poison , but a tonic , makes me feel as grateful to you as if you had saved my life . I confess that , when I found that you considered your affairs to be so desperate that you had provided the most effectual mode of escape from them , I envied the superior foresight which you had displayed , and determined to repair my error . If it is worth dear Lady Broadhem 's while to poison herself , I thought , it is surely worth mine . But , after all , suicide is a cowardly act either in a man or a woman ; better far face the ills of life with the aid of stimulants , than fly for refuge in the agony of a financial crisis to the shop of an apothecary . "
25245	25254	25256	25257	Lady Broadhem	166	" You are an incomprehensible creature , Frank , "
25259	25312	25256	25257	Lady Broadhem	166	" I am sure I hope for her own sake that Ursula will understand you better than I do ; but as your humours are uncertain , and you seem able to go into these affairs now , I think we had better not waste any more time ; only I do wish "
25322	25334	25061	25061	I	0	" you would provide yourself with your own draughts in future . "
25335	25339	25341	25341	I	0	" How lucky , "
25364	25405	25344	25344	I	0	" Now , if it had been just the other way , and her ladyship had taken the draught instead of me , how completely I should have been at her mercy ? Now I am master of the situation . "
25406	25415	25416	25416	I	0	" ' Greek loan , thirty thousand , ' "
25424	25460	25416	25416	I	0	" I am afraid this is rather a losing business . I see they have been already held over for some months . I suppose some of the — 27,000 is to be absorbed there . "
25461	25464	25466	25467	Lady Broadhem	166	" Yes , "
25469	25494	25466	25467	Lady Broadhem	166	" because if I can carry on for another fortnight , I have got information which makes it certain I shall recover on them . "
25495	25509	25510	25510	I	0	" What is this ? five hundred pounds ' worth of dollar bonds ? "
25514	25577	25510	25510	I	0	" Oh , I only lost a few pounds on them . I bought them at threepence apiece and sold them at twopence . Spiffy got me to take them off his hands , and , in fact , made a great favour of it , as he says there is nothing people make money more surely out of than dollar bonds . "
25578	25608	25466	25467	Lady Broadhem	166	" Bubbs 's Eating - house and Cigar Divan Company , Holborn . Well , there is a strong direction . How do you come by so many shares ? "
25609	25625	25627	25628	Lady Broadhem	166	" Lord Staggerton was one of the promoters , and had them allotted to me , "
25630	25926	25928	25929	Lady Broadhem	166	" He also was kind enough to put me into two Turkish baths , a monster hotel , and a music - hall . You will see that I lost heavily in the Turkish baths and the hotel , but the music - hall is paying well . Spiffy says I ought never to stay so long in anything as I do ; in and out again , if it is only half a per cent , is his system ; but Staggerton used to look after my interests , and managed them very successfully . I am afraid that all my troubles commenced when I quarrelled with him . He is now promoting two companies which I hear most highly spoken of , but he says I must take my chance with others about shares , and he wo n't advise me in the matter . One is ' The Metropolitan Crossing - Sweeping Company , ' of which he 's to be chairman , and the other is the ' Seaside Bathing - Machine Company . ' Spiffy says they will both fail , because Staggerton has not the means of having them properly brought out . Bodwinkle wo n't speak to him , and unless either he or the Credit Foncier bring a thing out , there is not the least chance of its taking with the public . They do n't so much look at the merits of the speculation as at the way in which it is put before them ; and with this system of rigging the market , so many people go in like me only to get out again , that it is becoming more and more difficult every day to start anything new . Oh dear , "
25931	25980	25928	25929	Lady Broadhem	166	" how exhausted it always makes me to talk ' City ! ' I only want to show you that I understand what I am about , and that if you can only help to tide me over this crisis , something will surely turn up a prize . "
25981	26011	26012	26012	I	0	" I know you disapprove of cards , but perhaps you will allow me to suggest the word ' trump ' as being more expressive than ' prize , ' "
26015	26061	26012	26012	I	0	" Well , now we have got through the companies , what have we here ? Why , Lady Broadhem , you have positively taken no less than seven unfurnished houses this year . What on earth do you intend to do with them all ? "
26062	26187	25928	25929	Lady Broadhem	166	" My dear Frank , where have you been living for the last few years ? Do with them ? Exactly what dozens of smart people , with very little to live on , do with houses — let them , to be sure . I made — 1100 last year in four houses , and all by adding it on to the premiums . I do n't like furnishing and putting it in the rent . In the first place , one is apt to have disagreeable squabbles about the furniture , which , however good you give people , they always say is shabby ; and in the second , you get much more into the hands of the house - agents . "
26188	26193	26194	26194	I	0	" Well , but , "
26197	26231	26194	26194	I	0	" here is one of the largest houses in London — rent , unfurnished , — 1500 a - year . That is rather hazardous : who do you expect will take that ? "
26232	26244	26246	26247	Lady Broadhem	166	" Oh , that is the safest speculation of them all , "
26249	26578	26246	26247	Lady Broadhem	166	" I had an infinity of trouble to get it . Spiffy first suggested the plan to me , and we found it succeed admirably last year . It was we who brought out Mrs Gorgon Tompkins and her daughters . She took the house from me at my own rent on condition that Spiffy managed her balls , and got all the best people in London to go to them . This year we are going to bring out the Bodwinkles . It will be much easier , because she is young , and has no family . He , you know , is a man of immense wealth in the City — in fact , as I said before , his name is almost essential to the success of any new company . I told his wife I could have nothing to do with them unless he came into Parliament , for they are horridly vulgar , and they were bound to do what they could for themselves before I could think of taking them up . Lady Mundane positively refused to have anything to do with them , and , in fact , I live so little in the world , though I keep it up to some extent for the sake of my girls , that it was quite an accident my hearing of them . Now , however , he has got into the House of Commons , and it is arranged that she is to take the house , and Bodwinkle is to help Spiffy in City matters , on condition that he gets all Lady Mundane 's list to her first party . Poor Spiffy is a little nervous , as Bodwinkle actually wanted to put it in writing on a stamped paper ; but he is so immensely useful to society , that the least people can do is to be good - natured on an occasion of this kind . "
26579	26585	26587	26587	I	0	" No fear of them , "
26589	26627	26587	26587	I	0	" if Bodwinkle is the only man who can launch a company in the City , no one can compete with Spiffy in launching a snob in Mayfair . But I thought you never went to balls . "
26628	26715	26246	26247	Lady Broadhem	166	" I never do ; but because I do not approve of dancing , there is no reason why I should not let houses for the purpose . You might as well say a religious banker ought not to open an account with a theatre , or a good brewer live by his beer , because some people drink too much of it . If any one was to leave a gin - palace to me in a legacy , I should not refuse the rent . "
26716	26736	26738	26738	I	0	" Any more than you do the interest of your shares in the music - hall . And now , "
26754	26795	26738	26738	I	0	" as it is past one o'clock , and I see you are tired , I will take these away with me , and let you know to - morrow what I think had better be done under the circumstances . "
26796	26820	26246	26247	Lady Broadhem	166	" What are you doing , Frank ? what an unheard - of proceeding ! I insist upon your leaving my papers here . "
26821	26837	26246	26247	Lady Broadhem	166	" If I do , you must look elsewhere for the money . No , Lady Broadhem"—I
26859	26975	26246	26247	Lady Broadhem	166	it—"we had better understand each other clearly . You regard me at this moment in the light of your future son - in - law , and in that capacity expect me to extricate you and your family from your financial difficulties . Now I am quite capable of ' behaving badly , ' as the world calls it , at the shortest notice . I told you at Dickiefield that I was totally without principle , and we are both trusting to Ursula to reform me . But I will relinquish the pleasure of paying your debts , and the advantage of being reformed by your daughter , unless you agree to my terms . "
26976	26981	26983	26984	her ladyship	2136	" And they are ? "
26988	27064	26983	26984	her ladyship	2136	" First , that from this evening you put the entire management of your affairs into my hands , and , as a preliminary measure , allow me to take away these papers , giving me a note to your lawyer authorising him to follow my instructions in everything ; and , secondly , that you never , under any pretence , enter into any company or speculation of any kind except with my permission .

I am subject to fits of violent nervous depression , and the agitation of this scene has completely overcome me ; my brain seems stunned , and all my faculties have become torpid . I can think of nothing more now , do what you like ; all I want is to go to sleep . If you ring the bell in that corner , Jenkins will come down . Good - night ; I shall see you to - morrow . Take the papers with you . "

If I ca n't convert them , if I must be ' done ' by them , I will ' do ' to them as I would be ' done ' by ; and rather than leave them to perish , will adopt an extreme measure , and keep on suffocating them with the mud they delight to revel in , till they cry aloud for help . What a pleasure it would be to wash Spiffy all over afterwards , and start him fresh and sweet in a new line of life ! "

29428	29436	29441	29441	he	110	" Well , my dear old fellow , "
29447	29552	29441	29441	he	110	" how mysterious and spasmodic you have been in your movements ! I was afraid even now , if I had not invaded the sanctity of your dressing - room , that you would have slipped through my fingers . I know you have a great deal to tell me , of interest to us both , and we are too fast friends to hesitate to confide in each other on any matters which affect our happiness . True men never have any reticence as between themselves ; they only have recourse to that armour when they happen to be cursed with false friends . "
29829	29832	29833	29833	he	110	" Come , "
29836	30004	29833	29833	he	110	" I will tell you exactly , first , everything I suspect , and then everything I know , and then what I think about it , so that you will have as little of the labour of revelation as possible . First of all , I suspect that you imagine that I had proposed to Lady Ursula Newlyte before we met the other day at Dickiefield : I need not say that in that case I should have told you as much upon the evening we parted ; I pledge you my word I have never uttered a syllable to Lady Ursula from which she could suspect the state of my feelings towards her , and she has never given me any indication that she returned my affection ; I therefore did not mention myself when you told me your intention of proposing to her at Dickiefield ; I only do so now in consequence of a letter which I received from Lady Broadhem last night . "
30005	30012	30014	30014	I	0	" A letter from Lady Broadhem ? "
30018	30021	30022	30022	he	717	" Yes , "
30025	30140	30022	30022	he	717	" in which she encloses a copy of one of yours containing a proposal to Lady Ursula , and informs me that you were aware , when you made it , of the difficulties you might have to encounter through me . She goes on to say that , whatever may have been her daughter 's feelings towards me at one time , they have completely changed , as she at once accepted you ; and she winds up with the rather unnecessary remark that this is the less to be regretted by me , as under no circumstances would I have obtained either her consent or that of Lord Broadhem . And so , "
30166	30301	30302	30302	He	719	him—"and so , you see , my dear Frank , it is all for the best . In the first place , she never loved me . I have too high an opinion of her to suppose that if she had , she would have accepted you ; in the second , she would never have married me against her mother 's consent — and so , even if she had loved me , we should have both been miserable ; and thirdly , if there is one thing that could console me under such a blow , it is , that the man she loves , and the family approve , is my dear old friend , who is far more worthy the happiness in store for him than I should have been . "
30671	30675	30676	30676	he	110	" Believe me , "
30679	30733	30676	30676	he	110	" I do not think one particle the worse of you for what you have done ; I know how difficult it is to control one 's feelings in moments of passion ; and you see you were quite right not to believe Lady Broadhem when she told you Ursula cared for me . "
30734	30742	30743	30743	I	0	" I had already written the letter , "
30747	30822	30743	30743	I	0	" Of course you had : I never supposed you could do the dishonourable thing of hearing she cared about me first , and writing to her afterwards , although Lady Broadhem said so . When you did make the discovery that Lady Ursula 's affections were not already engaged , you were perfectly right to win her if you could . I only bargain that you ask me to be your best man . "
30850	30855	30856	30856	I	0	" My dear Grandon , "

I was going to say , Till then , believe me and trust me ; but I need not , for I know that , however unnatural it seems for me to ask you not to allude again to the subject we have just been discussing , you will be satisfied that I would not ask it without having a reason which if you knew you would approve . On my conscience I believe that I am right in reserving from you my full confidence for the first time in my life ; but do not let the fact of one forbidden topic alienate us — let it rather act as another link , hidden for the moment , but which may some day prove the most powerful to bind us together . "
31066	31126	31055	31055	Grandon	110	" I trust and believe in you from the bottom of my soul , and you shall bury any subject you like till it suits you to exhume it . Come , we will go to breakfast , and I will discourse to you on the political and military expediency of spending — 200,000 on the fortifications of Quebec . "

31142	31228	31132	31132	I	0	" for a man who is yearning to be honest , and to do the right thing by everybody , I have got into as elaborate a complication of lies as if I were a Russian diplomatist . First , I have given both Lady Broadhem and Grandon distinctly to understand that I am at this moment engaged to Ursula , which I am not ; and secondly , I have solemnly assured that young lady herself that I am conscious of being occasionally mad .

31600	31781	31593	31593	he	159	" I ca n't afford to take you up yet ; indeed , what have you ever done to merit it ? and Mrs Gorgon Tompkins has enough to do this season to keep her own head above water without attempting to float you . I did what I could for her last night , but she ca n't expect to go on with her successes of last year . We had a regular scene at 6 A.M. this morning , ' in banquet halls deserted'—tears , and all that sort of thing — nobody present but self , Gorgon , and partner . We took our last year 's list , and compared them with the invitations sent out this year . The results were painful ; only the fag - end of the diplomatic corps had responded — none of the great European powers present , and our own Cabinet most slenderly represented . Obliged to resort for young men to the byways and hedges ; no expense spared , and yet the whole affair a miserable failure . "
31782	31797	31799	31799	I.	737	" Have you tried lobsters boiled in champagne at supper , as a draw ? "
31800	31803	31805	31805	Spiffy	159	" No , "
31813	31829	31805	31805	Spiffy	159	" I did not know this sort of thing was in your line , Frank . "
31864	31965	31967	31967	Spiffy	159	" To tell you the truth , I could pull the Tompkinses through another season , but I am keeping all my best ideas for the Bodwinkles . Bodwinkles ' first ball is to cost — 2000 . He wanted me to do it for — 1500 , and I should have been able to do it for that if Mrs Bodwinkle had had any h 's ; but the crême , de la crême require an absence of aspirations to be made up to them somehow . Oh , with the extra £ 500 I can do it easily , "
31977	32047	31967	31967	Spiffy	159	" She is a comparatively young woman , you see , without daughters ; that simplifies matters very much . And then Bodwinkle can be so much more useful to political men than Gorgon Tompkins ; the only fear is that he may commit himself at a late hour at the supper - table , but I have hit on a notion which will overcome all these possible contretemps . "
32048	32053	32055	32055	I	0	" What is that ? "
32059	32101	32055	32055	I	0	" In confidence , I do n't mind telling you , as you are not in the line yourself ; but it is a master - stroke of genius . Like all great ideas , its merit lies in its simplicity . "
32102	32119	31967	31967	Spiffy	159	" Do n't keep us any longer in suspense ; I promise not to appropriate it . "
32120	32123	32125	32125	Spiffy	159	" Well , "
32129	32140	32125	32125	Spiffy	159	" I am going to pay the aristocracy to come ! "

32152	32167	32147	32147	I	0	" how on earth are you going to get them to take the money ? "
32168	32268	31967	31967	Spiffy	159	" Ah , that is the secret . Wait till the Bodwinkles ' ball . You will see how delicately I shall contrive it ; a great deal more neatly than you do when you leave your doctor 's fee mysteriously wrapped in paper upon his mantelpiece . I shall no more hurt that high sense of honour , and that utter absence of anything like snobbism which characterises the best London Society , than a French cook would offend the nostrils of his guests with an overpowering odour of garlic ; but it is a really grand idea . "

32331	32436	32327	32327	Spiffy	159	" that the idea first occurred to me in a Scotch donkey - circus , where I won , as a prize for entering the show , a red plush waistcoat worth five shillings . The fact is , Bodwinkle is so anxious to get people , he would go to any expense ; he has even offered me a commission on all the accepted invitations I send out for him , graduated on a scale proportioned to the rank of the acceptor . I am afraid it would not be considered quite the right thing to take it ; what do you think ? "
32437	32487	31967	31967	Spiffy	159	" I doubt whether society would stand that . You must bring them to it gradually . At present , I feel sure they would draw the line at a ' commission . ' Apropos of the Bodwinkles , I want to have a little private conversation with you . "
32488	32494	32496	32496	Spiffy	159	" I am awfully done , "
32498	32649	32496	32496	Spiffy	159	" I never went to bed at all last night . I got some information about Turkish certificates before I went to the Tompkinses ; then I stayed there till past six , and had to come on here at ten to turn what I knew to account . However , go ahead ; what is it in ? Jones here will do it for you . No need of mystery between us . ' Cosmopolitan district ' is the sort of thing I can conscientiously recommend — I'll tell you why : I went down to the lobby of the House last night on purpose to hear what the fellows were saying who prowl about there pushing what my wretched tailor would call ' a little bill ' through Committee . It is becoming a sort of ' ring , ' and the favourites last night were light Cosmopolitans . "

38049	38090	38047	38047	I	0	" that anybody supposes anything about it ? I have never told a soul that I was engaged to be married , and if you and your mother choose to go spreading unauthorised reports , you must take the consequences ; but"—and

In fact , both she and my mother are so incomprehensible and mysterious , that I am sure they will object to any such meeting . Whenever I have spoken to my mother about it , she always meets me with , ' For goodness ' sake , do n't breathe a word to Ursula , or you will spoil all ; ' and when , in defiance of this injunction , I did speak to Ursula , she said , in a lackadaisical way , that she had no intention of marrying any one at present ; and when I went on to say that in that case she had no business to accept you , she asked me what reason I had for supposing that she ever had done so ; and when I said , ' the assurance of my mother 's ears in the drawing - room at Dickiefield , ' she stared at me with amazement , and burst into a flood of tears .

38536	38632	38532	38532	Broadhem	166	" she does not seem to know her own mind , and I do n't feel very sure of you . However , you are master of the situation , and can arrange what you like . My mother is going to a May meeting at Exeter Hall to - morrow to hear Caribbee Islands and Chundango hold forth . I know the latter is to call for her at eleven , so if you will come at half - past , I will take care that you have an opportunity of seeing Ursula alone . "

When you told me I was acting dishonourably , an impulse of petulance made me forget what was due to Ursula , and answer my inquisitive friends as I did ; but I am on my way to Grosvenor Square now , and will put matters straight in an hour .

Of course all London will be talking of it to - day , as the Helters went away early on purpose to get to Lady Mundane 's before Scraper could arrive there with his version of the catastrophe . "

I would do anything on earth she told me ; but what spell have you thrown over her that in spite of your heartless conduct she should still implore me to love and cherish you ? How can I obey her in this when your acts are so utterly at variance with all that is noble and honourable ? I have at least one cause for gratitude , "

40842	40856	40858	40858	his	905	" but you know how perfectly hopeless our love is ; and yet , "
40868	40950	40858	40858	his	905	" I am happier loving hopelessly and knowing that I am loved , than I have ever been before . Forgive me , Frank , but I do not feel for you as I should have done had you behaved differently . You had no right to let me suppose that she had accepted you when the subject had never been breathed between you . Your conscience must tell you that you have acted in an unworthy manner towards us both . "

41044	41130	41042	41042	Grandon	110	" and I am quite sure that Lady Ursula will do the right thing . I would rather not discuss the subject any further ; we shall certainly not agree , and I am afraid that we might become more widely estranged than I should wish . Here is breakfast . It was you who last asked me to bury this unhappy subject , it is my turn now to make the same request . I wish to heaven it had never arisen between us . "

43125	43144	43122	43122	I	0	" that it is necessary to inflict a temporary pain to avert what might become a permanent misery . "
43145	43151	43153	43153	she	124	" I can not conceive , "
43155	43303	43153	43153	she	124	" to what permanent misery , as affecting myself , you can allude , in which your intervention should be necessary , more especially when exhibited in a form which places me in such a false position . I need not say that the announcement which I saw for the first time in a newspaper caused me the greatest annoyance ; but when I found afterwards that my mother , my brother , and even Lord Grandon , had heard it from your own lips many weeks before , and that in fact you had given my mother , under a promise that she would not allude to the subject to me , such a totally erroneous idea of what passed at our interview at Dickiefield,—when I thought of all this , I could only account for it by the last revelation you made to me there . "
43492	43511	43477	43477	her	982	" Lady Ursula , would you have any objection to regarding me in the light of a straw ? "

Remember Chundango 's conduct at Dickiefield — remember the view Lady Broadhem took of it , until I interposed , or as I should more accurately say , until the current swept me past her — remember that up to this moment she has never recurred to the subject of Mr Chundango , who , although he comes to the house constantly , now devotes himself entirely to Lady Broadhem herself ; and , allow me to say it , you owe it all to a timely straw .

44203	44305	44196	44197	Lady Ursula	124	" I have already alluded to the circumstance which has induced me to treat you with a forbearance which I could not have extended to one whom I regarded as responsible for conduct unwarrantable towards myself , and certainly not to be justified by any possible advantage which I might be supposed to derive from it . I consented to see you now , because I feel sure that when you know from my own lips that I wish you at once to deny the rumour you have been the means of originating , I may depend upon your doing so . "
44306	44311	44312	44312	I	0	" May I ask , "
44322	44333	44312	44312	I	0	" what explanation you gave Lady Broadhem on the subject ? "
44334	44339	44341	44342	Lady Ursula	124	" If you mean , "
44344	44461	44341	44342	Lady Ursula	124	" whether I accounted to mamma for your conduct as I do to myself — in other words , whether I betrayed your secret — I have carefully refrained from discussing the subject with her . Fortunately , after dinner at the Whitechapels ' last night , Broadhem told me that he had seen you , and that you were coming here to - day , so I assured mamma that she would hear from you the true state of the case ; though , of course , I felt myself bound to let her understand that , owing to a fact which I was unable to explain , she had been completely misled by you . "
44462	44470	44471	44471	I	0	" And what did Lady Broadhem say ? "
44474	44529	44471	44471	I	0	" She said that had it not been for a meeting she was obliged to attend this morning , she would have waited to see you to - day ; but that she was sure I laboured under some strange delusion , and that a few words of explanation from you would smooth everything . "
44530	44544	44546	44546	I.	0	" Will you allow me to tell you what those few words are ? "
44547	44656	44546	44546	I.	0	" Lady Broadhem little imagines the real state of the case , because she knows what you do not know , that I am engaged in clearing off her own pecuniary liabilities , and making arrangements by which the old - standing claims on the Broadhem estates may be met . You may never have heard how seriously the family is embarrassed , and how unlucky all Lady Broadhem 's attempts to retrieve its fortunes by speculation have been . I could only account to her for the pecuniary sacrifices she knows I am making by allowing her to suppose that I was incurring them for your sake . "
44712	44727	44729	44729	I	0	" Is she crying because this last speech of mine proves me hopelessly mad ? "
44731	44757	44729	44729	I	0	" or does she feel herself in a pecuniary trap , and is she crying because she does not see her way out of it ? "

Spiffy gave me some curious statistics about invitations and the means employed to obtain them . Three ladies who never asked him to their parties , and whom he had therefore left out , though all more or less leaders of the beau monde , actually wrote to Mrs Bodwinkle in various strains — one was a threatening , the other an appealing letter , and the third assumed that she had been omitted by mistake . Two young gentlemen had the impertinence , after trying every other mode in vain , actually to call on Mrs Bodwinkle , and extract invitations from that bewildered woman , who was too much frightened to refuse them . Bodwinkle was not idle in the House , and two Liberals and an extreme Radical , all young , unable to resist temptation , voted against the Government on the promise of invitations . As for Spiffy , even he was acquiring fresh social experience , and tells me he can scarcely resist entering upon a pecuniary exploitation of his position in society . "
48240	48248	47994	47994	they	1119	" said that enterprising and original individual , "

49613	49631	49524	49524	they	1157	" he said , turning to Spiffy , for whose talents he evidently entertained a high admiration , "

50064	50093	50058	50062	the majority of my countrymen	1179	" Spiffy seemed deeply impressed by the superior force and originality of conception displayed by Mr Wog — no indication of these qualities appearing on his calm exterior . "

50458	50560	50579	50579	I	0	" But Mr Wog failed to appreciate the force of my remark , as he was intently endeavouring to catch the purport of a very private conversation carried on by a group a few yards off , towards which he gradually edged , in the hope that he might be able either to acquire or impart some interesting information . Spiffy looked more humbled and crestfallen than I had ever seen him ; but remembering that he had still a score unsettled , in consequence of the remark which Mr Wog 's arrival had interrupted , he said , maliciously , — "

50807	50858	50797	50798	Lady Ursula	124	" I said in a low tone , and took a chair by his side . He nodded sulkily , and showed a disposition to cut me . My last few words with Spiffy had not left me in a mood to be cut unresistingly , so I said sharply , "
50915	50916	50917	50917	I	0	" "
50926	50958	50917	50917	I	0	" said Broadhem , who felt that somehow I was more to blame than he was , but who was taken aback by my turning the tables upon him so suddenly ; "

51565	51784	51560	51560	I	0	" and Broadhem plunged back into the correspondence in which I had interrupted him , while I strolled home down Piccadilly moralising on — the Century . I do n't frequent balls now , but I went to Bodwinkle 's for a variety of reasons . One was , that I knew I should see everybody , and have an opportunity of informing the public correctly about my own affairs . Another , that I should be able to talk over some business matters with Bodwinkle , at a moment when he might possibly be more pliant than I usually found him in the City . Every soul was at Bodwinkle's — coroneted carriages filled the square ; a crowd of draggled men and women formed a line six or eight deep on each side of the awning , and between them fine ladies hurried across the pavement , encouraged and complimented by familiar linkmen , and very particular that the ' Morning Post ' reporter , seated at a table in the hall , should take down their names accurately . The stairs were so crowded that Bodwinkle , who looked like one of his own footmen , and stood at the top of them , facing his wife , was red and apoplectic from pressure . His "
51787	51842	51560	51560	I	0	" as I heard one of his City friends call her , had achieved the greatest object of her ambition in this life , which consisted in grinning vacantly , and curtsying perpetually to people she had never seen in her life before , and every one of whom despised her for entertaining them .

51852	51884	51560	51560	I	0	" I remarked to Lady Veriphast , who was so tightly wedged between the banisters and a rather highly - scented ambassador from Central Asia , that she spoke with difficulty ; "

51936	51948	51929	51929	you	1220	" said Lady Veriphast , in a tone of suppressed anguish . "

51966	51983	51964	51964	Madam	1221	" I overheard a well - known voice say in a nasal tone close to me , "
52018	52054	52016	52016	Mary	215	" and Mr Wog complacently edged himself from the side of Lady Mundane to that of the daughter he had eulogised , and who audibly asked Scraper to get between her and that horrid man . "
52066	52087	52088	52088	I	0	" said Lady Mundane furiously , who , by the way , had repeatedly asked Wog to her own parties . "
52095	52111	52088	52088	I	0	" said Mr Wog , who I think overheard this observation , turning to me , "

"
52304	52332	52333	52333	I	0	" asked Mr Wog , who observed Lady Veriphast 's confusion , and whose thirst for information seemed to increase with his powers of making himself disagreeable ; "

52435	52443	52395	52395	I	0	" said Lady Pimlico to Lady Mundane , "
52450	52518	52446	52448	the two Frenchwomen	1236	" and she directed universal attention to the last importations from the Continent , Madame la Princesse de Biais — e — la Queue , and La Baronne de Colt — , whose fame had preceded them from Paris , and who created such a sensation that the general hum on the stairs increased , and the whole society collected there audibly criticised the new - comers . "
52560	52589	52590	52590	They	1236	" This remark was made so loud that both ladies looked up , but failed to check the running fire of comments which their dress and appearance suggested . "
52605	52613	52592	52593	the Princess	1238	" drawled out Larkington to Lady Veriphast ; "

52710	52840	52708	52708	you	1240	" I think Mrs Bodwinkle heard the speech — for it is customary in good society to make remarks about one 's neighbours in rather a loud tone — as she coloured a little when she was pointed out to Larkington by the fat butler as the person to whom he was expected to bow . Poor woman ! she probably thought he would be embarrassed when he found out his proximity ; but Larkington is above any such weakness , and sauntered on after Lady Veriphast , with whom he has affichéd himself for the last few weeks , to the great comfort of Veriphast , who has long been desirous of making his wife share the scandal which has attached to his name for some time past . "
52852	52856	52849	52850	Mrs Bodwinkle	168	" I thought , "
53123	53504	53526	53526	you	116	" And this consideration reminds me that I possess middle - class readers , who may positively doubt the truth of the picture which I am endeavouring to give them of the society in which Mrs Bodwinkle now found herself . They will not have the advantage of hearing from the lips of that good lady these wonderful traits of the manners and customs of this , to them , mysterious class . And therefore they will fail to see any particular merit in what they may suppose to be merely a flippant delineation of a purely ideal state of society . My dear readers , I should be no more competent to invent a state of society so eccentric in its habits and constitution as this of London cream , than I should be to write an account of lion - hunting like the late lamented Jules Gerard . That was a real strain upon the imaginative and constructive faculties ; I aspire to no such talent , but simply contemplate hyperbolically a certain phase of contemporary civilisation . If , by way of a little pastime , I put Mayfair into a fancy dress , it only appears in its true colours and becomes fancy - fair , with a great deal of show and very little substance ; so I dress it up as it pleases me , but I invent nothing . I confine myself strictly to the stage properties . You in the pit or gallery may be too far off to see , but I assure you I have avoided anything beyond the exaggeration permissible in a caricature . As I know your imitative faculties , dear middle classes , I can conscientiously assure you that you may take ' Piccadilly ' as a guide upon which to frame your own society . Take the most successful costermonger of the neighbourhood and erect him into a Bodwinkle , and fall down upon your knees before the most opulent pawnbroker of your parish ; and you will feel that you are only performing , on a humble scale , the same act of worship as those above you . Lady Jane Helter , followed by Wild Harrie , came up while I was thus musing . "

54254	54320	54245	54245	you	221	" The ray came back again ; he was sufficiently experienced to know what that meant , and Lord Haultort disappeared into the next room with his idée fixe on his arm , and I looked the other way half an hour after , when I passed the corresponding recess in which Larkington and Lady Veriphast were still sitting , and saw who were there .

54334	54352	54324	54326	that little girl	1265	" I ruminated , and for some time I was positively fool enough to continue to wonder . "

54658	54677	54654	54654	hers	166	" and Bodwinkle , quite unconscious that he was behaving like a scoundrel , smiled upon me blandly . "
54683	54687	54654	54654	hers	166	" said I , "
54698	54707	54708	54708	you	221	" and I looked round the crowded room , "

56327	56337	56325	56325	Gentlemen	607	" says Spiffy to the independent electors of Shuffleborough , "
56534	56574	56575	56575	I	0	" Though a member of the Church of England , I am in favour of the total abolition of Church - rates , as I believe that you will spiritualise the Church precisely in proportion as you starve it . "

To increase the wealth of the nation and to foster its Christian spirit , will be recognised by me as a primary duty , if I am honoured with the high trust of being your representative in the Commons House of Parliament . "
56807	57027	57028	57028	I	0	" Gentlemen,—The appearance of a third candidate in the Liberal interest within the last few days induces me to break the silence which I have up to this time preserved . I have observed with pain that in many instances the addresses issued by gentlemen calling themselves Liberal Conservatives or Conservative Reformers , are of the most subversive tendency , and entirely opposed to the spirit of that old and enlightened party to which I have the honour to belong . I repudiate , therefore , entirely that temporising language which a large number of candidates calling themselves Conservatives hold , and which it has suited one of my opponents , who calls himself a Liberal , to adopt . I believe I shall best recommend myself to this constituency by an honest and unswerving advocacy of those views which the Tory party of this country have invariably maintained . More fondly attached , if possible , to the Church of England than I was upon the occasion when I last addressed you , I am more than ever convinced that money is the only thing that keeps it going . I am therefore entirely opposed to the abolition of those rates which form the foundation of that pillar upon which the State has been accustomed securely to repose . "
57104	57134	57135	57135	I	0	" I am in favour of a measure which shall largely increase the armaments of the country , and at the same time reduce the cost of their maintenance . "
57183	57232	57157	57157	they	1347	" In a word , should you do me the honour to return me as your member , you will find me Liberal only in my views as to the modes in which money may be acquired , and Conservative always when there is a question of expenditure . "
57363	57635	57357	57357	I	0	" Gentlemen,—In announcing my intention not to solicit your suffrages at the approaching general election , I feel that it is due to you that I should state the reason why I do not again seek the high honour which you have upon two previous occasions conferred upon me , of representing you in Parliament . The prosperity of the country is now so great that I feel it has no further need of my services . In default of any great question of national importance , the rival political parties are reduced to the lamentable predicament of having nothing to fight for except office . As I have never taken the slightest interest in the fortunes of either party , except as embodying or representing the triumph of certain principles , the disappearance of those principles , and the difficulty of distinguishing by their expressed opinions between one party and the other , renders it quite impossible for me to follow the example of the candidates on both sides , and to stand upon — nothing ! Gentlemen , I have no doubt that before very long something will turn up for me to stand upon . I will wait till then . Meantime , I feel that to profess any decided convictions upon matters either of home or foreign politics at this juncture would be considered in bad taste , if not impertinent , and I shall therefore reserve whatever I have to say for a future occasion , when the exigencies of the country may render it absolutely necessary that some individual in it should have an opinion . "
57698	57702	57703	57703	I	0	" In conclusion , "
57707	58307	57703	57703	I	0	" I beg to offer a tribute to the only article of political faith in which you still believe , and to place — 1000 at the disposal of the mayor and corporation , which , in addition to the money spent in the contest that my retirement will render inevitable , will , I trust , not only be of substantial service to the borough , but secure my re - election upon any future occasion . Good - night , Dunderheadians . If in spite of this you send me a requisition to stand again , I will decline on a ground simple enough even for your comprehension — It is too hot ! It was no business of mine , after the explanation which I had had with Lady Ursula upon the subject of our rumoured engagement , to revert to the topic with any of her family . If Lady Broadhem was dissatisfied with the position of affairs , I supposed that I should hear of it quite soon enough ; my only anxiety was about Ursula herself . I trembled for her domestic peace and comfort . Broadhem 's few words about his sister 's happiness under the altered circumstances were very significant , and I determined therefore to get her ladyship as much in my power as possible , by exercising to its utmost extent the right which I had wrung from her of a full control over her pecuniary affairs . If my wealth did not enable me to purchase my own happiness , it should at least enable me to secure the happiness of her whom I loved best in the world . I had never wavered in my resolution somehow or other to effect this great end , but my plans must of necessity undergo some change now that Lady Broadhem 's eyes were opened to the real state of the case . I was much puzzled what to do about Grandon . Sometimes I felt a yearning to take him fully into my confidence and consult with him upon that delicate topic which touched us both so nearly ; but though he was kind and considerate as ever , there was a constraint about our intercourse of which we were both painfully conscious . We avoided all allusion to the Broadhems , and he never called in Grosvenor Square , nor , so far as I know , had met Lady Ursula since the memorable dinner which had terminated so disagreeably for us all . Under the circumstances , I had also thought the wisest , and for many reasons the most proper , course for me was , to abstain from going there until I should hear from Lady Broadhem ; and although I was anxious to consult her upon many business matters , I preferred letting them remain in abeyance to courting an interview which I dreaded . At last I began to think Lady Broadhem 's silence rather ominous . I felt that a thunder - cloud had been gathering for some time past , and that the sooner it burst the better . I occasionally found myself walking past the door of the house , and wondering what was going on inside it . I felt that there would be something undignified about pumping Broadhem , and yet every time I met him I experienced an irresistible desire to do so . At last one day he volunteered a remark , from which I gathered that he was as anxious for information as I was . "
58315	58319	58309	58309	you	1354	" he began . "
58324	58325	58309	58309	you	1354	" "
58343	58344	58329	58329	she	417	" "
58352	58356	58329	58329	she	417	" I said ; "
58365	58366	58367	58367	She	417	" "
58372	58376	58367	58367	She	417	" said Broadhem ; "
58416	58417	58419	58419	she	417	" "
58425	58429	58419	58419	she	417	" I asked . "
58515	58523	58509	58509	I	0	" said Broadhem , with a sigh ; "
58547	58548	58549	58549	I	0	" "
58631	58632	58629	58629	you	166	" "
58635	58646	58629	58629	you	166	" said Broadhem , and he coloured and looked away ; "
58666	58667	58659	58659	she	240	" "
58739	58801	58735	58735	her	240	" and I saw the flush of gratified vanity mount to the brow of Broadhem , and no longer wondered why Wild Harrie had expressed a wish to make Lady Ursula 's acquaintance . Poor Ursula ! what Broadhem had said about his mother 's change of manner decided me not to neglect the opportunity which presented itself of going to her "
58804	58853	58735	58735	her	240	" and coming to a distinct understanding with Lady Broadhem upon the present position of affairs . I had no doubt that that veteran campaigner had not been idle ; and I was afraid , under the circumstances , that too much time had already been allowed her . "
58865	58879	58855	58855	you	166	" asked Broadhem , who had maintained an embarrassed silence during this interval . "
58898	58902	58888	58888	she	240	" I replied . "
58910	58914	58888	58888	she	240	" he said , awkwardly—"in

59222	59248	59211	59211	I	0	" and I pressed his hand . I had never cared about him for his own sake , but my heart warmed towards him for hers .

For the benefit of those of my readers who have never been admitted within the sacred precincts of the religious world , I should tell them that there is nothing in their outward appearance to distinguish them from the other world . The old ladies come in , followed by trains of daughters , furbelowed and flounced by the same dressmakers who clothe worldly people ; but there is a greater variety of men — the older ones are often snuffy , and look unwashed . They constantly wear thick boots , and their black waistcoats are not embroidered , and button higher up , which gives them a more staid appearance . They are generally pervaded by an air of complacency and calm superiority , and converse in measured unctuous accents , checkered by beaming smiles when they are not contradicted . The youths , on the other hand , present in most cases an intellectually weak aspect . They are quite as much addicted to flirting with the young ladies as if they belonged to the other world , but want that hardihood , not to say impertinence , which characterises the lavender - gloved tribe who are still heathens . The arrangement of the room is somewhat that of a private concert , only instead of a piano is a table , behind which are seated Joseph Caribbee Islands , Chundango , and several other lay and clerical performers . In the centre of this table is a vase , which Joseph hopes to see filled with subscriptions before the proceedings terminate . There is a suspicion , however , that things may not go off quite smoothly , as a lay member present , who does a good deal of amateur preaching , intends to take him to task about certain unsound views which we knew our friend Joseph entertains . I am sorry to say that some of the young gentlemen leaning in the doorway , where I stand , anticipate this encounter with apparent satisfaction . Among them is Broadhem , who has never once taken his eyes off Wild Harrie . That young lady is more plainly dressed than anybody else in the room . Her hair is neatly and modestly drawn back . She might have risked a larger chignon , but she had never been to an entertainment of this kind before , and did not know how they dressed ; her eyes are only now and then furtively raised , and she takes a quick glance round the room , winding up with Broadhem ; and a twitching at the corners of her mouth makes me envy Amy Rumsort , who will , no doubt , receive a most graphic and embellished report of the whole affair . There is a good deal of murmuring and rustling and getting into places , and a few hardy men manage to squeeze themselves next the crinoline of their especial desire , and then they go on whispering and tittering to each other , till Joseph says in a very loud tone — Ahem ! On which a general silence . It seems as impossible and incongruous for me to write here what now takes place , as it did at the time to take part in it . It requires no stretch of imagination on the part of my readers to divine what movement it was which caused the next general rustle . Remember that a great proportion of these young ladies were brought here by their mammas , and in their secret souls would have rather been at a ball ; but their mammas disapproved of balls , and made them do this instead . Now , tell me , which was most wrong ? I knew of one young lady , at least , whose object in coming was not to do what she was then doing . How many young men would have been there had there been no young ladies ? and what were they all thinking about now ? And as I looked at the subscription - vase , and listened to the monotonous voice of a "
60877	60908	60909	60909	they	1415	" behind it , who had been called upon to open the proceedings , I thought , Can it be possible that these are those of whom it is said , "
60922	60956	60909	60909	they	1415	" ? Can it be possible to put anything into that vase without the right hand knowing what the left hand is doing , and all the people seeing both hands ? Is not "
60959	60963	60909	60909	they	1415	" even now being "
60965	60967	60909	60909	they	1415	" by "
60970	60975	60978	60978	men	1940	" that they may have "
60979	61013	60978	60978	men	1940	" ? Is there , in fact , any difference , practically , between kneeling in Lady Broadhem 's drawing - room , by way of an after - dinner entertainment , and loving "
61036	61088	61089	61089	Rabbi	1423	" ? Is there any part of a clergyman 's dress called a phylactery ; and if so , when he becomes a bishop , does the hem of it become broader ? and if it was wrong for a priest in Jerusalem , eighteen hundred years ago , to be called "
61093	61106	61091	61091	Rabbi	1423	" is it less wrong for one in London now to be called "
61112	61190	61091	61091	Rabbi	1423	" ? I was thinking how much more usefully Bishop Colenso would have been employed in pointing out those anomalies in the practice of his religion , instead of the discrepancies in its records , and what a much stronger case the Zulu might have made out against Christians if he had known as much of the countries which they inhabit as I do , when the rustling again became general , and the monotonous voice ceased . "
61195	61255	61091	61091	Rabbi	1423	" began Joseph — and here I may remark that this epithet is only applied by the worldly - holies to one another — one of the chief characteristics of those who belong to the religious world being constantly to talk as though they were a privileged few , a chosen flock , and as though that new commandment , "
61262	61357	61257	61257	ye	1428	" was applicable only as among themselves , and consisted chiefly in addressing one another in affectionate and complimentary terms . Even these they withhold , not merely from the wholly - worldlies , but from those who differ from them upon all points of doctrine which they assume to be vital . Hence , by constantly toadying and flattering each other , they insensibly foster that description of pride which apes humility , and acquire that air of subdued arrogance which is so displeasing to society at large . So when Joseph said , "
61362	61379	61358	61360	Dear Christian friends	1898	" there was clearly written on the self - satisfied faces of most of the audience , "
61390	61502	61384	61384	you	1428	" or words to that effect . Now let me in a little more detail tell who some of these friends were . The religious world in London being a very large and well - to - do world , they want religious lawyers , and religious bankers , and religious doctors ; they like to get their wine from somebody who holds sound views , but I think they cease to be so particular about the principles of those from whom they get their bonnets . However that may be about trades , the demand is immediately met in all the professions , and young men starting in life with a "
61504	61540	61257	61257	ye	1428	" in the religious world must belong to it if they wish to succeed . This is another anomaly . In former times it involved stripes , persecution , poverty , and contumely to be a "
61543	61546	61257	61257	ye	1428	" but a "
61550	61743	61744	61747	dear Christian friends "	2807	" of the present day need be afraid of none of these things . He would never be called mad for making a profession of the views of the early Christians ; but he would if , with a good religious opening in a professional point of view , he declined to take advantage of it . Then look what society it gets you into — you become a sort of brother ; and , I am sorry to say , I know several young men who saw no chance of getting into the fashionable world , and who took to the other as a good introduction . In fact there was one standing in the doorway with me , the son of a solicitor I knew at Dunderhead , who was in the office of his uncle , who was Lady Broadhem 's solicitor . Do you think either he or his uncle were sincere , or that he would have ever had the slightest chance of paying attention to Lady Bridget , which he positively had the presumption to do , if he had not enrolled himself in the band of "
61747	62044	62045	62045	Ladies	1432	" ? He is a very good hand at the doctrine of love when the people to be loved are the aristocracy . He has just invited me on the part of his uncle to a conversazione , at which will be exhibited a converted Aztec , and at which that Christian solicitor , whose wife is a fat woman fanning herself in the front row , will positively induce the great majority of those now here , including a fair sprinkling of persons with titles , to be present . Now far be it from me to imply that there are not earnest , sincere , and to some extent self - sacrificing , professors of the Christian religion , who I know will persist in mistaking me , and imagine that by writing this I bring the religion itself into contempt . I say again that those who bring it into the most contempt are those who profess it most , and that it is to counteract their prejudicial influence upon society that I venture to incur their animosity . I shall not report Joseph 's speech at length , still less attempt to follow Chundango in his unctuous remarks , in the course of which he lavished flattery upon his audience to an extent even beyond what they could bear ; they swallowed it , however , with tea and ices , which were handed round , but I got so worked up at last by a smooth - faced man who was describing what he had gone through for the sake of the heathen , while he was living luxuriously in one of the most charming little mission establishments which I have ever visited , that I made the following remarks : — "
62096	62321	62322	62322	Ladies	1432	" The Bishop of the Caribbee Islands , in the course of the very graphic account which he has given you of the progress of conversion in his diocese , and of the number of interesting and instructive deathbeds which he has witnessed , has entered into a calculation by which it would appear that the average cost of the conversion of a human soul in those islands is a little over — 6 . Ladies , you pretend to believe that , but you do n't . It would be impossible for you to sit there with strings of lost human souls round your necks , and what would keep an infant school in each ear , if you really believed that you could save a soul for — 6 . You come here and listen to gentlemen who give you an account of the sacrifices they make for the heathen , and of results which do not look so well on the spot as on paper ; and because you throw a pound into that vase in the presence of the company , you think that you have done something for them too . ' They may give up all , ' you say , ' but we ca n't afford to save more than two or three souls per annum . ' "
62383	62409	62376	62382	a young man of the lower middles	1441	" ( Mr Beevy 's father was a butcher , so I did not like to enter more fully into this part of the subject ) "
62784	62915	62916	62916	My	0	" Do you think it is the fault of the religion that you do n't make converts , or the fault of the system under which it is propagated ? If you gave up ' the enticing words of man 's wisdom , ' and tried a little of ' the demonstration of the spirit and of power , ' do n't you think the result would be different ? If you are only illumined by ' a dim religious light ' yourselves , how do you expect to dissipate the gross darkness of paganism ? You have only got an imitation blaze that warms nobody at home , and you wonder when you take it abroad that it leaves everybody as cold and as dead as it finds them . "
63046	63176	63038	63038	I	0	" I was so excited while delivering myself of these observations that I was quite unconscious of the effect I was producing . I remember there was a deathlike silence , and that when I sat down the gentlemen behind the table looked flushed and agitated . Mr Beevy first rose to reply to observations which , he said , reflected upon him personally , no less than upon the society to which he was proud to say he belonged . He then explained the circumstances under which he had been induced to give — 65 for the horse ; and retaliated upon me in language which I will spare my readers now , as they will see it in the ' Discord , ' when that organ of the "
63180	63217	63038	63038	I	0	" does me the honour to review this veracious history . The religious world has a more choice catalogue of epithets for their enemies than any other section of the community . I need not therefore suggest "
63219	63309	63038	63038	I	0	" as appropriate to the present occasion . It was the term applied to me by the amateur lay - preacher after Mr Beevy sat down . Finally , the proceedings terminated in some confusion ; before they did , however , I rose again to point out how completely the conduct of those present had proved my case — either the faults to which I alluded existed , and there was nothing more to be said ; or I had buffeted them without cause , and they had not "
63314	63353	63038	63038	I	0	" a course of conduct quite inexcusable in a meeting composed exclusively of dear Christian friends . If there is a thing I yearn for , it is the love of my fellow - men . By making the "
63357	63400	63038	63038	I	0	" consider me an enemy , I ought to secure an unusual share of their affection . Remember , now , if you abuse me for this , it is unchristian ; if you leave me alone , you will be treating me "
63407	63466	63038	63038	I	0	" and that is unchristian too ; the right thing for you to do is to take the charitable view , to admit that my motives may be good , even if the means employed are injudicious . When I am abruptly asked in an omnibus , by an entire stranger , who may happen to belong to the "
63470	63496	63038	63038	I	0	" the most solemn question which one man can put to another , I do not resent it . I believe he is sincerely trying to "
63499	63502	63038	63038	I	0	" with a "
63507	63593	63038	63038	I	0	" I question the taste , but I respect the motive . Do the same to me , dear friends . We are all bad , and I am far worse than any of you ; but still I may show how bad the best of us are . By living in a fool 's paradise here , we shall not qualify ourselves for the other one to come . Depend upon it , we are all a great deal too comfortable to be safe . "
63597	63623	63594	63595	Lord Frank	116	" said Lady Broadhem while Joseph was emptying the vase and pocketing the contents , and the rest of the world was beginning to circulate , "
63649	63650	63647	63647	you	116	" "
63660	63664	63657	63658	Lady Broadhem	166	" I said . "
63715	63716	63702	63702	my	0	" "
63723	63737	63738	63738	I	0	" said her ladyship , more angry than I had ever seen her . "
63759	63787	63745	63745	I	0	" and Lady Broadhem shuddered at the idea of having exhibited myself as I had done , if I had been her son - in - law . "
63815	63857	63808	63808	I	0	" I said maliciously . All my better nature seemed to leave me as I found myself involved in a fresh encounter with this woman , who certainly possesses the art of raising my devil beyond any one I ever met . "
63866	63899	63858	63858	I	0	" said Lady Broadhem , who did not wish to be too manifestly discovered without her Christian spirit , though there was not much of it left in anybody in the room . "
63930	63998	63999	63999	I	0	" and she intercepted the missionary as he was advancing towards me with a somewhat truculent air . All this time I had seen , but not had an opportunity of exchanging a word with Ursula , who occupied an obscure corner , and seemed anxious to attract as little notice as possible . I made my way to her now . She looked careworn and nervous . "
64015	64019	64012	64013	Lord Frank	116	" she said ; "
64071	64072	64057	64057	you	1470	" "
64122	64123	64114	64114	they	1472	" "
64207	64208	64185	64185	you	1470	" "
64305	64306	64308	64308	you	1470	" "
64326	64331	64308	64308	you	1470	" said Lady Ursula . "
64498	64499	64491	64491	he	1486	" "
64510	64515	64502	64502	he	1486	" replied Lady Ursula . "
64536	64537	64534	64534	you	0	" "
64567	64568	64556	64556	he	1486	" "
64656	64697	64649	64649	you	0	" I gave Ursula an account of Wild Harrie , based on Spiffy 's information , not very flattering , I am afraid , to that young lady , and wound up with something about putting Broadhem on his guard . "
64707	64711	64649	64649	you	0	" she replied ; "
64799	64800	64796	64797	Miss Wylde	240	" "
64820	64821	64812	64813	Miss Wylde	240	" "
64839	64866	64867	64867	I	0	" said Lady Ursula , with a sigh , and I knew there was a secret grief which she could not tell hidden in her words . "
64909	64910	64911	64911	I	0	" "
64924	64950	64913	64913	they	1489	" I said , as I saw the enemies I love , but who do n't return the affection , ranging themselves behind the table ; "
64983	65000	64974	64974	I	0	" and I left Lady Ursula , and had to squeeze past Broadhem and Wild Harrie . "
65005	65012	65001	65001	You	1490	" I said to the latter , "
65020	65021	65022	65022	I	0	" "
65160	65259	65151	65151	you	122	" Wild Harrie went on , her eyes dancing with mischief as she turned to Broadhem . The struggles which that young gentleman 's conscience was having with his affections were manifestly portrayed on his countenance , and Wild Harrie evidently was amusing herself by shocking his feelings . I must do her the justice to say that I do n't think she could play the hypocrite if she tried ; and I began to hope , as I looked at her frank reckless face , that her sins were more on the surface than in the heart . "
65269	65273	65262	65262	you	1495	" said Broadhem ; "
65308	65314	65304	65304	I	0	" he added , sententiously , "
65333	65334	65335	65335	I	0	" "
65343	65347	65340	65341	Lord Broadhem	122	" she retorted , "
65464	65465	65457	65457	my	0	" "
65472	65476	65457	65457	my	0	" said I ; "
65519	65546	65505	65506	your sister	2483	" and I walked off the young gentleman , to Wild Harrie 's disgust , and saw with satisfaction that Lady Ursula took his vacated seat . "
65554	65558	65505	65506	your sister	2483	" said Broadhem , "
65613	65614	65596	65599	no one to whom	1501	" "
65620	65623	65596	65599	no one to whom	1501	" said I. "
65666	65667	65674	65674	she	124	" "
65703	65704	65705	65705	You	240	" "
65708	65713	65705	65705	You	240	" he went on , "
65777	65778	65766	65766	she	124	" "
65818	65880	65811	65811	I	0	" I led him unresistingly to his coat and hat in the hall , and braved the stern gaze of a butler who apparently dressed after Mr Beevy , and who , when I arrived , had smiled blandly upon me as being ' one of us , ' for all the servants in Lady Broadhem 's establishment were guaranteed converted . "
65906	66009	66021	66022	her ladyship	2136	apply"—that was the form of the advertisement , and the consequence was , that every menial in the house had brought a certificate of his or her entire change of heart from their last place . Lady Broadhem was also very particular about the theological views of the family they had just left . The butler frowned severely upon me now , for he had been standing in the doorway with the cura — oa when I was addressing the meeting , no doubt sympathising keenly with Mr Beevy ( I found out afterwards that Lady Broadhem was educating his son for the "
66011	66019	66021	66022	her ladyship	2136	" ) , and said to Broadhem , "
66032	66033	66021	66022	her ladyship	2136	" "
66036	66044	66021	66022	her ladyship	2136	" said Broadhem , with some hesitation ; "
66059	66060	66061	66061	I	0	" "
66088	66099	66082	66082	James	247	" This meant that James was not to open it . "
66105	66109	66082	66082	James	247	" I said ; "
66134	66138	66141	66142	my lord	2022	" I asked . "
66144	66151	66141	66142	my lord	2022	" said the butler , rigidly . "
66174	66376	66141	66142	my lord	2022	" and I led the way up - stairs . Now it so happens that I have a remarkable faculty of remembering faces , and I had been conscious for some weeks past of being familiar with the particularly ill - favoured countenance of Lady Broadhem 's butler ; but it was not until now that the circumstances under which I had first seen it flashed upon me . Not many years have elapsed since I achieved considerable renown in Australia as an amateur hunter of bushrangers . The sport exhilarated me , combining , as it did , an exciting physical with a wholesome moral exercise . I now remembered distinctly having caught Lady Broadhem 's butler with a lasso . Indeed I had good reason not to forget it , for a shot he fired at me at the moment killed my favourite horse . That he should have failed to recognise in Lord Frank Vanecourt the notorious Mr Francis who had been the means of capturing not only himself , but a good many of his fraternity , was not wonderful . The discovery tickled me , and restored my good temper , which had been slightly ruffled . "
66405	66458	66459	66459	I	0	" I said , and my tone of anger suddenly became one of easy familiarity , as I turned sharply upon him , and , leaning against the banisters , benevolently scanned his distorted physiognomy . The play of his facial muscles , and changes of hue , interested me , so I continued—"But
66531	66532	66518	66518	I	0	" "
66538	66551	66518	66518	I	0	" he groaned , and his teeth chattered and his knees trembled , "
66574	66585	66564	66565	your lordship	1517	" and he opened a side door off the landing . "
66654	66759	66781	66781	my	0	" I knew the man to be a clever scoundrel , and saw that he evidently had some information which might prove of value . A mystery did exist — of that I had had abundant evidence . Was I justified in refusing to find the key?—besides , if this man really possessed some secret , could it be in more dangerous hands ? This last consideration decided me , and I followed the returned convict to a little sanctum of his own , which opened off the pantry , from which I emerged five minutes later a wiser if not a better man . "
66767	66771	66781	66781	my	0	" said Broadhem . "
66784	66785	66774	66774	you	2022	" "
66795	66819	66792	66792	Drippings	249	" I did not know his name , but my spirits were high , and I gave him the first my imagination suggested . "
66897	66922	66895	66895	Drippings	249	" and I passed the bewildered James , who evidently thought that both I and the terrified - looking butler had gone suddenly mad . "
66925	66929	66923	66923	Broadhem	166	" said I , "
66958	66959	66950	66950	I	0	" "
66962	66966	66950	66950	I	0	" said Broadhem , "

67050	67060	66996	66997	your mother	419	" said Broadhem , whose curiosity was getting excited . "

67098	67102	67087	67087	you	166	" said Broadhem , "

67224	67230	67218	67218	You	166	" said Broadhem , delighted ; "

67263	67267	67268	67268	I	0	" I said ; "

68041	68047	68030	68030	Broadhem	166	" he said , timidly . "

69899	69921	69922	69922	Frank	116	" Broadhem stopped suddenly in the street as I finished in a somewhat excited tone , and gasped rather than spoke , "

70852	70856	70926	70926	zealots	1666	" asked Broadhem , "

70878	70908	70926	70926	zealots	1666	you?"—and the clear solemn voice of my new companion startled Broadhem , who had not seen him join me , so that I felt his arm tremble upon mine . "

Could n't you get Veriphast to go down ? I should be delighted to retire in his favour ; and with his abilities it is ridiculous his not being in Parliament . "
72086	72117	72119	72120	her ladyship	2136	" How absurdly you talk about my persuading Veriphast to do anything ? the only person , as you know , who has any influence over him is Mrs Loveton , "
72130	72136	72119	72120	her ladyship	2136	" I have hit it ; "
72145	72206	72141	72141	Larkington	190	" Squabbleton is close to the coast , and we will make a party , and I will take you all round in my yacht , the Lovetons and you and Veriphast ; we 'll go and do the electioneering business together , and keep the yacht as a sort of pied — terre , or rather pied à mer ; "
72549	72561	72562	72562	I	0	" I went to Lady Broadhem 's last night , Grandon , "
72565	72613	72562	72562	I	0	" and I have reasons for wishing to know whether you have had any communication with the family lately . I think the time is coming when I shall be able to explain much of my conduct which I can well understand has perplexed and distressed you . "
72614	72633	72634	72634	he	110	" It would be a relief to me to feel that there was no more mystery between us , "
72637	72697	72634	72634	he	110	" You have certainly at last most effectually contradicted the report you were the means of originating , but the reparation was tardy , and should never have been rendered necessary . However , there is no use in recurring to the past ; but I am entitled to ask what your object is in making your present inquiries ? "
72698	72708	72709	72709	I	0	" I am to see Lady Broadhem this afternoon , "
72712	72762	72709	72709	I	0	" and I wish to be prepared on all points . I heard something last night which may influence your future far more seriously than mine ; and it is in fact in your interests , and not in my own , that I wish to be well informed . "
72763	72771	72634	72634	he	110	" What do you want to know ? "
72772	72797	72634	72634	he	110	" I want to know whether you have ever actually proposed to Lady Ursula , and , if so , what was the result ? "
72798	72801	72803	72803	Grandon	110	" Frank , "
72805	72934	72803	72803	Grandon	110	" after what has passed you are pushing my confidence in you , and my friendship for you , to their utmost limits , in expecting me to answer you in this matter . Still I can not believe your motives to be unworthy , though they may be unintentionally perverted ; nor do I think that it is in your power to affect the position of affairs either for good or harm . The fact is , then , that Lady Ursula does know precisely the state of my feelings towards her , and I feel that , though there may be insuperable obstacles to our union at present , she would never consent to yield to any pressure exercised by her mother in favour of another . "
72935	72968	72634	72634	he	110	" In other words , the situation is unchanged , for I think I knew as much as that before . Have you never spoken to Lady Broadhem directly on the subject ? "
72969	72972	72634	72634	he	110	" No , "
72974	72976	72634	72634	he	110	Grandon—"never . "
72977	72981	72983	72983	I	0	" I think , "
72985	73050	72983	72983	I	0	" the time is coming when you will be able to do so with advantage . I can not tell you more now , but this afternoon I shall hope to retrieve myself in your estimation by being the bearer of some good news . By the way , what are you going to do about your election?—they say your prospects are getting cloudy . "
73051	73057	73058	73058	he	1721	" Say rather utterly obscured , "
73061	73159	73058	73058	he	1721	" You know the borough I sit for is in Lord Scilly 's pocket , and he says I have not sufficiently stuck to my party . They have never forgiven me for understanding the Schleswig - Holstein question ; and Scilly has extracted a promise from his new nominee that he is never to inform himself upon any question of foreign politics . The Government is so weak in this department that they are more afraid of their own enfants terribles than they are of the Opposition , which is not saying much for the latter . "
73160	73168	73169	73169	I	0	" Who is Scilly 's new nominee ? "
73172	73183	73184	73184	he	1722	" No less a person than our old friend Chundango , "
73187	73217	73184	73184	he	1722	" It seems Lady Broadhem put pressure upon his lordship in his favour , and he at last consented , though I suspect it was with a bad grace . "
73218	73246	73262	73271	that great millionaire in a peculiarly amiable frame of mind	1725	" Well , I do n't think the Government need be afraid of Chundango on foreign policy , though he probably knows as much as the others . "
73327	73333	73334	73334	he	1722	" Ah , Lord Frank , "
73339	73396	73334	73334	he	1722	" come to give me some of your valuable advice and assistance in my election affairs , I feel sure . Do n't forget your promise about Stepton . I have already given the necessary instructions about that matter of Lady Broadhem 's ; there is nothing going to be done about it for the present . "
73397	73416	73417	73417	I	0	" It is just with reference to Lady Broadhem 's affairs that I have come to consult you , "

73433	73436	73438	73438	Bodwinkle	168	" Rather , "
73449	73519	73438	73438	Bodwinkle	168	" Now I have reason to believe that her ladyship is interested in some Bombay houses , and I shall be able to throw some light upon her affairs which may be of use to us both , if you will give me the benefit of a little of that exclusive information with reference to cotton and those who are embarked in its trade which I know you possess .

73627	73713	73624	73624	he	1729	" I trust , my lord , that under the circumstances your lordship will not betray me — my own livelihood , not to say that of my wife and little ones , depends upon my keeping this place ; and I would not have mentioned what had come to my knowledge with respect to her ladyship if it had not been that , knowing the interest your lordship takes in the family , and more especially when I come to consider Lady Ursula — — "

74372	74409	74411	74411	she	166	" All my money difficulties are at an end at last , and if I am affected , it is that I feel I am not worthy of the happiness that is in store for me , "
74428	74437	74411	74411	she	166	" What have I done to deserve it ? "
74438	74443	74444	74444	I	0	" Well , really , "
74447	74477	74411	74411	she	166	" if you ask me that question honestly , I must wait till I know what ' it ' is ; perhaps you would have been better without—'it . ' "
74478	74680	74411	74411	she	166	" I assure you , Frank , one of the uppermost feelings in my mind is that of relief . I fully appreciate the warm - hearted generosity which has prompted you to take so much interest in my affairs ; but when it was all over between you and Ursula , my conscience would not allow me to let you make pecuniary sacrifices on so large a scale for my sake . When Broadhem told me that you had determined to persevere in your munificence , notwithstanding Ursula 's most inexplicable conduct , I made up my mind at once to adopt a course which , I am happy to say , not merely my sense of propriety but my feelings told me was the right one . I must therefore relieve you from all further anxiety about my business matters . You have , I think , still got some papers of mine , which you may return to me ; and I will see that my solicitor not only releases you from any engagements which you may have entered into for me , but will repay those sums which you have so kindly advanced on my account already . "
74694	74730	74731	74731	I	0	" Now we are quits . I do n't forget the time when you drank my ' pick - me - up ' first , and biologised me afterwards . And this is my revenge . "

74827	74894	74816	74816	I	0	" Of course , Lady Broadhem , any change in your circumstances which makes you independent , even of your friends , must be agreeable to you ; but I can not say how deeply disappointed I feel that my labour of love is over , and that I shall no longer have the pleasure of spending my resources in a cause so precious to me . "
74916	74921	74922	74922	she	166	" My dear Frank , "
74942	75025	75026	75026	She	166	" I shall never make you out ; I am so stupid at reading character , and I suppose so dull altogether , that sometimes I am not sure when you 're joking and when you are in earnest . Now I want you seriously to answer me truly one question , not as people of the world , you know , making pledges to each other , but as old friends , as we are , who may dispense with mystery . "
75038	75042	75043	75043	she	166	" Tell me , "
75049	75079	75047	75047	she	166	mine,—"tell me honestly , what could possibly have been your motive in being prepared to go on sacrificing your fortune for me when you had no chance of Ursula ? "
75080	75088	75089	75089	I	0	" Tell me honestly , Lady Broadhem , "
75099	75130	75043	75043	she	166	" how you are going to render yourself independent of my assistance hence - forward , and I will tell you the motives which have actuated me in proffering it . "
75131	75205	75206	75207	Lady Broadhem	166	" It is only just settled , and I have not even told it yet either to Broadhem or my daughters . I am quite prepared for the sensation it will make when it is known , and the ill - natured things people will say of me ; but my mind is made up , and we are told to expect persecution . I am going to be married to Mr Chundango ! "
75250	75256	75257	75258	her ladyship	2136	" I had no conception , "
75262	75374	75257	75258	her ladyship	2136	" of the sterling worth and noble character of that man until I had an opportunity of observing it closely . The munificence of his liberality , and the good uses to which he applies his enormous wealth , the cultivation of his mind , the excellence of his principles , and the perfect harmony of feeling upon religious subjects which exists between us , all convince me that I shall best consult my own happiness and the interests of my dear children by uniting my fate to his . I suppose you know Lord Scilly is going to put him into Parliament for the Scilly boroughs instead of Lord Grandon ? "
75375	75390	75391	75391	I	0	" No one could congratulate you more sincerely than I do , Lady Broadhem , "
75394	75564	75391	75391	I	0	" I can conceive no greater happiness than an alliance in which that perfect harmony of thought and feeling you describe reigns paramount ; and now it is my turn to tell you why I have acted the part which seems so incomprehensible to you . Grandon is , as you know , my dearest friend , but he is poor . Ursula cares for him more , if possible , than I do . And I need not tell you that my own attachment to your daughter is the strongest sentiment of my nature . Now , I determined to prove the depth of my affection for these two people by making them both happy , and when all my arrangements were completed I intended to make a final stipulation with you , that you should give your consent to their marriage , and that I should play the part of a bountiful prince in the Arabian Nights , and that we should all live happy ever after . "
75565	75573	75575	75576	Lady Broadhem	166	" A very pretty little plot indeed , "
75582	75618	75575	75576	Lady Broadhem	166	" You are too good and disinterested for this planet , Frank . So you thought you could coerce me into giving my consent to a marriage I never have approved , and never shall ? "
75619	75628	75629	75629	I	0	" Do n't be too sure of that , "
75676	75685	75686	75686	she	166	" Why not ? What do you mean ? "
75691	75723	75686	75686	she	166	" Who do you suppose is to dictate to me upon such a subject ? Ursula will be very well off , and I shall take care that she marries suitably . "
75724	75738	75739	75739	I	0	" I do n't know where she is to get her money from , "
75744	75775	75739	75739	I	0	" You need give yourself no anxiety about her for the future , I assure you . Mr Chundango has been most liberal in his arrangements about both my girls . "
75776	75795	75796	75796	I	0	" But , unfortunately , it is not in Mr Chundango 's power to make any such arrangements , "
75799	75861	75796	75796	I	0	" I am sure nothing will alter your feelings towards a man you really love , and that your own personal conduct will not be influenced by the fact that Mr Chundango is a beggar . You could go back to India with him , you know , and make a home for him in a bungalow in the Bombay Ghauts . "
75912	75915	75916	75916	I	0	" Yes , "
75919	76025	75916	75916	I	0	" there is no doubt about it . I got it from Bodwinkle this moment . The Bombay mail arrived last night , and you know the way everything has been crashing there through speculations in Back Bay shares , cotton , & c. Well , the great Parsee house of Burstupjee Cockabhoy has come down with a grand crash , and all our friend Chundango 's jewels in the back verandah , added to everything else he possesses in the world , will fail to meet his liabilities . Terrible thing , is n't it ? but we must bear up , you know . "

76311	76359	76306	76306	I	0	" which I can only talk of privately . I have left Lady Broadhem down - stairs , and it is the result of my interview with her that I want to communicate to you . Do you know that she contemplated taking a very serious step ? "
76404	76407	76409	76410	Lady Ursula	124	" No , "
76412	76460	76409	76410	Lady Ursula	124	" I have suspected by her preoccupied manner for many days past that mamma had decided upon something , but I have shrunk from speaking to her of her own plans . Indeed she seemed to have avoided me in a way which she never did before . "
76461	76500	76501	76501	I	0	" Before telling you what she intended doing , I must premise that she has quite abandoned the idea ; therefore do n't let yourself be distressed by what might have been , but wo n't be now . "

76623	76684	76685	76686	Lady Ursula	124	" The fact is , Lady Broadhem has been driven to despair by the family embarrassments , and we must make allowances for her under the circumstances . Then perhaps she was under the influence of pique . At all events , she has made up her mind to accept a proposal which Mr Chundango had the audacity to make . "

76921	76928	76916	76916	I	0	" And have you done so ? "
76975	76983	76984	76984	I	0	" I was just telling Lady Ursula , "
76987	76999	76984	76984	I	0	" that Mr Chundango had positively had the impudence to propose to you"—Lady
77006	77011	76984	76984	I	0	scream—"when you came in . "
77012	77023	77024	77024	she	166	" Then you did not tell her what he proposed ? "
77027	77036	77037	77037	I	0	" No , I leave that to you , "
77042	77105	77106	77106	Broadhem	166	" My dear Ursula , I would not tell you , because I know you do not approve of speculations , and I feel myself that they are questionable , if not actually sinful . My dear child , I did it for the best ; Chundango wanted me to join him in one of his Indian speculations , and proposed to me to"—Lady
77121	77253	77106	77106	Broadhem	166	slowly—"to unite my resources to his . Fortunately , Lord Frank has just discovered in time that he is a bankrupt , so of course all partnership arrangements between us are at an end , and I am most thankful for the lesson . You know I promised you once before that I would give up trying to retrieve my own fortunes by commercial speculation , even of the most legitimate description ; and now , my dear Frank , and you , my sweet child , forgive me for having even thought of yielding to this temptation . You must have seen how much it has weighed upon me , Ursula dear , for some time past ; but let us be thankful that I have been saved from it , "
77306	77375	77297	77297	she	124	" Never mind , mamma ; I know that whatever you do is out of love for us ; but indeed we do n't want to be rich . Broadhem has no expensive tastes , and I would only be too glad to get away from London . Let us let the house , and take a little cottage somewhere in the country,—we shall be so much happier ; "
77570	77583	77585	77585	Drippings	249	" Mr Chundango is in the drawing - room , my lady , "
77612	77633	77635	77635	he	249	" Here is some new start which I am not yet up to , but which I soon shall be , "
77648	77655	77657	77658	Lady Broadhem	166	" I shall be down immediately , "
77666	77684	77685	77685	I	0	" Perhaps , under the circumstances , you had better leave Mr Chundango to my tender mercies , "
77690	77704	77705	77705	I	0	" There can be no reason why you should ever see him again . "
77709	77711	77705	77705	I	0	" ever "
77752	77761	77745	77745	she	166	" I must keep it on the grindstone , "
77768	77777	77779	77779	I	0	" How do , my dear Mr Chundango ? "
77820	77847	77793	77793	he	1767	" I must congratulate you on the prospect of becoming a legislator . I hear Lord Scilly is going to put you in for his boroughs . "
77848	77851	77853	77853	Chundango	140	" Yes , "
77857	77910	77853	77853	Chundango	140	" His lordship has been good enough to press them upon me , but I have determined not to go in as any man 's nominee . The fact is , I wanted to ask Lady Broadhem 's advice upon that very matter , and have come here expressly to do so . "
77911	77930	77931	77931	I	0	" She is not very well , and has deputed me to consult with you instead . Come , "
77936	77952	77931	77931	I	0	" What is it all about ? I shall be too glad to assist you . "
77967	77985	77987	77987	he	140	" Has Lady Broadhem told him everything or not?—How much does he know?—What line shall I take ? "
77993	78000	78001	78001	I	0	" Come , out with it , "
78006	78033	78001	78001	I	0	" I have n't time to stand here all day waiting till you decide how much you will tell me and how much you wo n't . "
78095	78104	78105	78105	he	140	" I have no intention of deceiving you , "
78108	78128	78105	78105	he	140	" I do n't know whether Lady Broadhem has told you that we are to be united in matrimony ? "
78129	78132	78133	78133	I	0	" Yes , "
78136	78140	78133	78133	I	0	" she has . "
78141	78195	78105	78105	he	140	" Well , I want to make arrangements by which the ceremony may be accomplished without delay , for I feel the suspense is trying . Might I ask you to find out the earliest moment which would suit her convenience ? I need not say that I hope you will be present . "
78196	78217	78218	78218	I	0	" I suppose you would prefer it , if possible , before the arrival of the next mail from Bombay ? "
78246	78253	78254	78254	he	140	" I see that you know , "
78259	78290	78254	78254	he	140	" the terrible misfortune by which I have been overtaken , through no fault of my own . I am quite sure it will not affect Lady Broadhem 's resolution . "
78291	78299	78300	78300	I	0	" I am quite sure it will , "
78303	78339	78300	78300	I	0	" and the fact is , as she did not want a scene , she sent me down to give you to understand that everything is at an end between you . You look surprised , "
78372	78484	78485	78485	Chundango	140	" but I assure you this is the usual form among ladies in London . I am well aware no Hindoo woman would have done it ; but you must remember , Mr Chundango , that you are in a Christian and a civilised country , where money is essential to make the pot boil — not in a tropical heathen land where a pocket - handkerchief is sufficient for clothing , and a few plantains for sustenance . We do n't keep our hearts in a state of nature in this country a bit more than our bodies — it would not be considered proper ; you 'll soon get over it"—but
78493	78496	78497	78497	he	140	" Ah ! "
78508	78521	78497	78497	he	140	" everybody in London shall hear how I have got over it . "
78522	78616	78618	78618	I	0	" Nobody would believe you , and you would only be laughed at . Lady Broadhem would flatly deny it . We always do deny those little episodes . My good innocent Chundango , how much you have to learn , and how simple and guileless they are in your native country to what we are here ! No , no ! come with me ; I will do the best for everybody , and send you back to your mother dutiful and repentant — you had no business ever to desert her ; "
78623	78628	78629	78629	I	0	" Tell Lady Broadhem , "
78634	78654	78629	78629	I	0	" that I have gone with Mr Chundango into the City , and will call again to - morrow . "
78693	78700	78702	78702	Spiffy	159	" We must alter it slightly , "
78707	78717	78702	78702	Spiffy	159	" What ! have n't you issued it yet ? "
78721	78724	78725	78725	he	159	" No , "
78728	78741	78725	78725	he	159	" we were just going to send it out to - day . "
78742	78789	78790	78790	I	0	" Then I am in time to stop you . Your address , Spiffy , so outraged Stepton , that he has determined to stand himself , and neither you nor Bodwinkle have a chance ; so I would advise you to keep that document back , "
78803	78815	78816	78816	he	159	" A nice mess you have got me into between you , "
78825	78895	78816	78816	he	159	" Spiffy has , but my turn has yet to come . Bodwinkle , I think you know more of Mr Chundango 's affairs than any one else ; in fact , I suppose you have what the tradesmen call ' a little account ' between you . He wishes to say a few words confidentially to you , while I want to have a moment alone with Spiffy . "
78896	78903	78904	78904	I	0	" You know all about him ? "
78911	78918	78920	78920	Spiffy	159	" Collapsed , has n't he ? "
78922	78925	78926	78926	I	0	" Yes , "
78929	79094	79095	79095	I	0	" but it wo n't be known for a day or two . At present he is Lord Scilly 's nominee . Bodwinkle wants a borough . He may either ignore his last programme , as it is not yet issued , and adopt Scilly 's political views , or , if he is too conscientious , when Chundango retires at the last moment , he may snatch the seat . All that is your affair — you know Scilly and Bodwinkle both better than I do . Now I have reasons for wanting Chundango shipped back at once to Bombay , and for wishing to close this long - standing affair of Lady Broadhem 's with Bodwinkle . Make the best terms you can for Chundango , and see what Bodwinkle is disposed to do in the other matter ; and let me know the result to - morrow . Keep Chundango here now to refer to . Good - bye , Bodwinkle , "
79099	79118	79095	79095	I	0	" Spiffy has got some good news to give you , but be merciful to our friend here , "
79134	79140	79141	79141	I	0	" Now , look here , "
79148	79211	79141	79141	I	0	" if you will bury the recollection of what has passed between you and Lady Broadhem , and never breathe a word of it even in your dreams , I will get Bodwinkle to start you again in Bombay , but you must go back at once and stay there . Now you may stay here , for you will be wanted . "
79239	79243	79244	79244	I	0	" Dear me , "
79263	79296	79244	79244	I	0	" all this is unravelling itself very neatly , considering how much dirt is mixed up in it , but it is not quite far enough advanced to be communicated to Grandon . "
79390	79428	79452	79452	Grandon	110	" Well , old fellow , I think I have got a borough for you , after all . It stupidly did not occur to me before , but you are just the man for the constituency . "
79429	79450	79452	79452	Grandon	110	" I thought you had been to Lady Broadhem 's , and were to bring me back some good news , "
79459	79464	79465	79465	I	0	" So I have , "
79468	79550	79465	79465	I	0	" but I am bound to secrecy for another twenty - four hours ; meantime , listen ! I am going to retire from Dunderhead . I wrote my address a few days ago , but did not send it . They are therefore quite unprepared . I will retire to - morrow ; the nomination is to be in two or three days ; and what with the suddenness of the affair and my influence , your return is certain . "
79551	79557	79559	79559	Grandon	110	" You going to retire ! "
79563	79581	79559	79559	Grandon	110	" Why , you never told me of this . When did you make up your mind ? "
79582	79593	79594	79594	I	0	" It made itself up , as it always does , "
79599	79631	79594	79594	I	0	" It never puts me in the painful position of having to decide , but takes its own line at once . I am going to America by the next steamer . "
79812	79819	79820	79820	I	0	" Never mind , old fellow , "
79825	79857	79820	79820	I	0	" there is no use sighing over me . I have pleasures and satisfactions arising from within that I should not have if I was like everybody else . Now , for instance:"—and
79913	79919	79921	79921	Grandon	110	" Are you going alone ? "
79931	79934	79935	79935	I	0	" No , "
79957	79964	79965	79965	he	110	" Who is going with you ? "
80292	80299	80301	80301	Spiffy	159	" We accomplished great things yesterday , "
80320	80385	80387	80387	Spiffy	159	" When I showed Bodwinkle that we could make the Scilly boroughs a certainty , he behaved like a gentleman , and our friend Chundango is to go out to Bombay by the next mail , under more favourable conditions than he could have possibly expected . Of course I shall retire from contesting Shuffleborough to the more congenial atmosphere of Homburg . Heigho ! "
80389	80409	80387	80387	Spiffy	159	" I have gone through a good deal of wear and tear this season , and want to recruit . "
80455	80458	80459	80459	I	0	" Grandon , "
80467	80481	80459	80459	I	0	" I want you to come with me at once to Grosvenor Square . "
80482	80492	80493	80493	He	110	" Did Lady Broadhem tell you to ask me ? "
80554	80617	80540	80540	my	0	" My dear old fellow , the moment is come for you to prove your friendship by trusting me thoroughly . I know how rudely Lady Broadhem has always behaved to you whenever you have met — I know how my conduct has perplexed and grieved you . Well , now , I have come to ask you to forgive us both . "
80618	80657	80658	80658	he	1792	" I have nothing to forgive ; but it would be an utter want of taste in me to go there unless she expects me , and wishes to see me , and I can hardly hope that , "
80741	80750	80751	80751	I	0	" I will take the responsibility on myself , "
80754	80805	80751	80751	I	0	" and believe me , I would not urge it if I was not perfectly certain that I was doing what is right . Remember how many times I have blindly followed your advice . I only ask you this once to follow mine , and secure your own happiness . "
80934	80948	80950	80950	Drippings	249	" Lady Broadhem is in her own sitting - room , my lord , "
80952	80962	80950	80950	Drippings	249	" shall I show your lordship up to her ? "
80963	81004	81006	81006	I	0	" No ; if there is nobody in the drawing - room , take us there first . Now , Grandon , I will send for you when you are wanted ; keep quiet , and do n't get impatient ; "
81096	81151	81080	81080	her	166	" I acknowledge myself beaten ; be a brute or anything else you like ; trample upon me , pray — I am down without the possibility of retaliating , but you will get very little sport out of me ; badger me if you like , I do n't mean to show fight . "
81255	81268	81269	81269	she	166	" Your genius will never be appreciated by the world , Frank , "
81279	81287	81288	81288	I	0	" I am quite aware of that , "
81291	81342	81288	81288	I	0	" nor will this record of my experiences in it — except by you and one or two others who know how true it is . And now , Lady Broadhem , you know the wish which is nearest my heart , but which I do n't venture to put in words,"—and
81349	81352	81353	81353	she	166	" Yes , "
81380	81395	81353	81353	she	166	inflexible—"you want my consent to Ursula 's marriage with Grandon . I give it . "
81396	81410	81411	81411	I	0	" Wait a minute ; I should like Lady Ursula to be present , "
81469	81479	81480	81480	she	166	" I have sent for you , my dear , "
81483	81559	81480	81480	she	166	" to tell you how much we owe to our kind friend here , who has completely relieved my mind from all those anxieties which have been weighing upon it for the last few years , by his noble and generous conduct . Ursula , dear , you will never know really how much you owe him , for he has shown me that I have not done my duty to you as a mother ; "
81567	81572	81561	81562	Lady Broadhem	166	" Upon my word , "
81576	81586	81573	81573	I	0	" I do believe the old woman is sincere ; "
81920	81928	81929	81929	I	0	" Good - bye , Lady Broadhem , "
81932	81979	81929	81929	I	0	" you will not see me again . I am going to America in three days , and must go to Flityville to - morrow ; but I never thought I could have bid you all farewell and felt so happy at the prospect of parting ; "
81993	82005	82006	82006	I	0	" Your happiness is secured , I do most firmly believe , "
82011	82017	82006	82006	I	0	" and as for you , "
82028	82044	82019	82019	I	0	" remember the experiment I proposed to you the other night , and try it ; "
82330	82336	82338	82338	Grandon	110	" Good God ! Frank , "
82354	82361	82346	82347	Lady Broadhem	166	" what have you been doing ? "
82362	82374	82376	82376	I	0	" Beginning the work which is left for you to finish ; "
82392	82396	82397	82397	I	0	" On you , "
82403	82467	82397	82397	I	0	" has been bestowed a great gift ; use it as you have done , and may he share it with you , and support you in the lifelong trial it must involve , and in the ridicule to which you will both be exposed . For myself , I go to seek it where I am told I shall alone find it . "
82579	82586	82587	82587	he	249	" Stay here , my friend , "
82592	82615	82587	82587	he	249	" and pack your master 's things : there is no need for the doctor ; I will take him to America . "
