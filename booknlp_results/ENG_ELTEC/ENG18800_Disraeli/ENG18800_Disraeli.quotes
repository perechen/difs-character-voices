73	82	83	83	he	703	“ I have been looking for you everywhere , ”
86	91	83	83	he	703	“ What is it ? ”
92	101	193	193	These	324	“ We can hardly talk about it here . ”
102	110	83	83	he	703	“ Shall we go to White ’s ? ”
111	160	83	83	he	703	“ I have just left it , and , between ourselves , I would rather we should be more alone . ‘ Tis as warm as noon . Let us cross the street and get into St. James ’ Place . That is always my idea of solitude . ”
204	223	193	193	These	324	“ Capital account from Chiswick — Lord Howard says the chief will be in Downing Street on Monday . ”
224	238	247	247	his	713	“ It is of Chiswick that I am going to speak to you , ”
259	295	247	247	his	713	“ What I am about to tell you is known only to three persons , and is the most sacred of secrets . Nothing but our friendship could authorise me to impart it to you . ”
296	306	308	309	his companion	714	“ I hope it is something to your advantage , ”
311	430	247	247	his	713	“ Nothing of that sort ; it is of yourself that I am thinking . Since our political estrangement , I have never had a contented moment . From Christ Church , until that unhappy paralytic stroke , which broke up a government that had lasted fifteen years , and might have continued fifteen more , we seemed always to have been working together . That we should again unite is my dearest wish . A crisis is at hand . I want you to use it to your advantage . Know then , that what they were just saying about Chiswick is moonshine . His case is hopeless , and it has been communicated to the King . ”
431	434	247	247	his	713	“ Hopeless ! ”
435	450	247	247	his	713	“ Rely upon it ; it came direct from the Cottage to my friend . ”
451	459	461	462	his companion	714	“ I thought he had a mission ? ”
467	481	461	462	his companion	714	“ and men with missions do not disappear till they have fulfilled them . ”
482	535	247	247	his	713	“ But why did you think so ? How often have I asked you for your grounds for such a conviction ! There are none . The man of the age is clearly the Duke , the saviour of Europe , in the perfection of manhood , and with an iron constitution . ”
536	549	551	552	his companion	714	“ The salvation of Europe is the affair of a past generation , ”
554	575	551	552	his companion	714	“ We want something else now . The salvation of England should be the subject rather of our present thoughts . ”
576	608	247	247	his	713	“ England ! why when were things more sound ? Except the split among our own men , which will be now cured , there is not a cause of disquietude . ”
609	614	616	617	his friend	719	“ I have much , ”
619	650	616	617	his friend	719	“ You never used to have any , Sidney . What extraordinary revelations can have been made to you during three months of office under a semi - Whig Ministry ? ”
651	790	247	247	his	713	“ Your taunt is fair , though it pains me . And I confess to you that when I resolved to follow Canning and join his new allies , I had many a twinge . I was bred in the Tory camp ; the Tories put me in Parliament and gave me office ; I lived with them and liked them ; we dined and voted together , and together pasquinaded our opponents . And yet , after Castlereagh ’s death , to whom like yourself I was much attached , I had great misgivings as to the position of our party , and the future of the country . I tried to drive them from my mind , and at last took refuge in Canning , who seemed just the man appointed for an age of transition . ”
791	798	247	247	his	713	“ But a transition to what ? ”
799	808	247	247	his	713	“ Well , his foreign policy was Liberal . ”
809	900	247	247	his	713	“ The same as the Duke ’s ; the same as poor dear Castlereagh ’s . Nothing more unjust than the affected belief that there was any difference between them — a ruse of the Whigs to foster discord in our ranks . And as for domestic affairs , no one is stouter against Parliamentary Reform , while he is for the Church and no surrender , though he may make a harmless speech now and then , as many of us do , in favour of the Catholic claims . ”
901	936	247	247	his	713	“ Well , we will not now pursue this old controversy , my dear Ferrars , particularly if it be true , as you say , that Mr. Canning now lies upon his deathbed . ”
937	953	247	247	his	713	“ If ! I tell you at this very moment it may be all over . ”
954	963	247	247	his	713	“ I am shaken to my very centre . ”
964	974	247	247	his	713	“ It is doubtless a great blow to you , ”
979	1052	976	977	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ and I wish to alleviate it . That is why I was looking for you . The King will , of course , send for the Duke , but I can tell you there will be a disposition to draw back our friends that left us , at least the younger ones of promise . If you are awake , there is no reason why you should not retain your office . ”
1053	1067	247	247	his	713	“ I am not so sure the King will send for the Duke . ”
1068	1073	247	247	his	713	“ It is certain . ”
1074	1077	1079	1080	his companion	714	“ Well , ”
1083	1128	1079	1080	his companion	714	“ it may be fancy , but I can not resist the feeling that this country , and the world generally , are on the eve of a great change — and I do not think the Duke is the man for the epoch . ”
1129	1148	1150	1151	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ I see no reason why there should be any great change ; certainly not in this country , ”
1153	1208	1150	1151	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Here we have changed everything that was required . Peel has settled the criminal law , and Huskisson the currency , and though I am prepared myself still further to reduce the duties on foreign imports , no one can deny that on this subject the Government is in advance of public opinion . ”
1209	1220	1222	1223	his companion	714	“ The whole affair rests on too contracted a basis , ”
1225	1269	1222	1223	his companion	714	“ We are habituated to its exclusiveness , and , no doubt , custom in England is a power ; but let some event suddenly occur which makes a nation feel or think , and the whole thing might vanish like a dream . ”
1270	1326	1150	1151	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ What can happen ? Such affairs as the Luddites do not occur twice in a century , and as for Spafields riots , they are impossible now with Peel ’s new police . The country is employed and prosperous , and were it not so , the landed interest would always keep things straight . ”
1327	1352	1222	1223	his companion	714	“ It is powerful , and has been powerful for a long time ; but there are other interests besides the landed interest now . ”
1353	1367	1369	1370	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Well , there is the colonial interest , and the shipping interest , ”
1372	1381	1369	1370	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ and both of them thoroughly with us . ”
1382	1390	1392	1393	his companion	714	“ I was not thinking of them , ”
1395	1430	1369	1370	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ It is the increase of population , and of a population not employed in the cultivation of the soil , and all the consequences of such circumstances that were passing over my mind . ”
1431	1490	1222	1223	his companion	714	“ Do n’t you be too doctrinaire , my dear Sidney ; you and I are practical men . We must deal with the existing , the urgent ; and there is nothing more pressing at this moment than the formation of a new government . What I want is to see you as a member of it . ”
1491	1494	1496	1497	his companion	714	“ Ah ! ”
1502	1513	1222	1223	his companion	714	“ do you really think it so near as that ? ”
1514	1564	1222	1223	his companion	714	“ Why , what have we been talking of all this time , my dear Sidney ? Clear your head of all doubt , and , if possible , of all regrets ; we must deal with the facts , and we must deal with them to - morrow . ”
1565	1574	1576	1576	Sidney	326	“ I still think he had a mission , ”
1581	1593	1576	1576	Sidney	326	“ if it were only to bring hope to a people . ”
1594	1608	1610	1611	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Well , I do not see he could have done anything more , ”
1613	1666	1610	1611	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ nor do I believe his government would have lasted during the session . However , I must now say good - night , for I must look in at the Square . Think well of what I have said , and let me hear from you as soon as you can . ”
1935	1943	1945	1945	Zenobia	335	“ What I want you to see , ”
1947	2223	1945	1945	Zenobia	335	“ is that reaction is the law of life , and that we are on the eve of a great reaction . Since Lord Castlereagh ’s death we have had five years of revolution — nothing but change , and every change has been disastrous . Abroad we are in league with all the conspirators of the Continent , and if there were a general war we should not have an ally ; at home our trade , I am told , is quite ruined , and we are deluged with foreign articles ; while , thanks to Mr. Huskisson , the country banks , which enabled Mr. Pitt to carry on the war and saved England , are all broken . There was one thing , of which I thought we should always be proud , and that was our laws and their administration ; but now our most sacred enactments are questioned , and people are told to call out for the reform of our courts of judicature , which used to be the glory of the land . This can not last . I see , indeed , many signs of national disgust ; people would have borne a great deal from poor Lord Liverpool — for they knew he was a good man , though I always thought a weak one ; but when it was found that his boasted Liberalism only meant letting the Whigs into office — who , if they had always been in office , would have made us the slaves of Bonaparte — their eyes were opened . Depend upon it , the reaction has commenced . ”
2224	2233	2235	2236	the ambassador	742	“ We shall have some trouble with France , ”
2238	2246	2235	2236	the ambassador	742	“ unless there is a change here . ”
2247	2257	2259	2261	the great personage	743	“ The Church is weary of the present men , ”
2263	2273	2259	2261	the great personage	743	“ No one really knows what they are after . ”
2274	2286	2288	2288	Zenobia	335	“ And how can the country be governed without the Church ? ”
2290	2320	2288	2288	Zenobia	335	“ If the country once thinks the Church is in danger , the affair will soon be finished . The King ought to be told what is going on . ”
2321	2327	2329	2330	the ambassador	742	“ Nothing is going on , ”
2332	2340	2329	2330	the ambassador	742	“ but everybody is afraid of something . ”
2341	2359	2361	2363	the great personage	743	“ The King ’s friends should impress upon him never to lose sight of the landed interest , ”
2365	2382	2384	2384	Zenobia	335	“ How can any government go on without the support of the Church and the land ? ”
2386	2392	2384	2384	Zenobia	335	“ It is quite unnatural . ”
2393	2399	2401	2402	the ambassador	742	“ That is the mystery , ”
2404	2425	2401	2402	the ambassador	742	“ Here is a government , supported by none of the influences hitherto deemed indispensable , and yet it exists . ”
2426	2432	2434	2436	the great personage	743	“ The newspapers support it , ”
2438	2512	2434	2436	the great personage	743	“ and the Dissenters , who are trying to bring themselves into notice , and who are said to have some influence in the northern counties , and the Whigs , who are in a hole , are willing to seize the hand of the ministry to help them out of it ; and then there is always a number of people who will support any government — and so the thing works . ”
2513	2525	2527	2528	the ambassador	742	“ They have got a new name for this hybrid sentiment , ”
2530	2537	2527	2528	the ambassador	742	“ They call it public opinion . ”
2538	2543	2545	2545	Zenobia	335	“ How very absurd ! ”
2547	2571	2545	2545	Zenobia	335	“ a mere nickname . As if there could be any opinion but that of the Sovereign and the two Houses of Parliament . ”
2572	2583	2585	2587	the great personage	743	“ They are trying to introduce here the continental Liberalism , ”
2589	2634	2585	2587	the great personage	743	“ Now we know what Liberalism means on the continent . It means the abolition of property and religion . Those ideas would not suit this country ; and I often puzzle myself to foresee how they will attempt to apply Liberal opinions here . ”
2635	2641	2643	2643	Zenobia	335	“ I shall always think , ”
2645	2670	2643	2643	Zenobia	335	“ that Lord Liverpool went much too far , though I never said so in his time ; for I always uphold my friends . ”
2671	2688	2690	2692	the great personage	743	“ Well , we shall see what Canning will do about the Test and Corporation Acts , ”
2694	2703	2690	2692	the great personage	743	“ I understand they mean to push him . ”
2704	2714	2716	2717	the ambassador	742	“ By the by , how is he really ? ”
2719	2727	2716	2717	the ambassador	742	“ What are the accounts this afternoon ? ”
2728	2738	2740	2740	Zenobia	335	“ Here is a gentleman who will tell us , ”
2750	2759	2760	2760	she	335	“ And what is your news from Chiswick ? ”
2763	2780	2760	2760	she	335	“ They say at Brookes ’ , that he will be at Downing Street on Monday . ”
2781	2786	2788	2788	Zenobia	335	“ I doubt it , ”
2953	2963	2965	2965	Zenobia	335	“ Mind ; I see you to - morrow , ”
2974	2983	2965	2965	Zenobia	335	“ I shall have something to tell you . ”
3906	3910	3955	3956	the minister	775	“ Quarterly Review , ”
3987	3991	3978	3978	He	425	“ very rising , ”
5125	5132	5133	5133	he	425	“ I do so at once , ”
5136	5173	5133	5133	he	425	“ because I shall not have the opportunity this evening . I was calling here in the hope of seeing Mrs. Ferrars , and asking her to excuse me from being your guest to - day . ”
5174	5182	5184	5184	Ferrars	330	“ Well , it is rather awkward , ”
5186	5207	5184	5184	Ferrars	330	“ but I could have no idea of this when you were so kind as to say you would come . ”
5208	5216	5218	5218	Sidney	326	“ Oh , nothing of that sort , ”
5220	5301	5218	5218	Sidney	326	“ I am out and you are in , and I hope you may be in for a long , long time . I dare say it may be so , and the Duke is the man of the age , as you always said he was . I hope your being in office is not to deprive me of your pleasant dinners ; it would be too bad to lose my place both at Whitehall and in Hill Street . ”
5302	5325	5369	5369	Ferrars	330	“ I trust that will never happen , my dear fellow ; but to - day I thought it might be embarrassing . ”
5326	5368	5218	5218	Sidney	326	“ Not at all ; I could endure without wincing even the triumphant glances of Zenobia . The fact is , I have some business of the most pressing nature which has suddenly arisen , and which demands my immediate attention . ”
5741	5747	5729	5729	She	330	“ I never can understand , ”
5759	5871	5729	5729	She	330	“ how affairs are carried on in this world . Now we have , my dear , fifty thousand per annum ; and I do not see how Ferrars can have much more than five ; and yet he lives much as we do , perhaps better . I know Gibson showed me a horse last week that I very much wanted , but I would not give him two hundred guineas for it . I called there to - day to look after it again , for it would have suited me exactly , but I was told I was too late , and it was sold to Mrs. Ferrars . ”
5872	5885	5886	5886	Zenobia	335	“ My dear , you know I do not understand money matters , ”
5891	5934	5886	5886	Zenobia	335	“ I never could ; but you should remember that old Ferrars must be very rich , and that William Ferrars is the most rising man of the day , and is sure to be in the Cabinet before he is forty . ”
6280	6289	6291	6292	his lordship	923	“ And when do you go to school ? ”
6303	6313	6315	6316	the child	924	“ I shall go to Eton in two years , ”
6341	6359	6315	6316	the child	924	“ and then I shall go to Christ Church , and then I shall go into Parliament . ”
6360	6363	6365	6369	an intimate of the family	925	“ Myra , ”
6396	6416	6387	6387	he	922	“ I hope you have not forgotten your engagement to me which you made at Wimbledon two years ago ? ”
6417	6421	6422	6422	she	928	“ What engagement ? ”
6426	6431	6422	6422	she	928	“ To marry me . ”
6432	6450	6451	6451	she	928	“ I should not think of marrying any one who was not in the House of Lords , ”
6483	6502	6475	6477	one of them	932	“ Your son ’s name is very pretty , but it is very uncommon , is it not ? ”
6503	6561	6475	6477	one of them	932	“ ‘ Tis a family name . The first Carey who bore it was a courtier of Charles the First , and we have never since been without it . William wanted our boy to be christened Pomeroy but I was always resolved , if I ever had a son , that he should be named ENDYMION . ”
6874	6877	6878	6878	she	947	“ Ah ! ”
6894	6900	6881	6881	she	947	“ you are ever faithful . ”
6907	6934	6904	6904	she	947	“ You have not seen my boy since he sate upon your knee . Florestan , salute Mr. Wilton , your mother ’s most cherished friend . ”
6935	6942	6944	6945	Mr. Wilton	326	“ This is a sudden arrival , ”
6947	6957	6959	6960	the lady	947	“ Well , they would not let us rest , ”
6962	7041	6959	6960	the lady	947	“ Our only refuge was Switzerland , but I can not breathe among the mountains , and so , after a while , we stole to an obscure corner of the south , and for a time we were tranquil . But soon the old story : representations , remonstrances , warnings , and threats , appeals to Vienna , and lectures from Prince Metternich , not the less impressive because they were courteous , and even gallant . ”
7042	7061	6904	6904	she	947	“ And had nothing occurred to give a colour to such complaints ? Or was it sheer persecution ? ”
7062	7068	7070	7071	the lady	947	“ Well , you know , ”
7073	7274	7070	7071	the lady	947	“ we wished to remain quiet and obscure ; but where the lad is , they will find him out . It often astonishes me . I believe if we were in the centre of a forest in some Indian isle , with no companions but monkeys and elephants , a secret agent would appear — some devoted victim of our family , prepared to restore our fortunes and renovate his own . I speak the truth to you always . I have never countenanced these people ; I have never encouraged them ; but it is impossible rudely to reject the sympathy of those who , after all , are your fellow - sufferers , and some of who have given proof of even disinterested devotion . For my own part , I have never faltered in my faith , that Florestan would some day sit on the throne of his father , dark as appears to be our life ; but I have never much believed that the great result could be occasioned or precipitated by intrigues , but rather by events more powerful than man , and led on by that fatality in which his father believed . ”
7275	7284	7286	7287	Mr. Wilton	326	“ And now you think of remaining here ? ”
7289	7292	7294	7295	the lady	947	“ No , ”
7297	7470	7294	7295	the lady	947	“ that I can not do . I love everything in this country except its climate and , perhaps , its hotels . I think of trying the south of Spain , and fancy , if quite alone , I might vegetate there unnoticed . I can not bring myself altogether to quit Europe . I am , my dear Sidney , intensely European . But Spain is not exactly the country I should fix upon to form kings and statesmen . And this is the point on which I wish to consult you . I want Florestan to receive an English education , and I want you to put me in the way of accomplishing this . It might be convenient , under such circumstances , that he should not obtrude his birth — perhaps , that it should be concealed . He has many honourable names besides the one which indicates the state to which he was born . But , on all these points , we want your advice . ”
7525	7534	7536	7537	the lady	947	“ This change of government in your country , ”
7539	7595	7536	7537	the lady	947	“ so unexpected , so utterly unforeseen , disturbs me ; in fact , it decided my hesitating movements . I can not but believe that the accession of the Duke of Wellington to power must be bad , at least , for us . It is essentially reactionary . They are triumphing at Vienna . ”
7596	7601	7603	7604	Mr. Wilton	326	“ Have they cause ? ”
7606	7647	7603	7604	Mr. Wilton	326	“ I am an impartial witness , for I have no post in the new administration ; but the leading colleagues of Mr. Canning form part of it , and the conduct of foreign affairs remains in the same hands . ”
7648	7653	7655	7656	the lady	947	“ That is consoling , ”
7658	7687	7689	7690	the lady	947	“ I wonder if Lord Dudley would see me . Perhaps not . Ministers do not love pretenders . I knew him when I was not a pretender , ”
7698	7742	7744	7744	she	947	“ and thought him agreeable . He was witty . Ah ! Sidney , those were happy days . I look back to the past with regret , but without remorse . One might have done more good , but one did some ; ”
7747	7753	7755	7755	Sidney	326	“ You seemed to me , ”
7759	7770	7755	7755	Sidney	326	“ to diffuse benefit and blessings among all around you . ”
7771	7776	7778	7779	the lady	947	“ And I read , ”
7785	7855	7857	7858	the lady	947	“ in some memoirs the other day , that our court was a corrupt and dissolute court . It was a court of pleasure , if you like ; but of pleasure that animated and refined , and put the world in good humour , which , after all , is good government . The most corrupt and dissolute courts on the continent of Europe that I have known , ”
7860	7870	7857	7858	the lady	947	“ have been outwardly the dullest and most decorous . ”
7871	7878	7880	7881	Mr. Wilton	326	“ My memory of those days , ”
7883	7892	7880	7881	Mr. Wilton	326	“ is of ceaseless grace and inexhaustible charm . ”
7893	7896	7898	7899	the lady	947	“ Well , ”
7901	7973	7898	7899	the lady	947	“ if I sinned I have at least suffered . And I hope they were only sins of omission . I wanted to see everybody happy , and tried to make them so . But let us talk no more of ourselves . The unfortunate are always egotistical . Tell me something of Mr. Wilton ; and , above all , tell me why you are not in the new government . ”
7974	7981	7983	7984	Mr. Wilton	326	“ I have not been invited , ”
7986	8064	8065	8065	he	326	“ There are more claimants than can be satisfied , and my claims are not very strong . It is scarcely a disappointment to me . I shall continue in public life ; but , so far as political responsibility is concerned , I would rather wait . I have some fancies on that head , but I will not trouble you with them . My time , therefore , is at my command ; and so , ”
8069	8080	8065	8065	he	326	“ I can attend to the education of Prince Florestan . ”
8081	8089	8091	8092	the lady	947	“ Do you hear that , Florestan ? ”
8097	8110	8091	8092	the lady	947	“ I told you we had a friend . Thank Mr. Wilton . ”
8133	8145	8151	8151	he	326	“ I see you have not forgotten your most delightful pursuit , ”
8158	8161	8163	8164	the lady	947	“ No , ”
8166	8183	8163	8164	the lady	947	“ throned or discrowned , music has ever been the charm or consolation of my life . ”
8184	8190	8192	8193	Mr. Wilton	326	“ Pleasure should follow business , ”
8195	8222	8192	8193	Mr. Wilton	326	“ and we have transacted ours . Would it be too bold if I asked again to hear those tones which have so often enchanted me ? ”
8223	8231	8233	8234	the lady	947	“ My voice has not fallen off , ”
8236	8281	8282	8282	she	947	“ for you know it was never first - rate . But they were kind enough to say it had some expression , probably because I generally sang my own words to my own music . I will sing you my farewell to Florestan , ”
8350	8374	8338	8339	The mother	970	“ The darling can not bear to hear it , but I sing it on purpose , to prepare him for the inevitable . ”
8375	8382	8384	8385	Mr. Wilton	326	“ He is soft - hearted , ”
8387	8396	8398	8399	the mother	970	“ He is the most affectionate of beings , ”
8401	8495	8398	8399	the mother	970	“ Affectionate and mysterious . I can say no more . I ought to tell you his character . I can not . You may say he may have none . I do not know . He has abilities , for he acquires knowledge with facility , and knows a great deal for a boy . But he never gives an opinion . He is silent and solitary . Poor darling ! he has rarely had companions , and that may be the cause . He seems to me always to be thinking . ”
8496	8509	8511	8512	Mr. Wilton	326	“ Well , a public school will rouse him from his reveries , ”
8514	8538	8540	8541	the lady	947	“ As he is away at this moment , I will say that which I should not care to say before his face , ”
8543	8821	8823	8823	she	973	“ You are about to do me a great service , not the first ; and before I leave this , we may — we must — meet again more than once , but there is no time like the present . The separation between Florestan and myself may be final . It is sad to think of such things , but they must be thought of , for they are probable . I still look in a mirror , Sidney ; I am not so frightened by what has occurred since we first met , to be afraid of that — but I never deceive myself . I do not know what may be the magical effect of the raisins of Malaga , but if it saves my life the grape cure will indeed achieve a miracle . Do not look gloomy . Those who have known real grief seldom seem sad . I have been struggling with sorrow for ten years , but I have got through it with music and singing , and my boy . See now — he will be a source of expense , and it will not do for you to be looking to a woman for supplies . Women are generous , but not precise in money matters . I have some excuse , for the world has treated me not very well . I never got my pension regularly ; now I never get it at all . So much for the treaties , but everybody laughs at them . Here is the fortune of Florestan , and I wish it all to be spent on his education , ”
8831	8900	8823	8823	she	973	“ They are not the crown jewels , though . The memoirs I was reading the other day say I ran away with them . That is false , like most things said of me . But these are gems of Golconda , which I wish you to realise and expend for his service . They were the gift of love , and they were worn in love . ”
8901	8906	8908	8909	Mr. Wilton	326	“ It is unnecessary , ”
8918	8921	8923	8924	the lady	947	“ Hush ! ”
8926	8941	8923	8924	the lady	947	“ I am still a sovereign to you , and I must be obeyed . ”
8979	8990	8975	8976	the lady	947	“ I must give you this copy of my song . ”
8991	9001	8975	8976	the lady	947	“ And you will write my name on it ? ”
9002	9005	9007	9008	the lady	947	“ Certainly , ”
9019	9028	9011	9011	she	947	“ For Mr. Sidney Wilton , from AGRIPPINA . ”
9897	9906	9914	9914	he	1029	“ I have some good news for you , ”
9919	9937	9914	9914	he	1029	“ We have prevented this morning the lighting of Grosvenor Square by gas by a large majority . ”
9938	9948	9950	9950	Zenobia	335	“ I felt confident that disgrace would never occur , ”
9954	9968	9950	9950	Zenobia	335	“ And by a large majority ! I wonder how Lord Pomeroy voted . ”
9969	9973	9914	9914	he	1029	“ Against us . ”
9974	9982	9984	9984	Zenobia	335	“ How can one save this country ? ”
9986	10010	9984	9984	Zenobia	335	“ I believe now the story that he has ordered Lady Pomeroy not to go to the Drawing Room in a sedan chair . ”
10521	10548	10517	10517	Zenobia	335	“ Thank heaven , we are at last alone ! You must have been surprised I was so late . Well , guess what has happened ? ”
10561	10568	10558	10558	she	330	“ They are all four out ! ”
10569	10573	10558	10558	she	330	“ All four ! ”
10574	10632	10558	10558	she	330	“ Yes ; Lord Dudley , Lord Palmerston , and Charles Grant follow Huskisson . I do not believe the first ever meant to go , but the Duke would not listen to his hypocritical explanations , and the rest have followed . I am surprised about Lord Dudley , as I know he loved his office . ”
10633	10638	10640	10641	Mrs. Ferrars	330	“ I am alarmed , ”
10643	10651	10653	10655	the intrepid Zenobia	335	“ Not the slightest cause for fear , ”
10657	10734	10653	10655	the intrepid Zenobia	335	“ It must have happened sooner or later . I am delighted at it . We shall now have a cabinet of our own . They never would have rested till they had brought in some Whigs , and the country hates the Whigs . No wonder , when we remember that if they had had their way we should have been wearing sabots at this time , with a French prefect probably in Holland House . ”
10735	10745	10747	10748	Mrs. Ferrars	330	“ And whom will they put in the cabinet ? ”
10750	10758	10760	10760	Zenobia	335	“ Our good friends , I hope , ”
10767	10856	10760	10760	Zenobia	335	“ but I have heard nothing about that yet . I am a little sorry about Lord Dudley , as I think they have drawn him into their mesh ; but as for the other three , especially Huskisson and Lord Palmerston , I can tell you the Duke has never had a quiet moment since they joined him . We shall now begin to reign . The only mistake was ever to have admitted them . I think now we have got rid of Liberalism for ever . ”
11188	11204	11178	11178	she	335	“ Every landowner in the county is in his favour ; therefore it is impossible . ”
12390	12396	12417	12417	Polignac	374	“ the three glorious days , ”
12609	12620	12621	12624	The gentleman thus addressed	1169	“ Our Whig friends seem in high spirits , baron . ”
12760	12773	12775	12776	the baron	1176	“ As we have got our coffee , let us sit down , ”
12788	12803	12805	12806	the baron	1176	“ You know I am a Liberal , and have always been a Liberal , ”
12808	13191	12805	12806	the baron	1176	“ I know the value of civil and religious liberty , for I was born in a country where we had neither , and where we have since enjoyed either very fitfully . Nothing can be much drearier than the present lot of my country , and it is probable that these doings at Paris may help my friends a little , and they may again hold up their heads for a time ; but I have seen too much , and am too old , to indulge in dreams . You are a young man and will live to see what I can only predict . The world is thinking of something else than civil and religious liberty . Those are phrases of the eighteenth century . The men who have won these ‘ three glorious days ’ at Paris , want neither civilisation nor religion . They will not be content till they have destroyed both . It is possible that they may be parried for a time ; that the adroit wisdom of the house of Orleans , guided by Talleyrand , may give this movement the resemblance , and even the character , of a middle - class revolution . It is no such thing ; the barricades were not erected by the middle class . I know these people ; it is a fraternity , not a nation . Europe is honeycombed with their secret societies . They are spread all over Spain . Italy is entirely mined . I know more of the southern than the northern nations ; but I have been assured by one who should know that the brotherhood are organised throughout Germany and even in Russia . I have spoken to the Duke about these things . He is not indifferent , or altogether incredulous , but he is so essentially practical that he can only deal with what he sees . I have spoken to the Whig leaders . They tell me that there is only one specific , and that a complete one — constitutional government ; that with representative institutions , secret societies can not co - exist . I may be wrong , but it seems to me that with these secret societies representative institutions rather will disappear . ”
13659	13663	13665	13665	Zenobia	335	“ Never mind , ”
13667	13680	13665	13665	Zenobia	335	“ what does it signify ? The Lords will throw it out . ”
13845	13855	13857	13858	a member	979	“ I never thought it was in William Ferrars , ”
13872	13905	13857	13858	a member	979	“ I always thought him a good man of business , and all that sort of thing — but , somehow or other , I did not think this was in him . ”
13906	13926	13928	13929	his friend	719	“ Well , he has a good deal at stake , and that brings it out of a fellow , ”
14080	14089	14090	14090	she	1226	“ But it will not come to that , ”
14093	14101	14090	14090	she	1226	“ The Lords will do their duty . ”
14102	14109	14111	14111	Ferrars	340	“ But Lord Waverley tells me , ”
14113	14135	14111	14111	Ferrars	340	“ that there are forty of them who were against the bill last year who will vote for the second reading . ”
14136	14145	14147	14147	Zenobia	335	“ Never mind Lord Waverley and such addlebrains , ”
14156	14204	14205	14205	she	335	“ So long as we have the court , the Duke , and Lord Lyndhurst on our side , we can afford to laugh at such conceited poltroons . His mother was my dearest friend , and I know he used to have fits . Look bright , ”
14208	14225	14205	14205	she	335	“ things never were better . Before a week has passed these people will be nowhere . ”
14226	14233	14269	14269	Zenobia	335	“ But how it is possible ? ”
14234	14238	14269	14269	Zenobia	335	“ Trust me . ”
14239	14246	14205	14205	she	335	“ I always do — and yet ”
14249	14259	14260	14260	she	335	“ You never were nearer being a cabinet minister , ”
14376	14381	14383	14383	he	6633	“ in great distress , ”
14397	14402	14404	14404	Zenobia	335	“ Who was right ? ”
14409	14446	14404	14404	Zenobia	335	“ He is so busy he could not write to you , but he told me to tell you to call at Apsley House at twelve to - morrow . You will be in the cabinet . ”
14447	14455	14459	14459	himself	425	“ I have got it at last ! ”
14461	14519	14457	14457	Ferrars	425	“ It is worth living for and at any peril . All the cares of life sink into insignificance under such circumstances . The difficulties are great , but their very greatness will furnish the means of their solution . The Crown can not be dragged in the mud , and the Duke was born for conquest . ”
14573	14581	14582	14582	she	335	“ but there is nothing in it , ”
14585	14617	14582	14582	she	335	“ The Duke has provided for everything , and he means Sir Robert to be Premier . He could not refuse that ; it would be almost an act of treason . ”
14647	14653	14654	14654	she	335	“ Do n’t be alarmed , ”
14657	14800	14654	14654	she	335	“ nothing will prevent a government being formed , but Sir Robert has thrown us over ; I never had confidence in him . It is most provoking , as Mr. Baring had joined us , and it was such a good name for the City . But the failure of one man is the opportunity of another . We want a leader in the House of Commons . He must be a man who can speak ; of experience , who knows the House , its forms , and all that . There is only one man indicated . You can not doubt about him . I told you honours would be tumbling on your head . You are the man ; you are to have one of the highest offices in the cabinet , and lead the House of Commons . ”
14801	14805	14807	14807	Ferrars	425	“ Peel declines , ”
14816	14822	14807	14807	Ferrars	425	“ That is very serious . ”
14823	14827	14829	14829	Zenobia	335	“ For himself , ”
14831	14841	14829	14829	Zenobia	335	“ not for you . It makes your fortune . ”
14842	14852	14654	14654	she	335	“ The difficulties seem too great to contend with . ”
14853	14929	14807	14807	Ferrars	425	“ What difficulties are there ? You have got the court , and you have got the House of Lords . Mr. Pitt was not nearly so well off , for he had never been in office , and had at the same time to fight Lord North and that wicked Mr. Fox , the orator of the day , while you have only got Lord Althorp , who ca n’t order his own dinner . ”
14930	14936	14938	14938	Ferrars	425	“ I am in amazement , ”
14947	14954	14941	14941	he	425	“ But you do not hesitate ? ”
14955	14958	14959	14959	he	425	“ No , ”
14983	14989	14995	14995	he	425	“ I do not hesitate . ”
14998	15016	14995	14995	he	425	“ This is not an age for hesitation ; if asked , I will do the deed . ”
15075	15105	15068	15068	Zenobia	335	“ Do not lose a moment . I am so glad to have got rid of Sir Robert with his doubts and his difficulties . We want new blood . ”
15943	15958	15923	15923	she	330	“ O William ! if we love each other , what does anything signify ? ”
16027	16031	16032	16032	he	986	“ My darling , ”
16035	16080	16032	16032	he	986	“ ours is not a case of common imprudence or misfortune . We are the victims of a revolution , and we must bear our lot as becomes us under such circumstances . Individual misfortunes are merged in the greater catastrophe of the country . ”
16081	16088	16090	16091	his wife	1261	“ That is the true view , ”
16093	16173	16090	16091	his wife	1261	“ and , after all , the poor King of France is much worse off than we are . However , I can not now buy the Duchesse of Sevres ’ lace , which I had promised her to do . It is rather awkward . However , the best way always is to speak the truth . I must tell the duchess I am powerless , and that we are the victims of a revolution , like herself . ”
16210	16213	16214	16214	she	330	“ No , ”
16224	16389	16214	16214	she	330	“ you always used to say I brought you luck , and I will bring you luck yet . There must be a reaction . The wheel will turn and bring round our friends again . Do not let us then be out of the way . Your claims are immense . They must do something for you . They ought to give you India , and if we only set our mind upon it , we shall get it . Depend upon it , things are not so bad as they seem . What appear to be calamities are often the sources of fortune . I would much sooner that you should be Governor - General than a cabinet minister . That odious House of Commons is very wearisome . I am not sure any constitution can bear it very long . I am not sure whether I would not prefer being Governor - General of India even to being Prime - Minister . ”
16629	16656	16606	16606	she	330	“ Charming ! but rather more , I fancy , than we require , for we mean to be very quiet till my girl is presented . ”
16881	16904	16878	16878	she	1294	“ Something has happened . What it is I can not make out , but we are to have no more ponies . ”
17819	17832	17802	17802	She	466	“ We will go over the house and see our rooms together . ”
18072	18083	18085	18085	Myra	466	“ What do you think of it all , Endymion ? ”
18090	18096	18097	18097	he	425	“ I rather like it , ”
18121	18133	18115	18115	she	466	“ I feel as if we had fallen from some star . ”
18372	18381	18383	18384	Mrs. Ferrars	330	“ I have not much to work with , ”
18390	18399	18383	18384	Mrs. Ferrars	330	“ but I think the colouring is pretty . ”
19496	19500	19501	19501	Mr.	1442	“ adscripti glebae . ”
19539	19543	19501	19501	Mr.	1442	“ Evening Mail , ”
19554	19556	19501	19501	Mr.	1442	“ Times ”
19568	19570	19501	19501	Mr.	1442	“ Times ”
19804	19815	19798	19798	she	335	“ How can one recollect people whom one never meets ? ”
20105	20110	20112	20112	Myra	466	“ I think not , ”
20114	20126	20112	20112	Myra	466	“ and yet how merry to scamper together over this chase ! ”
20127	20136	20138	20138	Endymion	425	“ But they would not let us go , ”
20140	20145	20138	20138	Endymion	425	“ without a groom . ”
20146	20150	20152	20152	Myra	466	“ A groom ! ”
20159	20185	20152	20152	Myra	466	“ I believe , if the truth were really known , we ought to be making our own beds and washing our own dinner plates . ”
20186	20200	20202	20202	Endymion	425	“ And are you sorry , Myra , for all that has happened ? ”
20204	20236	20202	20202	Endymion	425	“ I hardly know what has happened . They keep it very close . But I am too astonished to be sorry . Besides , what is the use of whimpering ? ”
20237	20245	20247	20247	Endymion	425	“ I cried very much one day , ”
20249	20271	20247	20247	Endymion	425	“ Ah , you are soft , dear darling . I never cried in my life , except once with rage . ”
20661	20670	20672	20673	the farmer	1490	“ I gave him the best of educations , ”
20675	20818	20672	20673	the farmer	1490	“ he had a much better chance than I had myself , for I do not pretend to be a scholar , and never was ; and yet I can not make head or tail of him . I wish you would speak to him some day , sir . He goes against the land , and yet we have been on it for three generations , and have nothing to complain of ; and he is a good farmer , too , is Job , none better ; a little too fond of experimenting , but then he is young . But I am very much afraid he will leave me . I think it is this new thing the big - wigs have set up in London that has put him wrong , for he is always reading their papers . ”
20819	20825	20827	20828	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ And what is that ? ”
20830	20854	20827	20828	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Well , they call themselves the Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge , and Lord Brougham is at the head of it . ”
20855	20864	20866	20867	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Ah ! he is a dangerous man , ”
20869	20879	20866	20867	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Do you know , I think he is , ”
20887	20908	20881	20882	Farmer Thornberry	395	“ and by this token , he says a knowledge of chemistry is necessary for the cultivation of the soil . ”
20909	20919	20921	20922	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Brougham is a man who would say anything , ”
20924	20985	20921	20922	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ and of one thing you may be quite certain , that there is no subject which Lord Brougham knows thoroughly . I have proved that , and if you ever have time some winter evening to read something on the matter , I will lend you a number of the ‘ Quarterly Review , ’ which might interest you . ”
20986	20996	20998	20999	the farmer	1490	“ I wish you would lend it to Job , ”
21117	21130	21132	21133	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ But it is a pleasant life , that of a farmer , ”
21137	21149	21151	21151	Job	396	“ Yes , but life should be something more than pleasant , ”
21158	21169	21151	21151	Job	396	“ an ox in a pasture has a pleasant life . ”
21170	21185	21187	21188	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Well , and why should it not be a profitable one , too ? ”
21190	21200	21202	21202	Job	396	“ I do not see my way to that , ”
21205	21231	21202	21202	Job	396	“ there is not much to be got out of the land at any time , and still less on the terms we hold it . ”
21232	21241	21151	21151	Job	396	“ But you are not high - rented ! ”
21242	21260	21262	21262	Job	396	“ Oh , rent is nothing , if everything else were right , but nothing is right , ”
21264	21284	21262	21262	Job	396	“ In the first place , a farmer is the only trader who has no security for his capital . ”
21285	21293	21202	21202	Job	396	“ Ah ! you want a lease ? ”
21294	21311	21313	21313	Job	396	“ I should be very sorry to have a lease like any that I have seen , ”
21315	21348	21313	21313	Job	396	“ We had one once in our family , and we keep it as a curiosity . It is ten skins long , and more tyrannical nonsense was never engrossed by man . ”
21349	21366	21368	21368	Ferrars	425	“ But your family , I believe , has been on this estate for generations now , ”
21370	21377	21368	21368	Ferrars	425	“ and they have done well . ”
21378	21393	21395	21395	Job	396	“ They have done about as well as their stock . They have existed , ”
21397	21401	21395	21395	Job	396	“ nothing more . ”
21402	21416	21418	21419	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Your father always gives me quite the idea of a prosperous man , ”
21421	21435	21437	21437	Job	396	“ Whether he be or not I am sure I can not say , ”
21439	21521	21437	21437	Job	396	“ for as neither he nor any of his predecessors ever kept any accounts , it is rather difficult to ascertain their exact condition . So long as he has money enough in his pocket to pay his labourers and buy a little stock , my father , like every British farmer , is content . The fact is , he is a serf as much as his men , and until we get rid of feudalism he will remain so . ”
21522	21528	21530	21531	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ These are strong opinions , ”
21542	21552	21554	21554	Job	396	“ Yes , but they will make their way , ”
21556	21609	21554	21554	Job	396	“ So far as I myself am concerned , I do not much care what happens to the land , for I do not mean to remain on it ; but I care for the country . For the sake of the country I should like to see the whole thing upset . ”
21610	21614	21616	21617	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ What thing ? ”
21619	21622	21624	21624	Job	396	“ Feudalism , ”
21626	21678	21624	21624	Job	396	“ I should like to see this estate managed on the same principles as they do their great establishments in the north of England . Instead of feudalism , I would substitute the commercial principle . I would have long leases without covenants ; no useless timber , and no game . ”
21679	21688	21690	21691	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Why , you would destroy the country , ”
21693	21702	21704	21704	Job	396	“ We owe everything to the large towns , ”
21706	21716	21718	21719	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ The people in the large towns are miserable , ”
21721	21735	21737	21737	Job	396	“ They can not be more miserable than the people in the country , ”
21739	21745	21747	21748	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Their wretchedness is notorious , ”
21750	21756	21747	21748	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Look at their riots . ”
21757	21773	21774	21775	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Well , we had Swing in the country only two or three years ago . ”
21807	21826	21791	21791	he	425	“ If it were not for the agricultural districts , the King ’s army could not be recruited . ”
21827	21837	21839	21839	Job	396	“ Well , that would not break my heart , ”
21841	21853	21839	21839	Job	396	“ Why , my good fellow , you are a Radical ! ”
21854	21863	21865	21865	Job	396	“ They may call me what they like , ”
21867	21894	21865	21865	Job	396	“ but it will not alter matters . However , I am going among the Radicals soon , and then I shall know what they are . ”
21895	21905	21907	21908	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ And can you leave your truly respectable parent ? ”
21927	21986	21913	21913	he	425	“ Oh ! my respectable parent will do very well without me , sir . Only let him be able to drive into Bamford on market day , and get two or three linendrapers to take their hats off to him , and he will be happy enough , and always ready to die for our glorious Constitution . ”
22141	22149	22136	22136	She	330	“ these people never could go on , ”
22401	22408	22410	22410	he	425	“ there was a screw loose , ”
22412	22418	22422	22423	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ look out for squalls . ”
22845	22857	22842	22842	Nigel	548	“ What does Mr. Ferrars mean you to be , Endymion ? ”
22858	22864	22866	22866	Endymion	425	“ I do not know , ”
22871	22881	22866	22866	Endymion	425	“ But I suppose you are to be something ? ”
22882	22899	22842	22842	Nigel	548	“ Yes ; I suppose I must be something ; because papa has lost his fortune . ”
22900	22909	22842	22842	Nigel	548	“ And what would you like to be ? ”
22910	22917	22919	22919	Endymion	425	“ I never thought about it , ”
22921	22939	22941	22941	Nigel	548	“ In my opinion there is only one thing for a man to be in this age , ”
22944	22952	22941	22941	Nigel	548	“ he should go into the Church . ”
22953	22957	22959	22959	Endymion	425	“ The Church ! ”
22961	22970	22972	22972	Nigel	548	“ There will soon be nothing else left , ”
22974	23029	22972	22972	Nigel	548	“ The Church must last for ever . It is built upon a rock . It was founded by God ; all other governments have been founded by men . When they are destroyed , and the process of destruction seems rapid , there will be nothing left to govern mankind except the Church . ”
23030	23033	23035	23035	Endymion	425	“ Indeed ! ”
23037	23059	23035	23035	Endymion	425	“ papa is very much in favour of the Church , and , I know , is writing something about it . ”
23060	23070	23072	23072	Nigel	548	“ Yes , but Mr. Ferrars is an Erastian , ”
23074	23160	23072	23072	Nigel	548	“ you need not tell him I said so , but he is one . He wants the Church to be the servant of the State , and all that sort of thing , but that will not do any longer . This destruction of the Irish bishoprics has brought affairs to a crisis . No human power has the right to destroy a bishopric . It is a divinely - ordained office , and when a diocese is once established , it is eternal . ”
23161	23165	23167	23167	Endymion	425	“ I see , ”
23172	23176	23178	23178	Nigel	548	“ I wish , ”
23180	23243	23178	23178	Nigel	548	“ you were two or three years older , and Mr. Ferrars could send you to Oxford . That is the place to understand these things , and they will soon be the only things to understand . The rector knows nothing about them . My father is thoroughly high and dry , and has not the slightest idea of Church principles . ”
23244	23247	23249	23249	Endymion	425	“ Indeed ! ”
23251	23262	23264	23264	Nigel	548	“ It is quite a new set even at Oxford , ”
23266	23285	23264	23264	Nigel	548	“ but their principles are as old as the Apostles , and come down from them , straight . ”
23286	23294	23296	23296	Endymion	425	“ That is a long time ago , ”
23298	23305	23307	23307	Nigel	548	“ I have a great fancy , ”
23315	23369	23307	23307	Nigel	548	“ to give you a thorough Church education . It would be the making of you . You would then have a purpose in life , and never be in doubt or perplexity on any subject . We ought to move heaven and earth to induce Mr. Ferrars to send you to Oxford . ”
23370	23379	23381	23381	Endymion	425	“ I will speak to Myra about it , ”
23383	23396	23398	23398	Nigel	548	“ I said something of this to your sister the other day , ”
23400	23452	23398	23398	Nigel	548	“ but I fear she is terribly Erastian . However , I will give you something to read . It is not very long , but you can read it at your leisure , and then we will talk over it afterwards , and perhaps I may give you something else . ”
23518	23522	23523	23523	she	1096	“ Dear darling , ”
23526	23544	23523	23523	she	1096	“ if you are to be a clergyman , I should like you to be a cardinal . ”
23931	23944	23945	23945	she	335	“ I do not so much care about my jewels , William , ”
23951	23959	23945	23945	she	335	“ but one must have new dresses . ”
24112	24120	24122	24123	the servant	1560	“ There is a parcel from London , ”
24134	24141	24122	24123	the servant	1560	“ It is on your desk . ”
24257	24267	24268	24268	he	425	“ A letter , my love , from Barron , ”
24271	24294	24268	24268	he	425	“ The King has dismissed Lord Melbourne and sent for the Duke of Wellington , who has accepted the conduct of affairs . ”
24295	24303	24305	24306	his wife	1261	“ You must go to town directly , ”
24308	24330	24305	24306	his wife	1261	“ He offered you the Cabinet in 1832 . No person has such a strong claim on him as you have . ”
24331	24343	24345	24346	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ It does not appear that he is exactly prime minister , ”
24354	24378	24345	24346	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ They have sent for Peel , who is at Rome , but the Duke is to conduct the government till he arrives . ”
24379	24387	24389	24390	Mrs. Ferrars	330	“ You must go to town immediately , ”
24392	24508	24389	24390	Mrs. Ferrars	330	“ There is not a moment to be lost . Send down to the Horse Shoe and secure an inside place in the Salisbury coach . It reaches this place at nine to - morrow morning . I will have everything ready . You must take a portmanteau and a carpet - bag . I wonder if you could get a bedroom at the Rodneys ’ . It would be so nice to be among old friends ; they must feel for you . And then it will be near the Carlton , which is a great thing . I wonder how he will form his cabinet . What a pity he is not here ! ”
24509	24523	24525	24525	Ferrars	330	“ It is a wonderful event , but the difficulties must be immense , ”
24527	24564	24525	24525	Ferrars	330	“ Oh ! you always see difficulties . I see none . The King is with us , the country is disgusted . It is what I always said would be ; the reaction is complete . ”
24565	24578	24580	24580	Ferrars	330	“ Well , we had better now go and tell the children , ”
24582	24593	24595	24595	he	1567	“ I leave you all here for the first time , ”
24600	24611	24613	24614	Mrs. Ferrars	330	“ Well , I hope we shall soon join you , ”
24616	24663	24613	24614	Mrs. Ferrars	330	“ It is the very best time for hiring a house . What I have set my heart upon is the Green Park . It will be near your office and not too near . I am sure I could not live again in a street . ”
24861	24873	24875	24875	Myra	466	“ I wonder if we shall be restored to our greatness , ”
24879	24898	24875	24875	Myra	466	“ Well , I shall be sorry to leave the old place ; I have been happy here . ”
24899	24904	24906	24906	Myra	466	“ I have not , ”
24908	24927	24906	24906	Myra	466	“ and I do not think I could have borne this life had it not been for you . ”
24928	24936	24938	24938	Endymion	425	“ It will be a wonderful change , ”
24940	24968	24938	24938	Endymion	425	“ If it comes ; I fear papa is not daring enough . However , if we get out of this hole , it will be something . ”
25145	25186	25132	25132	he	425	“ You forget I am to rise with the lark . I shall write to you every day . Best and dearest of women , you have always been right , and all my good fortune has come from you . ”

27530	27579	27527	27527	he	408	“ When there has been a crash , there is nothing like a change of scene . I propose that you and Mrs. Rodney should come and stay with me a week at my house at Barnes , and there a good many things may occur to us . ”
27616	27810	27612	27613	their host	1696	“ You know I rather speculate in houses . I bought one last year in Warwick Street . It is a large roomy house in a quiet situation , though in a bustling quarter , just where members of parliament would like to lodge . I have put it in thorough repair . What I propose is that you should live there , let the first and second floors — they are equally good — and live on the ground floor yourselves , which is amply convenient . We will not talk about rent till the year is over and we see how it answers . The house is unfurnished , but that is nothing . I will introduce you to a friend of mine who will furnish it for you solidly and handsomely , you paying a percentage on the amount expended . He will want a guarantee , but of course I will be that . It is an experiment , but try it . Try it for a year ; at any rate you will be a householder , and you will have the opportunity of thinking of something else . ”

28623	28656	28611	28613	a young M.P.	1744	“ Have not the remotest idea ; never saw him before . Barron is speaking to him ; he will tell us . I say , Barron , who is your friend ? ”
28657	28662	28611	28613	a young M.P.	1744	“ That is Ferrars ! ”
28663	28670	28611	28613	a young M.P.	1744	“ Ferrars ! who is he ? ”
28671	28700	28611	28613	a young M.P.	1744	“ One of our best men . If all our fellows had fought like him against the Reform Bill , that infernal measure would never have been carried . ”

28717	28736	28713	28715	the young M.P.	1746	“ but anything that happened before the election of ‘ 32 I look upon as an old almanack . ”

28908	28924	28895	28898	the husband of Zenobia	922	“ I hope it will float , but we shall know nothing till Peel comes . ”
28925	28943	28945	28948	an old privy councillor	1763	“ He will have difficulty with his cabinet so far as the House of Commons is concerned , ”
28949	28962	28895	28898	the husband of Zenobia	922	“ They must have seats , and his choice is very limited . ”
28963	28968	28970	28973	the husband of Zenobia	922	“ He will dissolve , ”
28975	28979	28970	28973	the husband of Zenobia	922	“ He must . ”
28980	28983	28985	28987	the privy councillor	1765	“ Wheugh ! ”
28995	29003	29005	29008	the husband of Zenobia	922	“ The old story will not do , ”
29010	29025	29005	29008	the husband of Zenobia	922	“ We must have new blood . Peel must reconstruct on a broad basis . ”
29026	29038	29040	29043	the old privy councillor	1767	“ Well , they say there is no lack of converts , ”

29535	29552	29533	29533	Ferrars	425	“ but I was in hopes that there were yet some seats that we might command . ”
29553	29559	29561	29562	Mr. Barron	404	“ No doubt there are , ”
29564	29614	29561	29562	Mr. Barron	404	“ but they are few , and they are occupied — at least at present . But , after all , a thousand things may turn up , and you may consider nothing definitely arranged until Sir Robert arrives . The great thing is to be on the spot . ”
29830	29837	29822	29822	her	335	“ It was like old days , ”
30088	30105	30081	30081	She	1261	“ Is it very bad , love ? I fear you have softened it to me ? ”
30106	30196	30081	30081	She	1261	“ By no means bad , and I told you the truth : not all , for had I , my letter would have been too late . He said nothing about the cabinet , but offered me a high post in his government , provided I could secure my seat . That was impossible . During the month I was in town I had realised that . I thought it best , therefore , at once to try the other tack , and nothing could be more satisfactory . ”
30197	30205	30206	30206	she	1798	“ Did you say anything about India ? ”
30214	30335	30206	30206	she	1798	“ I did not . He is an honourable man , but he is cold , and my manner is not distinguished for abandon . I thought it best to speak generally , and leave it to him . He acknowledged my claim , and my fitness for such posts , and said if his government lasted it would gratify him to meet my wishes . Barron says the government will last . They will have a majority , and if Stanley and Graham had joined them , they would have had not an inconsiderable one . But in that case I should probably not have had the cabinet , if indeed he meant to offer it to me now . ”
30336	30342	30344	30345	his wife	1261	“ Of course he did , ”
30347	30378	30344	30345	his wife	1261	“ Who has such claims as you have ? Well , now we must hope and watch . Look cheerful to the children , for they have been very anxious . ”
30547	30554	30555	30555	he	1799	“ as for you , Endymion , ”
30558	30729	30555	30555	he	1799	“ I have been much more successful for you than for your father , though I hope I shall not have myself in the long run to complain . Our friends are faithful to us , and I have got you put down on the private list for a clerkship both in the Foreign Office and the Treasury . They are the two best things , and you will have one of the first vacancies that will occur in either department . I know your mother wishes you to be in the Foreign Office . Let it be so if it come . I confess , myself , remembering your grandfather ’s career , I have always a weakness for the Treasury , but so long as I see you well planted in Whitehall , I shall be content . Let me see , you will be sixteen in March . I could have wished you to wait another year , but we must be ready when the opening occurs . ”
31034	31048	31050	31050	Myra	466	“ I do not see why I also should not be left behind , ”
31061	31074	31050	31050	Myra	466	“ I should like to live in London in lodgings with you . ”
31118	31128	31129	31129	she	466	“ My only joy in life is seeing you , ”
31133	31164	31129	31129	she	466	“ and yet this separation does not make me unhappy . It seems a chance from heaven for you . I pray every night it may be the Foreign Office . ”
31268	31273	31274	31274	he	404	“ It is something , ”
31277	31317	31274	31274	he	404	“ to have something to give up . We shall not , I suppose , always be out of office , and they get preferred more easily whose promotion contributes to patronage , even while they claim its exercise . ”
31495	31500	31492	31500	this man , “ who had claims , ”	7068	“ who had claims , ”
32120	32126	32128	32129	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ and for this purpose , ”
32131	32142	32144	32144	he	425	“ I have just sent for him to my room ; ”
32189	32196	32197	32197	she	466	“ How long you have been ! ”
32200	32212	32197	32197	she	466	“ I have been watching for you . What is settled ? ”
32233	32287	32230	32230	he	425	“ I have settled to go , and I am resolved , so long as I live , that I will never cost dear papa another shilling . Things here are very bad , quite as bad as you have sometimes fancied . But do not say anything to poor mamma about them . ”
32494	32530	32488	32489	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ I have treated you in this matter as a man , and I have entire confidence in you . Your business in life is to build up again a family which was once honoured . ”
32545	32551	32552	32552	she	466	“ These are for myself , ”

34050	34178	34047	34047	he	1916	“ and now I will introduce you to your future comrades . This is Mr. Jawett , the greatest Radical of the age , and who , when he is President of the Republic , will , I hope , do a job for his friends here . This is Mr. St. Barbe , who , when the public taste has improved , will be the most popular author of the day . In the meantime he will give you a copy of his novel , which has not sold as it ought to have done , and in which we say he has quizzed all his friends . This is Mr. Seymour Hicks , who , as you must perceive , is a man of fashion . ”
34264	34305	34236	34238	Mr. St. Barbe	428	“ We , the undersigned , highly approving of the personal appearance and manners of our new colleague , are unanimously of opinion that he should be invited to join our symposium to - day at the immortal Joe ’s . ”

But I go further than that . I would disendow every Church . They are not productive institutions . There is no reason why they should exist . There is no use in them . ”
35183	35190	35192	35192	Endymion	425	“ No use in the Church ! ”
35210	35246	35197	35198	Mr. Trenchard	431	“ I told you our friend Jawett is a great Radical ; but he is in a minority among us on these matters . Everybody , however , says what he likes at Joe ’s . ”

35773	35819	35770	35770	Trenchard	431	“ Well , you will some day ; but you had better come with us . You need not smoke ; you can order a cup of coffee , and then you may read all the newspapers and magazines . It is a nice lounge . ”
35931	35957	35959	35959	he	428	“ I am not inclined to smoke to - day . We will order some coffee , and you will find some amusement in this ; ”

36059	36105	36056	36056	he	428	“ that develops the kindly qualities of our nature . I believe the sense of common degradation has a tendency to make the degraded amiable — at least among themselves . I am told it is found so in the plantations in slave - gangs . ”
36106	36118	36120	36120	Endymion	425	“ But I hope we are not a slave - gang , ”
36122	36149	36151	36152	St. Barbe	428	“ It is horrible to think of gentlemen , and men of education , and perhaps first - rate talents — who knows?—reduced to our straits , ”
36154	36222	36151	36152	St. Barbe	428	“ I do not follow Jawett in all his views , for I hate political economy , and never could understand it ; and he gives it you pure and simple , eh ? eh?—but , I say , it is something awful to think of the incomes that some men are making , who could no more write an article in ‘ SCARAMOUCH ’ than fly . ”
36223	36230	36232	36232	Endymion	425	“ But our incomes may improve , ”
36234	36250	36232	36232	Endymion	425	“ I was told to - day that promotion was even rapid in our office . ”
36251	36263	36265	36266	St. Barbe	428	“ Our incomes may improve when we are bent and grey , ”
36268	36307	36265	36266	St. Barbe	428	“ and we may even retire on a pension about as good as a nobleman leaves to his valet . Oh , it is a horrid world ! Your father is a privy councillor , is not he ? ”
36308	36328	36232	36232	Endymion	425	“ Yes , and so was my grandfather , but I do not think I shall ever be one . ”
36329	36343	36345	36346	St. Barbe	428	“ It is a great thing to have a father a privy councillor , ”
36354	36424	36232	36232	Endymion	425	“ If I were the son of a privy councillor , those demons , Shuffle and Screw , would give me 500 pounds for my novel , which now they put in their beastly magazine and print in small type , and do not pay me so much as a powdered flunkey has in St. James ’ Square . I agree with Jawett : the whole thing is rotten . ”
36425	36435	36437	36437	Endymion	425	“ Mr. Jawett seems to have very strange opinions , ”
36439	36472	36437	36437	Endymion	425	“ I did not like to hear what he said at dinner about the Church , but Mr. Trenchard turned the conversation , and I thought it best to let it pass . ”
36473	36485	36487	36488	St. Barbe	428	“ Trenchard is a sensible man , and a good fellow , ”
36490	36495	36487	36488	St. Barbe	428	“ you like him ? ”
36496	36502	36437	36437	Endymion	425	“ I find him kind . ”
36503	36508	36510	36511	St. Barbe	428	“ Do you know , ”
36528	36561	36562	36562	he	428	“ that man may come any day into four thousand a year . There is only one life between him and the present owner . I believe it is a good life , ”
36571	36607	36562	36562	he	428	“ but still it might happen . Is it not horrible ? Four thousand a year ! Trenchard with four thousand a year , and we receiving little more than the pay of a butler ! ”
36608	36623	36625	36625	Endymion	425	“ Well , I wish , for his sake , he might have it , ”
36627	36636	36625	36625	Endymion	425	“ though I might lose a kind friend . ”
36637	36643	36645	36646	St. Barbe	428	“ Look at Seymour Hicks , ”
36648	36758	36645	36646	St. Barbe	428	“ he has smoked his cigar , and he is going . He never remains . He is going to a party , I ’ll be found . That fellow gets about in a most extraordinary manner . Is it not disgusting ? I doubt whether he is asked much to dinner though , or I think we should have heard of it . Nevertheless , Trenchard said the other day that Hicks had dined with Lord Cinque - Ports . I can hardly believe it ; it would be too disgusting . No lord ever asked me to dinner . But the aristocracy of this country are doomed ! ”
36759	36763	36765	36765	Endymion	425	“ Mr. Hicks , ”
36767	36775	36765	36765	Endymion	425	“ probably lays himself out for society . ”
36776	36782	36784	36785	St. Barbe	428	“ I suppose you will , ”
36792	36977	36784	36785	St. Barbe	428	“ I should if I were the son of a privy councillor . Hicks is nothing ; his father kept a stable - yard and his mother was an actress . We have had several dignitaries of the Church in my family and one admiral . And yet Hicks dines with Lord Cinque - Ports ! It is positively revolting ! But the things he does to get asked!—sings , rants , conjures , ventriloquises , mimics , stands on his head . His great performance is a parliamentary debate . We will make him do it for you . And yet with all this a dull dog — a very dull dog , sir . He wrote for ‘ Scaramouch ’ some little time , but they can stand it no more . Between you and me , he has had notice to quit . That I know ; and he will probably get the letter when he goes home from his party to - night . So much for success in society ! I shall now say good - night to you . ”

37174	37200	37171	37171	she	420	“ but they left strict instructions with me to see that you were comfortable , and that you wanted for nothing that we could supply . ”

37222	37248	37212	37212	she	420	“ and , to tell you the truth , these are luxuries I am not accustomed to , and to which I am not entitled . ”
37249	37253	37254	37254	she	420	“ And yet , ”
37266	37290	37254	37254	she	420	“ they tell me time was when gold was not good enough for you , and I do not think it could be . ”
37291	37297	37299	37299	Endymion	425	“ Such kindness as this , ”
37301	37308	37254	37254	she	420	“ is more precious than gold . ”
37309	37399	37212	37212	she	420	“ I hope you will find your things well arranged . All your clothes are in these two drawers ; the coats in the bottom one , and your linen in those above . You will not perhaps be able to find your pocket - handkerchiefs at first . They are in this sachet ; my sister made it herself . Mr. Rodney says you are to be called at eight o’clock and breakfast at nine . I think everything is right . Good - night , Mr. Endymion . ”
37938	38004	37909	37909	he	408	“ That is Mr. Ferrars , in a certain sense under my care ; his father is a privy councillor , and had it not been for the revolution — for I maintain , and always will , the Reform Bill was neither more nor less than a revolution — would probably have been Prime Minister . He was my earliest and my best friend . ”

38821	38842	38818	38819	Mrs. Rodney	410	“ I declare to you , some of the happiest hours of my life have been passed in Warwick Street , ”
38848	38856	38858	38859	Mrs. Rodney	410	“ I wish I could believe that , ”

39211	39232	39208	39209	Seymour Hicks	429	“ for I observed an earl ’s coronet on the drag . I can not make out who it is . ”

39253	39340	39250	39251	St. Barbe	428	“ indeed , I believe you go slower . It is mere pride ; puffed - up vanity . I should like to send those two grooms with their folded arms to the galleys — I hate those fellows . For my part , I never was behind four horses except in a stage - coach . No peer of the realm ever took me on his drag . However , a day of reckoning will come ; the people wo n’t stand this much longer . ”

42379	42409	42376	42376	he	411	“ Call on me to - morrow morning in Burlington Street in your way to your office . Do not mind the hour . I am an early bird . ”
42410	42416	42418	42419	Mr. Vigo	411	“ It is no favour , ”
42421	42455	42418	42419	Mr. Vigo	411	“ it is not even an act of friendliness ; it is a freak , and it is my freak ; the favour , if there be one , is conferred by you . ”
42456	42467	42469	42469	Endymion	425	“ But I really do not know what to say , ”
42475	42483	42485	42486	Mr. Vigo	411	“ I am not a classical scholar , ”
42488	42518	42485	42486	Mr. Vigo	411	“ but there are two things which I think I understand — men and horses . I like to back them both when I think they ought to win . ”
42519	42527	42529	42529	Endymion	425	“ But I am scarcely a man , ”
42534	42545	42529	42529	Endymion	425	“ and I sometimes think I shall never win anything . ”
42546	42552	42554	42555	Mr. Vigo	411	“ That is my affair , ”
42557	42710	42554	42555	Mr. Vigo	411	“ you are a yearling , and I have formed my judgment as to your capacity . What I wish to do in your case is what I have done in others , and some memorable ones . Dress does not make a man , but it often makes a successful one . The most precious stone , you know , must be cut and polished . I shall enter your name in my books for an unlimited credit , and no account to be settled till you are a privy councillor . I do not limit the credit , because you are a man of sense and a gentleman , and will not abuse it . But be quite as careful not to stint yourself as not to be needlessly extravagant . In the first instance , you would be interfering with my experiment , and that would not be fair . ”
42772	42788	42790	42791	Mr. Vigo	411	“ I have known many an heiress lost by her suitor being ill - dressed , ”
42793	43043	42790	42791	Mr. Vigo	411	“ You must dress according to your age , your pursuits , your object in life ; you must dress too , in some cases , according to your set . In youth a little fancy is rather expected , but if political life be your object , it should be avoided , at least after one - and - twenty . I am dressing two brothers now , men of considerable position ; one is a mere man of pleasure , the other will probably be a minister of state . They are as like as two peas , but were I to dress the dandy and the minister the same , it would be bad taste — it would be ridiculous . No man gives me the trouble which Lord Eglantine does ; he has not made up his mind whether he will be a great poet or prime minister . ‘ You must choose , my lord , ’ I tell him . ‘ I can not send you out looking like Lord Byron if you mean to be a Canning or a Pitt . ’ I have dressed a great many of our statesmen and orators , and I always dressed them according to their style and the nature of their duties . What all men should avoid is the ‘ shabby genteel . ’ No man ever gets over it . I will save you from that . You had better be in rags . ”
43917	43923	43925	43926	St. Barbe	428	“ I tell you what , ”
43955	44202	43925	43926	St. Barbe	428	“ a fellow might get a good chapter out of this scene . I could do it , but I will not . What is the use of lavishing one ’s brains on an ungrateful world ? Why , if that fellow Gushy were to write a description of this place , which he would do like a penny - a - liner drunk with ginger beer , every countess in Mayfair would be reading him , not knowing , the idiot , whether she ought to smile or shed tears , and sending him cards with ‘ at home ’ upon them as large as life . Oh ! it is disgusting ! absolutely disgusting . It is a nefarious world , sir . You will find it out some day . I am as much robbed by that fellow Gushy as men are on the highway . He is appropriating my income , and the income of thousands of honest fellows . And then he pretends he is writing for the people ! The people ! What does he know about the people ? Annals of the New Cut and Saffron Hill . He thinks he will frighten some lord , who will ask him to dinner . And that he calls Progress . I hardly know which is the worst class in this country — the aristocracy , the middle class , or what they call the people . I hate them all . ”

44235	44335	44232	44233	St. Barbe	428	“ They say that Trenchard is very fond of him . Fond of a brother who keeps him out of four thousand pounds per annum ! What will man not say ? And yet I could not go and congratulate Trenchard on his brother ’s death . It would be ‘ bad taste . ’ Trenchard would perhaps never speak to me again , though he had been lying awake all night chuckling over the event . And Gushy takes an amiable view of this world of hypocrisy and plunder . And that is why Gushy is so popular ! ”
44641	44646	44648	44648	Trenchard	431	“ That is Hortensius , ”
44650	44692	44648	44648	Trenchard	431	“ he will be called this term . They say he did nothing at the university , and is too idle to do anything at the bar ; but I think highly of him . You should hear him in reply . ”

44749	44758	44747	44747	Trenchard	431	“ but it will not go down here . ”

44832	44858	44830	44830	Trenchard	431	“ There are not twenty Tories in our Union , but we always listen to him . He is sharp , Jawett will answer him . ”
44925	44929	44931	44931	Trenchard	431	“ Always crotchety , ”
45036	45048	45050	45050	Trenchard	431	“ He only lost his election for Rattleton by ten votes , ”
45052	45070	45050	45050	Trenchard	431	“ We call him the Lord Protector , and his friends here think he will be so . ”
45186	45196	45198	45198	Endymion	425	“ I should not care how lazy I was , ”
45200	45208	45198	45198	Endymion	425	“ if I could speak like Hortensius . ”
45422	45428	45433	45433	he	425	“ And where is mamma ? ”
45439	45446	45448	45449	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ She will be here directly , ”
45451	45467	45448	45449	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ You are late , and the suspense of your arrival a little agitated her . ”
45616	45621	45608	45609	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ I think now ; ”
45638	45647	45649	45650	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ She is gone for your poor mother , ”
45652	45663	45649	45650	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ we are uneasy about her , my dear boy . ”
45679	45691	45693	45693	Myra	466	“ She says she must see him first in her room , ”
45704	45719	45693	45693	Myra	466	“ but that will never do ; you or I must go with him . ”
45720	45726	45728	45729	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ You had better go , ”
45742	45753	45755	45756	his sister	1096	“ I go with you , to prevent dreadful scenes , ”
45761	45779	45755	45756	his sister	1096	“ Try to behave just as in old times , and as if you saw no change . ”
45812	45831	45805	45805	she	466	“ We are all so happy to see Endymion again , dear mamma . Papa is quite gay . ”
45859	45879	45845	45846	Mrs. Ferrars	330	“ Oh ! I am so happy to see you again , my child . I feel quite gay . ”
46017	46041	46043	46043	she	466	“ You know , mamma , you are to dine downstairs to - day , and you will hardly have time to dress ; ”
46089	46098	46099	46099	she	330	“ Endymion must take me in to dinner , ”
46236	46240	46242	46243	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Poor creature ! ”
46249	46259	46242	46243	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Seeing you has been too much for her . ”
46339	46344	46346	46347	Mrs. Penruddock	394	“ that is all , ”
46349	46427	46346	46347	Mrs. Penruddock	394	“ we have to walk upon , except the high road . The snow has drifted to such a degree that it is impossible to get to the Chase . I went out the day before yesterday with Carlo as a guide . When I did not clearly make out my way , I sent him forward , and sometimes I could only see his black head emerging from the snow . So I had to retreat . ”
46925	46931	46933	46933	Nigel	548	“ The Church is cosmopolitan , ”
46935	46952	46933	46933	Nigel	548	“ the only practicable means by which you can attain to identity of motive and action . ”
47122	47133	47116	47116	he	548	“ Nigel is as strong as ever in his views . ”
47134	47137	47138	47138	she	1096	“ Yes , ”
47141	47169	47138	47138	she	1096	“ he is very clever and very good - looking . It is a pity he is going into the Church . I do not like clergymen . ”
47442	47466	47430	47430	He	548	“ If I am fortunate , he will be here in four hours ; at all events , I will not return alone . ”
48500	48514	48515	48515	he	548	“ I am sure I can not give you news of your brother , ”
48518	48541	48515	48515	he	548	“ but I have had a letter this morning from Endymion . He seems to take great interest in his debating club . ”
48542	48555	48557	48557	Myra	466	“ I am so glad he has become a member of it , ”
48559	48607	48557	48557	Myra	466	“ That kind Mr. Trenchard , whom I shall never see to thank him for all his goodness to Endymion , proposed him . It occupies his evenings twice a week , and then it gives him subjects to think of and read up in the interval . ”
48608	48617	48619	48619	Nigel	548	“ Yes ; it is a good thing , ”
48622	48642	48619	48619	Nigel	548	“ and if he is destined for public life , which perhaps he may be , no contemptible discipline . ”
48643	48647	48649	48649	Myra	466	“ Dear boy ! ”
48655	48680	48649	48649	Myra	466	“ I do not see what public life he is destined to , except slaving at a desk . But sometimes one has dreams . ”
48681	48689	48691	48691	Nigel	548	“ Yes ; we all have dreams , ”
48699	48713	48715	48715	Myra	466	“ It is impossible to resist the fascination of a fine autumnal morn , ”
48717	48744	48715	48715	Myra	466	“ but give me the long days of summer and its rich leafy joys . I like to wander about , and dine at nine o’clock . ”
48745	48755	48649	48649	Myra	466	“ Delightful , doubtless , with a sympathising companion . ”
48756	48764	48766	48766	Myra	466	“ Endymion was such a charming companion , ”
48768	48775	48777	48777	Nigel	548	“ But he has left us , ”
48779	48785	48777	48777	Nigel	548	“ and you are alone . ”
48786	48791	48793	48793	Myra	466	“ I am alone , ”
48795	48810	48793	48793	Myra	466	“ but I am used to solitude , and I can think of him . ”
48811	48817	48819	48819	Nigel	548	“ Would I were Endymion , ”
48821	48829	48819	48819	Nigel	548	“ to be thought of by you ! ”
48844	48943	48841	48841	he	548	“ All seasons would be to me fascination , were I only by your side . Yes ; I can no longer repress the irresistible confusion of my love . I am here , and I am here only , because I love you . I quitted Oxford and all its pride that I might have the occasional delight of being your companion . I was not presumptuous in my thoughts , and believed that would content me ; but I can no longer resist the consummate spell , and I offer you my heart and my life . ”
48944	48955	48957	48957	Myra	466	“ I am amazed ; I am a little overwhelmed , ”
48959	48981	48841	48841	he	548	“ Pardon me , dear Mr. Penruddock — dear Nigel — you speak of things of which I have not thought . ”
48982	48998	48841	48841	he	548	“ Think of them ! I implore you to think of them , and now ! ”
48999	49006	49008	49008	Myra	466	“ We are a fallen family , ”
49010	49085	49008	49008	Myra	466	“ perhaps a doomed one . We are not people to connect yourself with . You have witnessed some of our sorrows , and soothed them . I shall be ever grateful to you for the past . But I sometimes feel our cup is not yet full , and I have long resolved to bear my cross alone . But , irrespective of all other considerations , I can never leave my father . ”
49086	49094	49096	49096	Nigel	548	“ I have spoken to your father , ”
49098	49105	49096	49096	Nigel	548	“ and he approved my suit . ”
49106	49117	49119	49119	Myra	466	“ While my father lives I shall not quit him , ”
49121	49143	49119	49119	Myra	466	“ but , let me not mislead you , I do not live for my father — I live for another . ”
49144	49148	49150	49150	Nigel	548	“ For another ? ”
49155	49260	49262	49262	she	2399	“ For one you know . My life is devoted to Endymion . There is a mystic bond between us , originating , perhaps , in the circumstance of our birth ; for we are twins . I never mean to embarrass him with a sister ’s love , and perhaps hereafter may see less of him even than I see now ; but I shall be in the world , whatever be my lot , high or low — the active , stirring world — working for him , thinking only of him . Yes ; moulding events and circumstances in his favour ; ”
49268	49309	49262	49262	she	2399	“ I have brought myself , by long meditation , to the conviction that a human being with a settled purpose must accomplish it , and that nothing can resist a will that will stake even existence for its fulfilment . ”
49604	49610	49612	49612	Imogene	420	“ I never saw her , ”
49614	49623	49612	49612	Imogene	420	“ but I am told she was heavenly . ”
49701	49711	49713	49713	Waldershare	442	“ You are in the precincts of public life , ”
49715	49729	49730	49730	he	442	“ and if you ever enter it , which I think you will , ”
49735	49768	49769	49769	he	442	“ it will be interesting for you to remember that you have seen these characters , many of whom will then have passed away . Like the shades of a magic lantern , ”
49781	49838	49769	49769	he	442	“ One of my constituents sent me a homily this morning , the burthen of which was , I never thought of death . The idiot ! I never think of anything else . It is my weakness . One should never think of death . One should think of life . That is real piety . ”
50213	50227	50229	50229	Endymion	425	“ I trust I shall ever be a devoted son of the Church , ”
50231	50352	50229	50229	Endymion	425	“ but I confess I feel no predisposition to take orders , even if I had the opportunity , which probably I never shall have . If I were to choose my career it would be public life . I am on the last step of the ladder , and I do not suppose that I can ever be anything but a drudge . But even that would interest me . It brings one in contact with those who are playing the great game . One at least fancies one comprehends something of the government of mankind . Mr. Waldershare takes me often to the House of Commons , and I must say , I am passionately fond of it . ”
50446	50452	50453	50453	she	2391	“ Is it about Nigel ? ”
50458	50464	50453	50453	she	2391	“ It is about Nigel . ”
50465	50478	50425	50426	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ I have seen him , and he has spoken to me . ”
50479	50486	50529	50529	he	425	“ And what have you replied ? ”
50487	50505	50453	50453	she	2391	“ What I fear will not be satisfactory to you , sir , but what is irrevocable . ”
50506	50516	50518	50519	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Your union would give me life and hope , ”
50535	50613	50529	50529	he	425	“ For its happiness there seems every security . He is of good family , and with adequate means , and , I firmly believe , no inconsiderable future . His abilities are already recognised ; his disposition is noble . As for his personal qualities , you are a better judge than I am ; but , for my part , I never saw a countenance that more became the beauty and nobility of his character . ”
50614	50623	50625	50625	Myra	466	“ I think him very good - looking , ”
50627	50651	50625	50625	Myra	466	“ and there is no doubt he is clever , and he has shown himself , on more than one occasion , amiable . ”
50652	50660	50662	50663	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Then what more can you require ? ”
50665	50677	50662	50663	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ I require nothing ; I do not wish to marry . ”
50678	50688	50690	50691	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ But , my daughter , my dearest daughter , ”
50693	50754	50690	50691	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ bear with the anxiety of a parent who is at least devoted to you . Our separation would be my last and severest sorrow , and I have had many ; but there is no necessity to consider that case , for Nigel is content , is more than content , to live as your husband under this roof . ”
50755	50761	50662	50663	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ So he told me . ”
50762	50774	50690	50691	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ And that removed one objection that you might naturally feel ? ”
50775	50785	50787	50787	Myra	466	“ I certainly should never leave you , sir , ”
50789	50820	50787	50787	Myra	466	“ and I told Nigel so ; but that contingency had nothing to do with my decision . I declined his offer , because I have no wish to marry . ”
50821	50829	50831	50832	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Women are born to be married , ”
50834	50844	50846	50846	Myra	466	“ And yet I believe most marriages are unhappy , ”
50848	50866	50868	50869	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ Oh ! if your objection to marry Nigel arises from an abstract objection to marriage itself , ”
50871	50889	50868	50869	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ it is a subject which we might talk over calmly , and perhaps remove your prejudices . ”
50890	50898	50900	50900	Myra	466	“ I have no objection against marriage , ”
50902	50966	50900	50900	Myra	466	“ It is likely enough that I may marry some day , and probably make an unhappy marriage ; but that is not the question before us . It is whether I should marry Nigel . That can not be , my dear father , and he knows it . I have assured him so in a manner which can not be mistaken . ”
50967	50974	50979	50979	Ferrars	425	“ We are a doomed family ! ”
50985	50992	50994	50994	Myra	466	“ So I have long felt , ”
50996	51023	50994	50994	Myra	466	“ I can bear our lot ; but I want no strangers to be introduced to share its bitterness , and soothe us with their sympathy . ”
51024	51031	51033	51034	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ You speak like a girl , ”
51036	51077	51033	51034	Mr. Ferrars	425	“ and a headstrong girl , which you always have been . You know not what you are talking about . It is a matter of life or death . Your decorous marriage would have saved us from absolute ruin . ”
51078	51087	51089	51089	Myra	466	“ Alone , I can meet absolute ruin , ”
51091	51204	51089	51089	Myra	466	“ I have long contemplated such a contingency , and am prepared for it . My marriage with Nigel could hardly save you , sir , from such a visitation , if it be impending . But I trust in that respect , if in no other , you have used a little of the language of exaggeration . I have never received , and I have never presumed to seek , any knowledge of your affairs ; but I have assumed , that for your life , somehow or other , you would be permitted to exist without disgrace . If I survive you , I have neither care nor fear . ”
51514	51521	51522	51522	he	2450	“ The rooms will suit me , ”
51525	51542	51544	51544	he	2450	“ and I have no doubt the price you ask for them is a just one ; ”
51578	51586	51588	51588	Sylvia	407	“ I am glad to hear that , ”
51590	51604	51588	51588	Sylvia	407	“ We have never let them before , except to a yearly tenant . ”
51605	51613	51615	51616	the gentleman	2026	“ And if we suit each other , ”
51618	51629	51615	51616	the gentleman	2026	“ I should have no great objection to becoming such . ”
51630	51635	51637	51637	Sylvia	407	“ In these matters , ”
51644	51669	51670	51670	she	407	“ we give and receive references . Mr. Rodney is well known in this neighbourhood and in Westminster generally ; but I dare say , ”
51674	51685	51670	51670	she	407	“ he has many acquaintances known to you , sir . ”
51686	51691	51693	51695	the young gentleman	2455	“ Not very likely , ”
51697	51712	51714	51714	he	2455	“ for I am a foreigner , and only arrived in England this morning ; ”
51732	51776	51777	51777	he	2455	“ It is quite just that you should be assured to whom you are letting your lodgings . The only reference I can give you is to my banker , but he is almost too great a man for such matters . Perhaps , ”
51803	51815	51798	51798	he	2455	“ this may assure you that your rent will be paid . ”
51869	51875	51876	51876	he	2455	“ That is really unnecessary , ”
51879	51905	51876	51876	he	2455	“ Your appearance commands from me that entire confidence which on your part you very properly refuse to a stranger and a foreigner like myself . ”
51906	51913	51915	51915	Sylvia	407	“ What a charming young man ! ”
51927	51930	51932	51934	the young gentleman	2455	“ Now , ”
51936	51980	51981	51981	he	2455	“ I will return to the station to release my servant , who is a prisoner there with my luggage . Be pleased to make him at home . I shall myself not return probably till the evening ; and in the meantime , ”
51989	52002	51981	51981	he	2455	“ you will admit anything that arrives here addressed to Colonel Albert . ”
52335	52341	52343	52344	Mr. Waldershare	442	“ If he be anybody , ”
52346	52366	52343	52344	Mr. Waldershare	442	“ he is sure in time to be known there , for he will be introduced as a visitor . ”
52377	52380	52376	52380	the “ Travellers ’ ”	7367	“ Travellers ’ ”
52754	52768	52750	52751	that gentleman	1654	“ Myra is at the rectory ; you are to come on there . ”
52769	52774	52750	52751	that gentleman	1654	“ And my father ? ”
52777	52782	52784	52785	Mr. Penruddock	390	“ Matters are critical , ”
52889	52900	52876	52876	he	1398	“ My dear boy , prepare yourself for the worst . ”
52901	52915	52876	52876	he	1398	“ Ah ! he is gone then ! my dear , dear father ! ”
52988	52994	52996	52996	Endymion	425	“ I must see Myra , ”
53009	53013	53015	53016	the rector	1398	“ Not yet , ”
53018	53038	53015	53016	the rector	1398	“ she is much disturbed . Your poor father is no more ; it is too true ; but , ”
53045	53052	53041	53042	the rector	1398	“ he did not die happily . ”
53053	53059	53061	53061	Endymion	425	“ What do you mean ? ”
53063	53073	53075	53076	the rector	1398	“ Your poor father had much to try him , ”
53078	53163	53165	53166	the rector	1398	“ His life , since he was amongst us here , was a life , for him , of adversity — perhaps of great adversity — yet he bore up against it with a Christian spirit ; he never repined . There was much that was noble and exalted in his character . But he never overcame the loss of your dear mother . He was never himself afterwards . He was not always master of himself . I could bear witness to that , ”
53177	53188	53165	53166	the rector	1398	“ Yes ; I could conscientiously give evidence to that effect ”
53191	53195	53197	53197	Endymion	425	“ What effect ? ”
53204	53209	53211	53212	the rector	1398	“ I could show , ”
53223	53243	53211	53212	the rector	1398	“ and others could show , that he was not master of himself when he committed the rash act . ”
53244	53249	53251	53251	Endymion	425	“ O Mr. Penruddock ! ”
53266	53272	53251	53251	Endymion	425	“ What is all this ? ”
53273	53292	53294	53295	Mr. Penruddock	390	“ That a great sorrow has come upon you , and your sister , and all of us , ”
53297	53329	53294	53295	Mr. Penruddock	390	“ and you , and she , and all of us must bow before the Divine will in trembling , though in hope . Your father ’s death was not natural . ”
53603	53614	53616	53616	Myra	466	“ I have been living in a tragedy for years , ”
53625	53633	53616	53616	Myra	466	“ and the catastrophe has now arrived . ”
53634	53641	53643	53643	Endymion	425	“ Oh , my dear father ! ”
53655	53671	53673	53673	Myra	466	“ Yes ; he was dear to us , and we were dear to him , ”
53675	53748	53673	53673	Myra	466	“ but the curtain has fallen . We have to exert ourselves . Energy and self - control were never more necessary to two human beings than to us . Here are his keys ; his papers must be examined by no one but ourselves . There is a terrible ceremony taking place , or impending . When it is all over , we must visit the hall at least once more . ”
54151	54161	54163	54163	Myra	466	“ And there will be enough left for me , ”
54165	54191	54163	54163	Myra	466	“ I only want ten pounds ; for I have ascertained that there is no part of England where ten pounds will not take me . ”
54203	54206	54207	54207	he	425	“ No , ”
54211	54217	54207	54207	he	425	“ we must never part . ”
54218	54226	54228	54228	Myra	466	“ That would ensure our common ruin , ”
54230	54269	54271	54271	Myra	466	“ No ; I will never embarrass you with a sister . You can only just subsist ; for you could not well live in a garret , except at the Rodneys ’ . I see my way , ”
54273	54354	54355	54355	she	466	“ I have long meditated over this — I can draw , I can sing , I can speak many tongues : I ought to be able to get food and clothing ; I may get something more . And I shall always be content ; for I shall always be thinking of you . However humble even my lot , if my will is concentrated on one purpose , it must ultimately effect it . That is my creed , ”
54358	54413	54355	54355	she	466	“ and I hold it fervently . I will stay with these dear people for a little while . They are not exactly the family on which I ought to trespass . But never mind . You will be a great man some day , Endymion , and you will remember the good Penruddocks . ”
54971	54983	54984	54984	he	469	“ It will be ready for those who come after me , ”
55412	55420	55421	55421	he	469	“ So you are a little frightened , ”
55446	55463	55430	55430	he	469	“ I will do what you wish , but I see through you and everybody else . ”
55464	55497	55430	55430	he	469	“ So you are a little frightened . Well ; we City men must see what we can do against the dukes . You may put me down for double his amount . ”
55921	55933	55891	55891	he	471	“ Business gives one an appetite ; eh , Mr. Trodgits ? ”
55998	56005	56006	56006	Adrian	471	“ Turtle makes all men equal , ”
56010	56047	56006	56006	Adrian	471	“ Our friend Trodgits seemed a little embarrassed at first , when I introduced him to the Right Honourable ; but when they sate next each other at dinner , they soon got on very well . ”
56078	56086	56088	56088	Adrian	471	“ I see no harm in it , ”
56090	56147	56088	56088	Adrian	471	“ but I like women to have their way about religion . And you may go to the stables and see the horses , and that might take up the morning . And then there are the houses ; they will amuse you . For my part , I am for a stroll in the forest ; ”
56179	56208	56150	56150	he	471	“ Pretty , is it not ? But then they say this place is not fashionable . It will do , I think , for us City men . ”
56649	56694	56630	56630	she	476	“ I see M. Arago and M. Mignet have arrived here , Adrian . Do not you think we ought to invite them here ? And then you might ask Mr. Macaulay to meet them . You said you wished to ask Mr. Macaulay . ”
57207	57217	57219	57219	Adriana	481	“ What do you think of her , mamma ? ”
57241	57249	57226	57226	she	481	“ I think her manners are perfect , ”
57254	57301	57251	57252	Mrs. Neuchatel	476	“ and as there can be no doubt , after all we have heard , of her principles , I think we are most fortunate . But what do you think of her , Adriana ? For , after all , that is the main question . ”
57302	57309	57311	57311	Adriana	481	“ I think she is divine , ”
57313	57322	57311	57311	Adriana	481	“ but I fear she has no heart . ”
57323	57340	57251	57252	Mrs. Neuchatel	476	“ And why ? Surely it is early to decide on such a matter as that ! ”
57341	57350	57352	57352	Adriana	481	“ When I took her to her room , ”
57354	57398	57352	57352	Adriana	481	“ I suppose I was nervous ; but I burst into tears , and threw my arms round her neck and embraced her , but she did not respond . She touched my forehead with her lips , and withdrew from my embrace . ”
57399	57413	57415	57416	Mrs. Neuchatel	476	“ She wished , perhaps , to teach you to control your emotions , ”
57418	57439	57415	57416	Mrs. Neuchatel	476	“ You have known her only an hour , and you could not have done more to your own mother . ”
57700	57722	57680	57681	Mr. Penruddock	390	“ The lime - tree abounds in our village , and there is nothing the bees love more than its blossoms . ”
57756	57764	57766	57767	Mr. Penruddock	390	“ Oh ! we do pretty well , ”
57769	57784	57766	57767	Mr. Penruddock	390	“ But how can a family live on ten or twelve shillings a week ? ”
57789	57794	57796	57797	Mr. Penruddock	390	“ There it is , ”
57799	57815	57796	57797	Mr. Penruddock	390	“ A family has more than that . With a family the income proportionately increases . ”
57820	57825	57826	57826	she	476	“ I must say , ”
57829	57900	57826	57826	she	476	“ I can not help feeling there is something wrong in our present arrangements . When I sit down to dinner every day , with all these dishes , and remember that there are millions who never taste meat , I can not resist the conviction that it would be better if there were some equal division , and all should have , if not much , at least something . ”
57901	57906	57908	57909	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ Nonsense , Emily ! ”
57934	57952	57953	57953	he	469	“ My wife , Mr. Penruddock , is a regular Communist . I hope you are not , ”
57964	57973	57975	57975	Myra	466	“ I think life would be very insipid , ”
57977	57986	57975	57975	Myra	466	“ if all our lots were the same . ”
58049	58064	58066	58067	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ Well , I do not think there is much to be afraid of , ”
58069	58196	58197	58197	he	469	“ This is a liberal age , and you can not go against it . The people must be educated , and where are the funds to come from ? We must all do something , and the Church must contribute its share . You know I am a Liberal , but I am not for any rash courses . I am not at all sorry that Sir Robert Peel gained so much at the last general election . I like parties to be balanced . I am quite content with affairs . My friends , the Liberals , are in office , and , being there , they can do very little . That is the state of things , is it not , Melchior ? ”
58211	58269	58197	58197	he	469	“ A balanced state of parties , and the house of Neuchatel with three votes — that will do . We poor City men get a little attention paid to us now , but before the dissolution three votes went for nothing . Now , shall we go and ask my daughter to give us a song ? ”
58324	58334	58335	58335	he	469	“ It is a little awkward the first day , ”
58338	58576	58335	58335	he	469	“ among strangers , but that will wear off . You must bring your mind to feel that this is your home , and we shall all of us do everything in our power to convince you of it . Mr. Penruddock mentioned to me your wish , under present circumstances , to enter as little as possible into society , and this is a very social house . Your feeling is natural , and you will be in this matter entirely your own mistress . We shall always be glad to see you , but if you are not present we shall know and respect the cause . For my own part , I am one of those who would rather cherish affection than indulge grief , but every one must follow their mood . I hear you have a brother , to whom you are much attached ; a twin , too , and they tell me strongly resembling you . He is in a public office , I believe ? Now , understand this ; your brother can come here whenever he likes , without any further invitation . Ask him whenever you please . We shall always be glad to see him . No sort of notice is necessary . This is not a very small house , and we can always manage to find a bed and a cutlet for a friend . ”
58605	58611	58335	58335	he	469	“ got out of that hole ”
58846	58862	58863	58863	he	2717	“ She has more common sense than any woman I ever knew , and more , ”
58867	58914	58863	58863	he	2717	“ than most men . If she were not so handsome , people would find it out ; but they can not understand that so beautiful a woman can have a headpiece , that , I really believe , could manage the affairs in Bishopsgate Street . ”
58949	58993	58944	58945	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ I really must have a quiet day that Miss Ferrars may dine with us , and she shall ask her brother . How glad I shall be when she goes into half - mourning ! I scarcely catch a glimpse of her . ”
59029	59044	59017	59017	he	469	“ If it had not been for me she would not have been here . ”
59063	59072	59074	59074	Myra	485	“ It does not look like a cell , ”
59104	59131	59074	59074	Myra	485	“ besides , there is no reason why you should be a prisoner . You have not lost a father , and I hope never will . ”
59132	59135	59137	59137	Adriana	481	“ Amen ! ”
59139	59151	59137	59137	Adriana	481	“ that would indeed be the unhappiest day of my life . ”
59152	59169	59171	59171	Myra	485	“ You can not be in society too much in the latter part of the day , ”
59173	59200	59201	59201	she	485	“ The mornings should be sacred to ourselves , but for the rest of the hours people are to see and to be seen , and , ”
59204	59211	59201	59201	she	485	“ to like and be liked . ”
59217	59230	59212	59212	Adriana	481	“ I do not wish any one to like me but you . ”
59231	59245	59247	59247	Myra	485	“ I am sure I shall always like you , and love you , ”
59249	59266	59247	59247	Myra	485	“ but I am equally sure that a great many other people will do the same . ”
59267	59279	59281	59281	Adriana	481	“ It will not be myself that they like or love , ”
59286	59430	59281	59281	Adriana	481	“ Now , spare me that vein , dear Adriana ; you know I do not like it . It is not agreeable , and I do not think it is true . I believe that women are loved much more for themselves than is supposed . Besides , a woman should be content if she is loved ; that is the point ; and she is not to inquire how far the accidents of life have contributed to the result . Why should you not be loved for yourself ? You have an interesting appearance . I think you very pretty . You have choice accomplishments and agreeable conversation and the sweetest temper in the world . You want a little self - conceit , my dear . If I were you and admired , I should never think of my fortune . ”
59431	59461	59281	59281	Adriana	481	“ If you were the greatest heiress in the world , Myra , and were married , nobody would suppose for a moment that it was for your fortune . ”
59462	59509	59281	59281	Adriana	481	“ Go down to dinner and smile upon everybody , and tell me about your conquests to - morrow . And say to your dear papa , that as he is so kind as to wish to see me , I will join them after dinner . ”
59886	59966	59882	59883	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ There are a few gentlemen coming to dine here to - day whom you know , with one exception . He is a young man , a very nice young fellow . I have seen a good deal of him of late on business in the City , and have taken a fancy to him . He is a foreigner , but he was partly educated in this country and speaks English as well as any of us . ”
59967	59977	59979	59980	Mrs. Neuchatel	476	“ Then I suppose he is not a Frenchman , ”
59982	59989	59979	59980	Mrs. Neuchatel	476	“ for they never speak English . ”
59990	60041	59882	59883	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ I shall not say what he is . You must all find out ; I dare say Miss Ferrars will discover him ; but , remember , you must all of you pay him great attention , for he is not a common person , I can assure you . ”
60042	60049	60051	60052	his wife	1261	“ You are mysterious , Adrian , ”
60054	60061	60051	60052	his wife	1261	“ and quite pique our curiosity . ”
60062	60072	60074	60075	the banker	2745	“ Well , I wish somebody would pique mine , ”
60077	60116	60074	60075	the banker	2745	“ These holidays in the City are terrible things . I think I will go after breakfast and look at the new house , and I dare say Miss Ferrars will be kind enough to be my companion . ”
60225	60240	60242	60242	he	2745	“ You have arrived just in time to take Mrs. Neuchatel in to dinner , ”
60695	60716	60692	60692	He	2763	“ I have been puzzling myself all dinner , but I can not help feeling that we have met before . ”
60724	60731	60719	60719	her	466	“ I think that is impossible . ”
60732	60735	60737	60738	the colonel	2462	“ Well , ”
60750	60764	60766	60766	he	2763	“ I suppose then it was a dream . May dreams so delightful , ”
60769	60774	60766	60766	he	2763	“ never be wanting ! ”
60775	60786	60788	60789	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ So you think he is a poet , Emily , ”
60796	60822	60788	60789	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ We have got a good many of his papers in Bishopsgate Street , but I have not met with any verses in them yet . ”
60854	60861	60862	60862	he	2763	“ He knows very few people , ”
60866	61069	60862	60862	he	2763	“ and I wish him to make some friends . Poor young fellow : he has had rather a hard life of it , and seen some service for such a youth . He is a perfect gentleman , and if he be a poet , Emily , that is all in your way . You like literary people , and are always begging that I should ask them . Well , next Saturday you will have a sort of a lion — one of the principal writers in ‘ Scaramouch . ’ He is going to Paris as the foreign correspondent of the ‘ Chuck - Farthing , ’ with a thousand a year , and one of my friends in the Stock Exchange , who is his great ally , asked me to give him some letters . So he came to Bishopsgate Street — they all come to Bishopsgate Street — and I asked him to dine here on Saturday . By the by , Miss Ferrars , ask your brother to come on the same day and stay with us till Monday . I will take him up to town with me quite in time for his office . ”
61156	61165	61166	61166	she	466	“ It is no part of my salary , ”
61176	61239	61166	61166	she	466	“ Mr. Neuchatel said he gave it to me for outfit and to buy gloves . But being in mourning I want to buy nothing , and you , dear darling , must have many wants . Besides , Mrs. Neuchatel has made me so many presents that I really do not think that I shall ever want to buy anything again . ”
61385	61394	61396	61397	the banker	2745	“ Here is one of our greatest wits , ”
61399	61414	61396	61397	the banker	2745	“ and he is going to Paris , which is the capital of wits . ”
61573	61576	61567	61567	Their	2794	“ shop : ”
61664	61672	61673	61673	he	428	“ Only think of our meeting here ! ”
61676	61704	61705	61705	he	428	“ I wonder why they asked you . You are not going to Paris , and you are not a wit . What a family this is ! ”
61708	61769	61770	61770	he	428	“ I had no idea of wealth before ! Did you observe the silver plate ? I could not hold mine with one hand , it was so heavy . I do not suppose there are such plates in the world . It gives one an idea of the galleons and Anson ’s plunder . But they deserve their wealth , ”
61773	62287	61770	61770	he	428	“ nobody grudges it to them . I declare when I was eating that truffle , I felt a glow about my heart that , if it were not indigestion , I think must have been gratitude ; though that is an article I had not believed in . He is a wonderful man , that Neuchatel . If I had only known him a year ago ! I would have dedicated my novel to him . He is a sort of man who would have given you a cheque immediately . He would not have read it , to be sure , but what of that ? If you had dedicated it to a lord , the most he would have done would have been to ask you to dinner , and then perhaps cut up your work in one of the Quality reviews , and taken money for doing it out of our pockets ! Oh ! it ’s too horrid ! There are some topsawyers here to - day , Ferrars ! It would make Seymour Hicks ’ mouth water to be here . We should have had it in the papers , and he would have left us out of the list , and called us , etc . Now I dare say that ambassador has been blundering all his life , and yet there is something in that star and ribbon ; I do not know how you feel , but I could almost go down on my knees to him . And there is a cabinet minister ; well , we know what he is ; I have been squibbing him for these two years , and now that I meet him I feel like a snob . Oh ! there is an immense deal of superstition left in the world . I am glad they are going to the ladies . I am to be honoured by some conversation with the mistress of the house . She seems a first - rate woman , familiar with the glorious pages of a certain classic work , and my humble effusions . She praised one she thought I wrote , but between ourselves it was written by that fellow Seymour Hicks , who imitates me ; but I would not put her right , as dinner might have been announced every moment . But she is a great woman , sir,—wonderful eyes ! They are all great women here . I sat next to one of the daughters , or daughters - in - law , or nieces , I suppose . By Jove ! it was tierce and quart . If you had been there , you would have been run through in a moment . I had to show my art . Now they are rising . I should not be surprised if Mr. Neuchatel were to present me to some of the grandees . I believe them to be all impostors , but still it is pleasant to talk to a man with a star . “
62300	62313	62315	62315	Ye	2801	“ Byron wrote ; a silly line ; he should have written , “
62326	62509	62315	62315	Ye	2801	” St. Barbe was not disappointed in his hopes . It was an evening of glorious success for him . He had even the honour of sitting for a time by the side of Mrs. Neuchatel , and being full of good claret , he , as he phrased it , showed his paces ; that is to say , delivered himself of some sarcastic paradoxes duly blended with fulsome flattery . Later in the evening , he contrived to be presented both to the ambassador and the cabinet minister , and treated them as if they were demigods ; listened to them as if with an admiration which he vainly endeavoured to repress ; never spoke except to enforce and illustrate the views which they had condescended to intimate ; successfully conveyed to his excellency that he was conversing with an enthusiast for his exalted profession ; and to the minister that he had met an ardent sympathiser with his noble career . The ambassador was not dissatisfied with the impression he had made on one of the foreign correspondents of the “
62514	62531	62315	62315	Ye	2801	” and the minister flattered himself that both the literary and the graphic representations of himself in “
62533	62542	62543	62543	I	0	” might possibly for the future be mitigated . “
62551	62565	62543	62543	I	0	” said St. Barbe to Endymion , towards the close of the evening . “
62605	62610	62589	62589	One	6769	” he added thoughtfully . “
62835	62836	62824	62824	he	932	” “
62849	62855	62858	62858	he	932	” said Myra to Endymion . “
62903	63051	62895	62895	I	0	” On the following afternoon , Adriana , Myra , and Endymion took a long walk together in the forest . The green glades in the autumnal woods were inviting , and sometimes they stood before the vast form of some doddered oak . The air was fresh and the sun was bright . Adriana was always gay and happy in the company of her adored Myra , and her happiness and her gaiety were not diminished by the presence of Myra ’s brother . So it was a lively and pleasant walk . At the end of a long glade they observed a horseman followed by a groom approaching them . Endymion was some little way behind , gathering wild flowers for Adriana . Cantering along , the cavalier soon reached them , and then he suddenly pulled up his horse . It was Colonel Albert . “
63064	63072	63059	63059	me	0	” and he was by their side . “
63082	63087	63073	63073	I	0	” said Colonel Albert . “
63096	63097	63088	63090	Two wandering nymphs	2819	” “
63103	63107	63088	63090	Two wandering nymphs	2819	” said Adriana , “
63151	63193	63140	63141	Colonel Albert	466	” So they turned , and Endymion with his graceful offering in a moment met them . Full of his successful quest , he offered with eager triumph the flowers to Adriana , without casting a glance at her new companion . “
63196	63209	63140	63141	Colonel Albert	466	” exclaimed Adriana , and she stopped to admire and arrange them . “
63230	63295	63140	63141	Colonel Albert	466	” Myra took the flower and examined it . Colonel Albert , who was silent , was watching all this time Endymion with intentness , who now looked up and encountered the gaze of the new comer . Their eyes met , their countenances were agitated , they seemed perplexed , and then it seemed that at the same time both extended their hands . “
63305	63369	63140	63141	Colonel Albert	466	” said Colonel Albert , and he retained the hand of Endymion with affection . But Endymion , who was apparently much moved , said nothing , or rather only murmured an echo to the remarks of his new friend . And then they all walked on , but Myra fell a little back and made a signal to Endymion to join her . “
63383	63384	63385	63386	Colonel Albert	466	” “
63388	63400	63385	63386	Colonel Albert	466	” said Endymion , looking amazed , and then he added , “
63406	63407	63408	63409	That gentleman	1654	” “
63413	63417	63408	63409	That gentleman	1654	” said Myra . “
63432	63433	63420	63422	the Count of	2827	” “
63439	63709	63434	63437	The Count of Otranto	2828	” Colonel Albert from this day became an object of increased and deeper interest to Myra . His appearance and manners had always been attractive , and the mystery connected with him was not calculated to diminish curiosity in his conduct or fate . But when she discovered that he was the unseen hero of her childhood , the being who had been kind to her Endymion in what she had ever considered the severest trial of her brother ’s life , had been his protector from those who would have oppressed him , and had cherished him in the desolate hour of his delicate and tender boyhood , her heart was disturbed . How often had they talked together of the Count of Otranto , and how often had they wondered who he was ! His memory had been a delightful mystery to them in their Berkshire solitude , and Myra recalled with a secret smile the numberless and ingenious inquiries by which she had endeavoured to elicit from her brother some clue as to his friend , or to discover some detail which might guide her to a conclusion . Endymion had known nothing , and was clear always that the Count of Otranto must have been , and was , an English boy . And now the Count of Otranto called himself Colonel Albert , and though he persisted in speaking English , had admitted to Mrs. Neuchatel that he was a foreigner . Who was he ? She resolved , when she had an opportunity , to speak to the great banker on the subject . “
63717	63721	63714	63715	Mr. Neuchatel	469	” she said , “
63735	63736	63732	63733	Colonel Albert	466	” “
63741	63746	63732	63733	Colonel Albert	466	” said Mr. Neuchatel . “
63758	63762	63753	63753	he	425	” said Myra . “
63767	63772	63753	63753	he	425	” said Mr. Neuchatel . “
63782	63783	63777	63780	the Count of Otranto	2828	” “
63791	63796	63777	63780	the Count of Otranto	2828	” said Mr. Neuchatel . “
63804	63808	63800	63800	he	425	” asked Myra . “

63920	63924	63908	63908	his	2195	” asked Myra . “
63947	64047	63939	63939	I	0	” said Mr. Neuchatel , and Myra felt that she could pursue the theme no further . She expected that Endymion would in time be able to obtain this information , but it was not so . In their first private conversation after their meeting in the forest , Endymion had informed Colonel Albert that , though they had met now for the first time since his return , they had been for some time lodgers in London under the same roof . Colonel Albert smiled when Endymion told him this ; then falling into thought , he said ; “
64124	64560	64111	64111	I	0	” Parliament had been dissolved through the demise of the crown in the summer of this year ( 1837 ) , and London society had been prematurely broken up . Waldershare had left town early in July to secure his election , in which he was successful , with no intention of settling again in his old haunts till the meeting of the new House of Commons , which was to be in November . The Rodneys were away at some Kentish watering - place during August and September , exhibiting to an admiring world their exquisitely made dresses , and enjoying themselves amazingly at balls and assemblies at the public rooms . The resources of private society also were not closed to them . Mr. and Mrs. Gamme were also there and gave immense dinners , and the airy Mrs. Hooghley , who laughed a little at the Gammes ’ substantial gatherings and herself improvised charming pic - nics . So there was really little embarrassment in the social relations between Colonel Albert and Endymion . They resolved themselves chiefly into arranging joint expeditions to Hainault . Endymion had a perpetual invitation there , and it seemed that the transactions between Mr. Neuchatel and the colonel required much conference , for the banker always expected him , although it was well known that they met not unfrequently in Bishopsgate Street in the course of the week . Colonel Albert and Endymion always stayed at Hainault from Saturday till Monday . It delighted the colonel to mount Endymion on one of his choice steeds , and his former fag enjoyed all this amazingly . Colonel Albert became domiciled at Hainault . The rooms which were occupied by him when there were always reserved for him . He had a general invitation , and might leave his luggage and books and papers behind him . It was evident that the family pleased him . Between Mr. Neuchatel and himself there were obviously affairs of great interest ; but it was equally clear that he liked the female members of the family — all of them ; and all liked him . And yet it can not be said that he was entertaining , but there are some silent people who are more interesting than the best talkers . And when he did speak he always said the right thing . His manners were tender and gentle ; he had an unobtrusive sympathy with all they said or did , except , indeed , and that was not rarely , when he was lost in profound abstraction . “

65027	65198	65002	65003	Miss Ferrars	482	” The friend of Colonel Albert was Baron Sergius , the baron who used to visit him in London at twilight in a dark brougham . Mrs. Neuchatel was greatly taken by his appearance , by the calmness of his mien , his unstudied politeness , and his measured voice . He conversed with her entirely at dinner on German philosophy , of which he seemed a complete master , explained to her the different schools , and probably the successful ones , and imparted to her that precise knowledge which she required on the subject , and which she had otherwise been unable to obtain . It seemed , too , that he personally knew all the famous professors , and he intimated their doctrines not only with profound criticism , but described their persons and habits with vividness and picturesque power , never , however , all this time , by any chance raising his voice , the tones of which were ever distinct and a little precise . “
65211	65218	65002	65003	Miss Ferrars	482	” asked Myra of Colonel Albert . “

65652	65737	65636	65637	The baron	1176	” So they went upstairs . There was a packet on the table , which seemed to catch the colonel ’s eye immediately , and he at once opened it with eagerness . It contained many foreign newspapers . Without waiting for the servant who was about to bring candles , the colonel lighted a taper on the table with a lucifer , and then withdrew into the adjoining chamber , opening , however , with folding doors to the principal and spacious apartment . “
65746	65755	65636	65637	The baron	1176	” said the baron , taking his coffee . “

66350	66531	66532	66533	new member	2927	” With the assembling of parliament in November recommenced the sittings of the Union Society , of which Endymion had for some time been a member , and of whose meetings he was a constant and critical , though silent , attendant . There was a debate one night on the government of dependencies , which , although all reference to existing political circumstances was rigidly prohibited , no doubt had its origin in the critical state of one of our most important colonies , then much embarrassing the metropolis . The subject was one which Endymion had considered , and on which he had arrived at certain conclusions . The meeting was fully attended , and the debate had been conducted with a gravity becoming the theme . Endymion was sitting on a back bench , and with no companion near him with whom he was acquainted , when he rose and solicited the attention of the president . Another and a well - known speaker had also risen , and been called , but there was a cry of “
66535	66585	66532	66533	new member	2927	” a courteous cry , borrowed from the House of Commons , and Endymion for the first time heard his own voice in public . He has since admitted , though he has been through many trying scenes , that it was the most nervous moment of his life . “
66589	66596	66532	66533	new member	2927	” as a wise wit said , “
66600	66685	66532	66533	new member	2927	” and the first time a man speaks in public , even if only at a debating society , is also the unequalled incident in its way . The indulgence of the audience supported him while the mist cleared from his vision , and his palpitating heart subsided into comparative tranquillity . After a few pardonable incoherencies , he was launched into his subject , and spoke with the thoughtful fluency which knowledge alone can sustain . For knowledge is the foundation of eloquence . “
66694	66726	66728	66728	he	2928	” whispered Mr. Bertie Tremaine to his brother Mr. Tremaine Bertie . The Bertie Tremaines were the two greatest swells of the Union , and had a party of their own . “
66732	66733	66728	66728	he	2928	” “
66738	66748	66736	66736	he	2928	” inquired Mr. Tremaine Bertie of their other neighbour . “
66766	66771	66751	66755	a clerk in the Treasury	2929	” was the reply . “
66783	66789	66790	66790	He	2928	” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine . “
66810	66982	66797	66797	I	0	” Accordingly , Mr. Bertie Tremaine , who was always playing at politics , and who , being two - and - twenty , was discontented he was not Chancellor of the Exchequer like Mr. Pitt , whispered to a gentleman who sate behind him , and was , in short , the whip of his section , and signified , as a minister of state would , that an introduction to Mr. Ferrars should be arranged . So when the meeting broke up , of which Mr. Ferrars ’ maiden speech was quite the event , and while he was contemplating , not without some fair self - complacency , walking home with Trenchard , Endymion found himself encompassed by a group of bowing forms and smiling countenances , and , almost before he was aware of it , had made the acquaintance of the great Mr. Bertie Tremaine , and received not only the congratulations of that gentleman , but an invitation to dine with him on the morrow ; “
66987	67709	67711	67711	he	2933	” Mr. Bertie Tremaine , who had early succeeded to the family estate , lived in Grosvenor Street , and in becoming style . His house was furnished with luxury and some taste . The host received his guests in a library , well stored with political history and political science , and adorned with the busts of celebrated statesmen and of profound political sages . Bentham was the philosopher then affected by young gentleman of ambition , and who wished to have credit for profundity and hard heads . Mr. Bertie Tremaine had been the proprietor of a close borough , which for several generations had returned his family to parliament , the faithful supporters of Pitt , and Perceval , and Liverpool , and he had contemplated following the same line , though with larger and higher objects than his ancestors . Being a man of considerable and versatile ability , and of ample fortune , with the hereditary opportunity which he possessed , he had a right to aspire , and , as his vanity more than equalled his talents , his estimate of his own career was not mean . Unfortunately , before he left Harrow , he was deprived of his borough , and this catastrophe eventually occasioned a considerable change in the views and conduct of Mr. Bertie Tremaine . In the confusion of parties and political thought which followed the Reform Act of Lord Grey , an attempt to govern the country by the assertion of abstract principles , and which it was now beginning to be the fashion to call Liberalism , seemed the only opening to public life ; and Mr. Bertie Tremaine , who piqued himself on recognising the spirit of the age , adopted Liberal opinions with that youthful fervour which is sometimes called enthusiasm , but which is a heat of imagination subsequently discovered to be inconsistent with the experience of actual life . At Cambridge Mr. Bertie Tremaine was at first the solitary pupil of Bentham , whose principles he was prepared to carry to their extreme consequences , but being a man of energy and in possession of a good estate , he soon found followers , for the sympathies of youth are quick , and , even with an original bias , it is essentially mimetic . When Mr. Bertie Tremaine left the university he found in the miscellaneous elements of the London Union many of his former companions of school and college , and from them , and the new world to which he was introduced , it delighted him to form parties and construct imaginary cabinets . His brother Augustus , who was his junior only by a year , and was destined to be a diplomatist , was an efficient assistant in these enterprises , and was one of the guests who greeted Endymion when he arrived next day in Grosvenor Street according to his engagement . The other three were Hortensius , the whip of the party , and Mr. Trenchard . The dinner was refined , for Mr. Bertie Tremaine combined the Sybarite with the Utilitarian sage , and it secretly delighted him to astonish or embarrass an austere brother republican by the splendour of his family plate or the polished appointments of his household . To - day the individual to be influenced was Endymion , and the host , acting up to his ideal of a first minister , addressed questions to his companions on the subjects which were peculiarly their own , and , after eliciting their remarks , continued to complete the treatment of the theme with adequate ability , though in a manner authoritative , and , as Endymion thought , a little pompous . What amused him most in this assemblage of youth was their earnest affectation of public life . The freedom of their comments on others was only equalled by their confidence in themselves . Endymion , who only spoke when he was appealed to , had casually remarked in answer to one of the observations which his host with elaborate politeness occasionally addressed to him , that he thought it was unpatriotic to take a certain course . Mr. Bertie Tremaine immediately drew up , and said , with a deep smile , “
67724	67997	67998	67998	I	0	” and thereupon delivered himself of an address on the subject which might have been made in the Union , and which communicated to the astonished Endymion that patriotism was a false idea , and entirely repugnant to the principles of the new philosophy . As all present were more or less impregnated with these tenets , there was no controversy on the matter . Endymion remained discreetly silent , and Augustus — Mr. Bertie Tremaine ’s brother — who sate next to him , and whose manners were as sympathising as his brother ’s were autocratic , whispered in a wheedling tone that it was quite true , and that the idea of patriotism was entirely relinquished except by a few old - fashioned folks who clung to superstitious phrases . Hortensius , who seemed to be the only one of the company who presumed to meet Mr. Bertie Tremaine in conversation on equal terms , and who had already astonished Endymion by what that inexperienced youth deemed the extreme laxity of his views , both social and political , evinced , more than once , a disposition to deviate into the lighter topics of feminine character , and even the fortunes of the hazard - table ; but the host looked severe , and was evidently resolved that the conversation to - day should resemble the expression of his countenance . After dinner they returned to the library , and most of them smoked , but Mr. Bertie Tremaine , inviting Endymion to seat himself by his side on a sofa at the farther end of the room , observed , “
68006	68007	68000	68000	you	2934	” “
68015	68022	68010	68010	I	0	” said the somewhat startled Endymion ; “

68657	68664	68648	68648	He	427	” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine musingly ; “

68728	69368	68719	68719	he	427	” When parliament reassembled in February , the Neuchatels quitted Hainault for their London residence in Portland Place . Mrs. Neuchatel was sadly troubled at leaving her country home , which , notwithstanding its distressing splendour , had still some forms of compensatory innocence in its flowers and sylvan glades . Adriana sighed when she called to mind the manifold and mortifying snares and pitfalls that awaited her , and had even framed a highly practical and sensible scheme which would permit her parents to settle in town and allow Myra and herself to remain permanently in the country ; but Myra brushed away the project like a fly , and Adriana yielding , embraced her with tearful eyes . The Neuchatel mansion in Portland Place was one of the noblest in that comely quarter of the town , and replete with every charm and convenience that wealth and taste could provide . Myra , who , like her brother , had a tenacious memory , was interested in recalling as fully and as accurately as possible her previous experience of London life . She was then indeed only a child , but a child who was often admitted to brilliant circles , and had enjoyed opportunities of social observation which the very youthful seldom possess . Her retrospection was not as profitable as she could have desired , and she was astonished , after a severe analysis of the past , to find how entirely at that early age she appeared to have been engrossed with herself and with Endymion . Hill Street and Wimbledon , and all their various life , figured as shadowy scenes ; she could realise nothing very definite for her present guidance ; the past seemed a phantom of fine dresses , and bright equipages , and endless indulgence . All that had happened after their fall was distinct and full of meaning . It would seem that adversity had taught Myra to feel and think . Forty years ago the great financiers had not that commanding , not to say predominant , position in society which they possess at present , but the Neuchatels were an exception to this general condition . They were a family which not only had the art of accumulating wealth , but of expending it with taste and generosity — an extremely rare combination . Their great riches , their political influence , their high integrity and their social accomplishments , combined to render their house not only splendid , but interesting and agreeable , and gave them a great hold upon the world . At first the fine ladies of their political party called on them as a homage of condescending gratitude for the public support which the Neuchatel family gave to their sons and husbands , but they soon discovered that this amiable descent from their Olympian heights on their part did not amount exactly to the sacrifice or service which they had contemplated . They found their host as refined as themselves , and much more magnificent , and in a very short time it was not merely the wives of ambassadors and ministers of state that were found at the garden fetes of Hainault , or the balls , and banquets , and concerts of Portland Place , but the fitful and capricious realm of fashion surrendered like a fair country conquered as it were by surprise . To visit the Neuchatels became the mode ; all solicited to be their guests , and some solicited in vain . Although it was only February , the world began to move , and some of the ministers ’ wives , who were socially strong enough to venture on such a step , received their friends . Mr. Neuchatel particularly liked this form of society . “
69375	69381	68719	68719	he	427	” he used to say , “
69446	69783	69817	69817	I	0	” Myra , faithful to her original resolution , not to enter society while she was in mourning , declined all the solicitudes of her friends to accompany them to these assemblies . Mrs. Neuchatel always wished Myra should be her substitute , and it was only at Myra ’s instance that Adriana accompanied her parents . In the meantime , Myra saw much of Endymion . He was always a welcome guest by the family , and could call upon his sister at all the odds and ends of time that were at his command , and chat with her at pleasant ease in her pretty room . Sometimes they walked out together , and sometimes they went together to see some exhibition that everybody went to see . Adriana became almost as intimate with Endymion as his sister , and altogether the Neuchatel family became by degrees to him as a kind of home . Talking with Endymion , Myra heard a good deal of Colonel Albert , for he was her brother ’s hero — but she rarely saw that gentleman . She was aware from her brother , and from some occasional words of Mr. Neuchatel , that the great banker still saw Colonel Albert and not unfrequently , but the change of residence from Hainault to London made a difference in their mode of communication . Business was transacted in Bishopsgate Street , and no longer combined with a pleasant ride to an Essex forest . More than once Colonel Albert had dined in Portland Place , but at irregular and miscellaneous parties . Myra observed that he was never asked to meet the grand personages who attended the celebrated banquets of Mr. Neuchatel . And why not ? His manners were distinguished , but his whole bearing that of one accustomed to consideration . The irrepressible curiosity of woman impelled her once to feel her way on the subject with Mr. Neuchatel , but with the utmost dexterity and delicacy . “
69786	69816	69817	69817	I	0	” said Mr. Neuchatel with a laughing eye , and who saw through everybody ’s purpose , though his own manner was one of simplicity amounting almost to innocence , “
69901	69910	69925	69926	Miss Ferrars	482	” added Mr. Neuchatel with a merry smile , “
69937	69938	69925	69926	Miss Ferrars	482	” “
69946	69952	69953	69954	Colonel Albert	466	” asked Myra with decision . “
69969	69974	69975	69975	he	0	” replied Mr. Neuchatel ; “
70025	70383	70384	70384	Your	2989	” Miss Ferrars did not pursue the inquiry , for she was sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Neuchatel to feel that he did not intend to gratify her curiosity . The banquet of the Neuchatels to the premier , and some of the principal ambassadors and their wives , and to those of the premier ’s colleagues who were fashionable enough to be asked , and to some of the dukes and duchesses and other ethereal beings who supported the ministry , was the first event of the season . The table blazed with rare flowers and rarer porcelain and precious candelabra of sculptured beauty glittering with light ; the gold plate was less remarkable than the delicate ware that had been alike moulded and adorned for a Du Barri or a Marie Antoinette , and which now found a permanent and peaceful home in the proverbial land of purity and order ; and amid the stars and ribbons , not the least remarkable feature of the whole was Mr. Neuchatel himself , seated at the centre of his table , alike free from ostentation or over - deference , talking to the great ladies on each side of him , as if he had nothing to do in life but whisper in gentle ears , and partaking of his own dainties as if he were eating bread and cheese at a country inn . Perhaps Mrs. Neuchatel might have afforded a companion picture . Partly in deference to their host , and partly because this evening the first dance of the season was to be given , the great ladies in general wore their diamonds , and Myra was amused as she watched their dazzling tiaras and flashing rivieres , while not a single ornament adorned the graceful presence of their hostess , who was more content to be brilliant only by her conversation . As Mr. Neuchatel had only a few days before presented his wife with another diamond necklace , he might be excused were he slightly annoyed . Nothing of the sort ; he only shrugged his shoulders , and said to his nephew , “
70412	70605	70401	70401	she	2990	” The sole ornament of Adriana was an orchid , which had arrived that morning from Hainault , and she had presented its fellow to Myra . There was one lady who much attracted the attention of Myra , interested in all she observed . This lady was evidently a person of importance , for she sate between an ambassador and a knight of the garter , and they vied in homage to her . They watched her every word , and seemed delighted with all she said . Without being strictly beautiful , there was an expression of sweet animation in her physiognomy which was highly attractive : her eye was full of summer lightning , and there was an arch dimple in her smile , which seemed to irradiate her whole countenance . She was quite a young woman , hardly older than Myra . What most distinguished her was the harmony of her whole person ; her graceful figure , her fair and finely moulded shoulders , her pretty teeth , and her small extremities , seemed to blend with and become the soft vivacity of her winning glance . “
70614	70621	70606	70607	Lady Montfort	499	” said the neighbour of Myra . “
70638	70639	70635	70635	her	499	” “
70659	70703	70635	70635	her	499	” In the evening , a great lady , who was held to have the finest voice in society , favoured them with a splendid specimen of her commanding skill , and then Adriana was induced to gratify her friends with a song , “
70708	70887	70635	70635	her	499	” and that only on condition that Myra should accompany her . Miss Neuchatel had a sweet and tender voice , and it had been finely cultivated ; she would have been more than charming if she had only taken interest in anything she herself did , or believed for a moment that she could interest others . When she ceased , a gentleman approached the instrument and addressed her in terms of sympathy and deferential praise . Myra recognised the knight of the garter who had sat next to Lady Montfort . He was somewhat advanced in middle life , tall and of a stately presence , with a voice more musical even than the tones which had recently enchanted every one . His countenance was impressive , a truly Olympian brow , but the lower part of the face indicated not feebleness , but flexibility , and his mouth was somewhat sensuous . His manner was at once winning ; natural , and singularly unaffected , and seemed to sympathise entirely with those whom he addressed . “
70896	70905	70889	70889	I	0	” said the gentleman , continuing a conversation , “
70926	70927	70917	70917	you	2995	” “
70933	70938	70917	70917	you	2995	” said Miss Ferrars ; “

70955	70960	70928	70928	Nightingales	2997	” asked the gentleman . “
70968	70972	70973	70973	You	0	” said Myra . “

70988	71012	70982	70982	she	502	” said the gentleman , for in truth Miss Neuchatel , though he had frequently addressed her , had scarcely opened her lips . “
71019	71031	71032	71032	Adriana	481	” said Miss Ferrars , trying to force her to converse . “
71034	71039	71032	71032	Adriana	481	” said the gentleman . “

71064	71068	71055	71058	a bride of Venice	2999	” said Myra ; “

71087	71108	71082	71082	you	2995	” asked the gentleman . There was a pause , and then Miss Neuchatel , with an effort , murmured , “
71121	71122	71123	71123	She	481	” “
71129	71134	71123	71123	She	481	” said the gentleman . “
71143	71153	71136	71136	you	3002	” said Mr. Neuchatel , coming up to them . “

71189	71194	71186	71187	Fortunate man	3006	” said the gentleman . “

71255	71556	71245	71245	I	0	” The Earl of Roehampton was the strongest member of the government , except , of course , the premier himself . He was the man from whose combined force and flexibility of character the country had confidence that in all their councils there would be no lack of courage , yet tempered with adroit discretion . Lord Roehampton , though an Englishman , was an Irish peer , and was resolved to remain so , for he fully appreciated the position , which united social distinction with the power of a seat in the House of Commons . He was a very ambitious , and , as it was thought , worldly man , deemed even by many to be unscrupulous , and yet he was romantic . A great favourite in society , and especially with the softer sex , somewhat late in life , he had married suddenly a beautiful woman , who was without fortune , and not a member of the enchanted circle in which he flourished . The union had been successful , for Lord Roehampton was gifted with a sweet temper , and , though people said he had no heart , with a winning tenderness of disposition , or at least of manner , which at the same time charmed and soothed . He had been a widower for two years , and the world was of opinion that he ought to marry again , and form this time a becoming alliance . In addition to his many recommendations he had now the inestimable reputation , which no one had ever contemplated for him , of having been a good husband . Berengaria , Countess of Montfort , was a great friend of Lord Roehampton . She was accustomed to describe herself as “
71563	71779	71780	71780	He	3012	” and though Lord Roehampton read characters and purposes with a glance , and was too sagacious to be deceived by any one , even by himself , his gratified taste , for he scarcely had vanity , cherished the bright illusion of which he was conscious , and he responded to Lady Montfort half sportively , half seriously , with an air of flattered devotion . Lord Roehampton had inherited an ample estate , and he had generally been in office ; for he served his apprenticeship under Perceval and Liverpool , and changed his party just in time to become a member of the Cabinet of 1831 . Yet with all these advantages , whether it were the habit of his life , which was ever profuse , or that neglect of his private interests which almost inevitably accompanies the absorbing duties of public life , his affairs were always somewhat confused , and Lady Montfort , who wished to place him on a pinnacle , had resolved that he should marry an heiress . After long observation and careful inquiry and prolonged reflection , the lady she had fixed upon was Miss Neuchatel ; and she it was who had made Lord Roehampton cross the room and address Adriana after her song . “
71785	71792	71780	71780	He	3012	” reasoned Lady Montfort to herself , “
71933	72176	71906	71906	he	1264	” The plot being devised by a fertile brain never wanting in expedients , its development was skilfully managed , and its accomplishment anticipated with confidence . It was remarkable with what dexterity the Neuchatel family and Lord Roehampton were brought together . Berengaria ’s lord and master was in the country , which he said he would not quit ; but this did not prevent her giving delightful little dinners and holding select assemblies on nights when there was no dreadful House of Commons , and Lord Roehampton could be present . On most occasions , and especially on these latter ones , Lady Montfort could not endure existence without her dear Adriana . Mr. Neuchatel , who was a little in the plot , who at least smiled when Berengaria alluded to her enterprise , was not wanting in his contributions to its success . He hardly ever gave one of his famous banquets to which Lord Roehampton was not invited , and , strange to say , Lord Roehampton , who had the reputation of being somewhat difficult on this head , always accepted the invitations . The crowning social incident , however , was when Lord Roehampton opened his own house for the first time since his widowhood , and received the Neuchatels at a banquet not inferior to their own . This was a great triumph for Lady Montfort , who thought the end was at hand . “
72181	72190	71906	71906	he	1264	” she said to Lord Roehampton that evening . “
72199	72200	71906	71906	he	1264	” “

Waldershare had not taken his seat in the autumn session . After the general election , he had gone abroad with Lord Beaumaris , the young nobleman who had taken them to the Derby , and they had seen and done many strange things . During all their peregrinations , however , Waldershare maintained a constant correspondence with Imogene , occasionally sending her a choice volume , which she was not only to read , but to prove her perusal of it by forwarding to him a criticism of its contents . Endymion was too much pleased to meet Waldershare again , and told him of the kind of intimacy he had formed with Colonel Albert and all about the baron . Waldershare was much interested in these details , and it was arranged that an opportunity should be taken to make the colonel and Waldershare acquainted . This , however , was not an easy result to bring about , for Waldershare insisted on its not occurring formally , and as the colonel maintained the utmost reserve with the household , and Endymion had no room of reception , weeks passed over without Waldershare knowing more of Colonel Albert personally than sometimes occasionally seeing him mount his horse . In the meantime life in Warwick Street , so far as the Rodney family were concerned , appeared to have re - assumed its pleasant , and what perhaps we are authorised in styling its normal condition . They went to the play two or three times a week , and there Waldershare or Lord Beaumaris , frequently both , always joined them ; and then they came home to supper , and then they smoked ; and sometimes there was a little singing , and sometimes a little whist . Occasionally there was only conversation , that is to say , Waldershare held forth , dilating on some wondrous theme , full of historical anecdote , and dazzling paradox , and happy phrase . All listened with interest , even those who did not understand him . Much of his talk was addressed really to Beaumaris , whose mind he was forming , as well as that of Imogene . Beaumaris was an hereditary Whig , but had not personally committed himself , and the ambition of Waldershare was to transform him not only into a Tory , but one of the old rock , a real Jacobite . “
73416	73421	73412	73414	the Tory party	725	” Waldershare would exclaim , “
73540	73541	73538	73538	Canning	327	” “
73549	73575	73542	73542	I	0	” whispered Lord Beaumaris to Sylvia , who had really never heard of any of these gentlemen before , but looked most sweet and sympathetic . “

73599	73687	73594	73594	I	0	” One day , not very long after his return from his travels , Waldershare went to breakfast with his uncle , Mr. Sidney Wilton , now a cabinet minister , still unmarried , and living in Grosvenor Square . Notwithstanding the difference of their politics , an affectionate intimacy subsisted between them ; indeed Waldershare was a favourite of his uncle , who enjoyed the freshness of his mind , and quite appreciated his brilliancy of thought and speech , his quaint reading and effervescent imagination . “

As Waldershare was descending the staircase , he drew back on a landing - place to permit the prince to advance undisturbed .

76141	76163	76164	76164	I	0	” said Mr. Wilton frigidly , and as if , so far as he was concerned , the interview was ended . “
76172	76181	76118	76118	they	3195	” said Prince Florestan , speaking very slowly , “
76221	76222	76223	76223	I	0	” “
76247	76253	76255	76255	my	0	” said Mr. Wilton stiffly . “

76344	76352	76353	76353	I	0	” asked the prince with great calmness . “
76358	76394	76340	76340	he	3204	” said Mr. Wilton , taking up at the same time an opened letter which was before him , as if he wished to resume the private business on which he had been previously engaged , “
76408	76409	76396	76398	your royal highness	3206	” “

77018	77037	77038	77038	I	0	” said Mr. Wilton , and both himself and the prince seemed to rise at the same time . “
77048	77054	77040	77040	you	6912	” said his royal highness . “
77082	77163	77166	77167	my prince	3236	” The prince remounted his horse , and rode off quickly till he reached the Strand , where obstacles to rapid progress commenced , and though impatient , it was some time before he reached Bishopsgate Street . He entered the spacious courtyard of a noble mansion , and , giving his horse to the groom , inquired for Mr. Neuchatel , to whom he was at once ushered,—seated in a fine apartment at a table covered with many papers . “
77169	77178	77166	77167	my prince	3236	” said Mr. Neuchatel with a smiling eye , “
77199	77217	77193	77193	you	3236	” And then Prince Florestan gave Mr. Neuchatel a succinct but sufficient summary of his recent interview . “
77220	77225	77193	77193	you	3236	” said Mr. Neuchatel , “
77521	77608	77613	77613	Ferrars	482	” On the afternoon of this day there was a half - holiday at the office , and Endymion had engaged to accompany Waldershare on some expedition . They had been talking together in his room where Waldershare was finishing his careless toilette , which however was never finished , and they had just opened the house door and were sallying forth when Colonel Albert rode up . He gave a kind nod to Endymion , but did not speak , and the companions went on . “
77615	77627	77613	77613	Ferrars	482	” said Waldershare , pressing his arm and bubbling with excitement , “
77656	77943	77644	77644	I	0	” Endymion had now passed three years of his life in London , and considering the hard circumstances under which he had commenced this career , he might on the whole look back to those years without dissatisfaction . Three years ago he was poor and friendless , utterly ignorant of the world , and with nothing to guide him but his own good sense . His slender salary had not yet been increased , but with the generosity and aid of his sister and the liberality of Mr. Vigo , he was easy in his circumstances . Through the Rodneys , he had become acquainted with a certain sort of miscellaneous life , a knowledge of which is highly valuable to a youth , but which is seldom attained without risk . Endymion , on the contrary , was always guarded from danger . Through his most unexpected connection with the Neuchatel family , he had seen something of life in circles of refinement and high consideration , and had even caught glimpses of that great world of which he read so much and heard people talk more , the world of the Lord Roehamptons and the Lady Montforts , and all those dazzling people whose sayings and doings form the taste , and supply the conversation , and leaven the existence of admiring or wondering millions . None of these incidents , however , had induced any change in the scheme of his existence . Endymion was still content with his cleanly and airy garret ; still dined at Joe ’s ; was still sedulous at his office , and always popular with his fellow clerks . Seymour Hicks , indeed , who studied the “
77946	78243	77613	77613	Ferrars	482	” with intentness , had discovered the name of Endymion in the elaborate lists of attendants on Mrs. Neuchatel ’s receptions , and had duly notified the important event to his colleagues ; but Endymion was not severely bantered on the occasion , for , since the withdrawal of St. Barbe from the bureau , the stock of envy at Somerset House was sensibly diminished . His lodging at the Rodneys ’ , however , had brought Endymion something more valuable than an innocuous familiarity with their various and suggestive life . In the friendship of Waldershare he found a rich compensation for being withdrawn from his school and deprived of his university . The care of his father had made Endymion a good classical scholar , and he had realised a degree of culture which it delighted the brilliant and eccentric Waldershare to enrich and to complete . Waldershare guided his opinions , and directed his studies , and formed his taste . Alone at night in his garret , there was no solitude , for he had always some book or some periodical , English or foreign , with which Waldershare had supplied him , and which he assured Endymion it was absolutely necessary that he should read and master . Nor was his acquaintance with Baron Sergius less valuable , or less fruitful of results . He too became interested in Endymion , and poured forth to him , apparently without reserve , all the treasures of his vast experience of men and things , especially with reference to the conduct of external affairs . He initiated him in the cardinal principles of the policies of different nations ; he revealed to him the real character of the chief actors in the scene . “
78248	78254	77613	77613	Ferrars	482	” Baron Sergius would say , “
78446	79044	79045	79045	Your	3269	” Nor must it be forgotten that his debating society and the acquaintance which he had formed there , were highly beneficial to Endymion . Under the roof of Mr. Bertie Tremaine he enjoyed the opportunity of forming an acquaintance with a large body of young men of breeding , of high education , and full of ambition , that was a substitute for the society , becoming his youth and station , which he had lost by not going to the university . With all these individuals , and with all their circles , Endymion was a favourite . No doubt his good looks , his mien — which was both cheerful and pensive — his graceful and quiet manners , all told in his favour , and gave him a good start , but further acquaintance always sustained the first impression . He was intelligent and well - informed , without any alarming originality , or too positive convictions . He listened not only with patience but with interest to all , and ever avoided controversy . Here are some of the elements of a man ’s popularity . What was his intellectual reach , and what his real character , it was difficult at this time to decide . He was still very young , only on the verge of his twentieth year ; and his character had no doubt been influenced , it might be suppressed , by the crushing misfortunes of his family . The influence of his sister was supreme over him . She had never reconciled herself to their fall . She had existed only on the solitary idea of regaining their position , and she had never omitted an occasion to impress upon him that he had a great mission , and that , aided by her devotion , he would fulfil it . What his own conviction on this subject was may be obscure . Perhaps he was organically of that cheerful and easy nature , which is content to enjoy the present , and not brood over the past . The future may throw light upon all these points ; at present it may be admitted that the three years of seemingly bitter and mortifying adversity have not been altogether wanting in beneficial elements in the formation of his character and the fashioning of his future life . Lady Montfort heard with great satisfaction from Mr. Neuchatel that Lord Roehampton was going to pay a visit to Hainault at Easter , and that he had asked himself . She playfully congratulated Mrs. Neuchatel on the subject , and spoke as if the affair was almost concluded . That lady , however , received the intimation with a serious , not to say distressed countenance . She said that she should be grieved to lose Adriana under any circumstances ; but if her marriage in time was a necessity , she trusted she might be united to some one who would not object to becoming a permanent inmate of their house . What she herself desired for her daughter was a union with some clergyman , and if possible , the rector of their own parish . But it was too charming a dream to realise . The rectory at Hainault was almost in the Park , and was the prettiest house in the world , with the most lovely garden . She herself much preferred it to the great mansion — and so on . Lady Montfort stared at her with impatient astonishment , and then said , “
79066	79067	79045	79045	Your	3269	” “
79073	79078	79045	79045	Your	3269	” said Mrs. Neuchatel , “

79552	79553	79535	79536	Mr. Neuchatel	469	” “
79564	79569	79570	79570	I	0	” said Lady Montfort ; “
79602	79636	79592	79592	you	0	” On this very afternoon , when Myra , who had been walking in Regent ’s Park with her brother , returned home , she found Adriana agitated , and really in tears . “
79644	79649	79650	79650	I	0	” inquired her friend . “
79655	79740	79650	79650	I	0	” sobbed Adriana , and then she told Myra that she had had a visit from Lady Montfort , and all that had occurred in it . Lady Montfort had absolutely congratulated her on her approaching alliance with Lord Roehampton , and when she altogether disclaimed it , and expressed her complete astonishment at the supposition , Lady Montfort had told her she was not justified in giving Lord Roehampton so much encouragement and trifling with a man of his high character and position . “
79749	79770	79771	79771	I	0	” exclaimed Adriana , and she threw her arms round the neck of the friend who was to console her . “
79777	79790	79771	79771	I	0	” said Myra , releasing herself with gentleness from her distressed friend . “

80577	80637	80644	80645	Miss Ferrars	482	” There was to be no great party at Hainault ; Lord Roehampton particularly wished that there should be no fine folks asked , and especially no ambassadors . All that he wanted was to enjoy the fresh air , and to ramble in the forest , of which he had heard so much , with the young ladies . “
80647	80652	80644	80645	Miss Ferrars	482	” said Mr. Neuchatel , “
80854	80855	80857	80857	I	0	” “

81061	81068	81069	81069	you	482	” he said , suddenly resuming , “

81777	81786	81768	81768	he	7235	” said Myra , gravely and rather sadly ; “

81814	81823	81825	81825	I	0	” said Mr. Neuchatel with his sweetest smile ; “
81831	82235	81828	81829	Miss Ferrars	482	” Affairs on the whole went on in a promising manner . The weather was delightful , and Lord Roehampton came down to Hainault just in time for dinner , the day after their arrival , and in the highest spirits . He seemed to be enjoying a real holiday ; body and mind were in a like state of expansion ; he was enchanted with the domain ; he was delighted with the mansion , everything pleased and gratified him , and he pleased and gratified everybody . The party consisted only of themselves , except one of the nephews , with whom indeed Lord Roehampton was already acquainted ; a lively youth , a little on the turf , not too much , and this suited Lord Roehampton , who was a statesman of the old aristocratic school , still bred horses , and sometimes ran one , and in the midst of an European crisis could spare an hour to Newmarket . Perhaps it was his only affectation . Mrs. Neuchatel , by whom he was seated , had the happy gift of conversation ; but the party was of that delightful dimension , that it permitted talk to be general . Myra sate next to Lord Roehampton , and he often addressed her . He was the soul of the feast , and yet it is difficult to describe his conversation ; it was a medley of graceful whim , interspersed now and then with a very short anecdote of a very famous person , or some deeply interesting reminiscence of some critical event . Every now and then he appealed to Adriana , who sate opposite to him in the round table , and she trusted that her irrepressible smiles would not be interpreted into undue encouragement . Lord Roehampton had no objection to meet Prince Florestan , provided there were no other strangers , and the incognito was observed . He rather welcomed the proposal , observing he liked to know public men personally ; so , you can judge of their calibre , which you never can do from books and newspapers , or the oral reports of their creatures or their enemies . And so on the next day Colonel Albert was expected . Lord Roehampton did not appear till luncheon ; he had received so many boxes from Downing Street which required his attention . “
82241	82245	82247	82247	I	0	” he said ; “
82278	82279	82266	82266	I	0	” “
82287	82292	82293	82294	Miss Ferrars	482	” said Mr. Neuchatel ; “
82299	82449	82293	82294	Miss Ferrars	482	” Then what was to be done after luncheon ? Would he ride , or would he drive ? And where should they drive and ride to ? But Lord Roehampton did not much care to drive , and was tired of riding . He would rather walk and ramble about Hainault . He wanted to see the place , and the forest and the fern , and perhaps hear one of those nightingales that they had talked of in Portland Place . But Mrs. Neuchatel did not care to walk , and Mr. Neuchatel , though it was a holiday in the City , had a great many letters to write , and so somehow or other it ended in Lord Roehampton and the two young ladies walking out together , and remaining so long and so late , that Mrs. Neuchatel absolutely contemplated postponing the dinner hour . “
82461	82465	82458	82459	Mrs. Neuchatel	476	” said Myra ; “
82503	82748	82482	82483	Lord Roehampton	499	” Colonel Albert , who had arrived , was presented to Lord Roehampton before dinner . Lord Roehampton received him with stately courtesy . As Myra watched , not without interest , the proceeding , she could scarcely believe , as she marked the lofty grace and somewhat haughty mien of Lord Roehampton , that it could be the same being of frolic and fancy , and even tender sentiment , with whom she had been passing the preceding hours . Colonel Albert sate next to Myra at dinner , and Lord Roehampton between Mrs. Neuchatel and her daughter . His manner was different to - day , not less pleased and pleasing , but certainly more restrained . He encouraged Mrs. Neuchatel to occupy the chief part in conversation , and whispered to Adriana , who became somewhat uneasy ; but the whispers mainly consisted of his delight in their morning adventures . When he remarked that it was one of the most agreeable days of his life , she became a little alarmed . Then he addressed Colonel Albert across the table , and said that he had heard from Mr. Neuchatel that the colonel had been in America , and asked some questions about public men , which brought him out . Colonel Albert answered with gentleness and modesty , never at any length , but in language which indicated , on all the matters referred to , thought and discrimination . “
82761	82766	82478	82479	a nightingale	3367	” said Lord Roehampton . “
82773	82778	82478	82479	a nightingale	3367	” said Colonel Albert . “

82867	82872	82840	82840	They	2955	” said the prince . “

82894	82899	82900	82901	the Americans	528	” said Lord Roehampton , “
82925	83024	82914	82914	They	528	” After dinner they had some music ; Lord Roehampton would not play whist . He insisted on comparing the voices of his companions with that of the nightingales of the morning . He talked a great deal to Adriana , and Colonel Albert , in the course of the evening much to Myra , and about her brother . Lord Roehampton more than once had wished to tell her , as he had already told Miss Neuchatel , how delightful had been their morning ; but on every occasion he had found her engaged with the colonel . “
83031	83048	83049	83049	He	3377	” he had observed to Mr. Neuchatel , as they came from the dining - room . “

83272	83273	83267	83267	she	482	” “
83276	83431	83267	83267	she	482	” said Lord Roehampton . The next day , after they had examined the famous stud and stables , there was a riding party , and in the evening Colonel Albert offered to perform some American conjuring tricks , of which he had been speaking in the course of the day . This was a most wonderful performance , and surprised and highly amused everybody . Colonel Albert was the last person who they expected would achieve such marvels ; he was so quiet , not to say grave . They could hardly credit that he was the same person as he poured floods of flowers over Myra from her own borrowed pocket - handkerchief , and without the slightest effort or embarrassment , robbed Lord Roehampton of his watch , and deposited it in Adriana ’s bosom . It was evident that he was a complete master of slight - of - hand . “
83434	83471	83267	83267	she	482	” murmured Lord Roehampton to himself . It was the day after this , that Myra being in the music room and alone , Lord Roehampton opened the door , looked in , and then said , “
83477	83478	83481	83481	she	502	” “
83487	83488	83479	83479	I	0	” “
83525	83526	83527	83527	I	0	” “
83540	83541	83533	83534	Lord Roehampton	499	” “
83550	83573	83533	83534	Lord Roehampton	499	” he said , as she left the room . They were soon on the terrace , but Adriana was not there . “
83579	83584	83585	83585	you	0	” said Lord Roehampton ; “
83624	83625	83620	83620	they	3392	” “
83632	83636	83620	83620	they	3392	” said Myra , “
83643	83644	83637	83638	Lord Roehampton	499	” “
83652	83656	83646	83646	you	0	” he replied . “
83666	83667	83663	83663	you	0	” “
83673	83678	83663	83663	you	0	” said Lord Roehampton , “
83685	83692	83693	83693	You	0	” Then rather abruptly he said , “
83700	83701	83695	83696	Colonel Albert	466	” “
83722	83723	83713	83713	he	3393	” “
83732	83743	83713	83713	he	3393	” Then , after a slight pause , he said , “
83750	83751	83746	83748	an interesting man	3399	” “
83756	83760	83746	83748	an interesting man	3399	” said Myra . “
83770	83771	83765	83765	him	3393	” “
83777	83778	83765	83765	him	3393	” “
83791	83792	83781	83781	he	3393	” “
83802	83807	83808	83808	He	3393	” said Lord Roehampton . “
83817	83821	83808	83808	He	3393	” said Myra . “
83837	83838	83839	83839	I	0	” “
83842	83847	83839	83839	I	0	” said Lord Roehampton . “
83860	83934	83839	83839	I	0	” Myra was silent , one might say dumbfounded . She had just screwed herself up to the task which Mr. Neuchatel had imposed on her , and was about to appeal to the good offices of Lord Roehampton in favour of the prince , when he had indulged in a remark which was not only somewhat strange , but from the manner in which it was introduced hardly harmonised with her purpose . “
83943	83948	83937	83937	I	0	” said Lord Roehampton . “
83975	83976	83962	83963	Miss Ferrars	482	” “
83983	83987	83962	83963	Miss Ferrars	482	” thought Myra . “
83996	83997	83998	83998	You	0	” “
84002	84007	83998	83998	You	0	” said Lord Roehampton . “
84056	84085	84047	84047	me	0	” Myra could not speak , but put her left hand to her face . Gently taking her other hand , Lord Roehampton pressed it to his lips . “
84245	84347	84199	84199	I	0	” On the following day , Mr. Neuchatel had good - naturedly invited Endymion down to Hainault , and when he arrived there , a servant informed him that Miss Ferrars wished to see him in her room . It was a long interview and an agitated one , and when she had told her tale , and her brother had embraced her , she sat for a time in silence , holding his hand , and intimating , that , for a while , she wished that neither of them should speak . Suddenly , she resumed , and said , “
84444	84445	84437	84437	I	0	” “
84458	84459	84437	84437	I	0	” “
84464	84471	84462	84462	myself	0	” she replied , rather quickly , “
84480	84495	84462	84462	myself	0	” and then she said in a tone more subdued , and even tender , “
84640	84641	84624	84624	My	0	” “
84649	84653	84624	84624	My	0	” inquired Endymion . “
84776	84777	84778	84779	Dear Myra	466	” “
84787	84792	84778	84779	Dear Myra	466	” involuntarily exclaimed Endymion . “
84903	84904	84889	84889	I	0	” “
84912	84916	84889	84889	I	0	” said Endymion . “
84938	84942	84933	84934	my lord	7235	” said Myra , “
84997	85222	84995	84995	somebody	7483	” During the three months that had to elapse before the happy day , several incidents occurred that ought to be noted . In the first place , Lady Montfort , though disappointed and very much astonished , bore the communication from Lord Roehampton more kindly than he had anticipated . Lord Roehampton made it by letter , and his letters to women were more happy even than his despatches to ministers , and they were unrivalled . He put the matter in the most skilful form . Myra had been born in a social position not inferior to his own , and was the daughter of one of his earliest political friends . He did not dilate too much on her charms and captivating qualities , but sufficiently for the dignity of her who was to become his wife . And then he confessed to Lady Montfort how completely his heart and happiness were set on Lady Roehampton being welcomed becomingly by his friends ; he was well aware , that in these matters things did not always proceed as one could wish , but this was the moment , and this the occasion , to test a friend , and he believed he had the dearest , the most faithful , the most fascinating , and the most powerful in Lady Montfort . “
85234	85239	85240	85240	he	3434	” exclaimed that lady ; “
85270	85380	85248	85248	he	3434	” So Lady Montfort made the acquaintance of Myra , and welcomed her new acquaintance cordially . She was too fine a judge of beauty and deportment not to appreciate them , even when a little prejudice lurked behind . She was amused also , and a little gratified , by being in the secret ; presented Myra with a rare jewel , and declared that she should attend the wedding ; though when the day arrived , she was at Princedown , and could not , unfortunately , leave her lord . About the end of June , a rather remarkable paragraph appeared in the journal of society : “
85465	85650	85450	85452	His Royal Highness	3171	” In the earlier part of July , the approaching alliance of the Earl of Roehampton with Miss Ferrars , the only daughter of the late Right Honourable William Pitt Ferrars , of Hurstley Hall , in the county of Berks , was announced , and great was the sensation , and innumerable the presents instantly ordered . But on no one did the announcement produce a greater effect than on Zenobia ; that the daughter of her dearest friend should make so interesting and so distinguished an alliance was naturally most gratifying to her . She wrote to Myra a most impassioned letter , as if they had only separated yesterday , and a still longer and more fervent one to Lord Roehampton ; Zenobia and he had been close friends in other days , till he wickedly changed his politics , and was always in office and Zenobia always out . This was never to be forgiven . But the bright lady forgot all this now , and sent to Myra the most wondrous bracelet of precious stones , in which the word “
85652	85663	85450	85452	His Royal Highness	3171	” was represented in brilliants , rubies , and emeralds . “
85668	85674	85450	85452	His Royal Highness	3171	” said Myra to Endymion , “
85736	85804	85805	85805	I	0	” Endymion did not receive the banter he expected at the office . The event was too great for a jest . Seymour Hicks , with a serious countenance , said Ferrars might get anywhere now,—all the ministerial receptions of course . Jawett said there would be no ministerial receptions soon ; they were degrading functions . Clear - headed Trenchard congratulated him quietly , and said , “
85826	86002	86003	86003	I	0	” At last the great day arrived , and at St. George ’s , Hanover Square , the Right Honourable the Earl of Roehampton , K.G. , was united to Miss Ferrars . Mr. Penruddock joined their hands . His son Nigel had been invited to assist him , but did not appear , though Myra had written to him . The great world assembled in force , and Endymion observed Mr. and Mrs. Rodney and Imogene in the body of the church . After the ceremony there was an entertainment in Portland Place , and the world ate ortolans and examined the presents . These were remarkable for number and splendour . Myra could not conceal her astonishment at possessing so many friends ; but it was the fashion for all Lord Roehampton ’s acquaintance to make him offerings , and to solicit his permission to present gifts to his bride . Mr. Neuchatel placed on her brow a diamond tiara , and Mrs. Neuchatel encircled her neck with one of her diamond necklaces . “
86014	86018	86003	86003	I	0	” she observed , “
86032	86251	86020	86020	Adriana	481	” Prince Florestan presented Lady Roehampton with a vase which had belonged to his mother , and which had been painted by Boucher for Marie Antoinette . It was matchless , and almost unique . Not long after this , Lord Beaumaris , with many servants and many guns , took Waldershare and Endymion down with him to Scotland . The end of the season is a pang to society . More hopes have been baffled than realised . There is something melancholy in the last ball , though the music ever seems louder , and the lights more glaring than usual . Or it may be , the last entertainment is that hecatomb they call a wedding breakfast , which celebrates the triumph of a rival . That is pleasant . Society , to do it justice , struggles hard to revive in other scenes the excitement that has expired . It sails to Cowes , it scuds to bubbling waters in the pine forests of the continent , it stalks even into Scotland ; but it is difficult to restore the romance that has been rudely disturbed , and to gather again together the threads of the intrigue that have been lost in the wild flight of society from that metropolis , which is now described as “
86254	86992	86993	86993	I	0	desert”—that is to say , a park or so , two or three squares , and a dozen streets where society lives ; where it dines , and dances , and blackballs , and bets , and spouts . But to the world in general , the mighty million , to the professional classes , to all men of business whatever , the end of the season is the beginning of carnival . It is the fulfilment of the dream over which they have been brooding for ten months , which has sustained them in toil , lightened anxiety , and softened even loss . It is air , it is health , it is movement , it is liberty , it is nature — earth , sea , lake , moor , forest , mountain , and river . From the heights of the Engadine to Margate Pier , there is equal rapture , for there is an equal cessation of routine . Few enjoy a holiday more than a young clerk in a public office , who has been bred in a gentle home , and enjoyed in his boyhood all the pastimes of gentlemen . Now he is ever toiling , with an uncertain prospect of annual relaxation , and living hardly . Once on a time , at the paternal hall , he could shoot , or fish , or ride , every day of his life , as a matter of course ; and now , what would he not give for a good day ’s sport ? Such thoughts had frequently crossed the mind of Endymion when drudging in London during the autumn , and when all his few acquaintances were away . It was , therefore , with no ordinary zest that he looked forward to the unexpected enjoyment of an unstinted share of some of the best shooting in the United Kingdom . And the relaxation and the pastime came just at the right moment , when the reaction , from all the excitement attendant on the marvellous change in his sister ’s position , would have made him , deprived of her consoling society , doubly sensible of his isolated position . It so happened that the moors of Lord Beaumaris were contiguous to the celebrated shootings of Dinniewhiskie , which were rented by Prince Florestan , and the opportunity now offered which Waldershare desired of making the acquaintance of the prince in an easy manner . Endymion managed this cleverly . Waldershare took a great fancy to the prince . He sympathised with him , and imparted to Endymion his belief that they could not do a better thing than devote their energies to a restoration of his rights . Lord Beaumaris , who hated foreigners , but who was always influenced by Waldershare , also liked the prince , and was glad to be reminded by his mentor that Florestan was half an Englishman , not to say a whole one , for he was an Eton boy . What was equally influential with Lord Beaumaris was , that the prince was a fine shot , and indeed a consummate sportsman , and had in his manners that calm which is rather unusual with foreigners , and which is always pleasing to an English aristocrat . So in time they became intimate , sported much together , and visited each other at their respective quarters . The prince was never alone . What the county paper described as distinguished foreigners were perpetually paying him visits , long or short , and it did not generally appear that these visits were influenced by a love of sport . One individual , who arrived shortly after the prince , remained , and , as was soon known , was to remain permanently . This was a young gentleman , short and swarthy , with flashing eyes and a black moustache , known by the name of the Duke of St. Angelo , but who was really only a cadet of that illustrious house . The Duke of St. Angelo took the management of the household of the prince — was evidently the controller ; servants trembled at his nod , and he rode any horse he liked ; he invited guests , and arranged the etiquette of the interior . He said one day very coolly to Waldershare : “
87008	87009	87012	87012	we	3451	” “
87014	87015	87012	87012	we	3451	” “
87028	87041	87012	87012	we	3451	” said the Duke of St. Angelo , with an arrogant air . “
87046	87050	87012	87012	we	3451	” replied Waldershare , “
87056	87057	87053	87054	his royalty	3452	” “
87064	87070	87053	87054	his royalty	3452	” said the duke contemptuously . “
87107	87111	87101	87101	me	0	” added Waldershare , “
87134	87135	87101	87101	me	0	” “
87166	87174	87101	87101	me	0	” said the Duke of St. Angelo , “
87186	87187	87182	87183	His Majesty	1229	” “
87190	87194	87182	87183	His Majesty	1229	” said Waldershare . “
87226	88062	87215	87224	the great man who made that treaty by an attainder	3461	” Endymion returned to town towards the end of September , Waldershare went to Paris , and Lord Beaumaris and the prince , who had become intimate , repaired together to Conington , the seat of Lord Beaumaris , to kill pheasants . Even the Rodneys , who had gone to the Rhine this year , had not returned . Endymion had only the society of his fellow clerks . He liked Trenchard , who was acute , full of official information , and of gentle breeding . Still it must be confessed that Endymion felt the change in his society . Seymour Hicks was hardly a fit successor to Waldershare , and Jawett ’s rabid abstractions on government were certainly not so interesting as la haute politique of the Duke of St. Angelo . Were it not for the letters which he constantly received from his sister , he would have felt a little despondent . As it was , he renewed his studies in his pleasant garret , trained himself in French and German , and got up several questions for the Union . The month seemed very long , but it was not unprofitably spent . The Rodneys were still absent . They had not returned as they had intended direct to England , but had gone to Paris to meet Mr. Waldershare . At the end of October there was a semi - official paragraph announcing the approaching meeting of the Cabinet , and the movements of its members . Some were in the north , and some were in the south ; some were killing the last grouse , and some , placed in green ridings , were blazing in battues . But all were to be at their post in ten days , and there was a special notification that intelligence had been received of the arrival of Lord and Lady Roehampton at Gibraltar . Lady Roehampton , in her stately mansion in St. James ’ Square , found life very different from what she had experienced in her Andalusian dream . For three months she had been the constant companion of one of the most fascinating of men , whose only object had been to charm and delight her . And in this he had entirely succeeded . From the moment they arrived in London , however , they seemed to be separated , and although when they met , there was ever a sweet smile and a kind and playful word for her , his brow , if not oppressed with care , was always weighty with thought . Lord Roehampton was little at his office ; he worked in a spacious chamber on the ground floor of his private residence , and which was called the Library , though its literature consisted only of Hansard , volumes of state papers , shelves of treatises , and interminable folios of parliamentary reports . He had not been at home a week before the floor of the apartment was literally covered with red boxes , all containing documents requiring attention , and which messengers were perpetually bringing or carrying away . Then there were long meetings of the Cabinet almost daily , and daily visits from ambassadors and foreign ministers , which prevented the transaction of the current business , and rendered it necessary that Lord Roehampton should sit up late in his cabinet , and work sometimes nearly till the hours of dawn . There had been of course too some arrears of business , for secretaries of state can not indulge with impunity in Andalusian dreams , but Lord Roehampton was well served . His under - secretaries of state were capable and experienced men , and their chief had not been altogether idle in his wanderings . He had visited Paris , and the capital of France in those days was the capital of diplomacy . The visit of Lord Roehampton had settled some questions which might have lingered for years , and had given him that opportunity of personal survey which to a statesman is invaluable . Although it was not the season , the great desert had , comparatively speaking , again become peopled . There were many persons in town , and they all called immediately on Lady Roehampton . The ministerial families and the diplomatic corps alone form a circle , but there is also a certain number of charming people who love London in November , and lead there a wondrous pleasant life of real amusement , until their feudal traditions and their domestic duties summon them back to their Christmas homes . Lord and Lady Roehampton gave constant dinners , and after they had tried two or three , he expressed his wish to his wife that she should hold a small reception after these dinners . He was a man of great tact , and he wished to launch his wife quietly and safely on the social ocean . “
88074	88079	88071	88072	my love	6993	” he would say ; “
88098	88130	88071	88072	my love	6993	” And he was quite right . The dinners became the mode , and the assemblies were eagerly appreciated . The Secretary of the Treasury whispered to an Under - Secretary of State,—“This
88142	88289	88136	88136	We	3463	” Myra had been a little anxious about the relations between Lord Roehampton and her brother . She felt , with a woman ’s instinct , that her husband might not be overpleased by her devotion to Endymion , and she could not resist the conviction that the disparity of age which is easily forgotten in a wife , and especially in a wife who adores you , assumes a different , and somewhat distasteful character , when a great statesman is obliged to recognise it in the shape of a boyish brother - in - law . But all went right , for the sweetness of Lord Roehampton ’s temper was inexhaustible . Endymion had paid several visits to St. James ’ square before Myra could seize the opportunity , for which she was ever watching , to make her husband and her brother acquainted . “
88298	88314	88292	88292	you	3465	” said Lord Roehampton , with his sweetest smile and in his most musical tone , “
88328	88350	88319	88319	We	3466	” And then he asked Endymion who was his chief , and how he liked him , and then he said , “
88399	88436	88394	88395	A younker	3473	” Lady Roehampton was desirous of paying some attention to all those who had been kind to her brother ; particularly Mr. Waldershare and Lord Beaumaris — and she wished to invite them to her house . “
88446	88450	88437	88437	I	0	” said Endymion , “
88473	88474	88467	88467	him	507	” “
88503	88507	88509	88509	he	507	” said Myra , “
88513	88514	88515	88515	I	0	” “
88531	88535	88528	88529	Mr. Trenchard	431	” said Endymion ; “
88549	88550	88543	88543	he	431	” “
88584	88732	88567	88567	I	0	” The Neuchatels were not in town , but Myra saw them frequently , and Mr. Neuchatel often dined in St. James ’ Square — but the ladies always declined every invitation of the kind . They came up from Hainault to see Myra , but looked as if nothing but their great affection would prompt such a sacrifice , and seemed always pining for Arcadia . Endymion , however , not unfrequently continued his Sunday visits to Hainault , to which Mr. Neuchatel had given him a general welcome . This young gentleman , indeed , soon experienced a considerable change in his social position . Invitations flocked to him , and often from persons whom he did not know , and who did not even know him . He went by the name of Lady Roehampton ’s brother , and that was a sufficient passport . “
88746	88754	88733	88733	We	3479	” said Belinda to a fair friend . “
88761	88762	88756	88756	men	1114	” “
88776	88777	88781	88781	him	442	” “
88783	88813	88781	88781	him	442	“ Then there is Lord Willesden and Henry Grantley — I know they are passing through town — and there is the new man , Lady Roehampton ’s brother . ”
88814	88847	88857	88857	he	425	“ I will send to Lord Willesden and Henry Grantley immediately , and perhaps you will send a card , which I will write here , for me to the new man . ”
88862	88865	88857	88857	he	425	“ everywhere . ”
89607	89620	89602	89602	He	3522	“ The first dinner - bell often brings things to a point . ”
90079	90093	90062	90066	the Secretary of the Treasury	8140	“ that if they did not take care they would upset the government . ”
90094	90104	90062	90066	the Secretary of the Treasury	8140	“ That is exactly what we want to do , ”
90307	90473	90290	90291	Mr. Wilton	326	“ I have had a very busy morning about my office . There is to be a complete revolution in it . The whole system is to be reconstructed ; half the present people are to be pensioned off , and new blood is to be introduced . It struck me that this might be an opening for your brother . He is in the public service — that is something ; and as there are to be so many new men , there will be no jealousy as to his promotion . If you will speak to him about it , and he likes it , I will appoint him one of the new clerks ; and then , if he also likes it , he shall be my private secretary . That will give him position , and be no mean addition to his income , you know , if we last — but that depends , I suppose , on Mr. Jorrocks . ”
90488	90496	90497	90497	she	499	“ It is exactly what I wished , ”
90500	90751	90497	90497	she	499	“ I wanted you to be private secretary to a cabinet minister , and if I were to choose any one , except , of course , my lord , it would be Mr. Wilton . He is a perfect gentleman , and was dear papa ’s friend . I understand you will have three hundred a year to begin with , and the same amount as his secretary . You ought to be able to live with ease and propriety on six hundred a year — and this reminds me of what I have been thinking of before we went to Gaydene . I think now you ought to have a more becoming residence . The Rodneys are good people , I do not doubt , and I dare say we shall have an opportunity of proving our sense of their services ; but they are not exactly the people that I care for you to live with , and , at any rate , you can not reside any longer in a garret . I have taken some chambers in the Albany , therefore , for you , and they shall be my contribution to your housekeeping . They are not badly furnished , but they belonged to an old general officer , and are not very new - fashioned ; but we will go together and see them to - morrow , and I dare say I shall soon be able to make them comme il faut . ”
91317	91328	91329	91329	he	425	“ How it will come about I can not say , ”
91333	91455	91329	91329	he	425	“ but it will come . If my legitimate sovereign were on the throne , and I in the possession of my estates , which were graciously presented by the usurper to the sausage - makers , or some other choice middle - class corporation , I would marry her myself . But that is impossible . That would only be asking her to share my ruin . I want her to live in palaces , and perhaps , in my decline of life , make me her librarian , like Casanova . I should be content to dine in her hall every day beneath the salt , and see her enter with her state , amid the flourish of trumpets . ”
92074	92083	92084	92084	she	420	“ How do you do , Mr. Ferrars ? ”
92089	92122	92084	92084	she	420	“ I am writing to Sylvia . They are not returning as soon as they intended , and I am to go down to Conington by an early train to - morrow . ”
92123	92131	92133	92133	Endymion	425	“ I want to see Mr. Rodney , ”
92136	92149	92151	92151	Imogene	420	“ Can I write anything to him , or tell him anything ? ”
92153	92156	92158	92158	Endymion	425	“ No , ”
92164	92203	92158	92158	Endymion	425	“ I can tell you what I wanted to say . But you must be occupied now , going away , and unexpectedly , to - morrow . It seems to me that every one is going away . ”
92204	92215	92217	92217	Imogene	420	“ Well , we have lost the prince , certainly , ”
92219	92232	92217	92217	Imogene	420	“ and I doubt whether his rooms will be ever let again . ”
92233	92236	92238	92238	Endymion	425	“ Indeed ! ”
92240	92307	92238	92238	Endymion	425	“ Well , I only know what Mr. Waldershare tells me . He says that Mr. Rodney and Mr. Vigo have made a great speculation , and gained a great deal of money ; but Mr. Rodney never speaks to me of such matters , nor indeed does Sylvia . I am myself very sorry that the prince has gone , for he interested me much . ”
92308	92328	92330	92330	Endymion	425	“ Well , I should think Mr. Rodney would not be very sorry to get rid of me then , ”
92332	92374	92330	92330	Endymion	425	“ O Mr. Ferrars ! why should you say or think such things ! I am sure that my brother and sister , and indeed every one in this house , always consider your comfort and welfare before any other object . ”
92375	92378	92380	92380	Endymion	425	“ Yes , ”
92382	92405	92380	92380	Endymion	425	“ you have all been most kind to me , and that makes me more wretched at the prospect of leaving you . ”
92406	92415	92330	92330	Endymion	425	“ But there is no prospect of that ? ”
92416	92433	92436	92436	he	425	“ A certainty , Imogene ; there is going to be a change in my life , ”
92441	92444	92446	92446	Imogene	420	“ Well , ”
92448	92636	92446	92446	Imogene	420	“ it would be selfish not to be happy at what I hear ; but though I hope I am happy , I need not be joyful . I never used to be nervous , but I am afraid I am getting so . All these great changes rather shake me . This adventure of the prince — as Mr. Waldershare says , it is history . Then Miss Myra ’s great marriage , and your promotion — although they are exactly what we used to dream about , and wished a fairy would accomplish , and somehow felt that , somehow or other , they must happen — yet now they have occurred , one is almost as astounded as delighted . We certainly have been very happy in Warwick Street , at least I have been , all living as it were together . But where shall we be this time next year ? All scattered , and perhaps not even the Rodneys under this roof . I know not how it is , but I dread leaving the roof where one has been happy . ”
92637	92665	92330	92330	Endymion	425	“ Oh ! you know you must leave it one day or other , Imogene . You are sure to marry ; that you can not avoid . ”
92666	92679	92681	92681	Imogene	420	“ Well , I am not by any means sure about that , ”
92683	92792	92681	92681	Imogene	420	“ Mr. Waldershare , in educating me , as he says , as a princess , has made me really neither fish , flesh , nor fowl , nor even that coarser but popular delicacy never forgotten . I could not unite my life with a being who was not refined in mind and in manners , and the men of my class in life , who are the only ones after all who might care to marry me , shock my taste , I am ashamed to say so . I am not sure it is not wicked to think it even ; but so it is . ”
92793	92801	92803	92803	Endymion	425	“ Why do you not marry Waldershare ? ”
92805	92995	92803	92803	Endymion	425	“ That would be madness ! I do not know any alliance that could prove more unfortunate . Mr. Waldershare must never marry . All people of imagination , they say , are difficult to live with ; but a person who consists solely of imagination , like Mr. Waldershare , who has indeed no other attribute — before a year was past , married , he would fly to the desert or to La Trappe , commit terrible scandals from mere weariness of feeling , write pasquinades against the wife of his bosom , and hold us both up to the fierce laughter of the world . No , no ; he is the best , the dearest , and the most romantic of friends ; tender as a father , and sometimes as wise , for genius can be everything . He is going to rise early to - morrow , which he particularly dislikes , because he will not let me go to the station alone ; though I tell him , as I often tell him , those are the becoming manners of my class . ”
92996	93009	93011	93011	Endymion	425	“ But you might meet a person of the refinement you require , ”
93013	93031	93011	93011	Endymion	425	“ with a moderate and yet a sufficient income , who would not be unworthy of you . ”
93032	93037	93039	93039	Imogene	420	“ I doubt it , ”
93041	93052	93054	93054	Endymion	425	“ But , do not doubt it , dear Imogene , ”
93058	93099	93054	93054	Endymion	425	“ such charms as yours , both of body and of mind , such a companion in life , so refined , so accomplished , and yet endowed with such clear sense , and such a sweet disposition — believe me ”
93138	93147	93149	93149	Imogene	420	“ Good gracious ! what is all this ? ”
93151	93157	93159	93159	Endymion	425	“ It is my sister , ”
93163	93169	93159	93159	Endymion	425	“ it is Lady Roehampton . ”
93170	93178	93180	93180	Imogene	420	“ I must go to her myself , ”
93182	93194	93180	93180	Imogene	420	“ I can not have the servant attend upon your sister . ”
93238	93253	93230	93230	Imogene	420	“ Lady Roehampton wishes you to go with her directly on some particular business . ”
94086	94092	94068	94069	a lady	739	“ We have just arrived , ”
94097	94145	94068	94069	a lady	739	“ and I want you to give me a little dinner to - day . My lord is going to dine with an Old Bailey lawyer , who amuses him , and I do not like to be left , the first day , on the pave . ”
94146	94162	94164	94165	Mr. Wilton	326	“ I can give you a rather large dinner , if you care to come , ”
94167	94251	94164	94165	Mr. Wilton	326	“ but I fear you will not like it . I have got some House of Commons men dining with me to - day , and one or two of the other House to meet them . My sister Georgina has very good - naturedly promised to come , with her husband , and I have just written a note to the Duchess Dowager of Keswick , who often helps me — but I fear this sort of thing would hardly suit you . ”
94252	94303	94068	94069	a lady	739	“ On the contrary , I think it will be very amusing . Only do not put me between two of your colleagues . Anybody amuses me for once . A new acquaintance is like a new book . I prefer it , even if bad , to a classic . ”
94742	94753	94754	94754	she	499	“ I have been , and am , extremely amused , ”
94757	94776	94754	94754	she	499	“ and now tell me , who is that young man at the very end of the table ? ”
94777	94787	94811	94812	Lady Montfort	499	“ That is my private secretary , Mr. Ferrars . ”
94788	94791	94754	94754	she	499	“ Ferrars ! ”
94792	94799	94754	94754	she	499	“ A brother of Lady Roehampton . ”
94800	94808	94811	94812	Lady Montfort	499	“ Present him to me after dinner . ”
94925	94930	94931	94931	she	3686	“ Do you think , ”
94934	94949	94931	94931	she	3686	“ Lady Roehampton would see me to - morrow if I called on her ? ”
94950	94960	94962	94962	Endymion	425	“ If I were Lady Roehampton , I would , ”
94984	94996	94998	94999	Lady Montfort	499	“ I will write her a little note in the morning , ”
95002	95021	94998	94999	Lady Montfort	499	“ One may leave cards for ever . Mr. Wilton tells me you are quite his right hand . ”
95022	95031	95033	95033	Endymion	425	“ Mr. Wilton is too kind to me , ”
95035	95052	95033	95033	Endymion	425	“ One could not be excused for not doing one ’s best for such a master . ”
95053	95063	95065	95066	Lady Montfort	499	“ You like people to be kind to you ? ”
95068	95089	95065	95066	Lady Montfort	499	“ Well , I have not met with so much kindness in this world as to become insensible to it . ”
95090	95099	95101	95102	Lady Montfort	499	“ You are too young to be melancholy , ”
95104	95112	95101	95102	Lady Montfort	499	“ are you older than Lady Roehampton ? ”
95113	95118	95065	95066	Lady Montfort	499	“ We are twins . ”
95119	95133	95065	95066	Lady Montfort	499	“ Twins ! and wonderfully like too ! Is it not thought so ? ”
95134	95142	95065	95066	Lady Montfort	499	“ I have sometimes heard it mentioned . ”
95143	95150	95156	95156	she	499	“ Oh , it is striking ! ”
95225	95234	95236	95237	Lady Montfort	499	“ Well , I wish I did not , ”
95239	95366	95236	95237	Lady Montfort	499	“ However , I will soon find out something about it . I have only just come to town ; but I intend to open my house , immediately . Now I must go . What are you going to do with yourself to - morrow ? I wish you would come and dine with Lord Montfort . It will be quite without form , a few agreeable and amusing people ; Lord Montfort must be amused . It seems a reasonable fancy , but very difficult to realise ; and now you shall ask for my carriage , and to - morrow I hope to be able to tell Lady Roehampton what very great pleasure I have had in making the acquaintance of her brother . ”
95489	95497	95498	95498	he	428	“ You are surprised to see me , ”
95501	95855	95498	95498	he	428	“ It is two years since we met . Well , I have done wonders ; carried all before me . By Jove , sir , I can walk into a minister ’s private room with as much ease as I were entering the old den . The ambassadors are hand and glove with me . There are very few things I do not know . I have made the fortune of the ‘ Chuck - Farthing , ’ trebled its circulation , and invented a new style , which has put me at the head of all ‘ our own correspondents . ’ I wish you were at Paris ; I would give you a dinner at the Rocher , which would make up for all our dinners at that ferocious ruffian , Joe ’s . I gave a dinner the other day to forty of them , all ‘ our own correspondents , ’ or such like . Do you know , my dear fellow , when I looked round the room , there was not a man who had not done his best to crush me ; running down my works or not noticing them , or continually dilating on Gushy as if the English public would never read anything else . Now , that was Christian - like of me , was not it ? God , sir , if they only had but one neck , and I had been the Emperor Nero — but , I will not dwell on it ; I hate them . However , it suits me to take the other line at present . I am all for fraternity and that sort of thing , and give them dinners . There is a reason why , but there is no time to talk about that now . I shall want their sweet voices — the hounds ! But , my dear fellow , I am truly glad to see you . Do you know , I always liked you ; and how come you to be in this quarter this fine morning ? ”
95856	95863	95865	95865	Endymion	425	“ I live in the Albany , ”
95867	95874	95876	95877	St. Barbe	428	“ You live in the Albany ! ”
95886	95969	95876	95877	St. Barbe	428	“ I knew I could not be a knight of the garter , or a member of White’s — the only two things an Englishman can not command ; but I did think I might some day live in the Albany . It was my dream . And you live there ! Gracious ! what an unfortunate fellow I am ! I do not see how you can live in the Albany with your salary ; I suppose they have raised you . ”
95970	95977	95979	95979	Endymion	425	“ I have left Somerset House , ”
95981	96000	95979	95979	Endymion	425	“ and am now at the Board of Trade , and am private secretary to Mr. Sidney Wilton . ”
96001	96004	96006	96007	St. Barbe	428	“ Oh ! ”
96009	96157	96006	96007	St. Barbe	428	“ then we have friends at court . You may do something for me , if I only knew what I wanted . They have no decorations here . Curse this aristocratic country , they want all the honours to themselves . I should like to be in the Board of Trade , and would make some sacrifice for it . The proprietors of the ‘ Chuck - Farthing ’ pay well ; they pay like gentlemen ; though , why I say so I do not exactly know , for no gentleman ever paid me anything . But , if I could be Secretary of the Board of Trade , or get 1500 pounds a year secure , I would take it ; and I dare say I could get employed on some treaties , as I speak French , and then I might get knighted . ”
96158	96169	96171	96171	Endymion	425	“ Well , I think you are very well off , ”
96173	96190	96171	96171	Endymion	425	“ carrying , as you say , everything before you . What more can you want ? ”
96191	96197	96199	96200	St. Barbe	428	“ I hate the craft , ”
96209	96456	96199	96200	St. Barbe	428	“ I should like to show them all up before I died . I suppose it was your sister marrying a lord that got you on in this way . I could have married a countess myself , but then , to be sure , she was only a Polish one , and hard up . I never had a sister ; I never had any luck in life at all . I wish I had been a woman . Women are the only people who get on . A man works all his life , and thinks he has done a wonderful thing if , with one leg in the grave and no hair on his head , he manages to get a coronet ; and a woman dances at a ball with some young fellow or other , or sits next to some old fellow at dinner and pretends she thinks him charming , and he makes her a peeress on the spot . Oh ! it is a disgusting world ; it must end in revolution . Now you tell your master , Mr. Sidney Wilton , that if he wants to strengthen the institutions of this country , the government should establish an order of merit , and the press ought to be represented in it . I do not speak only for myself ; I speak for my brethren . Yes , sir , I am not ashamed of my order . ”
96465	96468	96470	96470	Endymion	425	“ Unchanged , ”
96477	96501	96470	96470	Endymion	425	“ the vainest , the most envious , and the most amusing of men ! I wonder what he will do in life . ”
96522	96528	96470	96470	Endymion	425	“ go into the City . ”
96693	96699	96701	96702	Mr. Rodney	408	“ That feeling is reciprocal , ”
96704	96931	96701	96702	Mr. Rodney	408	“ If only because you were the son of my revered and right honourable friend , you would always be esteemed here . But you are esteemed , or , I may say beloved , for your own sake . We shall be proud to be considered with kindness by you , and I echo your wish that , though no longer living under the same roof , we may yet , and even often , meet . But do not say another word about the inconvenience you are occasioning us . The truth is , that although wherever we went the son of my revered and right honourable friend would have always commanded hospitality from us , there are many changes about to take place in our family which have made us for some time contemplate leaving Warwick Street . Affairs , especially of late , have gone pretty well with me in the world,—at least not badly ; I have had friends , and I hope have proved not undeserving of them . I wish Sylvia , too , to live in an airier situation , near the park , so that she may ride every morning . Besides , I have a piece of news to communicate to you , which would materially affect our arrangements . We are going to lose Imogene . ”
96932	96942	96944	96944	Endymion	425	“ Ah ! she is going to be married , ”
96948	96956	96958	96959	Mr. Rodney	408	“ She is going to be married , ”
96962	96967	96969	96969	Endymion	425	“ To Mr. Waldershare ? ”
96971	96991	96969	96969	Endymion	425	“ He almost said as much to me in a letter this morning . But I always thought so . ”
96992	97000	97002	97003	Mr. Rodney	408	“ No ; not to Mr. Waldershare , ”
97005	97013	97015	97015	Endymion	425	“ Who is the happy man then ? ”
97019	97035	97015	97015	Endymion	425	“ I truly call him so ; for I think myself that Imogene is perfection . ”
97036	97049	97050	97050	Simon	552	“ Imogene is about to be married to the Earl of Beaumaris . ”
99021	99044	99014	99014	she	504	“ I have got a horse , Lady Berengaria , which I should like you to ride . Would you do so ? ”
99045	99056	99004	99004	He	548	“ Certainly , and what sort of horse is it ? ”
99057	99080	99083	99083	he	548	“ You shall see to - morrow . It is not far off . I like to have some horses always near , ”
99119	99125	99127	99128	Lord Montfort	548	“ I agree with you , ”
99130	99155	99127	99128	Lord Montfort	548	“ that it will spoil you for any other horse , and therefore I shall ask permission to leave it here for your use . ”
99424	99437	99380	99381	Lord Montfort	548	“ I wonder if anything would ever induce you to marry me ? ”
100375	100378	100373	100373	he	548	“ idiosyncrasy . ”
100680	100683	100684	100684	she	499	“ What , ”
100688	100791	100684	100684	she	499	“ are rank and wealth to us ? We were born to them . We want something that we were not born to . You reason like a parvenu . Of course , if you had created your rank and your riches , you might rest on your oars , and find excitement in the recollection of what you had achieved . A man of your position ought to govern the country , and it always was so in the old days . Your family were prime ministers ; why not you , with as much talent , and much more knowledge ? ”
100792	100804	100684	100684	she	499	“ You would make a very good prime minister , Berengaria . ”
100805	100816	100684	100684	she	499	“ Ah ! you always jest , I am serious . ”
100817	100841	100684	100684	she	499	“ And so am I. If I ever am to work , I would sooner be a civil engineer than a prime minister . ”
100980	101007	100975	100976	Lady Montfort	499	“ I trust much to the periodical visits of that dear Queen of Mesopotamia . He must entertain her , for his father was her lover . ”
101165	101170	101243	101243	they	3875	“ I dined yesterday , ”
101172	101177	101243	101243	they	3875	“ the other day , ”
101184	101236	101243	101243	they	3875	“ with Montfort ; out and out the best dinner I ever had , and such an agreeable fellow ; the wittiest , the most amusing , certainly the most charming fellow that ever lived ; out and out ! It is a pity he does not show a little more . ”
101331	101344	101325	101325	he	548	“ Have I heard a single thing worth remembering ? Not one . ”
101574	101585	101586	101586	she	499	“ Lord Montfort is a little late to - day , ”
101589	101609	101610	101610	she	499	“ but he wished me not to wait for him . And how are you after our parliamentary banquet ? ”
101617	101628	101610	101610	she	499	“ I will introduce you to the Count of Ferroll . ”
102219	102231	102233	102234	Lord Montfort	548	“ I fear I am not in time for an oyster , ”
102630	102665	102627	102627	He	548	“ I have not yet made the acquaintance of Lady Roehampton , for I never go out ; but I hope to do so , for Lady Montfort tells me she is quite captivating . ”
102666	102674	102676	102676	Endymion	561	“ She is a very good sister , ”
102678	102722	102676	102676	Endymion	561	“ Lady Montfort has told me a great deal about yourself , and all of it I was glad to hear . I like young men who rise by their merits , and Mr. Sidney Wilton tells Lady Montfort that yours are distinguished . ”
102723	102734	102627	102627	He	548	“ Mr. Sidney Wilton is a kind master , sir . ”
102735	102751	102753	102754	Lord Montfort	548	“ Well , I was his fag at Harrow , and I thought him so , ”
102756	102794	102753	102754	Lord Montfort	548	“ And now about your office ; tell me what you do . You were not there first , Lady Montfort says . Where were you first ? Tell me all about it . I like detail . ”
102878	102971	102874	102875	Lord Montfort	548	“ You came here to - day as Lady Montfort ’s friend , but you must come in future as mine also . And will you understand , I dine at home every day when I am in town , and I give you a general invitation . Come as often as you like ; you will be always welcome . Only let the house know your intention an hour before dinner - time , as I have a particular aversion to the table being crowded , or seeing an empty chair . ”
103335	103344	103346	103346	Nigel	548	“ That Lady Montfort is a great woman , ”
103356	103368	103346	103346	Nigel	548	“ She has it in her to be another Empress Helena . ”
103369	103372	103320	103320	Endymion	561	“ Indeed ! ”
103373	103425	103346	103346	Nigel	548	“ I believe she has only one thought , and that the only thought worthy the human mind — the Church . I was glad to meet you at her house . You have cherished , I hope , those views which in your boyhood you so fervently and seriously embraced . ”
103426	103432	103434	103434	Endymion	561	“ I am rather surprised , ”
103443	103466	103434	103434	Endymion	561	“ at a Whig lady entertaining such high views in these matters . The Liberal party rather depends on the Low Church . ”
103467	103487	103489	103489	Nigel	548	“ I know nothing about Whigs or Tories or Liberals , or any other new names which they invent , ”
103491	103549	103489	103489	Nigel	548	“ Nor do I know , or care to know , what Low Church means . There is but one Church , and it is catholic and apostolic ; and if we act on its principles , there will be no need , and there ought to be no need , for any other form of government . ”
103550	103559	103561	103561	Endymion	561	“ Well , those are very distinct views , ”
103563	103574	103561	103561	Endymion	561	“ but are they as practical as they are clear ? ”
103575	103618	103489	103489	Nigel	548	“ Why should they not be practical ? Everything is practical which we believe ; and in the long run , which is most likely that we should believe , what is taught by God , or what is taught by man ? ”
103619	103623	103625	103625	Endymion	561	“ I confess , ”
103627	103707	103625	103625	Endymion	561	“ that in all matters , both civil and religious , I incline to what is moderate and temperate . I always trace my dear father ’s sad end , and all the terrible events in my family , to his adopting in 1829 the views of the extreme party . If he had only followed the example and the advice of his best friend , Mr. Sidney Wilton , what a different state of affairs might have occurred ! ”
103708	103715	103717	103717	Nigel	548	“ I know nothing about politics , ”
103719	103771	103717	103717	Nigel	548	“ By being moderate and temperate in politics I suppose you mean being adroit , and doing that which is expedient and which will probably be successful . But the Church is founded on absolute truth , and teaches absolute truth , and there can be no compromise on such matters . ”
103772	103780	103782	103782	Endymion	561	“ Well , I do not know , ”
103784	103838	103782	103782	Endymion	561	“ but surely there are many very religious people , who do not accept without reserve everything that is taught by the Church . I hope I am a religious person myself , and yet , for example , I can not give an unreserved assent to the whole of the Athanasian Creed . ”
103839	103964	103489	103489	Nigel	548	“ The Athanasian Creed is the most splendid ecclesiastical lyric ever poured forth by the genius of man . I give to every clause of it an implicit assent . It does not pretend to be divine ; it is human , but the Church has hallowed it , and the Church ever acts under the influence of the Divine Spirit . St. Athanasius was by far the greatest man that ever existed . If you cavil at his creed , you will soon cavil at other symbols . I was prepared for infidelity in London , but I confess , my dear Ferrars , you alarm me . I was in hopes that your early education would have saved you from this backsliding . ”
103965	104038	103717	103717	Nigel	548	“ But let us be calm , my dear Nigel . Do you mean to say , that I am to be considered an infidel or an apostate , because , although I fervently embrace all the vital truths of religion , and try , on the whole , to regulate my life by them , I may have scruples about believing , for example , in the personality of the Devil ? ”
104039	104219	103625	103625	Endymion	561	“ If the personality of Satan be not a vital principle of your religion , I do not know what is . There is only one dogma higher . You think it is safe , and I daresay it is fashionable , to fall into this lax and really thoughtless discrimination between what is and what is not to be believed . It is not good taste to believe in the Devil . Give me a single argument against his personality which is not applicable to the personality of the Deity . Will you give that up ; and if so , where are you ? Now mark me ; you and I are young men — you are a very young man . This is the year of grace 1839 . If these loose thoughts , which you have heedlessly taken up , prevail in this country for a generation or so — five and twenty or thirty years — we may meet together again , and I shall have to convince you that there is a God . ”
104529	104553	104515	104515	she	335	“ Tell me the names of the Radical members who want to turn out the government , and I will invite them directly . ”
104587	104597	104599	104599	Zenobia	335	“ I should have liked to have taken Wednesdays , ”
104601	104753	104599	104599	Zenobia	335	“ but I do not care to seem to be setting up against Lady Roehampton , for her mother was my dearest friend . Not that I think any quarter ought to be shown to her after joining those atrocious Whigs , but to be sure she was corrupted by her husband , whom I remember the most thorough Tory going . To be sure , I was a Whig myself in those days , so one must not say too much about it , but the Whigs then were gentlemen . I will tell you what I will do . I will receive both on Saturdays and Wednesdays . It is an effort , and I am not as young as I was , but it will only be for a season or less , for I know these people can not stand . It will be all over by May. ”
105336	105427	105325	105326	Lord Roehampton	499	“ You know , my darling , our people do not much like him . They look upon him as a pretender , as having forfeited his parole , and as a refugee from justice . I have no prejudices against him myself , and perhaps in the same situation might have acted in the same manner ; but if he is to be admitted into society , it should hardly be at a ministerial reception , and of all houses , that of one who holds my particular post . ”
105428	105438	105440	105441	Lady Roehampton	499	“ I know nothing about his forfeiting his parole , ”
105443	105577	105440	105441	Lady Roehampton	499	“ the charge is involved in mystery , and Mr. Waldershare told me it was an entire fabrication . As for his being a pretender , he seems to me as legitimate a prince as most we meet ; he was born in the purple , and his father was recognised by every government in Europe except our own . As for being a refugee from justice , a prince in captivity has certainly a right to escape if he can , and his escape was romantic . However , I will not contest any decision of yours , for I think you are always right . Only I am disappointed , for , to say nothing of the unkindness , I can not help feeling our not noticing him is rather shabby . ”
105738	105837	105734	105734	he	4035	“ Do you know , my dear Myra , I do not see why you should not ask Prince Florestan . It is you that ask him , not I. That is one of the pleasant results of our system of political entertainments . The guests come to pay their respects to the lady of the house , so no one is committed . The prince may visit you on Wednesday just as well as the leaders of the opposition who want our places , or the malcontent Radicals who they say are going to turn us out . ”
106371	106489	106490	106490	Endymion	425	“ Jawett remains , and is also the editor of the ‘ Precursor , ’ but his new labours so absorb his spare time that he is always at the office of the paper . So it is pretty well all over with the table at Joe ’s . I confess I could not stand it any longer , particularly after you left . I have got into the junior Pan - Ionian ; and I am down for the senior ; I can not get in for ten years , but when I do it will be a coup ; the society there is tiptop , a cabinet minister sometimes , and very often a bishop . ”
106630	106639	106640	106640	he	376	“ It is some time since we met , ”
106643	106671	106640	106640	he	376	“ but I have heard of you . You are now a public man , and not a public character . That is a not unsatisfactory position . ”
106908	107539	106904	106905	The baron	1176	“ You have heard to - day a great deal about the Latin race , their wondrous qualities , their peculiar destiny , their possible danger . It is a new idea , or rather a new phrase , that I observe is now getting into the political world , and is probably destined to produce consequences . No man will treat with indifference the principle of race . It is the key of history , and why history is often so confused is that it has been written by men who were ignorant of this principle and all the knowledge it involves . As one who may become a statesman and assist in governing mankind , it is necessary that you should not be insensible to it ; whether you encounter its influence in communities or in individuals , its qualities must ever be taken into account . But there is no subject which more requires discriminating knowledge , or where your illustrating principle , if you are not deeply founded , may not chance to turn out a will - o’-the - wisp . Now this great question of the Latin race , by which M. de Vallombrosa may succeed in disturbing the world — it might be well to inquire where the Latin race is to be found . In the North of Italy , peopled by Germans and named after Germans , or in the South of Italy , swarming with the descendants of Normans and Arabs ? Shall we find the Latin race in Spain , stocked by Goths , and Moors , and Jews ? Or in France , where there is a great Celtic nation , occasionally mingled with Franks ? Now I do not want to go into the origin of man and nations — I am essentially practical , and only endeavour to comprehend that with which I have personally to deal , and that is sufficiently difficult . In Europe I find three great races with distinct qualities — the Teutons , the Sclaves , and the Celts ; and their conduct will be influenced by those distinctive qualities . There is another great race which influences the world , the Semites . Certainly , when I was at the Congress of Vienna , I did not believe that the Arabs were more likely to become a conquering race again than the Tartars , and yet it is a question at this moment whether Mehemet Ali , at their head , may not found a new empire in the Mediterranean . The Semites are unquestionably a great race , for among the few things in this world which appear to be certain , nothing is more sure than that they invented our alphabet . But the Semites now exercise a vast influence over affairs by their smallest though most peculiar family , the Jews . There is no race gifted with so much tenacity , and such skill in organisation . These qualities have given them an unprecedented hold over property and illimitable credit . As you advance in life , and get experience in affairs , the Jews will cross you everywhere . They have long been stealing into our secret diplomacy , which they have almost appropriated ; in another quarter of a century they will claim their share of open government . Well , these are races ; men and bodies of men influenced in their conduct by their particular organisation , and which must enter into all the calculations of a statesman . But what do they mean by the Latin race ? Language and religion do not make a race — there is only one thing which makes a race , and that is blood . ”
107540	107545	107547	107547	Endymion	425	“ But the prince , ”
107550	107577	107547	107547	Endymion	425	“ he seemed much interested in what M. de Vallombrosa was saying ; I should like to know what his opinions are about the Latin race . ”
107578	107586	107588	107589	the baron	1176	“ The prince rarely gives an opinion , ”
107591	107609	107588	107589	the baron	1176	“ Indeed , as you well know , he rarely speaks ; he thinks and he acts . ”
107610	107619	107621	107621	Endymion	425	“ But if he acts on wrong information , ”
107623	107632	107621	107621	Endymion	425	“ there will probably be only one consequence . ”
107633	107640	107642	107643	the baron	1176	“ The prince is very wise , ”
107645	107738	107642	107643	the baron	1176	“ and , trust me , knows as much about mankind , and the varieties of mankind , as any one . He may not believe in the Latin race , but he may choose to use those who do believe in it . The weakness of the prince , if he have one , is not want of knowledge , or want of judgment , but an over - confidence in his star , which sometimes seduces him into enterprises which he himself feels at the time are not perfectly sound . ”
108035	108040	108042	108042	he	4112	“ The fact is , ”
108046	108063	108042	108042	he	4112	“ I wish we had such a fellow on our bench in the House of Commons . ”
108509	108514	108520	108520	she	499	“ A strange event ! ”
108534	108561	108520	108520	she	499	“ But not stranger than what has happened to ourselves . Fortune seems to attend on our ruined home . I thought the bride looked beautiful . ”
108566	108577	108579	108580	Lady Roehampton	499	“ You are not gay this morning , my dear , ”
108582	108656	108579	108580	Lady Roehampton	499	“ they say that weddings are depressing . Now I am in rather high spirits . I am very glad that Imogene has become Lady Beaumaris . She is beautiful , and dangerously beautiful . Do you know , my Endymion , I have had some uneasy moments about this young lady . Women are prescient in these matters , and I have observed with anxiety that you admired her too much yourself . ”
108657	108668	108670	108670	Endymion	425	“ I am sure you had no reason , Myra , ”
108675	108732	108734	108734	Myra	466	“ Certainly not from what you said , my dear . It was from what you did not say that I became alarmed . You seldom mentioned her name , and when I referred to her , you always turned the conversation . However , that is all over now . She is Countess of Beaumaris , ”
108746	108848	108734	108734	Myra	466	“ and may be a powerful friend to you ; and I am Countess of Roehampton , and am your friend , also not quite devoid of power . And there are other countesses , I suspect , on whose good wishes you may rely . If we can not shape your destiny , there is no such thing as witchcraft . No , Endymion , marriage is a mighty instrument in your hands . It must not be lightly used . Come in and lunch ; my lord is at home , and I know he wants to see you . ”
109655	109663	109665	109665	Endymion	425	“ Have you heard what they say ? ”
109671	109684	109665	109665	Endymion	425	“ Yes , I heard ; but do not look so grave . ”
109685	109691	109636	109642	The leader of the House of Commons	4177	“ Do I look grave ? ”
109692	109701	109665	109665	Endymion	425	“ As if it were the last day . ”
109702	109708	109665	109665	Endymion	425	“ I fear it is . ”
109709	109755	109636	109642	The leader of the House of Commons	4177	“ I am not so sure . I doubt whether Sir Robert thinks it ripe enough ; and after all , we are not in a minority . I do not see why we should have resigned . I wish I could see Lord Roehampton . ”
109967	109973	109974	109974	she	335	“ It was clearly impossible , ”
109977	110014	109974	109974	she	335	“ for Sir Robert to carry on affairs with such a Duchesse de Longueville always at the ear of our young Queen , under the pretence forsooth of being the friend of Her Majesty ’s youth . ”
110053	110059	110061	110062	Lady Montfort	499	“ But we must reconstruct , ”
110068	110080	110081	110081	she	335	“ Sidney Wilton must be Secretary of State . And you , ”
110098	110123	110081	110081	she	335	“ you will go with him . It is a great thing at your age to be private secretary to a Secretary of State . ”
111014	111022	111024	111025	Prince Florestan	356	“ I owe my knighthood to you , ”
111030	111042	111024	111025	Prince Florestan	356	“ as I do everything in this country that is agreeable . ”
111043	111051	111053	111054	Lady Roehampton	499	“ You can not be my knight , ”
111056	111077	111053	111054	Lady Roehampton	499	“ because I am told I am the sovereign of all the chivalry , but you have my best wishes . ”
111078	111086	111088	111089	the prince	7878	“ All that I want in life , ”
111091	111097	111088	111089	the prince	7878	“ are your good wishes . ”
111098	111105	111053	111054	Lady Roehampton	499	“ I fear they are barren . ”
111106	111113	111115	111116	the prince	7878	“ No , they are inspiring , ”
111121	111141	111115	111116	the prince	7878	“ You brought me good fortune . From the moment I saw you , light fell upon my life . ”
111142	111150	111152	111153	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Is not that an exaggerated phrase ? ”
111158	111171	111152	111153	Lady Roehampton	499	“ because I happened to get you a ticket for a masquerade . ”
111172	111180	111182	111183	the prince	7878	“ I was thinking of something else , ”
111186	111199	111182	111183	the prince	7878	“ but life is a masquerade ; at least mine has been . ”
111200	111213	111215	111216	Lady Roehampton	499	“ I think yours , sir , is a most interesting life , ”
111218	111233	111215	111216	Lady Roehampton	499	“ and , were I you , I would not quarrel with my destiny . ”
111234	111241	111243	111244	the prince	7878	“ My destiny is not fulfilled , ”
111246	111265	111243	111244	the prince	7878	“ I have never quarrelled with it , and am least disposed to do so at this moment . ”
111266	111295	111182	111183	the prince	7878	“ Mr. Sidney Wilton was speaking to me very much the other day about your royal mother , sir , Queen Agrippina . She must have been fascinating . ”
111296	111302	111304	111305	the prince	7878	“ I like fascinating women , ”
111307	111313	111304	111305	the prince	7878	“ but they are rare . ”
111314	111324	111326	111327	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Perhaps it is better it should be so , ”
111329	111342	111326	111327	Lady Roehampton	499	“ for they are apt — are they not?—to disturb the world . ”
111343	111352	111354	111355	the prince	7878	“ I confess I like to be bewitched , ”
111357	111370	111354	111355	the prince	7878	“ and I do not care how much the world is disturbed . ”
111371	111383	111385	111386	Lady Roehampton	499	“ But is not the world very well as it is ? ”
111388	111399	111385	111386	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Why should we not be happy and enjoy it ? ”
111400	111406	111408	111409	Prince Florestan	356	“ I do enjoy it , ”
111411	111443	111408	111409	Prince Florestan	356	“ especially at Montfort Castle ; I suppose there is something in the air that agrees with one . But enjoyment of the present is consistent with objects for the future . ”
111444	111470	111354	111355	the prince	7878	“ Ah ! now you are thinking of your great affairs — of your kingdom . My woman ’s brain is not equal to that . ”
111471	111482	111484	111485	the prince	7878	“ I think your brain is quite equal to kingdoms , ”
111500	111581	111484	111485	the prince	7878	“ but I was not thinking of my kingdom . I leave that to fate ; I believe it is destined to be mine , and therefore occasions me thought but not anxiety . I was thinking of something else than kingdoms , and of which unhappily I am not so certain — of which I am most uncertain — of which I fear I have no chance — and yet which is dearer to me than even my crown . ”
111582	111588	111590	111591	Lady Roehampton	499	“ What can that be ? ”
111597	111605	111607	111608	Prince Florestan	356	“ ‘ Tis a secret of chivalry , ”
111610	111618	111607	111608	Prince Florestan	356	“ and I must never disclose it . ”
111619	111626	111628	111629	Adriana Neuchatel	481	“ It is a wonderful scene , ”
111643	111673	111631	111631	Endymion	561	“ I had no idea that I should be so much amused by anything in society . But then , it is so unlike anything one has ever seen . ”
112133	112140	112142	112142	Endymion	561	“ And who is your knight ? ”
112148	112159	112144	112144	Adriana	481	“ I mean , whom do you wish to win ? ”
112160	112171	112142	112142	Endymion	561	“ Oh , I should like them all to win ! ”
112172	112203	112144	112144	Adriana	481	“ That is good - natured , but then there would be no distinction . I know who is going to wear your colours — the Knight of the Dolphin . ”
112204	112214	112216	112216	Adriana	481	“ I hope nothing of that kind will happen , ”
112220	112257	112216	112216	Adriana	481	“ I know that some of the knights are going to wear ladies ’ colours , but I trust no one will think of wearing mine . I know the Black Knight wears Lady Montfort ’s . ”
112258	112263	112265	112265	Endymion	561	“ He can not , ”
112268	112318	112265	112265	Endymion	561	“ She is first lady to the Queen of Beauty ; no knight can wear the colours of the Queen . I asked Sir Morte d’Arthur himself , and he told me there was no doubt about it , and that he had consulted Garter before he came down . ”
112319	112335	112337	112337	Adriana	481	“ Well , all I know is that the Count of Ferroll told me so , ”
112339	112348	112337	112337	Adriana	481	“ I sate next to him at dinner . ”
112349	112357	112359	112359	Endymion	561	“ He shall not wear her colours , ”
112363	112377	112359	112359	Endymion	561	“ I will speak to the King of the Tournament about it directly . ”
112378	112386	112388	112388	Adriana	481	“ Why , what does it signify ? ”
112390	112408	112388	112388	Adriana	481	“ You thought it signified when I told you Regy Sutton was going to wear your colours . ”
112409	112419	112421	112421	Adriana	481	“ Ah ! that is quite a different business , ”
112660	112676	112678	112679	Lord Roehampton	499	“ All I know is , she will never pardon you for not asking her , ”
112681	112716	112678	112679	Lord Roehampton	499	“ I saw Bicester the day I left town , and he was very grumpy . He said that Lady Bicester was the only person who understood tournaments . She had studied the subject . ”
112717	112729	112731	112731	Berengaria	504	“ I suppose she wanted to be the Queen of Beauty , ”
112733	112757	112731	112731	Berengaria	504	“ You are too severe , my dear lady . I think she would have been contented with a knight wearing her colours . ”
112758	112767	112769	112769	Berengaria	504	“ Well , I can not help it , ”
112784	112790	112731	112731	Berengaria	504	“ She is too ugly . ”
112791	112815	112731	112731	Berengaria	504	“ Why , she came to my fancy ball , and it is not five years ago , as Mary Queen of Scots ! ”
112816	112827	112829	112829	Berengaria	504	“ That must have been after the Queen ’s decapitation , ”
112831	112840	112842	112843	Mr. Wilton	326	“ I wonder you did not ask Zenobia , ”
112845	112911	112842	112843	Mr. Wilton	326	“ Of course I asked her , but I knew she would not come . She is in one of her hatreds now . She said she would have come , only she had half - promised to give a ball to the tenants at Merrington about that time , and she did not like to disappoint them . Quite touching , was it not ? ”
112912	112921	112923	112924	Mr. Wilton	326	“ A touch beyond the reach of art , ”
112926	112935	112923	112924	Mr. Wilton	326	“ almost worthy of yourself , Lady Montfort . ”
112936	112946	112948	112952	Lord Montfort of Nigel Penruddock	548	“ And what do you think of all this ? ”
112991	113002	113004	113004	Nigel	548	“ I am thinking of what is beneath all this , ”
113006	113085	113004	113004	Nigel	548	“ A great revivication . Chivalry is the child of the Church ; it is the distinctive feature of Christian Europe . Had it not been for the revival of Church principles , this glorious pageant would never have occurred . But it is a pageant only to the uninitiated . There is not a ceremony , a form , a phrase , a costume , which is not symbolic of a great truth or a high purpose . ”
113086	113099	113101	113102	her lord	1542	“ I do not think Lady Montfort is aware of all this , ”
113104	113108	113110	113110	Nigel	548	“ Oh yes ! ”
113112	113148	113110	113110	Nigel	548	“ Lady Montfort is a great woman — a woman who could inspire crusades and create churches . She might , and she will , I trust , rank with the Helenas and the Matildas . ”
113196	113202	113218	113218	he	469	“ Well , Mr. Ferrars , ”
113224	113245	113218	113218	he	469	“ and how are you getting on ? Are we to see you to - morrow in a Milanese suit ? ”
113246	113253	113255	113255	Endymion	425	“ I am only a page , ”
113257	113282	113255	113255	Endymion	425	“ Well , well , the old Italian saying is , ‘ A page beats a knight , ’ at least with the ladies . ”
113283	113292	113294	113294	Endymion	425	“ Do you not think it very absurd , ”
113296	113344	113294	113294	Endymion	425	“ that the Count of Ferroll says he shall wear Lady Montfort ’s colours ? Lady Montfort is only the first lady of the Queen of Beauty , and she can wear no colours except the Queen ’s . Do not you think somebody ought to interfere ? ”
113345	113361	113363	113364	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ Hem ! The Count of Ferroll is a man who seldom makes a mistake , ”
113366	113371	113373	113373	Endymion	425	“ So everybody says , ”
113377	113385	113373	113373	Endymion	425	“ but I do not see that . ”
113386	113396	113398	113399	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ Now , you are a very young man , ”
113401	113488	113398	113399	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ and I hope you will some day be a statesman . I do not see why you should not , if you are industrious and stick to your master , for Mr. Sidney Wilton is a man who will always rise ; but , if I were you , I would keep my eyes very much on the Count of Ferroll , for , depend on it , he is one of those men who sooner or later will make a noise in the world . ”
113535	113549	113528	113528	his	425	“ I am quite sick of the name of the Count of Ferroll . ”
114452	114480	114448	114448	She	4381	“ I shall call you the Knight of the Woeful Countenance if you approach me with such a visage . What can be the matter with you ? ”
114481	114484	114486	114486	Endymion	425	“ Nothing , ”
114502	114547	114492	114496	The Knight of the Dolphin	8530	“ This is a critical affair to - morrow , my dear Lady Montfort . If the Count Ferroll is discomfited by the prince , it may be a casus belli . You ought to get Lord Roehampton to interfere and prevent the encounter . ”
114548	114558	114560	114561	Lady Montfort	499	“ The Count of Ferroll will not be discomfited , ”
114563	114574	114560	114561	Lady Montfort	499	“ He is one of those men who never fail . ”
114575	114583	114585	114589	the Knight of the Dolphin	8530	“ Well , I do not know , ”
114592	114606	114585	114589	the Knight of the Dolphin	8530	“ The prince has a stout lance , and I have felt it . ”
114607	114617	114619	114619	Endymion	425	“ He had the best of it this morning , ”
114623	114647	114619	114619	Endymion	425	“ Every one thought so , and that it was very fortunate for the Count of Ferroll that the heralds closed the lists . ”
114648	114657	114659	114660	Lady Montfort	499	“ It might have been fortunate for others , ”
114662	114669	114670	114670	she	499	“ What is the general opinion ? ”
114680	114701	114619	114619	Endymion	425	“ Do not go away , Mr. Ferrars . I want to give you some directions about to - morrow . ”
114702	114717	114719	114719	Endymion	425	“ I do not think I shall be at the place to - morrow , ”
114721	114724	114719	114719	Endymion	425	“ What ! ”
114740	114776	114732	114734	Mr. Sidney Wilton	326	“ I have been looking at the golden helm . It is entrusted to my care as King of the Tournament . It is really so beautiful , that I think I shall usurp it . ”
114777	114790	114792	114792	Berengaria	504	“ You will have to settle that with the Count of Ferroll , ”
114794	114801	114803	114807	the Knight of the Dolphin	8530	“ The betting is about equal , ”
114809	114820	114822	114822	Berengaria	504	“ Well , we must have some gloves upon it , ”
114918	114927	114929	114929	Endymion	425	“ I wonder you can speak to him , ”
114937	114966	114929	114929	Endymion	425	“ If the heralds had not — many think , too hastily — closed the lists this morning , you would have been the victor of the day . ”
114967	114977	114979	114980	the prince	7878	“ My dear child ! what can you mean ? ”
114982	115009	114929	114929	Endymion	425	“ I believe everything was closed quite properly , and as for myself , I am entirely satisfied with my share of the day ’s success . ”
115010	115017	115019	115019	Endymion	425	“ If you had thrown him , ”
115021	115034	115019	115019	Endymion	425	“ he could not with decency have contended for the golden helm . ”
115035	115044	115046	115047	the prince	7878	“ Oh ! that is what you deplore , ”
115049	115072	115046	115047	the prince	7878	“ The Count of Ferroll and I shall have to contend for many things more precious than golden helms before we die . ”
115073	115083	115085	115085	Endymion	425	“ I believe he is a very overrated man , ”
115087	115090	115092	115093	the prince	7878	“ Why ? ”
115095	115100	115102	115102	Endymion	425	“ I detest him , ”
115104	115117	115119	115120	the prince	7878	“ That is certainly a reason why you should not overrate him , ”
115122	115133	115135	115135	Endymion	425	“ There seems a general conspiracy to run him up , ”
115139	115151	115153	115154	the prince	7878	“ The Count of Ferroll is the man of the future , ”
115157	115176	115153	115154	the prince	7878	“ That is what Mr. Neuchatel said to me yesterday . I suppose he caught it from you . ”
115177	115200	115202	115203	the prince	7878	“ It is an advantage , a great advantage , for me to observe the Count of Ferroll in this intimate society , ”
115208	115272	115202	115203	the prince	7878	“ perhaps even to fathom him . But I am not come to that yet . He is a man neither to love nor to detest . He has himself an intelligence superior to all passion , I might say all feeling ; and if , in dealing with such a being , we ourselves have either , we give him an advantage . ”
115273	115292	115294	115294	Endymion	425	“ Well , all the same , I hope you will win the golden helm to - morrow , ”
115301	115312	115314	115315	the prince	7878	“ The golden casque that I am ordained to win , ”
115317	115335	115314	115315	the prince	7878	“ is not at Montfort Castle . This , after all , is but Mambrino ’s helmet . ”
115366	115372	115374	115374	one	6769	“ I hope to heaven , ”
115376	115395	115374	115374	one	6769	“ that the Count of Ferroll will beat that foreign chap to - morrow ; I hate foreigners . ”
115396	115401	115403	115404	a second	4406	“ So do I , ”
115415	115429	115431	115431	Endymion	561	“ The Count of Ferroll is as much a foreigner as the prince , ”
115435	115448	115450	115452	the first speaker	4407	“ Oh ! I do n’t call him a foreigner at all , ”
115454	115483	115450	115452	the first speaker	4407	“ He is a great favourite at White ’s ; no one rides cross country like him , and he is a deuced fine shot in the bargain . ”
115484	115498	115500	115500	Endymion	561	“ I will back Prince Florestan against him either in field or cover , ”
115502	115512	115514	115516	the young gentleman	2455	“ Well , I do n’t know your friend , ”
115519	115526	115514	115516	the young gentleman	2455	“ so I can not bet . ”
115527	115548	115550	115553	a third young gentleman	4409	“ I am sure your friend , Lady Montfort , my dear Dymy , will back the Count of Ferroll , ”
116037	116040	116041	116041	He	561	“ Endymion ! ”
116069	116077	116078	116078	she	499	“ What is the matter with you ? ”
116081	116084	116078	116078	she	499	“ Nothing . ”
116085	116114	116047	116048	Lady Montfort	499	“ That is nonsense . Something must have happened . I have missed you so long , but was determined to find you . Have you a headache ? ”
116115	116118	116047	116048	Lady Montfort	499	“ No . ”
116119	116141	116078	116078	she	499	“ Come back ; come back with me . It is so odd . My lord has asked for you twice . ”
116142	116150	116047	116048	Lady Montfort	499	“ I want to see no one . ”
116151	116181	116047	116048	Lady Montfort	499	“ Oh ! but this is absurd — and on a day like this , when every thing has been so successful , and every one is so happy . ”
116182	116194	116078	116078	she	499	“ I am not happy , and I am not successful . ”
116195	116201	116203	116204	Lady Montfort	499	“ You perfectly astonish me , ”
116206	116225	116203	116204	Lady Montfort	499	“ I shall begin to believe that you have not so sweet a temper as I always supposed . ”
116226	116235	116078	116078	she	499	“ It matters not what my temper is . ”
116236	116260	116078	116078	she	499	“ I think it matters a great deal . I like , above all things , to live with good - tempered people . ”
116261	116286	116203	116204	Lady Montfort	499	“ I hope you may not be disappointed . My temper is my own affair , and I am content always to be alone . ”
116287	116297	116078	116078	she	499	“ Why ! you are talking nonsense , Endymion . ”
116298	116330	116078	116078	she	499	“ Probably ; I do not pretend to be gifted . I am not one of those gentlemen who can not fail . I am not the man of the future . ”
116331	116343	116345	116346	Lady Montfort	499	“ Well ! I never was so surprised in my life , ”
116348	116401	116345	116346	Lady Montfort	499	“ I never will pretend to form an opinion of human character again . Now , my dear Endymion , rouse yourself , and come back with me . Give me your arm . I can not stay another moment ; I dare say I have already been wanted a thousand times . ”
116402	116409	116411	116411	Endymion	561	“ I can not go back , ”
116413	116450	116411	116411	Endymion	561	“ I never wish to see anybody again . If you want an arm , there is the Count of Ferroll , and I hope you may find he has a sweeter temper than I have . ”
116483	116487	116488	116488	she	499	“ Silly boy ! ”
116495	116505	116507	116509	Mr. Sidney Wilton	326	“ I do not like the prospect of affairs , ”
116544	116673	116507	116509	Mr. Sidney Wilton	326	“ The decline of the revenue is not fitful ; it is regular . Our people are too apt to look at the state of the revenue merely in a financial point of view . If a surplus , take off taxes ; if a deficiency , put them on . But the state of the revenue should also be considered as the index of the condition of the population . According to my impression , the condition of the people is declining ; and why ? because they are less employed . If this spreads , they will become discontented and disaffected , and I can not help remembering that , if they become troublesome , it is our office that will have to deal with them . ”
116674	116683	116685	116685	Endymion	561	“ This bad harvest is a great misfortune , ”
116687	116785	116685	116685	Endymion	561	“ Yes , but a bad harvest , though unquestionably a great , perhaps the greatest , misfortune for this country , is not the entire solution of our difficulties — I would say , our coming difficulties . A bad harvest touches the whole of our commercial system : it brings us face to face with the corn laws . I wish our chief would give his mind to that subject . I believe a moderate fixed duty of about twelve shillings a quarter would satisfy every one , and nothing then could shake this country . ”
116839	116842	116846	116848	Mr. Sidney Wilton	326	“ the Liberal ”
116893	116907	116889	116889	Berengaria	504	“ Simon is against all laws ; he is not a practical man . ”
116925	117008	116908	116910	Mr. Sidney Wilton	326	“ I was not alarmed about the Chartists last year . Political trouble in this country never frightens me . Insurrections and riots strengthen an English government ; they gave a new lease even to Lord Liverpool when his ministry was most feeble and unpopular ; but economical discontent is quite another thing . The moment sedition arises from taxation , or want of employment , it is more dangerous and more difficult to deal with in this country than any other . ”
117009	117032	117034	117034	Endymion	561	“ Lord Roehampton seemed to take rather a sanguine view of the situation after the Bed - Chamber business in the spring , ”
117045	117055	117057	117058	Mr. Wilton	326	“ Lord Roehampton has other things to think of , ”
117060	117427	117057	117058	Mr. Wilton	326	“ He is absorbed , and naturally absorbed , in his department , the most important in the state , and of which he is master . But I am obliged to look at affairs nearer home . Now , this Anti - Corn - Law League , which they established last year at Manchester , and which begins to be very busy , though nobody at present talks of it , is , in my mind , a movement which ought to be watched . I tell you what ; it occurred to me more than once during that wondrous pageant , that we have just now been taking part in , the government wants better information than they have as to the state of the country , the real feelings and condition of the bulk of the population . We used to sneer at the Tories for their ignorance of these matters , but after all , we , like them , are mainly dependent on quarter sessions ; on the judgment of a lord - lieutenant and the statistics of a bench of magistrates . It is true we have introduced into our subordinate administration at Whitehall some persons who have obtained the reputation of distinguished economists , and we allow them to guide us . But though ingenious men , no doubt , they are chiefly bankrupt tradesmen , who , not having been able to manage their own affairs , have taken upon themselves to advise on the conduct of the country — pedants and prigs at the best , and sometimes impostors . No ; this wo n’t do . It is useless to speak to the chief ; I did about the Anti - Corn - Law League ; he shrugged his shoulders and said it was a madness that would pass . I have made up my mind to send somebody , quite privately , to the great scenes of national labour . He must be somebody whom nobody knows , and nobody suspects of being connected with the administration , or we shall never get the truth — and the person I have fixed upon is yourself . ”
117428	117438	117440	117440	Endymion	561	“ But am I equal to such a task ? ”
117446	117451	117453	117454	Mr. Wilton	326	“ I think so , ”
117456	117592	117453	117454	Mr. Wilton	326	“ or , of course , I would not have fixed upon you . I want a fresh and virgin intelligence to observe and consider the country . It must be a mind free from prejudice , yet fairly informed on the great questions involved in the wealth of nations . I know you have read Adam Smith , and not lightly . Well , he is the best guide , though of course we must adapt his principles to the circumstances with which we have to deal . You have good judgment , great industry , a fairly quick perception , little passion — perhaps hardly enough ; but that is probably the consequence of the sorrows and troubles of early life . But , after all , there is no education like adversity . ”
117593	117604	117606	117606	Endymion	561	“ If it will only cease at the right time , ”
117608	117626	117628	117629	Mr. Wilton	326	“ Well , in that respect , I do not think you have anything to complain of , ”
117631	117725	117628	117629	Mr. Wilton	326	“ The world is all before you , and I mistake if you do not rise . Perseverance and tact are the two qualities most valuable for all men who would mount , but especially for those who have to step out of the crowd . I am sure no one can say you are not assiduous , but I am glad always to observe that you have tact . Without tact you can learn nothing . Tact teaches you when to be silent . Inquirers who are always inquiring never learn anything . ”
118001	118009	118034	118034	he	561	“ I do not like extreme views , ”
118021	118032	118034	118034	he	561	“ In my opinion , we should always avoid extremes ; ”
118057	118301	118034	118034	he	561	“ I am a Liberal ; so we all are here . I supported Lord Grey , and I support Lord Melbourne , and I am , in everything , for a liberal policy . I do n’t like extremes . A wise minister should take off the duty on cotton wool . That is what the country really wants , and then everybody would be satisfied . No ; I know nothing about this League you ask about , and I do not know any one — that is to say , any one respectable — who does . They came to me to lend my name . ‘ No , ’ I said , ‘ gentlemen ; I feel much honoured , but I do not like extremes ; ’ and they went away . They are making a little more noise now , because they have got a man who has the gift of the gab , and the people like to go and hear him speak . But as I said to a friend of mine , who seemed half inclined to join them , ‘ Well ; if I did anything of that sort , I would be led by a Lancashire lad . They have got a foreigner to lead them , a fellow out of Berkshire ; an agitator — and only a print - work after all . No ; that will never do . ’ ”
118443	118453	118455	118456	an operative	4464	“ He is going to speak to - night , ”
118460	118470	118455	118456	an operative	4464	“ That is why there is such an attendance . ”

118514	118523	118525	118526	the operative	4465	“ Well , he is in a way , ”
118528	118575	118525	118526	the operative	4465	“ He has not got Hollaballoo ’s voice , but he knows what he is talking about . I doubt their getting what they are after ; they have not the working classes with them . If they went against truck , it would be something . ”
118674	118679	118681	118682	the operative	4465	“ There he is , ”
118686	118702	118681	118682	the operative	4465	“ you see they like him . Oh , Job knows how to do it ! ”
119086	119095	119073	119073	Endymion	561	“ Tell me — is his name Thornberry ? ”
119096	119104	119106	119107	the operative	4465	“ That is your time of day , ”
119109	119123	119073	119073	Endymion	561	“ Job Thornberry is his name , and I am on his works . ”
119124	119134	119073	119073	Endymion	561	“ And yet you do not agree with him ? ”
119135	119161	119073	119073	Endymion	561	“ Well ; I go as far as he goes , but he does not go so far as I go ; that ’s it . ”
119162	119175	119177	119177	Endymion	561	“ I do not see how a man can go much farther , ”
119179	119207	119177	119177	Endymion	561	“ Where are his works ? I knew your master when he was in the south of England , and I should like to call on him . ”
119208	119212	119214	119215	the operative	4465	“ My employer , ”
119217	119303	119214	119215	the operative	4465	“ They call themselves masters , but we do not . I will tell you . His works are a mile out of town ; but it seems only a step , for there are houses all the way . Job Thornberry & Co. ‘s Print - works , Pendleton Road — any one can guide you — and when you get there , you can ask for me , if you like . I am his overlooker , and my name is ENOCH CRAGGS . ”
119304	119311	119313	119313	Thornberry	396	“ You are not much altered , ”
119329	119631	119323	119323	he	396	“ and yet you have become a man . I suppose I am ten years your senior . I have never been back to the old place , and yet I sometimes think I should like to be buried there . The old man has been here , and more than once , and liked it well enough ; at least , I hope so . He told me a good deal about you all ; some sorrows , and , I hope , some joys . I heard of Miss Myra ’s marriage ; she was a sweet young lady ; the gravest person I ever knew ; I never knew her smile . I remember they thought her proud , but I always had a fancy for her . Well ; she has married a topsawyer — I believe the ablest of them all , and probably the most unprincipled ; though I ought not to say that to you . However , public men are spoken freely of . I wish to Heaven you would get him to leave off tinkering those commercial treaties that he is always making such a fuss about . More pernicious nonsense was never devised by man than treaties of commerce . However , their precious most favoured nation clause will break down the whole concern yet . But you wish to see the works ; I will show them to you myself . There is not much going on now , and the stagnation increases daily . And then , if you are willing , we will go home and have a bit of lunch — I live hard by . My best works are my wife and children : I have made that joke before , as you can well fancy . ”
119829	119836	119838	119838	Thornberry	396	“ And this is my home , ”
119844	119853	119838	119838	Thornberry	396	“ and here is my mistress and the young folks”—pointing
119890	119903	119905	119905	Thornberry	396	“ My eldest is a boy , but he is at school , ”
119907	119926	119905	119905	Thornberry	396	“ I have named him , after one of the greatest men that ever lived , John Hampden . ”
119927	119934	119936	119936	Endymion	561	“ He was a landed proprietor , ”
119940	119946	119936	119936	Endymion	561	“ and a considerable one . ”
119947	119960	119962	119962	Thornberry	396	“ I have brought an old friend to take cheer with us , ”
119964	119982	119984	119984	he	396	“ one whom I knew before any here present ; so show your faces , little people ; ”
120012	120020	119984	119984	he	396	“ Tell the gentleman what you are . ”

120057	120068	120070	120070	Thornberry	396	“ They are chiefly what are called books of reference , ”
120079	120166	120070	120070	Thornberry	396	“ but I have not much room , and , to tell you the truth , they are not merely books of reference to me — I like reading encyclopaedia . The ‘ Dictionary of Dates ’ is a favourite book of mine . The mind sometimes wants tone , and then I read Milton . He is the only poet I read — he is complete , and is enough . I have got his prose works too . Milton was the greatest of Englishmen . ”
120189	120194	120196	120196	Thornberry	396	“ We are teetotallers , ”
120198	120210	120196	120196	Thornberry	396	“ but we can give you a good cup of coffee . ”
120211	120224	120226	120226	Endymion	561	“ I am a teetotaller too at this time of the day , ”
120228	120251	120226	120226	Endymion	561	“ but a good cup of coffee is , they say , the most delicious and the rarest beverage in the world . ”
120252	120255	120257	120257	Thornberry	396	“ Well , ”
120259	120331	120257	120257	Thornberry	396	“ it is a long time since we met , Mr. Ferrars — ten years . I used to think that in ten years one might do anything ; and a year ago , I really thought I had done it ; but the accursed laws of this blessed country , as it calls itself , have nearly broken me , as they have broken many a better man before me . ”
120332	120340	120342	120342	Endymion	425	“ I am sorry to hear this , ”
120344	120354	120342	120342	Endymion	425	“ I trust it is but a passing cloud . ”
120355	120362	120364	120364	Thornberry	396	“ It is not a cloud , ”
120366	120430	120364	120364	Thornberry	396	“ it is a storm , a tempest , a wreck — but not only for me . Your great relative , my Lord Roehampton , must look to it , I can tell you that . What is happening in this country , and is about to happen , will not be cured or averted by commercial treaties — mark my words . ”
120431	120438	120440	120440	Endymion	425	“ But what would cure it ? ”
120442	120470	120440	120440	Endymion	425	“ There is only one thing that can cure this country , and it will soon be too late for that . We must have free exchange . ”
120471	120475	120477	120477	Endymion	425	“ Free exchange ! ”
120480	120487	120489	120489	Thornberry	396	“ Why , look at this , ”
120491	120652	120489	120489	Thornberry	396	“ I had been driving a capital trade with the States for nearly five years . I began with nothing , as you know . I had paid off all my borrowed capital ; my works were my own , and this house is a freehold . A year ago I sent to my correspondent at New York the largest consignment of goods I had ever made and the best , and I can not get the slightest return for them . My correspondent writes to me that there is no end of corn and bread - stuffs which he could send , if we could only receive them ; but he knows very well he might as well try and send them to the moon . The people here are starving and want these bread - stuffs , and they are ready to pay for them by the products of their labour — and your blessed laws prevent them ! ”
120653	120678	120680	120680	Endymion	425	“ But these laws did not prevent your carrying on a thriving trade with America for five years , according to your own account , ”
120682	120698	120680	120680	Endymion	425	“ I do not question what you say ; I am asking only for information . ”
120699	120714	120716	120716	Thornberry	396	“ What you say is fairly said , and it has been said before , ”
120718	120812	120716	120716	Thornberry	396	“ but there is nothing in it . We had a trade , and a thriving trade , with the States ; though , to be sure , it was always fitful and ought to have been ten times as much , even during those five years . But the fact is , the state of affairs in America was then exceptional . They were embarked in great public works in which every one was investing his capital ; shares and stocks abounded , and they paid us for our goods with them . ”
120813	120832	120680	120680	Endymion	425	“ Then it would rather seem that they have no capital now to spare to purchase our goods ? ”
120833	120837	120839	120839	Thornberry	396	“ Not so , ”
120842	120899	120839	120839	Thornberry	396	“ as I have shown ; but were it so , it does not affect my principle . If there were free exchange , we should find employment and compensation in other countries , even if the States were logged , which I do n’t believe thirty millions of people with boundless territory ever can be . ”
120900	120905	120907	120907	Endymion	425	“ But after all , ”
120909	120949	120907	120907	Endymion	425	“ America is as little in favour of free exchange as we are . She may send us her bread - stuffs ; but her laws will not admit our goods , except on the payment of enormous duties . ”
120950	120953	120955	120955	Thornberry	396	“ Pish ! ”
120957	120982	120955	120955	Thornberry	396	“ I do not care this for their enormous duties . Let me have free imports , and I will soon settle their duties . ”
120983	120992	120994	120994	Endymion	425	“ To fight hostile tariffs with free imports , ”
120996	121004	120955	120955	Thornberry	396	“ is not that fighting against odds ? ”
121005	121070	120955	120955	Thornberry	396	“ Not a bit . This country has nothing to do but to consider its imports . Foreigners will not give us their products for nothing ; but as for their tariffs , if we were wise men , and looked to our real interests , their hostile tariffs , as you call them , would soon be falling down like an old wall . ”
121071	121077	121079	121079	Endymion	425	“ Well , I confess , ”
121081	121123	120955	120955	Thornberry	396	“ I have for some time thought the principle of free exchange was a sound one ; but its application in a country like this would be very difficult , and require , I should think , great prudence and moderation . ”
121124	121135	121137	121137	Thornberry	396	“ By prudence and moderation you mean ignorance and timidity , ”
121140	121148	121150	121150	Endymion	425	“ Not exactly that , I hope , ”
121152	121186	121150	121150	Endymion	425	“ but you can not deny that the home market is a most important element in the consideration of our public wealth , and it mainly rests upon the agriculture of the country . ”
121187	121197	121199	121199	Thornberry	396	“ Then it rests upon a very poor foundation , ”
121201	121468	121199	121199	Thornberry	396	“ But if any persons should be more tempted than others by free exchange , it should be the great body of the consumers of this land , who pay unjust and excessive prices for every article they require . No , my dear Mr. Ferrars ; the question is a very simple one , and we may talk for ever , and we shall never alter it . The laws of this country are made by the proprietors of land , and they make them for their own benefit . A man with a large estate is said to have a great stake in the country because some hundreds of people or so are more or less dependent on him . How has he a greater interest in the country than a manufacturer who has sunk 100,000 pounds in machinery , and has a thousand people , as I had , receiving from him weekly wages ? No home market , indeed ! Pah ! it is an affair of rent , and nothing more or less . And England is to be ruined to keep up rents . Are you going ? Well , I am glad we have met . Perhaps we shall have another talk together some day . I shall not return to the works . There is little doing there , and I must think now of other things . The subscriptions to the League begin to come in apace . Say what they like in the House of Commons and the vile London press , the thing is stirring . ”
121488	121493	121494	121494	she	602	“ Never was there , ”
121504	121512	121494	121494	she	602	“ but I hope to go soon . ”

121524	121540	121542	121543	the lady	947	“ All I want to see , and hear , is the Rev. Servetus Frost , ”
121545	121613	121542	121543	the lady	947	“ My idea of perfect happiness is to hear him every Sunday . He comes here sometimes , for his sister is settled here ; a very big mill . He preached here a month ago . Should not I have liked the bishop to have heard him , that ’s all ! But he would not dare to go ; he could not answer a point . ”
121614	121623	121625	121625	Thornberry	602	“ My wife is of the Unitarian persuasion , ”
121627	121682	121625	121625	Thornberry	602	“ I am not . I was born in our Church , and I keep to it ; but I often go to chapel with my wife . As for religion generally , if a man believes in his Maker and does his duty to his neighbours , in my mind that is sufficient . ”
121716	121724	121726	121726	Enoch	600	“ I am going to our institute , ”
121728	121744	121726	121726	Enoch	600	“ I do not know why , but they have put me on the committee . ”
121745	121757	121759	121759	Endymion	425	“ And , I doubt not , they did very wisely , ”
121761	121770	121772	121772	Enoch	600	“ Master Thornberry was glad to see you ? ”
121774	121783	121772	121772	Enoch	600	“ And I was glad to see him . ”
121784	121793	121795	121795	Enoch	600	“ He has got the gift of speech , ”
121797	121805	121795	121795	Enoch	600	“ And that is a great gift . ”
121806	121841	121772	121772	Enoch	600	“ If wisely exercised , and I will not say he is not exercising it wisely . Certainly for his own purpose , but whether that purpose is for the general good — query ? ”
121842	121848	121850	121850	Endymion	425	“ He is against monopoly , ”
121853	121857	121859	121859	Enoch	600	“ Query again ? ”
121861	121872	121859	121859	Enoch	600	“ Well ; he is opposed to the corn laws . ”
121873	121882	121884	121884	Enoch	600	“ The corn laws are very bad laws , ”
121886	121908	121884	121884	Enoch	600	“ and the sooner we get rid of them the better . But there are worse things than the corn laws . ”
121909	121912	121914	121914	Endymion	425	“ Hem ! ”
121916	121923	121925	121925	Enoch	600	“ There are the money laws , ”
121927	121941	121943	121943	Endymion	425	“ I did not know you cared so much about them at Manchester , ”
121945	121958	121943	121943	Endymion	425	“ I thought it was Birmingham that was chiefly interested about currency . ”
121959	121969	121971	121971	Enoch	600	“ I do not care one jot about currency , ”
121973	122053	121971	121971	Enoch	600	“ and , so far as I can judge , the Birmingham chaps talk a deal of nonsense about the matter . Leastwise , they will never convince me that a slip of irredeemable paper is as good as the young queen ’s head on a twenty - shilling piece . I mean the laws that secure the accumulation of capital , by which means the real producers become mere hirelings , and really are little better than slaves . ”
122054	122070	121943	121943	Endymion	425	“ But surely without capital we should all of us be little better than slaves ? ”
122071	122078	122080	122080	Enoch	600	“ I am not against capital , ”
122082	122090	122080	122080	Enoch	600	“ What I am against is capitalists . ”
122091	122107	121943	121943	Endymion	425	“ But if we get rid of capitalists we shall soon get rid of capital . ”
122108	122113	122115	122115	Enoch	600	“ No , no , ”
122132	122379	122123	122123	his	600	“ Master Thornberry has been telling you that . He is the most inveterate capitalist of the whole lot ; and I always say , though they keep aloof from him at present , they will be all sticking to his skirts before long . Master Thornberry is against the capitalists in land ; but there are other capitalists nearer home , and I know more about them . I was reading a book the other day about King Charles — Charles the First , whose head they cut off — I am very liking to that time , and read a good deal about it ; and there was Lord Falkland , a great gentleman in those days , and he said , when Archbishop Laud was trying on some of his priestly tricks , that , ‘ if he were to have a pope , he would rather the pope were at Rome than at Lambeth . ’ So I sometimes think , if we are to be ruled by capitalists , I would sooner , perhaps , be ruled by gentlemen of estate , who have been long among us , than by persons who build big mills , who come from God knows where , and , when they have worked their millions out of our flesh and bone , go God knows where . But perhaps we shall get rid of them all some day — landlords and mill - lords . ”
122380	122389	122396	122396	Enoch	600	“ And whom will you substitute for them ? ”
122390	122394	122396	122396	Enoch	600	“ The producers , ”
122407	122415	122396	122396	Enoch	600	“ What can workmen do without capital ? ”
122416	122424	122426	122426	Enoch	600	“ Why , they make the capital , ”
122428	122525	122426	122426	Enoch	600	“ and if they make the capital , is it not strange that they should not be able to contrive some means to keep the capital ? Why , Job was saying the other day that there was nothing like a principle to work upon . It would carry all before it . So say I. And I have a principle too , though it is not Master Thornberry ’s . But it will carry all before it , though it may not be in my time . But I am not so sure of that . ”
122526	122532	122534	122534	Endymion	425	“ And what is it ? ”
122536	122541	122534	122534	Endymion	425	“ CO - OPERATION . ”
122707	122713	122715	122715	Thornberry	604	“ What you should do , ”
122723	122788	122715	122715	Thornberry	604	“ is to go to Scotland ; go to the Glasgow district ; that city itself , and Paisley , and Kilmarnock — keep your eye on Paisley . I am much mistaken if there will not soon be a state of things there which alone will break up the whole concern . It will burst it , sir ; it will burst it . ”
122966	122969	122970	122970	she	499	“ Only , ”
122973	123245	122970	122970	she	499	“ take care not to be doctrinaire , Endymion . I am always afraid of that with you . It is Sidney ’s fault ; he always was doctrinaire . It was a great thing for you becoming his private secretary ; to be the private secretary of a cabinet minister is a real step in life , and I shall always be most grateful to Sidney , whom I love for appointing you ; but still , if I could have had my wish , you should have been Lord Roehampton ’s private secretary . That is real politics , and he is a real statesman . You must not let Mr. Wilton mislead you about the state of affairs in the cabinet . The cabinet consists of the prime minister and Lord Roehampton , and , if they are united , all the rest is vapour . And they will not consent to any nonsense about touching the corn laws ; you may be sure of that . Besides , I will tell you a secret , which is not yet Pulchinello ’s secret , though I daresay it will be known when we all return to town — we shall have a great event when parliament meets ; a royal marriage . What think you of that ? The young queen is going to be married , and to a young prince , like a prince in a fairy tale . As Lord Roehampton wrote to me this morning , ‘ Our royal marriage will be much more popular than the Anti - Corn - Law League . ’ ”

The things he fears will never happen ; or , if they do , will turn out to be unimportant . Look to Lord Roehampton ; he is the man . He does not care a rush whether the revenue increases or declines . He is thinking of real politics : foreign affairs ; maintaining our power in Europe . Something will happen , before the session is over , in the Mediterranean ; ”

124271	124280	124281	124281	he	606	“ She is an old friend of mine , ”
124284	124309	124266	124266	she	499	“ How could you have known her ? She was a shop - girl , was not she , or something of that sort ? ”
124310	124333	124335	124335	Endymion	606	“ She and her family were very kind to me when I was not much better than a shop - boy myself , ”
124342	124358	124335	124335	Endymion	606	“ They are most respectable people , and I have a great regard for her . ”
124359	124374	124380	124380	she	504	“ Indeed ! Well ; I will not keep you from your Tory woman , ”
124560	124564	124565	124565	she	499	“ What nonsense ! ”
124569	124654	124565	124565	she	499	“ Mr. Sidney Wilton talks about the revenue falling off ! As if the revenue could ever really fall off ! And then our bad harvests . Why , that is the very reason we shall have an excellent harvest this year . You can not go on always having bad harvests . Besides , good harvests never make a ministry popular . Nobody thanks a ministry for a good harvest . What makes a ministry popular is some great coup in foreign affairs . ”
124762	124776	124777	124777	she	499	“ There will be a reaction some day from all this political economy , ”
124781	124795	124777	124777	she	499	“ and then there will be no one ready to take the helm . ”
125054	125062	125048	125050	the great dame	4591	“ always at that Lady Beaumaris ’s . ”
125185	125194	125195	125195	she	504	“ I like a man to be practical , ”
125198	125230	125195	125195	she	504	“ When I asked for a deanery for him the other day , the prime minister said he could hardly make a man a dean who believed in the Real Presence . ”
125267	125274	125244	125249	a large body of the clergy	4598	“ great coup in foreign affairs , ”
125375	125387	125389	125389	Zenobia	335	“ I am glad it did not occur in the season , ”
125391	125403	125389	125389	Zenobia	335	“ I really could not stand Lady Montfort if it were May. ”
125580	125589	125591	125592	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ I tell you what , Mr. Endymion , ”
125594	125617	125591	125592	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ you should make Lord Roehampton your Chancellor of the Exchequer , and then your government might perhaps go on a little . ”
125715	125729	125731	125731	Berengaria	504	“ Lord Roehampton thinks that something must be done about the corn laws , ”
125740	125762	125731	125731	Berengaria	504	“ but they will try sugar and timber first . I think it all nonsense , but nonsense is sometimes necessary . ”
125842	125861	125838	125839	Lord Roehampton	499	“ We may as well try it , because the alternative is , we shall have to resign . ”
126385	126408	126368	126369	His servant	2475	“ I must see you instantly . I am here in the brougham , Cork Street end . Come directly . B. M. ”
126436	126443	126445	126446	Lady Montfort	499	“ You had better get in , ”
126448	126465	126466	126466	she	499	“ for in these stirring times some of the enemy may be passing . And now , ”
126476	126491	126466	126466	she	499	“ nobody knows it , not five people . They are going to dissolve . ”
126492	126496	126498	126498	Endymion	425	“ To dissolve ! ”
126500	126506	126498	126498	Endymion	425	“ Will that help us ? ”
126507	126511	126513	126513	Berengaria	504	“ Very likely , ”
126515	126586	126513	126513	Berengaria	504	“ We have had our share of bad luck , and now we may throw in . Cheap bread is a fine cry . Indeed it is too shocking that there should be laws which add to the price of what everybody agrees is the staff of life . But you do nothing but stare , Endymion ; I thought you would be in a state of the greatest excitement ! ”
126587	126595	126498	126498	Endymion	425	“ I am rather stunned than excited . ”
126596	126671	126513	126513	Berengaria	504	“ Well , but you must not be stunned , you must act . This is a crisis for our party , but it is something more for you . It is your climacteric . They may lose ; but you must win , if you will only bestir yourself . See the whips directly , and get the most certain seat you can . Nothing must prevent your being in the new parliament . ”
126672	126680	126682	126682	Endymion	425	“ I see everything to prevent it , ”
126684	126700	126682	126682	Endymion	425	“ I have no means of getting into parliament — no means of any kind . ”
126701	126707	126709	126710	Lady Montfort	499	“ Means must be found , ”
126712	126786	126709	126710	Lady Montfort	499	“ We can not stop now to talk about means . That would be a mere waste of time . The thing must be done . I am now going to your sister , to consult with her . All you have got to do is to make up your mind that you will be in the next parliament , and you will succeed ; for everything in this world depends upon will . ”
126787	126798	126800	126800	Endymion	425	“ I think everything in this world depends upon woman , ”
126802	126809	126811	126811	Berengaria	504	“ It is the same thing , ”
126855	126864	126866	126867	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Well ; I was prepared for it , ”
126869	126887	126866	126867	Lady Roehampton	499	“ I have always been expecting something ever since what they called the Bed - Chamber Plot . ”
126888	126897	126899	126900	Lady Montfort	499	“ Well ; it gave us two years , ”
126902	126910	126899	126900	Lady Montfort	499	“ and we are not out yet . ”
127020	127026	127028	127029	Lady Roehampton	499	“ So , dearest Adriana , ”
127031	127047	127028	127029	Lady Roehampton	499	“ we will drive out together at three o’clock . I will call on you . ”
127052	127057	127059	127060	Lady Montfort	499	“ You know it ? ”
127066	127098	127059	127060	Lady Montfort	499	“ Of course you know it . Besides , I know you know it . What I have come about is this ; your brother must be in the new parliament . ”
127099	127114	127116	127116	Myra	466	“ I have not seen him ; I have not mentioned it to him , ”
127121	127134	127136	127137	Lady Montfort	499	“ I have seen him ; I have mentioned it to him , ”
127140	127178	127136	127137	Lady Montfort	499	“ He makes difficulties ; there must be none . He will consult you . I came on at once that you might be prepared . No difficulty must be admitted . His future depends on it . ”
127179	127186	127188	127189	Lady Roehampton	499	“ I live for his future , ”
127191	127331	127188	127189	Lady Roehampton	499	“ He will talk to you about money . These things always cost money . As a general rule , nobody has money who ought to have it . I know dear Lord Roehampton is very kind to you ; but , all his life , he never had too much money at his command ; though why , I never could make out . And my lord has always had too much money ; but I do not much care to talk to him about these affairs . The thing must be done . What is the use of a diamond necklace if you can not help a friend into parliament ? But all I want to know now is that you will throw no difficulties in his way . Help him , too , if you can . ”
127332	127339	127341	127341	Myra	466	“ I wish Endymion had married , ”
127343	127356	127358	127359	Lady Montfort	499	“ Well ; I do not see how that would help affairs , ”
127361	127374	127358	127359	Lady Montfort	499	“ Besides , I dislike married men . They are very uninteresting . ”
127375	127382	127384	127385	Lady Roehampton	499	“ I mean , I wish , ”
127388	127397	127384	127385	Lady Roehampton	499	“ that he had made a great match . ”
127398	127405	127407	127408	Lady Montfort	499	“ That is not very easy , ”
127410	127428	127407	127408	Lady Montfort	499	“ and great matches are generally failures . All the married heiresses I have known have shipwrecked . ”
127429	127443	127445	127445	Myra	466	“ And yet it is possible to marry an heiress and love her , ”
127447	127456	127445	127445	Myra	466	“ It is possible , but very improbable . ”
127457	127473	127407	127408	Lady Montfort	499	“ I think one might easily love the person who has just left the room . ”
127474	127478	127407	127408	Lady Montfort	499	“ Miss Neuchatel ? ”
127479	127489	127445	127445	Myra	466	“ Adriana . Do not you agree with me ? ”
127490	127497	127499	127500	Lady Montfort	499	“ Miss Neuchatel will never marry , ”
127502	127509	127499	127500	Lady Montfort	499	“ unless she loses her fortune . ”
127510	127551	127553	127554	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Well ; do you know , I have sometimes thought that she liked Endymion ? I never could encourage such a feeling ; and Endymion , I am sure , would not . I wish , I almost wish , ”
127562	127588	127553	127554	Lady Roehampton	499	“ that you would use your magic influence , dear Lady Montfort , and bring it about . He would soon get into parliament then . ”
127589	127599	127601	127602	Lady Montfort	499	“ I have tried to marry Miss Neuchatel once , ”
127609	127628	127601	127602	Lady Montfort	499	“ and I am glad to say I did not succeed . My match - making is over . ”
127744	127750	127729	127729	she	499	“ It must be done . ”
127771	127776	127777	127777	she	499	“ Dearest Lady Roehampton , ”
127780	127799	127777	127777	she	499	“ dearest Myra ! I knew you would agree with me . Yes ! it must be done . ”
127800	127810	127812	127812	Myra	466	“ You will see him perhaps before I do ? ”
127816	127827	127829	127830	Lady Montfort	499	“ I see him every day at the same time , ”
127832	127887	127829	127830	Lady Montfort	499	“ He generally walks down to the House of Commons with Mr. Wilton , and when they have answered questions , and he has got all the news of the lobby , he comes to me . I always manage to get home from my drive to give him half an hour before dinner . ”
127940	127948	127949	127949	she	499	“ Is there anything I can do ? ”
127953	127978	127949	127949	she	499	“ command me without compunction . Is it any use giving any parties ? Can I write any letters ? Can I see anybody ? ”
127979	127990	127992	127993	the secretary	4665	“ If you could stir up my lord a little ? ”
127996	128003	128005	128006	Lady Montfort	499	“ Well , that is difficult , ”
128008	128033	128005	128006	Lady Montfort	499	“ perhaps impossible . But you have all his influence , and when there is a point that presses you must let me know . ”
128034	128044	128046	128047	the secretary	4665	“ If he would only speak to his agents ? ”
128049	128083	128046	128047	the secretary	4665	“ but they say he will not , and he has a terrible fellow in — — shire , who I hear is one of the stewards for a dinner to Sir Robert . ”
128084	128091	128093	128094	Lady Montfort	499	“ I have stopped all that , ”
128096	128136	128093	128094	Lady Montfort	499	“ That was Odo ’s doing , who is himself not very sound ; full of prejudices about O’Connell , and all that stuff . But he must go with his party . You need not fear about him . ”
128137	128148	128150	128151	the secretary	4665	“ Well ! it is a leap in the dark , ”
128153	128158	128160	128161	Lady Montfort	499	“ Oh ! no , ”
128163	128220	128160	128161	Lady Montfort	499	“ all will go right . A starving people must be in favour of a government who will give them bread for nothing . By the by , there is one thing , my dear Mr. Secretary , you must remember . I must have one seat , a certain seat , reserved for my nomination . ”
128221	128233	128235	128236	the secretary	4665	“ A certain seat in these days is a rare gem , ”
128238	128248	128250	128251	Lady Montfort	499	“ Yes , but I must have it nevertheless , ”
128253	128271	128250	128251	Lady Montfort	499	“ I do n’t care about the cost or the trouble — but it must be certain . ”
128328	128337	128338	128338	she	499	“ I wish you could come to luncheon , ”
128341	128400	128338	128338	she	499	“ but I suppose that is impossible ; you are always so busy . Why were you not in the Foreign Office ? I am now going to call on the Tory women to see how they look , but I shall be at home a good while before seven , and of course count on seeing you . ”
128472	128479	128481	128482	Mr. Wilton	326	“ It is a great secret , ”
128484	128681	128481	128482	Mr. Wilton	326	“ but I think I ought to tell you ; instead of resigning , the government have decided to dissolve . I think it a mistake , but I stand by my friends . They believe the Irish vote will be very large , and with cheap bread will carry us through . I think the stronger we shall be in Ireland the weaker we shall be in England , and I doubt whether our cheap bread will be cheap enough . These Manchester associations have altered the aspect of affairs . I have been thinking a good deal about your position . I should like , before we broke up , to have seen you provided for by some permanent office of importance in which you might have been useful to the state , but it is difficult to manage these things suddenly . However , now we have time at any rate to look about us . Still , if I could have seen you permanently attached to this office in a responsible position , I should have been glad . I impressed upon the chief yesterday that you are most fit for it . ”
128682	128721	128722	128723	Lady Montfort	499	“ Oh ! do not think of me , dear sir ; you have been always too kind to me . I shall be content with my lot . All I shall regret is ceasing to serve you . ”
128751	128961	128738	128738	She	499	“ I fear I am very late , but if you had gone away I should never have pardoned you . I have been kept by listening to all the new appointments from Lady Bellasyse . They quite think we are out ; you may be sure I did not deny it . I have so much to tell you . Come into my lord ’s room ; he is away fishing . Think of fishing at such a crisis ! I can not tell you how pleased I was with my visit to Lady Roehampton . She quite agreed with me in everything . ‘ It must be done , ’ she said . How very right ! and I have almost done it . I will have a certain seat ; no chances . Let us have something to fall back upon . If not in office we shall be in opposition . All men must sometime or other be in opposition . There you will form yourself . It is a great thing to have had some official experience . It will save you from mares ’ nests , and I will give parties without end , and never rest till I see you prime minister . ”
128985	129062	128982	128982	she	4677	“ But what is the matter with you , Endymion ? you look quite sad . You do not mean you really take our defeat — which is not certain yet — so much to heart . Believe me , opposition has its charms ; indeed , I sometimes think the principal reason why I have enjoyed our ministerial life so much is , that it has been from the first a perpetual struggle for existence . ”
129063	129078	129080	129080	Endymion	425	“ I do not pretend to be quite indifferent to the probably impending change , ”
129082	129101	128982	128982	she	4677	“ but I can not say there is anything about it which would affect my feelings very deeply . ”
129102	129109	128982	128982	she	4677	“ What is it , then ? ”
129110	129126	129128	129128	Endymion	425	“ It is this business about which you and Myra are so kindly interesting yourselves , ”
129133	129144	129128	129128	Endymion	425	“ I do not think I could go into parliament . ”
129145	129151	129153	129154	Lady Montfort	499	“ Not go into parliament ! ”
129156	129175	129153	129154	Lady Montfort	499	“ Why , what are men made for except to go into parliament ? I am indeed astounded . ”
129176	129183	129185	129185	Endymion	425	“ I do not disparage parliament , ”
129187	129212	129185	129185	Endymion	425	“ much the reverse . It is a life that I think would suit me , and I have often thought the day might come ”
129215	129221	129223	129224	Lady Montfort	499	“ The day has come , ”
129226	129265	129223	129224	Lady Montfort	499	“ and not a bit too soon . Mr. Fox went in before he was of age , and all young men of spirit should do the same . Why ! you are two - and - twenty ! ”
129266	129273	129275	129275	Endymion	425	“ It is not my age , ”
129278	129309	129275	129275	Endymion	425	“ I am not afraid about that , for from the life which I have led of late years , I know a good deal about the House of Commons . ”
129310	129319	129321	129322	Lady Montfort	499	“ Then what is it , dear Endymion ? ”
129325	129336	129338	129338	Endymion	425	“ It will make a great change in my life , ”
129345	129357	129338	129338	Endymion	425	“ and one which I do not feel justified in accepting . ”
129358	129375	129377	129378	Lady Montfort	499	“ I repeat to you , that you need give yourself no anxiety about the seat , ”
129380	129447	129377	129378	Lady Montfort	499	“ It will not cost you a shilling . I and your sister have arranged all that . As she very wisely said , ‘ It must be done , ’ and it is done . All you have to do is to write an address , and make plenty of speeches , and you are M.P. for life , or as long as you like . ”
129448	129500	129275	129275	Endymion	425	“ Possibly ; a parliamentary adventurer , I might swim or I might sink ; the chances are it would be the latter , for storms would arise , when those disappear who have no root in the country , and no fortune to secure them breathing time and a future . ”
129501	129533	129377	129378	Lady Montfort	499	“ Well , I did not expect , when you handed me out of my carriage to - day , that I was going to listen to a homily on prudence . ”
129534	129544	129546	129546	Endymion	425	“ It is not very romantic , I own , ”
129548	129641	129377	129378	Lady Montfort	499	“ but my prudence is at any rate not a commonplace caught up from copy - books . I am only two - and - twenty , but I have had some experience , and it has been very bitter . I have spoken to you , dearest lady , sometimes of my earlier life , for I wished you to be acquainted with it , but I observed also you always seemed to shrink from such confidence , and I ceased from touching on what I saw did not interest you . ”
129642	129809	129377	129378	Lady Montfort	499	“ Quite a mistake . It greatly interested me . I know all about you and everything . I know you were not always a clerk in a public office , but the spoiled child of splendour . I know your father was a dear good man , but he made a mistake , and followed the Duke of Wellington instead of Mr. Canning . Had he not , he would probably be alive now , and certainly Secretary of State , like Mr. Sidney Wilton . But you must not make a mistake , Endymion . My business in life , and your sister ’s too , is to prevent your making mistakes . And you are on the eve of making a very great one if you lose this golden opportunity . Do not think of the past ; you dwell on it too much . Be like me , live in the present , and when you dream , dream of the future . ”
129810	129835	129837	129837	Endymion	425	“ Ah ! the present would be adequate , it would be fascination , if I always had such a companion as Lady Montfort , ”
129843	129932	129377	129378	Lady Montfort	499	“ What surprises me most , what indeed astounds me , is that Myra should join in this counsel — Myra , who knows all , and who has felt it perhaps deeper even than I did . But I will not obtrude these thoughts on you , best and dearest of friends . I ought not to have made to you the allusions to my private position which I have done , but it seemed to me the only way to explain my conduct , otherwise inexplicable . ”
129933	129948	129950	129951	Lady Montfort	499	“ And to whom ought you to say these things if not to me , ”
129953	130024	129950	129951	Lady Montfort	499	“ whom you called just now your best and dearest friend ? I wish to be such to you . Perhaps I have been too eager , but , at any rate , it was eagerness for your welfare . Let us then be calm . Speak to me as you would to Myra . I can not be your twin , but I can be your sister in feeling . ”
130070	130357	130067	130067	he	4679	“ I am not without ambition , dearest Lady Montfort ; I have had visions which would satisfy even you ; but partly from my temperament , still more perhaps from the vicissitudes of my life , I have considerable waiting powers . I think if one is patient and watches , all will come of which one is capable ; but no one can be patient who is not independent . My wants are moderate , but their fulfilment must be certain . The break - up of the government , which deprives me of my salary as a private secretary , deprives me of luxuries which I can do without — a horse , a brougham , a stall at the play , a flower in my button - hole — but my clerkship is my freehold . As long as I possess it , I can study , I can work , I can watch and comprehend all the machinery of government . I can move in society , without which a public man , whatever his talents or acquirements , is in life playing at blind - man ’s buff . I must sacrifice this citadel of my life if I go into parliament . Do not be offended , therefore , if I say to you , as I shall say to Myra , I have made up my mind not to surrender it . It is true I have the misfortune to be a year older than Charles Fox when he entered the senate , but even with this great disadvantage I am sometimes conceited enough to believe that I shall succeed , and to back myself against the field . ”
130409	130523	130399	130399	Endymion	425	“ I congratulate you , my dear boy ; your fellows , at least , have pluck . If they lose , which I think they will , they will have gained at least three months of power , and irresponsible power . Why ! they may do anything in the interval , and no doubt will . You will see ; they will make their chargers consuls . It beats the Bed - Chamber Plot , and I always admired that . One hundred days ! Why , the Second Empire lasted only one hundred days . But what days ! what excitement ! They were worth a hundred years at Elba . ”
130524	130537	130539	130539	Endymion	425	“ Your friends do not seem quite so pleased as you are , ”
130541	130653	130539	130539	Endymion	425	“ My friends , as you call them , are old fogies , and want to divide the spoil among the ancient hands . It will be a great thing for Peel to get rid of some of these old friends . A dissolution permits the powerful to show their power . There is Beaumaris , for example ; now he will have an opportunity of letting them know who Lord Beaumaris is . I have a dream ; he must be Master of the Horse . I shall never rest till I see Imogene riding in that golden coach , and breaking the line with all the honours of royalty . ”
130654	130658	130660	130664	the editor of a newspaper	4683	“ Mr. Ferrars , ”
130678	130735	130660	130664	the editor of a newspaper	4683	“ do you think you could favour me this evening with Mr. Sidney Wilton ’s address ? We have always supported Mr. Wilton ’s views on the corn laws , and if put clearly and powerfully before the country at this junction , the effect might be great , perhaps even , if sustained , decisive . ”
130831	130838	130841	130841	she	499	“ Dear Simon was always right , ”
130942	131000	130930	130930	she	499	“ What you say , dearest Endymion , is quite unanswerable , and I alone perhaps can really know that ; but what I feel is , I have failed in life . My dream was to secure you greatness , and now , when the first occasion arrives , it seems I am more than powerless . ”
131001	131013	130918	130919	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Dearest sister ! you have done so much for me . ”
131014	131017	131019	131020	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Nothing , ”
131022	131094	131019	131020	Lady Roehampton	499	“ what I have done for you would have been done by every sister in this metropolis . I dreamed of other things ; I fancied , with my affection and my will , I could command events , and place you on a pinnacle . I see my folly now ; others have controlled your life , not I — as was most natural ; natural , but still bitter . ”
131095	131099	130918	130919	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Dearest Myra ! ”
131100	131137	130918	130919	Lady Roehampton	499	“ It is so , Endymion . Let us deceive ourselves no longer . I ought not to have rested until you were in a position which would have made you a master of your destiny . ”
131138	131160	131019	131020	Lady Roehampton	499	“ But if there should be such a thing as destiny , it will not submit to the mastery of man . ”
131161	131242	130918	130919	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Do not split words with me ; you know what I mean ; you feel what I mean ; I mean much more than I say , and you understand much more than I say . My lord told me to ask you to dine with us , if you called , but I will not ask you . There is no joy in meeting at present . I feel as I felt in our last year at Hurstley . ”
131243	131254	130918	130919	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Oh ! do n’t say that , dear Myra ! ”
131265	131284	131256	131256	Endymion	425	“ Trust me ; all will come right ; a little patience , and all will come right . ”
131285	131294	131296	131297	Lady Roehampton	499	“ I have had patience enough in life , ”
131299	131376	131296	131297	Lady Roehampton	499	“ years of patience , the most doleful , the most dreary , the most dark and tragical . And I bore it all , and I bore it well , because I thought of you , and had confidence in you , and confidence in your star ; and because , like an idiot , I had schooled myself to believe that , if I devoted my will to you , that star would triumph . ”
132049	132053	132062	132066	a very fashionable young man	4718	“ very earlies , ”
132129	132136	132137	132137	he	425	“ I should think a dun , ”
132193	132205	132238	132238	Her	4715	“ Mind — you are to send me your first frank . ”
132919	133171	132915	132916	LADY MONTFORT	499	“ What is it all about ? and what does it all mean ? I should have thought some great calamity had occurred if , however distressing , it did not appear in some sense to be gratifying . What is gratifying ? You deal in conundrums , which I never could find out . Of course I shall be at home to you at any time , if you wish to see me . Pray come on at once , as I detest mysteries . I went to the play last night with your sister . We both of us rather expected to see you , but it seems neither of us had mentioned to you we were going . I did not , for I was too low - spirited about your affairs . You lost nothing . The piece was stupid beyond expression . We laughed heartily , at least I did , to show we were not afraid . My lord came home last night suddenly . Odo is going to stand for the county , and his borough is vacant . What an opportunity it would have been for you ! a certain seat . But I care for no boroughs now . My lord will want you to dine with him to - day ; I hope you can come . Perhaps he will not be able to see you this morning , as his agent will be with him about these elections . Adieu ! ”
133266	133274	133276	133277	Lady Montfort	499	“ I wish I had sent it , ”
133279	133387	133276	133277	Lady Montfort	499	“ but that was impossible . I do not care who did send it ; I have no female curiosity except about matters which , by knowledge , I may influence . This is finished . You are free . You can not hesitate as to your course . I never could speak to you again if you did hesitate . Stop here , and I will go to my lord . This is a great day . If we can settle only to - day that you shall be the candidate for our borough , I really shall not much care for the change of ministry . ”
133547	133549	133784	133784	he	425	“ Berengaria ”
133787	133792	133813	133813	she	499	“ Something has happened ! ”
133821	133857	133860	133860	she	499	“ No , no , nothing , nothing,—at least nothing to distress you . My lord hopes you will be able to dine with him to - day , and tell him all the news . ”
133869	133909	134034	134034	he	548	“ I should like to have a good cry , as the servants say — but I never could cry . I will tell you all about it in a moment . You were very good not to go . ”
134024	134033	134034	134034	he	548	“ And you must tell him , Berengaria , ”
134037	134088	134256	134257	the agent	4756	“ that he can come and dine here whenever he likes , in boots . It is a settled thing that M.P.‘s may dine in boots . I think it a most capital plan . Besides , I know it will please you . You will have your own member . ”
134243	134254	134256	134257	the agent	4756	“ Mr. Ferrars seems to be everything we could wish , ”
134259	134337	134345	134346	Lady Montfort	499	“ and as you say , my lady , though he is young , so was Mr. Pitt , and I have little doubt , after what you say , my lady , that it is very likely he will in time become as eminent . But what I came up to town particularly to impress upon my lord is , that if Mr. Odo will not stand again , we are in a very great difficulty . ”
134338	134343	134345	134346	Lady Montfort	499	“ Difficulty about what ? ”
134349	134410	134256	134257	the agent	4756	“ Well , my lady , if Mr. Odo stands , there is great respect for him . The other side would not disturb him . He has been member for some years , and my lord has been very liberal . But the truth is , if Mr. Odo does not stand , we can not command the seat . ”
134411	134426	134437	134438	the agent	4756	“ Not command the seat ! Then our interest must have been terribly neglected . ”
134427	134435	134437	134438	the agent	4756	“ I hope not , my lady , ”
134440	134451	134256	134257	the agent	4756	“ The fact is , the property is against us . ”
134452	134462	134256	134257	the agent	4756	“ I thought it was all my lord ’s . ”
134463	134562	134563	134564	Lady Montfort	499	“ No , my lady ; the strong interest in the borough is my Lord Beaumaris . It used to be about equal , but all the new buildings are in Lord Beaumaris ’ part of the borough . It would not have signified if things had remained as in the old days . The grandfather of the present lord was a Whig , and always supported the Montforts , but that ’s all changed . The present earl has gone over to the other side , and , I hear , is very strong in his views . ”
134573	134669	134869	134870	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ You will meet the agent at dinner , but he did not give me a ray of hope . Go now ; indeed , I have kept you too long . I am so stricken that I can scarcely command my senses . Only think of our borough being stolen from us by Lord Beaumaris ! I have brought you no luck , Endymion ; I have done you nothing but mischief ; I am miserable . If you had attached yourself to Lady Beaumaris , you might have been a member of parliament . ”
134822	134826	134974	134974	he	610	“ Cheap bread ! ”
134912	134972	134993	134994	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ They will never be able to get up the steam , Sir Thomas ; the Chartists are against them . The Chartists will never submit to anything that is cheap . In spite of their wild fancies , they are real John Bulls . I beg your pardon , but I see a gentleman I must speak to , ”
134983	134991	135008	135008	Waldershare	442	“ Well , what is your news ? ”
134999	135006	135008	135008	Waldershare	442	“ I come here for news , ”
135010	135025	135093	135093	Waldershare	442	“ This is my Academus , and you , Tadpole , are my Plato . ”
135026	135075	135093	135093	Waldershare	442	“ Well , if you want the words of a wise man , listen to me . If I had a great friend , which Mr. Waldershare probably has , who wants a great place , these are times in which such a man should show his power . ”
135076	135091	135093	135093	Waldershare	442	“ I have a great friend whom I wish to have a great place , ”
135095	135117	135093	135093	Waldershare	442	“ and I think he is quite ready to show his power , if he knew exactly how to exercise it . ”
135118	135191	135205	135205	Waldershare	442	“ What I am saying to you is not known to a single person in this room , and to only one out of it , but you may depend upon what I say . Lord Montfort ’s cousin retires from Northborough to sit for the county . They think they can nominate his successor as a matter of course . A delusion ; your friend Lord Beaumaris can command the seat . ”
135192	135203	135218	135219	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ Well , I think you can depend on Beaumaris , ”
135210	135216	135218	135219	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ I depend upon you , ”
135228	135243	135257	135257	Waldershare	442	“ The party already owes you much . This will be a crowning service . ”
135244	135255	135257	135257	Waldershare	442	“ Beaumaris is rather a queer man to deal with , ”
135259	135265	135218	135219	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ he requires gentle handling . ”
135266	135277	135291	135291	Waldershare	442	“ All the world says he consults you on everything . ”
135278	135289	135291	135291	Waldershare	442	“ All the world , as usual , is wrong , ”
135293	135303	135313	135314	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ Lord Beaumaris consults no one except Lady Beaumaris . ”
135304	135311	135313	135314	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ Well then we shall do , ”
135317	135385	135393	135393	Waldershare	442	“ Our man that I want him to return is a connection of Lady Beaumaris , a Mr. Rodney , very anxious to get into parliament , and rich . I do not know who he is exactly , but it is a good name ; say a cousin of Lord Rodney until the election is over , and then they may settle it as they like . ”
135386	135391	135393	135393	Waldershare	442	“ A Mr. Rodney , ”
135396	135418	135313	135314	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ well , if I hear anything I will let you know . I suppose you are in pretty good spirits ? ”
135419	135477	135491	135491	Waldershare	442	“ I should like a little sunshine . A cold spring , and now a wet summer , and the certainty of a shocking harvest combined with manufacturing distress spreading daily , is not pleasant , but the English are a discriminating people . They will hardly persuade them that Sir Robert has occasioned the bad harvests . ”
135478	135489	135637	135637	Endymion	425	“ The present men are clearly responsible for all that , ”
135623	135635	135637	135637	Endymion	425	“ I suppose your friends are very triumphant , Lady Beaumaris ? ”
135639	135655	135665	135665	Endymion	425	“ Yes ; they naturally are very excited . I confess I am not myself . ”
135656	135663	135665	135665	Endymion	425	“ But you ought to be , ”
135667	135698	135637	135637	Endymion	425	“ You will have an immense position . I should think Lord Beaumaris would have any office he chose , and yours will be the chief house of the party . ”
135699	135762	135773	135773	Endymion	425	“ I do not know that Lord Beaumaris would care to have office , and I hardly think any office would suit him . As for myself , I am obliged to be ambitious , but I have no ambition , or rather I would say , I think I was happier when we all seemed to be on the same side . ”
135763	135771	135773	135773	Endymion	425	“ Well , those were happy days , ”
135775	135800	135637	135637	Endymion	425	“ and these are happy days . And few things make me happier than to see Lady Beaumaris admired and appreciated by every one . ”
135801	135846	135857	135857	Endymion	425	“ I wish you would not call me Lady Beaumaris . That may be , and indeed perhaps is , necessary in society , but when we are alone , I prefer being called by a name which once you always and kindly used . ”
135847	135855	135863	135863	he	425	“ I shall always love the name , ”
135859	135862	135879	135879	She	4786	“ and , ”
135869	135878	135898	135898	she	4786	“ shall always love her who bears it . ”
135901	135946	135954	135954	Endymion	425	“ They were talking about you at dinner to - day . I fear this change of government , if there is to be one , will be injurious to you — losing your private secretaryship to Mr. Wilton , and perhaps other things ? ”
135947	135952	135954	135954	Endymion	425	“ Fortune of war , ”
135956	135995	136006	136006	she	4786	“ we must bear these haps . But the truth is , I think it is not unlikely that there may be a change in my life which may be incompatible with retaining my secretaryship under any circumstances . ”
135996	136005	136006	136006	she	4786	“ You are not going to be married ? ”
136010	136020	135954	135954	Endymion	425	“ Not the slightest idea of such an event . ”
136021	136029	135954	135954	Endymion	425	“ You are too young to marry . ”
136030	136039	136006	136006	she	4786	“ Well , I am older than you . ”
136040	136075	135954	135954	Endymion	425	“ Yes ; but men and women are different in that matter . Besides , you have too many fair friends to marry , at least at present . What would Lady Roehampton say ? ”
136076	136090	136113	136114	Lady Beaumaris	580	“ Well , I have sometimes thought my sister wished me to marry . ”
136091	136111	136166	136166	Endymion	425	“ But then there are others who are not sisters , but who are equally interested in your welfare , ”
136152	136164	136166	136166	Endymion	425	“ Well , I do not think I shall ever marry , ”
136168	136205	136214	136215	Lady Beaumaris	580	“ The change in my life I was alluding to is one by no means of a romantic character . I have some thoughts of trying my luck on the hustings , and getting into parliament . ”
136206	136212	136214	136215	Lady Beaumaris	580	“ That would be delightful , ”
136217	136236	136166	136166	Endymion	425	“ Do you know that it has been one of my dreams that you should be in parliament ? ”
136237	136330	136346	136347	Lady Beaumaris	580	“ Ah ! dearest Imogene , for you said I might call you Imogene , you must take care what you say . Remember we are unhappily in different camps . You must not wish me success in my enterprise ; quite the reverse ; it is more than probable that you will have to exert all your influence against me ; yes , canvass against me , and wear hostile ribbons , and use all your irresistible charms to array electors against me , or to detach them from my ranks . ”
136331	136344	136346	136347	Lady Beaumaris	580	“ Even in jest , you ought not to say such things , ”
136349	136409	136416	136417	Lady Beaumaris	580	“ But I am not in jest , I am in dreadful earnest . Only this morning I was offered a seat , which they told me was secure ; but when I inquired into all the circumstances , I found the interest of Lord Beaumaris so great , that it would be folly for me to attempt it . ”
136410	136414	136428	136428	Endymion	425	“ What seat ? ”
136423	136426	136428	136428	Endymion	425	“ Northborough , ”
136430	136467	136478	136478	Imogene	420	“ now held by Lord Montfort ’s cousin , who is to come in for his county . The seat was offered to me , and I was told I was to be returned without opposition . ”
136468	136476	136478	136478	Imogene	420	“ Lady Montfort offered it to you ? ”
136480	136524	136536	136536	Imogene	420	“ She interested herself for me , and Lord Montfort approved the suggestion . It was described to me as a family seat , but when I looked into the matter , I found that Lord Beaumaris was more powerful than Lord Montfort . ”
136525	136534	136536	136536	Imogene	420	“ I thought that Lady Montfort was irresistible , ”
136538	136547	136478	136478	Imogene	420	“ she carries all before her in society . ”
136548	136576	136588	136589	Lady Beaumaris	580	“ Society and politics have much to do with each other , but they are not identical . In the present case , Lady Montfort is powerless . ”
136577	136586	136588	136589	Lady Beaumaris	580	“ And have you formally abandoned the seat ? ”
136591	136652	136665	136665	Imogene	420	“ Not formally abandoned it ; that was not necessary , but I have dismissed it from my mind , and for some time have been trying to find another seat , but hitherto without success . In short , in these days it is no longer possible to step into parliament as if you were stepping into a club . ”
136653	136663	136665	136665	Imogene	420	“ If I could do anything , however little ? ”
136667	136678	136588	136589	Lady Beaumaris	580	“ Perhaps Lady Montfort would not like me to interfere ? ”
136679	136683	136698	136698	she	420	“ Why not ? ”
136684	136692	136698	136698	she	420	“ Oh ! I do not know , ”
136701	136706	136698	136698	she	420	“ Is she jealous ? ”
136707	136716	136698	136698	she	420	“ Jealous ! why should she be jealous ? ”
136717	136725	136698	136698	she	420	“ Perhaps she has had no cause . ”
136726	136857	136866	136866	Imogene	420	“ You know Lady Montfort . She is a woman of quick and brilliant feeling , the best of friends and a dauntless foe . Her kindness to me from the first moment I made her acquaintance has been inexpressible , and I sincerely believe she is most anxious to serve me . But our party is not very popular at present ; there is no doubt the country is against us . It is tired of us . I feel myself the general election will be disastrous . Liberal seats are not abundant just now , quite the reverse , and though Lady Montfort has done more than any one could under the circumstances , I feel persuaded , though you think her irresistible , she will not succeed . ”
136858	136864	136866	136866	Imogene	420	“ I hardly know her , ”
136868	136914	136957	136958	Lord Roehampton	499	“ The world considers her irresistible , and I think you do . Nevertheless , I wish she could have had her way in this matter , and I think it quite a pity that Northborough has turned out not to be a family seat . ”
136946	136955	137093	137093	he	548	“ The dinner of consolation , or hope , ”
137087	137092	137093	137093	he	548	“ Well , Berengaria , ”
137100	137262	137093	137093	he	548	“ you look divine . Never dine out again in a high dress . It distresses me . Bertolini was the only man who ever caught the tournure of your shoulders , and yet I am not altogether satisfied with his work . So , you are going to dine with that good Neuchatel . Remember me kindly to him . There are few men I like better . He is so sensible , knows so much , and so much of what is going on . I should have liked very much to have dined with him , but he is aware of my unfortunate state . Besides , my dear , if I were better I should not have enough strength for his dinners . They are really banquets ; I can not stand those ortolans stuffed with truffles and those truffles stuffed with ortolans . Perhaps he will come and dine with us some day off a joint . ”
137263	137301	137317	137318	Lord Montfort	548	“ The Queen of Mesopotamia will be here next week , Simon , and we must really give her what you call a joint , and then we can ask the Neuchatels and a few other people . ”
137302	137315	137317	137318	Lord Montfort	548	“ I was in hopes the dissolution would have carried everybody away , ”
137322	137344	137093	137093	he	548	“ I wish the Queen of Mesopotamia were a candidate for some borough ; I think she would rather like it . ”
137345	137374	137093	137093	he	548	“ Well , we could not return her , Simon ; do not touch on the subject . But what have you got to amuse to - day ? ”
137375	137566	137317	137318	Lord Montfort	548	“ Oh ! I shall do very well . I have got the head of the French detective police to dine with me , and another man or two . Besides , I have got here a most amusing book , ‘ Topsy Turvy ; ’ it comes out in numbers . I like books that come out in numbers , as there is a little suspense , and you can not deprive yourself of all interest by glancing at the last page of the last volume . I think you must read ‘ Topsy Turvy , ’ Berengaria . I am mistaken if you do not hear of it . It is very cynical , which authors , who know a little of the world , are apt to be , and everything is exaggerated , which is another of their faults when they are only a trifle acquainted with manners . A little knowledge of the world is a very dangerous thing , especially in literature . But it is clever , and the man writes a capital style ; and style is everything , especially in fiction . ”
137567	137579	137093	137093	he	548	“ And what is the name of the writer , Simon ? ”
137580	137650	137670	137670	she	4800	“ You never heard of it ; I never did ; but my secretary , who lives much in Bohemia , and is a member of the Cosmopolitan and knows everything , tells me he has written some things before , but they did not succeed . His name is St. Barbe . I should like to ask him to dinner if I knew how to get at him . ”
137651	137658	137670	137670	she	4800	“ Well , adieu ! Simon , ”
137678	137685	137670	137670	she	4800	“ I expect an unsatisfactory dinner . ”
137686	137725	137839	137839	Her	499	“ Adieu ! and if you meet poor Ferrars , which I dare say you will , tell him to keep up his spirits . The world is a wheel , and it will all come round right . ”
137833	137838	137884	137884	he	4809	“ the family seat . ”
137874	137883	137884	137884	he	4809	“ I think we shall do very well , ”
137887	137909	137927	137928	Melchior Neuchatel	472	“ What cry can be better than that of ‘ Cheap bread ? ’ It gives one an appetite at once . ”
137910	137925	137946	137947	Lord Roehampton	499	“ But the Corn - Law League says your bread will not be cheap , ”
137930	137944	137999	137999	he	4809	“ I wonder whether the League has really any power in the constituencies , ”
137949	137998	138025	138026	Mrs. Neuchatel	476	“ I doubt it . They may have in time , but then in the interval trade will revive . I have just been reading Mr. Thornberry ’s speech . We shall hear more of that man . You will not be troubled about any of your seats ? ”
138019	138023	138025	138026	Mrs. Neuchatel	476	“ Our seats ? ”
138035	138075	138090	138091	a minister	861	“ Oh , I know nothing about them , nor do I understand why there is a dissolution . I trust that parliament will not be dissolved without voting the money for the observation of the transit of Venus . ”
138076	138088	138101	138102	Mr. Wilton	326	“ I think the Roman Catholic vote will carry us through , ”
138093	138099	138101	138102	Mr. Wilton	326	“ Talking of Roman Catholics , ”
138104	138116	138125	138126	a colleague	4812	“ is it true that Penruddock has gone over to Rome ? ”
138117	138123	138125	138126	a colleague	4812	“ No truth in it , ”
138128	138160	138178	138179	Lady Montfort	499	“ He has gone to Rome — there is no doubt of that , and he has been there some time , but only for distraction . He had overworked himself . ”
138161	138176	138178	138179	Lady Montfort	499	“ He might have been a Dean if he had been a practical man , ”
138184	138194	138207	138208	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ and on the high road to a bishopric . ”
138195	138205	138207	138208	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ That is what we want , Lady Montfort , ”
138210	138243	138125	138126	a colleague	4812	“ we want a few practical men . If we had a practical man as Chancellor of the Exchequer , we should not be in the scrape in which we now are . ”
138244	138280	138178	138179	Lady Montfort	499	“ It is not likely that Penruddock will leave the Church with a change of government possibly impending . We could do nothing for him with his views , but he will wait for Peel . ”
138281	138306	138207	138208	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ Oh ! Peel will never stand those high - fliers . He put the Church into a Lay Commission during his last government . ”
138307	138342	138352	138353	Lord Roehampton	499	“ Penruddock will never give up Anglicanism while there is a chance of becoming a Laud . When that chance vanishes , trust my word , Penruddock will make his bow to the Vatican . ”
138343	138350	138352	138353	Lord Roehampton	499	“ Well , I must say , ”
138355	138368	138207	138208	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ if I were a clergyman I should be a Roman Catholic . ”
138369	138383	138207	138208	Mr. Neuchatel	469	“ Then you could not marry . What a compliment to Lady Roehampton ! ”
138384	138401	138438	138438	she	481	“ Nay ; it is because I could not marry that I am not a clergyman . ”
138422	138437	138438	138438	she	481	“ I fear it will be a very great confusion — this general election , ”
138441	138454	138472	138472	Endymion	425	“ Papa was telling us that you think of being a candidate . ”
138455	138470	138472	138472	Endymion	425	“ I am a candidate , but without a seat to captivate at present , ”
138474	138486	138438	138438	she	481	“ but I am not without hopes of making some arrangement . ”
138487	138499	138438	138438	she	481	“ Well , you must tell me what your colours are . ”
138500	138507	138472	138472	Endymion	425	“ And will you wear them ? ”
138508	138524	138438	138438	she	481	“ Most certainly ; and I will work you a banner if you be victorious . ”
138525	138536	138438	138438	she	481	“ I think I must win with such a prospect . ”
138537	138546	138570	138570	she	504	“ I hope you will win in everything . ”
138563	138569	138570	138570	she	504	“ What a dreary dinner ! ”
138573	138579	138438	138438	she	481	“ Do you think so ? ”
138580	138607	138438	138438	she	481	“ Well , perhaps it was my own fault . Perhaps I am not in good cue , but everything seems to me to go wrong . ”
138608	138621	138570	138570	she	504	“ Things sometimes do go wrong , but then they get right . ”
138622	138637	138438	138438	she	481	“ Well , I do not think anything will ever get right with me . ”
138638	138670	138438	138438	she	481	“ Dear Lady Montfort , how can you say such things ? You who have , and have always had , the world at your feet — and always will have . ”
138671	138782	138797	138798	Lady Roehampton	499	“ I do not know what you mean by having the world at my feet . It seems to me that I have no power whatever — I can do nothing . I am vexed about this business of your brother . Our people are so stupid . They have no resource . When I go to them and ask for a seat , I expect a seat , as I would a shawl at Howell and James ’ if I asked for one . Instead of that they only make difficulties . What our party wants is a Mr. Tadpole ; he out - manoeuvres them in every corner . ”
138783	138795	138797	138798	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Well , I shall be deeply disappointed — deeply pained , ”
138800	138842	138854	138855	Lady Montfort	499	“ if Endymion is not in this parliament , but if we fail I will not utterly despair . I will continue to do what I have done all my life , exert my utmost will and power to advance him . ”
138843	138852	138854	138855	Lady Montfort	499	“ I thought I had will and power , ”
138857	138919	138797	138798	Lady Roehampton	499	“ but the conceit is taken out of me . Your brother was to me a source of great interest , from the first moment that I knew him . His future was an object in life , and I thought I could mould it . What a mistake ! Instead of making his fortune I have only dissipated his life . ”
138920	138940	138797	138798	Lady Roehampton	499	“ You have been to him the kindest and the most valuable of friends , and he feels it . ”
138941	138972	139015	139016	Lady Montfort	499	“ It is no use being kind , and I am valuable to no one . I often think if I disappeared to - morrow no one would miss me . ”
138973	139014	139031	139031	her	499	“ You are in a morbid mood , dear lady . To - morrow perhaps everything will be right , and then you will feel that you are surrounded by devoted friends , and by a husband who adores you . ”
139034	139078	139094	139095	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Ah ! there it is , dear Myra . You judge from your own happiness ; you do not know Lord Montfort . You know how I love him , but I am perfectly convinced he prefers my letters to my society . ”
139079	139092	139113	139114	Lady Montfort	499	“ You see what it is to be a Madame de Sevigne , ”
139107	139111	139113	139114	Lady Montfort	499	“ You jest , ”
139116	139166	139487	139487	Waldershare	442	“ I am quite serious . No one can deceive me ; would that they could ! I have the fatal gift of reading persons , and penetrating motives , however deep or complicated their character , and what I tell you about Lord Montfort is unhappily too true . ”
139230	139270	139487	139487	Waldershare	442	“ I tell you , Mr. Waldershare , I know it ; I have it almost from Lord Beaumaris himself ; he has declined to support our man , and no doubt will give his influence to the enemy . ”
139271	139285	139295	139296	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ I do not believe that Lord Beaumaris has made any engagement whatever . ”
139286	139293	139295	139296	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ A pretty state of affairs ! ”
139298	139337	139487	139487	Waldershare	442	“ I do not know what the world has come to . Here are gentlemen expecting high places in the Household , and under - secretaryships of state , and actually giving away our seats to our opponents . ”
139338	139447	139460	139461	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ There is some family engagement about this seat between the Houses of Beaumaris and Montfort , and Lord Beaumaris , who is a young man , and who does not know as much about these things as you and I do , naturally wants not to make a mistake . But he has promised nothing and nobody . I know , I might almost say I saw the letter , that he wrote to Lord Montfort this day , asking for an interview to - morrow morning on the matter , and Lord Montfort has given him an appointment for to - morrow . This I know . ”
139448	139458	139460	139461	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ Well , I must leave it to you , ”
139463	139479	139487	139487	Waldershare	442	“ You must remember what we are fighting for . The constitution is at stake . ”
139480	139485	139503	139504	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ And the Church , ”
139489	139501	139503	139504	Mr. Tadpole	610	“ And the landed interest , you may rely upon it , ”
139506	139525	139741	139759	the most sweetly mannered gentleman alive , who not only gave him his hand , but retained his guest	4826	“ And your Lordship of the Treasury in posse , Tadpole . Truly it is a great stake . ”
139764	139791	139831	139831	he	548	“ We are a sort of cousins , I believe , and ought to have been acquainted before , but you know perhaps my wretched state , ”
139824	139830	139831	139831	he	548	“ I remember your grandfather , ”
139834	139871	139980	139980	he	507	“ and with good cause . He pouched me at Harrow , and it was the largest pouch I ever had . One does not forget the first time one had a five - pound note . ”
139973	139979	139980	139980	he	507	“ I am a Whig , ”
139983	140056	140293	140294	Lord Montfort	548	“ and so was your father , but I am not particularly pleased with the sayings and doings of my people . Between ourselves , I think they have been in a little too long , and if they do anything very strong , if , for instance , they give office to O’Connell , I should not be at all surprised if I were myself to sit on the cross benches . ”
140297	140344	140477	140477	she	499	“ Although I never pay visits , because really in my wretched state I can not , there is no reason why our wives should not know each other . Will you permit Lady Montfort to have the honour of paying her respects to Lady Beaumaris ? ”
140491	140502	140916	140917	Lord Beaumaris	507	“ I am delighted to find that we are cousins . ”
140894	140914	140916	140917	Lord Beaumaris	507	“ We think , by the allusion to the navy , that it must be Mr. Hood of Acreley , ”
140924	140949	141132	141132	Endymion	425	“ but he has not the ghost of a chance . I will ride over and see him in the course of the day . ”
141142	141178	141227	141227	Tadpole	610	“ I did not enlarge on our greatest feat , namely , that we had governed the country for two years without a majority . Peel would never have had the pluck to do that . ”
141240	141245	141227	141227	Tadpole	610	“ The fact is , ”
141251	141269	141451	141452	Lady Montfort	499	“ Lady Beaumaris is the only Tory woman . They have nobody who can receive except her . ”
141443	141450	141451	141452	Lady Montfort	499	“ We are going to Princedown , ”
141459	141973	142375	142375	Endymion	425	“ and we had counted on seeing you there , but I have been thinking much of your position since , and I am persuaded , that we must sacrifice pleasure to higher objects . This is really a crisis in your life , and much , perhaps everything , depends on your not making a mistake now . What I want to see you is a great statesman . This is a political economy parliament , both sides alike thinking of the price of corn and all that . Finance and commerce are everybody ’s subjects , and are most convenient to make speeches about for men who can not speak French and who have had no education . Real politics are the possession and distribution of power . I want to see you give your mind to foreign affairs . There you will have no rivals . There are a great many subjects which Lord Roehampton can not take up , but which you could very properly , and you will have always the benefit of his counsel , and , when necessary , his parliamentary assistance ; but foreign affairs are not to be mastered by mere reading . Bookworms do not make chancellors of state . You must become acquainted with the great actors in the great scene . There is nothing like personal knowledge of the individuals who control the high affairs . That has made the fortune of Lord Roehampton . What I think you ought to do , without doubt ought to do , is to take advantage of this long interval before the meeting of parliament , and go to Paris . Paris is now the Capital of Diplomacy . It is not the best time of the year to go there , but you will meet a great many people of the diplomatic world , and if the opportunity offers , you can vary the scene , and go to some baths which princes and ministers frequent . The Count of Ferroll is now at Paris , and minister for his court . You know him ; that is well . But he is my greatest friend , and , as you know , we habitually correspond . He will do everything for you , I am sure , for my sake . It is not pleasant to be separated ; I do not wish to conceal that ; I should have enjoyed your society at Princedown , but I am doing right , and you will some day thank me for it . We must soften the pang of separation by writing to each other every day , so when we meet again it will only be as if we had parted yesterday . Besides — who knows?—I may run over myself to Paris in the winter . My lord always liked Paris ; the only place he ever did , but I am not very sanguine he will go ; he is so afraid of being asked to dinner by our ambassador . ”
142363	142373	142375	142375	Endymion	425	“ If this has happened at twenty - two , ”
142377	142442	142565	142565	he	4393	“ what may not occur if the average life of man be allotted to me ? At any rate , I will never think of anything else . I have a purpose in life , and I will fulfil it . It is a charm that its accomplishment would be the most grateful result to the two beings I most love in the world . ”
142553	142564	142565	142565	he	4393	“ This is not a favourable time to visit Paris , ”
142568	142731	142565	142565	he	4393	“ so far as society is concerned . There is some business stirring in the diplomatic world , which has re - assembled the fraternity for the moment , and the King is at St. Cloud , but you may make some acquaintances which may be desirable , and at any rate look about you and clear the ground for the coming season . I do not despair of our dear friend coming over in the winter . It is one of the hopes that keep me alive . What a woman ! You may count yourself fortunate in having such a friend . I do . I am not particularly fond of female society . Women chatter too much . But I prefer the society of a first - rate woman to that of any man ; and Lady Montfort is a first - rate woman — I think the greatest since Louise of Savoy ; infinitely beyond the Princess d’Ursins . ”
142733	142744	143152	143155	the Count of Ferroll	3891	“ business that was then stirring in the diplomatic world , ”
143141	143150	143152	143155	the Count of Ferroll	3891	“ I will not give them ten years , ”
143173	143180	143158	143158	his	3891	“ I sometimes think hardly five . ”
143181	143190	143158	143158	his	3891	“ But where will the blow come from ? ”
143191	143215	143152	143155	the Count of Ferroll	3891	“ Here ; there is no movement in Europe except in France , and here it will always be a movement of subversion . ”
143216	143221	143158	143158	his	3891	“ A pretty prospect ! ”
143222	143261	143158	143158	his	3891	“ The sooner you realise it the better . The system here is supported by journalists and bankers ; two influential classes , but the millions care for neither ; rather , I should say , dislike both . ”
143262	143269	143152	143155	the Count of Ferroll	3891	“ Will the change affect Europe ? ”
143270	143336	143158	143158	his	3891	“ Inevitably . You rightly say Europe , for that is a geographical expression . There is no State in Europe ; I exclude your own country , which belongs to every division of the globe , and is fast becoming more commercial than political , and I exclude Russia , for she is essentially oriental , and her future will be entirely the East . ”
143337	143343	143152	143155	the Count of Ferroll	3891	“ But there is Germany ! ”
143344	143430	143484	143485	the Count	4393	“ Where ? I can not find it on the maps . Germany is divided into various districts , and when there is a war , they are ranged on different sides . Notwithstanding our reviews and annual encampments , Germany is practically as weak as Italy . We have some kingdoms who are allowed to play at being first - rate powers ; but it is mere play . They no more command events than the King of Naples or the Duke of Modena . ”
143431	143440	143152	143155	the Count of Ferroll	3891	“ Then is France periodically to overrun Europe ? ”
143441	143452	143542	143544	the Count of	2827	“ So long as it continues to be merely Europe . ”

143547	143619	144384	144384	his	469	“ to know personally those who are carrying on the business of the world ; so much depends on the character of an individual , his habits of thought , his prejudices , his superstitions , his social weaknesses , his health . Conducting affairs without this advantage is , in effect , an affair of stationery ; it is pens and paper who are in communication , not human beings . ”
144324	144382	144427	144427	She	476	principles—“real liberal principles , no nonsense ; there was more gold in the Bank of France than in any similar establishment in Europe . After all , wealth is the test of the welfare of a people , and the test of wealth is the command of the precious metals . Eh ! Mr. Member of Parliament ? ”
144432	144469	144482	144482	she	476	“ What do you think of this , Adriana ? It is simple and in good taste . I should like it for myself , and yet I fear it might not be thought fine enough . ”
144470	144480	144482	144482	she	476	“ This is pretty , mamma , and new , ”
144493	144515	144530	144530	she	476	“ Oh , no ! that will never do , dear Adriana ; they will say we are purse - proud . ”
144516	144528	144546	144546	Endymion	561	“ I am afraid they will always say that , mamma , ”
144533	144544	144546	144546	Endymion	561	“ It is a long time since we all separated , ”
144550	144596	144633	144633	Adriana	481	“ Months ! Mr. Sidney Wilton said you were the first runaway . I think you were quite right . Your new life now will be fresh to you . If you had remained , it would only have been associated with defeat and discomfiture . ”
144597	144622	144633	144633	Adriana	481	“ I am so happy to be in parliament , that I do not think I could ever associate such a life with discomfiture . ”
144623	144631	144633	144633	Adriana	481	“ Does it make you very happy ? ”
144641	144645	144633	144633	Adriana	481	“ Very happy . ”
144646	144653	145136	145136	she	407	“ I am glad of that . ”
145125	145135	145136	145136	she	407	“ I hope he will come here next week , ”
145141	145182	145136	145136	she	407	“ I heard from him to - day . He is at Venice . And he gives me such lovely descriptions of that city , that I shall never rest till I have seen it and glided in a gondola . ”
145183	145192	145136	145136	she	407	“ Well , that you can easily do . ”
145193	145234	145254	145256	Mr. Sidney Wilton	326	“ Not so easily . It will never do to interfere with my lord ’s hunting — and when hunting is over there is always something else — Newmarket , or the House of Lords , or rook - shooting . ”
145235	145252	145325	145325	Endymion	561	“ I must say there is something delightful about Paris , which you meet nowhere else , ”
145260	145324	145346	145346	He	561	“ For my part , it has the same effect on me as a bottle of champagne . When I think of what we were doing at this time last year — those dreadful November cabinets — I shudder ! By the by , the Count of Ferroll says there is a chance of Lady Montfort coming here ; have you heard anything ? ”
145361	145405	145412	145413	Lady Montfort	499	“ Oh ! Montfort will never come . He will bolt at the last moment when the hall is full of packages . Their very sight will frighten him , and he will steal down to Princedown and read ‘ Don Quixote . ’ ”
145419	145462	145569	145569	she	499	“ He threw me over almost as we were getting into the carriage , and I had quite given it up when dear Lady Roehampton came to my rescue . She wanted to see her brother , and — here we are . ”
145560	145568	145569	145569	she	499	“ I dined with those people once , ”
145574	145593	145754	145755	Lady Montfort	499	“ but I confess when I thought of those dear Granvilles , their entrees stuck in my throat . ”
145743	145752	145754	145755	Lady Montfort	499	“ But I think we had better not , ”
145759	145788	145798	145799	Lady Roehampton	499	“ After all , there is nothing like ‘ my crust of bread and liberty , ’ and so I think we had better stay at the Bristol . ”
145789	145796	145798	145799	Lady Roehampton	499	“ Go and talk to Adriana , ”
145804	145815	145832	145833	his sister	1096	“ It seems to me you never speak to her . ”
145822	145831	145832	145833	his sister	1096	“ Lady Montfort has plenty of friends here , ”
145836	145857	146004	146004	He	442	“ You are not wanted , and you should always remember those who have been our earliest and kindest friends . ”
146030	146036	146070	146070	she	420	“ master of the situation . ”
146094	146100	146206	146207	Lady Montfort	499	“ master of the situation . ”
146229	146239	146290	146290	she	466	one—“a week , perhaps ten days at the outside . ”
146297	146327	146655	146655	she	499	“ I think I must ask you to take me back . And indeed you ought to be with my lord some little time before the meeting of Parliament . ”
146647	146649	146655	146655	she	499	“ Charivari ”
146658	146671	146655	146655	she	499	“ Are you not going to ride to - day , Endymion ? ”
146672	146692	146655	146655	she	499	“ I think not . I wanted to talk to you a little about my plans , Lady Montfort . ”
146693	146704	146655	146655	she	499	“ Your plans ? Why should you have any plans ? ”
146705	146726	146655	146655	she	499	“ Well , Lady Roehampton is about to return to England , and she proposes I should go with her . ”
146727	146730	146805	146806	Her husband	986	“ Why ? ”
146811	146838	146903	146903	she	499	“ Berengaria is a charming companion , but if she would only listen a little more , she would have so much more to tell me . ”
146906	147102	147126	147126	Endymion	561	“ I think the whole thing preposterous . What can Lord Roehampton have to do before the meeting of parliament ? He has not got to write the Queen ’s speech . The only use of being in opposition is that we may enjoy ourselves . The best thing that Lord Roehampton and all his friends can do is travel for a couple of years . Ask the Count of Ferroll what he thinks of the situation . He will tell you that he never knew one more hopeless . Taxes and tariffs — that ’s the future of England , and , so far as I can see , it may go on for ever . The government here desires nothing better than what they call Peace . What they mean by peace is agiotage , shares at a premium , and bubble companies . The whole thing is corrupt , as it ever must be when government is in the hands of a mere middle class , and that , too , a limited one ; but it may last hopelessly long , and in the meantime , ‘ Vive la bagatelle ! ’ ”
147103	147124	147138	147139	Lady Montfort	499	“ These are very different views from those which , I had understood , were to guide us in opposition , ”
147130	147136	147138	147139	Lady Montfort	499	“ There is no opposition , ”
147144	147208	146903	146903	she	499	“ For a real opposition there must be a great policy . If your friend , Lord Roehampton , when he was settling the Levant , had only seized upon Egypt , we should have been somewhere . Now , we are the party who wanted to give , not even cheap bread to the people , but only cheaper bread . Faugh ! ”
147209	147227	146903	146903	she	499	“ Well , I do not think the occupation of Egypt in the present state of our finances ”
147230	147288	147310	147310	Endymion	561	“ Do not talk to me about ‘ the present state of our finances . ’ You are worse than Mr. Sidney Wilton . The Count of Ferroll says that a ministry which is upset by its finances must be essentially imbecile . And that , too , in England — the richest country in the world ! ”
147289	147308	147310	147310	Endymion	561	“ Well , I think the state of the finances had something to do with the French Revolution , ”
147313	147363	147373	147373	Endymion	561	“ The French Revolution ! You might as well talk of the fall of the Roman Empire . The French Revolution was founded on nonsense — on the rights of man ; when all sensible people in every country are now agreed , that man has no rights whatever . ”
147364	147371	147373	147373	Endymion	561	“ But , dearest Lady Montfort , ”
147381	147400	147412	147412	she	5067	“ about my returning ; for that is the real subject on which I wished to trouble you . ”
147401	147411	147412	147412	she	5067	“ You have made up your mind to return , ”
147415	147436	147452	147452	Endymion	561	“ What is the use of consulting me with a foregone conclusion ? I suppose you think it a compliment . ”
147437	147450	147466	147467	Lady Montfort	499	“ I should be very sorry to do anything without consulting you , ”
147454	147464	147466	147467	Lady Montfort	499	“ The worst person in the world to consult , ”
147470	147517	147565	147566	Lady Montfort	499	“ If you want advice , you had better go to your sister . Men who are guided by their sisters seldom make very great mistakes . They are generally so prudent ; and , I must say , I think a prudent man quite detestable . ”
147574	147587	147627	147627	she	481	“ Well , I suppose I shall see you before you go , ”
147620	147626	147642	147642	Myra	466	“ We were so happy , ”
147630	147640	147656	147656	Adriana	481	“ And are so happy , and will be , ”
147644	147654	147656	147656	Adriana	481	“ I feel I shall never be happy again , ”
147658	147674	147681	147682	Lady Roehampton	499	“ You deserve to be the happiest of human beings , and you will be . ”
147675	147680	147751	147751	she	499	“ Never , never ! ”
147742	147750	147751	147751	she	499	“ I have made all my farewells , ”
147754	147763	147786	147786	he	919	“ and how have you been getting on ? ”
147775	147785	147786	147786	he	919	“ I am ready to depart at this moment , ”
147791	147815	147826	147826	Myra	466	“ and was only thinking how I could extricate myself from that horrible dinner to - day at the Count of Ferroll ’s . ”
147816	147824	147826	147826	Myra	466	“ Well , that is not difficult , ”
147828	147859	147915	147915	He	561	“ you can write a note here if you like , at once . I think you must have seen quite enough of the Count of Ferroll and his friends . ”
147898	147914	147940	147940	he	561	“ Do you know , we were nearly having a travelling companion to - morrow ? ”
147936	147939	147940	147940	he	561	“ Indeed ! ”
147943	147947	147925	147925	she	1096	“ and who ? ”
147948	147951	147956	147956	he	561	“ Adriana . ”
147952	147955	147956	147956	he	561	“ Adriana ! ”
147962	147969	147925	147925	she	1096	“ would she leave her family ? ”
147970	148016	148028	148028	Endymion	561	“ She had a fancy , and I am sure I do not know any companion I could prefer to her . She is the only person of whom I could truly say , that every time I see her , I love her more . ”
148017	148026	148043	148044	Lady Roehampton	499	“ She seemed to like Paris very much , ”
148033	148041	148043	148044	Lady Roehampton	499	“ The first part of her visit , ”
148046	148081	148092	148092	Endymion	561	“ she liked it amazingly . But my arrival and Lady Montfort ’s , I fear , broke up their little parties . You were a great deal with the Neuchatels before we came ? ”
148082	148090	148092	148092	Endymion	561	“ They are such a good family , ”
148094	148136	148143	148144	Lady Roehampton	499	“ so kind , so hospitable , such true friends . And Mr. Neuchatel himself is one of the shrewdest men that probably ever lived . I like talking with him , or rather , I like to hear him talk . ”
148137	148141	148143	148144	Lady Roehampton	499	“ O Endymion , ”
148146	148160	148169	148169	Endymion	561	“ if you were to marry Adriana , my happiness would be complete . ”
148161	148167	148169	148169	Endymion	561	“ Adriana will never marry , ”
148171	148243	148143	148144	Lady Roehampton	499	“ she is afraid of being married for her money . I know twenty men who would marry her , if they thought there was a chance of being accepted ; and the best man , Eusford , did make her an offer — that I know . And where could she find a match more suitable?—high rank , and large estate , and a man that everybody speaks well of . ”
148244	148290	148299	148299	Endymion	561	“ Adriana will never marry except for the affections ; there you are right , Endymion ; she must love and she must be loved ; but that is not very unreasonable in a person who is young , pretty , accomplished , and intelligent . ”
148291	148297	148310	148311	Lady Roehampton	499	“ She is all that , ”
148302	148308	148338	148338	his	561	“ And she loves you , ”
148355	148408	148338	148338	his	561	“ I should like to see Mr. Neuchatel ’s face were I to ask permission to marry his daughter . I suppose he would not kick me downstairs ; that is out of fashion ; but he certainly would never ask me to dinner again , and that would be a sacrifice . ”
148409	148420	148338	148338	his	561	“ You jest , Endymion ; I am not jesting . ”
148421	148444	148461	148462	his sister	1096	“ There are some matters that can only be treated as a jest ; and my marriage with Miss Neuchatel is one . ”
148445	148459	148461	148462	his sister	1096	“ It would make you one of the most powerful men in England , ”
148464	148473	148487	148488	his sister	1096	“ Other impossible events would do the same . ”
148474	148485	148487	148488	his sister	1096	“ It is not impossible ; it is very possible , ”
148490	148514	148538	148538	Endymion	561	“ believe me , trust in me . The happiness of their daughter is more precious to the Neuchatels even than their fortune . ”
148515	148536	148538	148538	Endymion	561	“ I do not see why , at my age , I should be in such a hurry to marry , ”
148540	148614	148623	148623	Endymion	561	“ You can not marry too soon , if by so doing you obtain the great object of life . Early marriages are to be deprecated , especially for men , because they are too frequently imprudent ; but when a man can marry while he is young , and at once realise , by so doing , all the results which successful time may bring to him , he should not hesitate . ”
148615	148621	148623	148623	Endymion	561	“ I hesitate very much , ”
148625	148646	148834	148834	Endymion	561	“ I should hesitate very much , even if affairs were as promising as I think you may erroneously assume . ”
148647	148833	148852	148852	he	561	“ But you must not hesitate , Endymion . We must never forget the great object for which we two live , for which , I believe , we were born twins — to rebuild our house ; to raise it from poverty , and ignominy , and misery and squalid shame , to the rank and position which we demand , and which we believe we deserve . Did I hesitate when an offer of marriage was made to me , and the most unexpected that could have occurred ? True it is , I married the best and greatest of men , but I did not know that when I accepted his hand . I married him for your sake , I married him for my own sake , for the sake of the house of Ferrars , which I wished to release and raise from its pit of desolation . I married him to secure for us both that opportunity for our qualities which they had lost , and which I believed , if enjoyed , would render us powerful and great . ”
148844	148851	148852	148852	he	561	“ So long as you live , ”
148855	148862	148623	148623	Endymion	561	“ we shall never be ignominious . ”
148863	148974	148834	148834	Endymion	561	“ Yes , but I am nothing ; I am not a man , I am not a Ferrars . The best of me is that I may be a transient help to you . It is you who must do the deed . I am wearied of hearing you described as Lady Roehampton ’s brother , or Lord Roehampton ’s brother - in - law . I shall never be content till you are greater than we are , and there is but one and only one immediate way of accomplishing it , it is by this marriage — and a marriage with whom ? with an angelic being ! ”
148975	149008	148623	148623	Endymion	561	“ You take me somewhat by surprise , Myra . My thoughts have not been upon this matter . I can not fairly describe myself at this moment as a marrying man . ”
149009	149260	149395	149397	Your faithful friend	5087	“ I know what you mean . You have female friendships , and I approve of them . They are invaluable to youth , and you have been greatly favoured in this respect . They have been a great assistance to you ; beware lest they become a hindrance . A few years of such feelings in a woman ’s life are a blazoned page , and when it is turned she has many other chapters , though they may not be as brilliant or adorned . But these few years in a man ’s life may be , and in your case certainly would be , the very marrow of his destiny . During the last five or six years , ever since our emancipation , there has been a gradual but continuous development in your life . All has been preparatory for a position which you have acquired . That position may lead to anything — in your case , I will still believe , to everything — but there must be no faltering . Having crossed the Alps , you must not find a Capua . I speak to you as I have not spoken to you of late , because it was not necessary . But here is an opportunity which must not be lost . I feel half inspired , as when we parted in our misery at Hurstley , and I bade you , poor and obscure , go forth and conquer the world . ”
149297	149394	149395	149397	Your faithful friend	5087	“ If it be any satisfaction to you to know that you made me very unhappy by not dining here to - day , you may be gratified . I am very unhappy . I know that I was unkind this morning , and rude , but as my anger was occasioned by your leaving me , my conduct might annoy but surely could not mortify you . I shall see you to - morrow , however early you may depart , as I can not let your dear sister leave Paris without my embracing her . “
149399	149402	149395	149397	Your faithful friend	5087	“ Berengaria . ”
149423	149427	149488	149488	he	5090	“ queer place , ”
149460	149465	150007	150007	He	5114	“ Our own Reporter , ”
150015	150058	150007	150007	He	5114	“ You made your first mistake to - night , my dear Ferrars . You should have taken your seat below the gangway and near me , on the Mountain . You , like myself , are a man of the future . ”
150059	150079	150218	150220	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5116	“ I am a member of the opposition . I do not suppose it signifies much where I sit . ”
150080	150216	150318	150319	Job Thornberry	396	“ On the contrary , it signifies everything . After this great Tory reaction there is nothing to be done now by speeches , and , in all probability , very little that can be effectually opposed . Much , therefore , depends upon where you sit . If you sit on the Mountain , the public imagination will be attracted to you , and when they are aggrieved , which they will be in good time , the public passion , which is called opinion , will look to you for representation . My advice to my friends now is to sit together and say nothing , but to profess through the press the most advanced opinions . We sit on the back bench of the gangway , and we call ourselves the Mountain . ”
150329	150334	150391	150391	Job	396	“ total and immediate , ”

150393	150398	150410	150412	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5129	“ You will see . ”
150399	150408	150410	150412	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5129	“ Peel now occupies the position of Necker , ”
150414	150432	150442	150442	Job	396	“ and will make the same fiasco . Then you will at last have a popular government . ”
150433	150440	150442	150442	Job	396	“ And the rights of labour ? ”
150444	150462	150472	150474	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5130	“ All I hope is , I may have got safe to the States before that day . ”
150463	150470	150472	150474	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5130	“ There will be no danger , ”
150476	150520	150528	150528	Waldershare	442	“ There is this difference between the English Mountain and the French . The English Mountain has its government prepared . And my brother spoke to you because , when the hour arrives , I wished to see you a member of it . ”
150521	150526	150528	150528	Waldershare	442	“ My dear Endymion , ”
150530	150565	150576	150576	Endymion	425	“ let us dine together before we meet in mortal conflict , which I suppose will be soon . I really think your Mr. Bertie Tremaine the most absurd being out of Colney Hatch . ”
150566	150574	150576	150576	Endymion	425	“ Well , he has a purpose , ”
150578	150594	150472	150474	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5130	“ and they say that a man with a purpose generally sees it realised . ’ “

150626	150800	150997	150997	You	5133	” One of the most interesting members of the House of Commons was Sir Fraunceys Scrope . He was the father of the House , though it was difficult to believe that from his appearance . He was tall , and had kept his distinguished figure ; a handsome man , with a musical voice , and a countenance now benignant , though very bright , and once haughty . He still retained the same fashion of costume in which he had ridden up to Westminster more than half a century ago , from his seat in Derbyshire , to support his dear friend Charles Fox ; real top - boots , and a blue coat and buff waistcoat . He was a great friend of Lord Roehampton , had a large estate in the same county , and had refused an earldom . Knowing Endymion , he came and sate by him one day in the House , and asked him , good - naturedly , how he liked his new life . “
150956	150957	150997	150997	You	5133	” “
150966	150970	150997	150997	You	5133	” said Endymion . “

151026	151030	151291	151292	Topsy Turvy	620	” said Endymion . “
151254	151290	151291	151292	Topsy Turvy	620	” While parliaments were dissolving and ministries forming , the disappointed seeking consolation and the successful enjoying their triumph , Simon , Earl of Montfort , who just missed being a great philosopher , was reading “
151294	151494	151497	151497	I	0	” which infinitely amused him ; the style so picturesque and lambent ! the tone so divertingly cynical ! And if the knowledge of society in its pages was not so distinguished as that of human nature generally , this was a deficiency obvious only to a comparatively limited circle of its readers . Lord Montfort had reminded Endymion of his promise to introduce the distinguished author to him , and accordingly , after due researches as to his dwelling - place , Mr. Ferrars called in Jermyn Street and sent up his card , to know whether Mr. St. Barbe would receive him . This was evidently not a matter - of - course affair , and some little time had elapsed when the maid - servant appeared , and beckoned to Endymion to follow her upstairs . In the front drawing - room of the first floor , robed in a flaming dressing - gown , and standing with his back to the fire and to the looking - glass , the frame of which was encrusted with cards of invitation , the former colleague of Endymion received his visitor with a somewhat haughty and reserved air . “
151505	151516	151532	151532	I	0	” said Endymion . No reply but a ceremonious bow . “
151522	151531	151541	151541	I	0	” Endymion added after a moment ’s pause . “

152759	153405	152749	152749	people	6681	” The condition of England at the meeting of Parliament in 1842 was not satisfactory . The depression of trade in the manufacturing districts seemed overwhelming , and continued increasing during the whole of the year . A memorial from Stockport to the Queen in the spring represented that more than half the master spinners had failed , and that no less than three thousand dwelling - houses were untenanted . One - fifth of the population of Leeds were dependent on the poor - rates . The state of Sheffield was not less severe — and the blast furnaces of Wolverhampton were extinguished . There were almost daily meetings , at Liverpool , Manchester , and Leeds , to consider the great and increasing distress of the country , and to induce ministers to bring forward remedial measures ; but as these were impossible , violence was soon substituted for passionate appeals to the fears or the humanity of the government . Vast bodies of the population assembled in Staleybridge , and Ashton , and Oldham , and marched into Manchester . For a week the rioting was unchecked , but the government despatched a strong military force to that city , and order was restored . The state of affairs in Scotland was not more favourable . There were food riots in several of the Scotch towns , and in Glasgow the multitude assembled , and then commenced what they called a begging tour , but which was really a progress of not disguised intimidation . The economic crisis in Ireland was yet to come , but the whole of that country was absorbed in a harassing and dangerous agitation for the repeal of the union between the two countries . During all this time , the Anti - Corn Law League was holding regular and frequent meetings at Manchester , at which statements were made distinguished by great eloquence and little scruple . But the able leaders of this confederacy never succeeded in enlisting the sympathies of the great body of the population . Between the masters and the workmen there was an alienation of feeling , which apparently never could be removed . This reserve , however , did not enlist the working classes on the side of the government ; they had their own object , and one which they themselves enthusiastically cherished . And this was the Charter , a political settlement which was to restore the golden age , and which the master manufacturers and the middle classes generally looked upon with even more apprehension than Her Majesty ’s advisers . It is hardly necessary to add , that in a state of affairs like that which is here faintly but still faithfully sketched , the rapid diminution of the revenue was inevitable , and of course that decline mainly occurred in the two all - important branches of the customs and excise . There was another great misfortune also which at this trying time hung over England . The country was dejected . The humiliating disasters of Afghanistan , dark narratives of which were periodically arriving , had produced a more depressing effect on the spirit of the country than all the victories and menaces of Napoleon in the heyday of his wild career . At home and abroad , there seemed nothing to sustain the national spirit ; financial embarrassment , commercial and manufacturing distress , social and political agitation on the one hand , and on the other , the loss of armies , of reputation , perhaps of empire . It was true that these external misfortunes could hardly be attributed to the new ministry — but when a nation is thoroughly perplexed and dispirited , it soon ceases to make distinctions between political parties . The country is out of sorts , and the “
153407	153550	153775	153775	My	0	” is held answerable for the disorder . Thus it will be seen , that , though the new ministry were supported by a commanding majority in parliament , and that , too , after a recent appeal to the country , they were not popular , it may be truly said they were even the reverse . The opposition , on the other hand , notwithstanding their discomfiture , and , on some subjects , their disgrace , were by no means disheartened , and believed that there were economical causes at work , which must soon restore them to power . The minister brought forward his revision of the tariff , which was denounced by the League as futile , and in which anathema the opposition soon found it convenient to agree . Had the minister included in his measure that “
153555	153774	152749	152749	people	6681	” of the existing corn laws which was preached by many as a panacea , the effect would have been probably much the same . No doubt a tariff may aggravate , or may mitigate , such a condition of commercial depression as periodically visits a state of society like that of England , but it does not produce it . It was produced in 1842 , as it had been produced at the present time , by an abuse of capital and credit , and by a degree of production which the wants of the world have not warranted . And yet all this time , there were certain influences at work in the great body of the nation , neither foreseen , nor for some time recognised , by statesmen and those great capitalists on whose opinion statesmen much depend , which were stirring , as it were , like the unconscious power of the forces of nature , and which were destined to baffle all the calculations of persons in authority and the leading spirits of all parties , strengthen a perplexed administration , confound a sanguine opposition , render all the rhetoric , statistics , and subscriptions of the Anti - Corn Law League fruitless , and absolutely make the Chartists forget the Charter . “
153787	153804	152749	152749	people	6681	” said Mr. Neuchatel , with his usual calm smile , half sceptical , half sympathetic . “
153846	153914	152749	152749	people	6681	” That is exactly what was wanted . There was abundant capital in the country and a mass of unemployed labour . But the markets on which they had of late depended , the American especially , were overworked and overstocked , and in some instances were not only overstocked , but disturbed by war , as the Chinese , for example — and capital and labour wanted “
153919	154706	152749	152749	people	6681	” The new channel came , and all the persons of authority , alike political and commercial , seemed quite surprised that it had arrived ; but when a thing or a man is wanted , they generally appear . One or two lines of railway , which had been long sleepily in formation , about this time were finished , and one or two lines of railway , which had been finished for some time and were unnoticed , announced dividends , and not contemptible ones . Suddenly there was a general feeling in the country , that its capital should be invested in railways ; that the whole surface of the land should be transformed , and covered , as by a network , with these mighty means of communication . When the passions of the English , naturally an enthusiastic people , are excited on a subject of finance , their will , their determination , and resource , are irresistible . This was signally proved in the present instance , for they never ceased subscribing their capital until the sum entrusted to this new form of investment reached an amount almost equal to the national debt ; and this too in a very few years . The immediate effect on the condition of the country was absolutely prodigious . The value of land rose , all the blast furnaces were relit , a stimulant was given to every branch of the home trade , the amount suddenly paid in wages exceeded that ever known in this country , and wages too at a high rate . Large portions of the labouring classes not only enjoyed comfort , but commanded luxury . All this of course soon acted on the revenue , and both customs and especially excise soon furnished an ample surplus . It can not be pretended that all this energy and enterprise were free in their operation from those evils which , it seems , must inevitably attend any extensive public speculation , however well founded . Many of the scenes and circumstances recalled the days of the South Sea Scheme . The gambling in shares of companies which were formed only in name was without limit . The principal towns of the north established for that purpose stock exchanges of their own , and Leeds especially , one - fifth of whose population had been authoritatively described in the first session of the new parliament as dependent on the poor - rates , now boasted a stock exchange which in the extent of its transactions rivalled that of the metropolis . And the gambling was universal , from the noble to the mechanic . It was confined to no class and to no sex . The scene which took place at the Board of Trade on the last day on which plans could be lodged , and when midnight had arrived while crowds from the country were still filling the hall , and pressing at the doors , deserved and required for its adequate representation the genius of a Hogarth . This was the day on which it was announced that the total number of railway projects , on which deposits had been paid , had reached nearly to eight hundred . What is remarkable in this vast movement in which so many millions were produced , and so many more promised , is , that the great leaders of the financial world took no part in it . The mighty loan - mongers , on whose fiat the fate of kings and empires sometimes depended , seemed like men who , witnessing some eccentricity of nature , watch it with mixed feelings of curiosity and alarm . Even Lombard Street , which never was more wanted , was inactive , and it was only by the irresistible pressure of circumstances that a banking firm which had an extensive country connection was ultimately forced to take the leading part that was required , and almost unconsciously lay the foundation of the vast fortunes which it has realised , and organise the varied connection which it now commands . All seemed to come from the provinces , and from unknown people in the provinces . But in all affairs there must be a leader , and a leader appeared . He was more remarkable than the movement itself . He was a London tradesman , though a member of parliament returned for the first time to this House of Commons . This leader was Mr. Vigo . Mr. Vigo had foreseen what was coming , and had prepared for it . He agreed with Mr. Neuchatel , what was wanted was “
154711	154906	155939	155940	Male swells	5225	” That channel he thought he had discovered , and he awaited it . He himself could command no inconsiderable amount of capital , and he had a following of obscure rich friends who believed in him , and did what he liked . His daily visits to the City , except when he was travelling over England , and especially the north and midland counties , had their purpose and bore fruit . He was a director , and soon the chairman and leading spirit , of a railway which was destined to be perhaps our most important one . He was master of all the details of the business ; he had arrived at conclusions on the question of the gauges , which then was a pons asinorum for the multitude , and understood all about rolling stock and permanent ways , and sleepers and branch lines , which were then cabalistic terms to the general . In his first session in parliament he had passed quietly and almost unnoticed several bills on these matters , and began to be recognised by the Committee of Selection as a member who ought to be “
154909	155938	155939	155940	Male swells	5225	” for questions of this kind . The great occasion had arrived , and Mr. Vigo was equal to it . He was one of those few men who awake one day and find themselves famous . Suddenly it would seem that the name of Mr. Vigo was in everybody ’s mouth . There was only one subject which interested the country , and he was recognised as the man who best understood it . He was an oracle , and , naturally , soon became an idol . The tariff of the ministers was forgotten , the invectives of the League were disregarded , their motions for the repeal of the corn laws were invariably defeated by large and contemptuous majorities . The House of Commons did nothing but pass railway bills , measures which were welcomed with unanimity by the House of Lords , whose estates were in consequence daily increasing in value . People went to the gallery to see Mr. Vigo introduce bills , and could scarcely restrain their enthusiasm at the spectacle of so much patriotic energy , which secured for them premiums for shares , which they held in undertakings of which the first sod was not yet cut . On one morning , the Great Cloudland Company , of which he was chairman , gave their approval of twenty - six bills , which he immediately introduced into parliament . Next day , the Ebor and North Cloudland sanctioned six bills under his advice , and affirmed deeds and agreements which affected all the principal railway projects in Lancashire and Yorkshire . A quarter of an hour later , just time to hurry from one meeting to another , where he was always received with rampant enthusiasm , Newcastle and the extreme north accepted his dictatorship . During a portion of two days , he obtained the consent of shareholders to forty bills , involving an expenditure of ten millions ; and the engagements for one session alone amounted to one hundred and thirty millions sterling . Mr. Neuchatel shrugged his shoulders , but no one would listen even to Mr. Neuchatel , when the prime minister himself , supposed to be the most wary of men , and especially on financial subjects , in the very white heat of all this speculation , himself raised the first sod on his own estate in a project of extent and importance . Throughout these extraordinary scenes , Mr. Vigo , though not free from excitement , exhibited , on the whole , much self - control . He was faithful to his old friends , and no one profited more in this respect than Mr. Rodney . That gentleman became the director of several lines , and vice - chairman of one over which Mr. Vigo himself presided . No one was surprised that Mr. Rodney therefore should enter parliament . He came in by virtue of one of those petitions that Tadpole was always cooking , or baffling . Mr. Rodney was a supporter of the ministry , and Mr. Vigo was a Liberal , but Mr. Vigo returned Mr. Rodney to parliament all the same , and no one seemed astonished or complained . Political connection , political consistency , political principle , all vanished before the fascination of premiums . As for Endymion , the great man made him friendly and earnest overtures , and offered , if he would give his time to business , which , as he was in opposition , would be no great sacrifice , to promote and secure his fortune . But Endymion , after due reflection , declined , though with gratitude , these tempting proposals . Ferrars was an ambitious man , but not too imaginative a one . He had a main object in life , and that was to regain the position which had been forfeited , not by his own fault . His grandfather and his father before him had both been privy councillors and ministers of state . There had , indeed , been more than the prospect of his father filling a very prominent position . All had been lost , but the secret purpose of the life of Endymion was that , from being a clerk in a public office , he should arrive by his own energies at the station to which he seemed , as it were , born . To accomplish this he felt that the entire devotion of his labour and thought was requisite . His character was essentially tenacious , and he had already realised no inconsiderable amount of political knowledge and official experience . His object seemed difficult and distant , but there was nothing wild or visionary in its pursuit . He had achieved some of the first steps , and he was yet very young . There were friends about him , however , who were not content with what they deemed his moderate ambition , and thought they discerned in him qualities which might enable him to mount to a higher stage . However this might be , his judgment was that he must resist the offers of Mr. Vigo , though they were sincerely kind , and so he felt them . In the meantime , he frequently met that gentleman , and not merely in the House of Commons . Mr. St. Barbe would have been frantically envious could he have witnessed and perused the social invitations that fell like a continuous snow - storm on the favoured roof of Mr. Vigo . Mr. Vigo was not a party question . He dined with high patricians who forgot their political differences , while they agreed in courting the presence of this great benefactor of his country . The fine ladies were as eager in their homage to this real patriot , and he might be seen between rival countesses , who emulated each other in their appreciation of his public services . These were Mr. Vigo ’s dangerous suitors . He confessed to Endymion one day that he could not manage the great ladies . “
155942	155948	155939	155940	Male swells	5225	” he would say laughingly , “
155956	156088	155939	155940	Male swells	5225	” The golden youth of the country seemed fascinated by his society , repeated his sententious bons - mot , and applied for shares in every company which he launched into prosperous existence . Mr. Vigo purchased a splendid mansion in St. James ’ Square , where invitations to his banquets were looked upon almost as commands . His chief cook was one of the celebrities of Europe , and though he had served emperors , the salary he received from Mr. Vigo exceeded any one he had hitherto condescended to pocket . Mr. Vigo bought estates , hired moors , lavished his money , not only with profusion , but with generosity . Everything was placed at his command , and it appeared that there was nothing that he refused . “
156095	156101	156106	156106	him	5226	” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine , “
156111	156622	156106	156106	him	5226	” In the midst of this commanding effulgence , the calmer beam of Mr. Rodney might naturally pass unnoticed , yet its brightness was clear and sustained . The Rodneys engaged a dwelling of no mean proportion in that favoured district of South Kensington , which was then beginning to assume the high character it has since obtained . Their equipages were distinguished , and when Mrs. Rodney entered the Park , driving her matchless ponies , and attended by outriders , and herself bright as Diana , the world leaning over its palings witnessed her appearance with equal delight and admiration . We have rather anticipated , for the sake of the subject , in our last chapter , and we must now recur to the time when , after his return from Paris , Endymion entered into what was virtually his first session in the House of Commons . Though in opposition , and with all the delights of the most charming society at his command , he was an habitual and constant attendant . One might have been tempted to believe that he would turn out to be , though a working , only a silent member , but his silence was only prudence . He was deeply interested and amused in watching the proceedings , especially when those took part in them with whom he was acquainted . Job Thornberry occupied a leading position in the debates . He addressed the House very shortly after he took his seat , and having a purpose and a most earnest one , and being what is styled a representative man of his subject , the House listened to him at once , and his place in debate was immediately recognised . The times favoured him , especially during the first and second session , while the commercial depression lasted ; afterwards , he was always listened to , because he had great oratorical gifts , a persuasive style that was winning , and , though he had no inconsiderable powers of sarcasm , his extreme tact wisely guided him to restrain for the present that dangerous , though most effective , weapon . The Pythagorean school , as Waldershare styled Mr. Bertie Tremaine and his following , very much amused Endymion . The heaven - born minister air of the great leader was striking . He never smiled , or at any rate contemptuously . Notice of a question was sometimes publicly given from this bench , but so abstruse in its nature and so quaint in its expression , that the House never comprehended it , and the unfortunate minister who had to answer , even with twenty - four hours ’ study , was obliged to commence his reply by a conjectural interpretation of the query formally addressed to him . But though they were silent in the House , their views were otherwise powerfully represented . The weekly journal devoted to their principles was sedulously circulated among members of the House . It was called the “
156625	156695	156106	156106	him	5226	” and systematically attacked not only every institution , but , it might be said , every law , and all the manners and customs , of the country . Its style was remarkable , never excited or impassioned , but frigid , logical , and incisive , and suggesting appalling revolutions with the calmness with which one would narrate the ordinary incidents of life . The editor of the “
156697	156799	156106	156106	him	5226	” was Mr. Jawett , selected by that great master of human nature , Mr. Bertie Tremaine . When it got about , that the editor of this fearful journal was a clerk in a public office , the indignation of the government , or at least of their supporters , was extreme , and there was no end to the punishments and disgrace to which he was to be subjected ; but Waldershare , who lived a good deal in Bohemia , was essentially cosmopolitan , and dabbled in letters , persuaded his colleagues not to make the editor of the “
156801	156918	156933	156933	you	0	” a martyr , and undertook with their authority to counteract his evil purposes by literary means alone . Being fully empowered to take all necessary steps for this object , Waldershare thought that there was no better mode of arresting public attention to his enterprise than by engaging for its manager the most renowned pen of the hour , and he opened himself on the subject in the most sacred confidence to Mr. St. Barbe . That gentleman , invited to call upon a minister , sworn to secrecy , and brimful of state secrets , could not long restrain himself , and with admirable discretion consulted on his views and prospects Mr. Endymion Ferrars . “
156928	156932	156933	156933	you	0	” said Endymion ; “
156948	156949	156933	156933	you	0	” “
156954	156960	156973	156973	they	6646	” said Mr. St. Barbe ; “

157010	157016	157093	157094	the highest	3787	” said Mr. St. Barbe ; “
157096	157103	157106	157106	you	0	” and he looked quite fierce . “
157115	157119	157168	157168	I	0	” said Endymion . “
157130	157166	157179	157179	I	0	” After Easter , Lord Roehampton said to Endymion that a question ought to be put on a subject of foreign policy of importance , and on which he thought the ministry were in difficulties ; “
157200	157400	158895	158895	I	0	” The notice of this question was the first time Endymion opened his mouth in the House of Commons . It was an humble and not a very hazardous office , but when he got on his legs his head swam , his heart beat so violently , that it was like a convulsion preceding death , and though he was only on his legs for a few seconds , all the sorrows of his life seemed to pass before him . When he sate down , he was quite surprised that the business of the House proceeded as usual , and it was only after some time that he became convinced that no one but himself was conscious of his sufferings , or that he had performed a routine duty otherwise than in a routine manner . The crafty question , however , led to some important consequences . When asked , to the surprise of every one the minister himself replied to it . Waldershare , with whom Endymion dined at Bellamy ’s that day , was in no good humour in consequence . When Lord Roehampton had considered the ministerial reply , he said to Endymion , “
157461	158894	158919	158919	myself	0	” Endymion felt that this was the crisis of his life . He knew the subject well , and he had all the tact and experience of Lord Roehampton to guide him in his statement and his arguments . He had also the great feeling that , if necessary , a powerful arm would support him . It was about a week before the day arrived , and Endymion slept very little that week , and the night before his motion not a wink . He almost wished he was dead as he walked down to the House in the hope that the exercise might remedy , or improve , his languid circulation ; but in vain , and when his name was called and he had to rise , his hands and feet were like ice . Lady Roehampton and Lady Montfort were both in the ventilator , and he knew it . It might be said that he was sustained by his utter despair . He felt so feeble and generally imbecile , that he had not vitality enough to be sensible of failure . He had a kind audience , and an interested one . When he opened his mouth , he forgot his first sentence , which he had long prepared . In trying to recall it and failing , he was for a moment confused . But it was only for a moment ; the unpremeditated came to his aid , and his voice , at first tremulous , was recognised as distinct and rich . There was a murmur of sympathy , and not merely from his own side . Suddenly , both physically and intellectually , he was quite himself . His arrested circulation flowed , and fed his stagnant brain . His statement was lucid , his arguments were difficult to encounter , and his manner was modest . He sate down amid general applause , and though he was then conscious that he had omitted more than one point on which he had relied , he was on the whole satisfied , and recollected that he might use them in reply , a privilege to which he now looked forward with feelings of comfort and confidence . The minister again followed him , and in an elaborate speech . The subject evidently , in the opinion of the minister , was of too delicate and difficult a character to trust to a subordinate . Overwhelmed as he was with the labours of his own department , the general conduct of affairs , and the leadership of the House , he still would undertake the representation of an office with whose business he was not familiar . Wary and accurate he always was , but in discussions on foreign affairs , he never exhibited the unrivalled facility with which he ever treated a commercial or financial question , or that plausible promptness with which , at a moment ’s notice , he could encounter any difficulty connected with domestic administration . All these were qualities which Lord Roehampton possessed with reference to the affairs over which he had long presided , and in the present instance , following the minister , he was particularly happy . He had a good case , and he was gratified by the success of Endymion . He complimented him and confuted his opponent , and , not satisfied with demolishing his arguments , Lord Roehampton indulged in a little raillery which the House enjoyed , but which was never pleasing to the more solemn organisation of his rival . No language can describe the fury of Waldershare as to the events of this evening . He looked upon the conduct of the minister , in not permitting him to represent his department , as a decree of the incapacity of his subordinate , and of the virtual termination of the official career of the Under - Secretary of State . He would have resigned the next day had it not been for the influence of Lady Beaumaris , who soothed him by suggesting , that it would be better to take an early opportunity of changing his present post for another . The minister was wrong . He was not fond of trusting youth , but it is a confidence which should be exercised , particularly in the conduct of a popular assembly . If the under - secretary had not satisfactorily answered Endymion , which no one had a right to assume , for Waldershare was a brilliant man , the minister could have always advanced to the rescue at the fitting time . As it was , he made a personal enemy of one who naturally might have ripened into a devoted follower , and who from his social influence , as well as from his political talents , was no despicable foe . Notwithstanding the great political , and consequently social , changes that had taken place , no very considerable alteration occurred in the general life of those chief personages in whose existence we have attempted to interest the reader . However vast may appear to be the world in which we move , we all of us live in a limited circle . It is the result of circumstances ; of our convenience and our taste . Lady Beaumaris became the acknowledged leader of Tory society , and her husband was so pleased with her position , and so proud of it , that he in a considerable degree sacrificed his own pursuits and pleasures for its maintenance . He even refused the mastership of a celebrated hunt , which had once been an object of his highest ambition , that he might be early and always in London to support his wife in her receptions . Imogene herself was universally popular . Her gentle and natural manners , blended with a due degree of self - respect , her charming appearance , and her ready but unaffected sympathy , won every heart . Lady Roehampton was her frequent guest . Myra continued her duties as a leader of society , as her lord was anxious that the diplomatic world should not forget him . These were the two principal and rival houses . The efforts of Lady Montfort were more fitful , for they were to a certain degree dependent on the moods of her husband . It was observed that Lady Beaumaris never omitted attending the receptions of Lady Roehampton , and the tone of almost reverential affection with which she ever approached Myra was touching to those who were in the secret , but they were few . No great change occurred in the position of Prince Florestan , except that in addition to the sports to which he was apparently devoted , he gradually began to interest himself in the turf . He had bred several horses of repute , and one , which he had named Lady Roehampton , was the favourite for a celebrated race . His highness was anxious that Myra should honour him by being his guest . This had never occurred before , because Lord Roehampton felt that so avowed an intimacy with a personage in the peculiar position of Prince Florestan was hardly becoming a Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ; but that he was no longer , and being the most good - natured man that ever lived , and easily managed in little things , he could not refuse Myra when she consulted him , as they call it , on the subject , and it was settled that Lord and Lady Roehampton were to dine with Prince Florestan . The prince was most anxious that Mr. Sidney Wilton should take this occasion of consenting to a reconciliation with him , and Lady Roehampton exerted herself much for this end . Mr. Sidney Wilton was in love with Lady Roehampton , and yet on this point he was inexorable . Lord and Lady Beaumaris went , and Lady Montfort , to whom the prince had addressed a private note of his own that quite captivated her , and Mr. and Mrs. Neuchatel and Adriana . Waldershare , Endymion , and Baron Sergius completed the guests , who were received by the Duke of St. Angelo and a couple of aides - de - camp . When the prince entered all rose , and the ladies curtseyed very low . Lord Roehampton resumed his seat immediately , saying to his neighbour , “
158921	158922	158919	158919	myself	0	” “
158928	158933	158919	158919	myself	0	” inquired Lady Montfort . “
158940	159097	159108	159108	you	5241	” said Lord Roehampton , smiling . The Duke of St. Angelo was much disturbed by the conduct of Lord Roehampton , which had disappointed his calculations , and he went about lamenting that Lord Roehampton had a little gout . They had assembled in the library and dined on the same floor . The prince was seated between Lady Montfort , whom he accompanied to dinner , and Lady Roehampton . Adriana fell to Endymion ’s lot . She looked very pretty , was beautifully dressed , and for her , was even gay . Her companion was in good spirits , and she seemed interested and amused . The prince never spoke much , but his remarks always told . He liked murmuring to women , but when requisite , he could throw a fly over the table with adroitness and effect . More than once during the dinner he whispered to Lady Roehampton : “
159116	159208	159222	159222	they	5244	” The dinner would have been lively and successful even if Waldershare had not been there , but he to - day was exuberant and irresistible . His chief topic was abuse of the government of which he was a member , and he lavished all his powers of invective and ridicule alike on the imbecility of their policy and their individual absurdities . All this much amused Lady Montfort , and gave Lord Roehampton an opportunity to fool the Under - Secretary of State to the top of his bent . “
159216	159221	159232	159232	they	5244	” said Mr. Neuchatel , “
159228	159229	159232	159232	they	5244	” “
159235	159239	159268	159268	Sacheverell	40	” said Waldershare . “
159270	159271	159268	159268	Sacheverell	40	” “
159282	159289	159293	159293	we	5246	” whispered Imogene to Lord Roehampton , “
159300	159301	159303	159303	you	5241	” “
159307	159334	159418	159418	he	1266	” inquired Lady Montfort of Lord Roehampton . He had been speaking to her for some little time in a hushed tone , and rather earnestly . “
159433	159434	159418	159418	he	1266	” “
159440	159445	159455	159455	I	0	” said Lady Montfort . “
159453	159454	159470	159471	The father	1264	” “
159477	159478	159479	159479	I	0	” “
159489	159494	159511	159511	I	0	” said Lady Montfort ; “
159518	159652	159511	159511	I	0	” They were speaking of Nigel Penruddock , whose movements had been a matter of much mystery during the last two years . Rumours of his having been received into the Roman Church had been often rife ; sometimes flatly , and in time faintly , contradicted . Now the facts seemed admitted , and it would appear that he was about to return to England not only as a Roman Catholic , but as a distinguished priest of the Church , and , it was said , even the representative of the Papacy . All the guests rose at the same time — a pleasant habit — and went upstairs to the brilliantly lighted saloons . Lord Roehampton seated himself by Baron Sergius , with whom he was always glad to converse . “
159660	159668	159674	159674	I	0	” said the ex - minister inquiringly . “
159678	159682	159674	159674	I	0	” said Sergius . “
159705	159706	159735	159735	him	0	” “
159723	159731	159754	159754	You	499	” said Mrs. Neuchatel to Lady Roehampton . “
159752	159753	159754	159754	You	499	” “
159759	159766	159767	159767	They	5262	” said Mr. Neuchatel to Waldershare . “
159779	159780	159800	159800	I	0	” “
159795	159799	159800	159800	I	0	” said Waldershare . “
159807	159812	159800	159800	I	0	” said Mr. Neuchatel . “
159831	159835	159842	159842	I	0	” said Waldershare , “
159840	159841	159842	159842	I	0	” “
159855	159862	159842	159842	I	0	” said Lady Montfort to Myra . “
159868	159904	159905	159905	She	6859	” And Lady Roehampton rose , and they went . It was a portrait of Queen Agrippina by a master hand , and admirably illumined by reflected light , so that it seemed to live . “
159912	159917	159918	159920	Mr. Sidney Wilton	326	” said Lady Montfort . “
159933	159938	159945	159945	her	6859	” said Lady Roehampton . “
159947	159952	159981	159983	no such women	5268	” said Lady Montfort . “
159986	159987	159981	159983	no such women	5268	” “
159994	160007	160016	160016	she	6859	” said Lady Montfort , suddenly turning round and embracing Lady Roehampton ; “
160025	160026	160067	160067	I	0	” “
160065	160066	160123	160123	I	0	” “
160121	160122	160123	160123	I	0	” “
160135	160140	160169	160169	He	641	” said Myra musingly . “
160167	160168	160219	160219	he	641	” “
160225	160232	160259	160259	I	0	” And her voice was tremulous . “
160266	160296	160385	160386	Lord Roehampton	499	” Lady Montfort shook her head with a truly mournful expression , and then suddenly , her beautiful face wreathed with smiles , she said in a gay voice , “
160388	160393	160468	160468	I	0	” she continued smilingly , “
160466	160467	160468	160468	I	0	” “
160476	160481	160499	160499	He	7296	” said Lady Roehampton , “
160497	160498	160499	160499	He	7296	” “
160507	160512	160556	160556	women	900	” said Lady Montfort . “
160524	160554	160556	160556	women	900	” The party broke up . The prince made a sign to Waldershare , which meant a confidential cigar , and in a few minutes they were alone together . “
160558	160563	160576	160577	each other	916	” exclaimed the prince . “
160579	160580	160606	160606	I	0	” “
160590	160605	160606	160606	I	0	” said Waldershare . The prince trimmed his cigar , and then he said , “
160615	161033	161047	161047	he	7296	” The ecclesiastical incident mentioned at the dinner described in our last chapter , produced a considerable effect in what is called society . Nigel Penruddock had obtained great celebrity as a preacher , while his extreme doctrines and practices had alike amazed , fascinated , and alarmed a large portion of the public . For some time he had withdrawn from the popular gaze , but his individuality was too strong to be easily forgotten , even if occasional paragraphs as to his views and conduct , published , contradicted , and reiterated , were not sufficient to sustain , and even stimulate , curiosity . That he was about to return to his native land , as the Legate of His Holiness , was an event which made many men look grave , and some female hearts flutter . The memory of Lady Roehampton could not escape from the past , and she could not recall it and all the scenes at Hurstley without emotion ; and Lady Montfort remembered with some pride and excitement , that the Legate of the Pope had been one of her heroes . It was evident that he had no wish to avoid his old acquaintances , for shortly after his arrival , and after he had assembled his suffragans , and instructed the clergy of his district , for dioceses did not then exist , Archbishop Penruddock , for so the Metropolitan of Tyre simply styled himself , called upon both these ladies . His first visit was to Myra , and notwithstanding her disciplined self - control , her intense pride , and the deep and daring spirit which always secretly sustained her , she was nervous and agitated , but only in her boudoir . When she entered the saloon to welcome him , she seemed as calm as if she were going to an evening assembly . Nigel was changed . Instead of that anxious and moody look which formerly marred the refined beauty of his countenance , his glance was calm and yet radiant . He was thinner , it might almost be said emaciated , which seemed to add height to his tall figure . Lady Roehampton need not have been nervous about the interview , and the pain of its inevitable associations . Except one allusion at the end of his visit , when his Grace mentioned some petty grievance , of which he wished to relieve his clergy , and said , “
161065	161188	161189	161194	a local habitation and a name	5300	” he never referred to the past . All he spoke of was the magnitude of his task , the immense but inspiring labours which awaited him , and his deep sense of his responsibility . Nothing but the Divine principle of the Church could sustain him . He was at one time hopeful that His Holiness might have thought the time ripe for the restoration of the national hierarchy , but it was decreed otherwise . Had it been accorded , no doubt it would have assisted him . A prelate in partibus is , in a certain sense , a stranger , whatever his duties , and the world is more willing when it is appealed to by one who has “
161196	161442	161445	161446	St. Simon	552	” he is identified with the people among whom he lives . There was much to do . The state of the Catholic poor in his own district was heartrending . He never could have conceived such misery , and that too under the shadow of the Abbey . The few schools which existed were wretched , and his first attention must be given to this capital deficiency . He trusted much to female aid . He meant to invite the great Catholic ladies to unite with him in a common labour of love . In this great centre of civilisation , and wealth , and power , there was need of the spirit of a St. Ursula . No one seemed more pleased by the return of Archbishop Penruddock than Lord Montfort . He appeared to be so deeply interested in his Grace ’s mission , sought his society so often , treated him with such profound respect , almost ceremony , asked so many questions about what was happening at Rome , and what was going to be done here — that Nigel might have been pardoned if he did not despair of ultimately inducing Lord Montfort to return to the faith of his illustrious ancestors . And yet , all this time , Lord Montfort was only amusing himself ; a new character was to him a new toy , and when he could not find one , he would dip into the “
161448	161709	161710	161710	You	5301	” Instead of avoiding society , as was his wo nt in the old days , the Archbishop sought it . And there was nothing exclusive in his social habits ; all classes and all creeds , all conditions and orders of men , were alike interesting to him ; they were part of the mighty community , with all whose pursuits , and passions , and interests , and occupations he seemed to sympathise , but respecting which he had only one object — to bring them back once more to that imperial fold from which , in an hour of darkness and distraction , they had miserably wandered . The conversion of England was deeply engraven on the heart of Penruddock ; it was his constant purpose , and his daily and nightly prayer . So the Archbishop was seen everywhere , even at fashionable assemblies . He was a frequent guest at banquets which he never tasted , for he was a smiling ascetic , and though he seemed to be preaching or celebrating high mass in every part of the metropolis , organising schools , establishing convents , and building cathedrals , he could find time to move philanthropic resolutions at middle - class meetings , attend learned associations , and even occasionally send a paper to the Royal Society . The person who fell most under the influence of the archbishop was Waldershare . He was fairly captivated by him . Nothing would satisfy Waldershare till he had brought the archbishop and Prince Florestan together . “
161719	161724	161771	161771	I	0	” he would say . “
161782	161783	161824	161824	they	5313	” “
161834	161835	161824	161824	they	5313	” “
161845	161849	161824	161824	they	5313	” exclaimed Waldershare . “
161869	161870	161824	161824	they	5313	” “
161877	161883	161892	161893	Roman Catholics	9128	” said the prince musingly , “
161916	161917	161927	161928	sensible men	5325	” “
161922	161926	161930	161934	all of the same religion	5326	” said Waldershare , “
161936	161937	161950	161951	Sensible men	5325	” “
161944	161949	162110	162110	You	5328	” inquired the prince . “
161955	162109	162110	162110	You	5328	” Perhaps there was no family which suited him more , and where the archbishop became more intimate , than the Neuchatels . He very much valued a visit to Hainault , and the miscellaneous and influential circles he met there — merchant princes , and great powers of Lombard Street and the Stock Exchange . The Governor of the Bank happened to be a high churchman , and listened to the archbishop with evident relish . Mrs. Neuchatel also acknowledged the spell of his society , and he quite agreed with her that people should be neither so poor nor so rich . She had long mused over plans of social amelioration , and her new ally was to teach her how to carry them into practice . As for Mr. Neuchatel , he was pleased that his wife was amused , and liked the archbishop as he liked all clever men . “
162113	162118	162129	162129	my	0	” he would say , “
162173	162203	162129	162129	my	0	” The prosperity of the country was so signal , while Mr. Vigo was unceasingly directing millions of our accumulated capital , and promises of still more , into the “
162207	162261	162129	162129	my	0	” that it seemed beyond belief that any change of administration could even occur , at least in the experience of the existing generation . The minister to whose happy destiny it had fallen to gratify the large appetites and reckless consuming powers of a class now first known in our social hierarchy as “
162264	162754	162840	162840	Vigo	411	” was hailed as a second Pitt . The countenance of the opposition was habitually dejected , with the exception of those members of it on whom Mr. Vigo graciously conferred shares , and Lady Montfort taunted Mr. Sidney Wilton with inquiries , why he and his friends had not made railroads , instead of inventing nonsense about cheap bread . Job Thornberry made wonderful speeches in favour of total and immediate repeal of the corn laws , and the Liberal party , while they cheered him , privately expressed their regret that such a capital speaker , who might be anything , was not a practical man . Low prices , abundant harvests , and a thriving commerce had rendered all appeals , varied even by the persuasive ingenuity of Thornberry , a wearisome irritation ; and , though the League had transplanted itself from Manchester to the metropolis , and hired theatres for their rhetoric , the close of 1845 found them nearly reduced to silence . Mr. Bertie Tremaine , who was always studying the spirit of the age , announced to the initiated that Mr. Vigo had something of the character and structure of Napoleon , and that he himself began to believe , that an insular nation , with such an enormous appetite , was not adapted to cosmopolitan principles , which were naturally of a character more spiritual and abstract . Mr. Bertie Tremaine asked Mr. Vigo to dinner , and introduced him to several distinguished youths of extreme opinions , who were dining off gold plate . Mr. Vigo was much flattered by his visit ; his host made much of him ; and he heard many things on the principles of government , and even of society , in the largest sense of the expression , which astonished and amused him . In the course of the evening he varied the conversation — one which became the classic library and busts of the surrounding statesmen — by promising to most of the guests allotments of shares in a new company , not yet launched , but whose securities were already at a high premium . Endymion , in the meantime , pursued the even tenor of his way . Guided by the experience , unrivalled knowledge , and consummate tact of Lord Roehampton , he habitually made inquiries , or brought forward motions , which were evidently inconvenient or embarrassing to the ministry ; and the very circumstance , that he was almost always replied to by the prime minister , elevated him in the estimation of the House as much as the pertinence of his questions , and the accurate information on which he founded his motions . He had not taken the House with a rush like Job Thornberry , but , at the end of three sessions , he was a personage universally looked upon as one who was “
162760	162839	162840	162840	Vigo	411	” There was another new member who had also made way , though slowly , and that was Mr. Trenchard ; he had distinguished himself on a difficult committee , on which he had guided a perplexed minister , who was chairman , through many intricacies . Mr. Trenchard watched the operations of Mr. Vigo , with a calm , cold scrutiny , and ventured one day to impart his conviction to Endymion that there were breakers ahead . “
162850	163004	162840	162840	Vigo	411	” he said , and he offered to give him all the necessary details , if he would call the attention of the House to the matter . Endymion declined to do this , chiefly because he wished to devote himself to foreign affairs , and thought the House would hardly brook his interference also in finance . So he strongly advised Trenchard himself to undertake the task . Trenchard was modest , and a little timid about speaking ; so it was settled that he should consult the leaders on the question , and particularly the gentleman who it was supposed would be their Chancellor of the Exchequer , if ever they were again called upon to form a ministry . This right honourable individual listened to Trenchard with the impatience which became a man of great experience addressed by a novice , and concluded the interview by saying , that he thought “
163011	163051	162840	162840	Vigo	411	” at the same time , he would turn it in his mind , and consult some practical men . Accordingly the ex- and future minister consulted Mr. Vigo , who assured him that he was quite right ; that “
163058	163159	162840	162840	Vigo	411	” and that the floating capital of the country was inexhaustible . In the midst of all this physical prosperity , one fine day in August , parliament having just been prorogued , an unknown dealer in potatoes wrote to the Secretary of State , and informed him that he had reason to think that a murrain had fallen over the whole of the potato crops in England , and that , if it extended to Ireland , the most serious consequences must ensue . This mysterious but universal sickness of a single root changed the history of the world . “
163167	163177	162840	162840	Vigo	411	” said Lord Roehampton , as he glanced at the “
163180	163184	163203	163203	Berengaria	504	” at Princedown ; “
163201	163202	163203	163203	Berengaria	504	” “
163207	163212	163259	163259	one	6769	” said Lord Montfort , “
163265	163539	163541	163541	I	0	” Lord Montfort was quite right , but even the most wilful and selfish of men was generally obliged to pass his Christmas at his northern castle . Montforts had passed their Christmas in that grim and mighty dwelling - place for centuries . Even he was not strong enough to contend against such tradition . Besides , every one loves power , even if they do not know what to do with it . There are such things as memberships for counties , which , if public feeling be not outraged , are hereditary , and adjacent boroughs , which , with a little management and much expense , become reasonable and loyal . If the flag were rarely to wave on the proud keep of Montfort , all these satisfactory circumstances would be greatly disturbed and baffled ; and if the ancient ensign did not promise welcome and hospitality at Christmas , some of the principal uses even of Earls of Montfort might be questioned . There was another reason , besides the distance and the clime , why Lord Montfort disliked the glorious pile which every Englishman envied him for possession . The mighty domain of Montfort was an estate in strict settlement . Its lord could do nothing but enjoy its convenience and its beauty , and expend its revenues . Nothing could be sold or bought , not the slightest alteration — according to Lord Montfort — be made , without applying to trustees for their sanction . Lord Montfort spoke of this pitiable state of affairs as if he were describing the serfdom of the Middle Ages . “
163555	163560	163561	163561	I	0	” he would say , “
163575	163928	163561	163561	I	0	” Such a humiliating state of affairs had induced his lordship , on the very first occasion , to expend half a million of accumulations , which were at his own disposal , in the purchase of Princedown , which certainly was a very different residence from Montfort Castle , alike in its clime and character . Princedown was situate in a southern county , hardly on a southern coast , for it was ten miles from the sea , though enchanting views of the Channel were frequent and exquisite . It was a palace built in old days upon the Downs , but sheltered and screened from every hostile wind . The full warmth of the south fell upon the vast but fantastic pile of the Renaissance style , said to have been built by that gifted but mysterious individual , John of Padua . The gardens were wonderful , terrace upon terrace , and on each terrace a tall fountain . But the most peculiar feature was the park , which was undulating and extensive , but its timber entirely ilex : single trees of an age and size not common in that tree , and groups and clumps of ilex , but always ilex . Beyond the park , and extending far into the horizon , was Princedown forest , the dominion of the red deer . The Roehamptons and Endymion were the only permanent visitors at Princedown at this moment , but every day brought guests who stayed eight - and - forty hours , and then flitted . Lady Montfort , like the manager of a theatre , took care that there should be a succession of novelties to please or to surprise the wayward audience for whom she had to cater . On the whole , Lord Montfort was , for him , in an extremely good humour ; never very ill ; Princedown was the only place where he never was very ill ; he was a little excited , too , by the state of politics , though he did not exactly know why ; “
163934	163942	163993	163993	I	0	” he would say to Lord Roehampton , “
164010	164075	163993	163993	I	0	” Mr. Waldershare came down , exuberant with endless combinations of persons and parties . He foresaw in all these changes that most providential consummation , the end of the middle class . Mr. Waldershare had become quite a favourite with Lord Montfort , who delighted to talk with him about the Duke of Modena , and imbibe his original views of English History . “
164078	164084	164096	164099	the Duke of Modena	3111	” Lord Montfort would observe , “
164106	164219	164096	164099	the Duke of Modena	3111	” St. Barbe had been invited , and made his appearance . There had been a degree of estrangement between him and his patron . St. Barbe was very jealous ; he was indeed jealous of everybody and everything , and of late there was a certain Doctor Comeley , an Oxford don of the new school , who had been introduced to Lord Montfort , and was initiating him in all the mysteries of Neology . This celebrated divine , who , in a sweet silky voice , quoted Socrates instead of St. Paul , and was opposed to all symbols and formulas as essentially unphilosophical , had become the hero of “
164223	164253	164096	164099	the Duke of Modena	3111	” at Montfort House , where St. Barbe had been so long wo nt to shine , and who in consequence himself had become every day more severely orthodox . “
164262	164278	164096	164099	the Duke of Modena	3111	” said Endymion one morning to St. Barbe in Pall Mall as they were separating . “

164295	164302	164469	164469	I	0	” exclaimed the indignant St. Barbe ; “
164434	164468	164469	164469	I	0	” Mr. Trenchard had come down and brought the news that the ministry had resigned , and that the Queen had sent for the leader of the opposition , who was in Scotland . “

164520	164544	164609	164610	Poor papa	5360	” And they escaped . And then , when they were out of hearing and of sight of any one , she said , “
164621	164634	164729	164729	Myra	466	” she continued in a moody tone , half speaking to herself , “
164722	164723	164729	164729	Myra	466	” “

165479	165483	165505	165505	her	499	” he inquired . “

165573	165782	165560	165560	I	0	” All the high expectations of December at Princedown were doomed to disappointment ; they were a further illustration of Lord Roehampton ’s saying , that there was no gambling like politics . The leader of the opposition came up to town , but he found nothing but difficulties , and a few days before Christmas he had resigned the proffered trust . The protectionist ministry were to remain in office , and to repeal the corn laws . The individual who was most baulked by this unexpected result was perhaps Lord Roehampton . He was a man who really cared for nothing but office and affairs , and being advanced in life , he naturally regretted a lost opportunity . But he never showed his annoyance . Always playful , and even taking refuge in a bantering spirit , the world seemed to go light with him when everything was dark and everybody despondent . The discontent or indignation which the contemplated revolution in policy was calculated to excite in the Conservative party generally were to a certain degree neutralised for the moment by mysterious and confidential communications , circulated by Mr. Tadpole and the managers of the party , that the change was to be accompanied by “
165786	166144	166177	166177	I	0	” As parliament was to meet as soon as convenient after Christmas , and the statement of the regenerated ministry was then to be made immediately , every one held his hand , as they all felt the blow must be more efficient when the scheme of the government was known . The Montforts were obliged to go to their castle , a visit the sad necessity of which the formation of a new government , at one time , they had hoped might have prevented . The Roehamptons passed their Christmas with Mr. Sidney Wilton at Gaydene , where Endymion also and many of the opposition were guests . Waldershare took refuge with his friends the Beaumaris ’ , full of revenge and unceasing combinations . He took down St. Barbe with him , whose services in the session might be useful . There had been a little misunderstanding between these two eminent personages during the late season . St. Barbe was not satisfied with his position in the new journal which Waldershare had established . He affected to have been ill - treated and deceived , and this with a mysterious shake of the head which seemed to intimate state secrets that might hereafter be revealed . The fact is , St. Barbe ’s political articles were so absurd that it was impossible to print them ; but as his name stood high as a clever writer on matters with which he was acquainted , they permitted him , particularly as they were bound to pay him a high salary , to contribute essays on the social habits and opinions of the day , which he treated in a happy and taking manner . St. Barbe himself had such quick perception of peculiarities , so fine a power of observation , and so keen a sense of the absurd , that when he revealed in confidence the causes of his discontent , it was almost impossible to believe that he was entirely serious . It seems that he expected this connection with the journal in question to have been , to use his own phrase , “
166149	166176	166177	166177	I	0	” and that he was habitually to have been introduced by the backstairs of the palace to the presence of Royalty to receive encouragement and inspiration . “
166185	166189	166221	166222	the Mountain	540	” he added , “
166232	166248	166490	166490	I	0	” Parliament soon met , and that session began which will long be memorable . The “
166251	166489	166490	166490	I	0	” were nowhere . Waldershare , who had only waited for this , resigned his office as Under - Secretary of State . This was a bad example and a blow , but nothing compared to the resignation of his great office in the Household by the Earl of Beaumaris . This involved unhappily the withdrawal of Lady Beaumaris , under whose bright , inspiring roof the Tory party had long assembled , sanguine and bold . Other considerable peers followed the precedent of Lord Beaumaris , and withdrew their support from the ministry . Waldershare moved the amendment to the first reading of the obnoxious bill ; but although defeated by a considerable majority , the majority was mainly formed by members of the opposition . Among these was Mr. Ferrars , who it was observed never opened his lips during the whole session . This was not the case with Mr. Bertie Tremaine and the school of Pythagoras . The opportunity long waited for had at length arrived . There was a great parliamentary connection deserted by their leaders . This distinguished rank and file required officers . The cabinet of Mr. Bertie Tremaine was ready , and at their service . Mr. Bertie Tremaine seconded the amendment of Waldershare , and took the occasion of expounding the new philosophy , which seemed to combine the principles of Bentham with the practice of Lord Liverpool . “
166496	166503	166655	166655	I	0	” he said reproachfully to Endymion ; “
166536	166654	166655	166655	I	0	” The debates during the session were much carried on by the Pythagoreans , who never ceased chattering . They had men ready for every branch of the subject , and the debate was often closed by their chief in mystical sentences , which they cheered like awestruck zealots . The great bill was carried , but the dark hour of retribution at length arrived . The ministry , though sanguine to the last of success , and not without cause , were completely and ignominiously defeated . The new government , long prepared , was at once formed . Lord Roehampton again became secretary of state , and he appointed Endymion to the post under him . “
166662	166674	166701	166701	I	0	” said Mr. Bertie Tremaine to Endymion , with encouraging condescension . “
166710	167192	167236	167237	a Harley,—cold	5393	” Very shortly after the prorogation of parliament , an incident occurred which materially affected the position of Endymion . Lord Roehampton had a serious illness . Having a fine constitution , he apparently completely rallied from the attack , and little was known of it by the public . The world also , at that moment , was as usual much dispersed and distracted ; dispersed in many climes , and distracted by the fatigue and hardships they annually endure , and which they call relaxation . Even the colleagues of the great statesman were scattered , and before they had realised that he had been seriously ill , they read of him in the fulfilment of his official duties . But there was no mistake as to his state under his own roof . Lord Roehampton had , throughout the later period of his life , been in the habit of working at night . It was only at night that he could command that abstraction necessary for the consideration of great affairs . He was also a real worker . He wrote his own despatches , whenever they referred to matters of moment . He left to the permanent staff of his office little but the fulfilment of duties which , though heavy and multifarious , were duties of routine . The composition of these despatches was a source to Lord Roehampton of much gratification and excitement . They were of European fame , and their terse argument , their clear determination , and often their happy irony , were acknowledged in all the cabinets , and duly apprehended . The physicians impressed upon Lady Roehampton that this night - work must absolutely cease . A neglect of their advice must lead to serious consequences ; following it , there was no reason why her husband should not live for years , and continue to serve the State . Lord Roehampton must leave the House of Commons ; he must altogether change the order of his life ; he must seek more amusement in society , and yet keep early hours ; and then he would find himself fresh and vigorous in the morning , and his work would rather benefit than distress him . It was all an affair of habit . Lady Roehampton threw all her energies into this matter . She entertained for her lord a reverential affection , and his life to her seemed a precious deposit , of which she was the trustee . She succeeded where the physicians would probably have failed . Towards the end of the year Lord Roehampton was called up to the House of Lords for one of his baronies , and Endymion was informed that when parliament met , he would have to represent the Foreign Office in the House of Commons . Waldershare heartily congratulated him . “
167256	167438	167236	167237	a Harley,—cold	5393	” It was not a very agreeable session . The potato famine did something more than repeal the corn laws . It proved that there was no floating capital left in the country ; and when the Barings and Rothschilds combined , almost as much from public spirit as from private speculation , to raise a loan of a few millions for the minister , they absolutely found the public purse was exhausted , and had to supply the greater portion of the amount from their own resources . In one of the many financial debates that consequently occurred , Trenchard established himself by a clear and comprehensive view of the position of affairs , and by modestly reminding the House , that a year ago he had predicted the present condition of things , and indicated its inevitable cause . This was the great speech on a great night , and Mr. Bertie Tremaine walked home with Trenchard . It was observed that Mr. Bertie Tremaine always walked home with the member who had made the speech of the evening . “
167448	167458	167667	167667	You	5396	” he said in a hollow voice to Trenchard . “
167505	167666	167667	167667	You	5396	” But besides the disquietude of domestic affairs , famine and failures competing in horrible catastrophe and the Bank Act suspended , as the year advanced matters on the Continent became not less dark and troubled . Italy was mysteriously agitated ; the pope announced himself a reformer ; there were disturbances in Milan , Ancona , and Ferrara ; the Austrians threatened the occupation of several States , and Sardinia offered to defend His Holiness from the Austrians . In addition to all this , there were reform banquets in France , a civil war in Switzerland , and the King of Prussia thought it prudent to present his subjects with a Constitution . The Count of Ferroll about this time made a visit to England . He was always a welcome guest there , and had received the greatest distinction which England could bestow upon a foreigner ; he had been elected an honorary member of White ’s . “
167673	167680	167786	167786	he	5399	” he said to Lady Montfort , “
167802	167803	167786	167786	he	5399	” “

167927	168464	168496	168496	I	0	” Endymion had now one of those rare opportunities which , if men be equal to them , greatly affect their future career . As the session advanced , debates on foreign affairs became frequent and deeply interesting . So far as the ministry was concerned , the burthen of these fell on the Under - Secretary of State . He was never wanting . The House felt that he had not only the adequate knowledge , but that it was knowledge perfectly digested ; that his remarks and conduct were those of a man who had given constant thought to his duties , and was master of his subject . His oratorical gifts also began to be recognised . The power and melody of his voice had been before remarked , and that is a gift which much contributes to success in a popular assembly . He was ready without being too fluent . There were light and shade in his delivery . He repressed his power of sarcasm ; but if unjustly and inaccurately attacked , he could be keen . Over his temper he had a complete control ; if , indeed , his entire insensibility to violent language on the part of an opponent was not organic . All acknowledged his courtesy , and both sides sympathised with a young man who proved himself equal to no ordinary difficulties . In a word , Endymion was popular , and that popularity was not diminished by the fact of his being the brother of Lady Roehampton , who exercised great influence in society , and who was much beloved . As the year advanced external affairs became daily more serious , and the country congratulated itself that its interests were entrusted to a minister of the experience and capacity of Lord Roehampton . That statesman seemed never better than when the gale ran high . Affairs in France began to assume the complexion that the Count of Ferroll had prophetically announced . If a crash occurred in that quarter , Lord Roehampton felt that all Europe might be in a blaze . Affairs were never more serious than at the turn of the year . Lord Roehampton told his wife that their holidays must be spent in St. James ’ Square , for he could not leave London ; but he wished her to go to Gaydene , where they had been invited by Mr. Sidney Wilton to pass their Christmas as usual . Nothing , however , would induce her to quit his side . He seemed quite well , but the pressure of affairs was extreme ; and sometimes , against all her remonstrances , he was again working at night . Such remonstrances on other subjects would probably have been successful , for her influence over him was extreme . But to a minister responsible for the interests of a great country they are vain , futile , impossible . One might as well remonstrate with an officer on the field of battle on the danger he was incurring . She said to him one night in his library , where she paid him a little visit before she retired , “
168494	168495	168533	168533	you	5412	” “
168541	168542	168533	168533	you	5412	” “
168548	168563	168533	168533	you	5412	” He looked up with his winning smile , and held out his lips . “
168567	168571	168533	168533	you	5412	” he said ; “
168577	168796	168533	168533	you	5412	” Lady Roehampton after a time slumbered ; how long she knew not , but when she woke , her lord was not at her side . She struck a light and looked at her watch . It was past three o’clock ; she jumped out of bed , and , merely in her slippers and her robe de chambre , descended to the library . It was a large , long room , and Lord Roehampton worked at the extreme end of it . The candles were nearly burnt out . As she approached him , she perceived that he was leaning back in his chair . When she reached him , she observed he was awake , but he did not seem to recognise her . A dreadful feeling came over her . She took his hand . It was quite cold . Her intellect for an instant seemed to desert her . She looked round her with an air void almost of intelligence , and then rushing to the bell she continued ringing it till some of the household appeared . A medical man was near at hand , and in a few minutes arrived , but it was a bootless visit . All was over , and all had been over , he said , “
168801	168802	168805	168805	you	5413	” “
168812	168831	168833	168833	you	5413	” asked Lady Montfort of the prime minister as he entered her boudoir . He shook his head . “
168837	168841	168864	168864	she	5415	” he inquired . “

169316	169372	169380	169380	Ferrars	425	” The prime minister looked considerably perplexed . Such a promotion could not possibly have occurred to him . Though a man of many gifts , and a statesman , he had been educated in high Whig routine , and the proposition of Lady Montfort was like recommending him to make a curate a bishop . “
169375	169379	169440	169440	He	425	” he said , “
169459	169460	169490	169490	he	425	” “
169492	169511	169521	169521	they	5441	” When the prime minister got back to Downing Street , he sent immediately for his head whip . “
169516	169520	169545	169547	secretary of state	3113	” he said ; “
169573	169922	169545	169547	secretary of state	3113	” Lord Roehampton had a large entailed estate , though his affairs were always in a state of confusion . That seems almost the inevitable result of being absorbed in the great business of governing mankind . If there be exceptions among statesmen of the highest class , they will generally be found among those who have been chiefly in opposition , and so have had leisure and freedom of mind sufficient to manage their estates . Lord Roehampton had , however , extensive powers of charging his estate in lieu of dower , and he had employed them to their utmost extent ; so his widow was well provided for . The executors were Mr. Sidney Wilton and Endymion . After a short period , Lady Roehampton saw Adriana , and not very long after , Lady Montfort . They both of them , from that time , were her frequent , if not constant , companions , but she saw no one else . Once only , since the terrible event , was she seen by the world , and that was when a tall figure , shrouded in the darkest attire , attended as chief mourner at the burial of her lord in Westminster Abbey . She remained permanently in London , not only because she had no country house , but because she wished to be with her brother . As time advanced , she frequently saw Mr. Sidney Wilton , who , being chief executor of the will , and charged with all her affairs , had necessarily much on which to consult her . One of the greatest difficulties was to provide her with a suitable residence , for of course , she was not to remain in the family mansion in St. James ’ Square . That difficulty was ultimately overcome in a manner highly interesting to her feelings . Her father ’s mansion in Hill Street , where she had passed her prosperous and gorgeous childhood , was in the market , and she was most desirous to occupy it . “
169934	169940	170612	170613	Your ladyship	5456	” she said to Endymion . “
170085	170611	170612	170613	Your ladyship	5456	” There was one difficulty still in this arrangement . The mansion in Hill Street was not to be let , it was for sale , and the price naturally for such a mansion in such a situation , was considerable ; quite beyond the means of Lady Roehampton who had a very ample income , but no capital . This difficulty , however , vanished in a moment . Mr. Sidney Wilton purchased the house ; he wanted an investment , and this was an excellent one ; so Lady Roehampton became his tenant . The change was great in the life of Myra , and she felt it . She loved her lord , and had cut off her beautiful hair , which reached almost to her feet , and had tied it round his neck in his coffin . But Myra , notwithstanding she was a woman , and a woman of transcendent beauty , had never had a romance of the heart . Until she married , her pride and love for her brother , which was part of her pride , had absorbed her being . When she married , and particularly as time advanced , she felt all the misery of her existence had been removed , and nothing could exceed the tenderness and affectionate gratitude , and truly unceasing devotion , which she extended to the gifted being to who she owed this deliverance . But it was not in the nature of things that she could experience those feelings which still echo in the heights of Meilleraie , and compared with which all the glittering accidents of fortune sink into insignificance . The year rolled on , an agitated year of general revolution . Endymion himself was rarely in society , for all the time which the House of Commons spared to him he wished chiefly to dedicate to his sister . His brougham was always ready to take him up to Hill Street for one of those somewhat hurried , but amusing little dinners , which break the monotony of parliamentary life . And sometimes he brought a companion , generally Mr. Wilton , and sometimes they met Lady Montfort or Adriana , now ennobled as the daughter of Lord Hainault . There was much to talk about , even if they did not talk about themselves and their friends , for every day brought great events , fresh insurrections , new constitutions , changes of dynasties , assassinations of ministers , states of siege , evanescent empires , and premature republics . On one occasion , having previously prepared his sister , who seemed not uninterested by the suggestion , Endymion brought Thornberry to dine in Hill Street . There was no one else present except Adriana . Job was a great admirer of Lady Roehampton , but was a little awestruck by her . He remembered her in her childhood , a beautiful being who never smiled . She received him very graciously , and after dinner , inviting him to sit by her on the sofa , referred with delicacy to old times . “

170635	170642	170814	170814	I	0	” said Myra , unaffectedly surprised . “

170963	170964	170973	170973	she	7422	” “
170968	170972	171059	171059	I	0	” continued Thornberry , “

171078	171298	171383	171383	her	5491	” murmured Lady Roehampton . In time , though no one mentioned it , everybody thought that if an alliance ultimately took place between Lady Roehampton and Mr. Sidney Wilton , it would be the most natural thing in the world , and everybody would approve it . True , he was her father ’s friend , and much her senior , but then he was still good - looking , very clever , very much considered , and lord of a large estate , and at any rate he was a younger man than her late husband . When these thoughts became more rife in society , and began to take the form of speech , the year was getting old , and this reminds us of a little incident which took place many months previously , at the beginning of the year , and which we ought to record . Shortly after the death of Lord Roehampton , Prince Florestan called one morning in St. James ’ Square . He said he would not ask Lady Roehampton to see him , but he was obliged suddenly to leave England , and he did not like to depart without personally inquiring after her . He left a letter and a little packet . And the letter ran thus : “
171415	171418	171816	171816	Vallombrosa	572	“ Florestan . ”
171805	171814	171816	171816	Vallombrosa	572	“ They will not wait for our arrival , ”
171818	171833	171924	171924	he	7878	“ but , trusting to their numbers , will come out and attack us . ”
171941	171953	171924	171924	he	7878	“ My men , this is the sword of my father ! ”
171954	171959	172374	172374	Waldershare	641	“ Florestan for ever ! ”
172363	172372	172374	172374	Waldershare	641	“ If he declares for the English alliance , ”
172376	172381	172624	172629	the house of Saxe - Genesis	5582	“ he is safe ; ”
172643	172648	173246	173247	a servant	7993	“ Almanach de Gotha , ”
173235	173244	173246	173247	a servant	7993	“ Your carriage is ready , my lady , ”
173249	173334	173335	173336	Lady Roehampton	499	“ but there is a gentleman below who has brought a letter for your ladyship , and which , he says , he must personally deliver to you , madam . I told him your ladyship was going out and could not see him , but he put his card in this envelope , and requested that I would hand it to you , madam . He says he will only deliver the letter to your ladyship , and not detain you a moment . ”
173346	173353	173362	173362	she	499	“ The Duke of St. Angelo . ”
173354	173361	173380	173380	she	499	“ The Duke of St. Angelo ! ”
173383	173390	173396	173397	the duke	6633	“ He must be shown up . ”
173391	173394	173380	173380	she	499	“ Madam , ”
173408	173491	173380	173380	she	499	“ I am ashamed of appearing to be an intruder , but my commands were to deliver this letter to your ladyship immediately on my arrival , whatever the hour . I have only this instant arrived . We had a bad passage . I know your ladyship ’s carriage is at the door . I will redeem my pledge and not trespass on your time for one instant . If your ladyship requires me , I am ever at your command . ”
173492	173497	173380	173380	she	499	“ At Carlton Gardens ? ”
173498	173505	173380	173380	she	499	“ No ; at our embassy . ”
173506	173516	173380	173380	she	499	“ His Majesty , I hope , is well ? ”
173517	173525	173562	173562	she	5605	“ In every sense , my lady , ”
173565	173648	173684	173684	I	0	“ You were the only person I called upon when I suddenly left England . I had no hope of seeing you , but it was the homage of gratitude and adoration . Great events have happened since we last met . I have realised my dreams , dreams which I sometimes fancied you , and you alone , did not depreciate or discredit , and , in the sweetness of your charity , would not have been sorry were they accomplished . “
173704	173765	173684	173684	I	0	“ My subjects are anxious that the dynasty I have re - established should not be evanescent . Is it too bold to hope that I may find a companion in you to charm and to counsel me ? I can offer you nothing equal to your transcendent merit , but I can offer you the heart and the throne of “
173768	173938	173939	173939	I	0	” Still holding the letter in one hand , she looked around as if some one might be present . Her cheek was scarlet , and there was for a moment an expression of wildness in her glance . Then she paced the saloon with an agitated step , and then she read the letter again and again , and still she paced the saloon . The whole history of her life revolved before her ; every scene , every character , every thought , and sentiment , and passion . The brightness of her nursery days , and Hurstley with all its miseries , and Hainault with its gardens , and the critical hour , which had opened to her a future of such unexpected lustre and happiness . The clock had struck more than once during this long and terrible soliloquy , wherein she had to search and penetrate her inmost heart , and now it struck two . She started , and hurriedly rang the bell . “
173949	174980	174995	174995	She	6987	” she said , and when again alone , she sat down and , burying her face in her alabaster arms , for a long time remained motionless . Had he been a youth about to make a debut in the great world , Sidney Wilton could not have been more agitated than he felt at the prospect of the fete at Montfort House . Lady Roehampton , after nearly two years of retirement , was about to re - enter society . During this interval she had not been estranged from him . On the contrary , he had been her frequent and customary companion . Except Adriana , and Lady Montfort , and her brother , it might almost be said , her only one . Why then was he agitated ? He had been living in a dream for two years , cherishing wild thoughts of exquisite happiness . He would have been content , had the dream never been disturbed ; but this return to hard and practical life of her whose unconscious witchery had thrown a spell over his existence , roused him to the reality of his position , and it was one of terrible emotion . During the life of her husband , Sidney Wilton had been the silent adorer of Myra . With every accomplishment and every advantage that are supposed to make life delightful — a fine countenance , a noble mien , a manner natural and attractive , an ancient lineage , and a vast estate — he was the favourite of society , who did more than justice to his talents , which , though not brilliant , were considerable , and who could not too much appreciate the high tone of his mind ; his generosity and courage , and true patrician spirit which inspired all his conduct , and guided him ever to do that which was liberal , and gracious , and just . There was only one fault which society found in Sidney Wilton ; he would not marry . This was provoking , because he was the man of all others who ought to marry , and make a heroine happy . Society did not give it up till he was forty , about the time he became acquainted with Lady Roehampton ; and that incident threw no light on his purposes or motives , for he was as discreet as he was devoted , and Myra herself was unconscious of his being anything to her save the dearest friend of her father , and the most cherished companion of her husband . When one feels deeply , one is apt to act suddenly , perhaps rashly . There are moments in life when suspense can be borne no longer . And Sidney Wilton , who had been a silent votary for more than ten years , now felt that the slightest delay in his fate would be intolerable . It was the ball at Montfort House that should be the scene of this decision of destiny . She was about to re - enter society , radiant as the morn , amid flowers and music , and all the accidents of social splendour . His sympathetic heart had been some solace to her in her sorrow and her solitude . Now , in the joyous blaze of life , he was resolved to ask her whether it were impossible that they should never again separate , and in the crowd , as well as when alone , feel their mutual devotion . Mr. Wilton was among those who went early to Montfort House , which was not his wo nt ; but he was restless and disquieted . She could hardly have arrived ; but there would be some there who would speak of her . That was a great thing . Sidney Wilton had arrived at that state when conversation can only interest on one subject . When a man is really in love , he is disposed to believe that , like himself , everybody is thinking of the person who engrosses his brain and heart . The magnificent saloons , which in half an hour would be almost impassable , were only sprinkled with guests , who , however , were constantly arriving . Mr. Wilton looked about him in vain for the person who , he was quite sure , could not then be present . He lingered by the side of Lady Montfort , who bowed to those who came , but who could spare few consecutive words , even to Mr. Wilton , for her watchful eye expected every moment to be summoned to descend her marble staircase and receive her royal guests . The royal guests arrived ; there was a grand stir , and many gracious bows , and some cordial , but dignified , shake - hands . The rooms were crowded ; yet space in the ball - room was well preserved , so that the royal vision might range with facility from its golden chairs to the beauteous beings , and still more beautiful costumes , displaying with fervent loyalty their fascinating charms . There was a new band to - night , that had come from some distant but celebrated capital ; musicians known by fame to everybody , but whom nobody had ever heard . They played wonderfully on instruments of new invention , and divinely upon old ones . It was impossible that anything could be more gay and inspiring than their silver bugles , and their carillons of tinkling bells . They found an echo in the heart of Sidney Wilton , who , seated near the entrance of the ball - room , watched every arrival with anxious expectation . But the anxiety vanished for a moment under the influence of the fantastic and frolic strain . It seemed a harbinger of happiness and joy . He fell into a reverie , and wandered with a delightful companion in castles of perpetual sunshine , and green retreats , and pleasant terraces . But the lady never came . “
174987	174994	175018	175018	her	6987	” said Lady Montfort to Endymion . “
175011	175012	175025	175025	She	6987	” “
175040	175060	175025	175025	She	6987	“ I hope she will be in time for the royal supper table ; I quite count on her . ”
175061	175069	175206	175206	Europe	530	“ She is sure to be here . ”
175188	175204	175206	175206	Europe	530	“ As long as Sergius sways his councils , He will indulge in no adventures , ”
175208	175222	175271	175271	his	571	“ As long as Sergius remains here , the English alliance is safe , ”
175254	175265	175271	175271	his	571	“ Your master has only to be liberal and steady , ”
175280	175305	175314	175314	Sergius	376	“ and he may have anything he likes . But we do not want any wars ; they are not liked in the City . ”
175306	175312	175328	175329	Mr. Waldershare	442	“ Our policy is peace , ”
175316	175326	175342	175342	he	442	“ I think we ought to congratulate Sir Peter , ”
175350	175368	175384	175387	the former Mr. Vigo	5620	“ Sir Peter , here is a lady who wishes to congratulate you on your deserved elevation . ”
175369	175382	175384	175387	the former Mr. Vigo	5620	“ Well , I do not know what to say about it , ”
175397	175404	175412	175412	Waldershare	442	“ my friends would have it . ”
175405	175410	175412	175412	Waldershare	442	“ Ay , ay , ”
175414	175432	175471	175471	Waldershare	442	“ ‘ at the request of friends ; ’ the excuse I gave for publishing my sonnets . ”
175455	175469	175478	175479	Lady Hainault	661	“ We have just been congratulating the new baronet , Sir Peter Vigo , ”
175473	175476	175478	175479	Lady Hainault	661	“ Ah ! ”
175485	175567	175577	175579	Mr. St. Barbe	428	“ he is , at any rate , not obliged to change his name . The desire to change one ’s name does indeed appear to me to be a singular folly . If your name had been disgraced , I could understand it , as I could understand a man then going about in a mask . But the odd thing is , the persons who always want to change their names are those whose names are the most honoured . ”
175568	175575	175478	175479	Lady Hainault	661	“ Oh , you are here ! ”
175586	175692	175702	175704	Mr. Seymour Hicks	429	“ I think you are everywhere . I suppose they will make you a baronet next . Have you seen the batch ? I could not believe my eyes when I read it . I believe the government is demented . Not a single literary man among them . Not that I wanted their baronetcy . Nothing would have tempted me to accept one . But there is Gushy ; he , I know , would have liked it . I must say I feel for Gushy ; his works only selling half what they did , and then thrown over in this insolent manner ! ”
175693	175700	175720	175721	St. Barbe	428	“ Gushy is not in society , ”
175713	175718	175771	175773	Mr. Seymour Hicks	429	“ That is society , ”
175761	175769	175771	175773	Mr. Seymour Hicks	429	“ I dined with the Rodneys yesterday , ”
175775	175782	175790	175791	St. Barbe	428	“ they do the thing well . ”
175783	175788	175790	175791	St. Barbe	428	“ You dined there ! ”
175793	175838	175893	175893	he	396	“ It is very odd , they have never asked me . Not that I would have accepted their invitation . I avoid parvenus . They are too fidgety for my taste . I require repose , and only dine with the old nobility . ”
175902	175924	176053	176053	Job	396	“ No , I do n’t think that will do . Besides , I must be at Hurstley by that time . ”
176038	176051	176053	176053	Job	396	“ There is a charm about the place , I must say , ”
176069	176126	176215	176215	he	5638	“ and yet I hated it as a boy . To be sure , I was then discontented and unhappy , and now I have every reason to be much the reverse . Our feelings affect even scenery . It certainly is a pretty place ; I really think one of the prettiest places in England . ”
176228	176263	176271	176272	the son	1266	“ And when did you arrive , my boy ? I was looking up your train in Bradshaw as I came along . I made out you should get the branch at Culvers Gate . ”
176264	176269	176271	176272	the son	1266	“ I drove over , ”
176274	176301	176307	176308	Job Thornberry	396	“ I and a friend of mine drove tandem , and I ’ll bet we got here sooner than we should have done by the branch . ”
176302	176305	176315	176316	Mrs. Thornberry	602	“ Hem ! ”
176310	176313	176315	176316	Mrs. Thornberry	602	“ Job , ”
176318	176350	176356	176357	Job Thornberry	396	“ I have made two engagements for you this evening . First , we will go and see your father , and then we are to drink tea at the rectory . ”
176351	176354	176356	176357	Job Thornberry	396	“ Hem ! ”
176359	176381	176743	176743	Job	396	“ well , I would rather the first evening should have been a quiet one ; but let it be so . ”
176747	176771	176857	176858	the archbishop	9732	“ I was mentioning to your wife that the archbishop was here , and that I hope you would not dislike meeting him . ”

177094	177119	177132	177133	Job Thornberry	396	“ Do not give me any jewel , dear Job . What I should like would be that you should restore the chapel here . ”
177120	177130	177266	177266	men	1114	“ Restore the chapel here ! oh , oh ! ”
177223	177227	177266	177266	men	1114	“ Mrs. Penruddock , ”

177463	177535	177669	177669	Job	396	“ and can not understand why my wife is so anxious about it as she seems to be . When we first went to London , she always sate under the Reverend Socinus Frost , and seemed very satisfied . I have heard him ; a sensible man — but sermons are not much in my way , and I do not belong to his sect , or indeed any other . ”
177657	177667	177688	177689	John Hampden	555	“ I wonder what became of the communion table ? ”
177671	177686	177688	177689	John Hampden	555	“ Oh ! my dear father , do not call it a communion table , ”
177692	177704	177669	177669	Job	396	“ Why , what should I call it , my boy ? ”
177705	177709	177688	177689	John Hampden	555	“ The altar . ”
177710	177728	177734	177736	the young gentleman	2455	“ Why , what does it signify what we call it ? The thing is the same . ”
177729	177732	177734	177736	the young gentleman	2455	“ Ah ! ”
177745	177787	177797	177798	the archbishop	9732	“ it is all the difference in the world . There should be a stone altar and a reredos . We have put up a reredos in our chapel at Bradley . All the fellows subscribed ; I gave a sovereign . ”
177788	177795	177797	177798	the archbishop	9732	“ Well , I must say , ”
177827	177949	177965	177965	Job	396	“ I think you could hardly do a better thing than restore this chapel , Mr. Thornberry , but there must be no mistake about it . It must be restored to the letter , and it is a style that is not commonly understood . I have a friend , however , who is a master of it , the most rising man in his profession , as far as church architecture is concerned , and I will get him just to run down and look at this , and if , as I hope , you resolve to restore it , rest assured he will do you justice , and you will be proud of your place of worship . ”
177950	177963	177965	177965	Job	396	“ I do not care how much we spend on our gardens , ”
177967	178004	178015	178016	the archbishop	9732	“ for they are transitory pleasures , and we enjoy what we produce ; but why I should restore a chapel in a house which does not belong to myself is not so clear to me . ”
178005	178013	177797	177798	the archbishop	9732	“ But it should belong to yourself , ”
178018	178194	178217	178218	Mrs. Thornberry	602	“ Hurstley is not in the market , but it is to be purchased . Take it altogether , I have always thought it one of the most enviable possessions in the world . The house , when put in order , would be one of the ornaments of the kingdom . The acreage , though considerable , is not overwhelming , and there is a range of wild country of endless charm . I wandered about it in my childhood and my youth , and I have never known anything equal to it . Then as to the soil and all that , you know it . You are a son of the soil . You left it for great objects , and you have attained those objects . They have given you fame as well as fortune . There would be something wonderfully dignified and graceful in returning to the land after you have taken the principal part in solving the difficulties which pertained to it , and emancipating it from many perils . ”
178195	178215	178237	178239	the young gentleman	2455	“ I am sure it would be the happiest day of my life , if Job would purchase Hurstley , ”

178241	178304	178438	178439	Mrs. Penruddock	394	“ If we have not landed property , I would sooner have none . If we have not land , I should like to go into the Church , and if I may not go to Oxford , I would go to Cuddesdon at once . I know it can be done , for I know a fellow who has done it . ”
178448	178502	178582	178583	his Grace	1256	“ I thought I should find you here . I would not have troubled your Grace , but this letter marked ‘ private , immediate , and to be forwarded , ’ has been wandering about for some time , and I thought it was better to bring it to you at once . ”
178571	178580	178582	178583	his Grace	1256	“ I am sorry to quit you all , ”
178585	178600	178829	178830	Lady Montfort	499	“ but I must go up to town immediately . The business is urgent . ”
178821	178827	178854	178854	Endymion	641	“ She was always capricious , ”
178845	178852	178854	178854	Endymion	641	“ Hardly that , I think , ”
178856	178869	178829	178830	Lady Montfort	499	“ I have always looked on Myra as a singularly consistent character . ”
178870	178883	178854	178854	Endymion	641	“ I know , you never admit your sister has a fault . ”
178884	178901	178854	178854	Endymion	641	“ You said the other day yourself that she was the only perfect character you knew . ”
178902	178913	178925	178925	Endymion	641	“ Did I say that ? I think her capricious . ”
178914	178923	178925	178925	Endymion	641	“ I do not think you are capricious , ”
178927	178937	178953	178954	Lady Montfort	499	“ and yet the world sometimes says you are . ”
178938	178951	178953	178954	Lady Montfort	499	“ I change my opinion of persons when my taste is offended , ”
178956	178983	178992	178992	Endymion	641	“ What I admired in your sister , though I confess I sometimes wished not to admire her , was that she never offended my taste . ”
178984	178990	178992	178992	Endymion	641	“ I hope satisfied it , ”
178994	179038	179050	179050	Endymion	641	“ Yes , satisfied it , always satisfied it . I wonder what will be her lot , for , considering her youth , her destiny has hardly begun . Somehow or other , I do not think she will marry Sidney Wilton . ”
179039	179048	179050	179050	Endymion	641	“ I have sometimes thought that would be , ”
179052	179202	179289	179290	Lady Montfort	499	“ Well , it would be , I think , a happy match . All the circumstances would be collected that form what is supposed to be happiness . But tastes differ about destinies as well as about manners . For my part , I think to have a husband who loved you , and he clever , accomplished , charming , ambitious , would be happiness ; but I doubt whether your sister cares so much about these things . She may , of course does , talk to you more freely ; but with others , in her most open hours , there seems a secret fund of reserve in her character which I never could penetrate , except , I think , it is a reserve which does not originate in a love of tranquillity , but quite the reverse . She is a strong character . ”
179203	179211	179050	179050	Endymion	641	“ Then , hardly a capricious one . ”
179212	179264	179276	179276	Endymion	641	“ No , not capricious ; I only said that to tease you . I am capricious ; I know it . I disregard people sometimes that I have patronised and flattered . It is not merely that I have changed my opinion of them , but I positively hate them . ”
179265	179274	179289	179290	Lady Montfort	499	“ I hope you will never hate me , ”
179278	179287	179334	179336	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5721	“ You have never offended my taste yet , ”
179327	179332	179334	179336	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5721	“ He is young , ”
179338	179445	179512	179513	party politicians	5723	“ every political party changes its principles on an average once in ten years . Those who are young must often then form new connections , and Ferrars will then come to me . He will be ripe and experienced , and I could give him a good deal . I do not want numbers . I want men . In opposition , numbers often only embarrass . The power of the future is ministerial capacity . The leader with a cabinet formed will be the minister of England . He is not to trouble himself about numbers ; that is an affair of the constituencies . ”
179522	179525	180164	180164	Endymion	641	“ shop ; ”
180155	180163	180164	180164	Endymion	641	“ What Bertie Tremaine will end in , ”
180169	180279	180290	180290	Trenchard	431	“ perplexes me . Had there been no revolution in 1832 , and he had entered parliament for his family borough , I think he must by this time have been a minister . Such tenacity of purpose could scarcely fail . But he has had to say and do so many odd things , first to get into parliament , and secondly to keep there , that his future now is not so clear . When I first knew him , he was a Benthamite ; at present , I sometimes seem to foresee that he will end by being the leader of the Protectionists and the Protestants . ”
180280	180288	180290	180290	Trenchard	431	“ And a good strong party too , ”
180292	180299	180314	180316	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5746	“ but query whether strong enough ? ”
180300	180313	180588	180588	Waldershare	641	“ That is exactly what Bertie Tremaine is trying to find out . ”
180348	180587	180908	180910	a sensible man	7141	“ No man can tell you what will be the position he may be called upon to fill . But he has a right to assume he will always be ascending . I , for example , may be destined to be the president of a republic , the regent of a monarchy , or a sovereign myself . It would be painful and disagreeable to have to change one ’s manner at a perhaps advanced period of life , and become liable to the unpopular imputation that you had grown arrogant and overbearing . On the contrary , in my case , whatever my elevation , there will be no change . My brother , Mr. Tremaine Bertie , acts on a different principle . He is a Sybarite , and has a general contempt for mankind , certainly for the mob and the middle class , but he is ‘ Hail fellow , well met ! ’ with them all . He says it answers at elections ; I doubt it . I myself represent a popular constituency , but I believe I owe my success in no slight measure to the manner in which I gave my hand when I permitted it to be touched . As I say sometimes to Mr. Tremaine Bertie , ‘ You will find this habit of social familiarity embarrassing when I send you to St. Petersburg or Vienna . ’ ”
180898	180906	180908	180910	a sensible man	7141	“ And yet he has his mortifications , ”
180912	180931	180943	180945	the fiery Waldershare	641	“ He wants a wife , and the princesses of the world will not furnish him with one . ”
180932	180941	180943	180945	the fiery Waldershare	641	“ What authority have you for saying so ? ”
180947	180975	180908	180910	a sensible man	7141	“ The princesses of the world would be great fools if they refused such a man , but I know of no authentic instance of such denial . ”
180976	180985	180908	180910	a sensible man	7141	“ Well , it is the common rumour . ”
180986	180996	181004	181006	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5770	“ And , therefore , probably a common falsehood . ”
180997	181002	181004	181006	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5770	“ Were he wise , ”
181008	181072	181092	181092	Trenchard	431	“ King Florestan would not marry . Dynasties are unpopular ; especially new ones . The present age is monarchical , but not dynastic . The king , who is a man of reach , and who has been pondering such circumstances all his life , is probably well aware of this , and will not be such a fool as to marry . ”
181073	181090	181092	181092	Trenchard	431	“ How is the monarchy to go on , if there is to be no successor ? ”
181094	181103	181122	181124	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5771	“ You would not renew the Polish constitution ? ”
181104	181120	181122	181124	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5771	“ The Polish constitution , by the by , was not so bad a thing , ”
181126	181254	181301	181301	Waldershare	641	“ Under it a distinguished Englishman might have mixed with the crowned heads of Europe , as Sir Philip Sidney nearly did . But I was looking to something superior to the Polish constitution , or perhaps any other ; I was contemplating a monarchy with the principle of adoption . That would give you all the excellence of the Polish constitution , and the order and constancy in which it failed . It would realise the want of the age ; monarchical , not dynastical , institutions , and it would act independent of the passions and intrigues of the multitude . The principle of adoption was the secret of the strength and endurance of Rome . It gave Rome alike the Scipios and the Antonines . ”
181255	181269	181277	181279	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5772	“ A court would be rather dull without a woman at its head . ”
181270	181275	181277	181279	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5772	“ On the contrary , ”
181281	181295	181301	181301	Waldershare	641	“ It was Louis Quatorze who made the court ; not his queen . ”
181296	181299	181301	181301	Waldershare	641	“ Well , ”
181303	181369	181301	181301	Waldershare	641	“ all the same , I fear King Florestan will adopt no one in this room , though he has several friends here , and I am one ; and I believe that he will marry , and I can not help fancying that the partner of this throne will not be as insignificant as Louis the Fourteenth ’s wife , or Catherine of Braganza . ”
181393	181396	181408	181408	he	5773	“ Precursor , ”
181422	181424	181408	181408	he	5773	“ Precursor ”
181460	181462	181495	181495	He	5780	“ Precursor ”
181516	181526	181636	181637	the host	7664	“ All are but parts of one stupendous whole , ”
181625	181633	181636	181637	the host	7664	“ I do not see your difficulty , ”
181639	181671	181682	181683	Mr. Jawett	427	“ Your case is clear . You have a principle which will carry you through everything . That is the charm of a principle . You have always an answer ready . ”
181672	181678	181682	181683	Mr. Jawett	427	“ But in this case , ”
181685	181697	181705	181707	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5789	“ what would be the principle on which I should rest ? ”
181698	181703	181705	181707	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5789	“ You must show , ”
181709	181732	181733	181734	Even Jawett	427	“ that democracy is aristocracy in disguise ; and that aristocracy is democracy in disguise . It will carry you through everything . ”
181740	181741	181746	181748	Mr. Bertie Tremaine	5790	“ But”—he
181751	181826	182062	182062	she	499	“ Think of what I have said , and if on reflection any doubt or difficulty remain in your mind , call on me to - morrow before I go to the House . At present , I must pay my respects to Lady Beaumaris . She is the only woman the Tories can boast of ; but she is a first - rate woman , and is a power which I must secure . ”
182054	182061	182062	182062	she	499	“ I know what he means , ”
182065	182496	182597	182597	she	466	“ he wants the world to believe that we are separated . He can not repudiate me — he is too great a gentleman to do anything coarsely unjust ; but he thinks , by tact and indirect means , he may achieve our virtual separation . He has had this purpose for years , I believe now ever since our marriage , but hitherto I have baffled him . I ought to be with him ; I really believe he is indisposed , his face has become so pale of late ; but were I to persist in going to Princedown I should only drive him away . He would go off into the night without leaving his address , and something would happen — dreadful or absurd . What I had best do , I think , is this . You are going at last to pay your visit to your sister ; I will write to my lord and tell him that as he does not wish me to go to Princedown , I propose to go to Montfort Castle . When the flag is flying at Montfort , I can pay a visit of any length to my family . It will only be a neighbouring visit from Montfort to them ; perhaps , too , they might return it . At any rate , then they can not say my lord and I are separated . We need not live under the same roof , but so long as I live under his roof the world considers us united . It is a pity to have to scheme in this manner , and rather degrading , particularly when one might be so happy with him . But you know , my dear Endymion , all about our affairs . Your friend is not a very happy woman , and if not a very unhappy one , it is owing much to your dear friendship , and a little to my own spirit which keeps me up under what is frequent and sometimes bitter mortification . And now adieu ! I suppose you can not be away less than a week . Probably on your return you will find me here . I can not go to Montfort without his permission . But he will give it . I observe that he will always do anything to gain his immediate object . His immediate object is , that I shall not go to Princedown , and so he will agree that I shall go to Montfort . ”
182589	182596	182597	182597	she	466	“ It is a long separation , ”
182610	182674	182686	182686	Endymion	641	“ and you must be a little wearied with your travelling . Come and refresh yourself , and then I will show you my boudoir I have made here ; rather pretty , out of nothing . And then we will sit down and have a long talk together , for I have much to tell you , and I want your advice . ”
182675	182684	182597	182597	she	466	“ She is going to marry Sidney Wilton , ”
182688	182693	182597	182597	she	466	“ that is clear . ”
182700	182706	182788	182788	He	641	“ made out of nothing ; ”
182804	182842	182854	182855	Lady Montfort	499	“ My visit here will be short . I am to see you immediately . Nothing must prevent your being at home when I call to - morrow , about four o’clock . Most , most important . ”
182843	182852	182854	182855	Lady Montfort	499	“ Well , something has happened at last , ”
182861	182867	182879	182879	Endymion	641	“ it is too marvellous . ”
182868	182877	182879	182879	Endymion	641	“ She goes to Osborne to - day , ”
182881	182970	182854	182855	Lady Montfort	499	“ and I suppose after that , in due course , it will be generally known . I should think the formal announcement would be made abroad . It has been kept wonderfully close . She wished you to know it first , at least from her . I do not think she ever hesitated about accepting him . There was delay from various causes ; whether there should be a marriage by proxy first in this country , and other points ; about religion , for example . ”
182971	182974	182854	182855	Lady Montfort	499	“ Well ? ”
182975	183032	182879	182879	Endymion	641	“ She enters the Catholic Church , the Archbishop of Tyre has received her . There is no difficulty and no great ceremonies in such matters . She was re - baptized , but only by way of precaution . It was not necessary , for our baptism , you know , is recognised by Rome . ”
183033	183039	182854	182855	Lady Montfort	499	“ And that was all ! ”
183040	183084	182854	182855	Lady Montfort	499	“ All , with a first communion and confession . It is all consummated now ; as you say , ‘ It is too wonderful . ’ A first confession , and to Nigel Penruddock , who says life is flat and insipid ! ”
183085	183109	182854	182855	Lady Montfort	499	“ I shall write to her : I must write to her . I wonder if I shall see her before she departs . ”
183110	183123	182854	182855	Lady Montfort	499	“ That is certain if you wish it ; she wishes it . ”
183124	183137	183148	183148	Endymion	641	“ And when does she go ? And who goes with her ? ”
183138	183146	183148	183148	Endymion	641	“ She will be under my charge , ”
183150	183202	182854	182855	Lady Montfort	499	“ It is fortunate that it should happen at a time when I am free . I am personally to deliver her to the king . The Duke of St. Angelo , Baron Sergius , and the archbishop accompany her , and Waldershare , at the particular request of his Majesty . ”
183203	183208	182854	182855	Lady Montfort	499	“ And no lady ? ”
183209	183216	183222	183223	Lady Montfort	499	“ She takes Adriana with her . ”
183217	183220	183241	183242	Lady Montfort	499	“ Adriana ! ”
183245	183253	183262	183262	Endymion	641	“ I wish she would take me . ”
183254	183260	183262	183262	Endymion	641	“ That would be delightful , ”
183264	183281	183293	183294	Lady Montfort	499	“ and most becoming — to have for a companion the greatest lady of our court . ”
183282	183291	183328	183328	she	499	“ She will not take me with her , ”
183305	183327	183328	183328	she	499	“ Dear woman ! I loved her always , often most when I seemed least affectionate — but there was between us something”—and
183331	183380	183875	183875	her	466	“ Heigho ! I may be the greatest lady of our court , but I am a very unhappy woman , Endymion , and what annoys and dispirits me most , sometimes quite breaks me down , is that I can not see that I deserve my lot . ”
183887	183897	184145	184145	He	641	“ Women will be your best friends in life . ”
184134	184144	184180	184181	Lady Montfort	499	“ You are thinking of your sister , Endymion ? ”
184159	184178	184180	184181	Lady Montfort	499	“ This separation is a trial , a severe one , and I knew you would feel it , ”
184183	184209	184408	184409	Lady Montfort	499	“ I feel it ; I loved your sister , but she did not love me . Nobody that I love ever does love me . ”
184210	184221	184180	184181	Lady Montfort	499	“ Oh ! do not say that , Lady Montfort . ”
184222	184276	184180	184181	Lady Montfort	499	“ It is what I feel . I can not console you . There is nothing I can do for you . My friendship , if you value it , which I will not doubt you do , you fully possessed before your sister was a Queen . So that goes for nothing . ”
184277	184288	184408	184409	Lady Montfort	499	“ I must say , I feel sometimes most miserable . ”
184289	184375	184180	184181	Lady Montfort	499	“ Nonsense , Endymion ; if anything could annoy your sister more than another , it would be to hear of such feelings on your part . I must say she has courage . She has found her fitting place . Her brother ought to do the same . You have a great object in life , at least you had , but I have no faith in sentimentalists . If I had been sentimental , I should have gone into a convent long ago . ”
184376	184391	184408	184409	Lady Montfort	499	“ If to feel is to be sentimental , I can not help it . ”
184392	184406	184408	184409	Lady Montfort	499	“ All feeling which has no object to attain is morbid and maudlin , ”
184411	184478	184491	184491	Endymion	641	“ You say you are very miserable , and at the same time you do not know what you want . Would you have your sister dethroned ? And if you would , could you accomplish your purpose ? Well , then , what nonsense to think about her except to feel proud of her elevation , and prouder still that she is equal to it ! ”
184479	184489	184499	184500	Lady Montfort	499	“ You always have the best of every argument , ”
184493	184497	184499	184500	Lady Montfort	499	“ Of course , ”
184502	184711	184491	184491	Endymion	641	“ What I want you to do is to exert yourself . You have now a strong social position , for Sidney Wilton tells me the Queen has relinquished to you her mansion and the whole of her income , which is no mean one . You must collect your friends about you . Our government is not too strong , I can tell you . We must brush up in the recess . What with Mr. Bertie Tremaine and his friends joining the Protectionists , and the ultra - Radicals wanting , as they always do , something impossible , I see seeds of discomfiture unless they are met with energy . You stand high , and are well spoken of even by our opponents . Whether we stand or fall , it is a moment for you to increase your personal influence . That is the element now to encourage in your career , because you are not like the old fogies in the cabinet , who , if they go out , will never enter another again . You have a future , and though you may not be an emperor , you may be what I esteem more , prime minister of this country . ”
184712	184719	184499	184500	Lady Montfort	499	“ You are always so sanguine . ”
184720	184759	184865	184865	his	5845	“ Not more sanguine than your sister . Often we have talked of this . I wish she were here to help us , but I will do my part . At present let us go to luncheon . ”
184868	184878	185174	185174	she	466	“ the inviolate island of the sage and free . ”
185167	185173	185174	185174	she	466	“ It is a trial , ”
185177	185193	185225	185225	Waldershare	641	“ but all that I love and value in this world are in this vessel , ”
185218	185223	185225	185225	Waldershare	641	“ I must say , ”
185227	185347	185431	185431	Adriana	481	“ it was a grand idea of our kings making themselves sovereigns of the sea . The greater portion of this planet is water ; so we at once became a first - rate power . We owe our navy entirely to the Stuarts . King James the Second was the true founder and hero of the British navy . He was the worthy son of his admirable father , that blessed martyr , the restorer at least , if not the inventor , of ship money ; the most patriotic and popular tax that ever was devised by man . The Nonconformists thought themselves so wise in resisting it , and they have got the naval estimates instead ! ”
185468	185489	185552	185559	a man who never recurred to the past	5881	“ It is a fascinating sight , Miss Neuchatel , and it seems one might gaze on it for ever . ”
185490	185503	185431	185431	Adriana	481	“ Ah ! Lord Waldershare , you caught me in a reverie . ”
185504	185509	185549	185550	The archbishop	9732	“ What more sweet ? ”
185510	185548	185612	185612	he	9732	“ Well , that depends on its subject . To tell the truth , I was thinking that these lights resembled a little your conversation ; all the wondrous things you are always saying or telling us . ”
185622	185732	185745	185745	Endymion	641	“ I trace the hand of Providence in every incident of your sister ’s life . What we deemed misfortunes , sorrows , even calamities , were forming a character originally endowed with supreme will , and destined for the highest purposes . There was a moment at Hurstley when I myself was crushed to the earth , and cared not to live ; vain , short - sighted mortal ! Our great Master was at that moment shaping everything to His ends , and preparing for the entrance into His Church of a woman who may be , who will be , I believe , another St. Helena . ”
185733	185743	185745	185745	Endymion	641	“ We have not spoken of this subject before , ”
185747	185790	185811	185812	the archbishop	9732	“ and I should not have cared had our silence continued , but I must now tell you frankly , the secession of my sister from the Church of her fathers was to me by no means a matter of unmixed satisfaction . ”
185791	185809	185832	185832	Endymion	641	“ The time will come when you will recognise it as the consummation of a Divine plan , ”
185814	185830	185832	185832	Endymion	641	“ I feel great confidence that my sister will never be the slave of superstition , ”
185834	185864	185880	185881	his companion	714	“ Her mind is too masculine for that ; she will remember that the throne she fills has been already once lost by the fatal influence of the Jesuits . ”
185865	185878	185880	185881	his companion	714	“ The influence of the Jesuits is the influence of Divine truth , ”
185883	185936	185832	185832	Endymion	641	“ And how is it possible for such influence not to prevail ? What you treat as defeats , discomfitures , are events which you do not comprehend . They are incidents all leading to one great end — the triumph of the Church — that is , the triumph of God . ”
185937	185978	185880	185881	his companion	714	“ I will not decide what are great ends ; I am content to ascertain what is wise conduct . And it would not be wise conduct , in my opinion , for the King to rest upon the Jesuits . ”
185979	186051	186061	186061	Endymion	641	“ The Jesuits never fell except from conspiracy against them . It is never the public voice that demands their expulsion or the public effort that accomplishes it . It is always the affair of sovereigns and statesmen , of politicians , of men , in short , who feel that there is a power at work , and that power one not favourable to their schemes or objects of government . ”
186052	186059	186061	186061	Endymion	641	“ Well , we shall see , ”
186063	186093	186100	186100	Nigel	548	“ I candidly tell you , I hope the Jesuits will have as little influence in my brother - in - law ’s kingdom as in my own country . ”
186094	186098	186100	186100	Nigel	548	“ As little ! ”
186105	186129	186061	186061	Endymion	641	“ I should be almost content if the holy order in every country had as much influence as they now have in England . ”
186130	186137	186147	186148	the archbishop	9732	“ I think your Grace exaggerates . ”
186138	186145	186147	186148	the archbishop	9732	“ Before two years are past , ”
186154	186174	186519	186519	her	8539	“ I foresee that the Jesuits will be privileged in England , and the hierarchy of our Church recognised . ”
186525	186537	187423	187423	Endymion	641	“ My best beloved , this , this indeed is joy . ”
187407	187421	187447	187448	Miss Neuchatel	502	“ I think you enjoy our visit more than any one of us , ”
187435	187445	187447	187448	Miss Neuchatel	502	“ Well , one can not mope for ever , ”
187450	187472	187522	187522	they	5990	“ I have passed my life in thinking of one subject , and I feel now it made me very stupid . ”
187515	187520	187552	187552	he	428	“ our own correspondents , ”
187559	187796	187807	187807	Waldershare	673	“ Merely to allow him to travel in foreign parts , which he has never done , without a single qualification for the office ! However , it will ruin his paper , that is some consolation . Fancy sending here a man who has never used his pen except about those dismal statistics , and what he calls first principles ! I hate his style , so neat and frigid . No colour , sir . I hate his short sentences , like a dog barking ; we want a word - painter here , sir . My description of the wedding sold one hundred and fifty thousand , and it is selling now . If the proprietors were gentlemen , they would have sent me an unlimited credit , instead of their paltry fifty pounds a day and my expenses ; but you never meet a liberal man now,—no such animal known . What I want you to do for me , Lord Waldershare , is to get me invited to the Villa Aurea when the court moves there . It will be private life there , and that is the article the British public want now . They are satiated with ceremonies and festivals . They want to know what the royal pair have for dinner when they are alone , how they pass their evenings , and whether the queen drives ponies . ”
187797	187805	187807	187807	Waldershare	673	“ So far as I am concerned , ”
187809	187816	187828	187829	St. Barbe	428	“ they shall remain state secrets . ”
187817	187826	187828	187829	St. Barbe	428	“ I have received no special favours here , ”
187831	187962	187978	187978	Waldershare	673	“ though , with my claims , I might have counted on the uttermost . However , it is always so . I must depend on my own resources . I have a retainer , I can tell you , my lord , from the ‘ Rigdum Funidos , ’ in my pocket , and it is in my power to keep up such a crackling of jokes and sarcasms that a very different view would soon be entertained in Europe of what is going on here than is now the fashion . The ‘ Rigdum Funidos ’ is on the breakfast - table of all England , and sells thousands in every capital of the world . You do not appreciate its power ; you will now feel it . ”
187963	187976	187978	187978	Waldershare	673	“ I also am a subscriber to the ‘ Rigdum Funidos , ’ ”
187980	188043	188053	188054	St. Barbe	428	“ and tell you frankly , Mr. St. Barbe , that if I see in its columns the slightest allusion to any persons or incident in this country , I will take care that you be instantly consigned to the galleys ; and , this being a liberal government , I can do that without even the ceremony of a primary inquiry . ”
188044	188051	188053	188054	St. Barbe	428	“ You do not mean that ? ”
188056	188230	188326	188326	him	673	“ of course , I was only jesting . It is not likely that I should say or do anything disagreeable to those whom I look upon as my patrons — I may say friends — through life . It makes me almost weep when I remember my early connection with Mr. Ferrars , now an under - secretary of state , and who will mount higher . I never had a chance of being a minister , though I suppose I am not more incapable than others who get the silver spoon into their mouths . And then his divine sister ! Quite an heroic character ! I never had a sister , and so I never had even a chance of being nearly related to royalty . But so it has been throughout my life . No luck , my lord ; no luck . And then they say one is misanthropical . Hang it ! who can help being misanthropical when he finds everybody getting on in life except himself ? ”
188329	188333	188593	188594	The queen	8539	“ lovable eccentricity . ”
188550	188592	188628	188628	she	8539	“ Yes , my dear Ferrars , we did so agree , but the agreement was permissive , not compulsory . My views are changed . Perhaps I shall never return to England again ; I think of being naturalised here . ”
188646	188710	188717	188717	Endymion	425	“ The king has invited Lord and Lady Beaumaris to pay us a visit , and they are coming at once . I had hoped the dear Hainaults might have visited us here . I think she would have liked it . However , they will certainly pass the winter with us . It is some consolation to me not to lose Adriana . ”
188711	188715	188717	188717	Endymion	425	“ The greatest , ”
188719	188732	188742	188743	the queen	8539	“ and she seems so happy here . She seems quite changed . ”
188733	188740	188742	188743	the queen	8539	“ I hope she is happier , ”
188745	188849	188858	188859	The queen	8539	“ but I trust she is not changed . I think her nearly perfection . So pure , even so exalted a mind , joined with so sweet a temper , I have never met . And she is very much admired too , I can tell you . The Prince of Arragon would be on his knees to her to - morrow , if she would only give a single smile . But she smiles enough with the Princess of Montserrat . I heard her the other day absolutely in uncontrollable laughter . That is a strange friendship ; it amuses me . ”
188850	188857	188912	188912	she	8539	“ The princess has immense resource . ”
188871	188910	188912	188912	she	8539	“ Why do we talk of her , or of any other trifler of the court , when there hangs over us so great a sorrow , Endymion , as our separation ? Endymion , my best beloved , ”
188920	188943	188742	188743	the queen	8539	“ my heart ! my life ! Is it possible that you can leave me , and so miserable as I am ? ”
188944	188947	188912	188912	she	8539	“ Miserable ! ”
188948	189196	188912	188912	she	8539	“ Yes ! miserable when I think of your position — and even my own . Mine own has risen like a palace in a dream , and may vanish like one . But that would not be a calamity if you were safe . If I quitted this world to - morrow , where would you be ? It gives me sleepless nights and anxious days . If you really loved me as you say , you would save me this . I am haunted with the perpetual thought that all this glittering prosperity will vanish as it did with our father . God forbid that , under any circumstances , it should lead to such an end — but who knows ? Fate is terribly stern ; ironically just . O Endymion ! if you really love me , your twin , half of your blood and life , who have laboured for you so much , and thought for you so much , and prayed for you so much — and yet I sometimes feel have done so little — O Endymion ! my adored , my own Endymion , if you wish to preserve my life — if you wish me not only to live , but really to be happy as I ought to be and could be , but for one dark thought , help me , aid me , save me — you can , and by one single act . ”
189197	189202	188742	188743	the queen	8539	“ One single act ! ”
189203	189209	189215	189215	he	6017	“ Yes ! marry Adriana . ”
189210	189213	189251	189251	she	6018	“ Ah ! ”
189218	189249	189273	189273	he	6017	“ Yes , Adriana , to whom we both of us owe everything . Were it not for Adriana , you would not be here , you would be nothing , ”
189267	189272	189273	189273	he	6017	“ Is it possible ? ”
189276	189324	189251	189251	she	6018	“ My sister , my beloved sister , I have tried to keep my brain cool in many trials . But I feel , as it were , as if life were too much for me . You counsel me to that which we should all repent . ”
189325	189608	189273	189273	he	6017	“ Yes , I know it ; you may for a moment think it a sacrifice , but believe me , that is all phantasy . I know you think your heart belongs to another . I will grant everything , willingly grant everything you could say of her . Yes , I admit , she is beautiful , she has many charms , has been to you a faithful friend , you delight in her society ; such things have happened before to many men , to every man they say they happen , but that has not prevented them from being wise , and very happy too . Your present position , if you persist in it , is one most perilous . You have no root in the country ; but for an accident you could not maintain the public position you have nobly gained . As for the great crowning consummation of your life , which we dreamed over at unhappy Hurstley , which I have sometimes dared to prophesy , that must be surrendered . The country at the best will look upon you only as a reputable adventurer to be endured , even trusted and supported , in some secondary post , but nothing more . I touch on this , for I see it is useless to speak of myself and my own fate and feelings ; only remember , Endymion , I have never deceived you . I can not endure any longer this state of affairs . When in a few days we part , we shall never meet again . And all the devotion of Myra will end in your destroying her . ”
189609	189627	189650	189650	he	6628	“ My own , my beloved Myra , do with me what you like . If — — ”
189645	189649	189650	189650	he	6628	“ My angel , ”
189653	189680	190271	190275	the captain of the vessel	6042	“ and you too , my dear Endymion . I have some news from England which I fear may distress you . Lord Montfort is dead . ”
190260	190269	190333	190334	Poor Endymion	425	“ He is one of our rising statesmen , ”
190301	190332	190872	190872	their	6071	“ I daresay he has a good load on his mind . Do you know , I would sooner be a captain of a ship than a minister of state ? ”
190875	190883	190911	190911	he	548	“ No immediate danger , but serious . ”
190904	190910	190911	190911	he	548	“ On no account whatever , ”
190914	190923	190997	190997	he	548	“ My orders on this head are absolute . ”
190991	190996	190997	190997	he	548	“ I perceive then , ”
191000	191013	191327	191327	Princedown	141	“ that I am going to die , because I am disobeyed . ”
191334	191339	191922	191924	the foreign minister	6108	“ All is over . ”
191909	191920	191922	191924	the foreign minister	6108	“ I called at the Foreign Office to - day , ”
191926	191935	191946	191946	Endymion	425	“ I assure you it is very pressing . ”
191936	191944	191946	191946	Endymion	425	“ I had the American with me , ”
191948	191976	191999	192000	Mr. Ormsby	680	“ and he is very lengthy . However , as to your business , I think we might talk it over here , and perhaps settle it . ”
191985	191997	192017	192018	Mr. Cassilis	681	“ I wonder what is going to happen to that gentleman , ”
192012	192015	192017	192018	Mr. Cassilis	681	“ Why ? ”
192020	192025	192039	192040	Mr. Cassilis	681	“ is anything up ? ”
192026	192033	192039	192040	Mr. Cassilis	681	“ Will he marry Lady Montfort ? ”
192034	192037	192049	192050	Mr. Ormsby	680	“ Poh ! ”
192042	192047	192049	192050	Mr. Ormsby	680	“ You may poh ! ”
192052	192060	192039	192040	Mr. Cassilis	681	“ but he was a great favourite . ”
192061	192105	192039	192040	Mr. Cassilis	681	“ Lady Montfort will never marry . She had always a poodle , and always will have . She was never so liee with Ferrars as with the Count of Ferroll , and half a dozen others . She must have a slave . ”
192106	192117	192126	192127	Mr. Cassilis	681	“ A very good mistress with thirty thousand a year . ”
192118	192124	192140	192141	Mr. Ormsby	680	“ She has not that , ”
192130	192138	192140	192141	Mr. Ormsby	680	“ What do you put Princedown at ? ”
192143	192153	192140	192141	Mr. Ormsby	680	“ That I can tell you to a T , ”
192158	192182	192197	192197	Ormsby	680	“ for it was offered to me when old Rambrooke died . You will never get twelve thousand a year out of it . ”
192183	192195	192197	192197	Ormsby	680	“ Well , I will answer for half a million consols , ”
192199	192252	192140	192141	Mr. Ormsby	680	“ for my lawyer , when he made a little investment for me the other day , saw the entry himself in the bank - books ; our names are very near , you know — M , and O. Then there is her jointure , something like ten thousand a year . ”
192253	192261	192140	192141	Mr. Ormsby	680	“ No , no ; not seven . ”
192262	192269	192197	192197	Ormsby	680	“ Well , that would do . ”
192270	192286	192298	192299	Mr. Ormsby	680	“ And what is the amount of your little investment in consols altogether , Ormsby ? ”
192287	192296	192298	192299	Mr. Ormsby	680	“ Well , I believe I top Montfort , ”
192305	192324	192336	192337	Mr. Cassilis	681	“ but then you know , I am not a swell like you ; I have no land . ”
192325	192334	192336	192337	Mr. Cassilis	681	“ Lady Montfort , thirty thousand a year , ”
192340	192379	192986	192986	she	499	“ She is only thirty . She is a woman who will set the Thames on fire , but she will never marry . Do you dine to - day , by any chance , with Sidney Wilton ? ”
192989	192997	193110	193111	the servant	1560	“ at papa ’s in Grosvenor Square , ”
193100	193108	193311	193312	Lady Montfort	499	“ Her ladyship will see you presently , ”
193316	193331	193351	193351	she	6139	“ I am weaker than I thought , but it is a great trial . ”
193362	193568	193351	193351	she	6139	“ I have a great deal of business to transact — you would not believe how much . I do not dislike it , it occupies me , it employs my mind . I have led so active a life , that solitude is rather too much for me . Among other business , I must buy a town house , and that is the most difficult of all affairs . There never was so great a city with such small houses . I shall feel the loss of Montfort House , though I never used it half so much as I wished . I want a mansion ; I should think you could help me in this . When I return to society , I mean to receive . There must be therefore good reception rooms ; if possible , more than good . And now let us talk about our friends . Tell me all about your royal sister , and this new marriage ; it rather surprised me , but I think it excellent . Ah ! you can keep a secret , but you see it is no use having a secret with me . Even in solitude everything reaches me . ”
193569	193588	193351	193351	she	6139	“ I assure you most seriously , that I can annex no meaning to what you are saying . ”
193589	193617	193351	193351	she	6139	“ Then I can hardly think it true ; and yet it came from high authority , and it was not told me as a real secret . ”
193618	193625	193351	193351	she	6139	“ A marriage , and whose ? ”
193626	193630	193638	193638	Endymion	425	“ Miss Neuchatel’s,—Adriana . ”
193631	193636	193638	193638	Endymion	425	“ And to whom ? ”
193643	193648	193351	193351	she	6139	“ To Lord Waldershare . ”
193649	193654	193351	193351	she	6139	“ To Lord Waldershare ! ”
193655	193666	193638	193638	Endymion	425	“ And has not your sister mentioned it to you ? ”
193667	193678	193690	193691	Lady Montfort	499	“ Not a word ; it can not be true . ”
193679	193688	193690	193691	Lady Montfort	499	“ I will give to you my authority , ”
193693	193770	194217	194217	she	6147	“ Though I came here in the twilight of a hired brougham , and with a veil , I was caught before I could enter the house by , of all people in the world , Mrs. Rodney . And she told me this in what she called ‘ real confidence , ’ and it was announced to her in a letter from her sister , Lady Beaumaris . They seem all delighted with the match . ”
194211	194216	194217	194217	she	6147	“ I am sorry , ”
194220	194315	194364	194364	she	6147	“ we know this . Things can not remain now as they are . You can not return the money , that would be churlish ; besides , you can not return all the advantages which it gained for you , and they must certainly be considered part of the gift , and the most precious ; and then , too , it would betray what your sister rightly called a ‘ sacred confidence . ’ And yet something must be done — you must let me think . Do not mention it again . ”
194354	194363	194364	194364	she	6147	“ There can not be a Protectionist government , ”
194367	194418	194458	194458	he	425	“ and yet that is the only parliamentary party of importance . Things will go on till some blow , and perhaps a slight one , will upset you all . And then who is to succeed ? I think some queer melange got up perhaps by Mr. Bertie Tremaine . ”
194449	194457	194472	194472	she	6147	“ Am I to write to you ? ”
194465	194471	194472	194472	she	6147	“ Of course you are , ”
194475	194486	194574	194574	she	481	“ every day , and tell me all the news . ”
194567	194573	194574	194574	she	481	“ I value it more , ”
194577	194594	194834	194835	Lord Hainault	571	“ than all my other presents together , except what dear Waldershare has given to me . ”

195192	195195	195185	195185	he	571	“ papa , ”
195210	195219	195292	195292	He	425	“ if he had nothing better to do , ”
195300	195316	195335	195335	he	425	“ Do you know , now that you are going I almost wish to die . ”
195328	195334	195341	195341	She	499	“ I am very unhappy , ”
195348	195391	195341	195341	She	499	“ I do not think our separation need be very long . Papa and all my family are coming to me in September to pay me a very long visit . I really do not see why you should not come too . ”
195399	195415	195634	195636	the eldest son	6204	“ If I might come , I think I should be the happiest of men ! ”
195660	195669	195700	195701	Lady Montfort	499	“ Ferrars was a first - rate shot . ”
195706	195785	195882	195882	she	6210	“ I must go up to London about my house . I want to go and return the same day . Do you know , I think you had better come with me ? You shall give me a luncheon in Hill Street , and we shall be back by the last train . It will be late , but we shall wake in the morning in the country , and that I always think a great thing . ”
195868	195881	195882	195882	she	6210	“ It is a dining - room , not a banqueting hall , ”
195885	195924	195984	195984	she	6210	“ which we had at Montfort House , but still it is much larger than most dining - rooms in London . But , I think this room , at least I hope you do , quite charming , ”
195978	195983	196001	196001	she	6210	“ They are empty , ”
195987	196000	196001	196001	she	6210	“ but the volumes to fill them are already collected . Yes , ”
196018	196037	196045	196045	he	6219	“ If you will deign to accept it , this is the chamber I have prepared for you . ”
196038	196043	196054	196054	she	6210	“ Dearest of women ! ”
196050	196053	196054	196054	she	6210	“ Yes , ”
196057	196068	196209	196210	Lady Montfort	499	“ help me to realise the dream of my life ; ”
196190	196207	196209	196210	Lady Montfort	499	“ Perhaps it will be the first time that your sister ever saw me with satisfaction , ”
196212	196235	196423	196423	Myra	466	“ but I think she will love me now ! I always loved her ; perhaps because she is so like you . ”
196415	196421	196423	196423	Myra	466	“ Adieu ! my Endymion , ”
196432	196469	196619	196619	he	326	“ All has happened for you beyond my hopes ; all now is safe . I might wish we were in the same land , but not if I lost my husband , whom I adore . ”
196608	196618	196619	196619	he	326	“ I do not like the state of affairs , ”
196622	196636	196655	196656	Lady Montfort	499	“ I think you will have to come back sooner than you imagine . ”
196637	196653	196658	196658	He	326	“ You are not going to be so foolish as to have an early session ? ”

197649	197653	197655	197656	Lady Montfort	499	“ Sidney Wilton , ”
197661	197799	198077	198077	Imogene	692	“ says that they are in the mud , and he for one will not go back — but he will go . I know him . He is too soft - hearted to stand an appeal from colleagues in distress . But were I you , Endymion , I would not return . I think you want a little rest , or you have got a great deal of private business to attend to , or something of that kind . Nobody notices the withdrawal of an under - secretary except those in office . There is no necessity why you should be in the mud . I will continue to receive , and do everything that is possible for our friends , but I think my husband has been an under - secretary long enough . ”
198067	198076	198077	198077	Imogene	692	“ Lady Montfort is very kind to me , ”
198081	198095	198115	198115	he	6328	“ but I do not think she now quite remembers we are cousins . ”
198108	198114	198115	198115	he	6328	“ I do not think , ”
198119	198200	199554	199555	Lady Montfort	499	“ that I shall ever get Adriana to receive . It is an organic gift , and very rare . What I mean to do is to have a first - rate villa and give the party strawberries . I always say Adriana is like Nell Gwyn , and she shall go about with a pottle . One never sees a pottle of strawberries now . I believe they went out , like all good things , with the Stuarts . ”
199539	199552	199554	199555	Lady Montfort	499	“ I did not think it would have lasted even so long , ”
199557	199629	199789	199790	Lady Montfort	499	“ but then I was acquainted with their mutual hatreds and their characteristic weaknesses . What is to happen now ? Somebody must be found of commanding private character and position , and with as little damaged a public one as in this wreck of reputations is possible . I see nobody but Sidney Wilton . Everybody likes him , and he is the only man who could bring people together . ”
199779	199787	199789	199790	Lady Montfort	499	“ It ought to last ten years , ”
199792	199963	200319	200319	he	6429	“ I see no danger except his health . I never knew a man so changed . At his time of life five years ought to make no difference in a man . I can not believe he is the person who used to give us those charming parties at Gaydene . Whatever you may say , Endymion , I feel convinced that something must have passed between your sister and him . Neither of them ever gave me a hint of such a matter , or of the possibility of its ever happening , but feminine instinct assures me that something took place . He always had the gout , and his ancestors have had the gout for a couple of centuries ; and all prime ministers have the gout . I dare say you will not escape , darling , but I hope it will never make you look as if you had just lost paradise , or , what would be worst , become the last man . ”
200312	200318	200319	200319	he	6429	“ Can you trust him ? ”
200323	200400	200987	200992	the “ Privy Council . ”	10544	“ Remember he himself has been , and still is , a member of the very secret societies whose baneful influence we are now told he will neutralise or subdue . Whatever the cabinet decides , and I fear that with this strong expression of opinion on the part of our allies we have little option left , remember I gave you my warning . I know the gentleman , and I do not trust him . ”

201818	201837	201839	201841	the old grandfather	6511	“ You used in old days never to be satisfied with what I got out of the land , ”
201851	201873	201980	201980	he	428	“ there is enough , at any rate now for the hares and rabbits , but I doubt for anybody else . ”
201969	201974	202051	202051	he	428	“ small and earlies , ”
202040	202050	202051	202051	he	428	“ The fact is , I wrote too early , ”
202055	202296	202596	202597	Lady Montfort	499	“ I blush when I read my own books , though compared with those of the brethren , they might still be looked on as classics . They say no artist can draw a camel , and I say no author ever drew a gentleman . How can they , with no opportunity of ever seeing one ? And so with a little caricature of manners , which they catch second - hand , they are obliged to have recourse to outrageous nonsense , as if polished life consisted only of bigamists , and that ladies of fashion were in the habit of paying black mail to returned convicts . However , I shall put an end to all this . I have now got the materials , or am accumulating them daily . You hint that I give myself up too much to society . You are talking of things you do not understand . A dinner party is a chapter . I catch the Cynthia of the minute , sir , at a soiree . If I only served a grateful country , I should be in the proudest position of any of its sons ; if I had been born in any country but this , I should have been decorated , and perhaps made secretary of state like Addison , who did not write as well as I do , though his style somewhat resembles mine . ”
202582	202594	203299	203300	Lady Hainault	661	“ And what is there in yours , Mr. St. Barbe ? ”
203308	203343	203737	203737	she	499	“ I have no doubt the Queen would have preferred her own room , and that we should have had a quiet dinner , as in old days , in the little Venetian parlour . ”
203741	203745	203813	203813	She	499	“ Morning Post , ”
203828	203836	203848	203848	she	499	“ Order my brougham at three o’clock . ”
203837	203847	203848	203848	she	499	“ How dear of you to come to me , ”
203851	203862	203870	203870	he	425	“ when you can not have a moment to yourself . ”
203863	203869	203870	203870	he	425	“ Well , you know , ”
203873	203932	203940	203941	the queen	8539	“ it is not like forming a government . That is an affair . I have reason to think all my colleagues will remain with me . I shall summon them for this afternoon , and if we agree , affairs will go on as before . I should like to get down to Gaydene to - night . ”
203933	203938	203940	203941	the queen	8539	“ To - night ! ”
203944	203962	203848	203848	she	499	“ We have only one day left , and I wanted you to do something for me . ”
203963	203978	203870	203870	he	425	“ It shall be done , if possible ; I need not say that . ”
203979	204033	203940	203941	the queen	8539	“ It is not difficult to do , if we have time — if we have to - morrow morning , and early . But if you go to Gaydene you will hardly return to - night , and I shall lose my chance,—and yet it is to me a business most precious . ”
204034	204044	203848	203848	she	499	“ It shall be managed ; tell me then . ”
204045	204121	204199	204199	she	8539	“ I learnt that Hill Street is not occupied at this moment . I want to visit the old house with you , before I leave England , probably for ever . I have only got the early morn to - morrow , but with a veil and your brougham , I think we might depart unobserved , before the crowd begins to assemble . Do you think you could be here at nine o’clock ? ”
204195	204198	204199	204199	she	8539	“ But , ”
204202	204333	None	None	None	None	“ it was not to see these rooms I came , though I was glad to do so , and the corridor on the second story whence I called out to you when you returned , and for ever , from Eton , and told you there was bad news . What I came for was to see our old nursery , where we lived so long together , and so fondly ! Here it is ; here we are . All I have desired , all I have dreamed , have come to pass . Darling , beloved of my soul , by all our sorrows , by all our joys , in this scene of our childhood and bygone days , let me give you my last embrace . ”
