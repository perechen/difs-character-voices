583	591	593	595	the cross one	381	" Shall we go home , Belinda ? "
598	607	609	609	Belinda	134	" Why , we have only just come ! "
749	760	761	761	she	391	" I must take some desperate step to attract attention , "
776	801	761	761	she	391	" what do you recommend ? Shall I be frightened at the big drum , and give a loud shriek , or will you ? "
802	807	761	761	she	391	" Certainly not I ! "
808	842	761	761	she	391	" I can not think what has happened to them ! they must be wrong in their heads . Are you aware that not one of them has thrown us a single bouquet ? "
843	848	850	850	Belinda	134	" Why should they ? "
852	859	850	850	Belinda	134	" we know none of them . "
860	878	880	880	Sarah	135	" Even though they do not know us , they might toss us a handful of flowers , "
883	901	880	880	Sarah	135	" I am sure we look wistful enough , and that requires no great amount of acquaintance ! "
902	913	915	915	Belinda	134	" I should think it extremely impertinent if they did ! "
922	941	850	850	Belinda	134	" For my part , them , I wish that they would begin to be impertinent at once ! "
1109	1113	1114	1114	she	134	" After all , "
1118	1145	1114	1114	she	134	" you knew , Sarah , when you were so anxious to come , that we should meet no acquaintance here except Professor Forth , and — "
1157	1175	1114	1114	she	134	" cries Sarah , with a burst of genuine ill- humour that seems sensibly to ease her . "
1196	1201	1114	1114	she	134	" Belinda smiles ironically . "
1219	1245	1247	1247	he	404	" But Sarah does not heed . Her eyes are directed to the side walk , where the brisk foot - passengers pass and repass . "
1250	1258	1247	1247	he	404	" she cries in a disgusted voice ; "
1288	1358	1279	1279	him	404	" Belinda looks as directed ; and sure enough , amid the strapping soldiers erect and tall , detects without difficulty a slovenly middle - aged figure , clerical , if you judge by its coat ; scholarly , if you decide by its spectacles . With his hands behind him , and his hat set somewhat on the back of his head , he is mooning absently along . "
1363	1386	1279	1279	him	404	" cries Sarah , half - rising from her seat , and in a tone that is almost awful from its ire . "
1413	1414	1417	1417	he	404	" "
1420	1425	1417	1417	he	404	" replies Belinda quietly , "
1441	1572	1573	1573	I	0	" As they speak , the object of their observation becomes aware of their vicinity , and turning his moony scholar 's gaze towards them , awkwardly aims at them a tiny bunch of not particularly fresh violets . It falls into his betrothed 's lap , but not long does it remain there . With an angry gesture , and before Belinda can stop her , she has tossed it out into the road ; and the Gardereiter , with his six black horses , and his confiding companion , who are just in the act of again passing , drive over it , and grind it into the dust . Thanks , however , to his near - sight the donor is saved from witnessing this humbling spectacle . "
1583	1617	1573	1573	I	0	" he says innocently , as the carriage draws up at the side - walk , exploring , as he speaks , the interior through his spectacles in search of his missing posy . "
1637	1638	1623	1623	I	0	" "
1645	1656	1623	1623	I	0	" replies Sarah , with a sort of ferocious playfulness ; "
1673	1674	1668	1668	I	0	" "
1680	1711	1677	1677	you	406	" cries Belinda hastily , trying by a rapid change of subject , and a sweet , good - natured smile , to erase the traces of this suave speech . "
1731	1732	1733	1733	I	0	" "
1740	1746	1747	1747	I	0	" replies the lover irritably . "
1760	1772	1775	1775	I	0	of"—shivering a little and buttoning his coat more tightly over his narrow chest—"that
1796	1805	1795	1795	Sarah	135	knows"—with a rather resentful glance at his fiancée — "
1814	1832	1807	1807	I	0	" But Sarah heeds him no more than she does the east wind of which he complains . "
1837	2017	2022	2022	I	0	" she is crying joyfully , as another bouquet — a real one this time — large as a Cheshire cheese , fragrant as a hot - house , choice and costly as should be young Love 's tribute , come flying into the carriage . She has stretched out both hands to grasp it ; no doubt as to its destination troubling her triumph , although to a looker - on it would have seemed as if it were aimed more at the other sister , at Belinda , who has also half - stretched out her hands , but has quickly withdrawn them , and turned with patient attention , though with something of a blank look on her face , to the Professor 's fretful sarcasms on the absurdity of an al fresco entertainment in such weather . But though he misses nothing in her civil listening , though her head is turned towards him , and quite averted from her sister , yet her ears miss no one syllable of that sister 's exuberant thanks . "
2027	2034	2035	2035	You	409	" she hears her cry coquettishly . "
2066	2072	2090	2090	you	409	" — evidently smelling it . "
2117	2305	2308	2308	you	412	" etc . ,etc . Perhaps it is that her volubility leaves no space for answers from the person she addresses . Certain it is that he is strangely silent . Is it not odd to accept gratitude so bounteous with so entire a dumbness ? In pondering on this problem , Belinda presently loses the thread of the Professor 's plaints ; awakes from her musing to find him first gazing at her with surprised offence , then gone ; then succeeded in his station at the carriage - door by some one ; some one else who has no spectacles , who does not stoop nor cower before the east wind ; some one young , in short — word of splendid compass ! He is young : not with the conventional youth loosely assigned by society to any unmarried male under eighty , but really young ; some one who three - and - twenty years ago did not exist . Who that was not young and callow would be staring at her with all his eyes , and saying aggrievedly under his breath : "
2321	2346	2347	2347	I	0	" She looks back at him : a happy , red smile warming the face that men have often blamed as chill and high . "
2352	2353	2349	2349	my	0	" "
2361	2376	2356	2356	you	413	" cries Sarah restlessly , cutting ruthlessly short a sentence of her betrothed 's . "
2393	2473	2388	2388	you	413	" Neither undeceives her . A quarter of an hour later the two girls are bowling homewards to their grand - mamma and their apartment in the Lüttichau Strasse , leaving behind them the King , the Queen , the Graf von S. in his barouche , and the brave soldiers , both blue and green . Belinda has bent her delicate head , and is laying her cheek most tenderly against the blossoms in her sister 's lap . "
2484	2494	2475	2475	me	0	" cries Sarah politely , interposing a prohibitory hand . "
2509	2528	2495	2495	You	413	" Then , seeing a quite unaccountable flash of indignation in her sister 's eyes , adds generously : "
2551	2552	2554	2554	you	0	" "
2557	2727	2554	2554	you	0	" replies Belinda ironically . But further than this her magnanimous silence does not give way . A night has passed since the Professor 's damaged violets bit the dust . It is now morning , and at the window of her bedroom in the Lüttichau Strasse , with the sash flung high ( to the deep astonishment of the German Dienstmädchen , to whom the smell of an unaired room , further flavoured with departed sausages and old beer , is as dear as to the rest of her nation ) , Belinda sits , the sun warming her hair , and the tart air freshening her face . She is looking fixedly out on the pear - tree in the garden - scrap below — the pear - tree that a week ago was pinchedly struggling into flower , that has been daily whitening ever since , and now seems to stagger under its burden of blossom - snow . Yet I doubt whether she sees it . "
2732	2749	2554	2554	you	0	" she is saying to herself , almost with awe — the awe that a great joy gives—"is
2753	2774	2554	2554	you	0	" A slight noise makes her turn her head and see the tall white door open to admit her sister . "
2779	2787	2776	2776	you	414	" says the latter , cautiously peeping . "
2794	2799	2790	2790	I	0	" replies Belinda crossly . "
2811	2855	2801	2801	I	0	" This not particularly gracious answer is , however , quite enough for Sarah , who forthwith enters , and steps friskily across the sunshiny parquet , looking as clean as a cherry , as pink and white as a May - bush . "
2865	2883	2801	2801	I	0	" she says , laughing , and drawing a chair close up to her sister 's kness ; "
2918	2919	2904	2904	I	0	" "
2929	2936	2921	2921	you	414	" replies Belinda with surly decision , "
2952	2953	2946	2946	I	0	" "
2965	2999	3001	3001	you	414	" cries the other , lifting those brows which nature , slightly abetted , perhaps , by a pair of tweezers , has drawn in the thinnest straight line across her wrinkleless forehead . "
3013	3018	3001	3001	you	414	" asks Belinda severely . "
3049	3050	3051	3051	You	0	" "
3056	3061	3051	3051	You	0	" replies Sarah composedly ; "
3069	3070	3051	3051	You	0	" "
3080	3085	3051	3051	You	0	" rejoins Belinda firmly . "
3097	3098	3087	3087	you	414	" "
3102	3116	3117	3117	You	0	" interrupts the other , casting up both eyes and hands to heaven . "
3122	3123	3117	3117	You	0	" "
3127	3141	3143	3143	you	414	" pursues Belinda , regarding her sister with an air of stern wonder , "
3168	3169	3152	3152	you	414	" "
3178	3197	3174	3174	I	0	" cries Sarah , reddening for once with genuine shame , and putting her fingers before her face . "
3221	3222	3218	3219	the others	418	" "
3228	3239	3225	3226	the others	418	" echoes Belinda , scornfully curling up her fine nose . "
3254	3255	3251	3252	the others	418	" "
3262	3282	3251	3252	the others	418	" replies Sarah impudently , though under the lash of her sister 's words even her throat has crimsoned , "
3291	3292	3293	3293	You	0	" "
3296	3301	3293	3293	You	0	" continues Belinda sternly , "
3348	3349	3350	3350	He	136	" "
3354	3361	3350	3350	He	136	" interjects Sarah hard - heartedly . "
3371	3372	3365	3365	him	136	" "
3389	3406	3407	3407	Six	138	" continues the elder sister , contemptuously passing by her junior 's lame attempt at palliation . "
3414	3415	3416	3416	I	0	" "
3440	3441	3433	3433	I	0	" "
3447	3448	3433	3433	I	0	" "
3464	3475	3477	3478	young Manners	139	First"—checking off on her long white fingers , beginning with the thumb—"first
3480	3481	3477	3478	young Manners	139	" "
3489	3490	3477	3478	young Manners	139	" "
3491	3497	3498	3499	Colonel Greene	140	Second"—travelling on to the forefinger — "
3508	3509	3504	3504	he	136	" "
3513	3515	3477	3478	young Manners	139	him!"—brazenly . "
3537	3538	3532	3532	I	0	" "
3544	3551	3542	3542	I	0	" cries Sarah , with animation . "
3569	3570	3587	3589	old Lord Blucher	141	" "
3573	3584	3587	3589	old Lord Blucher	141	" continues Belinda relentlessly , arriving at her third finger — "
3607	3625	3626	3626	I	0	" But Sarah 's light mind is still on the track of her lover 's lost initial . "
3637	3642	3626	3626	I	0	" she says thoughtfully . "
3643	3648	3649	3650	Mr. Brabazon	142	Fifth"—extending her little finger — "
3652	3653	3649	3650	Mr. Brabazon	142	" "
3659	3660	3654	3654	You	0	" "
3665	3666	3669	3669	you	0	" "
3672	3673	3669	3669	you	0	" "
3694	3697	3687	3687	we	427	First"—returning to her thumb—"poor
3701	3702	3687	3687	we	427	" "
3705	3728	3729	3729	I	0	" cries Sarah loudly , putting her fingers in her ears , and abandoning the search for the young clergyman 's name . "
3753	3840	3751	3751	yours	428	" Belinda is preparing to begin on her other hand , but at this concession she lets them both drop in her lap , and ceases counting . There is a silence . Sarah 's roving eyes are despondently fastened on the white earthenware stove , and Belinda 's large grave gaze is straying through the window , taking in at once the poetry of the blooming pear - tree and the prose of the Bohemian railway , and the ugly straight stuccoed houses beyond it . "
3851	3865	3845	3845	your	428	" she says presently , turning with a judicial air to the offender , "
3885	3886	3751	3751	yours	428	" "
3892	3908	3751	3751	yours	428	" answers Sarah , sighing profoundly , and wagging her head from side to side ; "
3923	3924	3751	3751	yours	428	" "
3936	3941	3751	3751	yours	428	" pursues Belinda relentlessly . "
3948	3978	3979	3979	you	428	" replies Sarah , abandoning her dispirited pose , and speaking with an animation which shows that she does not altogether relish this wholesale depreciation of her latest victim ; "
4028	4029	4019	4019	he	429	" "
4036	4049	4050	4050	You	0	" asks Belinda curtly , totally unmoved by this evidence of erudition . "
4059	4076	4050	4050	You	0	" cries Sarah , lifting her eyebrows , and speaking with an air of pompous astonishment . "
4081	4106	4019	4019	he	429	" breaking into a laugh , and even demeaning herself so far as to be guilty of the faintest possible shadow of a wink , "
4118	4119	4116	4116	I	0	" "
4131	4145	4128	4128	I	0	" says Belinda grimly , not much infected by her sister 's mirth . "
4154	4158	4146	4146	I	0	" still laughing . "
4171	4179	4146	4146	I	0	" rejoins the other , inexorably grave . "
4192	4201	4146	4146	I	0	" says Sarah , frowning in reluctant retrospect ; "
4289	4290	4271	4271	she	436	" "
4293	4294	4271	4271	she	436	" "
4300	4313	4271	4271	she	436	" impatiently , as if stating something too obvious to be contradicted , "
4371	4372	4359	4359	I	0	" "
4375	4376	4359	4359	I	0	" "
4396	4397	4390	4390	I	0	" "
4410	4411	4399	4399	I	0	" "
4419	4431	4432	4432	I	0	" resuming the thread of her narrative with a heavy sigh , "
4456	4457	4445	4445	You	428	" "
4465	4470	4445	4445	You	428	" replies Belinda sternly ; "
4486	4487	4451	4451	they	439	" "
4493	4496	4451	4451	they	439	" fawningly , "
4506	4507	4504	4504	you	428	" "
4519	4520	4504	4504	you	428	" "
4528	4536	4522	4522	you	428	" sidling up with a cajoling air , "
4555	4573	4546	4546	I	0	" No answer . A silence cut into only by the uncouth shriek of a departing engine . "
4583	4600	4578	4578	you	428	" asks Belinda presently , still opposing a front of granite to her sister 's blandishments . "
4611	4626	4578	4578	you	428	" replies Sarah , in a small voice , and again hanging her head ; "
4667	4681	4682	4682	I	0	" Then , with an acute change of key and access of emotion : "
4706	4735	4687	4687	he	440	" Another pause . A quick wind - whiff tosses through the window a little strom of pear - petals , and throws them on Belinda 's lap . "
4743	4767	4687	4687	he	440	" says Sarah , kneeling down at her senior 's elbow , and folding her hands with an extremely insinuating gesture of supplication , "
4774	4775	4776	4776	I	0	" "
4782	4798	4801	4801	her	0	" I do not see much to brag of in that , for my part ! "
4805	4811	4813	4813	Belinda	134	" No more do I , "
4816	4851	4813	4813	Belinda	134	" I am never in difficulties , as you call them , because I never have any temptation to be ; perhaps if I had I might ; but as you are well aware , "
4856	4870	4813	4813	Belinda	134	" I have not , and never had , any charm for men ! "
4871	4881	4883	4883	Sarah	135	" It is very odd , is not it ? "
4904	4931	4813	4813	Belinda	134	" I can not think why it is . I have often wondered what the reason could be ; sometimes I think it is your nose ! "
4932	4936	4938	4938	Belinda	134	" My nose ? "
4959	4968	4813	4813	Belinda	134	" what is the matter with my nose ? "
4969	4978	4980	4980	Sarah	135	" There is nothing the matter with it , "
4990	5034	4980	4980	Sarah	135	" perhaps it would be better for you if there were ; it is only too good ! I can not fancy any man venturing to love such a nose ; it looks too high and mighty to inspire anything short of veneration ! "
5035	5044	5046	5046	Belinda	134	" It is not so very high either ! "
5072	5075	5082	5082	her	134	" There ! "
5085	5090	5082	5082	her	134	" only that much . "
5091	5100	5102	5102	Sarah	135	" It is not a case of measurement , "
5105	5140	5102	5102	Sarah	135	" I have seen noses several hands higher that were not nearly so alarming . It is a case of feeling ; somehow yours makes them feel small . Take my word for it , "
5146	5166	5167	5167	Belinda	134	" the one thing that they never can either forgive or forget is to be made to feel small . "
5174	5212	5167	5167	Belinda	134	" It is clear , then that nothing short of amputation could make me attractive , and I am afraid even that might fail ; but I do not know why we digressed to me at all . "
5213	5220	5222	5222	Sarah	135	" I had a little plan , "
5242	5250	5224	5224	her	135	" but you have frightened it away . "
5251	5256	5167	5167	Belinda	134	" What is it ? "
5260	5266	5269	5269	her	135	" Well , you know , "
5282	5303	5269	5269	her	135	" that we are going to drive to Moritzburg to - day , you and I. Of course Professor Forth , "
5309	5346	5269	5269	her	135	" will be on duty there to meet us ; equally of course , young Rivers , who seems to have contracted a not altogether reprehensible habit of dogging our steps , will be there too , "
5347	5350	5224	5224	her	135	" Well ? "
5357	5430	5224	5224	her	135	" Well , I thought — but you are not a pleasant person to unfold one 's little schemes to — I thought that for once you might be obliging , and pair off casually with my dear , and take an opportunity of softly breathing to him that nobody — I least of all — will try to stop him if he effects a graceful retreat to Oxbridge and the Digamma ! "
5431	5436	5269	5269	her	135	" And meanwhile you ? "
5452	5457	5459	5459	Sarah	135	" And meanwhile I , "
5463	5505	5459	5459	Sarah	135	" killing two birds with one stone — keeping the coast clear , that is to say , and marking my gratitude for that haystack of gardenias — shall be straying hand - in - hand through the vernal woods with — "
5585	5614	5580	5580	her	134	" I have already told you that I utterly decline to be mixed up in your entanglements . I forbid you to mention the subject to me again . "
5615	5624	5626	5626	Sarah	135	" Whew - w - w - w ! "
5672	5683	5580	5580	her	134	" Forbid ! What an ugly word ! After all , "
5686	5728	5580	5580	her	134	" I am not much surprised that men are frightened at you . I am frightened at you myself sometimes ; and so no wonder that they shake in their shoes , and dare not call their harmless souls their own . "
5729	5741	5743	5743	Belinda	134	" How many times are you going to tell me that ? "
5751	5796	5743	5743	Belinda	134	" Do you think that it can be very pleasant to hear that I can never inspire anything but alarm and aversion ? I am as well aware of it as you can be ; but I am a little tired of hearing it . "
5797	5806	5808	5808	Sarah	135	" And you might inspire such different feelings , "
5819	5847	5808	5808	Sarah	135	" it is a pity to see advantages which would have made me famous if I had them , absolutely thrown away upon you ! I suppose , "
5852	5881	5808	5808	Sarah	135	" that it is the old story of the people with large appetites and nothing to eat , and the people with plenty to eat and no appetities . "
5970	6007	6013	6013	she	450	" If you can not behave like young gentle - women without having me always at your heels , why , all I can say , my dears , is that I am sorry for you , "
6103	6106	6108	6108	Belinda	134	" Sarah , "
6118	6166	6108	6108	Belinda	134	" if you hear a window open , mind you do not look that way . She is quite capable of bawling at us from the balcony ; and if she finds out where we are going to , she is certain to insist on coming too . "
6167	6178	6180	6180	Sarah	135	" If she gets into this carriage to - day , "
6183	6192	6180	6180	Sarah	135	" it will be over my dead body ! "
6374	6389	6390	6390	She	470	" He will not be there ! I do not at all expect him . "
6425	6432	6417	6417	they	471	" He will not be there ! "
6464	6476	6459	6459	They	454	" He will be there ! He will — he will ! "
6534	6559	6532	6532	Sarah	135	" Belinda ! She is there ! On your side . Quick ! Hold down your parasol ! Perhaps she may not see us . "
6694	6699	6672	6689	a burly , middle - aged figure gesticulating with raised arms and waved umbrella in mid - road	478	" Halt , Kutscher ! "
6711	6717	6719	6720	the girl	446	" It is no use ! "
6731	6738	6719	6720	the girl	446	" It never is any use ! "
6779	6789	6790	6790	she	480	" I was afraid you might not see me ! "
6797	6842	6790	6790	she	480	" How are you ? Where are you going to ? I thought I must just stop you for a minute , to ask where you are going to ? To Moritzburg ? How pleasant ! I wish I were going to Moritzburg too ! "
6854	6879	6790	6790	she	480	" I dare say , now , as you seem to have plenty of room , you would not mind giving me a lift . "
6880	6886	6888	6888	Belinda	134	" It would be delightful ! "
6894	6900	6888	6888	Belinda	134	" but I am afraid — "
6901	6949	6790	6790	she	480	" I do not in the least mind sitting back , if that is what you are going to say . It is all one to me how I sit . If you had travelled as much as I , it would be all one to you ! "
6950	6960	6962	6962	Sarah	135	" If Belinda had travelled as much as you , "
6965	6993	6962	6962	Sarah	135	" I am sure that her one hope and prayer would be to be allowed to stay at home for the rest of her life . Well , "
7005	7022	6962	6962	Sarah	135	" it is too unlucky ; but as we have unfortunately promised to meet some people — "
7023	7030	7032	7033	the other	2396	" Some people ! What people ? "
7036	7053	7032	7033	the other	2396	" Anyone I know , I wonder ? Professor Forth , of course , for one , "
7059	7146	7032	7033	the other	2396	" I saw him setting off this morning somewhere . I knew that it must be an excursion of some kind , because he had two overcoats ; but I could not make out where . I asked at his lodgings , but the Dienstmädchen did not know . And Rivers — young Rivers ? — are you going to meet him too ? A propos what Rivers is he ? I want to find out what Rivers he is ; I know so many Rivers . "
7147	7155	7157	7157	Sarah	135	" I will ask him at once , "
7160	7182	7157	7157	Sarah	135	" I will say to him , ' What Rivers are you ? ' Au revoir . Drive on , Kutscher . "
7183	7258	7032	7033	the other	2396	" Where are you going to - morrow ? What are you going to do to - morrow ? Will you come to Wesenstein ? I want you all to come to Wesenstein ! With a little packing we might all get into one carriage . What do you say to a long day at Wesenstein ? or , better still , Tharandt ? What do you say to a long day at Tharandt ? "
7281	7292	7294	7294	Sarah	135	" A form of thanksgiving to be used on land ! "
7441	7448	7450	7450	her	134	" My king ! my king ! "
7491	7497	7499	7499	Sarah	135	" How do you do ? "
7507	7569	7499	7499	Sarah	135	" I have a message for you from Miss Wheaton ; she wants to know what Rivers you are ! I was so afraid of forgetting that I thought I had better deliver it at once . Think it over , I advise you , against you meet her next . Bah ! he does not hear a word I say ! "
7889	7896	7897	7897	he	136	" Six marks , sixty pfennigs ! "
7918	7951	7897	7897	he	136	" one mark , sixty - five pfennigs a head ! A very high charge , I should say ; undoubtedly prices in Germany have doubled since the war ! Viermal Bifstek ! "
7955	7969	7970	7970	He	136	items—"as it turned out , zweimal would have been ample . Zweimal Kartoffeln — "
7986	7992	7993	7993	she	135	" In mercy spare us ! "
7996	8038	7993	7993	she	135	" What can be more dreadful than the recapitulation of the items of the food one has just swallowed ? It is like beginning luncheon all over again , to which , with my present feelings , death would be preferable . "
8098	8111	8113	8113	Rivers	143	" In heaven 's name stop a moment to admire this pump ! "
8122	8152	8113	8113	Rivers	143	" Nothing to admire in it?—of course there is not ! I never saw an uglier pump in my life , but it will give them a good start ! "
8153	8168	8170	8170	Belinda	134	" Are you so sure that they are anxious to get a good start ? "
8216	8224	8226	8228	the young man	504	" I am not at all sure , "
8235	8247	8226	8228	the young man	504	" What I am sure of is that I wish it . "
8248	8266	8268	8268	Belinda	134	" Do you think that her back looks as if she were being tolerably civil to him ? "
8276	8334	8268	8268	Belinda	134	" one can gather so much from a person 's back . I am afraid that the way in which she is jerking her head about does not augur very well for him . Was not she rude to him at luncheon ? he must have heard her whisper to me that he was an old skinflint . "
8335	8346	8348	8348	Rivers	143	" Perhaps they are all right when they are alone , "
8356	8361	8351	8351	Belinda	134	" I doubt it ! "
8545	8549	8550	8550	he	508	" After all , "
8563	8604	8550	8550	he	508	" I do not think that I should much mind how like a dog the woman I loved treated me in company , if she were — if she were — as I would have her when we were alone ! "
8605	8610	8612	8612	Belinda	134	" Would not you ? "
8649	8659	8640	8640	she	134	" I think I should agree with the poet : "
8679	8840	8673	8673	you	508	" The poor boy looks terribly thrown back ; and indeed what ardent young lover would not , at such a turn given to a tender speech ? And yet in her heart she had felt as tender as he , though no human being could have guessed it . Both now lean their elbows on the balustrade , and look down on the garden grass , and the stiff fir - trees cut into prim yew - shapes ; so that unless you look at them very closely you would swear that they were yews . And beyond the grass and the firs comes the ruffled blue water , which like a broad moat girds the Schloss around . The water is running to - day into little waves and ridges ; and trees just greening are verdantly bordering its brim . In the garden , beneath the fir - trees a pair of figures are seen soberly pacing . "
8845	8867	8911	8911	she	512	" cries Belinda , pointing to them , and thankful for a safe subject with which to break the strained silence ; "
8906	8907	8891	8891	she	512	" "
8916	8935	8911	8911	she	512	" says Rivers , roused to interest by fellow - feeling , and craning his neck to look ; "
8940	8944	8945	8945	I	0	" Belinda nods . "
8978	8979	8973	8973	his	508	" "
9005	9147	9148	9148	I	0	" Presently they move , and passing down the slabbed incline , and across the water into the King 's garden , tread very slowly the fine gravel of the broad walk , as sentinels on either hand of which stand heaven - high firs , that yet have been clipped out of all fir semblance , and , like their brothers round the Schloss , wear the likeness of yews , cut into such tall narrow sugar - loafs that their forest kin would disown them . Silently they step along . Perhaps the utter repose , the absence of progress and hurry , the sober stillness of all around , tells sleepily upon their young spirits . Perhaps to them speech is not so easy as it was a month ago . It is Belinda who resumes the conversation . "
9159	9166	9148	9148	I	0	" she says with a sigh . "
9174	9211	9148	9148	I	0	" asks Rivers dreamily . He has forgotten all about Professor Forth , and is lost in a sea of speculation as to whether ever woman in this world before had such a short upper lip . "
9231	9237	9217	9217	I	0	" she answers , smiling . "
9247	9276	9281	9281	she	152	" absently . The Professor is still a mist - figure to him . It is her chin now . Was there ever such a ravishing round chin ? "
9285	9286	9281	9281	she	152	" "
9289	9301	9281	9281	she	152	" awaked for a moment from his trance by shocked surprise . "
9307	9308	9281	9281	she	152	" "
9317	9323	9281	9281	she	152	" she answers , laughing ; "
9332	9333	9335	9335	you	0	" "
9337	9383	9335	9335	you	0	" The bold wind has loosened a very small strand of her hair , and is blowing it against her cheek . How many years of his life — ten ? fifteen ? twenty?—would he give to be allowed to replace it behind her ear ? "
9415	9416	9418	9418	yours	0	" "
9420	9437	9418	9418	yours	0	" that little lock is still frolicking distractingly ; ought he to tell her of it ? "
9445	9446	9418	9418	yours	0	" "
9455	9460	9447	9447	They	516	" she answers precipitately . "
9483	9484	9485	9485	You	0	" "
9491	9497	9488	9488	I	0	" he says , reddening , "
9508	9509	9499	9499	I	0	" "
9526	9597	9513	9513	I	0	" Her tone is cold and trenchant , as of one who would check a displeasing topic . In point of fact it is intense shyness — the shyness of hearing herself talked about , and talked about by him — that makes it so ; but to a listener it has all the effect of a freezing haughtiness , repressing impudent intrusion . She hears it herself with bitterness . "
9610	9624	9625	9625	You	0	" she says internally . It is clear that he hears it too . "
9629	9634	9625	9625	You	0	" he cries miserably . "
9672	9677	9666	9666	him	136	" She smiles involuntarily . "
9696	9697	9698	9698	You	0	" "
9708	9715	9698	9698	You	0	" Again she smiles more broadly . "
9748	9801	9729	9729	his	136	" As she speaks she puts up her hand and carelessly pushes back her wandering love- lock ; but one little tendril still escapes and frisks in the breeze . He thrusts his hands hard down into his pockets to resist the intense though monstrous temptation to aid her in its recapture . "
9806	9811	9803	9803	you	0	" he says hurriedly , "
9861	9862	9847	9847	you	0	" "
9872	9880	9870	9870	mine	0	" repeats she with a puzzled air . "
9893	9894	9886	9886	I	0	" "
9907	9910	9895	9895	You	0	" pursues he rapidly—"and
9947	9954	9942	9942	I	0	" At that she smiles subtilely . "
9974	9983	9963	9963	you	0	" continues the lad , with gathering agitation . "
10007	10008	9999	9999	you	0	" "
10012	10027	10030	10030	you	0	" she says , finishing his sentence for him with a rather bitter smile , "
10100	10165	10168	10168	you	0	" In the eagerness of that query she has stopped and faced him , the colour hurrying up to her cheeks , and her eyes fastened in imperative asking on his . He does not answer for a moment . He is dizzily marvelling whether blood of so wondrous a tint had ever flooded lily cheek before . She repeats her question with emphasis : "
10170	10171	10168	10168	you	0	" "
10183	10184	10172	10172	I	0	" "
10191	10203	10205	10205	I	0	" she says , in a low and rather anxious voice . "
10210	10213	10208	10208	I	0	" hesitating , "
10217	10246	10208	10208	I	0	" To this question she has honestly expected a reply in the negative , and is proportionately startled by the virile energy of the affirmative that instead follows . "
10256	10257	10259	10259	I	0	" "
10261	10272	10259	10259	I	0	" she says , in a key of genuine bewilderment . "
10286	10292	10283	10283	I	0	" He does not answer . "
10296	10325	10329	10329	I	0	" she goes on diffidently , Sarah 's dictum as to the one unforgivable sin committible by women against men flashing across her mind , sinister and appropriate — "
10335	10336	10329	10329	I	0	" "
10341	10349	10353	10353	you	0	" assents he , with pungent emphasis ; "
10382	10387	10379	10379	your	0	" She laughs grimly . "
10393	10394	10379	10379	your	0	" "
10421	10422	10410	10410	you	0	" "
10427	10428	10410	10410	you	0	" "
10440	10441	10437	10437	you	0	" "
10447	10457	10443	10443	I	0	" with an accent of sincere and puzzled curiosity . "
10474	10493	10463	10463	you	0	" ends the young man , baldly and stammering . But love is no brightener of the wits . "
10500	10511	10512	10513	An angel	527	" repeats she , justly infuriate at this stale comparison . "
10562	10774	10541	10541	I	0	" So saying , she turns her shoulder peevishly to him ; and leaving the garden , begins to walk quickly along the road by the water , as if to make up for her late loitering . He keeps pace with her , dumb in snubbed contrition , stupefied by love and , unhappily for himself , fully conscious of it ; burningly aware of the hopeless flatness of his last simile , and rendered by his situation quite incapable of redeeming it by any brighter sally . Presently they leave the water and all its rioting wavelets , and pace through the fir - wood towards the little Schloss — the big one 's quaint baby - brother . Beneath the fir - trees the blue hepaticas flower plentiful and late , and the young stitchworts open their fresh eyes to the spring . Regardless of ten - groschen penalties , Belinda leaves the road , and stoops to pick the little blossoms . Docilely following her motions , he stoops and picks too . He picks to more purpose than she , indeed ; for when , by - and - by , they straighten themselves again and compare results , his is by far the largest nosegay . "
10780	10802	10776	10776	you	533	" he says , timidly proffering them , for her tart speech has robbed him of his last barleycorn of courage ; "
10815	10842	10805	10805	I	0	" What would not he carry for her ? A newspaper parcel down St. James 's Street ; a bulging carpet - bag through Rotten Row ! "
10852	10866	10850	10850	myself	0	" she answers , stretching out her pretty , bare hand for them . "
10874	10877	10867	10867	They	534	" smiling , "
10914	10942	10911	10912	a Trojan	535	" Then , hesitating a little , she steps a pace or so nearer to him , and , half shyly holding out her own little bunch , "
10948	10956	10958	10958	you	0	" she says with a soft look . "
10960	10967	10969	10969	you	0	" gently mocking his frightened tone , "
10985	11191	10975	10975	I	0	" He makes her no answer ; he is quite unable . The tears have sprung to his eyes . He is very young , has never loved before ; and it seems to him that at that fair hand holding out its little blue bunch Heaven opens to him . There are days on which Heaven opens to us all , but to most of us next day it shuts again . Above them the pines lay their dark heads stilly together against the fair sky , that looks austere , yet not unkind . Here the loud wind is kept at bay , and whispers scarcely more noisily than they themselves are doing in their safe retreat . With what halting words of lame ecstasy he would have thanked her will never now be known . Dumbly he has received her gift , refraining , by what iron constraint put upon himself , from any least detention of those cool , pale fingers that just unintentionally touch his , and then innocently withdraw . The labouring syllables that are struggling to his lips are for ever driven thence by the sound of a high- pitched young voice calling clearly through the still wood : "
11228	11232	11225	11225	you	536	" laughing ironically . "
11246	11284	11236	11236	you	536	" Ere the end of this sentence , Sarah has frisked up to them , and , for the time , Heaven 's door shuts in their faces , and Earth 's dull portals reopen for them . "
11301	11315	11317	11317	you	536	" calls out the Professor from the distance , but nobody heeds him . "
11321	11326	11317	11317	you	536	" asks Sarah demurely . "
11334	11345	11346	11346	I	0	" Then , turning to Rivers , she adds maliciously : "
11372	11382	11370	11370	me	0	" But at that he finds his tongue again . "
11398	11421	11385	11385	you	536	" he cries tragically , lifting his right hand and holding his poor little prize high above her restless , small head . "
11433	11443	11424	11424	I	0	" repeats she in accents of the deepest incredulity . "
11459	11514	11385	11385	you	536	" As she speaks , she sinks at once upon her knees on the crushed herbage , and , joining her hands as in prayer , looks up at him , and says , in a small , childish voice , whose alluring properties she has tested on many a hard - fought field , "
11517	11568	11385	11385	you	536	" She might as well have knelt to and allured one of the solemn straight pines . He does not even avert his eyes from her , as though , if he saw her , he must yield . He looks her full in the face , and says doggedly : "
11580	11581	11584	11584	you	0	" "
11589	11611	11584	11584	you	0	" comes the Professor 's voice again , from the road , where the ten - groschen penalty still keeps him . "
11638	11649	11584	11584	you	0	" But a second time he speaks to the wind . "
11661	11693	11652	11652	I	0	" repeats Sarah , still hardly believing her own ears ; then , wisely taking the only course left open to her , with as good a grace as may be : "
11710	11740	11652	11652	I	0	" So saying she rises , apparently not at all put out of countenance , and flicks the bits of grass from the knees that had bent in vain . "
11769	11799	11800	11801	The King	358	" shouts the Professor , striking in snappishly the third time , the contumely with which his remarks have been treated beginning to tell very perceptibly upon his tone . "
11805	11830	11800	11801	The King	358	" repeats Sarah , sotto voce , descending to a degrading pun , and accompanying it with a wink that is worthy of it . "
11859	11873	11800	11801	The King	358	" raising her voice , and beginning to trip back towards her betrothed , "
11880	11909	11910	11910	Belinda	134	" She has not gone two steps , however , before she bethinks herself ; and , turning back , tucks her arm determinately under her sister 's . "
11912	11917	11910	11910	Belinda	134	" she says resolutely , "
11946	12376	12377	12377	I	0	" So saying she sweeps her off hurriedly ahead ; and Rivers , cursing fearfully , is compelled to follow with the Professor , with whom he has about as much in common as a non - reading , hard - rowing , foot - balling , cricketing undergraduate mostly has with an exceptionally stiff - backed and donnish Don . Nor is the Professor , whose contempt for undergraduates in general is not to be equalled save by his aversion , very much better pleased with the arrangement . However , it does not last long . A few minutes of brisk walking brings them to the clear space in midwood — the sandy spot railed round with palings where his Majesty of Saxony 's pigs have their daily rations dealt out to them . There the girls sit down on the wooden bench provided for the accommodation of admiring spectators . Many dark forms have already arrived , and are rooting and grubbing hither and thither . They have immensely long noses , long dark hair large dark ears ; hind - quarters that run away like hyænas , and a general air of absurdity and unpiglike pigness . Amongst them are several fierce - looking old gentlemen with their ugly lips lifted over formidable tusks , shaggy as bears , and with their long grey hair wet and shiny , as if they had been rolling in some muddy place . Every moment there is an arrival ; a fresh pig , two fresh pigs emerging from the wood and trotting hastily , with ears anxiously erect , to the rendezvous , afraid of having arrived too late . About the whole family , when united , there is a general unamiability ; a spiteful biting and nipping at each other ; a squeaking and angrily grunting ; a wrathful pursuit and hasty flight . The little piglets , tawny - coloured and striped like tiny tigers , toddle sweetly about in their artless babyhood . Irresistibly attracted by the childlike graces of one of these latter , yet smaller , more striped , weirder than its brethren , Sarah has run after it , and is now scampering in pursuit round the arena . The Professor , relieved at having found a sandy spot , is standing , stork - like , at a little distance off , poised on one leg , and cautiously seeking for traces of moisture on the sole of the other boot . Once more Rivers and Belinda are alone . "
12385	12425	12377	12377	I	0	" says the boy , with an angry smile , shaking his fist in the direction of the sportive Sarah . But apparently the latter 's ears are nearly as long as those of the objects of her chase . "
12434	12441	12428	12428	you	0	" she cries , desisting suddenly . "
12476	12487	12491	12491	you	0	" having by this time come up to them again , "
12496	12497	12491	12491	you	0	" "
12501	12528	12491	12491	you	0	" replies the young fellow stoutly , though in his heart he is a little scared at the unexpected distance to which his threat has carried . "
12534	12548	12532	12532	you	0	" looking full at her with his straightforward , handsome , angry eyes ; "
12584	12720	12721	12721	Belinda	134	" She looks back at him , coolly pondering , but does not answer . A flash of almost compassionate astonishment is darting across her mind that any man in the possession of sight , health , and vigour — any man , more especially at the most inflammable of all ages , can look at her with the unsimulated indifference , slightly coloured with dislike , that this Rivers is doing ! At once he rises in her esteem . Turning away , she walks thoughtfully back to the pigs . By - and - by , as through the long , light evening the girls bowl smoothly homewards , before the shy white stars look out , Sarah suddenly breaks the silence that , for several quiet miles , has lain upon both . "
12723	12728	12721	12721	Belinda	134	" she says abruptly ; "
12770	12973	12975	12975	you	0	" And even on these terms , poor Belinda is glad and thankful to have her nosegay again ! Upon the fair town of Dresden a new morning has opened — opened in sunshine , joy , and lusty growth . For one blossom - bunch that swung fragilely on the pear - tree yesterday , there are twenty to - day . The slow small leaves are beginning to break less timorously from their outgrown sheaths . I do not suppose that Belinda can have grown in the night ; but about her , too , this morning there is a look of expansion and spring : as if she also were uncurling her leaves and disclosing her shy buds to her sun . The two girls are sitting together in the pretty be - hyacinthed , be - china'd , Anglicised salon that looks to the street . The morning sun does not shine on that side of the house , and it makes the room dark ; but so it is , that all the blinds are drawn to the bottom ; nor does either , as would seem natural , make any attempt to pull them up again . "
12983	12999	12975	12975	you	0	" Belinda is saying in a tone of disapproving surprise . Sarah shakes her head . "
13009	13017	13018	13018	You	0	" she answers , making a face . "
13026	13027	13018	13018	You	0	" "
13030	13031	13018	13018	You	0	" "
13036	13037	13038	13038	I	0	" "
13042	13043	13038	13038	I	0	" "
13048	13049	13038	13038	I	0	" "
13054	13055	13038	13038	I	0	" "
13061	13093	13038	13038	I	0	" says Belinda , stopping in mid - row of the stocking she is knitting to look severely at her sister , and speaking with an extremely clear and decided accent , "
13117	13118	13107	13107	I	0	" "
13125	13130	13119	13119	I	0	" replies Sarah calmly . "
13152	13153	13146	13146	I	0	" "
13156	13168	13169	13169	You	0	" cries Belinda , with a shocked start , and crimsoning . "
13184	13185	13171	13182	the first person who ever dared to say that I pursued anyone	550	" "
13196	13201	13193	13193	you	0	" rejoins Sarah coolly . "
13234	13257	13213	13213	I	0	" But Belinda has stooped her angry , blonde head over her stocking , and is speechlessly knitting her resentment into it . "
13261	13281	13213	13213	I	0	" says Sarah , discourteously jerking the slumbering pug off the sofa , and throwing herself down on it , "
13315	13336	13339	13339	I	0	" She pauses for a moment , expecting to be asked for an explanation , but Belinda deigns no syllable . "
13364	13368	13358	13358	Swinburne	155	" continues Sarah , yawning—"what
13468	13469	13541	13542	young Rivers	143	" "
13473	13492	13495	13495	he	558	" says Belinda , lifting a head whose cheeks still blaze , and speaking in a withering voice , "
13512	13513	13495	13495	he	558	" "
13518	13527	13495	13495	he	558	" repeats Sarah , with a malicious look ; "
13547	13573	13541	13542	young Rivers	143	" Belinda winces . Who — high - strung and palpitating in young love 's first ecstasy — would not wince at such a phrase ? "
13578	13605	13541	13542	young Rivers	143	" says Sarah , sliding off the sofa again , assuming her cajoling voice , and sitting down on the parquet at her sister 's feet , "
13657	13658	13652	13652	he	558	" "
13664	13669	13659	13659	He	558	" replies Belinda reluctantly . "
13680	13710	13672	13672	I	0	" with a dry laugh . Belinda 's sole response to this pleasantry is to push her chair back very decidedly , and isolate her sister on the floor . "
13721	13740	13713	13713	he	558	" continues Sarah , taking no notice of this evidence of displeasure , and obstinately pursuing her catechism . "
13747	13751	13741	13741	He	558	" rather sulkily . "
13763	13769	13770	13770	He	558	" with an ironical smile . "
13780	13790	13770	13770	He	558	" very precipitately , and reddening under this fleer . "
13803	13804	13805	13805	He	558	" "
13810	13811	13807	13808	a father	563	" "
13824	13825	13826	13826	I	0	" "
13834	13837	13829	13829	he	558	" grudgingly . "
13841	13854	13829	13829	he	558	" with raised eyebrows , and an accent of surprise and dissatisfaction . "
13857	13861	13829	13829	he	558	" more cheerfully , "
13879	13880	13869	13869	you	567	" "
13885	13889	13869	13869	you	567	" very curtly . "
13896	13901	13903	13903	one	373	" says Sarah philosophically , "
13934	13944	13923	13923	you	567	" Belinda laughs a little , but most unwillingly . "
13955	13956	13951	13951	I	0	" "
13961	13965	13958	13958	you	567	" says Sarah , "
14039	14090	14091	14091	Your	567	" A pause . The pug has arisen from the cold par quet , and , with her tail still half - mast high in the enervation of slumber , has stepped delicately on to Sarah , and cast herself with a deep , slow sigh upon her warm lap . "
14106	14118	14098	14098	he	573	" says Sarah presently , with an air of thoughtful generosity ; "
14145	14210	14213	14213	you	567	" But Belinda is not attending . Belinda 's head is raised , and upon her face has come a look of blissful listening . Her fine ear has detected a footfall in the anteroom outside — a footfall that not even Slutty , the pug , has yet suspected ; a step that she has discriminated from that of the flat foot Gustel . "
14218	14348	14213	14213	you	567	" says Sarah , in a not particularly exhilarated voice , scrambling to her feet as Rivers , ushered in by an infant English page who divides the cares of the ménage with Gustel , enters . She gives him two contemptuous fingers . Of what use to give more to a man who holds them as if they were a bundle of sticks . She might have given him ten , or twenty , or none , for all he knows . His eyes have strayed away over her , to him , totally irrelevant head , and have fastened on his mistress , asking eagerly if this can indeed be she , alive and real , whom all night long he has pursued through his radiant dreams . "
14355	14364	14350	14350	you	567	" says Sarah , with an innocent look . "
14378	14411	14412	14412	Sarah	135	" He does not hear . Belinda 's hand in his is making summer in his veins , and his happy eyes are drowned in hers as happy . But Belinda hears . "
14418	14434	14412	14412	Sarah	135	" she says , low and hurriedly . He turns round reluctantly with a start . "
14453	14454	14442	14442	I	0	" "
14469	14474	14461	14461	you	567	" she answers demurely . "
14479	14485	14461	14461	you	567	" repeats he , astounded . "
14515	14536	14537	14537	We	575	" Even for his explanation he has turned again to Belinda , as inevitably as the sunflower to the sun . "
14553	14698	14551	14551	Belinda	134	" replies the other , smiling malevolently at her sister 's obvious , and to Rivers incomprehensible , discomfiture . That his Egeria could look foolish , as she is indisputably doing , would never , indeed , occur to him ; but nothing short of total blindness could prevent his seeing the sudden cascade of scarlet which has poured over her . For one instant , indeed , the blest idea has darted across his mind that this lovely flag may be hung out for him ; but his humility — for real love is ever most humble — at once dismisses the scarcely formed thought as too good to be true . Perhaps it is his scrutiny , silent and intense , that embarrasses her . Of course he ought to say something . On a morning visit one must say something . "
14707	14720	14701	14701	you	134	" he asks , glancing at the carefully drawn - down blinds . "
14742	14743	14800	14801	Miss Watson	147	" "
14753	14764	14800	14801	Miss Watson	147	" replies Belinda , who is slowly recovering her countenance ; "
14796	14797	14793	14794	Miss Watson	147	" "
14808	14809	14800	14801	Miss Watson	147	" "
14884	14885	14870	14870	she	147	" "
14891	14896	14870	14870	she	147	" said Sarah viciously , "
14905	14906	14899	14899	I	0	" "
14919	14926	14927	14930	A friend of ours	580	" says Belinda with a shrug . "
14951	14952	14933	14933	She	147	" "
14967	14972	14933	14933	She	147	" says Sarah gravely ; "
15012	15013	15000	15000	her	147	" "
15030	15050	15019	15019	you	0	" says Rivers bluntly , and colouring , as he delivers himself with untold difficulty of his simple errand ; "
15064	15065	15056	15056	I	0	" "
15069	15081	15056	15056	I	0	" cries Sarah , in a tone of anything but gratification . "
15099	15100	15056	15056	I	0	" "
15115	15125	15056	15056	I	0	" says Rivers , with a rather mortified laugh . "
15127	15136	15056	15056	I	0	you?"—the sunflower turning again greedily to its sun . "
15142	15150	15137	15137	I	0	" answers Belinda in a constrained voice . "
15159	15281	15282	15282	I	0	" This is all that she has to say about the hours that had made him sick with desire in anticipation , stammering with bliss in fruition , drunk with joy in retrospect ! He looks at her with an intense wistfulness that is almost incredulity ; but she gives him back no glance . How can she , knowing , as she does by long experience , that Sarah has eyes in the back of her head ? Sarah , who is ostensibly , and as he in the innocence of his heart believes really , entirely absorbed in making Slutty miserable , by affecting to suppose that she looks faint and holding smelling - salts to her outraged nose . "
15285	15293	15282	15282	I	0	" he says in a chapfallen voice , "
15315	15316	15313	15313	Tharandt	160	" "
15326	15334	15323	15324	Miss Watson	147	" cries Sarah , bursting out laughing . "
15377	15385	15390	15390	her	147	" suddenly stopping in mid - laugh ; "
15409	15410	15411	15411	She	147	" "
15423	15433	15411	15411	She	147	" says Belinda in a low key of consternation . "
15441	15449	15439	15439	Providence	161	" cries Sarah , resuming her merriment . "
15481	15482	15474	15474	I	0	" "
15487	15511	15512	15512	I	0	" says the young man , stepping threateningly towards her , and speaking in a tone of the most genuine alarm and exasperation , "
15515	15516	15517	15517	You	162	" "
15525	15536	15537	15537	I	0	" interrupts Sarah pertly , finishing his sentence for him . "
15554	15563	15547	15547	you	162	" For a moment they all listen silently . "
15572	15581	15564	15564	I	0	" says Belinda , drawing a long breath . "
15588	15596	15601	15602	that bison	585	" rejoins Sarah , shaking her head . "
15630	15674	15606	15606	She	585	" It is too true . While the words are yet in Sarah 's mouth , the door opens and admits the red face , the grizzled fringe , and the black and white plaid gown that they have all been apprehensively expecting . "
15678	15696	15606	15606	She	585	" cries the burly voice , as the owner enters without awaiting an answer to her question . "
15702	15703	15704	15704	We	587	" "
15709	15733	15704	15704	We	587	" replies Sarah gloomily , giving a hand ten degrees limper even than that one which she had vouch - safed to Rivers . "
15739	15740	15704	15704	We	587	" "
15757	15810	15811	15811	I	0	" interrupts the other breathlessly , unable any longer to contain the curiosity with which she has been bursting all the way up the long stone stairs . There is a moment of stupefied silence , as the conviction flashes coldly on all their minds that they have over - reached themselves . "
15821	15827	15811	15811	I	0	" continues Miss Watson inquisitively , "
15902	15903	15900	15900	he	588	" "
15917	15932	15933	15933	Grandmamma	164	" replies Sarah gravely ; and Rivers , moonstruck as he is , explodes . "
15937	15938	15933	15933	Grandmamma	164	" "
15958	15963	15940	15940	you	587	" says Sarah ironically . "
15986	16017	15978	15978	You	587	" At this side - stroke Rivers winces . Does not it apply equally to him ? But upon the object at whom it is aimed it is absolutely wasted . "
16026	16027	15978	15978	You	587	" "
16032	16033	16034	16034	I	0	" "
16036	16040	16034	16034	I	0	afraid"—her eyes wandering inquisitively round—"by
16070	16095	16034	16034	I	0	" There is a moment 's silence . What question can be easier , and yet more difficult , to answer ? At last : "
16109	16114	16115	16116	Mr. Rivers	162	" says Sarah drily . "
16123	16147	16148	16148	I	0	" Mr. Rivers obeys . The houses on the other side of the street again come into sight , and the gloom flies . "
16163	16181	16160	16161	Mr. Rivers	162	" says Miss Watson , following him to the window , and cordially extending her large hand . "
16221	16259	16219	16219	you	162	" The young man has turned , the blind - cord still in his hand , towards her . His face has grown nearly as red as hers , albeit the red is of a different quality . "
16271	16305	16219	16219	you	162	" he says , with a confused laugh , the Englishman 's difficulty in discussing himself being , in his case , intensified a hundredfold by the consciousness that Belinda is eagerly listening ; "
16312	16313	16308	16308	I	0	" "
16329	16364	16308	16308	I	0	" says Sarah flippantly ; and Rivers looks vexed . There is not one among us , however wise and good and humble , who does not detest a joke upon his own name . "
16370	16382	16365	16365	I	0	" continues Miss Watson , fixing him with her inexorable eye . "
16458	16459	16460	16460	I	0	" "
16467	16472	16460	16460	I	0	" replies Rivers bluntly . "
16483	16484	16473	16473	He	165	" "
16487	16493	16473	16473	He	165	then"—with a look of enlightenment — "
16547	16548	16549	16549	I	0	" "
16563	16587	16588	16588	I	0	" answers Rivers sulkily , his usually amiable and always beautiful boy 's face beginning to look rather dangerous under this continued baiting . "
16604	16605	16598	16598	I	0	" "
16617	16661	16610	16610	I	0	" says she , baffled . But as her eye shows no sign of releasing him , as she is evidently bent upon extracting from him a response of some kind , he has to make what shift he can to answer her . "
16674	16701	16665	16665	I	0	" he says , in a shy , fierce voice , looking out of the window as if with some vague idea of escape by it . "
16724	16781	16718	16719	my father	608	" As the back of his head is turned to the room ; and as , unlike Sarah , he has no eyes in it , perhaps she is justified in putting up one hand as a speaking - trumpet to her lips , and noiselessly mouthing through it for her sister 's benefit the syllables , "
16795	16806	16718	16719	my father	608	" At all events , this is what she does . "
16812	16837	16807	16807	She	0	" says Sarah , turning away from the window half an hour later , after a cautious reconnoitre , and drawing a long breath . "
16886	16887	16888	16888	I	0	" "
16900	16905	16890	16890	she	0	" says Belinda gravely , "
16915	16916	16951	16951	she	0	" "
16926	16930	16951	16951	she	0	" rejoins Sarah . "
16933	16941	16951	16951	she	0	" with a gay look at Rivers , "
16963	16964	16959	16959	Rivers	167	" "
16975	16980	16951	16951	she	0	" replies he drily ; "
16989	16990	16951	16951	she	0	" "
16998	17011	17037	17037	Slutty	157	" says Belinda , with a happy , shy , rallying smile ; "
17015	17016	17017	17017	I	0	" "
17029	17033	17037	17037	Slutty	157	" says Sarah . "
17089	17090	17085	17085	your	610	" "
17096	17119	17093	17093	you	0	" he asks joyously , his heart leaping wildly at that small coy smile which his dear lady has just spared him . "
17126	17127	17093	17093	you	0	" "
17133	17153	17093	17093	you	0	" replies Sarah , sitting down with Slutty in her lap , and looking him over well and thoroughly ; "
17178	17179	17174	17174	your	610	" "
17185	17211	17174	17174	your	610	" replies he , enduring her scrutiny with the most perfect sang froid , and , indeed , giving her back her cool hardy look . "
17227	17242	17224	17224	you	0	" his tone growing suddenly reverent , and his bold eyes veiled and shy . "
17251	17256	17257	17257	I	0	" she answers merrily . "
17262	17263	17264	17264	David	143	" "
17266	17271	17264	17264	David	143	" repeats Sarah scornfully . "
17280	17299	17276	17276	Goliath	173	" But Rivers , in an ecstasy of pleasure at his love 's intuition , is crying out : "
17316	17317	17311	17311	I	0	" "
17325	17333	17311	17311	I	0	" she says with a demure smile . "
17368	17398	17348	17348	you	610	" She blushes faintly as a China rose at this admission of how her thoughts and eyes had stolen away from praise and supplication to spell out his name . "
17401	17411	17399	17399	David	143	" repeats Sarah , in an extremely dubious voice . "
17414	17415	17399	17399	David	143	" "
17424	17430	17399	17399	David	143	" he adds in explanation ; "
17440	17517	17399	17399	David	143	" There is a moment 's silence . For the first and only time in her life Sarah wishes for Miss Watson back again , to ascertain , as she undoubtedly would by direct inquiry , who and what his mother 's people are . But as she herself does not feel quite equal to the task , the fact remains wrapped in as much mystery as does the nature of his father 's commercial operations . "
17523	17589	17520	17520	I	0	" says the young man , sighing heavily , and gently and reluctantly setting down Slutty ( Slutty loves him ; he has mastered the exact spot in her back which demands delicate and perennial scratching . She has forsaken Sarah to jump up on his lap , though she has in general but a poor opinion of men 's laps , as cold and hollow pretences)—"I
17609	17661	17600	17600	you	616	" He pauses , with a wistful look towards Belinda 's bent and shining head , but neither girl contradicts him : the one because she so cordially agrees with him ; the other because she so passionately dissents . He moves unwillingly to the door , but there halts again . "
17667	17672	17665	17665	Wesenstein	15	" he says desperately . "
17677	17682	17665	17665	Wesenstein	15	" cries Sarah peevishly . "
17714	17715	17716	17716	I	0	" "
17720	17733	17718	17718	you	0	" he answers bluntly , laying a significant stress upon the pronoun . "
17739	17751	17735	17735	I	0	" says she , holding up her forefinger threateningly at him , "
17765	17766	17759	17759	I	0	" "
17774	17812	17772	17772	Wesenstein	15	" returns he pertinaciously ; something about Belinda — not anything she has said certainly , for she has said nothing — but possibly the unnatural fury with which she is knitting , encouraging him to persevere . "
17816	17824	17772	17772	Wesenstein	15	" very snappishly ; ' Tharandt ! ' "
17850	17851	17844	17844	you	0	" "
17854	17858	17860	17860	I	0	" very crossly ; "
17874	17891	17844	17844	you	0	" pursues she , burying , her ill - humoured face in the sofa - cushion . "
17910	17911	17900	17900	I	0	" "
17923	17947	17913	17913	you	0	" asks Rivers snubbingly , eyeing with extreme disfavour her petulant prettiness . To him she does not appear in the least pretty . "
17956	17982	17984	17984	you	0	" replies she , raising her head , surprised and languidly titillated by his tone , which is not what she had expected in him . "
17986	17991	17984	17984	you	0	" He laughs drily . "
18011	18012	18014	18016	a large family	622	" "
18018	18022	18014	18016	a large family	622	" repeats she . "
18031	18032	18027	18029	a large family	622	" "
18047	18048	18043	18045	six of us	626	" "
18053	18058	18043	18045	six of us	626	" rejoins she promptly . "
18069	18070	18071	18071	I	0	" "
18075	18076	18071	18071	I	0	" "
18089	18103	18078	18078	you	0	" asks Belinda severely , joining in the dialogue for the first time . "
18109	18115	18106	18106	I	0	" replies the other composedly . "
18148	18256	18257	18258	Mr. Rivers	162	" So saying , she re - buries her head in the pillows ; and as she totally declines to raise it again , and as neither does Belinda add another syllable , he is at length obliged to withdraw defeated . For a moment after he has disappeared , Belinda still knits violently , her forehead puckered , a warm pink wave ebbing and flowing in her cheeks , and a sharp brush between love and pride going on in her heart . For the first time in her life pride goes to the wall . She tosses down her stocking and springs to the door . "
18260	18265	18257	18258	Mr. Rivers	162	" she calls tremblingly ; "
18269	18289	18266	18267	Mr. Rivers	162	" He must have walked very slowly , for he has only just reached the double doors of egress . "
18292	18297	18266	18267	Mr. Rivers	162	" he answers pantingly ; "
18300	18301	18257	18258	Mr. Rivers	162	" "
18306	18326	18327	18327	I	0	" she says , faltering into deep shyness again , and quivering under the fervid expectancy of his look . "
18358	18359	18368	18368	you	162	" "
18373	18391	18368	18368	you	162	" asks Sarah , whose long ears have again served her faithfully , pouncing out upon them . "
18401	18423	18399	18399	David	143	" she says reflectively , a little later , when he has gone , jubilant now , to arrange the excursion . "
18441	18681	18682	18682	I	0	" A high sun , hot and benign ; a west wind , sweet with last night 's rain ; myriads and myriads of blossomed fruit - trees ; villages that seem built of and buried in snow ; enormous bunches of pear - blossoms , that look as if the boughs must break under their weight ; the ways all white with arches of cherry - bloom ; the horses trotting over a carpet of strewn cherry- petals , as at some high wedding pomp ; and a seat opposite Belinda , who has allowed him to open her parasol for her . Is it any wonder that Rivers has forgotten that it is near three o'clock , and that , at an hour at which most people are full , he and his company are still fasting ? But they have not forgotten . For the last mile and a half he has been pelted by an ever sharper shower of anxious and peevish questions as to whether the Kutscher knows the road ; as to whether they have still a mile , two miles , half a mile to go ; as to whether he is sure that there is a Gasthof ; as to whether , lastly and desperately this , he is certain that there is such a place as Lohmen ( it is at Lohmen that they are to lunch ) at all . "
18685	18722	18723	18723	I	0	" says the Professor finally , putting on his spectacles in order to look full and murderously at him through them ( he does not often look at undergraduates , he dislikes them too much ) , "
18740	18741	18744	18744	I	0	" "
18748	19090	18744	18744	I	0	" replies Rivers in - attentively and dreamily . She has just deigned to accept a little switch from him — a flowered cherry - bough , blossomed to the end of each brown twig — and is daintily waving away the audacious summer flies with it . The Professor has five distinct good reasons for being cross , and for most people one suffices . Firstly , he did not want to come at all ; secondly , he has the threatenings of a snuffly cold , contracted in the long Moritzburg grass and among the Moritzburg pigs , and probably to be sensibly worsened by the present pleasure trip ; thirdly , he hates sitting with his back to the horses — a thing which his votaries indeed seldom suffer him to do — but in this case there has been no suggestion of offering him a front seat ; fourthly , his digestion has been for so many years his master , that it now allows him with impunity no least derangement of his meal- times ; fifthly and lastly , Sarah has three times flagrantly pretended not to hear him when he addressed her , and has once crabbedly asked him to let her have a little more room . For Sarah is , if possible , still crosser than he . The low , trivial words that the sweet wind carries not to her , but alongside of her ; the ardent iron - grey eyes that she is always accidentally meeting , and that instantly lose their ardour the moment they encounter hers ; the dust , for , despite last night 's rain , there is dust ; the sense of physical emptiness , that no tickled vanity , no warmed passions redeem , have wrought her by the time they at length alight at the door of a simple but not untempting - looking Gasthof to such a pitch of ill - humour as makes her betrothed 's mild fractiousness pale beside it . "
19096	19136	19093	19093	they	631	" says Rivers , having for the first time realised this long sufficiently patent fact , and looking after them with sunny wonder , as the Professor hastens into the inn to order luncheon , eagerly followed by Sarah . "
19141	19217	19218	19218	I	0	" adds Belinda . And having thus calmly characterised their companions ' vices , they stray away together down the little garden path , where the bloody warriors and the cat - faced pansies merrily grow in the sandy border , and forget them . They have not , however , been long left to watch the happy butterflies hover , and the young flowers blow , before a captious voice overtakes and recalls them . "
19221	19251	19258	19258	you	162	" cries the Professor from the open Gasthof door , and in a voice whose exasperation is sensibly sharpened even since it was last heard in querulous inquiry five minutes ago—"I
19274	19275	19258	19258	you	162	" "
19281	19319	19320	19320	I	0	" answers the young man absently . He has just thieved a sweetbriar spray , young and vernal , and is making it fit for his love 's tender hand by carefully nipping off all its thorns . "
19323	19328	19320	19320	I	0	" pursues the voice , "
19354	19355	19320	19320	I	0	" "
19362	19367	19320	19320	I	0	" replies Rivers serenely . "
19370	19392	19395	19395	he	635	" pointing joyously out to his companion a poised butterfly opening and shutting its freaky wings on a dark pansy face ; "
19410	19411	19399	19399	He	635	" "
19415	19427	19399	19399	He	635	" continues the voice , in an intenser key of resentment , "
19441	19442	19399	19399	He	635	" "
19446	19461	19462	19462	you	162	" repeats Rivers , rousing himself with an effort into a simulation of interest ; "
19472	19479	19399	19399	He	635	" lapsing into unavoidable radiance again , "
19495	19500	19492	19492	I	0	" looking sunnily round , "
19507	19709	19716	19716	them	638	" There is a sulky silence , broken only by Belinda 's murmuring that she loves it , and by the Professor 's remarking that all white meats are more or less indigestible . Whether they like it or not , however , further inquiry only serves to confirm the fact that they must either resign themselves to a luncheon of kalbfleisch and bread ( calf - flesh being the one universally procurable flesh in Germany ) or not lunch at all . Nor , when this is settled , does the calf - flesh seem in any hurry to appear . By - and - by , indeed , a leisurely Blowsabella of a serving - maid lays a coarse clean cloth and some knives and forks in what she calls the bavillon , a homely arbour at the garden end ; and thither the Professor at once repairs , and seating himself at his place before the empty table , lays his watch before him , and seems to derive a bitter solace from counting the numerous moments as they pass , and announcing them by five at a time aloud to Rivers . But Rivers does not hear . "
19718	19741	19716	19716	them	638	" he says in a cajoling , low voice to Belinda , wiling her away again into the sun and the flowers ; "
19753	19754	19716	19716	them	638	" "
19775	19783	19768	19768	you	639	" she answers , a little drily . "
19788	19818	19785	19785	you	639	" he cries , roused into sudden , tardy compunction . The Professor 's and Sarah 's pangs had left him cold as a stone , merciless as Herod . "
19821	19914	19785	19785	you	639	" replies she ; but she says it with such a charming smile of absolute well - being , making mirthful her grave lips , that his misgivings fly . For all they care , the kalbfleisch may be an hour , two hours , three in coming ! It has been smoking for a couple of minutes , indeed , on the table , and the Professor and Sarah have been seen greedily to help themselves before they think it worth while to draw nigh . When at length they do : "
19919	19957	19785	19785	you	639	" says the Professor , laying down his knife and fork with a shocking calmness , and regarding Rivers , as he approaches in his infuriating , senseless radiance , with a glassy look of vengeful despair . "
19960	19977	19785	19785	you	639	" cries the young man , hastily helping himself , and boldly taking a good mouthful . "
19980	19984	19785	19785	you	639	" changing countenance ; "
19994	20091	20092	20092	I	0	" Nor is this expression , albeit strong , at all too strong to qualify the plat now set before these hungry persons . In the first place it is but too clear that the kalb has originally died a natural death , and has afterwards , perhaps in order to disguise this slight accident , undergone every possible variation of baking , boiling , roasting , stewing , frying , seething ! But , after all , it is not disguised . There is a blank , sulphurous silence . They all look at Rivers . "
20095	20107	20109	20109	you	0	" says the Professor , in a cutting , small voice , "
20115	20116	20109	20109	you	0	" "
20128	20140	20122	20122	he	641	" cries Sarah , in a fury , rudely interrupting him . "
20177	20191	20157	20157	you	0	" Another murderous silence , broken this time by Belinda diffidently syllabling the word "
20194	20195	20157	20157	you	0	" "
20201	20225	20157	20157	you	0	" cries Rivers , snatching at the happy suggestion , and darting a look of enamoured gratitude at her who has made it . "
20249	20292	20295	20295	they	644	" This last clause is a poor little sop thrown to the Professor 's ireful maw . In a moment he has fled swift as any scudding rabbit to the house , and in two seconds more is back again , beaming . "
20315	20331	20332	20332	I	0	" But the three minutes pass , and three more , and three more again . "
20335	20356	20332	20332	I	0	" says Sarah , addressing herself in a tone of the most intense and poignant crossness to the young man , "
20387	20535	20381	20381	You	641	" Even as she speaks , the Dienstmädchen comes into sight , sauntering deliberately down the path ; having by her want of sympathy with their sufferings clearly amply dined herself , and with a plate upon which many eggs are drunkenly rolling about together in her hand . At this simple sight the Professor smiles faintly , and even Sarah 's sulky brow grows smooth . But , alas ! too soon do they exult ! It takes but one glance to show that no new - laid eggs are these , milky and warm , over which the triumphant hens have but just ceased chuckling . Elderly , nay , veteran eggs are these , as their dirty , mottled hue but too plainly testifies . The only wonder is how a single family can have become possessed of so many addled eggs at once . "
20546	20577	20536	20536	You	641	" says Rivers , laughing nervously , and with an ill - timed attempt at a joke , as the Professor cautiously cracks one , his fellows looking breathlessly on ; "
20587	20598	20600	20600	Rivers	162	" Nobody smiles . I have cut my own throat , "
20866	20871	20879	20879	Belinda	134	" How much dust ! "
20873	20878	20879	20879	Belinda	134	" How many flies ! "
20899	20908	20910	20910	Rivers	162	" They might have got over the veal ! "
20937	20940	20942	20942	Belinda	134	" Never ! "
20947	20960	20962	20964	the young man	504	" But it was these that gave them the coup de grâce ! "
20987	21000	20962	20964	the young man	504	" I suppose they will never make an excursion with us again ? "
21001	21004	21006	21006	Belinda	134	" Never ! "
21013	21027	21006	21006	Belinda	134	" I am sure that I would not , if I were they . "
21028	21033	21035	21035	Rivers	162	" Then next time , "
21042	21051	21035	21035	Rivers	162	" we shall have to go by ourselves . "
21228	21232	21233	21233	she	134	" How likely ! "
21255	21265	21266	21266	he	162	" You would not like it , of course ? "
21365	21371	21372	21372	she	134	" I never waste time , "
21376	21395	21372	21372	she	134	" in speculating as to whether I should like or dislike what is absolutely out of the question . "
21558	21565	21567	21569	the young man	504	" What an iceberg you are ! "
21581	21585	21586	21586	she	134	" An iceberg ? "
21611	21624	21586	21586	she	134	" Yes ; so I have often been told . I think , "
21630	21642	21656	21656	his	162	" that I am a little tired of being told it . "
21643	21651	21653	21653	Rivers	162	" Are you tired of being it ? "
22019	22029	22030	22030	she	134	" It would be a pity to disturb them , "
22035	22040	22030	22030	she	134	" A thousand pities ! "
22045	22052	22030	22030	she	134	" Would not it be better , "
22063	22072	22073	22073	She	134	" for us to go out of earshot ? "
22085	22097	22098	22098	she	134	" Should you think that there was a nice path beyond ? "
22219	22223	22224	22224	he	2365	" I hope , "
22230	22264	22224	22224	he	2365	recollection—"I hope , for his own sake , that Professor Forth will awake first . If Miss Churchill sees him as we have just done I would not give much for his chance ! "
22265	22279	22281	22281	Belinda	134	" And I would not give much for it , whichever wakes first ! "
22353	22370	22330	22330	she	134	" I should like to explain something to you , if you will attend to me . "
22436	22446	22447	22447	he	2365	" Do I usually not attend when you speak ? "
22544	22548	22550	22550	Belinda	134	" I know , "
22567	22589	22597	22597	she	134	shy—"I am conscious that I have taken things you have said to me — little harmless , unmeaning , civil things , "
22608	22614	22536	22536	Sarah	135	them—"very awkwardly ! very surlily ! "
22615	22619	22620	22620	he	2365	" Have you ? "
22624	22647	22620	22620	he	2365	" I do not think you have taken them at all ! I think you have thrown them back in my face ! "
22648	22652	22653	22653	she	134	" I know , "
22657	22673	22653	22653	she	134	" that is what I wanted to explain to you . In point of fact , "
22688	22696	22684	22684	her	134	" I am not used to them ! "
22697	22704	22706	22706	he	2365	" Not used to civil speeches ? "
22768	22778	22765	22765	her	134	" No ; I am not . I suppose , "
22788	22807	22765	22765	her	134	" that it is an unusual case ; I think it must be owing to my forbidding manner ! "
22808	22823	22825	22825	he	2365	" Then why , in Heaven 's name , have you a forbidding manner ? "
22905	22913	22915	22915	she	134	" Why have I a short nose ? "
22924	22944	22915	22915	she	134	" you might just as well ask me that ! It is a misfortune with which I was born . "
22993	23002	23003	23003	she	134	" It is a bonâ - fide misfortune , "
23011	23043	23003	23003	she	134	" I have no wish to be forbidding . I think in my heart I am quite as anxious to please as anyone else can be . I will even own , "
23051	23075	23078	23078	her	134	" that I should like whenever I entered a room to hear a buzz of admiration run round it ! No , no ! "
23089	23114	23078	23078	her	134	" do not try to say that I might now ; if you do , I shall go back to the mill at once ! "
23115	23123	23125	23125	he	2365	" It would hardly be worth while , "
23128	23172	23125	23125	he	2365	" you might put up with my clumsy compliments this once — by - the - bye , as it happens , I was not thinking of paying you one then — since it is , as you say , the last time ! "
23205	23214	23215	23215	she	134	" Perhaps it may not be the last , "
23219	23260	23215	23215	she	134	" we have always one resource left ; we can ask Miss Watson to chaperon us . I never knew her refuse to go anywhere , at any time , with anybody , and she never has any previous engagement . "
23271	23279	23261	23261	He	2365	" She would be better than nothing . "
23280	23288	23290	23290	Belinda	134	" She would be able , too , "
23316	23362	23261	23261	He	2365	thoughts—"she would be able , too , to repair any omission she may have made in the catechism she put you through the other day . She might ask you a few more home questions as to your ancestors and your social standing , etc . "
23363	23372	23374	23375	the boy	2509	" I am sure she is very welcome , "
23378	23423	23374	23375	the boy	2509	" the only thing that I am afraid of , for her sake , is that she has already pumped me nearly drys ! I think I have told her everything . What did I tell her — that I have just left Oxbridge ? "
23429	23471	23424	23424	Belinda	134	" No , you did not tell her that ; because if you had she would certainly have asked you at once if you had not been ploughed , or if you were quite sure that you had not been expelled ! "
23472	23479	23481	23481	he	684	" That we live in Yorkshire ? "
23493	23509	23481	23481	he	684	" that there are six of us ? and that my father is an ironmaster ? "
23510	23514	23516	23516	Belinda	134	" An ironmaster ! "
23534	23551	23560	23560	her	134	" No ; you certainly did not tell her that ; an ironmaster , is he ? "
23571	23574	23575	23575	he	162	" Yes , "
23578	23591	23575	23575	he	162	" an ironmaster . Why , what did you think he was ? "
23669	23688	23659	23659	she	134	" Oh , I — I — of course I did not know ! I had no idea ! "
23689	23701	23703	23703	Rivers	162	" It is to be hoped , for her own sake , "
23717	23747	23706	23706	himself	162	" that she will not get me upon the subject of my father , for it is a theme upon which I am apt to be long - winded . "
23748	23752	23753	23753	she	134	" Is it ? "
23786	23803	23805	23807	the young man	504	" I know that one cuts but a poor figure swaggering about one 's own belongings , "
23828	23845	23825	23825	his	504	" but if ever a man deserved to be looked up to , my father does ! "
23846	23850	23825	23825	his	504	" Does he ? "
23856	23873	23874	23874	Her	134	" If ever a man made a plucky uphill fight of it , it was he ! "
23896	23909	23890	23890	he	504	" To begin with , he started in life without a penny ! "
23949	23961	23963	23963	Rivers	162	" My grandfather had got through most of his money racing , "
24030	24117	24118	24118	He	696	" And so father had nothing in the world but his younger son 's share of my grandmother 's fortune to look to ; but he gave that up at once to the others , and faced the world without a stiver ! You may think whether he had to put his shoulder to the wheel ! For years he worked like a — like a navvy . Poor dear old boy ! when I think of what his youth was , and what mine is ! "
24150	24154	24156	24156	Rivers	162	" And now , "
24160	24191	24156	24156	Rivers	162	" now that we hoped he had got into smooth water , and might take breath and enjoy his life a little , comes this depression in iron ; but , "
24217	24231	24212	24212	his	696	" I do not know why I should bother you with all this ! "
24232	24242	24243	24243	she	134	" I do not know why you should not , "
24304	24308	24309	24309	he	696	" I hope , "
24337	24340	24309	24309	he	696	courage—"I hope , "
24344	24354	24309	24309	he	696	" that some day you will know my father . "
24355	24359	24360	24360	she	134	" Do you ? "
24529	24534	24535	24535	he	696	" I should like , "
24563	24577	24553	24553	his	696	before—"I should like you , of course , to know all my people . "
24578	24582	24583	24583	she	134	" Should you ? "
24617	24627	24644	24644	his	696	" I am afraid it is not very likely ! "
24735	24741	24742	24742	she	134	" Have you many sisters ? "
24746	24749	24750	24750	he	696	" Two , "
24759	24762	24750	24750	he	696	" but , "
24768	24782	24750	24750	he	696	" I have inflicted enough of my family upon you for one day . "
24848	24854	24856	24856	Belinda	134	" It must be late , "
24874	24882	24859	24859	her	134	" had we better be going back ? "
24955	24959	24964	24964	You	696	" says Sarah ; "
25014	25167	24964	24964	You	696	" It is near noon , and the sisters are walking in the Grosse Garten , that green and ample pleasure - ground , with its tall trees and its intersecting drives , of the Dresden burghers . Against a peevish sky the Museum of Antiquities lifts its greenish roof ; in its pool , with the little swan - house in the middle , there is beginning to come a vernal glow from the reflections of the young - leaved horse - chestnuts standing round ; in the flower - beds the pansies and cinerarias bloom purple and yellow . Belinda 's only answer to her sister 's self- gratulations is to stoop and console Slutty , who has returned in some disorder from a slight excursion , having been coarsely hustled away by the shabby surly Polizei , who guard and pompously warn off profane dogs from the meagre blossoms . "
25175	25195	24964	24964	You	696	" continues Sarah , thoughtfully eyeing one of the long vistas of trees that gradually lessens away to nothing , "
25250	25269	25239	25239	I	0	" looking up at an oak that , still wintrily brown , rises from the tenderly greening undergrowth . "
25279	25280	25272	25272	you	0	" "
25289	25308	25286	25286	you	0	" answers Belinda , with an awkward attempt at gaiety , for this morning she is not gay ; "
25314	25315	25286	25286	you	0	" "
25322	25327	25318	25318	you	0	" replies Sarah calmly ; "
25366	25367	25359	25359	I	0	" "
25372	25387	25410	25410	He	710	" cries Belinda , whom this chance cut has stung more deeply than it was intended—"at
25413	25417	25410	25410	He	710	" laughing unwillingly , "
25442	25443	25410	25410	He	710	" "
25452	25466	25445	25445	you	0	" cries Sarah in a delighted voice , and with a radiant smile . "
25469	25474	25447	25447	he	710	" shaking her head ; "
25485	25491	25479	25479	My	0	" with a candid air ; "
25502	25503	25506	25506	you	0	" "
25508	25509	25506	25506	you	0	" "
25517	25520	25512	25512	I	0	" drily . "
25546	25640	25512	25512	I	0	" A pause . A solitary rider is cantering along the drive . A blue Gardereiter is practising his four - in - hand team of chestnuts in a sort of phaeton , up and down , up and down . The girls have reached a spot where there is a little quiet peep among the trees ; a plot of lush green grass , vividly green , backed by sedate high firs , across which a few young birches are throwing their infinitely delicate leafage , and stretching their shining white stems . "
25648	25663	25645	25646	a mother	711	" says Sarah presently , her eyes following the diminishing Gardereiter and his team . "
25671	25672	25645	25646	a mother	711	" "
25692	25712	25713	25713	She	711	" She stops to laugh , and then goes on , letting fall each little sentence with deliberate serenity . "
25749	25750	25724	25724	she	711	" "
25779	25784	25760	25760	you	0	" asks Belinda drily . "
25793	25798	25760	25760	you	0	" answers Sarah modestly . "
25816	25821	25822	25822	I	0	" with a shrug , "
25869	25878	25822	25822	I	0	fourth,"reflectively checking off the numbers on her fingers ; "
25900	25901	25822	25822	I	0	" "
25908	25935	25822	25822	I	0	" repeats Belinda , stopping short and paling , while an expression of something very like terror looks out of the pupils of her dismayed eyes . "
25942	25948	25951	25951	granny	156	" assents Sarah , nodding . "
25983	26004	25951	25951	granny	156	" laying her hand on her sister 's shoulder , and giving her a shrewd , good - natured glance , "
26025	26040	25953	25953	Gustel	158	" Belinda 's answer is a gesture of disgust . She walks quickly on . "
26049	26063	26046	26046	I	0	" continues the other , briskly following , and keeping up with her ; "
26073	26545	26546	26546	I	0	" And so it may be ; but as it is addressed to a person who is utterly incapable of making use of it , it is , like most other advice , wasted . To hurry the pace a little ! For days and days afterwards the vile phrase recurs to her , dinning in her ears . As often — and that is not seldom — as the terror which had seized her in the Grosse Garten returns , so often does the brutal consolation with which her sister had tried to allay it . And as the priceless days slip by — slip away out of the fingers stretched forth in such a fever to detain them — it takes in her ears a horrible inflection of irony . Over and over and over again it keeps saying itself to her , as she lies awake at night , hour after hour — she can lie awake with the best of them now — hearing the engines screech and the trains thunder along the Bohmischer Bahn ; watching the now withering blossoms drop from the pear - tree in the keen moonlight , and reckoning over to herself , until her brain grows dull and tardy sleep releases her , the small and diminishing hoard of precious hours during which there will be any object in living . For that what makes the essence of these days may not pass , may last on through a long transfigured lifetime , is a hope too glorious for her to dare lift her wet and dazzled eyes to its face . And meanwhile the days themselves are passing ! Oh , how they are passing ! To hurry the pace ! How can she hurry the pace ? she asks herself desperately , in the watches of the night , unconsciously accepting the detestable phrase . What can she , being she , do ? How can she , tied down by her nature , by her stiff - necked virgin pride , by the very force of her dumb , pent passion , put out a finger to help herself ? As easily can she make the grey irises of her eyes coal - black . Is it her fault that all strong emotion with her translates itself into a cold , hard voice , and a chill set face ? With other women it translates itself into dimples and pink blushes and lowered eyes . Ah ! but do they feel as she does ? Sarah , for instance . When do men ever leave Sarah 's company with the down - faced , baffled , white look with which Rivers has more than once quitted hers ? Preening themselves rather ; with sleeked feathers and cosseted vanity . "
26562	26620	26546	26546	I	0	" she says , thinking with an envious humility of her sister 's graces , and staring blankly at the stove , beginning to glimmer white in the dawn . But for such a radical fault of nature and constitution what remedy can there be ? Tamely to copy her sister 's airy charms and light coquetries ? "
26632	27769	26546	26546	I	0	" she cries bitterly . And yet , despite all their mischances , and their agues , and their desperations , what superb days these are ! Few ? Yes , perhaps . But when one reflects how much acute happiness may be packed into five minutes , and how many five minutes there are in a month , these two may be accounted to have been largely dowered , seeing that to many a one , not held to be specially spited by fortune , it is not given in all his or her lifetime to attain to one such day . Days when round each corner lurks a splendid possibility ; days when each ring at the bell may mean that Heaven has opened . Very often it means nothing of the kind ; it means Miss Watson , or Gustel , or a parcel , but it may . In later life you may be as fortunate as you please ; a laurel garland round your head , a colossal balance at Coutts ' , a chaste , fond wife and paragon children , but Heaven can no longer pounce upon you from round the street corner . Yes , superb days ! though on one or two of them the east wind blew piercingly , sweeping across the wide plain ; and on another one or two the rain slid down from the heavy clouds , and blurred the windows . But if it blurred the windows , did it not thereby make the task of Miss Watson 's spyglass a more difficult one ? and could the wind reach them in the little pinewood behind the bleak Barracks , where they walked safe and warm on strewn fir needles , and listened to its harmless scolding far above their happy heads . How often they meet ! how perpetually , how always ! In the Alt Markt , buying jonquils of the ugly German Fraus , as they sit under their great cotton umbrellas , queening it over their carrots and radishes ; with the old houses , all different heights and shapes , russet - red roofed , endlessly dormer - windowed , standing round ; at Plauen under the cool cherry orchards ; at Meissen , in the hot Fabrik ; in the NeuStadt , in the Alt - Stadt — everywhere . If , in after years , they revisit the bright city , what spot in all its precincts will be empty and innocent of associations to them ? Superb days ! But they are going . Racing - pace they gallop by . How will it be when they are gone ? As the time passes , she grows ever less and less in a condition to face this problem . By - and - by she refuses to face it at all . When it comes it comes ; but till then let her not be defrauded of her birthright . Let her too , like the Mayflies and the Painted Ladies , have her span of careless , giddy bliss . Whenever the conversation turns upon their departure , their journey , their arrival in London , upon anything that lies beyond the horizon of the now and the here , if it be possible , she leaves the room ; if it be not possible , she feverishly seeks to divert the talk into other channels . But if she can fight thought off pretty well in the day , the variegated , distracting , kaleidoscope day , it indemnifies itself at night . At night there it is , and nothing but it ; no flickering leaves , or scudding clouds , or passers - by ; nothing but it : an image drawn on night 's plain black canvas with a hard , cutting clearness , as of an acid biting into steel ; so that she must look at it . As for her , at this time she would be thankful that there were no night at all . She does not need its refreshment . Without it her every power seems strung up to the highest pitch of efficiency , and she dreads , oh how she dreads its solitude and silence ! In the daytime , however unconventionally early or improbably late may be the hour , there is always a possibility , nay , a likelihood , of seeing his strapping figure and his burning eyes following the infant stolidity of the page , Tommy , into the salon . But in the night this is impossible . The night , therefore , is time absolutely wasted ; now , too , when there is so little time left to waste . Of what use is it but for lying broad awake in , counting up how many hours the different moments , half - hours , of their meetings make ? To her , just so much of life is worth reckoning as life at all ; the rest is unimportant padding . And he ? As to him , the pavement of the quiet Lüttichau Strasse before her door is worn hollow by his footsteps ; his eyes devour her ; his tongue stutters in lame speech to her , and altogether omits to answer when addressed by anyone else . He has abandoned all other occupations in life but that of dogging her . But he has not asked her to be his wife . To how much more purpose would be that one short practical question than all his resultless , love - sick manoeuvres ; than all the enormous nosegays with which her room is over - filled and over - scented — for she can not bear to throw away even the dead ones . Perhaps this thought crosses her mind now and again . It certainly does Sarah 's . It not only crosses it , but finds not unfrequent egress through her lips . And meanwhile May is three - parts over . The 24th of that month is reached , and , indeed , is almost ended ; for dinner is past , and the girls and their grandmother are loitering over their light and leisurely dessert . Their grandmother is an old lady with a bright eye — strangely bright , considering that it has wept , or been supposed to weep , for a good - natured husband , five promising sons , and three dutiful daughters — with a skin that it is still no penance and that , if tradition lies not , it was once considered a high treat to kiss , and with a cap whose secret will die with her . "
27777	27785	26546	26546	I	0	" Sarah is wo nt to say ; "
27893	28007	28008	28008	Granny	156	" At the present moment her attention is absorbed in the effort , aided by a cracknel , to induce her new pug Punch to give three cheers for the Queen , with the thorough mastery over which elegant accomplishment he has arrived credited . On the present occasion , however , this talent seems inclined to hang fire , for , though in general a remarkably free barker , he is now , relatively to his sovereign , either disloyally silent , or irrationally incoherent . He will give ten cheers , or one and a half , or five muffled ones and a sneeze , but he will not give three . "
28010	28050	28053	28053	you	156	" says Sarah , desisting from a vain effort to make Slutty cheer too , an endeavour which the latter frustrates by instantly rolling over on her back , and remaining in that position until all attempt at education is suspended—"granny
28074	28075	28053	28053	you	156	" "
28095	28096	28085	28085	you	156	" "
28100	28115	28085	28085	you	156	" says Sarah , regarding her grandmother with an air of cool dispassionate speculation , "
28179	28196	28198	28198	you	156	" The old lady laughs pleasantly , as if her granddaughter had paid her a compliment . "
28207	28212	28198	28198	you	156	" asks she gaily ; "
28232	28233	28223	28223	Nobody	2422	" "
28237	28243	28223	28223	Nobody	2422	" cries Sarah , delighted . "
28303	28304	28295	28295	he	731	" "
28317	28324	28313	28313	you	721	" replies Mrs. Churchill with energy ; "
28330	28331	28313	28313	you	721	" "
28337	28365	28366	28366	Wesenstein	15	" says Sarah , with a dry look . At this last speech , Belinda , who has been growing ever hotter and more restless since the word "
28367	28553	28366	28366	Wesenstein	15	" was mentioned , suddenly leaves her seat under the pretext of comforting Slutty . Slutty hates Punch and his tricks , and the kudos that attends them , and has now squeezed herself under a piece of furniture to which , in general , only Miss Watson 's voice has power to banish her , and from beneath which there is now nothing visible of her but a small spiteful face , full of mortification and ire . As she firmly resists all Belinda 's blandishing inducements to her to come forth , though the agitated beat of her tail upon the floor proves that she is not wholly unmoved by them , the young girl desist , and passes into the neighbouring salon , where , as there is no one to comment on her actions , she at once walks rapidly to the window , and looks eagerly down the dull and empty street . Not for long , however . Ere many moments have passed , a hand is laid on her shoulder ; a rallying voice sounds in her ear : "
28580	28596	28564	28564	He	733	" Belinda gives a great start , and angrily shakes off her sister 's touch . "
28606	28622	28644	28644	he	733	" she says testily , in intense vexation at having been surprised on the watch ; "
28630	28631	28623	28623	he	733	" "
28637	28642	28623	28623	he	733	" replies Sarah calmly . "
28682	28687	28670	28670	he	733	" in candid parenthesis , "
28746	28785	28744	28744	you	735	" For a moment Belinda is silent . Perhaps she has put that question to her own heart before now , and been as unable as now to give a satisfactory answer to it . Instead of replying , "
28793	28808	28744	28744	you	735	" she says irritably , bringing her hands sharply together in a wrathful clasp , "
28831	28832	28835	28835	your	735	" "
28839	28848	28835	28835	your	735	" repeats Sarah , with a shrewd look . "
28890	28917	28918	28918	I	0	" The other 's hands unclasp , her arms drop limply to her sides ; a sudden cold pallor chases the fierce vermilion from her cheeks . "
28921	28926	28918	28918	I	0	" she says slowly , "
28947	28954	28944	28944	I	0	" her voice breaking a little , "

28982	28986	28978	28978	I	0	" interrupts Sarah , "
29056	29082	29083	29083	Belinda	134	" breaking into a laugh , I know that my Schatz was not , though he is in correspondence with half the savants of Germany . "
29145	29152	29154	29154	Sarah	135	" We do not blame him , "
29161	29214	29154	29154	Sarah	135	" in fairness , I must say that we do not blame him . He is always trying to pour out his poor little tale like water out of a jug ; and you , for reasons best known to yourself , are always corking it back again . Mark my words , "
29241	29250	29154	29154	Sarah	135	" you will do it once too often ! "
29251	29260	29262	29263	poor Belinda	134	" What shall I do once too often ? "
29275	29293	29262	29263	poor Belinda	134	" What do I do ? If you could only explain that to me ! I believe , "
29298	29318	29262	29263	poor Belinda	134	" that you mean well ; I would — would try to take any hints you could give me . "
29319	29338	29340	29340	Sarah	135	" I have always told you that your high and mighty airs would be the death of you , "
29351	29387	29340	29340	Sarah	135	" If you could make them up into a parcel and toss them into the Elbe , and perhaps throw in your high nose too , you would be a better and a happier woman . "
29388	29394	29262	29263	poor Belinda	134	" But I can not ! "
29398	29402	29404	29404	Sarah	135	" I confess , "
29444	29487	29410	29410	her	135	fashion—"I confess that I am a little disappointed that the news of our approaching departure did not bring him to the point . I should have thought that when that fact transpired , not even you could have iced him into silence . "
29488	29499	29501	29501	Belinda	134	" He does not yet know that we are going , "
29504	29511	29501	29501	Belinda	134	" I have not told him . "
29512	29517	29519	29519	Sarah	135	" Have not you ? "
29533	29544	29547	29547	her	135	" Courage ! Then our best card is still unplayed ! "
29560	29624	29547	29547	her	135	" You must tell him to - morrow , at Wesenstein . Choose a good place ; well in the wood if possible , out of eye and ear and Watson shot . Be a little depressed , and make him ask you what is the matter with you . If you could let fall a tear or two ? No ? Ah ! "
29631	29645	29547	29547	her	135	" I am sure you will spoil the whole situation ! Dear me ! "
29653	29665	29547	29547	her	135	" what a charming thing I could have made of it ! "
29666	29672	29674	29674	Belinda	134	" I will tell him , "
29680	29692	29694	29694	Sarah	135	" If it is not brought to a crisis at Wesenstein , "
29697	29761	29694	29694	Sarah	135	" I warn you that I shall ask him his intentions . I have been trying to spirit up granny to do it , but you know how she always shirks every duty . It would have come better from her , but since she will not , I must . I shall tell him that you are wasting away ! I wonder , "
29777	29788	29694	29694	Sarah	135	" whether he will be idiot enough to believe it ? "
29961	29964	29948	29948	she	147	" No . "
31055	31064	31112	31112	she	792	" a lover 's pinch that hurts and is desired"—that

32214	32224	32226	32226	Sarah	135	" Had not you better try some one else ? "
32234	32247	32226	32226	Sarah	135	" it is odd , but he does not seem to hear ! "
32248	32257	32259	32260	the other	2396	" I can not have spoken loud enough , "
32265	32269	32226	32226	Sarah	135	" Mr. Rivers ! "
32270	32282	32284	32284	Sarah	135	" You will have to put up with Herr von Breidenbach ! "
32405	32422	32424	32424	Sarah	135	" It is sad for a young man , being so deaf , is not it ? "
32431	32438	32440	32441	Miss Watson	147	" Is it in his family ? "
32444	32485	32440	32441	Miss Watson	147	" It is in some families , you know . In some families every member is deaf from childhood . All the Champneys of Nether - Stoney are deaf . I must ask him whether it is in his family ! "
32943	32946	32934	32934	Hussars	191	" Famos ! "
32947	32950	32934	32934	Hussars	191	" Kolossal ! "
33437	33445	33420	33420	they	849	" Try to be a little depressed ! "
33865	33870	33846	33846	she	135	" Has he spoken ? "
33891	33895	33897	33898	the other	2396	" Has he ? "
33924	33930	33931	33931	she	135	" More shame for him ! "
33935	33940	33931	33931	she	135	" try the wood . "
33980	33985	33987	33987	he	162	" Is it possible ? "
33997	34007	34008	34008	he	162	" What a bedlam they have made of this ! "
34021	34028	34008	34008	he	162	" shall we try the wood ? "
34086	34095	34096	34096	He	162	" I think we do very well here ! "
34272	34277	34279	34279	Belinda	134	" You were right , "
34293	34299	34279	34279	Belinda	134	" the wood is best . "
34300	34320	34321	34321	he	504	" Then , for God 's sake , come there at once , or she will be after us ! "
34495	34502	34503	34503	he	504	" So we are alone again , "
34512	34532	34503	34503	he	504	" My life is now one long manoeuvre to be alone with you ; and how seldom I succeed ! "
34610	34619	34620	34620	she	147	" Perhaps it is as well for you , "
34628	34634	34635	34635	he	504	" What do you mean ? "
34679	34683	34684	34684	she	147	" I mean , "
34706	34732	34684	34684	she	147	" that perhaps you would not find the charm of tête - à - têtes with me increase in the same proportion as their frequency . "
34733	34739	34684	34684	she	147	" Will you try me ? "
34932	34941	34942	34942	she	147	" Why are you looking at my hand ? "
34948	34973	34942	34942	she	147	" Can you tell me whether I have a good line of life ? do I live long ? am I happy ? do I "
34978	34990	34942	34942	she	147	" she is going to say , but she stops herself — "
35004	35161	34942	34942	she	147	" She is talking rapidly and à bâtons rompus , feeling that she must find words of some kind , no matter what , to fill up that too pregnant silence ; feeling that the cool- breathed wood is stifling , and that if she pause for one moment her tears will have way and for ever disgrace her . For all answer , his heart - hunger mastering him , the poor boy fastens on the hand of which she speaks . There is a singing in his ears and a fog before his eyes ; but he has it . In his own shaking fingers he holds that sacred palm , that never before , save in meaningless comings and goings , has he touched . In all its satin warmth and smoothness , it lies in his . Will he ever let man or devil rob him of it ? He would tell you "
35164	35177	34942	34942	she	147	" So the supreme moment has come , and she recognises it . "
35190	35307	35179	35179	you	895	" she says , stooping her quivering face over their two locked hands . What more propitious moment could even Sarah choose in which to tell him of their departure ? But she does not think of Sarah . For a moment he seems not to take in the meaning of her words . Is there room in all his seeing , hearing , understanding , for aught but the one surpassing fact that his lady has deigned at last to lay her hand in his , and that her starry eyes , soft , merciful , passionate , are , through a splendid curtain of tears , bent on his own . After a while , "
35313	35332	35309	35309	you	0	" he says mistily . Even yet words come but strangely to him , and his head swims . "
35335	35349	35309	35309	you	0	" she answers , she , too , scarce knowing what she speaks ; "
35369	35534	35536	35536	you	897	" Often beforehand has she rehearsed the scene in which she is to tell him of her going . Imagination has tricked it out in various shapes and colours , but the reality is unlike them all . He expresses neither regret nor surprise — he expresses nothing . He only lifts the long lily hand that he holds , and laying its palm against his burning mouth , softly passes his lips to and fro over the little fair lines in which her history is written . Where is his timidity now ? It was only her displeasure that had ever made him afraid ; and even he can see that there is no displeasure here . She is pale , indeed , but it is with the pallor of conquering passion ; and very still , but it is the stillness of one who , looking up in awful joy , sees the dawn of a superb new world breaking upon her . "
35539	35548	35536	35536	you	897	" she says , with a half- sob . "
35559	35581	35549	35549	You	897	" He is no longer lying at her feet . He is kneeling in his beautiful glad manhood at her knee . "
35584	35595	35549	35549	You	897	" he repeats , with a sort of ecstatic scorn . "
35614	35708	35605	35605	you	0	" So it has come . For a moment she closes her eyes , as one faint with a bliss whose keenness makes it cross the borderland and become pain , and so is gathered into his strenuous embrace . For one second she lies on his heart . For one second the breath of her sweet sighs stirs his hair . Their faces are nearing each other slowly , in the luxury of a passionate delay , to make yet more poignant the pleasure of their supreme meeting at last , when — "
35715	35882	35885	35885	she	898	" What horrid sound is this that is breaking into and murdering the divine quiet of the wood ? that is breaking into and murdering their diviner union ? That sound once silenced , the wood will return to its stillness ; but when to them will that moment ever return ? When will that begun embrace be ended ? For one instant they remain paralysed and uncomprehending in each other 's arms ; then , as the voice comes again , the unmistakable brazen voice , from which in less crucial moments they have so often fled in panic aversion , comes nearer and louder , in obviously quick approach to them , they spring apart , and stand dazed and panting in wild - eyed consternation that the cruel work - a - day world has so early thrust itself again upon them , and that their heavenly trance is broken . Belinda is the first to recover the full use of her senses . "
35887	35919	35885	35885	she	898	" says the girl , breathing quick and short , and putting up her trembling hands to her bonnet and hair to ensure that all is neat and tight and unbetraying . "
35932	35993	35994	35995	Mr. Rivers	162	" He does not answer . Perhaps his in - toxication was deeper than hers , and that he has more ado thus suddenly to shake it off . Perhaps the rage of that lost kiss — of his arms emptied of , as soon as filled with , his heart 's desire — makes sight and hearing still thick . "
36003	36031	36000	36001	Mr. Rivers	162	" How loud the voice is now ! It must be only just round the next corner ; and a heavy foot is audible , accompanying it . "
36040	36049	36032	36032	We	899	" says Belinda desperately ; and they go . "
36055	36075	36052	36052	you	162	" cries Miss Watson cheerfully , coming into view , evidently en nage from the speed of her chase . "
36104	36105	36107	36107	you	162	" "
36111	36145	36107	36107	you	162	" asks Belinda , modulating her trembling voice with excessive care ; and , after all her pains , wondering whether it sounds as extraordinary to her interlocutor as it does to herself . "
36152	36160	36161	36161	I	0	" cries the other , fanning herself . "
36164	36167	36161	36161	I	0	" smiling , "
36183	36184	36175	36175	I	0	" "
36200	36234	36235	36235	I	0	" asks Rivers , speaking for the first time , and in a tone of dogged brutality , looking murderously at her . In his face is clearly expressed the sentiment of Balaam : "
36252	36253	36248	36248	I	0	" "
36261	36269	36254	36254	I	0	" replies Miss Watson , still smiling . "
36330	36331	36332	36332	We	899	" "
36338	36360	36332	36332	We	899	" cries the young man , for a moment forgetting him- self , and betrayed into a tone of passionate apprehension . "
36452	36503	36436	36436	you	908	" They have fallen into a stupid silence . That paralysis of the will which overtakes all upon whom Miss Watson bestows her company , has seized them with a numbing force proportioned to their frenzied inward revolt . She drives them before her , unresisting , through the wood . "
36506	36572	36436	36436	you	908	" says Sarah , in a tone of the keenest and most urgent interrogation . It is night , and they are at home again . The long twilight still lies on the city , but the hour is latish . The two girls have been deposited at their house in the Lüttichau Strasse , and are climbing the cold stone stairs to their apartment . "
36575	36591	36436	36436	you	908	" Belinda 's answer is to quicken her pace and race up the remaining steps . "
36599	36620	36436	36436	you	908	" says Sarah , springing after her , active as a cat , and facing her again on the landing . "
36623	36647	36436	36436	you	908	" But before she has extracted any more answer than before , Tommy has opened the door of the ètage and admitted them . "
36652	36688	36650	36650	granny	721	" cries Sarah , marching briskly into the salon , blinking a little from the sudden light , taking the old lady 's smooth face in both hands , and giving it a sounding kiss , "
36730	36731	36732	36732	I	0	" "
36751	36771	36739	36739	I	0	" replies Mrs. Churchill , placidly rearranging the dainty tulles and laces that her granddaughter 's embrace had ruffled ; "
36786	36787	36789	36789	Belinda	134	" "
36796	36823	36789	36789	Belinda	134	" continues Sarah indignantly , looking eagerly towards her sister to see whether this direct statement does not call forth any disclaimer . But none comes . "
36830	36865	36824	36824	You	2421	" rejoins Mrs. Churchill , in a tone of civil but tepid interest , stifling a slight yawn . She does not care much about Belinda , who does not amuse her , while the "
36868	36882	36824	36824	You	2421	" from whose pages her grandchildren 's entrance has roused her , does . "
36887	36900	36902	36902	you	134	" says Sarah , advancing with a threatening gesture to her sister — "
36926	36960	36914	36914	you	134	" Still silence , and a look towards the door suggestive of meditated evasion by it . But this move the other anticipates by placing herself between Belinda and all means of exit . "
36969	36970	36962	36962	you	134	" "
36973	36974	36962	36962	you	134	" "
36983	36984	36976	36976	you	134	" "
36987	36988	36976	36976	you	134	" "
36995	37024	36976	36976	you	134	" cries Sarah in a tone of such profound and unfeigned stupefaction that Belinda , though certainly at this moment not mirthfully minded , breaks into a laugh . "
37048	37084	37038	37038	Granny	156	" But granny has gone back , true as the needle to the Pole , to her novel , and declines to take any further part beyond a slight shrug in her granddaughter 's affairs . "
37092	37116	37117	37117	you	134	" continues Sarah , beginning to walk up and down in a fervid excitement , that contrasts with the elder woman 's phlegm ; "
37157	37172	37151	37151	I	0	" A charming flickering smile breaks like moonlight on water over Belinda 's face . "
37178	37503	37151	37151	I	0	" she says in a voice that , though low and tremulous , is distinct . Then , vanquishing all her junior 's efforts to detain her , pushing indeed impetuously past her , she flies to her own room and double - locks herself in ; nor do all Sarah 's plaintive pipings through the key - hole and angry rattlings of the lock avail to dislodge her . Had Miss Watson 's eye been glued to her spy - glass , as for six or eight out of the twenty - four hours it invariably is , and as , strange to say , it is not about four o'clock in the ensuing afternoon , she would have seen Belinda Churchill setting off for a walk alone . Humanly speaking , not thirty seconds would have elapsed before that lady would have been across the street and down it to ask why alone ? why not with her sister ? and why not with the dogs ? The dogs ask the same question . A Dresden walk indeed , with their poor little snouts embedded in muzzles , is not by any means the same thing as an English one — free to dogs and men as English air ; but such as it is , it is better than nothing . With a muzzle one can still scamper , and even give mutilated sniffs here and there . The prospect of a walk is the one thing that restores to its pristine hyacinthine curl Slutty 's tail , which ever since the arrival of Punch has limply drooped in envy and dejection ; and as for Punch , there is no number of times that he would not bark for the Queen , for Mr. Gladstone , for the devil if required , in order to attain it . To - day they both meet with an abstracted yet peremptory refusal . "
37514	37552	37554	37554	you	135	" says Belinda , giving this piece of information in a not very assured voice , and apparently grateful to the numberless buttons of her gloves for giving her an excuse for bending her head over them . "
37556	37601	37602	37602	My	0	" answers the other carelessly ; then , as something in her sister 's manner reveals to her how pregnant with import is the walk of which she speaks , adds in quite another tone , and with an accent of the liveliest sympathy : "
37629	37634	37644	37644	they	920	" with a shrug , "
37658	37677	37653	37653	they	920	" As Belinda reaches the door it is opened by Tommy , for whom Sarah has just rung . "
37682	37695	37653	37653	they	920	" says she , addressing the boy with an extremely admonitory air , "
37751	39826	37745	37745	you	163	" She is still impressing upon the page 's ductile mind the all - importance of letting in her admirers singly , when Belinda passes out of hearing . Along the street she goes . One side of it is in burning sunshine , the other in deep shadow . It seems to her an emblem of the difference between her life before and after yesterday . Why did not she bring the dogs ? So royally rich in happiness herself , why should not she toss what crumbs she can to any such of God 's poor creatures as ask her ? The memory of Slutty 's eyes imploringly bulging , and of Punch 's disappointed back as he trotted tamely away to his cushion , returns to her with a sort of remorse . She is glad when she has passed through the town and reached the Grosse Garten ; glad to see the long , broad , green drives quietly stretching away ; glad to have left the city noises behind her . And yet even they have sounded melodiously to her to - day . There is perhaps only one sound in the whole world that would not now echo agreeably on her ear — viz . , Miss Watson 's voice ; and even toward Miss Watson how faint and lessening is her ill - will . It is true that she continued to bestow her company upon them yesterday for the remainder of the afternoon ; it is true that by her tyrannic overruling they were sent home in different vehicles ; but could even she prevent their one moment snatched at parting , with time for but a sentence in it — and that sentence such a prayer to her to meet him here to - day ? After to - day she will give Miss Watson leave to thrust herself and her importunities between them if she can . As she makes this reflection she smiles . I think she walks along smiling . The Grosse Garten is not very frequented ; but now and then she passes a couple of loiterers , a single man or woman , a nurse and child . She pities them all from the bottom of her heart : not one of them is going to a tryst with Rivers . She has reached the rendezvous now , a bench beside the Teich ; the dull and stagnant pool where the swans are royally riding in the sunshine . He is not here , he has not come yet . She is the first at the tryst . A slight pang of disappointment shoots across her ; but in a moment is stilled again . Probably in her eagerness she has walked more quickly than is usual with her . Probably she has taken less time than she calculated for . She looks at her watch . It still wants five minutes to the appointed hour . She sits down on the bench to wait , and her eyes fall on the pool . How crowded with green reflections it is ; how different from the weak and pinched leafage of three weeks ago , when she and Sarah last sat here ! It has gathered all the horse - chestnuts into its bosom ; fans and bloom - spikes , you can see them all again as plainly as , sometimes more plainly than in the reality ; wherever , that is to say , the swans ' webs ' oaring has not broken up the mirror into bright shivers . The remembrance of her last walk here with Sarah brings back also the remembrance of their talk ; of Sarah 's advice to her to hurry the pace . The recollection brings a smile of happiness , and of pride too , over her face . She has used no manoeuvres , she has descended to no tricky coquetries ; and yet could even Sarah have won him more wholly than she ? It must be half - past four now . Again she takes out her watch . Yes , it is now five minutes over the half - hour ; but then probably her watch is fast . It always gains . Reassured afresh , she patiently resumes her waiting . The bench on which she is sitting is almost exactly opposite the spot where on the first of May he had thrown her his intercepted nosegay . At the thought she smiles again ; and this time it must be broadly , for a stranger passing by looks hard and inquiringly at her , as though imagining that her smile was a recognition of and greeting to himself . In a second she is grave again . This place is too public ; when he comes they will seek one of the more private paths . When he comes ? But he is not come yet ! . Why does not he come ? She turns her head anxiously in the direction whence she expects him to appear , a creeping disquietude beginning , despite herself , to invade her heart . Is it possible that she can have mistaken his directions ? Is it possible that , as she is waiting expectantly for him here , so may he be waiting expectantly for her in some other corner of the large pleasure - gardens ? But she dismisses the idea . Did not his few words drop , distinct and clear as articulate words could do , into her ear ? Has not she been saying them over to herself ever since ? There is nothing for it but patience . Again she fixes her eyes , not so untroubled as at first , upon the Teich , the swan - house , the swans . To the latter a child is throwing bread ; a homely burgher couple have stopped to applaud . In the fostering sunshine the horse - chestnut leaves seem to grow momently larger and greener as she looks . Why does not he come ? A sense of hurt maiden dignity , of hot and cruel shame at being thus made to appear so far the more eager of the two , at being kept thus long and unworthily waiting at her first love - rendezvous , has come to complicate and intensify her anxiety . In all the mental pictures that through her disturbed and tossing night she has drawn of this meeting , the one contingency that has never crossed her mind as most distantly possible , is that he should be a defaulter from it ; he , whose mad over - eagerness to fulfil any engagement in which she is to have a part , has over and over again kept him raging up and down the Lüttichau Strasse for hours and hours in rain and shine , in fervid waiting , until the time has come when he may decently make his appearance . And to - day he is already half an hour late ! It is impossible — incredible ! And yet if any untoward accident had occurred to prevent him , surely he would have written ! Perhaps even now there is a note awaiting her at home . Goaded by this thought , she takes two feverish steps in the direction of a return ; then , arrested by the reflection that he may arrive in her absence and find her gone , she stops in painful irresolution . To sit still and look at the swans any longer is at all events impossible . She walks — but with how different a tread to that with which she had at first approached the spot!—she walks a little away ; not so far as to lose the bench , to which her hopes still cling , from sight , but far enough to get a good view down the great main drive . With her trembling hand lifted to shield her eyes , she strains her gaze eagerly down it . Oh , if she could but catch the most distant glimpse of him ! Under the trees spreads in glory the dazzling strong spring grass , with its brightness toned down here and there by the shadows of the dark tree - trunks , that in their afternoon quiet lie stilly on it . There is nothing ! With a sort of sob in her throat that shocks herself , she is turning away , when , at the very other end of the avenue , she becomes aware of a man 's figure that has suddenly come within eye - range . It is so distant that it is no taller than a pin ; but surely it has something of his walk and gait . Catching at this new hope , she advances quickly to meet the figure . Yes ; it certainly has a look of him . Well , she will not upbraid him . No hurt self - love nor petty sulks shall be permitted to mar the heavenly harmony of the first outpouring of their hearts into each other . She will not even ask him why he is late . No doubt he has some good reason , which in his own time he will tell her . But , alas ! she may keep her high resolves for another occasion . She will not need them now . It requires no very near approach to the stranger to reveal that he is not Rivers ; that he is not even , when you come close to him , in the very least like him . It is such a bitter disappointment that she turns into a side alley to hide her tears ; but quickly drying them again , hastily returns to the meeting - place , in the panic fear that he may have appeared there from some unexpected point of the compass . But he is not there ; and as she ascertains this , with a blank heart - sinking , the city clocks strike the half - hour . It is half - past five ! For a whole hour she has been dancing attendance on his pleasure ; waiting here , ridiculous and befooled . With a movement of strong indignation she begin to walk swiftly homewards ; but before she has gone five yards , her purpose slacks . She can not yet bear to face the fact that this is what her day 's splendid and apparently so sure promises are to end in — this humiliated , baulked , back- coming ! She will give him five minutes more . Possibly , not very improbably even , he may have mistaken the appointed hour , and have thought that it was half - past five instead of half - past four . In that case he would be scarcely at all late , even now . A little recovered by this new flicker of hope , she sits down . Yes ; she will give him five minutes more , and during all these five she will not look round once , or send her eyes in search of him . Perhaps that will bring her luck . But it does not . The five minutes are gone , and he is not here . She gives him ten more , and then five again . Twice she repeats her little feverish excursion to the head of the main avenue ; these times she is not even deluded by the will - of - the - wisp of a possible resemblance in any of the few saunterers that occupy it , to him whom she , with a now so evident hopelessness , seeks . It is only the clocks striking six that at length makes her really and desperately turn homewards . Each one of their tranquil strokes seems to her the beat of a cruel hammer on her heart . But putting out of the question the bootlessness of any further delay , self - respect , at length aroused , forbids her to add any more moments to the humiliating and miserable hour and a half she has already spent . "
39844	40066	39835	39835	I	0	" she says to herself in bitterest dejection , as she passes along . She holds her head , usually carried a little loftily , well down . It seems to her as if everybody who meets her must read in her face her deep discomfiture , and the fool 's errand on which she has been . She quickens her pace to get away from them ; to be safe out of the streets so full of gaudy light , where at any time she may meet an acquaintance — worse still , one of their yesterday 's party ; worst of all , Miss Watson . As she nears the Lüttichau Strasse her distress lightens a little ; the hope of finding there a note , a message , some solving of this most inhuman riddle , buoys up her steps and gives life again to her looks . It can not be but that there must be some clearing up of this wretched contretemps . It will have , as she says to herself , to be a very bright clearing up indeed , to indemnify her for the sufferings of the afternoon — that very afternoon whose anticipated joys she had pitied every chance passer - by that she met , for not being about to share . "
40069	40091	40098	40098	you	924	" cries Sarah , standing in the open salon door , and looking expectantly beyond her sister 's figure for another , "
40118	40121	40098	40098	you	924	" laughing , "
40139	40191	40133	40133	I	0	" Belinda had not meant to have entered the salon . She had hoped to have slunk unperceived to her room ; for has not Tommy , in answer to her fevered questions , philosophically assured her that there has been neither note nor message left for her in her absence ? "
40195	40200	40133	40133	I	0	" she says hoarsely ; "
40220	40221	40216	40216	he	923	" "
40225	40248	40211	40211	He	923	" echoes Sarah in a tone of bottomless wonder , her pretty eyes and mouth opening with a stare and a gape . "
40251	40259	40211	40211	He	923	" gradually recovering the power of speech , "
40279	40280	40272	40272	you	0	" "
40288	40327	40281	40281	I	0	" answers Belinda , trying to speak steadily , though at that humiliating confession such a tide of crimson rushes over her poor proud face as one would think must leave all the rest of her body bloodless . "
40333	40345	40357	40357	He	923	" cries the other in a tone of the wildest excitement ; "
40377	40383	40373	40373	he	923	" Belinda shakes her head . "
40390	40391	40392	40392	Tommy	163	" "
40394	40406	40407	40407	Tommy	163	" repeats Sarah in a tone of the most contemptuous indignation . "
40457	40465	40466	40466	Tommy	163	" Then , ringing the bell violently , "
40468	40474	40466	40466	Tommy	163	" she says very sharply , "
40512	40559	40560	40560	I	0	" Paying no attention whatever to his asseverations , she waves him from the room ; and then follow a few moments of painful waiting . At the end of them Tommy returns with , sure enough , a missive of some kind on a salver . "
40568	40583	40560	40560	I	0	" exclaims Sarah , triumphantly pouncing upon it and the unlucky child at once . "
40604	40713	40719	40719	they	933	" And he may pour into her unheeding ear his faltering attempt to lay the blame on Gustel , who answers the bell when he is out ; she does not hear a word he says . In a fury of impatient anxiety , she is stooping over Belinda 's shoulder : Belinda , whose shaking fingers can scarcely tear the envelope asunder . A thin blue paper falls out . It is the bill from a Porzellan Handlung for a couple of Meissen figures purchased there a week ago . In an uncontrollable spasm of misery , she throws it on the floor and bursts into tears . "
40762	40823	40752	40752	I	0	" Such are the sentences uttered by Miss Watson 's voice , and plainly audible through the door on that same evening , as addressed to Tommy , who is opposing his puny infant strength to the forcible breaking in upon his mistresses at their dessert by the before - mentioned lady . With what result may readily be guessed . "
40831	40977	40825	40825	you	936	" cries she , thrusting the boy aside and bursting in upon them . They are sitting , as they have sat upon so many happier evenings , the one old woman and the two young ones , in their pretty soigné evening dresses . For the last three quarters of an hour Belinda has been struggling to solve the problem how to swallow . It is dreadful to eat , but it is still more dreadful to have your lack of appetite noticed and wondered at . Grapes are perhaps less difficult than most other things for an unwilling palate to deal with ; and she has taken a few Muscats , and is holding a small bunch between her hot and listless fingers at the time of Miss Watson 's bouncing entrance . Instantly they fall with a slight patter upon her plate . "
40982	41022	40980	40980	him	162	" asks Sarah eagerly , jumping up and running towards the intruder , while Mrs. Churchill drops the little red Alpine strawberry she is in the act of lifting to her lips , and says in an amazed voice : "
41034	41035	41036	41036	You	147	" "
41043	41055	41036	41036	You	147	" says the other loudly , in a voice of relief . "
41064	41065	41056	41056	I	0	" "
41079	41111	41112	41112	I	0	" As she speaks , Sarah places herself adroitly between their visitor and her view of Belinda , and mentally thanks her gods for the failing light and the unkindled gas . "
41120	41134	41112	41112	I	0	" begins the other , only too happy to embark upon her tale ; "
41144	41153	41154	41154	I	0	" She is in rather dishevelled morning dress . "
41182	41234	41235	41235	I	0	" Despite her anxious suspense , Sarah can not avoid a sardonic smile . It is the open secret of the whole English colony that the Ray family has been compelled , by Watson assiduities , regretfully and at great personal inconvenience , to curtail their stay in the Saxon capital . "
41242	41246	41235	41235	I	0	" pursues the unconscious narrator—"I
41316	41317	41313	41314	young Rivers	162	" "
41320	41328	41356	41356	He	162	" Even Sarah is a little breathless . "
41410	41447	41448	41448	He	162	" If she ever meets him again ! Belinda is leaning forward in an attitude of the acutest strained listening ; her heart is beating against the edge of the table with loud , hard blows . "
41456	41462	41448	41448	He	162	" pursues Miss Watson fluently ; "
41507	41508	41499	41499	I	0	" "
41512	41520	41521	41521	I	0	" murmurs Sarah , under her breath . "
41740	41807	41808	41808	I	0	" She stops , out of breath , her narrative ended ; nor , for a moment , does any one of her three auditors comment upon it . Belinda has sunk back in her chair , and round her the room is spinning . Sarah , Miss Watson , granny , the dogs , all are whirling . Mrs. Churchill is the first to speak . "
41811	41840	41808	41808	I	0	" she says , in a voice still somewhat ruffled by Miss Watson 's inroad , and picking up the sugar - sifter in her delicate old fingers , "
41867	41868	41856	41856	Punch	186	" "
41875	41896	41856	41856	Punch	186	" cries Miss Watson , in a loud aggrieved tone , as if Rivers ' departure were a personal injury . "
41918	41926	41910	41910	he	162	" Nobody takes the trouble to answer . "
41954	42012	41951	41951	they	2422	" turning directly to Belinda . By a great exertion of the powers of the mind over their weaker brothers of the body , Belinda has forced the room and the people to stand steady and still again . By a like exertion she frames a sentence , which , though short , is not conspicuously tremulous . "
42019	42020	41951	41951	they	2422	" "
42028	42056	42022	42022	he	162	" says Sarah , coming hastily to her sister 's rescue , and trying to divert from her the brunt of Miss Watson 's eyes and speech . "
42063	42064	42065	42065	I	0	" "
42070	42087	42088	42088	I	0	" answers Miss Watson , looking down on the floor for a moment in inquisitive reflection . "
42136	42145	42129	42129	I	0	" in a tone of the sincerest vexation , "
42155	42156	42157	42157	I	0	" "
42170	42197	42162	42162	you	957	" says Sarah ; adding , as she casts an oblique glance in the friendly dusk towards Belinda , to see how she is holding up , "
42207	42208	42209	42209	I	0	" "
42219	42231	42209	42209	I	0	" answers the other , in a voice of mysterious curiosity . "
42266	42355	42356	42356	Tommy	163	" It is not till every possible conjecture has been exhausted , till the few facts known have been worn bare and shiny by turning and handling , that Miss Watson at length withdraws . She would not have gone then , had not the idea suddenly presented itself , that , if she make haste , she will be able before bedtime to force herself and her news upon three or four more households . No sooner is the outer door safely shut upon her , than — "
42360	42371	42356	42356	Tommy	163	" says Mrs. Churchill , in a tone of irritation . "
42398	42399	42402	42402	granny	721	" "
42409	42415	42406	42406	you	721	" replies Sarah , disrespectfully . "
42468	42495	42455	42455	she	964	" As she speaks , she puts her hand under her sister 's heavy hanging , limp arm , and draws her away towards the salon . "
42505	42514	42503	42503	granny	721	" she says , with a parting laugh , "
42538	42740	42530	42530	you	721	" But arrived in the salon , she no longer laughs . Belinda has thrown herself flaccidly into a chair . The curtains are undrawn , and through them her eyes stare out upon the street — the street where , through the deepening gloom , the lit lamps , but now such insignificant yellow specks , are beginning to gain importance and use — the street so continually worn by his eager footsteps , where she has so often heard them , up and down , up and down , waiting , watching , for hours , if it be past all seemliness and moderation for him to venture a visit , on the bare chance of her throwing him out one parting smile . All through dinner she has been dreading the evening — dreading its suspense , the bell that will ring now and again , the intervals that will elapse , and then the blank silence , nothing resulting , showing that it was not he who rang . Well , suspense is over and gone now ; but she would be glad to have it back again , seeing that it has taken hope with it . "
42743	42782	42530	42530	you	721	" she says after a pause , looking up wearily at her sister , who stands beside her with her fair arms folded and her white brows bent in an attitude of serious reflection very unnatural to her ; "
42796	42797	42798	42798	I	0	" "
42800	42804	42798	42798	I	0	" replies Sarah . "
42827	42839	42812	42812	he	971	" Belinda 's shoulders lift themselves slightly in an unbelieving shrug . "
42845	42846	42847	42847	He	971	" "
42856	42861	42847	42847	He	971	" pursues Sarah decidedly , "
42887	42908	42863	42863	they	972	" Belinda offers no contradiction , but neither does any ray of hope brighten her dull face at this hypothesis . "
42914	42940	42910	42910	you	970	" asks Sarah , looking penetratingly in her elder 's face , so as to glean her answer from it rather than from her words , "
42990	42991	42986	42986	you	970	" "
43000	43082	42986	42986	you	970	" She has writhed herself half over , and is thrusting her poor face into the cushioned back of the chair , as if she wished that she could for ever bury it there , while the blood seems to be rushing in hot shamed tinglings all over her body , as her sister 's words call up before her in all the vividness of new life that scene in the wood , in which snubbing bore so small a part . "
43089	43100	43102	43102	I	0	" replies Sarah collectedly , and with cool common sense , "
43124	43132	43121	43121	I	0	" with an accent of wakened anxiety , "
43144	43145	43146	43146	I	0	" "
43156	43173	43146	43146	I	0	" says Belinda , startled by this suggestion out of her own hot and miserable retrospect ; "
43181	43182	43174	43174	he	971	" "
43185	43189	43174	43174	he	971	" says Sarah ; "
43227	43274	43275	43275	You	980	" For a few moments there is a silence , cut into only by the sound of Punch 's snores , regular and long drawn out , through the door . It is Belinda who , contrary to what one would have expected , breaks it . "
43281	43305	43275	43275	You	980	" she says with a hard smile , that yet looks as if it needed only one touch to make it dissolve into bitter tears—"you
43332	43339	43318	43318	you	980	" with a sort of gasp , "
43355	43356	43358	43358	you	980	" "
43361	43397	43358	43358	you	980	" cries Sarah , with a derisive laugh whose offensive quality is , however , lessened by the soothing gesture of a kind arm thrown at the same moment round her afflicted elder 's neck , "
43452	43465	43466	43466	You	980	" But Belinda is too much cast down to make any rejoinder . "
43473	43491	43469	43469	my	0	" continues Sarah in a counterfeit apology that is contradicted by the lurking mirth in her eye , "
43533	43540	43543	43543	David	143	" breaking into an unavoidable laugh , "
43560	43575	43556	43556	My	0	" passing her light hand with a stroking motion down Belinda 's heaving shoulder , "
43600	44157	44158	44158	He	985	" This is all the consolation , if consolation it can be called , that Belinda has to take to bed with her . This is all the consolation with which she wakes next morning and exchanges the shadowy muddle of her discomfortable visions for the not less discomfortable reality . She had slept — to her own surprise — through the earlier part of the night ; but in May - time day and night faint into each other ; and though the light is broad and universal , yet the hour is a small one when she awakes , with that hopeless decidedness , that irrevocable bursting of the chains of slumber , which tells its unhappy victim that all juggling efforts to overtake the flown blessing will be of no avail . She lies on her uneasy bed for as long as she can bear it ; then , since the hour is still far too early to ring for her hot water , and so make public an abnormal condition of mind and body , she rises , and throwing on her dressing- gown , sits down by the open window and watches the strides of the morning , stepping , clean and young and lucent , across the old and dirty earth . Even the ugly Bohemian Railway Station and the stucco houses come in for a portion of his kindness . How much more the little hoary garden plat and the dew - pearled tulips ! It has been an open question since the world began , whether the loveliness of nature assuages or aggravates the misery of humanity in its more miserable moods . Belinda would subscribe to the latter opinion . It seems to her that she could better bear the look of the day — that it would not make her so angry — if slant rain were slashing the earth , or if it were locked in a prison of frost , or wound in a shroud of snow . The splendour of the transparent air ; the trees , just lightly wagging their heads in the early wind ; even the short - tailed starlings , cheerfully walking about while the sun touches up their apparently sombre feathers , and brings out little rainbow colours in them ; each — each has a separate stab for her . There were starlings at Moritzburg ; there were tulips in the inn garden at Lohmen : can she set her eyes upon any one common object that does not bring a memory with it ? She has never been of a very bright or hopeful temperament with regard to her own future ; not one of those happy young ones to whom the long life ahead seems swathed in a golden mist . The deep conviction of her own paucity of powers of attraction , a conviction which has been with her as long as she can remember anything — as long as the far - away days of short frocks and coming down to dessert , when strangers used to pull Sarah 's long curls and laugh at her smart answers — a conviction that for a bright interval has been shaken , now settles down in its cold and humbling certainty again in her heart . "
44164	44177	44178	44178	he	985	" she says to herself , in a tone of surpassing bitterness ; "
44216	44303	44304	44304	Belinda	134	" The clocks one after another , in their different voices , have just struck eight . Cramped with long sitting in one position , which she has forgotten to change , she rises , and is beginning to walk up and down the little room when a knock comes , a quick , loud , rattling knock , which , in its lively energy , partakes of the nature of the person who has executed it , and who adds to it an urgent calling : "
44312	44323	44326	44326	I	0	" Awake!—is she awake ? She smiles grimly to herself . "
44330	44348	44326	44326	I	0	" she answers in an unwilling voice , that she in vain tries to make sound sleepy . "
44358	44422	44353	44353	you	134	" cries the voice impatiently , accompanying the question by a long and noisier rattling of the handle . But Belinda takes no step towards complying . She wishes for no one 's company , not even Sarah's — perhaps Sarah 's least of all ; for is not she the one person from whom she has been unable to hide her humiliation ? "
44428	44433	44425	44425	you	134	" she asks morosely . "
44444	44467	44435	44435	you	134	" replies Sarah , desisting for a moment from her rattling , so that her voice may be the more penetratingly heard , "
44482	44507	44472	44472	I	0	" Her note ! In one bound Belinda is across the room , has turned the key , and is palely facing her sister . "
44512	44541	44472	44472	I	0	" cries Sarah , strutting in , dishevelled , dressing - gowned , triumphant , and holding in her hand a letter , which the other silently snatches . "
44598	44613	44644	44644	his	987	" Belinda has opened the envelope , and is staring strainingly at the paper . "
44617	44628	44644	44644	his	987	" she says , passing her hand across her eyes . "
44636	44637	44644	44644	his	987	" "
44647	44663	44644	44644	his	987	" cries Sarah , coming to her aid , and examining with surprise the superscription . "
44671	44672	44668	44668	he	987	" "
44679	44691	44677	44677	his	987	" says Belinda , again passing her hand across her eyes ; "
44716	44717	44707	44707	I	0	" "
44727	44736	44707	44707	I	0	" replies Sarah , complying with some alacrity . "
44796	44809	44840	44840	he	987	" looking at the paper aslant and half shutting one eye . ) "
44902	44903	44887	44887	God	184	" "
44906	44919	44887	44887	God	184	" cries Belinda , stretching out her trembling hand for the note . "
44931	44932	44921	44921	you	0	" "
44937	44982	45006	45006	he	987	" There is a silence . Belinda 's eyes are riveted on the few scrawled words — so few — on which all her future is to be built . Among them is there one which will support the weight of a legitimate hope ? "
44992	45004	45006	45006	he	987	" says Sarah , in a tone of wounded common sense , "
45051	45052	45006	45006	he	987	" "
45072	45087	45090	45090	he	987	" asks Belinda , appealing in wistful fever to her cool , shrewd junior . "
45098	45103	45104	45104	I	0	" replies Sarah decidedly . "
45108	45115	45104	45104	I	0	" with a rather satirical look , "
45140	45150	45138	45138	yourself	0	" striking the untidy blurred page with her forefinger ; "
45167	45168	45138	45138	yourself	0	" "
45172	45189	45199	45199	I	0	" repeats Belinda , as though speaking to herself , and still looking at the note ; "
45212	45213	45196	45196	I	0	" "
45227	45267	45218	45220	the poor boy	2450	" says Sarah gaily , sweeping in her long peignoir to the window , and standing blithely looking out at the tulips and the starlings — as brightly pretty as the former , as robustly cheerful as the latter . "
45336	46405	45325	45325	I	0	" walking to the door . Neither must Belinda ; and yet , for long after her sister has left her , she sits , still poring over the meagre sheet that is her first love - letter . She laughs derisively . Will it be her last , too ? At that thought she sets herself to weary calculations . It is , without stopping — he will , of course , stop nowhere between Dresden and London — a thirty - six hours ' journey . Probably five or six hours more will be occupied in getting on to Yorkshire . It is a four days ' post from England to Dresden . Even if he write to her immediately on arriving — a most unlikely hypothesis — it can not be much less than a week before she hears . There must be five or six absolutely void black days , that yet will have the same complement of hours in them as the day at Moritzburg or the day at Wesenstein . She lays her hot forehead on the cool wooden chair - back . Oh , if they could but be slept through ! But at this moment the entrance of her maid , with the usual paraphernalia of her toilet , sufficiently reminds her that they can not . They can not be slept through ! They must be dressed through , talked through , eaten through , made expeditions through , joked through . Worst of all , his departure , its cause , his probable or improbable return , he himself , must be continually discussed and worn threadbare in her hearing . This , indeed , is an evil from which she suffers for only two days . After that , he being gone , and never having sought to make himself specially acceptable to any member of the little society save one , he slips from their talk and their thoughts . She is deeply thankful when their chatter about him ceases , and yet angry with them for so soon forgetting him . And meanwhile the days in summer procession pace stately by , full of sap and growth and laughter . The date of the Churchill departure is now fixed for the 5th of June ; and as that period approaches , a freezing panic fear begins to clutch Belinda more and more tightly in its hold — the fear that her own going may antedate the arrival of his letter ; that he may write to her here , and the letter not be forwarded . The many tales she has heard of lives dismally wrecked upon some such small accident throng her memory . The house is full of signs of an approaching déménagement ; full of packing , disarranging , bustling . It is mostly full also of German officers , who , being aware that their time for enjoying the society and the wit of their love - worthy Sarah is all too quickly passing , are resolved to have nothing to reproach themselves with in the way of not having availed themselves of it while they were able . Some of them are not unwilling to extend their endearments to the elder sister , seeing her no longer monopolized by her surly fellow - country- man ; but she has received their compliments so blankly , that , ashamed of their brief infidelity , they have clanked hastily back to their first love , who sees them go and return with the same joyous indifference . Belinda has been innocent of the least intention to snub them , but how can one receive pretty speeches — any speeches intelligently , when one is continually doing a sum in one 's head—36 and 5 , 4I ; I day from 4 days ; 1 day from 3 days , etc . ? The packing is not of so wholly occupying a nature as to exclude incidental amusements . It does not even forbid a farewell excursion to Tharandt ; an excursion planned by Sarah and her rout of Uhlans ; with some necessary padding of a lenient chaperon , and compliant girls . Belinda has believed herself equal to sharing it . Tharandt is rendered agonizing by no associations . She has never visited Tharandt in his company , but , at the last moment , a trifle robs her of her fortitude — the sight of her cobwebby Wesenstein gown , extended with unconscious tactless cruelty by her maid on the bed . She throws herself down , ungovernably sobbing , beside it . It seems like the husk of her lost happiness . By - and - by they are all gone , and the house is left to her and to silence . It is deserted even by the dogs , who have been taken out driving by Mrs. Churchill ; Slutty , supinely indifferent to view and air , curled at the carriage - bottom , and Punch standing up on his hind - legs , with his forepaws on the carriage - side , like an unsteady heraldic lion . Belinda laughs a little at the thought of him as she returns to the salon , which is beginning to wear a desolate look , reduced to its own lodging - house furniture and shorn of the graces bestowed upon it by the Churchills ' Indian rugs and Turkish chair - backs . Its new ugliness , meeting her eye , seems ' to add to the vexation of her spirit . The sunlight on the street vexes her too . She wanders for a while aimlessly about the room , and then drops as aimlessly into a chair . To an observer it would seem that she were quite without occupation . But it is not so . She is still at work upon that sum . She has just finished it , or rather she has just begun it afresh , when an unexpected interruption drives it , not away — nothing , alas ! could do that — but into the background of her mind . The summer afternoon is at its drowsiest , even the flies buzz inertly along the pane , when the room - door opens and Professor Forth looks in . "
46411	46416	46406	46406	I	0	" he says formally , "
46437	46474	46427	46427	he	1000	" At the sound of his voice , separated by how many seas and continents from her thoughts , Belinda starts to her feet ; then , conjuring suddenly up a civil smile , says gently : "
46498	46530	46492	46492	you	999	" He has entered the room now in his hard and graceless academic black , which somehow looks out of character with the light - coloured room and the blazing day . "
46538	46543	46536	46536	her	135	" he replies sharply , "
46594	46602	46603	46603	I	0	" glancing angrily at the Dresden clock . "
46615	46653	46608	46608	she	135	" replies Belinda , bursting into a helpless laugh ; but indeed there is no greater fallacy than that one may not laugh heartily , violently , and not hysterically , when one 's heart is breaking ; "
46662	46663	46654	46654	she	135	" "
46672	46723	46664	46664	She	135	" retorts he snappishly . Belinda sighs ; her mirth vanished as quickly as it came . She has no energy to take up the cudgels for Sarah , of whose conduct no one can think worse than she does , and of whose meditated villainy she is guiltily aware . "
46728	46733	46724	46724	She	135	" she says lamely . "
46757	46812	46813	46813	He	1003	" he replies fretfully . He has walked to the window , where he now stands drowned in a bath of golden radiance . Never has he looked less lovable ; ill - humour rendering yet more pinched and captious his pinched pedant face ; and never has Belinda felt so charitably towards him . "
46826	46832	46818	46818	Heaven	153	" she says to herself ; "
46855	46856	46858	46858	you	0	" "
46865	46888	46858	46858	you	0	" she asks not unkindly , going up and standing beside him in the rain of sunbeams in her large young beauty ; "
46897	46925	46926	46926	You	0	" It is obvious that the idea had never occurred to him that in her he should find either the ability or the willingness to aid him . "
46931	46936	46926	46926	You	0	" he answers stiffly ; "
46958	46971	46941	46941	I	0	" glancing at a bundle of notes and papers in his hands , "
46988	46998	46983	46983	She	135	" with a revived and extreme exasperation of tone , "
47041	47042	47043	47043	She	135	" "
47048	47053	47043	47043	She	135	" assents Belinda soothingly . "
47103	47134	47135	47135	You	0	" As she speaks , she lifts to his her large serious eyes , full of a compassion that is none the less sincere for being slightly tinged with contempt . "
47140	47145	47146	47146	I	0	" he repeats ceremoniously . "
47161	47162	47150	47150	I	0	" "
47173	47181	47150	47150	I	0	" she answers , stifling a sigh . "
47200	47309	47186	47186	I	0	" As she speaks she walks towards the writing - table , and quickly and methodically arranging the writing materials , seats herself , and in a few moments is penning her first sentence from his dictation . She has undertaken the office out of pure good - nature , and at first fulfils it quite mechanically . Gradually , however , as the meaning of the words she is writing penetrates through her ears into her understanding , a slight interest in the subject in hand awakens in her . She asks a question or two . By - and - by there comes a Greek word . "
47318	47325	47186	47186	I	0	" she asks , glancing up . "
47343	47344	47345	47345	You	0	" "
47353	47372	47373	47373	I	0	" he asks , with a slight touch of regret in his tone . She shakes her head . "
47381	47386	47376	47376	I	0	" smiling a little , "
47399	47400	47401	47401	I	0	" "
47409	47414	47401	47401	I	0	" he says aggrievedly . "
47422	47423	47416	47416	she	135	" "
47432	47446	47416	47416	she	135	" he says , beginning to pace gloomily up and down the room , "
47472	47503	47470	47470	Sarah	135	" Belinda has paused in her writing , her elbow leant on the table , and idly brushing with the feather of the pen the red curve of her lips . "
47511	47521	47546	47546	you	0	" continues he , still pursuing his irritated walk , "
47543	47544	47546	47546	you	0	" "
47550	47556	47546	47546	you	0	" cries Belinda , surprised . "
47572	47573	47570	47570	her	135	" "
47581	47591	47576	47576	I	0	" he goes on , not heeding the interruption , "
47667	47699	47640	47640	she	135	" Belinda drops the pen . It is not a nearly large enough shield to hide the convulsive mirth that this revelation of her sister 's hideous hypocrisy has called forth . "
47706	47721	47732	47732	her	135	" continues he , fortunately unaware of the character of his auditor 's emotion , "
47749	47753	47732	47732	her	135	" with an exaggerated emphasis,"her
47780	47904	47769	47769	I	0	" Belinda , still unable to speak , contents herself with a gentle head - shake , as commentary and gloss upon which there comes , at the same moment , the sound of a scampering step on the stone stairs , of a loudly singing voice , waking to life again the dead dumb house . In a moment the door flies open , and the person whose mind is expected so soon to resume its soberer bias stands before them , her hat a good deal on one side , from the weight of the flowering may - bough stuck rakishly in it — the may - bough whose strong and almost pungent perfume comes rushing into the room with her . "
47917	47922	47907	47907	you	0	" cries she joyously . "
47960	47967	47957	47958	Mr. Forth	209	" suddenly catching sight of him . "
47970	47980	47957	47958	Mr. Forth	209	" with an abrupt change and refrigeration of tone , "
48027	48036	48016	48017	the Greeks	1014	" There is an ominous silence . Then — "
48041	48076	48016	48017	the Greeks	1014	" begins the Professor , in a voice trembling with indignation , while the puckers of anger that Belinda 's mild hand has been smoothing away , again form their network over his face , "
48103	48109	48115	48115	you	0	" Belinda leaves the room . "
48125	48139	48140	48140	I	0	" says Sarah next morning , as the two sisters sit awaiting breakfast . "
48177	48178	48180	48180	you	0	" "
48190	48195	48196	48196	I	0	" asks Belinda grimly . "
48201	48208	48196	48196	I	0	" continues Sarah , feigning deafness , "
48268	48269	48270	48270	I	0	" "
48294	48325	48270	48270	I	0	" replies Belinda trenchantly . But the snub , like many kindred predecessors , passes airily over Sarah 's yellow head , and leaves no mark upon her satisfied serenity . "
48328	48350	48351	48351	Punch	186	" she says , taking the two dogs ' forepaws in her hands , and looking gravely in their black faces , "
48372	48392	48393	48393	I	0	" Belinda has sunk back into herself . She is wondering feverishly what is making the letters so late . "
48403	48425	48393	48393	I	0	" pursues Sarah , loosing the dogs ' paws , and sinking back with a sigh of complacency in her chair . "
48451	48458	48444	48444	He	1019	" with a slight regretful pout , "
48466	48467	48470	48470	he	1019	" "
48475	48480	48470	48470	he	1019	" says Belinda spitefully . "
48494	48595	48487	48487	I	0	" cries Sarah , roused by this challenge . But Belinda makes no rejoinder . To her , Sarah and her light loves have become distant and insignificant things . Her strained ears have caught , or she thinks so , the sound of a footstep . Of course it is only Tommy bringing in the breakfast ; but he may be bringing her death - warrant or her evangel , too . It is the first day on which , according to her calculation of distances , it would be possible for her to receive a letter from Rivers . "
48601	48610	48487	48487	I	0	" continues Sarah , smiling rosily to herself , "
48652	48653	48655	48655	I	0	" "
48657	48661	48662	48662	He	1019	" quite inattentively . "
48667	48674	48662	48662	He	1019	" continues Sarah , growing grave . "
48678	48684	48688	48688	they	1023	" throwing up her eyes , "
48691	48707	48708	48708	I	0	" The sound has died away again . It could not have been even Tommy . "
48713	48738	48708	48708	I	0	" resumes Sarah , with that glow of modest retrospective satisfaction still diffused all over her , extending even to her pink cambric gown . "
48773	48945	48946	48946	I	0	" She stops , her attention diverted into a fresh channel , for at this moment Gustel throws open the door , and Tommy enters , his childish arms extended to their widest stretch to embrace the breakfast tray , upon which , beside coffee - pot and rolls , lies a heap of letters and papers . Belinda does not stir now that the moment so breathlessly longed for has come ; she would fain put it off again , shove it away a little further . A paralysis of fear nails her to her chair . She feels an impulse of anger - against Sarah for doing what she herself is incapable of ; for her quick movement towards the tray , her hasty turning over of the family 's correspondence . There is a second 's pause — a pause during which hope still lives : then in a moment it is dead . Sarah 's voice would tell her that , even if her words did not . "
48957	49278	48946	48946	I	0	" she says reluctantly , tossing her three or four letters without looking at her . Belinda 's heart dies ; then suddenly there flares up a tiny flame of hope in it again . Possibly Sarah may not recognise his handwriting . Probably it is so disguised and disfigured by trouble and emotion as to be unrecognisable . Was not this the case with her note ? She snatches at the letters and looks dizzily from one to the other of the superscriptions . Alas , no ! they are all in the handwriting of familiar and habitual correspondents . She has told herself all night that her expectations were not highly raised for today ; that to - day is the first day on which it would be possible to hear ; that , being only possible , it is not also probable ; that her chances are better for to - morrow or the day after . And yet , now that the disappointment has come , it seems to her ruinous and final . Her first movement is to dash the letters down on her lap ; then , with that instinct of self - respect which parts us from the savage and the beast , remembering that Tommy 's round gaze is upon her , she picks up one , and shakily unfolding it , lets her misery - shaded eyes fall on the page . Only for a moment , however ; a fresh thought makes her drop it and fly to the papers . In a second she has torn open one of the English journals , the Standard ; and seizing the advertisement sheet , greedily turns to the column of births , deaths , and marriages . She runs her eye down the names ; she will not allow this horrible swimming to blind her ; she will read for herself . "
49340	49357	49338	49338	Rivers	143	" The swimming is gone . She can see it clearly ; there is no mistake . "
49379	49447	49374	49377	M.P. , aged 54	1026	" At the same moment , Tommy , his functions ended , shuts the door behind him . For a moment or two Belinda stares dully at the announcement , then silently holds it out to her sister . But Sarah does not see it ; her head is buried between the other sheets of the paper , which she has been too impatient even to cut . "
49452	49475	49448	49448	I	0	" she says , speaking suddenly in a voice that is a little tremulous , a little awed , and yet triumphant . "
49508	49509	49480	49480	his	162	" "
49513	49594	49596	49596	We	1028	" repeats Belinda with a gasp , turning as white as the table - cloth , and her great grey eyes dilating , while the image of her poor boy - lover and his whole - hearted devotion to , his innocent enthusiasm about his father , at which she had sometimes smiled , superior yet envious , darts painfully back upon her memory . Sarah has snatched a table - knife and is rapidly and jaggedly cutting the paper . "
49746	49763	49766	49766	people	523	" Sarah pauses with a shudder of disgust , even her blooming cheek a little paled . "
49771	49776	49766	49766	people	523	" she says complainingly , "
49787	49788	49790	49790	he	1029	" "
49797	49807	49790	49790	he	1029	" cries Belinda , catching breathlessly at this hope . "
49816	49817	49790	49790	he	1029	" "
49822	49833	49790	49790	he	1029	" replies Sarah , putting up her hand in prohibition . "
49868	49873	49879	49879	they	1034	" Again she shudders . "
49916	50022	50025	50025	he	1029	" She stops for a few moments , and there is silence . Belinda has put her hands over her eyes , before which the ghastly sight is conjured up in its red horror . This , then , is what has robbed her of him ! This is the spectacle for which he has exchanged the spring - dressed , sun - warmed Grosse Garten . This is the errand , falsely and cruelly supposed by her to be a feigned one , which has torn him away . She shivers , and the shiver is followed by a warm rush of passionate pity . "
50041	50183	50035	50035	he	1029	" We ask ourselves and each other this senseless question , as often as an affliction a little severer than common alights upon one that is known to us ; although experience , a thousand times repeated , has taught us its folly . But below the horror and the compassion , though both are genuine , there lies in Belinda 's mind a thick , deep stratum of inexpressible relief and joy . It is explained then ! Suspense is ended ; at least for the moment it seems so . There may be a cessation of that weary sum - doing . She may think again of the wood at Wesenstein without writhing . Her past is restored to her . Surely she can live upon it until he comes back to give her a present and a future . "
50187	50192	50193	50193	I	0	" says Sarah thoughtfully . "
50202	50209	50035	50035	he	1029	" with a more cheerful air , "
50220	50234	50193	50193	I	0	" Poor man ! it was a cowardly way of cutting the knot ! "
50235	50239	50241	50241	Belinda	134	" The 25th , "
50262	50272	50193	50193	I	0	" that was the day we went to Wesenstein ! "
50273	50284	50286	50286	Sarah	135	" There is more about him — another little paragraph ! "
50292	50495	50496	50496	She	1037	" Oh , now we shall find out whom he married . ' Mr. Rivers was born on the 1st of May , 18 — ' ( Ah ! Ten and ten , twenty , and ten thirty , forty — that would make him just fifty - four)—'and was the eldest son of the late Mr. Rivers , of Denver Hall , at whose death the property was sold , in consequence of pecuniary embarrassments . ' ( Hem ! they seem to be addicted to pecuniary embarrassments . ) ' It was repurchased , five years ago , by Mr. Rivers , who had amassed a large fortune in the iron trade . He married , on the 3rd of June , 18—,the Lady Marion Lovell , third daughter of the late , and sister of the present , Earl of Eastwood ' ( bravo , David ! I knew that he was not undiluted iron ) , ' by whom he has left issue'—(a good deal of issue , I am afraid ) . ' He was an enlightened patron of agriculture , and belonged to several agricultural societies . His death will be widely and deeply deplored . ' "
50502	50507	50496	50496	She	1037	" That is all . "
50508	50511	50513	50513	Belinda	134	" All ! "
50519	50524	50513	50513	Belinda	134	" and enough too ! "
50525	50538	50496	50496	She	1037	" What a mercy for David that he was not at home ! "
50539	50546	50548	50548	Belinda	134	" He will not think so , "
50551	50566	50568	50568	Sarah	135	" He will avoid most of the horrors — coroner 's inquest and all ! "
50576	50610	50568	50568	Sarah	135	" I wonder what day the funeral was ? You could not expect him to write before that . I am afraid that now you must not hope to hear before we leave . "
50611	50620	50496	50496	She	1037	" Of course not — of course not ! "
50623	50639	50496	50496	She	1037	" Poor boy ! I do not want him to think of me at all ! "
50640	50656	50658	50658	Sarah	135	" I expect that you are the one pleasant thing he has to think about , "
50661	50668	50658	50658	Sarah	135	" I hope to heavens that the money—"stopping
50671	50697	50658	50658	Sarah	135	" Will you believe it ? There she is ! I hear her voice . She has come to tell us . Tommy , Tommy ! "
50704	50719	50658	50658	Sarah	135	" we are not at home — we are not at home to anybody . "
50858	50863	50864	50864	she	147	" Have you heard ? "
50868	50890	50864	50864	she	147	" Have you seen it ? Young Rivers ' father 's death?—suicide ? I thought you might not have seen it . "
50891	50897	50899	50899	Sarah	135	" Of course we have , "
50902	50930	50899	50899	Sarah	135	" of course we have our papers as usual . I am sorry I can not ask you to come in this morning ; we are so — "
50931	50941	50943	50944	the other	2396	" Do you think he was off his head ? "
50948	50986	50943	50944	the other	2396	" Do you think there is madness in the family ? If so , no doubt they got it from the Lovells ; there is mostly scrofula of one form or another in all those old families . "
50987	50996	50998	50998	Sarah	135	" What a comfort for the new ones ! "
51003	51016	50998	50998	Sarah	135	" Well , I am afraid that we are so busy packing — "
51017	51079	50899	50899	Sarah	135	" Were not you surprised to hear that he had married one of the Lovells ? I had not an idea that he had married one of the Lovells . He did not get a penny with her , I will answer for it ; they are as poor as Job . Eastwood is mortgaged up to the hall - door . "
51080	51094	50998	50998	Sarah	135	" Is it ? Well , as we have already heard your news , "
51103	51115	50998	50998	Sarah	135	air—"come in , Punch , or you will be shut out ! "
51116	51123	51125	51126	the other	2396	" What papers have you seen ? "
51129	51151	51125	51126	the other	2396	" I wonder is the account the same in them all . Would you mind my having a look at yours ? "
51157	51166	51125	51126	the other	2396	" Impossible ! Granny has not seen them ! "
51167	51215	50998	50998	Sarah	135	" I would lend you mine with all the pleasure in life , only that I am just going to run round with it to the Freres and Gay - hursts ; they take only the Times ; there are not so many details in the Times . "
51224	51237	51239	51240	Miss Watson	147	" Poor fellow ! it is too sad , is it not ? "
51250	51279	51242	51242	her	147	" I do not know when I have felt so cut up about anything ! I shall make a point of writing to him ; shall not you ? "
51280	51293	51295	51295	Sarah	135	" She is going to make a point of writing to him , "
51336	51369	51295	51295	Sarah	135	" It may be a bad thing to lose a father , but it is very much worse to be consoled for him by Miss Watson . By - the - bye , "
51376	51397	51295	51295	Sarah	135	" David has your address , has not he — your London address — you gave it him , eh ? "
51398	51401	51295	51295	Sarah	135	" Yes . "
51402	51405	51295	51295	Sarah	135	" Ah , "
51413	51433	51295	51295	Sarah	135	" that is all right then ! The sooner we get to England the better , for all reasons . "
52071	52075	52054	52054	Sarah	135	" Auf Wiedersehen ! "
52122	52143	52113	52114	Miss Churchill	152	" Je ne comprends pas comme on peut tant penser à une personne : n'aurai - je jamais tout pensé ? "
52526	52535	52536	52536	she	134	" Even if he came back to me , "
52541	52584	52536	52536	she	134	" even if I lived to be ninety , and saw him henceforth every day , every minute , until I die , I could never fill the emptiness of these days ; they will always have been dead , dead loss ! "
52638	52647	52648	52648	she	134	" I did well before I knew him , "
52659	52735	52648	52648	she	134	" He was in the world , and so was I ; he smiled as he does now — does he smile now , I wonder?—and I was none the worse for it . He did not blot out the sun ; he did not make it uphill work to eat , to speak , to breathe . Let things be as they were then . Why can not they be ? They shall be ! "
52931	52936	52938	52939	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Belinda is late , "
52961	52974	52976	52976	Sarah	135	" I hope she will not come back until Jane is finished , "
53004	53017	53019	53020	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Perhaps she did not find it so tiresome as she expected , "
53036	53040	53042	53042	Sarah	135	" Perhaps not , "
53071	53083	53139	53140	Mrs. Churchill	185	" What an object you are making of that poor dog ! "
53087	53092	53094	53094	Sarah	135	" She likes it ! "
53097	53129	53094	53094	Sarah	135	" She thinks it is becoming . Do not tell her it is not . If she is a success , I mean to paint the others as Harlequin and Columbine ! "
53130	53137	53139	53140	Mrs. Churchill	185	" I wish Belinda would come , "
53184	53196	53198	53198	Sarah	135	" I hope she will not come until Jane is finished ! "
53207	53216	53198	53198	Sarah	135	" I think she must have been amused . "
53217	53220	53222	53222	Sarah	135	" H'm ! "
53225	53257	53222	53222	Sarah	135	" If she is , she is the first person in whom that emotion was ever provoked by an afternoon drum ; and Belinda is not easily amused . I think , "
53262	53278	53222	53222	Sarah	135	" that Jane will amuse her . Ah , how provoking ! Here she is ! "
53334	53346	53348	53348	Sarah	135	" Do not come here ! Do not look at Jane ! "
53374	53387	53360	53360	she	135	" Stay where you are ! No ! Now you may come ! "
53388	53395	53397	53397	Belinda	134	" Which am I to do ? "
53412	53415	53417	53418	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Well ? "
53442	53445	53447	53447	Belinda	134	" Well ? "
53500	53514	53592	53592	she	134	" Eyes too expressive to be blue , Too lovely to be gray , "
53525	53538	53540	53541	Mrs. Churchill	185	" You are the worst person in the world to send out , "
53547	53564	53540	53541	Mrs. Churchill	185	" for all the news you bring back , you might as well stay at home . "
53601	53634	53592	53592	she	134	" What is there to tell ? What is there ever to tell about a drum ? There was a mob of women , and a smell of hot seal - skins ! "
53635	53643	53645	53645	Sarah	135	" Not a man , of course ? "
53670	53680	53681	53681	Belinda	134	" How glad I am I did not go ! "
53708	53716	53695	53695	she	134	" There were two or three men . "
53717	53735	53737	53737	Sarah	135	" The usual refuse that you meet in a second - class literary salon , I suppose , "
53740	53750	53737	53737	Sarah	135	" Dirty little poets , and greasy little positivists ? "
53767	53796	53751	53751	Belinda	134	" There was one man there whom you did not think too grimy to bestow a good deal of your notice upon at one period of your history . "
53797	53800	53802	53802	Sarah	135	" Who ? "
53814	53832	53802	53802	Sarah	135	" You would not be likely to meet any of my friends there , I should hope . "
53833	53836	53751	53751	Belinda	134	" Guess ! "
53837	53859	53861	53862	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Je vous le donne en trois ; je vous le donne en dix ; je vous le donne en mille ! "
53880	53913	53861	53862	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Was it — pooh ! what a memory I have — Signor Valetta , the singing - master , who went down on his knees in the middle of the lesson ? "
53914	53917	53861	53862	Mrs. Churchill	185	" No . "
53918	53944	53861	53862	Mrs. Churchill	185	" I have it ! It was the German who wrote ' Ich liebe dich ! ' on the fly - leaf of the grammar ! "
53945	53950	53951	53951	Sarah	135	" It was not ! "
53979	53991	53992	53992	she	135	" They were the nearest approach to literature I ever made , "
53996	53997	53992	53992	she	135	" except"—a
54007	54027	53992	53992	she	135	eyes—"except — no ! it could not have been ; it was not — was it — Professor Forth ? "
54028	54034	53992	53992	she	135	" It was Professor Forth . "
54035	54041	54043	54044	Mrs. Churchill	185	" How awkward for you ! "
54048	54070	54043	54044	Mrs. Churchill	185	" and of course he is not man of the world enough to carry off the gêne of such a meeting ! "
54137	54150	54152	54152	Sarah	135	" Did he speak to you ? Did you speak to him ? "
54163	54175	54152	54152	Sarah	135	" I talked to him for a good half - hour . "
54176	54185	54187	54188	Mrs. Churchill	185	" He accepted the situation , in short , "
54190	54204	54187	54188	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Well , that was more than I should have expected of him . "
54205	54217	54219	54219	Sarah	135	" Did he mention me ? Of course he mentioned me ? "
54222	54238	54152	54152	Sarah	135	" He inquired after granny ; and then he put you in as an afterthought . "
54239	54257	54259	54260	the other	2396	" I dare say that he could not command his voice to ask after me at first ? "
54264	54277	54259	54260	the other	2396	" Did his voice tremble at all ? I hope it trembled . "
54278	54285	54187	54188	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Not in the very least . "
54286	54302	54187	54188	Mrs. Churchill	185	" You talked to him for half an hour ? What did you talk about ? "
54303	54311	54259	54260	the other	2396	" We talked about Browning 's poetry . "
54312	54317	54187	54188	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Browning 's poetry ! "
54323	54342	54187	54188	Mrs. Churchill	185	" What a bore for you ! I thought that of course you would have talked about me ! "
54343	54346	54348	54348	Belinda	134	" Bore ! "
54357	54412	54348	54348	Belinda	134	" I thought it such a blessing . I did not want to talk about you , or myself either , or granny ; we are always talking about you and myself and granny . It was such a relief to get away once in a while from people , and turn to things ! "
54413	54428	54431	54432	Mrs. Churchill	185	" I must say that Browning is a great deal too clever for me , "
54435	54452	54431	54432	Mrs. Churchill	185	" I am very fond of poetry ; but I like something that I can understand . "
54453	54465	54471	54471	her	135	" But did you talk about nothing but Browning 's poetry ? "
54474	54484	54471	54471	her	135	" Did you talk about it the whole time ? "
54485	54497	54499	54499	Belinda	134	" We had hardly exhausted the subject in half an hour , "
54506	54520	54499	54499	Belinda	134	" And then he read aloud ; he was asked to read aloud ! "
54521	54529	54531	54531	Sarah	135	" And you all sat round worshipping ! "
54538	54567	54531	54531	Sarah	135	" That is exactly what they did at the house I first met him at . You may not credit it , but I sat round worshipping too ! "
54568	54574	54576	54576	Belinda	134	" They were rather fulsome ! "
54585	54605	54578	54578	her	134	" And what did he read ? Did he read anything amusing ? But of course he did not ! "
54606	54615	54627	54628	Mrs. Churchill	185	" He read ' The Grammarian 's Funeral . "
54617	54625	54627	54628	Mrs. Churchill	185	" ' The Grammarian 's Funeral ' ! "
54633	54641	54627	54628	Mrs. Churchill	185	" What a name for a poem ! "
54642	54650	54652	54652	Sarah	135	" ' The Grammarian 's Funeral ' ! "
54667	54724	54652	54652	Sarah	135	" That was the very poem he read the night I first met him . I could not make head or tail of it ; but I pretended that I thought it very fine . Belinda , beware ! or this family may have a second time cause to rue that that Grammarian ever was buried ! "
54725	54733	54735	54736	Mrs. Churchill	185	" How curious , your meeting him ! "
54745	54755	54735	54736	Mrs. Churchill	185	" How it must have reminded you of Dresden ! "
54824	54831	54833	54833	Sarah	135	" Is his mother alive still ? "
54855	54884	54847	54848	her grandmother	2703	" I hope you were not behindhand in civility ; and that as he remembered to ask after our old lady , you remembered to ask after his . "
54885	54917	54833	54833	Sarah	135	" I did not ; I thought she might be dead , but I do not think she is . He mentioned her ; he said something about ' My mother . "
54919	54928	54930	54930	Sarah	135	" Then of course she is not dead ! "
54933	54969	54930	54930	Sarah	135	" if she had been he would have said , ' My poor mother ! ' Granny , when you are dead , I mean always to talk of you as ' my poor granny ! "
54971	54979	54847	54848	her grandmother	2703	" Do you indeed , my dear ! "
54983	55001	54930	54930	Sarah	135	" Let me tell you that I have no intention of giving you the opportunity just yet . "
55002	55012	55014	55014	Sarah	135	" Did he say anything about coming to call ? "
55021	55026	55014	55014	Sarah	135	" Not a word . "
55027	55040	54930	54930	Sarah	135	" Did he give you the impression that he was contemplating it ? "
55041	55047	54930	54930	Sarah	135	" Not in the least . "
55048	55056	55014	55014	Sarah	135	" Do you think that he will ? "
55057	55089	54930	54930	Sarah	135	" I should think certainly not ; indeed he is going back to Oxbridge to - morrow . I wish I were going to Oxbridge to - morrow ! I wish , "
55092	55099	54930	54930	Sarah	135	" that we lived at Oxbridge . "
55100	55106	55108	55108	Sarah	135	" To be near him ? "
55123	55152	55112	55113	Her sister	2366	" Not exactly ; but from what he says — from what everyone says — there must be such a continual stir of intellectual life going on there . "
55153	55157	55159	55159	Sarah	135	" Good Heavens ! "
55163	55203	55159	55159	Sarah	135	" what has happened to you ? You are growing to talk just as he does ; those are the kind of things he used to say to me , and expect me to provide them with suitable answers ! "
55204	55212	55214	55214	Belinda	134	" It does sound high falutin ' , "
55219	55247	55214	55214	Belinda	134	" but it is not , really : it is only that I would give anything to get out of our own little groove into any other . "
55248	55255	55257	55257	Sarah	135	" I like our little groove , "
55260	55305	55257	55257	Sarah	135	" by - the - bye , that reminds me — Jane , where are you ? Jane , how dare you ? How can you be so indelicate as to present yourself half dressed to Punch and Slutty ? Come here this instant . "
55346	55361	55363	55363	Belinda	134	" It may not be a bad little groove for those who like it , "
55366	55399	55363	55363	Belinda	134	" but it is pleasant to get a glimpse beyond it now and then . I do not know when I have been so little bored as I have been this afternoon . "
55496	55504	55506	55506	Tommy	163	" If you please , ' m , "
55547	55560	55563	55565	a new Tommy	1106	" there is a gentleman from Higgins and Rawson in the hall . "
55608	55616	55618	55619	Mrs. Churchill	185	" A gentleman from Higgins and Rawson ! "
55622	55644	55618	55619	Mrs. Churchill	185	" there are no gentlemen at Higgins and Rawson's — it is a haberdasher 's shop ! Ask him his business . "
55898	55914	55893	55893	Tommy	163	" If you please , ' m , there is a lady with a tambourine — "
55915	55922	55924	55925	Mrs. Churchill	185	" A lady with a tambourine ! "
55932	55961	55924	55925	Mrs. Churchill	185	" What do you mean , Tommy ? Ladies do not play tambourines about the streets ! You mean a woman with a tambourine ! Send her away . "
55981	56002	55978	55978	he	163	" If you please , ' m , there is a person in the hall wishes to speak to you . "
56003	56007	56009	56010	Mrs. Churchill	185	" A person ! "
56013	56035	56009	56010	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Come , that is better ! A shopman , I suppose ! Did he say what shop had sent him ? "
56036	56079	55978	55978	he	163	" Please , ' m , I do not think he is a gentleman from — I do not think he is from a shop at all . He said his name was Forth , and asked me to give you this card "
56101	56105	56106	56106	she	185	" Good Heavens ! "
56111	56150	56106	56106	she	185	" it is Professor Forth ! What do you mean , Tommy , by calling him a ' person , ' and leaving him in the hall ? Show him up to the drawing - room at once ! "
56151	56157	56159	56159	Tommy	163	" Please , ' m , "
56163	56176	56159	56159	Tommy	163	" you said as how I was not to call 'em gentlemen . "
56177	56183	56185	56185	Sarah	135	" So he has come ! "
56206	56220	56185	56185	Sarah	135	" Do not you think he would like to see the dogs washed ? "
56221	56231	56233	56234	Mrs. Churchill	185	" I can not think what has brought him , "
56241	56299	56233	56234	Mrs. Churchill	185	" that class of people has no tact . I never could find a word to say to him . Now , pray , Sarah , do not make a fool of him again ! It is all very well for you , but you do not reflect what a nuisance he is to Belinda and me ! "
56300	56308	56310	56310	Belinda	134	" He is no nuisance to me ! "
56313	56348	56310	56310	Belinda	134	" I am glad he has come . I wanted to talk to him ! I do not think he has come to see Sarah ; I think he has come to see me ! "
56391	56419	56373	56373	she	134	" Tell him that I am coming directly , but that , with me , even Love cedes to Duty , and I must finish washing Slutty . "
56449	56458	56459	56459	he	209	" I have taken the liberty of calling , "
56468	56476	56477	56477	she	134	" I am glad to see you , "
56488	56501	56477	56477	she	134	" I wanted to talk to you . Will you sit down ? "
56794	56808	56791	56791	he	209	" I hope I have not chosen an inopportune moment for my visit ? "
56809	56818	56819	56819	she	134	" Not at all ! not at all ! "
56857	56886	56898	56898	he	209	" As I told you , I am glad to see you . I want to talk to you . Why have not you gone back to Oxbridge ? "
56887	56897	56898	56898	he	209	" I am to return by the 4.45 train , "
56901	56918	56898	56898	he	209	" and I thought that I could not better utilize the moments left me than by — "
56919	56927	56928	56928	she	134	" Yes , yes , I understand , "
56937	56975	56976	56976	He	209	" I want to ask you — I want you to tell me — I suppose that you are a competent judge — is not it quite possible for a person to live entirely by the intellect ? "
57002	57006	57007	57007	she	134	" I mean , "
57034	57037	57007	57007	she	134	heat—"I mean , "
57042	57087	57007	57007	she	134	" do not you think that that is the best life — the most satisfactory on the whole — the least liable to interruption and disappointment — that is built upon — upon — books , you know — upon the — the mind ! "
57088	57094	57095	57095	he	209	" You must be aware , "
57099	57130	57095	57095	he	209	" that the whole tendency of my teaching is to show that the pursuit of knowledge is the only one that really and abundantly rewards the labour bestowed upon it . "
57131	57136	57137	57137	she	134	" You think so ? "
57156	57179	57137	57137	she	134	" You think that it would be enough — that it would satisfy one — that one would not need anything beyond ? "
57220	57233	57234	57234	he	209	" Since there is no limit to the domain of the knowable , "
57246	57290	57240	57240	she	134	" No , no ! of course not ! I understand ! But how to get at it , that is the question ! I thought — I imagined — I hoped — that perhaps you might help me — might direct me ! "
57341	57345	57346	57346	she	134	" Of course , "
57358	57406	57346	57346	she	134	" I can not expect you to waste much time upon me ; but I thought that — that — perhaps , you might be inclined to set me on the way ; to — to — lend me a book or two every now and then . "
57407	57418	57419	57419	he	209	" I am not in the habit of lending books , "
57425	57454	57419	57419	he	209	" but I should be happy to make an exception in your favour , were I convinced that your desire for self - education were a genuine one . "
57455	57458	57459	57459	she	134	" Genuine ! "
57466	57484	57496	57496	his	209	" Why , what else should it be ? What motive could I have for feigning it ? "
57499	57506	57507	57507	he	209	" You can not have forgotten , "
57510	57520	57507	57507	he	209	" the interest in literature counterfeited by your sister — "
57559	57564	57566	57566	she	134	" How are you ? "
57654	57660	57662	57662	Belinda	134	" And about the books ? "
57680	57689	57696	57696	he	209	" You will not forget about the books ? "
57721	57728	57729	57729	he	209	" I will think of it , "
57740	57749	57729	57729	he	209	" I — I will let you know . "
57750	57755	57757	57757	Sarah	135	" What about books ? "
57770	57826	57757	57757	Sarah	135	" Is he going to lend you books ? The old villain ! it was with books that he first beguiled my young affections . I believe that he is like Jacob : not having been able to obtain Rachel , he is going to try and put up with Leah ! eh , Leah ? "
57827	57837	57839	57840	Mrs. Churchill	185	" What an untidy way he has of sitting ! "
57855	57900	57839	57840	Mrs. Churchill	185	" these loose chair - covers are a mistake . I am sure I hope that he will be in no hurry to repeat his visit . One thing is certain ; not one of us expressed the slightest wish to see him again ! "
57901	57913	57915	57915	Belinda	134	" If I did not express it , I felt it , "
57918	57926	57927	57928	Mrs. Churchill	185	" I wish to see him again . "
57979	57986	57988	57988	Sarah	135	" How curiously ugly he is ! "
57995	58077	58078	58079	Mrs. Churchill	185	" I could hardly help laughing when I looked at him . He is like Charles Lamb 's Mrs. Conrady : ' No one ever saw Mrs. Conrady without pronouncing her to be the plainest woman that he ever met with in the course of his life . The first time that you are indulged with a sight of her face is an era in your existence ever after . You are glad to have seen it — like Stonehenge ! ' "
58083	58092	58078	58079	Mrs. Churchill	185	" What a memory you have , child ! "
58093	58103	58105	58105	Sarah	135	" I can go on , if you like , "
58112	58150	58105	58105	Sarah	135	" ' No one can pretend to forget it . No one ever apologized to her for meeting her in the street on such a day and not knowing her ; the pretext would be too bare . "
58152	58160	58162	58162	Belinda	134	" You have always grossly underrated him , "
58165	58185	58162	58162	Belinda	134	" there is a side of him , an intellectual side , which you are totally incapable of appreciating ! "
58186	58189	58191	58192	her sister	2366	" Totally ! "
58195	58205	58191	58192	her sister	2366	" and so , I hoped , were you ! "
58206	58216	58218	58218	Belinda	134	" At least I know that it is there ! "
58252	58269	58191	58192	her sister	2366	" I recognize it ; I admit it ; I would imitate it if I could ! "
58270	58274	58276	58276	Sarah	135	" Since when ? "
58295	58301	58302	58302	she	135	" It is very hard , "
58308	58356	58357	58357	She	135	" that one should be thrown back and ridiculed here , when one makes any least effort to improve one 's self ! What is the use of making any attempt in such an atmosphere as this ? What is the use of struggling — of trying — "
58368	58375	58377	58378	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Her temper is becoming impossible ! "
58394	58398	58390	58390	Sarah	135	" Poor dear ! "
58858	58865	58844	58844	her	134	house—"Of what use ? what use ? "
59158	59164	59151	59151	She	134	" I expected you yesterday . "
59165	59179	59180	59180	he	136	" I was detained by a College meeting , and by other engagements , "
59183	59187	59180	59180	he	136	" I hope , "
59190	59203	59180	59180	he	136	" that you were not inconvenienced by the deferring of my visit ? "
59204	59208	59209	59209	she	134	" I was , "
59213	59232	59234	59234	her	134	" As it happened , I wanted you badly . I was completely puzzled by a passage here , "
59241	59246	59234	59234	her	134	" Cæsar 's Commentaries . "
59247	59260	59264	59264	she	134	" I worried over it till I felt quite dazed and woolly . "
59319	59329	59330	59330	she	134	" It is hopeless to make any real progress , "
59334	59364	59330	59330	she	134	" as long as our lessons are so interrupted . How much better it would be if we lived in Oxbridge ! How I wish we lived in Oxbridge ! "
59465	59474	59475	59475	she	134	" It would make things so much easier , "
59486	59509	59475	59475	she	134	" If I were in difficulties I could go straight to you . I had much rather live in Oxbridge than here . "
59522	59530	59531	59531	she	134	" It must be a good life ! "
59548	59569	59531	59531	she	134	" so full of intelligent interests , so absorbing , and must take one so out of one 's self ! "
59645	59656	59657	59657	he	1148	" If you are sincere in your desire for a — "
59670	59673	59674	59674	she	134	" Sincere ! "
59682	59709	59674	59674	she	134	" I can not imagine why you preface all your remarks with a doubt of my sincerity ! What could I possibly gain by being insincere ? "
59739	59751	59752	59752	he	1148	" If my phrase offends you , I will change it ! "
59756	59767	59752	59752	he	1148	" Since you are sincere in your desire for a — "
59784	59789	59790	59790	he	1148	" You have visitors , "
59798	59804	59790	59790	he	1148	" We shall be interrupted . "
59805	59812	59813	59813	she	134	" No , we shall not , "
59820	59837	59817	59817	her	134	" Tommy knows that when you are here , I am not at home to anyone . "
59884	59889	59952	59952	she	134	" Please go on , "
59893	59905	59952	59952	she	134	" Since I am sincere in my desire for — what ? "
59920	59929	59930	59930	he	1148	" Your servant must have mistaken your directions , "
59938	59946	59930	59930	he	1148	" he is evidently admitting some one . "
59959	59966	59967	59967	she	134	" If we were at Dresden , "
59976	59996	59967	59967	she	134	" and if I did not hope that it were impossible , I should say that the voice was — "
60002	60007	60009	60010	Miss Watson	147	" Here I am ! "
60089	60102	60104	60104	she	134	" I knew by Tommy 's manner that you were at home ! "
60107	60149	60104	60104	she	134	" By - the - bye , he is a new Tommy ! What have you done with the old one ? I would not give him my card ; I said , ' No , I will surprise them ! ' "
60184	60190	60192	60193	Miss Watson	147	" Mr. Forth , too ! "
60200	60225	60192	60193	Miss Watson	147	" Why , this is Dresden over again ! If we had but Sarah and Rivers here , we might think ourselves back there . "
60292	60298	60300	60301	the visitor	1164	" How snug you are ! "
60307	60356	60300	60301	the visitor	1164	" but why do you sit here ? Why do not you sit in the drawing - room ? Is not the fire lit there ? Oh , I suppose Sarah sits there , and grandmamma ? I must go and pay them a little visit just now . "
60357	60362	60368	60369	the other	2396	" They are out . "
60363	60366	60368	60369	the other	2396	" Out ! "
60373	60407	60368	60369	the other	2396	" Sarah is always out . I wish they would come back ! How soon do you expect them ? We should be just our Dresden party , then — all but Rivers ! "
60438	60449	60451	60452	Miss Watson	147	" Shocking thing about his father , was it not ? "
60467	60531	60451	60452	Miss Watson	147	" Failed for over a million , and cut his throat . They say that he has left his large family — twelve ? ten ? nine?—how many used young Rivers to tell us there were of them?—upon the parish . But I do not believe it ; one hears of people bankrupt one day , and rolling in their carriages the next . "
60613	60622	60623	60623	she	134	" Does Mr. Rivers roll in his carriage ? "
60675	60686	60692	60692	her	147	" I do not know about rolling in his carriage , "
60700	60756	60692	60692	her	147	" I know that he can treat himself to stalls at the theatre , which is more than I can . I always go to the dress circle ; one 's legs are a little cramped in the front row , but one can see as well as in the best place in the house . "
60785	60794	60795	60795	she	134	" Did you see him at the play ? "
60799	60812	60814	60815	Miss Watson	147	" I saw him the other night at the St. James 's , "
60827	60870	60820	60820	her	147	" What are you looking for ? have you lost anything ? No?—At the St. James . ' The Squire ' — have you seen it ? it is so well put on the stage — Mrs. Kendal quite at her best ! "
60871	60878	60880	60880	Belinda	134	" I — I think not , "
60883	60900	60880	60880	Belinda	134	" I mean no ; I — I have not seen it . You were saying — "
60901	60907	60909	60909	her	147	" What was I saying ? "
60919	60963	60880	60880	Belinda	134	movements)—"you must have lost something ! — oh ! that I had seen young Rivers at the play . He was in the stalls with a lady — his sister , we will presume — though she was not at all like him , "
60969	60985	60880	60880	Belinda	134	" If she was on the parish , it managed to dress her uncommonly well ! "
61159	61172	61311	61312	the other	2396	" I tried to get to him as we were going out , "
61178	61195	61174	61175	Miss Watson	147	" I saw him on ahead with his lady . He is a most attentive brother ! "
61204	61283	61174	61175	Miss Watson	147	" he was wrapping her up like a mummy ! But though I made a great push for it I could not come up with him ; there was such a crowd . I never saw a fuller house . I called out to him , and once I thought he had heard , for he looked round and caught my eye ; but it could not have been so , for he posted on faster than before ! "
61300	61309	61311	61312	the other	2396	" Have not you seen anything of him ? "
61328	61381	61325	61325	her	2396	" has not he been to call — not once ? I must tell him that there is a hole in his manners ; I shall be sure to fall in with him again before long , and I will send him here . I will tell him that you expect him . "
61382	61387	61389	61389	Belinda	134	" You will not , "
61400	61404	61389	61389	Belinda	134	" I mean , "
61426	61452	61325	61325	her	2396	face—"I mean that I think I had rather you did not . If he wishes to call , he — he — knows our address . "
61519	61533	61535	61536	Mrs. Churchill	185	" This is what we are to expect for the next five months ! "
61702	61707	61709	61710	Mrs. Churchill	185	" What a climate ! "
61715	61732	61709	61710	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Good heavens , Sarah , why do you let Jane make such a dreadful noise ? "
61815	61835	61837	61839	the old lady	2704	" How anyone that can help it spends the winter in England , is more than I can imagine ! "
61847	61859	61837	61839	the old lady	2704	" If we were rid of Belinda we would go abroad . "
61860	61871	61837	61839	the old lady	2704	" Why should not Belinda go too ? — No , "
61885	61895	61837	61839	the old lady	2704	" dead ! dead ! head down ! dead ! "
61896	61907	61837	61839	the old lady	2704	" I could not possibly afford it ; and besides , "
61912	61927	61837	61839	the old lady	2704	" she would spoil the whole thing ; she is such a wet blanket . "
61928	61942	61944	61944	Sarah	135	" Everybody can not be always on the grin like you and me , "
61949	61957	61959	61960	Mrs. Churchill	185	" We would go to the South , "
61994	62034	62035	62035	her	185	" we would have a week in Paris , and go to the play every night . I must see Judic in this new piece . We would run over to Monaco and try our luck . If only , "
62045	62055	62035	62035	her	185	" if only Belinda were out of the way ! "
62239	62245	62247	62247	Sarah	135	" Are you going out ? "
62280	62283	62258	62258	she	135	" Yes . "
62284	62289	62247	62247	Sarah	135	" To - day ? "
62292	62295	62247	62247	Sarah	135	" Yes . "
62296	62299	62258	62258	she	135	" Alone ? "
62300	62303	62258	62258	she	135	" Yes . "
62304	62307	62247	62247	Sarah	135	" Walking ? "
62308	62311	62247	62247	Sarah	135	" No . "
62312	62317	62258	62258	she	135	" In a hansom ? "
62318	62321	62247	62247	Sarah	135	" Yes . "
62322	62328	62330	62330	Sarah	135	" Where are you going ? "
62347	62360	62247	62247	Sarah	135	" I am going to the National Gallery to meet Mr. Forth . "
62361	62374	62258	62258	she	135	" To the National Gallery ? why can not he come here ? "
62375	62393	62395	62395	Belinda	134	" Because , unfortunately , there is hardly so fine a collection of pictures here as there , "
62398	62413	62395	62395	Belinda	134	" He wishes to show me a particular picture of the early Italian school . "
62421	62426	62427	62427	she	135	" Do not go ! "
62437	62461	62427	62427	she	135	" I am sure his picture is as little worth seeing as himself . Let him wait . Come back to the fire . "
62475	62495	62496	62496	she	134	" I am glad to be — for at all events a couple of hours—'out of the way , ' "
62900	62933	62934	62934	she	134	" I am very glad of what you say as to personal affection having no part in your motives for asking me to marry you . You do not want — love , "
62945	62961	62934	62934	she	134	" and I have none to give ; so at all events we start fair . "
62971	62985	62986	62986	he	2365	" I distrust , and have cause for distrusting , professions of affection , "
63043	63063	62996	62996	his	2365	" All that I ask , all that I wish to obtain , is an intelligent , sympathetic companion . "
63064	63067	63068	63068	she	134	" Sympathetic ! "
63072	63119	63068	63068	she	134	" I am not sympathetic ; I should be deceiving you if I were to let you suppose that I am . No ! let us be sure that we understand each other ; I have as little sympathy to give as I have — love ! "
63125	63128	63129	63129	he	1227	" Possibly ! "
63144	63207	63129	63129	he	1227	" on my side , I think it right to tell you of what you may perhaps be already aware , that the press of my occupations and the condition of my health forbid my indulging in many amusements enjoyed by other persons , but from which I shall be compelled to require you , as well as myself , to abstain . "
63208	63215	63217	63217	Belinda	134	" I do not want amusements ! "
63220	63239	63240	63240	His	1227	" amusements do not amuse me . I want occupation ; can you give me plenty of that ? "
63248	63276	63240	63240	His	1227	" I think I can promise you that in the life you will share with me , you will find no lack of that . My mother — "
63277	63281	63283	63283	Belinda	134	" Your mother ! "
63286	63293	63283	63283	Belinda	134	" she is still alive then ? "
63294	63302	63304	63304	he	1227	" She is still spared to me , "
63343	63350	63311	63311	his	1227	" one parent from the skies . "
63351	63358	63360	63360	Belinda	134	" She must be very old , "
63379	63387	63376	63376	He	1227	" She is somewhat advanced in years . "
63437	63441	63442	63442	she	134	" Is she — "
63492	63496	63442	63442	she	134	" Is she — "
63506	63509	63442	63442	she	134	" doting , "
63510	63513	63442	63442	she	134	" imbecile , "
63514	63517	63442	63442	she	134	" off her head"—she
63528	63531	63442	63442	she	134	" Is she "
63539	63547	63548	63548	He	1219	" in full possession of her faculties ? "
63553	63559	63548	63548	He	1219	" She is somewhat deaf . "
63560	63566	63442	63442	she	134	" Is her sight good ? "
63567	63578	63548	63548	He	1219	" I regret to say that it is almost gone . "
63579	63589	63591	63591	Belinda	134	" But she keeps her faculties ? her mind ? "
63594	63603	63604	63604	he	1219	" Her intellect is not what it was ! "
63655	63664	63665	63665	he	1219	" My mother 's bodily health is excellent , "
63669	63701	63665	63665	he	1219	" I only wish that my own constitution were half as vigorous as hers ; but her infirmities are such as to need a great deal of loving care : more , "
63706	63718	63665	63665	he	1219	" than I am able to spare from my own avocations ! "
63743	63753	63754	63754	she	134	" I am not naturally fond of old people , "
63758	63816	63754	63754	she	134	" I have been very little thrown with them ; the only old person whom I know intimately , granny , is a great deal younger in herself than I am . I will be as kind as I can to your mother ; but that is not the sort of occupation I meant . I meant , "
63839	63853	63833	63833	she	134	" I meant something that would fill the mind — some hard study ! "
63854	63877	63878	63878	he	1232	" There is nothing that I am aware of to prevent your pursuing any line of study you may choose to select , "
63883	63901	63903	63903	she	134	" And you think that the taste — the zest for it will certainly come — certainly ? "
63906	63950	63952	63952	Sarah	135	" Did you ever know a case of its failing ? I must not deceive you ; it has not come to me yet ; I take no pleasure in learning ; I think that I have as little real aptitude for study as "
63963	63983	63954	63954	she	135	time)—"as the veriest dunce . But you think that I shall succeed if I persevere , do not you ? "
64003	64020	63952	63952	Sarah	135	" that perseverance must bring success to anyone , however moderately bright . I know , of course"—humbly—"that
64030	64031	64032	64032	You	134	" "
64039	64044	64032	64032	You	134	" he answers drily ; "
64056	64057	63999	63999	her	134	" "
64064	64127	63999	63999	her	134	" she rejoins , meekly acquiescing in this lover - like expression of partiality ; and then there is silence again . It is broken by Professor Forth . It would not have been broken by Belinda . She is dreamily walking again along Hobbema 's straight Dutch road . Would the village be at all like Wesenstein when you reached it ? "
64131	64136	64128	64128	I	0	" he says ceremoniously , "
64185	64186	64188	64188	she	1233	" "
64190	64206	64207	64207	she	1233	" answers Belinda , leaping back from dreamland , and breaking into a hard laugh ; "
64217	64218	64207	64207	she	1233	" "
64225	64243	64245	64245	she	1233	" says he , with that same slight resentful difficulty which he always finds in mentioning Sarah ; "
64257	64258	64245	64245	she	1233	" "
64267	64272	64245	64245	she	1233	" answers Belinda slowly . "
64308	64325	64326	64326	I	0	" looking up and speaking with a quick animation that contrasts with her late sarcastic indifference , "
64346	64351	64338	64338	You	1236	" she adds naïvely , "
64359	64360	64361	64361	I	0	" "
64369	64377	64361	64361	I	0	" he answers with an arid smile , "
64402	64403	64338	64338	You	1236	" "
64408	64419	64338	64338	You	1236	" she answers carelessly , passing by his stiff politesse ; "
64439	64569	64427	64427	I	0	" She speaks with the same unemotional business air as if she were concluding the purchase of a piece of land , or of some yards of cloth . The room is , at the moment , empty of anyone but themselves . It is near closing - time , and the sparse visitors are trailing off . There is nothing to hinder a lover - like parting embrace between the two persons who have just engaged to pass their lives together . But the possibility of this never once crosses Belinda 's mind , not even when her newlybetrothed steps a pace nearer to her , and says , in a voice through which rather more of human emotion than she has ever before heard in it pierces : "
64586	64587	64570	64570	You	1237	" "
64591	64606	64570	64570	You	1237	" she asks , piercing him with the direct look of her icy eyes . "
64651	64655	64656	64656	I	0	" laughing harshly . "
64666	64683	64684	64684	I	0	" To such a speech , what rejoinder is there to make ? He makes none . "
64692	64710	64729	64729	You	1237	" she says , in the same cool , matter - of - fact tone as before ; "
64765	64899	64900	64900	Granny	156	" As they emerge from the building they find that rain is falling , a sleety rain to which the undecided snow has turned . It beats in her face as she walks down the steps ; she does not take the trouble to run in order to escape it ; she would as soon be wet as dry . It drives in upon her even in the hansom , where she has refused to allow the glass to be lowered . One can get very fairly well soaked in a hansom if one goes the right way to work . And all along sleety Pall Mall , all the sleety way home , she is pestered with the sight , the smell , almost the feel , of the wood at Wesenstein ! "
64902	64944	64900	64900	Granny	156	" says Belinda , entering the drawing - room , walking straight up to Mrs. Churchill and standing before her , not allowing her attention to be distracted even by the wagging of three kind tails , distinctly addressed to her . "
64979	65047	65049	65049	you	0	" Mrs. Churchill lifts her eyes , in which is none of their usual frisky light , and fixes them coldly on her tall young granddaughter , standing pale and severe before her . She has always thought Belinda too tall ; it strikes her more forcibly than ever now , as she sees her towering majestically above her . Belinda is too everything , except amusing . "
65062	65231	65049	65049	you	0	" she asks sarcastically . Mrs. Churchill is not in her playfullest mood , by which , almost as much as by her large lawn caps , she is known to an admiring public . The weather ; the fact that several tiresome and not one pleasant person have been to call ; the consciousness of guilt towards Belinda — a consciousness not quite stifled indeed , but diverted into the channel of anger by the smart , and in fact unmeasured rebukes she has had to submit to from Sarah — all , all combine to rob her of her usual suavity . Sarah 's rebukes , indeed , would have led to a quarrel could she afford to quarrel with Sarah , but she can not . Upon her hangs too much of the ease and diversion of her life . But there is no such motive to prevent her quarrelling with Belinda , and she feels that to do so would be a pleasant relief . "
65235	65248	65049	65049	you	0	" repeats Belinda , with a momentary want of comprehension ; then , "
65269	65270	65272	65272	you	0	" "
65282	65289	65272	65272	you	0	" suggests the old lady ironically . "
65297	65327	65290	65290	You	0	" answers the girl curtly , sitting down as she speaks and beginning to unfasten her cloak , whose warmth the hot and scented room begins to make oppressive . "
65335	65382	65383	65383	You	0	" cries the old lady , jumping actively up , and running towards her ; ennui , ill - humour , and sarcasm together racing away out of her voice , and making place both in it and in her sparkling eyes for a delightful excitement . "
65411	65412	65405	65405	I	0	" "
65422	65427	65405	65405	I	0	" interrupts Belinda coldly . "
65449	65450	65451	65451	I	0	" "
65481	65526	65469	65469	I	0	" running swiftly over in her mind the list of Belinda 's somewhat shadowy admirers , all of them kept so rigorously at bay that it would have seemed impossible that any one of them could have approached within sight of love - making . "
65532	65587	65529	65530	Professor Forth	136	" Mrs. Churchill 's jaws drop ; the dimpling smiles — she still has the remnants of an old dimple or two — vanish from her cheek . For several moments she is totally incapable of speech ; and even at the end of them is only able to gasp out the incoherent words : "
65601	65602	65593	65593	you	136	" "
65608	65613	65618	65618	him	136	" says Belinda quietly , "
65643	65644	65634	65634	I	0	" "
65648	65663	65645	65646	Professor Forth	136	" repeats Mrs. Churchill , gradually but slowly regaining the possession of her senses . "
65687	65688	65689	65689	I	0	" "
65700	65712	65689	65689	I	0	" rejoins Belinda , still with that pallid composure of hers . "
65732	65733	65734	65734	Husband	247	" "
65735	65769	65780	65780	I	0	" she is going to say , but something in the employ of the word in such a connection strikes her as shocking and impossible . She leaves her sentence for ever unfinished . "
65783	65792	65780	65780	I	0	" rejoins Mrs. Churchill with a cynical shrug . "
65809	65891	65803	65803	yours	136	" asks Sarah playfully , coming suddenly into the room , rubbing her little cold hands and approaching her grandmother with a conciliatory air . She feels a vague relief in seeing that Belinda is at home again . Neither answers ; Belinda , because she has no wish to rob her grandmother of the pleasure of communicating her piece of intelligence ; Mrs. Churchill , because a remnant of hurt dignity ties the tongue which she is longing to unloose . "
65901	65918	65803	65803	yours	136	" repeats Sarah more sharply , glancing suspiciously from one to the other as she speaks . "
65922	65935	65920	65920	Belinda	134	" replies the elder woman , unable any longer to refrain herself . "
65970	65971	65962	65963	Professor Forth	136	" "
65976	65986	65987	65987	Belinda	134	" cries Sarah loudly and angrily , turning scarlet . "
65989	66001	65987	65987	Belinda	134	" taking her sister by the shoulder and rudely shaking her , "
66062	66063	66045	66045	You	136	" "
66071	66109	66045	66045	You	136	" asks Belinda , turning her lovely cold face and her gloomy eyes up towards Sarah . The latter 's hand drops nerveless from her sister 's shoulder , and she steps back a pace or two . "
66115	66121	66045	66045	You	136	" she says , horrified . "
66139	66144	66130	66130	you	136	" returns Belinda drily ; "
66154	66155	66147	66147	I	0	" "
66161	66167	66147	66147	I	0	" cries the other violently ; "
66189	66190	66178	66178	I	0	" "
66196	66215	66192	66192	we	1258	" says Belinda , slowly rising , and walking with her cloak over her arm to the door , "
66230	66242	66228	66228	granny	721	" turning as she reaches it and calmly facing them both , "
66262	66263	66244	66244	I	0	" "
66272	66297	66266	66266	she	57	" cries Mrs. Churchill peevishly ; the more peevishly for the pricks that her conscience , albeit a tough one , is giving her . "
66304	66322	66301	66301	your	721	" says Sarah morosely , viciously rattling the fire - irons and boxing the dogs ' ears ; "
66339	66340	66336	66336	you	721	" "
66343	66349	66336	66336	you	721	" replies the other crossly ; "
66367	66375	66376	66376	I	0	" with a little pious parental air , "
66426	66435	66412	66412	she	57	" the natural frisky light reilluming her eyes , "
66457	66668	66669	66669	I	0	" The morrow has come . Mrs. Churchill has risen refreshed and healthful from pleasing dreams of sunshine and lansquenet . Sarah has tossed between vexed visions and unwonted wakefulness . And Belinda ? Belinda makes no complaint of her night . She looks older than when she went to bed , but the cold is pinching , and for the last year and a half she has been perceptibly ageing . The morrow has come , and the Professor . To - day he is not ushered into the little dark back - room , but is led by a full - buttoned pompous Tommy into the drawing - room , where his grandmother elect sits ready and alone to receive him . Perhaps they have not a great deal to say to each other . At all events the interval is short before the bell is rung and a message given to request Miss Churchill to come down . She is sitting in her little chilly bedroom , her cheek pressed against the window - pane and her eyes idly following the dirty sparrows on the leads . Without a moment 's lingering , she obeys . As she enters the room her betrothed advances to meet her . "
66679	66688	66669	66669	I	0	" he says in his stiff Donnish voice , "
66708	66709	66698	66698	she	1233	" "
66718	66723	66710	66710	I	0	" replies Belinda calmly ; "
66732	66761	66727	66727	she	1233	" The words are simple and simply spoken , with no special stress or significant accent laid upon them ; and yet under them the old lady winces . "
66771	66776	66727	66727	she	1233	" she says sharply ; "
66852	66856	66844	66844	you	0	" Belinda shivers . "
66866	66882	66899	66902	a mariage de raison	1267	" she says , breathing quick and short , and in a concentrated low voice ; "
66922	66932	66933	66934	Mrs. Churchill	185	" appealing to him with abrupt and uncompromising directness . "
66943	66948	66941	66941	yourself	185	" he replies pettishly , "
66962	66963	66933	66934	Mrs. Churchill	185	" "
66976	67015	66966	66966	I	0	" cries Mrs. Churchill rather hastily , gathering up her work and making for the door ; eluding , as she has made a golden rule of doing through life , any scene that threatened to be disagreeable . "
67028	67060	67025	67026	Mr. Forth	209	" Nodding and smiling , she withdraws ; and the dogs , with their usual fine tact , follow her — all but Jane . As soon as she is gone : "
67064	67087	67061	67061	I	0	" says Belinda , fixing her joyless , unbashful eyes full upon him — eyes with enough coldness in them to freeze a volcano—"that
67103	67104	67094	67094	you	0	" "
67120	67132	67105	67105	I	0	" he answers snappishly . His snappishness does not infect her . "
67157	67195	67196	67196	I	0	" she answers earnestly . He has drawn near his usual magnet , the fire , and is chafing his bloodless hands over it . Perhaps this is the reason why he expresses neither assent nor dissent . "
67206	67218	67196	67196	I	0	" she says , still in that same deeply earnest voice , "
67257	67270	67271	67272	Many men	1271	" letting fall each slow word with a weight of heavy emphasis . "
67295	67307	67308	67308	I	0	" The person she is addressing moves uneasily in his chair . "
67311	67316	67308	67308	I	0	" he says fretfully , "
67326	67327	67308	67308	I	0	" "
67336	67341	67328	67328	We	1274	" she answers persistently . "
67413	67447	67448	67448	I	0	" A certain sound of fidgeting from the chair so chillily drawn close to the hearth betrays that there is something in this catalogue of his infirmities not altogether agreeable to its occupant . "
67457	67470	67477	67477	you	0	" continues Belinda , with an unconscious accent of self - pity ; "
67482	67495	67477	67477	you	0	" appealing to him with that hopeless , cold gentleness of hers . "
67524	67660	67510	67510	you	0	" As she finishes speaking she draws nearer to him , and holds out her young soft hand , as if to seal with it this frosty bargain . He takes it formally , but does not press it any more than he had pressed her grandmother 's . Perhaps he has no inclination . Perhaps he dares not . Belinda sits down opposite to him ; the light from the window , such as it is , falling full on her face ; her hands folded in her lap , and her eyes looking straight before her . There is something so odd and strained in her attitude that Jane , wellmeaning but injudicious , goes up to her and rubs her long nose and her pinkrimmed eyes against her knees to cheer her . "
67674	67692	67510	67510	you	0	" says Mr. Forth , in a key in which a slight tinge of umbrage is perceptible , "
67740	67808	67809	67809	You	1279	" During the whole of his last sentence she has felt him watching her narrowly . Is this the touchstone that he is applying to her sincerity ? Does he expect her to turn as dishonestly restive as Sarah had obviously done whenever any suggestion of a like nature had been made to her ? The idea crosses her mind with a sort of thin fugitive amusement . "
67815	67820	67813	67813	granny	721	" she answers coldly ; "
67835	67864	67821	67821	you	1279	" There is such an evident good faith , such an entire absence of all desire of evasion in her look and tone , that his scrutiny relaxes . "
67872	67876	67821	67821	you	1279	" she says ; "
67884	67926	67927	67927	I	0	" In her tone is such a flat , tame hopelessness that Jane redoubles her rubbing against her knees , and accompanies it with an acute , short bark . If that will not put her in spirits , nothing will . "
67933	67938	67927	67927	I	0	" pursues Mr. Forth , "
67956	67957	67927	67927	I	0	" "
67961	67966	67967	67967	I	0	" she asks brusquely ; "
67999	68000	68008	68008	I	0	" "
68011	68020	68008	68008	I	0	" he answers , in an annoyed tone , "
68039	68040	68008	68008	I	0	" "
68049	68058	68008	68008	I	0	" breaks in she with a bitter laugh . "
68080	68091	68070	68070	you	1279	" He is silent , but his face expresses vexation . "
68098	68103	68070	68070	you	1279	" continues Belinda coolly ; "
68140	68175	68124	68124	they	1285	" But even now Professor Forth does not immediately answer . Perhaps this mode of treating the question of an approaching marriage seems to him even more bafling than Sarah 's . At last : "
68183	68196	68181	68181	me	0	" he says slowly , and without any perceptible exhilaration of tone , "
68207	68208	68181	68181	me	0	" "
68216	68260	68181	68181	me	0	" repeats she flatly . It seems as if in this phrase there were a dismal charm for her . Again there is a pause , during which Belinda 's eyes rest upon her betrothed 's face with a look of cold expectancy . "
68266	68272	68262	68262	I	0	" he begins at length , "
68298	68299	68283	68283	I	0	" "
68306	68357	68283	68283	I	0	" asks Belinda curtly . He looks at her in unfeigned astonishment . In this family is he to experience no medium between disingenuous procrastination and unmaidenly haste ? Belinda sees and interprets his look , but her eyes do not fall ; her cheeks do not colour beneath it . "
68366	68384	68283	68283	I	0	" she says , with a sort of restlessness for a moment ruffling her hitherto deathly calm , "
68400	68401	68402	68402	I	0	" "
68405	68418	68402	68402	I	0	" he says , in a perplexed and not particularly pleased voice , "
68455	68456	68473	68473	you	0	" "
68459	68468	68473	68473	you	0	" she interrupts almost rudely , breathing quick . "
68479	68487	68473	68473	you	0	" with an accent of indescribable shrinking . "
68505	68506	68507	68507	I	0	" "
68511	68516	68473	68473	you	0	" he answers stiffly , "
68557	68567	68534	68536	my medical man	1288	" She is silent for a moment ; then : "
68571	68576	68534	68536	my medical man	1288	" she says grudgingly , "
68608	68609	68610	68610	He	1288	" "
68620	68654	68610	68610	He	1288	" cries Sarah , in an exhilarated voice , running into the drawing - room ; after having been hanging perilously far over the upper banisters unseen , to speed the parting guest . "
68693	68694	68695	68695	I	0	" "
68709	68752	68753	68753	He	1288	" replies Belinda drily . She had risen to bid her betrothed goodbye , and yet stands . She is holding her cold right hand , which still seems to feel the chill impress of his frosty handshake , to the fire . "
68763	68770	68771	68771	you	0	" continues Sarah , hurrying up ; "
68800	68811	68795	68795	I	0	" with a glance of indignant admiration at her sister , "
68849	68855	68795	68795	I	0	" with an eager stress . "
68860	68885	68795	68795	I	0	" replies Belinda , with as icy a composure as if her lover 's bloodless eld were infectious , and she had caught it ; "
68891	68918	68795	68795	I	0	" In her hasty entrance Sarah had left the door ajar , and through it her grandmother now enters ; having apparently overheard the last words . "
68923	68932	68937	68937	you	134	" repeats she , with her eyes dancing ; "
68954	68955	68937	68937	you	134	" "
68963	68993	68937	68937	you	134	" replies Belinda curtly , turning away her dull face from her beaming questioner , and speaking in a key , if possible , yet more frozen than before . "
68997	69023	69028	69028	You	134	" repeats Mrs. Churchill , in a tone into which she honestly , if not very successfully , tries to infuse a tinge of regret ; "
69037	69038	69028	69028	You	134	" "
69046	69056	69028	69028	You	134	" replies Belinda , mechanically repeating her dreary formula . "
69069	69085	69086	69086	We	1291	" continues Mrs. Churchill , growing pink with pleasure , and her old dimple reappearing . "
69127	69128	69118	69118	she	249	" "
69136	69146	69118	69118	she	249	" replies Belinda , with a bitter small smile . "
69154	69155	69118	69118	she	249	" "
69169	69181	69113	69113	she	249	" says Mrs. Churchill , with a disappointed refrigeration of tone ; "
69200	69236	69190	69190	You	134	" A flash of hope has come into Sarah 's sunny eyes as she looks eagerly at her sister ; but at the expression of that sister 's face it at once dies down again . "
69242	69247	69190	69190	You	134	" says Belinda quietly , "
69272	69273	69304	69304	your	134	" "
69278	69294	69295	69295	you	134	" repeats Mrs. Churchill , hiding a look of conscious guilt under a fretful air ; "
69314	69315	69311	69311	your	134	" "
69328	69340	69322	69322	I	0	" replies . Belinda , with a look of imperative decision . "
69353	69362	69322	69322	I	0	" says Sarah , with an annoyed laugh ; "
69368	69369	69322	69322	I	0	" "
69372	69377	69378	69378	I	0	" echoes Belinda impatiently ; "
69384	69385	69378	69378	I	0	" "
69389	69395	69378	69378	I	0	" says Mrs. Churchill sarcastically , "
69420	69421	69378	69378	I	0	" "
69440	69466	69433	69433	you	134	" There is an aghast silence . Sarah and Mrs. Churchill look at one another . Something in their interchange of glances grates upon Belinda . "
69472	69501	69433	69433	you	134	" she says , exchanging her icy calm voice for one of excessive irritability , such irritability as of late her family has been too well acquainted with , "
69581	69648	69650	69650	you	1299	" She repeats it over and over again , as if to reassure herself by the strength and number of her own repetitions , and looks round at her two auditors , as if daring them to oppose any contradiction to her assertion . Neither of them does . It is , indeed , some moments before either of them finds anything to say . Then — "
69659	69665	69650	69650	you	1299	" asks Mrs. Churchill drily . "
69668	69673	69650	69650	you	1299	" replies Belinda excitedly ; "
69706	69707	69697	69697	he	136	" "
69716	69722	69708	69708	He	136	" says Mrs. Churchill sarcastically . "
69731	69760	69761	69761	I	0	" replies Belinda , still more excitedly , looking round with angry suspicion in search of the ridicule which she dimly feels may attach to her last utterance . "
69786	69797	69772	69773	two people	1302	" Mrs. Churchill turns away to conceal an ungovernable smile . "
69804	69813	69772	69773	two people	1302	" repeats Sarah , with a disgusted accent ; "
69849	70029	69840	69840	I	0	" The winter advances ; Christmas comes ; comes , as it not infrequently now comes to the world 's greatest city , in an almost total darkness ; a choking yellow darkness . The gas has to be lit at ten o'clock in the morning . Drearily it flares , from the imperceptible dawn until the undiscriminated night . Under its and the fog 's pestilent breaths the flowers in the stands wither ; the carefully - cherished puny ferns shrink away into death . Through the suffocating obscurity the church bells ring muffled ; the cabs crawl cautiously at a foot 's pace , and the omnibuses cease to run . None of the Churchill family have been able to get to church ; and either by that fact or by the fog their spirits and tempers are sensibly worsened . Mrs. Churchill likes to go to church on Christmas Day ; it is a sort of fetish , the loss of which may entail disadvantage upon her , either in this world or in the next . "
70050	70117	70184	70184	you	0	" cries she , taking up her old cry , and pettishly clicking together the clasps of the prayer - book , in which she has been reading the lessons for the day . Sarah , her only companion , makes no reply ; not that she is absorbed in any occupation , but because the remark appears to her to be both old and worthless . "
70134	70152	70119	70119	I	0	" continues the elder woman , seeing that she may wait in vain for a sympathetic response . "
70162	70168	70169	70169	she	134	" in an exasperated voice ; "
70216	70217	70203	70203	she	134	" "
70231	70236	70237	70237	I	0	" replies Sarah surlily . "
70253	70259	70260	70260	I	0	" rejoins Mrs. Churchill crossly ; "
70315	70316	70317	70317	You	0	" "
70321	70335	70317	70317	You	0	" replies Sarah undutifully , her soft round face growing dogged and hard ; "
70361	70362	70346	70346	I	0	" "
70365	70371	70346	70346	I	0	" repeats Mrs. Churchill angrily ; "
70403	70404	70407	70407	you	0	" "
70421	70426	70414	70414	you	0	" asks Sarah cynically ; "
70488	70489	70490	70490	He	1306	" "
70502	70521	70492	70500	a man not without distinction in his own line	1313	" pursues Mrs. Churchill , affecting not to have heard her grand - daughter 's last ironical suggestion ; "
70554	70558	70537	70537	He	1306	" hesitating for an encomium—"of
70621	70622	70598	70598	you	0	" "
70635	70645	70598	70598	you	0	" retorts Sarah obstinately , marching towards the door , "
70677	70689	70671	70671	You	0	" firing a defiant parting shot from the door - way , "
70703	70841	70691	70691	I	0	" She is as good as her word . She finds Belinda where she knew that she would find her , in her little back sitting - room , but not employed as she had expected . She had thought to come upon her stooping over her eternal copy - books ; but for once they are laid aside . She is sitting on the hearthrug , the gas glaring above her and casting its ugly shadows upon her cheeks , making them look lined and hollow . Strewn about her is a small litter of old writing - desks , old workboxes , childish relics . On her lap lies open a morocco pocket - book , over which , on Sarah 's entrance , she hastily puts her hands , as if to conceal it . "
70850	70862	70842	70842	I	0	" she says , looking up with a rather guilty smile . "
70938	70954	70922	70922	she	721	" looking pensively at the little rusty old pair of scissors and the dim bodkin , "
70958	70959	70922	70922	she	721	" "
70970	71010	71011	71011	You	1318	" asks Sarah brusquely , and dropping on her knees beside her sister . Belinda starts . Her first impulse is to clasp her hands in still closer guardianship over her hid treasure ; but her next corrects it . "
71028	71042	71043	71043	I	0	" she says quietly , though in the yellow gaslight her cheeks crimson . "
71071	71092	71066	71066	granny	721	" picking up and holding scornfully between her finger and thumb for Sarah 's inspection one withered flower after another . "
71133	71187	71122	71122	you	1318	" As she speaks , and despite Sarah 's hand stretched out with involuntary eagerness to check her , she tosses the little dry skeletons into the fire , where , with a hardly perceptible shrivel and crackle , they for ever disappear . Belinda watches them with a hard , dry eye . "
71192	71214	71189	71189	you	1318	" she says , turning to her sister , and exhibiting the pocket - book extended empty from cover to cover . "
71260	71261	71240	71240	you	1318	" "
71266	71293	71240	71240	you	1318	" cries Sarah , snatching the little sheet , which looks older than it really is from obvious hard wear , continual unfolding , blistering tears . "
71317	71318	71320	71320	you	1318	" "
71329	71334	71322	71322	I	0	" says Belinda bitterly . "
71345	71396	71335	71335	I	0	" The fire burns low and dull ; and Sarah rises and stands right beneath the gas , so that no lack of light may hinder her examination of the document in her hand . But the rays of a June sun would be in this case of no use . "
71404	71416	71397	71397	I	0	" she says dispiritedly , giving it back to its owner ; "
71426	71501	71505	71505	me	0	" For a moment Belinda hesitates , considering with quivering eyelids and trembling lip the small and faded paper . Then in a moment it has followed the flowers ! At first it gives a curling writhe , as if it hurt it to be burnt ; then one or two sentences come out very clear before flying in black film up the chimney . The one that lasts longest and disappears latest is , "
71507	71595	71505	71505	me	0	" After that there is silence . Sarah has dropped sulkily into an armchair ; and Belinda has turned again to her childish treasures , and is beginning to sort and part them . But her hands move mechanically of their own accord , and with that want of purpose which shows that they are not directed by the brain . When a quarter of an hour has gone dumbly by , Belinda speaks , in that flat and spiritless voice which is now habitual to her : "
71626	71638	71623	71624	Professor Forth	136	" She stops with a sudden sobbing catch in her breath . "
71664	71669	71640	71640	you	1318	" replies Sarah surlily . "
71704	71705	71701	71701	my	0	" "
71712	71730	71707	71707	I	0	" groans Belinda , with an accent of such acute pain that Sarah 's heart smites her . "
71734	71739	71707	71707	I	0	" she cries compassionately . "
71750	71751	71707	71707	I	0	" "
71755	71768	71707	71707	I	0	" acquiesces Belinda , in bitter humility . But she looks relieved . "
71777	71783	71786	71786	you	1327	" she goes on a moment later—"but
71847	71848	71825	71825	he	136	" "
71855	71860	71825	71825	he	136	" repeats Sarah fiercely . "
71877	71878	71880	71880	you	1327	" "
71902	71917	71898	71898	you	1327	" answers Belinda , with an access of miserable , sore ill - humour ; "
71947	71948	71939	71939	you	1327	" "
71959	71966	71967	71967	I	0	" answers Sarah , genuinely hurt . "
71971	71972	71973	71973	I	0	" "
71979	71985	71975	71975	you	1327	" cries the other remorsefully ; "
72014	72015	72005	72005	my	0	" "
72040	72051	72052	72052	I	0	" retorts Sarah sarcastically ; and again they are silent . "
72058	72071	72087	72087	he	1332	" resumes Sarah devoutly , at the expiration of a heavy interval , "
72132	72142	72143	72143	You	1327	" Belinda 's only answer is a sickly smile . "
72155	72163	72164	72164	she	721	" pursues Sarah , in earnest narrative ; "
72216	72240	72241	72241	I	0	" resolutely catching and holding down with her small , strong wrists the hands that her sister is hurrying to her tortured face . "
72296	72328	72329	72329	I	0	" She pauses dramatically , and fixes her eyes upon the poor quivering features , so barely exposed to her piercing scrutiny . There comes no answer but a moaning sigh . "
72338	72342	72329	72329	I	0	" continues Sarah ; "
72377	72378	72354	72354	I	0	" "
72386	72394	72354	72354	I	0	" says Belinda , with faltering irony . "
72398	72399	72354	72354	I	0	" "
72406	72407	72354	72354	I	0	" "
72413	72416	72354	72354	I	0	" hopelessly . "
72425	72430	72422	72422	you	1327	" cries Sarah impatiently . "
72473	72514	72517	72517	him	162	" By a great wrench , Belinda succeeds in loosing one hand ; but it is a very insufficient shield , and she has failed in liberating the other , so sturdily held in Sarah 's small but potent grasp . "
72529	72539	72527	72527	his	162	" goes on Sarah , in a sort of prophetic frenzy—"they
72575	72584	72571	72571	you	1327	" But at this Belinda tears herself free . "
72590	72606	72571	72571	you	1327	" she says , in a suffocated voice , and struggling to reach the door . "
72621	72636	72571	72571	you	1327	" But Sarah falls on her knees , and catches her sister 's gown . "
72650	72661	72638	72638	you	1327	" she asks , in a thrilling , clear voice . "
72697	72731	72675	72675	you	1327	" Something in Sarah 's tone has , more than her detaining gesture , arrested Belinda 's flight . Stock - still she stands , in a wretched irresolution , death - pale . "
72737	72742	72675	72675	you	1327	" she murmurs miserably . "
72749	72762	72675	72675	you	1327	" cries Sarah in wild excitement , clasping her sister 's knees ; "
72814	72861	72904	72904	me	0	" Belinda still stands , white and trembling , her eyes staring stonily out into vacancy . Before them , though they seem to see nothing , stands that dreadful vision conjured up by her sister ; and the sight of it makes every limb shake . "
72866	72871	72904	72904	me	0	" she says feebly . "
72877	72885	72904	72904	me	0	" asseverates Sarah , in passionate heat . "
72932	72937	72927	72927	I	0	" laughing rather hysterically , "
72948	72977	72927	72927	I	0	" Perhaps it is Sarah 's laugh that recalls her sister to a more normal condition of feeling . With a long sigh she comes back to reality . "
72983	72992	72927	72927	I	0	" she asks , with a sarcastic smile . "
73012	73013	73014	73014	I	0	" "
73017	73025	73014	73014	I	0	" cries Sarah , with delighted eagerness . "
73056	73079	73105	73105	her	721	" jumping up , and moving in her turn rapidly towards the door . But it is now Belinda who detains her . "
73082	73087	73105	73105	her	721	" she says coldly ; "
73127	73133	73134	73134	Your	0	" in a lifeless tone . "
73161	73167	73158	73158	I	0	" with a bitter smile , "
73187	73188	73189	73189	I	0	" "
73200	73223	73189	73189	I	0	" cries Sarah , redoubling that energy of persuasion which , as she disppointedly sees , has been hitherto exercised in vain . "
73235	73241	73269	73269	them	1348	" with a scathing sneer , "
73263	73264	73269	73269	them	1348	" "
73271	73284	73269	73269	them	1348	" asks Belinda , with a fierce restlessness in eye and gesture . "
73323	73344	73316	73316	one	373	" Sarah has again fallen down on the floor before her sister , and is again suppliantly clasping her knees . "
73351	73356	73316	73316	one	373	" she cries beseechingly . "
73392	73508	73316	73316	one	373	" She has pressed her head against her sister 's gown , and through the woollen stuff her tears are soaking — Sarah 's rare tears ! There is such a compelling ring in her voice that Belinda 's cold , sick heart throbs beneath it . Again that vision rises before her , but changed and beautified . Rivers is coming into the room , but between him and her thrusts itself no chill , pedant figure . As she so stands hesitating , thrilling , in a waking dream , the door of the room does in effect fly open , and some one enters . Is it Rivers ? Alas , no ! "
73515	73535	73316	73316	one	373	" bawls Miss Watson , noisily entering , and throwing her greeting at them like a paving - stone . "
73577	73614	73567	73567	She	156	" Sarah has sprung to her feet , her habitual aplomb gone , and her one impulse to hide , at any price , her tear - stained face from the horny eyes of the intruder . "
73625	73644	73567	73567	She	156	" cries the latter , looking inquisitively from one to the other of the girls ' dismal faces . "
73663	73701	73702	73702	I	0	" concentrating her whole attention upon Sarah , whose face is so little used to being inundated with tears that it resents it , and shows the traces more plainly than does one that is frequently bewept . "
73705	73728	73702	73702	I	0	" she answers , snatching eagerly at the excuse , and violently resuming a part of her usual nonchalant self - command ; "
73767	73768	73755	73755	I	0	" "
73771	73777	73755	73755	I	0	" replies Miss Watson doughtily . "
73800	73801	73798	73798	me	0	" "
73823	73861	73862	73862	I	0	" asks Sarah innocently , stealing a covert glance at her own foggy image in the little Chippendale mirror over the mantelpiece , to see how far she is recovered . But Miss Watson does not hear . "
73875	73896	73870	73870	I	0	" continues she , drawing up a chair to the fire , and setting her large feet on the fender ; "
73931	73932	73922	73922	I	0	" "
73940	73947	73948	73948	I	0	" murmurs Sarah under her breath . "
73987	73988	73965	73965	I	0	" "
74000	74005	73990	73990	you	0	" rejoins Sarah sarcastically , "
74028	74029	74030	74030	I	0	" "
74040	74059	74030	74030	I	0	" goes on the visitor comfortably , rubbing her knees , advanced in close proximity to the fire . "
74096	74109	74110	74110	She	721	" with another look of acute inquisitiveness darted at her two companions . "
74130	74131	74110	74110	She	721	" "
74144	74160	74110	74110	She	721	" replies Sarah impudently , but with a nervous laugh and look towards her sister ; "
74165	74199	74110	74110	She	721	" But a curiosity so robust as Miss Watson 's is not to be blunted by a jest . That great Toledo blade is not to be turned aside by a light rapier . "
74210	74215	74110	74110	She	721	" says she persistently ; "
74233	74257	74110	74110	She	721	" trying to get a better idea of Belinda than the rather drooped nape of her white neck and one homespun shoulder afford ; "
74266	74267	74268	74268	You	0	" "
74273	74278	74268	74268	You	0	" cries Sarah jeeringly ; "
74328	74351	74382	74382	he	136	" It is obvious that nothing is to be made of Sarah ; the visitor turns her attention towards the other sister . "
74359	74367	74357	74357	Belinda	134	" she asks in a rallying voice ; "
74406	74427	74394	74394	he	136	" To these questions Belinda 's answer is so unready that her junior has again to come to her aid . "
74431	74436	74394	74394	he	136	" she answers ironically ; "
74452	74453	74438	74438	he	136	" "
74458	74477	74438	74438	he	136	" replies Miss Watson , her rhinoceros - hide quite unpunctured by the pricks of this angry persiflage , "
74547	74577	74578	74580	Apropos of Rivers	251	" She looks triumphantly round to collect the suffrages of her companions as to this project ; but neither is equal to giving utterance to any opinion upon it . "
74582	74611	74578	74580	Apropos of Rivers	251	" continues the other , too happy in the sound of her own voice to miss the lacking response , and addressing the observation more especially to Belinda , "
74654	74655	74647	74647	his	136	" "
74661	74683	74684	74684	He	136	" asks Sarah , trying to speak lightly , but with a hurry in her voice that she can not still . "
74690	74691	74684	74684	He	136	" "
74702	74730	74731	74731	I	0	" replies Sarah , laughing forcedly and changing her position so as to interpose the slight bulwark of her girlish figure between her sister and their guest . "
74749	74750	74737	74737	I	0	" "
74764	74769	74774	74774	him	136	" rejoins Sarah sharply : "
74796	74797	74779	74779	he	136	" "
74826	74829	74830	74830	I	0	" consolingly . "
74870	74877	74867	74867	I	0	" with her loud assured laugh , "
74897	75305	74893	74893	you	134	" After that Christmas morning Sarah spends her eloquence in vain . She may draw what pictures and practise what oratory and cry what tears she chooses . Of what use is it to draw pictures for , or address appeals to , or weep tears over a stone ? And as far as any malleability or power of receiving impressions from without goes , Belinda is henceforth a stone . She accepts all her sister 's appeals in a sullen , dogged silence . Whether she ever even hears them , Sarah is ignorant . She gives no sign of having done so by any least emotion produced by them . She listens , or seems to listen , with phlegmatic indifference to the sarcasms , vituperations , witticisms , poured from Sarah 's cornucopia upon her future husband . They awake in her neither anger nor pain . She makes no effort to check them . Apparently she would as soon hear them as not . But at the end of them , when Sarah , from pure loss of breath — not , heaven knows , from any lack of goodwill — has paused , things are at precisely the same point as they were when she began . Beaten and discouraged , she desists at last . Not , indeed , that she ever constrains herself so far as to omit tacking on some abusive adjective to the name of her future brother - in - law whenever she has occasion to mention him . Nor is it until she has exhausted every possible expletive that , as far as she knows , the English language contains , and applied them not only to him , but to his mother , that she desists at all . She relieves her feelings by putting all the dogs into mourning , tying a piece of black crape round each of their tails ; a proceeding which fills Punch with fury , Slutty with mauvaise honte , and Jane with pride . Jane has that love for finery which is implanted in many plain persons . With a face set like a flint , Belinda marches to her doom . And neither dogs nor men can retard the approach of the date of that doom . There are no preparations to delay it . She has steadfastly adhered to her determination to have no new clothes . "
75314	75351	75311	75311	her	1364	" Mrs. Churchill says , shaking that head whose eyes seem to grow brighter and her cheeks pinker and smoother as each day brings her nearer to the 10th of January and the South of France . "
75391	75440	75385	75387	all the women	1367	" She stops and shrugs her shoulders at the recollection ; but even as she shrugs a smile hovers across her lips . She is thinking that her French tour will be none the worse for having her purse made heavier by the weight of Belinda 's trousseau . "
75448	75459	75441	75441	I	0	" she says on another occasion to her younger granddaughter ; "
75492	75497	75488	75488	I	0	" her eye lightening , "
75548	75559	75560	75560	I	0	" tapping her cheek with an air of fond friskiness . "
75569	75574	75560	75560	I	0	" replies Sarah doggedly ; "
75581	75775	75776	75776	Belinda	134	" The settlements are drawn up . Belinda 's widowhood and her younger children are provided for . Bought are license and ring . The latter Professor Forth brought one day to be tried on ; and Belinda , with white , shut lips , pallidly essayed it . There is no bustle of arriving parcels , no wedding presents to be displayed . Miss Churchill has sternly insisted upon an absolute secrecy being observed as regards her engagement . She can bear to be married , but gifts and congratulations upon her marriage she could not bear . So that the comers and goers to the little house in — Street still come and go , without suspicion that anything out of the ordinary course is brewing beneath its modest roof . Mrs. Churchill would have preferred that the betrothal should be proclaimed from the housetops . It would give it a body and solidity that just at first she fears it lacks . An engagement known to all the world is much more difficult of rupture than one to which only the three or four persons most nearly concerned are privy . "
75783	75801	75811	75811	she	134	" she says one afternoon , as she and Sarah are driving home through the Park together ; "
75899	75905	75922	75922	you	1372	" with an amused smile , "
75919	75920	75922	75922	you	1372	" "
75925	75938	75922	75922	you	1372	" retorts Sarah , with a fiery eye and a curling lip , "
75973	76148	75958	75958	you	1372	" The elder woman looks rather foolish , and does not repeat her suggestion . And now , indeed , all necessity for it is at an end . There is obviously no need to tie Belinda with the cords of convention and public opinion to her faggot and stake . The 10th of January has come , and she has as yet shown no sign of flinching . To ensure the greater privacy , the marriage is to take place at nine o'clock in the morning . Not a soul is bidden to it . There are no bridesmaids or groomsmen , no train of wedding guests . Even Mrs. Churchill , on hearing of the earliness of the hour , has , like those wedding guests that Scripture speaks of , begged to be excused . Perhaps it is not only the raw winter morning from which she shrinks . Perhaps she is not particularly anxious to be an ocular witness of that ceremony which she has certainly speeded with her prayers . "
76163	76193	76151	76151	you	1372	" she says , appearing at her dressing - room door in a pretty laced dressing - gown as she hears her granddaughter descending the stairs to the brougham ; "
76216	76273	76213	76213	you	1372	" smilingly surveying the dark , homespun suit , so dark and brown as in the shabby light to look quite black , and the rigidly plain close bonnet which her granddaughter has chosen for her wedding garments . Belinda smiles too — a smile of which her grandmother is not particularly fond of thinking afterwards . "
76280	76282	76284	76285	a bride	1380	" she says—"so
76287	76288	76284	76285	a bride	1380	" "
76294	76315	76284	76285	a bride	1380	" continues the old lady rather hurriedly , and not much relishing the tone of this acquiescence in her compliment , "
76351	76352	76353	76353	We	1384	" "
76359	76364	76353	76353	We	1384	" replies Belinda quietly . "
76369	76379	76353	76353	We	1384	" ( with an accent of extreme surprise ) . "
76386	76387	76353	76353	We	1384	" "
76399	76400	76353	76353	We	1384	" "
76409	76418	76353	76353	We	1384	" asks her grandmother with an uncomfortable laugh . "
76447	76448	76468	76468	you	0	" "
76456	76464	76453	76453	my	0	" replies Belinda , again faintly smiling ; "
76498	76548	76496	76496	granny	721	" She speaks the two last words quite gently and friendly , and holds out her fair cold cheek to be kissed . Mrs. Churchill is afterwards not much fonder of thinking of the feel of that cheek , than of the look of that smile before spoken of . "
76557	76596	76551	76551	I	0	" she says to herself fretfully afterwards , as she sits with her still pretty feet resting on the well - warmed fender in the privacy of her dressing - room , when the brougham has rolled away ; "
76606	76768	76769	76769	I	0	" And meanwhile , through the dismal morning streets , dirty with that worst of all dirtiness , dirty snow , and where the lamp - lighters have only just put out the lamps , and would have done better not to put them out at all , Belinda drives , her sister by her side . The angry tears are raining down Sarah 's face , encouraged rather than checked by their owner . In her small warm hands ( for even on a bitter January morning wrath is warming ) lie tightly clasped Belinda 's cold ones . The shop - boys are only just beginning to take down the shutters ; in the haberdashers ' underessed windows , instead of costly fabrics and dainty webs , are to be seen nothing but bare boards and skeleton stands . The blue - armed housemaids are scrubbing the door - steps ; through the squares the milk - carts rush . "
76775	76785	76771	76771	you	1388	" says Sarah presently , from among her sobs . "
76790	76795	76798	76798	my	0	" replies Belinda calmly ; "
76802	76803	76798	76798	my	0	" "
76811	76817	76798	76798	my	0	" cries Sarah passionately . ; "
76855	76898	76899	76899	We	1390	" There is no sense in it ! The words keep echoing , dancing — set to a teasing tune — in Belinda 's head for the rest of the way . They reach the church - door . The carriage stops . "
76909	76933	76934	76934	Belinda	134	" says Sarah , with a fresh burst of sobs ; then , vehemently wringing her sister 's hands , she cries desperately : "
76958	76959	76960	76960	I	0	" "
76968	76987	77044	77044	he	1391	" replies Belinda firmly , though her voice is low and weak , and her lips are white ; "
77003	77042	77044	77044	he	1391	" So they get out . At the door they are received by a Churchill cousin , who , summoned as Belinda 's nearest male relative to give her away , stands awaiting them , cross and shivering . "
77057	77111	77051	77051	I	0	" says Sarah , with a last flare - up of hope , peering eagerly into the church , where here and there ( only here and there , for they are not nearly all lit ) a gas - lamp displays its dreary yellow flicker on the background of thick morning fog . "
77114	77121	77051	77051	I	0	then"—with a sudden collapse into disappointment — "
77138	77601	77051	77051	I	0	" They walk up the aisle ; a snuffy old pew - opener in a black crape bonnet preceding them ; Belinda on her cousin 's arm ; Sarah , in her ostentatiously paraded grief , bringing up the rear . They have arrived at the altar , the candles upon which are lit , their wavering light falling upon an impatient clergyman and two elderly men ; for the bridegroom has brought with him a friend of his own age and calling , whom he has summoned from Oxbridge to support him . The Churchill cousin has never before seen the bridegroom , nor has the bridegroom 's friend ever before seen the bride . The opposing parties now stare at each other in unaffected astonishment . All through the service , the young Churchill , who had once himself thrown out feelers in the direction of Belinda , and had them civilly and firmly at once returned to him , is setting himself angrily in imagination by the side of the bridegroom , and wondering what the devil Belinda can have seen in this ugly old curmudgeon to prefer to himself . All through the service , the bridegroom 's supporter is staring in gaping wonder at the beautiful broken - hearted - looking girl , who has mysteriously elected to unite her fate with that of his old friend ; ruefully reflecting that she will bring certain death to the constitutionals , and the pipes , and the discussions on the Enclitic de , and such - like light subjects , which they have been in the habit of sharing for the best part of the last forty years . All through the service the bridegroom is peevishly glancing over his shoulder to see whence comes the draught of raw air that , despite the black velvet skull - cap with which he has furnished himself , he feels at baleful play about his ears . Belinda alone looks neither to the right nor to the left . If she were really the statue which her fair , still body so closely resembles , she could not be less conscious than she is of dank nipping air or curious look . She appears to listen with close attention , or is it indeed not attention , but the impassiveness of stone ? Only once through all the service does her face come to life ; and then it is stabbed into life , as one has heard in the grisly dissecting - room tale , of him who , thought dead , was brought back to agonizing momentary life by a knife - thrust ! The knife - thrust that brings Belinda back to life lies in the words , "
77619	77620	77051	77051	I	0	" "
77625	77905	77051	77051	I	0	" She has been spared the trouble of forsaking that other . Has not he been beforehand with her ? Has not he forsaken her ? Sarah , closely watching her , sees her ashy features contract in such a spasm of mortal pain , that she involuntarily starts forward . Is she going to faint ? If she faint , and is carried out of church , may not she be saved even yet ? She is not yet married ! The service is not yet ended ! But the next glance at her face dispels the momentary hope . Belinda is not going to faint ; she has gained back her rigidity . She is dead again . It is over now ; over — even to the signing of names in the vestry . The clergyman offers his congratulations , but he does it hastily and abstractedly . He is thinking whether he will have time for a good warming and breakfasting before setting off for the funeral at Kensal Green , at which he has to assist . The bridegroom 's friend and the Churchill cousin also offer theirs ; but those of the first sound incredulous , and those of the latter ironical . Sarah alone keeps utter silence . The brougham stands at the door , the horse fidgety and stung by the cold . A crossing - sweeper and two pinched street children are watching the strange wedding - party 's exit . The bridegroom , great - coated and comfortered to the end of his long nose , is bidding adieu to his ally . The bride turns to her sister : "
77911	77916	77051	77051	I	0	" she says pantingly ; "
77926	77927	77051	77051	I	0	" "
77930	77935	77987	77987	I	0	" replies Sarah dully . "
77948	77982	77987	77987	I	0	" She has flung her arms round her sister in an épanchement most unusual with her . Her icy cheek is hard pressed against her sister 's hot and tear - reddened one . "
77991	78030	78031	78031	You	135	" cries Sarah , stammering , what between her sobs , the almost ungovernable impulse to invoke upon her sister a speedy widowhood , and the hopelessness of finding any other wish that will not sound a mockery . "
78042	78047	78048	78048	You	135	" says Belinda tremulously . "
78056	78057	78058	78058	I	0	" "
78064	78089	78060	78060	I	0	" says Sarah , driven to desperation by this tone , and clinging convulsively to her sister as though ten bridegrooms should not force them apart—"I
78099	78106	78060	78060	I	0	" breaking into an hysterical laugh . "
78121	78562	78116	78116	I	0	" These are the last words Belinda Forth hears , before the brougham whirls her away . The Churchill cousin takes Sarah home in a hansom , and a very unpleasant drive he has , as she cries violently the whole way , in passionate self - reproach at having found nothing kinder to say . Belinda has been married three days . We are creatures of habit , as everyone knows ; and it is surprising with what quick pliability we find ourselves cutting off and tucking in whatever angles prevent our fitting into any new niche that it may be our fate to occupy . But this process , though rapid , is usually of somewhat longer accomplishment than three days . At all events , Belinda has not yet got into the habit of being married . There still seems to her something improbable — nay , monstrous — in the fact of herself sitting opposite to Professor Forth at breakfast in their Folkestone lodgings , pouring weak tea for him out of a Britannia metal teapot , and sedulously recollecting how many lumps of sugar he likes , as she has already discovered that he has an objection to repeating the information . Nor is it less monstrous to be warming his overcoat , and cutting his newspapers , and ordering his dinners with that nice attention to digestibility and economy which she finds to be expected of her . They have been enormously long , these three days . It seems to her as if for months she has been looking at those hideous ornaments on the drawing - room chimney - piece , and trying to draw the skimp summer curtains that will not draw across the shutterless windows , rattled by the wind . For months she has been listening to the eternal sighing , sobbing , whistling , howling of that same wind , and to the sea banging on the cold shore . For months she has been walking with Professor Forth up and down , up and down the Leas , six turns this way , six turns that way . For months she has been writing his letters till her hand ached , and reading aloud to him till her voice cracked . As for the reading and writing , she can not have too much of them — the more the better ! There is nothing like occupation — a continuous , settled occupation — nothing like occupation for keeping out of one 's head those words of Sarah 's that ring so foolishly dinning in her ears , "
78577	78806	78116	78116	I	0	" She will not listen to them . Even if they are true , of what profit to hearken to them now ? And reading and writing render conversation , too , less necessary . It is certain that , however determinately anyone may have confined his or her contemplation of another person 's character to the intellectual side of it , it is impossible to live with that person without discovering that he or she has another side . Belinda has already discovered that her Professor has another . It is surprising how much less of his conversation has turned during the last three days upon the problems of the mind and the sayings of the mighty dead , than upon the price of coals and the wickedness of lodging - house servants . The first of these topics has led to the proposal that he and his bride shall henceforth content themselves with one fire , to be fed with ( if possible ) not more than two coal - boxes per day ; and the second is at present employing his tongue , his eyes , his thoughts . They are at breakfast , Belinda seated behind the Britannia metal teapot , her husband facing her , a dish of fried bacon before him , which latter object is monopolizing the whole of his attention . "
78815	78821	78116	78116	I	0	" he is saying slowly , "
78853	78854	78846	78846	you	1396	" "
78859	78864	78857	78857	I	0	" replies Belinda indifferently ; "
78871	78872	78857	78857	I	0	" "
78876	78896	78899	78899	Maria	183	" pursues Mr. Forth , his eyes ranging with severe scanning from the bacon - dish to the sugar - basin—"if
78933	78934	78940	78940	them	1398	" "
78942	78970	78940	78940	them	1398	" replies Belinda carelessly , putting up her hand to her hair , which , no longer tended by a maid , feels oddly loose and uncomfortable . "
78987	78988	78989	78989	I	0	" "
78999	79005	78989	78989	I	0	" replies he , nettled ; "
79033	79040	79041	79041	I	0	" looking carefully round the room , "
79060	79061	79041	79041	I	0	" "
79075	79085	79086	79086	you	0	" cries Belinda , breaking into an indignant laugh ; "
79092	79093	79086	79086	you	0	" "
79116	79121	79095	79095	you	1396	" he answers tartly . "
79130	79146	79123	79123	they	1402	" replies Belinda hotly , and lifting her disdainful fine nose contumaciously into the air , "
79169	79637	79123	79123	they	1402	" She rises precipitately as she speaks — to her , at least , Folkestone has not given an appetite — and walks to the window , where , for the rest of the breakfast hour , she presents a sociable homespun back to the economist at the breakfast - table . It is not the first time during these three days that she has discovered that his standpoint with regard to little social possibilities or impossibilities is different from her own . She had known that she did not love him , but she had not known that he wore carpet slippers in the drawing - room . A tendency towards slippers in the drawing - room , a passion for high tea , accompanied by no change of dress , are not these sufficient to wreck a bride 's happiness upon ? But worst of all , perhaps because latest of all , has jarred upon her this final instance of how widely asunder are their points of view . It jars upon her still as she stands by the window after breakfast , sullenly drumming on the pane . In the night snow has fallen , a thin sprinkling meeting even the sea 's lip , advancing even to where the dull little grey waves set their chill feet ; a shabby sprinkling everywhere : not a good thick cloak of snow , deep and pure , but a scanty rag , through which every footstep shows the hard dark ground . It jars upon her still , as she walks to church alone — it is Sunday morning — trying to persuade herself that she had not felt a movement of gladness on discovering that he had no intention of accompanying her . She walks along the windy cliff to where the church and the red vicarage look out seawards , falling in , as she goes , with a stream of people bound to the same goal . It is a well - fed , comfortable - looking stream flowing prosperously to God 's house ; smart furry mothers holding the hands of smart furry little children , fathers and tall young daughters , husbands and wives . There is scarcely one , as young as Belinda , who is companionless . But she does not think of this . Her eyes are turned towards the ocean , that ocean for the most part hugged by a close mist , with only one patch of faintish glory — a pale dazzle of dim gold — on which a small fishing - boat comes sailing , its homely sails transfigured as it goes . She is saying to herself , with a heart sinking so deep that she dare not gauge its profundity : "
79692	79699	79665	79666	the scholar	1407	" she asks with contemptuous misgivings ; "
79722	80049	80050	80050	I	0	" She has reached the church , but even inside the consecrated door she finds that it is still with her . It comes between her and the Christmas decorations ; between her and the bowing congeeing clergy ; between her and the prayers . A poor starling has found its way into the building . All through the service it is flying from side to side , above the heads of the congregation , under the arched roof from window to window . Children turn their heads and their eyes , idly curious to look after it . All through the sermon she hears the agonized pecking of its poor beak against the pane , in its efforts to escape . She says to herself that it is in the same plight as she . It , too , entered prison of its own accord . When the service is ended , Belinda loiters behind the rest of the congregation , in order to press half - a - crown into the pew - opener 's hand—(what would Professor Forth say to such extravagance?)—and to pour into his ear an eager prayer that he will set all the church doors and windows open , to give her starling a chance of escape . But , alas ! what pew - opener can ever let her out ? As she passes homewards , she finds that the day has bettered . The sun has swallowed up the mist , and now shines steadily bright , and even sensibly warm . The little waves are small and mild as summer ones , though the air is still full of penknives . Perhaps it is the increased brightness upon Nature 's face ; perhaps it is the two quiet hours of her own society , that have braced her to face with a greater courage the lot she has chosen , and the fried bacon that typifies it . "
80055	80062	80050	80050	I	0	" she says to herself sternly , "
80112	80117	80150	80150	his	1410	" ( shuddering ) ; "
80173	80179	81587	81587	she	1414	" with a curling lip ; "
80194	81394	80181	80181	I	0	" Her resolutions in both respects outlast the day . That to make the best of things has body enough to withstand even the close examination to which her husband subjects the Sunday roast - beef , in order to discover whether it has been robbed of any of its native suet . He has a slow munching way of eating , which fidgets her inexpressibly ; but she bears that too . She even resists the temptation to look away from him . Since he is to munch opposite to her till death do them part , would it not be wiser to accustom herself to the sight ? Her resolution withstands also stoutly all the little trials attendant on their afternoon constitutional . When they emerge upon the Leas , they see a broad highway of molten copper stretching across the sea to the lowering sun . Belinda asks leave to run down the many steps on the clift 's face to the water 's edge , to set her feet in the foam fringe , and watch the long swell heaving ocean 's sullen breast ; but the Professor will not hear of it . A certain number of brisk turns on the Leas — always the same number — is the kind of walk to which alone he gives his approbation . No stopping to look at the copper sunset , or the fair ships riding past ; nothing more likely to arrest the circulation and chill the liver . They meet the same people as they met yesterday and the day before , and as they will meet to - morrow and the day after ; the same bath - chairs , the same dogs . The sick , white woman with her attentive burly husband ; the deformed child ; the frolic - some colley dogs ; the frivolous Spitzes ; the little blithe Scotch terriers . Her resolution outlasts even the twilit hour , to her the most trying of the day . If she were to consult her own wishes , there would be no such hour ; no space interposed between the fading of the day - light and the lighting of the gas . But it is in Professor Forth 's programme that there shall be such an interval when he leans back in his armchair , with his eyes closed , and does not wish to be spoken to ; whether in meditation or in sleep she can not tell . There is nothing for her but to sit opposite to him , with his idleness , but without his repose . The lowered blinds prevent her looking out upon the first sunset - reddened , and by - and - by moon - silvered sea . She can not even distinguish the lustres and the vulgar vases on the chimney - piece . She can not even stir the fire into such a blaze as to enable her strong young eyes to read by it ; for to stir the fire makes the coals burn quicker . It is the hour when the happy young build love - arbours out of , and see brave sweethearts in , the red coals . What love - arbour dare she build ? What sweetheart dare she see ? Then come the long hours of reading aloud . They are the most bearable of the day . It does her resolution the less credit to hold out through them . However , it does hold out . But will it endure through the next day ? If it does , it must indeed be of a stout fibre . For no sooner has the next day risen , than it is clear that there has come one of those rare scourge - days with which God sometimes lashes His world ; one of those days whose date is remembered , which is held up as a standard in after years for other fell days to measure themselves by ; a day that wrecks ships by fleets ; that strikes down centenary oaks by scores ; that whelms trains in its snowdrifts ; that stiffens into frozen death the sheep on the mountain - side , and the traveller fate - overtaken in the snow - choked country lane . Snow often comes stilly ; but to - day it is blowing — blowing mercilessly : not a bluff west wind , good - humouredly roistering , but an inhuman north - easter , the furious sleet driven , raging and sweeping , by its hellish lash . When Belinda comes down to breakfast , there is not a soul on the Leas , but the luckless baker 's boy butting with bent head against the razor - edged blast . It is scarcely the day which one would have chosen to spend in a flimsily - built seaside summer lodging - house . The Forths ' lodgings are no better and no worse than most others of the class ; with walls about as puny , with woodwork about as warped , with gaps between door and carpet about as wide , with curtains as miserably insufficient as most of their brethren . Though every door and window is religiously closed , there is the feeling of being sitting out of doors , only more draughty . Even in a warm , stoutly - built house one would shiver ; but here ! Well , here the cold is so marrow - piercing , that it usurps to itself the whole attention of the mind . It is not a subordinate , governable cold that by an effort of the will one may forget . It can never be out of the thoughts for one moment ; from the hour of rising , until that of shuddering back to bed again . The Professor , always a chill - blooded creature , sits all day with his knees within the fender , piled with every article of his own , and several of Belinda 's wardrobe . Throwing economy to the winds , he has lit the gas , and piled the fire half - way up the chimney ; though whenever fresh coals are put on , a great gust of greenish smoke , furiously beaten back by the blast , comes pouring down the chimney , and suffocatingly flooding the room . Belinda , cold as she undoubtedly is , is not near the fire . She is standing by the window , with a pot of paste and some strips of paper in her numbed hands , pasting up the apertures in the ill - seasoned shrunk window - frames , through which the wind comes icily whistling and piping . Now and again she appeals for directions to the heap of wraps beside the hearth , trying to still her chattering teeth as she does so , to keep out of her tone the intense dispiritedness which has invaded her whole being ; not to listen to the ironical demon voice that whispers in her ear : "
81409	81554	80181	80181	I	0	" All day — all day the snow swirls past . All day the sea — dimly seen , sometimes seen not at all , through the white hurricane — booms and thunders on the shore . The snow cleaves to the window - panes , freezes there , darkens yet more the dismal room . Not a soul puts nose out of doors from the dark dawn to the soon - falling night . When at length Belinda has finished her pains - taking pasting - up of the windows , she asks in a voice of would - be cheerfulness whether the blast is not sensibly lessened ; but receives for answer a melancholy negative . The whirlwind from under the door is such as to laugh to scorn all remedies applied elsewhere . And one can not paste up the door . "
81565	81576	81577	81577	They	1414	" suggests Belinda , still with that same desperate cheerfulness . "
81593	81643	81587	81587	she	1414	" But there are no sand - bags , and the landlady , embittered like everyone else by the weather , tartly replies that such a thing has never before been asked for in her house ! However , Belinda is not yet at the end of her resources . "
81647	81651	81644	81644	I	0	" she says , "
81693	81742	81745	81745	Churchill	134	" Having received permission , she begins to turn them over , in order to select those most suitable for her purpose ; her careless eye unintentionally alighting on a word here and there . The first two that she catches are her own late and present surnames . "
81747	81836	81745	81745	Churchill	134	" It is the announcement of her marriage in the Daily News . She drops it as if it had bitten her . The roll of newspapers is about as effective a bulwark against the wind as a child 's sand - rampart is against the sea . But since she has at least done her best , Belinda considers that she has earned the right to sit down by the fire , with her fur - coat hoisted to her ears . She offers to read aloud . "
81843	81849	81841	81841	you	1418	" replies the Professor morosely , "
81872	82396	82397	82397	I	0	" He even looks rather injured when she herself takes up a book . But neither can she concentrate her attention . Her mind strays from the dreary wonder as to whether this enormous day will ever end , to the still more dreary wonder why she should wish it to end , seeing that it will only lead to another like it . There has been no break since breakfast - time , with the exception of the laying and removing of their early dinner , and the altercation about the sand - bags . No one has been near them , not even the postman ! Doubtlessly every line is blocked , and all traffic suspended . The dark has long fallen ; if that , indeed , can be said to have fallen which has reigned more or less all day . The gas has been turned up higher ; the thin curtains drawn , with many futile jerks to the rings that will not run ; the fire is new - built , and a sort of air of pseudo - evening - comfort diffuses itself . Belinda 's slow pulse begins to beat , and her blood to circulate a little more briskly . It quickens its pace perceptibly , when — oh blessed sight!—the lodging - house servant enters with a pile of letters in her chappy hand . Thank God , the line is not blocked after all ! These are the London morning letters that should have come at 8 a.m. She snatches at them eagerly . They can bring her no great good news , but they make an unspeakably welcome interruption to the uniform dismalness of the long day . They remove the terrible feeling of isolation from all humankind , which hour by hour has been gaining ground upon her . There is a pile for the Professor ; and for her a large fat envelope , bulging with enclosures , and directed in Sarah 's hand . She draws her chair more closely to the hearth , and folds her soft furs warmlier about her . She will enjoy her letters at luxurious leisure . She unfastens the cover , and the enclosures fall out , six in number ; a note from Sarah herself , four letters addressed in well - known and on this occasion warmly - welcomed female hand - writings , and one in an unknown male hand . Is it unknown ? At first it seems so ; but as she looks there rises in her memory , from which indeed it is never long absent , the image of another letter , to whose superscription this one , though less ill - written , has surely a strange likeness . She continues to look at it ; a fear too terrible for words rising in her heart , and depriving her of the power of opening it . The fire crackles comfortably . The Professor turns the page of his letter . It is his third ; and she has not yet opened her first . "
82406	82411	82412	82412	I	0	" he says politely . "
82418	82423	82414	82414	I	0	" she answers stammering . "
82431	82508	82509	82510	David Rivers	143	" She must conquer this ridiculous hesitation . Probably , certainly , she is the victim of hallucination — of an accidental resemblance . The likeness is no doubt confined to the address . As soon as she sees the letter itself , she will laugh at her own foolish fancies . She tears it open , and tremblingly turns to the signature . There was no hallucination — no accidental resemblance ! She was right . "
82512	83003	82509	82510	David Rivers	143	" For the first moment she is drowned in a rush of insensate joy , followed in one instant by such an anguish of horror as makes her for a while unconscious of everything around her — everything but that rending , burning , searing pain . He has written to her at last ! What has he to say to her now ? To congratulate her upon her marriage ? He might have spared her that thrust ! She will not read it ! She will burn it unread!—by - and - by — not now!—when she can do it unobserved . Her shaking fingers refold the paper , hide it on her lap beneath the fur , and take up another letter — Sarah 's . She goes straight through it , nor till reaching the last sentence does she discover that not one word of its contents has found entry to her brain . It is no use ! That letter must be read . It burns her knee as it lies on it . It is burning , burning all through her . It is better to know the worst ! But to read it here under her husband 's eyes — her husband 's ! She casts at him one desperate look , and then , suddenly rising , flies out of the room . He may call after her — she thinks that he does so — but she makes no kind of answer . Up the draughty stairs she flies into her bedroom ; turning the key in the lock , as she shuts the door behind her . The Professor , relenting , has given her leave to have a fire there ; but the chimney smokes so furiously that it has had to be long ago let out . The room is piercingly , savagely , truculently cold ; but though she has been thinking of the cold all day , she is now not aware of it . How can one be cold with a red - hot iron in one 's heart ? In a moment she has turned up the gas and lit the candles . It is well to have plenty of light by which to read one 's death - warrant . But she can not spare time to sit down . A frantic haste to possess the contents of that letter which , five minutes ago , she had thought herself capable of burning unread , has laid hold of all her trembling being . Standing , she reads it ; and this is what she reads : ' 5 , Paradise Row , Milnthorpe , ' Yorkshire . ' January 10 th . January 10 th ! Why , that was her wedding - day ! It is not to congratulate her upon her marriage , then ; he could not have known it ! "
83788	83792	83793	83793	She	1443	" David Rivers . "
83870	83877	83878	83878	She	1443	" Darling ! darling ! darling ! "
84039	84046	84047	84047	she	1443	" It is my own choice , "
84050	84059	84061	84061	she	1443	" there lies the point of the joke ! "
84076	84082	84083	84083	she	1443	" Am I going mad ? "
84506	84513	84514	84514	she	1443	" It is my own choice ! "
84634	84642	84609	84609	Her	1443	" I am so mad with joy ! "
84643	84655	84657	84657	she	1443	" Is it any wonder that I can not write sense ? "
84720	84725	84736	84736	he	1468	" Mad with joy ! "
85101	85116	85117	85117	he	209	" Where have you been ? What have you been doing all this time ? "
85121	85129	85117	85117	he	209	" I have been in my room . "
85170	85180	85181	85181	he	209	" I hope that the fire was burning well , "
85185	85204	85181	85181	he	209	" If the grate is of the same construction as this one , it will require constant attention . "
85205	85220	85222	85222	Belinda	134	" I — I — do not think that it was burning at all , "
85247	85254	85258	85258	he	209	" Not burning ? Not lit ? "
85302	85339	85299	85299	her	183	" Have you been pasting up the windows ? If not , I am at a loss to conceive what can have induced you to spend the best part of an hour in such an atmosphere . "
85340	85357	85299	85299	her	183	" I — I — have not pasted them up ; I will if you like . "
85358	85366	85299	85299	her	183	" You have left the door open . "
85367	85378	85299	85299	her	183	" I am very sorry ; I will shut it . "
85379	85396	85299	85299	her	183	" What are you doing over there ? Why do not you come and sit down ? "
85397	85409	85299	85299	her	183	" I — I — am looking for the Daily News ! "
85410	85450	85299	85299	her	183	" The Daily News ! What do you want with the Daily News ? Is it possible that you have already forgotten that you made a roll out of all the newspapers to fill the aperture under the door ? not"—ungratefully—"that
85458	85459	85299	85299	her	183	" "
85473	85484	85468	85468	I	0	" She does not explain why she laid it aside . "
85494	85638	85487	85487	you	0	" fretfully , fidgeted by her movements . She is on her knees before the cupboard to which her husband had planned to confide the custody of his bacon , and from which she has been unable wholly to exclude jam - pots and pickle - jars . She had forgotten that they were there , and the sight of them — unlikely as it would seem that such poor trifles could either add to or take aught from the sum of so great a grief — the sight of them seems to be the last drop that brims her cup . In after life it seems to her as if nothing had brought her so near self - destruction as those picklepots ! What does she want with the Daily News ? A desperate impulse seizes her . She will tell him . "
85657	85682	85684	85685	my mother	614	" She pauses . The name sticks in her throat . With the best will in the world , she can not pronounce it . "
85687	85698	85699	85699	I	0	" suggests the Professor , filling up the blank conjecturally . "
85705	85723	85699	85699	I	0	" Belinda laughs a laugh like the one that had made her question her own sanity upstairs . "
85742	85886	85887	85887	I	0	" She has found the journal now — found it in the very spot to which she herself had — as one does — unconsciously tidied it away . In an instant , as if it were printed in her own red blood , her eye has flashed upon the announcement ; picked it out from the long list . Her work - basket , in which lie the scissors with which she must cut it out , lies on the table at her husband 's elbow . She stands quietly beside him , snipping , snipping delicately , in the gaslight . There must be no jagged edges ; nothing that tells of emotion — nothing that will betray to him to whom it is to be sent that each cut of those fine , sharp scissors was into her own heart . "
85904	85940	85960	85960	I	0	" says her husband , venting the ill - humour engendered by Maria 's tardiness in replying to his spells upon the nearest object — as many better men than he have done before him . "
85955	85956	85957	85957	I	0	" "
85963	85968	85957	85957	I	0	" interrupts she harshly ; "
85991	86145	85957	85957	I	0	" She is back in her own room again , having taken the opportunity to slip out unquestioned , afforded by Maria 's appearance at last — Maria in that reluctant , grudging humour with which she usually offers services , cheered by no hope of final largess ; a hope that the Professor has seen fit , immediately upon his arrival , to extirpate . Belinda is in her room again alone ; but alone and undisturbed she knows that she can not long remain , but that she will be speedily followed by Maria with coal - box and shavings to re - light the extinct fire . What she has to do , must be done quickly . She opens her writing - case ; takes out envelope and paper ; directs the first , and then writes on the latter , in a large , painstaking , legible hand , "
86150	86228	86229	86229	Belinda	134	" It has not taken one minute in the doing : Maria 's pursuing foot is not yet heard : happily she will be as slow as she can . Belinda blots it carefully ; then , after steadfastly and with perfect tearlessness considering her own handiwork for the space of a moment , she lifts the paper to her dry lips , and lays a solemn good - bye kiss upon her own name ; upon the "
86231	86237	86229	86229	Belinda	134	" that is carefully avoiding the "
86240	87371	87373	87374	Belinda Forth	134	" She has no manner of doubt that he will find it there : and who can grudge them such a parting embrace ? Then , without any further delay , she folds the paper , inserts in it the advertisement , closes and stamps the envelope . It is done ! accomplished ! and now that it is so , an intense restless craving seizes her , that it should be on its journey . In any case , it can not leave Folkestone to - night ; but at least she might do her part . It might be committed to the post . The thought of it lying here all night ; meeting her again in the morning — God above her ! what will that morning waking be ! — is more than she can face . But to whom can she confide it ? To Maria ? That high - spirited person would flatly refuse to brave the elements on such a night ; and neither man nor mouse could blame her . To that grimy Gibeonite — the boot and shoe boy ? He would infallibly commit it to his breeches - pocket , and dismiss it from his mind . Why should not she take it herself ? There is a pillar - post not twenty yards from their door . The thought has no sooner crossed her mind than it is half way towards accomplishment . In a moment she has taken hat and additional furs from the wardrobe ; has fastened them on as quickly as her treambling fingers will let her , and has stolen downstairs , creeping on tiptoe past the sitting - room door ; a needless caution , for the Professor , though not at all deaf , has no longer that fineness of hearing which is spared to few of us after forty . Neither does she , as she feared she would , meet Maria and the coal - box . The hall - door is not locked , and opens easily ; rather too easily indeed , for no sooner is it unlatched than a force as of ten thousand Titans violently pushing dashes it back . It is all that she can do , after repeated efforts , and putting forth her whole strength , to shut it behind her . When she at length succeeds , it closes with a bang that — as she is aware by former experience — makes every floor leap . Again she laughs out loud . The temporary moonlit lull is over ; the cloud - rack has sponged out moon and sea . The great hurricane is awake and in wrath again . There seems to be nothing in all creation but himself and his terribler snow - sister . The air is so full of the white flurry — close and fine as flour — that it makes breathing difficult . Belinda gasps . She has to stand still for a moment , that her feet may grasp firm hold of the ground , else will the north - easter , in one of its furious freaks , take her bodily off them . Then she staggers resolutely on again ; a lonely fighter through the raging winter night . Of every slightest lull she takes advantage to quicken her pace . Now and again she turns her back upon the suffocating snow in order to breathe . But not for one moment does she repent of having come . She feels no hostility towards , no fear of , the dreadful elements . Is not she as desperate as they ? The hand - to - hand fight with them does her good . It seems to lift some of the lead from her brain ; to set further away from her that madness that had loomed so near . But the twenty yards seem more like twenty miles . She has reached the pillar - post at last — an opportune momentary lifting of the storm revealing to her its snow - whitened red — has found the aperture , and has dropped into it the letter so carefully , painstakingly kept dry beneath her cloak . Yes ! it is gone ! gone past recall ! as past recall as the wood at Wesenstein ; as the friend on whose coffin we have seen fall the first cruel spadeful of earth . But of this she has no time to think . A fresh frenzy of the tornado obliges her to cling half - stunned to the pillar ; and the moment that she looses her hold , the snow - wind takes her in its fearful hands and hurls her back along the Leas . For one dread moment it seems to her that it is about to hurl her far away over the cliff into the awful lap of the bellowing waves that , even now , she can hear in the darkness savagely tearing at the great hewn stones of the quay . That one instant reveals to her that the life she had thought herself capable of throwing away is still sweet . By a great effort her feet recover their hold of the ground which has fled from beneath them ; but not until she has been swept far past the house to which she is struggling to return . Battling , blinded , and dizzy ; bewildered by the darkness , and by the hopeless uniformity of the row of buildings , it is long before , groping for the door that continually eludes her , she at length finds it ; at length she finds herself within its shelter . Maria does not recognise her at first , so battered and snow - covered is she ; but Belinda pays no heed to her expressions of incredulous astonishment . It is possible that she may be so deafened by the elemental roar as not to hear them . Without much consciousness of how the intervening stair - flights were climbed , she finds herself again in her room . The gas is still turned high up , as she had left it . Maria has at length relit the fire ; there is plenty of light for her to see her bridal chamber by . Plenty of light , too , to see the blotting - pad on which she had so lately blotted the three words of her billet de faire part . She takes it up , and holds it to the looking - glass . How plainly the three words come out ; not a letter , not a stroke missed ! "
87376	87387	87373	87374	Belinda Forth	134	" She mutters them over and over under her breath . "
87392	87393	87373	87374	Belinda Forth	134	" "
87398	87409	87410	87410	Belinda	134	" She is roused by a voice calling from below : "
87414	87434	87435	87435	Belinda	134	" It is her husband . Let him call ! The summons is repeated with more stress and urgency : "
87439	87450	87451	87451	Belinda	134	" Is not it the voice which will go on calling "
87453	87620	87621	87621	I	0	" through life ? Is not it the voice to which she herself has given the right to call Belinda ; to command Belinda ; to chide Belinda ; immeasurably worst of all , to caress Belinda ? Of what use , then , to break out thus early into senseless , bootless revolt ? She hastily shakes the powdery snow from her clothes , drags off her soaked shoes , twists afresh her wet and streaming hair , and goes decently and orderly down again ; decently and orderly to all appearance , for who can see the wheels that are whirring in her head , and the flashes of uneasy light before her eyes ? She finds her bridegroom in his former attitude : it seems to her as if she could have better borne him and it , if he had changed his position ever so little . But no ! he is still mumping , round - backed , over the fire . "
87625	87636	87621	87621	I	0	" he says , with a not altogether blamable irritation ; "
87647	87663	87641	87641	you	1486	" There is no answer , the wheels in her head are going so fast . "
87675	87676	87671	87671	you	1486	" "
87682	87683	87677	87677	I	0	" "
87692	87693	87686	87686	You	1486	" "
87701	87716	87695	87695	I	0	" replies she very distinctly , and looking straight at him as she speaks . "
87722	87727	87719	87719	I	0	" continues he sarcastically , "
87741	87742	87743	87743	I	0	" "
87750	87751	87743	87743	I	0	" "
87754	87787	87752	87752	Pshaw	266	" She has taken her former seat opposite to him . The north - easter 's lash has whipped up a royal red into her cheeks , usually so far too pale . "
87795	87800	87752	87752	Pshaw	266	" she says slowly ; "
87826	87942	87821	87821	I	0	" As she speaks , she takes up the book laid down over - night , and without further permission launches into the first paragraph she sees . She has been conscious , on coming into the now really warm room out of the frozen stinging air , of an odd sensation in her head . It feels light and swimming , but she reads on . Now and then the type waves up and down before her like the furrows of a ploughed field ; but she reads on . The matter of the book and the matter of her thoughts are woven hopelessly together like warp and woof , but she reads on : "
88028	88052	88066	88066	you	1488	" How the print is jigging and bowing ; but it will come straight and still again just now . She reads on . "
88073	89032	88066	88066	you	1488	" But instead of complying , Belinda tumbles the volume noisily down into the fender , and falls off her chair after it . Her wish is fulfilled : she has fainted ! The winter , with its terrible stress and fury , is over and past . People sitting in blooming spring gardens or by widely - opened windows , talk comfortably , with lips no longer chapped , of the great snow - storm , and compare notes as to the amount of personal inconvenience and discomfort to which it had exposed them . Anecdotes of the awful night spent in snow - stopped trains have formed the convenient opening for many a dinner talk ; the anxiety on the part of each interlocutor to prove that he or she had suffered more than the other , leading to intimacy before soup is well over . Of its ferocity and its devil - work few overt traces now remain , except killed laurel bushes and rare thrushes . Out of how many sweet little throats full of music has it pinched the tender life ! But over its wrecks the sea rolls ; and in the bottomless sea of mothers ' hearts its drowned sailors lie buried . And does the analogy between the material and the spiritual world hold good ? Does the sea of oblivion smoothly heave and largely sweep above the soul that went down on that dread night ? Does no spar pierce the flood to show where that good ship foundered ? It would be the opinion of outsiders , who have not visited Oxbridge — if they had formed an opinion at all upon the subject , and were asked for it — that the inhabitants of that university town dwell in grey and ancient houses , time - coloured , and with flavours of old learning still hanging about their massy roof - trees . In point of fact , their lives are passed for the most part in flippant spick and span villas and villakins , each with its half acre of tennis - ground and double daisies , all so new that scarcely anyone has had time to die there , though numerous people have taken leave to be born there , and forming in their ensemble an ugly , irrelevant , healthy suburb , that would not disgrace a cotton city of to - day . It is mid - May , and the hour is one of the afternoon ones ; an hour at which luncheon is already forgotten , though tea still smiles not near . Along the shining river , a mile away , eight - oars , four - oars , skiffs are flashing . Scores of happy boys are tearing down the path alongside , keeping company with their boats , exhorting , admonishing , shouting themselves hoarse . But their noise , though strong are their young lungs , does not reach in faintest echoes to the quiet drawing - room , where the as quiet lady sits , head on lily hand , beside the window , staring out at her plot of forget - me - nots and the gold shower of her two laburnum trees . Warm as the day is , a fire burns on the hearth ; a fire whose inconvenient heat Belinda is languidly trying to counteract by the agency of the fan , slowly waving in her unoccupied hand . It is too hot even for Slutty , who , shortly panting in her sleep , lies cast on her fat side in a cool corner . Upon Slutty 's figure , an academic life , and the total absence of the thinning emotion of envy , and of the bad but emaciating passion of jealousy ( an absence caused by the fact of her being sole dog of the establishment , and having no longer any cause for suffering from Punch 's tinselly accomplishments ) has begun to tell . She could not well look stouter or less intellectual if she were one of the old Fellows of St. Bridget 's . When last we saw Belinda , she was lying grovelling among cinders and fire - irons in a fender . Now she is sitting placid and upright on a window - seat . Is the change that has taken place in her soul 's attitude as much to her advantage as that which has effected itself in her body 's ? Who can tell ? She is past the age when a smeared face , puckered lips and bawling cries mean grief ; when ruddy cheeks and shouting laughter mean joy . She does not look particularly happy , perhaps , but which of us is conscious of looking specially radiant as he or she sits alone , with no one to summon to the surface of the skin that latent cheerfulness , of which few have enough to spend it on ourselves alone ? And yet , at this moment , the thoughts passing through her mind are not disagreeable ones ; scarcely thoughts indeed , lazy summer impressions rather , of the pleasantness of the tiny sky - coloured meadow that lies , all turquoise , under her eyes , and calls itself her forget - me - not bed ; of the round mother - swallow 's head , peeping over the nest beneath the eaves . At some further thought or sensation , a slight but definite smile breaks up the severe lines of her young yet melancholy mouth . At the sound of the opening door , however , in one instant it is dead . "
89038	89073	88066	88066	you	1488	" says her husband , entering and advancing towards her , with that shuffling gait which plainly tells of slippers ( she has not then been able to break him of carpet slippers ) . "
89088	89093	88066	88066	you	1488	" she answers coldly . "
89100	89120	89121	89121	I	0	" he pursues — his want of surprise at her frigid tone betraying that it is her habitual one — "
89131	89132	89121	89121	I	0	" "
89140	89198	89137	89137	you	0	" she asks , lifting her eyes to his face . It is pleasant to be looked full at by a handsome woman ; but if she has , before looking at you , taken care to put as much frost as they can hold into her fine blue eyes , the pleasure is very sensibly lessened . "
89246	89247	89236	89236	I	0	" "
89262	89274	89255	89255	I	0	" rejoins he , glancing at a paper in his hand . "
89327	89328	89317	89317	I	0	" "
89342	89351	89334	89334	I	0	" replies she quietly , but with asperity ; "
89362	89396	89334	89334	I	0	" There is a moment 's silence , during which Belinda turns her head pointedly away towards the laburnum tree and the emerald grass ; but the Professor shows no signs of retreating . "
89411	89419	89407	89407	I	0	" he says , with peevish pertinacity ; "
89427	89428	89429	89429	I	0	" "
89437	89464	89429	89429	I	0	" answers she , with an accent of carefully elaborated patience , which , to the meanest observer , would betray the depths of her impatience ; "
89517	89543	89503	89503	You	0	" ( with a faint sarcastic smile of a very different quality from that little one lately addressed to the swallow and the flowers ) , "
89559	89589	89590	89590	I	0	" At the mention of Miss Churchill , a distinct new crumple of ill - humour has added itself to the already numerous wrinkles of Mr. Forth 's face . "
89606	89611	89590	89590	I	0	" he says obstinately ; "
89624	89630	89590	89590	I	0	" Belinda shrugs her shoulders . "
89642	89652	89590	89590	I	0	" she says in a key of low resentment . "
89718	89741	89743	89743	you	1490	" At the end of this conciliatory speech she stops , and there is a pause , which the Professor shortly breaks . "
89748	89753	89743	89743	you	1490	" he says grudgingly , "
89798	89799	89800	89800	You	1490	" "
89811	89832	89800	89800	You	1490	" cries she , rising suddenly ; her body trembling , and her great eyes lightening with anger and disappointment . "
89848	89884	89843	89843	You	1490	" To his death - day , the German savan will never suspect with what hotly raging and rebellious fingers were penned those polite , lucid , and erudite lines upon Empedocles ' newly - discovered "
89887	89944	89843	89843	You	1490	" which he shortly received . It is long before the Professor can satisfy his own fastidious ear and captious mind as to the fitness of the phrases to be employed . Many a sheet is angrily torn across by Belinda ; many a fresh one is sullenly begun before her task is ended — before her "
89952	90048	89843	89843	You	1490	" induing , with her aid — aid given grudgingly and not unasked — his cap and gown , leaves her side to attend a college meeting . Not until the banging of the house - door tells her that he is really gone , does she give herself the indulgence of an enormous sigh . Throwing herself back in the leathern chair , in which she has been sitting at the writing - table , with weary long arms clasped behind her neck , and dogged eyes staring at the flies on the ceiling — "
90055	90060	90051	90053	a cheerful giver	1502	" she says aloud . "
90068	90093	90061	90061	He	1502	" ( to a woman , the man that she loves and the man that she hates are equally nameless , equally he ) . "
90113	90156	90157	90157	I	0	" As she speaks , acrid tears issue from their hidden ducts , and brim her eyes ; but she shakes them vehemently away . She will not give to Sarah 's penetrating eye the chance of seeing that she has wept . "
90163	90174	90175	90175	she	1503	" she says , rising , and pulling herself together ; "
90185	90557	90175	90175	she	1503	" She goes away to her own room , changes her gown for a fresher one , dresses her hair more becomingly , and practises looking happy in the glass . Before she has nearly perfected herself in this accomplishment , she is driven from it by the sight and sound of a slow fly , rocking top - heavily under a gigantic dress - basket , which is making for her gate . Sarah is here , and she will not be at the door to welcome her . The thought lends wings to her young heels , and the colour and the smile that she has been vainly aiming at , to her cheeks and lips . Five minutes ago she did not think that anything could have caused her such a throb of pleasure as the dear old sound of that jovial high laugh , as the sight of that Dresden china face and of those monstrously irrational shoes are now giving her . When they lived together , they seldom or never kissed each other . Now they can not hold each other tight enough . Is it only Sarah that Belinda is kissing ? Is not it dead youth , dear love , sweet Wesenstein , too , that she is so straitly embracing ? Over the souls of both sisters — the sad elder and the radiant younger — the recollection of their last miserable parting on that hideous January morning has poured ! For a moment or two neither of them could have uttered a syllable , had you paid them a thousand pounds a word . They are brought back to common life by the sound of very small jingling bells , and by a sensation as of something tightly wound round their legs . It is Punch , who , unmindful of the chain that has bound him all the way down from London , and delighted to be again in the fresh air and among friends , is tearing wildly round , offering eager but unreciprocated greetings to Slutty , who , dodging away from him , shrewish and snarling , practically refuses to admit him as an acquaintance at all . "
90562	90594	90560	90560	Punch	186	" says Belinda , with a rather unsteady laugh , dropping on her knees , taking the excited little dog under the arms , and looking kindly in his Ethiop face ; "
90605	90606	90607	90607	I	0	" "
90615	90620	90622	90622	he	186	" replies Sarah demurely ; "
90665	90678	90662	90662	you	186	" with the old wheedling in her voice and her saucy eyes . "
90683	90709	90662	90662	you	186	" repeats Belinda , with a reproachful yet apprehensive stress upon the pronoun , passing her lips lightly over the top of his tawny head . "
90719	90720	90722	90722	he	186	" "
90725	90759	90722	90722	he	186	" inquires Sarah , speaking very low , and mouthing a good deal , as though labouring under a misgiving that the person of whom she speaks is in hiding behind the door . "
90767	90787	90760	90760	He	186	" answers Belinda evasively , her face suddenly darkening as if a light had been blown out in it . "
90800	90801	90798	90798	Slutty	157	" "
90806	90821	90798	90798	Slutty	157	" says Sarah , pulling a long face , and with a low whistle ; "
90835	90908	90798	90798	Slutty	157	" Belinda is saved from the necessity of answering a question , her reply to which must have been either an incivility or a lie , by the fact that they have now entered the house , and that her sister 's roving eyes and attention are claimed by other objects . Preceded by the dogs , Slutty churlishly growling , and Punch animatedly sniffing , they reach the drawing - room . "
90915	90923	90798	90798	Slutty	157	" says Sarah patronizingly , looking round ; "
90935	90936	90937	90938	Mr. Forth	209	" "
90946	90954	90955	90956	Mr. Forth	209	" The other breaks into a laugh . "
90971	90972	90976	90976	he	209	" "
90979	90987	90988	90988	he	209	" says Belinda , with stiff embarrassment ; "
91006	91007	90998	90998	He	209	" "
91016	91021	91008	91008	I	0	" says Sarah firmly ; "
91037	91045	91026	91026	he	209	" Mr. Forth 's wife laughs grimly . "
91058	91123	91026	91026	he	209	" There is such a bitter dryness in the quasi - playfulness of her tone that Sarah stops suddenly short in her critical survey of the early English chairs , and the Albert Düurer etchings , in which Oxbridge drawing - rooms delight ; and focussing her elder with her two insistant eyes , says , taking her the while firmly by both wrists : "
91143	91160	91161	91161	You	0	" But Belinda shakes off the small strong hands as Samson shook off the tough withes . "
91170	91191	91192	91192	you	0	" she cries , beginning to talk rapidly and rather loudly , and absolutely ignoring the question addressed to her ; "
91225	91249	91211	91211	you	0	" Sarah does not press the subject so obviously avoided , but as she follows her sister upstairs she repeatedly shakes her head . "
91255	91272	91211	91211	you	0	" says Belinda , as they reach the landing , throwing open doors as she speaks . "
91277	91322	91211	91211	you	0	" ( with a slight hesitation before the pronoun , that shows that only the dread of a repetition of her sister 's ridicule has kept her from designating her husband by the formal style and title which she habitually employs towards him ) ; "
91326	91339	91342	91344	old Mrs. Forth	271	" ( not opening , but simply indicating a third door ) , "
91347	91348	91342	91344	old Mrs. Forth	271	" "
91360	91365	91342	91344	old Mrs. Forth	271	" cries Sarah eagerly ; "
91399	91400	91396	91397	a mother	711	" "
91407	91419	91420	91420	she	2549	" replies Belinda , not offering to comply with this request ; "
91429	91430	91420	91420	she	2549	" "
91441	91446	91438	91439	each other	469	" cries Sarah delightedly ; "
91455	91476	91449	91449	she	2549	" arching her eyebrows till they almost meet , and are lost in her hair . Belinda nods in acquiescence , "
91485	91486	91479	91479	she	2549	" "
91489	91490	91479	91479	she	2549	" "
91498	91499	91493	91493	you	0	" "
91523	91576	91513	91513	I	0	" There is such a weary , devil - may - carishness in her tone , that again her sister 's eyes flash investigatingly upon her ; but this time Belinda has been too quick for her , and , avoiding their scrutiny , is doing the honours of a fourth room . "
91582	91610	91580	91580	yours	0	" she says , a smile such as the one with which she had welcomed her sister sweetening and gentling the now habitual sullenness of her face ; "
91619	91620	91580	91580	yours	0	" "
91631	91646	91623	91623	you	0	" cries Sarah , burying her face in a bowl of freshly picked narcissus . "
91660	91661	91662	91663	Mr. Forth	209	" "
91670	91696	91662	91663	Mr. Forth	209	" replies Belinda . She says it in a tame level voice ; not as making a complaint , but simply as stating a fact . "
91706	91756	91697	91697	He	209	" says Sarah drily . Belinda lets the remark fall upon silence . Dinner has been early , and is over . The sisters stand , each cooling a fiery cheek against the woodwork of the drawing - room window , while the latest blackbird is singing his version of "
91767	91783	91761	91762	my God	1526	" and the laburnum 's lithe bunches hang yellow against almost as yellow a sunset . "
91791	91819	91785	91785	he	209	" asks Sarah , greedily thrusting out her head into the cool greenness of the very respectably grown clematis and jessamine that climb the house - wall . "
91822	91823	91785	91785	he	209	" "
91849	91850	91851	91851	You	0	" "
91872	91880	91851	91851	You	0	" replies Belinda , with stony quiet . "
91887	91902	91920	91920	I	0	" continues Sarah , heaving her white chest in a deep and vigorous inhalation , "
91951	91952	91953	91953	You	0	" "
91964	91974	91953	91953	You	0	" replies Belinda , with a short sarcastic laugh . "
91979	92000	92001	92001	I	0	" replies Sarah a little blankly , and for once in her life making no attempt at repartee or explanation . "
92005	92009	91953	91953	You	0	" But the next moment—"How
92015	92020	91953	91953	You	0	" cries she joyously . "
92068	92071	91953	91953	You	0	" pompously , "
92079	92080	91953	91953	You	0	" "
92084	92089	91953	91953	You	0	" replies Belinda expressively . "
92098	92103	92107	92107	you	0	" continues Sarah confidentially ; "
92152	92156	92145	92145	she	359	" Belinda laughs . "
92164	92175	92177	92177	you	0	" resumes Sarah in a voice of the extremest exhilaration , "
92205	92206	92201	92201	they	354	" "
92211	92232	92201	92201	they	354	" replies Belinda dubiously , scanning affectionately from head to foot the seductive but not altogether academic figure before her ; "
92237	92238	92201	92201	they	354	" "
92247	92252	92242	92242	they	1538	" says Sarah philosophically . "
92264	92265	92254	92254	one	373	" "
92275	92280	92254	92254	one	373	" interposes Belinda ironically . "
92303	92304	92254	92254	one	373	" "
92307	92316	92254	92254	one	373	" in a by no means confident tone . "
92329	92334	92326	92326	I	0	" says Sarah thoughtfully . "
92347	92355	92341	92341	you	0	" Belinda shrugs her handsome shoulders indifferently . "
92388	92396	92377	92377	I	0	" she adds with a bitter smile . "
92411	92412	92405	92405	I	0	" "
92419	92424	92365	92365	they	1541	" says Sarah piously : "
92438	92498	92502	92502	they	1540	" Belinda has moved to the middle of the room , and is occupied in pulling down the central gas - jet , and lowering the gas , harshly glaring under its globes . Her pose — wreathed head thrown back , and long bare arm roundly lifted — brings into evidence the finest curves of her noble figure . "
92510	92526	92531	92531	they	1540	" asks Sarah , in a voice of affectionate incredulity . Belinda shakes her head . "
92538	92545	92502	92502	they	1540	" with a gesture of recollection ; "
92602	92603	92554	92554	I	0	" "
92608	92614	92554	92554	I	0	" repeats Sarah , giggling ; "
92628	92662	92663	92663	I	0	" She is still chuckling , when the opening door admits her brother - in - law . At once her chuckle has an inclination to die , but she bravely resists it . "
92668	92678	92663	92663	I	0	" she says , going boldly up to him . "
92715	92779	92780	92780	I	0	" It is certainly well to be on easy terms with your brother - in - law ; but , in a case so exceptional as that of Miss Churchill , it is perhaps hardly wise to address him with an alluring archness that may remind him of former disasters . At all events , in the present case it is not successful . "
92792	92802	92787	92787	you	272	" he says sourly , turning on his heel . "
92832	93081	93084	93084	you	1548	" There is something in his tone so unequivocally unplayful , thàt Sarah slinks away snubbed , and for the moment robbed of all her little airs and graces ; and Belinda rises with rebellious slowness , flame in her eye and revolt in her nether lip , to render the grudging aid demanded of her . As her reluctant hand holds the gown for her husband to put on , they both find themselves unintentionally standing plump and full before a rather large mirror , inevitably facing their own figures , thus brought into sudden juxtaposition . Belinda is in gala - dress . In honour of the Duke , and for the first time since her marriage , Oxbridge is to see her neck and shoulders . Upon their smooth sea of cream , unbroken by any trifling necklet — a sea that flows unrippled over the small collar - bones — the gas - lamps throw satin reflets ; a little chaplet of seasonable cowslips clasps her well - set head , and wrath has borrowed love 's red pennon and planted it in her cheeks . She looks a magnificent embodiment of youth and vigour , dwarfing into yet meaner insignificance the parched figure beside her . Mrs. Forth casts one pregnant look at the two reflections , and then hearing , or feigning to hear , a sound of suppressed mirth behind her , she says , in a clear , incisive voice : "
93107	93549	93096	93096	you	1548	" She lays a slight but cruel accent on the noun . Pair , indeed ! From Fate 's strangely jumbled bag were never two such odd ones sorted out before . The Professor has turned sharply away , but not before his wife has had the satisfaction of seeing that her shot has told ; but Sarah maintains a scared silence . The fly is late in arriving . Probably it has had many freights to take up and put down on this festal night before the Forths ' turn comes . At length , however , and just as Sarah is beginning wistfully to interrogate her Louis Quinze shoes as to their powers of reaching St. Ursula and H. R. H. on foot , it drives up , and they all get in . Possibly Belinda , though she makes no approaches towards a verbal amende , may be remorseful for her spurt of malevolence . At all events , she offers no objection to the raising of the window on her side ; nor does she , even by a pardonable gasp or two , or an obtruded fanning , resent the insult to the summer night . The lateness of their fly has retarded them so much , that instead of being first at the rendezvous , as is the Professor 's usual habit , they see , on reaching St. Ursula 's , the great quadrangle that the proudest churchman built filled with every carriage and bath - chair that Oxbridge 's modest mews can boast ; filled , too , with capped men and hooded women , hurrying to the goal . They have trodden the low - stepped stone stairs , along whose side lie unwonted banks of green moss that smells of cool , woodland places , planted with young field flowers ; have passed the one slender shaft that , upspringing , bears the vaulted roof , and its loveliest stone fans , and have entered the lordly hall , where Elizabeth Tudor once saw Masks , and where one of the sons of her latest successor is listening with a courteous patience , probably superior to hers , to such improvements upon the barbarous Mask and obsolete Allegory as the nineteenth century , rich in the spoils of its eighteen grandfathers , can afford him . In the present instance , the substitute offered is a tale told , not by an idiot , but by an excessively hot young man , striking occasionally sensational chords on the piano , at which he is seated upon the raised daïs , where the "
93552	93843	93844	93844	You	1550	" table is wo nt to stand — a monstrously long tale about a signalman , who , while busied in working his points , sees his infant , through some glaring domestic mismanagement , staggering across the metals at the precise moment when an express train is due . The struggle between his emotions as a parent and as a pointsman is so mercilessly protracted , that the audience , unable to bear the prolonged strain upon their feelings , are relieving themselves by a good deal of sotto voce , or not quite sotto voce conversation . But the Prince sits immovably polite , not permitting himself even one aside to his sémillante hostess , who , all loyal smiles , is posed in glory on a chair in the front rank beside him . Large as is the assemblage , so nobly proportioned is the great room , that there is no crowd . Every woman has put on her best gown ; and every woman has the satisfaction of thinking that every other woman has seen , is seeing , or will fully see it ; not , indeed , to do them justice , that this is a consideration much likely to engage the attention of the Oxbridge ladies . Thanks to the height of the carved oak roof , whither the vapours can ascend , below it is cool and fragrant . With the one emphatic exception of the detailer of the signalman 's perplexities , scarce one of the living guests has a more heated air than the brave line of judges , bishops , philosophers , premiers — St. Ursula 's dead glories — looking down in painted tranquillity from the walls . "
93872	93918	93866	93866	I	0	" says Sarah , in a flutter of pleasure , looking beamingly round on the , to her , eccentric throng of black - gowned M.A. 's , with their flat college caps tucked under their arms ; of velvet - sleeved proctors , etc . "
93928	93936	93866	93866	I	0	" says Belinda , in serious dissuasion , "
93949	94018	93938	93938	you	1550	" Sarah shrugs her white shoulders . She is so clamorous to be presented to everyone , that Belinda , after patiently pointing out to her , and , where feasible , making her personally acquainted with the owners of many of the local , all the half - dozen national , and the one or two European reputations that grace the room , at length strikes work . "
94023	94027	93938	93938	you	1550	" she says . "
94036	94037	94033	94034	Miss Watson	147	" "
94040	94053	94142	94142	you	1550	" cries Sarah , with a shudder that is not all affectation , "
94073	94140	94068	94068	her	147	" The room is fuller than it was . About the door , indeed , and the lower part of the hall , circulation is still easy ; but who would be content with elbow - room at a lower end , when the sight of a genuine live English royal Duke — no dubious Serene German — is to be fought for at the upper ? "
94150	94295	94142	94142	you	1550	" says Belinda , with that irony now so frequently assumed by her , as they , too , push and jostle their forward way . They have to push and jostle for themselves . Immediately upon their entry , their natural pusher and jostler , the Professor , has quitted them for associates more akin in age and conformable in tastes than the two handsome girls assigned by a sarcastic Providence to his jurisdiction . As they so work slowly forwards , gaining a step a minute , they are conscious of a disturbed heaving of the wave of humanity behind them — as when the ocean is ploughed by some puissant steamer , or monstrous shark . At the same instant a familiar voice , whose accents Sarah had already but too truly caught , breaks in brazen certainty upon their ears : "
94358	94450	94453	94453	her	1556	" The loud voice grows nearer , the wave - like swell heavier . She is close behind them now . Belinda has turned white and sick . That dreadful voice ! Even here , on this hot May night , in the thick festal crowd , of what power is it to re - create for her that miserable fog - stained Christmas morning , on which , in her madness , she had allowed a few senseless words uttered by that brutal voice to seal her doom for her . "
94455	94467	94468	94468	I	0	" she says , in a choked whisper to her sister . "
94472	94473	94468	94468	I	0	" "
94479	94506	94468	94468	I	0	" rejoins the other , hastily putting into practice her own precept , and burying her nose in the lilies of the valley on her breast ; "
94514	94540	94541	94541	Belinda	134	" But when did Miss Watson ever fail to see anyone ? One final oaring of her powerful arm has brought her alongside of them . "
94545	94568	94571	94571	you	135	" she cries loudly , seeing that her mere presence , although sufficiently obvious , has apparently failed to attract their attention ; "
94674	94714	94660	94660	I	0	" She pauses out of breath , and looks eagerly onwards towards the spot where , beyond his mother 's struggling lieges , the Prince sits , cool and civil , with his suite on their row of chairs . "
94726	94731	94715	94715	I	0	" pursues she volubly ; "
94827	94952	94953	94953	She	1565	" The last few words are thrown back over her shoulder , as she has already resumed her vigorous fight onwards . With fascinated eyes they watch her athlete 's progress to the front . The human billows part before her . The crowd lies behind her . She has reached smooth water and the Prince . The signalman 's troubles are by this time drawing to their close . His rosy babe has been found lying smiling on the line ; the express train having , contrary to its usual habit , passed over the pretty innocent without inflicting a scratch . Most people draw a long breath ; but whether at the babe 's immunity or their own , who shall decide ? "
94962	95045	94960	94960	her	1565	" says Sarah , in a shocked voice , standing on tiptoe , and stretching her neck . It is too true . In defiance of etiquette and despite the horrified look of the hostess , Miss Watson is warmly grasping her Duke 's hand . Against the background of wall and chairs her figure stands out plainly silhouetted — fringe , garish evening - dress , and hot red neck ! To their ears come even fragments of her resonant speech : "
95051	95052	94960	94960	her	1565	" "
95055	95056	94960	94960	her	1565	" "
95061	95062	95057	95059	Sea - sick	1570	" "
95070	95299	95300	95300	Belinda	134	" says Belinda , in a spent voice . This is easier said than done . By slow degrees , however , they succeed in edging out of the crowd ; and are lucky enough to find an unoccupied sofa , upon which Belinda seats herself ; and whither , presently , various of her acquaintance come and exchange remarks with her upon the success of the entertainment , the excellence of the supper , the affability of the Prince , etc . In one of the intervals between two of these fragments of conversation she perceives that her charge has left her side ; but it requires no very distant excursion of the eye to discover her standing at the supper - table , an ice in her hand , having , by the agency of one of her just - made acquaintance , effected an introduction to a good - looking undergraduate , who in return is presenting to her a second , who in his turn will obviously present to her a third and a fourth . A little mob of young men is beginning to gather round her . A moment more , and , her ice finished , followed by her cortège , Sarah returns to her sister , winking so deftly as to be invisible to the outer world as she comes . "
95302	95306	95300	95300	Belinda	134	" she says , "
95325	95336	95338	95339	Mr. Stanley	283	" ( an indistinct disclaimer from the blushing Bellairs ) ; "
95367	95422	95348	95350	Mr. De Lisle	284	" Belinda laughs slightly , amused at the glibness with which her sister has already mastered her new admirers ' names . She has risen to her feet again — Professor Forth 's wife — the stern - faced beauty whom in their walks and talks the boys have often with distant awe admired . "
95427	95437	95423	95423	I	0	" she says , with a sweet cold smile , "
95453	95528	95448	95448	I	0	" She is a tall woman , and her eyes are on a level with Bellairs ' . She can , therefore , easily look over his shoulder . What sight is it so seen that makes her stop suddenly in mid - speech , with a catch in her breath ? The pause is but short . Almost before her auditors have had time to notice the hiatus , it is filled up . "
95551	95594	95529	95529	I	0	" Her words are perfectly collected ; but surely she is far , far paler than she was when she began to speak ; and though her sentences are addressed to the young men , her eyes are wandering oddly beyond them . "
95608	95624	95601	95602	the woman	1573	" Stanley says confidentially to Bellairs , as they walk home together in the moonlight . "
95644	95645	95628	95628	her	1573	" "
95650	95684	95628	95628	her	1573	" growls Bellairs , who finds it not impossible to combine a poignant interest in Sarah with a servile moth - and - candle - like homage to the elder and severer beauty ; "
95699	96563	95695	95697	an old mummy	1575	" And what was it Mrs. Forth saw over Bellairs ' shoulder ? What is the sight that , now that the temporary call upon her attention is withdrawn , is riveting into such an agony of search the lovely cold eyes , to which so few things seem worth looking at ? Fortunately for her , a new batch of under - graduates has hurried up to be presented to Sarah . Never since the days of Dresden and the German army has Miss Churchill had her hands so full . Belinda is free to send her gaze unnoticed round the hall , in a silent , breathless , passionate quest . Quest of what ? She does not ask herself how much the better off she will be if she succeeds in finding the object of that quest . To find it ! to find it ! Come what may of the finding , to find it ! Most people would feel sure that she has been deceived by an accidental resemblance to Rivers in some stranger ; men of his size , complexion and bearing being , though unhappily in a minority , yet still numerous among two thousand youths of the English upper classes . But Belinda would laugh to scorn the suggestion that at any distance , or in any glimpse however momentary , she could have mistaken any other for him . There exists in her mind no smallest doubt that the face seen in that one lightning - flash , and then instantly hidden by twenty other intervening faces , was his — his or his angle 's ! Perhaps he is dead , and that he has come to tell her . A mute sob rises in her throat . Whether in the spirit or the body , she must find him ! At intervals of every few minutes she is interrupted in her search by the greetings and observations of passing acquaintances . She answers them politely and connectedly , but with a brevity that does not encourage a prolongation of their civilities ; a brevity that will the sooner leave her free . The room is thinner than it was , or rather the crowd is distributed more evenly over its whole area . Since the suppertables sprang into sight — even loyalty giving the pas to hunger ; the uncertain hope of a bow from the Duke , to the sober certainty of lobster - salad — the packing about H.R.H. is less dense . The guests are extended along the line of tables . Of Sarah , indeed , scarcely a vestige is to be seen , so closely is she hedged in by a wall of boys . At something she has just said they all laugh rapturously ; those who did not hear it — so firmly assured already in her character as a wit — as well as those who did . The signalman 's biographer has descended from his estrade , and is talking as commonplacely to his hostess as if he wotted nothing of parental agonies or points , and as if the rosy babe had been sent to bed with the whipping it deserved . Through the slackening of the press it has surely become easier for one seeking to discover the person sought ; and yet for a while she seeks in vain . How many heads there are ! heads bald as Cæsar 's ; heads thickly clad as Absolom 's ; heads white , heads brown ; sandy heads , pepper and salt heads , gold heads ; long heads , round heads , knobby heads ! And how they shift and move ! Will they never stay quiet for a moment ? And among them all he is not ! He must have gone — gone without ever conjecturing her nearness ! Again that mute sob rises chokingly . Why should he not be gone ? Why should she wish that he were not gone ? Why should she wish to see him ? What has she to say to him when they meet ? But she pushes roughly aside Reason 's cool pleading . Why does she wish it ? Why — why ? There may be no why , but she does wish it ; wishes it with such a compelling frenzy of wishing , as seems as if it must produce the fulfilment of that wish . And it does . Its might prevails . Ah — h — h ! For in a moment she has seen him again . He is nearer now ; so near as to be recognizable past mistake or misgiving , even by eyes less acquainted than hers with every trick of lip and brow . If he continues to advance in the direction at present taken by his steps , it is impossible but that in one minute or less — in perhaps fifty seconds , perhaps forty — she will come within the range of his vision . He will be aware of her as she is aware of him . "
96571	96610	95695	95697	an old mummy	1575	" says a voice at her elbow . She turns suddenly ; eyes alight , and heart madly bounding , to find her husband at her elbow . The revulsion is so hideous that speech wholly fails her . "
96629	96651	96616	96616	you	1576	" he continues , taking her silence for assent , since she is never very prodigal of her words to him ; "
96664	96672	96657	96657	her	3060	" But at that she finds voice . "
96675	96688	96657	96657	her	3060	" she says , flashing one look of passionate dissent at him . "
96696	96697	96698	96698	I	0	" "
96703	96708	96698	96698	I	0	" he answers captiously ; "
96741	96742	96746	96746	you	0	" "
96750	96758	96746	96746	you	0	" answers she , with tremulous rebellion . "
96798	96799	96800	96800	I	0	" "
96820	96825	96771	96771	You	1576	" rejoins he persistently ; "
96829	96846	96847	96847	she	3060	" with a slightly venomous look in the direction of his sister - in - law , "
96852	96915	96847	96847	she	3060	" But Belinda only observes a silence which he divines to be mutinous . He is accustomed in her to sullen compliance , uncheerful acquiescence , loth obedience ; but to open revolt he is not accustomed , and , on the spur of the moment , and in so public a place , he is not prepared to deal with it . "
96928	96933	96934	96934	I	0	" he says resentfully , "
96968	97364	97365	97365	I	0	" He does not await the answer , which perhaps he knows he would not receive ; but turns on his heel and leaves her — leaves her free to pursue that feverish search which his coming had so rudely interrupted . It is some moments before she again finds the object of that search ; moments long enough for her to tell herself in heart bitterness that she has pushed against her fate in vain . But then , all in a moment , she has found him again . He is further off , indeed , than he was : some trifle must have diverted his steps from the direction then pursued by them ; and he is still , in his unconsciousness , slowly widening the distance between them . Is it possible that he is tending towards the door ? that she , unable by word or sign to arrest him , will see him go ? Oh , but life is a hard thing ! Knowing as she does that at one lightest cry from her he would turn ; to be no more able to utter that cry than if a real material gag were choking her utterances ! Can it be , then , that her soul 's cry has reached his soul 's ears ? for he does turn suddenly and smiling . Has he seen her , that he smiles ? Ah no ! Would he indeed smile if he saw her ? She has not given him much cause to smile at the sight of her . Well , he is wise . He has again averted his look . And the half - hour , the inexorable half - hour is passing ! How much of it has already gone ? Ten minutes , at least , must by this time have passed . There are only twenty minutes for hope to work upon . Twenty minutes!—and then the close fly , the Early English Villa , Professor Forth , and the Fragments of Menander ! To the end of time Professor Forth , and the Fragments of Menander ! Again her thoughts are broken in upon by a voice — Sarah 's this time ; Sarah having shaken herself free of her disciples ; Sarah with a solicitous look and an anxious eye . "
97373	97392	97365	97365	I	0	" she says hurriedly , and narrowly watching the effect of her words upon her sister 's face ; "
97424	97425	97420	97420	he	3677	" "
97430	97439	97440	97440	You	1582	" answers Belinda shortly , and very low . "
97449	97450	97442	97442	you	1582	" "
97458	97477	97440	97440	You	1582	" with an accent of intense impatience , her eyes still riveted on the now again approaching figure ; "
97483	97484	97440	97440	You	1582	" "
97492	97493	97486	97486	you	1582	" "
97497	97508	97511	97511	you	1587	" echoes Belinda , in an accent of fierce desperation ; "
97529	97530	97520	97520	you	1587	" "
97538	97543	97533	97533	you	1582	" replies Sarah anxiously . "
97562	97848	97555	97555	you	1582	" But she speaks to deaf ears . Her eyes , still fastened on her sister 's face , see that face 's lilies suddenly dyed with a most happy and loveliest flush . The sun has risen : he has touched the sunless snow on the Jungfrau 's crest , and all the world is rosy red . So then he has seen her ! There is now no longer any fear of his departing unintentionally ignorant of her neighbourhood . There is indeed time for one short pang of alarm lest he should do what in her heart she knows if he were wise he would do — and who knows how much of wisdom these two years may have lent him?—turn away , and knowingly avoid her ! But apparently he is not wise . In a moment he has pierced the small portion of crowd that still separates them ; pierced it with a goodwill that would not have disgraced Miss Watson . She has one instant of such blissful anticipation — only a thousandfold intensified — as used to be hers in the Lüttichau Strasse , at the sound of Tommy 's childish foot pattering up the stone stairs , and her love 's firm and eager tread behind it . The next moment they have met . Their unfamiliar right hands lie in one another ; and they say — nothing . Of what use to have mesmerized him hither by her eyes , and the insanity of her voiceless prayers , if she have nothing to say to him now that he has come ? But happily , though she and he are speecheless , Sarah is not . "
97857	97865	97852	97852	you	1590	" she says in a dry voice . "
97875	97895	97896	97896	I	0	" He does not answer at once . Evidently , as of old , he has forgotten her presence . "
97910	97929	97899	97899	you	1590	" pursues she , running quickly on with a fightiness that conceals a good deal of real nervousness ; "
97985	98009	98011	98011	they	1591	" Belinda is struggling to rouse herself out of her intoxication ; already so far unintoxicated as to know that it is intoxication . "
98013	98022	98011	98011	they	1591	" she says , with a weakly laugh ; "
98035	98036	98027	98027	I	0	" "
98045	98098	98027	98027	I	0	" asks Sarah persistently , carrying on her determined talk as a shield to her sister 's emotion . Her speech has the effect of making Rivers , too , put down the wine - cup ; of bringing him also back to the bald , sober , morning prose of life . "
98107	98111	98099	98099	I	0	" he answers ; "
98125	98199	98112	98112	I	0	" So now she has heard his voice ! To have touched his hand ; to have met his eye ; to have heard his speech ! Is not this to have had her wish ? Surely now she is content . Surely now she will go home at ease and satisfied . But who was ever satisfied with one wish ? What wish ever died barren , without engendering a hundred more ? "
98207	98252	98112	98112	I	0	" says a voice . The Dresden quartette is complete . Perhaps it is this thought that , rushing simultaneously into three out of the four minds , strikes them momentarily mute . Sarah is , of course , the first to recover herself . "
98258	98268	98294	98295	Mr. Forth	209	" she says , with rather a forced gaiety ; "
98306	98421	98294	98295	Mr. Forth	209	" There is a slight unintentional hesitation before pronouncing , and a perhaps intentional slight stress in pronouncing , the last word . Rivers has stepped back a pace or two , isolating himself from the augmented group ; but at this summons he again advances , and , except by the two signs of a sheet - white face and set teeth , is not to be distinguished from any other well - mannered young man making a bow . But the Professor would be slow indeed to mark the hue of any undergraduate 's , or ex - undergraduate 's face , or to note whether his mouth were open or shut . "
98427	98439	98440	98440	Belinda	134	" he says , returning Rivers 's salutation with cursory indifference . "
98458	98484	98445	98445	you	134	" As he speaks , he looks at his wife , as one expecting and braced for fresh rebellion . But he meets with none . "
98488	98494	98504	98504	Belinda	134	" cries Sarah with alacrity ; "
98526	98837	98504	98504	Belinda	134	" nodding with cool friendliness over her shoulder , and taking her sister 's hand . Belinda offers no resistance ; flaccidly she complies , and without one look at Rivers , with only a faint bend of her head in his direction , begins to follow the Professor of Etruscan out of the room . Rivers stands stupidly looking after them . The tart imperativeness of her husband 's tone ; his employment of her Christian name ; her own dull docility — which of these is it that makes him feel as if some one had given him a great blow over the head with a club ? Presently he begins , mechanically and purposelessly , to follow them . The crowd is thick at the entrance and on the stone stairs — the departing crowd . The quadrangle is full of vehicles . Footmen are few in Oxbridge ; but such as there are , are shouting their mistresses ' carriages : the humbler multitude are pushing , asking , struggling for their flies . Lucky ones are finding them and driving off : unlucky ones are vainly striving to identify horse or driver . Among the latter are the Forths . In coming out , they have been parted by the press — that is to say , the sisters have lost each other — the younger loitering in injudicious dalliance with some of her new sweethearts ; the elder plodding on in dull and woolly oblivion of all but the iron necessity of following that cap and gown ahead of her . It is not till the elusive fly is at length found — till her foot is on the step , and Professor Forth is sharply urging her in by the elbow from behind , that she becomes aware of having mislaid her junior . "
98844	98849	98504	98504	Belinda	134	" cries he crossly ; "
98856	98857	98852	98852	you	1595	" "
98861	98874	98504	98504	Belinda	134	" she says , awaking from her unconsciousness and looking hastily round ; "
98888	98895	98886	98886	Sarah	135	" He makes an irritated gesture . "
98929	98930	98886	98886	Sarah	135	" "
98941	98953	98886	98886	Sarah	135	" replies she firmly , withdrawing her foot from the step ; "
98964	98965	98957	98957	you	1598	" "
98977	98989	98957	98957	you	1598	" retorts he , recurring to his old and spiteful formula ; "
98998	98999	98990	98990	she	135	" "
99011	99307	99308	99308	You	1602	" answers she indignantly , and resolutely turning her back upon him and the open fly - door . She is too indignant even to deign to observe whether he takes her at her word . The crowd is still issuing , issuing ; crossing the moonlit square on foot ; nodding good - night out of carriage windows ; away they go ! She retraces her steps to the stair - foot . It is not pleasant work pushing against a human tide ; and so she finds . It is bewildering to be staring into every face ; peering under all the hoods and mufflers . And among all the faces , under all the hoods and mufflers , is no Sarah to be found . It is obvious that the Professor is right . She has found her own way home . The company is melting away so rapidly that , unless she wishes to be shut into the college for the night , she must needs follow her example . Well ! there is no great hardship in that ! She is in the mood when the abnormal , the unusal , seems more tolerable to her than the accustomed , the everyday . Half an hour of solitude and midnight ! Half an hour in which to be Belinda only — not Belinda Forth at all ! Half an hour in which to reckon with this night and its work ! She has already made half a dozen steps along the stone flags of the quadrangle , when some one comes up behind her . Had she known that he would come up behind her , that she makes no sign of surprise , nor any pause in her walk ? "
99312	99318	99308	99308	You	1602	" he says with agitation . "
99323	99346	99308	99308	You	1602	" she answers . It is the same dry voice with which she had so often galled and chilled him at Dresden . "
99355	99356	99357	99357	I	0	" "
99362	99363	99365	99365	your	1602	" "
99371	99372	99373	99373	He	1604	" "
99386	99387	99368	99369	Professor Forth	1604	" "
99397	99409	99389	99389	he	1604	" She is silent , still speeding along in the moonlight . "
99419	99431	99413	99413	you	1602	" he asks , keeping up with and determinately addressing her . "
99442	99443	99439	99439	I	0	" "
99449	99450	99444	99444	You	1602	" "
99456	99481	99444	99444	You	1602	" Her tone is brusque and dogged ; but if she hopes by its means to rid herself of her companion she is mistaken . "
99486	99487	99444	99444	You	1602	" "
99490	99499	99507	99508	nous autres	1608	" she says , with a hard laugh ; "
99521	99522	99510	99510	I	0	" "
99527	99532	99510	99510	I	0	" Her face darkens . "
99538	99574	99510	99510	I	0	" They have reached the gateway and Wren 's domey tower . She has stopped in her resolute walk ; but in the stopping there is as much resolution as there was in the hurrying . "
99579	99584	99510	99510	I	0	" she says shortly ; "
99589	99590	99591	99591	You	1602	" "
99600	99605	99591	99591	You	1602	" he answers firmly . "
99617	99707	99606	99606	I	0	" retorts she roughly . There is an instant 's interval before his rejoinder . They are putting out the lights in the hall ; the great building is greedily devouring half the moonlight in the quad , with its raven shadow . It has embraced the fountain in the middle . It is not much of a fountain , but how pleasantly its little voice pierces through the noise of rolling wheels and human shoutings . For how many centuries could she gladly stand here listening to it ! "
99713	99721	99722	99722	I	0	" with perfect respect , but obstinately . "
99726	99747	99722	99722	I	0	" Is the night - wind heady , like wine ? Her tone changes to one that is almost entreaty . "
99760	99776	99755	99755	I	0	" Her incivilities had left him iron ; to her pleading he is as wax . "
99784	100026	99781	99781	you	0	" he says , gravely bowing . There is nothing now to detain her , and yet she lingers an instant , as though expecting him to say something more . But he adds nothing . She turns out of the gateway and into the street , and walks fast and steadily up it . There are not many towns through which it would be judicious for a young and solitary woman to take her way , bare - headed and in flimsy ball - gown , at midnight ; but about Oxbridge , Una , without her lion , might have strayed unassailed from sunset to sunrise . Involuntarily she slackens her speed a little , from the almost run with which she had begun her course , though still keeping at a moderately rapid walk . What cause is there for hurry ? There is nothing now to hasten from ; and Heaven knows there is nothing to hasten to ! She did well to be peremptory ; but , after all , he was not very much in earnest ; he did not press the point . It is much better that it should be so ; but still , as a mere matter - of - fact , he did not . She looks up at the sky , which is spreading out the jewels it has kept hidden through the staring day , spreading them out for "
100035	100558	99781	99781	you	0	" to look up at and admire ; all its bright belts and bears ; its gods and goddesses . Then she looks suddenly round . There are still a good many people about , but no undergraduates ; for the University mother has gathered her curled darlings to her bosom for the night . The man , then , who is keeping pace with her , footstep for footstep , twenty yards behind , is no undergraduate . She redoubles her speed again . Pooh ! his presence has no reference to her . He is only taking the natural road to his hotel . But she does not look round again until the more bustling streets lie behind her ; until she has reached the broad still thoroughfare where a range of grey colleges and a row of sentinel elms hold quiet converse with the stars . Then , as if the muscles of her neck had been moved by some one else , she not consenting , once again she turns her head . The hotels are long passed . If he is still following , it is she whom he is following . And lo ! twenty yards behind her , there he is , stepping through the moonlight ! She gives a low , excited laugh . Well , they have both had their will then : he has not walked home with her ; she has not walked home alone . It is a compromise . Again she looks up to the heavens . What a lovely , lovely vault ! What seed - pearl of constellations ! What great planet - diamonds ! The clocks have just beun to strike midnight ; the city 's innumerous clocks , cathedral , college , church ; the booming bell , the sharp strike , the melodious chime ! How nobly their loud wedded harmony floods the night ! And is there one of the gardens — she has reached the suburb of villas and gardens by this time — that has not contributed the breath of its gillyflowers to make the boon air so sweet ? She walks on with her strong elastic tread . After all , it is good to be young : to have a fine ear for sound ; a nostril sensitive to fragrance ; and — the consciousness that behind you there is one protecting you where there is nothing to be protected from — guarding you where there is nothing to be guarded against . She has reached her own gate , and at it halts , her hand upon the latch . Here surely , under the ægis of her own roof - tree — here , where that twinkling night - light shows the exact spot where her husband is addressing himself to his slumbers — she may abate a little of her rigidity . Seeing her arrived , he too has halted ; nor is it until by a faint motion of her hand she gives him leave to approach , that he ventures to draw near her . "
100562	100582	100560	100560	you	1611	" she says with a smile , to which it is perhaps the moonlight that lends its quivering uncertainty ; "
100589	100652	100653	100653	I	0	" He neither disclaims nor accepts her acknowledgments . Gravely he unfastens the iron gate for her ; while above his gold head the laburnum droops her gold curls . The moon has taken their colour out of both , and substituted her own . Is he then still going to say nothing ? But as she passes through , he speaks : "
100675	100676	100678	100678	you	0	" "
100680	100685	100678	100678	you	0	" she says faintly . "
100699	100732	100734	100734	I	0	" he asks , while in the moonlight she sees his right hand tighten its nervous clasp on one of the spiked iron uprights of the gate . She is quite silent . "
100736	100775	100734	100734	I	0	" he repeats , in a tone as of one who , though patient , will not go without his answer . ( Is truth always the best to be spoken ? Then let it be spoken ! ) "
100778	100779	100734	100734	I	0	" "
100797	100811	100786	100786	I	0	" Silence again ; her look wandering undecidedly over her flower - bed . "
100815	100848	100786	100786	I	0	" Her eye has caught the Professor 's night - light again — that ill - favoured Jack - o'-Lantern that is to dance for ever across the morass of her life . "
100851	100860	100786	100786	I	0	" she answers firmly ; and with that firm "
100863	100868	100869	100869	He	1612	" she leaves him . "
100875	100880	100869	100869	He	1612	" says Sarah dispassionately , "
100909	101010	101011	101011	I	0	" It is next morning , and the girls are beginning the day with a preliminary saunter round the narrow bounds of the little garden , and the newly - mown tennis - ground . They are very small bounds , but within them is room for undried dew ; for a blackbird with a voice a hundred times bigger than its body ; for a guelder rose , a fine broom - bush , and a short - lived lilac . What more would you have ? Beneath one Turkey - red sunshade they stroll in slow contentment along . "
101018	101023	101011	101011	I	0	" continues Sarah complacently . "
101082	101083	101070	101070	they	2370	" "
101094	101099	101100	101100	They	2370	" asks Belinda drily . "
101107	101113	101100	101100	They	2370	" rejoins the other importantly . "
101126	101132	101121	101121	you	0	" breaking into a laugh ; "
101143	101249	101134	101134	I	0	" Belinda joins in the laugh ; nor is there any evidence of her mirth being less spontaneous and bubbling than her sister 's . Ahead of them the little dogs are frisking . At least , to speak more correctly , Punch is . What little frisk time and fat have left to Slutty has been stamped out of her by mortification at Punch 's reappearance on the scene . When you are no longer in your first youth , there is really not much amusement in having one of your hind - legs continually pulled , mouthed , and facetiously worried from behind . "
101253	101276	101251	101251	you	0	" says Sarah , standing on tip - toe to reach a lilac bough , and rub her face luxuriously against it ; "
101283	101297	101279	101279	you	0	" A red sunshade always diffuses a glow over the face beneath it . "
101303	101310	101300	101300	I	0	" with an assumption of inattention . "
101313	101345	101300	101300	I	0	" There is a second 's hesitation before the answer comes . Belinda is naturally veracious ; but , after all , there is nothing incompatible with literal veracity in answering : "
101350	101351	101300	101300	I	0	" "
101357	101389	101354	101354	you	0	" asks Sarah . Her tone is careless ; but she has loosed the lilac bough , and her shrewd eyes are — perhaps accidentally — bent upon her sister 's . "
101392	101429	101300	101300	I	0	" repeats Belinda , with an impatience that seems out of proportion to the occasion , eagerly following her junior 's example , and thrusting her hot cheeks among the cool and sugared lilac - clusters ; "
101449	101520	101521	101521	I	0	" But to this heated inquiry Sarah makes no answer ; a reticence which causes a feverish misgiving to dart across Belinda 's mind . But no ! her sister 's room looks towards the back . Sarah has an eye like a greyhound , an ear like a stag , and a nose like a truffle dog , but even she can not see and hear through deal boards . "
101532	101543	101521	101521	I	0	" she says , changing the subject with some precipitation ; "
101558	101564	101521	101521	I	0	" Sarah lifts her eyebrows . "
101581	101582	101571	101571	you	0	" "
101586	101592	101571	101571	you	0	" echoes the other ironically ; "
101606	101607	101604	101604	Menander	287	" "
101610	101611	101604	101604	Menander	287	" "
101617	101618	101604	101604	Menander	287	" "
101621	101622	101604	101604	Menander	287	" "
101635	101636	101604	101604	Menander	287	" "
101639	101640	101604	101604	Menander	287	" "
101644	101656	101642	101642	you	0	" says Belinda drily , beginning to walk towards the house . "
101662	101671	101672	101672	he	287	" cries Sarah irreverently , calling after her , "
101688	101692	101682	101682	I	0	" Belinda laughs . "
101695	101699	101682	101682	I	0	" she says ; "
101730	101764	101765	101765	You	0	" There is such a strong tincture of cheerfulness in the tone with which she speaks , it differs so widely from the dogged submission of yesterday , that Sarah eyes her suspiciously . "
101775	101789	101765	101765	You	0	" she says , with a streak of sarcasm . Belinda changes colour . "
101797	101802	101803	101803	I	0	" she says quickly . "
101825	101925	101814	101814	you	0	" But is it a matter of weather ? Is it the weather that sends her humming with irresistible gaiety to her desk and Menander ? Spring - time , it is true , is exhilarating ; morning is exhilarating ; life 's morning is exhilarating : why , then , should she not be exhilarated ? But is it of these three innocent stimulants only that she is drinking ? There must be something different from her wo nt in the very quality of her step as she enters her husband 's study , for he looks up . "
101930	101935	101926	101926	You	0	" he says briefly . "
101940	101945	101947	101947	I	0	" she answers pleasantly ; "
101957	102179	101947	101947	I	0	" She seats herself at her escritoire , forcibly and with difficulty swallowing down the end of the tune that she has been singing to herself , under her breath , all the way upstairs . Even the very room — the hated task - work room — looks different from what it ordinarily does . Usually it is quite sunless ; but this morning a long , slant dart of gold has squeezed itself in , taking no denial , and on it how the dust - motes are dancing ! Must everything dance to - day ? The Professor , at least , is an exception to the general rule . He shows no signs of any wish to dance . While dictating , he is in the habit of walking up and down . She knows the exact square in the carpet from which he will start , and that at which he will pause and turn . He has begun his diurnal course ; but there is a moment 's interval before the first words of the first sentence leave his lips . She pauses , pen in hand , awaiting them ; and as she pauses , following him with her eyes , a feeling of genuine and potent compassion passes through her heart and brain . "
102196	102197	102198	102198	I	0	" "
102201	102217	101947	101947	I	0	" she says , under this impulse , speaking in a gentle , hesitating voice , "
102241	102245	102237	102237	I	0	" laughing nervously , "
102282	102340	102341	102341	I	0	" The intention of this speech is excellent ; as a mere question of judgment and tact , it is doubtful whether it had not been wiser to have let her stinging jest lie , without resuscitating it even to repent of it . The expression of his face shows whether or no he has forgotten it . "
102344	102349	102341	102341	I	0	" he says aridly , "
102367	102797	102341	102341	I	0	" For a moment or two she bows her crimsoned face and bitten lips over her desk , in furious annoyance at having laid herself open to this self - inflicted humiliation . But , ere long , her serenity returns . It is only wounds inflicted by those we love whose sting lasts . After all , she has done her part ; she has made the amende . Of what least consequence is it how he has taken it ? But her compassion is dead . He may look as old , as pinched , as bloodless as he chooses . No smallest throb of pity stirs her heart again ; nor does any other word , unrelating to the subject of her labour , cross her lips . Through all the fresh bright morning hours , he travels from his one carpet - square to his other carpet - square , elaborating careful , classic phrases as he goes ; and she , in docile silence , follows him with her pen . The sun soars high ; the drowsy flies inside the shut window make their futile journeys up and down the pane . The swallows sweep across outside , bells ring , butchers and bakers drive up and drive away ; but not one of these distracting objects does she allow to beguile her for one instant of her toil . She will do her task - work conscientiously , thoroughly , wholly , so that hereafter neither he nor she herself may have anything to reproach her with ; and then , when it is ended — she allows herself one long breath of prospective enjoyment — why then the sun will still be high ; the swallows will still be darting ; the lengthy May afternoon , with probabilities too bright to be faced in its green lap , will still be hers . And , meanwhile , how well the pens write ! how clear her own apprehension seems ! She has even suggested a verbal emendation or two , which his nice ear has accepted . How quickly the morning is passing ! Can it indeed be a quarter to one that the College clocks are striking ? After all , there is no great hardship in being amanuensis to a savan afflicted with weak eyes ; it is a great matter to be able to be of use to some one ! She looks up , smiling rosily ; if not forgetful , forgiving , of her former snub . "
102807	102812	102813	102813	You	1622	" she says congratulatingly . "
102821	102822	102813	102813	You	1622	" "
102831	102836	102813	102813	You	1622	" replies he grudgingly , "
102848	102849	102851	102851	we	1621	" "
102853	102869	102851	102851	we	1621	" she says , a little blankly , rubbing her cramped right finger and thumb ; "
102878	102879	102851	102851	we	1621	" "
102887	102892	102893	102893	I	0	" rejoins he firmly . "
102940	102941	102893	102893	I	0	" "
102947	102952	102893	102893	I	0	" cries she feverishly ; "
102958	102982	102893	102893	I	0	" The smile and the short - lived roses have together left her face . She looks fagged and harried , but obstinate . "
102990	103000	102893	102893	I	0	" repeats he , regarding her with slow displeasure . "
103004	103006	102893	102893	I	0	" she says,—"You
103016	103017	103018	103018	She	1626	" "
103029	103034	103035	103035	she	1626	" replies he disagreeably ; "
103048	103049	103035	103035	she	1626	" "
103053	103085	103051	103051	I	0	" she says in a low voice , turning very white , and looking at him with concentrated dislike ( is it possible that she could ever have pitied him ? ) "
103110	103111	103112	103112	I	0	" "
103120	103125	103112	103112	I	0	" he answers frostily ; "
103157	103158	103186	103186	You	0	" "
103162	103185	103186	103186	You	0	" she says , hastily catching him up , while the dismissed carnation colour pours in flood back into her cheeks again . "
103191	103214	103186	103186	You	0	" He looks at her with such unfeigned and unadmiring astonishment in his cold eyes , that she turns away in confusion . "
103223	103228	103186	103186	You	0	" she asks faltering ; "
103240	103241	103186	103186	You	0	" "
103250	103725	103186	103186	You	0	" replies he , tranquilly leaving the room ; satisfied with her acquiescence , and indifferent as to the spirit in which that acquiescence has been given . The afternoon is three hours old , and Belinda still sits at her desk . The dew is dried , the long sunbeam has stolen away , but though it does not cheer her by its visible presence , she is aware , by the augmented heat of the close room , that the sun is beating hard and hotly on roof and wall . And on these thinly - built houses it does beat very hotly . At her side lies a heap of corrected slips , but before her is piled another , scarcely less bulky . She has been at work upon them for an hour and a half , and still she sees no end to her toil . Her head aches with long stooping ; she has inked her tired fingers , and her eyes are dull and dogged . Now and again the door - bell ringing makes her give a nervous start . Is it come again — that time of strained continuous listening ? those twenty - one months , during which all her life - power seemed to have passed into her ears ? It is the hour when visitors may be with the most probability expected . But is there not also a probability that they may be sent away again ? Sometimes , when harder worked or gloomier spirited than usual , she has bidden her servant deny her . Is it not but too possible that , seeing her close slavery of to - day , that servant may take upon herself to conclude that such is her mistress 's wish now also . The idea throws her into a fever . She does not listen . She makes an unaccountable mistake . Again the bell rings . Is it her fancy , or has this ring a different sound from the former ones ? Is there in it a mixture of violence and timidity , as of a person who had had to screw up his courage to ring at all in the first instance , and had then overdone it ? She writes on mechanically , dully aware that her husband is rebuking her for the illegibility of her last words . Even if the moral blows he is giving her were physical ones , she would feel them none the more . The door opens , and the servant enters , with a man 's card upon a salver . She scarcely needs to glance at it to tell that it is HIS ; but for a moment her pale lips can not frame the question that has sprung to them : "
103732	103733	103735	103735	he	1628	" "
103738	103763	103735	103735	he	1628	" she asks , stammering , taking the card , and , with a senseless , involuntary movement , hiding it in her hand . "
103774	103780	103782	103782	he	1628	" replies the maid apologetically ; "
103801	103816	103792	103792	I	0	" The Professor looks up , cross at the interruption , to give a brief "
103819	103827	103792	103792	I	0	" but his wife strikes athwart him . "
103832	103840	103792	103792	I	0	" she says , with precipitate decision . "
103853	103895	103850	103851	Miss Churchill	152	" She takes up her quill again , as the servant leaves the room , but apparently her hand shakes to a degree that is beyond her control ; for in a moment a great blot has defaced the printed page . "
103900	103906	103850	103851	Miss Churchill	152	" cries her husband fretfully . "
103915	103973	103907	103907	You	0	" She throws it down , and takes another . The room in which they are sitting is over the drawing - room . Evidently he has been ushered in , and Sarah has joined him ; for there is a murmur of voices . What are they saying ? What are they likely to be saying ? "
103982	103994	103996	103996	I	0	" says the Professor , in a voice of resentful wonder . "
103998	104006	103996	103996	I	0	" she answers , bewildered and inattentive . "
104015	104079	103996	103996	I	0	" The voices have grown more distinctly audible . They have left the drawing - room ; it is obvious that Sarah is taking him out into the garden — the pleasant , little , cool garden , with its blackbird and its broom - bush , and its bees . She draws a hot , long , envious breath at the thought . "
104097	104168	104080	104085	A child of five years old	1631	" resumes he , taking the sheet from before her , and indignantly holding it up for reprobation . She heaves a heavy , furious sigh , and a sombre light comes into her great , gloomy eyes . From the garden is heard a peal of laughter . Sarah is always laughing . It is well to be merry sometimes , but Sarah is too much of a buffoon . "
104182	104236	104080	104085	A child of five years old	1631	" continues he , exasperated by a silence that is so plainly not repentance — a silence which she still observes . Another burst of laughter from the garden — not Sarah 's this time ; a man 's wholesome , unfeigned mirth . He , too , can laugh , can he ? "
104252	104285	104247	104250	the writing - master	1632	" says Mr. Forth , still ironically regarding the blurred page . For all answer , she rises to her feet , and throws her pen with violence down upon the floor . "
104296	104307	104286	104286	Your	0	" she says , with a pale , rebellious smile . "
104332	104670	104671	104671	You	1635	" It is Miss Churchill 's maxim always to make herself as comfortable , under any given circumstances , as those circumstances will permit ; nor has she failed on the present occasion to live up to her own precept . Beneath the garden wall , where the shade spreads coolest , a fur rug , filched from the drawing - room floor , is extended ; cushions , unlawfully thieved from the drawing - room sofa , mollify the hardness of back of the garden - chairs . Upon the unlikely hypothesis of her conversation running short , she has unearthed all the novels she can find . At her feet the dogs alternately sleep , and gnash their teeth — rarely successful — at the flies . In the sun , close by , stands the parrot 's gilded cage ; so that , if other resources fail her , she may fall back upon his loquacity . In addition to the dogs , at her feet also lies Rivers , unworthily occupied in tickling the inside of the dozing Slutty 's ear with a flower - stalk . This is the tranquil Arcadian picture that salutes Mrs. Forth 's eyes as she issues from the house . He has his back turned towards her ! He has not cared enough for her coming , even to place himself so as to watch for it ! How is she to know that it was only a moment ago , in obedience to Sarah 's orders , and in dread of the remembered penetration of her eyes , that he had adopted his present position ? How cool they look ! How much at ease ! What a pity to disturb them ! After all she might as well have finished the proofs . As she draws near them , walking so softly over the turf that they are not immediately aware of her , a new burst of laughter fills and grates upon her ears . "
104676	104766	104671	104671	You	1635	" she says drily . Sarah exhibits no surprise — as why indeed should she?—at her sister 's advent . With her head thrown back comfortably over her chair , she finishes her laugh luxuriously out , but of Rivers ' mirth Belinda need no longer complain . There is not much that could be called mirth in the face that — suddenly leaping to his feet — he turns towards her . What a death's - head she must be to work such an instantaneous transformation in him ! "
104774	104843	104767	104767	You	1635	" she repeats . She is conscious of the resentful dryness of her tone ; of the fagged flush upon her cheeks ; and the sullenness that she has not quite been able to banish from her eyes ; but she is as powerless to correct the one as the others . What has he done to deserve that tone ? Beneath it he stands tongue - tied . "
104853	104868	104767	104767	You	1635	" she says , struggling not very successfully for a greater amenity of manner ; "
104878	104879	104767	104767	You	1635	" "
104887	104892	104767	104767	You	1635	" he answers deprecatingly ; "
104903	104906	104898	104898	I	0	only"—looking unhappy and ashamed—"that
104937	104983	104929	104929	she	152	" There is such a contrast between the very mild waggery of this anecdote , and the deep humiliation of the tone in which he narrates it , that Sarah sets off laughing helplessly again ; but not a muscle of Belinda 's face moves . "
104989	104998	104929	104929	she	152	" she says , with a slight shrug ; "
105010	105011	105007	105008	Joe Miller	292	" "
105021	105040	105016	105017	Joe Miller	292	" replies Sarah , standing up in indistinct defence — indistinct through much laughing — of her pleasantry ; "
105056	105199	105053	105053	he	1635	" Belinda sits down ; but the cloud still lowers on her brow . To her own heart she says that she does well to be angry . That here , for the first time face to face with the tragedy of their two lives , he should be in a condition to be genuinely amused by so miserable a jest — by any jest ! Nor does the crushing of his merriment please her any better . She , then , is the wet blanket who stifles his jollity . Times are indeed changed ! If she were to leave them , no doubt the peals of laughter would at once break out afresh . But for the present they are effectually stilled . Painfully and sorely conscious of this , she makes another difficult effort to recover her good temper . "
105210	105215	105200	105200	I	0	" she says awkwardly ; "
105238	105261	105225	105225	Punch	186	" She has lifted the lively little dog up on her knees , and is half hiding her hot face against his . "
105272	105344	105225	105225	Punch	186	" says Rivers , made bold by her gentler tone diffidently to draw a little nigher to her , and to raise his eyes in painful questioning to hers . As he speaks , he lifts his hand and touches the locket habitually worn round the neck , and as habitually tried to be scratched off by Punch ; and from which a lock of hair is at present obviously escaping . "
105356	105365	105347	105347	Punch	186	" asks the young man , laughing nervously . "
105377	105378	105347	105347	Punch	186	" "
105385	105393	105347	105347	Punch	186	" interposes Sarah in a disgusted voice ; "
105398	105413	105415	105415	people	523	" lazily drawing herself up into a sitting posture , and looking round explanatorily , "
105476	105498	105472	105472	you	186	" As she speaks , she calls the dog to her ; and becomes absorbed in the contemplation of his jewellery . "
105510	105602	105472	105472	you	186	" asks Rivers , almost under his breath . There is a smile on his face as he puts this question ; but a smile with whose mirth she need not quarrel . In a moment how the Hussars and Uhlans are clanking round her again ! How the soft wind is pelting her with cherry flowers ! How the old Schloss is towering up against the German sky ! She can not answer him ; but those few words seem to have given them back something of their former intimacy . "
105608	105633	105472	105472	you	186	" says Sarah reflectively , having taken out the little lock , and being now contemplatively eyeing it with her head on one side ; "
105673	105693	105695	105695	you	134	" ( turning to Rivers , and coolly setting the little tendril against his hair to compare them ) . "
105705	105753	105695	105695	you	134	" He turns with a start . He has been unwisely allowing himself to drift into one of his old speculations , as to whether any woman 's ear had ever sat so daintily close to her head as does that of the wife of Professor Forth . "
105760	105782	105695	105695	you	134	" he cries , jumping up , and falling on his knees before Sarah , with an air of exaggerated playfulness ; "
105804	105814	105799	105799	you	134	" passing his hand over his own crisp curls . "
105824	105884	105821	105822	Mrs. Forth	271	" It is the first time that he has so addressed her . It is with untold difficulty that the name crosses his lips , and consequently he enunciates it with unusual distinctness . It is in reality a cudgelling that he is administering to himself for his late lapse , but to her it seems a wanton cruelty . "
105894	106086	105891	105892	Mrs. Forth	271	" Mrs. Forth 's head is , however , bent so low over her work - basket , that apparently she does not hear . Behind the shelter of that convenient receptacle for tapes and needles , her hands are trembling and writhing . At Dresden would he have talked even in joke of giving Sarah a lock of his hair ? Why , he never even heard her when she spoke to him ! Happily for Belinda , at this point , she is summoned to the house on some trifling errand , which detains her for ten minutes — ten minutes in which she is able to resume some hold upon herself ; and it is well that it is so , for the sight which greets her is one not calculated to promote her equanimity . Sarah has abandoned her lazy reclining , and is sitting up , and holding Rivers ' hand ; not indeed , when one comes to observe closely , in any very lover - like manner , but as one who is examining it with an air of the liveliest interest and curiosity . "
106097	106107	106087	106087	I	0	" she is saying , with her accustomed candour ; "
106116	106117	106111	106112	a workman	1638	" "
106124	106145	106121	106122	a workman	1638	" he answers bluntly . And then he is suddenly aware of Belinda 's presence , and snatches it away . "
106156	106164	106121	106122	a workman	1638	" says Sarah in a pleased voice ; "
106184	106207	106182	106182	Belinda	134	" He looks towards her , hesitating and uncertain . She has resumed her former seat , and her work - basket . "
106210	106315	106316	106316	You	1641	" she says , trying to speak with her newly summoned tranquillity ; and he holds it out to her , palm upwards . It is a beautiful hand still , shapely and vigorous , but on it are disfiguring evidences of hard , coarse toil . There is nothing particularly affecting in a work - roughened palm : it is a condition to which are subjected the hands of ninety - nine out of every hundred of the human race ; and yet , as she looks at it , she has much ado to prevent the tears from springing to her eyes . "
106319	106323	106316	106316	You	1641	" he says , "
106339	106340	106341	106341	We	1642	" "
106344	106353	106354	106354	You	0	" cries Sarah , pricking up her ears . "
106374	106401	106402	106402	I	0	" He stops — staggered and white . He had forgotten the presence of an auditor . Nor is Belinda in a plight to help him . "
106405	106410	106402	106402	I	0	" he says floundering , "
106423	106429	106430	106430	I	0	" hurriedly resuming his narrative , "
106455	106456	106521	106521	they	1646	" "
106462	106471	106521	106521	they	1646	" cries Sarah , delighted with the sound ; "
106482	106490	106521	106521	they	1646	" repeating the phrase with emphatic relish . "
106533	106539	106521	106521	they	1646	" with a shy laugh , "
106553	106568	106521	106521	they	1646	" Belinda 's pretence of work has dropped unheeded on the grass beside her . "
106573	106581	106521	106521	they	1646	" says Sarah , still agreeably interested ; "
106603	106604	106609	106609	child	732	" "
106613	106618	106609	106609	child	732	" he answers drily ; "
106648	106649	106640	106640	We	1649	" "
106659	106660	106652	106652	you	0	" "
106688	106716	106652	106652	you	0	" He pauses a moment , passing his disfigured hand , half in absence , half in kindness , along Slutty 's roomy back ; then adds : "
106743	106856	106891	106891	Belinda	134	" He says it with complete simplicity , neither expecting nor wishing for compassion ; as if to spend eight hours a day in a puddling - furnace were the natural and ordinary sequel of an education at Eton and Oxbridge . So this is how he has spent the twenty months , passed by her in listening for the postman 's knock — in this life - shortening , mind - deadening brute toil ! Well , even so , he has had the best of it ! There is a silence of some moments ' duration , broken by Sarah , whose sharp ear has caught a sound of footsteps . "
106859	106865	106891	106891	Belinda	134	" she cries with animation , "
106903	106996	106997	106997	They	1653	" Belinda lifts her downcast eyes : lifts them to see three young gentlemen , whom apparently the parlour - maid , with that contempt for undergraduates inherent in the native Oxbridge mind , has left to announce themselves , timorously advancing . They are evidently not very easy in their minds , and are somewhat obviously each pushing the other to the front . Clearly , Professor Forth 's house is no habitual lounge for undergraduates . A movement of irrational relief thrills through Rivers ' heart as he realizes this . "
107012	107022	106997	106997	They	1653	" says Mrs. Forth , with a dry smile . "
107031	107039	107041	107041	you	0	" with one quick glance at Rivers , "
107046	107074	107075	107075	I	0	" She does not pause to see the effect of her words ; but , rising , walks with her long slow step to meet her guests . "
107084	107096	107075	107075	I	0	" says Sarah in a stage aside to the young man . "
107137	107212	107215	107215	she	0	" But Sarah for once is mistaken . They have no desire to turn tail and run . It is doubtful , indeed , whether , on their home - ward way , and over their evening cigars , their limited and artless vocabulary of encomium is more strained to find epithets of approval for Miss Churchill than for her austerer sister . But indeed , to - day , Belinda is not austere . "
107219	107225	107228	107228	she	0	" she asks herself sadly ; "
107239	107470	107215	107215	she	0	" And so she is kind to them — too kind , Rivers begins presently to think with a jealous pang , as he sees her pouring out tea for them with her all - lovely hands ; endowing them with her heavenly smile ; lightening their darkness with her starry eyes . Nor is he , even yet , wise enough in love 's lore , or coxcomb enough , to suspect that it is he himself — he sitting by , apparently neglected and overlooked — who has lit the eyes and carved the smile . Sarah is very kind , too ; but they are rather hurt at the hopeless muddle into which she has got their names . By - and - by , when well be - tea'd and becaked , they are embarked upon a game of tennis , and the sound of callings and laughings , of balls struck and racquets striking , breaks the Arcadian silence of that hitherto virgin enclosure — Professor Forth 's tennis - ground . It is too small to admit of more than one set at a time ; and Belinda , as a good hostess , despite the warm urgencies of the now tamed and happy strangers , retires in favour of her visitors . It boots little to inquire whether the sacrifice cost her much . "
107475	107488	107472	107472	you	1655	" cries Sarah nonchalantly , flourishing her racquet under Rivers ' nose . "
107493	107499	107500	107500	you	1655	" with an impudent smile , "
107509	107577	107579	107579	she	1658	" Though it is morally impossible that they could have understood it , both Bellairs and Stanley are contemptible enough to laugh at this sally ; a fact which would no doubt have made Rivers disposed to punch their heads , had he heard them ; but the jest and its prosperity both fall upon deaf ears . Sight and hearing are stopped by the anxious fear : "
107614	107749	107606	107606	she	1658	" A lump rises in his throat . Not presuming again to take up his place on the grass at her feet — though , after all , it is a privilege that no one grudges even to the dogs — he stands , uncertain and unhappy , before her . If she so wills it , this must be the end . Nor does she seem in any hurry to put him out of his incertitude . Upon her the day 's earlier mood is returning . In what life - giving whiffs comes the kindly wind ! Did ever homely coated bird say such sweet things as does the blackbird from among the cherry - boughs ? and the little vulgar villa - garden has grown like that of which Keats spake : "
107771	107823	107761	107761	herself	1658	" He is here before her , waiting one lightest sign from her to lie down at her feet and be trampled on . Is it any wonder that , being a woman , she lets three minutes elapse before she gives that sign ? At the end of that time , "
107830	107871	107825	107825	you	1660	" she asks abruptly . It is half an hour since the subject was dropped , and a dozen others have intervened between ; yet he seems to have no difficulty in understanding at once to what her speech alludes . "
107874	107925	107825	107825	you	1660	" he answers , with a sigh of relief ( for it is evident that had she wished to be rid of him , she would not have introduced a new , or resumed an old , topic ) , taking possession as he speaks of Sarah 's forsaken chair ; "
107933	107954	107931	107931	foreman	1661	" He pauses for her to comment or congratulate ; but she does neither . She only stitches feverishly on . "
107976	107997	107931	107931	foreman	1661	" he continues , with the hurry of one who has no assurance that he is not wearying his listener ; "
108026	108043	108024	108024	foreman	1661	" He stops so decidedly that she is compelled to make an observation of some kind . "
108066	108155	108061	108064	your master 's daughter	1666	" she says with a difficult flippancy . The blood rushes to his face . He had expected a kinder commentary . Surely no jest ever so ill became her whom , in his eyes , all becomes . There is a silence . The sun 's rays are less vertical , and the dogs have awoke . Punch indeed , under the mistaken idea of being obliging , is officiously retrieving the tennis balls , and being warmly slapped by the heated players for his good nature . "
108158	108169	108061	108064	your master 's daughter	1666	" says Belinda , with nervous asperity in her tone , "
108178	108179	108180	108180	Others	1101	" "
108189	108206	108180	108180	Others	1101	" he continues spiritlessly , for her jest has taken the heart out of his narration , "
108249	108250	108253	108253	I	0	" "
108258	108266	108253	108253	I	0	" cries she , laughing rather stridently ; "
108279	108310	108253	108253	I	0	" Again his face burns , but he deigns her no answer . If she can stoop to so unworthy a merriment , she shall at least enjoy it alone . "
108319	108330	108253	108253	I	0	" he says , trying to catch her callous tone ; "
108399	108652	108657	108657	you	1673	" He ends with a laugh . Her mirth , which had offended him , has long died ; nor has she any answer ready to his question . Her long arms ( even arms can look sad ) lie listless on her lap , and her great veiled eyes see visions . Vanished from before them are the little square garden and the tennis - players . They see only his future life - path stretching before her ; his life growing ever fuller , fuller , fuller of busy , prospering , eager work , with ever less and less room in it for the gap left by her . By - and - by that gap will close altogether . The sooner the better for him ! But for her ? Over her there pours a rush of frantic longing to tear it wide ; to keep it ever , ever yawning . But it will not so yawn always . It will close so that scarce a scar will be left to show where it once was . He is fond of his work already . In how different a spirit he addresses himself to it from that in which , sulky and half - hearted , she turns to her hated toils . A sense of injury and offence against him rises in her heart . He can never have suffered as she has suffered ; his meat has never been ashes , nor his drink tears ! "
108663	108671	108672	108672	I	0	" she says in a hard voice ; "
108676	108677	108672	108672	I	0	" "
108681	108688	108689	108689	you	1673	" he answers , deeply wounded ; "
108700	108732	108689	108689	you	1673	" There is such a sharp pain in his tone , that , though she has been anxiously averting her eyes from him , they must needs seek his in apology . "
108736	108745	108746	108746	you	1673	" she says with a remorseful watery smile ; "
108757	108762	108746	108746	you	1673	" her lip trembling , "
108769	108789	108746	108746	you	1673	" Seeing the sorrowful twitching of that lovely and beloved mouth , he loses his head for a moment . "
108799	108808	108746	108746	you	1673	" he says , murmuring under his breath ; "
108816	108847	108848	108848	Belinda	134	" She offers no denial . Only she drops her eyes ; and a stealing selfish sweetness laps her senses . Not yet , then , is the gap filled . "
108850	108879	108848	108848	Belinda	134	" cries the voice of Sarah , suddenly striking in , high and mirthful ; of Sarah , returned , hot and boastful , from her finished game . "
108891	108898	108900	108900	you	134	" Belinda gives a great start . "
108903	108908	108900	108900	you	134	" she says hurriedly ; "
108916	108917	108900	108900	you	134	" "
108926	108953	108900	108900	you	134	" ( she has not yet mastered the name of her third young friend , but audaciously mumbles something that is to stand for it ) , "
109018	109023	109010	109010	you	134	" Belinda laughs nervously . "
109031	109087	109028	109028	I	0	" She has risen from her chair and begun to walk about upon the sward . Perhaps by changing her position she may the sooner be free of the heady fumes of this mandragora that she has been drinking ; may the more easily shake off this divine drowsiness , that yet leads to death . "
109102	109119	109099	109099	I	0	" says Sarah , darting a dry look from one to the other of the culprits . "
109123	109132	109134	109134	I	0	" repeats Belinda , with a feverish gaiety ; "
109171	109172	109099	109099	I	0	" "
109189	109198	109184	109184	you	134	" cries Sarah , again appeased and jubilant . "
109204	109216	109184	109184	you	134	" replies Mrs. Forth , still with that same factitious liveliness . "
109235	109272	109225	109225	I	0	" She stops abruptly ; her rebellious eye wandering to where Rivers — he , too , has risen — stands aloof , out in the cold ; obviously uninvited , unincluded in the joyous programme . "
109279	109287	109274	109274	Menander	287	" says Sarah , making a face ; "
109307	109308	109294	109294	he	287	" "
109314	109320	109312	109312	Menander	287	" replies Belinda with embarrassment ; "
109353	109354	109334	109335	Mr. Forth	209	" "
109360	109377	109334	109335	Mr. Forth	209	" looking at her with a point - blank directness that puts her out of countenance . "
109380	109402	109334	109335	Mr. Forth	209	" she says , and stops again , irresolute . Reason is pouring her cold douche over her , and asking : "
109470	109471	109531	109531	you	209	" "
109475	109483	109531	109531	you	209	" she says , with awkward gaiety . "
109490	109495	109487	109487	you	209	" asks Sarah inquisitively . "
109522	109523	109515	109515	you	209	" "
109536	109550	109531	109531	you	209	" turning with a sort of spurious coquetry to the enraptured young men . "
109558	109583	109531	109531	you	209	" cries Bellairs ; he , by right of his one minute 's priority of introduction , having constituted himself spokesman and old acquaintance ; "
109600	109601	109602	109602	You	209	" "
109611	109619	109602	109602	You	209	" replies she with a flighty laugh . "
109637	109710	109712	109712	you	209	" Her eye sparkles , and her cheek flames , as she speaks . Is it indeed the expectation of pleasure that has set them both so bravely alight ? She throws herself with such a fury of interest into all the details of the excursion , that she has hardly time or attention to spare for bidding good - bye to Rivers , who presently comes up to make his adieux . "
109715	109720	109712	109712	you	209	" she asks indifferently . "
109725	110016	109712	109712	you	209	" As she speaks , she lays for one instant her hot dry hand in his cold one . She would have bidden even Bellairs good - bye more warmly . None but herself knows the strength of the temptation that assails her to clutch that poor slighted hand before them all ; to lay it on her miserable heart ; to drown it in her tears , smother it with her kisses , and pay it any other tribute of extravagant passionate homage . Least of all does he suspect it , as he walks away , decently strangling his sick despair till he is out of sight . No sooner is he gone , and the need for defence ended , than she throws away her weapons . Her attention flags so obviously ; her manner relapses so patently from its short summer of animation into its normal frost , that it dawns at length upon the three boys ' intelligence that they are running a good chance of outstaying their welcome , and forfeiting the place that they flatter themselves they have won in Mrs. Forth 's esteem . They take leave as precipitately as Sarah 's many last words , commands , espiègleries , jokes , will let them . She accompanies them to the door ; and Belinda , since it is more tolerable to move about than to sit still , accompanies her . The sisters lean on the low iron gate , and the bland spring evening wraps her arms around them . Belinda has lifted her gloomy eyes to the laburnum gloriously pendent above her head . Which happy cluster was it that brushed against his hair last night in the starlight ? "
110023	110050	110053	110053	he	1685	" says Sarah , in that voice of shrewd , dry sense which would surprise the admirers of her butterfly phase , could they hear it . "
110058	110143	110053	110053	he	1685	" She has desisted rather suddenly from her occupation of kissing her fingers to her three adorers , who , reluctant to lose one of her last glances , are backing down the road away from her . Belinda 's heart gives a bound . Not quite the end yet , then ! She has done her best ! Her conscience is clear ! but it is not quite the end yet , then ! Can she be blamed because he still loiters near ? "
110152	110162	110163	110163	You	0	" she says doggedly ; but her voice shakes . "
110176	110184	110174	110174	you	0	" asks Sarah , with dry rapidity . "
110187	110188	110174	110174	you	0	" "
110191	110199	110163	110163	You	0	" ( drawing a long breath ) , "
110204	110205	110163	110163	You	0	" "
110218	110244	110163	110163	You	0	" says Mrs. Forth sullenly . A frown less of ill - humour than of perplexed uneasiness has gathered on Miss Churchill 's satin brow . "
110256	110271	110252	110252	you	0	" she says curtly . The flush on Belinda 's fagged face grows hotter . "
110283	110288	110280	110280	you	0	" she says angrily . "
110292	110304	110289	110289	I	0	" replies Sarah shrewdly , and enunciating with the greatest clearness , "
110320	110321	110317	110317	I	0	" "
110325	110341	110323	110323	you	0	" cries the other fiercely , and trembling like a leaf from head to foot . "
110358	110448	110449	110450	Mr. Rivers	162	" At the last two words she raises her voice into a call ; but it is so unsteady and ill - modulated , and he is so comparatively distant , that one would hardly expect the sound to carry so far ; but apparently it does , for he starts and looks uncertainly towards her , distrusting his own ears . Is it likely that she should have called him ? she — his high proud lady — after such a careless cruelty of good - bye too ! "
110452	110533	110449	110450	Mr. Rivers	162	" she repeats , in a voice that is as unsteady as before , but louder . There can be no mistake this time . He can no longer distrust his good - luck ; and in one second , as if he could not obey her quickly enough , he is hurrying back . Sarah lifts her arms deliberately from the gate , and rubs them gently to remove the slight numbness produced by contact with the cold iron . "
110542	110557	110536	110536	they	1689	" she says , gently raising her shoulders , and turning towards the house . "
110572	110639	110640	110640	You	0	" So saying , she disappears . Belinda would have liked to ask her to stay , but her pride forbids it . Long before Rivers has reached her , she has repented of her perverse and devil - born impulse . Why has she called him ? What has she to say to him when he comes ? For the first moment she says nothing . "
110646	110661	110642	110642	you	0	" he asks , faltering , surprised at her silence and her strange look . "
110665	110671	110663	110663	I	0	" she says , stammering . "
110690	110691	110693	110693	I	0	" "
110695	110726	110693	110693	I	0	" he answers blankly . Is this , then , what she has called him back for ? To tell him that he must not venture into her presence again ? "
110735	110744	110747	110747	you	0	" she says , with a forced laugh ; "
110754	110755	110747	110747	you	0	" "
110764	110769	110770	110770	I	0	" he answers diffidently ; "
110777	110847	110747	110747	you	0	" Her rebel pulses leap . A week ! A whole week ! She lifts her face , on which the sunset is mirrored , and looks towards the west . On what a couch of fiery damask roses , dying into daffodil , the sun is laying himself down ! What a treble sweetness the throstle is putting into his song as he addresses himself to his rest ! "
110851	110856	110747	110747	you	0	" she says aloud . "
110871	110889	110747	110747	you	0	" he asks , rather wounded by what sounds to him the cold wonder of her tone ; "
110899	110904	110906	110906	you	1691	" He stops abruptly . "
110912	111020	110906	110906	you	1691	" would be the sentence 's natural ending ; but so to conclude it would be to suppose an interest , with which he has no right nor any reason to credit the wife of Professor Forth , in him and his affairs . She does not ask him how he had meant to finish his phrase . She does not finish it for him . She only stands staring , beneath the level penthouse of her milky hands , at the blinding sunset . What a curve her lifted elbow makes ! From what a marvel of wrist and forearm does the lawny sleeve fall back ! "
111029	111034	111024	111024	you	1691	" he asks abruptly ; "
111047	111086	111024	111024	you	1691	" For a minute she stands irresolute , still looking sunwards ; her outward woman a lovely pattern of harmony , grace , and quiet ; her inward woman , ugly chaos and dark fight . Shall she say "
111088	111121	111024	111024	you	1691	" ? To say so would be to more than retrieve her late error . Dimly she feels that if she has one ray of sober reason left her , she will say "
111124	111148	111149	111149	Belinda	134	" She heaves a sigh , and lets fall her hands . Her lips have all but framed the fateful word , when : "
111153	111189	111151	111151	Belinda	134	" comes an old voice , calling imperatively peevish from the house . A week ! One poor week ! Only a week ! What can one week matter ? Her manner has suddenly changed . "
111195	111200	111192	111193	Mr. Forth	209	" she says hurriedly . "
111206	111224	111201	111201	I	0	" reddening like the western cloud - fleeces , and throwing a guilty look over her shoulder , "
111253	111572	111201	111201	I	0	" In other climes , a sunset of suave sublimity usually means that it will be followed by a sunrise as nobly fair . But in our free isle this is not the case . Even the weather will submit to no tyranny , but follows its own wild and freakish will . You may close your eyes upon a distant steady heaven of molten copper and speckless blue ; and open them upon a soaked - blanket sky , half an inch above your head . During the many wakeful patches that vary the sameness of her night , Belinda has full time to repent of her evening 's doings ; but not once does it occur to her that the weather may possibly intervene to prohibit the excursion . Among all her half - sincere plans for evading the expedition , the alternative of a wet day has not once suggested itself ; and when the morn comes , dim and sad , the poignancy of her disappointment at sight of the dripping bushes and filled flower - cups shows her how much of veracity there was in her projects of abstinence . Now she will have to endure the pang of renunciation , without having enjoyed the merit of self - conquest . And yet it is a lovely rain , not harshly driving , nor rudely strewing the earth with a ravin of torn - off petals ; but gently stealing down from the cloud - roof overhead , softly thrusting itself between the blossom - lips , feeding the juicy leaves , healthful , wealthful , beneficent , yet execrated by two young eyes that are morosely watching it . It is execrated by two old ones also . The Professor tentatively throws out an idea as to the advisability of telegraphing to the Archæological Society his inability to preside over its deliberations . "
111581	111609	111201	111201	I	0	" cries Belinda impatiently , as she stands , a comforter thrown over her arm , and a mackintosh extended to receive her husband 's meagre person ; "
111620	111621	111201	111201	I	0	" "
111641	111647	111201	111201	I	0	" replies he , demurring . "
111696	111697	111701	111701	you	1694	" "
111719	111776	111777	111777	I	0	" asks she , reddening consciously as she speaks . What is she saying ? What does she care whether they are disappointed or not ? To what depths of disingenuousness has she — truthful as she has been hitherto counted her life long — already descended ? But it may clear — it may clear ! "
111798	111951	111777	111777	I	0	" he says thoughtfully ; and then her spirits rise , for he extends his arms , not to take a parting embrace , but to insert them in the waterproof - sleeves which she , with wifely alacrity , holds ready to receive them . He is gone . That one main obstacle to her pleasure is at all events removed . If only it would clear ! She is no longer half - sincere with herself . No longer does she feign a desire to extricate herself from the entanglement into which she has plunged , nor a gratitude to Mother Nature for having come to her aid . Without asking why she wishes it , she has concentrated all her being upon the one mastering desire to see that cloud - curtain raise its trailing corners , transpierced and put to flight by such a sun as yesterday 's . "
111962	111992	111994	111994	you	1701	" she says , in a tone which she in vain tries to make sound careless , to Sarah , as they enter the drawing - room after breakfast . "
112005	112006	111994	111994	you	1701	" "
112011	112113	111994	111994	you	1701	" replies Sarah placidly . With that adaptability to circumstances which makes life to her one long feast , Miss Churchill has arranged herself for a wet day . A small fire — not unwelcome in the rain - chilled atmosphere — brightens the hearth ; and to it she has — for to her nothing is sacred — pulled up the Professor 's chair : that one of Mudie 's novels which , by its large type , wide margins , and plenitude of titled names , seems to promise the least strain upon the intellect , in her hand . "
112121	112150	111994	111994	you	1701	" says Mrs. Forth , in a tone of mournful irritation , totally unable to follow her philosophic sister 's example , and fidgeting uneasily about the room . "
112154	112278	111994	111994	you	1701	" rejoins Sarah equably . There is something in the indifferent content of her voice that jars upon Belinda 's mood . The dogs have taken their cue from Miss Churchill — Punch has got inside the fender as if it were winter ; the cat lies lazily stretched just outside the parrot 's cage ; and Polly , exasperated by her air of calm security , is walking stealthily , head downwards , along the side of his cage , and when he has got , as he thinks , within reach of her , is stretching out first a vicious hooked nose , and then a long crooked grey hand , to make a grab at her whiskers . Sarah laughs . "
112287	112297	112279	112279	You	1702	" says Belinda , with an irrationally aggrieved accent . "
112301	112307	112299	112299	I	0	" answers Sarah , yawning . "
112353	112357	112358	112358	my	0	" ( parenthetically ) "
112388	112389	112380	112380	you	1702	" "
112395	112420	112422	112422	them	1705	" replies Belinda , avoiding compliance by seating herself where she can at once command the window , and evade her sister 's eyes . "
112426	112427	112422	112422	them	1705	" "
112434	112449	112430	112430	you	1702	" begins Sarah , prudently ignoring this ruse , and launching into her narrative , "
112521	112566	112514	112514	she	156	" She pauses to see whether her hearer is listening ; it is obvious that she is not , as for a moment or two she makes no comment , and then , becoming aware of the silence , breaks into a factitious laugh . "
112571	112572	112514	112514	she	156	" "
112579	112584	112575	112575	you	1712	" asks Sarah sharply . "
112594	112601	112575	112575	you	1712	" The other stops , embarrassed . "
112616	112622	112575	112575	you	1712	" she answers in confusion . "
112629	112641	112575	112575	you	1712	" replies Miss Churchill shortly , taking up her book again ; "
112649	112650	112575	112575	you	1712	" "
112656	112677	112679	112679	I	0	" cries Mrs. Forth , advancing eagerly towards the hearth , roused into alarm at her own self - betrayal ; "
112700	112905	112692	112692	you	1712	" But Sarah is inexorable . Presently Belinda desists from her importunities , and not daring to return to the window , also takes up a book , occasionally from behind its shelter throwing a desperate eye on the weather . It is a hopeless wet day . Once or twice , indeed , there has been a tantalizing thinning of , and movement among , the vapours ; but it has ended only in a more resolute , inflexible fastening upon the earth . Eleven — that hour of clearing — has come and gone , and brought no clearing with it . After all , she might as well have done her plain duty , and sent him away . In that case she would at least have had the throbs of an approving conscience to keep her up . And what , pray , has she now ? The forenoon is gone ; luncheon is over ; they are again in the drawing - room . The novel has long ago dropped from Sarah 's fingers , and she has slidden into a warm , infantile slumber . The door - bell , loudly jangling , wakes her with a jump . "
112912	112920	112908	112910	those hateful boys	1713	" she cries petulantly , starting up . "
112940	112981	112982	112984	those hateful boys	1713	" One glance at her sister 's face — that sister who has obviously not shared her slumbers ; whose watch has been at length rewarded , though by no brightening of the material sky — tells her who is among "
112986	113020	112982	112984	those hateful boys	1713	" Perhaps this fact adds a new tinge of ill - humour to her tone , as she advances , childishly rubbing her drowsy eyes with her knuckles , to meet her admirers . "
113025	113031	113021	113021	You	1715	" she says , pouting . "
113040	113117	113120	113120	her	1716	" This speech is not calculated to reassure three timid young gentlemen , who have already been questioning the wisdom of their own procedure , and doubtfully discussing among themselves the probabilities as to the mood , whether of summer warmth or December ice , that they will find their hostess in . Upon Sarah , at least , they had counted to stand by them . But aid from an unexpected quarter comes to them . "
113122	113139	113120	113120	her	1716	" says Belinda , with a young and radiant smile of welcome and re - assurance . "
113184	113244	113245	113245	I	0	" This is the way in which she now regards the lately - execrated downpour . Is he not here ? and whether in sunny boat on flashing river , gathering fritillaries in the water - meadows , or in little rain - darkened early - English drawing - room , is not it now all one to her ? "
113255	113272	113273	113273	we	1720	" says Bellairs , a little relieved , but still not very comfortable in his spirits ; "
113286	113287	113280	113280	you	1719	" "
113292	113318	113280	113280	you	1719	" cries Sarah , still cross and sleepy , casting a sarcastic glance , first at the weather , and then at the young man ; "
113327	113346	113280	113280	you	1719	" He looks so silly , that Miss Churchill laughs , her good - humour at once restored . "
113359	113371	113374	113374	they	1724	" she says , in a thoroughly wide - awake voice ; "
113403	113404	113399	113399	we	1720	" "
113408	113442	113399	113399	we	1720	" responds Belinda readily . Her cheeks are pink , and her eyes dancing . There is no pastime , however wildly , childishly hilarious , for which she is not in tune . "
113446	113451	113399	113399	we	1720	" suggests Sarah joyously . "
113457	113473	113476	113476	everybody	354	" ( with a reproving look at Staveley , who has murmured this objection ) . "
113483	113490	113476	113476	everybody	354	" ( in lucid explanation ) . "
113508	113509	113510	113511	The neighbours	1726	" "
113519	113528	113510	113511	The neighbours	1726	" says Belinda gaily , shaking her head . "
113532	113533	113510	113511	The neighbours	1726	" "
113541	113545	113510	113511	The neighbours	1726	" says Sarah ; "
113557	113578	113579	113581	Hare and Hounds	300	" ( rather curtly , and with an almost imperceptible glance towards Rivers , in application of the warning ) . "
113591	113604	113605	113605	We	1720	" says Mr. De Lisle , in a small , shy voice . "
113638	113639	113640	113640	Your	0	" "
113657	113675	113640	113640	Your	0	" replies Sarah , dismissing at once , though with leniency , this not very bright suggestion ; "
113689	113738	113681	113682	the company	1194	" The company , who are one and all in the mood for riotous jollity in any form , hail the proposal with one - voiced effusion ; and it is on the point of being carried into execution , when Miss Churchill suggests an improvement upon it . "
113793	114024	114100	114100	your	1741	" No sooner said than done . Away trundles the early English suite of rush - bottomed chairs ; away the Professor 's sacred fauteuil ! away Belinda 's work - table ! everything but the piano and the music - stool , to which little De Lisle , having weakly admitted that he can play a little dance music , is at once ruthlessly nailed . The rain patters , snow - soft outside . The valse strikes up . There is a moment 's hesitation . Bellairs and Staveley , generously unwilling to steal a march upon each other , hang back ; but Sarah settles the point by frisking up to the one nearest to her — it is all one to her with which she dances ; it happens to be Bellairs — and swoops away with him smooth and sure as a swallow darting down upon a moth . Without a word exchanged between them , Belinda finds herself in Rivers ' arms . The rain plash - plashes upon the open window 's sill . How long it is since she has danced ! How madly exhilarating are motion and measure ! Is it in heaven or upon earth that that lame waltz is being strummed ? After a turn or two he feels her light and buoyant body grow heavy in his embrace . "
114027	114032	114100	114100	your	1741	" she says dizzily ; "
114038	114060	114100	114100	your	1741	" He obeys at once ; and fearing lest she may fall , keeps for one moment his arm around her . "
114069	114082	114100	114100	your	1741	" she says , lifting one white hand to her giddy eyes ; "
114092	114097	114100	114100	your	1741	" She breaks off . "
114102	114126	114127	114127	your	1741	" He also breaks off . But she is none the less firmly and irrevocably we d , because of his inability to say "
114130	114131	114127	114127	your	1741	" "
114138	114156	114127	114127	your	1741	" rejoins she , hurriedly interrupting , with a nervous dread lest he may complete the phrase ; "
114162	114163	114100	114100	your	1741	" "
114172	114197	114198	114198	You	1741	" he says , making the same slight pause as she had done before the name of the , to them , sacred city . "
114204	114224	114225	114225	I	0	" she answers with a charming saucy smile — for under the unwonted joyous excitement her spirits are towering perilously high—"but
114251	114309	114236	114236	I	0	" Distant as is the epoch alluded to , and satisfactorily as he had been persuaded at the time by ocular evidence of the reciprocal indifference of Belinda and the Saxon officers , he can not avoid a feeling of biting jealousy and offence against those innocent and both in time and space far off German valseurs . "
114318	114630	114314	114314	my	0	" he says with emphasis ; and she offering no contradiction , away they float into their trance again . The valse ends ; the patient De Lisle begins to hammer out a galop . They must part ; for Bellairs , emboldened thereto by Sarah 's warm approbation , is inviting Belinda , and she dare not refuse . Rivers dances with Miss Churchill . Why need he ? Why need he dance at all ? Why , above all , need he throw such spirit and animation into his dancing ? He looks as if he were enjoying himself as much as Sarah . Staveley , after having vainly endeavoured to educate Slutty into a partner ( Slutty , on unwilling hind - legs , and with tail abjectly tucked in , perhaps in the laudable intention of giving herself a more human air ) , galops bravely by himself . The galop ends . The musician , bringing out of his treasures things new and old , treats them to a venerable polka . Once more he and she are together ; and in what a different spirit her light feet now move ! Bellairs had found her but a disappointing partner ; inert , and often begging to be allowed to stop and take breath . In Rivers ' arms , her life 's tides are running at their highest . It is Staveley 's turn to be Sarah 's danseur , and Bellairs , emulating his friend 's former example , polks alone . But not altogether with his friend 's success . For Punch , inspired by a scientific curiosity to investigate the strange phenomena that have appeared on his horizon , unhappily runs between his legs , and brings him to the earth with some clamour . The player stops : the dancers pause . "
114638	114658	114631	114631	We	1744	" says Sarah , drawing her sister into the window for an aside , and speaking with some brusqueness ; "
114667	114674	114675	114675	he	1745	" ( indicating De Lisle ) ; "
114725	114726	114720	114720	us	1744	" "
114731	114751	114720	114720	us	1744	" answers Belinda hurriedly , shrinking away from the reproach that her conscience tells her she so richly deserves ; "
114758	114759	114755	114755	you	1747	" "
114765	114784	114755	114755	you	1747	" says Sarah authoritatively , returning to the young men , and clapping her hands to enforce silence ; "
114813	115223	114808	114809	Blind Man	1749	" This second proposal is received with an enthusiasm as much hotter than the former as may be expected from the universal loosening of the bonds of shyness and conventionality which has taken place since that former one was first made . Sarah at once volunteers to be blind - folded ; and in two minutes she is established in the middle of the little room , a Liberty silk handkerchief tied over her jovial eyes , and her hands outstretched in futile blind groping and grabbing . The rest of the party , in the most approved fashion , pull her gown , tweak her hair , nip her sleeve ; but not for long . With one well - directed lunge — so well directed as to rouse an instant loud cry of dishonesty — she has pounced upon Bellairs , who in his turn is blind - folded — is in his turn tweaked and nipped — and in his turn catches Rivers ; Rivers catches Belinda . The fun waxes fast and furious . They have raised every grain of dust latent in the carpet ; Punch is cheering them on by volleys of delighted short barks , while Slutty sits wretchedly in a corner with her face to the wall . Most madly mirthful of all — most intemperately gay , out - Heroding Herod , out - doing Sarah in her wildest mood , with splendid poppy - cheeks and lightening eyes — is Mrs. Forth . She has been old so long — so long ! She is making up the arrears of her lost youth . The clamour is at its loudest . Scarcely less blowzed — bawling scarcely less noisily than were the Primrose family in neighbour Flamborough 's kitchen , when annihilated by the entrance of Lady Blarney and Miss Caroline Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs — is the society gathered on that wet May afternoon in Professor Forth 's decent drawing - room . Belinda , caught for the second time , stands blind - folded in the middle of the room , while shouts of uproarious laughter greet her vain efforts to gain hold of any of the assailants who lustily beset her . All of a sudden , in one instant there is silence . The pushing , and jostling , and nipping have altogether ceased . Without any attempt at resistance some one is in her clasp . "
115229	115240	114808	114809	Blind Man	1749	" cries she , in a voice of jubilant triumph ; "
115245	115515	115243	115243	you	1750	" and so tears the bandage from her eyes . It is indeed true that she is grasping Rivers ' coat - sleeve in indisputable conquest : but , at the moment that she verifies this fact , the cause of his having fallen so easy a prey , the cause of the instantaneous and entire muteness that has fallen upon the so boisterous little assemblage , breaks in horror upon her stunned eyes . The door is half open , and through it Professor Forth is looking , with an expression hard to qualify upon his face , at the entertainment got up with such spirit and success in his absence . Not for long , however . In a moment he has softly closed the door again and withdrawn . For several moments they stand staring at each other speechless and aghast . Belinda 's look wanders in consternation from one to other of the faces round her . Disordered hair , red - hot cheeks , panting breath , rampagious eyes ! Bedlam might easily turn out a saner - looking party . In comparison of them Cornus ' crew were an orderly Philistine band . The men are bad enough , but Sarah — but herself ! Bacchante and romp mixed in just and fine proportions as her sister looks , her stricken conscience tells her that she herself far outdoes her , though she dares not ask the looking - glass for confirmation of this conviction ; but during the past mad hour has not Sarah been tame and mild when compared with her ? "
115523	115549	115243	115243	you	1750	" says Bellairs at last , in a lamb 's voice , in which no one would recognise the hilarious bellow of five minutes ago . "
115563	115583	115243	115243	you	1750	" replies Sarah drily . As she speaks she turns to her dazed elder , and lowers her voice . "
115600	115893	115586	115586	you	1752	" Belinda turns in stupid compliance towards the door . As she makes her difficult way through the little passage , blocked with articles of furniture piled one atop of another , her consternation deepens . He must have had to climb like a cat over his own armchair in order to gain ingress into his own drawing - room ! It is impossible ! It would be adding insult to injury to present herself before him in her present dishevelment . She must needs repair to her own room ; must needs , with intense repugnance , snatch a glance at her own disordered image in the toilet - glass . The case is even worse than she had feared . There is even more of the Moenad than she had apprehended in her reflection . But there is no time to be lost . Each moment that passes , leaving her offence unacknowledged , lends it a deeper dye . A brush snatched up and hastily applied to her revolted hair ; two hand - palms , but they are hot too , held for a moment to her blazing cheeks in the vain effort to cool them , and she is off again . Outside his door she hesitates an instant , listening in scared heart - sinking ; but there is no sound audible within , so , plucking up what courage she may , she enters . He is seated at his writing - table , in the leathern chair in which she has passed such count - less hours of ennui and fatigue , slaving in his service . The thought emboldens her a little , and she advances up the room and stands beside him . "
115900	115909	115910	115910	I	0	" she asks in a rather faltering voice . "
115915	115951	115910	115910	I	0	" It is a whole minute before he answers . There is no plainer mode of showing resentment than by letting sixty seconds elapse between a question addressed to you and your answer . Then : "
115958	115966	115952	115952	I	0	" he answers woodenly , still writing ; "
115986	116000	115968	115968	I	0	" There is something so galling in the implication that her spirit rises . "
116009	116034	116002	116002	you	1753	" she asks violently ; then , recollecting how gravely in the wrong she has been , she masters herself , and says apologetically : "
116061	116074	116049	116049	I	0	" He gives a little odious , though perhaps pardonable , laugh . "
116081	116082	116049	116049	I	0	" "
116088	116115	116083	116083	I	0	" she repeats again , with uneasy iteration , shifting wretchedly from one foot to the other , as she stands in her culpritship before him ; "
116148	116190	116139	116139	I	0	" There is a wistful accent audible even to herself in her voice , and she looks at him with a sort of forlorn hope that he may be touched by it . If he is , he masters it admirably . "
116193	116198	116139	116139	I	0	" he answers cuttingly . "
116231	116310	116215	116215	your	0	" She had thought that her cheeks were already as hot as cheeks could be , but the sudden influx of blood that his words send pulsing into them shows her her mistake . Hitherto , shame at and repentance of her frolic , joined with a sincere desire to make amends for it , have been her predominant emotions ; now at once they vanish , and give place to a biting sense of injustice and aversion . "
116321	116345	116215	116215	your	0	" she says in a hard voice , in which is no trace of the gentle , humble key of her earlier utterance ; "
116352	116358	116215	116215	your	0	" with a burning blush , "
116370	116371	116215	116215	your	0	" "
116393	116419	116420	116420	You	0	" he replies resentfully . There is something , or she fancies so , of menacing in his tone , at which her gorge rises . "
116423	116435	116420	116420	You	0	" she says , in a low but extremely distinct voice , "
116477	116517	116525	116525	he	1760	" Having delivered herself of this amiable reminder , she walks towards the door , not giving one glance to see how far her shaft has gone home . On reaching her own room she breaks into hysterical sobbing . "
116536	116953	116525	116525	he	1760	" she cries . This is , perhaps , putting it a little strongly . One would have thought that upon the most inveterate pleasure - seekers such a cold - water douche could not have been poured without producing a permanently healing effect ; that never again would the members of the little band , so disastrously surprised in mid - romp by the Professor of Etruscan , lift up their humbled heads from the dust , into which that one glance of his narrow eye had abased them . And yet it is but too true — such is the potency of the spring and youth spirits , when they meet in lusty embrace — that before forty - eight hours are over they are planning another excursion . A whole long day spent chiefly in her own society , for Belinda has had to expiate by working double tides her short idleness , has convinced Sarah of the wisdom and necessity of catering for her own amusement . By some means , whether of writing , or meeting on neutral ground , she has established a communication with Bellairs and his friends ; and in their eager hands , guided by her commanding spirit , the project of a new expedition for the following day — i.e. , the day but one after their being put to the rout — speedily takes shape . It is indeed shorn of its former noble proportions , for it is not likely that Mrs. Forth will soon be indulged with another whole holiday ; but upon a part — the latter part — of the afternoon she may , without undue sanguineness , reckon as lawfully her own ; and now that the evenings are so long , it is of little consequence how late , whether lit by red sun or white moon , they return . Belinda has no share in the formation of the plan . She knows of it , indeed . Did she not know of it , would she not have broken down under the pitiless labours of the interminable day that intervenes between it and its abortive predecessor ? A sort of superstition keeps her from inquiring as to any of its details . To take for granted that it will happen , will , judging by all precedent and analogy , probably prevent it . Much less dares she ask whether Rivers is to be included in it . "
116965	117027	116954	116954	I	0	" she says at last , over - night , to her sister , emboldened by the after - dinner twilight , in which they are strolling round and round the odorous garden plat , and fondly trusting that for once that sister 's acuteness may be at fault , and not detect the ill - hidden motive of her words . "
117033	117061	117062	117062	You	1762	" repeats Sarah carelessly , lifting and spreading out one hand , and striking the fingers , one after one , with the index of the other . "
117064	117069	117070	117070	I	0	" touching the thumb , "
117082	117094	117078	117080	Mr. De Lisle	284	" She has reached the little finger , and there pauses . "
117101	117115	117078	117080	Mr. De Lisle	284	" comments Belinda , in tremulous interrogation . Sarah does not contradict her . "
117124	117134	117116	117116	We	1765	" says Mrs. Forth , after a short silence . "
117139	117242	117243	117243	You	1766	" assents Sarah . Belinda 's heart beats low . She withdraws her hand from her sister 's arm , upon which it has been resting , ostensibly to hold up her gown ; but in a moment that gown is again trailing unregarded behind her . Why has she been gazing with such elation at the steady roses and ambers of the west ? Promise - breaking as evening skies are , surely no sky could break such a promise as this ! If what Sarah implies be true , what does it matter whether that promise be kept or broken ? "
117250	117269	117247	117248	Mr. Rivers	162	" she says at last , with abrupt desperation , seeing that her sister volunteers no further information . "
117277	117321	117270	117270	I	0	" replies Sarah gravely , with a slight stress upon the pronoun . Mrs. Forth does not perceive the significant accentuation ; and only gathers that her fears are realized . It is a moment or two before she can speak . Then , "
117326	117336	117270	117270	I	0	" she says , in a resentful low key ; "
117353	117354	117338	117338	I	0	" "
117357	117362	117338	117338	I	0	" interrupts Sarah calmly , "
117415	117670	117413	117413	him	162	" The morning has come . The sunset has been better than its word . No average fair day is this , upon which it simply does not rain , but one that earth , air , and sky from morn to eve vie in nobly decking ; such a day as that one before which old George Herbert poured the nard and spices of his curious sweet verse , which for two hundred years has risen to most hearts and lips on any day of unusual summer splendour . It is certain that this time the weather at least will throw no obstacle in her way . The forenoon , of hot labour to the one sister , of luxurius cool idling to the other , is past and gone . So is luncheon . The hour for departure draws near . Sarah is already dressed ; dressed to the last button of her Paris gloves ; to the last bewitching pinch given to the fantastic rural hat , whose pulling to pieces and rebuilding has largely helped in the beguiling of her lonely morning . Belinda , usually punctual , and to - day , as one would think , with treble motives for punctuality , has not yet appeared . But just as the impatient Sarah is turning over in her mind the advisability of hurrying her by a call , she enters . At sight of her , an exclamation of surprise and remonstrance rises to her sister 's lips . "
117675	117729	117413	117413	him	162	" For , indeed , about Mrs. Forth there is no appearance of festal preparation ; her head is uncovered ; she is in her usual working morning gown — a gown to which traditions of ink and folios seem continually to adhere ; her steps are languid , and her eyes dead . "
117735	117746	117413	117413	him	162	" she answers doggedly , throwing herself into a chair . "
117753	117754	117747	117747	I	0	" "
117759	117784	117747	117747	I	0	" repeats the other , with an incredulity born of the recollection of Belinda 's passionately eager watching of the sunset over - night ; "
117787	117788	117747	117747	I	0	" "
117795	117806	117807	117807	he	1768	" replies Belinda , in a dull , level tone ; "
117814	117815	117810	117810	he	1768	" "
117825	117826	117827	117827	I	0	" "
117844	117856	117827	117827	I	0	" rejoins the other , with a sort of apathetic satire . "
117877	117878	117892	117892	you	1769	" "
117883	117888	117890	117890	I	0	" says Sarah bluntly — "
117916	117917	117906	117906	I	0	" "
117925	117947	117918	117918	I	0	" replies Belinda , with the same artificial tameness ; then , life coming back in poignant pain into her tone : "
117965	117982	118000	118000	they	1772	" turning over writhingly in her chair , and half burying her face in the cushion , "
118034	118058	118059	118059	You	1769	" She ends with something not far removed from a sob ; then , sitting upright again , and resentfully regarding her sister : "
118082	118083	118086	118086	you	1769	" "
118092	118097	118086	118086	you	1769	" replies Sarah calmly . "
118136	118137	118265	118266	Mrs. Baker	213	" "
118142	118164	118265	118266	Mrs. Baker	213	" cries Belinda , catching eagerly at this suggestion , and with a feeling as of a burden most unaccountably lightened ; "
118174	118261	118265	118266	Mrs. Baker	213	" How comparatively easy it will be to administer Professor Forth 's drops , with no simultaneous mental consciousness maddening her of the dazzling water , the sheltering grey - green willow - arch , and of Rivers lying beneath it , laughing as Sarah , alas ! knows how to make him laugh , stretched in lazy forgetful enjoyment at her feet . The distinctly disappointed expression painted on Miss Churchill 's pink and white lineaments brings her back to a consciousness of her selfishness . "
118273	118282	118268	118268	she	213	" she says slowly , in reluctant suggestion ; "
118300	118320	118327	118328	Mrs. Baker	213	think"—dragging her words some - what , and hoping , oh , how ardently ! for an answer in the negative—"that
118333	118334	118327	118328	Mrs. Baker	213	" "
118339	118388	118392	118392	them	1780	" replies Sarah joyfully , the sparkle returning at a handgallop to her eyes . Belinda has already repented of her offer , but shame prevents her now going back from it . She seats herself at the writing - table , and Sarah walks to the window . "
118401	118407	118408	118408	they	1780	" she says , chuckling ; "
118434	118511	118425	118425	they	1780	" Belinda writes on : that most unkillable of plants — hope — sending up a little fresh shoot in her heart ; after all , fate may be kind . It may have sent Mrs. Baker a previous engagement , a headache — what not ? But fate disdains to be dictated to . If it is kind to us , it is out of its own free will , and not at our bidding . "
118517	118553	118512	118512	She	1782	" says Sarah , returning in an impossibly short space of time ; Sarah , who , to ensure the greater security and speed , has insisted upon being herself the bearer of the note . "
118584	118613	118614	118614	I	0	" Miss Churchill is bustling away , perhaps not very anxious to take a prolonged farewell look at her sister 's face ; but that sister detains her . "
118625	118893	118614	118614	I	0	" she says feverishly , catching up a shabby garden - hat , and throwing it on her hot head as she speaks . Before she has gone six yards she has repented of her impulse . There seems to be in these days not one of her actions of which she does not repent before it is halfway to execution . Why should she , of her own free will , forcing him to a comparison between them , set herself , poor workaday drudge as she is , beside this charming holiday creature — so delicately fine , so infectiously gay ? Even now she would go back , but it is too late . The young men have caught sight of her : in a moment they have all met . Rivers exhales a heavy sight of relief . He has had bad dreams , and a dragging presage of ill - luck hanging about him ; but both dreams and presage are as false as dreams and presages mostly are . Had not they told him that she would be prevented coming ? and is not she here standing in beautiful bodily presence before him ? Is he likely to observe the age of her hat , or the humility of her gown ? He , never one of those man - milliners who can price , to a groat , a woman 's laces ; he , to whom it has always seemed as if , whatever sheath his bright flower - lady wore , she informed it with her own glory . "
118901	118924	118925	118925	We	1785	" she says , letting her hand linger for an instant in his , and lifting her melancholy eyes to his face . "
118927	118940	118944	118944	you	0	" he says , laughing softly , though his heart misgives him ; "
118946	118947	118944	118944	you	0	" "
118953	118993	118944	118944	you	0	" she answers quietly , though her eyes rivet themselves with an intentness of passionate jealousy on his face , to see whether he looks sorry enough . He steps back a pace or two , loosing her hand . "
118997	119031	119069	119069	you	162	" he echoes blankly . His dreams , his presage spoke true after all — worse than true , indeed ! for have not they tricked him with the shadow of a hope ? "
119038	119052	119069	119069	you	162	" cries Sarah blithely , marshalling her pack and whipping up the stragglers ; "
119099	119436	119069	119069	you	162	" She addresses him so decidedly that he has no alternative but to answer her , nor does she again let him go . Before Belinda can realize that it is so , they are all off , walking away from her — away to the river and the willows . Without one word of regret for her absence , without even an inquiry as to the cause of that absence , he is gone — gone a - pleasuring ! His face indeed looked blank for a moment , but for how long , pray ? Does it look blank still ? Will it look blank under the willows ? If her withdrawal from the party had been to him what his would have been to her , would he have gone at all ? would not he have framed some excuse for escape at the last moment ? Nor does she , in her unjust heart - bitterness , reflect that he could have taken no surer way of compromising the woman he loved ! Happily perhaps for her , she is not long able to give herself up undisturbed to reflections of the above kind . She must needs retun without further delay to her treadmill . It is true that the morning , and the morning 's Menander , are over — ill as is the Professor , he is not too ill for Menander — but her afternoon taskwork is still unperformed ; her daily two hours ' ministrations to her imbecile mother - in - law — two hours during which that mother - in - law 's attendant is released , and sent out into the fresh air to lay in a stock of ozone and endurance to support her through the other twenty - two . The thought of her fellow drudge makes Belinda remorsefully hasten her steps . What business has she , with her selfish repinings , to defer and shorten that other drudge 's holiday ? "
119442	119454	119069	119069	you	162	" she says good - naturedly , as she relieves guard . "
119474	119553	119468	119468	I	0	" Oven - like as is the temperature of old Mrs. Forth 's room , her easy - chair is drawn up close to the blazing fire . The chill of extremest eld is upon her . Her mind is so completely gone , that she is incapable of recognizing or identifying even the persons habitually about her ; nor does her daily interview with her daughter - in - law ever begin with any other phrase than : "
119575	119697	119567	119567	I	0	" Her conversation , which never ceases , consists of this question repeated ad infinitum ; of inquiries after various long - dead members of her family , supposed by her to be alive and sometimes even in the room ; and of information such as that her father has been sitting with her ( if he were alive he would be one hundred and sixty years old ! ) , and that it is wonderful how he keeps his memory . Belinda seats herself beside her . After all , it requires no great call upon the intellect to repeat at intervals in a slow , loud voice ( for , with the other faculties , hearing too is gone ): "
119715	119730	119731	119731	He	243	" varied occasionally by such answers as these , called forth by appropriate inquires , "
119735	119736	119737	119737	He	243	" "
119745	119746	119737	119737	He	243	" "
119750	119770	119771	119771	They	1791	" But between her mechanical words there is plenty of room to interpolate thoughts that but little match them . "
119880	119941	119872	119873	the party	3959	" It is easy to tell , by the writhing of her hands , in what manner she pictures that division effected . Virtually , then , it will be a tête - à - tête . It will be alone together that they will lie under the willows ! Belinda 's attention wanders wide . Twice she has answered , "
119945	119951	119872	119873	the party	3959	" when she should have answered "
119955	120062	119872	119873	the party	3959	" ; and is on the point of repeating the error a third time , when a vague fidgetiness in her interlocutor 's manner — hazily conscious of something gone wrong — recalls her to herself . The two hours march by . The nurse has taken her at her word , and is extending a little the border of her liberty . Presently the Professor enters : enters to pay that punctual daily five minutes ' visit , which is the share he contributes towards the tendance of his parent . For a wonder , she knows him , without being told who he is . "
120070	120076	120068	120068	James	243	" is her first question . "
120082	120083	120068	120068	James	243	" "
120086	120095	120068	120068	James	243	" ( with great animation and surprise ) , "
120099	120100	120106	120107	my mother	614	" "
120108	120114	120106	120107	my mother	614	" ( very loud ) . "
120149	120892	120106	120107	my mother	614	" Belinda gasps . She has heard it all scores of times before : at first with pitiful wonder ; then with a dreary amusement ; and lastly with the indifferent apathy of use . To - day there seems to be a new and grisly jocularity about it . This then is life ! A youth of passionately craving and foregoing ; long pursuing and never overtaking ; of hearts that leap for a moment and ache for a year ; of jealousies that poison food and massacre sleep — leading up to an old age of garrulous idiocy ! She is released at last : set free to amuse herself as she best pleases . But of what amusement is a mind in such tune as hers capable ? She has taken her hat in her hand , and walks along drawing in great gulps of the exquisite evening air ; while her feet , without her bidding , lead her to the river - side . Oxbridge is , as everyone knows , rich in two rivers , and it is to the lesser of these streams that the boating - party has committed itself . It is this lesser stream , also , which for a short part of its course St. Ursula 's green meadow and pleasant walk border . It is without any acknowledged hope of meeting them that she takes the direction indicated . It is likely that they will be so early returning ? Is it likely that they , or any one of them , will be in much haste to abridge such an excursion ? Tasting , as she now does , the delicacy of the air ; viewing the homely loveliness of bushed bank and satin - sliding river , she can the better and more enviously figure to herself what its charm has been . But the air and the motion do her good . Beside her the stream steals along — a soothing , sluggish companion . No song or rush has it , like the flashing northern becks ; but what green reflections in it ! What long water - weeds , swinging slowly to its slow current ! How the willows — pensive almost as olives in their grave dim leafage — have printed themselves on its quite , silent heart . How riotously green are the fat low meadows that , all winter long , the floods had drowned ! Here , a May - bush has strewn the white largesse of its petals on the water , and there another , less overblown , stoops to look at its own pink face 's double . There are two cuckoos : one loud and near , one soft and distant , answering each other across the meads . Beneath the bank at her foot , an undergraduate lies stretched along his boat , with his book . Three others in a punt are waggishly trying to upset each other . She sits down on a bench and idly watches them , till , with shouts of young laughter , they float out of sight . Another punt , a canoe , a skiff , a boat with ladies in it . Her heart jumps . Ah , no ! not her ladies ! a boat freighted with hawthorn boughs and guelder - rose branches , that tell of a joyous day 's Maying in the country . Endless young gentlemen in flannels , punting , sculling , lying supine . She has fallen into a dull comparison between their gaiety and her own gloom , when her attention is aroused by the sound of a loud voice coming from some bark yet unseen , that is approaching round the corner . Many of the boys ' voices are loud : what is there then in the timbre of this voice that makes Belinda , at the instant that it strikes her ear , hastily rise and pursue her walk ? But she might as well have remained seated on the bench . A punt has come into sight , guided , with an unskilfulness that seems almost intentional , by a young man ; colliding frequently with other punts , bumping with many jars against the bank , and with an ample female form reclining complacently — superior to bumps or jars — in its stern . "
120897	120918	120919	120919	Belinda	134	" she cries , gesticulating with her umbrella in a way which alone would have been enough to identify her . "
120923	120968	120921	120921	Belinda	134	" All the luxurious young gentlemen turn their heads to look . One of the white terriers seated by their masters in boats , sets up his nose and howls . Reluctant and dyed with shame , Belinda steps to the water 's edge . "
120979	121001	120969	120970	George Sampson	270	" cries Miss Watson , in a tone which can leave no member of the University ignorant of the fact related ; "
121048	121055	121044	121044	you	1804	" ( appealing to her swain ) "
121073	121110	121057	121058	Mrs. Forth	271	" The unhappy young man murmurs something that may be taken for assent . The perspiration of anguish pours from his brow , upon which is written a dogged shame and wrath too deep for words . "
121113	121129	121057	121058	Mrs. Forth	271	" pursues the other , in answer to Belinda 's emphatic negative of her proposal . "
121193	121240	121241	121241	I	0	" Without looking , Belinda is hotly aware that a pardonable smile has stolen over the features of more than one of the listening boys , at the publication of her domestic secrets . There is not one of them who has not dropped his book . "
121249	121266	121267	121267	You	1804	" she mutters in hasty farewell . But Miss Watson has not yet done with her . "
121285	121292	121274	121274	you	1804	" cries she , laughing resonantly . "
121310	121359	121362	121362	you	1804	" Belinda 's cheek , hot with shame a moment ago , grows pale . The impulse to flee leaves her ; a contrary impulse , such as draws the palpitating canary to the cage - wires and the cat 's claws , roots her to the spot . "
121365	121370	121362	121362	you	1804	" she asks faltering . "
121372	121404	121405	121405	she	0	she"—lowering her voice , so as not to be heard by anyone else , hating herself for descending to such a question , and trying to carry it off with a spurious merriment—"was
121416	121417	121405	121405	she	0	" "
121422	121430	121405	121405	she	0	" repeats the other in loud irony . "
121459	121536	121451	121451	Rivers	162	" This is what Belinda has been angling to hear , and now she has heard it . It is not then the figment of her disordered fancy ; it must indeed be ovious to have hit the eyes of so coarse and casual an observer as Miss Watson . Nor does the recollection of how much she had profited by her former prompt action upon information derived from the same source recur to her memory . "
121550	121582	121548	121548	he	162	" cries the other jocosely ; and then she bumps off again in her punt , bawling , as she floats down the stream , to her oppressed and silent boatman . "
121607	122368	122369	122369	I	0	" A week — a whole week — only a week ! There are two opposing ways of looking at this or any other period of time ; one of impatient marvelling at its immensity , the other of gasping consternation at its shortness . It is needless to ask which of these two moods is Mrs. Forth 's , with regard to Rivers ' holiday . Only a week ! How many times , during its seven days , does she , with that all - answering phrase , stop conscience 's mouth ? Of what use for only a week to practise self - government ? of what use for only a week to question , with too nice a closeness , her heart as to the cause of its leapings and sinkings ? her temper as to the reason of its endless variabilities ? her thoughts as to the path they take ? or her imagination as to the length of its tether ? Only a week ! Too short a space to do anything in but enjoy — to enjoy — to enjoy ! With eyes resolutely shut to the cost — to the heavy score running up , that at the week 's end will have to be paid . Oh , not too short to enjoy in ! It is not all enjoyment . Already , before two days of it are past , it has been marred by irksome labour , by balked expectation , by unreasoning jealousy — a jealousy whose unreason she herself , in her calmer moments , recognises ; which in Rivers ' presence dies of famine , having less than nothing to live upon , but , once out of the reassurance of his eyes , revives and bulks big again . Rare indeed is it for one successful excursion not to engender another or several more . The weather holds . The Professor 's heart or liver — it is never quite clearly understood which of these organs is affected — has recovered its balance , upset by his wife 's Walpurgis day . Belinda has three consecutive afternoons of freedom — three afternoons of being swiftly pulled down the river , that brave water - way alive with vigorous youthhood — of gaily drinking tea and sucking cider - cup through straws at little river - side alehouses — of picking the freakish fritillaries in the meadows — of being towed back in dreamy languor at night - fall or star - rise — of loitering homewards with hands full of flag - flowers — of parting at the garden gate . To that parting there comes , each evening , a deeper deadlier sweetness . It does not lie in words . There is not one word that , did the Professor protrude his velvetcapped head from his bower window , need be withdrawn . Belinda is living on her capital . At the week 's end she will be bankrupt ; let her then be merry while she may ! Perhaps Sarah acquiesces in her sister 's view of the unimportance of any course of action that must be compressed into so short a period of time as a week . Perhaps , being in her way wise , she recognises the futility of interference . Perhaps her hands are too full of her own affairs to have much time or attention to spare for her sister 's ; for seldom has Miss Churchill been in such amorous straits of her own making as at present . The course of allurement which had merely warmed up the heavy German soldiers into a pleasant and manageable tenderness , has wrought three inflammable English boys to a white heat . Daily , and in proportion as their inconvenient ardour for Sarah increases , does their friendship for each other — close and warm to begin with — decline , and tend towards the opposite pole of animosity . On the last expedition but one , she dare no longer accept a bunch of fritillaries from one , without instantly crowding her hands with a similar bunch from each of the others . She can now never drink less than three cups of afternoon tea ; as that affords to each an opportunity of handing her one . Even Bellairs , early convinced of the hopelessness of his adoration of Mrs. Forth , is now wholly hers , far more wholly indeed than she at all wishes . "
122380	122426	122369	122369	I	0	" she cries , in a tone more nearly approaching tearful vexation than is often to be heard in her joyous voice , as she and her sister patrol in their wonted fashion the garden , on the morning of the week 's last day . "
122429	122445	121548	121548	he	162	them"—by this comprehensive phrase she always designates the noble army of her admirers , past and present—"none
122476	122477	122460	122460	they	1809	" "
122484	122509	122460	122460	they	1809	" replies Belinda slowly . She says it as a consolation to her sister , but the application that she makes is to herself . "
122516	122521	122460	122460	they	1809	" replies Sarah gloomily ; "
122559	122566	122556	122556	I	0	" with a burst of petulance , "
122617	122624	122608	122608	I	0	" with a laugh of annoyance ; "
122643	122654	122640	122640	I	0	" with something of her old sidling , coaxing manner , "
122666	122676	122656	122656	you	1810	" Belinda smiles ; a bitter smile of recollection . "
122699	122926	122938	122938	he	1814	" It is true that the last day has come ; and the last excursion . All through the previous night , all morning , Belinda has been dogged by the icy terror — no weaker word suffices — that something may occur to prevent it . She has asked after the Professor 's organs , with a solicitude whose treachery makes her blush . The very unbearableness of the idea lends it a horrid probability . In this our life are not the things too bad to be faced , those that oftenest happen ? The hour comes — the meeting at the corner ( never again have the enamoured youths ventured across the threshold of the house they have desecrated!)—the walk to the river . Sarah has vainly tried to hook herself on to her sister ; but — Bellairs having out - manoeuvred his fellows , and compelled them to content themselves with the chaperone of a former expedition , civilly invited to complete the party — has dropped resignedly behind with him , her face sufficiently revealing that she is braced for the worst . The river is reached . In the choosing the boats and arranging the cushions a little diversion is effected , which gives Sarah the opportunity to pluck her sister by the sleeve , and pull her aside . "
122932	122937	122938	122938	he	1814	" she says morosely ; "
122964	122965	122956	122956	he	1814	" "
122974	122975	122971	122971	you	0	" "
122981	122996	122978	122978	I	0	" ( in a tone of extreme exasperation , and yet unwilling amusement ) . "
123007	123021	122978	122978	I	0	but"—with a rueful glance at the little craft now being made ready for her reception—"you
123051	123108	123111	123111	you	0	" For a moment Mrs. Forth looks before her in blank perplexity ; then , all at once , an idea , habited in a sudden lovely blush , rushes into her mind . Why not ? Is not it the last day ? But she does not at once clothe it in speech . Instead : "
123120	123130	123113	123114	Mrs. Baker	213	" she asks . Sarah shrugs her shoulders impatiently . "
123147	123204	123138	123138	she	213	" There is no help for it , then . What other alternative can she propose ? It is no fault of hers ; accident , rather — fate — ill - luck ! She has done her best . How often during the past week has she told herself that she has done her best ! "
123216	123299	123214	123214	myself	0	" she says hurriedly , and not looking at her sister ; and then , several voices at once calling upon them , they rejoin the rest of the party . In a moment , as if some devil were behind her — or what in her present frame of mind would seem to her both more dangerous and more ugly — some amorous undergraduate , Sarah has , to ensure herself against ambush or surprise , skipped into the larger boat . "
123308	123322	123306	123306	her	1817	" says Belinda , standing flushed and downcast - eyed on the bank . "
123336	123600	123327	123328	some one	2370	" No one answers , and she steps — some one giving her a hand — into the dinghey . Some one instantly follows her , and takes up the sculls . It is not till they are well out in the stream , and not immediately even then , that she lifts her eyes . A sort of shame weighs them down . The manoeuvre was none of hers ; and yet it is by a manoeuvre that she has secured this final tête - à - tête with him . She does not even know whether it is in accordance with his wishes that she has acted . He has expressed no pleasure in the arrangement ; perhaps — her jealousy awaked in a moment from its always light sleep — he is vexed to have been baulked of Sarah 's company . Perhaps , even now , he is silently fighting with his disappointment . She snatches a fugitive glance at him — a glance that , in an instant , is turned away again ; for it has told her what she wished to learn . The cause of his dumbness is one which does not very often make us speechless in this our life . He can not speak for joy . She leans back satisfied and smiling . The New River is narrower , less of a great highway than the old one . Here are no imperative Eights , out of whose way all lesser boats must clear , under penalty of being apostrophized by a ferocious "
123606	123894	123327	123328	some one	2370	" and then run down . And yet there is no lack of company here either , on this splendid summer day . Above , the pale bright sky , holding her forget - me - not - coloured shield ; and below , the windings of the slow broad river , and the great expanse of hedgeless meadowland . The horses , summering there , stand knee - deep in the stream , eating , or pretending to eat , the weeds ; one having a wet roll of utter enjoyment in the shallows . Sheets of little ranunculus are all ablow , each stiff , straight stem and small white head erect on the water . Countless geese stalk along the meadow , waddling and cropping the grass . Others , like a white fleet , paddle and dive for water - weeds . Into the midst of this feathered Armada they see the larger boat , which has shot ahead of them , being lustily pulled to give it a fright ; instigated thereto by Sarah , who under the ægis of a female friend , and with Bellairs pulling stroke , and consequently divided from her by nearly the whole length of the boat , has resumed her usual hilarity , and by voice , gesture , and waved parasol , is encouraging her slaves . The geese separate , screeching and oaring away ; and one gosling , overtaken by the prow , dives and rises again ten paces away . Both Rivers and Belinda laugh . There is something healthy and clearing to the moral atmosphere in a joint laugh . Rivers ' mirth dies into a long sigh of contentment . "
123899	123915	123916	123916	I	0	" he says , resting on his oars , and staring up at the sky . "
123947	123963	123942	123942	I	0	" She does not ask him what the others were . Possibly she is incurious . "
123966	123993	123942	123942	I	0	" he says , bringing his eyes down again from the heaven above him , to the , to him , better heaven of her face , "
124018	124045	123942	123942	I	0	" As he speaks , a slight frown , not of displeasure at his harmless words , but of reflection and doubt , puckers her forehead . "
124050	124055	124047	124047	you	0	" she says slowly , "
124071	124076	124047	124047	you	0	" He looks surprised . "
124082	124083	124047	124047	you	0	" "
124086	124092	124047	124047	you	0	" she answers in confusion ; "
124106	124107	124108	124108	I	0	" "
124111	124120	124108	124108	I	0	" he answers calmly , though still surprised . "
124134	124135	124108	124108	I	0	" "
124145	124152	124153	124153	You	0	" she says , laughing awkwardly . "
124161	124219	124153	124153	You	0	" Difficult as it is to look him in the face , while guiltily conscious of the drift of her question , she yet eagerly fastens upon him a glance whose keenness no least tinge of discomfiture can escape . But none such meets her . He has resumed his leisurely rowing , but now stops again . "
124224	124229	124153	124153	You	0	" he cries abruptly . "
124247	124253	124238	124238	I	0	" She shakes her head . "
124262	124277	124238	124238	I	0	" ( with a twinge of self - pity , as she recalls her then mood)—"I
124300	124349	124293	124298	some one who had seen you	1824	" Surely he will now volunteer the mention of the lady by whom he was accompanied . She has paused on purpose to give him the opportunity , but he does not take it . He leans on his sculls , staring before him in wistful bitter thought . "
124356	124368	124369	124370	A lady	3108	" says Belinda presently , unable any longer to contain herself . "
124372	124378	124369	124370	A lady	3108	" he says , starting . "
124426	124431	124415	124416	an aunt	1829	" with a laugh , "
124450	124889	124415	124416	an aunt	1829	" So it is explained . How simple it sounds ! how obvious ! What is there in it , upon which any but a madwoman could have hung distrust or jealousy ? And yet it is upon this cock - and - bull story that she elected to shipwreck her life ! A sailing - boat , lurching and tacking , and heeling over , after the manner of such , and out of whose way they have to get , rouses them both , and they row on . The larger boat has pulled into the bank , in order to set the two dogs , in whom Sarah affects to detect symptoms of incipient sea - sickness , on shore , where they instantly begin to give a great deal of trouble . Punch — a dog of no ballast of mind , entirely losing his head in joy at his enlargement — first frolicsomely nips the sleepy horses ' heels , a civility which they return by viciously lashing out at him ; then chivies the geese , a levity which calls forth from the husband and father an awful chastisement of flapping wings , outstretched neck , and dreadfully wide - opened mouth . Slutty , on the other hand , for reasons best known to herself has set off galloping in the wrong direction , with her tail between her legs . Her recapture and the recovery and admonishment of Punch take so long , that the couple in the dinghey have time to get far ahead , and , rounding a reach of the river , to lose their companions from sight . On and on they float in their virtual aloneness , for in nothing do the two men punting , or the happy young fellow shooting past in his skiff , disturb their solitude . They speak ever less and less . Now and again , indeed , silence becomes too oppressive , and they speak ; but then speech grows over - pregnant , and they fly back to silence . Both are strung up to pleasure 's highest pitch , that pitch for which they will have to pay , and know that they will have to pay , so extortionately ; for pleasure , like the scorpion , is an animal that carries a sting in its tail . Upon enjoyment is set its keenest edge . The lark , lost in light above them , might be their spokesman , only that to their song , unlike his , there is ever that minor refrain : "
124898	124953	124954	124954	I	0	" What a nameless unreckoning elation the warm breeze lends , and the motion and the very throbbing of the gentle water against the passing keel ! She pulls up her sleeve , and dipping in her bared right arm , affects to imitate his gestures , and to oar the stream with it . "
124959	124965	124954	124954	I	0	" she cries , smiling . "
124980	125228	125229	125230	The Franklin	310	" He does not reply . He rows slowly on in a dream , his eyes intoxicatedly watching that pendent hand and swaying lily wrist . He always thinks her last word or action prettier and better than all its predecessors . But surely she can never outdo this . He might borrow Florizel 's words without a changed syllable . He pulls , still in a dream , beneath the willows . A poplar , shivering perpetually , flutters and trembles against the sky 's perfect azure over their heads . Still in a dream , and at her orders , he leaves her lying pensive and cool on her cushions , and scrambles into the field to fetch flowers for her . He comes back with a great nosegay , which he lays in her lap : yellow flags , beckabunga , forget - me - nots bigger and bluer than the petted garden ones , a scrap of catch - fly , a handful of stitchworts , powdery purple grasses , all plucked haphazard , and yet gathered into such a perfect posy as no after - arranging , or sorting , or matching of colours could compass . She tells him so . Was ever man , for so poor a gift , so royally thanked ? Their companions have passed them again ; the dogs re - embarked , and the whole company singing a gay part - song . No other than "
125234	125704	125229	125230	The Franklin	310	" How entrancingly sweet and merry sound the nonsensical old words across the water ! Belinda and Rivers must needs follow them to the rendezvous — the little rural Trout Inn , where they are to have tea . It is brought out to them , in an arbour overlooking the stream , by a stout wench ; thick bread and butter , great wedges of plain cake , a tea - set where no two articles are of the same make or pattern . Sarah , having tided over her Bellairs difficulty , and restored to her happy - go - lucky confidence of being able to keep the rest of her team well in hand , is in delightful spirits . There are too many other visitors at the Trout to make any more glees advisable ; but she is good enough to indulge the company with several quiet performances of a juggling nature , which make no noise , and need attract no attention — such as sticking half - pence into her eyes , and disposing them ingeniously about her other features . Belinda , too , is in wild mirth — as wild as that of the unlucky day of Blind Man 's Buff . She is not nearly so clever with the halfpence as her sister ; but in point of mere animal spirits she almost exceeds her . When , however , the tea - party and its humours are ended — when , in their former order , they are on their way home again — those factitious spirits drop like a wind at sunset . The feast is all but over : surely , since the world was , never has any been so poignantly relished . In each moment have not they tasted a hundred years of ordinary tame pleasures ? But it is now nigh being done , and pay - day stands at the door . The light is low and level ; the geese have gone to bed , grey head and yellow nose tucked beneath greay wing . The horses ' shadows stretch , longer than camelopards , across the meadow . There is scarcely any need to use the oars , wind and current helping them ; they are floating — oh , how swiftly!—to where the one great dome , and the many spires , momently growing taller , tell where the fair city lies . The last hour of the last day is running out . When that dome and those spires are reached , it will have run out . The last hour ! How many things there are to be said in a last hour ! And yet the only phrase that will rise to either of their lips is , "
125711	125757	125229	125230	The Franklin	310	" Even to that they do not give utterance : not until they have slidden more than half - way home . Then , at sight of those rapidly nearing spires — those spires that mean the end — a sort of panic seizes Belinda : "
125763	125794	125229	125230	The Franklin	310	" she says half - breathlessly , looking down as if she would fain stop on the lovely evening water , quickly swishing past with a pleasant low sucking sound ; "
125803	125804	125229	125230	The Franklin	310	" "
125809	125830	125229	125230	The Franklin	310	" he repeats in a tone half - mazed , as of one not realizing the sense of the words . "
125838	125955	125229	125230	The Franklin	310	" she says very low . Still the keel quickly cutting the flood , and the water sucking . Why so fast ? In pity , why so fast ? The very sun — their last sun — seems hurrying more rapidly than his wo nt to his hot rose and cowslip coloured bed . At first they had had days ahead of them — such riches seem incredible — then hours , now minutes , and but few of them ; so few that surely there is not one of them to be wasted ! Perhaps it is this thought that sends such a passion of haste into the words with which he answers her : "
125964	126076	125229	125230	The Franklin	310	" She receives the suggestion in dead silence — a silence so dead as to give him time for a cold pang of fear that he has employed these priceless moments in offending his dear lady , and that she will part from him in displeasure . If his hand were laid upon her heart , he would know why she did not speak . In the last drunken week , she has not once had the courage to look her life , that is to be , in the eyes . Who , squandering and rioting in the now , dare ever face the then ? At last she stammers : "
126093	126094	125229	125230	The Franklin	310	" "
126103	126144	126097	126097	I	0	" He is lying on his oars now ; but still the boat drifts , drifts . She shakes her head with a little unhopeful smile ; though surely no hopeless heart ever leaped and sprang as hers is doing . "
126151	126215	126097	126097	I	0	" His oars are quite out of the water ; he , at least , will have no share in accelerating the end . The drops gently drip from their blades . Twilight is taking her first grey steps across the plains , and the warm dew falls . Two or three of their dwindling store of minutes are gone before Rivers speaks . "
126231	126232	126233	126233	I	0	" "
126240	126271	126233	126233	I	0	" she answers idifferently , an unacknowledged disappointment at the apparent irrelevance of his remark , at his want of insistance upon his former suggestion , chilling heart and voice . "
126281	126308	126272	126272	You	1835	" Why is there such a catch in his breath as he asks this question ? What is it to him whether she goes or stays ? "
126332	126333	126326	126326	he	209	" "
126340	126341	126334	126334	He	209	" "
126344	126345	126334	126334	He	209	" "
126348	126349	126334	126334	He	209	" "
126362	126386	126353	126358	my mother - in - law	1837	" with a slight satiric laugh . A pause . A flight of plovers , going bedwards , speck the sky above them . "
126398	126399	126353	126358	my mother - in - law	1837	" "
126405	126406	126353	126358	my mother - in - law	1837	" "
126416	126433	126435	126435	my	0	" Again she laughs , and her laugh is of the same unmerry character as before . "
126451	126490	126435	126435	my	0	" Another pause . The plovers have dwindled to nothing ; the other boat is lost to sight , far ahead . What is he going to say that makes him fidget so uneasily with his unused oars ? "
126501	126524	126525	126525	My	0	" Again she laughs ; but the irony is gone , driven away by a tremor that is even farther from gaiety . "
126545	126546	126525	126525	My	0	" "
126562	126563	126525	126525	My	0	" "
126568	126603	126604	126604	I	0	" And then again there is silence . How twilight is taming day 's gaudiness ! but doing it with so lovesome a mien , that who can regret the gone greens and blues ? "
126607	126631	126604	126604	I	0	" he begins . How dry his throat is ! He would be glad of a draught from the river to moisten it . "
126645	126787	126604	126604	I	0	" It is out now ! For good or for evil , it is said ; and in uncontrollable anxiety he leans forward , the better to read in her face how she takes it . She is as dead silent as she had been at his first suggestion of the possibility of their meeting again ; but perhaps he has learnt to interpret that silence better . Must not she needs set some order in that riotous heart of hers before she can speak at all ? Surely the earth is mistaken in thinking that night is coming . Is not it the morning that is born ? His hand has lifted a corner of the great night - curtain that has hung , black and impenetrable , before her future life . Dare she let him lift it all ? "
126796	126803	126604	126604	I	0	" he says in great agitation . "
126832	126847	126848	126848	We	1843	" Not mind seeing him ! At that she can not choose but smile . "
126874	126938	126848	126848	We	1843	" There is such a desperate urgency of asking in his eyes , that she dare not look at him . What can she answer ? Still that unmastered riot in her heart ! and how near the landing - place is growing ! All the sail - boats with furled sails and lowered masts ; all the row - boats gathered home . "
126946	126961	126848	126848	We	1843	" she says , with a laugh that has a touch of the hysteric . "
126965	126970	126848	126848	We	1843	" he answers blankly . "
126976	127019	126848	126848	We	1843	" There are not more than eight boat - lengths to go . In those eight boat - lengths she must decide one way or the other ; for the rest of the party are gathered in hilarious talk about the landing - place—"Little
127021	127045	126848	126848	We	1843	" and many other worthy partsongs having wrought one and all to the highest pitch of good - fellowship — waiting for them . "
127053	127071	126848	126848	We	1843	" she says almost inaudibly , and shaking like a poplar leaf , that is never still ; "
127080	127081	127082	127082	I	0	" "
127085	127122	127082	127082	I	0	" he answers , catching at her suggestion , with a relief proportioned to the consternation with which his eye has been measuring the half - dozen yards left him in which to plead his cause . "
127132	128112	128113	128113	You	1848	" Nor have either he or she the candour to own to themselves or each other what is perfectly well known to both , that in the Long Vacation Oxbridge will be innocent of the presence of any one of those friends . This is their real parting . The week and Rivers are both gone . Belinda 's life has returned to its old channel , the channel in which it ran before the party at St. Ursula 's . The weather has ceased to be a matter of the slightest interest . It is not of the least consequence what weather there is , or whether there is any weather at all ! Done with are all tappings of weather - glasses , watchings of the march of clouds . The door - bell may ring itself off its wire , without making her attention swerve by one hair's - breadth from Menander , or interfering at all with the coherence and patience of her answers to her mother - in - law as to the date at which they are going to bury that mother - in - law 's husband , whose obsequies appear to have been unaccountably deferred for twenty - five years . There is no more talk of water - parties . Sarah herself , too late convinced of the peril of those excursions , confines herself and her followers to safe games of tennis in well - overlooked public places , where they will have no chance of reading her eyes either right or wrong , or , at all events , of telling her the result of their readings . Mrs. Forth 's life has resumed the tame course which it was taking on the day of Sarah 's arrival ; but how different a spirit now guides it ! Whither have flown the sullen discontent , the dull revolt , the rare mirth that bit , and the frequent irony that pricked and stung ? Now , if the Professor be cross , she shrugs her shoulders good - humouredly . He is old ! He means nothing by it ! It is an infirmity . After all , why should she mind ? How does it hurt her ? If he keeps her slaving long beyond her canonical hours in his close study , why so much the more does she enjoy afterwards the breath of the garden and the white pinks bursting so quickly into spicy bloom ? If he complain of his affection of heart , liver , or spleen , she is equally ready to believe in and sympathize with each and all , to suggest remedies , or apply them . Never has Sarah been more puzzled , or her sagacity put more at fault , than by her sister 's behaviour . For it is not the mood of a day . The consciousness of being observed and of the necessity for self - control might have lent her for a while a spurious cheerfulness ; but could it have given her that easy , unforced serenity which lasts undimmed through Sarah 's stay — which , indeed , shows every symptom of holding out indefinitely beyond it ? It is not from the post , as Miss Churchill at first suspected , that she derives her support . The postman 's arrival obviously causes her not a flutter ; nor does she exhibit the slightest tendency towards a surreptitious posting of her own letter's — worst sign that can appear in a connubial heaven . It is not , then , upon a clandestine correspondence that she is feeding and blooming , so fair and fine . That an undoubtedly hard - working common hand , or , still more , foreman in an iron foundry , would be likely soon to have another leisure week at his disposal , seems to her improbable . That Belinda can be nourishing any hopes of a visit to Milnthorpe seems to her more improbable still . That , satisfied with the sight of her lost love , she can have settled down contentedly into the perennial jogtrot of an existence without him , seems to her most improbable of all . She watches her sister narrowly ; sees her severe lips surprised now and then into an apparently causeless smile ; catches her singing under her breath , as she waters her drouthy plants ; sees her staid walk about the garden occasionally inclined to degenerate into a light - hearted run with the dogs . But she does not surprise her secret . And meanwhile time goes on . The yearly gaieties with which the summer Term at Oxbridge concludes are over and gone Mrs. Forth , chaperoning her sister , has taken part in them all — balls , fêtes , theatre ; has seen the masons dance in their aprons , and heard the undergraduates in all the glory of their immemorial screeching . She has taken part in all , and has apparently enjoyed them with a wholesome temperate gaiety ; as far removed from the unnatural elation of the Blind Man 's Buff , as from the inert gloom of the previous period . With Term is to end Sarah 's visit ; and on the day following her departure the Professor is to shoulder his valise for the Bernese Oberland . The morning on which Mrs. Forth is to lose her sister has come . Sarah is taking her last stroll round the flower - beds , and across the square of sward over which she and Belinda have walked so many miles . Mrs. Forth has just joined her , issuing from the house with the end of a laugh still lingering about her mouth and eyes . "
128117	128127	128113	128113	You	1848	" says the other , turning to meet her . "
128137	128138	128129	128129	I	0	" "
128143	128153	128161	128161	her	1848	" replies Belinda , bubbling over again with mirth . "
128221	128232	128191	128191	she	2549	" Sarah joins in the laugh , but not warmly . "
128236	128241	128191	128191	she	2549	" she says indignantly , "
128261	128274	128191	128191	she	2549	" Belinda bends her charming head in a nod of cheerful acquiescence . "
128279	128291	128191	128191	she	2549	" continues Miss Churchill , with a growing energy of ire . "
128323	128333	128335	128335	me	0	" glancing threateningly towards the windows of the house . "
128348	128376	128335	128335	me	0	" There is such a doughty purpose in her voice and her pink porcelain face , that Belinda , seizing her arm in apprehensive detention , cries : "
128412	128426	128401	128401	I	0	" At the last words , she has turned her head slightly aside . "
128440	128463	128428	128428	you	209	" she goes on rapidly , perceiving that her sister does not make any rejoinder , but only looks at her searchingly . "
128492	128493	128485	128485	him	209	" "
128504	128509	128485	128485	him	209	" says Sarah dispassionately . "
128526	128527	128529	128529	you	209	" "
128531	128532	128529	128529	you	209	" "
128536	128546	128529	128529	you	209	" repeats Miss Churchill , in almost awed reflection . "
128589	128590	128562	128562	her	1853	" "
128613	128637	128651	128651	you	209	" replies Belinda ; but she says it in a tone of such unassumed equanimity , that again Sarah regards her with astonishment . "
128641	128649	128651	128651	you	209	" she repeats , a third time . "
128666	128667	128651	128651	you	209	" "
128675	128695	128651	128651	you	209	" But there is not a touch of desperation , or even of milder sadness , in her voice . "
128705	128706	128698	128698	you	209	" "
128716	128794	128709	128709	people	523	" She has knelt on the springy turf , and is cutting , one after one , a score of young and dewy pinks , to comfort her sister during her dusty up - journey ; carefully , and with the grudging hand of a real flower - lover , choosing those that are budless : no easy feat , for there is scarcely one that has not a grey - green successor beneath its perfumed wing . "
128803	128804	128709	128709	people	523	" "
128817	128895	128806	128806	you	209	" asks Sarah abruptly , and yet slowly . For a moment the garden - scissors in Mrs. Forth 's hand cease their clipping , and remain suspended and open , like that other pair which snipped her namesake 's love - lock , while a dye as opulent as that of the new peony , whose birth the garden - border this morning greeted , stains even the milk - coloured nape of her stooped neck . "
128907	128912	128898	128898	I	0	" she says coldly ; "
128922	128923	128924	128924	Belinda	134	" "
128926	128959	128924	128924	Belinda	134	" says the other , dropping down on the sward beside her , and griping her shaking hand — scissors , pinks , and all — in her own little eager clasp , "
129019	129026	129014	129014	Punch	186	University"—with a not very assured laugh . "
129031	129164	129014	129014	Punch	186	" But the hands so urgently pressed give no answering pressure . Upon the half - averted face comes no glow of sisterly pleasure or acceptance . A senseless suspicion has flashed across Mrs. Forth 's mind , that the present proposition on Sarah 's part may be an impormptu fait à loisir ; that it may have been arranged between her and Rivers ; that here may lie the secret of his eagerness to repeat his visit ; that — in fact whatever angry gibberish jealousy may whisper to a mind ripe and ready for its reception . Under pretext of resuming her pinkcutting , she has withdrawn her unwillingly - captured hand ; but she is no longer careful : the unblown buds fall as freely as the opened flowers . "
129172	129180	129184	129184	granny	1860	" she says in a dry voice ; "
129187	129188	129184	129184	granny	1860	" "
129201	129225	129198	129198	she	1860	" replies Sarah , smothering bravely a disappointment none the less sharp for being mastered at her sister 's reception of her proposal . "
129274	129275	129266	129266	granny	156	" "
129285	129299	129266	129266	granny	156	" interrupts Belinda hastily , not allowing her sister to finish her sentence . "
129310	129315	129306	129306	I	0	" says Sarah persistently ; "
129331	129358	129326	129326	I	0	" Belinda has risen from her knees , and has turned to a damask rose - bush , to lay it under contribution for her nosegay . "
129365	129373	129374	129374	you	1861	" she says , cutting feverishly away ; "
129412	129521	129522	129522	Belinda	134	" There is such a strain of impatience through her speech , that Sarah reluctantly desists , nor are many more words exchanged between them . The cab is at the door . The luggage — cursed of cabmen — has been hoisted on the top . Punch is , at Mrs. Forth 's petition — a petition certainly not backed up by Slutty — to be left on a visit to her . The moment of parting has come . Sarah apparently wishes that that parting shall take place without witnesses . She draws her sister back into the drawing - room , and shuts the door . "
129524	129566	129567	129567	Belinda	134	" she says , when she has somewhat coldly kissed her , looking in her face with a gravity that only once or twice before in the course of their lives has Mrs. Forth seen written on those small gay lineaments . "
129628	129756	129764	129765	David Rivers	143	" Then , without another word , she is gone . Without one last look from the cab window , without a farewell friendly handwave ; forgetting even to bid good - bye to the dogs , or take their messages to Jane , she is gone . For some minutes Belinda remains standing on the exact spot at which her sister had left her ; remains standing , still and stunned . Then she suddenly throws herself into the Professor 's armchair , and spreads her hands over her face . She would like not to let a quarter of an inch of it remain uncovered . The light is strong and brutal . She would like to draw the blinds down and shut the shutters . "
129769	130253	129764	129765	David Rivers	143	" The blood is singing loudly in her ears . It seems to take the form of these words . Over and over again . The moment the sentence is ended , it begins afresh . How long she lies there — outwardly a log , inwardly a shameful fire — she neither knows nor cares . But after a while a tide of indignation sets in through all her being , chasing before it the shame , and she sits up . What disgraceful words for her own sister to apply to her ! and what slightest ground , excuse , palliation even , had she for so insulting her ? Going to the devil ! And pray , what is it to go to the devil ? Is it to fulfil with nice scrupulosity every tasteless or even nauseous duty of a most dreary life ? To sing as she walks her treadmill ? To smile patiently over her oakumpicking ? To forego her own hot bright youth , and clip down its rich proportions to the meagre pattern of the dry and crabbed age with which it is mismated ? To be a secretary without pay , a drudge without wage , a souffre douleur without hope of enlargement , a prisoner the term of whose incarceration lies in the hands of arbitrary death ? If this be to go to the devil , then she is not only going there , but has long ago gone . She laughs sarcastically , and her feverish limbs carry her up and down the room . If Sarah had given her time , this is how she would have answered her — thus and thus . For a while she walks to and fro , muttering under her breath , framing withering sentences of self - exculpation , that must carry conviction to any mind . But that mood , too , passes . As her wrath — spent and exhausted — subsides , another voice , lower yet more penetrating , takes its place . Going to the devil ! Is going to the devil to have a husband whose pursuits you abhor , whose infirmities you secretly deride , at whose accidental touch you shiver ? Is going to the devil to be speeding with disloyal alacrity that husband 's departure , to be counting the hours to the end of your only sister 's visit , to be living and feeding and flourishing upon a hope that you dare not look in the face , that you would sooner die than impart to any soul that breathes ? Is this to be going to the devil ? She has again wholly hidden her face with her hands . Again the light seems over - strong and pushing . And plain and distinct , beyond possibility of misapprehension , the answer comes—"Yes
130259	130296	129764	129765	David Rivers	143	" A couple of hours later the Professor lifts a head , a good deal reddened and exasperated by long burrowing in the bowels of a portmanteau , to see his pale wife enter his room . "
130307	130319	130297	130297	I	0	" she says gently , though in a spiritless flat voice . "
130332	130337	130325	130325	you	0	" replies he ungraciously . "
130358	130359	130360	130360	I	0	" "
130368	130383	130360	130360	I	0	" she answers apologetically , and without any trace of resentment at his tone . "
130395	130437	130384	130384	She	135	" replies he drily , glancing at the clock . She offers no further justification , but kneeling down on the floor , lets her hands , which tremble perceptibly , stray rather purposelessly over the books strewn upon the carpet . "
130446	130450	130451	130451	you	0	" he cries sharply "
130459	130460	130451	130451	you	0	" "
130470	130486	130487	130487	I	0	" she says , lifting a heavy folio , and looking humbly up at him . "
130516	130530	130531	130531	I	0	" he replies , peering down through his spectacles at his strewn treasures . "
130547	130562	130539	130539	I	0	" How very white her face is ! Has she had some sudden scare ? "
130571	130580	130566	130566	you	0	" she asks in a very low voice . "
130590	130619	130586	130586	you	0	" He shifts the focus of his vision from Irenaeus to her face ; but apparently the latter object gives him less tranquil pleasure than did the former . "
130631	130650	130620	130620	You	0	" he answers chillingly . She hangs her head , a guilty conscious ness staining her pallor red . "
130665	130698	130659	130659	you	0	" There is a deliberate pause before he answers , and her heart goes down , down . He is about to accept her offer ! But his first words reassure her . "
130715	130734	130735	130735	I	0	" he replies , in a key that plainly shows his annoyance at the suggestion having been made . "
130757	130793	130794	130794	You	0	" She draws a long breath of relief ; but now that the danger of acceptance seems less imminent , her scruples return . Sarah 's stinging phrase begins to ring again in her ears . "
130806	130821	130822	130822	You	0	" she says , nervously fidgeting with the already packed portion of the portmanteau . "
130828	130834	130835	130835	She	614	" She shrugs her shoulders . "
130844	130859	130835	130835	She	614	" At her capricious and untimely opposition , his forehead gathers into vexed wrinkles . "
130888	130895	130896	130896	She	3060	" Again the guilty head stoops . "
130905	130906	130898	130898	she	3060	" "
130913	130921	130898	130898	she	3060	" replies he with a disagreeable smile ; "
130932	130985	130923	130923	you	0	" Another pause . She is aimlessly wrapping paper round one of the volumes that are not wanted , that are not to be taken eruditely tripping to the Alps . She will make one more effort . If that fail , no one , not even Sarah , can blame her . "
131003	131011	131012	131012	I	0	" she asks , timorously eyeing him . "
131035	131040	131023	131023	you	0	" he answers irritably . "
131047	131052	131023	131023	you	0	" she cries feverishly . "
131078	131079	131080	131080	You	0	" "
131084	131089	131080	131080	You	0	" returns he sharply . "
131115	131116	131117	131117	They	1875	" "
131124	131129	131117	131117	They	1875	" she says excitedly . "
131136	131163	131132	131132	they	1875	" He shrugs his shoulders silently , as who should say that upon one lost in such mazes of inconsequence and irrationality breath would be wasted . "
131172	131190	131165	131165	you	0	" she says , in a hard low voice , rising from her knees and approaching him . "
131202	131207	131209	131209	you	0	" replies he peevishly ; "
131222	131223	131209	131209	you	0	" "
131236	131247	131227	131227	you	0	" retorts she , her temper rising under his tone . "
131263	131268	131270	131270	you	0	" he says satirically . "
131272	131291	131270	131270	you	0	" she answers with a scorching blush , that seems to burn inside as well as outside her . "
131318	131345	131346	131346	I	0	" He has taken off his spectacles in order to rub their glasses . He now deliberately replaces them , and regards her attentively through them . "
131349	131354	131346	131346	I	0	" he says deliberately , "
131377	131378	131379	131379	I	0	" "
131387	131392	131379	131379	I	0	" she says bitterly . "
131407	131408	131435	131435	I	0	" "
131419	131430	131435	131435	I	0	" returns he , in a measured voice of displeasure . "
131481	131513	131514	131514	You	0	" For all answer , she turns abruptly away . The infinitely difficult confession which she was half - heartedly struggling to make to him , frozen back by his gibe . "
131524	131532	131514	131514	You	0	" she says , adopting his tone . "
131546	131600	131601	131601	I	0	" As a reply , the Professor turns thoughtfully back to his folios , weighing the dispensability or indispensability as a travelling companion of each , with an air of having dismissed the subject , and of resolutely waiving further consideration of so senseless a matter . His wife stands dubiously watching him . "
131613	131624	131601	131601	I	0	" she says at last , in a disturbed voice . "
131647	131663	131671	131671	you	0	" ( he does not perceive the slight hesitation which prefaces the last two words ) "
131673	131712	131671	131671	you	0	" To so point - blank an appeal he must provide an answer of some kind ; though nothing can be clearer than that he would rather have relegated the affair to the limbo of a contemptuous silence . "
131720	131728	131713	131713	I	0	" he says , with slow annoyance . "
131772	131839	131765	131765	you	0	" ( She has good reasons enough , God wot ! but looking at the unlovely and unloving rigour of his face , she feels that to die , to be flayed alive — whatever things in short have been reckoned hardest of endurance since the world was — are but as child 's play compared to what the telling them to him would be . ) "
131844	131867	131765	131765	you	0	" he continues , with an air of judicial coldness , and not thinking it worth while to finish his former sentence , "
131877	131878	131765	131765	you	0	" "
131884	131893	131765	131765	you	0	" she stammers urgently , in puissant excitement . "
131909	132004	132005	132005	You	1884	" rejoins he coolly , and so turns again on his heel . Behind his back she makes a gesture as of one that throws up a game . Is not he in the right ? Has not he a show of reason and justice on his side ? Why not acquiesce without further kicking against the pricks ? But yet something drives her to a last attempt . Although thrice baffled , although at each new discomfiture her heart has sprung up in joyful relief , she will press her suit once more . "
132016	132054	132008	132008	women	2468	" she says with a laugh that has borrowed something from its opposite — a sob , and in a gentler voice than that which she is wo nt to think soft enough for converse with him ; "
132076	132089	132068	132068	you	1884	" Envenomed by her pertinacity , he wheels round upon her viciously . "
132101	132105	132091	132091	you	1884	" he says , "
132131	132132	132133	132133	I	0	" "
132142	132171	132133	132133	I	0	" she says humbly , and going so far — for her it is immensely far — as to lay her fair hand on his coat - sleeve . "
132214	132221	132223	132223	I	0	" with a sad little laugh , "
132240	132276	132235	132235	I	0	" She has made her plea , and with eyes that feel dry , and breath that comes short , awaits its prosperity or miscarriage . For a while he eyes her with silent suspicion . "
132285	132293	132235	132235	I	0	" he says at last , shortly . "
132308	132340	132341	132341	I	0	" she answers , her pleading growing , perhaps , the more earnest from her consciousness of the intensity of the wish for its ill - success that goes with it . "
132353	132354	132347	132347	I	0	" "
132357	132365	132367	132367	you	1884	" retorts he , with angry ridicule ; "
132386	132387	132388	132388	I	0	" "
132416	132421	132408	132408	I	0	" she urges tremulously . "
132428	132433	132438	132438	you	0	" he answers tartly ; "
132446	132447	132438	132438	you	0	" "
132453	132483	132438	132438	you	0	" she says firmly — for is not this her last appeal , and is not she bound to make it no pretence , but a real and thoroughly earnest one?—"what
132495	132499	132501	132502	no one	365	and"—lowering her voice a little—"you
132508	132567	132568	132568	I	0	" Perhaps the plea is an injudiciously chosen one . No man likes to be reminded that he will stand or fall alone ; that he is without a stake in the generations to come . At all events , on hearing it , his features assume a look even more acrid than that which they wore before . "
132579	132592	132593	132593	I	0	" he says with a decision against which there is no appeal . "
132628	132629	132631	132631	you	1884	" "
132634	132657	132631	132631	you	1884	" she answers , bowing acquiescently a head whose cheeks have suddenly resumed their carnations , and its eyes their young dance ; "
132695	132950	132674	132674	I	0	" The Professor has been gone a parson 's week . For the same period of time Mrs. Forth has been testing the genuineness of her appetite for solitude ; nor finding it fail beneath the experiment . Perhaps it is the extreme clearness of her conscience that upholds her ; for do not we all know , either by its possession or its lack , that there is no cheerfuller companion than a clear conscience ? nothing that gives such a zest to appetite , or such a point to occupation ? And can anyone be in fuller possession of this innocent luxury than Belinda ? Has not she craved with meek persistency leave to share her husband 's travels ? and , reluctantly compelled to abandon this hope , has not she provided , with wifely care , for every possible need that may assail him on that sanitary excursion , for whose loneliness none can blame her ? Did she forget his Etna ? or his eider down ? or his air - cushion ? Did she , as many a spouse though otherwise meritorious might easily have done , omit his tin of digestive biscuits ? Was there lacking from his kit at his departure one of his heart drops , liver pills , spleen boluses ? What but the consciousness of a duty performed both generously and minutely could enable her to wave her hand at the fly - window with so collected a friendliness ; smile such a serene "
132953	132992	132674	132674	I	0	" to the jewel of which that fly is the casket ? To assume an inconsolable grief would be absurd , and would take him in even less than herself ; but there is no hypocrisy in crying , "
132999	133022	132674	132674	I	0	" As she returns up the gravelled drive , she stoops to pick up a small stone . How brightly it shines ! "
133031	133032	132674	132674	I	0	" "
133035	133043	132674	132674	I	0	" ( throwing it down again ) , "
133069	133111	132674	132674	I	0	" But the same rich metamorphosis seems to have taken place in the case of every object upon which her eye alights . Did ever bountiful rose - tree show such a wealth of come flowers and coming buds , as the "
133114	133487	132674	132674	I	0	" against the study wall ? Was ever little Philistine drawing - room so rich in gold motes lustily astride on the sunbeams ? Even the very dogs , the well - known dogs , seem to wear an air of better breeding ; manners of higher finish ; tails of more watchspring curl than on any previous morning . Even the parrot 's profanities — in point of fact , very common - places of blasphemy , uttered with an Oxbridge accent — have won a raciness never before theirs . She wanders from room to room , as it were taking possession . Are not they all her own , her very own now ? Even without the explanation to that effect , which in pure wantonness of spirits she has vouchsafed separately to Punch and Slutty , they seem perfectly to understand that they are now at libetty to rumple the chair - covers , clatter down the fire - irons , oppress the cats as freely as their soul listeth ; that there are no longer any nerves in the house , any dyspepsia , any learning . Nor does the passage of the hours and days bring with it any sensible alteration in this mood , of either hers or theirs . Daily she sees the piled vehicles rolling past to the station ; carrying her fellow - townsmen away to their holiday ; stampedes of whole large small families to the seaside ( the new Oxbridge swarms and perambulates and crawls with little children , all apparently of the same age to a day ) ; hardy young couples winging bold flights to the North Cape , or more modest Dolomites . She wishes them all a happy time and safe return ; but not a twinge of envy goes with one of them . Home is good enough for her ; England far enough ; Oxbridge fair enough . Even Sarah 's parting words , at first so rankling with poisonous sting , grow gradually powerless to hurt . She begins to think of them at first with indignation , next with indifference , and at last even with a lofty kind of compassionate forgiveness . "
133497	133507	133517	133517	they	1893	" she says to herself , without conscious sophistry , "
133520	134709	133517	133517	they	1893	" She lets her mind run with complacency round the circle of her accurately fulfilled duties . Is there one in a thousand who , considering the nature of those duties , would fulfil them as accurately ? Has not she , in addition to the tasks imposed upon her , for fulfilment during his absence by her husband , voluntarily undertaken to make a new catalogue of his library , as a wifely surprise for him upon his return ? Does she scamp , by one moment , the time of her visits to his mother ? Has not she rather enlarged them by nearly a daily hour ? Is not the nurse ready to lick her feet , for her consideration and unselfish sharing of that nurse 's burden ? Does her patience ever for an instant fail under the old lady 's senseless catechisms ? Can anything surpass the painstaking discretion with which she conducts the Professor 's correspondence , left behind him , in her charge ? or the respectful punctuality and amplitude of her own letters to him ? Nor is her self - satisfaction less , when she consider her pleasures . Might not every member of the University , every inhabitant of the world , if he saw fit , have leave to pry into each moment of her leisure , as of her occupations ? The happy gardenings — weeding the border , with the dogs yawning their hearts out beside her , in affectionate endurance of a pastime they are so far from participating . Dogs hate gardening ; they see no sense in it . Of what use , pray , to dig a hole , when you have no bone to bury in it ? The long country walks to the elm - shaded rural villages , and through the late June fields , where man has sown his corn and God has thrown in His poppies ; the return home , poppy - laden , to make the house one scarlet bower , though it is embellished for only her own eye . Never has that eye seemed so open to see . Never has her ear seemed to be laid so close to the heart of the mighty mother , to hear its beatings . Never till this year had she learned all the music that lies even in the trumpeting gnat and the booming evening chafers . Never had she grown into such familiar friendship with the woodland birds . All her life , of course , she has known that the thrush 's song is sweet , and the lark 's exulting ; but not till now — so unobservant are we — has she learned surely the songs of the lesser minne - singers , the minor stars of the great concert . But this summer , by right perhaps of her harmlessness and her solitude , she has stolen into their intimacy . She recognises them lovingly , not only when they sing , but when they converse among themselves . She knows the tomtit 's table - talk — like the grating of a tiny saw ; the cock chaffinch 's — all : she grows discriminatingly cunning in all their little speech . The dogs enjoy themselves too in their way , though they think that the flowers smell ill ; and that the birds ' noise is ugly and foolish , not to be named in the same breath with the poignant love - songs of the nightly cats . Slutty , indeed , has suffered one of those disappointments , from which not dogs any more than men are exempt . For four - and - twenty hours Punch has been lost ; and from the more than resignation , evidenced by her during his absence , and the acute depression coincident with his restoration , it is but too clear that she had hoped his disappearance was a permanent one . June nears her perfumed close . The second Sunday of Mrs. Forth 's loneliness has come round . The first was marked by no special incident . Belinda had not expected that it would be . But , indeed , not even to herself does she allow that she anticipates anything for any Sunday . But yet , on this second Sunday she rises with such a feeling of irrepressible blithe excitement , that she must needs casuistically explain it to herself . The air is so good . The smell of the hay comes now into the middle of the town ; into street and market - place ; how much more hither , where she is in the enjoyment of a sort of suburban pseudo - country . She has ever been fond of Sunday . It is always a favourite day with her ; much more so in this Sunday city of innumerable church bells . She dresses with a resolute abstaining from adding a single adornment , or making any change , however slight , in her usual Sunday toilet . To do so would be to allow that she had some reason for the alteration . Perhaps , with this motive mingles an unconfessed superstition that to presuppose a pleasure by preparation for it , is the surest way to rob yourself of its fruition . She reads the Lessons for the day to her mother - in - law , with as reverent a distinctness as if the poor old lady could follow them , or were even aware of the nature of the attention . It is a proceeding of whose judiciousness she herself has no great opinion ; but it is one of the tasks imposed upon her by her husband , and which she would by no means intermit . When they are ended , having told her the news of her husband 's death , which she receives with her usual pleased surprise , Belinda goes lightly away to put on her bonnet for church . As she walks along , her memory grows suddenly occupied with the recollection of that other solitary walk to church at Folkestone ; of the griding cold ; the ice - bound earth ; the misery of her yet more ice - bound heart ; of the wretched prisoned starling to which she had likened herself . Not greater is earth 's change than that which is wrought within herself . But for her change , what reason is there ? Has the starling then escaped ? The question flashes upon her with an uneasy start , but is instantly silenced again . The service is one of those brief and modernized ones , that make us marvel at the patience of our earlier days ; yet to Belinda it seems long . Whether sweetly singing , devoutly kneeling , or attentively listening , she has no peace from the buzzing thought — never allowed , never looked in the face — but always returning , gnat - like : "
134726	134867	134868	134868	You	1894	" It does not leave her at the church door , but buzzes and teases all along the sunshiny road . It will buzz and tease until it gets its answer . Well , let it ! For is not that answer now given ? At the turn of the road , close at home , free from the stream of churchgoers , which has flowed in other directions , with no more witness than a milkman swinging unconcernedly along beneath his yoke , there it will be — there it is ! Has not every moment since their parting been but a leading up to and preparation for this moment ? And yet , at the sight of him she starts , as if it were a surprise , which indeed she still feigns to herself that it is . "
134871	134899	134868	134868	You	1894	" she says in a voice of airy astonishment , that would be admirably natural did it not quiver , and were it not a little overdone . "
134907	135009	134901	134901	you	1894	" His answer is not over - ready . He has not yet got over the stupefaction that the first sight of her after an interval always brings upon him — a stupefaction such as , they say , the sight of the sea , of Niagara , of any overwhelmingly great and noble natural object , produces in him who looks upon it for the first time . How much more beautiful she is than he had remembered her ! how pious she looks ! how chaste ! Probably other women before now have carried large Prayer - books , and "
135016	135057	134901	134901	you	1894	" in their left hand , home from church ; but it seems to him to be a wondrous feat of grace and holiness , performed for the first and only time in the world 's history . At last : "
135062	135071	135059	135059	you	1895	" he asks , still feeling rather dizzy ; "
135076	135077	135073	135073	you	1895	" "
135091	135096	135082	135082	you	1895	" she interrupts precipitately . "
135100	135115	135098	135098	I	0	" he answers , with an indifference that he makes no attempt to conceal ; "
135121	135136	135098	135098	I	0	" Is it her large Prayer - book that is making her so unapproachable ? "
135143	135184	135138	135138	you	1895	" she asks quickly , not allowing a moment of silence to intervene , with the uneasy idea , probably , of keeping the conversation in the polite and distant society key in which she has elected to pitch it . "
135187	135188	135138	135138	you	1895	" "
135198	135208	135191	135191	you	1895	" walking fast , and looking straight before her . "
135217	135218	135191	135191	you	1895	" "
135242	135243	135244	135244	I	0	" "
135249	135448	135244	135244	I	0	" There is a tinge of reproach in the manner in which he pronounces the last words . What has happened to her ? Is it to hear these cold platitudes that he has been rushing towards her all through the night , chiding the iron wheels for being slow — that he has spent his holiday , and foregone his rest ? Sleep ! With this to - day — this now ahead of him ! Is it likely that he should sleep ? They have reached her gate , and there paused . She does not ask him to accompany her in , nor does she make him any hospitable offer whatever . But that he has neither expected nor wished — would have declined on the unlikely hypothesis of her offering it . He has no desire to taste of Professor Forth 's salt . There is something that tells him that her pause before dismissing him will be only a momentary one ; and that if he does not utilize this very present instant , she will be gone , and he may return to Milnthorpe , whence he came , at his leisure . "
135460	135481	135449	135449	You	1898	" she says , her hand upon the latch , and with what he knows to be a valedictory smile . "
135490	135495	135497	135497	you	1900	" he asks precipitately ; "
135501	135502	135497	135497	you	1900	" "
135506	135512	135515	135515	you	1898	" she repeats , demurring ; "
135518	135519	135515	135515	you	1898	" "
135527	135603	135521	135521	you	1898	" very hurriedly , and doubling up his hands in his pockets to hinder their yielding to their almost ungovernable impulse to stretch themselves out , and — with her will , or against her will — there detain her . She casts a furtive glance towards the house — a glance that makes in him the fear of her flight , and the impulse to check it , yet more nearly beyond his governance . "
135608	135613	135515	135515	you	1898	" she says slowly ; "
135617	135618	135515	135515	you	1898	" "
135632	135691	135626	135626	you	1898	" He has his eye upon her . Would it be quite inadmissible , if she shows symptoms of leaving him unanswered , to lay one hand quite quietly , so that she should be scarcely conscious of it , upon her arm ? There is a full minute — sixty seconds well rung — before she answers . "
135709	135710	135626	135626	you	1898	" "
135724	135762	135716	135716	you	1898	" Again she looks towards the house , behind whose closed doors the dogs are plainly heard , telling her that they know she has come back from church , and asking her why she is dawdling . "
135767	135775	135716	135716	you	1898	" she says , lifting the latch . "
135779	135790	135716	135716	you	1898	" her words coming with a sort of shamefaced hurry , "
135806	135815	135816	135816	I	0	" with a sudden remorse at this concession , "
135838	135859	135829	135829	one	373	" She has opened the gate , and is passing through it . He has only half a minute left . "
135871	135878	135879	135879	I	0	" he cries desperately after her . "
135895	135913	135890	135890	I	0	" She has taken out her latch - key , and is putting it into the lock . "
135925	135994	135917	135917	you	0	" he says , with a tremor of passionate disappointment in his voice ; and so , taking off his hat , turns on his heel . But as he walks slowly down the road , telling his own heart that he has befooled himself — never would he allow that his high lady could befool him — a sort of whisper seems to travel to his ears , "
136003	136795	135998	135999	St. Bridget	318	" Belinda lunches , as usual , alone . The one prime and perhaps sole advantage of solitary feeding is , that you need not eat more than you feel inclined ; that if from any cause your appetite has left you , there is no one to make comments on that fact . If , in addition , you have two pet gluttons on their hind - legs supporting you throughout your repast on either side , and drawing five sharp nails along the back of your hand if you do not seem to be attending to them , not even to the servant need your condition of un - hunger be ever revealed . Punch and Slutty have never yet understood why , on that June Sunday , they were feasted so royally on ribs of roast beef . From the luncheon - table Belinda passes , according to the usual routine of her duties , to her mother - in - law 's room , for her daily two hours . As it turns out , they are more than two ; for the nurse , relying upon her employer 's usual good - natured laxity , outstays her furlough by fully twenty minutes , and returns to find young Mrs. Forth , for the first time , unsmiling and impatient of the delay . And yet , when released , she seems undecided as to the disposition of her time . The dogs are staring at her — one sitting , one standing — as if they knew that their fate was hanging in the balance . Can anyone resist such a litany of goggles as their eyes are uttering ? It would be a crying shame to disappoint them . She will forego the trim leisure of the College gardens and take them to the Fields — a public promenade where dogs are admitted , and where perambulators push and Sunday shop - boys jostle . But she does not call them or tell them so . After all , it is a pity to spoil them , and to let them take it for granted that they are to accompany her wherever she goes . On the whole , it is wiser not to hamper herself with them . She will make no fixed plan as to the direction of her walk ; but will simply follow where whim or chance may lead . And whim and chance , after a little preliminary shamming , gone through to impose upon herself , lead her to St. Bridget 's Gardens . An interlacing of elm - arms overhead ; a thick bed of periwinkle below ; on the left a little classic river , and an unexpected park with smoky deer ; on the right the sacred College meadow , where never vulgar foot may fall , save of the haymakers , who have but lately built the grass and flowers into a scented stack . Above , below , around , tranquillity and solitude . For , loveliest of the College walks as is St. Bridget 's , it is , strange to say , also the least frequented . Thither the accursed perambulator can not come ; and thither the holiday clerk and milliner come not . It is all , or nearly all , her own . Each Sunday , as the town empties , it will grow more and more her own . Over the patterned walk , where tree and sun have laid their chequers as a carpet for her feet , she marches leisurely . She has not hurried upon any other Sunday ; therefore she will not hurry to - day . No one can or shall be able to say that she has departed one jot from her accustomed habits . She is making for her usual seat — the one that ordinarily no one disputes with her . But to - day , as it comes into view , she perceives that it is already occupied . The occupant must be a friend too , since , on catching sight of her , he comes hasting — young and most glad — to meet her . Ah — h ! it is not a question of the Grosse Garten over again . To - day she is not first . Not that there is any parallel between the cases . Not that anyone can call this a rendezvous . He does not think it necessary to offer any apology for , or explanation of , his appearance , and passes over , with a silent lenity , her little futile and ill - done expression of surprise . "
136802	136803	135998	135999	St. Bridget	318	" "
136809	136831	135998	135999	St. Bridget	318	" he says , pointing to the bench whence he has just risen . For an instant she hesitates , then — "
136839	136844	136834	136834	I	0	" she says irresolutely . "
136860	136948	136854	136854	I	0	" Is there in this any slightest departure from use or custom ? He seats himself beside , yet not near her ; for he sees her frightened eye jealously measuring the interval between them ; to be sure that it is wide enough . How still it is ! Neither human voice nor metal heard from the city . Everyone must be in church . Is this really happening ? Perhaps if he speak , if he make her speak , it will grow more real . "

136996	137048	137049	137049	I	0	" asks Mrs. Forth quickly , while a storm of colour sweeps across her face . He has no slightest clue to the origin of that red tempest ; he only knows that it has trebled her beauty . Did God ever before create such a wonder of loveliness as she ? "
137056	137072	137073	137073	I	0	" he answers inattentively , a sin towards her of which he is seldom guilty ; "
137084	137127	137075	137075	I	0	" Wide of the mark , as we usually are in our judgments of those who have either too much or too little interest for us , she attributes his verbal unreadiness to a cause far removed enough from the real one . "
137135	137153	137128	137128	Sarah	135	" she says in an ungenial voice , sitting very upright , and looking rigidly before her ; "
137187	137249	137170	137170	I	0	" There is an acrimony in her tone that he knows not how to account for ; but he does not interrupt her . As long as she will speak , he is ever most gladly silent . Why should the air be disturbed by his coarse and common voice , when it may be enriched by the music of hers ? "
137265	137273	137274	137274	I	0	" continues she , with some sharpness ; "
137291	137292	137286	137286	him	209	" "
137297	137347	137294	137294	he	209	" with an accent of the profoundest incredulity . To be asked by this woman for leave to bestow her company upon you , and to refuse her ! And how did she ask ? With her arms about his neck ? With tears and kisses ? He writhes . "
137353	137358	137359	137359	he	209	" she answers formally ; "
137371	137409	137359	137359	he	209	" The young man 's heart burns within him , with a fire of envious indignation too hot to find vent in words . And yet perhaps a little of it may pierce through his next speech . "
137442	137468	137469	137469	I	0	" There is something in his tone — an irony that has the heat of wrath — that rouses again her half - smouldering alarms . "
137473	137478	137469	137469	I	0	" she answers quickly , "
137504	137505	137508	137508	you	0	" "
137511	137534	137508	137508	you	0	" objects he , bewildered by the staring discrepancy of the statements which have followed so close upon each other 's heels . "
137543	137554	137540	137540	I	0	" interrupts she , with a brusque , nervous laugh . "
137566	137802	137540	137540	I	0	" An elderly couple — two of St. Bridget 's rare votaries — have appeared upon the long straight alley dominated by Belinda 's bench ; an alley named after the short - faced humourist who loved to pace it . Mrs. Froth is glad . She wishes that more couples would come into sight . It is far more sociable . As they pass , she involuntarily raises her voice in speaking . She is saying nothing that she minds either them or anyone else hearing . What a comfort it is to have nothing to conceal from the whole world ! As the hours slip by , this happy and confident complacency deepens . But how fast they slip away ! She can not affect to be ignorant of their passage , since from the Cardinal 's high tower , rising above the trees , the deep - mouthed bells tell the death of each little quarter . How closely they tread upon each other 's heels ! How many of them have broken the Sabbath stillness of the mead ? She ventures not to ask nor think . But why does she not venture ? It is the same as upon other Sundays , for she always stays late . It is with a start that at length — seven solemn strokes having beaten the air — she rises to be gone . "
137808	137813	137814	137814	We	1915	" she says hurriedly . "
137825	137886	137814	137814	We	1915	" Shut in , in this green enclosure , with the stars for night - lamps , and this woman for fellow - prisoner ! How dare she make such a suggestion ! It is several minutes before he can fight down the frantic tumult in his heart that her words have raised , enough to say with sufficient composure : "
137904	137905	137907	137907	you	1916	" "
137911	137928	137929	137929	You	0	" she cries vehemently , stopping — they are walking slowly homewards — and facing him . "
137933	137956	137957	137957	I	0	" he says in a low voice . He can not rid himself of that vision of the star - canopied meadow . "
137961	137966	137959	137959	you	1916	" she answers excitedly ; "
137976	137980	137985	137987	your own master	1917	" recollecting herself , "
138009	138013	138005	138005	I	0	" laughing agitatedly , "
138051	138055	138056	138056	I	0	" smiling feverishly . "

138076	138183	138056	138056	I	0	" Her answer is long a coming ; for indeed it is preceded by an eager dialogue within herself , that takes time . If she prohibit it , so docile is he to her least word or sign , that she knows he will acquiesce ; and she will sit upon her bench and hear the quarters chime , and see the tall tower rise , alone . Even when her reply does come , it is a mere evasion . There is no need to give a direct answer . It is one of those questions which it is better taste to leave unanswered . "
138189	138197	138198	138198	We	1918	" she says with a flighty laugh . "
138220	138221	138212	138212	me	0	" "
138283	138567	139070	139071	a hunter	1919	" Can it be possible that August is here ? Not even early August — July 's hot equivalent — but late August , that has shaken hands with September . The mornings have a taste of autumn , though high summer still rules the noons ; and as Belinda paces along her garden walk , the damp dews wet her gown , and the swinging gossamers tickle her nose . Oxbridge is at its emptiest . In a week or so people will be beginning to return ; but for the present it is a desert . It is a pity that they should not return to see with what a kingly red pomp the Virginian creeper is decking the sad - coloured beauty of their town . Over their worn - grey shoulders the Colleges are throwing a cope of shaded crimson ; and from underneath a necklace of rubies , the Renaissance porch of the great University church looks out . And alone , among the waxing autumnal splendour , Mrs. Forth pursues her way . Still she walks to the rural villages ; still she gardens ; still she makes out her catalogue , and reads aloud her collects ; and still on Sunday she sits upon her bench in St. Bridget 's walk , every alternate Sunday alone , every alternate Sunday not alone . Although no further permission than that recorded has been either asked or given , she has grown to take it as an accepted fact , that , on every second Sunday , she shall find him there as surely as she finds the green elm trees and the Cardinal 's Tower . Doubtless the "
138572	139019	139070	139071	a hunter	1919	" as Horace Walpole called them , the repose and country fresh air , are an almost necessary tonic to him after the din and labour of his week . If he think them worth the money spent in railway travelling upon them , surely that is his affair , and one in which , without officious ill - taste , she can not further meddle . There is no slightest mystery about their meetings . Anyone may know of them . Nor does she ever fail , in her letters to the Professor , to record among miscellaneous items of news that she has met Mr. Rivers . Why then should she abstain from a pleasure so innocent ? We are creatures of habit ; and she could not well do without her Sundays now . At the mere suggestion of such an abstinence she shivers coldly . She has pitched their intercourse in a key with which no one can quarrel ; has set their intimacy upon a footing from which it need never swerve . If it were anyone 's place to object , it would surely be her husband 's ; but so far is he from so doing , that he has not thought her communication worth even a comment . He has devoted a couple of closely - written pages to directions where she is to find a volume of Origen ; but apparently he could not spare speech or time for a mention of Rivers . If anything could have lulled her into a greater security than that which she already enjoys , it would be this fact . Serene and blooming , with a silent conscience , she walks entranced through the dreamful days . By a sort of subtlety , such as Till Eulenspiegel 's , she has grown to look forward to the Sundays on which he does not come , because they lead up to those on which he does . To - day is one of these latter Sundays , and she is sitting down to her solitary luncheon , too happy to eat , when a ring at the front - door makes her start . Can it be Rivers ? Unlikely that he , who has long tacitly abstained from even meeting her on her way home from church should present himself at a door which he has always shown such a silent energy of repulsion against entering . Can it be her husband , unexpectedly restored to her ? She turns suddenly very cold . Can it be — There is no use in repeating a question which is already answered . "
139024	139056	139070	139071	a hunter	1919	" cries Miss Watson , thrusting aside the baffled parlour - maid and seeming instantly to fill the whole room with her presence , and her plaid gown and her fringe . "
139073	139116	139070	139071	a hunter	1919	" Belinda has risen , leaving her untouched plate ; the consternation which the sight of Miss Watson does and must always inspire , in this case diluted and modified by relief . At all events , she is not the Professor . "
139129	139150	139151	139151	I	0	" cries the guest , with loud cheerfulness ; beginning to divest herself of bonnet , gloves , and pelerine . "
139247	139326	139237	139237	I	0	" Through Belinda 's head there darts immediately a calculation . It is now one o'clock . In four hours it will be five o'clock : an hour later , therefore , than that one which usually finds her pacing down St. Bridget 's walk . He will have to wait a full hour for her . At this thought a dismay , so disproportionate to the occasion as to frighten even herself , takes hold of her . "
139337	139346	139237	139237	I	0	" she asks , forcing herself to speak . "
139367	139368	139359	139359	you	0	" "
139371	139377	139383	139384	the housekeeper	1923	" replies Miss Watson carelessly ; "
139411	139424	139425	139425	I	0	" Belinda 's only answer is a faint shrug of acute dissent . "
139437	139443	139425	139425	I	0	" pursues Miss Watson warmly . "
139518	139552	139513	139513	Rivers	162	" If her life here , and her salvation elsewhere , depended upon her remaining motionless , Belinda could not help the start which she can only hope looks slighter than it feels . "
139556	139561	139513	139513	Rivers	162	" she repeats stammeringly . "
139575	139581	139564	139565	Mr. Rivers	162	" with her strident laugh . "
139609	139621	139603	139603	he	162	" Belinda draws a long gasping breath , then answers distinctly : "
139624	139669	139603	139603	he	162	" After all it is not a lie — not all a lie ! He has not been to see her ; and she has made a mental reservation as to her answer applying only to the second clause of her companion 's speech . "
139672	139681	139603	139603	he	162	" says Miss Watson , biting her nails ; "
139688	139726	139603	139603	he	162	" Since this last remark is not a question , and since she is by no means assured of having even a tolerable mastery over her voice , Mrs. Forth allows it to go by uncommented upon . "
139735	139755	139729	139729	he	162	" continues the other , still biting her nails , and in a tone of the most poignant inquisitiveness . "
139810	139837	139840	139840	you	162	" Her guest 's eyes are riveted upon Mrs. Forth with such an unwinking energy of stare , that she must needs form some halting answer . "
139842	139851	139856	139856	him	162	" she says , with a sickly smile ; "
139858	139859	139856	139856	him	162	" "
139870	139876	139863	139863	he	162	" replies the other stoutly ; "
139961	139981	139915	139915	you	1937	" She repeats the question with such a pertinacity of inquiry , that Belinda is obliged to murmur that , "
139987	140025	139915	139915	you	1937	" When the beef has gone to fulfil that destiny which Miss Watson had prophesied for it — she , at least , has done full justice to it — they move to the drawing - room . "
140038	140045	140033	140033	you	1941	" says Belinda , with formality . "
140061	140062	140054	140059	my mother - in - law	1837	" "
140070	140076	140054	140059	my mother - in - law	1837	" replies the other cordially ; "
140111	140120	140054	140059	my mother - in - law	1837	" turning over the objects on the table ; "
140136	140363	140364	140364	I	0	" Nor is there . At intervals during the two hours Belinda catches sight of her from the window , bustling round the garden , pinching the few plums on the garden wall , trying to look into the windows of the next houses ; hears her opening and shutting doors , pulling out drawers , etc . For a moment a pang of apprehension crosses Mrs. Forth 's mind . Can she ferret out anything ? any letter ? any paper ? But no ; a smile of pride and reassurance crosses Belinda 's face . What in all her poor archives is there that might not be exposed to the eyes of the whole world ? to the gimlet eyes of ( if imagination could grasp the idea of such a hideous multiplication ) a hundred Miss Watsons ? The two hours are gone . It is a quarter to four ; the time at which she usually begins to put on hat and gloves , and saunter , deliberately blissful , towards St. Bridget 's . It is clear that it is not the hour at which she will begin to saunter thither to - day . Nothing looks less like departure , more like a prolonged stay , than Miss Watson 's bonnetless attitude , plunged recumbent in the Professor 's chair . "
140372	140377	140364	140364	I	0	" she says cheerfully ; "
140401	140402	140394	140395	the Professor	2365	" "
140414	140422	140403	140403	He	2365	" replies the Professor 's wife icily , "
140436	140437	140438	140438	You	1947	" "
140449	140455	140438	140438	You	1947	" returns Miss Watson comfortably ; "
140501	140502	140438	140438	You	1947	" "
140510	140515	140516	140516	I	0	" says Belinda precipitately . "
140525	140533	140536	140536	he	143	" continues the other thought - fully ; "
140565	140627	140536	140536	he	143	" Belinda has not sat down ; in the forlorn hope , perhaps , that the maintenance of a standing attitude may give a less established tone to her guest 's presence . She now hastens to the window , and begins to fidget with the blind - cord , which pulls up and down perfectly , and needs no rearrangement . "
140641	140647	140536	140536	he	143	" continues the other reflectively . "
140678	140757	140758	140758	I	0	" Possibly Belinda makes some answer , and that it is drowned in the rattling of the blind , which she is feverishly jerking up and down . Every drop of blood in her body seems to have given its fellow rendezvous in her face . An intrigue ! Does he indeed come to Oxbridge for an intrigue ? An intrigue with whom ? An intrigue ! Is that what other people beside Miss Watson would call it ? "
140776	140782	140774	140774	her	222	" says Miss Watson resolutely ; "
140848	140956	140957	140957	I	0	" Judging by the frequency with which during the next hour she repeats this phrase , it must be a favourite one of hers . By five o'clock its recurrence has driven Belinda to the verge of desperation . It seems to her ( though that is a figment of her guilty fancy ) that there is a dreadful meaning and significance in the unblinking look at her with which each repetition of the word is accompanied . Five o'clock ! He has been waiting for her a whole hour beneath St. Bridget 's elms , straining his eyes up the long straight walk . At length : "
140960	140983	140957	140957	I	0	" she says , looking overtly at the clock — at which she has long been stealing covert glances of agonized impatience — "
141009	141010	141012	141012	I	0	" "
141014	141020	141012	141012	I	0	" replies the guest indifferently . "
141057	141521	141523	141523	he	1962	" She ties on her bonnet , and adjusts her strong grey fringe with a maddening deliberation ; stops in the middle to examine and inquire the history of a piece of bric - à - brac , which she had not before noticed ; and finally ( it is said that no Englishwoman ever knows how to take leave ) expends herself in an immense farewell speech , from which the word louche is by no means absent . But she is gone at last . Before she is well round the corner — before there is any real security of her not returning , according to her usual custom , to pounce afresh upon her just - freed prey , Belinda has fled to her room ; and — her trembling preparations hurriedly made — is speeding , like an arrow shot from a bow , to St. Bridget 's . There is no leisureliness about her walk to - day ; no feigned indifference , no loitering , no counterfeit indecision , as to her goal . To - day she can not afford to play her little comedy . Is not she an hour and a quarter late ? Will she find him gone ? Will he still be there ? Will his patience have held out ? In the whole of life , in the whole scheme of nature , there seems to her no other question in the least worth answering . People look at her oddly , she thinks , as she passes . Hitherto she has not minded how many people she met , or who knew whither , and to what end , her steps were tending . To - day it seems as if they all glance meaningly at her , as who should read her guilty secret in her face . Until to - day she has never thought it either a secret , or guilty . An intrigue ! That is what they call it ! She is engaged in an intrigue ; and by some means they know it . As she enters St. Bridget 's a couple of humble lovers meet her face to face . As they pass her they happen to expand into a grin , provoked , probably , by some ponderous joke of their own making ; but she takes it to herself . They know that she is a married woman hastening to an assignation . The very birds seem to chirp , and the boughs to rustle meaningly . Well , let them ! It will be a dreadful memory to face by - and - by ; but for the moment there is no room for any other question but the one — "
141527	141631	141523	141523	he	1962	" Before she reaches their trysting bench it is answered . She comes upon him so suddenly , that she has no time to tone down her pace to a decent saunter . He has seen the speed with which she was hasting towards him ; her breathlessness , her pallor , the desperate anxiety of her eyes . There is no use in shamming to - day . But , indeed , his own condition leaves him no right to criticize hers . Perhaps he is in even worse case than she ; for she can speak , and he can not . "
141637	141659	141523	141523	he	1962	" she says with a gasp , such as one might give whose reprieve met him at the scaffold - foot . "
141667	141778	141523	141523	he	1962	" For answer , he grips her two hands in his ( never before in all his life has he been master , and for how few poor minutes , but of one ) , and looks at her with a white fixity of passion , to whose relief no words come . Even when they are both seated on their bench — neither ever quite knows how they reached it — it is still she who speaks ; nor when she does so , is it to ask him to release her hands . Perhaps in her agitation she is not aware that they are still in his keeping . "
141784	141810	141811	141811	She	1963	" she says , with that gasping staccato utterance , as of one who , after long running , has not yet recovered his wind . "
141824	141832	141819	141819	She	1963	" He nods his head in acquiescence . "
141835	141846	141819	141819	She	1963	" He is plainly incapable of anything beyound a monosyllable . "
141854	141873	141847	141847	She	1963	" says Belinda ; the words fluttering out on greatly quickened breath , but still with more coherence . "
141876	141939	141940	141940	She	1963	" One would say that he were scarcely attending , so distant and dreamful is his voice . He is conscious of nothing but the warmth of those wonderful sweet hands lying in his . If he could realize Miss Watson at all , it would probably be with gratitude ; for it is she virtually who has given them to him . "
141943	141959	141940	141940	She	1963	" continues Belinda , trembling exceedingly , and looking guiltily down on their locked hands , "
141969	141980	141981	141981	She	1963	" She pauses , and then adds in a whisper , "
141988	142013	141981	141981	She	1963	" He is attending now . There is a significance both in her look and in her low words that can not escape him . "
142019	142024	142016	142016	you	1963	" he says thickly . "
142028	142038	142016	142016	you	1963	" she says , still scarcely above a whisper , "
142047	142162	142163	142163	I	0	" She looks away from him as she says it , unwilling , perhaps , to see the immense consternation that her fiat will have brought into his face ; but he observes for so long a dead silence , that she grows uneasy . Has her blow killed him ? or is it possible ( this latter suggestion is a scarcely less bitter one than the former ) that he already acquiesces ? She is just making up her mind to steal a glance at him , when he speaks , and the tone of his voice tells her that her first idea of his case was nearer the mark than her last . "
142171	142172	142175	142175	I	0	" "
142181	142182	142183	142183	I	0	" "
142192	142193	142183	142183	I	0	" "
142196	142197	142183	142183	I	0	" "
142206	142207	142203	142203	you	0	" "
142210	142211	142183	142183	I	0	" "
142215	142225	142183	142183	I	0	" She bows her head , unable to speak . "
142228	142260	142261	142261	We	1964	" She repeats the gesture . There is such a rising strain of unbelieving agony in his voice , culminating in his last words , that speech has wholly forsaken her . "
142275	142284	142261	142261	We	1964	" Again that acquiescent motion of the head . "
142292	142301	142261	142261	We	1964	" correcting himself , with a bitter humility , "
142328	142450	142261	142261	We	1964	" He has let go her hands , and covered his face with his own . She is free to depart . He has always obeyed her ; and he is obeying her now . What is there to keep her ? And yet she does not stir . Her aching eyes stare vacantly down the long straight alley . Sweet green walk ! Dear solemn tower ! Kind chattering birds ! Good - bye ! for never , never can she bear to look upon any of you again ! She stirs restlessly in her misery ; and in an instant he has dropped his shrouding hands , and is looking at her with a haggard apprehension in his eyes . "
142456	142457	142261	142261	We	1964	" "
142466	142471	142261	142261	We	1964	" she answers faintly ; "
142489	142547	142548	142548	I	0	" If he wishes ! He laughs outright in his pain . There is a long , long silence . St. Bridget 's is even emptier than its wo nt . Not one visitor besides themselves breaks its entire seclusion . Only the grave tower - clock deals out time 's little parcels . She speaks first . "
142557	142573	142548	142548	I	0	" she says , with a sort of sob of compassion for his spoilt youth . "
142582	142583	142586	142586	I.	1968	" "
142593	142594	142588	142588	you	1967	" "
142601	142612	142588	142588	you	1967	" she cries , in a heart - wrung accent . "
142625	142629	142588	142588	you	1967	" She stops . "
142633	142674	142588	142588	you	1967	" he says . The word seems to have roused him out of his lethargy of wretchedness . Ere she knows it , he has won back her hands ; and before the strangeness of his eyes her own waver . "
142687	142697	142588	142588	you	1967	" he says , with a thrilling feverish smile ; "
142759	142769	142773	142773	you	0	" ( with a heart - rending inflection ) , "
142821	142833	142838	142838	I	0	" ( passionately fastening his lips upon palm and fingers ) ; "
142881	142890	142899	142899	I	0	" ( with a terrible burst of agony ) "
142904	142915	142899	142899	I	0	" The storm of his passion has carried her away . "
142922	142984	142899	142899	I	0	" she says , frenziedly ; and so unresisting — nay , passionately complying — she gives him that two years and a half ago foregone kiss . One kiss ! That is all . One drunk , oblivious moment , and then the awaking ! She , but now so consentingly embraced , has wrenched herself out of his arms . "
142995	143011	142899	142899	I	0	" she says , staggering away from him . But he awakens slowlier than she . "
143021	143056	143057	143057	I	0	" he cries wildly , and with a sort of triumph . And there is silence . If indeed the loud blood dinning in their ears and hammering their temples can be so called . "
143060	143084	143057	143057	I	0	" she says , after a while , speaking as if speech were a new weapon , and she ill at handling it , "
143127	143151	143125	143125	you	0	" He makes no answer . He is still lapped in the Elysium of that long - promised and at last fulfilled embrace . "
143156	143174	143176	143176	you	0	" she says , looking piercingly at him , and with a sombre reproach in her voice , "
143187	143188	143184	143184	you	0	" "
143193	143209	143184	143184	you	0	" he cries , brought back to his senses by the sternness of her tone . "
143281	143301	143275	143275	I	0	" She has tottered to the bench , and now sits half - crouched in the corner of it . "
143305	143314	143302	143302	I	0	" she says , shaking her head hopelessly , "
143331	143343	143275	143275	I	0	" Then after a pause , with a sort of groan , "
143354	143377	143275	143275	I	0	" He has not sat down again , but stands before her in guilty , miserable humility , waiting for his doom . "
143386	143402	143275	143275	I	0	" she says , after a while , lifting her dull eyes to his face . "
143493	143547	143550	143550	anyone	494	" She glances up at him at intervals , as she plants her stabs , to see how much he can bear . He is not yet at the end of his endurance apparently , for he still stands before her , bent - headed and ash - white , in motionless patience . "
143554	143592	143550	143550	anyone	494	" she says , dropping her arms hopelessly to her sides , and looking distractedly upwards , as if to win a response from that sky to which we , in trouble never answered , ever look , "
143600	143622	143623	143623	I	0	" Her cruelty towards himself he had taken like a man ; but her self - pity is beyond his sufferance . "
143633	143648	143623	143623	I	0	" he says in a rapid broken whisper , sitting down again beside her . "
143706	143707	143657	143657	you	0	" "
143710	143728	143657	143657	you	0	" she cries hoarsely , thrusting out her spread hands , and pushing him away from her . "
143751	143769	143745	143745	you	0	" The terror in her eyes , the shrinking gesture , have set him almost beside himself . "
143782	143842	143773	143773	you	0	" he says , with a sort of hard sob , and I dare say you are right ; but I must ask you to — to — make a little allowance for me ! I am not in my right wits . It was unmanly of me — I had no right to shock — to outrage you . "
143843	143852	143853	143853	she	0	" I am not in the least shocked , "
143860	143916	143853	143853	she	0	" that shows , I suppose , to what a depth I must have fallen . I stopped you because — because I knew that if I let you finish your sentence I should — not — have — said — no — to you : I — should — have — said — yes . "

145169	145175	145177	145178	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Perhaps she had money , "
145180	145184	145177	145178	Mrs. Churchill	185	" Dear me ! "
145193	145208	145177	145178	Mrs. Churchill	185	" what a load for those poor horses , and how they are smoking ! "
145209	145219	145221	145221	Sarah	135	" They are all out on the balcony now , "

145249	145260	145262	145263	Mrs. Churchill	185	" It makes one quite wretched to see such cruelty ! "
145276	145285	145287	145287	Sarah	135	" They have been playing battledore and shuttlecock , "
145290	145300	145287	145287	Sarah	135	" I wish we had a battledore and shuttlecock . "
145301	145311	145313	145314	her grandmother	2703	" Whom would you expect to play with you ? "
145317	145324	145313	145314	her grandmother	2703	" the Professor , or me ? "
145325	145335	145337	145337	Sarah	135	" They have dropped the shuttlecock into the road , "
145348	145430	145337	145337	Sarah	135	" There is another man with them now ; he can not be a third brother ; they are betting him a shilling that he will not climb over the balcony and swarm down the iron leg to fetch it . What a fool he will be if he does ! Surely I have seen him before somewhere ! I wish he would look up . Why , granny ! Belinda ! granny!—it is — it must be — young Bellairs ! "
145486	145494	145496	145496	Sarah	135	" Young Bellairs ! Poor young Bellairs ! "
145507	145521	145499	145499	herself	135	" Young Bellairs , and the dinghey ! do you remember , Belinda ? "
145534	145550	145552	145553	Miss Churchill	152	" I wonder is there a dinghey here that I could take him out in ? "
145556	145590	145552	145553	Miss Churchill	152	" Granny , are you aware that a dinghey only holds two ? but if you insist upon it , in the interests of propriety , we will squeeze you in as well . "
145595	145606	145608	145608	she	185	" I need not decide at once , need I ? "
145615	145640	145608	145608	she	185	" and as the dinghey is not here , and the carriage is , we may as well be setting off on our drive . "
145641	145649	145651	145651	Sarah	135	" He will see me get in ! "
145663	145696	145697	145697	They	2023	" they watch us quite as much as we watch them . Well , let him ! I flatter myself that I can get into a carriage with any woman in England ! "
145719	145732	145706	145707	Miss Churchill	152	" Mind that you keep a good look - out upon them ! "
147579	147583	147576	147576	she	134	" Come in ! "
147840	147889	147817	147817	he	3764	" I have just seen your name in the Visitors ' Book ; believe me , it is by a pure accident that I am here ; must I go ? If I do not see you at the table - d'hôte I shall understand that I must . "
147891	148338	147817	147817	he	3764	" Long after she has mastered its contents — surely not difficult of comprehension — she remains staring at the page with wide dull eyes : a feeling of blankest disappointment at her heart . And yet , had she expected him , in writing , on a paper committed to a careless hand — a paper that might easily go astray , or be lost — to break out into compromising , culpable endearments ? She would be outraged by the suggestion . But oh ! it is cruel , cruel of him to have thrust the weight of the decision upon her ; to have taken their meeting out of the province of accident into which she had joyfully recognised it as having fallen ! Since he has forced choice upon her , there is but one way in which she can choose . He must have known it ! He must have done it on purpose ! Honourable of him ? Perhaps ! Her mind gives a frigid assent . But oh , cold , cold , and most cruel ! His very face had told her that he was changed . He has grown wise at last . Well , he shall never know that she was not as wise as he . She has crumpled the paper angrily in her hand , and begun to walk agitatedly up and down the room , pressing and kneading it with her fevered fingers . Then her mood changes , and she stops and anxiously smooths out the letter again . Perhaps she is wronging him . Perhaps in the first stun of that surprise he has scarcely known what he wrote ; has not perceived the drift of his own words . Perhaps , on a closer examination , she may find , by the tremulousness of his characters , that he had not his wits about him . But no . There is no tremulousness . Strong and decided is each up and down stroke . The man who penned that note was obviously in fullest possession of his intellect and mastery over his nerves . She is still poring over the few matter - of - fact words , vainly trying to wrench them into a sense that they can not bear , when a high , light laugh , which can not be ascribed to anyone but Miss Churchill , heard on the landing outside , makes her , in guilty haste , thrust the document into her pocket . It is only just in time ; for there is always a sort of whirlwind suddenness about Sarah 's entries . "
148341	148349	148365	148365	he	2103	" cries she , in high excitement , "
148382	148425	148378	148378	he	2103	" It is a proof how far Mrs. Forth 's thoughts have been straying from the young gentleman in question , that at first she looks back at her sister in blank stupidity , not understanding to what or whom she alludes . "
148428	148433	148378	148378	he	2103	" she says thickly ; "
148439	148452	148378	148378	he	2103	" ( with a forced laugh ; comprehension coming tardily back ) , "
148498	148499	148501	148501	he	2103	" "
148503	148524	148501	148501	he	2103	" replies Sarah , simulating the first symptoms of a swoon , and falling in a heap upon the sofa ; "
148561	148707	148501	148501	he	2103	" The Professor 's room , as well as Belinda 's own , is at the top of the house . Economy , as is well known , has to be sought in hotels by climbing ; and the Professor has pursued her to the leads . At their first coming , indeed , the numerous flights of stairs to be surmounted ere attaining her sloped roof and her trucklebed , had proved a severe tax upon Mrs. Forth 's enfeebled strength ; but use and returning health have made them easy . At all events , Belinda does not now think twice about climbing them , even if no absolute necessity prompt the assent . Is it absolute necessity that , half an hour after Sarah 's return , finds her first faintly knocking , and then looking uncertainly into her husband 's room . "
148730	148874	148501	148501	he	2103	" cries a crabbed voice from the interior . She complies by entering . Owing to the confined space allotted to him , the Professor has to use some nicety of management in the disposition of his property — a disposition which entails the entire going to the wall of his toilette arrangements . Both bed and floor are strewn with folios and MS . , which are piled , to the exclusion of basin and ewer , even upon the cramped washhand - stand . Upon the one chair the occupant of the attic is seated : a fur - coat wrapped about his thin figure , a skull - cap on his head , his feet aloft upon a hot - water bottle , a writing - case upon his meagre knees and an ink - horn in his left hand . "
148882	148904	148501	148501	he	2103	" he says sharply , looking up and becoming aware of the tall , fair presence that has enriched his neighbourhood . "
148916	148931	148907	148907	you	2108	" She had not seen it ; but she at once corrects her error . "
148947	148963	148935	148935	I	0	" he continues , since she does not at once speak or explain her entrance ; "
148978	148993	148994	148994	I	0	" ( with a resentful glance at her idle and obviously convalescent beauty ) , "
149016	149017	149004	149004	you	2108	" "
149037	149042	149026	149026	you	0	" replies she coldly ; "
149075	149076	149066	149066	you	0	" "
149090	149141	149066	149066	you	0	" he asks , with a sudden , quick look of peevish anxiety . She shakes her head , smiling suddenly and bitterly . It is so apparent that his solicitude is due , not to care for her health , but to apprehension of a new doctor 's bill . "
149146	149147	149066	149066	you	0	" "
149157	149166	149148	149148	You	2108	" he says , in a vexed voice . "
149182	149214	149148	149148	You	2108	" replies she sullenly . Perhaps his examination of her face has reassured him as to her soundness , for once more he dips his pen into the ink - horn . "
149222	149246	149215	149215	You	0	" says she brusquely , perceiving in him a deliberate intention of henceforth ignoring her . He makes a gesture of annoyed impatience . "
149274	149275	149278	149278	I	0	" "
149282	149283	149278	149278	I	0	" "
149325	149339	149312	149312	I	0	" At the contempt and churlishness of his tone , her cheek burns . "
149351	149357	149346	149346	I	0	" she answers , doggedly ; "
149367	149368	149359	149359	I	0	" "
149377	149385	149386	149386	I	0	" cries he , in hasty displeasure . "
149398	149399	149400	149400	I	0	" "
149425	149426	149418	149418	she	156	" "
149438	149473	149427	149427	I	0	" rejoins he , nettled , whether at his interrupted work , or at the accent , which she has taken small pains to render slight , laid by her upon the personal pronoun . "
149547	149594	149598	149598	your	2108	" He is so surprised by the entire silence in which she accepts his fiat , that he looks up irritatedly at her , standing in sullen , motionless loveliness beside him ; looks up to find her regarding him with a smile hard to qualify . "
149608	149617	149618	149618	you	2108	" she says , with a low emphasis ; "
149624	149625	149618	149618	you	2108	" "
149639	149648	149626	149626	I	0	" replies he , with ill - humour ; "
149663	149673	149661	149661	anyone	494	" with a recurrence of that streak of resentment , "
149707	149722	149723	149723	You	2108	" The singular smile still stays , as it were stereotyped upon her features . "
149728	149747	149748	149748	You	0	" she says , in a tone of quiet insolence . The colour mounts to his parched face . "
149752	149760	149762	149762	you	0	" he says , with deliberate anger , "
149777	149784	149785	149785	I	0	" She shrugs her shoulders carelessly . "
149808	149809	149812	149812	you	0	" "
149814	149818	149812	149812	you	0	" he answers . "
149827	149890	149812	149812	you	0	" There is such a pregnant weight of solemn meaning in his look and words , that , for a moment , she glances at him , staggered and half - frightened ; he waving her , in a displeasure too deep for further speech , to the door . But the impression does not last beyond the first flight of stairs . "
149893	149901	149902	149902	he	2108	" she says , reaching the landing , "
149909	150396	149902	149902	he	2108	" The table - d'hôte bell has rung , and , answering its call , the visitors at the Lowood Hotel have poured into the large , light dining - room , and quickly filled up the two long tables , where , as the season advances to its height , elbow - room becomes daily scarcer . The established visitors have made their way to their habitual places , and the new ones been ushered to theirs . The oldest inhabitant , who always says grace , has said it , and the landlord is ladling out the soup . Belinda is in her usual seat , between her husband and her sister . It is a situation of her own choosing — as far as regards her sister , at least . The Professor is not a good person to depend upon for general conversation through a long dinner ; the almost insoluble problem of how to obtain his full pennyworth — how to eat so much as to ensure that no extortionate profit shall accrue from him to the proprietors of the hotel , and yet how to eat so little and so lightly as not to alarm his coy and skittish digestion — keeping him for the most part wholly silent . But Sarah is royally indifferent as to what pecuniary advantage may be derived from her , and has no more consciousness of digestion than an emu ; so , upon her sprightly comments on their fellow - diners , Belinda has usually relied to drag her through the ennui of the long and weary courses . To - day she lends them but an abstracted ear . Though she has entered and taken her place without once looking up , she yet knows at once that for her the full room is empty . Gradually she allows her eyes to steal round a glance , in confirmation of that of which she is already sure . Here are the forms and faces that a week 's fellow - eating has made rather more familiar to her than her own . Here are the usual vis - à - vis , the stockbroking family : jocose red father , aiming side - hits of well - meant pleasantry at herself and her sister ; full - blown , hearty mother ; elaborately elegant daughter . At the far end of the board a few insignificant novelties . That is all ! It is true that he may be placed at the other table , to which her back is turned ; but this , a guilty consciousness prevents her moving her head to ascertain . Were he there , however , it is certain that he would be seen by Sarah , who is constantly throwing restless glances over her shoulder , in pursuit of the object of her own interest . "
150401	150411	150398	150398	they	2121	" she cries , jogging her sister 's elbow ; "
150449	150563	150442	150442	I	0	" Belinda smiles faintly . The soup - plates are vanishing . It is evident that he is not coming . Her compromising concession has been made in vain . It was her part to shun him ; and she has forced him to shun her . Probably she will never now have an opportunity of exculpating herself , even to the extent of making her lame explanation of the way in which it came about . How these people opposite stare ! She has begun desperately to fan herself ; but the Professor at once requests her to stop , as the current of air produced by her fan makes him sneeze . "
150574	150584	150587	150587	he	2125	" says Sarah , in her sister 's ear . "
150603	150670	150672	150672	you	2127	" This last ejaculation is uttered in a key differing so widely from the cold - blooded calm of her former aspirations , that Belinda gives an involuntary start — a start that may or may not be observed by him who has just quietly entered the room , and is having a reversed chair at the other table obsequiously set on its legs for him . "
150679	150704	150706	150706	you	2127	" asks Sarah , very low . But Belinda does not answer . A mad relief — a lunatic joy is choking her throat . "
150708	150714	150672	150672	you	2127	" repeats the other urgently ; "
150719	150720	150672	150672	you	2127	" "
150730	150739	150722	150722	you	2127	" says Belinda , in a suffocating whisper . "
150748	150773	150722	150722	you	2127	" There is so much of the lion - at - bay in her lightning eyes , that Sarah wisely desists from further questioning . "
150792	150846	150847	150847	I	0	" she says ; her mind reverting to the truant Bellairs . Happily for Belinda , that culprit now appears on the scene , shortly followed by his companion in guilt ; and for the rest of dinner Miss Churchill 's conversation becomes an indignant recitative , a running commentary upon their actions . "
150961	151225	150943	150943	He	2125	" Belinda is well content to allow the stream of soliloquy beside her to flow on unchecked . A silent husband — ever tussling with his economico - sanitary problem ; a self - absorbed sister ; what better neighbours could she wish for ? Even the family opposite , whose notice had before annoyed her , immersed in good cheer , have forgotten her . She can lean back unnoticed , and sun herself in the feeling — not recognised nor formulated enough to constitute a relfection — that though he is lost to her sight , so is she assuredly not to his . He is probably wondering why her hair is cut short . Does he think it an improvement ? Possibly it may appear to him in a high degree disfiguring . It is the first time that the question of the becomingness or unbecomingness of her crop - head has presented itself to Mrs. Forth 's mind . She is not one of those happy women whose beauty is per se , and to themselves as good , for pleasure and profit , as an estate in the Three per Cents . She has never cared for it except as it affected him . Is she much disfigured ? She lifts one hand and passes it over her shining tendrils , as if to obtain an answer by touch . In so doing , and in consequence of the small space allotted to each diner , her lifted elbow comes into momentary contact with her husband 's sleeve . "
151231	151281	150943	150943	He	2125	" she says , starting . No galvanic shock sent with uncomfortable sense of dislocation along bone and joint could have brought her down more suddenly from that vision - world through which , happy and crop - headed , she has , during three courses , been walking . "
151286	151315	151228	151228	your	2135	" says the Professor , glancing upbraidingly at her empty plate , and contrasting resentfully in his mind his own heroic efforts with her supine and culpable abstinence ; "
151335	151336	151228	151228	your	2135	" "
151359	151517	151348	151348	I	0	" replies she surlily ; and with that their conjugal dialogue ends . The dinner , too , has ended by - and - by . The oldest inhabitant has given vent to his second grace ; and there is a rustling and streaming through the passage into the hall , and out upon grass - plat and pier . Usually the Churchill party do not participate in this latter outward movement . To watch the humours of the company from the privacy of their sitting - room window has , on previous evenings , seemed to them better than mingling with them . But to - night Belinda lingers . She must speak to him . In justice to herself , to him , to her husband even , she must speak to him . It would be impossible to leave him in that misapprehension about her , under which he must necessarily now be lying . "
151523	151538	151519	151519	you	2136	" asks Sarah , with a sharp look in her sister 's agitated face . "
151578	151583	151561	151561	they	2138	" ( shivering ) , "
151609	151772	151774	151774	you	2140	" She runs off , and Belinda , with as composed an air as she can muster , strolls towards the pier , and , leaning her arms upon the rail , looks down into the troubled lake water . It is a chill and unsummerlike night ; raw - aired and boisterous . The clouds hug the hills and smother the struggling moon . Many people , feeling the nipping breeze , have hastened indoors again . Others come out , fortified by Newmarket coats or fur capes . How can they find it cold ? To her it seems to be torrid . Her eyes are fixed upon the angry little waves , sucking , and fighting , and dashing themselves against jetty and shore ; and the steps of the promenading , cigarette - smoking , chatting idlers , pass to and fro behind her . They do not all pass her . Two feet pause hesitatingly beside her . "
151779	151825	151774	151774	you	2140	" His face may be older than it was , and his handwriting steadier , but at all events his voice trembles quite as much as ever it did . What sense is there in being glad at that ? And yet she is glad . "
151828	151856	151774	151774	you	2140	" she answers whisperingly , neither looking up , nor expressing any surprise at his presence , nor at his omitting all the forms of conventional greeting ; "
151869	151901	151902	151902	My	0	" She pauses ; but , except that she hears his quick breathing beside her , he may be gone : in so entire a silence does he await her explanation . "
151913	151933	151906	151907	Mr. Forth	209	" she says , growing burning red at what she feels must appear the wretched inadequacy of this explanation . "
151944	151951	151953	151953	he	209	" breaking into a nervous laugh , "
151963	152056	152057	152057	You	0	" Still silence . Has he nothing to say ? not even one poor word of pleasure ? Probably he is nerving himself up to exact an answer to that question of his , which she has virtually never answered . Probably he is going — oh , barbarous!—to throw the decision again upon her . But perhaps he has learned , within the last hour , to let sleeping dogs lie . At all events , when his speech comes , it is not the one she had dreaded to hear . "
152062	152063	152064	152064	You	0	" "
152073	152080	152064	152064	You	0	" replies she , laughing again ; "
152101	152141	152084	152085	Mr. Forth	209	" It is the second time within two minutes that she has quoted her husband . Does she feel a sort of chaperonage in his very name ? At that name a slight shudder passes over Rivers 's frame . "
152148	152149	152143	152143	you	0	" "
152153	152162	152084	152085	Mr. Forth	209	" she says , with a cynical shrug ; "
152204	152218	152229	152229	your	0	" In his ears , possibly , it does not sound so well . "
152221	152227	152229	152229	your	0	" he repeats , shocked . "
152237	152238	152239	152239	Nobody	2422	" "
152244	152283	152285	152285	you	0	" replies she , quoting Desdemona , and with about as much truth in her speech as there was in that of the Moor 's wife . How loud and restless is the waves ' wash beneath them ! "
152287	152292	152285	152285	you	0	" she says softly ; "
152304	152310	152285	152285	you	0	" with a melancholy smile , "
152325	152326	152285	152285	you	0	" "
152329	152351	152285	152285	you	0	" he answers , with a sort of humility , as if he were ashamed of having to make the admission ; "
152358	152359	152352	152352	I	0	" "
152371	152389	152352	152352	I	0	" she says , glancing at him with a sort of reproach for his health and vigour ; "
152440	152584	152649	152649	you	2150	" She has raised herself from her bent posture , and has lifted that face , whose character seems to be changed and gentled by her babyish hair , to the sky . What strange clouds , like giant curls and columns of sacrificial smoke from the altar of some dark God ! and the bright gibbous moon shouldering her way through a sullen pile before she can reach a clear sky - space , and make the dark mere chastely splendid . How few people are left upon the pier ! By what right is she left ? They have closed the windows of her grandmother 's sitting - room . She can see the silhouette of Mrs. Churchill 's cap upon the blind . Why is not her own silhouette there too ? Alas ! in five minutes it must be ! "
152591	152619	152649	152649	you	2150	" he says , in a shaken , low voice . ( Can this wonder desire that the world should be made dark by her extinction ? ) "
152622	152627	152649	152649	you	2150	" she answers dreamily . "
152651	152659	152649	152649	you	2150	" looking at him with a moonlit wavering smile—"but
152692	152693	152649	152649	you	2150	" "
152697	152711	152725	152725	I	0	" he cries , breaking into a sudden , unsteady , tender laugh ; "
152722	152723	152716	152716	you	2149	" "
152729	152739	152716	152716	you	2149	" returns she , in a kind of scorn ; "
152757	152758	152716	152716	you	2149	" "
152766	152778	152716	152716	you	2149	" he answers , still with that tremulous , unglad laugh ; "
152803	152804	152795	152795	others	1101	" "
152814	152823	152806	152806	you	2150	" interrupts she , with a quivering lip ; "
152851	152861	152846	152847	Lord Mayor	333	" dragging out the slow syllables one after another , "
152868	152869	152846	152847	Lord Mayor	333	" "
152876	152892	152894	152894	you	0	" repeats he after her , with something not unlike a sob in his voice ; "
152914	153055	152894	152894	you	0	" There is not a soul remaining on the pier beside themselves . Even Mrs. Churchill 's shadow has disappeared from the blind . It is clear that she has had the fire lit , and has drawn up her chair to it . Has no one , then , a glance for the black and silver water ? for these great cloud - bulks , and this victorious maiden moon ? Not a soul ! It is all their own , his and hers ! all the night 's cold steely splendour ! all the wind 's wintry song , and the waves ' loud lap ! Surely their voices are no sadder than his — his , with that sob in it ! How easily she could sob too ! Perhaps her spirits are weakened by recent sickness . "
153062	153069	153072	153072	you	0	" she says , half hysterically ; "
153075	153076	153072	153072	you	0	" "
153082	153098	153079	153079	I	0	" cries a high , matter - of - fact voice , striking suddenly in ; "
153134	153148	153129	153129	you	0	" with a very slight and cursory recognition of Mrs. Forth 's companion . "
153159	153207	153149	153149	Belinda	134	" There is something in Miss Churchill 's tone , and in the decision of the way in which she has put her arm under her sister 's , and is leading her away , that it would require a clearer conscience than Belinda 's to resist . "
153217	153221	153208	153208	I	0	" she stammers . "
153229	153240	153244	153244	he	143	" — shrugging her shoulders , and relapsing into a lighter tone—"I
153285	153381	153382	153382	I	0	" Although there may be something in Professor Forth 's remark that no one , not let into the secret , could now conjecture his wife 's invalidhood , yet , by right of that invalidhood , she has hitherto been excluded from the longer excursions made by her grandmother and sister in the neighbourhood , as being too severe a tax upon her not yet completely restored powers . But on the morning succeeding her lake - side colloquy , Mrs. Forth is , it appears , expected to resume the habits of health . "
153389	153436	153437	153437	Granny	156	" says Miss Churchill , running to meet her sister , as that sister enters Mrs. Churchill 's sitting - room after breakfast , and lifting a cheek as fresh and sweet as soap and water , health and jollity , can make it to hers . "
153510	153548	153549	153549	You	721	" By the extreme positiveness of her tone , and determination of her eye , it may be inferred that Sarah looks for a demurrer to this proposition . If such comes , it comes in silence . "
153558	153564	153549	153549	You	721	" pursues Miss Churchill warmly ; "
153600	153608	153593	153593	Menander	287	" Belinda laughs , a little unnaturally . "
153627	153628	153618	153618	Menander	287	" "
153643	153648	153651	153651	you	721	" rejoins Sarah lightly ; "
153654	153655	153651	153651	you	721	" "
153665	153689	153692	153692	you	721	" replies Belinda , walking to the window , and pointing in faint objection to the blind vapours that feel about the mountaincrests ; "
153701	153702	153692	153692	you	721	" "
153710	153715	153692	153692	you	721	" retorts Sarah drily . "
153728	153729	153730	153730	I	0	" "
153741	153753	153733	153734	Mr. Forth	209	" says Belinda reluctantly , leaving the room with lagging steps . "
153774	153790	153766	153766	you	0	" cries Sarah saucily after her . She returns presently with still more lagging steps . "
153793	153794	153766	153766	you	0	" "
153800	153818	153795	153795	He	209	" answers Mrs. Forth slackly , sitting down , and letting her arms drop depressedly beside her . "
153832	153843	153819	153819	You	0	" cries Sarah sharply , and with a pungent laugh . "
153850	153869	153880	153880	your	0	" replies Belinda , reddening , and with a petulance which shows that this shaft has gone home ; "
153898	154055	153884	153884	I	0	" The carriage is at the door , and a few such idlers as mostly watch the arrival and departure of each coming and going vehicle , hang about it . Sarah is already seated , and is exchanging such chastened and diluted gallantries as the publicity of the situation will admit , with some one hanging over the balcony overhead . Belinda has purposely loitered over her dressing , in the hope that some opportune mountain storm may even yet intervene to hinder the execution of the , to her , so distasteful project . But in vain . The perverse and hostile sky is , all too obviously , clearing . As she issues from the hall , she glances furtively to right and left . Yes , he is here ! His voice , which but for Sarah 's manoeuvring might have been all day in her happy ears , is addressing her . "
154061	154084	153884	153884	I	0	" ( Do they all hear , as plainly as she does , the blank disappointment and discomfiture of his tone ? ) "
154087	154106	153884	153884	I	0	" she answers , lifting for an instant her eyes with an instinct of ungovernable plaintiveness to his ; "
154121	154163	154183	154183	I	0	" She has taken her seat , and , just as they are setting off , she leans forward , and addressing the driver , repeats in a peculiarly clear and distinct voice that direction which has already been given him , "
154167	154168	154183	154183	I	0	" "
154186	154196	154183	154183	I	0	" says Sarah sarcastically . Belinda 's chest heaves . "
154208	154213	154203	154204	Mr. Bellairs	282	" she answers ironically . "
154233	154234	154235	154235	I	0	" "
154250	154255	154256	154256	I	0	" replies Sarah tranquilly . "
154271	154513	154268	154268	mine	0	" Away they go from the wind - freshened lake , whose waves are running riot in the sun ; while , as they pass along , the clouds roll up and up from fell and scaw and nab , leaving only a lawny kerchief here and there about their necks ; as though loth all at once to desert them . And by - and - by kerchief and veil are swept away too , and the hills are free . Through loveliest pasture - fields , crowded with great bluebells and vetches , and meadow - sweet that smells of almonds ; by meadows where women are tossing the late hay , beside the laughing Rotha ; under Loughrigg and over chattering Brathay 's grey stone bridge they go . Up and up they climb ; between the weather - painted walls , with their lavish ferns and their crannied flowers ; till at the top of the long ascent they pause to breathe the horses , and look back . Fair mountain - wonders , now again conversing with the clouds ; and yet lit on your bare flanks by the sun : Red Screes , Fairfield , Wansfell Pike , with your pointed head ! to which of you shall we give crown and sceptre , as Queen - hill , in this your morning glory ? For a while they both look in silence . Then : "
154528	154624	154268	154268	mine	0	" says Sarah regretfully . Belinda 's heart gives a passionate assent , though her lips are closed . Is not life full of such pities ? of exquisite spread feasts , and gagged mouths that are not allowed to taste them ? With what an agony of pleasure would she be looking at these curly mists and shining shoulders ; at these heavenly becks , rain - swollen in their noisy mirth , dashing in happy bounds down the hillsides , if only — if only ! And this is such an easy , probable "
154627	154630	154632	154632	you	2169	" too ! "
154641	154654	154632	154632	you	2169	" continues Miss Churchill , turning in calm reasoning to her sister , "
154685	154704	154675	154675	you	2169	" But Belinda is still staring , in sullen , grudging misery at the wasted loveliness before her . "
154720	154725	154675	154675	you	2169	" says Sarah persuasively . "
154743	154755	154756	154756	You	2169	" But Mrs. Forth is unable to promise even thus much . "
154762	154767	154756	154756	You	2169	" says Sarah leniently ; "
154798	154873	154899	154899	her	2170	" But as time goes on , this seems to be the species of landscape to which Miss Churchill is to - day to be condemned . Although Coniston has been long ago reached , luncheon eaten , and several coaches and char - à - bancs driven up and unloaded , yet is there no sign of the appearance of any one of the ornamental foreground figures for which she had confidently looked . "
154879	154884	154899	154899	her	2170	" says she tragically ; "
154911	154916	154917	154917	I	0	" Belinda laughs grimly . "
154921	154922	154917	154917	I	0	" "
154936	154942	154948	154948	they	2171	" says Sarah , yawning ; "
155014	155028	155029	155029	I	0	" They set out dispiritedly , but before they have gone five yards : "
155039	155045	154980	154981	the waiter	2174	" cries Sarah , brightening , "
155053	155054	154980	154981	the waiter	2174	" "
155060	155084	154980	154981	the waiter	2174	" replies Belinda morosely . A walk undertaken in such a spirit is not likely to be productive of any very acute enjoyment . "
155099	155104	155105	155105	I	0	" says Sarah gloomily ; "
155117	155216	155217	155217	I	0	" But they have not the energy even to make this experiment . They have passed village and white - washed church , and asking their way of the civil villagers , presently find themselves climbing a mountain road , with a little gay river frisking over its worn boulder stones on their right , and a green fell on their left . Ere long the road leaves the bright beck , and climbs higher than it ; and trees interpose a leafy shield between them and their noisy friend . But it calls to them from beneath , "
155228	155331	155332	155332	My	0	" And so they do . For by - and - by the road swerves to the right , and they are once more free from the envious sycamores and mountain ashes , with their red rosaries , and are standing on a rough stone mortarless bridge with parapet broken down , and beneath them the stream plunges in a little storm of foam . Is this the waterfall ? They do not know ; they do not much care . It is a little waterfall , even if it be not the one in search of which they have been sent . "
155337	155345	155346	155346	I	0	" says Sarah , sitting resolutely down . "
155399	155400	155393	155393	she	2180	" "
155407	155440	155393	155393	she	2180	" asks Belinda cynically . Mrs. Forth is still standing , her eyes riveted on the little cascade , and her heart repeating over and over to itself that bitter morning plaint : "
155452	155453	155454	155454	Belinda	134	" "
155456	155472	155474	155474	you	134	" says her sister , after a while , in a voice of cautious triumph , "
155500	155517	155519	155519	he	2181	" Then , with an abrupt change of tone to one of sharp and real annoyance : "
155529	155530	155525	155525	David	143	" "
155539	155556	155559	155559	we	2182	" says Miss Churchill demurely , a couple of minutes later , addressing the new arrivals ; "
155577	155578	155568	155568	you	0	" "
155587	155597	155568	155568	you	0	" replies Bellairs , with an unvarnished boyish bluntness . "
155613	155716	155717	155717	You	0	" For once in her life Sarah looks a shade foolish . Belinda , still standing , has remained looking , as if in absorption , at the waterfall . It is not much of one , after all . Its noise does not deafen you ; its spray does not drench you ; it is but a few feet that it plunges . But how snowy - clean is its foam ! How agilely it springs down ! How pleasant its voice ! Like the voice of Undine calling to her false Huldbrand ! What wondrous green ferns lip its waters ! "
155724	155868	155717	155717	You	0	" This is the murmur that comes to Belinda 's ear . Is it the brook that utters it ? She turns her head sharply away ; but not before he has seen that the rowan - berries are scarcely redder than she . And then ( neither inviting , nor being invited ) they saunter away together , as if they would fain follow the stream to its springs in the mountain - lap . At least , they may lend it their company for a little while . Almost in silence they linger along , and gravely watch its lovely antics , as , in little cataracts and water - breaks and jumps , it sings and dances along in its jubilant old age ( for how many centuries has it sung and capered ? ) that is so like youth ! "
155881	155997	155717	155717	You	0	" said Mrs. Forth , with an excited laugh , sitting down on a grey stone beside the road that leads up to the copper - mines . The sun has gone for awhile , and the fells look serious and careworn . They are old , too , like the brook ; but they scarcely carry their years so well . He has thrown himself at her feet , that favourite symbolic attitude of his — body and soul , past , present , and future — is not he always there ? In their ears is the booming of the mountain bees ; and the rivulet 's warble . There is no longer an "
155999	156001	156051	156051	you	2184	" ! "
156012	156046	156005	156005	you	2184	" she asks abruptly . She had not meant to put the question , and bitterly regrets it when it is pronounced ; but it forces itself out , in spite of her . "
156055	156066	156051	156051	you	2184	" Her forehead contracts with a furrow of angry pain . "
156078	156083	156067	156067	You	2184	" she answers indignantly ; "
156101	156102	156092	156092	you	2184	" "
156105	156122	156092	156092	you	2184	" he answers , looking full at her , and speaking steadily , though very low , "
156141	156157	156132	156132	I	0	" Her eyes drop , and now the rowanberries claim no kinship with her cheeks . "
156163	156173	156132	156132	I	0	" she answers faintly , turning dead - white . "
156176	156185	156132	156132	I	0	" he says slowly , yet with agitation , "
156208	156213	156132	156132	I	0	" with rising passion . "
156232	156240	156132	156132	I	0	" speaking with a sort of despair , "
156248	156258	156259	156259	You	2184	" Her hot fingers pick the cool mountain daisies . "
156267	156366	156367	156367	You	0	" she murmurs , half in tears . How solemnly the hills are listening ! The higher ones , indeed , are out of sight ; so forwardly have grim Coniston Old Man 's younger brothers thrust themselves before him . From the bridge come sounds of rapturous manly merriment , which tell how far ahead of the banjo and its owner Sarah 's tongue is triumphantly carrying her . Rivers has raised himself into a sitting posture , and in his hand he is bruising and crushing a bit of the dwarf bracken that grows beside them . "
156378	156383	156384	156384	you	0	" he says indistinctly ; "
156393	156412	156384	156384	you	0	" Is there any slightest doubt as to what her answer should be ; and yet she hesitates . "
156422	156432	156434	156434	I	0	" she answers , as if apologetically and sobbing ; "
156464	156471	156483	156483	you	0	" with a sort of exasperation , "
156487	156564	156565	156565	I	0	" He looks at her in a dumb agony for fully a hundred heart - beats . Does she know what she is asking of him ? In her divine high innocence she does not understand . It is for him to understand for her ! Her head is bent , and upon her white hands and whiter daisies one slow tear splashes . Until that tear it was possible to him ! Until that tear ! "
156573	156584	156588	156588	you	0	" he cries in passionate excitement , wholly carried away ; "
156639	156640	156628	156628	you	0	" "
156645	156668	156628	156628	you	0	" she says , shuddering , too late terrified by the wildness of his look and the mad triumph of his eyes ; "
156672	156689	156628	156628	you	0	" Is it indeed ? There has been a week in which to answer this question . "
156700	156757	156628	156628	you	0	" says Mrs. Churchill pettishly . The hour is the immediately after breakfast one ; and she is sitting at the table , an open writing - case before her , papers and an hotel bill spread around . Her usual equable brow is ruffled . The manager of the hotel has just left the room . "
156781	156792	156773	156773	we	2189	" continues Mrs. Churchill in a tonc of growing annoyance . "
156819	156830	156831	156831	I	0	" says Sarah in an amused voice from the window . "
156873	156874	156875	156875	I	0	" "
156895	156901	156875	156875	I	0	" says Mrs. Churchill indignantly . "
156992	156993	156966	156966	you	134	" "
157002	157011	157012	157012	I	0	" replies Belinda , though her face burns . "
157034	157094	157095	157095	I	0	" As she speaks she walks to the door , opens it , and closes it gently behind her ; then deliberately mounts the stairs to her husband 's attic . His occupation seems to be of somewhat the same nature as her grandmother 's . At least , before him too , papers and a bill are spread . "
157107	157117	157095	157095	I	0	" he says , looking up as she enters ; "
157130	157139	157118	157118	I	0	" indicating them with his long thin forefinger , "
157213	157214	157197	157197	I	0	" "
157225	157234	157243	157243	my	0	" still with that burning in her face ; "
157240	157241	157243	157243	my	0	" "
157249	157254	157243	157243	my	0	" replies he sharply ; "
157263	157270	157278	157278	you	134	" again referring to the bill , "
157297	157298	157278	157278	you	134	" "
157301	157308	157278	157278	you	134	" replies she , defiantly shrugging her shoulders—"two
157316	157330	157331	157331	You	134	" He looks at her with a not altogether ill - founded exasperation . "
157346	157351	157331	157331	You	134	" he says slowly ; "
157408	157440	157441	157441	You	0	" She has been looking straight before her , with a dogged insouciance ; but at the mention of his purpose of departure that look vanishes , and her cheeks blanch . "
157448	157457	157441	157441	You	0	" she says , in a low voice ; "
157461	157465	157469	157469	you	0	" with irony , "
157487	157488	157469	157469	you	0	" "
157498	157508	157509	157509	I	0	" rejoins he , colouring faintly at her tone ; "
157562	157563	157565	157565	I	0	" "
157567	157588	157565	157565	I	0	" she answers , with a preoccupied air , as if she were not thinking of what she was saying . "
157600	157601	157602	157602	I	0	" "
157636	157637	157639	157639	you	0	" "
157658	157693	157639	157639	you	0	" she interrupts , with a sort of gasp . Her eyes are dilated , and there is a roughness in her voice which she herself hears . He makes a sign of assent . "
157698	157707	157708	157708	you	0	" she says , speaking low and rapidly ; "
157769	157812	157744	157744	you	0	" He turns his eyes slowly from the bill , on which they have been , until now , riveted , in painstaking search for errors , the discovery of which may diminish the total , and fixes them piercingly upon her . "
157824	157831	157744	157744	you	0	" he says , very slowly ; "
157841	158001	157834	157834	you	0	" There is that in his tone , or she thinks so , which is unlike anything she has ever heard in it before — that which at once strikes her murmurings dumb . But a passing frenzy seizes her , bidding her answer him , for once truly ; tell him , in so many words , face to face , why ; to throw the game up — have done with it ! It is true that the longing for that lunatic relief is but short ; a brief insanity that leaves her trembling and terror - struck — not at him , but at herself . He has long removed his scrutiny from her face , and has been , for many minutes , re - immersed in his dissection of the bill , before she speaks ; and when she does , it is clear that he has no further insubordination to fear from her . "
158008	158018	158019	158019	I	0	" she says , in a very low voice . "
158024	158038	158019	158019	I	0	" So saying , she rises , and drags herself to the door . "
158062	158070	158071	158071	they	2124	" says her husband , looking up ; "
158092	158116	158071	158071	they	2124	" Having docilely fulfilled this commission , Mrs. Forth once more returns to her grandmother 's sitting - room , and looks in . "
158121	158122	158118	158118	granny	156	" "
158127	158141	158123	158123	She	156	" replies Sarah , from her usual watch - tower , the window . "
158189	158195	158181	158181	I	0	" breaking into a laugh , "
158208	158226	158181	158181	I	0	" Since the coast is clear , Belinda has entered , and sunk inertly into a chair . "
158239	158249	158233	158233	her	156	" resumes Sarah , with an air of impartiality , "
158293	158294	158295	158295	You	2213	" "
158308	158351	158295	158295	You	2213	" replies Belinda ; but , as she speaks , no hot red wave of shame flows this time over her face ; stronger emotions than that which had called it forth have too successfully driven the blood back to her heart ; "
158365	158366	158396	158396	He	2220	" "
158373	158395	158396	158396	He	2220	" cries Sarah , with extreme animation , leaving her post of observation , and hastening to her sister 's side . "
158406	158407	158396	158396	He	2220	" "
158419	158430	158396	158396	He	2220	" says Sarah , in a tone of acute curiosity . "
158480	158481	158485	158485	they	2223	" "
158501	158507	158485	158485	they	2223	" asks Mrs. Forth bitterly . "
158532	158537	158544	158544	he	2220	" with a shrug , "
158551	158552	158544	158544	he	2220	" "
158565	158572	158573	158573	He	2220	" inquires Miss Churchill , puzzled . "
158582	158593	158573	158573	He	2220	" replies Belinda , in a dull , flat voice ; "
158619	158620	158622	158622	you	0	" "
158626	158669	158622	158622	you	0	" ( very sharply , and with an accent of excessive astonishment ) . Her sister 's answer to this simple question seems not at once forthcoming . And when it does come , it is by no means a direct one . "
158672	158693	158694	158694	you	135	" she says slowly , and turning even whiter than she already is — though , indeed , that is scarcely needful—"do
158714	158722	158723	158724	David Rivers	143	taking"—a pause and a sort of gasp — "
158728	158729	158723	158724	David Rivers	143	" "
158735	158741	158723	158724	David Rivers	143	" replies the other drily . "
158743	158752	158755	158755	you	135	why"—Mrs . Forth 's voice has sunk to a whisper—"then
158762	158769	158755	158755	you	135	" Miss Churchill 's eyebrows rise . "
158774	158779	158755	158755	you	135	" she says bluntly , "
158802	158813	158780	158780	you	135	" Belinda 's head has sunk forward upon her chest . "
158822	158827	158829	158829	you	135	" she says faintly , "
158838	158893	158829	158829	you	135	" There is a silence . Sarah has begun to march unquietly up and down the room , with her hands behind her . Perhaps the confession just made her does not partake much of the nature of a surprise . For there is less of astonishment than of genuine concern in her face . "
158899	158904	158895	158895	you	135	" she says abruptly ; "
158914	158920	158921	158921	He	2227	" Belinda 's lip trembles . "
158931	159003	158926	158926	I	0	" Her eyes wander wistfully away through the window to mountain and mere . The high peaks are still withdrawn into the mystery of their morning vapours , but all the lovely lake is at play with the sun . To - morrow , to - morrow , he was to have rowed her on that lake ! Suddenly her attitude of subdued wretchedness changes to one of more violent pain . "
159010	159017	159006	159006	I	0	" she cries , starting up ; "
159064	159065	159066	159066	He	2227	" "
159076	159091	159066	159066	He	2227	" replies Sarah , with cynical good sense . Belinda utters a low groan . "
159098	159099	159066	159066	He	2227	" "
159103	159108	159066	159066	He	2227	" cries Sarah dissuasively : "
159133	159143	159170	159170	he	2227	" says Miss Churchill , with a modest pride , "
159157	159163	159170	159170	he	2227	" Once again Belinda moans . "
159182	159194	159170	159170	he	2227	" — her eyes still taking that miserable farewell journey to the lake—"unless
159206	159207	159195	159195	I	0	" "
159213	159218	159195	159195	I	0	" rejoins Sarah drily ; "
159232	159276	159277	159277	I	0	" A pause . Miss Churchill still pursuing her restless walk , and undistracted even by the strains of the banjo clearly heard from below , and the sound of a male , as well as a female voice , obviously accompanying it . "
159280	159292	159277	159277	I	0	" she says by - and - by , sighing impatiently , "
159345	159346	159347	159347	You	2232	" "
159349	159382	159384	159384	you	2232	" cries Belinda , wheeling suddenly round , a passionate dissent from this proposal in voice and eyes , and with a new rush of her lately dormant old and senseless jealousy ; "
159386	159387	159384	159384	you	2232	" "
159393	159398	159384	159384	you	2232	" asks Sarah quietly . "
159417	159506	159507	159507	You	2232	" At the cool rationality of her sister 's words , Belinda 's rebel blood slowly subsides again , and her head sinks once more upon her breast . How thin these floors are ! One can hear each word of the idiotic melody warbled by Bellairs and the girl in red ; but Miss Churchill never flinches . Belinda is the first to speak , though it is not at once easy to comprehend the drift of her words , so unsure and muffled is her voice . "
159517	159518	159507	159507	You	2232	" "
159527	159537	159520	159520	you	2232	" replies Sarah , with a touch of sarcasm ; "
159567	159568	159560	159560	They	2239	" "
159616	159672	159673	159673	I	0	" The wrench is accomplished . The coach that starts at eleven o'clock has started . Within the close precincts of its interior , it has carried away , among other persons , the cautiously - enveloped figure of Professor Forth ; and among its mackintoshed and umbrellad outside passengers , it reckons his wife . "
159684	159715	159673	159673	I	0	" says Mrs. Churchill , walking briskly back to the fire from the rain - blurred window , whence she has been waving adieux of accented tenderness to her descendants . "
159726	159735	159719	159719	you	0	" asks Sarah caustically . Mrs. Churchill reddens . "
159739	159759	159719	159719	you	0	" says the girl , with an accent of heartfelt compassion , following with her eyes the departing vehicle . "
159770	159779	159765	159765	you	0	" retorts the elder woman , with irritation ; "
159797	159798	159765	159765	you	0	" "
159816	160048	159807	159807	I	0	" replies Sarah surlily . And certainly , on this count , Mrs. Forth , by the time of her arrival at the Lodore Hotel , does deserve as much compassion as she can get . Stiff and drenched , she has climbed down from her perch . Pouring as is the day , the coach has been crowded . Belinda 's ribs on each side feel indented with the continued nudging of her companions ' elbows ; and there has been such a cordial interchange of drips between all the umbrellas , that it would have been a sensibly drier course to have taken no umbrellas at all . Upon the tarpaulin that covers the luggage , lakes of water have collected , which , at each fresh jolt of the coach , discharge themselves refreshingly upon the passengers ' knees . As far as any glimpse of mountain that the blanket - clouds have allowed them to obtain is concerned , they might as well have been in Holland . Dunmail Raise , Skiddaw , Saddleback — what have they been but various names for the one huge white pelt ? It is a grand day for the becks — the foaming , jumping , brimful becks , and they are the only cheerful things she has seen ; they , and the long lythrums growing lushly beside them . "
160058	160083	160085	160085	you	2250	" says Professor Forth , emerging , dry and warm , from the steaming interior , and severely regarding his half - drowned wife ; "
160090	160091	160085	160085	you	2250	" "
160097	160103	160085	160085	you	2250	" she interrupts , apathetically ; "
160122	160123	160124	160124	You	2250	" "
160134	160153	160124	160124	You	2250	" scrutinizing her shivering figure with an angry solicitude that might appear the outcome of an anxious affection ; "
160201	160202	160203	160203	I	0	" "
160209	160688	160203	160203	I	0	" she answers faintly , but she obeys with a dull acquiescence . There is no draught he could offer her , from Socrates ' hemlock upwards or down - wards , that she would not think it less trouble to take than to refuse . The rain pours on and on , all through the table - d'hôte , all through the long , long evening . There is a public drawing - room to which , after dinner , the other guests betake themselves , shawl - wrapped , grumbling , and uttering aspirations for a fire . Belinda has not the heart to accompany them . She climbs the stairs to her bedroom in the roof , although at eight o'clock it is scarcely possible to go to bed . No sense , indeed , of the prematureness of the hour prevents her flying to the blessed keeping of sleep ; but the knowledge that whatever moments are filched from consciousness now , will be asked back with usury in the grey morning hours — those grim , grey hours that only the tiny minority of the quite happy and the completely innocent dare face . Her window is open , and looks to the back ; to the wooded hill rising so immediately behind the house that it seems as if , with outstretched hand , one might touch it . The rain swishes past : now and then , when the freakish gust takes it , swishes in . She sits down on her bed and listens to it . For two hours she will listen to its swishing ; and then , perhaps , she may dare give herself — tired body and sick heart — to slumber . With the rain mixes the never - ceasing noise of the waterfall . On a sultry summer night no doubt it is sweet and lulling , falling coolly beneath the stars ; but it seems to treble , to centuple the dreariness of this inclement drenching evening , cold as winter , and without winter 's palliatives of thick curtains and blazing logs . It gets upon her nerves at last . It seems as if she must stop it for one instant or die . If its wet din would fill her brain , indeed , as it fills her ears , crowding out other presences , she would thank it , and bless it on her knees ; but , on the contrary , its clamour seems to make thought sharper , memory intenser , fancy wilder . With what a dreadful liveliness does she rehearse — set to the murderous monotony of its tune — the scene of Rivers ' back - coming to - morrow ! It grows at last so hideously real that she asks herself in bewilderment , "
160700	160752	160695	160695	she	2253	" She passes her hand across her forehead and rubs her eyes . In what room of the hotel — in which often - trodden spot by wave - lipped mere will the blow fell him ? How will he take it ? Will it kill him ? She laughs aloud . "
160777	160983	160773	160773	she	135	" This Sarah has never told her . How much of this slow death ? A great , great deal ! Was ever anyone so full of obstinate life as she ? Other women — women who prayed to live , women with little children 's chubby arms about their necks , with passionate , fond husbands , wetting their faint hands with good - bye tears — would have died of such an illness as hers . She , childless , hated and hating , has survived . A sense of impotent , dark rebellion fills her soul . Of what use to save her alive ? What sense in it ? To save her alive in order to show her just one small glimpse of what life might have been , and then to hurl her back into what life is ! What life might have been ! Oh , the terrible vividness of that vision ! She has fallen sideways upon her bed , which , as well as her whole body , is shaken with the force of her silent sobs . They must be silent , for the walls are thin , and her husband 's attic is next door . "
160993	161004	160773	160773	she	135	" she says , with a violent agony of emphasis , "
161073	161289	161290	161290	I	0	" After that , she lies quite still , a sort of numb calm succeeding the hurricane , and outside the rain swirls always , and the waterfall tumbles . There must be more of soothing properties in their joint sound than she gives them credit for , since by - and - by their sullen music grows dim in her ears , and she sleeps . She awakes in the early morning , forlorn and cold , to find that she has lain all night fully dressed , outside her bed . She is down in good time , and stands outside the hall - door , waiting for breakfast to be announced . The rain has ceased . The wind has torn and hurled the clouds apart , and let the sun look through ; and also swept clear little intensely blue islands in the sky . The shadows are flying , speedy as dreams , along Skiddaw 's flanks , and Derwentwater lies — all billowy and disturbed — at the foot of her girdling fells . On the bit of marshy grass that intervenes between Belinda and the lake , several horses are grazing , and two rolling . One can not roll quite over , which seems to annoy him . "
161305	161316	161290	161290	I	0	" says a voice at her elbow . She starts . "
161325	161333	161290	161290	I	0	" she answers , with a shrug . "
161338	161344	161290	161290	I	0	" says her husband stiffly , "
161394	161453	161454	161454	I	0	" Belinda smiles slightly . She is well aware that it is only the presence of her grandomother and Sarah that has , up to this time , prevented the pack - saddle from being replaced upon her back . It is being now , at the earliest opportunity , strapped on again . Well , what matter ? "
161460	161465	161458	161458	you	0	" she answers hastily . "
161484	161492	161458	161458	you	0	" catching her breath in a sigh , "
161501	161516	161517	161517	I	0	" But people 's ideas as to what a little work is , differ . "
161523	161555	161521	161521	you	0	" says the Professor , when , after the table - d'hôte breakfast , he and she have mounted to his bedroom , which , as at Lowood , is also his study—"indeed
161628	162021	162022	162022	I	0	" As he speaks , he places before her a large pile of docketed letters . If any dismay at its height and breadth enters her soul , she swallows it down in silence . The sun comes forth in summer strength , but though the room is not a tenth part as large as the Professor 's Oxbridge study , the window is as rigorously closed as ever it was there . The garret , like her own , looks to the back , and in it there is no escape from the waterfall 's loud pouring . She is still teased by that maniac notion that she must make it stop or die . Unused , for the past couple of months , to close air , to confinement , to toil , her head soon begins to ache , sometimes swims , burns always , but she makes no complaint . The clock strikes one ; she hears cheerful voices , and steps trooping down the passage outside to luncheon . The Professor is no great advocate of luncheon , even when he can eat it at some one else 's expense ; at an hotel he simply ignores the possibility of its existence . But she can not complain . He is willing to share with her such hospitality as he extends to himself . Biscuits bought at a shop in Ambleside , so that there may be no danger of their figuring in the hotel bill , and weak brandy - and - water — the brandy also his own . She declines the brandy , would fain decline the biscuits too ; to eat in such an air , and with such a heavy head , seems impossible , but she dreads being scolded for her sickliness if she refuse . Two o'clock strikes ! Three ! Halfpast three ! Four ! Even now her pile seems scarce perceptibly diminished . Two or three times she has been thrown back , by having to draw up a fresh draft , her muddled brain and wandering thoughts having led her to mistake the sense of his directions . Hopeless tears fill her eyes , as she tears across each sheet and begins another . As the clock strikes four , the pen drops from her numbed fingers . "
162029	162034	162024	162024	you	2258	" she says faintly . "
162045	162046	162035	162035	I	0	" "
162050	162055	162035	162035	I	0	" returns he sharply ; "
162072	162073	162024	162024	you	2258	" "
162077	162094	162024	162024	you	2258	" replies she , laughing hysterically , and pressing her hot hands to her throbbing forehead . "
162131	162132	162125	162125	I	0	" "
162135	162140	162125	162125	I	0	" he cries angrily ; "
162156	162157	162158	162158	I	0	" "
162162	162167	162158	162158	I	0	" assents she dully . "
162174	162175	162171	162171	I	0	" "
162181	162196	162178	162178	you	0	" retorts he waspishly , and regarding with a dissatisfied air her uncompleted task . "
162228	162426	162427	162427	You	2259	" She is very willing to buy her liberty at the price of this most unnecessary promise . At what price would not she buy air , the liberty to gasp , the privilege — beyond all value — of being alone ? Without much thought , she has taken , on leaving the hotel , the Borrowdale road , walks along it for some distance , confused and woolly - headed , conscious only of the relief of having temporarily escaped from suffocation — from the waterfall — from him ! But by - and - by the loveliness around her wakes her again — wakes her to new and keener sufferings . She is aware of the road that winds in gentle companionship with the windings of the Derwent ; she is aware of the marvellous coloured water , tinted a strange fair green by the stones in its bed , and clear as the crystal stream in the Apocalypse . Above , the great crags rear their steepy heads ; the Castle Crag that , at one point , seems to block the valley , guarding hid treasures behind it , and saying austerely , "
162433	163346	163347	163347	You	2260	" the Gate Crag , that looks down , benignant though awful , on the prattle of the river curling round its feet , looks down with its solemn purplegrey rock - shelves and sheer slopes of slate . As she nears a village , she turns off a road to the left , and begins to climb the hill . She proposes to herself no goal . She does not know where she is , or whither she is going . She only knows that each step takes her farther from the waterfall , and from him . Climbing , climbing , climbing , through a wood , up a mountain path , until at length , panting , she attains the hill - crest , and turning , looks back upon all the beauty and majesty of Borrowdale . But even here she only halts to cast one breathless glance at the great hills , thrown about as if in Titan play , and looking over each other 's shoulders , silent , wondrously - coloured , august ! She is not far away enough , even yet . With knees that tremble and give beneath her — for she has been but little used to such a walk — a walk undertaken , too , almost fasting — she descends the hill on the other side ; and at its foot finds a most lonely tarn , here , in the heart of the fells . A little ale - house , lonely too , sits near it , backed by three or four storm - wrecked Scotch firs ; and around , the fells lift their harsh faces , scored by the channels of their winter weepings . She asks the stout housewife at the little innfor a drink of milk ; but she does not inquire where she is , nor in which direction Lodore lies . She would far rather not know . She has lost her way , and will be late for the table - d'hôte ! Well ? He will be imagining that she has contracted some new and expensive chill ! Well ? She may go astray upon the mountains , and perish like the sheep in winter ! Well ? The milk has a little revived her flagging powers ; and she walks on again . Whither ? She neither knows nor cares . She only knows that she is among friends — among the stern , yet summer - softened hills that lend her the sympathy of their silence ; among the crisp and frolic mountain airs , and the beds of bog - myrtle that smells of bay - leaves ; while — friendliest of all — blithe comforter and comrade — a mountain beck tinkles , a hand - breadth off , beside her . But there is a limit even to the sustaining powers of a cup of milk ; and by - and - by she sinks down , faint and spent , by that flower - lipped brook , upon the dainty bed of ferns and sundews with which it is set round . Why should she ever move hence again ? What inducement is there to her ever again to lift up her tired limbs and leave the mute society of these bald limestone crags and steeps of shingle and flint ? Whither could she go to better herself ? In what direction on earth 's broad face does any good for her lie ? Why should not she lie down and die here ? Die ! But is it such an easy thing to die ? Has not she already tried hard and failed ? Oh , if she could but gently depart here now ! Surely no one could ever wish for a sweeter , fragranter death - bed ! She stretches herself back upon the bog - myrtle and sundews , and closes her eyes , trying to fancy that it is over , and that she is dead . Oh , if she might but be gently spunged out of being ! It seems such a small thing to ask , and yet she might as well bid the mountains bow down and the sun make obeisance to her . She asks for no other life instead . Has her experience of this one been so pleasant that she is greedy for more ? If there be another world , what security is there that it is a better one ? May not it resemble this ? the same long hopes that go gradually , sickeningly out ; the same poniardstabs of recollection thrusting one through in the hour of the uncoloured dawn ; the same tiny , weakling joys ! She has raised herself from her recumbent attitude , and her head is bowed forwards upon her knees , which her long arms embrace . Neither by death nor by life is there any escape for her ! But there is a mode of outlet for her nearer at hand than she wots of . It is noiseless walking upon the fine mountain herbage ; there the heaviest foot falls mutely — so noiseless that until he who has been approaching her stoops and most gently touches her on the shoulder , she is unaware that anyone is nigh . She springs up staggeringly , with a loud cry . "
163349	163350	163353	163353	I	0	" "
163355	163390	163394	163394	Sarah	135	" It seems as if she had spent all her breath on that one monosyllable , since , for a while , nothing more comes ; then , at last , a gasping whisper : "
163399	163400	163403	163403	she	135	" "
163407	163432	163403	163403	she	135	" Her breath comes hard and laboured . How is it possible to interpose any words between such heart - beats ? At last : "
163446	163451	163452	163452	you	2260	" she says slowly ; "
163471	163494	163467	163467	I	0	" He offers no exculpation . He only stands doggedly before her , white and burning - eyed , but not trembling . "
163501	163509	163467	163467	I	0	" she says , with that same slow intensity—"this
163524	163536	163537	163537	I	0	" His lips twitch , but his eyes are still dogged . "
163553	163620	163621	163621	I	0	" She looks distractedly round at her silent friends — the scarped slopes , where the lady - birch finds difficult footing , but yet keeps her place , and hangs her delicate tresses : in her sore need she consults the beck , but the hills are speechless ; and though the beck talks fast , she can not distinguish the meaning of its words . "
163638	163678	163634	163634	you	2260	" Her look still wanders wildly ; and her ear detects the sound of a little oozing runlet , lost hitherto in the noise of its elder brother ; a runlet filtering through the red moss on the hillside . "
163688	163794	163634	163634	you	2260	" His voice , that hitherto her lightest word has awed into silence , presses , imperatively asking , upon her hearing . ( Which shall it be ? Which ? which ? ) Oh , if some one would but answer for her ! If mountain or runlet would but take the responsibility of that one all - weighty word off her ? Go ? Leave her to drag her tired limbs back into that bondage which seems already to have endured for centuries ? and for a limit to whose mean and sordid sufferings eye and heart consult the long future in vain . "
163804	163836	163634	163634	you	2260	" Hideous future ! Hideous past ! Hideous present ! She has given it a fair trial . No one can say that she has not given it a fair trial . "
163839	163887	163634	163634	you	2260	" And she has broken down ; mind and body her tyrant has broken her down . He will break her down again if she give him the chance . Why should she ? It has been his turn hitherto ! Let it be hers now ! d "
163890	163904	163634	163634	you	2260	" His voice is no longer dogged ; heart - rendingly urgent only . "
163907	163924	163634	163634	you	2260	" He has taken her hand , and has laid its palm upon his burning eyes . "
163934	163976	163634	163634	you	2260	" Her look , staring yet unseeing , is fixed upon the little zigzag green paths on the fell , worn by the small feet of the mountain sheep . Not a bird 's voice breaks the silence of the hills . "
163985	164077	164082	164082	you	2263	" she says , almost inaudibly . Before his eyes the sun dances , and the steady hills go round . Yet , mixed with a joy so awful and utter that his whole strong frame reels beneath its weight , there comes too a pain keen to agony . He has prevailed . His high goddess has fallen from her pedestal , and it is he that has dragged her down ! Her divine fair head lies in the dust , and it is he that has laid it there ! "
164086	164094	164079	164079	you	2263	" he cries , in suffocating excitement . "
164165	164181	164160	164160	you	2263	" She draws a long heavy breath , as one recovering from a deep swoon . "
164184	164203	164160	164160	you	2263	" she answers , whispering ; and so breaks into an exceeding bitter cry of anguish and revolt : "
164212	164292	164160	164160	you	2263	" Then , indeed , the pain goes , swallowed up and stifled in the enormity of his gladness . He knows that hereafter it will return , but now he is only , only glad ! Great God ! how glad ! He has thrown himself down before her , and is kissing her tired feet , and clasping her knees . But when he seeks to gather her into his arms , she pushes him convulsively away . "
164297	164302	164364	164364	you	0	" she says wildly ; "
164306	164307	164364	164364	you	0	" "
164310	164321	164322	164322	you	2263	" he cries , with a hideous revulsion of feeling ; "
164336	164337	164330	164330	you	2263	" "
164342	164353	164355	164355	you	0	" she says , with a heart - broken smile ; "
164376	164414	164367	164367	I	0	" Her voice dies away , and her head sinks on her breast . His high Queen ! Already she looks discrowned and dissceptred . By - and - by she lifts her haggard face and speaks . "
164421	164511	164367	164367	I	0	" she says dully . He complies in silence , and they set out . Before they have gone far , one of those swift changes , so common in mountain weather , has sent a sharp storm driving in their faces . She is unprovided with umbrella or mackintosh , and the large drops soon saturate her light gown . He puts his arm in anxious protection round her . Her first impulse is to shrink away from him ; but , bethinking herself , she tamely submits . "
164527	164855	164520	164520	I	0	" It is evening . Professor Forth 's chilliness has for once vanquished his parsimony ; and in the grate of his attic room , a small , carefully - nursed , never - poked fire burns sparingly cheerful . But he cowers over it , and stretches his hand to its frugal blaze alone . One would have thought that such a walk as that undertaken by Mrs. Forth would have been enough to satisfy the energies of any reasonable woman ; and yet she is again out of doors . She is not walking , indeed ; she is standing upon the rustic bridge that leads to wood and waterfall ; standing there in the soft dusk — not alone ! They have passed the windows of the garishly - lit public drawing - room , where lamps and jets of gas are making a gaudy glare ; a heterogeneous assemblage of people , forced into unnatural sociability , irksomely driving through an evening in common . Some are working ; some are playing whist ; some are yawning ; one is feebly singing ; and all are in the fullest blaze of the gas and the paraffin . How much better to be outside in the moist , sweet dark ! His arms are about her , she no longer resisting ; and her tired head is resting on his shoulder . Henceforth she will always have that shoulder on which to lay down her head . What matter , wading through what waters she has reached its refuge ? A throb of mad , reckless joy thrills through all her uneasy body . Since she is to pay the price — and such a price!—let her at least have some joy to show for it ! Oh , if it were but all right!—all on the straight ! — what could heaven do better than this ? Ay ! but the might of that "
164857	164859	164946	164946	her	2267	" ! "
164865	164870	164871	164871	you	2266	" she says sighingly ; "

164886	164898	164883	164883	I	0	" he answers , in a tone as grudging as hers ; "
164907	164942	164943	164943	She	2267	are"—hesitating—"there are arrangements to be made — that I must make personally — that could not be done by writing ; and I must also go to Milnthorpe , to see about my work . "
164949	164963	164964	164964	she	2267	" It — this — will not make any difference to your work ? "
164976	164986	164964	164964	she	2267	" it — it will not injure your prospects ? "
164987	164996	164997	164997	he	2266	" Of course not ; of course not ! "
165007	165040	164997	164997	he	2266	" why should it ? what connection is there between a man 's private life and his business relations ? What concern is it of theirs whether or not I — I — "
165041	165051	165052	165052	she	2267	" You run away with your neighbour 's wife , "
165066	165092	165052	165052	she	2267	" why do not you speak out ? if a thing is not too bad to do , it is not too bad to say ! "
165247	165255	165256	165256	she	2267	" You will not be long away ? "
165264	165283	165256	165256	she	2267	" you will not leave me long alone ? you will come back as soon as you can ? "
165284	165291	165297	165297	his	2266	" Need you tell me that ? "
165356	165368	165369	165369	she	2267	" You will not despise me more than you can help ? "
165388	165413	165369	165369	she	2267	" Of course you must despise me ; but you will try and hide it as well as you can , will not you ? "
165443	165453	165454	165454	she	2267	" How am I to get through these days ? "
165461	165517	165454	165454	she	2267	" oh , come quickly back ! come quick ! quick ! How am I to look him in the face without telling him what I am planning against him ? if he says one kind word to me , it will be the death of me ! Happily for me , he never does ! "
165561	165575	165576	165576	she	2267	" I shall be always fancying that you are growing tired of me , "
165590	165641	165576	165576	she	2267	" promise not to grow tired of me ! promise ! Remember that I shall have nothing — nothing but you in the whole wide world ; and that when you are gone from me , everything will be gone ! But what is the use of making you promise ? "
165649	165677	165678	165678	She	2267	" how can you help it ? If you grow tired of me , you will grow tired ; and there will be an end of it ! "
165715	165722	165723	165723	he	2271	" When you say such things , "
165727	165760	165723	165723	he	2271	" you make me feel as if my senses were gone ! I grow tired of you ! I ! I ! Oh , my love , my lady , my Queen ! "
165792	165851	165852	165852	He	2271	" if you knew how I am eating my heart out with the thought that you may grow tired of me ! that you may find out I am not worthy of the sacrifice you are making for me!—that I , only I ! — oh my poor love ! my poor love!—may not be enough for you ! "
165909	165912	165913	165913	she	2272	" Yes ! "
165916	165922	165913	165913	she	2272	" you will be enough ! "
166069	166078	166079	166079	she	2272	" How am I to live through them ? "
166140	166147	166148	166148	he	2271	" What are you looking at ? "
166157	166168	166151	166151	She	2272	" I — I — am looking at the rain ! "
166169	166182	166184	166184	he	2271	" I hope that you will content yourself with looking at it , "
166187	166220	166184	166184	he	2271	" I must exact a promise from you that you will not , by exposing yourself to it , incur the danger of that relapse with which you were obviously threatened yesterday . "
166221	166225	166226	166226	she	2272	" I promise , "
166269	166277	166278	166278	she	2272	" But I shall have no temptation , "
166282	166311	166278	166278	she	2272	" I want to work to - day : I am up to a great deal of work . You need not be afraid of overworking me today ! "
166398	166405	166406	166406	he	2271	" Your writing has become unsteady , "
166415	166435	166406	166406	he	2271	" I presume that your hand is growing tired . Perhaps we had better desist until to - morrow . "
166436	166441	166442	166442	she	2272	" No ! no ! "
166446	166469	166442	166442	she	2272	" why should we ? I am not at all tired ! it was only carelessness . I will take more pains . "
166470	166481	166482	166482	he	2271	" You are unable any longer to concentrate your attention , "
166489	166498	166482	166482	he	2271	" you have omitted two most important words . "
166499	166503	166504	166504	she	2272	" Have I ? "
166508	166533	166504	166504	she	2272	" but indeed I am not tired ! I had much rather go on ; there — there is no time like the present ! "
166534	166539	166540	166540	he	2271	" To - morrow , "
166548	166553	166554	166554	she	2272	" To - morrow ! "
166558	166577	166554	166554	she	2272	" who knows what may happen to - morrow ? We may both be dead to - morrow ! "
166586	166589	166590	166590	he	2271	" Psha ! "
166594	166605	166590	166590	he	2271	" what is the use of indulging in puerile suppositions ? "
167072	167106	167067	167067	she	2272	" Is he quite the same ? Is he quite as glad to see me as he used to be ? Does he call me his darling quite as often as he did ? "
167454	167459	167460	167460	he	3353	" You look feverish , "
167509	167517	167519	167519	he	3353	" What the deuce are you about ? "
167552	167566	167519	167519	he	3353	" You have let fall a great blot of ink upon Gregory Nazianzen ! "
167593	167599	167600	167600	she	2272	" I beg your pardon , "
167605	167624	167600	167600	she	2272	" I — I had dropped something . I — I — was going to look for it ! "
168075	168085	168086	168086	she	2316	" Why will you never speak to us now ? "
168094	168099	168086	168086	she	2316	" I am afraid , "
168104	168155	168086	168086	she	2316	" that you must think that there is something wrong about us ; that we have run away , perhaps , and are not married ! Mamma met some people like that at Spa last year ; it was so awkward , for she had made quite friends with them ! "
168362	168372	168333	168333	him	3353	" I have come to say good - night . "
168373	168381	168393	168393	he	3353	" Have you ? Good - night . "
168434	168440	168441	168441	she	2316	" You are not ill ? "
168446	168456	168458	168458	he	3353	" According to you , I am never ill , "
168461	168486	168458	168458	he	3353	" I enjoy the most robust health ; if I were to tell you that I were ill , you would discredit the assertion ! "
168487	168495	168496	168496	she	2316	" Oh , but I should not , "
168500	168524	168496	168496	she	2316	" I quite believe that you often , often suffer . Is there — is there — nothing I can do for you ? "
168525	168532	168534	168534	he	3353	" You can shut the door , "
168540	168586	168534	168534	he	3353	" a thing that , since the beginning of my acquaintance with you , I have never known you do ! and since it is already past my usual hour for retiring to bed , I will ask you to shut it upon the outside ! "
168878	168906	168907	168907	Belinda	134	" I am going to leave you for always . You can not think that I have been a worse wife to you than I think myself . "
168909	169519	168907	168907	Belinda	134	" To have toiled all night for such an outcome ! She walks to the window , feeling stiff and chilled . The morning is bringing all night 's secrets to light . Again the wooded hill rises a hand - breadth off ; the little patch of sky that it allows her to see is putting on day 's blue livery . Well , then , it has come ! There is no going back now ! no more shilly - shallying ! There is nothing for it but to make the best of it ! She has turned from the window , and accidentally faced herself in the glass . What a spectacle ! What heavy smouches under the eyes ! What baked white lips ! But in her face , is there something else , too ? something new and unqualifiable ? Is it already beginning to assume that pitiful , brazen look , that women such as she wear ? Well , if it is , what wonder ? If it is , there is no help for it ! The time is so short — so short now ! Surely for that short time she can manage to keep thought at bay ? She moves noiselessly about , busying herself with this and that . She takes off her wedding - ring , and making it and the few paltry trinkets that her husband has ever given her into a small packet , directs and places them beside the letter ; then she tries to ruffle her bed , and give it a lately occupied air : no easy task , for a bed that has not been slept in will not look like one that has . Then she undresses ; and by - and - by , when her hot water is brought , makes her toilet afresh , having first placed letter and parcel in a conspicuous situation upon the chest of drawers which serves as dressing - table , and goes downstairs . How near the time is now ! She refers , for the hundredth time , to the paper of directions left with her by Rivers . At such an hour she is to set off . It is within five minutes of that hour . She has ordered over - night a carriage to convey her . It is true that an omnibus plies between hotel and station , but from its publicity she shrinks with unconquerable aversion . It will be full of people . They will be talking and laughing . They will talk to her ; perhaps — quite as likely as not — they will ask her where she is going ! So she has ordered an open fly for herself . It shall be no expense to Professor Forth . She can easily return him by post the money for it . Yes ; but whose money ? A scorching blush burns cheek and brow , and she covers her miserable face with her hands . It is three minutes past the appointed hour , and the carriage is not yet here . Perhaps there has been some mistake ! Perhaps it was never ordered ! But no sooner has this sickly hope — that is scarcely a hope either — flared up in her mind , than it is extinguished again . For an open fly comes rolling briskly up to the door . Perhaps it may not be hers . Other people order flys too . Perhaps it may be for some one else . But this delusion also dies . "
169527	169535	168907	168907	Belinda	134	" says a waiter , approaching her . "
169544	169549	169537	169537	you	2325	" she asks huskily . "
169569	169570	169537	169537	you	2325	" "
169578	169595	169537	169537	you	2325	" There is nothing for it but to get in . As she takes her seat : "
169609	169644	169597	169597	you	1629	" asks the waiter innocently . In an instant all the truant blood has poured back into her snow - white face . Does he suspect her ? Has he asked her on purpose ? "
169647	169653	169597	169597	you	1629	" she answers almost inaudibly — "
169661	169911	169912	169912	I	0	" And now she is off ! The die is cast ! Nothing has happened to prevent her . To the last moment she has dimly believed that something would happen to prevent her . But no ! nothing has ! No fire has fallen from heaven to consume her ! No accident has occurred to hinder her ! By what small accidents — happening at the last moment — have other people been saved ! No accident comes to save her ! Neither God nor man cares what becomes of her ! The morning is lovely , with morning 's fresh look of newness , as if the ancient hills had but just been turned out of their Maker 's workshop . Lapis - blue is the lake , as a summer lake should be ; and with its little islands laughing in summer forest - green upon its radiant lap . Over one mountain shoulder , indeed , a few slight cloud - shadows , thrown light as gauzy scarves , still lie . But on his brothers ' granite knees there is strong resolute sunshine , and in their ravines shadows cut hard and black . Oh , cruel world ! Again you are jeering her with you beauty ! Her eyes roll wildly round , and thought after thought courses with mad rapidity through her head . Little irrelevant incidents out of far - away childhood , fragments of forgotten books , texts of Scripture . "
169924	170140	169912	169912	I	0	" That is what teases her most . And yet what applicability is there in it to her ? Does any help come from the hills to her ? Beneath the trees that lip the lake , and through whose leafage come ever glimpses of its dazzling gaiety , the sweet road winds . Along it some of the inmates of the hotel are leisurely walking , and , as she passes , look up to nod and smile at her . Would they nod and smile at her did they know whither and on what errand she is bent ? What right has she to leave them under such a delusion ? She must undeceive them . So distraught is her brain that she leans out of the carriage to accomplish this lunatic purpose , but they are already left behind . How fast the driver drives ! Why does he drive so fast ? She calls out to him to go slower ; and then , with a new and contradictory longing that it should be over , should be irrevocable , bids him drive faster again . And still , numberless as sand - grains , quicker than lightning , the thoughts rush through her head . It is a sentence out of "
170143	170155	169912	169912	I	0	" now that is beating and hammering in her brain ; a "
170158	170178	170559	170559	ma'am	1629	" casually left behind by some stray guest at the hotel , and as casually opened by her yesterday . "
170192	170411	169912	169912	I	0	" Why should it buzz in her ears ? What has it to say to her ? How short the drive is ! The roofs of Keswick are already in sight . That was a short drive , too — the drive to church on her marriage morning . With what dreadful vividness does it now return in each detail of its pinched and icy misery upon her memory ; she sitting there in dead despairing obstinacy , and Sarah sobbing beside her , telling her that it was not too late ! Sarah was right . It was not too late then . If Sarah were here now , would she still tell her that it is not too late ? Oh , why is not she here then ? At every step of the road her agony heightens , and a cold sweat stands on her forehead . It is not too late ! It is not too late ! This is written in letters of fire all over the mountains ; all over the lapis lake and sapphire sky . It is not too late ! How plainly she can read the words ! They are taking the character of a command ! It is not too late ! Dare she disobey such a mandate ? "
170414	170453	169912	169912	I	0	" she cries , standing up suddenly , like one possessed . But her emotion is so overpowering , and her throat so dry , that no sound issues from it . The horse still trots rapidly on . "
170456	170476	169912	169912	I	0	" she repeats , but once again her disobedient organs play her false , and the horse trots on . "
170479	170502	169912	169912	I	0	" she cries frantically , a third time ; and now , at last , the coachman hears , and pulls up . "
170506	170515	170559	170559	ma'am	1629	" she says hoarsely , and almost unintelligibly ; "
170522	170543	170545	170545	I	0	" then , becoming aware , though sight is dim and head giddy , of the unbounded astonishment depicted on his face—"I
170551	170552	170553	170553	We	2331	" "
170561	170568	170559	170559	ma'am	1629	" he answers , civilly demurring ; "
170579	170580	170559	170559	ma'am	1629	" "
170584	170690	170559	170559	ma'am	1629	" she repeats , huskily ; and then , indeed , wondering , he obeys . She sinks back , and covers her face with her hands . What has she done ? She forbids herself to ask or think . But has she done it in vain ? If , during her absence , her letter has been discovered , she will have returned in vain . Even if it has not been already discovered , every minute that passes lessens its chance of escape . At this very moment it may be being found , and she will have turned back in vain . "
170696	170701	170559	170559	ma'am	1629	" she cries harshly ; "
170707	171221	170559	170559	ma'am	1629	" How could she ever have thought the distance short ? It is immeasurably , unbelievably long ! The hotel is in sight ! A few people are standing about the door . Have they heard ? Are they talking about it ? The fly has stopped . Is she in time ? It seems as if there were an ominous silence about the idlers hanging round . Have they heard ? She dare not look the waiter , who comes to help her out , in the face . She staggers past him into the hall ; then , by a tremendous effort , steadying herself , she rushes upstairs . Is she in time ? Flight after flight she mounts , with that question surging in her ears . She has reached her room — has burst into it . Is she in time ? One glance gives her the answer . Yes , she is ! Undisturbed , exactly as she had left them upon the top of the chest of drawers , lie letter and packet . She is in time ! Oh , the relief of that thought ! And yet , so complicatedly contradictory are we , that , at the sight so madly desired , a distinct pang of disappointment crosses her heart . Had the letter been discovered , there would have been the one and only refuge left her , and no one could then have blamed her for availing herself of it . She starts , shuddering at herself . Is she already repenting of her repentance ? What security has she that she may not again go back from it ? Within her there is none ; if there is a security for her , it must be one outside her . She has taken the letter into her hand , and stands for a few moments motionless ; a desperate determination gaining strength in her heart , and painting itself on her haggard yet resolute face . Since the letter has not yet been delivered to him , she herself will deliver it . She will tell him under what circumstances it was written . This shall be her expiation . Without giving herself time for hesitation , she moves quickly out of the room , and knocks at her husband 's door . There is no answer , and she knocks again . Still no reply . Perhaps , though it is not likely , he may be out . So she enters . No , he is in his usual seat , by his improvised writing - table . He could not have heard . His attitude is not quite his usual one , for he is apparently unoccupied , leaning back in his chair , and with his head bent a little forwards on his chest . He must be thinking , and will probably chide her for disturbing him . Well , it can not be helped . Heaven knows he has cause enough to chide her ! "
