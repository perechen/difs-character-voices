' I thought you 'd like to see it . Well , Rachel , and how are you getting on ? Mrs. James 's dress do n't fit her a bit , and she says she 'll not give you another stitch of work : but la ! you do n't care — do you ? Why , Mary , how yellow you look to day . I declare you 're as yellow as the crocuses in the pot . Ai n't she now , Jane ? And so you 're not married yet — are you , my girl ? "
2572	2584	2585	2585	she	183	" You 'd better not do that again , Mrs. Brown , "
2592	2608	2585	2585	she	183	" and as to getting married : why , s'pose you mind your own business ! "

2721	2773	2716	2716	she	32	" where 's the use of always raking up them sort of things ! The badness of others do n't make us good — does it ? It 's the taxes I think of , Mrs. Brown ; it 's the taxes ! Now , Rachel , where are you going ? "

2992	3002	3003	3003	she	21	" I wonder people do not like this street , "
3024	3040	3003	3003	she	21	" They call it dull , and to me it is so calm and sweet . "
3385	3391	3392	3392	she	35	" Now , Miss Gray , "
3399	3435	3392	3392	she	35	" what do you mean by bringing back work in this style ? That flounce is at least an inch too high ! I thought you an intelligent young person — but really , really ! "
3436	3445	3447	3447	Rachel	21	" It 's very easily altered , ma'am , "

3634	3638	3639	3639	she	21	" What matter ! "
3642	3681	3682	3682	she	21	" even though a man in livery made a jest of me — even though a lady in silk was scornful . What matter ! God made that star for me as well as for her ! Besides , "
3698	3713	3682	3682	she	21	" besides , who , and what am I , that I should repine ? "
3894	3898	3899	3899	she	21	" Poor things ! "
3902	3909	3899	3899	she	21	" if they only knew better . "

4088	4100	4082	4082	she	21	" and what can happen to me without God 's will ? "
4127	4139	4124	4124	she	21	" You have drunk too much already ; let me go . "
4140	4146	4153	4153	she	21	" No I wo n't , "

4239	4261	4235	4235	she	245	" You 'd better cut now — I'll hold her . Molly 's awful when she 's got them fits on . "
4385	4392	4393	4393	she	21	" Ah ! dear Lord Jesus , "
4400	4415	4393	4393	she	21	" that thou shouldst thus be crucified anew by the sins of thy people ! "
4423	4433	4393	4393	she	21	" Oh ! why is there so much sin ? "
4434	4439	4452	4452	Rachel	21	" God knows best , "
4907	4916	4917	4917	she	21	" Oh ! my father , my father ! "
4923	4959	4917	4917	she	21	" why must I stand here in darkness looking at you ? why can not I go in to you , like other daughters to their father ? why do you not love your child ? "
5959	5965	6011	6011	her	22	" seen no more below , "

7213	7240	7242	7243	Mrs. Gray	22	" Then better have sat at home and finished it , than have gone gadding about , and nearly got a pitch plaster on your mouth , "
7267	7278	7279	7279	she	22	" Mind you do n't set the house a fire , "
7284	7289	7291	7291	Rachel	21	" Why , mother , "
7295	7310	7291	7291	Rachel	21	" you treat me like a child , and I am twenty - six . "
7311	7328	7329	7329	Rachel	21	" What about that ? when you ai nt got no more sense than a baby . "
7627	7631	7633	7633	Rachel	21	" Who knows , "
7635	7690	7633	7633	Rachel	21	" but he will return some day ? Who knows — who can tell ? Life is long , and hope is eternal . Ah ! if he should come back , even though he never looked at me , never spoke , blessed , thrice blessed , should ever be held the day … "

8069	8072	8074	8074	Rachel	21	" Mother , "
8082	8092	8074	8074	Rachel	21	" was it you who called me , Rachel ? "
8093	8107	8109	8110	Mrs. Gray	22	" Why ai nt I been a calling of you this last hour ? "
8124	8133	8135	8136	Mrs. Gray	22	" Get up Jane — get up Mary , "
8149	8161	8163	8163	Rachel	21	" Let them sleep a little longer , poor young things ! "

10996	11033	11046	11046	she	21	" I was naked , and ye clothed me ; I was hungry , and ye fed me : athirst , and ye gave me drink ; and I was houseless , and you sheltered me . "
11726	11738	11744	11745	Mrs. Gray	22	" Now , Rachel , what are you doing up there ? "
11754	11762	11744	11745	Mrs. Gray	22	" moping , as usual ! Eh ? "
11877	11888	11890	11891	Mrs. Brown	32	" La ! but did n't I always say so ? "
11899	11912	11915	11916	Mrs. Gray	22	" I could n't have believed it , that I could n't ! "
11918	11930	11915	11916	Mrs. Gray	22	" La , bless you , Mrs. Gray ! I could , "
11950	11956	11957	11957	she	27	" I never liked her , "
11966	11971	11957	11957	she	27	" Who is she ? "
11984	11991	11994	11994	Jane	27	" Never you mind , Miss , "
11996	12004	11994	11994	Jane	27	" Just stitch on , will you ? "

12027	12121	12022	12022	she	32	" Serve her right — the set up thing ! Oh ! there 's Rachel . Lawk , Rachel ! what a pity you ai n't been here ! You never heard such a story as has come out about that little staymaker , Humpy , as I call her . Why , she 's been a making love to — la ! but I ca n't help laughing , when I think of it ; and it 's all true , every word of it ; ai nt it , Mrs. Smith ? "

12251	12263	12236	12236	Rachel	21	" Answer ! I did n't hear you speak , ma'am . "
12264	12270	12273	12274	Mrs. Brown	32	" Did n't you now ! "
12284	12295	12297	12297	Rachel	21	" No , ma'am , I did not , indeed , "
12301	12306	12308	12309	Mrs. Brown	32	" Bless the girl ! "
12314	12323	12308	12309	Mrs. Brown	32	" why , you must be growing deaf . "
12324	12329	12331	12331	Rachel	21	" I hope not , "
12336	12354	12331	12331	Rachel	21	" yet , perhaps , I am ; for , indeed , I did not hear you . "
12355	12372	12375	12375	Jane	27	" La , Miss Gray ! do n't you see they are making fun of you ? "
12377	12391	12392	12392	Rachel	21	" Why , Mrs. Brown had n't been a saying anything at all . "
12453	12462	12463	12463	she	22	" If you were not sich a simpleton , "
12470	12523	12463	12463	she	22	" people would n't dare to laugh at you . They would n't take the liberty . No one ever laughed at me , I can tell you . No Mrs. Brown ; no , nor no Mrs. Smith either . But you ! why , they 'll do anythink to you . "

12624	12630	12632	12632	Rachel	21	" She is not strong , "
12634	12647	12632	12632	Rachel	21	" and I promised Mr. Jones she should not work too much . "
12648	12655	12658	12658	Jane	27	" Not much fear of that , "
12764	12774	12776	12776	Rachel	21	" Mary is gone to bed , Mr. Jones , "
12780	12793	12794	12794	he	511	" To bed!—She ai n't ill , I hope . Miss Gray , "
12802	12826	12794	12794	he	511	" Ill ! Oh , no ! but she felt tired . I am sorry you have had this long walk for nothing . "
12827	12834	12835	12835	he	511	" Never mind , Miss Gray , "
12850	12884	12849	12849	he	511	added—"the walk does me good , and then I hear how she is , and I 've the pleasure of seeing you all . And so she 's quite well , is she ? "
12919	12935	12911	12912	Mrs. Gray	22	" And what do you think of the state of the nation , Mr. Jones ? "
12957	12992	12936	12937	Mr. Jones	51	" Mrs. Gray , I ai n't no politician . For all I see , politics only brings a poor man into trouble . Look at the Chartists , and the tenth of April . "
12993	12999	13001	13001	Rachel	21	" Ah ! poor things ! "
13003	13023	13001	13001	Rachel	21	" I saw them — they passed by here . How thin they were — bow careworn they looked ! "
13064	13069	13070	13070	she	21	" Now , Rachel , "
13075	13095	13070	13070	she	21	" will you hold your tongue , and speak of what you know , and not meddle with politics . "
13174	13180	13182	13183	Mrs. Gray	22	" As to the Chartists ? "
13190	13205	13206	13206	he	51	" Law bless you , Mrs. Gray , I ai n't one of them ! "
13210	13235	13206	13206	he	51	" I mind my own business — that 's what I do , Mrs. Gray . The world must go round , you know . "
13236	13241	13244	13245	that lady	518	" So it must , "
13247	13258	13244	13245	that lady	518	" You never said a truer thing , Mr. Jones . "
13267	13274	13276	13277	Mr. Jones	51	" And I must go off , "
13287	13302	13276	13277	Mr. Jones	51	" for it 's getting late , and I have five miles to walk . "
13349	13362	13345	13345	he	51	" I could n't see her , could I , Miss Gray ? "
13513	13522	13523	13523	she	21	" Oh ! my father — my father ! "
13526	13540	13523	13523	she	21	" never have you looked so at your child — never — never ! "
13555	13562	13563	13563	he	51	" I 'd have kissed her , "
13576	13589	13563	13563	he	51	" but it might have woke her out of that sweet sleep . "
13619	13639	13641	13642	Rachel Gray	21	" Oh , Lord ! how beautiful is the love Thou hast put into the hearts of Thy creature ! "
13677	13690	13669	13669	she	21	" Mrs. Gray had never heard of such a think — never . "
13972	13994	13967	13967	Richard	51	" Breaking down of the business — other 's death — having to marry a poor fellow like him , & c. "
14304	14319	14325	14325	he	51	" How pretty she looked , with that bit of pink on her cheek , "
14390	14399	14400	14400	he	51	" I am a stranger to the neighbourhood , "
14403	14415	14417	14417	he	51	" but I dare say this young person can tell us ; "
14431	14437	14438	14438	she	564	" A grocer 's shop ? "
14441	14496	14438	14438	she	564	" there 's not one within a mile . You must go down the next street on your right - hand , turn into the alley on your left , then turn to your right again , and if you take the fifth street after that , it will take you to the Teapot . "
14511	14516	14518	14518	Jones	51	" What a chance ! "
14526	14580	14518	14518	Jones	51	" not a grocer 's shop within a mile . Now , suppose I had , say fifty pounds , just to open with , how soon the thing would do for itself . And then I 'd have my little Mary at home with me . Yes , that would be something ! "
14763	14764	14736	14736	he	51	purport:"Dear J.,"Als

15733	15745	15746	15747	Mr. Jones	51	" They ai nt a ringing ; they 're a tolling . "

16839	16858	16860	16860	Jones	51	" I tell you , ' tain't a bit of use your taking away thirteen at that rate , "
16865	16874	16876	16878	the old man	631	" And what will you give , then ? "
16886	16891	16894	16894	Jones	51	" Why , nothing ! "
16896	16911	16894	16894	Jones	51	" Who ever said I would give anything ? I didn't — did I ? "
16912	16926	16928	16930	the old man	631	" Then what do you come creeping and crawling about the place for ? "
16940	17081	16932	16932	his	631	" eh ! just tell me that . Why , these two months you 've crept and crept , and crawled , and crawled , till you 've sent the rag and bottle people away . ' Sir , ' says the rag and bottle woman to me , ' Sir , we ca n't stand it no longer . There 's a man , Sir , and he prowls around the shop . Sir , and he jist looks in , and darts off agin , and he wo n't buy no rags , and he has n't no bottles to sell ; and my husband and me , Sir , we ca n't stand it — that 's all . ' Well , and what have you got to say to that , I should like to know ? "
17104	17115	17117	17119	the old man	631	" I 'll tell you what you are , though , "
17130	17143	17121	17121	his	631	" you are a crawling , creeping , low , sneaking fellow ! "
17144	17150	17152	17152	Jones	51	" Now , old gentleman ! "
17161	17210	17152	17152	Jones	51	" just keep a civil tongue in your head , will you ? I did n't ask to come in , did I ? And if I did look at the shop at times , why , a cat can look at a king , ca n't he ? "
17288	17291	17280	17280	Jones	51	" creeping , "
17292	17295	17280	17280	Jones	51	" crawling . "
17529	17673	17697	17697	her	21	" When I consider how my light is spent Ere half my days , in this dark world and wide , And that one talent which is death to hide , Lodg'd with me useless , though my soul more bent , To serve therewith my Maker , and present My true account , lest he , returning , chide ; ' Doth God exact day - labour , light denied ? ' I fondly ask : but Patience to prevent That murmur , soon replies , ' God doth not need Either man 's work , or his own gifts ; who best Bear his mild yoke , they serve him best ; his state Is kingly ; thousands at his bidding speed , And post o'er land and ocean without rest ; They also serve , who only stand and wait ' "
17674	17686	17688	17688	Rachel	21	" ' They also serve who only stand and wait , ' "
17701	17782	17697	17697	her	21	" and that is my case . Oh , God ! I stand and wait , and alas ! I do nothing , for I am blind , and ignorant , and helpless , and what am I that the Lord should make use of me ; yet , in His goodness , my simple readiness to do His will , He takes as good service . Oh , Rachel ! happy Rachel ! to serve so kind a master . "
17850	17856	17857	17857	she	21	" Mary is very well , "
17883	17894	17895	17895	he	51	" Of course she is — of course she is , "
17940	17957	17958	17958	he	51	" Miss Gray , may I speak to you ? I want you to advise me , "
17966	17974	17976	17976	Rachel	21	" To advise you , Mr. Jones ! "
17987	17993	17994	17994	he	51	" Yes , Miss Gray , "
18009	18066	18067	18067	he	51	" Miss Gray , I ai nt a known you very long ; but there ai nt another in this wide world whom I respect as I do you . And I think I have proved it ; for have n't I given you my little Mary ? I could n't do more , Miss Gray , "
18074	18105	18067	18067	he	51	" Yes , Miss Gray , I do respect you ; and that is why I want you to advise me . Now , this is the whole story : — "
18235	18250	18253	18254	Miss Gray	28	" Here Mr. Jones held up his forefinger by way of note of admiration . "
18256	18261	18253	18254	Miss Gray	28	" he resumed impressively , "
18429	18472	18475	18476	Mr. Jones	51	" He looked earnestly in Rachel 's face . Ay , the child ; it was still the child , and always the child . His own was not his own — it was but a trust held for his little Mary . "
18478	18484	18475	18476	Mr. Jones	51	" said Rachel , smiling , "
18495	18496	18492	18492	your	51	" "
18504	18512	18501	18502	Miss Gray	28	" he rejoined , a little warmly , "
18564	18640	18558	18558	I	0	" Who had ever asked Rachel for advice ! Rachel the simpleton — Rachel the slighted and laughed - at dressmaker ? Little did Mr. Jones know how nervous he made the poor girl ; besides , she felt quite bewildered at the strange views he took of the case he submitted to her . At length she gathered courage , and looking earnestly in his face with her mild brown eyes , she spoke . "
18644	18648	18641	18642	Mr. Jones	51	" she said , "
18765	19147	18762	18763	God Almighty	31	" Richard Jones scratched his head , then hung it down ashamed . If he had dared , he would have asked of Rachel how he was to ask of God to advise him , and , especially , how he was to get the answer ! Poor fellow ! he had an excellent hearty some faith , much charity , but the world 's net was around him . His life was not like that of Rachel Gray — a heaven upon earth . And Rachel , who laboured under the disadvantages of a narrow education , and a narrow life , who had not enough knowledge and enough experience of human nature to understand clearly that there were states of mind worlds lower than her own , did not suspect that she had given Richard Jones the worst of all advice — that which the receiver can not follow . Alas ! who talks of God now ! who listens like Adam in Eden to the voice of the Lord , and treasures in his or her own heart that source of all knowledge ? And we complain that God goes away from us ; that His face is dark , and behind the cloud ; that in the days of adversity we find him not . Jones rose confused , muttered thanks , then hastily changed the subject by asking to see his daughter . Even as he spoke , the door opened , and Mary entered . She did not show much pleasure or surprise on seeing her father ; it was not that she did not love him , but she was a spoiled child , too much accustomed to his fondness and devotion to set great value on either . She complained of the heat , then of the cold , sat down , got up again , and gave herself all the airs of a precocious woman . Her father , leaning on his stick , looked at her with admixing fondness , and occasionally nodded and winked at Rachel , as if inviting her to admire likewise . At length , with a half stifled sigh — for he never parted from his darling without regret — he again said he must go . "
19159	19184	19187	19187	her	29	" he added , kissing her , but the peevish child half - turned her head away , and said his beard hurt her . "
19192	19198	19187	19187	her	29	" he exclaimed , chuckling , "
19213	19227	19187	19187	her	29	" and chucking Mary 's chin , he looked down at her fondly . "
19237	19267	19235	19235	you	692	" asked the young lady , rather pettishly . Upon which , Mr. Jones shook his head , looked delighted , and at length managed to tear himself away . "
19281	19302	19235	19235	you	692	" thought Rachel Gray , as she sat alone in the little back room on the evening of that day . "
19318	19529	19530	19530	I	0	" She laid down the book she had been attempting to read . She leaned her brow upon her hand ; she envied none , but her heart felt full to over - flowing . Since the night when she had gone to look at her father , as we have recorded , Rachel had not felt strong or courageous enough to attempt more . Her nature was timid , sensitive and shrinking to a fault , and circumstances had made it doubly so , yet the repeated sight of Richard Jones 's devoted love for his child , inspired her with involuntary hope . She had grown up in the belief of her father 's rooted indifference ; might she not have been mistaken ? was it not possible that his daughter could become dear to Thomas Gray , as other daughters were dear to their father ? Rachel had always cherished the secret hope that it would one day be so , but because that hope was so precious , she had deferred risking it , lest it should perish irretrievably . She now felt inwardly urged to make the attempt . Why should she not , like the prodigal son , rise and go to her father ? "
19533	19549	19530	19530	I	0	" she thought , clasping her hands , her cheeks flushing , her eyes kindling , "
19581	20051	19575	19576	God Almighty	31	" Here the sound of a sudden tumult in the little court close by , broke on the dream of Rachel Gray . She looked , and she saw and heard Madame Rose gesticulating and scolding , to the infinite amusement of a crowd of boys , who where teazing the idiot girl . The wrath of Madame Rose was something to see . Having first placed her protege behind herself for safety — as if her own little body could do much for the protection of another twice its size — Madame Rose next put herself in an attitude , then expostulated with , then scolded , then denounced the persecutors of the helpless idiot ; after which washing her hands of them , she walked backwards to her cellar , scorning to turn her back to the foe . But the enemy , nothing daunted , showed evident intentions of besieging her in her stronghold , and though Madame Rose made her appearance at the window , armed with a broomstick , she failed to strike that terror into the hearts of her assailants , which the formidable nature of the weapon warranted . Fortunately , however , for the peace of the little French lady , that valiant knight - errant of modern times , the policeman , having made his appearance at the entrance of the court , a scutter , then a rushing flight , were the immediate consequence . Ignorant of this fact , Madame Rose ascribed the result entirely to her own prowess , and in all peace of mind proceeded to cook her supper . Then followed the little domestic scenes which Rachel liked to watch . As Rachel looked , she took a bold resolve , and this was to pay Madame Rose a visit . They had met , the day before , in the street ; and Madame Rose had addressed a long and voluble discourse to Rachel , in French , concluding with an invitation to visit her , which Rachel had understood , and smilingly accepted . And now was the favourable moment to carry this project into effect . From the little room , Rachel heard Mrs. Brown 's loud voice below in the parlour . Mrs. Gray was fully engaged , and not likely to mind her daughter 's absence . Unheeded , Rachel slipped out . A few minutes brought her round to the little courts and to the house inhabited by Madame Rose . It was dingy , noisy , and dirty ; and as she groped and stumbled down the dark staircase , Rachel half repented haying come . The voice of Madame Rose directed her to the right door — for there were several . She knocked gently ; a shrill "
20054	20287	19575	19576	God Almighty	31	" which she rightly interpreted as a summons to enter , was uttered from within ; and pushing the door open , Rachel found herself in the abode and presence of Madame Rose . She was received with a storm of enthusiasm , that rather bewildered than pleased her . Madame Rose welcomed her in a torrent of speech , with a multiplicity of nods , and winks , and shrugs , and exclamations , so novel in the experience of Rachel Gray , that she began to wonder how much truth there might be in the epithet occasionally bestowed on Madame Rose . For , first of all , she insisted on cooking a dish of onion soup for her expressly , a kindness which Rachel had all the trouble in the world to resist ; and next , this point settled , she was loud and unceasing in the praise of the poor idiot girl , who sat mowing in her chair . Rachel went and sat near her , and spoke to her , but she only got an unintelligible murmur for a reply . Madame Rose shook her head , as much as to say that the attainments of Mimi — so she called her — did not include speech . But Mimi was very good — very good indeed , only she could not talk , which was "
20291	20314	19575	19576	God Almighty	31	" added Madame Rose , as , had she only been able to speak , Mimi would certainly have done it charmingly . "
20323	20329	20315	20315	You	699	" enthusiastically added Madame Rose . "
20334	20382	20390	20390	God	31	" Then , seeing that Rachel was engaged in scrutinizing , with a pitying glance , the ragged attire of her protege , Madame Rose jealously informed her that , as yet , the toilette of Mimi had been a little neglected , certainly ; but that , "
20392	20397	20398	20398	Mimi	64	" added Madame Rose , "
20404	20405	20406	20406	I	0	" "
20421	20425	20406	20406	I	0	" timidly said Rachel "
20435	20517	20427	20427	I	0	" Madame Rose coughed dubiously — she had not understood ; but a perfect knowledge of the English tongue , in all its most delicate intricacies , was one of her vanities . So , bending her head of one side , and patting her ear , as if to imply that there lay the fault , she evidently requested Rachel to repeat She did so ; and this time , Madame Rose caught enough of her meaning to misunderstand her . "
20524	20998	20521	20521	I	0	" she exclaimed , triumphantly ; and settling Mimi in her chair , she told her to be good , for that she was only going to fetch her an elegant dress presented to her by the goodness of Mademoiselle , and that she would be back in an incredibly short space of time ; after which exhortation , Madame Rose prepared to accompany Rachel . In vain , poor Rachel , alarmed at the prospect of her mother 's anger , endeavoured to explain that she would bring the dress . Madame Rose , still triumphantly asserting that she understood , insisted on going out with her guest , and actually walked with her to her very door . In great trepidation , Rachel opened it , and unconscious of peril or offence , Madame Rose entered , clattering along the passage in her wooden shoes ; but Mrs. Brown 's voice was just then at the loudest ; the noise was not heeded . Rachel took her up - stairs to the little back - room , and left her there , whilst she looked in the room which she shared with her mother , for the dress she wished to give Mimi ; she soon came back with it , tied in a parcel , and now devoutly wished that she could see Madame Rose safe out of the place . But Madame Rose was in no mood to go . She had recognized the room and window where she so often saw Rachel ; and she intimated as much , by a lively pantomime ; first taking up a book , she held it before her , pretending to read ; then she pointed to her forehead , to imply that Rachel was a thinker ; and finally , to the horror and dismay of Rachel , Madame Rose shut her eyes , opened her mouth , and warbled a sufficiently correct imitation of the old hundredth . The window was open ; and even Mrs. Brown 's voice could not drown these strange tones . They reached the ear of Mrs. Gray ; and before Rachel had fairly recovered from the surprise and alarm into which the musical outburst of Madame Rose had thrown her , her step - mother appeared at the door of the little back room , and , in stern and indignant accents , asked to know the meaning of what she heard and saw . But , before Rachel could reply , the French costume of Madame Rose had betrayed her . Mrs. Gray was of Scotch descent , and she had some of the old puritan spirit , to which , in the course of a long life , she had added a plenteous store of stubborn English prejudices . Madame Rose was "
21003	21004	21005	21007	a French beggar	703	" "
21009	21053	21005	21007	a French beggar	703	" too ; and that she should have darkened her doors!—that she should be familiarly sitting under her roof — chattering and singing in a back room , with her daughter , was an intolerable insult , a wrong not to be borne . "
21062	21072	21073	21073	I	0	" she said , her voice quivering with indignation . "
21087	21170	21081	21081	you	704	" The tones and the attitude of Mrs. Gray were not to be misunderstood ; nor was little Madame Rose so dull as to mistake them . She saw that her presence was not welcome , and , with great dignity , rose and took her leave . Crimson with pain and shame , Rachel followed her out . She gave Madame Rose an humble and imploring glance , as they parted at the door , as much , as to say , "
21179	21298	21173	21173	I	0	" But the appeal was not needed . To her surprise , Madame Rose remained very good - humoured . She even laughed and shrugged her shoulders , French fashion , and indulged in a variety of pantomimic signs , closing with one more intelligible than the rest : a significant tap of her forefinger on her brown forehead , and by which Madame Rose plainly intimated it to be her firm conviction that the intellect of Mrs. Gray was unfortunately deranged . Thus they parted . Violent were the reproaches with which Mrs. Gray greeted her daughter 's reappearance . She exacted a strict and rigid account of the rise and progress of Rachel 's acquaintance with that "
21303	21429	21173	21173	I	0	" was horror - struck on learning that the back - room window had been made the medium ; and not satisfied with prohibiting future intercourse , took the most effective means to prevent it , by locking up the guilty zoom , and putting the key in her pocket . To all this Rachel submitted ; though , when she saw the door of her much - loved retreat closing on her , her heart ached . But when , in the height of her anger , Mrs. Gray railed at the poor little Frenchwoman , as little better than an idolater or an infidel , Rachel felt as if it touched her honour , not to suffer this slur on her humble friend . "
21432	21440	21430	21430	Mother	42	" she said , with some firmness , "
21483	21500	21481	21481	mother	1485	" added Rachel , slightly colouring , from the fervour with which she felt and spoke , "
21514	21715	21512	21512	God	31	" Unable to contradict , Mrs. Gray sniffed indignantly . Hard indeed were the days that followed for Rachel Gray . The old quarrel had began anew . Why was she not like every one ? Why did she pick up strange acquaintances?—above all , why did she mope , and want to be in the little back room ? It was strange , and Mrs. Gray was not sure that it was not wicked . If so , it was a wickedness of which she effectually deprived Rachel , by keeping the back room locked , and the key in her pocket . But , hard as this was , it was not all . Amongst Rachel 's few treasures , were little pamphlets , tracts , old sermons , scraps of all sorts , a little hoard collected for years , but to their owner priceless . She did not read them daily ; she had not time ; but when she was alone , she took them oat , now and then , to look at and think over . On the day that followed the affair of Madame Rose , Mrs. Gray discovered Rachel 's board . "
21722	21743	21512	21512	God	31	" she thought , and she took the papers to the kitchen , and lit the fire with them forthwith . "
21753	21763	21750	21750	you	1485	" cried Rachel , when she discovered her loss . "
21770	21831	21750	21750	you	1485	" tartly asked Mrs. Gray . A few silent , unheeded tears Rachel shed , but no more was said . But her very heart ached ; and , perhaps , because it did ache , her longing to go and see her father returned all the stronger . The whole day , the thought kept her in a dream . "
21839	21845	21832	21832	I	0	" angrily exclaimed Mrs. Gray , "
21848	22331	21832	21832	I	0	" Rachel looked up in her mother 's face , and smiled so pleasantly , that Mrs. Gray was a little softened , she herself knew not why ; but the smile was so very sweet . And again Rachel sat up that night , when all were sleeping in the little house ; again she burned her precious candle ends , and sat and sewed , to finish the last of the half - dozen of fine linen shirts , begun a year before , purchased with the few shillings she could spare now and then from her earnings , and sewed by stealth , in hours robbed from the rest of the night , after the fatigue of the day . But , spite of all her efforts to keep awake , she fell asleep over her task . When she awoke , daylight gleamed through the chinks of the shutters ; it was morning . She opened the window in some alarm ; but felt relieved to perceive that it was early yet . The street was silent ; every window was closed ; the sky , still free from smoke was calm and pure ; there was a peace in this stillness , which moved the very heart of Rachel Gray . She thought of the calm slumbers of the two millions , who , in a few hours , would fill the vast city , with noise , agitation and strife ; and she half sadly wondered that for the few years man has to spend here below , for the few wants and cravings he derives from nature , he should think it needful to give away the most precious hours of a short life , and devote to ceaseless toil every aspiration and desire of his heart . It was too late to think of going to bed , which would , besides , have exposed her to discovery . So , after uniting her morning and evening prayers in one long and fervent petition of Hope and Love , she went back to her work , finished the little there was to do , then carefully folded up the six shirts , and tied them up in a neat parcel . When this was done , Rachel busied herself with her usual tasks about the house , until her mother came down . It was no uncommon thing for Rachel to get up early , and do the work , while her mother still slept ; and , accordingly , that she should have done so , as Mrs. Gray thought , drew forth from her no comment on this particular morning . Everything , indeed , seemed to favour her project ; for , in the course of the day , Mrs. Gray and Jane went out . Rachel remained alone with Mary . "
22344	22366	22342	22342	Miss	1495	" said Mary , looking with wonder at Rachel , as she busied herself about the house , singing by snatches . "
22374	22413	22342	22342	Miss	1495	" replied Rachel ; she opened the parlour window ; in poured the joyous sunshine — the blue sky shone above the dull brick street , and the tailor 's thrush began to sing in its osier cage . "
22421	22446	22447	22447	Mary	29	" continued Rachel ; and she smiled at her own thoughts ; for on such a beautiful day , how could she but prosper ? "
22449	22457	22447	22447	Mary	29	" she resumed , after a pause , "
22478	22479	22476	22476	you	29	" "
22490	22496	22487	22488	Miss Gray	28	" said Mary , smiling . "
22505	22535	22487	22488	Miss Gray	28	" she added , with a look of superiority ; for she , too , seeing every one else around her do it , unconsciously began to patronize Rachel . "
22540	22561	22487	22488	Miss Gray	28	" simply replied Rachel Gray , too well disciplined into humility to feel offended with the pertness of a child , "
22615	22616	22620	22620	you	29	" "
22627	22801	22622	22622	I	0	" replied Mary , again looking superior . And now , Rachel is gone out . She has been walking an hour and more . Again , she goes through a populous neighbourhood , and through crowded streets ; but this time , in the broad daylight of a lazy summer afternoon . Rachel is neither nervous nor afraid — not , at least , of anything around her . On she goes , her heart full of hope , her mind full of dreams . On she goes : street after street is passed ; at length , is reached the street where Thomas Gray , the father of Rachel , lives . She stops at the second - hand ironmonger 's and looks at the portraits and the books , and feels faint and hopeless , and almost wishes that her father may not be within . Thomas Gray was at his work , and there was a book by him at which he glanced now and then , Tom Paine 's "
22806	22946	22804	22804	Man	392	" There was an empty pewter pot too , and a dirty public - house paper , from which we do not mean to have it inferred that Thomas Gray was given to intoxication . He was essentially a sober , steady man , vehement in nothing , not even in politics , though he was a thorough Republican . Thomas Gray was planing sturdily , enjoying the sunshine , which fell full on his meagre figure . It was hot ; but as he grew old he grew chilly , when , suddenly , a dark shadow came between him and the light . He looked up , and saw a woman standing on the threshold of his shop . She was young and simply clad , tall and slender , not handsome , and very timid looking . "
22951	22973	22804	22804	Man	392	" he said , civilly enough . The stranger entered ; he looked at her , and she looked at him . "
22977	22990	22994	22994	Rachel	21	" he asked , at length . She took courage and spoke . "
22996	23004	22994	22994	Rachel	21	" she said . He said nothing . "
23008	23024	23005	23006	Rachel Gray	21	" she resumed . He looked at her steadily , but he was still silent . "
23030	23038	23027	23028	your daughter	713	" she continued , in faltering accents . "
23048	23054	23041	23041	I	0	" he answered rather drily . "
23075	23131	23041	23041	I	0	" Rachel obeyed ; but she was so agitated that she could not utter one word . Her father looked at her for awhile , then resumed his work . Rachel did not speak — she literally could not . Words would have choked her ; so it was Thomas Gray who opened the conversation . "
23141	23145	23137	23139	the old lady	714	" he asked . "
23157	23174	23155	23155	Sir	1577	" replied Rachel The name of father was too strange to be used thus at first . "
23196	23197	23186	23187	a milliner	717	" "
23212	23229	23206	23206	I	0	" said Rachel , thinking this , poor girl ! a favourable opening for her present . "
23237	23278	23230	23230	I	0	" she added , opening and untying her parcel ; and displaying the shirts to her father 's view , and as she did so , she gazed very wistfully in his face . He gave them a careless look . "
23285	23289	23281	23283	my good girl	720	" he said , "
23298	23317	23318	23318	I	0	" And he returned to his work , a moment interrupted . Tears stood in Rachel 's eyes . "
23322	23326	23318	23318	I	0	" she began , "
23347	23348	23340	23340	I	0	" "
23355	23360	23362	23362	you	720	" he philosophically replied , "
23369	23381	23367	23367	Jim	33	" he added , hailing a lad who was passing by , "
23416	23424	23405	23405	I	0	" he continued , addressing his daughter . "
23433	23445	23446	23446	you	720	" he added , jerking his head towards the back parlour , "
23463	23546	23446	23446	you	720	" Rachel rose and eagerly availed herself of this invitation , cold though it was ; she felt curious too , to inspect , her father 's domestic arrangements . She was almost disappointed to find everything so much more tidy than she could have imagined . She had hoped that her services as house - keeper might be more required , either then , or at some future period of time . She sat down , but she could not eat . "
23556	23590	23446	23446	you	720	" said her father from the shop . Rachel went and took it ; she poured out some in a glass , but she could not drink ; her heart was too full . "
23595	23606	23591	23591	You	720	" said her father , who had now joined her . "
23611	23620	23607	23607	I	0	" replied Rachel , feeling ready to cry , "
23631	23632	23607	23607	I	0	" "
23639	23644	23607	23607	I	0	" said her father , "
23656	23723	23653	23653	you	720	" It was the second time he said so . Rachel looked up into his face ; she sought for something there , not for love , not for fondness , but for the shadow of kindness , for that which might one day become affection — she saw nothing but cold , hard , rooted indifference . The head of Rachel sank on her bosom , "
23731	23750	23727	23727	God	31	" she thought . With a sigh she rose , and looked up in her father 's face . "
23756	23771	23754	23754	father	692	" she said , for her father she would call him once at least . "
23777	23870	23775	23775	Rachel	21	" he replied . She held out her hand ; he took it with the same hard indifference he had shown from the beginning . He did not seek to detain her ; he did not ask her to come again . His farewell was as cold as had been his greeting . Rachel left him with a heart full to bursting . She had not gone ten steps when he called her . She hastened back ; he stood on the threshold of his shop , a newspaper in his hand . "
23907	23908	23888	23888	You	726	" "
23913	23986	23911	23911	father	692	" meekly said Rachel . She took the paper from his hand , turned away , and did as she was bid . Her errand fulfilled , Rachel walked home . There were no tears on her cheek , but there was a dull pain at her heart ; an aching sorrow that dwelt there , and that — do what she would — would not depart . In vain she said to herself—"It
24023	24028	23911	23911	father	692	" still disappointment murmured : "
24056	24207	24210	24210	you	729	" It was late when Rachel reached home . Mrs. Gray , confounded at her step - daughter 's audacity in thus again absenting herself without leave , had , during the whole day , amassed a store of resentment , which now burst forth on Rachel 's head . The irritable old lady scolded herself into a violent passion . Rachel received her reproaches with more of apathy than of her usual resignation . They were alone ; Jane and Mary had retired to their room . Rachel sat by the table where the supper things were laid , her head supported by her hand . At the other end of the table sat Mrs. Gray erect , sharp , bitter ; scolding and railing by turns , and between both burned a yellow tallow candle unsnuffed , dreary looking , and but half lighting the gloomy little parlour . "
24227	24253	24210	24210	you	729	" at length cried Mrs. Gray , exasperated by her daughter 's long silence . Rachel looked up in her step - mother 's face . "
24264	24269	24254	24254	You	732	" she said deliberately . "
24278	24325	24254	24254	You	732	" Not one word could Mrs. Gray utter . The face of Rachel , pale , desolate , and sorrow - stricken , told the whole story . Rachel added nothing . She , lit another candle , and merely saying , in her gentle voice — "
24331	24390	24329	24329	mother	1485	" she left the room . As Rachel passed by the little room of the apprentices , she saw a streak of light gliding out on the landing , through the half - open door . She pushed it , and entered . Jane sat reading by the little table ; Mary lay in bed , but awake . "
24399	24405	24395	24395	you	735	" said Rachel to Jane , "
24417	24418	24411	24411	I	0	" "
24425	24442	24411	24411	I	0	" drily answered Jane . Rachel did not heed her — she was bending over Mary . "
24452	24456	24450	24450	Mary	29	" she asked . "
24464	24518	24459	24459	I	0	" pettishly answered Mary . Rachel smoothed the young girl 's hair away from her cheek . She remembered how dearly , how fondly loved was that peevish child ; and she may be forgiven if she involuntarily thought the contrast between that love , and her own portion of indifference , bitter . "
24521	24526	24528	24528	you	735	" she softly whispered , "
24536	24537	24528	24528	you	735	" "
24545	24546	24542	24542	I	0	" "
24558	24559	24552	24552	you	735	" "
24568	24575	24562	24562	you	735	" crossly said the young girl . "
24582	24596	24580	24580	Mary	29	" exclaimed Rachel , and there was tenderness and pathos in her voice ; "
24612	24613	24606	24606	I	0	" "
24620	24621	24606	24606	I	0	" "
24639	24640	24625	24625	I	0	" "
24648	24674	24644	24644	I	0	" replied Mary , who had grown up in the firm conviction that children were domestic idols , of which fathers were the born worshippers . "
24685	24691	24681	24681	you	29	" very earnestly said Rachel . "
24701	24724	24699	24699	Mary	29	" She spoke in a soft , low voice ; but Mary , wearied with the discourse , turned her head away . "
24734	24739	24725	24725	I	0	" she said peevishly . "
24753	24758	24746	24746	she	29	" ironically observed Jane . "
24768	24779	24766	24766	you	29	" cried Mary , reddening , and speaking very fast . "
24796	24797	24793	24793	I	0	" "
24810	24835	24836	24836	Jane	27	" quietly put in Jane . Mary burst into peevish tears . Jane laughed triumphantly . Rachel looked at them both with mild reproach . "
24838	24842	24836	24836	Jane	27	" she said , "
24886	25172	25178	25178	God	31	" The two girls remained abashed . Rachel quietly left the room . She went to her own . She had prayed long that morning , but still longer did she pray that night . For alas!—who knows it not — the wings of Hope would of themselves raise us to Heaven ; but hard it is for poor resignation to look up from this sad earth . We were made to endure . A Heathen philosopher held the eight of the just man 's suffering , worthy of the Gods , and Christianity knows nothing more beautiful , more holy , than the calm resignation of the pure and the lowly , to the will of their Divine Father . It was the will of Heaven that Rachel should not be beloved of her earthly father . She bore her lot — not without sorrow ; but , at least , without repining . Perhaps , she was more silent , more thoughtful , than before ; but she was not less cheerful , and in one sense she was certainly not less happy . Affliction patiently borne for the love of the hand that inflicts it , loses half its sting . The cup is always bitter — and doubly bitter shall it seem to us , if we drink it reluctantly ; but if we courageously dram it , we shall find that the last drop is not like the rest It is fraught with a Divine sweetness — it is a precious balsam , and can heal the deepest and most envenomed wound . This pure drop Rachel found in her cup . It strengthened and upheld her through her trial . "
25180	25184	25189	25189	God	31	" she repeated to herself—"It
25191	25263	25189	25189	God	31	" and those simple words , which held a meaning so deep , were to Rachel fortitude and consolation . And in the meanwhile , the little world around her , unconscious of her sufferings and her trials — for even her mother could not wholly divine them — went on its ways . Mrs. Gray grumbled , Jane was grim , Mary was peevish , and Mrs. Brown occasionally dropped in "
25269	25528	25189	25189	God	31	" as she said herself . As to Richard Jones , we will not attempt to describe the uneasiness of mind he endured in endeavouring to follow out Rachel 's advice . He did not understand its spirit , which , indeed , she could not have explained . They who make the will of God their daily law , are guided , even in apparently worldly matters,—not indeed , so as never to commit mistakes , which were being beyond humanity , but so , at least , as to err as little as possible concerning their true motives of action . Our passions are our curse , spiritual and temporal ; and the mere habit of subduing them gives prudence and humility in all things:—wisdom thus becomes one of the rewards which God grants to the faithful servant . But of this , what did Richard Jones — the most unspiritual of good men , know ? After three days spent in a state of distracting doubt , he came to the conclusion that it was , and must be the will of Heaven that he should have a shop . Poor fellow ! if he took his own will for that of the Almighty , did he fall into a very uncommon mistake ? Once , his mind was made up , he turned desperate , went and secured the shop . He had all the time been in a perfect fever , lest some other should forestall him , after which he became calm . "
25552	25646	25543	25543	he	740	" and in this lofty mood it was that Richard Jones went and gave a loud , clear , and distinct knock at Mrs. Gray 's door . Dinner was over — the apprentices were working — Rachel was dreaming , rather sadly , poor girl ! for she thought of what was , and of what might have been . Mrs. Gray was reading the newspaper , when the entrance of Richard Jones , admitted by his daughter , disturbed the quiet little household . At once Mrs. Gray flew into politics . "
25652	25656	25660	25660	you	51	" she cried , "
25686	25723	25724	25724	She	0	" Mrs. Gray was habitually a Tory , and not a mild one ; but on the subject of taxes and rates , Mrs. Gray was , we are sorry to say , a violent radical . "
25730	25734	25724	25724	She	0	" she declared . "
25746	25753	25744	25744	they	742	" echoed Mr. Jones , chuckling . "
25778	25824	25767	25767	I	0	" he added , winking . Mrs. Gray did not understand at all . She coughed , and looked puzzled . Mr. Jones saw that Rachel had not spoken to her . He continued winking , chuckling , and rubbing his hands as he spoke . "
25834	25867	25831	25832	Mrs. Gray	22	" Mrs. Gray was profoundly astonished ; Mary 's work dropped on her lap as she stared with open mouth and eyes at her father , who chucked her chin for her . "
25870	25878	25831	25832	Mrs. Gray	22	" he resumed , addressing Mrs. Gray ; "
25887	25888	25879	25879	I	0	" "
25894	25895	25891	25891	you	0	" "
25936	25937	25922	25922	ma'am	1506	" "
25946	25959	25943	25944	Mr. Jones	51	" said Mrs. Gray , to whom the latter proposition sounded atheistical , "
25963	25964	25943	25944	Mr. Jones	51	" "
25975	25985	25990	25991	Mrs. Gray	22	" asked Mr. Jones , unconscious of his offence , "
26049	26090	26046	26047	Mrs. Gray	22	" He winked and chuckled again . Rachel could not help smiling . Mrs. Gray was grave and courteous , like any foreign potentate congratulating his dear brother , Monsieur mon frere , on some fortunate event of his reign . "
26101	26105	26091	26091	I	0	" resumed Jones ; "
26151	26152	26155	26155	she	28	" "
26158	26167	26155	26155	she	28	" replied Mrs. Gray for her meek daughter . "
26178	26218	26219	26219	You	22	" Mary , whom the tidings of the grocer 's shop had most agreeably excited , rose with great alacrity to obey , and promptly returned , with her bonnet on . It was Rachel who let them out . "
26232	26236	26219	26219	You	22	" she whispered ; "
26250	26276	26245	26245	I	0	" Mary 's only reply to this kind speech , was a saucy toss of the head . The little thing already felt an heiress . "
26286	26298	26284	26284	father	692	" she promptly asked , as they went down the street , "
26305	26306	26284	26284	father	692	" "
26314	26329	26284	26284	father	692	" said Mary , as if she had rolled in guineas all her life . "
26336	26416	26284	26284	father	692	" he replied candidly , and exactly in the same spirit ; for if there is a thing people promptly get used to , it is money . Mary had always been her father 's confidante ; he now opened his whole heart to her , and was thereby much relieved . To his great satisfaction , Mary condescended to approve almost without restriction , all he had done . She accompanied him over the house and shop — thought "
26423	26428	26284	26284	father	692	" but kindly added , "
26442	26451	26284	26284	father	692	" and finally gave it as her opinion , "
26464	26465	26525	26525	I	0	" "
26472	26483	26525	26525	I	0	" said Mr. Jones , sitting down on the counter . "
26541	26542	26539	26539	Mary	29	" "
26548	26549	26539	26539	Mary	29	" "
26608	26609	26606	26606	Mary	29	" "
26615	26621	26606	26606	Mary	29	" replied that infallible authority . "
26688	26830	26686	26686	Mary	29	" The little thing laughed ; her father gave her a kiss ; got up from the counter , and with the golden vision of endless doubling of capital before him , walked out of the shop . What airs little Mary took ; how Jane taunted and twitted her , how Rachel had to interfere ; how even Mrs. Brown chose to comment on the startling fact of a new grocer 's shop , and what predictions she made , we leave to the imagination of the reader . We deal with the great day , or rather with the eve of the great day . It was come . Rachel , her mother , Mary , and Mr. Jones were all busy giving the shop its last finishing touch ; on the next morning the Teapot was to open . "
26843	26959	26962	26963	Miss Gray	28	" said Jones , looking around him with innocent satisfaction . He was , as we have said before , a sort of Jack - of - all - trades , and to him the Teapot doubly owed its existence . He had painted the walls ; he had fixed up the shelves in their places ; the drawers and boxes his own hands had fashioned . We will not aver that a professional glazier and carpenter might not have done all this infinitely better than Richard Jones , but who could have worked so cheap or pleased Richard Jones so well ? And thus with harmless pleasure he could look around him and repeat : "
26972	26973	26962	26963	Miss Gray	28	" "
26976	26988	26989	26989	I	0	" put in Mrs. Gray , before her daughter could speak , "
27019	27035	27000	27001	Mr. Jones	51	" Mr. Jones rubbed his forehead , and passed his hand through his stubby hair . "
27058	27059	27063	27063	father	692	" "
27065	27076	27063	27063	father	692	" zealously cried Mary , not relishing so much modesty , "
27090	27091	27081	27081	you	692	" "
27096	27102	27081	27081	you	692	" candidly replied her father , "
27111	27112	27108	27108	I	0	" "
27129	27130	27116	27116	you	692	" "
27151	27152	27140	27141	Miss Gray	28	" "
27161	27171	27156	27156	you	692	" triumphantly exclaimed Mary , without heeding his orders . "
27182	27183	27156	27156	you	692	" "
27193	27194	27196	27196	I	0	" "
27206	27207	27200	27200	I	0	" "
27222	27228	27215	27215	you	692	" asked the pertinacious daughter . "
27248	27257	27245	27246	Mrs. Gray	22	" he added , turning confidentially towards her , "
27465	27466	27457	27458	Mrs. Gray	22	" "
27473	27478	27457	27458	Mrs. Gray	22	" enthusiastically cried Mary , "
27486	27487	27483	27484	Miss Gray	28	" "
27493	27503	27483	27484	Miss Gray	28	" mildly said Rachel , who was truth itself , "
27515	27525	27512	27513	Mr. Jones	51	" she added , in a low timid voice , "
27544	27566	27528	27528	you	51	" Jones wagged his head , winked , and touching his nose with his right hand forefinger , he whispered knowingly : "
27583	27584	27571	27572	Miss Gray	28	" "
27591	27595	27589	27589	father	692	" cried Mary , "
27601	27602	27589	27589	father	692	" "
27612	27692	27589	27589	father	692	" exclaimed Jones , suddenly producing this masterpiece of art , and holding it up aloft to the gaze of the beholders . Such a Teapot had never been seen before , and , most probably , will never be seen again , to the end of time . Its shape we will not , because we can not describe . It confounded Rachel , and startled even Mrs. Gray . She coughed , and looked at it dubiously . "
27698	27702	27589	27589	father	692	" she said . "
27720	27721	27717	27717	you	51	" "
27733	27734	27589	27589	father	692	" "
27749	27750	27741	27742	Mrs. Gray	22	" "
27761	27762	27741	27742	Mrs. Gray	22	" "
27774	27781	27784	27784	you	28	" replied Jones , rather nettled , "
27787	27837	27784	27784	you	28	" Mrs. Gray said she did ; but we are inclined to believe she did not . However , Jones was satisfied ; and , setting down the wooden Teapot — we forgot to say that it was flaming red — on the counter , he surveyed it complacently . "
27846	27849	27838	27838	I	0	" he said "
27856	27857	27854	27854	Mary	29	" "
27863	27864	27861	27861	father	692	" "
27908	28178	27867	27867	one	779	" With the cup of tea , came a discussion of the morrow 's prospects , and of the ultimate destinies of the Teapot — the upshot of which was , that Mr. Jones was an enterprising public man , and destined to effect a salutary revolution in the whole neighbourhood . Such , at least , was the opinion of Mrs. Gray , warmly supported by Mary . Mr. Jones was silent , through modesty ; Rachel , because she was already thinking of other things . They parted late , though the Teapot was to open early . There is a report that it opened with dawn , Mr. Jones not having been able to shut his eyes all night for excitement . But it is more important to record that , until its close , late on the following evening , the Teapot was not one moment empty . Mary had remained at home , to assist her father ; and she went through the day with perfect composure ; but Mr. Jones was fairly overpowered : the cup of his honours was too full ; the sum of his joy was too great . He blundered , he stammered , he was excited , and looked foolish . Altogether , he did not feel happy , until the shop was shut , and all was fairly over . He then sat down , wiped his forehead , and declared , that since he was married to his dear little Mary 's blessed mother , he had never gone through such a trying day — never . "
28189	28215	28184	28185	Mr. Jones	51	" gravely observed Mrs. Gray to Mrs. Brown . But Mrs. Brown was inclined to look at the shady side of the Tea - pot . "
28220	28225	28218	28218	you	51	" she kindly said , "
28250	28251	28239	28239	I	0	" "
28258	28263	28239	28239	I	0	" grimly observed Jane ; "
28274	28275	28271	28272	Mrs. Brown	32	" "
28282	28288	28280	28280	Jane	27	" said Rachel , gravely ; "
28294	28310	28290	28290	I	0	" she added , with some firmness , and venturing for once on a reproof , "
28346	28488	28491	28491	Mary	29	" She raised her voice as she began ; but it sank low ere she concluded . Surprised at herself for having said so much , she did not look round , but resumed her work , a moment interrupted . The room remained deeply silent Jane was crimson . For once , Mrs. Gray thought her daughter had spoken sensibly ; and for once , Mrs. Brown found nothing to say . A week had passed over the Teapot , and , sitting in the back - parlour with Mary , who was busy sewing , Richard Jones dived deep into his books , and cast up his accounts . He allowed for rent , for expenditure , for household , for extras , then his face , brimful of ill - disguised exultation , he said to his daughter : "
28644	28645	28629	28629	I	0	" "
28661	28672	28652	28652	you	692	" peevishly interrupted Mary . Mary 's will was law . "
28686	28692	28678	28678	I	0	" ingenuously replied Richard Jones , "
28720	28721	28722	28722	I	0	" "
28732	28759	28722	28722	I	0	" again interrupted Mary , who , from hearing her father , had caught up some of the money terms of this money - making world . "
28771	28777	28762	28762	I	0	" replied her docile papa . "
28825	28832	28833	28833	I	0	" and he scratched his head . "
28896	28903	28931	28931	Mary	29	" he added , glancing towards the shop—"a
28909	28930	28931	28931	Mary	29	" he continued , complacently passing his Angers through his hair . Awhile he mused , then suddenly he observed : "
28944	28951	28931	28931	Mary	29	" Mary now slept at home . "
28962	28963	28931	28931	Mary	29	" "
28973	28978	28967	28967	I	0	" she tartly replied . "
28988	28992	28967	28967	I	0	" she added . "
29001	29007	28994	28994	you	29	" authoritatively said Mr. Jones . "
29024	29025	29026	29026	I	0	" "
29039	29044	29026	29026	I	0	" composedly resumed Mary . "
29060	29075	29026	29026	I	0	" Mr. Jones had at first looked startled , but this settled the question . "
29094	29101	29090	29090	you	29	" he said , half angrily . "
29154	29168	29135	29135	she	28	" he added , with a philosophic sigh over the weaknesses of humanity . "
29179	29183	29172	29172	Jane	27	" observed Mary ; "
29190	29191	29185	29185	I	0	" "
29288	29321	29278	29278	he	601	" This matter decided , Mary went up to her room ; her father remained by the fireside , looking at the glowing coals , and dreaming to his heart 's content . "
29329	29333	29278	29278	he	601	" he thought , "
29378	29399	29374	29374	they	803	" he added , thoughtfully , addressing the fire , and giving it a poke , by way of comment , "
29457	29465	29455	29455	he	806	" inquired Jones , warming with his subject "
29484	29521	29455	29455	he	806	" Mr. Jones gave the fire another poke . In the burning coals he saw a pleasing vision rise . He saw his shop full of customers ; he served with slow dignity , assisted by a "
29528	29685	29687	29687	he	810	" busy as a bee , active as a deer , for it was Saturday night , and the fair maids and matrons of the vicinity were all impatient . Then from Saturday it was Sunday ; the shop was closed , the street was silent . Young Thomson was brushing his coat in the yard and whistling ; Mary was upstairs dressing ; another five minutes , and she comes down in straw bonnet lined with pink , clean printed muslin frock , mousseline - de - laine shawl , brown boots and blue parasol . The happy father saw them going off together with delighted eyes and brimful heart Then other visions follow ; one of a wedding breakfast at which Mr. Jones sings a song , and another of half a dozen grandchildren , all tugging at his skirts , whilst he solemnly rocks the baby , and as solemnly informs the infant : "
29697	29751	29687	29687	he	810	" Peace be with such dreams whenever they come to the poor man 's hearth ! A little surprised at not seeing Mary as usual on the following morning , and thinking she might be unwell , Rachel Gray sent Jane to enquire . Jane soon returned , her face brimful of news . "
29754	29758	29687	29687	he	810	" said Rachel , "
29763	29764	29761	29761	Mary	29	" "
29775	29776	29770	29770	Mary	29	" "
29784	29785	29786	29786	She	29	" "
29796	30000	30001	30001	Mary	29	" And Jane sat down , and took up her work , and became deeply absorbed in a sleeve trimming . Rachel reddened and looked pained . She liked Mary ; the pale , sickly child reminded her strongly of her own lost sister , and though she could allow for the natural tartness with which Jane had no doubt fulfilled her errand , yet she knew that Jane was true , and that as she represented it , the matter must be . For a while she suspended her work , sadly wondering at the causeless ingratitude of a child whom she had treated with uniform kindness and indulgence , then she tried to dismiss the matter from her mind ; but she could not do so , and when dusk came round , her first act , as soon as she laid by her work , was to slip out unperceived — for Mrs. Gray , highly indignant with Mr. Jones and his daughter , would certainly have opposed her — and go as far as the Teapot . Mr. Jones was serving a customer . He did not recognize Rachel as she entered the shop , and hastily called out : "
30010	30011	30003	30003	Mary	29	" "
30020	30025	30017	30018	Mr. Jones	51	" timidly said Rachel . "
30032	30039	30029	30030	Miss Gray	28	" he replied , slightly embarrassed , "
30061	30114	30115	30115	Mary	29	" Much more sulky than glad looked Mary , but of this Rachel took no notice ; she sat down by the side of the young girl , and , as if nothing had occurred , spoke of the Teapot and its prospects . To which discourse Mary gave replies pertinaciously sullen . "
30117	30123	30115	30115	Mary	29	" at length said Rachel , "
30138	30164	30165	30165	Mary	29	" This simple question obtaining no reply , Rachel repeated it ; still Mary remained silent , but when a third time Rachel gently said : "
30172	30178	30170	30170	you	29	" Mary began to cry . "
30188	30195	30196	30196	you	28	" exclaimed her father looking in , "
30210	30211	30212	30212	I	0	" "
30214	30218	30212	30212	I	0	" said Rachel , "
30236	30237	30227	30227	her	29	" "
30245	30252	30239	30239	I	0	" he replied , almost sharply , "
30291	30311	30269	30269	I	0	" And a customer calling him back to the shop , he left the parlour threshold . Rachel rose . "
30318	30323	30316	30316	Mary	29	" she gently said ; "
30342	30348	30335	30335	you	29	" Mary did not reply . "
30356	30365	30353	30354	Mr. Jones	51	" said Rachel , passing through the shop . "
30373	30379	30370	30371	Miss Gray	28	" he replied , formally . "
30391	30442	30370	30371	Miss Gray	28	" When people have done an insolent and ungrateful thing , they generally try to persuade themselves that it was a spirited , independent sort of thing ; and so now endeavoured to think Richard Jones and his daughter — but in vain . To both still came the thought : "
30457	30500	30370	30371	Miss Gray	28	" The conscience of Mr. Jones , little used to such reflections , made him feel extremely uneasy ; and if that of Mary was not quite so sensitive , the dull routine of the paternal home added much force to the conclusion "
30512	30562	30563	30563	I	0	" Mary was too childish , and had ever been too much indulged to care for consistency . At the close of a week , she therefore declared that she wished to go back to Miss Gray , and did not know why her father had taken her away . "
30570	30580	30581	30581	you	1542	" said Richard Jones , confounded at the accusation , "
30591	30592	30581	30581	you	1542	" "
30636	30653	30658	30658	Mary	29	" added Mary , busting into tears . Jones hung down his head — then shook it "
30664	30691	30658	30658	Mary	29	" he exclaimed , ruefully ; and he felt as if he could hare cried himself , to see the strange perversity of this spoiled child , "
30697	30822	30658	30658	Mary	29	" as he internally phrased it , and actually upbraided him with his over - indulgence . A wiser father would never have thus indulged a pettish daughter , and never have humbled himself as , to please his little Mary , Richard Jones now did . That same day , he went round to Rachel Gray 's ; he had hoped that she might be alone in the little parlour ; but no , there sat , as if to increase his mortification , Mrs. Gray , stiff and stern , and Jane smiling grimly . Rachel alone was the same as usual . Jones scratched his head , coughed , and looked foolish ; but at length he came out with it : "
30844	30862	30658	30658	Mary	29	" he added , looking at Rachel doubtfully . Mrs. Gray drew herself up to utter a stern "
30865	30881	30884	30885	Mr. Jones	51	" but for once the mild Rachel checked and contradicted her mother , and said : "
30914	30915	30903	30903	She	555	" "
30925	30934	30923	30923	you	28	" said Jones , hurriedly rising to leave . "
30941	30993	30937	30937	my	0	" whispered Rachel , as she let him out . But Jones had not heard her . Very slowly , and with his hands in his pockets , he walked down the street . He had not grown tired of Mary 's company ; why had Mary grown tired of his ? "
31001	31005	30998	30998	I	0	" he thought , "
31010	31063	30998	30998	I	0	" and when he entered the shop , where Mary sat sulking behind the counter , and he told her that she might go back to Miss Gray 's , and when he saw her face light up with pleasure , he forgot that , though natural , it was not pleasant . "
31071	31124	31064	31064	You	826	" he added , smiling . At once , Mary flew upstairs to her room . In less than five minutes , she was down again , and merely nodding to her father as she passed through the shop , off she went , with the light , happy step of youth . "
31129	31134	31064	31064	You	826	" he thought again , "
31140	31202	31064	31064	You	826	" but he sighed . Mrs. Gray took in high dudgeon the consent her daughter had given to the return of Mary Jones . She scarcely looked at that young lady the whole day , and when she was gone , and Jane had retired to her little room , and mother and daughter sat together , Rachel got a lecture . "
31208	31214	31203	31203	You	827	" indignantly said Mrs. Gray . "
31233	31234	31225	31225	you	827	" "
31241	31246	31235	31235	She	828	" gently observed Rachel . "
31258	31262	31256	31256	he	287	" Rachel smiled . "
31273	31277	31265	31265	mother	1485	" she replied . "
31292	31298	31299	31302	The little imperent hussy	833	" angrily resumed Mrs. Gray . "
31323	31333	31314	31314	you	827	" added Mrs. Gray , warming with her subject ; "
31356	31357	31343	31343	I	0	" "
31367	31376	31362	31362	mother	1485	" cried Rachel , alarmed at the threat ; "
31394	31401	31392	31392	mother	1485	" she added with a sigh , "
31419	31726	31403	31403	you	827	" Mrs. Gray remained mute . She looked back in the past for the image of her lost child . She saw a pale face , with blue eyes and fair hair , like Mary 's . Never before had the resemblance struck her ; when it came , it acted with overpowering force on a nature which , though rugged , and stern , and embittered by age and sorrows , was neither cold nor forgetful . One solitary love , but ardent and impassioned , had Sarah Gray known , in her life of three - score and ten — the love of a harsh , but devoted mother for an only child . For that child 's sake had its father , whom she had married more for prudential reasons than for motives of affection , become dear to her heart . He was the father of her Jane . For that child 's sake , had she , without repining , borne the burden of Rachel . Rachel was the sister of her Jane . Never should Rachel want , whilst she had heart and hands to work , and earn her a bit of bread . But when this much - loved child , after ripening to early youth , withered and dropped from the tree of life ; when she was laid to sleep in a premature grave , all trace of the holy and beautiful tenderness which gives its grace to womanhood , seemed to pass away from the bereaved mother 's heart . She became more harsh , more morose than she had ever been , and had it been worth the world 's while to note or record it , of her too it might have been said , as it was of England 's childless King , "
31737	31784	31732	31732	she	840	" And now , when she heard Rachel , when in her mind she compared the living with the dead , strength , pride , fortitude forsook her , her stern features worked , her aged bosom heaved , passionate tears flowed down her wrinkled cheek . "
31794	31802	31732	31732	she	840	" she cried , in broken accents , "
31828	31845	31846	31846	Mother	42	" And she threw her apron over her face , and moaned with bitterness and anguish . "
31858	31913	31914	31914	Rachel	21	" cried Rachel , distressed and alarmed at so unusual a burst of emotion . After a while , Mrs. Gray unveiled her face . It was pale and agitated ; but her tears had ceased . For years they had not flowed , and until her dying day , they flowed no more . "
31916	31929	31914	31914	Rachel	21	" she said , looking in her step - daughter 's face , "
31967	31974	31960	31960	Rachel	21	" here her pale lips quivered , "
32080	32105	32106	32107	The child	685	" Mrs. Gray rose to leave the room . On the threshold , she turned back to say in a low , sad voice : "
32116	32225	32106	32107	The child	685	" Mrs. Gray had never cared about Mary Jones ; she had always thought her what she was indeed — a sickly and peevish child . But now her heart yearned towards the young girl , she herself would have been loth to confess why . Mary took it as a matter of course , Jane wondered , Rachel well knew what had wrought such a change ; but she said nothing , and watched silently . In softened tones , Mrs. Gray now addressed the young girl . If Rachel ventured to chide Mary , though ever so slightly , her step - mother sharply checked her . "
32231	32677	32106	32107	The child	685	" were her mildest words . As to Jane or Mrs. Brown , they both soon learned that Mary Jones was not to be looked at with impunity . Mrs. Gray wondered at them , she did , for teazing the poor little thing . In short , Mary was exalted to the post of favourite to the ruling powers , and she filled it with dignity and consequence . But the watchful eye of Rachel Gray noted other signs . She saw with silent uneasiness , the fading eye , the faltering step , the weakness daily increasing of her step - mother ; and she felt with secret sorrow that she was soon to lose this harsh , yet not unloving or unloved companion of her quiet life . Mrs. Gray complained one day of feeling weak and ailing . She felt worse the next day , and still worse on the third . And thus , day by day , she slowly declined without hope of recovery . Mrs. Gray had a strong , though narrow mind , and a courageous heart . She heard the doctor 's sentence calmly and firmly ; and virtues which she had neglected in life , graced and adorned her last hours and her dying bed . Meek and patient she bore suffering and disease without repining or complaint , and granted herself but one indulgence : the sight and presence of Mary . The young girl was kinder and more attentive to her old friend than might have been expected from her pettish , indulged nature . She took a sort of pride in keeping Mrs. Gray company , in seeing to Mrs. Gray , as she called it Her little vanity was gratified in having the once redoubtable Mrs. Gray now wholly in her hands , and in some sort a helpless dependent on her good - will and kindness . It may be , too , that she found a not unworthy satisfaction in feeling and proving to the little world around her , that she also was a person of weight and consequence . But her childish kindness availed not . The time of Mrs. Gray had come ; she too was to depart from a world where toil and few joys , and some heavy sorrows had been her portion . Mary and Rachel were alone with her in that hour . Mary was busy about the room . Rachel sat by her mother 's bed . Pale and languid , Mrs. Gray turned to her step - daughter , and gathering her remaining strength to speak , she said feebly : "
32716	32734	32714	32714	Rachel	21	" she added , true to her old spirit of patronizing and misunderstanding her step - daughter , "
32771	32799	32806	32807	dear mother	845	" And Rachel , true to her spirit of humble submission , only smiled , and kissed her mother 's wasted cheek , and said , meekly : "
32818	32864	32806	32807	dear mother	845	" And she did not murmur , even in her heart . She did not find it hard that to the end she should be slighted , and held as one of little worth . A little while after this , Mrs. Gray spoke again . "
32869	32873	32867	32867	Mary	29	" she said . "
32882	32937	32879	32880	Mrs. Gray	22	" said Mary , coming up to her on the other side of the bed . Mrs. Gray smiled , and stretched out her trembling hands , until they met and clasped those of the young girl . Then , with her fading eyes fixed on Mary 's face , she said to Rachel : "
32951	32952	32949	32949	you	21	" "
32957	32966	32955	32955	mother	1485	" replied Rachel , in a low tone . "
32969	32980	32967	32967	Rachel	21	" she said again , and her weak voice rose , "
33001	33035	32996	32997	the Lord	1489	" Tears streamed down Rachel 's face on hearing those few words that paid her for many a bitter hour ; but her mother saw them not , still her look sought Mary . "
33047	33139	33140	33140	he	864	" she murmured , and with her look still fastened on little Mary 's pale face , she died . Sad and empty seemed the house to Rachel Gray when her mother was gone . She missed her chiding voice , her step , heavy with age , her very scolding , which long habit had made light to bear . The solitude and liberty once so dear and so hardly won , now became painful and oppressive ; but Rachel was not long troubled with either . We are told that "
33147	33208	33144	33144	He	864	" and Rachel was not unloved , for she , too , was to have her share of affliction . Spite her sickly aspect , she enjoyed good health , and , therefore , when she rose one morning , shortly after her mother 's death , and felt unusually languid and unwell , Rachel was more surprised than alarmed . "
33219	33230	33231	33231	I	0	" exclaimed Jane , laying down her work with concern . "
33238	33244	33231	33231	I	0	" replied Rachel , calmly , "
33255	33445	33246	33246	I	0	" she added , smiling . Her looks belied her words ; vainly she endeavoured to work ; by the united entreaties of Jane and Mary , she was at length persuaded to go up to her room . She laid down on her bed , and tried to sleep , but could not ; she thought of her step - mother , so harsh , yet so kind in her very harshness ; of her father , so cold and unloving ; of her silent , lonely life , and its narrow cares and narrow duties , above which smiled so heavenly a hope , burning like a clear star above a dark and rugged valley ; and with these thoughts and feelings , heightening them to intensity , blended the heat and languor of growing fever . When Mary came up to know if Rachel Gray wanted anything , she found her so ill that she could scarcely answer her question . She grew rapidly worse . The medical man who was called in , pronounced her disease a slow fever , not dangerous , but wasting . "
33455	33460	33461	33461	I	0	" resignedly said Rachel , "
33483	33484	33479	33479	God	31	" "
33496	33501	33504	33504	we	868	" zealously said Jane , "
33508	33509	33506	33506	Mary	29	" "
33515	33580	33512	33512	we	868	" as zealously replied the young girl . Rachel smiled at their earnestness ; but their zeal was destined to be thrown in the shade by that of a third individual . On the fourth day of her illness , Rachel was awakened from a heavy sleep into which she had fallen , by the sound of angry though subdued voices on the staircase . "
33601	33611	33581	33581	I	0	" said the deep , emphatic tones of Jane . "
33623	33704	33581	33581	I	0	" obstinately exclaimed the shrill French voice of Madame Rose . Jane , who was not patient , now apparently resorted to that last argument of kings and nations , physical force , to remove the intruder , for there was the sound of a scuffle on the staircase , but if she had strength on her side , Madame Rose had agility , and though somewhat ruffled and out of breath , she victoriously burst into Rachel 's room . "
33713	33722	33708	33708	Miss	869	" screamed Jane , rushing up after her , "
33738	33739	33731	33731	I	0	" "
33747	33762	33745	33745	Jane	27	" said Rachel , as the alarmed apprentice made her appearance at the door , "
33790	34256	33772	33772	I	0	" she added , as Jane stared grimly at the intruder . She spoke so positively , that the apprentice retired , but not without emphatically intimating that she should be within call if Miss Gray wanted her . Rachel was too ill to speak much ; but Madame Rose spared her the trouble by taking that task on herself ; indeed , she seemed willing to take a great deal on herself , and listless as Rachel was , she perceived with surprise that Madame Rose was in some measure taking possession of her sick room . She inquired after Mimi . Madame Rose shook her head , produced a square pocket - handkerchief , applied it to her eyes , then turned them up , till the whites alone were visible ; in short , she plainly intimated that Mimi had gone to her last home ; after which she promptly dried her tears , and , partly by speech , partly by pantomime , she informed Rachel that the apprentices were too busy sewing to be able to attend on her , and that she — Madame Rose — would undertake that care . Rachel was too ill and languid to resist ; and Jane and Mary , though they resented the intrusion of the foreigner , were unable to eject her , for , by possession , which is acknowledged to be nine - tenths of the law , Madame Rose made her claim good , until the enemy had abandoned all idea of resistance . And a devoted nurse she made , ever attentive , ever vigilant . For three months did Rachel see , in her darkened room , the active little figure of the Frenchwoman , either moving briskly about , or sitting erect in her chair , knitting assiduously , occasionally relieved , it is true , by Jane and Mary . She saw it when she lay in the trance of fever and pain , unable to move or speak ; in her few moments of languid relief , it was still there , and it became so linked , in her mind , with her sick room , that , when she awoke one day free from fever , the delightful sensation that pain was gone from her , like the weary dream of a troubled night fled in the morning , blended with a sense of surprise and annoyance at missing the nod and the smile of Madame Rose . Rachel looked around her wondering , and in looking , she caught sight of the portly and vulgar figure of Mrs. Brown ; she saw her with some surprise , for she knew that that lady entertained a strong horror of a sick room . "
34262	34271	34260	34260	me	0	" said Mrs. Brown , nodding at her . "
34281	34282	34272	34272	You	871	" "
34290	34293	34283	34283	I	0	" replied Rachel "
34317	34331	34315	34315	you	871	" added Mrs. Brown , with another nod , and a knowing wink . "
34336	34340	34333	34334	Madame Rose	47	" said Rachel , "
34346	34347	34343	34344	Madame Rose	47	" "
34364	34475	34362	34362	you	871	" Mrs. Brown spoke impatiently . Rachel felt too weak to dispute her authority , but when Jane came up , she again inquired after Madame Rose . Jane drily said it was all right , and that Miss Gray was to keep quiet ; and more than this she would not say . The fever had left Rachel . She was now cured , and rapidly got better ; but still , she did not see Madame Rose , and was favoured with more of Mrs. Brown 's company than she liked . At length she one day positively exacted an explanation from Jane , who reluctantly gave it . "
34482	34487	34480	34480	Miss	1495	" she said , ' "
34558	34559	34549	34549	she	32	" "
34567	34704	34563	34564	Mrs. Brown	32	" asked Rachel , who had heard her with much surprise . Jane looked embarrassed , but was spared the trouble of replying by the voice of Mrs. Brown , who imperatively summoned her downstairs . She immediately complied , and left Rachel alone . A mild sun shone in through the open window on the sick girl ; she had that day got up , for the first time , and sat in a chair with a book on her knees . But she could not read : she felt too happy , blest in that delightful sense of returning health which long sickness renders so sweet . Her whole soul overflowed with joy , thankfulness , and prayer , and for once the shadow of sad or subduing thoughts fell not on her joy . "
34718	34747	34563	34564	Mrs. Brown	32	" said the rough voice of Mrs. Brown , who entered without the ceremony of knocking . Rachel quietly replied that she felt well — almost quite well . "
34761	34766	34767	34767	La	0	" said Mrs. Brown . "
34826	34827	34825	34825	I.	0	" "
34834	34842	34831	34832	Mrs. Brown	32	" interrupted Rachel , with a start . "
34861	34862	34856	34856	you	32	" "
34869	34875	34865	34865	I	0	" replied Rachel , confounded . "
34885	34893	34879	34880	a muff	1501	" good - humouredly observed Mrs. Brown . "
34944	35017	35020	35020	Rachel	21	" Rachel was dismayed at the amount of the debt . When and how should she be able to pay so large a sum ? Still , rallying from her first feeling of surprise and dismay , she attempted to express to Mrs. Brown her gratitude for the assistance so generously yielded , and her hope of being able to repay it some day ; but Mrs. Brown would not hear her . "
35022	35026	35020	35020	Rachel	21	" she said , "
35099	35453	35454	35454	I	0	" This was kindness — such Rachel felt it to be ; but , alas ! she also felt that these was on her , from that day , the badge of obligation and servitude . She was still too weak to work ; she had , dining her long illness , lost the best part of her customers ; until her full recovery , she was , perforce , cast on Mrs. Brown for assistance , and , of all persons , Mrs. Brown was the last not to take advantage of such a state of things . Mrs. Brown came when she liked , said what she liked , and did what she liked in Rachel 's house . But , indeed , it was not Rachel 's house — it was Mrs. Brown 's . Rachel was there on sufferance ; the very bed on which she slept was Mrs. Brown 's ; the very chair on which she sat was Mrs. Brown 's . So Mrs. Brown felt , and made every one feel , Rachel included . The effects of her rule were soon apparent . Every article of furniture changed its place ; every household nook was carefully examined and improved , and every luckless individual who entertained a lingering kindness for Rachel Gray , was affronted , and effectually banished from the house , from irascible Madame Rose down to peaceful Mr. Jones . Rachel carried patience to a fault ; through her whole life , she had been taught to suffer and endure silently , and now , burdened with the sense of her debt and obligation , she knew not how to resist the domestic tyranny of this new tormentor . The easiest course was to submit . To Rachel it seemed that such , in common gratitude , was her duty ; and , accordingly , she submitted . But this was a time of probation and trial : as such she ever looked back to it , in after life . To Jane , her patience seemed amazing , and scarcely commendable . "
35468	35474	35465	35465	I	0	" she said , emphatically . "
35480	35484	35475	35476	Mrs. Brown	32	" said Rachel , "
35510	35511	35502	35502	I	0	" "
35516	35522	35502	35502	I	0	" echoed Jane , indignantly , "
35534	35622	35528	35528	she	32	" But Rachel would hear no more on the subject . If she bore with Mrs. Brown , it was not to murmur at her behind her back . Yet she was not so insensible to what she endured , but that she felt it a positive relief when Mrs. Brown went and paid one of her nieces a visit in the country , and for a few weeks delivered the house of her presence . Internally , Rachel accused herself of ingratitude because she felt glad . "
35633	35638	35630	35630	I	0	" she remorsefully thought , "
35650	35726	35640	35640	I	0	" Her health was now restored . She had found some work to do ; with time she knew she should be able to pay Mrs. Brown . Her mind recovered its habitual tone ; old thoughts , old feelings , laid by during the hour of trial and sickness , but never forsaken , returned to her now , and time , as it passed on , matured a great thought in her heart . "
35730	35741	35640	35640	I	0	" she often asked herself , in her waking dreams , "
35780	35979	35980	35980	I	0	" Yet it was not at once that Rachel acted on these thoughts . Never since he had received her so coldly , had she crossed her father 's threshold ; but often , in the evening , she had walked up and down before his door , looking at him through the shop window with sad and earnest eyes , never seeking for more than that stolen glance , though still with the persistency of a fond heart , she looked forward to a happier future . And thus she lingered until one morning , when she rose , nerved her heart , and went out ; calmly resolved to bear as others , to act . She went to her father 's house . She found him sturdy and stern , planing with the vigour of a man in the prime of life . His brow became clouded , as he saw and recognized his daughter 's pale face and shrinking figure . Still he bade her come in , for she stood on the threshold timidly waiting for a welcome ; and his ungraciousness was limited to the cold question of what had brought her . "
35989	36007	35987	35987	father	692	" was her mild reply . And as to this Thomas Gray said nothing , Rachel added : "
36013	36014	36015	36015	I	0	" "
36027	36032	36015	36015	I	0	" he drily answered . "
36038	36042	36045	36045	she	710	" resumed Rachel , "
36065	36106	36048	36048	she	710	" A frown knit the rugged brow of Thomas Gray . His late wife had had a sharp temper of her own ; and perhaps he thought himself as much sinned against as sinning . But he made no comment . "
36109	36126	36107	36107	Father	74	" said Rachel , speaking from her very heart , and looking earnestly in his face , "
36135	36164	36128	36128	I	0	" Thomas Gray looked steadily at his daughter , and did not reply . But Rachel , resolved not to be easily disheartened , persisted none the less . "
36167	36182	36128	36128	I	0	" she resumed , and her voice faltered with the depth of her emotion , "
36253	36261	36262	36262	she	0	" I am now your only child , "
36271	36320	36322	36322	Rachel	21	" the only living thing of your blood , not one relative have I in this wide world ; and you , father , you too are alone . Let me come to live with you . Pray let me ! If my presence is irksome to you , "
36340	36353	36354	36354	she	0	" I shall keep out of the way . Indeed , indeed , "
36362	36366	36354	36354	she	0	" I shall . "
36381	36392	36378	36378	he	74	" Rachel , what did I go to America for ? "
36408	36419	36420	36420	he	74	" And what did I come to live here for ? "
36438	36443	36444	36444	he	74	" To be alone , "
36454	36459	36448	36448	he	74	" to be alone . "
36569	36577	36558	36558	she	21	" Might she come to see him ? "
36578	36582	36583	36583	he	74	" What for ? "
36587	36596	36599	36599	Rachel	21	" To see how you are , father , "
36601	36606	36607	36607	he	74	" How I am , "
36618	36632	36607	36607	he	74	" and why should n't I be well , just tell me that ? "
36633	36644	36646	36646	Rachel	21	" It might please Providence to afflict you with sickness , "
36648	36653	36654	36654	he	74	" Sickness , sickness , "
36659	36687	36654	36654	he	74	" I tell you , woman , I never was sick in my life . Is there the sign of illness , or of disease upon me ? "
36688	36699	36745	36745	she	21	" No , indeed , father , there is not . "
36700	36726	36727	36727	he	74	" And could you find a man of my age half so healthy , and so strong as I am — just tell me that ? "
36749	36760	36745	36745	she	21	" I have seen stronger men than you , father . "
36761	36770	36771	36771	he	74	" Oh I you have — have you ! "
36793	36811	36790	36790	she	21	" And strong or weak , father , are we not all in the hands of God ? "
36847	36850	36851	36851	she	21	" Father , "
36856	36891	36851	36851	she	21	" you do not want me now ; I know and see it , but if ever you should — and that time may come , pray , father , pray send for me . "
36892	36904	36906	36907	Thomas Gray	40	" Want you ? and what should I want you for ? "
36909	36948	36949	36949	He	40	" I can not tell , I do not know ; but you might want me . Remember , that if you do , you have but to send for me . I am willing , ever willing . "
37179	37193	37159	37159	she	29	" Oh ! dear , dear Miss Gray ! I am so miserable . "
37194	37200	37161	37161	her	29	" What for , child ? "
37205	37214	37216	37216	Mary	29	" He 's gone — he 's gone ! "
37218	37226	37216	37216	Mary	29	" Who is gone , my dear ? "
37434	37440	37441	37441	he	51	" It stands to reason , "
37447	37459	37441	37441	he	51	" it 's business , you see , it 's business . "
37595	37600	37581	37583	a young man	911	" Room to let ? "
37601	37606	37608	37608	Jones	51	" Yes , Sir , "
37616	37621	37608	37608	Jones	51	" Back or front ? "
37622	37634	37581	37583	a young man	911	" Front , Sir , front . Capital room , Sir ! "
37635	37638	37581	37583	a young man	911	" Terms ? "
37639	37679	37680	37680	Mary	29	" Five shillings a - week , Sir . A room worth six shillings , anywhere else . Like to see it , Sir ? Mary — Mary , dear , just mind the shop awhile , will you ? "
37716	37722	37724	37725	Mr. Jones	51	" Capital room . Sir ! "
37730	37758	37759	37759	he	51	" real Brussels carpet ; portrait of Her Majesty above the mantel - piece ; and that bed , Sir — just feel that bed , Sir , "
37775	37796	37759	37759	he	51	" very cheerful look - out , too ; the railroad just hard by — see all the trains passing . "
37820	37839	37816	37816	his	1735	" Take four shillings for it ? Yes . Well then , I 'll come to - night . "
37860	37871	37873	37873	Mary	29	" Well , father , have you let the room ? "
37893	37898	37899	37899	he	287	" Well , child , "
37902	37921	37899	37899	he	287	" I suppose I may say I have , for the young man is coming to - night . "
37922	37928	37931	37931	Mary	29	" What 's his name ? "
37933	37953	37931	37931	Mary	29	" I 'm blest if I know ; he never told me , nor gave me time to ask . "
37954	37977	37899	37899	he	287	" But , father , you do n't mean to say you let the room to him , without knowing his name ? "
37978	37989	37991	37992	Mr. Jones	51	" But I did n't let the room to him , "
37994	38001	37991	37992	Mr. Jones	51	" it was he took it . "
38002	38009	38011	38011	Mary	29	" Well , that 's queer ! "
38013	38023	38025	38026	the grocer	1804	" Queer ! I call it more than queer ! "
38038	38061	38025	38026	the grocer	1804	" but he sha n't sleep in it , though , till I 've got his references , I can tell him . "
38080	38087	38088	38088	he	1804	" My name is Joseph Saunders , "
38093	38124	38088	38088	he	1804	" and if you want to know more , apply to Mr. Smithson , number thirteen , in the alley hard by . He 'll give you all the particulars . "
38182	38191	38192	38192	he	1804	" P'r'aps you 'd like the first week , "
38228	38234	38235	38235	she	29	" He looks quite superior , "
38238	38251	38235	38235	she	29	" quite . Saunders — Joseph Saunders ! what a nice name . "
38252	38259	38261	38262	her father	287	" That 's all very well , "
38272	38296	38235	38235	she	29	" but I must have a word or two to say with Mr. Smithson — for all that his name is Joseph Saunders . "
38360	38367	38369	38369	Jones	29	" Good - morning to you , "
38376	38381	38369	38369	Jones	29	" Good - morning ! "
38399	38423	38388	38389	Mr. Smithson	77	" I have just come round to inquire about a young man — his name is Joseph Saunders . Do you know him ? "
38424	38429	38431	38432	Mr. Smithson	77	" S'pose I do ? "
38439	38459	38431	38432	Mr. Smithson	77	" Well then , s'pose you do — you can tell me something about him , ca n't you ? "
38460	38464	38467	38469	the earthenware dealer	929	" What for ? "
38471	38475	38477	38478	Mr. Jones	51	" What for ! "
38486	38527	38477	38478	Mr. Jones	51	" why , because he 's taken my front room , and I want to know what sort of a chap he is , and because , too , he has referred me to you — that 's what for . "
38528	38533	38535	38536	Mr. Smithson	77	" Well , then , "
38538	38568	38535	38536	Mr. Smithson	77	" I 'll just tell you this : first , he 'll pay his rent ; second , he 'll give no trouble ; third , that 's all . "
38593	38600	38602	38603	Mr. Jones	51	" And what does he do ? "
38612	38627	38630	38631	Mr. Smithson	77	" If you was to stay here from now till to - morrow morning , "
38633	38642	38630	38631	Mr. Smithson	77	" you 'd know no more from me . "
38694	38699	38702	38702	Mary	29	" Well , father , "
38712	38730	38702	38702	Mary	29	" who is he ? What is he ? What does he do ? Is he married — "
38731	38736	38738	38739	Mr. Jones	51	" Bless the girl ! "
38741	38784	38738	38739	Mr. Jones	51	" how am I to know all that ? He 'll pay his rent , and he 's respectable , and more do n't concern us ; and it 's time for you to go to Miss Gray , ai n't it ? "
38809	38819	38805	38806	Mr. Jones	51	" a very buttoned - up sort of chap ; "
38973	38976	38977	38977	he	51	" Now , "
38980	39069	38977	38977	he	51	" if I could secure such a young fellow as that ; it would be a capital thing for me , and in time not a bad one for him . For suppose , that he becomes a Co. , and marries Mary , why the house is his , that 's all . Now I should like to know what man in the city will say to him : ' Saunders , I 'll make a Co. of you , and you shall have my daughter . ' "
39132	39137	39140	39140	Jones	51	" Going , Sir ? "
39142	39146	39148	39150	the young man	922	" Why yes ! "
39152	39192	39148	39150	the young man	922	" I have found a situation , and so I am off naturally . My week is up to - morrow , I believe , but not having given notice , I shall pay for next , of course . "
39221	39228	39229	39229	he	51	" Pray do n't mention it , "
39233	39252	39229	39229	he	51	" your time 's up to - morrow , and so there 's an end of it all . "
39282	39309	39268	39269	Mr. Saunders	76	" No , no , Mr. Jones , what 's fair is fair . I gave no notice , and so here are your four shillings . "
39512	39520	39508	39508	he	51	" He 's got a new situation , "
39846	39945	39826	39826	He	51	" Cheer up , Mary ; law bless you girl , well have lots of lodgers yet ; and as to that Saunders , I do n't so much care about it , now he 's gone . He was a clever fellow , but he had n't got no capital , and as to taking a Co. without capital , why none but a good - natured easy fellow like me would dream of such a thing now a days ; but , as I said , we 'll have lots of lodgers — lots of lodgers . "
39946	39958	39960	39960	Mary	29	" We never had but that one all them nine months , "
39965	39972	39974	39975	her father	287	" They 're all a coming , "
39978	39985	39974	39975	her father	287	" They 're all a coming . "
40142	40158	40137	40137	she	21	" I must submit — it is the will of God , I must submit . "
40168	40178	40137	40137	she	21	" Father , Father why hast thou forsaken me ! "
40452	40491	40492	40492	She	21	" God Almighty had not given him a child , she felt , to treat it thus , with mingled dislike and contempt Were there none to receive his slights and his scorn , but his own daughter ? "
40587	40594	40548	40548	she	21	" And why not try again ? "
40600	40624	40548	40548	she	21	" the kingdom of Heaven is taken by storm — and what is the kingdom of Heaven , but the realm of love ? "
40714	40721	40722	40722	she	21	" If he rejects me now , "

As to bringing your father here , you must have been mad to think of it ; for , if you ca n't support yourself , how can you support him ? However , it 's lucky I 'm come in time to set all to rights . What 's his parish ? Marylebone , ai n't it ? I shall see the overseer this very day , and manage that for you ; and it 's just as well , "

49580	49593	49546	49546	Saunders	76	" Where was the use , when he could not go on ? "
49704	49709	49711	49711	Saunders	76	" I thought so , "
50155	50161	50162	50162	she	29	" She felt very well , "
50188	50191	50192	50192	she	21	" Mary , "
50200	50211	50192	50192	she	21	" what ails you ? Your breath seems quite short . "
50212	50220	50222	50222	Mary	29	" La ! bless you , Miss , "
50229	50235	50222	50222	Mary	29	" I am all right . "
50286	50289	50290	50290	she	21	" Mary , "
50293	50306	50290	50290	she	21	" do not work any more to - day — go home . "
50329	50338	50339	50339	she	29	" Why , Miss , you are crying ! "
50344	50348	50350	50350	Rachel	21	" Am I ? "
50356	50395	50350	50350	Rachel	21	" never mind , Mary ; go home — or , rather , take this parcel to Mrs. Jameson , number three , Albert Terrace . It is a fine day — the walk will do you good . "
50422	50429	50405	50405	She	29	" Meet me by moonlight alone . "
50546	50555	50558	50558	Rachel	21	" I dare say Mary feels it too , "
50560	50611	50558	50558	Rachel	21	" Of course she does , Miss Gray — of course she does . The child has feelings . And then you know , Miss Gray , if that fellow had n't a come there , why , you know , we were getting on as well as could be . "
50612	50619	50621	50621	Rachel	21	" I notice that she coughs , "
50622	50655	50558	50558	Rachel	21	" Why , yes , poor child ; she ca n't get rid of that cough — she 's growing , you see . And then , you see , that Saunders — "
50656	50664	50666	50666	Rachel	21	" And her breathing is so short , "
50668	50689	50666	50666	Rachel	21	" Sure to be , on account of the cough . And , as I was saying , that Saunders — "
50690	50707	50710	50710	Rachel	21	" But , Mr. Jones , do n't you think you had better see a doctor ? "
50712	50717	50719	50719	Jones	51	" See a doctor ! "
50725	50740	50719	50719	Jones	51	" You do n't mean to say my child is ill , Miss Gray ? "
50741	50754	50756	50756	Rachel	21	" I do n't think she is quite well , Mr. Jones , "
50827	50835	50836	50836	he	51	" The doctor must see her directly , "
50839	50894	50836	50836	he	51	" directly . I 'll go and look for him , and you 'll send her round . It 's nothing — nothing at all , I am sure ; she 's growing , you see . But still , it must be attended to , you know — it must be attended to . "
50942	50952	50931	50931	Rachel	21	" Mary , Mary , your father wants you . "
51033	51048	51049	51049	she	29	" Well , what ails you two , that you stare at me so , "
51054	51060	51061	51061	she	29	" I am so hot , "
51068	51084	51061	51061	she	29	" I think I shall stay at home , as you said . Miss Gray . "
51149	51156	51159	51159	Rachel	21	" What ails you , dear ? "
51173	51194	51166	51166	she	21	" La ! bless you . Miss Gray , I am quite well — only I feel so faint like . "
51288	51294	51296	51296	Rachel	21	" I must go now , "
51298	51312	51296	51296	Rachel	21	" but I shall come back this evening , and bring my work . "
51335	51349	51330	51330	Mary	29	" Oh ! do Miss Gray , come and take tea with us . "
51451	51462	51464	51464	Rachel	21	" I shall try and not be too long away , "
51470	51474	51475	51475	he	51	" Never mind , "
51482	51486	51479	51479	his	51	" never mind . "
51487	51497	51499	51500	Mrs. Brown	32	" There 's a precious old fool for you ! "
51714	51721	51722	51722	he	287	" The child 's only growing , "
51727	51747	51722	51722	he	287	" only growing ; a little rest and a little medicine , and she 'll be all right again . "
51763	51769	51770	51770	she	21	" My poor little Mary , "
51773	51779	51770	51770	she	21	" my poor little Mary ! "
51807	51812	51813	51813	she	21	" Well , ma'am , "
51816	51821	51813	51813	she	21	" well , ma'am ! "
51822	51832	51835	51835	Rachel	21	" Oh ! pray do not — do not ! "
52388	52394	52397	52397	her	21	" Thy will be done , "
52438	52449	52433	52433	Rachel	21	" I forgive that woman — I forgive her freely . "
52948	52951	52898	52898	her	1289	" sudden death "
52981	52986	52978	52979	Rachel Gray	21	" as a proof , "
52991	52998	52978	52979	Rachel Gray	21	" of her admiration and respect . "
53009	53018	53019	53019	she	21	" Thank God ! That I forgave her ! "
53022	53026	53019	53019	she	21	" thank God ! "
53278	53284	53273	53274	Richard Jones	51	" Mary was so young ! "
53343	53349	53351	53351	he	51	" there is no hope ! "
53564	53572	53573	53573	she	29	" in order to mind the shop , "
53667	53670	53673	53673	Mary	29	" Father , "
53675	53685	53673	53673	Mary	29	" why did you shut the shop so early ? "
53702	53712	53715	53715	Jones	51	" Where 's the use of leaving it open ? "
53717	53732	53715	53715	Jones	51	" unless it 's to see them all going to the two Teapots opposite . "
53733	53743	53744	53744	she	1323	" Well , but I wish you had not , "
53747	53756	53744	53744	she	1323	" it looks so dull and so dark . "
53786	53792	53794	53794	Mary	29	" There 's Miss Gray , "
53834	53844	53845	53845	she	1323	" You do not look well , Mr. Jones , "
53848	53856	53857	53857	he	51	" Do n't I , Miss Gray , "
53865	53876	53877	53877	he	51	" well , that 's a wonder ! Look here ! "
53897	53901	53902	53902	he	51	" look here , "
53925	53976	53978	53978	he	51	" look here ; there 's a shop for you , Miss Gray . How long ago is it since you , and your mother , and Mary and I we settled that shop ? Look at it now , I say — look at it now . Look here ! "
53986	53992	53994	53994	he	51	" empty ! Look there ! "
54004	54061	54063	54063	he	51	" empty ! Do you wish to try the drawers ? Oh ! they are all labelled , but what 's in 'em . Miss Gray ? nothing ! It 's well the customers have left off coming ; for I could n't serve them ; could n't accommodate them , I am sorry to say , "
54068	54077	54078	54078	he	51	" I was happy when I came here , "
54081	54156	54078	54078	he	51	" I had hope ; I thought there was an opening ; I thought there was room for me . I set up this shop ; I did it all up myself , as you know — every inch of it ; I painted it ; I put the fixtures in ; I drove every nail in with my own hand , and what 's been the upshot of it all , Miss Gray ? "
54166	54174	54175	54175	she	21	" It is the will of God , "
54178	54189	54175	54175	she	21	" and God knows best , for He is good . "
54228	54232	54233	54233	he	51	" Miss Gray , "
54236	54316	54233	54233	he	51	" I have worked from my youth — slaved some would say ; I hoped to make out something for myself and my child , and it was more of her than of myself I thought I wronged none ; I did my best ; a rich man steps in , and I am bewared — and you tell me God is good — mind , I do n't say he aint — but is he good to me ? "
54427	54432	54433	54433	she	21	" God is good , "
54453	54461	54462	54462	he	51	" And my child , Miss Gray , "
54479	54543	54462	54462	he	51	" going by inches before my very eyes ; yet I must look on and not go mad . I must be beggared , and I must bear it ; I must become childless , and I must bear it . And the wicked thrive , and the wicked 's children outlive them , for God is good to them , Miss Gray . "
54557	54563	54564	54564	she	21	" Ah ! Mr. Jones , "
54567	54578	54564	54564	she	21	" do not complain ; you have loved your child . "
54579	54589	54595	54595	Mary	29	" What are you keeping Miss Gray there for ? "
54597	54602	54595	54595	Mary	29	" I want her . "
54603	54611	54613	54613	Rachel	21	" And here I am , dear , "
54620	54645	54613	54613	Rachel	21	" I am come to sit a while with you ; for I am sure your poor father wants rest , does he not ? "
54646	54658	54661	54661	Mary	29	" I do n't want any one to sit with me , "
54663	54673	54661	54661	Mary	29	" I am not so ill as all that . "
54674	54682	54613	54613	Rachel	21	" But do you sleep at night ? "
54683	54694	54613	54613	Rachel	21	" No , I can't — I am so feverish . "
54695	54710	54712	54713	her father	287	" Well , then , we sit up with you to keep you company , "
54896	54901	54903	54903	Rachel	21	" yes , now , "
54905	54913	54903	54903	Rachel	21	" now is the time to speak . "
54980	54991	54992	54992	she	29	" I shall be glad when I am well again , "
54995	55025	54992	54992	she	29	" I am tired of this little room ; it seems so dull when I see the sun shine in the street , do n't it , Miss Gray ? "
55026	55051	55067	55067	she	29	" I dare say it does : you remind me of a little story I once read ; shall I tell it to you ? "
55052	55059	55062	55062	Mary	29	" Oh ! yes you may , "
55075	55083	55085	55085	Rachel	21	" It is not a long story , "
55088	55124	55085	55085	Rachel	21	" and here it is ; a king was once hunting alone in a wood , when he heard a very beautiful voice singing very sweetly ; he went on and saw a poor leper . "
55125	55131	55133	55133	Mary	29	" What 's a leper ? "
55135	55258	55259	55259	Mary	29	" Do n't you remember the lepers in the Gospel , who were made clean by our Saviour ? they were poor things , who had a bad and loathsome complaint , and this man , whom the king heard singing , was one ; and the king could not help saying to him , ' how can you sing when you seem in so wretched a condition ? ' But the leper replied , ' it is because I am in this state that I sing , for as my body decays , I know that the hour of my deliverance draws nigh , that I shall leave this miserable world , and go to my Lord and my God . ' "
55275	55282	55283	55283	she	29	" Well but , Miss Gray , "
55289	55308	55283	55283	she	29	" what is there like me in this story ; I am not a leper , am I ? "
55309	55315	55318	55318	Rachel	21	" We are all lepers , "
55320	55376	55318	55318	Rachel	21	" for we are all sinners , and sin is to the soul what leprosy is to the body ; it defiles it , and we all should be glad to die ; for Christ has conquered death , and with death sin ends , and our true life , the life in God begins . "
55392	55396	55397	55397	she	29	" Miss Gray , "
55400	55406	55397	55397	she	29	" what do you mean ? "
55416	55426	55428	55428	Mary	29	" Why do you tell me all these things ? "
55437	55441	55443	55443	Mary	29	" Miss Gray , "
55445	55452	55443	55443	Mary	29	" am I going to die ? "
55535	55564	55523	55523	she	21	" Mary , we must all obey the will of God ; we came into this world at His will , at His will we must leave it . "
55565	55575	55577	55577	Mary	29	" And must I leave it , Miss Gray ? "
55605	55611	55612	55612	she	21	" yes , my darling , "
55616	55640	55612	55612	she	21	" yes , you must leave this miserable earth of trouble and sorrow , and go to God your friend and your father . "
55670	55678	55679	55679	she	21	" Do n't cry , Miss Gray , "
55682	55707	55679	55679	she	21	" I do n't cry ; but do you know , it seems so odd that I should die , does n't it now ? "
55732	55740	55741	55741	she	29	" I wish you would not fret , "
55744	55761	55741	55741	she	29	" I wish you would not . Miss Gray . I do n't , you see . "
55762	55765	55767	55767	Rachel	21	" Ay , "
55769	55786	55767	55767	Rachel	21	" you do not , my poor child , for what do you know of death ? "
55912	55931	55906	55906	Rachel	21	" Shall we dare to limit for ourselves , or for others , the unfathomed mercy of God ? "
55932	55935	55936	55936	she	29	" Father , "
55940	55948	55936	55936	she	29	" I want to speak to you . "
55949	55957	55958	55958	he	287	" What is it , my darling ? "
55990	55993	55994	55994	she	29	" Father , "
55997	56009	55994	55994	she	29	" I have been a naughty child , have I not ? "
56010	56025	55966	55966	She	29	" No — no , my little pet , never , indeed , never . "
56026	56078	56079	56079	she	29	" I know I have been naughty , father ; I ' have been , ' oh ! so cross at times ; but , father , I could not help it — at least , it seemed as if I could not — my back ached so , and indeed , "
56086	56097	56079	56079	she	29	" I am very sorry , father , very sorry . "
56124	56133	56134	56134	she	29	" You forgive me , do n't you ? "
56138	56148	56134	56134	she	29	" Forgive you ! my pet — my darling . "
56149	56155	56156	56156	she	29	" Yes , pray do , "
56199	56202	56203	56203	she	29	" Father ! "
56206	56216	56203	56203	she	29	" why do n't you take down the shutters ? "
56252	56266	56247	56247	himself	1352	" ' Tis early yet ; ' tis very early , my darling . "
56267	56272	56273	56273	she	29	" No ' taint , "
56293	56323	56284	56284	she	29	" Ah ! I forget — I forget . I did not mean to be cross again . Indeed I did not , father , so pray forgive me . "
56324	56340	56277	56277	her	29	" Do n't think of it , my pet . Do you wish for anything ? "
56341	56355	56356	56356	He	1352	" Nothing , father , but that you would take down the shutters . "
56377	56382	56383	56383	she	29	" Because you see , "
56389	56418	56383	56383	she	29	" the customers will all be coming and wondering if they see the shop shut ; and they will think me worse , and so — and so — "
56433	56441	56427	56427	she	29	" And so you see , father . "
56474	56486	56467	56467	he	287	" My darling , did you say your prayers this morning ? "
56499	56504	56505	56505	she	29	" I had forgotten , "
56510	56517	56505	56505	she	29	" I shall say them now . "
56528	56536	56537	56537	she	29	" Our father who art in heaven , "
56679	56685	56686	56686	he	51	" It 's all right , "
56689	56703	56686	56686	he	51	" I know , the landlord could scarcely help it ; come in . "
56725	56737	56738	56738	he	1363	" You are a trump ! that 's what you are , "
56760	56767	56769	56770	the bailiff	1363	" Halloo ! what 's that ? "
56780	56784	56786	56786	Jones	51	" Do n't , "
56807	56818	56802	56802	he	771	" I am very sorry — I am very sorry . "
56819	56826	56829	56829	Jones	51	" You ca n't help it , "
56831	56838	56829	56829	Jones	51	" you must do your duty . "
56839	56848	56850	56851	the bailiff	1363	" Why that 's what I always say , "
56863	56875	56850	56851	the bailiff	1363	" a man must do his duty , must n't he ? "
56883	56892	56894	56894	Jones	51	" Do n't swear , pray do n't ! "
56896	56906	56894	56894	Jones	51	" And if I do , may I be — "
56921	56929	56930	56930	he	1370	" I ca n't help myself like , "
56936	56960	56930	56930	he	1370	" it 's second natur , you see , second natur . But I 'll try and not do it — I'll try . "
56988	56994	56995	56995	he	1370	" Make yourself at home , "
57002	57023	56995	56995	he	1370	" I think you 'll find all you want in that cupboard , at least ' tis all I have . "
57033	57043	57045	57046	the bailiff	1363	" All I want , and all you have , "
57054	57066	57045	57046	the bailiff	1363	" Then faith , my poor fellow , ' tain't much . "
57105	57116	57100	57100	Jones	51	" You do n't want for anything , do you ? "
57117	57121	57124	57125	the bailiff	1363	" Why no , "
57139	57166	57167	57167	He	1363	" thank you , I ca n't say I want for anything , but what have you to say to a glass of grog , eh ? "
57175	57184	57187	57187	Jones	51	" I 'll send for anything you like , "
57216	57220	57222	57222	Jones	51	" Well then , "
57229	57237	57222	57222	Jones	51	" I 'll leave you for awhile . "
57238	57246	57248	57250	the other staring	1376	" Why , where are you going ? "
57252	57255	57257	57257	Jones	51	" There , "
57587	57591	57593	57594	a neighbour	986	" Only think ! "
57599	57620	57593	57594	a neighbour	986	" Mr. Jones 's shutters have been closed the whole day . I ca n't think what the matter is . "
57621	57626	57628	57629	Mrs. Smith	50	" Ca n't you , "
57632	57642	57628	57629	Mrs. Smith	50	" why , woman , the shop is shut . "
58081	58089	58090	58090	she	21	" Mr. Jones , you must come ! "
58321	58330	58331	58331	he	771	" It do n't matter . Miss Gray , "
58334	58340	58331	58331	he	771	" it do n't matter . "
58627	58633	58665	58665	he	76	" Mr. Jones is within , "
58637	58647	58650	58650	Saunders	76	" And I just want to speak to him , "
58652	58658	58659	58659	He	76	" so that 's lucky . "
58709	58713	58703	58703	he	76	" good evening . "
58714	58723	58725	58725	Saunders	76	" Sorry to hear you have been ill , "
58729	58740	58725	58725	Saunders	76	" but you are coming round , ai n't you ? "
58741	58747	58703	58703	he	76	" I am much better , "
58753	58759	58762	58762	Saunders	76	" Got anything to do ? "
58764	58769	58771	58771	Jones	51	" Nothing as yet , "
58795	58807	58809	58809	Saunders	76	" Well then , Mr. Jones ; just listen to me ! "
58816	58826	58809	58809	Saunders	76	" I know you have a grudge against me . "
58827	58833	58835	58835	Jones	51	" You have ruined me , "
58837	58854	58856	58856	Saunders	76	" Pshaw , man , ' twas all fair , all in the way of business , "
58861	58867	58869	58869	Jones	51	" You have ruined me , "
58872	58905	58869	58869	Jones	51	" but I forgive you , I have long ago forgiven you , and the shadow of a grudge against you , or living man , I have not , thank God ! "
58906	58913	58916	58916	Saunders	76	" That 's all right enough , "
58918	58960	58916	58916	Saunders	76	" still , Mr. Jones , you say I have ruined you . It is n't the first time either that you have said so , and with some people , I may as well tell you it has injured me . "
58961	58969	58972	58972	Jones	51	" I am sorry if it has , "
58974	58983	58972	58972	Jones	51	" And I do n't care a button , "
58988	59189	58972	58972	Jones	51	" but as I was saying , that 's your belief , your impression ; and to be sure it 's true enough in one sense , but then , Mr. Jones , you should not look at your side of the question only . Mr. Smithson meant to set up a grocer 's shop long before you opened yours ; he spoke to me about it , and if I had only agreed then , it was done ; you came , to be sure , but what of that ? the street was as free to us as to you ; that I lodged in your house was an accident ; I did not know when I took your room that I should supplant you some day . I did not know Smithson had still kept that idea in his head , and that finding no situation I should be glad to consent at last . Well , I did consent , and I did compete with you , and knocked you over , as it were , but Mr. Jones , would not another have done it ? And was it not all honourable , fair play ? "
59190	59198	59201	59201	Jones	51	" Well , I suppose it was , "
59203	59231	59201	59201	Jones	51	" and since it was a settled thing that I was to be a ruined man , I suppose I ought not to care who did it . "
59232	59240	59242	59242	Saunders	76	" Come , that 's talking sense , "
59250	59428	59242	59242	Saunders	76	" and now , Mr. Jones , we 'll come to business , for I need not tell you nor Miss Gray either , that I did not come in here to rip up old sores . You must know that the young fellow who used to serve in my shop has taken himself off , he 's going to Australia , he says , but that 's neither here nor there ; I have a regard for you , Mr. Jones , and having injured you without malice , I should like to do you a good turn of my own free will ; and then there 's my wife , who was quite cut up when she heard you had lost your little daughter , and who has such a regard for Miss Gray , but that 's neither here nor there ; the long and short of it is , will you serve in my shop , and have a good berth and moderate wages , and perhaps an increase if the business prospers ? "
59579	59599	59572	59572	he	90	" I shall be very glad of it , I am very much obliged to you , Mr. Saunders . "
59600	59609	59611	59612	Mr. Saunders	76	" Well , then , it 's done , "
59616	59650	59611	59612	Mr. Saunders	76	" good night , Jones , cheer up , old fellow . Good night , Miss Gray ; Jane sends her love , you know . Sorry the old gentleman 's no better . "
59666	59672	59674	59674	Rachel	21	" Oh ! Mr. Jones ! "
59683	59689	59690	59690	he	90	" Do n't mention it , "
59697	59707	59690	59690	he	90	" I do n't mind it , Miss Gray . "
59708	59717	59718	59718	she	21	" But could you not have stayed here ? "
59721	59741	59690	59690	he	90	" And be a burden upon you I that 's what I have done too long , Miss Gray . "
59742	59755	59805	59805	he	51	" But until you found employment elsewhere , you might have remained . "
59756	59775	59777	59777	Jones	51	" His house is as good as any ; his bread is not more bitter than another 's , "
59784	59802	59777	59777	Jones	51	" besides , now that my Mary is gone , what need I care , Miss Gray ? "
59816	59887	59813	59813	he	51	" You need not pity me , Miss Gray , the bitterness of my trouble is , and has long been over . My Mary is not dead for me . She is , and ever will be , living for her old father , until the day of meeting . And whilst I am waiting for that day , you do not think I care about what befalls me . "
60238	60262	60227	60227	she	21	" We receive blessings from the hand of God , shall we not also take sorrow when it pleases Him to inflict it ? "
60263	60273	60276	60277	Richard Jones	51	" Very true . Miss Gray , very true , "
60304	60327	60328	60328	he	51	" Saunders and his wife were very kind to him , very kind . And I am quite happy , Miss Gray , "
60332	60336	60328	60328	he	51	" quite happy . "
60508	60511	60512	60512	she	21	" Father ! "
60515	60521	60512	60512	she	21	" do you know me ? "
60582	60590	60575	60575	she	21	" Father , do you know me ? "
60616	60619	60603	60603	he	40	" Rachel . "
60639	60645	60646	60646	he	40	" Never mind , Rachel , "
60649	60653	60646	60646	he	40	" never mind . "
60654	60659	60660	60660	she	21	" Father , father , "
60663	60673	60660	60660	she	21	" you know me , say you know me . "
60701	60707	60708	60708	he	40	" Never mind , Rachel , "
60712	60716	60708	60708	he	40	" never mind . "
60781	60791	60798	60799	Richard Jones	51	" Desired much , hoped little , nothing asked . "
61205	61229	61192	61192	her	21	" Oh ! why have I not too a father to love and know me , not imperfectly , but fully — completely , "
61237	61290	61192	61192	her	21	" You had set your heart on human love , and because you had set your heart upon it , it was not granted to you . Complain not , murmur not , Rachel , if thou hast not thy father upon earth , remember that thou hast thy Father in Heaven ! "
