50	63	37	37	Jasper	186	' There 's a man being hanged in London at this moment . '
64	76	80	80	Maud	187	' Surely it is n't necessary to let us know that , '
84	93	97	97	Dora	188	' And in such a tone , too ! '
99	104	106	107	Mrs. Milvain	189	' Who is it ? '
117	157	106	107	Mrs. Milvain	189	' I do n't know . It happened to catch my eye in the paper yesterday that someone was to be hanged at Newgate this morning . There 's a certain satisfaction in reflecting that it is not oneself . '
158	169	171	171	Maud	187	' That 's your selfish way of looking at things , '
173	176	171	171	Maud	187	' Well , '
180	345	178	178	Jasper	186	' seeing that the fact came into my head , what better use could I make of it ? I could curse the brutality of an age that sanctioned such things ; or I could grow doleful over the misery of the poor — fellow . But those emotions would be as little profitable to others as to myself . It just happened that I saw the thing in a light of consolation . Things are bad with me , but not so bad as that . I might be going out between Jack Ketch and the Chaplain to be hanged ; instead of that , I am eating a really fresh egg , and very excellent buttered toast , with coffee as good as can be reasonably expected in this part of the world . — ( Do try boiling the milk , mother . ) — The tone in which I spoke was spontaneous ; being so , it needs no justification . '
560	569	571	571	Jasper	186	' A man who comes to be hanged , '
575	623	571	571	Jasper	186	' has the satisfaction of knowing that he has brought society to its last resource . He is a man of such fatal importance that nothing will serve against him but the supreme effort of law . In a way , you know , that is success . '
624	629	631	631	Maud	187	' In a way , '
635	643	645	645	Dora	188	' Suppose we talk of something else , '
715	721	722	722	he	186	' This is from Reardon , '
729	752	722	722	he	186	' Things are going badly with him . He is just the kind of fellow to end by poisoning or shooting himself . '
753	757	725	727	the younger girl	423	' But why ? '
758	777	725	727	the younger girl	423	' Ca n't get anything done ; and begins to be sore troubled on his wife 's account . '
778	783	722	722	he	186	' Is he ill ? '
784	862	725	727	the younger girl	423	' Overworked , I suppose . But it 's just what I foresaw . He is n't the kind of man to keep up literary production as a paying business . In favourable circumstances he might write a fairly good book once every two or three years . The failure of his last depressed him , and now he is struggling hopelessly to get another done before the winter season . Those people will come to grief . '
863	872	874	874	Maud	187	' The enjoyment with which he anticipates it ! '
881	886	888	888	Jasper	186	' Not at all , '
890	1052	888	888	Jasper	186	' It 's true I envied the fellow , because he persuaded a handsome girl to believe in him and share his risks , but I shall be very sorry if he goes to the — to the dogs . He 's my one serious friend . But it irritates me to see a man making such large demands upon fortune . One must be more modest — as I am . Because one book had a sort of success he imagined his struggles were over . He got a hundred pounds for " On Neutral Ground , " and at once counted on a continuance of payments in geometrical proportion . I hinted to him that he could n't keep it up , and he smiled with tolerance , no doubt thinking " He judges me by himself . " But I did n't do anything of the kind . — ( Toast , please , Dora . ) — I 'm

1166	1167	1158	1159	The Optimist	431	' '
1176	1180	1168	1169	Mr. Yule	194	' said Dora . '
1207	1239	1158	1159	The Optimist	431	'm much mistaken in him . Her mother has only just enough to live upon ; ca n't possibly help them . Her brother would n't give or lend twopence halfpenny . '
1240	1247	1249	1249	Maud	187	' Has Mr. Reardon no relatives ? '
1251	1306	1249	1249	Maud	187	' I never heard him make mention of a single one . No , he has done the fatal thing . A man in his position , if he marry at all , must take either a work - girl or an heiress , and in many ways the work - girl is preferable . '
1307	1314	1316	1316	Dora	188	' How can you say that ? '
1318	1329	1316	1316	Dora	188	' You never cease talking about the advantages of money . '
1330	1372	1249	1249	Maud	187	' Oh , I do n't mean that for me the work - girl would be preferable ; by no means ; but for a man like Reardon . He is absurd enough to be conscientious , likes to be called an '
1375	1437	1249	1249	Maud	187	' and so on . He might possibly earn a hundred and fifty a year if his mind were at rest , and that would be enough if he had married a decent little dressmaker . He would n't desire superfluities , and the quality of his work would be its own reward . As it is , he 's ruined . '
1438	1443	1445	1445	Maud	187	' And I repeat , '
1447	1454	1445	1445	Maud	187	' that you enjoy the prospect . '
1455	1495	1511	1511	her	189	' Nothing of the kind . If I seem to speak exultantly it 's only because my intellect enjoys the clear perception of a fact . — A little marmalade , Dora ; the home - made , please . '
1496	1505	1511	1511	her	189	' But this is very sad , Jasper , '
1517	1529	1511	1511	her	189	' I suppose they ca n't even go for a holiday ? '
1530	1537	1511	1511	her	189	' Quite out of the question . '
1538	1552	1511	1511	her	189	' Not even if you invited them to come here for a week ? '
1553	1558	1560	1560	Maud	187	' Now , mother , '
1562	1572	1560	1560	Maud	187	' that 's impossible , you know very well . '
1573	1592	1511	1511	her	189	' I thought we might make an effort , dear . A holiday might mean everything to him . '
1593	1598	1511	1511	her	189	' No , no , '
1605	1641	1601	1601	Jasper	186	' I do n't think you 'd get along very well with Mrs. Reardon ; and then , if her uncle is coming to Mr. Yule 's , you know , that would be awkward . '
1642	1663	1511	1511	her	189	' I suppose it would ; though those people would only stay a day or two , Miss Harrow said . '
1664	1680	1682	1682	Dora	188	' Why ca n't Mr. Yule make them friends , those two lots of people ? '
1684	1695	1682	1682	Dora	188	' You say he 's on good terms with both . '
1696	1708	1709	1709	Jasper	186	' I suppose he thinks it 's no business of his . '
1718	1723	1724	1724	he	186	' Ten years hence , '
1727	1744	1724	1724	he	186	' if Reardon is still alive , I shall be lending him five - pound notes . '
1758	1767	1755	1755	Dora	188	' To be sure ! To be sure ! '
1772	2093	1769	1770	their brother	434	' You have no faith . But just understand the difference between a man like Reardon and a man like me . He is the old type of unpractical artist ; I am the literary man of 1882 . He wo n't make concessions , or rather , he ca n't make them ; he ca n't supply the market . I — well , you may say that at present I do nothing ; but that 's a great mistake , I am learning my business . Literature nowadays is a trade . Putting aside men of genius , who may succeed by mere cosmic force , your successful man of letters is your skilful tradesman . He thinks first and foremost of the markets ; when one kind of goods begins to go off slackly , he is ready with something new and appetising . He knows perfectly all the possible sources of income . Whatever he has to sell he 'll get payment for it from all sorts of various quarters ; none of your unpractical selling for a lump sum to a middleman who will make six distinct profits . Now , look you : if I had been in Reardon 's place , I 'd have made four hundred at least out of " The Optimist " ; I should have gone shrewdly to work with magazines and newspapers and foreign publishers , and — all sorts of people . Reardon ca n't do that kind of thing , he 's behind his age ; he sells a manuscript as if he lived in Sam Johnson 's Grub Street . But our Grub Street of to - day is quite a different place : it is supplied with telegraphic communication , it knows what literary fare is in demand in every part of the world , its inhabitants are men of business , however seedy . '
2094	2099	2101	2101	Maud	187	' It sounds ignoble , '
2103	2149	2101	2101	Maud	187	' I have nothing to do with that , my dear girl . Now , as I tell you , I am slowly , but surely , learning the business . My line wo n't be novels ; I have failed in that direction , I 'm

2296	2299	2295	2295	I	0	'm sure . '
2300	2315	2317	2317	Jasper	186	' I do n't see that there 's any chance of their getting much , '
2321	2392	2398	2398	he	186	' Mrs. Reardon is only his niece . The man 's brother and sister will have the first helping , I suppose . And then , if it comes to the second generation , the literary Yule has a daughter , and by her being invited here I should think she 's the favourite niece . No , no ; depend upon it they wo n't get anything at all . '
2414	2434	2398	2398	he	186	' Had Mr. Reardon any hopes of that kind at the time of his marriage , do you think ? '
2439	2455	2436	2437	Mrs. Milvain	189	' Reardon ? Good heavens , no ! Would he were capable of such forethought ! '
2759	2765	2767	2768	the mother	463	' Jasper wants more money , '
2781	2800	2767	2768	the mother	463	' Of course . I knew that . I hope you told him he could n't have it . '
2801	2811	2813	2814	Mrs. Milvain	189	' I really did n't know what to say , '
2823	2852	2853	2853	Maud	187	' Then you must leave the matter to me , that 's all . There 's no money for him , and there 's an end of it . '
2867	2876	2855	2855	her	187	' What 's he to do , Maud ? '
2877	2894	2767	2768	the mother	463	' To do ? How do other people do ? What do Dora and I do ? '
2895	2908	2855	2855	her	187	' You do n't earn enough for your support , my dear . '
2909	2914	2917	2918	the girl	427	' Oh , well ! '
2920	2932	2917	2918	the girl	427	' Of course if you grudge us our food and lodging — '
2933	2971	2855	2855	her	187	' Do n't be so quick - tempered . You know very well I am far from grudging you anything , dear . But I only meant to say that Jasper does earn something , you know . '
2972	3014	2855	2855	her	187	' It 's a disgraceful thing that he does n't earn as much as he needs . We are sacrificed to him , as we always have been . Why should we be pinching and stinting to keep him in idleness ? '
3015	3033	2917	2918	the girl	427	' But you really ca n't call it idleness , Maud . He is studying his profession . '
3034	3139	2855	2855	her	187	' Pray call it trade ; he prefers it . How do I know that he 's studying anything ? What does he mean by " studying " ? And to hear him speak scornfully of his friend Mr. Reardon , who seems to work hard all through the year ! It 's disgusting , mother . At this rate , he will never earn his own living . Who has n't seen or heard of such men ? If we had another hundred a year , I would say nothing . But we ca n't live on what he leaves us , and I 'm

3459	3460	3457	3457	Maud	187	' '
3466	3498	3465	3465	I	0	'm saying . I 've read quite enough about such things . He might live very well indeed on thirty shillings a week , even buying his clothes out of it . '
3499	3539	3551	3552	the girl	427	' But he has told us so often that it 's no use to him to live like that . He is obliged to go to places where he must spend a little , or he makes no progress . '
3540	3549	3551	3552	the girl	427	' Well , all I can say is , '
3555	3576	3551	3552	the girl	427	' it 's very lucky for him that he 's got a mother who willingly sacrifices her daughters to him . '
3577	3595	3551	3552	the girl	427	' That 's how you always break out . You do n't care what unkindness you say ! '
3596	3603	3551	3552	the girl	427	' It 's a simple truth . '
3604	3611	3551	3552	the girl	427	' Dora never speaks like that . '
3612	3621	3551	3552	the girl	427	' Because she 's afraid to be honest . '
3622	3665	3551	3552	the girl	427	' No , because she has too much love for her mother . I ca n't bear to talk to you , Maud . The older I get , and the weaker I get , the more unfeeling you are to me . '
3733	3737	3738	3738	he	186	' Look here , '

3911	3927	3893	3893	You	187	' And please , why am I to take up an inferior kind of work ? '
3928	4161	4162	4162	He	475	' Inferior ? Oh , if you can be a George Eliot , begin at the earliest opportunity . I merely suggested what seemed practicable . But I do n't think you have genius , Maud . People have got that ancient prejudice so firmly rooted in their heads — that one must n't write save at the dictation of the Holy Spirit . I tell you , writing is a business . Get together half a dozen fair specimens of the Sunday - school prize ; study them ; discover the essential points of such composition ; hit upon new attractions ; then go to work methodically , so many pages a day . There 's no question of the divine afflatus ; that belongs to another sphere of life . We talk of literature as a trade , not of Homer , Dante , and Shakspeare . If I could only get that into poor Reardon 's head . He thinks me a gross beast , often enough . What the devil — I mean what on earth is there in typography to make everything it deals with sacred ? I do n't advocate the propagation of vicious literature ; I speak only of good , coarse , marketable stuff for the world 's vulgar . You just give it a thought . Maud ; talk it over with Dora . '
4166	4360	4162	4162	He	475	' I maintain that we people of brains are justified in supplying the mob with the food it likes . We are not geniuses , and if we sit down in a spirit of long - eared gravity we shall produce only commonplace stuff . Let us use our wits to earn money , and make the best we can of our lives . If only I had the skill , I would produce novels out - trashing the trashiest that ever sold fifty thousand copies . But it needs skill , mind you ; and to deny it is a gross error of the literary pedants . To please the vulgar you must , one way or another , incarnate the genius of vulgarity . For my own part , I sha n't be able to address the bulkiest multitude ; my talent does n't lend itself to that form . I shall write for the upper middle - class of intellect , the people who like to feel that what they are reading has some special cleverness , but who ca n't distinguish between stones and paste . That 's why I 'm
4415	4467	4407	4407	fellows	476	' Mrs. Milvain kept glancing at Maud , with eyes which desired her attention to these utterances . None the less , half an hour after dinner , Jasper found himself encountered by his sister in the garden , on her face a look which warned him of what was coming . '

On his countenance was just a trace of solicitude , but for the most part he wore a thoughtful smile . Now and then he stroked his smoothly - shaven jaws with thumb and fingers . Occasionally he became observant of wayside details — of the colour of a maple leaf , the shape of a tall thistle , the consistency of a fungus . At the few people who passed he looked keenly , surveying them from head to foot . On turning , at the limit of his walk , he found himself almost face to face with two persons , who were coming along in silent companionship ; their appearance interested him . The one was a man of fifty , grizzled , hard featured , slightly bowed in the shoulders ; he were a grey felt hat with a broad brim , and a decent suit of broad - cloth . With him was a girl of perhaps two - and - twenty , in a slate - coloured dress with very little ornament , and a yellow straw hat of the shape originally appropriated to males ; her dark hair was cut short , and lay in innumerable crisp curls . Father and daughter , obviously . The girl , to a casual eye , was neither pretty nor beautiful , but she had a grave and impressive face , with a complexion of ivory tone ; her walk was gracefully modest , and she seemed to be enjoying the country air . Jasper mused concerning them . When he had walked a few yards , he looked back ; at the same moment the unknown man also turned his head . '
4981	5000	4968	4969	the deuce	482	' Milvain asked himself . And before he reached home the recollection he sought flashed upon his mind . '

5252	5411	5244	5244	I	0	' Later in the afternoon Jasper 's conjecture was rendered a certainty . Maud had walked to Wattleborough , where she would meet Dora on the latter 's return from her teaching , and Mrs. Milvain sat alone , in a mood of depression ; there was a ring at the door - bell , and the servant admitted Miss Harrow . This lady acted as housekeeper to Mr. John Yule , a wealthy resident in this neighbourhood ; she was the sister of his deceased wife — a thin , soft - speaking , kindly woman of forty - five . The greater part of her life she had spent as a governess ; her position now was more agreeable , and the removal of her anxiety about the future had developed qualities of cheerfulness which formerly no one would have suspected her to possess . The acquaintance between Mrs. Milvain and her was only of twelve months '
5433	5440	5441	5441	she	501	' Our London visitors came yesterday , '
5459	5466	5468	5469	the visitor	503	' No doubt it was they , '
5471	5502	5468	5469	the visitor	503	' Mrs. Yule has n't come ; I hardly expected she would , you know . So very unfortunate when there are difficulties of that kind , is n't it ? '
5507	5515	5517	5518	Mrs. Milvain	189	' The poor girl must feel it , '

7142	7192	7140	7140	Jasper	186	' known to some of us as the valley of the shadow of books . People who often work there necessarily get to know each other by sight . In the same way I knew Miss Yule 's father when I happened to pass him in the road yesterday . '
7269	7286	7288	7288	Maud	187	' You must wonder how we exist in this out- of - the - way place , '
7290	7297	7288	7288	Maud	187	' Rather , I envy you , '
7429	7440	7441	7441	he	205	' It pleases me to meet you , Mr. Milvain , '
7452	7483	7441	7441	he	205	' Your name reminds me of a paper in The Wayside a month or two ago , which you will perhaps allow a veteran to say was not ill done . '
7484	7494	7496	7496	Jasper	186	' I am grateful to you for noticing it , '
7589	7601	7584	7584	he	186	' Have you seen The Study this week , Mr. Yule ? '
7602	7605	7584	7584	he	186	' Yes . '
7606	7632	7633	7634	Mr. Yule	205	' Did you notice that it contains a very favourable review of a novel which was tremendously abused in the same columns three weeks ago ? '
7650	7657	7644	7644	his	205	' You do n't say so ? '
7658	7682	7584	7584	he	186	' Yes . The novel is Miss Hawk 's " On the Boards . " How will the editor get out of this ? '
7683	7706	7707	7707	He	205	' H'm ! Of course Mr. Fadge is not immediately responsible ; but it 'll be unpleasant for him , decidedly unpleasant , '
7711	7718	7707	7707	He	205	' You hear this , Marian ? '
7719	7727	7584	7584	he	186	' How is it explained , father ? '
7728	7852	7584	7584	he	186	' May be accident , of course ; but — well , there 's no knowing . I think it very likely this will be the end of Mr. Fadge 's tenure of office . Rackett , the proprietor , only wants a plausible excuse for making a change . The paper has been going downhill for the last year ; I know of two publishing houses who have withdrawn their advertising from it , and who never send their books for review . Everyone foresaw that kind of thing from the day Mr. Fadge became editor . The tone of his paragraphs has been detestable . Two reviews of the same novel , eh ? And diametrically opposed ? Ha ! ha ! '
7874	7877	7881	7881	he	205	' Mr. Fadge '
7895	7899	7901	7901	Milvain	186	' The author , '
7903	7914	7901	7901	Milvain	186	' ought to make a good thing out of this . '
7915	7943	7944	7944	He	205	' Will , no doubt . Ought to write at once to the papers , calling attention to this sample of critical impartiality . Ha ! ha ! '
8040	8048	8050	8051	Miss Harrow	197	' Suppose we go into the garden , '
8055	8069	8050	8051	Miss Harrow	197	' It seems a shame to sit indoors on such a lovely afternoon . '
8091	8122	8084	8085	Mr. Yule	205	' My brother would he glad if you would come and have a word with him . He is n't quite well enough to leave his room to - day . '
8256	8267	8274	8274	he	194	' So you too are in league with the doctors , '
8294	8308	8310	8310	Jasper	186	' Well , that certainly is one way of regarding the literary profession , '
8327	8359	8310	8310	Jasper	186	' A young fellow with all the world before him , too . Hang it , Mr. Milvain , is there no less pernicious work you can turn your hand to ? '
8360	8362	8366	8367	Mr. Yule	194	' I 'm
8387	8388	8372	8372	you	194	' '
8393	8394	8372	8372	you	194	' '
8432	8440	8441	8441	I	0	' Alfred Yule uttered a short laugh . '
8449	8450	8447	8447	John	194	' '
8454	8458	8447	8447	John	194	' answered John , '
8488	8528	8545	8545	Milvain	186	' He chuckled inwardly , and at the same time reached out for a box of cigarettes on a table near him . His brother and Jasper each took one as he offered them , and began to smoke . '
8529	8543	8545	8545	Milvain	186	' You would like to see literary production come entirely to an end ? '
8547	8559	8545	8545	Milvain	186	' I should like to see the business of literature abolished . '
8560	8587	8545	8545	Milvain	186	' There 's a distinction , of course . But , on the whole , I should say that even the business serves a good purpose . '
8588	8592	8545	8545	Milvain	186	' What purpose ? '
8593	8600	8545	8545	Milvain	186	' It helps to spread civilisation . '
8601	8604	8606	8606	John	194	' Civilisation ! '
8610	8741	8606	8606	John	194	' What do you mean by civilisation ? Do you call it civilising men to make them weak , flabby creatures , with ruined eyes and dyspeptic stomachs ? Who is it that reads most of the stuff that 's poured out daily by the ton from the printing - press ? Just the men and women who ought to spend their leisure hours in open - air exercise ; the people who earn their bread by sedentary pursuits , and who need to live as soon as they are free from the desk or the counter , not to moon over small print . Your Board schools , your popular press , your spread of education ! Machinery for ruining the country , that 's what I call it . '
8742	8760	8545	8545	Milvain	186	' You have done a good deal , I think , to counteract those influences in Wattleborough . '
8761	8853	8854	8855	His brother	552	' I hope so ; and if only I had kept the use of my limbs I 'd have done a good deal more . I have an idea of offering substantial prizes to men and women engaged in sedentary work who take an oath to abstain from all reading , and keep it for a certain number of years . There 's a good deal more need for that than for abstinence from strong liquor . If I could have had my way I would have revived prize - fighting . '
8861	8874	8876	8876	Jasper	186	' You would doubtless like to see military conscription introduced into England ? '
8878	9071	8876	8876	Jasper	186	' Of course I should ! You talk of civilising ; there 's no such way of civilising the masses of the people as by fixed military service . Before mental training must come training of the body . Go about the Continent , and see the effect of military service on loutish peasants and the lowest classes of town population . Do you know why it is n't even more successful ? Because the damnable education movement interferes . If Germany would shut up her schools and universities for the next quarter of a century and go ahead like blazes with military training there 'd be a nation such as the world has never seen . After that , they might begin a little book - teaching again — say an hour and a half a day for everyone above nine years old . Do you suppose , Mr. Milvain , that society is going to be reformed by you people who write for money ? Why , you are the very first class that will be swept from the face of the earth as soon as the reformation really begins ! '
9120	9125	9127	9127	John	194	' You , now , '
9129	9136	9127	9127	John	194	' what do you write about ? '
9137	9156	9108	9108	Milvain	186	' Nothing in particular . I make a saleable page or two out of whatever strikes my fancy . '
9157	9193	9127	9127	John	194	' Exactly ! You do n't even pretend that you 've got anything to say . You live by inducing people to give themselves mental indigestion — and bodily , too , for that matter . '
9194	9274	9127	9127	John	194	' Do you know , Mr. Yule , that you have suggested a capital idea to me ? If I were to take up your views , I think it is n't at all unlikely that I might make a good thing of writing against writing . It should be my literary specialty to rail against literature . The reading public should pay me for telling them that they ought n't to read . I must think it over . '
9275	9281	9284	9284	Alfred	205	' Carlyle has anticipated you , '
9286	9305	9306	9306	He	205	' Yes , but in an antiquated way . I would base my polemic on the newest philosophy . '
9325	9333	9335	9336	the invalid	610	' There again ! your new philosophy ! '
9338	9448	9335	9336	the invalid	610	' Why , it is n't even wholesome stuff , the kind of reading that most of you force on the public . Now there 's the man who has married one of my nieces — poor lass ! Reardon , his name is . You know him , I dare say . Just for curiosity I had a look at one of his books ; it was called " The Optimist . " Of all the morbid trash I ever saw , that beat everything . I thought of writing him a letter , advising a couple of antibilious pills before bed - time for a few weeks . '
9462	9473	9475	9475	John	194	' That man deserves penal servitude , in my opinion , '
9477	9479	9475	9475	John	194	' I 'm
9505	9532	9475	9475	John	194	' Milvain , with a clear vision of his friend in London , burst into laughter . But at that point Alfred rose from his chair . '
9539	9556	9536	9537	the ladies	591	' he said , with a certain pedantry of phrase and manner which often characterised him . '
9563	9567	9569	9569	John	194	're still young , '
9578	9588	9589	9589	Jasper	186	' Your brother speaks quite seriously , I suppose ? '
9600	9637	9589	9589	Jasper	186	' I think so . It 's amusing now and then , but gets rather tiresome when you hear it often . By - the - by , you are not personally acquainted with Mr. Fadge ? '
9638	9651	9706	9707	Miss Harrow	197	' I did n't even know his name until you mentioned it . '
9652	9705	9589	9589	Jasper	186	' The most malicious man in the literary world . There 's no uncharitableness in feeling a certain pleasure when he gets into a scrape . I could tell you incredible stories about him ; but that kind of thing is probably as little to your taste as it is to mine . '
9733	9747	9749	9750	Miss Harrow	197	' So you can sit with us and smoke , if you like , '
9754	9770	9749	9750	Miss Harrow	197	' You are never quite at your ease , I think , without a pipe . '
10319	10329	10330	10330	he	186	' When I was here late in the spring , '
10333	10349	10330	10330	he	186	' this ash was only just budding , though everything else seemed in full leaf . '
10350	10357	10359	10359	Marian	211	' An ash , is it ? '
10361	10381	10382	10382	she	211	' I did n't know . I think an oak is the only tree I can distinguish . Yet , '
10386	10404	10382	10382	she	211	' I knew that the ash was late ; some lines of Tennyson come to my memory . '
10405	10410	10330	10330	he	186	' Which are those ? '
10411	10437	10330	10330	he	186	' Delaying , as the tender ash delays To clothe herself , when all the woods are green , somewhere in the " Idylls . " '
10438	10460	10461	10461	She	211	' I do n't remember ; so I wo n't pretend to — though I should do so as a rule . '
10477	10487	10488	10488	Jasper	186	' You have had little experience of the country ? '
10491	10506	10488	10488	Jasper	186	' Very little . You , I think , have known it from childhood ? '
10507	10568	10330	10330	he	186	' In a sort of way . I was born in Wattleborough , and my people have always lived here . But I am not very rural in temperament . I have really no friends here ; either they have lost interest in me , or I in them . What do you think of the girls , my sisters ? '
10581	10587	10588	10588	Jasper	186	' They are tolerably intellectual , '
10605	10633	10593	10593	he	186	' I want to persuade them to try their hands at literary work of some kind or other . They give lessons , and both hate it . '
10634	10643	10645	10645	Marian	211	' Would literary work be less — burdensome ? '
10652	10660	10645	10645	Marian	211	' Rather more so , you think ? '
10664	10677	10661	10661	She	211	' It depends , of course , on — on several things . '
10678	10683	10684	10684	Jasper	186	' To be sure , '
10687	10751	10684	10684	Jasper	186	' I do n't think they have any marked faculty for such work ; but as they certainly have n't for teaching , that does n't matter . It 's a question of learning a business . I am going through my apprenticeship , and find it a long affair . Money would shorten it , and , unfortunately , I have none . '
10752	10755	10757	10757	Marian	211	' Yes , '
10766	10774	10757	10757	Marian	211	' money is a help in everything . '
10775	10884	10684	10684	Jasper	186	' Without it , one spends the best part of one 's life in toiling for that first foothold which money could at once purchase . To have money is becoming of more and more importance in a literary career ; principally because to have money is to have friends . Year by year , such influence grows of more account . A lucky man will still occasionally succeed by dint of his own honest perseverance , but the chances are dead against anyone who ca n't make private interest with influential people ; his work is simply overwhelmed by that of the men who have better opportunities . '
10885	10907	10684	10684	Jasper	186	' Do n't you think that , even to - day , really good work will sooner or later be recognised ? '
10908	11013	10757	10757	Marian	211	' Later , rather than sooner ; and very likely the man ca n't wait ; he starves in the meantime . You understand that I am not speaking of genius ; I mean marketable literary work . The quantity turned out is so great that there 's no hope for the special attention of the public unless one can afford to advertise hugely . Take the instance of a successful all - round man of letters ; take Ralph Warbury , whose name you 'll see in the first magazine you happen to open . But perhaps he is a friend of yours ? '
11014	11019	10684	10684	Jasper	186	' Oh , no ! '
11020	11143	10684	10684	Jasper	186	' Well , I was n't going to abuse him . I was only going to ask : Is there any quality which distinguishes his work from that of twenty struggling writers one could name ? Of course not . He 's a clever , prolific man ; so are they . But he began with money and friends ; he came from Oxford into the thick of advertised people ; his name was mentioned in print six times a week before he had written a dozen articles . This kind of thing will become the rule . Men wo n't succeed in literature that they may get into society , but will get into society that they may succeed in literature . '
11144	11153	11155	11155	Marian	211	' Yes , I know it is true , '
11162	11173	11174	11174	Jasper	186	' There 's a friend of mine who writes novels , '
11177	11334	10684	10684	Jasper	186	' His books are not works of genius , but they are glaringly distinct from the ordinary circulating novel . Well , after one or two attempts , he made half a success ; that is to say , the publishers brought out a second edition of the book in a few months . There was his opportunity . But he could n't use it ; he had no friends , because he had no money . A book of half that merit if written by a man in the position of Warbury when he started would have established the reputation of a lifetime . His influential friends would have referred to it in leaders , in magazine articles , in speeches , in sermons . It would have run through numerous editions , and the author would have had nothing to do but to write another book and demand his price . But the novel I 'm

12293	12298	12251	12252	Miss Yule	206	' pursued her companion . '

12423	12487	12488	12488	You	206	' she replied with a laugh . The line ran along a deep cutting , from either side of which grew hazel bushes and a few larger trees . Leaning upon the parapet of the bridge , Jasper kept his eye in the westward direction , where the gleaming rails were visible for more than a mile . Suddenly he raised his finger . '
12491	12603	12488	12488	You	206	' Marian had just caught the far - off sound of the train . She looked eagerly , and in a few moments saw it approaching . The front of the engine blackened nearer and nearer , coming on with dread force and speed . A blinding rush , and there burst against the bridge a great volley of sunlit steam . Milvain and his companion ran to the opposite parapet , but already the whole train had emerged , and in a few seconds it had disappeared round a sharp curve . The leafy branches that grew out over the line swayed violently backwards and forwards in the perturbed air . '
12611	12617	12618	12618	I	0	' said Jasper , laughing , '

13162	13379	13119	13119	I	0	' Jasper readily adapted himself to the wish he discerned in Mr. Yule ; at once he offered leave- taking in the most natural way . Nothing was said on either side about another meeting . The young man proceeded homewards , but , on arriving , did not at once enter the house . Behind the garden was a field used for the grazing of horses ; he entered it by the unfastened gate , and strolled idly hither and thither , now and then standing to observe a poor worn - out beast , all skin and bone , which had presumably been sent here in the hope that a little more labour might still be exacted from it if it were suffered to repose for a few weeks . There were sores upon its back and legs ; it stood in a fixed attitude of despondency , just flicking away troublesome flies with its grizzled tail . It was tea - time when he went in . Maud was not at home , and Mrs. Milvain , tormented by a familiar headache , kept her room ; so Jasper and Dora sat down together . Each had an open book on the table ; throughout the meal they exchanged only a few words . '

Dora did not play badly , but an absent - mindedness which was commonly observable in her had its effect upon the music . She at length broke offidly in the middle of a passage , and began to linger on careless chords . Then , without turning her head , she asked : '
13495	13496	13483	13483	you	691	' '
13683	13684	13688	13688	you	691	' '

14243	14254	14203	14204	Mrs. Reardon	196	' began the visitor , who seemed in high spirits , '
14267	14292	14262	14262	I	0	' He unfolded a London evening paper , and indicated a long letter from a casual correspondent . It was written by the authoress of '
14297	14330	14262	14262	I	0	' and drew attention , with much expenditure of witticism , to the conflicting notices of that book which had appeared in The Study . Jasper read the thing with laughing appreciation . '

14450	14566	14443	14443	you	0	' With a step of quite unusual sprightliness Mr. Yule entered the house . He could talk of but one subject , and Mrs. Milvain had to listen to a laboured account of the blunder just committed by The Study . It was Alfred Yule 's characteristic that he could do nothing lighthandedly . He seemed always to converse with effort ; he took a seat with stiff ungainliness he walked with a stumbling or sprawling gait . When he and Jasper set out for their ramble , his loquacity was in strong contrast with the taciturn mood he had exhibited yesterday and the day before . He fell upon the general aspects of contemporary literature '
14967	15057	14963	14963	his	224	' And as he talked the man kept describing imaginary geometrical figures with the end of his walking - stick ; he very seldom raised his eyes from the ground , and the stoop in his shoulders grew more and more pronounced , until at a little distance one might have taken him for a hunchback . At one point Jasper made a pause to speak of the pleasant wooded prospect that lay before them ; his companion regarded it absently , and in a moment or two asked : '
15110	15265	15108	15108	you	723	' He barked in laughter . Impossible to interest him in anything apart from literature ; yet one saw him to be a man of solid understanding , and not without perception of humour . He had read vastly ; his memory was a literary cyclopædia . His failings , obvious enough , were the results of a strong and somewhat pedantic individuality ceaselessly at conflict with unpropitious circumstances . Towards the young man his demeanour varied between a shy cordiality and a dignifed reserve which was in danger of seeming pretentious . On the homeward part of the walk , he made a few discreet inquiries regarding Milvain 's literary achievements and prospects , and the frank selfconfidence of the replies appeared to interest him . But he expressed no desire to number Jasper among his acquaintances in town , and of his own professional or private concerns he said not a word . '
15283	15294	15277	15277	I	0	' Jasper remarked to his mother and sisters at dinner . '
15331	15332	15321	15321	he	724	' '
15335	15339	15321	15321	he	724	' replied Maud , '

15361	15365	15355	15355	You	0	' said Jasper , '
15515	15750	15504	15504	Yules	226	' In the afternoon , Miss Harrow and Marian came at the expected hour . Jasper purposely kept out of the way until he was summoned to the tea - table . The Milvain girls were so far from effusive , even towards old acquaintances , that even the people who knew them best spoke of them as rather cold and perhaps a trifle condescending ; there were people in Wattleborough who declared their airs of superiority ridiculous and insufferable . The truth was that nature had endowed them with a larger share of brains than was common in their circle , and had added that touch of pride which harmonised so ill with the restrictions of poverty . Their life had a tone of melancholy , the painful reserve which characterises a certain clearly defined class in the present day . Had they been born twenty years earlier , the children of that veterinary surgeon would have grown up to a very different , and in all probability a much happier , existence , for their education would have been limited to the strictly needful , and — certainly in the case of the girls — nothing would have encouraged them to look beyond the simple life possible to a poor man 's offspring . But whilst Maud and Dora were still with their homely schoolmistress , Wattleborough saw fit to establish a Girls '

16057	16069	16053	16053	Marian	211	' I have no friends of my own age in London . '

16130	16165	16166	16166	he	186	' It seemed doubtful , up at Yule 's house . Well , get her to come here again before I go . But it 's a pity she does n't play the piano , '
16316	16325	16310	16310	he	186	' I shall go to London this afternoon . '

16464	16484	16454	16454	he	4363	' Do you think I ought to say good bye to the Yules ? Or wo n't it signify ? '
16485	16495	16454	16454	he	4363	' I should have thought you would wish to . '
16496	16543	16454	16454	he	4363	' I do n't care about it . And , you see , there 's been no hint of a wish on their part that I should see them in London . No , I 'll just leave you to say good - bye for me . '
16544	16582	16454	16454	he	4363	' But they expect to see us to - day or tomorrow . You told them you were not going till Monday , and you do n't know but Mr. Yule might mean to say something yet . '

16601	16606	16595	16595	Jasper	186	' Oh , indeed ? '
16607	16615	16616	16616	he	186	' I do n't mind telling you , '

16848	16864	16865	16866	Mrs. Milvain	189	' I think I ought to tell you of something I did yesterday , Jasper , '
16869	16939	16865	16866	Mrs. Milvain	189	' You see , my dear , we have been rather straitened lately , and my health , you know , grows so uncertain , and , all things considered , I have been feeling very anxious about the girls . So I wrote to your uncle William , and told him that I must positively have that money . I must think of my own children before his . '
17076	17088	17090	17090	Jasper	186	' You ca n't recover by law now , you know , '
17092	17112	17090	17090	Jasper	186	' But we have a right to the money , law or no law . He must pay it . '

17333	17394	17395	17395	I	0	' The young man went to the parlour , and listened to Maud 's music for awhile . But restlessness again drove him forth . Towards eleven o'clock , he was again ascending in the direction of John Yule 's house . Again he had no intention of calling , but when he reached the iron gates , he lingered . '
17401	17409	17395	17395	I	0	' he said within himself at last . '
17432	17463	17464	17465	Miss Yule	206	' At the house door he inquired for Mr. Alfred Yule . That gentleman had gone in the carriage to Wattleborough , half an hour ago , with his brother . '
17467	17540	17541	17541	I	0	' Yes , she was within . Jasper entered the sitting - room , waited a few moments , and Marian appeared . She wore a dress in which Milvain had not yet seen her , and it had the effect of making him regard her attentively . The smile with which she had come towards him passed from her face , which was perchance a little warmer of hue than commonly . '
17542	17552	17553	17553	Jasper	186	'm sorry your father is away , Miss Yule , '
17561	17581	17553	17553	Jasper	186	' I wanted to say good - bye to him . I return to London in a few hours . '

17592	17628	17553	17553	Jasper	186	' Yes , I feel I must n't waste any more time . I think the country air is doing you good ; you certainly look better than when I passed you that first day . '
17629	17636	17553	17553	Jasper	186	' I feel better , much . '
17637	17658	17553	17553	Jasper	186	' My sisters are anxious to see you again . I should n't wonder if they come up this afternoon . '
17713	17717	17718	17718	he	186	' They deplore , '
17724	17740	17718	17718	he	186	' that they should come to know you only to lose you again so soon . '
17741	17752	17753	17753	she	211	' I have quite as much reason to be sorry , '
17765	17784	17753	17753	she	211	' But perhaps they will let me write to them , and hear from them now and then . '
17785	17807	17808	17808	He	186	' They would think it an honour . Country girls are not often invited to correspond with literary ladies in London . '
17824	17831	17832	17832	Marian	211	' Father will be very sorry , '
17849	17863	17832	17832	Marian	211	' Perhaps he might possibly be able to see you before you go ? '
17891	17895	17896	17896	she	211	' I mean , '
17901	17915	17896	17896	she	211	' he might just call , or even see you at the station ? '

19224	19463	19222	19222	Edwin	195	' She was a slender girl , but not very tall ; her shoulders seemed rather broad in proportion to her waist and the part of her figure below it . The hue of her hair was ruddy gold ; loosely arranged tresses made a superb crown to the beauty of her small , refined head . Yet the face was not of distinctly feminine type ; with short hair and appropriate clothing , she would have passed unquestioned as a handsome boy of seventeen , a spirited boy too , and one much in the habit of giving orders to inferiors . Her nose would have been perfect but for ever so slight a crook which made it preferable to view her in full face than in profile ; her lips curved sharply out , and when she straightened them of a sudden , the effect was not reassuring to anyone who had counted upon her for facile humour . In harmony with the broad shoulders , she had a strong neck ; as she bore the lamp into the room a slight turn of her head showed splendid muscles from the ear downward . It was a magnificently clear - cut bust ; one thought , in looking at her , of the newly - finished head which some honest sculptor has wrought with his own hand from the marble block ; there was a suggestion of '
19465	19595	19176	19176	I	0	' and of the chisel . The atmosphere was cold ; ruddiness would have been quite out of place on her cheeks , and a flush must have been the rarest thing there . Her age was not quite two - and - twenty ; she had been wedded nearly two years , and had a child ten months old . As for her dress , it was unpretending in fashion and colour , but of admirable fit . Every detail of her appearance denoted scrupulous personal refinement . She walked well ; you saw that the foot , however gently , was firmly planted . When she seated herself , her posture was instantly graceful , and that of one who is indifferent about support for the back . '

19616	19680	19681	19681	Amy	191	' It was the tone of friendly remonstrance , not exactly of affection , not at all of tender solicitude . Reardon had risen and wished to approach her , but could not do so directly . He moved to another part of the room , then came round to the back of her chair , and bent his face upon her shoulder . '

You were proud of me because my work was n't altogether common , and because I had never written a line that was meant to attract the vulgar . All that 's over now . If you knew how dreadful it is to see that you have lost your hopes of me ! '

21414	21473	21474	21474	She	871	' But , you see , we have n't money , and there 's little chance of our getting any . That scrubby old uncle wo n't leave anything to us ; I feel too sure of it . I often feel disposed to go and beg him on my knees to think of us in his will . '
21477	21504	21474	21474	She	871	' I suppose it 's impossible , and would be useless ; but I should be capable of it if I knew it would bring money . '
21509	21523	21524	21524	Amy	191	' I did n't think so much of money when we were married , '
21527	21583	21524	21524	Amy	191	' I had never seriously felt the want of it , you know . I did think — there 's no harm in confessing it — that you were sure to be rich some day ; but I should have married you all the same if I had known that you would win only reputation . '
21584	21591	21156	21156	Amy	191	' You are sure of that ? '
21592	21645	21474	21474	She	871	' Well , I think so . But I know the value of money better now . I know it is the most powerful thing in the world . If I had to choose between a glorious reputation with poverty and a contemptible popularity with wealth , I should choose the latter . '
21646	21649	21524	21524	Amy	191	' No ! '
21650	21654	21156	21156	Amy	191	' I should . '
21655	21661	21662	21662	He	872	' Perhaps you are right . '
21669	21810	21662	21662	He	872	' Yes , you are right . What is reputation ? If it is deserved , it originates with a few score of people among the many millions who would never have recognised the merit they at last applaud . That 's the lot of a great genius . As for a mediocrity like me — what ludicrous absurdity to fret myself in the hope that half a dozen folks will say I am " above the average ! " After all , is there sillier vanity than this ? A year after I have published my last book , I shall be practically forgotten ; ten years later , I shall be as absolutely forgotten as one of those novelists of the early part of this century , whose names one does n't even recognise . What fatuous posing ! '
21821	21825	21826	21826	he	872	' And yet , '
21829	22122	21826	21826	he	872	' of course it is n't only for the sake of reputation that one tries to do uncommon work . There 's the shrinking from conscious insincerity of workmanship — which most of the writers nowadays seem never to feel . " It 's good enough for the market " ; that satisfies them . And perhaps they are justified . I ca n't pretend that I rule my life by absolute ideals ; I admit that everything is relative . There is no such thing as goodness or badness , in the absolute sense , of course . Perhaps I am absurdly inconsistent when — though knowing my work ca n't be first - rate — I strive to make it as good as possible . I do n't say this in irony , Amy ; I really mean it . It may very well be that I am just as foolish as the people I ridicule for moral and religious superstition . This habit of mine is superstitious . How well I can imagine the answer of some popular novelist if he heard me speak scornfully of his books . " My dear fellow , " he might say , " do you suppose I am not aware that my books are rubbish ? I know it just as well as you do . But my vocation is to live comfortably . I have a luxurious house , a wife and children who are happy and grateful to me for their happiness . If you choose to live in a garret , and , what 's worse , make your wife and children share it with you , that 's your concern . " The man would be abundantly right . '
22123	22126	22128	22128	Amy	191	' But , '
22130	22149	22128	22128	Amy	191	' why should you assume that his books are rubbish ? Good work succeeds — now and then . '
22150	22225	21826	21826	he	872	' I speak of the common kind of success , which is never due to literary merit . And if I speak bitterly , well , I am suffering from my powerlessness . I am a failure , my poor girl , and it is n't easy for me to look with charity on the success of men who deserved it far less than I did , when I was still able to work . '

23164	24086	23160	23160	you	0	' She passed her hand lightly over his hair , and murmured something with a faint smile . Then Reardon took his hat and stick and descended the eight flights of stone steps , and walked in the darkness round the outer circle of Regent 's Park , racking his fagged brain in a hopeless search for characters , situations , motives . Even in mid - rapture of his marriage month he had foreseen this possibility ; but fate had hitherto rescued him in sudden ways when he was on the brink of self abandonment , and it was hard to imagine that this culmination of triumphant joy could be a preface to base miseries . He was the son of a man who had followed many different pursuits , and in none had done much more than earn a livelihood . At the age of forty — when Edwin , his only child , was ten years old — Mr. Reardon established himself in the town of Hereford as a photographer , and there he abode until his death , nine years after , occasionally risking some speculation not inconsistent with the photographic business , but always with the result of losing the little capital he ventured . Mrs. Reardon died when Edwin had reached his fifteenth year . In breeding and education she was superior to her husband , to whom , moreover , she had brought something between four and five hundred pounds ; her temper was passionate in both senses of the word , and the marriage could hardly be called a happy one , though it was never disturbed by serious discord . The photographer was a man of whims and idealisms ; his wife had a strong vein of worldly ambition . They made few friends , and it was Mrs. Reardon 's frequently expressed desire to go and live in London , where fortune , she thought , might be kinder to them . Reardon had all but made up his mind to try this venture when he suddenly became a widower ; after that he never summoned energy to embark on new enterprises . The boy was educated at an excellent local school ; at eighteen he had a far better acquaintance with the ancient classics than most lads who have been expressly prepared for a university , and , thanks to an anglicised Swiss who acted as an assistant in Mr. Reardon 's business , he not only read French , but could talk it with a certain haphazard fluency . These attainments , however , were not of much practical use ; the best that could be done for Edwin was to place him in the office of an estate agent . His health was indifferent , and it seemed likely that openair exercise , of which he would have a good deal under the particular circumstances of the case , might counteract the effects of study too closely pursued . At his father 's death he came into possession ( practically it was put at his disposal at once , though he was little more than nineteen ) of about two hundred pounds — a life - insurance for five hundred had been sacrificed to exigencies not very long before . He had no difficulty in deciding how to use this money . His mother 's desire to live in London had in him the force of an inherited motive ; as soon as possible he released himself from his uncongenial occupations , converted into money all the possessions of which he had not immediate need , and betook himself to the metropolis . To become a literary man , of course . His capital lasted him nearly four years , for , notwithstanding his age , he lived with painful economy . The strangest life , of almost absolute loneliness . From a certain point of Tottenham Court Road there is visible a certain garret window in a certain street which runs parallel with that thoroughfare ; for the greater part of these four years the garret in question was Reardon 's home . He paid only three - and - six - pence a week for the privilege of living there ; his food cost him about a shilling a day ; on clothing and other unavoidable expenses he laid out some five pounds yearly . Then he bought books — volumes which cost anything between twopence and two shillings ; further than that he durst not go . A strange time , I assure you . When he had completed his twenty - first year , he desired to procure a reader 's ticket for the British Museum . Now this was not such a simple matter as you may suppose ; it was necessary to obtain the signature of some respectable householder , and Reardon was acquainted with no such person . His landlady was a decent woman enough , and a payer of rates and taxes , but it would look odd , to say the least of it , to present oneself in Great Russell Street armed with this person 's recommendation . There was nothing for it but to take a bold step , to force himself upon the attention of a stranger — the thing from which his pride had always shrunk . He wrote to a well - known novelist — a man with whose works he had some sympathy . '
24139	24244	24127	24127	you	888	' That was the substance of his letter . For reply came an invitation to a house in the West - end . With fear and trembling Reardon answered the summons . He was so shabbily attired ; he was so diffident from the habit of living quite alone ; he was horribly afraid lest it should be supposed that he looked for other assistance than he had requested . Well , the novelist was a rotund and jovial man ; his dwelling and his person smelt of money ; he was so happy himself that he could afford to be kind to others . '
24250	24265	24246	24246	you	888	' he inquired , for the young man 's letter had left this uncertain . '

24480	25277	24473	24473	I	0	' The novelist could do no more than grant his genial signature for the specified purpose , and add good wishes in abundance . Reardon went home with his brain in a whirl . He had had his first glimpse of what was meant by literary success . That luxurious study , with its shelves of handsomely - bound books , its beautiful pictures , its warm , fragrant air — great heavens ! what might not a man do who sat at his ease amid such surroundings ! He began to work at the Reading - room , but at the same time he thought often of the novelist 's suggestion , and before long had written two or three short stories . No editor would accept them ; but he continued to practise himself in that art , and by degrees came to fancy that , after all , perhaps he had some talent for fiction . It was significant , however , that no native impulse had directed him to novel - writing . His intellectual temper was that of the student , the scholar , but strongly blended with a love of independence which had always made him think with distaste of a teacher 's life . The stories he wrote were scraps of immature psychology — the last thing a magazine would accept from an unknown man . His money dwindled , and there came a winter during which he suffered much from cold and hunger . What a blessed refuge it was , there under the great dome , when he must else have sat in his windy garret with the mere pretence of a fire ! The Reading - room was his true home ; its warmth enwrapped him kindly ; the peculiar odour of its atmosphere — at first a cause of headache — grew dear and delightful to him . But he could not sit here until his last penny should be spent . Something practical must be done , and practicality was not his strong point . Friends in London he had none ; but for an occasional conversation with his landlady he would scarcely have spoken a dozen words in a week . His disposition was the reverse of democratic , and he could not make acquaintances below his own intellectual level . Solitude fostered a sensitiveness which to begin with was extreme ; the lack of stated occupation encouraged his natural tendency to dream and procrastinate and hope for the improbable . He was a recluse in the midst of millions , and viewed with dread the necessity of going forth to fight for daily food . Little by little he had ceased to hold any correspondence with his former friends at Hereford . The only person to whom he still wrote and from whom he still heard was his mother 's father — an old man who lived at Derby , retired from the business of a draper , and spending his last years pleasantly enough with a daughter who had remained single . Edwin had always been a favourite with his grandfather , though they had met only once or twice during the past eight years . But in writing he did not allow it to be understood that he was in actual want , and he felt that he must come to dire extremities before he could bring himself to beg assistance . He had begun to answer advertisements , but the state of his wardrobe forbade his applying for any but humble positions . Once or twice he presented himself personally at offices , but his reception was so mortifying that death by hunger seemed preferable to a continuance of such experiences . The injury to his pride made him savagely arrogant ; for days after the last rejection he hid himself in his garret , hating the world . He sold his little collection of books , and of course they brought only a trifling sum . That exhausted , he must begin to sell his clothes . And then — ? But help was at hand . One day he saw it advertised in a newspaper that the secretary of a hospital in the north of London was in need of a clerk ; application was to be made by letter . He wrote , and two days later , to his astonishment , received a reply asking him to wait upon the secretary at a certain hour . In a fever of agitation he kept the appointment , and found that his business was with a young man in the very highest spirits , who walked up and down a little office ( the hospital was of the '
25279	25301	25302	25302	I	0	' order , a house of no great size ) , and treated the matter in hand as an excellent joke . '
25333	25350	25357	25357	you	892	' He pointed to a heap of five or six hundred letters , and laughed consumedly . '
25443	25444	25445	25445	I	0	' '
25455	25465	25445	25445	I	0	' said Reardon , who was bathed in perspiration . '
25475	26285	26501	26501	me	0	' proceeded the young man , chuckling and rubbing his hands together . The applicant was engaged . He had barely strength to walk home ; the sudden relief from his miseries made him , for the first time , sensible of the extreme physical weakness into which he had sunk . For the next week he was very ill , but he did not allow this to interfere with his new work , which was easily learnt and not burdensome . He held this position for three years , and during that time important things happened . When he had recovered from his state of semistarvation , and was living in comfort ( a pound a week is a very large sum if you have previously had to live on ten shillings ) , Reardon found that the impulse to literary production awoke in him more strongly than ever . He generally got home from the hospital about six o'clock , and the evening was his own . In this leisure time he wrote a novel in two volumes ; one publisher refused it , but a second offered to bring it out on the terms of half profits to the author . The book appeared , and was well spoken of in one or two papers ; but profits there were none to divide . In the third year of his clerkship he wrote a novel in three volumes ; for this his publishers gave him twenty - five pounds , with again a promise of half the profits after deduction of the sum advanced . Again there was no pecuniary success . He had just got to work upon a third book , when his grandfather at Derby died and left him four hundred pounds . He could not resist the temptation to recover his freedom . Four hundred pounds , at the rate of eighty pounds a year , meant five years of literary endeavour . In that period he could certainly determine whether or not it was his destiny to live by the pen . In the meantime his relations with the secretary of the hospital , Carter by name , had grown very friendly . When Reardon began to publish books , the high - spirited Mr. Carter looked upon him with something of awe ; and when the literary man ceased to be a clerk , there was nothing to prevent association on equal terms between him and his former employer . They continued to see a good deal of each other , and Carter made Reardon acquainted with certain of his friends , among whom was one John Yule , an easy - going , selfish , semi - intellectual young man who had a place in a Government office . The time of solitude had gone by for Reardon . He began to develop the power that was in him . Those two books of his were not of a kind to win popularity . They dealt with no particular class of society ( unless one makes a distinct class of people who have brains ) , and they lacked local colour . Their interest was almost purely psychological . It was clear that the author had no faculty for constructing a story , and that pictures of active life were not to be expected of him ; he could never appeal to the multitude . But strong characterisation was within his scope , and an intellectual fervour , appetising to a small section of refined readers , marked all his best pages . He was the kind of man who can not struggle against adverse conditions , but whom prosperity warms to the exercise of his powers . Anything like the cares of responsibility would sooner or later harass him into unproductiveness . That he should produce much was in any case out of the question ; possibly a book every two or three years might not prove too great a strain upon his delicate mental organism , but for him to attempt more than that would certainly be fatal to the peculiar merit of his work . Of this he was dimly conscious , and , on receiving his legacy , he put aside for nearly twelve months the new novel he had begun . To give his mind a rest he wrote several essays , much maturer than those which had formerly failed to find acceptance , and two of these appeared in magazines . The money thus earned he spent — at a tailor 's . His friend Carter ventured to suggest this mode of outlay . His third book sold for fifty pounds . It was a great improvement on its predecessors , and the reviews were generally favourable . For the story which followed , '
26290	26499	26501	26501	me	0	' he received a hundred pounds . On the strength of that he spent six months travelling in the south of Europe . He returned to London at mid - June , and on the second day after his arrival befel an incident which was to control the rest of his life . Busy with the pictures in the Grosvenor Gallery , he heard himself addressed in a familiar voice , and on turning he was aware of Mr. Carter , resplendent in fashionable summer attire , and accompanied by a young lady of some charms . Reardon had formerly feared encounters of this kind , too conscious of the defects of his attire ; but at present there was no reason why he should shirk social intercourse . He was passably dressed , and the half year of travel had benefited his appearance in no slight degree . Carter presented him to the young lady , of whom the novelist had already heard as affianced to his friend . Whilst they stood conversing , there approached two ladies , evidently mother and daughter , whose attendant was another of Reardon 's acquaintances , Mr. John Yule . This gentleman stepped briskly forward and welcomed the returned wanderer . '

26526	26573	26516	26516	Your	895	' Reardon found himself in a position of which the novelty was embarrassing , but scarcely disagreeable . Here were five people grouped around him , all of whom regarded him unaffectedly as a man of importance ; for though , strictly speaking , he had no '
26575	26654	26501	26501	me	0	' at all , these persons had kept up with the progress of his small repute , and were all distinctly glad to number among their acquaintances an unmistakable author , one , too , who was fresh from Italy and Greece . Mrs. Yule , a lady rather too pretentious in her tone to be attractive to a man of Reardon 's refinement , hastened to assure him how well his books were known in her house , '
26668	26855	26501	26501	me	0	' Miss Yule , not at all pretentious in speech , and seemingly reserved of disposition , was good enough to show frank interest in the author . As for the poor author himself , well , he merely fell in love with Miss Yule at first sight , and there was an end of the matter . A day or two later he made a call at their house , in the region of Westbourne Park . It was a small house , and rather showily than handsomely furnished ; no one after visiting it would be astonished to hear that Mrs. Edmund Yule had but a small income , and that she was often put to desperate expedients to keep up the gloss of easy circumstances . In the gauzy and fluffy and varnishy little drawing - room Reardon found a youngish gentleman already in conversation with the widow and her daughter . This proved to be one Mr. Jasper Milvain , also a man of letters . Mr. Milvain was glad to meet Reardon , whose books he had read with decided interest . '

26908	27098	26895	26895	he	194	' Ten weeks thereafter , Miss Yule became Mrs. Reardon . It was a time of frantic exultation with the poor fellow . He had always regarded the winning of a beautiful and intellectual wife as the crown of a successful literary career , but he had not dared to hope that such a triumph would be his . Life had been too hard with him on the whole . He , who hungered for sympathy , who thought of a woman 's love as the prize of mortals supremely blessed , had spent the fresh years of his youth in monkish solitude . Now of a sudden came friends and flattery , aye , and love itself . He was rapt to the seventh heaven . Indeed , it seemed that the girl loved him . She knew that he had but a hundred pounds or so left over from that little inheritance , that his books sold for a trifle , that he had no wealthy relatives from whom he could expect anything ; yet she hesitated not a moment when he asked her to marry him .

He thought her beautiful beyond anything his heart had imagined ; her warm gold hair was the rapture of his eyes and of his reverent hand . Though slenderly fashioned , she was so gloriously strong .

No pretty petulance , no affectation of silly - sweet languishing , none of the weaknesses of woman . And so exquisitely fresh in her twenty years of maidenhood , with bright young eyes that seemed to bid defiance to all the years to come . He went about like one dazzled with excessive light . He talked as he had never talked before , recklessly , exultantly , insolently — in the nobler sense . He made friends on every hand ; he welcomed all the world to his bosom ; he felt the benevolence of a God . '

Why should there be delay ? Amy wished nothing but to become his wife . Idle to think of his doing any more work until he sat down in the home of which she was mistress . His brain burned with visions of the books he would henceforth write , but his hand was incapable of anything but a love - letter . And what letters ! Reardon never published anything equal to those . '
27579	27800	27573	27573	I	0	' Amy replied to one of them . And she was right ; not a letter , but a poem he had sent her , with every word on fire . The hours of talk ! It enraptured him to find how much she had read , and with what clearness of understanding . Latin and Greek , no . Ah ! but she should learn them both , that there might be nothing wanting in the communion between his thought and hers . For he loved the old writers with all his heart ; they had been such strength to him in his days of misery . They would go together to the charmed lands of the South . No , not now for their marriage holiday — Amy said that would be an imprudent expense ; but as soon as he had got a good price for a book . Will not the publishers be kind ? If they knew what happiness lurked in embryo within their foolish cheque - books ! He woke of a sudden in the early hours of one morning , a week before the wedding - day . You know that kind of awaking , so complete in an instant , caused by the pressure of some troublesome thought upon the dreaming brain . '

The chilling of brain and heart , the unnerving of the hands , the slow gathering about one of fear and shame and impotent wrath , the dread feeling of helplessness , of the world 's base indifference . Poverty ! Poverty ! And for hours he could not sleep . His eyes kept filling with tears , the beating of his heart was low ; and in his solitude he called upon Amy with pitiful entreaty : '
27948	27991	27992	27992	You	906	' But that went by . Six days , five days , four days — will one 's heart burst with happiness ? The flat is taken , is furnished , up there towards the sky , eight flights of stone steps . '
27993	28001	28003	28003	Milvain	186	're a confoundedly lucky fellow , Reardon , '
28016	28028	28003	28003	Milvain	186	' A good fellow , too , and you deserve it . '
28029	28039	27992	27992	You	906	' But at first I had a horrible suspicion . '
28040	28080	28003	28003	Milvain	186	' I guess what you mean . No ; I was n't even in love with her , though I admired her . She would never have cared for me in any case ; I am not sentimental enough . '
28081	28085	28003	28003	Milvain	186	' The deuce ! '
28086	28107	27992	27992	You	906	' I mean it in an inoffensive sense . She and I are rather too much alike , I fancy . '
28108	28114	28116	28116	Reardon	191	' How do you mean ? '
28126	28154	28116	28116	Reardon	191	' There 's a great deal of pure intellect about Miss Yule , you know . She was sure to choose a man of the passionate kind . '
28155	28167	28003	28003	Milvain	186	' I think you are talking nonsense , my dear fellow . '
28168	28232	28116	28116	Reardon	191	' Well , perhaps I am . To tell you the truth , I have by no means completed my study of women yet . It is one of the things in which I hope to be a specialist some day , though I do n't think I shall ever make use of it in novels — rather , perhaps , in life . '

29097	29103	29091	29091	he	186	' Does the infant flourish ? '
29104	29109	29067	29067	Amy	191	' Oh , yes ! '
29110	29129	29091	29091	he	186	' Reardon out ? I got back on Saturday evening , but could n't come round before this . '
29134	29179	29091	29091	he	186	' How close it is in here ! I suppose the roof gets so heated during the day . Glorious weather in the country ! And I 've no end of things to tell you . He wo n't be long , I suppose ? '
29180	29185	29186	29186	He	186	' I think not . '
29222	29230	29232	29232	Amy	191	' So you have been enjoying yourself ? '
29249	29269	29244	29244	she	936	' Oh , a little freshening of the faculties . But whose acquaintance do you think I have made ? '
29270	29274	29232	29232	Amy	191	' Down there ? '
29275	29305	29232	29232	Amy	191	' Yes . Your uncle Alfred and his daughter were staying at John Yule 's , and I saw something of them . I was invited to the house . '
29306	29313	29244	29244	she	936	' Did you speak of us ? '
29314	29376	29377	29377	Amy	191	' To Miss Yule only . I happened to meet her on a walk , and in a blundering way I mentioned Reardon 's name . But of course it did n't matter in the least . She inquired about you with a good deal of interest — asked if you were as beautiful as you promised to be years ago . '
29380	29393	29377	29377	Amy	191	' Does n't that proceed from your fertile invention , Mr. Milvain ? '
29394	29426	29377	29377	Amy	191	' Not a bit of it ! By - the - by , what would be your natural question concerning her ? Do you think she gave promise of good looks ? '
29427	29429	29377	29377	Amy	191	' I 'm
29450	29451	29452	29452	I	0	' '
29455	29470	29452	29452	I	0	' Jasper threw back his head and seemed to contemplate an object in memory . '

29580	29594	29579	29579	I	0	'm afraid . Seems to think with dread of a return to books . '
29595	29608	29579	29579	I	0	' Indeed ! But I had understood that she was a reader . '
29609	29677	29579	29579	I	0	' Reading enough for six people , probably . Perhaps her health is not very robust . Oh , I knew her by sight quite well — had seen her at the Reading - room . She 's the kind of girl that gets into one 's head , you know — suggestive ; much more in her than comes out until one knows her very well . '
29678	29686	29688	29688	Amy	191	' Well , I should hope so , '
29695	29720	29688	29688	Amy	191	' But that 's by no means a matter of course . They did n't invite me to come and see them in London . '
29721	29735	29579	29579	I	0	' I suppose Marian mentioned your acquaintance with this branch of the family ? '
29736	29752	29753	29753	Amy	191	' I think not . At all events , she promised me she would n't . '
29764	29769	29753	29753	Amy	191	' She promised you ? '
29770	29812	29813	29813	Amy	191	' Voluntarily . We got rather sympathetic . Your uncle — Alfred , I mean — is a remarkable man ; but I think he regarded me as a youth of no particular importance . Well , how do things go ? '
29818	29822	29813	29813	Amy	191	' No progress ? '
29823	29872	29753	29753	Amy	191	' None whatever . He ca n't work ; I begin to be afraid that he is really ill . He must go away before the fine weather is over . Do persuade him to - night ! I wish you could have had a holiday with him . '
29873	29881	29753	29753	Amy	191	' Out of the question now , I 'm
29907	29908	29753	29753	Amy	191	' '
29929	29942	29915	29915	One	4426	' — but it begins at length to matter a great deal . '
29943	30003	30004	30004	He	946	' I know , confound it all ! Think how it would amuse some rich grocer 's son who pitches his half - sovereign to the waiter when he has dined himself into good humour ! But I tell you what it is : you must really try to influence him towards practicality . Do n't you think — ? '
30014	30021	30022	30022	she	947	' I have made an attempt , '
30032	30037	30022	30022	she	947	' You really have ? '
30073	30081	30082	30082	she	947	' It seems very clear to me , '
30085	30126	30082	30082	she	947	' that a long book is out of the question for him at present . He writes so slowly , and is so fastidious . It would be a fatal thing to hurry through something weaker even than the last . '
30127	30136	30137	30137	Jasper	186	' You think " The Optimist " weak ? '
30143	30161	30137	30137	Jasper	186	' I do n't think it worthy of Edwin ; I do n't see how anyone can . '
30162	30184	30082	30082	she	947	' I have wondered what your opinion was . Yes , he ought to try a new tack , I think . '
30222	30229	30234	30234	himself	191	' Oh , there you are ! '
30265	30272	30247	30247	he	191	' When did you get back ? '
30312	30324	30309	30309	she	4456	' You 'll have some supper with us , Mr. Milvain ? '
30325	30333	30309	30309	she	4456	' I think I will , please . '
30388	30413	30370	30370	Jasper	186	' It was a curious coincidence — but , by - the- by , have you heard of what The Study has been doing ? '
30414	30421	30423	30423	Reardon	191	' I should rather think so , '
30430	30436	30423	30423	Reardon	191	' With no small satisfaction . '
30437	30444	30446	30447	his wife	4355	' Delicious , is n't it ? '
30449	30467	30446	30447	his wife	4355	' I thought it too good to be true when Edwin heard of it from Mr. Biffen . '
30492	30504	30506	30506	Jasper	186	' Oh , Biffen told you , did he ? Well , '
30508	30796	30506	30506	Jasper	186	' it was an odd thing , but when I reached my lodgings on Saturday evening there lay a note from Horace Barlow , inviting me to go and see him on Sunday afternoon out at Wimbledon , the special reason being that the editor of The Study would be there , and Barlow thought I might like to meet him . Now this letter gave me a fit of laughter ; not only because of those precious reviews , but because Alfred Yule had been telling me all about this same editor , who rejoices in the name of Fadge . Your uncle , Mrs. Reardon , declares that Fadge is the most malicious man in the literary profession ; though that 's saying such a very great deal — well , never mind ! Of course I was delighted to go and meet Fadge . At Barlow 's I found the queerest collection of people , most of them women of the inkiest description . The great Fadge himself surprised me ; I expected to see a gaunt , bilious man , and he was the rosiest and dumpiest little dandy you can imagine ; a fellow of forty - five , I dare say , with thin yellow hair and blue eyes and a manner of extreme innocence . Fadge flattered me with confidential chat , and I discovered at length why Barlow had asked me to meet him ; it 's Fadge that is going to edit Culpepper 's new monthly — you 've heard about it ? — and he had actually thought it worth while to enlist me among contributors ! Now , how 's that for a piece of news ? '
30811	30818	30820	30820	Reardon	191	' I rejoice to hear it ! '
30824	30831	30833	30833	Jasper	186	' You see ! you see ! '
30845	30860	30833	30833	Jasper	186	' all things come to the man who knows how to wait . But I 'm
30878	30901	30833	30833	Jasper	186	'm a man of distinction ! My doings have been noted ; the admirable qualities of my style have drawn attention ; I 'm
30990	30999	30989	30989	you	960	're not looking for anything of the kind . '
31000	31010	31012	31012	Amy	191	' What 's the new magazine to be called ? '
31014	31191	31012	31012	Amy	191	' Why , they propose The Current . Not bad , in a way ; though you imagine a fellow saying " Have you seen the current Current ? " At all events , the tone is to be up to date , and the articles are to be short ; no padding , merum sal from cover to cover . What do you think I have undertaken to do , for a start ? A paper consisting of sketches of typical readers of each of the principal daily and weekly papers . A deuced good idea , you know — my own , of course — but deucedly hard to carry out . I shall rise to the occasion , see if I do n't . I 'll rival Fadge himself in maliciousness — though I must confess I discovered no particular malice in the fellow 's way of talking . The article shall make a sensation . I 'll spend a whole month on it , and make it a perfect piece of satire . '
31192	31208	31210	31210	Reardon	191	' Now that 's the kind of thing that inspires me with awe and envy , '
31212	31227	31210	31210	Reardon	191	' I could no more write such a paper than an article on Fluxions . '
31228	31373	31012	31012	Amy	191	'' Tis my vocation , Hal ! You might think I had n't experience enough , to begin with . But my intuition is so strong that I can make a little experience go an immense way . Most people would imagine I had been wasting my time these last few years , just sauntering about , reading nothing but periodicals , making acquaintance with loafers of every description . The truth is , I have been collecting ideas , and ideas that are convertible into coin of the realm , my boy ; I have the special faculty of an extempore writer . Never in my life shall I do anything of solid literary value ; I shall always despise the people I write for . But my path will be that of success . I have always said it , and now I 'm
31378	31379	31210	31210	Reardon	191	' '
31389	31404	31407	31407	he	213	' inquired Reardon , when he had received this tirade with a friendly laugh . '
31461	31462	31453	31453	you	0	' '
31473	31474	31476	31476	I	0	' '
31501	31511	31500	31500	I	0	'm going to set my sisters afloat in literature . '
31512	31515	31500	31500	I	0	' How ? '
31516	31713	31500	31500	I	0	' Well , I do n't see why they should n't try their hands at a little writing , instead of giving lessons , which does n't suit them a bit . Last night , when I got back from Wimbledon , I went to look up Davies . Perhaps you do n't remember my mentioning him ; a fellow who was at Jolly and Monk 's , the publishers , up to a year ago . He edits a trade journal now , and I see very little of him . However , I found him at home , and had a long practical talk with him . I wanted to find out the state of the market as to such wares as Jolly and Monk dispose of . He gave me some very useful hints , and the result was that I went off this morning and saw Monk himself — no Jolly exists at present . " Mr. Monk , " I began , in my blandest tone — you know it — " I am requested to call upon you by a lady who thinks of preparing a little volume to be called '
31723	31790	31500	31500	I	0	' Her idea is , that " — and so on . Well , I got on admirably with Monk , especially when he learnt that I was to be connected with Culpepper 's new venture ; he smiled upon the project , and said he should be very glad to see a specimen chapter ; if that pleased him , we could then discuss terms . '
31791	31804	31806	31806	Amy	191	' But has one of your sisters really begun such a book ? '
31808	31901	31806	31806	Amy	191	' Neither of them knows anything of the matter , but they are certainly capable of doing the kind of thing I have in mind , which will consist largely of anecdotes of prominent statesmen . I myself shall write the specimen chapter , and send it to the girls to show them what I propose . I should n't wonder if they make some fifty pounds out of it . The few books that will be necessary they can either get at a Wattleborough library , or I can send them . '
31902	31913	31915	31915	Reardon	191	' Your energy is remarkable , all of a sudden , '
31917	31945	31915	31915	Reardon	191	' Yes . The hour has come , I find . " There is a tide " — to quote something that has the charm of freshness . '
32033	32043	32045	32045	Jasper	186	' I hear that you are still stuck fast , '
32055	32058	32045	32045	Jasper	186	' Yes . '
32059	32072	32045	32045	Jasper	186	' Getting rather serious , I should fear , is n't it ? '
32073	32076	32078	32078	Reardon	191	' Yes , '
32085	32120	32078	32078	Reardon	191	' Come , come , old man , you ca n't go on in this way . Would it , or would n't it , be any use if you took a seaside holiday ? '
32121	32151	32045	32045	Jasper	186	' Not the least . I am incapable of holiday , if the opportunity were offered . Do something I must , or I shall fret myself into imbecility . '
32152	32162	32045	32045	Jasper	186	' Very well . What is it to be ? '
32163	32192	32078	32078	Reardon	191	' I shall try to manufacture two volumes . They need n't run to more than about two hundred and seventy pages , and those well spaced out . '
32193	32238	32239	32239	Reardon	191	' This is refreshing . This is practical . But look now : let it be something rather sensational . Could n't we invent a good title — something to catch eye and ear ? The title would suggest the story , you know . '
32254	32259	32260	32260	he	191	' Let 's try , '
32283	32325	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' How would this do : " The Weird Sisters " ? Devilish good , eh ? Suggests all sorts of things , both to the vulgar and the educated . Nothing brutally clap - trap about it , you know . '
32326	32336	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' But — what does it suggest to you ? '
32337	32353	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' Oh , witch - like , mysterious girls or women . Think it over . '
32372	32378	32379	32379	he	191	' I have been trying , '
32399	32421	32379	32379	he	191	' to explain to myself how this state of things has come about . I almost think I can do so . '
32422	32425	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' How ? '
32426	32654	32655	32655	He	973	' That half - year abroad , and the extraordinary shock of happiness which followed at once upon it , have disturbed the balance of my nature . It was adjusted to circumstances of hardship , privation , struggle . A temperament like mine ca n't pass through such a violent change of conditions without being greatly affected ; I have never since been the man I was before I left England . The stage I had then reached was the result of a slow and elaborate building up ; I could look back and see the processes by which I had grown from the boy who was a mere book - worm to the man who had all but succeeded as a novelist . It was a perfectly natural , sober development . But in the last two years and a half I can distinguish no order . In living through it , I have imagined from time to time that my powers were coming to their ripest ; but that was mere delusion . Intellectually , I have fallen back . The probability is that this would n't matter , if only I could live on in peace of mind ; I should recover my equilibrium , and perhaps once more understand myself . But the due course of things is troubled by my poverty . '
32678	32683	32655	32655	He	973	' I can understand , '
32688	32718	32655	32655	He	973	' that there may be philosophical truth in all this . All the same , it 's a great pity that you should occupy your mind with such thoughts . '
32719	32755	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' A pity — no ! I must remain a reasoning creature . Disaster may end by driving me out of my wits , but till then I wo n't abandon my heritage of thought . '
32756	32777	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' Let us have it out , then . You think it was a mistake to spend those months abroad ? '
32778	32978	32979	32979	He	974	' A mistake from the practical point of view . That vast broadening of my horizon lost me the command of my literary resources . I lived in Italy and Greece as a student , concerned especially with the old civilisations ; I read little but Greek and Latin . That brought me out of the track I had laboriously made for myself ; I often thought with disgust of the kind of work I had been doing ; my novels seemed vapid stuff , so wretchedly and shallowly modern . If I had had the means , I should have devoted myself to the life of a scholar . That , I quite believe , is my natural life ; it 's only the influence of recent circumstances that has made me a writer of novels . A man who ca n't journalise , yet must earn his bread by literature , nowadays inevitably turns to fiction , as the Elizabethan men turned to the drama . Well , but I should have got back , I think , into the old line of work . It was my marriage that completed what the time abroad had begun . '
32987	33014	32979	32979	He	974	' I am speaking as if to myself . You , of course , do n't misunderstand me , and think I am accusing my wife . '
33015	33031	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' No , I do n't take you to mean that , by any means . '
33032	33125	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' No , no ; of course not All that 's wrong is my accursed want of money . But that threatens to be such a fearful wrong , that I begin to wish I had died before my marriage day . Then Amy would have been saved . The Philistines are right : a man has no business to marry unless he has a secured income equal to all natural demands . I behaved with the grossest selfishness . I might have known that such happiness was never meant for me . '
33126	33147	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' Do you mean by all this that you seriously doubt whether you will ever be able to write again ? '
33148	33157	33159	33159	Reardon	191	' In awful seriousness , I doubt it , '
33165	33185	33159	33159	Reardon	191	' It strikes me as extraordinary . In your position I should work as I never had done before . '
33186	33225	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' Because you are the kind of man who is roused by necessity . I am overcome by it . My nature is feeble and luxurious . I never in my life encounterd and overcame a practical difficulty . '
33226	33238	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' Yes ; when you got the work at the hospital . '
33239	33255	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' All I did was to write a letter , and chance made it effective . '
33256	33272	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' My view of the case , Reardon , is that you are simply ill . '
33273	33319	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' Certainly , I am ; but the ailment is desperately complicated . Tell me : do you think I might possibly get any kind of stated work to do ? Should I be fit for any place in a newspaper office , for instance ? '
33320	33338	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' I fear not . You are the last man to have anything to do with journalism . '
33339	33352	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' If I appealed to my publishers , could they help me ? '

33375	33385	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' Yes , there 's no help but that . '
33386	33402	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' If only you were able to write short stories , Fadge might be useful . '
33403	33473	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' But what 's the use ? I suppose I might get ten guineas , at most , for such a story . I need a couple of hundred pounds at least . Even if I could finish a three - volume book , I doubt if they would give me a hundred again , after the failure of " The Optimist " ; no , they would n't . '
33474	33586	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' But to sit and look forward in this way is absolutely fatal , my dear fellow . Get to work at your two - volume story . Call it " The Weird Sisters , " or anything better that you can devise ; but get it done , so many pages a day . If I go ahead as I begin to think I shall , I shall soon be able to assure you good notices in a lot of papers . Your misfortune has been that you had no influential friends . By - the - by , how has The Study been in the habit of treating you ? '
33587	33590	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' Scrubbily . '
33591	33651	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' I 'll make an opportunity of talking about your books to Fadge . I think Fadge and I shall get on pretty well together . Alfred Yule hates the man fiercely , for some reason or other . By the way , I may as well tell you that I broke short off with the Yules on purpose . '
33652	33655	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' Oh ? '
33656	33698	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' I had begun to think far too much about the girl . Would n't do , you know . I must marry someone with money , and a good deal of it . That 's a settled point with me . '
33699	33713	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' Then you are not at all likely to meet them in London ? '
33714	33754	32278	32278	Jasper	186	' Not at all . And if I get allied with Fadge , no doubt Yule will involve me in his savage feeling . You see how wisely I acted . I have a scent for the prudent course . '

34885	34932	34882	34882	he	957	' a long talk — a talk of vast importance . You know Walker ? No , no ; how should you ? He 's a man of business ; close friend of Rackett 's — Rackett , you know , the owner of The Study . '
34948	34956	34958	34958	Marian	211	' I have heard of Mr. Rackett , '
34960	34987	34958	34958	Marian	211	' Of course , of course . And you must also have heard that Fadge leaves The Study at the end of this year , eh ? '
34988	34996	35115	35115	Nat	246	' Father told me it was probable . '
34997	35098	35115	35115	Nat	246	' Rackett and he have done nothing but quarrel for months ; the paper is falling off seriously . Well , now , when I came across Nat Walker this afternoon , the first thing he said to me was , " You know Alfred Yule pretty well , I think ? " " Pretty well , " I answered ; " why ? " " I 'll tell you , " he said , " but it 's between you and me , you understand . Rackett is thinking about him in connection with The Study . " " I 'm

35247	35322	35323	35324	Miss Yule	206	' His suppressed laugh ended in a fit of coughing — the Reading - room cough . When he had recovered from it , he pressed Marian 's hand with paternal fervour , and waddled off to chatter with someone else . Marian replaced several books on the reference shelves , returned others to the central desk , and was just leaving the room , when again a voice made demand upon her attention . '
35333	35416	35417	35417	I	0	' It was a tall , meagre , dry - featured man , dressed with the painful neatness of self - respecting poverty : the edges of his coat - sleeves were carefully darned ; his black necktie and a skullcap which covered his baldness were evidently of home manufacture . He smiled softly and timidly with blue , rheumy eyes . Two or three recent cuts on his chin and neck were the result of conscientious shaving with an unsteady hand . '
35425	35433	35417	35417	I	0	' he said , as Marian turned . '

35939	36247	35930	35930	she	211	' walk reached her destination in a quiet by - way called St. Paul 's Crescent , consisting of small , decent houses . That at which she paused had an exterior promising comfort within ; the windows were clean and neatly curtained , and the polishable appurtenances of the door gleamed to perfection . She admitted herself with a latch - key , and went straight upstairs without encountering anyone . Descending again in a few moments , she entered the front room on the ground - floor . This served both as parlour and dining - room ; it was comfortably furnished , without much attempt at adornment . On the walls were a few auto - types and old engravings . A recess between fireplace and window was fitted with shelves , which supported hundreds of volumes , the overflow of Yule 's library . The table was laid for a meal . It best suited the convenience of the family to dine at five o'clock ; a long evening , so necessary to most literary people , was thus assured . Marian , as always when she had spent a day at the Museum , was faint with weariness and hunger ; she cut a small piece of bread from a loaf on the table , and sat down in an easy chair . Presently appeared a short , slight woman of middle age , plainly dressed in serviceable grey . Her face could never have been very comely , and it expressed but moderate intelligence ; its lines , however , were those of gentleness and good feeling . She had the look of one who is making a painful effort to understand something ; this was fixed upon her features , and probably resulted from the peculiar conditions of her life . '
36257	36274	36255	36255	Marian	211	' she said , as she closed the door and came forward to take a seat . '
36283	36284	36277	36277	I	0	' '
36294	36612	36277	36277	I	0	' Mrs. Yule 's speech was seldom ungrammatical , and her intonation was not flagrantly vulgar , but the accent of the London poor , which brands as with hereditary baseness , still clung to her words , rendering futile such propriety of phrase as she owed to years of association with educated people . In the same degree did her bearing fall short of that which distinguishes a lady . The London work - girl is rarely capable of raising herself , or being raised , to a place in life above that to which she was born ; she can not learn how to stand and sit and move like a woman bred to refinement , any more than she can fashion her tongue to graceful speech . Mrs. Yule 's behaviour to Marian was marked with a singular diffidence ; she looked and spoke affectionately , but not with a mother 's freedom ; one might have taken her for a trusted servant waiting upon her mistress . Whenever opportunity offered , she watched the girl in a curiously furtive way , that puzzled look on her face becoming very noticeable . Her consciousness was never able to accept as a familiar and unimportant fact the vast difference between herself and her daughter . Marian 's superiority in native powers , in delicacy of feeling , in the results of education , could never be lost sight of . Under ordinary circumstances she addressed the girl as if tentatively ; however sure of anything from her own point of view , she knew that Marian , as often as not , had quite a different criterion . She understood that the girl frequently expressed an opinion by mere reticence , and hence the carefulness with which , when conversing , she tried to discover the real effect of her words in Marian 's features . '
36617	36628	36629	36629	You	1019	' she said , seeing the crust Marian was nibbling . '

To her husband she scarcely ever ventured to speak of these persons ; Yule had no intercourse with them . But Marian was always willing to listen sympathetically , and her mother often exhibited a touching gratitude for this condescension — as she deemed it . '
36765	36770	36685	36685	Holloway	45	' the girl inquired . '

37301	37311	37298	37298	she	208	' What a thing that would be for us ! '
37351	37357	37359	37360	Mrs. Yule	208	' It 's for you , '

37381	37396	37370	37370	Marian	211	' It must be one of the Miss Milvains . Yes ; Dora Milvain . '
37470	37478	37480	37480	Dora	188	' It will amuse you to hear , '
37482	37647	37480	37480	Dora	188	' that the literary project our brother mentioned in a letter whilst you were still here is really to come to something . He has sent us a specimen chapter , written by himself , of the " Child 's History of Parliament , " and Maud thinks she could carry it on in that style , if there 's no hurry . She and I have both set to work on English histories , and we shall be authorities before long . Jolly and Monk offer thirty pounds for the little book , if it suits them when finished , with certain possible profits in the future . Trust Jasper for making a bargain ! So perhaps our literary career will be something more than a joke , after all . I hope it may ; anything rather than a life of teaching . We shall be so glad to hear from you , if you still care to trouble about country girls . '

37793	37909	37788	37788	I	0	' It was very rare indeed for these two to touch upon any subject save those of everyday interest . In spite of the affection between them , their exchange of confidence did not go very far ; Mrs. Yule , who had never exercised maternal authority since Marian 's earliest childhood , claimed no maternal privileges , and Marian 's natural reserve had been strengthened by her mother 's respectful aloofness . The English fault of domestic reticence could scarcely go further than it did in their case ; its exaggeration is , of course , one of the characteristics of those unhappy families severed by differences of education between the old and young .

37933	37960	37961	37961	I	0	' She wished to know if her mother had heard any private remarks on this subject , but she could not bring herself to ask directly . '

38379	38521	38522	38523	Mr. Quarmby	245	' Marian resented this unreasonable anger , but she durst not reply . At that moment the servant appeared with a smoking joint , and Mrs. Yule followed carrying dishes of vegetables . The man of letters seated himself and carved angrily . He began his meal by drinking half a glass of ale ; then he ate a few mouthfuls in a quick , hungry way , his head bent closely over the plate . It happened commonly enough that dinner passed without a word of conversation , and that seemed likely to be the case this evening . To his wife Yule seldom addressed anything but a curt inquiry or caustic comment ; if he spoke humanly at table it was to Marian . Ten minutes passed ; then Marian resolved to try any means of clearing the atmosphere . '

I do n't like you to look upon your father as a thickhead who could n't be expected to succeed . Look at Fadge . He married a woman of good social position ; she brought him friends and influence . But for that , he would never have been editor of The Study , a place for which he was n't in the least fit . But he was able to give dinners ; he and his wife went into society ; everybody knew him and talked of him . How has it been with me ? I live here like an animal in its hole , and go blinking about if by chance I find myself among the people with whom I ought naturally to associate . If I had been able to come in direct contact with Rackett and other men of that kind , to dine with them , and have them to dine with me , to belong to a club , and so on , I should n't be what I am at my age . My one opportunity — when I edited The Balance — was n't worth much ; there was no money behind the paper ; we could n't hold out long enough . But even then , if I could have assumed my proper social standing , if I could have opened my house freely to the right kind of people — How was it possible ? '

49456	49564	49419	49419	I	0	' Well , it 's our hope that they may be able to . Of course there 's no chance of their earning enough to live upon for some time . But the matter stands like this . They have a trifling sum of money , on which , at a pinch , they could live in London for perhaps a year and a half . In that time they may find their way to a sort of income ; at all events , the chances are that a year and a half hence I shall be able to help them to keep body and soul together . '
49652	49660	49662	49662	Marian	211	' They have made a good beginning , '
49737	49750	49751	49751	Jasper	186	' It 's better than if they had done nothing at all , '
49757	49789	49751	49751	Jasper	186	' And the way they knocked that trifle together promises well . They did it very quickly , and in a far more workmanlike way than I should have thought possible . '
49790	49799	49751	49751	Jasper	186	' No doubt they share your own talent . '
49800	49905	49751	49751	Jasper	186	' Perhaps so . Of course I know that I have talent of a kind , though I do n't rate it very high . We shall have to see whether they can do anything more than mere bookseller 's work ; they are both very young , you know . I think they may be able to write something that 'll do for The English Girl , and no doubt I can hit upon a second idea that will appeal to Jolly and Monk . At all events they 'll have books within reach , and better opportunities every way than at Finden . '
49906	49918	49751	49751	Jasper	186	' How do their friends in the country think of it ? '
49919	50046	49751	49751	Jasper	186	' Very dubiously ; but then what else was to be expected ? Of course , the respectable and intelligible path marked out for both of them points to a lifetime of governessing . But the girls have no relish for that ; they 'd rather do almost anything . We talked over all the aspects of the situation seriously enough — it is desperately serious , no doubt of that . I told them fairly all the hardships they would have to face — described the typical London lodgings , and so on . Still , there 's an adventurous vein in them , and they decided for the risk . If it came to the worst I suppose they could still find governess work . '
50047	50054	49751	49751	Jasper	186	' Let us hope better things . '
50055	50170	49751	49751	Jasper	186	' Yes . But now , I should have felt far more reluctant to let them come here in this way had n't it been that they regard you as a friend . To - morrow morning you will probably hear from one or both of them . Perhaps it would have been better if I had left them to tell you all this , but I felt I should like to see you and — put it in my own way . I think you 'll understand this feeling , Miss Yule . I wanted , in fact , to hear from yourself that you would be a friend to the poor girls . '
50171	50190	49751	49751	Jasper	186	' Oh , you already know that ! I shall be so very glad to see them often . '
50252	50341	50245	50245	Jasper	186	' In that case they wo n't miss the comfort of home so much . Of course they will have to go into very modest lodgings indeed . I have already been looking about . I should like to find rooms for them somewhere near my own place ; it 's a decent neighbourhood , and the park is at hand , and then they would n't be very far from you . They thought it might be possible to make a joint establishment with me , but I 'm

50663	50817	50648	50648	I	0	' said Marian , with tact . She thought uneasily of her mother in the next room . To her there appeared no reason whatever why Jasper should not be introduced to Mrs. Yule , yet she could not venture to propose it . Remembering her father 's last remarks about Milvain in connection with Fadge 's magazine , she must wait for distinct permission before offering the young man encouragement to repeat his visit . Perhaps there was complicated trouble in store for her ; impossible to say how her father 's deep - rooted and rankling antipathies might affect her intercourse even with the two girls . But she was of independent years , she must be allowed the choice of her own friends . The pleasure she had in seeing Jasper under this roof , in hearing him talk with such intimate friendliness , strengthened her to resist timid thoughts . '
50824	50828	50829	50829	I	0	' she asked . '

50937	50954	50955	50955	Mother	266	' Marian looked at him with startled eyes . His tone was quite unfamiliar to her . '
50960	50964	50955	50955	Mother	266	' he continued . '
51041	51083	51040	51040	I	0	'm sorry for it . I wish I had found some way of supporting myself . The end of mother 's life was made far more unhappy than it need have been . I should like you to understand all this . '
51093	51103	51104	51104	Jasper	186	' Perhaps the girls have hinted it to you ? '
51107	51110	51104	51104	Jasper	186	' No . '
51111	51193	51194	51194	Marian	211	' Selfishness — that 's one of my faults . It is n't a brutal kind of selfishness ; the thought of it often enough troubles me . If I were rich , I should be a generous and good man ; I know I should . So would many another poor fellow whose worst features come out under hardship . This is n't a heroic type ; of course not . I am a civilised man , that 's all . '
51199	51334	51335	51335	She	1409	' You wonder why I am so impertinent as to talk about myself like this . I have gone through a good deal of mental pain these last few weeks , and somehow I ca n't help showing you something of my real thoughts . Just because you are one of the few people I regard with sincere respect . I do n't know you very well , but quite well enough to respect you . My sisters think of you in the same way . I shall do many a base thing in life , just to get money and reputation ; I tell you this that you may n't be surprised if anything of that kind comes to your ears . I ca n't afford to live as I should like to . '
51344	51360	51335	51335	She	1409	' People who are going to live unworthily do n't declare it in this way . '
51361	51398	51399	51399	He	1410	' I ought n't to ; a few minutes ago I had no intention of saying such things . It means I am rather overstrung , I suppose ; but it 's all true , unfortunately . '
51415	51426	51431	51431	he	1410	' Well , now I will go , Miss Yule . '
51434	51441	51442	51442	he	1410	' It 's all very well , '
51446	51488	51442	51442	he	1410	' for me to encourage my sisters in the hope that they may earn a living ; but suppose I ca n't even do it myself ? It 's by no means certain that I shall make ends meet this year . '
51489	51500	51399	51399	He	1410	' You have every reason to hope , I think . '
51501	51605	51442	51442	he	1410	' I like to hear people say that , but it 'll mean savage work . When we were all at Finden last year , I told the girls that it would be another twelve months before I could support myself . Now I am forced to do it . And I do n't like work ; my nature is lazy . I shall never write for writing 's sake , only to make money . All my plans and efforts will have money in view — all . I sha n't allow anything to come in the way of my material advancement . '
51606	51613	51615	51615	Marian	211	' I wish you every success , '
51627	51653	51615	51615	Marian	211	' Thank you . But that sounds too much like good - bye . I trust we are to be friends , for all that ? '
51654	51663	51664	51664	They	1412	' Indeed , I hope we may be . '
51683	51695	51680	51680	he	1411	' Did you read that thing of mine in The Current ? '
51696	51702	51615	51615	Marian	211	' Yes , I did . '
51703	51712	51615	51615	Marian	211	' It was n't bad , I think ? '
51713	51721	51615	51615	Marian	211	' It seemed to me very clever . '
51722	51778	51779	51779	Marian	211	' Clever — yes , that 's the word . It had a success , too . I have as good a thing half done for the April number , but I 've felt too heavy - hearted to go on with it . The girls shall let you know when they are in town . '
52759	52761	52745	52745	he	195	' thin '
53148	53158	53488	53488	He	1437	' What could I make of that , now ? '
53159	53168	53488	53488	He	1437	' Well , suppose I made him — ? '
53169	53450	53488	53488	He	1437	' But no , that would n't do , and so on . It had happened that he caught the eye of some one passing fixed in surprise upon him ; so young a man to be talking to himself in evident distress ! The expected crisis came , even now that he was savagely determined to go on at any cost , to write , let the result be what it would . His will prevailed . A day or two of anguish such as there is no describing to the inexperienced , and again he was dismissing slip after slip , a sigh of thankfulness at the completion of each one . It was a fraction of the whole , a fraction , a fraction . The ordering of his day was thus . At nine , after breakfast , he sat down to his desk , and worked till one . Then came dinner , followed by a walk . As a rule he could not allow Amy to walk with him , for he had to think over the remainder of the day 's toil , and companionship would have been fatal . At about half - past three he again seated himself , and wrote until half - past six , when he had a meal . Then once more to work from half - past seven to ten . Numberless were the experiments he had tried for the day 's division . The slightest interruption of the order for the time being put him out of gear ; Amy durst not open his door to ask however necessary a question . Sometimes the three hours '

53714	53719	53720	53720	she	1439	' What is it ? '

53743	53784	53720	53720	she	1439	' In ten minutes she appeared . There was apprehension on her face ; she feared he was going to lament his inability to work . Instead of that , he told her joyfully that the first volume was finished . '
53788	53792	53720	53720	she	1439	' she exclaimed . '

Reardon brought a high - backed chair to the fireside , and allowed himself to forget the two volumes that had still to be struggled through , in a grateful sense of the portion that was achieved . In a few minutes it occured to him that it would be delightful to read a scrap of the '
53921	53949	53958	53958	mortals	1441	' ; he went to the shelves on which were his classical books , took the desired volume , and opened it where Odysseus speaks to Nausicaa : '
54003	54063	53988	53988	I	0	' Yes , yes ; that was not written at so many pages a day , with a workhouse clock clanging its admonition at the poet 's ear . How it freshened the soul ! How the eyes grew dim with a rare joy in the sounding of those nobly sweet hexameters ! Amy came into the room again . '
54066	54079	53988	53988	I	0	' said Reardon , looking up at her with a bright smile . '
54092	54105	54087	54087	I	0	' And he turned the speech into free prose . Amy laughed . '
54163	54202	54151	54151	I	0	' The cheerful news had brightened her . If she had been summoned to hear lamentations her voice would not have rippled thus soothingly . Reardon thought of this , and it made him silent for a minute . '

54240	54271	54233	54233	Milvain	186	' With curious frequency she mentioned the name of Milvain . Her unconsciousness in doing so prevented Reardon from thinking about the fact ; still , he had noted it . '
54279	54283	54273	54273	you	1437	' he asked . '
54306	54347	54303	54303	I	0	' In the light of this answer he mused upon her readily - offered instance . True , he had occasionally spoken of Jasper with something less than respect , but Amy was not in the habit of doing so . '

54797	54822	54787	54787	Reardon	191	' A very small , poor hope . Hope of money enough to struggle through another half year , if indeed enough for that . '
54886	54901	54883	54883	She	1451	' Let us face the worst and talk of it together , you and I. '
54944	54997	54928	54928	he	191	' Yes , there 's hope once more , my dearest . No more gloomy talk to - night ! I have read you something , now you shall read something to me ; it is a long time since I delighted myself with listening to you . What shall it be ? '

55134	55159	55128	55128	he	191	' There ought to be a huge public crèche in London . It 's monstrous that an educated mother should have to be nursemaid . '

55282	55322	55236	55236	she	463	' But that 's really a paltry sum . What would fifty novelists you could name say if they were offered three hundred pounds for a book ? How much do you suppose even Markland got for his last ? '
55323	55339	55236	55236	she	463	' Did n't sell it at all , ten to one . Gets a royalty . '
55340	55359	55263	55263	He	191	' Which will bring him five or six hundred pounds before the book ceases to be talked of . '

In a few minutes it was as if no difficulties threatened their life . Every now and then Reardon looked up from his translating with a delighted laugh , in which Amy joined . When he had returned the book to the shelf he stepped behind his wife 's chair , leaned upon it , and put his cheek against hers . '

56096	56159	56074	56074	People	4392	' He did not dare to make any reply to this . Amy was so exasperatingly womanlike in avoiding the important issue to which he tried to confine her ; another moment , and his tone would be that of irritation . So he turned away and sat down to his desk , as if he had some thought of resuming work . '
56168	56174	56074	56074	People	4392	' Amy asked , rising . '

56280	56408	56276	56276	you	4377	' The result of all this was , of course , that he sat down in anything but the right mood to his work next morning . Amy 's anticipation of criticism had made it harder than ever for him to labour at what he knew to be bad . And , as ill - luck would have it , in a day or two he caught his first winter 's cold . For several years a succession of influenzas , sore - throats , lumbagoes , had tormented him from October to May ; in planning his present work , and telling himself that it must be finished before Christmas , he had not lost sight of these possible interruptions . But he said to himself : '
56425	56506	56419	56419	I	0	' All very well , but Reardon did not belong to the heroic class . A feverish cold now put his powers and resolution to the test . Through one hideous day he nailed himself to the desk — and wrote a quarter of a page . The next day Amy would not let him rise from bed ; he was wretchedly ill . In the night he had talked about his work deliriously , causing her no slight alarm . '
56512	56521	56419	56419	I	0	' she said to him in the morning , '

56549	56783	56528	56528	You	0	' Rest had indeed become out of the question . For two days he could not write , but the result upon his mind was far worse than if he had been at the desk . He looked a haggard creature when he again sat down with the accustomed blank slip before him . The second volume ought to have been much easier work than the first ; it proved far harder . Messieurs and mesdames the critics are wo nt to point out the weakness of second volumes ; they are generally right , simply because a story which would have made a tolerable book ( the common run of stories ) refuses to fill three books . Reardon 's story was in itself weak , and this second volume had to consist almost entirely of laborious padding . If he wrote three slips a day he did well . And the money was melting , melting , despite Amy 's efforts at economy . She spent as little as she could ; not a luxury came into their home ; articles of clothing all but indispensable were left unpurchased . But to what purpose was all this ? Impossible , now , that the book should be finished and sold before the money had all run out . At the end of November , Reardon said to his wife one morning : '

58536	58568	58480	58480	Edith	276	' And you are sitting alone , as usual . I feared you might be out ; an afternoon of sunshine is n't to be neglected at this time of year . '
58569	58574	58575	58575	Amy	191	' Is there sunshine ? '
58579	58621	58575	58575	Amy	191	' Why , look ! Do you mean to say you have n't noticed it ? What a comical person you are sometimes ! I suppose you have been over head and ears in books all day . How is Willie ? '
58622	58629	58652	58653	the servant	438	' Very well , thank you . '
58630	58637	58575	58575	Amy	191	' May n't I see him ? '
58638	58643	58644	58644	Amy	191	' If you like . '
58749	58758	58760	58760	Edith	276	' Well , if this is n't marvellous ! '
58762	58774	58745	58745	Reardon	191	' I should as soon have expected the heavens to fall ! '
58775	58779	58781	58781	Reardon	191	' As what ? '
58788	58799	58781	58781	Reardon	191	' As you to show yourself when I am here . '
58800	58826	58745	58745	Reardon	191	' I should like to say that I came on purpose to see you , Mrs. Carter , but it would n't be true . I 'm

58854	58864	58847	58847	Amy	191	' said Amy , with a look of surprise . '
58874	58901	58781	58781	Reardon	191	' He just inquired of Mrs. Carter how her husband was , and withdrew . The door of the flat was heard to close after him . '
58911	58966	58781	58781	Reardon	191	' said Amy , again in rather a cold voice . On Reardon 's desk were lying slips of blank paper . Edith , approaching on tiptoe with what was partly make - believe , partly genuine , awe , looked at the literary apparatus , then turned with a laugh to her friend . '
59006	59007	59009	59009	you	191	' '
59011	59012	59009	59009	you	191	' '
59015	59043	59009	59009	you	191	'm sure I do n't know how you can resist the temptation . I feel sure you could write books almost as clever as your husband 's . '
59044	59052	59009	59009	you	191	' I have no intention of trying . '
59053	59066	59009	59009	you	191	' You do n't seem very well to - day , Amy . '
59067	59079	59080	59080	She	1564	' Oh , I think I am as well as usual . '
59102	59110	59112	59112	Edith	276	' One of my reasons for coming , '
59114	59149	59112	59112	Edith	276	' was to beg and entreat and implore you and Mr. Reardon to dine with us next Wednesday . Now do n't put on such a severe face ! Are you engaged that evening ? '
59150	59166	59080	59080	She	1564	' Yes ; in the ordinary way . Edwin ca n't possibly leave his work . '
59167	59183	59112	59112	Edith	276	' But for one poor evening ! It 's such ages since we saw you . '
59184	59186	59112	59112	Edith	276	' I 'm
59205	59230	59190	59190	I	0	' Amy spoke thus at the prompting of a sudden impulse . A minute ago , no such definite declaration was in her mind . '

59258	59276	59277	59277	You	276	' Amy replied , her explanation just as much of an impromptu as the announcement had been . '
59331	59340	59341	59341	You	276	' Edith listened with a face of astonishment . '
59348	59352	59341	59341	You	276	' she exclaimed . '

59401	59454	59455	59455	I	0	' Edith could not help conjecturing the true significance of this resolve . But , as is commonly the case with people in easy circumstances , she found it hard to believe that her friends were so straitened as to have a difficulty in supporting the ordinary obligations of a civilised state . '
59465	59480	59455	59455	I	0	' she added , as if to remove the effect of her last remark . '
59530	59551	59563	59563	Edith	276	'm sure you understand me , Amy . Do n't refuse just to come to our house now and then . '

59668	59708	59660	59660	Edwin	195	' She spoke distantly ; it irritated her to have to invent excuses for the sacrifice she had just imposed on herself . Edith sipped the tea which had been offered her , and for a minute kept silence . '
59719	59725	59726	59726	I	0	' she asked at length . '
59727	59739	59660	59660	Edwin	195	'm sure I do n't know . Not before the spring . '
59740	59777	59778	59778	She	1579	' I shall look so anxiously for it . Whenever I meet new people I always turn the conversation to novels , just for the sake of asking them if they know your husband 's books . '
59782	59793	59795	59795	Amy	191	' Which is seldom the case , I should think , '
59802	59880	59795	59795	Amy	191	' Well , my dear , you do n't expect ordinary novel - readers to know about Mr. Reardon . I wish my acquaintances were a better kind of people ; then , of course , I should hear of his books more often . But one has to make the best of such society as offers . If you and your husband forsake me , I shall feel it a sad loss ; I shall indeed . '
59892	59903	59904	59904	she	1581	' Oh , we must be friends just the same , '
59915	59955	59904	59904	she	1581	' But do n't ask us to come and dine just now . All through this winter we shall be very busy , both of us . Indeed , we have decided not to accept any invitations at all . '
59956	60045	59887	59888	the speaker	957	' Then , so long as you let me come here now and then , I must give in . I promise not to trouble you with any more complaining . But how you can live such a life I do n't know . I consider myself more of a reader than women generally are , and I should be mortally offended if anyone called me frivolous ; but I must have a good deal of society . Really and truly , I ca n't live without it . '
60046	60049	60051	60051	Amy	191	' No ? '
60069	60084	60085	60085	She	1582	' There 's no knowing ; perhaps if I had married a literary man — '
60092	60102	60103	60103	She	1582	' But then I have n't , you see . '
60106	60118	60103	60103	She	1582	' Albert is anything but a bookworm , as you know . '
60119	60128	59887	59888	the speaker	957	' You would n't wish him to be . '
60129	60181	60103	60103	She	1582	' Oh no ! Not a bookworm . To be sure , we suit each other very well indeed . He likes society just as much as I do . It would be the death of him if he did n't spend three - quarters of every day with lively people . '
60182	60200	60201	60201	They	1583	' That 's rather a large portion . But then you count yourself among the lively ones . '
60209	60227	60228	60228	Edith	276	' Of course you think me rather silly to want to talk so much with silly people , '
60232	60280	60228	60228	Edith	276	' But then there 's generally some amusement to be got , you know . I do n't take life quite so seriously as you do . People are people after all ; it 's good fun to see how they live and hear how they talk . '
60426	60432	60433	60433	he	1589	' What do you ask ? '
60441	60451	60452	60452	Reardon	191	' I prefer that you should make an offer , '
60466	60477	60452	60452	Reardon	191	' I ca n't say more than two pounds ten . '
60478	60490	60452	60452	Reardon	191	' That is at the rate of sixpence a volume — ? '
60491	60505	60550	60550	he	191	' To me that 's about the average value of books like these . '
60543	60549	60550	60550	he	191	' I 'll take it , '
60782	60784	60775	60775	he	191	' I 'm

As a rule he made it a day of rest , and almost perforce , for the depressing influence of Sunday in London made work too difficult . Then , it was the day on which he either went to see his own particular friends or wa visited by them . '
60903	60907	60908	60908	Biffen	235	' Amy inquired . '
60920	60921	60922	60922	I	0	' '

60974	61007	60961	60961	they	1600	' He pointed in a direction that suggested Marylebone Workhouse . Amy tried to laugh , but a woman with a child in her arms has no keen relish for such jokes . '

61027	61338	61008	61008	I	0	' She left home about three o'clock , the servant going with her to carry the child . At five a familiar knock sounded through the flat ; it was a heavy rap followed by half a dozen light ones , like a reverberating echo , the last stroke scarcely audible . Reardon laid down his book , but kept his pipe in his mouth , and went to the door . A tall , thin man stood there , with a slouch hat and long grey overcoat . He shook hands silently , hung his hat in the passage , and came forward into the study . His name was Harold Biffen , and , to judge from his appearance , he did not belong to the race of common mertals . His excessive meagreness would all but have qualified him to enter an exhibition in the capacity of living skeleton , and the garments which hung upon this framework would perhaps have sold for three and sixpence at an old - clothes dealer 's . But the man was superior to these accidents of flesh and raiment . He had a fine face : large , gentle eyes , nose slightly aquiline , small and delicate mouth . Thick black hair fell to his coat - collar ; he wore a heavy moustache and a full beard . In his gait there was a singular dignity ; only a man of cultivated mind and graceful character could move and stand as he did . His first act on entering the room was to take from his pocket a pipe , a pouch , a little tobacco - stopper , and a box of matches , all of which he arranged carefully on a corner of the central table . Then he drew forward a chair and seated himself . '

61429	61448	61449	61449	I	0	' were the visitor 's next words . Reardon offered him a volume of the Oxford Pocket Classics . '

61491	61524	61525	61525	Reardon	191	'm sorry to hear that ; very sorry . Well , this must do . Now , I want to know how you scan this chorus in the " Oedipus Rex . " '

61551	61577	61578	61578	He	191	' Possible , of course ; but treat them as Ionics a minore with an anacrusis , and see if they do n't go better . '

Candidates of this stamp frequently advertise in the newspapers for cheap tuition , or answer advertisements which are intended to appeal to them ; they pay from sixpence to half a crown an hour — rarely as much as the latter sum . Occasionally it happened that Harold Biffen had three or four such pupils in hand , and extraordinary stories he could draw from his large experience in this sphere . Then as to his authorship . — But shortly after the discussion of Greek metres he fell upon the subject of his literary projects , and , by no means for the first time , developed the theory on which he worked .

Even when they happen , by - the - by , it is in a shape that would be useless to the ordinary novelist ; he would have to cut away this circumstance , and add that . Why ? I should like to know . Such conventionalism results from stage necessities . Fiction has n't yet outgrown the influence of the stage on which it originated . Whatever a man writes for effect is wrong and bad . '

It was because that blackguard review of " On Neutral Ground " clumsily hinted this that I first thought of you with interest . No , no ; let us copy life . When the man and woman are to meet for a great scene of passion , let it all be frustrated by one or other of them having a bad cold in the head , and so on . Let the pretty girl get a disfiguring pimple on her nose just before the ball at which she is going to shine . Show the numberless repulsive features of common decent life . Seriously , coldly ; not a hint of facetiousness , or the thing becomes different . '

63930	63939	63928	63928	Reardon	191	' The last was n't altogether a failure . '
63940	63990	63882	63882	Milvain	186	' Very nearly . And this one consists of nothing but a series of conversations between two people . It is really a dialogue , not a novel at all . He read me some twenty pages , and I no longer wondered that he could n't sell it . '
63991	64000	63882	63882	Milvain	186	' Oh , but it has considerable merit , '
64005	64012	64003	64003	Biffen	235	' The talk is remarkably true . '
64013	64026	64028	64028	Jasper	186	' But what 's the good of talk that leads to nothing ? '
64030	64039	64028	64028	Jasper	186	' It 's a bit of real life . '
64040	64082	63882	63882	Milvain	186	' Yes , but it has no market value . You may write what you like , so long as people are willing to read you . Whelpdale 's a clever fellow , but he ca n't hit a practical line . '
64083	64093	64095	64095	Reardon	191	' Like some other people I have heard of , '
64099	64125	64095	64095	Reardon	191	' But the odd thing is , that he always strikes one as practical - minded . Do n't you feel that , Mrs. Reardon ? '

64200	64227	64175	64175	Amy	191	' Partly , I should think , because it 's the warmer of the two ; partly , perhaps , because the other would fetch more . '

64261	64304	64305	64305	Amy	191	' Oh yes . But I could see he did n't like to take as much as he wanted . I do n't think of him with so much pity as I used to ; that 's a result of suffering oneself . '

His parcel under his arm , he entered the ground - floor office , and desired to see that member of the firm with whom he had previously had personal relations . This gentleman was not in town ; he would be away for a few days . Reardon left the manuscript , and came out into the street again . He crossed , and looked up at the publishers '

She must come and speak when she would . At six o'clock she showed her face in the doorway and asked if he would come to tea . '

66775	66843	66895	66895	Reardon	191	' A doleful Christmas . Week after week went by and Reardon knew that Amy must have exhausted the money he had given her . But she made no more demands upon him , and necessaries were paid for in the usual way . He suffered from a sense of humiliation ; sometimes he found it difficult to look in his wife 's face . When the publishers '

66939	66945	66947	66947	Amy	191	' Shall you accept this ? '

67478	67694	67476	67477	the publishers	4557	' offer , and now again when he was asking himself how he should use the respite granted him , Reardon spent his days at the British Museum . He could not read to much purpose , but it was better to sit here among strangers than seem to be idling under Amy 's glance . Sick of imaginative writing , he turned to the studies which had always been most congenial , and tried to shape out a paper or two like those he had formerly disposed of to editors . Among his unused material lay a mass of notes he had made in a reading of Diogenes Laertius , and it seemed to him now that he might make something saleable out of these anecdotes of the philosophers . In a happier mood he could have written delightfully on such a subject — not learnedly , but in the strain of a modern man whose humour and sensibility find free play among the classic ghosts ; even now he was able to recover something of the light touch which had given value to his published essays . Meanwhile the first number of The Current had appeared , and Jasper Milvain had made a palpable hit . Amy spoke very often of the article called '
67698	67778	67779	67779	I	0	' and her interest in its author was freely manifested . Whenever a mention of Jasper came under her notice she read it out to her husband . Reardon smiled and appeared glad , but he did not care to discuss Milvain with the same frankness as formerly . One evening at the end of January he told Amy what he had been writing at the Museum , and asked her if she would care to hear it read . '

You lament that I ca n't write in that attractive way . Well , I lament it myself — for your sake . I wish I had Milvain 's peculiar talent , so that I could get reputation and money . But I have n't , and there 's an end of it . It irritates a man to be perpetually told of his disadvantages . '

Then she turns up as a newspaper correspondent at the Cape . Gave up that , and took to some kind of farming , I forget where . Married again ( first husband lost in aforementioned shipwreck ) , this time a Baptist minister , and began to devote herself to soup - kitchens in Liverpool . Husband burned to death , somewhere .

They had only been once to the house since then , again without meeting Mr. Yule . Marian , however , visited them at their lodgings frequently ; now and then she met Jasper there . The latter never spoke of her father , and there was no question of inviting him to repeat his call . In the end , Marian was obliged to speak on the subject with her mother . Mrs. Yule offered an occasion by asking when the Miss Milvains were coming again . '

73693	73713	73672	73672	you	4411	' She could not miss his meaning ; astonishment held her mute for a moment , then she said : '

73759	73764	73749	73749	You	4448	' she replied quietly . '
73774	73789	73766	73766	I	0	' He looked keenly at her . He had expected a more decided protest . '

73839	73848	73835	73835	I	0	' he continued , hardening face and voice , '
73857	73978	73835	73835	I	0	' Yule was conscious of untruth in this statement , but his mood would not allow him to speak ingenously , and he wished to note the effect upon Marian of what he said . There were two beliefs in him : on the one hand , he recognised Fadge in every line of the writing ; on the other , he had a perverse satisfaction in convincing himself that it was Milvain who had caught so successfully the master 's manner . He was not the kind of man who can resist an opportunity of justifying , to himself and others , a course into which he has been led by mingled feelings , all more or less unjustifiable . '
73984	73993	73981	73981	Jedwood	292	' asked Marian . Yule shrugged his shoulders . '
74007	74008	73981	73981	Jedwood	292	' '

74040	74041	73981	73981	Jedwood	292	' '
74057	74058	74043	74044	Mr. Milvain	186	' '
74084	74099	74067	74067	Milvain	186	' Marian reflected . When she raised her eyes again they were perfectly calm . '
74108	74109	74103	74103	you	1874	' '
74130	74131	74124	74124	you	1874	' '
74140	74496	74132	74132	You	1874	' Marian replied , and therewith went from the room . She could not trust herself to converse longer . A resentment such as her father had never yet excited in her — such , indeed , as she had seldom , if ever , conceived — threatened to force utterance for itself in words which would change the current of her whole life . She saw her father in his worst aspect , and her heart was shaken by an unnatural revolt from him . Let his assurance of what he reported be ever so firm , what right had he to make this use of it ? His behaviour was spiteful . Suppose he entertained suspicions which seemed to make it his duty to warn her against Milvain , this was not the way to go about it . A father actuated by simple motives of affection would never speak and look thus . It was the hateful spirit of literary rancour that ruled him ; the spirit that made people eager to believe all evil , that blinded and maddened . Never had she felt so strongly the unworthiness of the existence to which she was condemned . That contemptible review , and now her father 's ignoble passion — such things were enough to make all literature appear a morbid excrescence upon human life . Forgetful of the time , she sat in her bedroom until a knock at the door , and her mother 's voice , admonished her that dinner was waiting . An impulse all but caused her to say that she would rather not go down for the meal , that she wished to be left alone . But this would be weak peevishness . She just looked at the glass to see that her face bore no unwonted signs , and descended to take her place as usual . Throughout the dinner there passed no word of conversation . Yule was at his blackest ; he gobbled a few mouthfuls , then occupied himself with the evening paper . On rising , he said to Marian : '
74505	74519	74498	74498	you	1878	' The tone would have been uncivil if addressed to an impertinent servant . '
74526	74532	74498	74498	you	1878	' was the cold reply . '

74544	74553	74498	74498	you	1878	'm afraid not . I am going out . '
74554	74562	74564	74564	he	0	' Then I must do it myself . '
74579	74586	74587	74587	she	208	' What is it , dear ? '
74597	74610	74587	74587	she	208	' Oh , do n't quarrel with your father ! Do n't ! '
74611	74629	74659	74660	Mrs. Yule	208	' I ca n't be a slave , mother , and I ca n't be treated unjustly . '
74630	74643	74587	74587	she	208	' What is it ? Let me go and speak to him . '
74644	74657	74587	74587	she	208	' It 's no use . We ca n't live in terror . '
74979	75009	74967	74967	She	427	' Father , I said something that I did not really mean . Of course I shall go on with the copying and finish it as soon as possible . '
75010	75022	75023	75023	He	511	' You will do nothing of the kind , my girl . '
75046	75061	75037	75037	he	511	' Spend your evening as you choose , I have no need of you . '
75062	75075	75037	75037	he	511	' I behaved very ill - temperedly . Forgive me , father . '

75376	75382	75370	75370	she	211	' How has she behaved ? '
75383	75390	75296	75296	she	211	' I suppose you have ears ? '
75391	75407	75296	75296	she	211	' But was n't there something before that ? You spoke so angry to her . '
75408	75423	75370	75370	she	211	' Spoke so angry , did I ? She is out , I suppose ? '
75424	75433	75296	75296	she	211	' No , she has n't gone out . '
75434	75446	75447	75447	She	211	' That 'll do . Do n't disturb me any longer . '
75780	75795	75797	75798	Mrs. Yule	208	' Give my kind regards to them , dear — if you like to , '
75804	75809	75797	75798	Mrs. Yule	208	' Certainly I will . '
75892	75897	75899	75899	Dora	188	' That 's right ! '

76160	76173	76175	76175	Marian	211	'm not sure that I do right in coming again so soon , '

76307	76345	76300	76300	Dora	188	' We thought she was sadly out of spirits . Indeed she told us that she has n't been very well lately . But I think we shall like her if we come to know her better . '

" I suppose you have seen reviews of it ? " she asked at once . Of course I ought to have had the courage to say no , but I admitted that I had seen one or two — Jasper showed us them . She looked very much annoyed , and after that we did n't find much to talk about . '

76864	76901	76902	76903	The girls	420	' Something I can hardly bear to speak of . Perhaps it will be the end of your friendship for me , and I should find it very hard to go back to my old solitude . '

76987	77000	76984	76984	Maud	187	' He has nothing in it this month , except a review . '
77001	77005	77007	77007	Marian	211	' A review ? '
77013	77021	77007	77007	Marian	211	' Yes ; of somebody 's novel . '

77083	77123	77124	77124	Dora	188	' a very ill - natured one ; it 's written by the editor , Mr. Fadge . Father and he have been very unfriendly for a long time . Perhaps Mr. Milvain has told you something about it ? '

77146	77256	77258	77258	she	211	' but I hope there is less envy , hatred and malice than in this of ours . The name of literature is often made hateful to me by the things I hear and read . My father has never been very fortunate , and many things have happened to make him bitter against the men who succeed ; he has often quarrelled with people who were at first his friends , but never so seriously with anyone as with Mr. Fadge . His feeling of enmity goes so far that it includes even those who are in any way associated with Mr. Fadge . I am sorry to say '
77272	77283	77258	77258	she	211	' this has turned him against your brother , and — '

77343	77360	77338	77338	Marian	211	' is because I am so afraid it should make a difference between yourselves and me . '

77373	77379	77380	77380	Marian	211	' I am so ashamed , '
77388	77434	77380	77380	Marian	211	' but I think it will be better if I do n't ask you to come and see me . It sounds ridiculous ; it is ridiculous and shameful . I could n't complain if you refused to have anything more to do with me . '

I say , Dora , we really must get two or three decent easy - chairs for your room . I 've seen some outside a second - hand furniture shop in Hampstead Road , about six shillings apiece . There 's no sitting on chairs such as these . '

I got up at 7.30 , and whilst I breakfasted I read through a volume I had to review . By 10.30 the review was written — three - quarters of a column of the Evening Budget . '

The book was Billington 's " Vagaries " ; pompous idiocy , of course , but he lives in a big house and gives dinners .

80806	81528	80787	80787	You	0	' In the retrospect it seemed the pleasantest she had yet spent with her friends , though she had set out in such a different mood . Her mind was relieved of two anxieties ; she felt sure that the girls had not taken ill what she told them , and there was no longer the least doubt concerning the authorship of that review in The Current . She could confess to herself now that the assurance from Jasper 's lips was not superfluous . He might have weighed profit against other considerations , and have written in that way of her father ; she had not felt that absolute confidence which defies every argument from human frailty . And now she asked herself if faith of that unassailable kind is ever possible ; is it not only the poet 's dream , the far ideal ? Marian often went thus far in her speculation . Her candour was allied with clear insight into the possibilities of falsehood ; she was not readily the victim of illusion ; thinking much , and speaking little , she had not come to her twenty - third year without perceiving what a distance lay between a girl 's dream of life as it might be and life as it is . Had she invariably disclosed her thoughts , she would have earned the repute of a very sceptical and slightly cynical person . But with what rapturous tumult of the heart she could abandon herself to a belief in human virtues when their suggestion seemed to promise her a future of happiness ! Alone in her room she sat down only to think of Jasper Milvain , and extract from the memory of his words , his looks , new sustenance for her hungry heart . Jasper was the first man who had ever evinced a man 's interest in her . Until she met him she had not known a look of compliment or a word addressed to her emotions . He was as far as possible from representing the lover of her imagination , but from the day of that long talk in the fields near Wattleborough the thought of him had supplanted dreams . On that day she said to herself : I could love him if he cared to seek my love . Premature , perhaps ; why yes , but one who is starving is not wo nt to feel reluctance at the suggestion of food . The first man who had approached her with display of feeling and energy and youthful self - confidence ; handsome too , it seemed to her . Her womanhood went eargerly to meet him . Since then she had made careful study of his faults . Each conversation had revealed to her new weakness and follies . With the result that her love had grown to a reality . He was so human , and a youth of all but monastic seclusion had prepared her to love the man who aimed with frank energy at the joys of life . A taint of pedantry would have repelled her . She did not ask for high intellect or great attainments ; but vivacity , courage , determination to succeed were delightful to her senses . Her ideal would not have been a literary man at all ; certainly not a man likely to be prominent in journalism ; rather a man of action , one who had no restraints of commerce or official routine . But in Jasper she saw the qualities that attracted her apart from the accidents of his position . Ideal personages do not descend to girls who have to labour at the British Museum ; it seemed a marvel to her , and of good augury , that even such a man as Jasper should have crossed her path . It was as though years had passed since their first meeting . Upon her return to London had followed such long periods of hopelessness . Yet whenever they encountered each other he had look and speech for her with which surely he did not greet every woman . From the first his way of regarding her had shown frank interest . And at length had come the confession of his '
81531	81635	81636	81636	I	0	' his desire to be something more to her than a mere acquaintance . It was scarcely possible that he should speak as he several times had of late if he did not wish to draw her towards him . That was the hopeful side of her thoughts . It was easy to forget for a time those words of his which one might think were spoken as distinct warning ; but they crept into the memory , unwelcome , importunate , as soon as imagination had built its palace of joy . Why did he always recur to the subject of money ? '
81646	81655	81636	81636	I	0	' he once said that as if meaning , '
81668	81673	81674	81674	friend	1819	' He emphasised the word '
81676	82147	81674	81674	friend	1819	' as if to explain that he offered and asked nothing more than friendship . But it only meant that he would not be in haste to declare himself . Of a certainty there was conflict between his ambition and his love , but she recognised her power over him and exulted in it . She had observed his hesitancy this evening , before he rose to accompany her from the house ; her heart laughed within her as the desire drew him . And henceforth such meetings would be frequent , with each one her influence would increase . How kindly fate had dealt with her in bringing Maud and Dora to London ! It was within his reach to marry a woman who would bring him wealth . He had that in mind ; she understood it too well . But not one moment 's advantage would she relinquish . He must choose her in her poverty , and be content with what his talents could earn for him . Her love gave her the right to demand this sacrifice ; let him ask for her love , and the sacrifice would no longer seem one , so passionately would she reward him . He would ask it . To - night she was full of a rich confidence , partly , no doubt , the result of reaction from her miseries . He had said at parting that her character was so well suited to his ; that he liked her . And then he had pressed her hand so warmly . Before long he would ask her love . The unhoped was all but granted her . She could labour on in the valley of the shadow of books , for a ray of dazzling sunshine might at any moment strike into its musty gloom . The past twelve months had added several years to Edwin Reardon 's seeming age ; at thirty - three he would generally have been taken for forty . His bearing , his personal habits , were no longer those of a young man ; he walked with a stoop and pressed noticeably on the stick he carried ; it was rare for him to show the countenance which tells of present cheerfulness or glad onward - looking ; there was no spring in his step ; his voice had fallen to a lower key , and often he spoke with that hesitation in choice of words which may be noticed in persons whom defeat has made self - distrustful . Ceaseless perplexity and dread gave a wandering , sometimes a wild , expression to his eyes . He seldom slept , in the proper sense of the word ; as a rule , he was conscious all through the night of '
82152	82730	81674	81674	friend	1819	' between physical weariness and wakeful toil of the mind . It often happened that some wholly imaginary obstacle in the story he was writing kept him under a sense of effort throughout the dark hours ; now and again he woke , reasoned with himself , and remembered clearly that the torment was without cause , but the short relief thus afforded soon passed in the recollection of real distress . In his unsoothing slumber he talked aloud , frequently wakening Amy ; generally he seemed to be holding a dialogue with someone who had imposed an intolerable task upon him ; he protested passionately , appealed , argued in the strangest way about the injustice of what was demanded . Once Amy heard him begging for money — positively begging , like some poor wretch in the street ; it was horrible , and made her shed tears ; when he asked what he had been saying , she could not bring herself to tell him . When the striking clocks summoned him remorselessly to rise and work he often reeled with dizziness . It seemed to him that the greatest happiness attainable would be to creep into some dark , warm corner , out of the sight and memory of men , and lie there torpid , with a blessed half - consciousness that death was slowly overcoming him . Of all the sufferings collected into each four - and - twenty hours this of rising to a new day was the worst . The one - volume story which he had calculated would take him four or five weeks was with difficulty finished in two months . March winds made an invalid of him ; at one time he was threatened with bronchitis , and for several days had to abandon even the effort to work . In previous winters he had been wo nt to undergo a good deal of martyrdom from the London climate , but never in such a degree as now ; mental illness seemed to have enfeebled his body . It was strange that he succeeded in doing work of any kind , for he had no hope from the result . This one last effort he would make , just to complete the undeniableness of his failure , and then literature should be thrown behind him ; what other pursuit was possible to him he knew not , but perhaps he might discover some mode of earning a livelihood . Had it been a question of gaining a pound a week , as in the old days , he might have hoped to obtain some clerkship like that at the hospital , where no commercial experience or aptitude was demanded ; but in his present position such an income would be useless . Could he take Amy and the child to live in a garret ? On less than a hundred a year it was scarcely possible to maintain outward decency . Already his own clothing began to declare him poverty - stricken , and but for gifts from her mother Amy would have reached the like pass . They lived in dread of the pettiest casual expense , for the day of pennilessness was again approaching . Amy was oftener from home than had been her custom . Occasionally she went away soon after breakfast , and spent the whole day at her mother 's house . '
82735	82757	81674	81674	friend	1819	' she said with a bitter laugh , when Reardon once expressed surprise that she should be going again so soon . '
82769	83003	83004	83004	Edwin	195	' he returned coldly . The reproach was ignoble , and he could not be surprised that Amy left the house without another word to him . Yet he resented that , as he had resented her sorrowful jest . The feeling of unmanliness in his own position tortured him into a mood of perversity . Through the day he wrote only a few lines , and on Amy 's return he resolved not to speak to her . There was a sense of repose in this change of attitude ; he encouraged himself in the view that Amy was treating him with cruel neglect . She , surprised that her friendly questions elicited no answer , looked into his face and saw a sullen anger of which hitherto Reardon had never seemed capable . Her indignation took fire , and she left him to himself . For a day or two he persevered in his muteness , uttering a word only when it could not be avoided . Amy was at first so resentful that she contemplated leaving him to his ill - temper and dwelling at her mother 's house until he chose to recall her . But his face grew so haggard in fixed misery that compassion at length prevailed over her injured pride . Late in the evening she went to the study , and found him sitting unoccupied . '

83715	84043	83709	83709	you	195	' The impulses which had part in this outbreak were numerous and complex . He felt all that he expressed , but at the same time it seemed to him that he had the choice between two ways of uttering his emotion , the tenderly appealing and the sternly reproachful ; he took the latter course because it was less natural to him than the former . His desire was to impress Amy with the bitter intensity of his sufferings ; pathos and loving words seemed to have lost their power upon her , but perhaps if he yielded to that other form of passion she would be shaken out of her coldness . The stress of injured love is always tempted to speech which seems its contradiction . Reardon had the strangest mixture of pain and pleasure in flinging out these first words of wrath that he had ever addressed to Amy ; they consoled him under the humiliating sense of his weakness , and yet he watched with dread his wife 's countenance as she listened to him . He hoped to cause her pain equal to his own , for then it would be in his power at once to throw off this disguise , and soothe her with every softest word his heart could suggest . That she had really ceased to love him he could not , durst not , believe ; but his nature demanded frequent assurance of affection . Amy had abandoned too soon the caresses of their ardent time ; she was absorbed in her maternity , and thought it enough to be her husband 's friend . Ashamed to make appeal directly for the tenderness she no longer offered , he accused her of utter indifference , of abandoning him and all but betraying him , that in self - defence she might show what really was in her heart . But Amy made no movement towards him . '

The distance between them was greater than he had thought , and now he repented of having given way to an impulse so alien to his true feelings ; anger only estranged her , whereas by speech of a different kind he might have won the caress for which he hungered . Amy , seeing that he would say nothing more , left him to himself . It grew late in the night . The fire had gone out , but Reardon still sat in the cold room . Thoughts of self - destruction were again haunting him , as they had done during the black months of last year . If he had lost Amy 's love , and all through the mental impotence which would make it hard for him even to earn bread , why should he still live ? Affection for his child had no weight with him ; it was Amy 's child rather than his , and he had more fear than pleasure in the prospect of Willie 's growing to manhood . He had just heard the workhouse clock strike two when , without the warning of a footstep , the door opened . Amy came in ; she wore her dressing - gown , and her hair was arranged for the night . '

The world has no pity on a man who ca n't do or produce something it thinks worth money . You may be a divine poet , and if some good fellow does n't take pity on you you will starve by the roadside . Society is as blind and brutal as fate . I have no right to complain of my own ill - fortune ; it 's my own fault ( in a sense ) that I ca n't continue as well as I began ; if I could write books as good as the early ones I should earn money . For all that , it 's hard that I must be kicked aside as worthless just because I do n't know a trade . '

86679	86752	86673	86674	his companion	4573	' Just fancy , if one got up in the morning with the thought that no reasonable desire that occurred to one throughout the day need remain ungratified ! And that it would be the same , any day and every day , to the end of one 's life ! Look at those houses ; every detail , within and without , luxurious . To have such a home as that ! '

86764	86972	86973	86973	Amy	191	' They do live , Amy , at all events . Whatever may be their faculties , they all have free scope . I have often stood staring at houses like these until I could n't believe that the people owning them were mere human beings like myself . The power of money is so hard to realise ; one who has never had it marvels at the completeness with which it transforms every detail of life . Compare what we call our home with that of rich people ; it moves one to scornful laughter . I have no sympathy with the stoical point of view ; between wealth and poverty is just the difference between the whole man and the maimed . If my lower limbs are paralysed I may still be able to think , but then there is such a thing in life as walking . As a poor devil I may live nobly ; but one happens to be made with faculties of enjoyment , and those have to fall into atrophy . To be sure , most rich people do n't understand their happiness ; if they did , they would move and talk like gods — which indeed they are . '
86998	87002	87003	87003	he	2056	' The difference , '
87007	87107	87003	87003	he	2056	' between the man with money and the man without is simply this : the one thinks , " How shall I use my life ? " and the other , " How shall I keep myself alive ? " A physiologist ought to be able to discover some curious distinction between the brain of a person who has never given a thought to the means of subsistence , and that of one who has never known a day free from such cares . There must be some special cerebral development representing the mental anguish kept up by poverty . '
87108	87113	86973	86973	Amy	191	' I should say , '
87118	87145	87003	87003	he	2056	' that it affects every function of the brain . It is n't a special point of suffering , but a misery that colours every thought . '
87146	87256	87003	87003	he	2056	' True . Can I think of a single subject in all the sphere of my experience without the consciousness that I see it through the medium of poverty ? I have no enjoyment which is n't tainted by that thought , and I can suffer no pain which it does n't increase . The curse of poverty is to the modern world just what that of slavery was to the ancient . Rich and destitute stand to each other as free man and bond . You remember the line of Homer I have often quoted about the demoralising effect of enslavement ; poverty degrades in the same way . '
87257	87272	87274	87274	Amy	191	' It has had its effect upon me — I know that too well , '

87685	87833	87678	87678	she	2059	' The work , at all events — rather a different thing , unfortunately . Amy , if only I were back at the time when I wrote " On Neutral Ground , " and yet had you with me ! How full my mind was in those days ! Then I had only to look , and I saw something ; now I strain my eyes , but can make out nothing more than nebulous grotesques . I used to sit down knowing so well what I had to say ; now I strive to invent , and never come at anything . Suppose you pick up a needle with warm , supple fingers ; try to do it when your hand is stiff and numb with cold ; there 's the difference between my manner of work in those days and what it is now . '
87834	87852	87438	87438	he	191	' But you are going to get back your health . You will write better than ever . '
87853	88068	87678	87678	she	2059	' We shall see . Of course there was a great deal of miserable struggle even then , but I remember it as insignificant compared with the hours of contented work . I seldom did anything in the mornings except think and prepare ; towards evening I felt myself getting ready , and at last I sat down with the first lines buzzing in my head . And I used to read a great deal at the same time . Whilst I was writing " On Neutral Ground " I went solidly through the " Divina Commedia , " a canto each day . Very often I wrote till after midnight , but occasionally I got my quantum finished much earlier , and then I used to treat myself to a ramble about the streets . I can recall exactly the places where some of my best ideas came to me . You remember the scene in Prendergast 's lodgings ? That flashed on me late one night as I was turning out of Leicester Square into the slum that leads to Clare Market ; ah , how well I remember ! And I went home to my garret in a state of delightful fever , and scribbled notes furiously before going to bed . '
88069	88082	87678	87678	she	2059	' Do n't trouble ; it 'll all come back to you . '
88083	88202	87438	87438	he	191	' But in those days I had n't to think of money . I could look forward and see provision for my needs . I never asked myself what I should get for the book ; I assure you , that never came into my head — never . The work was done for its own sake . No hurry to finish it ; if I felt that I was n't up to the mark , I just waited till the better mood returned . " On Neutral Ground " took me seven months ; now I have to write three volumes in nine weeks , with the lash stinging on my back if I miss a day . '
88209	88275	88203	88203	He	2060	' I suppose there must be some rich man somewhere who has read one or two of my books with a certain interest . If only I could encounter him and tell him plainly what a cursed state I am in , perhaps he would help me to some means of earning a couple of pounds a week . One has heard of such things . '
88276	88282	87678	87678	she	2059	' In the old days . '
88283	88347	88348	88348	Amy	191	' Yes . I doubt if it ever happens now . Coleridge would n't so easily meet with his Gillman nowadays . Well , I am not a Coleridge , and I do n't ask to be lodged under any man 's roof ; but if I could earn money enough to leave me good long evenings unspoilt by fear of the workhouse — '

88935	88990	88925	88925	He	292	' Milvain stayed only half an hour . The days when he was wo nt to sit and talk at large through a whole evening were no more ; partly because of his diminished leisure , but also for a less simple reason — the growth of something like estrangement between him and Reardon .

88998	89011	88991	88991	You	0	' said Amy , when the visitor had been gone some time . '
89014	89095	88991	88991	You	0	' Reardon was content with the negative , and his wife made no further remark . The result of advertising the flat was that two or three persons called to make inspection . One of them , a man of military appearance , showed himself anxious to come to terms ; he was willing to take the tenement from next quarter - day ( June ) , but wished , if possible , to enter upon possession sooner than that . '
89101	89110	88991	88991	You	0	' said Amy in colloquy with her husband . '
89127	89160	89161	89161	You	2082	' Reardon mused and looked gloomy . He could not bring himself to regard the experiment before him with hopefulness , and his heart sank at the thought of parting from Amy . '
89171	89179	89161	89161	You	2082	' he answered , trying to smile . '
89185	89189	89182	89182	I	0	' she exclaimed ; '

89315	89563	89310	89310	you	0	' The furniture was to be housed at Mrs. Yule 's . Neither of them durst speak of selling it ; that would have sounded too ominous . As for the locality of Reardon 's retreat , Amy herself had suggested Worthing , which she knew from a visit a few years ago ; the advantages were its proximity to London , and the likelihood that very cheap lodgings could be found either in the town or near it . One room would suffice for the hapless author , and his expenses , beyond a trifling rent , would be confined to mere food . Oh yes , he might manage on considerably less than a pound a week . Amy was in much better spirits than for a long time ; she appeared to have convinced herself that there was no doubt of the issue of this perilous scheme ; that her husband would write a notable book , receive a satisfactory price for it , and so re - establish their home . Yet her moods varied greatly . After all , there was delay in the letting of the flat , and this caused her annoyance . It was whilst the negotiations were still pending that she made her call upon Maud and Dora Milvain ; Reardon did not know of her intention to visit them until it had been carried out . She mentioned what she had done in almost a casual manner . '
89571	89580	89564	89564	I	0	' she said , when Reardon exhibited surprise , '
89593	89594	89595	89595	You	0	' '

89698	89764	89655	89655	mother	4349	' She was in a strange , nervous state , and Reardon regarded her uneasily . He talked very little in these days , and passed hours in dark reverie . His book was finished , and he awaited the publisher 's decision . One of Reardon 's minor worries at this time was the fear that by chance he might come upon a review of '
89768	90217	90218	90218	Coward	2093	' Since the publication of his first book he had avoided as far as possible all knowledge of what the critics had to say about him ; his nervous temperament could not bear the agitation of reading these remarks , which , however inept , define an author and his work to so many people incapable of judging for themselves . No man or woman could tell him anything in the way of praise or blame which he did not already know quite well ; commendation was pleasant , but it so often aimed amiss , and censure was for the most part so unintelligent . In the case of this latest novel he dreaded the sight of a review as he would have done a gash from a rusty knife . The judgments could not but be damnatory , and their expression in journalistic phrase would disturb his mind with evil rancour . No one would have insight enough to appreciate the nature and cause of his book 's demerits ; every comment would be wide of the mark ; sneer , ridicule , trite objection , would but madden him with a sense of injustice . His position was illogical — one result of the moral weakness which was allied with his æsthetic sensibility . Putting aside the worthlessness of current reviewing , the critic of an isolated book has of course nothing to do with its author 's state of mind and body any more than with the condition of his purse . Reardon would have granted this , but he could not command his emotions . He was in passionate revolt against the base necessities which compelled him to put forth work in no way representing his healthy powers , his artistic criterion . Not he had written this book , but his accursed poverty . To assail him as the author was , in his feeling , to be guilty of brutal insult . When by ill - hap a notice in one of the daily papers came under his eyes , it made his blood boil with a fierceness of hatred only possible to him in a profoundly morbid condition ; he could not steady his hand for half an hour after . Yet this particular critic only said what was quite true — that the novel contained not a single striking scene and not one living character ; Reardon had expressed himself about it in almost identical terms . But he saw himself in the position of one sickly and all but destitute man against a relentless world , and every blow directed against him appeared dastardly . He could have cried '
90220	90247	90248	90249	Margaret Home	287	' to the writer who wounded him . The would - be sensational story which was now in Mr. Jedwood 's hands had perhaps more merit than '
90250	90489	90248	90249	Margaret Home	287	' ; its brevity , and the fact that nothing more was aimed at than a concatenation of brisk events , made it not unreadable . But Reardon thought of it with humiliation . If it were published as his next work it would afford final proof to such sympathetic readers as he might still retain that he had hopelessly written himself out , and was now endeavouring to adapt himself to an inferior public . In spite of his dire necessities he now and then hoped that Jedwood might refuse the thing . At moments he looked with sanguine eagerness to the three or four months he was about to spend in retirement , but such impulses were the mere outcome of his nervous disease . He had no faith in himself under present conditions ; the permanence of his sufferings would mean the sure destruction of powers he still possessed , though they were not at his command . Yet he believed that his mind was made up as to the advisability of trying this last resource ; he was impatient for the day of departure , and in the interval merely killed time as best he might . He could not read , and did not attempt to gather ideas for his next book ; the delusion that his mind was resting made an excuse to him for the barrenness of day after day . His '
90491	90581	90248	90249	Margaret Home	287	' article had been despatched to The Wayside , and would possibly be accepted . But he did not trouble himself about this or other details ; it was as though his mind could do nothing more than grasp the bald fact of impending destitution ; with the steps towards that final stage he seemed to have little concern . One evening he set forth to make a call upon Harold Biffen , whom he had not seen since the realist called to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of '
90584	90683	90684	90684	They	2094	' left at his lodgings when he was out . Biffen resided in Clipstone Street , a thoroughfare discoverable in the dim district which lies between Portland Place and Tottenham Court Road . On knocking at the door of the lodging - house , Reardon learnt that his friend was at home . He ascended to the third storey and tapped at a door which allowed rays of lamplight to issue from great gaps above and below . A sound of voices came from within , and on entering he perceived that Biffen was engaged with a pupil . '
90694	90698	90684	90684	They	2094	' he said . '
90705	90706	90699	90699	I	0	' '
90713	90723	90699	90699	I	0	' replied Biffen , coming forward to shake hands . '
90738	91044	90732	90733	Mr. Baker	306	' It was a very small room , with a ceiling so low that the tall lodger could only just stand upright with safety ; perhaps three inches intervened between his head and the plaster , which was cracked , grimy , cobwebby . A small scrap of weedy carpet lay in front of the fireplace ; elsewhere the chinky boards were unconcealed . The furniture consisted of a round table , which kept such imperfect balance on its central support that the lamp entrusted to it looked in a dangerous position , of three small cane - bottomed chairs , a small wash - hand - stand with sundry rude appurtenances , and a chair - bedstead which the tenant opened at the hour of repose and spread with certain primitive trappings at present kept in a cupboard . There was no bookcase , but a few hundred battered volumes were arranged some on the floor and some on a rough chest . The weather was too characteristic of an English spring to make an empty grate agreeable to the eye , but Biffen held it an axiom that fires were unseasonable after the first of May. The individual referred to as Mr. Baker , who sat at the table in the attitude of a student , was a robust , hard - featured , black - haired young man of two - or three - and - twenty ; judging from his weather - beaten cheeks and huge hands , as well as from the garb he wore , one would have presumed that study was not his normal occupation . There was something of the riverside about him ; he might be a dockman , or even a bargeman . He looked intelligent , however , and bore himself with much modesty . '
91054	91075	90732	90733	Mr. Baker	306	' said Biffen , who sat down by him and resumed the lesson , Reardon having taken up a volume . '

91128	91138	91139	91139	I	0	' exclaimed the man , smoothing his wiry hair . '
91171	91211	91212	91213	Mr. Baker	306	' Reardon could not refrain from a glance at the speaker , and Biffen , whose manner was very grave and kindly , turned to his friend with an explanation of the difficulties with which the student was struggling . '
91252	91267	91268	91268	I	0	' Baker beamed upon the visitor with a homely , good - natured smile . '
91279	91292	91268	91268	I	0	' he said , striking the table lightly with his clenched fist . '
91306	91312	91305	91305	I	0	'm not afraid of one of 'em

91347	91359	91361	91361	Reardon	191	're not the only man in that case , Mr. Baker , '
91363	91378	91361	91361	Reardon	191	' It 's thought a tough job in general , is it , sir ? '
91379	91384	91394	91395	the man	4402	' It is indeed . '
91385	91392	91394	91395	the man	4402	' Two hundred marks for compersition , '
91397	91416	91394	91395	the man	4402	' Now how many would they have given me for this bit of a try , Mr. Biffen ? '
91417	91445	91394	91395	the man	4402	' Well , well ; I ca n't exactly say . But you improve ; you improve , decidedly . Peg away for another week or two . '
91446	91457	91394	91395	the man	4402	' Oh , do n't fear me , sir ! I 'm
91486	91575	91394	91395	the man	4402	' Again his fist descended upon the table in a way that reminded one of the steam - hammer cracking a nut . The lesson proceeded for about ten minutes , Reardon , under pretence of reading , following it with as much amusement as anything could excite in him nowadays . At length Mr. Baker stood up , collected his papers and books , and seemed about to depart ; but , after certain uneasy movements and glances , he said to Biffen in a subdued voice : '
91590	91629	91577	91577	I	0	' He and the teacher went out , the door closed , and Reardon heard sounds of muffled conversation . In a minute or two a heavy footstep descended the stairs , and Biffen re entered the room . '
91639	91648	91633	91637	a good , honest fellow	2105	' he said , in an amused tone . '

91952	91968	91934	91934	I	0	' Biffen , why do n't you get some decent position ? Surely you might . '
91969	92046	91934	91934	I	0	' What position ? No school would take me ; I have neither credentials nor conventional clothing . For the same reason I could n't get a private tutorship in rich family . No , no ; it 's all right . I keep myself alive , and I get on with my work . — By - the - by , I 've decided to write a book called " Mr. Bailey , Grocer . " '
92047	92053	91934	91934	I	0	' What 's the idea ? '
92054	92194	91934	91934	I	0	' An objectionable word , that . Better say : " What 's the reality ? " Well , Mr. Bailey is a grocer in a little street by here . I have dealt with him for a long time , and as he 's a talkative fellow I 've come to know a good deal about him and his history . He 's fond of talking about the struggle he had in his first year of business . He had no money of his own , but he married a woman who had saved forty - five pounds out of a cat's - meat business . You should see that woman ! A big , coarse , squinting creature ; at the time of the marriage she was a widow and forty - two years old . Now I 'm

He assures me it comes from a large hotel where his wife 's sister is a kitchenmaid , and that it 's perfectly pure ; they very often mix flour with it , you know , and perhaps more obnoxious things that an economical man does n't care to reflect upon . Now , with a little pepper and salt , this bread and dripping is as appetising food as I know . I often make a dinner of it . '
92912	92930	92776	92776	He	0	' I have done the same myself before now . Do you ever buy pease - pudding ? '
92931	92977	92776	92776	He	0	' I should think so ! I get magnificent pennyworths at a shop in Cleveland Street , of a very rich quality indeed . Excellent faggots they have there , too . I 'll give you a supper of them some night before you go . '

93025	93033	93017	93017	he	235	' Need I put my overcoat on ? '
93157	93161	93162	93162	he	235	' Go out , '
93165	93183	93162	93162	he	235	' and then I 'll extinguish the lamp . Mind the second step down , as usual . '
93368	93374	93375	93375	he	207	' Welcome , gents both ! '
93379	93408	93375	93375	he	207	' Ages since I saw you , Reardon . I 've been reading your new book . Uncommonly good things in it here and there — uncommonly good . '
93447	93451	93452	93452	he	207	' Margaret Home , '
93471	93477	93478	93478	he	207	' In the last volume , '
93482	93502	93478	93478	he	207	' I think there are one or two things as good as you ever did ; I do indeed . '
93535	93547	93521	93521	Biffen	235	' Who is this lady of whom you write to me ? '
93548	93556	93562	93562	Reardon	196	' Ah , quite a story ! I 'm
93652	93707	93730	93730	you	2137	' Reardon did not care to smoke , but Biffen lit his pipe and waited with grave interest for the romantic narrative . Whenever he heard of a poor man 's persuading a woman to share his poverty he was eager of details ; perchance he himself might yet have that heavenly good fortune . '
93710	93729	93730	93730	you	2137	' began Whelpdale , crossing his legs and watching a wreath he had just puffed from the cigar , '
93746	94021	94038	94038	his	235	'm going to extend it in ways I 'll explain to you presently . About six weeks ago I received a letter from a lady who referred to my advertisements , and said she had the manuscript of a novel which she would like to offer for my opinion . Two publishers had refused it , but one with complimentary phrases , and she hoped it might n't be impossible to put the thing into acceptable shape . Of course I wrote optimistically , and the manuscript was sent to me . Well , it was n't actually bad — by Jove ! you should have seen some of things I have been asked to recommend to publishers ! It was n't hopelessly bad by any means , and I gave serious thought to it . After exchange of several letters I asked the authoress to come and see me , that we might save postage - stamps and talk things over . She had n't given me her address : I had to direct to a stationer 's in Bayswater . She agreed to come , and did come . I had formed a sort of idea , but of course I was quite wrong . Imagine my excitement when there came in a very beautiful girl , a tremendously interesting girl , about one - and - twenty — just the kind of girl that most strongly appeals to me ; dark , pale , rather consumptive - looking , slender — no , there 's no describing her ; there really is n't ! You must wait till you see her . '
94022	94034	94036	94036	Biffen	235	' I hope the consumption was only a figure of speech , '
94042	94062	94038	94038	his	235	' Oh , there 's nothing serious the matter , I think . A slight cough , poor girl — '
94063	94067	94069	94069	Reardon	196	' The deuce ! '
94071	94385	94069	94069	Reardon	196	' Oh , nothing , nothing ! It 'll be all right . Well , now , of course we talked over thestory — in good earnest , you know . Little by little I induced her to speak of herself — this , after she 'd come two or three times — and she told me lamentable things . She was absolutely alone in London , and had n't had sufficient food for weeks ; had sold all she could of her clothing ; and so on . Her home was in Birmingham ; she had been driven away by the brutality of a stepmother ; a friend lent her a few pounds , and she came to London with an unfinished novel . Well , you know , this kind of thing would be enough to make me soft - hearted to any girl , let alone one who , to begin with , was absolutely my ideal . When she began to express a fear that I was giving too much time to her , that she would n't be able to pay my fees , and so on , I could restrain myself no longer . On the spot I asked her to marry me . I did n't practise any deception , mind . I told her I was a poor devil who had failed as a realistic novelist and was earning bread in haphazard ways ; and I explained frankly that I thought we might carry on various kinds of business together : she might go on with her novel - writing , and — so on . But she was frightened ; I had been too abrupt . That 's a fault of mine , you know ; but I was so confoundedly afraid of losing her . And I told her as much , plainly . '
94389	94395	94396	94396	he	235	' This would be exciting , '
94399	94411	94396	94396	he	235	' if we did n't know the end of the story . '
94412	94587	94595	94595	Reardon	196	' Yes . Pity I did n't keep it a secret . Well , she would n't say yes , but I could see that she did n't absolutely say no . " In any case , " I said , " you 'll let me see you often ? Fees be hanged ! I 'll work day and night for you . I 'll do my utmost to get your novel accepted . " And I implored her to let me lend her a little money . It was very difficult to persuade her , but at last she accepted a few shillings . I could see in her face that she was hungry . Just imagine ! A beautiful girl absolutely hungry ; it drove me frantic ! But that was a great point gained . After that we saw each other almost every day , and at last — she consented ! Did indeed ! I can hardly believe it yet . We shall be married in a fortnight 's time . '
94588	94593	94595	94595	Reardon	196	' I congratulate you , '
94597	94602	94595	94595	Reardon	196	' So do I , '
94606	94750	94595	94595	Reardon	196	' The day before yesterday she went to Birmingham to see her father and tell him all about the affair . I agreed with her it was as well ; the old fellow is n't badly off , and he may forgive her for running away , though he 's under his wife 's thumb , it appears . I had a note yesterday . She had gone to a friend 's house for the first day . I hoped to have heard again this morning — must to - morrow , in any case . I live , as you may imagine , in wild excitement . Of course , if the old man stumps up a wedding - present , all the better . But I do n't care ; we 'll make a living somehow . What do you think I 'm
94792	95011	95012	95012	Biffen	235	'm going to advertise : " Novel - writing taught in ten lessons ! " What do you think of that ? No swindle ; not a bit of it . I am quite capable of giving the ordinary man or woman ten very useful lessons . I 've been working out the scheme ; it would amuse you vastly , Reardon . The first leson deals with the question of subjects , local colour — that kind of thing . I gravely advise people , if they possibly can , to write of the wealthy middle class ; that 's the popular subject , you know . Lords and ladies are all very well , but the real thing to take is a story about people who have no titles , but live in good Philistine style . I urge study of horsey matters especially ; that 's very important . You must be well up , too , in military grades , know about Sandhurst , and so on . Boating is an important topic . You see ? Oh , I shall make a great thing of this . I shall teach my wife carefully , and then let her advertise lessons to girls ; they 'll prefer coming to a woman , you know . '
95019	95029	95031	95031	Reardon	196	' How much shall you charge for the course ? '
95033	95059	95031	95031	Reardon	196	' That 'll depend . I sha n't refuse a guinea or two ; but some people may be made to pay five , perhaps . '
95071	95080	95081	95081	He	235	' A letter for you , Mr. Whelpdale . '
95095	95115	95116	95116	He	235	' Yes , it 's from Birmingham ; posted this morning . Look what an exquisite hand she writes ! '
95172	95180	95181	95181	Biffen	235	' No bad news , I hope ? '
95194	95203	95204	95204	he	207	' Now if this is n't too bad ! '
95211	95230	95204	95204	he	207	' If this is n't monstrously unkind ! I never heard anything so gross as this — never ! '
95240	95292	95204	95204	he	207	' She writes — that she has met an old lover — in Birmingham — that it was with him she had quarrelled — not with her father at all — that she ran away to annoy him and frighten him — that she has made it up again , and they 're
95298	95345	95204	95204	he	207	' He let the sheet fall , and looked so utterly woebegone that his friends at once exerted themselves to offer such consolation as the case admitted of . Reardon thought better of Whelpdale for this emotion ; he had not believed him capable of it . '
95355	95362	95204	95204	he	207	' cried the forsaken one presently . '
95509	95534	95502	95502	I	0	' The visitors had risen . They felt uncomfortable , for it seemed as if Whelpdale might find vent for his distress in tears . '

95998	96028	95996	95996	Reardon	191	' I believe he is quite right . The thing is too empty to please the better kind of readers , yet not vulgar enough to please the worse . '
96029	96037	96076	96076	Reardon	191	' But you 'll try someone else ? '
96038	96048	96049	96049	They	2164	' I do n't think it 's much use . '
96071	96074	96076	96076	Reardon	191	' So , '
96080	96094	96076	96076	Reardon	191	' I do n't see how our plan is to be carried out . '
96095	96102	96049	96049	They	2164	' Oh , it must be ! '
96103	96107	96076	96076	Reardon	191	' But how ? '
96108	96133	96134	96134	His	191	' You 'll get seven or eight pounds from The Wayside . And — had n't we better sell the furniture , instead of — '

96222	96252	96220	96220	Reardon	191	' that means you 'll never come back to me . You wish to save yourself and the child from the hard life that seems to be before us . '
96253	96293	96294	96294	She	2166	' Yes , I do ; but not by deserting you . I want you to go and work for us all , so that we may live more happily before long . Oh , how wretched this is ! '

96574	96754	96553	96553	I	0	' He again rose , and that night they talked no more of their difficulties , though on the morrow ( Sunday ) it would be necessary to decide their course in every detail . Amy did not go to church . Before her marriage she had done so as a mere matter of course , accompanying her mother , but Reardon 's attitude with regard to the popular religion speedily became her own ; she let the subject lapse from her mind , and cared neither to defend nor to attack where dogma was concerned . She had no sympathies with mysticism ; her nature was strongly practical , with something of zeal for intellectual attainment superadded . This Sunday morning she was very busy with domestic minutiæ . Reardon noticed what looked like preparations for packing , and being as little disposed for conversation as his wife , he went out and walked for a couple of hours in the Hampstead region . Dinner over , Amy at once made ready for her journey to Westbourne Park . '
96761	96768	96756	96756	you	2170	' she said to her husband . '
96793	96823	96824	96824	You	2170	' It was half a year since he had met Mrs. Yule . she never came to their dwelling , and Reardon could not bring himself to visit her . '

97019	97023	96972	96972	you	0	' replied Amy . '
97063	97064	97053	97053	she	4349	' '
97069	97073	97076	97076	you	0	' muttered Reardon . '
97080	98247	98248	98248	I	0	' Amy was in her most practical mood , and would not linger for purposeless talk . A few minutes , and Reardon was left alone . He stood before his bookshelves and began to pick out the volumes which he would take away with him . Just a few , the indispensable companions of a bookish man who still clings to life — his Homer , his Shakespeare — The rest must be sold . He would get rid of them to - morrow morning . All together they might bring him a couple of sovereigns . Then his clothing . Amy had fulfilled all the domestic duties of a wife ; his wardrobe was in as good a state as circumstances allowed . But there was no object in burdening himself with winter garments , for , if he lived through the summer at all , he would be able to repurchase such few poor things as were needful ; at present he could only think of how to get together a few coins . So he made a heap of such things as might be sold . The furniture ? If it must go , the price could scarcely be more than ten or twelve pounds ; well , perhaps fifteen . To be sure , in this way his summer 's living would be abundantly provided for . He thought of Biffen enviously . Biffen , if need be , could support life on three or four shillings a week , happy in the thought that no mortal had a claim upon him . If he starved to death — well , many another lonely man has come to that end . If he preferred to kill himself , who would be distressed ? Spoilt child of fortune ! The bells of ST . Marylebone began to clang for afternoon service . In the idleness of dull pain his thoughts followed their summons , and he marvelled that there were people who could imagine it a duty or find it a solace to go and sit in that twilight church and listen to the droning of prayers . He thought of the wretched millions of mankind to whom life is so barren that they must needs believe in a recompense beyond the grave . For that he neither looked nor longed . The bitterness of his lot was that this world might be a sufficing paradise to him if only he could clutch a poor little share of current coin . He had won the world 's greatest prize — a woman 's love — but could not retain it because his pockets were empty . That he should fail to make a great name , this was grievous disappointment to Amy , but this alone would not have estranged her . It was the dread and shame of penury that made her heart cold to him . And he could not in his conscience scorn her for being thus affected by the vulgar circumstances of life ; only a few supreme natures stand unshaken under such a trial , and though his love of Amy was still passionate , he knew that her place was among a certain class of women , and not on the isolated pinnacle where he had at first visioned her . It was entirely natural that she shrank at the test of squalid suffering . A little money , and he could have rested secure in her love , for then he would have been able to keep ever before her the best qualities of his heart and brain . Upon him , too , penury had its debasing effect ; as he now presented himself he was not a man to be admired or loved . It was all simple and intelligible enough — a situation that would be misread only by shallow idealism . Worst of all , she was attracted by Jasper Milvain 's energy and promise of success . He had no ignoble suspicions of Amy , but it was impossible for him not to see that she habitually contrasted the young journalist , who laughingly made his way among men , with her grave , dispirited husband , who was not even capable of holding such position as he had gained . She enjoyed Milvain 's conversation , it put her into a good humour ; she liked him personally , and there could be no doubt that she had observed a jealous tendency in Reardon 's attitude to his former friend — always a harmful suggestion to a woman . Formerly she had appreciated her husband 's superiority ; she had smiled at Milvain 's commoner stamp of mind and character . But tedious repetition of failure had outwearied her , and now she saw Milvain in the sunshine of progress , dwelt upon the worldly advantages of gifts and a temperament such as his . Again , simple and intelligible enough . Living apart from her husband , she could not be expected to forswear society , and doubtless she would see Milvain pretty often . He called occasionally at Mrs. Yule 's , and would not do so less often when he knew that Amy was to be met there . There would be chance encounters like that of yesterday , of which she had chosen to keep silence . A dark fear began to shadow him . In yielding thus passively to stress of circumstances , was he not exposing his wife to a danger which outweighed all the ills of poverty ? As one to whom she was inestimably dear , was he right in allowing her to leave him , if only for a few months ? He knew very well that a man of strong character would never have entertained this project . He had got into the way of thinking of himself as too weak to struggle against the obstacles on which Amy insisted , and of looking for safety in retreat ; but what was to be the end of this weakness if the summer did not at all advance him ? He knew better than Amy could how unlikely it was that he should recover the energies of his mind in so short a time and under such circumstances ; only the feeble man 's temptation to postpone effort had made him consent to this step , and now that he was all but beyond turning back , the perils of which he had thought too little forced themselves upon his mind . He rose in anguish , and stood looking about him as if aid might somewhere be visible . Presently there was a knock at the front door , and on opening he beheld the vivacious Mr. Carter . This gentleman had only made two or three calls here since Reardon 's marriage ; his appearance was a surprise . '
98258	98262	98263	98263	Edith	276	' he exclaimed . '
98277	98309	98271	98271	I	0	' He was in spring costume , and exhaled fresh odours . The contrast between his prosperous animation and Reardon 's broken - spirited quietness could not have been more striking . '

99782	99783	99810	99810	you	191	' '

99862	99875	99876	99876	Amy	191	' Reardon approached her , and laid a hand on her shoulder . '

99905	100074	99888	99888	I	0	' He had foreseen a struggle , but without certainty of the form Amy 's opposition would take . For himself , he meant to be gently resolute , calmly regardless of protest . But in a man to whom such self - assertion is a matter of conscious effort , tremor of the nerves will always interfere with the line of conduct he has conceived in advance . Already Reardon had spoken with far more bluntness than he proposed ; involuntarily , his voice slipped from earnest determination to the note of absolutism , and , as is wo nt to be the case , the sound of these strange tones instigated him to further utterances of the same kind . He lost control of himself ; Amy 's last reply went through him like an electric shock , and for the moment he was a mere husband defied by his wife , the male stung to exertion of his brute force against the physically weaker sex . '
100111	100179	100182	100182	you	0	' He met Amy 's full look , and was conscious of that in it which corresponded to his own brutality . She had become suddenly a much older woman ; her cheeks were tight drawn into thinness , her lips were bloodlessly hard , there was an unknown furrow along her forehead , and she glared like the animal that defends itself with tooth and claw . '
100188	100345	100348	100348	he	2217	' Could Amy 's voice sound like that ? Great Heaven ! With just such accent he had heard a wrangling woman retort upon her husband at the street corner . Is there then no essential difference between a woman of this world and one of that ? Does the same nature lie beneath such unlike surfaces ? He had but to do one thing : to seize her by the arm , drag her up from the chair , dash her back again with all his force — there , the transformation would be complete , they would stand towards each other on the natural footing . With an added curse perhaps — Instead of that , he choked , struggled for breath , and shed tears . Amy turned scornfully away from him . Blows and a curse would have overawed her , at all events for the moment ; she would have felt : '
100363	100440	100441	100441	You	0	' His tears moved her to a feeling cruelly exultant ; they were the sign of her superiority . It was she who should have wept , and never in her life had she been further from such display of weakness . This could not be the end , however , and she had no wish to terminate the scene . They stood for a minute without regarding each other , then Reardon faced to her . '

When I consented to leave you for a time , to go away and try to work in solitude , I was foolish and even insincer , both to you and to myself . I knew that I was undertaking the impossible . It was just putting off the evil day , that was all — putting off the time when I should have to say plainly : " I ca n't live by literature , so I must look out for some other employment . " I should n't have been so weak but that I knew how you would regard such a decision as that . I was afraid to tell the truth — afraid . Now , when Carter of a sudden put this opportunity before me , I saw all the absurdity of the arrangements we had made . It did n't take me a moment to make up my mind . Anything was to be chosen rather than a parting from you on false pretences , a ridiculous affectation of hope where there was no hope . '
101153	101456	101139	101139	He	2234	' And a grievous share of the fault lies with you , Amy . You remember very well when I first saw how dark the future was . I was driven even to say that we ought to change our mode of living ; I asked you if you would be willing to leave this place and go into cheaper rooms . And you know what your answer was . Not a sign in you that you would stand by me if the worst came . I knew then what I had to look forward to , but I durst not believe it . I kept saying to myself : She loves me , and as soon as she really understands — That was all self - deception . If I had been a wise man , I should have spoken to you in a way you could n't mistake . I should have told you that we were living recklessly , and that I had determined to alter it . I have no delicacy ? No regard for your feelings ? Oh , if I had had less ! I doubt whether you can even understand some of the considerations that weighed with me , and made me cowardly — though I once thought there was no refinement of sensibility that you could n't enter into . Yes , I was absurd enough to say to myself : It will look as if I had consciously deceived her ; she may suffer from the thought that I won her at all hazards , knowing that I should soon expose her to poverty and all sorts of humiliation . Impossible to speak of that again ; I had to struggle desperately on , trying to hope . Oh ! if you knew — '
101465	101696	101457	101457	His	2236	' I do n't understand how you could be so thoughtless and heartless . You knew that I was almost mad with anxiety at times . Surely , any woman must have had the impulse to give what help was in her power . How could you hesitate ? Had you no suspicion of what a relief and encouragement it would be to me , if you said : Yes , we must go and live in a simpler way ? If only as a proof that you loved me , how I should have welcomed that ! You helped me in nothing . You threw all the responsibility upon me — always bearing in mind , I suppose , that there was a refuge for you . Even now , I despise myself for saying such things of you , though I know so bitterly that they are true . It takes a long time to see you as such a different woman from the one I worshipped . In passion , I can fling out violent words , but they do n't yet answer to my actual feeling . It will be long enough yet before I think contemptuously of you . You know that when a light is suddenly extinguished , the image of it still shows before your eyes . But at last comes the darkness . '

102014	102074	101923	101923	her	2238	' I am determined to be your friend , and to save you from yourself . Go at once ! Leave all the rest to me . If I have let things take their course till now , it sha n't be so in future . The responsibility shall be with me . Only do as I tell you . '
102075	102082	101923	101923	her	2238	' You know it 's impossible — '
102083	102227	101923	101923	her	2238	' It is not ! I will find money . No one shall be allowed to say that we are parting ; no one has any such idea yet . You are going away for your health , just three summer months . I have been far more careful of appearances than you imagine , but you give me credit for so little . I will find the money you need , until you have written another book . I promise ; I undertake it . Then I will find another home for us , of the proper kind . You shall have no trouble . You shall give yourself entirely to intellectual things . But Mr. Carter must be told at once , before he can spread a report . If he has spoken , he must contradict what he has said . '
102228	102256	101923	101923	her	2238	' But you amaze me , Amy . Do you mean to say that you look upon it as a veritable disgrace , my taking this clerkship ? '
102257	102281	101923	101923	her	2238	' I do . I ca n't help my nature . I am ashamed through and through that you should sink to this . '

102294	102366	101923	101923	her	2238	' Very few people know it . And then that is n't the same thing . It does n't matter what one has been in the past . Especially a literary man ; everyone expects to hear that he was once poor . But to fall from the position you now have , and to take weekly wages — you surely ca n't know how people of my world regard that . '
102367	102391	101923	101923	her	2238	' Of your world ? I had thought your world was the same as mine , and knew nothing whatever of these imbecilities . '

102492	102590	102485	102485	he	2239	' If my opinions are so valueless to you that you dismiss them like those of a troublesome child , I wonder you think it worth while to try and keep up appearances about me . It is very simple : make known to everyone that you are in no way connected with the disgrace I have brought upon myself . Put an advertisement in the newspapers to that effect , if you like — as men do about their wives debts . I have chosen my part . I ca n't stultify myself to please you . '
102609	102621	102622	102622	Amy	191	' Then go your way , and I will go mine ! '
102728	102736	102737	102737	she	2241	' How long shall you be away ? '
102742	102755	102737	102737	she	2241	' It is doubtful . I am going to look for rooms . '
102756	102785	102710	102710	she	2241	' Then no doubt I shall be gone when you come back . There 's no object , now , in my staying here till to - morrow . '

102792	102801	102737	102737	she	2241	' Do you wish Lizzie still to come ? '
102802	102819	102710	102710	she	2241	' No . Please to pay her wages and dismiss her . Here is some money . '
102820	102832	102833	102833	He	833	' I think you had better let me see to that . '

On the last occasion when he came to her house she received him with such extreme civility that Reardon thenceforth disliked her , whereas before he had only thought her a good - natured and silly woman . Alas for Amy 's marriage with a man of distinction ! From step to step of descent , till here was downright catastrophe . Bitter enough in itself , but most lamentable with reference to the friends of the family . How was it to be explained , this return of Amy to her home for several months , whilst her husband was no further away than Worthing ? The bald , horrible truth — impossible ! Yet Mr. Milvain knew it , and the Carters must guess it . What colour could be thrown upon such vulgar distress ? The worst was not yet . It declared itself this May morning , when , quite unexpectedly , a cab drove up to the house , bringing Amy and her child , and her trunks , and her band - boxes , and her what - nots . From the dining - room window Mrs. Yule was aware of this arrival , and in a few moments she learnt the unspeakable cause . She burst into tears , genuine as ever woman shed . '

There was something ridiculous , as well as repugnant , in such a thought ; but it kept possession of Amy 's mind . She was brooding upon it when her mother came into the drawing - room . '

105870	105963	105964	105964	People	4392	' Like her multitudinous kind , Mrs. Yule lived only in the opinions of other people . What others would say was her ceaseless preoccupation . She had never conceived of life as something proper to the individual ; independence in the directing of one 's course seemed to her only possible in the case of very eccentric persons , or of such as were altogether out of society . Amy had advanced , intellectually , far beyond this standpoint , but lack of courage disabled her from acting upon her convictions . '
105973	106037	106042	106042	she	2348	' she answered dispiritedly . Now , confession of the truth was the last thing that would occur to Mrs. Yule when social relations were concerned . Her whole existence was based on bold denial of actualities . And , as is natural in such persons , she had the ostrich instinct strongly developed ; though very acute in the discovery of her friends '
106055	106064	106065	106065	she	2348	' But the fact is , my dear , '
106068	106183	106065	106065	she	2348	' we do n't know the truth ourselves . You had better let yourself be directed by me . It will be better , at first , if you see as few people as possible . I suppose you must say something or other to two or three of your own friends ; if you take my advice you 'll be rather mysterious . Let them think what they like ; anything is better than to say plainly : " My husband ca n't support me , and he has gone to work as a clerk for weekly wages . " Be mysterious , darling ; depend upon it , that 's the safest . '

106469	106505	106466	106466	she	208	' You do n't wish , I suppose , that Amy should go and live in a back street at Islington , and be hungry every other day , and soon have no decent clothes ? '

106537	106621	106535	106535	John	194	' I want to know what is to be the end of it all ? I 've no doubt it 's uncommonly pleasant for Reardon to shift his responsibilities on to our shoulders . At this rate I think I shall get married , and live beyond my means until I can hold out no longer , and then hand my wife over to her relatives , with my compliments . It 's about the coolest business that ever came under my notice . '
106622	106630	106632	106633	Mrs. Yule	208	' But what is to be done ? '

Somebody or other must pitch him into the kind of place that suits men who can do nothing in particular . Carter ought to be able to help , I should think . '
106714	106720	106722	106722	Amy	191	' You know very well , '

106798	106877	106466	106466	she	208	' That 's all bosh , Amy . If a fellow has once got into the swing of it he can keep it up if he likes . He might write his two novels a year easily enough , just like twenty other men and women . Look here , I could do it myself if I were n't too lazy . And that 's what 's the matter with Reardon . He does n't care to work . '
106878	106885	106887	106888	Mrs. Yule	208	' I have thought that myself , '
106890	106928	106466	106466	she	208	' It really is too ridiculous to say that he could n't write some kind of novels if he chose . Look at Miss Blunt 's last book ; why , anybody could have written that . I 'm

Nor would it be true to represent Edwin Reardon as rising to the new day wholly disconsolate . He too had slept unusually well , and with returning consciousness the sense of a burden removed was more instant than that of his loss and all the dreary circumstances attaching to it . He had no longer to fear the effects upon Amy of such a grievous change as from their homelike flat to the couple of rooms he had taken in Islington ; for the moment , this relief helped him to bear the pain of all that had happened and the uneasiness which troubled him when he reflected that his wife was henceforth a charge to her mother . Of course for the moment only . He had no sooner begun to move about , to prepare his breakfast ( amid the relics of last evening 's meal ) , to think of all the detestable work he had to do before to - morrow night , than his heart sank again . His position was well nigh as dolorous as that of any man who awoke that morning to the brutal realities of life . If only for the shame of it ! How must they be speaking of him , Amy 's relatives , and her friends ? A novelist who could n't write novels ; a husband who could n't support his wife and child ; a literate who made eager application for illiterate work at paltry wages — how interesting it would all sound in humorous gossip ! And what hope had he that things would ever be better with him ? Had he done well ? Had he done wisely ? Would it not have been better to have made that one last effort ? There came before him a vision of quiet nooks beneath the Sussex cliffs , of the long lines of green breakers bursting into foam ; he heard the wave - music , and tasted the briny freshness of the sea - breeze . Inspiration , after all , would perchance have come to him . If Amy 's love had but been of more enduring quality ; if she had strengthened him for this last endeavour with the brave tenderness of an ideal wife ! But he had seen such hateful things in her eyes . Her love was dead , and she regarded him as the man who had spoilt her hopes of happiness . It was only for her own sake that she urged him to strive on ; let his be the toil , that hers might be the advantage if he succeeded . '
109312	109611	109307	109307	She	2417	' He had the conviction of it . Oh yes , she would shed tears ; they come so easily to women . But to have him dead and out of her way ; to be saved from her anomalous position ; to see once more a chance in life ; she would welcome it . But there was no time for brooding . To - day he had to sell all the things that were superfluous , and to make arrangements for the removal of his effects to - morrow . By Wednesday night , in accordance with his agreement , the flat must be free for the new occupier . He had taken only two rooms , and fortunately as things were . Three would have cost more than he was likely to be able to afford for a long time . The rent of the two was to be six- and - sixpence ; and how , if Amy had consented to come , could he have met the expenses of their living out of his weekly twenty - five shillings ? How could he have pretended to do literary work in such cramped quarters , he who had never been able to write a line save in strict seclusion ? In his despair he had faced the impossible . Amy had shown more wisdom , though in a spirit of unkindness . Towards ten o'clock he was leaving the flat to go and find people who would purchase his books and old clothing and other superfluities ; but before he could close the door behind him , an approaching step on the stairs caught his attention . He saw the shining silk hat of a well - equipped gentleman . It was John Yule . '

111626	111635	111523	111524	The dealer	2457	' That 's the most you can give ? '
111636	111650	111651	111651	He	191	' Would n't pay me to give a sixpence more . You see — '
111664	111673	111659	111659	Reardon	191	' Can you take them away at once ? '
111674	111683	111523	111524	The dealer	2457	' At wunst ? Would two o'clock do ? '
111684	111690	111523	111524	The dealer	2457	' Yes , it would . '
111691	111702	111659	111659	Reardon	191	' And might you want these other things takin anywheres ? '
111703	111727	111523	111524	The dealer	2457	' Yes , but not till to - morrow . They have to go to Islington . What would you do it for ? '
111918	112028	112029	112029	He	2476	' Enclosed in this envelope you will find twenty pounds . I have been reminded that your relatives will be at the expense of your support ; it seemed best to me to sell the furniture , and now I send you all the money I can spare at present . You will receive to - morrow a box containing several things I did not feel justified in selling . As soon as I begin to have my payment from Carter , half of it shall be sent to you every week . My address is : 5 Manville Street , Upper Street , Islington . — Edwin Reardon . '
112128	112407	112124	112124	he	2476	' bell . When the door opened , he handed his letter to the girl , and requested that it might be given to Mrs. Reardon as soon as possible . With one more hasty glance at the window — Amy was perhaps enjoying her unwonted comfort — he walked quickly away . As he re - entered what had been his home , its bareness made his heart sink . An hour or two had sufficed for this devastation ; nothing remained upon the uncarpeted floors but the needments he would carry with him into the wilderness , such few evidences of civilisation as the poorest can not well dispense with . Anger , revolt , a sense of outraged love — all manner of confused passions had sustained him throughout this day of toil ; now he had leisure to know how faint he was . He threw himself upon his chair - bedstead , and lay for more than an hour in torpor of body and mind . But before he could sleep he must eat . Though it was cold , he could not exert himself to light a fire ; there was some food still in the cupboard , and he consumed it in the fashion of a tired labourer , with the plate on his lap , using his fingers and a knife . What had he to do with delicacies ? He felt utterly alone in the world . Unless it were Biffen , what mortal would give him kindly welcome under any roof ? These stripped rooms were symbolical of his life ; losing money , he had lost everything . '
112485	112502	112479	112479	your	2484	' In this room he had sat with Amy on their return from the wedding holiday . '
112513	112515	112504	112504	you	2484	' — '
112522	112524	112504	112504	you	2484	' — '
112535	112537	112532	112532	I	0	' — '
112545	113045	112532	112532	I	0	' The voices seemed to be lingering still , in a sad , faint echo , so short a time it was since those words were uttered . His own fault . A man has no business to fail ; least of all can he expect others to have time to look back upon him or pity him if he sink under the stress of conflict . Those behind will trample over his body ; they ca n't help it ; they themselves are borne onwards by resistless pressure . He slept for a few hours , then lay watching the light of dawn as it revealed his desolation . The morning 's post brought him a large heavy envelope , the aspect of which for a moment puzzled him . But he recognised the handwriting , and understood . The editor of The Wayside , in a pleasantly - written note , begged to return the paper on Pliny 's Letters which had recently been submitted to him ; he was sorry it did not strike him as quite so interesting as the other contributions from Reardon 's pen . This was a trifle . For the first time he received a rejected piece of writing without distress ; he even laughed at the artistic completeness of the situation . The money would have been welcome , but on that very account he might have known it would not come . The cart that was to transfer his property to the room in Islington arrived about mid - day . By that time he had dismissed the last details of business in relation to the flat , and was free to go back to the obscure world whence he had risen . He felt that for two years and a half he had been a pretender . It was not natural to him to live in the manner of people who enjoy an assured income ; he belonged to the class of casual wage - earners . Back to obscurity ! Carrying a bag which contained a few things best kept in his own care he went by train to King 's Cross , and thence walked up Pentonville Hill to Upper Street and his own little by - way . Manville Street was not unreasonably squalid ; the house in which he had found a home was not alarming in its appearance , and the woman who kept it had an honest face . Amy would have shrunk in apprehension , but to one who had experience of London garrets this was a rather favourable specimen of its kind . The door closed more satisfactorily than poor Biffen 's , for instance , and there were not many of those knot - holes in the floor which give admission to piercing little draughts ; not a pane of the window was cracked , not one . A man might live here comfortably — could memory be destroyed . '
113054	113063	113064	113064	You	2488	' said the landlady as she admitted him . '
113072	113100	113064	113064	You	2488	' He ascended hastily . The letter must be from Amy , as no one else knew his address . Yes , and its contents were these : '
113210	113281	113207	113208	Amy Reardon	191	' Doubtless Amy thought it was her duty to write in this way . Not a word of sympathy ; he must understand that no one was to blame but himself , and that her hardships were equal to his own . In the bag he had brought with him there were writing materials . Standing at the mantel - piece , he forthwith penned a reply to this letter : '
113408	113708	113709	113709	You	2493	' He went out and posted this at once . By three o'clock the furniture of his room was arranged . He had not kept a carpet ; that was luxury , and beyond his due . His score of volumes must rank upon the mantelpiece ; his clothing must be kept in the trunk . Cups , plates , knives , forks , and spoons would lie in the little open cupboard , the lowest section of which was for his supply of coals . When everything was in order he drew water from a tap on the landing and washed himself ; then , with his bag , went out to make purchases . A loaf of bread , butter , sugar , condensed milk ; a remnant of tea he had brought with him . On returning , he lit as small a fire as possible , put on his kettle , and sat down to meditate . How familiar it all was to him ! And not unpleasant , for it brought back the days when he had worked to such good purpose . It was like a restoration of youth . Of Amy he would not think . Knowing his bitter misery , she could write to him in cold , hard words , without a touch even of womanly feeling . If ever they were to meet again , the advance must be from her side . He had no more tenderness for her until she strove to revive it . Next morning he called at the hospital to see Carter . The secretary 's peculiar look and smile seemed to betray a knowledge of what had been going on since Sunday , and his first words confirmed this impression of Reardon 's . '

113729	113757	113758	113758	You	2493	' Reardon 's tone was meant to signify that further remark on the subject would be unwelcome . Musingly , Carter made a note of the address . '

Without a word of warning , her husband announced that he had taken a clerkship and was going to remove immediately to the East - end . Fancy ! And this when he had already arranged , as you know , to go to the south coast and write his next book under the influences of the sea air . He was anything but well ; we all knew that , and we had all joined in advising him to spend the summer at the seaside . It seemed better that he should go alone ; Mrs. Reardon would , of course , have gone down for a few days now and then . And at a moment 's notice everything is changed , and in such a dreadful way ! I can not believe that this is the behaviour of a sane man ! '

116697	116783	116686	116686	he	195	' Your way of talking has always been to glorify success , to insist upon it as the one end a man ought to keep in view . If you had talked so to me alone , it would n't have mattered . But there was generally someone else present . Your words had their effect ; I can see that now . It 's very much owing to you that I am deserted , now that there 's no hope of my ever succeeding . '
116840	116850	116851	116851	Jasper	186	' That 's a most astonishing thing to say , '

You did n't like it then , and certainly it wo n't be pleasant to you to remember it now . If you mean that your wife has grown unkind to you because you are unfortunate , there 's no need to examine into other people 's influence for an explanation of that . '
117061	117081	117055	117055	his	195	' Then you have always regarded my wife as a woman likely to fail me in time of need ? '
117082	117121	116851	116851	Jasper	186	' I do n't care to answer a question put in that way . If we are no longer to talk with the old friendliness , it 's far better we should n't discuss things such as this . '
117122	117156	117157	117157	He	195	' Well , practically you have answered . Of course I remember those words of yours that you refer to . Whether you were right or wrong does n't affect what I say . '

Jasper , whose misrepresentation was wilful , though not maliciously so , also fell into silence ; he did not believe that his conversations with Amy had seriously affected the course of events , but he knew that he had often said things to her in private which would scarcely have fallen from his lips if her husband had been present — little depreciatory phrases , wrong rather in tone than in terms , which came of his irresistible desire to assume superiority whenever it was possible . He , too , was weak , but with quite another kind of weakness than Reardon 's . His was the weakness of vanity , which sometimes leads a man to commit treacheries of which he would believe himself incapable . Self - accused , he took refuge in the pretence of misconception , which again was a betrayal of littleness . They drew near to Westbourne Park station . '
117582	117588	117573	117573	You	2576	' Jasper said , coldly . '

A day or two later , Milvain wrote to Mrs. Yule , and told her that he had seen Reardon ; he did not describe the circumstances under which the interview had taken place , but gave it as his opinion that Reardon was in a state of nervous illness , and made by suffering quite unlike himself . That he might be on the way to positive mental disease seemed likely enough . '

Alfred Yule , with his wife and daughter , rusticated somewhere in Kent . Dora and Marian exchanged letters , and here is a passage from one written by the former : '
118285	118590	118591	118591	I	0	' Dora , no doubt , had her reasons for writing in this strain . She would not have made such remarks in conversation with her friend , but took the opportunity of being at a distance to communicate them in writing . On their return , the two girls made good progress with the book they were manufacturing for Messrs. Jolly and Monk , and early in October it was finished . Dora was now writing little things for The English Girl , and Maud had begun to review an occasional novel for an illustrated paper . In spite of their poor lodgings , they had been brought into social relations with Mrs. Boston Wright and a few of her friends ; their position was understood , and in accepting invitations they had no fear lest unwelcome people should pounce down upon them in their shabby little sitting - room . The younger sister cared little for society such as Jasper procured them ; with Marian Yule for a companion she would have been quite content to spend her evenings at home . But Maud relished the introduction to strangers . She was admired , and knew it . Prudence could not restrain her from buying a handsomer dress than those she had brought from her country home , and it irked her sorely that she might not reconstruct all her equipment to rival the appearance of well - to - do girls whom she studied and envied . Her disadvantages , for the present , were insuperable . She had no one to chaperon her ; she could not form intimacies because of her poverty . A rare invitation to luncheon , a permission to call at the sacred hour of small - talk — this was all she could hope for . '

119022	119047	119048	119048	Dora	188	' Pretty well . She has wanted to go to the Gaiety for a long time . There 's no harm , is there ? '
119070	119113	119048	119048	Dora	188	' Harm , no . Idiocy and lively music , that 's all . It 's too late , or I 'd have taken you , for the joke of the thing . Confound it ! she ought to have better dresses . '

119127	119162	119163	119163	They	2604	' Pooh ! But I do n't care for her to be runing about with the Lanes . Lane is too big a blackguard ; it reflects upon his wife to a certain extent . '

120870	121126	120771	120771	I	0	' was the thought upon which he at length slept . Since the domestic incidents connected with that unpleasant review in The Current , the relations between Alfred Yule and his daughter had suffered a permanent change , though not in a degree noticeable by any one but the two concerned . To all appearances , they worked together and conversed very much as they had been wo nt to do ; but Marian was made to feel in many subtle ways that her father no longer had complete confidence in her , no longer took the same pleasure as formerly in the skill and conscientiousness of her work , and Yule on his side perceived too clearly that the girl was preoccupied with something other than her old wish to aid and satisfy him , that she had a new life of her own alien to , and in some respects irreconcilable with , the existence in which he desired to confirm her . There was no renewal of open disagreement , but their conversations frequently ended , by tacit mutual consent , at a point which threatened divergence ; and in Yule 's case every such warning was a cause of intense irritation . He feared to provoke Marian , and this fear was again a torture to his pride . Beyond the fact that his daughter was in constant communication with the Miss Milvains , he knew , and could discover , nothing of the terms on which she stood with the girls '

Throughout the month of July , he suffered much from his wonted bilious attacks , and Mrs. Yule had to endure a double share of his illtemper , that which was naturally directed against her , and that of which Marian was the cause . In August things were slightly better ; but with the return to labour came a renewal of Yule 's sullenness and savageness . Sundry pieces of illluck of a professional kind — warnings , as he too well understood , that it was growing more and more difficult for him to hold his own against the new writers — exasperated his quarrel with destiny . The gloom of a cold and stormy September was doubly wretched in that house on the far borders of Camden Town , but in October the sun reappeared and it seemed to mollify the literary man 's mood . Just when Mrs. Yule and Marian began to hope that this long distemper must surely come to an end , there befell an incident which , at the best of times , would have occasioned misery , and which in the present juncture proved disastrous . It was one morning about eleven . Yule was in his study ; Marian was at the Museum ; Mrs. Yule had gone shopping . There came a sharp knock at the front door , and the servant , on opening , was confronted with a decently - dressed woman , who asked in a peremptory voice if Mrs. Yule was at home . '

123320	123609	123614	123614	mother	4349	' Mrs. Goby repeated at still greater length the details of her grievance , but long before she had finished Yule was sitting again at his desk in ostentatious disregard of her . Finally , the exasperated woman flung open the door , railed in a loud voice along the passage , and left the house with an alarming crash . It was not long before Mrs. Yule returned . Before taking off her things , she went down into the kitchen with certain purchases , and there she learnt from the servant what had happened during her absence . Fear and trembling possessed her — the sick , faint dread always excited by her husband 's wrath — but she felt obliged to go at once to the study . The scene that took place there was one of ignoble violence on Yule 's part , and , on that of his wife , of terrified self - accusation , changing at length to dolorous resentment of the harshness with which she was treated . When it was over , Yule took his hat and went out . He did not return for the mid - day meal , and when Marian , late in the afternoon , came back from the Museum , he was still absent . Not finding her mother in the parlour , Marian called at the head of the kitchen stairs . The servant answered , saying that Mrs. Yule was up in her bedroom , and that she did n't seem well . Marian at once went up and knocked at the bedroom door . In a moment or two her mother came out , showing a face of tearful misery . '

And your father 's in such a passion about it as never was . That woman Mrs. Goby rushed into the study when he was working ; it was this morning , when I happened to be out . And she throws all the blame on me for recommending her such a girl . And I did it for the best , that I did ! Annie promised me faithfully she 'd behave well , and never give me trouble , and she seemed thankful to me , because she was n't happy at home . And now to think of her causing all this disturbance ! I ought n't to have done such a thing without speaking about it to your father ; but you know how afraid I am to say a word to him about those people . And my sister 's told me so often I ought to be ashamed of myself , never helping her and her children ; she thinks I could do such a lot if I only liked . And now that I did try to do something , see what comes of it ! '

She had been weak to hold her peace so long ; at her age it was a simple duty to interfere when her mother was treated with such flagrant injustice . Her father 's behaviour was unworthy of a thinking man , and he must be made to feel that . Yule did not return . Dinner was delayed for half an hour , then Marian declared that they would wait no longer . The two made a sorry meal , and afterwards went together into the sitting - room . At eight o'clock they heard the front door open , and Yule 's footstep in the passage . Marian rose . '

And an hour or two afterwards Yule left the house without leave - taking . Soon after his departure there was a visitor 's rat - tat at the door ; it heralded Mrs. Goby . In the interview which then took place Marian assisted her mother to bear the vigorous onslaughts of the haberdasher 's wife . For more than two hours Mrs. Goby related her grievances , against the fugitive servant , against Mrs. Yule , against Mr. Yule ; meeting with no irritating opposition , she was able in this space of time to cool down to the temperature of normal intercourse , and when she went forth from the house again it was in a mood of dignified displeasure which she felt to be some recompense for the injuries of yesterday . A result of this annoyance was to postpone conversation between mother and daughter on the subject of John Yule 's death until a late hour of the afternoon . Marian was at work in the study , or endeavouring to work , for her thoughts would not fix themselves on the matter in hand for many minutes together , and Mrs. Yule came in with more than her customary diffidence .

And as for father , I am all but certain that , if he became rich , he would be a very much kinder man , a better man in every way . It is poverty that has made him worse than he naturally is ; it has that effect on almost everybody . Money does harm , too , sometimes ; but never , I think , to people who have a good heart and a strong mind . Father is naturally a warm - hearted man ; riches would bring out all the best in him . He would be generous again , which he has almost forgotten how to be among all his disappointments and battlings . Do n't be afraid of that change , but hope for it . '

128924	129023	128921	128921	Marian	211	' that at father 's age people do n't care to make such great changes . His home life , I feel sure , would n't be so very different from what it is now ; he would prefer to use his money in starting a paper or magazine . I know that would be his first thought . If more acquaintances came to his house , what would that matter ? It is n't as if he wished for fashionable society . They would be literary people , and why ever should n't you meet with them ? '
129024	129039	128921	128921	Marian	211	' I 've always been the reason why he could n't have many friends . '
129040	129112	128921	128921	Marian	211	' That 's a great mistake . If father ever said that , in his bad temper , he knew it was n't the truth . The chief reason has always been his poverty . It costs money to entertain friends ; time as well . Do n't think in this anxious way , mother . If we are to be rich , it will be better for all of us . '

He came into the room where mother and I were , and sat down , and began to tell us about the will just as if he were speaking to strangers about something he had read in the newspaper — that 's the only way I can describe it . Then he got up and went away into the study . I waited a little , then went to him there ; he was sitting at work , as if he had n't been away from home at all . I tried to tell him how sorry I was , but I could n't say anything . I began to cry foolishly . He spoke kindly to me , far more kindly than he has done for a long time ; but he would n't talk about the will , and I had to go away and leave him .

132782	132837	132690	132690	She	188	' He ca n't help thinking , Dora , what use he could have made of it . It has always been his greatest wish to have a literary paper of his own — like The Study , you know . He would have used the money in that way , I am sure . '

133656	133661	133662	133662	Dora	188	' Mrs. Reardon anything ? '
133666	133669	133670	133670	he	186	' What ? '
133675	133685	133686	133686	He	186	' Ten thousand ? You do n't say so ! '
133692	133709	133686	133686	He	186	' So Reardon is rescued from the slum and the clerk 's desk ! Well , I 'm
133771	133795	133769	133769	him	186	' After amusing himself with this subject for a few minutes more , he turned to the window and stood there in silence . '
133805	133828	133797	133797	you	186	' Dora inquired . He did not seem to hear her . On a repetition of the inquiry , he answered absently : '
133846	133882	133769	133769	him	186	' During the remainder of his stay he talked very little , and as Maud also was in an abstracted mood , tea passed almost in silence . On the point of departing he asked : '
133892	133893	133885	133885	Marian	211	' '
133901	133956	133894	133894	I	0	' answered Dora . He nodded , and went his way . It was necessary for him to work at a magazine article which he had begun this morning , and on reaching home he spread out his papers in the usual business - like fashion . The subject out of which he was manufacturing '
133958	134139	134140	134140	I	0	' had its difficulties , and was not altogether congenial to him ; this morning he had laboured with unwonted effort to produce about a page of manuscript , and now that he tried to resume the task his thoughts would not centre upon it . Jasper was too young to have thoroughly mastered the art of somnambulistic composition ; to write , he was still obliged to give exclusive attention to the matter under treatment . Dr. Johnson 's saying , that a man may write at any time if he will set himself doggedly to it , was often upon his lips , and had even been of help to him , as no doubt it has to many another man obliged to compose amid distracting circumstances ; but the formula had no efficacy this evening . Twice or thrice he rose from his chair , paced the room with a determined brow , and sat down again with vigorous clutch of the pen ; still he failed to excogitate a single sentence that would serve his purpose . '
134153	134164	134165	134165	I	0	' was his thought as he finally abandoned the endeavour . '
134172	134389	134390	134390	I	0	' To this end he settled himself in an easy - chair and began to smoke cigarettes . Some dozen of these aids to reflection only made him so nervous that he could no longer remain alone . He put on his hat and overcoat and went out — to find that it was raining heavily . He returned for an umbrella , and before long was walking aimlessly about the Strand , unable to make up his mind whether to turn into a theatre or not . Instead of doing so , he sought a certain upper room of a familiar restaurant , where the day 's papers were to be seen , and perchance an acquaintance might be met . Only half a dozen men were there , reading and smoking , and all were unknown to him . He drank a glass of lager beer , skimmed the news of the evening , and again went out into the bad weather . After all it was better to go home . Everything he encountered had an unsettling effect upon him , so that he was further than ever from the decision at which he wished to arrive . In Mornington Road he came upon Whelpdale , who was walking slowly under an umbrella . '
134398	134399	134390	134390	I	0	' '
134409	134410	134406	134406	you	0	' '
134419	134476	134477	134477	Biffen	235	' said Whelpdale , with unusual diffidence . Reassured , he gladly returned to the house . Milvain acquainted him with the fact of John Yule 's death , and with its result so far as it concerned the Reardons . They talked of how the couple would probably behave under this decisive change of circumstances . '
134486	134490	134493	134493	he	235	' said Whelpdale . '
134521	134522	134536	134536	They	2877	' '
134534	134535	134536	134536	They	2877	' '
134537	134566	134536	134536	They	2877	're not at all suited to each other . Mrs. Reardon no doubt repents her marriage bitterly , and I doubt whether Reardon cares much for his wife . '
134567	134601	134536	134536	They	2877	' As there 's no way of getting divorced they 'll make the best of it . Ten thousand pounds produce about four hundred a year ; it 's enough to live on . '
134602	134616	134536	134536	They	2877	' And be miserable on — if they no longer love each other . '
134617	134619	134536	134536	They	2877	' You 're
134625	134629	134621	134623	a sentimental fellow	2878	' cried Jasper . '
134667	134668	134656	134657	a man	4361	' '
134686	134687	134677	134677	you	2879	' '
134736	134795	134735	134735	I	0	'm not quite sure about her . As a rule , marriage is the result of a mild preference , encouraged by circumstances , and deliberately heightened into strong sexual feeling . You , of all men , know well enough that the same kind of feeling could be produced for almost any woman who was n't repulsive . '
134796	134811	134735	134735	I	0	' The same kind of feeling ; but there 's vast difference of degree . '
134812	134881	134735	134735	I	0	' To be sure . I think it 's only a matter of degree . When it rises to the point of frenzy people may strictly be said to be in love ; and , as I tell you , I think that comes to pass very rarely indeed . For my own part , I have no experience of it , and think I never shall have . '
134882	134890	134891	134891	They	2885	' I ca n't say the same . '
134894	134938	134891	134891	They	2885	' I dare say you have imagined yourself in love — or really been so for aught I know — a dozen times . How the deuce you can attach any importance to such feeling where marriage is concerned I do n't understand . '
134939	134944	134946	134946	Whelpdale	207	' Well , now , '
134948	135005	134946	134946	Whelpdale	207	' I have never upheld the theory — at least not since I was sixteen — that a man can be in love only once , or that there is one particular woman if he misses whom he can never be happy . There may be thousands of women whom I could love with equal sincerity . '
135006	135225	134735	134735	I	0	' I object to the word " love " altogether . It has been vulgarised . Let us talk about compatibility . Now , I should say that , no doubt , and speaking scientifically , there is one particular woman supremely fitted to each man . I put aside consideration of circumstances ; we know that circumstances will disturb any degree of abstract fitness . But in the nature of things there must be one woman whose nature is specially well adapted to harmonise with mine , or with yours . If there were any means of discovering this woman in each case , then I have no doubt it would be worth a man 's utmost effort to do so , and any amount of erotic jubilation would be reasonable when the discovery was made . But the thing is impossible , and , what 's more , we know what ridiculous fallibility people display when they imagine they have found the best substitute for that indiscoverable . This is what makes me impatient with sentimental talk about marriage . An educated man must n't play so into the hands of ironic destiny . Let him think he wants to marry a woman ; but do n't let him exaggerate his feelings or idealise their nature . '
135226	135236	135238	135238	Whelpdale	207	' There 's a good deal in all that , '
135243	135335	135238	135238	Whelpdale	207	' There 's more than a good deal ; there 's the last word on the subject . The days of romantic love are gone by . The scientific spirit has put an end to that kind of self - deception . Romantic love was inextricably blended with all sorts of superstitions — belief in personal immortality , in superior beings , in — all the rest of it . What we think of now is moral and intellectual and physical compatibility ; I mean , if we are reasonable people . '
135336	135353	135355	135355	Whelpdale	207	' And if we are not so unfortunate as to fall in love with an incompatible , '
135359	135393	135355	135355	Whelpdale	207	' Well , that is a form of unreason — a blind desire which science could explain in each case . I rejoice that I am not subject to that form of epilepsy . '
135394	135402	135238	135238	Whelpdale	207	' You positively never were in love ? '
135403	135420	135238	135238	Whelpdale	207	' As you understand it , never . But I have felt a very distinct preference . '
135421	135429	135355	135355	Whelpdale	207	' Based on what you think compatibility ? '
135430	135454	135455	135455	He	207	' Yes . Not strong enough to make me lose sight of prudence and advantage . No , not strong enough for that . '
135462	135473	135475	135475	Whelpdale	207	' Then of course that ca n't be called love , '
135477	135538	135475	135475	Whelpdale	207	' Perhaps not . But , as I told you , a preference of this kind can be heightened into emotion , if one chooses . In the case of which I am thinking it easily might be . And I think it very improbable indeed that I should repent it if anything led me to indulge such an impulse . '
135542	135556	135539	135539	Whelpdale	207	' This is very interesting . I hope it may lead to something . '
135557	135588	135455	135455	He	207	' I do n't think it will . I am far more likely to marry some woman for whom I have no preference , but who can serve me materially . '
135589	135628	135649	135650	the other	1606	' I confess that amazes me . I know the value of money as well as you do , but I would n't marry a rich woman for whom I had no preference . By Jove , no ! '
135629	135640	135539	135539	Whelpdale	207	' Yes , yes . You are a consistent sentimentalist . '
135641	135647	135649	135650	the other	1606	' Doomed to perpetual disappointment , '
135658	135677	135649	135650	the other	1606	' Courage , my boy ! I have every hope that I shall see you marry and repent . '
135678	135713	135714	135714	Jasper	186	' I admit the danger of that . But shall I tell you something I have observed ? Each woman I fall in love with is of a higher type than the one before . '
135724	135833	135834	135834	He	186	' But I am perfectly serious , I assure you . To go back only three or four years . There was the daughter of my landlady in Barham Street ; well , a nice girl enough , but limited , decidedly limited . Next came that girl at the stationer 's — you remember ? She was distinctly an advance , both in mind and person . Then there was Miss Embleton ; yes , I think she made again an advance . She had been at Bedford College , you know , and was really a girl of considerable attainments ; morally , admirable . Afterwards — '
135837	135847	135849	135849	Jasper	186	' The maiden from Birmingham , was n't it ? '
135854	135883	135849	135849	Jasper	186	' Yes , it was . Well , I ca n't be quite sure . But in many respects that girl was my ideal ; she really was . '
135884	135896	135958	135958	Whelpdale	207	' As you once or twice told me at the time . '
135897	135940	135951	135951	Jasper	186	' I really believe she would rank above Miss Embleton — at all events from my point of view . And that 's everything , you know . It 's the effect a woman produces on one that has to be considered . '
135941	135949	135951	135951	Jasper	186	' The next should be a paragon , '
135953	135957	135951	135951	Jasper	186	' The next ? '
136013	136297	136330	136330	They	2890	' work before going to bed . He did in fact write half a dozen lines , but with the effort came back his former mood . Very soon the pen dropped , and he was once more in the throes of anxious mental debate . He sat till after midnight , and when he went to his bedroom it was with a lingering step , which proved him still a prey to indecision . Alfred Yule 's behaviour under his disappointment seemed to prove that even for him the uses of adversity could be sweet . On the day after his return home he displayed a most unwonted mildness in such remarks as he addressed to his wife , and his bearing towards Marian was gravely gentle . At meals he conversed , or rather monologised , on literary topics , with occasionally one of his grim jokes , pointed for Marian 's appreciation . He became aware that the girl had been overtaxing her strength of late , and suggested a few weeks of recreation among new novels . The coldness and gloom which had possessed him when he made a formal announcement of the news appeared to have given way before the sympathy manifested by his wife and daughter ; he was now sorrowful , but resigned . He explained to Marian the exact nature of her legacy . It was to be paid out of her uncle 's share in a wholesale stationery business , with which John Yule had been connected for the last twenty years , but from which he had not long ago withdrawn a large portion of his invested capital . This house was known as '
136302	136314	136330	136330	They	2890	' a name which Marian now heard for the first time . '
136324	136329	136315	136315	I	0	' said her father . '
136375	136476	136370	136370	I	0	' The executors were two old friends of the deceased , one of them a former partner in his paper - making concern . On the evening of the second day , about an hour after dinner was over , Mr. Hinks called at the house ; as usual , he went into the study . Before long came a second visitor , Mr. Quarmby , who joined Yule and Hinks . The three had all sat together for some time , when Marian , who happened to be coming down stairs , saw her father at the study door . '
136492	136497	136478	136479	your mother	868	' he said urbanely . '
136511	136528	136506	136506	We	2894	' It had not often happened that Marian was invited to join parties of this kind . '
136536	136540	136530	136530	you	2895	' she asked . '
136557	136629	136550	136550	you	2895	' Marian informed Mrs. Yule that the visitors would have supper , and then went to the study . Mr. Quarmby was smoking a pipe ; Mr. Hinks , who on grounds of economy had long since given up tobacco , sat with his hands in his trouser pockets , and his long , thin legs tucked beneath the chair ; both rose and greeted Marian with more than ordinary warmth . '
136640	136666	136631	136631	you	2895	' asked Mr. Quarmby , laying one hand on his ample stomach and elevating his pipe as if it were a glass of beaded liquor . '
136673	136674	136667	136667	I	0	' '
136682	136714	136679	136679	you	2895	' Marian replied . The easiest chair was placed for her , Mr. Hinks hastening to perform this courtesy , and her father apprised her of the topic they were discussing . '
136738	136769	136770	136770	I	0	' Mr. Quarmby beamed benevolently upon her , and Mr. Hinks , his scraggy neck at full length , awaited her reply with a look of the most respectful attention . '
136783	136809	136770	136770	I	0	' the girl replied , casting down her eyes and smiling . Mr. Quarmby uttered a hollow chuckle , Mr. Hinks laughed thinly and exclaimed , '
136817	136826	136679	136679	you	2895	' Yule affected to applaud with impartial smile . '
136838	136896	136897	136897	We	2897	' remarked Mr. Hinks , with an air of diffident profundity . Yule held forth on the subject for a few minutes in laboured phrases . Presently the conversation turned to periodicals , and the three men were unanimous in an opinion that no existing monthly or quarterly could be considered as representing the best literary opinion . '
136900	136905	136897	136897	We	2897	' remarked Mr. Quarmby , '

136974	136991	136929	136929	their	2898	' said Mr. Hinks , with a look as if something were grating between his teeth . '
136995	137000	136929	136929	their	2898	' put in Yule . '
137072	137073	137070	137070	Quarmby	245	' '
137085	137090	137092	137092	he	292	' said Mr. Quarmby , '
137099	137100	137092	137092	he	292	' '
137105	137110	137092	137092	he	292	' came from Yule ; '
137148	137149	137142	137143	some capitalist	2901	' '
137155	137160	137142	137143	some capitalist	2901	' opined Mr. Quarmby . '
137248	137277	137218	137218	Hinks	248	' Even here , in the freedom of a friend 's study , he laughed his Reading - room laugh , folding both hands upon his expansive waistcoat . '
137292	137296	137282	137287	a serial of the better kind	2904	' said Yule . '
137312	137313	137566	137566	he	248	' '
137322	137546	137566	137566	he	248	' chimed in Mr. Hinks . They pursued the discussion as if they were an editorial committee planning a review of which the first number was shortly to appear . It occupied them until Mrs. Yule announced at the door that supper was ready . During the meal Marian found herself the object of unusual attention ; her father troubled to inquire if the cut of cold beef he sent her was to her taste , and kept an eye on her progress . Mr. Hinks talked to her in a tone of respectful sympathy , and Mr. Quarmby was paternally jovial when he addressed her . Mrs. Yule would have kept silence , in her ordinary way , but this evening her husband made several remarks which he had adapted to her intellect , and even showed that a reply would be graciously received . Mother and daughter remained together when the men withdrew to their tobacco and toddy . Neither made allusion to the wonderful change , but they talked more light - heartedly than for a long time . On the morrow Yule began by consulting Marian with regard to the disposition of matter in an essay he was writing . What she said he weighed carefully , and seemed to think that she had set his doubts at rest . '
137551	137560	137566	137566	he	248	' he said presently , with a sigh . '
137576	137606	137568	137568	He	248	'm afraid he 's the kind of man to have a paralytic stroke ; it would n't astonish me to hear at any moment that he was lying helpless . '
137607	137618	137575	137575	I	0	' What ever would become of him in that case ? '
137619	137656	137575	137575	I	0	' Goodness knows ! One might ask the same of so many of us . What would become of me , for instance , if I were incapable of work ? Marian could make no reply . '
137667	137676	137660	137660	I	0	' he went on in a lowered tone , '
137690	137701	137702	137702	She	2905	'm beginning to have a little trouble with my eyes . '
137709	137714	137702	137702	She	2905	' With your eyes ? '
137715	137769	137689	137689	I	0	' Nothing , I hope ; but — well , I think I shall see an oculist . One does n't care to face a prospect of failing sight , perhaps of cataract , or something of that kind ; still , it 's better to know the facts , I should say . '
137770	137779	137781	137781	Marian	211	' By all means go to an oculist , '
137785	137810	137811	137811	He	0	' Do n't disturb yourself about it . It may be nothing at all . But in any case I must change my glasses . '
137825	137835	137836	137836	he	0	' Now , I appeal to you , Marian , '
137839	137874	137836	137836	he	0	' could I possibly save money out of an income that has never exceeded two hundred and fifty pounds , and often — I mean even in latter years — has been much less ? '
137875	137884	137811	137811	He	0	' I do n't see how you could . '
137885	137933	137934	137934	Marian	211	' In one way , of course , I have managed it . My life is insured for five hundred pounds . But that is no provision for possible disablement . If I could no longer earn money with my pen , what would become of me ? '
137951	137955	137957	137958	her father	511	' Sit down , '
137960	138056	137957	137958	her father	511	' You are not to work for a few days , and I myself shall be none the worse for a morning 's rest . Poor old Hinks ! I suppose we shall help him among us , somehow . Quarmby , of course , is comparatively flourishing . Well , we have been companions for a quarter of a century , we three . When I first met Quarmby I was a Grub Street gazetteer , and I think he was even poorer than I. A life of toil ! A life of toil ! '
138057	138065	137934	137934	Marian	211	' That it has been , indeed . '
138066	138072	138074	138074	he	511	' By - the - by '
138085	138104	138074	138074	he	511	' what did you think of our imaginary review , the thing we were talking about last night ? '
138105	138112	138114	138114	Marian	211	' There are so many periodicals , '
138118	138139	138114	138114	Marian	211	' So many ? My dear child , if we live another ten years we shall see the number trebled . '
138140	138145	137934	137934	Marian	211	' Is it desirable ? '
138146	138247	138249	138249	he	511	' That there should be such growth of periodicals ? Well , from one point of view , no . No doubt they take up the time which some people would give to solid literature . But , on the other hand , there 's a far greater number of people who would probably not read at all , but for the temptations of these short and new articles ; and they may be induced to pass on to substantial works . Of course it all depends on the quality of the periodical matter you offer . Now , magazines like '
138258	138315	138249	138249	he	511	' might very well be dispensed with , unless one regards them as an alternative to the talking of scandal or any other vicious result of total idleness . But such a monthly as we projected would be of distinct literary value . There can be no doubt that someone or other will shortly establish it . '
138316	138321	138323	138323	Marian	211	' I am afraid , '
138325	138343	138323	138323	Marian	211	' I have n't so much sympathy with literary undertakings as you would like me to have . '
138448	138454	138456	138457	her father	511	' I have felt that , '
138477	138492	138456	138457	her father	511	' I greatly fear that I have made your life something of a martyrdom — '
138493	138547	138456	138457	her father	511	' Do n't think I meant that , father . I am speaking only of the general question . I ca n't be quite so zealous as you are , that 's all . I love books , but I could wish people were content for a while with those we already have . '
138548	138629	138630	138630	He	2910	' My dear Marian , do n't suppose that I am out of sympathy with you here . Alas ! how much of my work has been mere drudgery , mere labouring for a livelihood ! How gladly I would have spent much more of my time among the great authors , with no thought of making money of them ! If I speak approvingly of a scheme for a new periodical , it is greatly because of my necessities . '
138642	138651	138652	138652	she	211	' You would of course write for it , '
138655	138673	138652	138652	she	211	' Marian , why should n't I edit it ? Why should n't it be your property ? '
138674	138679	138680	138680	She	211	' My property — ? '
138733	138740	138742	138742	Yule	211	' Let us talk it over , '
138755	138789	138790	138790	He	2910	' The idea may well startle you at first . It will seem to you that I propose to make away with your property before you have even come into possession of it . '
138793	138927	138790	138790	He	2910	' But , in fact , what I have in mind is merely an investment for your capital , and that an admirable one . Five thousand pounds at three per cent . — one does n't care to reckon on more — represents a hundred and fifty a year . Now , there can be very little doubt that , if it were invested in literary property such as I have in mind , it would bring you five times that interest , and before long perhaps much more . Of course I am now speaking in the roughest outline . I should have to get trust - worthy advice ; complete and detailed estimates would be submitted to you . At present I merely suggest to you this form of investment . '
138947	138953	138954	138954	she	211	' Then , of course , '
138957	138969	138954	138954	she	211	' you do n't expect me to give any decided answer . '
138970	139088	139090	139090	he	2910	' Of course not — of course not . I merely put before you the chief advantages of such an investment . As I am a selfish old fellow , I 'll talk about the benefit to myself first of all . I should be editor of the new review ; I should draw a stipend sufficient to all my needs — quite content , at first , to take far less than another man would ask , and to progress with the advance of the periodical . This position would enable me to have done with mere drudgery ; I should only write when I felt called to do so — when the spirit moved me . '
139104	139113	139090	139090	he	2910	' My eyes would be greatly spared henceforth . '
139133	139178	139130	139130	he	2910	' And suppose I really were doomed to lose my sight in the course of a few years , am I wrong in thinking that the proprietor of this periodical would willingly grant a small annuity to the man who had firmly established it ? '
139179	139188	139190	139190	Marian	211	' I see the force of all that , '
139192	139205	139190	139190	Marian	211	' but it takes for granted that the periodical will be successful . '
139206	139234	139130	139130	he	2910	' It does . In the hands of a publisher like Jedwood — a vigorous man of the new school — its success could scarcely be doubtful . '
139235	139251	139130	139130	he	2910	' Do you think five thousand pounds would be enough to start such a review ? '
139252	139330	139190	139190	Marian	211	' Well , I can say nothing definite on that point . For one thing , the coat must be made according to the cloth ; expenditure can be largely controlled without endangering success . Then again , I think Jedwood would take a share in the venture . These are details . At present I only want to familiarise you with the thought that an investment of this sort will very probably offer itself to you . '
139331	139343	139345	139345	Marian	211	' It would be better if we called it a speculation , '
139538	139545	139547	139548	her father	511	' Name it as you will , '
139557	139592	139593	139593	She	211	' True , every commercial enterprise is a speculation . But let me ask you one question , and beg you to reply frankly . Do you distrust my ability to conduct this periodical ? '
139642	139649	139650	139650	she	211	' My opinion would be worthless , '
139653	139668	139650	139650	she	211	' If Jedwood were disposed to put confidence in me , you also would ? '
139669	139696	139697	139697	He	511	' There 's no need to talk of that now , father . Indeed , I ca n't say anything that would sound like a promise . '
139711	139737	139705	139705	she	211	' But you have no objection , Marian , to talk in a friendly way of a project that would mean so much to me ? '
139738	139747	139748	139748	she	211	' But I am afraid to encourage you , '
139753	139772	139748	139748	she	211	' It is impossible for me to say whether I can do as you wish , or not . '
139773	139843	139705	139705	she	211	' Yes , yes ; I perfectly understand that . Heaven forbid that I should regard you as a child to be led independntly of your own views and wishes ! With so large a sum of money at stake , it would be monstrous if I acted rashly , and tried to persuade you to do the same . The matter will have to be most gravely considered . '
139844	139847	139848	139848	She	211	' Yes . '
139852	139875	139848	139848	She	211	' But if only it should come to something ! You do n't know what it would mean to me , Marian . '
139876	139893	139705	139705	she	211	' Yes , father ; I know very well how you think and feel about it . '
139894	139898	139899	139899	He	2918	' Do you ? '
139911	140071	139899	139899	He	2918	' If I could see myself the editor of an influential review , all my bygone toils and sufferings would be as nothing ; I should rejoice in them as the steps to this triumph . Meminisse juvabit ! My dear , I am not a man fitted for subordinate places . My nature is framed for authority . The failure of all my undertakings rankles so in my heart that sometimes I feel capable of every brutality , every meanness , every hateful cruelty . To you I have behaved shamefully . Do n't interrupt me , Marian . I have treated you abominably , my child , my dear daughter — and all the time with a full sense of what I was doing . That 's the punishment of faults such as mine . I hate myself for every harsh word and angry look I have given you ; at the time , I hated myself ! '
140072	140075	139705	139705	she	211	' Father — '
140076	140217	139899	139899	He	2918	' No , no ; let me speak , Marian . You have forgiven me ; I know it . You were always ready to forgive , dear . Can I ever forget that evening when I spoke like a brute , and you came afterwards and addressed me as if the wrong had been on your side ? It burns in my memory . It was n't I who spoke ; it was the demon of failure , of humiliation . My enemies sit in triumph , and scorn at me ; the thought of it is infuriating . Have I deserved this ? Am I the inferior of — of those men who have succeeded and now try to trample on me ? No ! I am not ! I have a better brain and a better heart ! '
140260	140288	140248	140248	his	2919	' Why should you think so much of these troubles , father ? Is it such a great matter that narrow - minded people triumph over you ? '
140289	140294	140295	140295	He	2919	' Narrow - minded ? '
140301	140308	140295	140295	He	2919	' You admit they are that ? '
140309	140319	140248	140248	his	2919	' I feel very sure that Mr. Fadge is . '
140320	140331	140248	140248	his	2919	' Then you are not on his side against me ? '
140332	140341	140295	140295	He	2919	' How could you suppose such a thing ? '
140342	140386	140387	140387	He	2919	' Well , well ; we wo n't talk of that . Perhaps it is n't a great matter . No — from a philosophical point of view , such things are unspeakably petty . But I am not much of a philosopher . '
140397	140602	140394	140394	his	2919	' Defeat in life is defeat , after all ; and unmerited failure is a bitter curse . You see , I am not too old to do something yet . My sight is failing , but I can take care of it . If I had my own review , I would write every now and then a critical paper in my very best style . You remember poor old Hinks 's note about me in his book ? We laughed at it , but he was n't so far wrong . I have many of those qualities . A man is conscious of his own merits , as well as of his defects . I have done a few admirable things . You remember my paper on Lord Herbert of Cherbury ? No one ever wrote a more subtle piece of criticism ; but it was swept aside among the rubbish of the magazines . And it 's just because of my pungent phrases that I have excited so much enmity . Wait ! Wait ! Let me have my own review , and leisure , and satisfaction of mind — heavens ! what I will write ! How I will scarify ! '
140603	140634	140394	140394	his	2919	' That is unworthy of you . How much better to ignore your enemies ! In such a position , I should carefully avoid every word that betrayed personal feeling . '
140635	140827	140394	140394	his	2919	' Well , well ; you are of course right , my good girl . And I believe I should do injustice to myself if I made you think that those ignoble motives are the strongest in me . No ; it is n't so . From my boyhood I have had a passionate desire of literary fame , deep down below all the surface faults of my character . The best of my life has gone by , and it drives me to despair when I feel that I have not gained the position due to me . There is only one way of doing this now , and that is by becoming the editor of an important periodical . Only in that way shall I succeed in forcing people to pay attention to my claims . Many a man goes to his grave unrecognised , just because he has never had a fair judgment . Nowadays it is the unscrupulous men of business who hold the attention of the public ; they blow their trumpets so loudly that the voices of honest men have no chance of being heard . '
141001	141020	141021	141021	she	211	' Shall we leave this to be talked of when the money has been paid over to me ? '
141028	141141	141021	141021	she	211	' Yes . Do n't suppose I wish to influence you by dwelling on my own hardships . That would be contemptible . I have only taken this opportunity of making myself better known to you . I do n't readily talk of myself , and in general my real feelings are hidden by the faults of my temper . In suggesting how you could do me a great service , and at the same time reap advantage for yourself , I could n't but remember how little reason you have to think kindly of me . But we will postpone further talk . You will think over what I have said ? '
141177	141183	141184	141184	she	486	' Yes , I have , '

For the remainder of the morning she did not meet him , and at the mid - day dinner he was silent , though he brought no book to the table with him , as he was wo nt to do when in his dark moods . Marian talked with her mother , doing her best to preserve the appearance of cheerfulness which was natural since the change in Yule 's demeanour . She chanced to meet her father in the passage just as she was going out . He smiled ( it was more like a grin of pain ) and nodded , but said nothing . When the front door closed , he went into the parlour . Mrs. Yule was reading , or , at all events , turning over a volume of an illustrated magazine . '

There was no underhand plotting between them to influence their daughter ; Mrs. Yule had as much desire for the happiness of her husband as for that of Marian , but she felt powerless to effect anything on either side .

He spent a gloomy hour in the study , then went off to join the literary circle at Mr. Quarmby 's . Occasionally Milvain met his sisters as they came out of church on Sunday morning , and walked home to have dinner with them . He did so to - day , though the sky was cheerless and a strong north - west wind made it anything but agreeable to wait about in open spaces . '

142723	142735	142736	142736	she	211	' You have n't a very good opinion of Mrs. Reardon , '
142739	142790	142736	142736	she	211	' She is a difficult person to judge . I never disliked her , by any means ; but she was decidedly out of place as the wife of a struggling author . Perhaps I have been a little prejudiced against her since Reardon quarrelled with me on her account . '
142833	142845	142846	142846	Milvain	186	' I may as well let you know all about it , '
142862	142888	142889	142890	The listener	1200	' I met Reardon not long after they had parted , and he charged me with being in great part the cause of his troubles . '
142897	142952	142889	142890	The listener	1200	' You would never imagine what my fault was . Reardon declared that the tone of my conversation had been morally injurious to his wife . He said I was always glorifying wordly success , and that this had made her discontented with her lot . Sounds rather ludicrous , do n't you think ? '
142953	142959	142851	142851	he	186	' It was very strange . '
142960	143044	142851	142851	he	186	' Reardon was in desperate earnest , poor fellow . And , to tell you the truth , I fear there may have been something in his complaint . I told him at once that I should henceforth keep away from Mrs. Edmund Yule 's ; and so I have done , with the result , of course , that they suppose I condemn Mrs. Reardon 's behaviour . The affair was a nuisance , but I had no choice , I think . '
143045	143058	142889	142890	The listener	1200	' You say that perhaps your talk really was harmful to her ? '
143059	143074	142851	142851	he	186	' It may have been , though such a danger never occurred to me . '
143075	143085	142851	142851	he	186	' Then Amy must be very weak - minded . '
143086	143096	142889	142890	The listener	1200	' To be influenced by such a paltry fellow ? '
143097	143108	142851	142851	he	186	' To be influenced by anyone in such a way . '
143109	143120	143121	143121	Jasper	186	' You think the worse of me for this story ? '
143124	143139	143121	143121	Jasper	186	' I do n't quite understand it . How did you talk to her ? '
143140	143245	142851	142851	he	186	' As I talk to everyone . You have heard me say the same things many a time . I simply declare my opinion that the end of literary work — unless one is a man of genius — is to secure comfort and repute . This does n't seem to me very scandalous . But Mrs. Reardon was perhaps too urgent in repeating such views to her husband . She saw that in my case they were likely to have solid results , and it was a misery to her that Reardon could n't or would n't work in the same practical way . '
143246	143252	142851	142851	he	186	' It was very unfortunate . '
143253	143262	142851	142851	he	186	' And you are inclined to blame me ? '
143263	143289	142851	142851	he	186	' No ; because I am so sure that you only spoke in the way natural to you , without a thought of such consequences . '
143293	143374	143290	143290	Jasper	186	' That 's precisely the truth . Nearly all men who have their way to make think as I do , but most feel obliged to adopt a false tone , to talk about literary conscientiousness , and so on . I simply say what I think , with no pretences . I should like to be conscientious , but it 's a luxury I ca n't afford . I 've told you all this often enough , you know . '
143375	143378	143433	143433	he	186	' Yes . '
143379	143390	143391	143391	he	186	' But it has n't been morally injurious to you , '
143397	143409	143391	143391	he	186	' Not at all . Still I do n't like it . '
143509	143516	143517	143517	he	186	' You do n't like it ? '
143521	143530	143517	143517	he	186	' It has become rather tiresome to you ? '
143531	143546	143547	143547	He	186	' I feel sorry that you should always represent yourself in an unfavourable light . '

It was nothing to her that Jasper valued her more because of her money ; impossible for it to be otherwise . Satisfied that he did value her , to begin with , for her own sake , she was very willing to accept money as her ally in the winning of his love .

That Jasper was of cold temperament she had often feared ; yet there was always the consoling thought that she did not see with perfect clearness into his nature .

She was nervous , painfully self - conscious , touched with maidenly shame , but could not abandon herself to that delicious emotion which ought to have been the fulfilment of all her secret imaginings . Now at length there began a throbbing in her bosom . Keeping her face averted , her eyes cast down , she waited for a repetition of the note that was in that last '
146093	146140	146141	146141	Marian	211	' She felt a change in the hands that held hers — a warmth , a moist softness ; it caused a shock through her veins . He was trying to draw her nearer , but she kept at full arm 's length and looked irresponsive . '

Marian closed her eyes and abandoned herself to the luxury of the dream . It was her first complete escape from the world of intellectual routine , her first taste of life . All the pedantry of her daily toil slipped away like a cumbrous garment ; she was clad only in her womanhood . Once or twice a shudder of strange self - consciousness went through her , and she felt guilty , immodest ; but upon that sensation followed a surge of passionate joy , obliterating memory and forethought .

Jasper walked about half the way to St. Paul 's Crescent . It was arranged that he should address a letter for her to the care of his sisters ; but in a day or two the change of lodgings would be effected . When they had parted , Marian looked back . But Jasper was walking quickly away , his head bent , in profound meditation . END OF THE SECOND VOLUME . Refuge from despair is often found in the passion of self - pity and that spirit of obstinate resistance which it engenders . In certain natures the extreme of self - pity is intolerable , and leads to self - destruction ; but there are less fortunate beings whom the vehemence of their revolt against fate strengthens to endure in suffering . These latter are rather imaginative than passionate ; the stages of their woe impress them as the acts of a drama , which they can not bring themselves to cut short , so various are the possibilities of its dark motive . The intellectual man who kills himself is most often brought to that decision by conviction of his insignificance ; self - pity merges in self - scorn , and the humiliated soul is intolerant of existence . He who survives under like conditions does so because misery magnifies him in his own estimate . It was by force of commiserating his own lot that Edwin Reardon continued to live through the first month after his parting from Amy . Once or twice a week , sometimes early in the evening , sometimes at midnight or later , he haunted the street at Westbourne Park where his wife was dwelling , and on each occasion he returned to his garret with a fortified sense of the injustice to which he was submitted , of revolt against the circumstances which had driven him into outer darkness , of bitterness against his wife for saving her own comfort rather than share his downfall . At times he was not far from that state of sheer distraction which Mrs. Edmund Yule preferred to suppose that he had reached . An extraordinary arrogance now and then possessed him ; he stood amid his poor surroundings with the sensations of an outraged exile , and laughed aloud in furious contempt of all who censured or pitied him . On hearing from Jasper Milvain that Amy had fallen ill , or at all events was suffering in health from what she had gone through , he felt a momentary pang which all but determined him to hasten to her side . The reaction was a feeling of distinct pleasure that she had her share of pain , and even a hope that her illness might become grave ; he pictured himself summoned to her sick - chamber , imagined her begging his forgiveness . But it was not merely , nor in great part , a malicious satisfaction ; he succeeded in believing that Amy suffered because she still had a remnant of love for him . As the days went by and he heard nothing , disappointment and resentment occupied him . At length he ceased to haunt the neighbourhood . His desires grew sullen ; he became fixed in the resolve to hold entirely apart and doggedly await the issue . At the end of each month he sent half the money he had received from Carter , simply enclosing postal orders in an envelope addressed to his wife . The first two remittances were in no way acknowleged ; the third brought a short note from Amy : '

148473	148551	148470	148470	He	191	' I regard it as quite natural that you should put the worst interpretation on whatever I do . As for my privations , I think very little of them ; they are a trifle in comparison with the thought that I am forsaken just because my pocket is empty . And I am far indeed from thinking that you can be pained by whatever I may undergo ; that would suppose some generosity in your nature . '
148717	148724	148725	148725	he	235	' I really do not see , '
148739	148835	148725	148725	he	235	' how your wife could have acted otherwise . Of course I am quite unable to judge the attitude of her mind , but I think , I ca n't help thinking , from what I knew of her , that there has been strictly a misunderstanding between you . It was a hard and miserable thing that she should have to leave you for a time , and you could n't face the necessity in a just spirit . Do n't you think there 's some truth in this way of looking at it ? '
148836	148856	148725	148725	he	235	' As a woman , it was her part to soften the hateful necessity ; she made it worse . '

149042	149412	149037	149040	Mr. Bailey , Grocer	307	' he read the chapters to Reardon , not only for his own satisfaction , but in great part because he hoped that this example of productivity might in the end encourage the listener to resume his own literary tasks . Reardon found much to criticise in his friend 's work ; it was noteworthy that he objected and condemned with much less hesitation than in his better days , for sensitive reticence is one of the virtues wo nt to be assailed by suffering , at all events in the weaker natures . Biffen purposely urged these discussions as far as possible , and doubtless they benefited Reardon for the time ; but the defeated novelist could not be induced to undertake another practical illustration of his own views . Occasionally he had an impulse to plan a story , but an hour 's turning it over in his mind sufficed to disgust him . His ideas seemed barren , vapid ; it would have been impossible for him to write half a dozen pages , and the mere thought of a whole book overcame him with the dread of insurmountable difficulties , immeasurable toil . In time , however , he was able to read . He had a pleasure in contemplating the little collection of sterling books that alone remained to him from his library ; the sight of many volumes would have been a weariness , but these few — when he was again able to think of books at all — were as friendly countenances . He could not read continuously , but sometimes he opened his Shakspeare , for instance , and dreamed over a page or two . From such glimpses there remained in his head a line or a short passage , which he kept repeating to himself wherever he went ; generally some example of sweet or sonorous metre which had a soothing effect upon him . With odd result on one occasion . He was walking in one of the back streets of Islington , and stopped idly to gaze into the window of some small shop . Standing thus , he forgot himself , and presently recited aloud : '
149415	149451	149413	149413	Cæsar	333	' tis his schoolmaster : An argument that he is pluck'd , when hither He sends so poor a pinion of his wing , Which had superflous kings for messengers Not many moons gone by . '

He told his wife that evening that Reardon had been talking to him in the most extraordinary fashion , no understanding a word he said . All this time he was on the look - out for employment that would be more suitable to his unfortunate clerk . Whether slightly demented or not , Reardon gave no sign of inability to discharge his duties ; he was conscientious as ever , and might , unless he changed greatly , be relied upon in positions of more responsibility than his present one . And at length , early in October , there came to the secretary 's knowledge an opportunity with which he lost no time in acquainting Reardon . The latter repaired that evening to Clipstone Street , and climbed to Biffen 's chamber . He entered with a cheerful look , and exclaimed : '
150353	150372	150349	150351	the human body	3057	' Biffen looked with some concern at his friend , so unwonted was a sally of this kind . '

151060	151302	151303	151303	I	0	' In truth , there needed little persuasion . Perverseness , one of the forms or issues of self - pity , made him strive against his desire , and caused him to adopt a tone of acerbity in excess of what he felt ; but already he had made up his mind to see Amy . Even if this excuse had not presented itself , he must very soon have yielded to the longing for a sight of his wife 's face which day by day increased among all the conflicting passions of which he was the victim . A month or two ago , when the summer sunshine made his confinement to the streets a daily torture , he convinced himself that there remained in him no trace of his love for Amy ; there were moments when he thought of her with repugnance , as a cold , selfish woman , who had feigned affection when it seemed her interest to do so , but brutally declared her true self when there was no longer anything to be hoped from him . That was the self - deception of misery . Love , even passion , was still alive in the depths of his being ; the animation with which he sped to his friend as soon as a new hope had risen was the best proof of his feeling . He went home and wrote to Amy . '
151346	152005	151339	151339	I	0	' She would receive this by the first post to - morrow , Saturday , and doubtless would let him hear in reply some time in the afternoon . Impatience allowed him little sleep , and the next day was a long weariness of waiting . The evening he would have to spend at the hospital ; if there came no reply before the time of his leaving home , he knew not how he should compel himself to the ordinary routine of work . Yet the hour came , and he had heard nothing . He was tempted to go at once to Westbourne Park , but reason prevailed with him . When he again entered the house , having walked at his utmost speed from the City Road , the letter lay waiting for him ; it had been pushed beneath his door , and when he struck a match he found that one of his feet was upon the white envelope . Amy wrote that she would be at home at eleven to - morrow morning . Not another word . In all probability she knew of the offer that had been made to him ; Mrs. Carter would have told her . Was it of good or of ill omen that she wrote only these half - dozen words ? Half through the night he plagued himself with suppositions , now thinking that her brevity promised a welcome , now that she wished to warn him against expecting anything but a cold , offended demeanour . At seven he was dressed ; two hours and a half had to be killed before he could start on his walk westward . He would have wandered about the streets , but it rained . He had made himself as decent as possible in appearance , but he must necessarily seem an odd Sunday visitor at a house such as Mrs. Yule 's . His soft felt hat , never brushed for months , was a greyish green , and stained round the band with perspiration . His necktie was discoloured and worn . Coat and waistcoat might pass muster , but of the trousers the less said the better . One of his boots was patched , and both were all but heelless . Very well ; let her see him thus . Let her understand what it meant to live on twelve and sixpence a week . Though it was cold and wet he could not put on his overcoat . Three years ago it had been a fairly good ulster ; at present , the edges of the sleeves were frayed , two buttons were missing , and the original hue of the cloth was indeterminable . At half - past nine he set out and struggled with his shabby umbrella against wind and rain . Down Pentonville Hill , up Euston Road , all along Marylebone Road , then north - westwards towards the point of his destination . It was a good six miles from the one house to the other , but he arrived before the appointed time , and had to stray about until the cessation of bell - clanging and the striking of clocks told him it was eleven . Then he presented himself at the familiar door . On his asking for Mrs. Reardon , he was at once admitted and let up to the drawing - room ; the servant did not ask his name . Then he waited for a minute or two , feeling himself a squalid wretch amid the dainty furniture . The door opened . Amy , in a simple but very becoming dress , approached to within a yard of him ; after the first glance she had averted her eyes , and she did not offer to shake hands . He saw that his muddy and shapeless boots drew her attention . '
152014	152041	152007	152007	you	3083	' he asked . He meant the tone to be conciliatory , but he could not command his voice , and it sounded rough , hostile . '
152046	152068	152042	152042	I	0	' Amy answered , seating herself gracefully . She would have spoken with less dignity but for that accent of his . '
152075	152076	152069	152070	The Carters	275	' '
152085	152116	152079	152079	I	0	' There was no promise in her manner . She kept her face turned away , and Reardon saw its beautiful profile , hard and cold as though in marble . '

152140	152157	152158	152158	You	0	' He did not sit down , and was holding his rusty hat behind his back . '

152226	152643	152644	152644	I	0	' Reardon turned abruptly as if to leave her , but checked himself at a little distance . Both had come to this meeting prepared for a renewal of amity , but in these first few moments each was so disagreeably impressed by the look and language of the other that a revulsion of feeling undid all the more hopeful effects of their long severance . On entering , Amy had meant to offer her hand , but the unexpected meanness of Reardon 's aspect shocked and restrained her . All but every woman would have experienced that shrinking from the livery of poverty . Amy had but to reflect , and she understood that her husband could in no wise help this shabbiness ; when he parted from her his wardrobe was already in a long - suffering condition , and how was he to have purchased new garments since then ? None the less such attire degraded him in her eyes ; it symbolized the melancholy decline which he had suffered intellectually . On Reardon his wife 's elegance had the same repellent effect , though this would not have been the case but for the expression of her countenance . Had it been possible for them to remain together during the first five minutes without exchange of words , sympathies might have prevailed on both sides ; the first speech uttered would most likely have harmonized with their gentler thoughts . But the mischief was done so speedily . A man must indeed be graciously endowed if his personal apperance can defy the disadvantage of cheap modern clothing worn into shapelessness . Reardon had no such remarkable physique , and it was not wonderful that his wife felt ashamed of him . Strictly ashamed ; he seemed to her a social inferior ; the impression was so strong that it resisted all memory of his spiritual qualities . She might have anticipated this state of things , and have armed herself to encounter it , but somehow she had not done so . For more than five months she had been living among people who dressed well ; the contrast was too suddenly forced upon her . She was especially susceptible in such matters , and had become none the less so under the demoralizing influence of her misfortunes . True , she soon began to feel ashamed of her shame , but that could not annihilate the natural feeling and its results . '
152656	152747	152650	152650	I	0	' Thus she spoke to herself , with immutable decision . She had been doubtful till now , but all doubt was at an end . Had Reardon been practical man enough to procure by hook or by crook a decent suit of clothes for this interview , that ridiculous trifle might have made all the difference in what was to result . He turned again , and spoke with the harshness of a man who feels that he is despised , and is determined to show an equal contempt . '

152987	153033	152918	152918	I	0	' If you do n't , I shall understand you to mean that you refuse to come to me . You know the circumstances ; there is no reason why you should consult with anyone else . You can answer me immediately if you will . '
153034	153044	153045	153045	Amy	191	' I do n't wish to answer you immediately , '
153051	153068	153045	153045	Amy	191	' Then that decides it . When I leave you we are strangers to each other . '
153176	153184	153185	153185	she	3089	' If that is what you prefer , '
153188	153206	153185	153185	she	3089	' there must be a formal separation . I ca n't trust my future to your caprice . '
153207	153221	153185	153185	she	3089	' You mean it must be put into the hands of a lawyer . '
153222	153228	153185	153185	she	3089	' Yes , I do . '
153229	153239	153185	153185	she	3089	' That will be the best , no doubt . '
153240	153253	153185	153185	she	3089	' Very well ; I will speak with my friends about it . '
153254	153258	153259	153259	he	3088	' Your friends ! '
153263	153288	153259	153259	he	3088	' But for those friends of yours this would never have happened . I wish you had been alone in the world and penniless . '
153289	153298	153185	153185	she	3089	' A kind wish , all things considered . '
153299	153434	153185	153185	she	3089	' Yes , it is a kind wish . Then your marriage with me would have been binding ; you would have known that my lot was yours , and the knowledge would have helped yours , weakness . I begin to see how much right there is on the side of those people who would keep women in subjection . You have been allowed to act with independence , and the result is that you have ruined my life and debased your own . If I had been strong enough to treat you as a child , and bid you follow me wherever my own fortunes led , it would have been as much better for you as for me . I was weak , and I suffer as all weak people do . '
153435	153453	153185	153185	she	3089	' You think it was my duty to share such a home as you have at present ? '
153454	153503	153185	153185	she	3089	' You know it was . And if the choice had lain between that and earning your own livelihood you would have thought that even such a poor home might be made tolerable . There were possibilities in you of better things than will ever come out now . '
153549	153555	153556	153556	he	191	' Will you tell me , '
153561	153591	153556	153556	he	191	' how your position is regarded by these friends of yours ? I do n't mean your mother and brother , but the people who come to this house . '
153592	153603	153530	153530	He	191	' I have not asked such people for their opinion . '
153604	153631	153530	153530	He	191	' Still , I suppose some sort of explanation has been necessary in your intercourse with them . How have you represented your relations with me ? '
153632	153642	153556	153556	he	191	' I ca n't see that that concerns you . '
153643	153697	153530	153530	He	191	' In a manner it does . Certainly it matters very little to me how I am thought of by people of this kind , but one does n't like to be reviled without cause . Have you allowed it to be supposed that I have made life with me intolerable for you ? '
153698	153733	153530	153530	He	191	' No , I have not . You insult me by asking the question , but as you do n't seem to understand feelings of that kind I may as well answer you simply . '
153734	153755	153530	153530	He	191	' Then have you told them the truth ? That I became so poor you could n't live with me ? '
153756	153796	153530	153530	He	191	' I have never said that in so many words , but no doubt it is understood . It must be known also that you refused to take the step which might have helped you out of your difficulties . '
153797	153801	153802	153802	She	3096	' What step ? '
153819	153826	153827	153827	he	3097	' I had utterly forgotten it , '
153834	153846	153827	153827	he	3097	' That shows how ridiculous such a thing would have been . '
153847	153857	153858	153858	Amy	191	' You are doing no literary work at all ? '
153861	153879	153858	153858	Amy	191	' Do you imagine that I have the peace of mind necessary for anything of that sort ? '
153906	153923	153893	153894	her husband	833	' Do you think I am able to occupy myself with the affairs of imaginary people ? '
153924	153932	153858	153858	Amy	191	' I did n't necessarily mean fiction . '
153933	153976	153977	153977	She	3096	' That I can forget myself , then , in the study of literature ? — I wonder whether you really think of me like that . How , in Heaven 's name , do you suppose I spend my leisure time ? '
153982	153999	153977	153977	She	3096	' Do you think I take this calamity as light- heartedly as you do , Amy ? '
154000	154011	153977	153977	She	3096	' I am far from taking it light - heartedly . '
154012	154029	154030	154030	She	3096	' Yet you are in good health . I see no sign that you have suffered . '
154104	154113	154114	154114	he	3102	' And certainly I ca n't believe it , '
154117	154130	154114	154114	he	3102	' now you declare your wish to be formally separated from me . '
154131	154139	154114	154114	he	3102	' I have declared no such wish . '
154140	154171	154114	154114	he	3102	' Indeed you have . If you can hesitate a moment about returning to me when difficulties are at an end , that tells me you would prefer final separation . '
154172	154179	154180	154180	Amy	191	' I hesitate for this reason , '
154185	154211	154180	154180	Amy	191	' You are so very greatly changed from what you used to be , that I think it doubtful if I could live with you . '
154212	154239	154114	154114	he	3102	' Changed ? — Yes , that is true I am afraid . But how do you think this change will affect my behaviour to you ? '
154240	154250	154114	154114	he	3102	' Remember how you have been speaking to me . '
154251	154267	154114	154114	he	3102	' And you think I should treat you brutally if you came into my power ? '
154268	154308	154114	154114	he	3102	' Not brutally , in the ordinary sense of the word . But with faults of temper which I could n't bear . I have my own faults . I ca n't behave as meekly as some women can . '
154322	154341	154342	154342	he	191	' Did my faults of temper give you any trouble during the first year of our married life ? '
154346	154349	154350	154350	she	3103	' No , '
154353	154389	154350	154350	she	3103	' They began to afflict you when I was so hard driven by difficulties that I needed all your sympathy , all your forbearance . Did I receive much of either from you , Amy ? '
154390	154404	154114	154114	he	3102	' I think you did — until you demanded impossible things of me . '
154405	154479	154480	154480	He	3104	' It was always in your power to rule me . What pained me worst , and hardened me against you , was that I saw you did n't care to exert your influence . There was never a time when I could have resisted a word of yours spoken out of your love for me . But even then , I am afraid , you no longer loved me , and now — '
154490	154499	154502	154502	his	3104	' Have you any love for me left ? '
154530	154548	154517	154517	Amy	191	' Is there ever so small a hope that I might win some love from you again ? '
154549	154570	154114	154114	he	3102	' If you wish me to come and live with you when you go to Croydon I will do so . '
154571	154581	154480	154480	He	3104	' But that is not answering me , Amy . '
154582	154590	154517	154517	Amy	191	' It 's all I can say . '
154591	154615	154114	154114	he	3102	' Then you mean that you would sacrifice yourself out of — what ? Out of pity for me , let us say . '
154616	154624	154626	154626	Amy	191	' Do you wish to see Willie ? '
154632	154704	154626	154626	Amy	191	' No . It is you I have come to see . The child is nothing to me , compared with you . It is you , who loved me , who became my wife — you only I care about . Tell me you will try to be as you used to be . Give me only that hope , Amy ; I will ask nothing except that , now . '
154705	154723	154792	154792	Amy	191	' I ca n't say anything except that I will come to Croydon if you wish it . '
154724	154757	154758	154758	Her	3106	' And reproach me always because you have to live in such a place , away from your friends , without a hope of the social success which was your dearest ambition ? '
154784	154790	154792	154792	Amy	191	' What is the good ? '

155493	155582	155488	155488	he	194	' that the fellow only does his bare duty in sending it . What is it to anyone else whether he lives on twelve shillings a week or twelve pence ? It is his business to support his wife ; if he ca n't do that , to contribute as much to her support as possible . Amy 's scruples are all very fine , if she could afford them ; it 's very nice to pay for your delicacies of feeling out of other people 's pockets . '

155683	155733	155623	155624	Mrs. Yule	208	' I shall have to live as well as I can on the seventy - five pounds a year . If you ca n't afford to let me stay with you for that , I must go into cheap lodgings in the country , like poor Mrs. Butcher did . '
155782	155803	155805	155805	Amy	191	' I would rather spend the rest of my days in the workhouse than beg him to take me back , '

156440	156462	156425	156425	Amy	191	' If Uncle Alfred receives nothing at all , and mother has nothing , you ought to think yourself very lucky . '
156463	156479	156425	156425	Amy	191	' It 's very easy for you to say that , with your ten thousand . '
156480	156487	156489	156490	Mrs. Yule	208	' But is it her own ? '
156492	156500	156489	156490	Mrs. Yule	208	' Is it for her separate use ? '
156501	156542	156425	156425	Amy	191	' Of course it is . She gets the benefit of last year 's Married Woman 's Property Act . The will was executed in January this year , and I dare say the old curmudgeon destroyed a former one . '
156543	156553	156555	156555	Amy	191	' What a splendid Act of Parliament that is ! '
156557	156568	156555	156555	Amy	191	'The only one worth anything that I ever heard of . '

156658	156663	156616	156616	you	424	' growled her brother . 'What

156709	156714	156700	156700	Marian	211	' said Mrs. Yule . 'Who

156862	156901	156846	156846	she	208	' — in which case Amy would never have dreamt of wedding a penniless author . Amy declined to discuss the new aspect of things until twenty - four hours after John 's return ; then she said : '
156926	156927	156921	156921	I	0	' '
156936	156941	156928	156928	You	191	' opined Mrs. Yule . '

156981	157313	156964	156964	you	191	' She said so , but the sudden happiness of finding herself wealthy was not without its softening effect on Amy 's feelings . Generous impulses alternated with moods of discontent . The thought of her husband in his squalid lodgings tempted her to forget injuries and disillusions , and to play the part of a generous wife . It would be possible now for them to go abroad and spend a year or two in healthful travel ; the result in Reardon 's case might be wonderful . He might recover all the energy of his imagination , and resume his literary career from the point he had reached at the time of his marriage . On the other hand , was it not more likely that he would lapse into a life of scholarly self - indulgence , such as he had often told her was his ideal ? In that event , what tedium and regret lay before her ! Ten thousand pounds sounded well , but what did it represent in reality ? A poor four hundred a year , perhaps ; mere decency of obscure existence , unless her husband could glorify it by winning fame . If he did nothing , she would be the wife of a man who had failed in literature . She would not be able to take a place in society . Life would be supported without struggle ; nothing more to be hoped . This view of the future possessed her strongly when , on the second day , she went to communicate her news to Mrs. Carter . This amiable lady had now become what she always desired to be , Amy 's intimate friend ; they saw each other very frequently , and conversed of most things with much frankness . It was between eleven and twelve in the morning when Amy paid her visit , and she found Mrs. Carter on the point of going out . '

Had she been left to her instincts , Edith would have surrounded herself with objects representing a much earlier stage of artistic development ; but she was quick to imitate what fashion declared becoming . Her husband regarded her as a remarkable authority in all matters of personal or domestic ornamentation . '
157485	157517	157480	157480	you	3161	' she inquired , examining Amy from head to foot , as if she thought that the inheritance of so substantial a sum must have produced visible changes in her friend . '

157589	157606	157529	157529	you	3161	' I suppose it would lead to all sorts of troubles — do n't you think ? '
157607	157700	157701	157701	Edith	276	' So people say about every new step in civilisation . What would have been thought twenty years ago of a proposal to make all married women independent of their husbands in money matters ? All sorts of absurd dangers were foreseen , no doubt . And it 's the same now about divorce . In America people can get divorced if they do n't suit each other — at all events in some of the States — and does any harm come of it ? Just the opposite I should think . '

157907	157940	157904	157904	she	3171	' It 's because women who are happily married ca n't and wo n't understand the position of those who are not that there 's so much difficulty in reforming marriage laws . '

Why do n't people write about the really important things of life ? Some of the French novelists do ; several of Balzac 's , for instance . I have just been reading his " Cousin Pons , " a terrible book , but I enjoyed it ever so much because it was nothing like a love story . What rubbish is printed about love ! '

158585	159241	158569	158569	You	0	' Since the parting from her husband , there had proceeded in Amy a noticeable maturing of intellect . Probably the one thing was a consequence of the other . During that last year in the flat her mind was held captive by material cares , and this arrest of her natural development doubtless had much to do with the appearance of acerbity in a character which had displayed so much sweetness , so much womanly grace . Moreover , it was arrest at a critical point . When she fell in love with Edwin Reardon her mind had still to undergo the culture of circumstances ; though a woman in years she had seen nothing of life but a few phases of artificial society , and her education had not progressed beyond the final school - girl stage . Submitting herself to Reardon 's influence , she passed through what was a highly useful training of the intellect ; but with the result that she became clearly conscious of the divergence between herself and her husband . In endeavouring to imbue her with his own literary tastes , Reardon instructed Amy as to the natural tendencies of her mind , which till then she had not clearly understood . When she ceased to read with the eyes of passion , most of the things which were Reardon 's supreme interests lost their value for her . A sound intelligence enabled her to think and feel in many directions , but the special line of her growth lay apart from that in which the novelist and classical scholar had directed her . When she found herself alone and independent , her mind acted like a spring when pressure is removed . After a few weeks of désoeuvrement she obeyed the impulse to occupy herself with a kind of reading alien to Reardon 's sympathies . The solid periodicals attracted her , and especially those articles which dealt with themes of social science . Anything that savoured of newness and boldness in philosophic thought had a charm for her palate . She read a good deal of that kind of literature which may be defined as specialism popularised ; writing which addresses itself to educated , but not strictly studious , persons , and which forms the reservoir of conversation for society above the sphere of turf and west - endism . Thus , for instance , though she could not undertake the volumes of Herbert Spencer , she was intelligently acquainted with the tenor of their contents ; and though she had never opened one of Darwin 's books , her knowledge of his main theories and illustrations was respectable . She was becoming a typical woman of the new time , the woman who has developed concurrently with journalistic enterprise . Not many days after that conversation with Edith Carter , she had occasion to visit Mudie 's , for the new number of some periodical which contained an appetising title . As it was a sunny and warm day she walked to New Oxford Street from the nearest Metropolitan station . Whilst waiting at the library counter , she heard a familiar voice in her proximity ; it was that of Jasper Milvain , who stood talking with a middle - aged lady . As Amy turned to look at him his eye met hers ; clearly he had been aware of her . The review she desired was handed to her ; she moved aside , and turned over the pages . Then Milvain walked up . He was armed cap - à - pie in the fashions of suave society ; no Bohemianism of garb or person , for Jasper knew he could not afford that kind of economy . On her part , Amy was much better dressed than usual , a costume suited to her position of bereaved heiress . '

160135	160159	160128	160128	Amy	191	'I imagined that you would n't marry for years , and then some distinguished person . This throws new light upon your character . '
160160	160172	159971	159971	They	3197	' You thought me so desperately scheming and cold - blooded ? '
160173	160213	159971	159971	They	3197	' Oh dear no ! But — well , to be sure , I ca n't say that I know Marian . I have n't seen her for years and years . She may be admirably suited to you . '
160214	160223	160128	160128	Amy	191	' Depend upon it , I think so . '
160224	160245	159971	159971	They	3197	' She 's likely to shine in society ? She is a brilliant girl , full of tact and insight ? '
160246	160253	160254	160254	He	3199	' Scarcely all that , perhaps . '
160261	160270	160271	160271	Amy	191	' Then you have abandoned your old ambitions ? '
160274	160290	160271	160271	Amy	191	' Not a bit of it . I am on the way to achieve them . '
160291	160302	160128	160128	Amy	191	' And Marian is the ideal wife to assist you ? '
160303	160320	160128	160128	Amy	191	' From one point of view , yes . Pray , why all this ironic questioning ? '
160321	160327	159971	159971	They	3197	' Not ironic at all . '
160328	160350	160128	160128	Amy	191	' It sounded very much like it , and I know from of old that you have a tendency that way . '
160351	160374	160128	160128	Amy	191	' The news surprised me a little , I confess . But I see that I am in danger of offending you . '
160375	160420	159971	159971	They	3197	' Let us wait another five years , and then I will ask your opinion as to the success of my mariage . I do n't take a step of this kind without maturely considering it . Have I made many blunders as yet ? '
160421	160431	159971	159971	They	3197	' As yet , not that I know of . '
160432	160444	160128	160128	Amy	191	' Do I impress you as one likely to commit follies ? '
160445	160456	159971	159971	They	3197	' I had rather wait a little before answering that . '
160457	160478	159971	159971	They	3197	' That is to say , you prefer to prophesy after the event . Very well , we shall see . '
160516	160525	160527	160527	Amy	191	' You are still at the same lodgings ? '
160538	160561	160527	160527	Amy	191	' I moved yesterday , so that the girls and I could be under the same roof — until the next change . '
160562	160573	160574	160574	He	3203	' You will let us know when that takes place ? '
160687	160701	160703	160704	the sufferer	3208	' It would n't be very nice to die here , would it ? '
160717	160857	160703	160704	the sufferer	3208	' One would like a comfortable room , at least . Why , I do n't know . I dreamt last night that I was in a ship that had struck something and was going down ; and it was n't the thought of death that most disturbed me , but a horror of being plunged in the icy water . In fact , I have had just the same feeling on shipboard . I remember waking up midway between Corfu and Brindisi , on that shaky tub of a Greek boat ; we were rolling a good deal , and I heard a sort of alarmed rush and shouting up on deck . It was so warm and comfortable in the berth , and I thought with intolerable horror of the possibility of sousing into the black depths . '
160858	160866	160868	160868	Biffen	235	' Do n't talk , my boy , '
160870	160890	160703	160704	the sufferer	3208	'Let me read you the new chapter of " Mr. Bailey . " It may induce a refreshing slumber . '
161115	161131	161132	161132	he	191	' I have been as nearly as possible a happy man all to - day , '
161142	161177	161132	161132	he	191	'Partly the sunshine , I suppose . There 's no saying if the mood will last , but if it does all is well with me . I regret nothing and wish for nothing . '
161178	161185	161187	161187	Biffen	235	' A morbid state of mind , '
161191	161260	161187	161187	Biffen	235	' No doubt of that , but I am content to be indebted to morbidness . One must have a rest from misery somehow . Another kind of man would have taken to drinking ; that has tempted me now and then , I assure you . But I could n't afford it . Did you ever feel tempted to drink merely for the sake of forgetting trouble ? '
161261	161295	161132	161132	he	191	' Often enough . I have done it . I have deliberately spent a certain proportion of the money that ought to have gone for food in the cheapest kind of strong liquor . '
161296	161317	161187	161187	Biffen	235	' Ha ! that 's interesting . But it never got the force of a habit you had to break ? '
161318	161339	161187	161187	Biffen	235	' No . Partly , I dare say , because I had the warning of poor Sykes before my eyes . '
161340	161348	161132	161132	he	191	' You never see that poor fellow ? '
161349	161371	161187	161187	Biffen	235	' Never . He must be dead , I think . He would die either in the hospital or the workhouse . '

161611	161699	161604	161604	She	3224	'm unfortunate , sir . " I could n't help looking up at her in surprise ; I had taken it for granted she was a dressmaker or something of the kind . And , do you know , I never felt so strong an impulse to shake hands , to show sympathy , and even respect , in some way . I should have liked to say , " Why , I am unfortunate , too !

163035	163067	163213	163213	It	3263	' It 's kind of you to encourage me ; but if " Mr. Bailey " is ever sold I do n't mind undertaking to eat my duplicate of the proofs . '
163068	163100	163213	163213	It	3263	' But now , you remember what led me to that . What does a man care for any woman on earth when he is absorbed in contemplation of that kind ? '
163101	163112	163213	163213	It	3263	' But it is only one of life 's satisfactions . '
163113	163186	163213	163213	It	3263	' I am only maintaining that it is the best , and infinitely preferable to sexual emotion . It leaves , no doubt , no bitterness of any kind . Poverty ca n't rob me of those memories . I have lived in an ideal world that was not deceitful , a world which seems to me , when I recall it , beyond the human sphere , bathed in diviner light . '
163356	163370	163371	163371	she	4458	' I doubted whether you would see me if I let you know , '
163374	163398	163371	163371	she	4458	' Forgive me this little bit of scheming , will you ? I have something so very important to speak to you about . '
163410	163420	163421	163422	Mrs. Yule	208	' I think you have n't heard from Amy ? '
163425	163432	163421	163422	Mrs. Yule	208	' Not since I saw her . '
163433	163445	163371	163371	she	4458	' And you do n't know what has come to pass ? '
163446	163453	163421	163422	Mrs. Yule	208	' I have heard of nothing . '
163454	163523	163421	163422	Mrs. Yule	208	' I am come to see you quite on my own responsibility , quite . I took Mr. Carter into my confidence , but begged him not to let Mrs. Carter know , lest she should tell Amy ; I think he will keep his promise . It seemed to me that it was really my duty to do whatever I could in these sad , sad circumstances . '
163534	163564	163524	163524	Reardon	191	' I had better tell you at once that Amy 's uncle at Wattleborough is dead , and that in his will he has bequeathed her ten thousand pounds . '
163595	163606	163607	163607	he	191	' I am glad to hear of her good fortune , '
163615	163624	163607	163607	he	191	' You will feel , I am sure , '

163757	163833	163756	163756	I	0	'm sure you wo n't be offended , Edwin , if I say that you have very much the same failing . Between two such sensitive people differences might last a lifetime , unless one could be persuaded to take the first step . Do be generous ! A woman is privileged to be a little obstinate , it is always said . Overlook the fault , and persuade her to let bygones be bygones . '
163882	163896	163897	163897	he	195	' Under no circumstances could I do more than I already have done , '
163900	163924	163897	163897	he	195	'And after what you have told me , it is impossible for me to go and see her unless she expressly invites me . '
163925	163936	163840	163841	Mrs. Yule	208	' Oh , if only you would overcome this sensitiveness ! '
163937	163990	163897	163897	he	195	' It is not in my power to do so . My poverty , as you justly say , was the cause of our parting ; but if Amy is no longer poor , that is very far from a reason why I should go to her as a suppliant for forgiveness . '
163991	164072	163897	163897	he	195	' But do consider the facts of the case , independently of feeling . I really think I do n't go too far in saying that at least some — some provocation was given by you first of all . I am so very , very far from wishing to say anything disagreeable — I am sure you feel that — but was n't there some little ground for complaint on Amy 's part ? Was n't there , now ? '
164110	164121	164122	164122	he	191	' There may have been ground for grief and concern , '
164133	164134	164122	164122	he	191	' '

164382	164536	164537	164537	You	3276	' Reardon lingered a little after her departure , then left the hospital and walked at a rapid pace in no particular direction . Ah ! if this had happened in the first year of his marriage , what more blessed man than he would have walked the earth ! But it came after irreparable harm . No amount of wealth could undo the ruin caused by poverty . It was natural for him , as soon as he could think with deliberation , to turn towards his only friend . But on calling at the house in Clipstone Street he found the garret empty , and no one could tell him when its occupant was likely to be back . He left a note , and made his way back to Islington . The evening had to be spent at the hospital , but on his return Biffen sat waiting for him . '
164546	164551	164537	164537	You	3276	' the visitor inquired . '
164556	164557	164537	164537	You	3276	' '
164722	164764	164891	164892	The other	1606	' Reardon laughed gaily , and made inquiries about the eccentric gentleman . Only when the subject was exhausted did he speak of his own concerns , relating quietly what he had learnt from Mrs. Yule . Biffen 's eyes widened . '
164767	164820	164891	164892	The other	1606	' Reardon cried with exultation,'there is the last burden off my mind ! Henceforth I have n't a care ! The only thing that still troubled me was my inability to give Amy enough to live upon . Now she is provided for in secula seculorum . Is n't this grand news ? '
164821	164835	164891	164892	The other	1606	' Decidedly . But if she is provided for , so are you . '
164836	164890	164891	164892	The other	1606	' Biffen , you know me better . Could I accept a farthing of her money ? This has made our coming together again for ever impossible , unless — unless dead things can come to life . I know the value of money , but I ca n't take it from Amy . '
164896	164971	164891	164892	The other	1606	' No ! But now everything is well . She has her child , and can devote herself to bringing the boy up . And I — but I shall be rich on my own account . A hundred and fifty a year ; it would be a farce to offer Amy her share of it . By all the gods of Olympus , we will go to Greece together , you and I ! '
164972	164975	164891	164892	The other	1606	' Pooh ! '
164976	165064	164891	164892	The other	1606	' I swear it ! Let me save for a couple of years , and then get a good month 's holiday , or more if possible , and , as Pallas Athene liveth ! we shall find ourselves at Marseilles , going aboard some boat of the Messageries . I ca n't believe yet that this is true . Come , we will have a supper to - night . Come out into Upper Street , and let us eat , drink , and be merry ! '
165065	165087	164891	164892	The other	1606	' You are beside yourself . But never mind ; let us rejoice by all means . There 's every reason . '
165088	165104	164891	164892	The other	1606	' That poor girl ! Now , at last , she 'll be at ease . '
165105	165108	164891	164892	The other	1606	' Who ? '

165306	165416	165254	165254	Gods	347	' said Biffen . On leaving the house they found themselves in a thick fog , through which trickled drops of warm rain . Nevertheless , they pursued their purpose , and presently were seated in one of the boxes of a small coffee - shop . Their only companion in the place was a cab - driver , who had just finished a meal , and was now nodding into slumber over his plate and cup . Reardon ordered fried ham and eggs , the luxury of the poor , and when the attendant woman was gone away to execute the order , he burst into excited laughter . '
165432	165446	165451	165451	they	3285	' He named two or three of the successful novelists of the day . '

Then Biffen drew from the pocket of his venerable overcoat the volume of Euripides he had brought , and their talk turned once more to the land of the sun . Only when the coffee - shop was closed did they go forth again into the foggy street , and at the top of Pentonville Hill they stood for ten minutes debating a metrical effect in one of the Fragments . Day after day Reardon went about with a fever upon him . By evening his pulse was always rapid , and no extremity of weariness brought him a refreshing sleep . In conversation he seemed either depressed or excited , more often the latter . Save when attending to his duties at the hospital , he made no pretence of employing himself ; if at home , he sat for hours without opening a book , and his walks , excepting when they led him to Clipstone Street , were aimless . The hours of postal delivery found him waiting in an anguish of suspense . At eight o'clock each morning he stood by his window , listening for the postman 's knock in the street . As it approached he went out to the head of the stairs , and if the knock sounded at the door of his house , he leaned over the banisters , trembling in expectation . But the letter was never for him . When his agitation had subsided he felt glad of the disappointment , and laughed and sang . One day Carter appeared at the City Road establishment , and made an opportunity of speaking to his clerk in private . '
166043	166050	166040	166040	I	0	' he said with a smile , '

Wandering in the city , about this time , Reardon encountered his friend the realist . '

166213	166657	166659	166659	you	3301	' They repaired to the haunt in question . A flight of stairs brought them to a small room in which were exposed the daily newspapers ; another ascent , and they were in a room devoted to magazines , chess , and refreshments ; yet another , and they reached the department of weekly publications ; lastly , at the top of the house , they found a lavatory , and a chamber for the use of those who desired to write . The walls of this last retreat were of blue plaster and sloped inwards from the floor ; along them stood school desks with benches , and in one place was suspended a ragged and dirty card announcing that paper and envelopes could be purchased downstairs . An enormous basket full of waste - paper , and a small stove , occupied two corners ; ink blotches , satirical designs , and much scribbling in pen and pencil served for mural adornment . From the adjacent lavatory came sounds of splashing and spluttering , and the busy street far below sent up its confused noises . Two persons only sat at the desks . One was a hunger - bitten , out - of - work clerk , evidently engaged in replying to advertisements ; in front of him lay two or three finished letters , and on the ground at his feet were several crumpled sheets of note - paper , representing abortive essays in composition . The other man , also occupied with the pen , looked about forty years old , and was clad in a very rusty suit of tweeds ; on the bench beside him lay a grey overcoat and a silk hat which had for some time been moulting . His face declared the habit to which he was a victim , but it had nothing repulsive in its lineaments and expression ; on the contrary , it was pleasing , amiable , and rather quaint . At this moment no one would have doubted his sobriety . With coat - sleeve turned back , so as to give free play to his right hand and wrist , revealing meanwhile a flannel shirt of singular colour , and with his collar unbuttoned ( he wore no tie ) to leave his throat at ease as he bent myopically over the paper , he was writing at express speed , evidently in the full rush of the ardour of composition . The veins of his forehead were dilated , and his chin pushed forward in a way that made one think of a racing horse . '

He had turned back his coat sleeve , had buttoned his collar , and was eyeing the slips of completed manuscript . Biffen presented his companion , and Mr. Sykes greeted the novelist with much geniality . '

166909	167259	166901	166901	he	0	' Most people will take it for fiction . I wish I had inventive power enough to write fiction anything like it . I have published novels , Mr. Reardon , but my experience in that branch of literature was peculiar — as I may say it has been in most others to which I have applied myself . My first stories were written for The Young Lady 's Favourite , and most remarkable productions they were , I promise you . That was fifteen years ago , in the days of my versatility . I could throw off my supplemental novelette of fifteen thousand words without turning a hair , and immediately after it fall to , fresh as a daisy , on the " Illustrated History of the United States , " which I was then doing for Edward Coghlan . But presently I thought myself too good for the Favourite ; in an evil day I began to write three - volume novels , aiming at reputation . It would n't do . I persevered for five years , and made about five failures . Then I went back to Bowring . " Take me on again , old man , will you ? " Bowring was a man of few words ; he said , " Blaze away , my boy . " And I tried to . But it was no use ; I had got out of the style ; my writing was too literary by a long chalk . For a whole year I deliberately strove to write badly , but Bowring was so pained with the feebleness of my efforts that at last he sternly bade me avoid his sight . " What the devil , " he roared one day , " do you mean by sending me stories about men and women ? You ought to know better than that , a fellow of your experience ! " So I had to give it up , and there was an end of my career as a writer of fiction . '

167273	167403	167270	167270	he	3306	' when I first made his acquaintance , had an idea of writing for the working classes ; and what do you think he was going to offer them ? Stories about the working classes ! Nay , never hang your head for it , old boy ; it was excusable in the days of your youth . Why , Mr. Reardon , as no doubt you know well enough , nothing can induce working men or women to read stories that treat of their own world . They are the most consumed idealists in creation , especially the women . Again and again work - girls have said to me : " Oh , I do n't like that book ; it 's nothing but real life . " '
167404	167414	167416	167416	Reardon	195	' It 's the fault of women in general , '
167418	167462	167416	167416	Reardon	195	' So it is , but it comes out with delicious naïveté in the working classes . Now , educated people like to read of scenes that are familiar to them , though I grant you that the picture must be idealised if you 're

167626	167648	167624	167624	Biffen	235	' Poor fellow ! Pity he ever earns anything at all . The workhouse would be better , I should think . '
167649	167683	167583	167583	I	0	' No , no ! Let a man drink himself to death rather . I have a horror of the workhouse . Remember the clock at Marylebone I used to tell you about . '
167684	167741	167624	167624	Biffen	235	' Unphilosophic . I do n't think I should be unhappy in the workhouse . I should have a certain satisfaction in the thought that I had forced society to support me . And then the absolute freedom from care ! Why , it 's very much the same as being a man of independent fortune . '
167841	167844	167839	167839	Amy	191	' Dear Edwin '
167856	167913	167839	167839	Amy	191	' You must , of course , have heard [ she wrote ] that my uncle John has left me ten thousand pounds . It has not yet come into my possession , and I had decided that I would not write to you till that happened , but perhaps you may altogether misunderstand my silence . '
168033	168129	168018	168018	I	0	' I said at our last meeting that I should be quite prepared to return to you if you took that position at Croydon . There is now no need for you to pursue a kind of work for which you are quite unfitted , and I repeat that I am willing to live with you as before . If you will tell me where you would like to make a new home I shall gladly agree . I do not think you would care to leave London permanently , and certainly I should not . '
168185	168189	168190	168191	Amy Reardon	191	' Yours always , '
168193	168259	168190	168191	Amy Reardon	191	' The letter fell from his hand . It was such a letter as he might have expected , but the beginning misled him , and as his agitation throbbed itself away he suffered an encroachment of despair which made him for a time unable to move or even think . His reply , written by the dreary twilight which represented sunset , ran thus : '
168307	168371	168300	168300	you	353	' The only one thing that I wished was , that by some miracle your love for me might be revived . Can I persuade myself that this is the letter of a wife who desires to return to me because in her heart she loves me ? If that is the truth you have been most unfortunate in trying to express yourself . '
168465	168561	168602	168602	You	3318	' I can not share your wealth , dear . But as you have no longer need of my help — as we are now quite independent of each other — I shall cease to send the money which hitherto I have considered yours . In this way I shall have enough , and more than enough , for my necessities , so that you will never have to trouble yourself with the thought that I am suffering privations . At Christmas I go to Croydon , and I will then write to you again . '
168663	168713	168714	168715	Edwin Reardon	195	' No other reply than this is possible , so I beg you not to write in this way again . Let me know if you go to live elsewhere . I hope Willie is well , and that his growth is still a delight and happiness to you . '
168717	168721	168714	168715	Edwin Reardon	195	' That one word '
168724	169064	168714	168715	Edwin Reardon	195	' occurring in the middle of the letter , gave him pause as he read the lines over . Should he not obliterate it , and even in such a way that Amy might see what he had done ? His pen was dipped in the ink for that purpose , but after all he held his hand . Amy was still dear to him , say what he might , and if she noted the word — if she pondered over it — A street gas - lamp prevented the room from becoming absolutely dark . When he had closed the envelope he lay down on his bed again , and watched the flickering yellowness upon the ceiling . He ought to have some tea before going to the hospital , but he cared so little for it that the trouble of boiling water was too great . The flickering light grew fainter ; he understood at length that this was caused by fog that had begun to descend . The fog was his enemy ; it would be wise to purchase a respirator if this hideous weather continued , for sometimes his throat burned , and there was a rasping in his chest which gave disagreeable admonition . He fell asleep for half an hour , and on awaking he was feverish , as usual at this time of day . Well , it was time to go to his work . Ugh ! That first mouthful of fog ! The rooms which Milvain had taken for himself and his sisters were modest , but more expensive than their old quarters . As the change was on his account he held himself responsible for the extra outlay . But for his immediate prospects this step would have been unwarrantable , as his earnings were only just sufficient for his needs on the previous footing . He had resolved that his marriage must take place before Christmas ; till that event he would draw when necessary upon the girls '
169078	169090	169092	169092	Dora	188	' And what are we to do when you are married ? '
169119	169296	169117	169118	the girls	420	' sitting - room , and it was a moment for frank conversation . Dora rejoiced in the coming marriage ; her brother had behaved honourably , and Marian , she trusted , would be very happy , notwithstanding disagreement with her father , which seemed inevitable . Maud was by no means so well pleased , though she endeavoured to wear smiles . It looked to her as if Jasper had been guilty of a kind of weakness not to be expected in him . Marian , as an individual , could not be considered an appropriate wife for such a man with such a future ; and as for her five thousand pounds , that was ridiculous . Had it been ten — something can be made of ten thousand ; but a paltry five ! Maud 's ideas on such subjects had notably expanded of late , and one of the results was that she did not live so harmoniously with her sister as for the first few months of their London career . '
169307	169330	169297	169297	I	0	' replied Jasper to the younger girl 's question . He stood with his back to the fire and smoked a cigarette . '

169406	169410	169404	169404	Jasper	186	' said Maud , '

169576	169658	169557	169557	I	0	' Tis the way of the world . I shall belong to a club ; I shall give nice , quiet little dinners to selected people ; I shall let it be understood by all and sundry that I have a social position . Thenceforth I am quite a different man , a man to be taken into account . And what will you bet me that I do n't stand in the foremost rank of literary reputabilities ten years hence ? '
169659	169675	169757	169757	his	3332	' I doubt whether six or seven hundred a year will be enough for this . '
169676	169728	169757	169757	his	3332	' If not , I am prepared to spend a thousand . Bless my soul ! As if two or three years would n't suffice to draw out the mean qualities in the kind of people I am thinking of ! I say ten , to leave myself a great margin . '
169729	169734	169557	169557	I	0	' Marian approves this ? '
169735	169752	169753	169754	The girls	420	' I have n't distinctly spoken of it . But she approves whatever I think good . '
169763	169778	169753	169754	The girls	420	' And let us just suppose that you are so unfortunate as to fail ? '
169779	169998	169999	169999	He	3333	' There 's no supposing it , unless , of course , I lose my health . I am not presuming on any wonderful development of powers . Such as I am now , I need only to be put on the little pedestal of a decent independence and plenty of people will point fingers of admiration at me . You do n't fully appreciate this . Mind , it would n't do if I had no qualities . I have the qualities ; they only need bringing into prominence . If I am an unknown man , and publish a wonderful book , it will make its way very slowly , or not at all . If I , become a known man , publish that very same book , its praise will echo over both hemispheres . I should be within the truth if I had said " a vastly inferior book , " but I am in a bland mood at present . Suppose poor Reardon 's novels had been published in the full light of reputation instead of in the struggling dawn which was never to become day , would n't they have been magnified by every critic ? You have to become famous before you can secure the attention which would give fame . '
170013	170203	170204	170204	He	3334	' You have to obtain reputation before you can get a fair hearing for that which would justify your repute . It 's the old story of the French publisher who said to Dumas : " Make a name , and I 'll publish anything you write . " " But how the diable , " cries the author , " am I to make a name if I ca n't get published ? " If a man ca n't hit upon any other way of attracting attention , let him dance on his head in the middle of the street ; after that he may hope to get consideration for his volume of poems . I am speaking of men who wish to win reputation before they are toothless . Of course if your work is strong , and you can afford to wait , the probability is that half a dozen people will at last begin to shout that you have been monstrously neglected , as you have . But that happens when you are hoary and sapless , and when nothing under the sun delights you . '
170210	170325	170204	170204	He	3334	' Now I , my dear girls , am not a man who can afford to wait . First of all , my qualities are not of the kind which demand the recognition of posterity . My writing is for to - day , most distinctly hodiernal . It has no value save in reference to to - day . The question is : How can I get the eyes of men fixed upon me ? The answer : By pretending I am quite independent of their gaze . I shall succeed , without any kind of doubt ; and then I 'll have a medal struck to celebrate the day of my marriage . '
170376	170673	170375	170375	lovers	3336	' dialogue had revealed to him more of Marian 's heart and mind . Undeniably he was in love . Not passionately , not with the consuming desire which makes every motive seem paltry compared with its own satisfaction ; but still quite sufficiently in love to have a great difficulty in pursuing his daily tasks . This did not still the voice which bade him remember all the opportunities and hopes he was throwing aside . Since the plighting of troth with Marian he had been over to Wimbledon , to the house of his friend and patron Mr. Horace Barlow , and there he had again met with Miss Rupert . This lady had no power whatever over his emotions , but he felt assured that she regarded him with strong interest . When he imagined the possibility of contracting a marriage with Miss Rupert , who would make him at once a man of solid means , his head drooped , and he wondered at his precipitation . It had to be confessed that he was the victim of a vulgar weakness . He had declared himself not of the first order of progressive men . The conversation with Amy Reardon did not tend to put his mind at rest . Amy was astonished at so indiscreet a step in a man of his calibre . Ah ! if only Amy herself were free , with her ten thousand pounds to dispose of ! She , he felt sure , did not view him with indifference . Was there not a touch of pique in the elaborate irony with which she had spoken of his choice ? — But it was idle to look in that direction . He was anxious on his sisters '

170782	170805	170779	170779	he	186	' Do you , by chance , know how much Maud gave for that new jacket in which I saw her yesterday ? '
170812	170822	170806	170806	Dora	188	' I do n't think it was very much . '
170823	170856	170779	170779	he	186	' That is to say , it did n't cost twenty guineas . Well , I hope not . I notice , too , that she has been purchasing a new hat . '
170857	170870	170779	170779	he	186	' Oh , that was very inexpensive . She trimmed it herself . '
170871	170889	170806	170806	Dora	188	' Did she ? Is there any particular , any quite special , reason for this expenditure ? '
170890	170899	170779	170779	he	186	' I really ca n't say , Jasper . '
170900	170919	170779	170779	he	186	' That 's ambiguous , you know . Perhaps it means you wo n't allow yourself to say ? '
170920	170934	170935	170935	He	186	' No , Maud does n't tell me about things of that kind . '

It was rather an unfortunate choice of yours . Very much better if you could have got on a good footing with the Barnabys . If you are generally looked upon as belonging to the Lanes '
171490	171585	171586	171586	I	0	' Maud was not to be drawn into argument , and Jasper could only hope that his words would have some weight with her . The Mr. Dolomore in question was a young man of rather offensive type — athletic , dandiacal , and half - educated . It astonished Jasper that his sister could tolerate such an empty creature for a moment ; who has not felt the like surprise with regard to women 's inclinations ? He talked with Dora about it , but she was not in her sister 's confidence . '

He could not work so persistently as usual , and with wise tactics he used the seasons of enforced leisure to extend his acquaintance . Marian and he were together twice a week , in the evening . Of his old Bohemian associates he kept up intimate relations with one only , and that was Whelpdale . This was in a measure obligatory , for Whelpdale frequently came to see him , and it would have been difficult to repel a man who was always making known how highly he esteemed the privilege of Milvain 's friendship , and whose company on the whole was agreeable enough . At the present juncture Whelpdale 's cheery flattery was a distinct assistance ; it helped to support Jasper in his self - confidence , and to keep the brightest complexion on the prospect to which he had committed himself .

Jasper 's room was to be the scene of the assembly , and punctual to the minute the literary adviser appeared . He was dressed with all the finish his wardrobe allowed , and his face beamed with gratification ; it was rapture to him to enter the presence of these three girls , one of whom he had , more suo , held in romantic remembrance since his one meeting with her at Jasper 's old lodgings . His eyes melted with tenderness as he approached Dora and saw her smile of gracious recognition . By Maud he was profoundly impressed . Marian inspired him with no awe , but he fully appreciated the charm of her features and her modest gravity . After all , it was to Dora that his eyes turned again most naturally . He thought her exquisite , and , rather than be long without a glimpse of her , he contented himself with fixing his eyes on the hem of her dress and the boot - toe that occasionally peeped from beneath it . As was to be expected in such a circle , conversation soon turned to the subject of literary struggles . '

I was making strenuous efforts to write for magazines , with absolutely no encouragement . As everybody was talking just then of the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia , I conceived the brilliant idea of crossing the Atlantic , in the hope that I might find valuable literary material at the Exhibition — or Exposition , as they called it — and elsewhere . I wo n't trouble you with an account of how I lived whilst I still had money ; sufficient that no one would accept the articles I sent to England , and that at last I got into perilous straits . I went to New York , and thought of returning home , but the spirit of adventure was strong in me . " I 'll go West , " I said to myself . " There I am bound to find material . " And go I did , taking an emigrant ticket to Chicago . It was December , and I should like you to imagine what a journey of a thousand miles by an emigrant train meant at that season . The cars were deadly cold , and what with that and the hardness of the seats I found it impossible to sleep ; it reminded me of tortures I had read about ; I thought my brain would have burst with the need of sleeping . At Cleveland , in Ohio , we had to wait several hours in the night ; I left the station and wandered about till I found myself on the edge of a great cliff that looked over Lake Erie . A magnificent picture ! Brilliant moonlight , and all the lake away to the horizon frozen and covered with snow . The clocks struck two as I stood there . '

172732	172741	172730	172730	Dora	188	' Mr. Whelpdale makes one feel quite chilly . '
172760	172968	172969	172969	He	3360	' I reached Chicago with not quite five dollars in my pockets , and , with a courage which I now marvel at , I paid immediately four dollars and a half for a week 's board and lodging . " Well , " I said to myself , " for a week I am safe . If I earn nothing in that time , at least I shall owe nothing when I have to turn out into the streets . " It was a rather dirty little boarding - house , in Wabash Avenue , and occupied , as I soon found , almost entirely by actors . There was no fireplace in my bedroom , and if there had been I could n't have afforded a fire . But that mattered little ; what I had to do was to set forth and discover some way of making money . Do n't suppose that I was in a desperate state of mind ; how it was , I do n't quite know , but I felt decidedly cheerful . It was pleasant to be in this new region of the earth , and I went about the town like a tourist who has abundant resources . '
172974	173117	172969	172969	He	3360	' I saw nothing for it but to apply at the office of some newspaper , and as I happened to light upon the biggest of them first of all , I put on a bold face , marched in , asked if I could see the editor . There was no difficulty whatever about this ; I was told to ascend by means of the " elevator " to an upper storey , and there I walked into a comfortable little room where a youngish man sat smoking a cigar at a table covered with print and manuscript . I introduced myself , stated my business . " Can you give me work of any kind on your paper ? " " Well , what experience have you had ? " " None whatever . " The editor smiled . " I 'm
173174	173250	173251	173251	He	3363	're always glad of a short story , if it 's good . " This was a big daily paper ; they have weekly supplements of all conceivable kinds of matter . " Well , " I said , " if I write a story of English life , will you consider it ? " " With pleasure . " I left him , and went out as if my existence were henceforth provided for . '
173262	173488	173251	173251	He	3363	' It was a great thing to be permitted to write a story , but then — what story ? I went down to the shore of Lake Michigan ; walked there for half an hour in an icy wind . Then I looked for a stationer 's shop , and laid out a few of my remaining cents in the purchase of pen , ink , and paper — my stock of all these things was at an end when I left New York . Then back to the boarding - house . Impossible to write in my bedroom , the temperature was below zero ; there was no choice but to sit down in the common room , a place like the smoke - room of a poor commercial hotel in England . A dozen men were gathered about the fire , smoking , talking , quarrelling . Favourable conditions , you see , for literary effort . But the story had to be written , and write it I did , sitting there at the end of a deal table ; I finished it in less than a couple of days , a good long story , enough to fill three columns of the huge paper . I stand amazed at my power of concentration as often as I think of it ! '
173489	173495	173497	173497	Dora	188	' And was it accepted ? '
173499	173626	173497	173497	Dora	188	' You shall hear . I took my manuscript to the editor , and he told me to come and see him again next morning . I did n't forget the appointment . As I entered he smiled in a very promising way , and said , " I think your story will do . I 'll put it into the Saturday supplement . Call on Saturday morning and I 'll remunerate you . " How well I remember that word " remunerate " ! I have had an affection for the word ever since . And remunerate me he did ; scribbled something on a scrap of paper , which I presented to the cashier . The sum was eighteen dollars . Behold me saved ! '
173633	173729	173627	173627	He	3365	' I have never come across an English editor who treated me with anything like that consideration and general kindliness . How the man had time , in his position , to see me so often , and do things in such a human way , I ca n't understand . Imagine anyone trying the same at the office of a London newspaper ! To begin with , one could n't see the editor at all . I shall always think with profound gratitude of that man with the peaked brown beard and pleasant smile . '
173730	173741	173743	173743	Dora	188	' But did the pea - nuts come after that ? '
173745	174018	173743	173743	Dora	188	' Alas ! they did . For some months I supported myself in Chicago , writing for that same paper , and for others . But at length the flow of my inspiration was checked ; I had written myself out . And I began to grow home - sick , wanted to get back to England . The result was that I found myself one day in New York again , but without money enough to pay for a passage home . I tried to write one more story . But it happened , as I was looking over newspapers in a reading - room , that I saw one of my Chicago tales copied into a paper published at Troy . Now Troy was not very far off , and it occurred to me that , if I went there , the editor of this paper might be disposed to employ me , seeing he had a taste for my fiction . And I went , up the Hudson by steamboat . On landing at Troy I was as badly off as when I reached Chicago ; I had less than a dollar . And the worst of it was I had come on a vain errand ; the editor treated me with scant courtesy , and no work was to be got . I took a little room , paying for it day by day , and in the meantime I fed on those loathsome pea - nuts , buying a handful in the street now and then . And I assure you I looked starvation in the face . '
174019	174028	174030	174030	Marian	211	' What sort of a town is Troy ? '
174038	174064	174030	174030	Marian	211	' Do n't ask me . They make straw - hats there principally , and they sell pea - nuts . More I remember not . '
174065	174074	174076	174076	Maud	187	' But you did n't starve to death , '
174078	174353	174076	174076	Maud	187	' No , I just did n't . I went one afternoon into a lawyer 's office , thinking I might get some copying work , and there I found an odd - looking old man , sitting with an open Bible on his knees . He explained to me that he was n't the lawyer ; that the lawyer was away on business , and that he was just guarding the office . Well , could he help me ? He meditated , and a thought occurred to him . " Go , " he said , " to such and such a boarding - house , and ask for Mr. Freeman Sterling . He is just starting on a business tour , and wants a young man to accompany him . " I did n't dream of asking what the business was , but sped , as fast as my trembling limbs would carry me , to the address he had mentioned . I asked for Mr. Freeman Sterling , and found him . He was a photographer , and his business at present was to go about getting orders for the reproducing of old portraits . A good - natured young fellow . He said he liked the look of me , and on the spot engaged me to assist him in a house - to - house visitation . He would pay for my board and lodging , and give me a commission on all the orders I obtained . Forthwith I sat down to a " square meal , " and ate — my conscience , how I ate ! '
174354	174367	174369	174369	Jasper	186	' You were not eminently successful in that pursuit , I think ? '
174371	174493	174369	174369	Jasper	186	' I do n't think I got half a dozen orders . Yet that good Samaritan supported me for five or six weeks , whilst we travelled from Troy to Boston . It could n't go on ; I was ashamed of myself ; at last I told him that we must part . Upon my word , I believe he would have paid my expenses for another month ; why , I ca n't understand . But he had a vast respect for me because I had written in newspapers , and I do seriously think that he did n't like to tell me I was a useless fellow . We parted on the very best of terms in Boston . '
174494	174505	174507	174507	Dora	188	' And you again had recourse to pea - nuts ? '
174509	174553	174507	174507	Dora	188	' Well , no . In the meantime I had written to someone in England , begging the loan of just enough money to enable me to get home . The money came a day after I had seen Sterling off by train . '
174597	174614	174593	174593	Dora	188	' You wished me to tell you when it was half - past nine , Marian . '
174658	174670	174671	174671	he	207	' Too good of you to have asked me to come , '
174686	174700	174671	174671	he	207	' You are a happy man , by Jove ! A happy man ! '
174736	174741	174742	174742	she	211	' Is it true ? '
174745	174752	174742	174742	she	211	' Tolerably true , I think . '
174753	174763	174764	174764	He	207	' Then I am as happy as you are . '
174775	174801	174802	174802	She	211	' Marian , I have been thinking about that letter to your father . I had better get it written , do n't you think ? '
174810	174824	174802	174802	She	211	' Perhaps you had . Though we said it might be delayed until — '
174825	174850	174742	174742	she	211	' Yes , I know . But I suspect you had rather I did n't wait any longer . Is n't that the truth ? '
174851	174862	174742	174742	she	211	' Partly . Do just as you wish , Jasper . '
174863	174875	174802	174802	She	211	' I 'll go and see him , if you like . '
174876	174889	174742	174742	she	211	' I am so afraid — No , writing will be better . '
174890	174905	174742	174742	she	211	' Very well . Then he shall have the letter to - morrow afternoon . '
174906	174931	174742	174742	she	211	' Do n't let it come before the last post . I had so much rather not . Manage it , if you can . '
174932	174963	174964	174964	She	211	' Very well . Now go and say good - night to the girls . It 's a vile night , and you must get home as soon as possible . '
174976	174984	174964	174964	She	211	' Just a word or two more . '
174985	174990	174742	174742	she	211	' About the letter ? '
174991	174999	175000	175000	He	207	' No . You have n't said — '
175003	175023	175000	175000	He	207	' And you could n't go away contentedly unless I repeated for the hundredth time that I love you ? '
175029	175043	175024	175024	Marian	211	' Do you think it foolish ? I live only on those words . '
175044	175055	175024	175024	Marian	211	' Well , they are better than pea - nuts . '
175056	175067	175068	175068	Jasper	186	' Oh do n't ! I ca n't bear to — '
175159	175172	175173	175173	he	207	' You are a dear , good , tender - hearted girl , '
175190	175197	175173	175173	he	207	' Now go and get ready . '
175216	175234	175214	175215	the girls	420	' room . Marian had finished the rough draft of a paper on James Harrington , author of '
175237	175282	175214	175215	the girls	420	' Her father went through it by the midnight lamp , and the next morning made his comments . A black sky and sooty rain strengthened his inclination to sit by the study fire and talk at large in a tone of flattering benignity . '

175408	175454	175401	175401	you	0	' answered the girl , who was far from easy under this praise . Of late there had been too much of it ; it made her regard her father with suspicions which increased her sense of trouble in keeping a momentous secret from him . '
175503	175508	175509	175509	I	0	' he smiled anxiously , '
175542	175614	175526	175526	you	0	' Marian understood the intention that lay beneath this proposal . She saw that her father would not allow himself to seem discouraged by the silence she maintained on the great subject which awaited her decision . He was endeavouring gradually to involve her in his ambitions , to carry her forward by insensible steps . It pained her to observe the suppressed eagerness with which he looked for her reply . '

But I never quite knew what I wished to be at in fiction . I was n't content to write a mere narrative of the exciting kind , yet I could n't hit upon subjects of intellectual cast that altogether satisfied me . Well , well ; I have tried my hand at most kinds of literature . Assuredly I merit the title of man of letters . '
175850	175855	175755	175755	I	0	' You certainly do . '
175856	175990	176007	176007	he	3382	' By - the - by , what should you think of that title for a review — Letters ? It has never been used , so far as I know . I like the word " letters . " How much better " a man of letters " than " a literary man " ! And apropos of that , when was the word " literature " first used in our modern sense to signify a body of writing ? In Johnson 's day it was pretty much the equivalent of our " culture . " You remember his saying , " It is surprising how little literature people have . " His dictionary , I believe , defines the word as " learning , skill in letters " — nothing else . '
176030	176039	176040	176040	he	3382	' I think Letters would n't be amiss , '
176059	176081	176082	176082	He	3382	' It would clearly indicate our scope . No articles on bimetallism , as Quarmby said — was n't it Quarmby ? '

176768	176812	176766	176767	my sisters	4538	' lodgings it came about that I met Miss Yule there from time to time . In this way was confirmed my attachment to your daughter . The better I knew her , the more worthy I found her of reverence and love . '
176848	177013	176846	176847	my sisters	4538	' coming to London I did call one day at your house with the desire of seeing you , but unfortunately you were not at home . Very soon after that I learnt to my extreme regret that my connection with The Current and its editor would make any repetition of my visit very distasteful to you . I was conscious of nothing in my literary life that could justly offend you — and at this day I can say the same — but I shrank from the appearance of importunity , and for some months I was deeply distressed by the fear that what I most desired in life had become unattainable . My means were very slight ; I had no choice but to take such work as offered , and mere chance had put me into a position which threatened ruin to the hope that you would some day regard me as a not unworthy suitor for your daughter 's hand .

179056	179225	179234	179234	he	0	' It was idle to address him . Mrs. Yule went into the sitting - room , and there sat weeping for an hour . Then she extinguished the lights , and crept upstairs in silence . Yule passed the night in the study . Towards morning he slept for an hour or two , just long enough to let the fire go out and to get thoroughly chilled . When he opened his eyes a muddy twilight had begun to show at the window ; the sounds of a clapping door within the house , which had probably awakened him , made him aware that the servant was already up . He drew up the blind . There seemed to be a frost , for the moisture of last night had all disappeared , and the yard upon which the window looked was unusually clean . With a glance at the black grate he extinguished his lamp , and went out into the passage . A few minutes '

Yule wondered at himself for caring to seek such a singular consultation , but he had a pressing desire to hear some opinion as to the state of his eyes . Whatever the stranger might tell him , he would afterwards have recourse to a man of recognised standing ; but just now companionship of any kind was welcome , and the poor hungry fellow , with his dolorous life - story , had made appeal to his sympathies . To give money under guise of a fee would be better than merely offering alms . '
180716	180727	180590	180590	I	0	' said his guide , pausing at a dirty door . '

Daylight had now succeeded to dawn , yet the first thing the stranger did was to strike a match and light a candle . '
180826	180830	180815	180815	you	3480	' he said . '
180850	180851	180843	180843	You	3480	' '
180860	180934	180843	180843	You	3480	' The other smiled , and at once offered a simple explanation of the term . By the appearance of the candle as it reflected itself in the patient 's eye it was possible , he said , to decide whether cataract had taken hold upon the organ . For a minute or two he conducted his experiment carefully , and Yule was at no loss to read the result upon his face . '
180945	180957	180938	180938	you	3480	' the surgeon asked , as he put down the candle . '

181194	181218	181219	181219	You	3480	' They talked for half an hour , until both were shaking with cold . Then Yule thrust his hand into his pocket . '
181234	181238	181219	181219	You	3480	' he said . '
181253	181275	181276	181276	My	0	' He laid five shillings on the chest of drawers — there was no table . The stranger expressed his gratitude . '

181316	181691	181304	181304	you	3480	' They shook hands , and Yule quitted the house . He came out again by Camden Town station . The coffee - stall had disappeared ; the traffic of the great highway was growing uproarious . Among all the strugglers for existence who rushed this way and that , Alfred Yule felt himself a man chosen for fate 's heaviest infliction . He never questioned the accuracy of the stranger 's judgment , and he hoped for no mitigation of the doom it threatened . His life was over — and wasted . He might as well go home , and take his place meekly by the fireside . He was beaten . Soon to be a useless old man , a burden and annoyance to whosoever had pity on him . It was a curious effect of the imagination that since coming into the open air again his eyesight seemed to be far worse than before . He irritated his nerves of vision by incessant tests , closing first one eye then the other , comparing his view of nearer objects with the appearance of others more remote , fancying an occasional pain — which could have had no connection with his disease . The literary projects which had stirred so actively in his mind twelve hours ago were become an insubstantial memory ; to the one crushing blow had succeeded a second , which was fatal . He could hardly recall what special piece of work he had been engaged upon last night . His thoughts were such as if actual blindness had really fallen upon him . At half - past eight he entered the house . Mrs. Yule was standing at the foot of the stairs ; she looked at him , then turned away towards the kitchen . He went upstairs . On coming down again he found breakfast ready as usual , and seated himself at the table . Two letters waited for him there ; he opened them . When Mrs. Yule came into the room a few moments later she was astonished by a burst of loud , mocking laughter from her husband , excited , as it appeared , by something he was reading . '
181696	181704	181693	181693	Marian	211	' he asked , turning to her . '
181707	181708	181693	181693	Marian	211	' '
181716	181717	181709	181709	She	211	' '

181737	181786	181787	181787	He	3488	' Mrs. Yule ascended to her daughter 's bed - room . She knocked , was bidden enter , and found Marian packing clothes in a trunk . The girl looked as if she had been up all night ; her eyes bore the traces of much weeping . '
181794	181806	181808	181808	he	3488	' said Mrs. Yule , in the low voice of apprehension , '
181817	181903	181808	181808	he	3488	' Marian took the sheet , unfolded it , and read . As soon as she had reached the end she looked wildly at her mother , seemed to endeavour vainly to speak , then fell to the floor in unconsciousness . The mother was only just able to break the violence of her fall . Having snatched a pillow and placed it beneath Marian 's head , she rushed to the door and called loudly for her husband , who in a moment appeared . '
181908	181914	181808	181808	he	3488	' she cried to him . '
181933	181934	181927	181927	you	3488	' '

181961	181969	181951	181951	I	0	' The swoon lasted for several minutes . '
181976	181986	181987	181987	Her	4377	' asked Mrs. Yule whilst chafing the lifeless hands . '

182019	182138	182005	182005	She	4377	' The letter was a private communication from one of John Yule 's executors . It seemed likely that the demand upon Turberville & Co. for an account of the deceased partner 's share in their business had helped to bring about a crisis in affairs that were already unstable . Something might be recovered in the legal proceedings that would result , but there were circumstances which made the outlook very doubtful . As Marian came to herself her father left the room . An hour afterwards Mrs. Yule summoned him again to the girl 's chamber ; he went , and found Marian lying on the bed , looking like one who had been long ill . '

Her intention to leave the house was , of course , abandoned ; she was the prisoner of fate . Mrs. Yule would have tended her with unremitting devotion , but the girl desired to be alone . At times she lay in silent anguish ; frequently her tears broke forth , and she sobbed until weariness overcame her . In the afternoon she wrote a letter to Mr. Holden , begging that she might be kept constantly acquainted with the progress of things . At five her mother brought tea . '

183461	183516	183587	183587	her	3511	' Well , well ; it is n't a matter of much moment . But what I have in mind is this . Will it be possible for you , whilst living at home , to take a position of independence , and say that you are going to work for your own profit ? '
183517	183537	183587	183587	her	3511	' At least I might claim half the money I can earn . And I was thinking more of — '

183543	183580	183581	183581	She	3511	' When I am your wife , I may be able to help . I could earn thirty or forty pounds a year , I think . That would pay the rent of a small house . '
183594	183621	183581	183581	She	3511	' But , my dear Marian , we surely ought n't to think of marrying so long as expenses are so nicely fitted as all that ? '
183622	183629	183630	183630	She	3511	' No . I only meant — '
183643	183648	183650	183650	Jasper	186	' It simply means , '
183659	183726	183650	183650	Jasper	186	' that I must move heaven and earth to improve my position . You know that my faith in myself is not small ; there 's no knowing what I might do if I used every effort .

183880	183885	183860	183860	she	211	' But answer seriously . '
183886	183905	183860	183860	she	211	' How can you doubt that I would wait faithfully for you for years if it were necessary ? '
183906	183935	183860	183860	she	211	' It must n't be years , that 's very certain . I think it preposterous for a man to hold a woman bound in that hopeless way . '
183936	183977	183860	183860	she	211	' But what question is there of holding me bound ? Is love dependent on fixed engagements ? Do you feel that , if we agreed to part , your love would be at once a thing of the past ? '
183978	183986	183860	183860	she	211	' Why no , of course not . '
183987	183998	183999	183999	She	211	' Oh , but how coldly you speak , Jasper ! '
184169	184182	184183	184183	she	211	' How can I make you feel how much I love you ? '
184186	184216	184183	184183	she	211	' You must n't be so literal , dearest . Women are so desperately matter - of - fact ; it comes out even in their love - talk . '

That thought which at times gives trouble to all women of strong emotions was working in her : had she been too demonstrative , and made her love too cheap ? Now that Jasper 's love might be endangered , it behoved her to use any arts which nature prompted . And so , for once , he was not wholly satisfied with her , and at their parting he wondered what subtle change had affected her manner to him . '

186117	186180	186115	186115	Dora	188	' Perhaps not . But as I have made up my mind to be considerably better off than most literary men that reflection would n't console me much .

186187	186231	186115	186115	Dora	188	' And nodding a good - night he left them . When Marian entered the house and went upstairs , she was followed by her mother . On Mrs. Yule 's countenance there was a new distress , she had been crying recently . '
186237	186242	186233	186233	you	3544	' the mother asked . '

186285	186294	186295	186295	He	229	' said Mrs. Yule after a long silence . '
186352	186362	186363	186363	He	229	' The girl listened in an attitude of despair . '
186375	186376	186377	186377	He	229	' '

186456	186759	186438	186438	somebody	5343	' answered the girl . Physical weariness brought her a few hours of oblivion as soon as she had lain down , but her sleep came to an end in the early morning , when the pressure of evil dreams forced her back to consciousness of real sorrows and cares . A fog - veiled sky added its weight to crush her spirit ; at the hour when she usually rose it was still all but as dark as midnight . Her mother 's voice at the door begged her to lie and rest until it grew lighter , and she willingly complied , feeling indeed scarcely capable of leaving her bed . The thick black fog penetrated every corner of the house . It could be smelt and tasted . Such an atmosphere produces low - spirited languor even in the vigorous and hopeful ; to those wasted by suffering it is the very reek of the bottomless pit , poisoning the soul . Her face colourless as the pillow , Marian lay neither sleeping nor awake , in blank extremity of woe ; tears now and then ran down her cheeks , and at times her body was shaken with a throe such as might result from anguish of the torture - chamber . Midway in the morning , when it was still necessary to use artificial light , she went down to the sitting - room . The course of household life had been thrown into confusion by the disasters of the last day or two ; Mrs. Yule , who occupied herself almost exclusively with questions of economy , cleanliness , and routine , had not the heart to pursue her round of duties , and this morning , though under normal circumstances she would have been busy in '
186762	186879	186880	186880	Your	3554	' the dining - room , she moved aimlessly and despondently about the house , giving the servant contradictory orders and then blaming herself for her absent - mindedness . In the troubles of her husband and her daughter she had scarcely greater share — so far as active participation went — than if she had been only a faithful old housekeeper ; she could only grieve and lament that such discord had come between the two whom she loved , and that in herself was no power even to solace their distresses . Marian found her standing in the passage , with a duster in one hand and a hearth - brush in the other . '
186892	186897	186898	186898	I	0	' Mrs. Yule whispered . '
186904	187018	186898	186898	I	0	' Marian entered the study . Her father was not in his place at the writing - table , nor yet seated in the chair which he used when he had leisure to draw up to the fireside ; he sat in front of one of the bookcases , bent forward as if seeking a volume , but his chin was propped upon his hand , and he had maintained this position for a long time . He did not immediately move . When he raised his head Marian saw that he looked older , and she noticed — or fancied she did — that there was some unfamiliar peculiarity about his eyes . '

187766	188237	188238	188239	Mr. Bailey	307	' Marian withdrew . She went to the sittingroom , where an ochreous daylight was beginning to diffuse itself and to render the lamp superfluous . With the dissipation of the fog rain had set in ; its splashing upon the muddy pavement was audible . Mrs. Yule , still with a duster in her hand , sat on the sofa . Marian took a place beside her . They talked in low , broken tones , and wept together over their miseries . The chances are that you have neither understanding nor sympathy for men such as Edwin Reardon and Harold Biffen . They merely provoke you . They seem to you inert , flabby , weakly envious , foolishly obstinate , impiously mutinous , and many other things . You are made angrily contemptuous by their failure to get on ; why do n't they bestir themselves , push and bustle , welcome kicks so long as halfpence follow , make a place in the world 's eye — in short , take a leaf from the book of Mr. Jasper Milvain ? But try to imagine a personality wholly unfitted for the rough and tumble of the world 's labour - market . From the familiar point of view these men were worthless ; view them in possible relation to a humane order of society , and they are admirable citizens . Nothing is easier than to condemn a type of character which is unequal to the coarse demands of life as it suits the average man . These two were richly endowed with the kindly and the imaginative virtues ; if fate threw them amid incongruous circumstances , is their endowment of less value ? You scorn their passivity ; but it was their nature and their merit to be passive . Gifted with independent means , each of them would have taken quite a different aspect in your eyes . The sum of their faults was their inability to earn money ; but , indeed , that inability does not call for unmingled disdain . It was very weak of Harold Biffen to come so near perishing of hunger as he did in the days when he was completing his novel . But he would have vastly preferred to eat and be satisfied had any method of obtaining food presented itself to him . He did not starve for the pleasure of the thing , I assure you . Pupils were difficult to get just now , and writing that he had sent to magazines had returned upon his hands . He pawned such of his possessions as he could spare , and he reduced his meals to the minimum . Nor was he uncheerful in his cold garret and with his empty stomach , for '
188243	188580	188241	188241	Grocer	5635	' drew steadily to an end . He worked very slowly . The book would make perhaps two volumes of ordinary novel size , but he had laboured over it for many months , patiently , affectionately , scrupulously . Each sentence was as good as he could make it , harmonious to the ear , with words of precious meaning skilfully set . Before sitting down to a chapter he planned it minutely in his mind ; then he wrote a rough draft of it ; then he elaborated the thing phrase by phrase . He had no thought of whether such toil would be recompensed in coin of the realm ; nay , it was his conviction that , if with difficulty published , it could scarcely bring him money . The work must be significant , that was all he cared for . And he had no society of admiring friends to encourage him . Reardon understood the merit of the workmanship , but frankly owned that the book was repulsive to him . To the public it would be worse than repulsive — tedious , utterly uninteresting . No matter ; it drew to its end . The day of its completion was made memorable by an event decidedly more exciting , even to the author . At eight o'clock in the evening there remained half a page to be written . Biffen had already worked about nine hours , and on breaking off to appease his hunger he doubted whether to finish to - night or to postpone the last lines till to - morrow . The discovery that only a small crust of bread lay in the cupboard decided him to write no more ; he would have to go out to purchase a loaf , and that was disturbance . But stay ; had he enough money ? He searched his pockets . Two pence and two farthings ; no more . You are probably not aware that at bakers '

189699	189704	189705	189705	He	3613	' observed the man . '

190173	190179	190169	190171	a dead man	3625	' flashed across his mind , '
190193	190871	190872	190872	Hollo	374	' A frenzied effort , the last of which his muscles were capable , and the door yielded . His head was now through the aperture , and though the smoke swept up about him , that gasp of cold air gave him strength to throw himself on the flat portion of the roof that he had reached . So for a minute or two he lay . Then he was able to stand , to survey his position , and to walk along by the parapet . He looked down upon the surging and shouting crowd in Clipstone Street , but could see it only at intervals , owing to the smoke that rolled from the front windows below him . What he had now to do he understood perfectly . This roof was divided from those on either hand by a stack of chimneys ; to get round the end of these stacks was impossible , or at all events too dangerous a feat unless it were the last resource , but by climbing to the apex of the slates he would be able to reach the chimney - pots , to drag himself up to them , and somehow to tumble over on to the safer side . To this undertaking he forthwith addressed himself . Without difficulty he reached the ridge ; standing on it he found that only by stretching his arm to the utmost could he grip the top of a chimney - pot . Had he the strength necessary to raise himself by such a hold ? And suppose the pot broke ? His life was still in danger ; the increasing volumes of smoke warned him that in a few minutes the uppermost storey might be in flames . He took off his overcoat to allow himself more freedom of action ; the manuscript , now an encumbrance , must precede him over the chimney - stack , and there was only one way of effecting that . With care he stowed the papers into the pockets of the coat ; then he rolled the garment together , tied it up in its own sleeves , took a deliberate aim — and the bundle was for the present in safety . Now for the gymnastic endeavour . Standing on tiptoe , he clutched the rim of the chimneypot , and strove to raise himself . The hold was firm enough , but his arms were far too puny to perform such work , even when death would be the penalty of failure . Too long he had lived on insufficient food and sat over the debilitating desk . He swung this way and that , trying to throw one of his knees as high as the top of the brickwork , but there was no chance of his succeeding . Dropping on to the slates , he sat there in perturbation . He must cry for help . In front it was scarcely possible to stand by the parapet , owing to the black clouds of smoke , now mingled with sparks ; perchance he might attract the notice of some person either in the yards behind or at the back windows of other houses . The night was so obscure that he could not hope to be seen ; voice alone must be depended upon , and there was no certainty that it would be heard far enough . Though he stood in his shirt - sleeves in a bitter wind no sense of cold affected him ; his face was beaded with perspiration drawn forth by his futile struggle to climb . He let himself slide down the rear slope , and , holding by the end of the chimney brickwork , looked into the yards . At the same instant a face appeared to him — that of a man who was trying to obtain a glimpse of this roof from that of the next house by thrusting out his head beyond the block of chimneys . '

191017	191149	191006	191006	I	0	' shouted Biffen . The man disappeared for five minutes . To Biffen it seemed half an hour ; he felt , or imagined he felt , the slates getting hot beneath him , and the smoke was again catching his breath . But at length there was a shout from the top of the chimney - stack . The rescuer had seated himself on one of the pots , and was about to lower on Biffen 's side a ladder which had enabled him to ascend from the other . Biffen planted the lowest rung very carefully on the ridge of the roof , climbed as lightly as possible , got a footing between two pots ; the ladder was then pulled over , and both men descended in safety . '
191159	191166	191167	191167	I	0	' was Biffen 's first question . '

191219	191282	191210	191210	You	0	' said the man . This was a terrible blow ; Biffen forgot his rescue from destruction in lament for the loss of his manuscript . He would have pursued the fruitless search , but his companion , who feared that the fire might spread to adjoining houses , insisted on his passing through the trap - door and descending the stairs . '
191291	191304	191210	191210	You	0	' Biffen said , when they were down on the ground floor , '
191329	191394	191432	191433	Mr. Bailey	307	' He was standing in the midst of a cluster of alarmed people , who stared at him in astonishment , for the reek through which he had fought his way had given him the aspect of a sweep . His suggestion prompted someone to run into the yard , with the result that a muddy bundle was brought in and exhibited to him . '
191402	191403	191400	191400	Mister	3633	' '
191420	191431	191432	191433	Mr. Bailey	307	' He unrolled the garment , felt to make sure that '
191434	191444	191432	191433	Mr. Bailey	307	' was safe , and finally put it on . '
191463	191696	191446	191447	anyone here	3634	' he asked , feeling now as if he must drop with exhaustion . The man who had rescued him performed this further kindness , and for half an hour , whilst tumult indescribable raged about him , Biffen sat recovering his strength . By that time the firemen were hard at work , but one floor of the burning house had already fallen through , and it was probable that nothing but the shell would be saved . After giving a full account of himself to the people among whom he had come , Harold declared his intention of departing ; his need of repose was imperative , and he could not hope for it in this proximity to the fire . As he had no money , his only course was to inquire for a room at some house in the immediate neighbourhood , where the people would receive him in a charitable spirit . With the aid of the police he passed to where the crowd was thinner , and came out into Cleveland Street . Here most of the house - doors were open , and he made several applications for hospitality , but either his story was doubted or his grimy appearance predisposed people against him . At length , when again his strength was all but at an end , he made appeal to a policeman . '
191702	191711	191698	191698	you	3636	' he protested , after explaining his position , '
191762	191886	191891	191891	you	3640	' The officer recognised a man who was standing half - dressed on a threshold close by ; he stepped up to him , and made representations which were successful . In a few minutes Biffen took possession of an underground room furnished as a bedchamber , which he agreed to rent for a week . His landlord was not ungracious , and went so far as to supply him with warm water , that he might in a measure cleanse himself . This operation rapidly performed , the hapless author flung himself into bed , and before long was fast asleep . When he went upstairs about nine o'clock in the morning he discovered that his host kept an oil - shop . '
191893	191899	191891	191891	you	3640	' asked the man sympathetically . '
191921	191928	191929	191929	Your	3640	' Biffen shook his head dolorously . '
191934	191941	191929	191929	Your	3640	' cried the dealer in oil . '
191954	192075	191929	191929	Your	3640	' The author corrected this misapprehension . In the end he was invited to break his fast , which he did right willingly . Then , with assurances that he would return before nightfall , he left the house . His steps were naturally first directed to Clipstone Street ; the familiar abode was a gruesome ruin , still smoking . Neighbours informed him that Mr. Briggs 's body had been brought forth in a horrible condition ; but this was the only loss of life that had happened . Thence he struck eastward , and at eleven came to Manville Street , Islington . He found Reardon by the fireside , looking very ill , and speaking with hoarseness . '
192079	192080	191929	191929	Your	3640	' '

192249	192316	192318	192318	you	3640	' Biffen had already laid the manuscript on the table ; it was dirty and crumpled , but not to such an extent as to render copying necessary . Lovingly he smoothed the pages and set them in order , then he wrapped the whole in a piece of brown paper which Reardon supplied , and wrote upon it the address of a firm of publishers . '
192337	192433	192323	192323	I	0	' Indeed his attire was more like that of a bankrupt costermonger than of a man of letters . Collar he had none , for the griminess of that he wore last night had necessitated its being thrown aside ; round his throat was a dirty handkerchief . His coat had been brushed , but its recent experiences had brought it one stage nearer to that dissolution which must very soon be its fate . His grey trousers were now black , and his boots looked as if they had not been cleaned for weeks . '
192445	192456	192435	192435	I	0	' he asked , seating himself with pen and paper . '

192478	192487	192458	192458	I	0	' replied Reardon , in his hoarse voice . '

192640	192709	192632	192632	I	0	' The brother of whom he spoke was employed in a house of business at Liverpool ; the two had not met for years , but they corresponded , and were on terms such as Harold indicated . When he had finished his letters , and had received the half - sovereign from Reardon , he went his way to deposit the brown - paper parcel at the publishers '
192878	192886	192887	192887	he	195	' I find it difficult to think , '
192890	192950	192887	192887	he	195	' that you will always struggle on in such an existence as this . To every man of metal there does come an opportunity , and it surely is time for yours to present itself . I have a superstitious faith in " Mr. Bailey . " If he leads you to triumph , do n't altogether forget me . '
192951	192957	192871	192871	he	195	' Do n't talk nonsense . '
192958	193072	192871	192871	he	195	' What ages it seems since that day when I saw you in the library at Hastings , and heard you ask in vain for my book ! And how grateful I was to you ! I wonder whether any mortal ever asks for my books nowadays ? Some day , when I am well established at Croydon , you shall go to Mudie 's , and make inquiry if my novels ever by any chance leave the shelves , and then you shall give me a true and faithful report of the answer you get . " He is quite forgotten , " the attendant will say ; be sure of it . '
193073	193078	192887	192887	he	195	' I think not . '
193079	193160	192871	192871	he	195	' To have had even a small reputation , and to have outlived it , is a sort of anticipation of death . The man Edwin Reardon , whose name was sometimes spoken in a tone of interest , is really and actually dead . And what remains of me is resigned to that . I have an odd fancy that it will make death itself easier ; it is as if only half of me had now to die . '
193173	193180	193181	193181	he	278	' Thinking of my fiery adventure , '
193191	193349	193181	193181	he	278	' I find it vastly amusing to picture you as a witness at the inquest if I had been choked and consumed . No doubt it would have been made known that I rushed upstairs to save some particular piece of property — several people heard me say so — and you alone would be able to conjecture what this was . Imagine the gaping wonderment of the coroner 's jury ! The Daily Telegraph would have made a leader out of me . " This poor man was so strangely deluded as to the value of a novel in manuscript which it appears he had just completed , that he positively sacrificed his life in the endeavour to rescue it from the flames . " And the Saturday would have had a column of sneering jocosity on the irrepressibly sanguine temperament of authors . At all events , I should have had my day of fame . '
193350	193361	193362	193362	he	3657	' But what an ignoble death it would have been ! '
193365	193394	193362	193362	he	3657	' Perishing in the garret of a lodging - house which caught fire by the overturning of a drunkard 's lamp ! One would like to end otherwise . '
193395	193403	193405	193405	Reardon	195	' Where would you wish to die ? '
193409	193413	193415	193416	the other	1606	' At home , '
193422	193456	193415	193416	the other	1606	' I have never had a home since I was a boy , and am never likely to have one . But to die at home is an unreasoning hope I still cherish . '
193457	193473	193362	193362	he	3657	' If you had never come to London , what would you have now been ? '
193474	193496	193362	193362	he	3657	' Almost certainly a schoolmaster in some small town . And one might be worse off than that , you know . '
193497	193800	193415	193416	the other	1606	' Yes , one might live peaceably enough in such a position . And I — I should be in an estate - agent 's office , earning a sufficient salary , and most likely married to some unambitious country girl . I should have lived an intelligible life , instead of only trying to live , aiming at modes of life beyond my reach . My mistake was that of numberless men nowadays . Because I was conscious of brains , I thought that the only place for me was London . It 's easy enough to understand this common delusion . We form our ideas of London from old literature ; we think of London as if it were still the one centre of intellectual life ; we think and talk like Chatterton . But the truth is that intellectual men in our day do their best to keep away from London — when once they know the place . There are libraries everywhere ; papers and magazines reach the north of Scotland as soon as they reach Brompton ; it 's only on rare occasions , for special kinds of work , that one is bound to live in London . And as for recreation , why , now that no English theatre exists , what is there in London that you ca n't enjoy in almost any part of England ? At all events , a yearly visit of a week would be quite sufficient for all the special features of the town . London is only a huge shop , with an hotel on the upper storeys . To be sure , if you make it your artistic subject , that 's a different thing . But neither you nor I would do that by deliberate choice . '
193801	193806	193362	193362	he	3657	' I think not . '
193807	193896	193362	193362	he	3657	' It 's a huge misfortune , this will - o'-the - wisp attraction exercised by London on young men of brains . They come here to be degraded , or to perish , when their true sphere is a life of peaceful remoteness . The type of man capable of success in London is more or less callous and cynical . If I had the training of boys , I would teach them to think of London as the last place where life can be lived worthily . '
193897	193912	193415	193416	the other	1606	' And the place where you are most likely to die in squalid wretchedness . '
193913	193922	193924	193924	Reardon	195	' The one happy result of my experiences , '
193926	193993	193924	193924	Reardon	195	' is that they have cured me of ambition . What a miserable fellow I should be if I were still possessed with the desire to make a name ! I ca n't even recall very clearly that state of mind . My strongest desire now is for peaceful obscurity . I am tired out ; I want to rest for the remainder of my life . '
193994	194004	193362	193362	he	3657	' You wo n't have much rest at Croydon . '
194005	194124	193415	193416	the other	1606	' Oh , it is n't impossible . My time will be wholly occupied in a round of all but mechanical duties , and I think that will be the best medicine for my mind . I shall read very little , and that only in the classics . I do n't say that I shall always be content in such a position ; in a few years perhaps something pleasanter will offer . But in the meantime it will do very well . Then there is our expedition to Greece to look forward to . I am quite in earnest about that . The year after next , if we are both alive , assuredly we go . '
194125	194131	194132	194132	Biffen	278	' The year after next . '
194136	194148	194132	194132	Biffen	278	' I have demonstrated to you mathematically that it is possible . '
194149	194170	194171	194171	Someone	4342	' You have ; but so are a great many other things that one does not dare to hope for . '
194183	194194	194171	194171	Someone	4342	' Here 's a telegram for you , Mr. Reardon . '
194228	194256	194213	194213	Reardon	195	' Willie is ill of diphtheria . Please come to us at once . I am staying with Mrs. Carter at her mother 's , at Brighton . '
194263	194283	194213	194213	Reardon	195	' You had n't heard of her going there ? " said Biffen when he had read the lines . '

194421	194458	194373	194374	His friend	432	' But go I must . The poor little fellow has no great place in my heart , but , when Amy sends for me , I must go . Perhaps things are at the worst . '

When Harold returned , his appearance excited Reardon 's astonishment — he was white from head to foot . '

194883	195011	195012	195012	Reardon	191	' I might ; but we have both of us too little practicality . The art of living is the art of compromise . We have no right to foster sensibilities , and conduct ourselves as if the world allowed of ideal relations ; it leads to misery for others as well as ourselves . Genial coarseness is what it behoves men like you and me to cultivate . Your reply to your wife 's last letter was preposterous . You ought to have gone to her of your own accord as soon as ever you heard she was rich ; she would have thanked you for such common - sense disregard of delicacies . Let there be an end of this nonsense , I implore you ! '

What right have we to make ourselves and others miserable for the sake of an obstinate idealism ? It is our duty to make the best of circumstances .

195134	195161	195012	195012	Reardon	191	' You love your wife , and this summons she sends is proof that her thought turns to you as soon as she is in distress . '

I did n't really wish to ; I was unhappy , and felt how impossible it was to go on always living away from you . Oh , that I had never come ! Then Willie would have been as well as ever . '
196419	196428	196429	196429	She	3706	' Tell me when and how it began . '
196442	196489	196429	196429	She	3706	' I have a nurse with me in the room . It 's my own bedroom , and this house is so small it will be impossible to give you a bed here , Edwin . But there 's an hotel only a few yards away . '
196490	196501	196309	196309	his	191	' Yes , yes ; do n't trouble about that . '
196502	196523	196309	196309	his	191	' But you look so ill — you are shaking so . Is it a cold you have had long ? '
196524	196601	196309	196309	his	191	' Oh , my old habit ; you remember . One cold after another , all through the accursed winter . What does that matter when you speak kindly to me once more ?

I am so anxious for the doctor 's coming ; the poor little child can hardly draw a breath . How cruel it is that such suffering should come upon a little creature who has never done or thought ill !

I have been sitting here for hours , and I have done only that little bit , half a dozen lines . Such poor stuff too ! I should burn it , only I ca n't afford . I must do my regular quantity every day , no matter what it is . '

201223	201266	201267	201267	He	186	' No , for The West End . Fadge wo n't allow any one but hiself to be lauded in that style . I may as well do the notice for The Current now , as I 've got my hand in . '
201308	201323	201303	201303	he	186	' You would n't suspect they were written by the same man , eh ? '

In this clearer light Whelpdale was exhibited as a young man of greatly improved exterior ; he wore a cream - coloured waistcoat , a necktie of subtle hue , and delicate gloves ; prosperity breathed from his whole person . It was , in fact , only a moderate prosperity to which he had as yet attained , but the future beckoned to him flatteringly . Early in this year , his enterprise as '
201998	202090	201996	201997	literary adviser	3842	' had brought him in contact with a man of some pecuniary resources , who proposed to establish an agency for the convenience of authors who were not skilled in disposing of their productions to the best advantage . Under the name of Fleet & Co. , this business was shortly set on foot , and Whelpdale 's services were retained on satisfactory terms . The birth of the syndicate system had given new scope to literary agencies , and Mr. Fleet was a man of keen eye for commercial opportunities . '
202100	202104	202096	202096	Biffen	278	' asked Jasper . '
202132	202140	202127	202128	Miss Dora	188	'm afraid it is hardly for you . '

202150	202169	202185	202185	Dora	188	' You should only read of beautiful things , of happy lives . This book must depress you . '
202170	202183	202185	202185	Dora	188	' But why will you imagine me such a feeble- minded person ? '
202187	202210	202185	202185	Dora	188	' You have so often spoken like this . I have really no ambition to be a doll of such superfine wax . '

202240	202306	202224	202224	he	3844	' I am very far indeed from attributing weakness to you . It was only the natural , unreflecting impulse ; one finds it so difficult to associate you , even as merely a reader , with such squalid scenes . The ignobly decent , as poor Biffen calls it , is so very far from that sphere in which you are naturally at home . '
202338	202342	202344	202345	the latter	4456	' No doubt , '
202347	202371	202344	202345	the latter	4456	' it 's my story in The English Girl that inclines you to think me a goody - goody sort of young woman . '

202547	202564	202568	202568	Whelpdale	207	' The subject of this panegyric coloured a little and laughed . Unmistakably she was pleased . '

Am I not right ? Everything must be very short , two inches at the utmost ; their attention ca n't sustain itself beyond two inches . Even chat is too solid for them : they want chit - chat . '
203477	203486	203487	203487	he	186	' There 's something in this , Whelpdale , '

203700	203744	203695	203695	Whelpdale	207	' Yes . And really , you know , it may be better at such times to read chit - chat than to be altogether vacant , or to talk unprofitably . I am not sure ; I bow to your opinion unreservedly . '
203745	203758	203760	203760	Dora	188	' So long as they only read the paper at such times , '

203839	203843	203845	203845	Dora	188	' It might , '
203849	203860	203845	203845	Dora	188	' And in that case you would be doing good ! '

203891	203950	203874	203874	Whelpdale	207	' Seriously , I think there is . It would all depend on the skill of the fellows who put the thing together every week . There ought always to be one strongly sensational item — we wo n't call it article . For instance , you might display on a placard : " What the Queen eats ! ''

204121	204203	204204	204204	Jasper	186	' Oh , all the use in the world . Lake would pay most respectful attention to your opinion , though he thinks so little of mine . You are a man of note , I am nobody . I feel convinced that you could persuade the Chat people to adopt my idea , and they might be willing to give me a contingent share of contingent profits , if I had really shown them the way to a good thing . '
204240	204258	204237	204237	Milvain	186	' Ha ! this is lucky . There 's something here that may interest you , Whelpdale . '
204259	204262	204365	204365	Dora	188	' Proofs ? '
204263	204275	204276	204276	He	186	' Yes . A paper I have written for The Wayside . '
204284	204301	204279	204279	Dora	188	' How do you like the title ? — " The Novels of Edwin Reardon ! " '
204302	204309	204311	204312	the other	1606	' You do n't say so ! '
204314	204358	204311	204312	the other	1606	' What a good - hearted fellow you are , Milvain ! Now that 's really a kind thing to have done . By Jove ! I must shake hands with you ; I must indeed ! Poor Reardon ! Poor old fellow ! '
204400	204409	204411	204411	Jasper	186	' It has been written for three months , '
204413	204620	204411	204411	Jasper	186	' but we have held it over for a practical reason . When I was engaged upon it , I went to see Mortimer , and asked him if there was any chance of a new edition of Reardon 's books . He had no idea the poor fellow was dead , and the news seemed really to affect him . He promised to consider whether it would be worth while trying a new issue , and before long I heard from him that he would bring out the two best books with a decent cover and so on , provided I could get my article on Reardon into one of the monthlies . This was soon settled . The editor of The Wayside answered at once , when I wrote to him , that he should be very glad to print what I proposed , as he had a real respect for Reardon . Next month the books will be out — " Neutral Ground , " and " Hubert Reed . " Mortimer said he was sure these were the only ones that would pay for themselves . But we shall see . He may alter his opinion when my article has been read . '
204621	204633	204635	204635	Dora	188	' Read it to us now , Jasper , will you ? '
204766	204775	204777	204777	Whelpdale	207	' I never understood Reardon so well before , '
204783	204803	204777	204777	Whelpdale	207	' This is a good thing well done . It 's something to be proud of , Miss Dora . '
204804	204813	204814	204814	she	188	' Yes , I feel that it is , '
204817	204842	204814	204814	she	188	' Mrs. Reardon ought to be very grateful to you , Milvain . By - the - by , do you ever see her ? '
204843	204857	204777	204777	Whelpdale	207	' I have met her only once since his death — by chance . '
204858	204875	204814	204814	she	188	' Of course she will marry again . I wonder who 'll be the fortunate man ? '
204876	204883	204885	204885	Dora	188	' Fortunate , do you think ? '
204893	204902	204885	204885	Dora	188	' Oh , I spoke rather cynically , I 'm

Dora gave him a look of strong disapproval ; one might have suspected that brother and sister had before this fallen into disagreement on the delicate topic . Whelpdale felt obliged to interpose , and had of course no choice but to support the girl . '

I am informed that the new edition of " On Neutral Ground " and " Hubert Reed " will be ready next month . Need I say how glad I am that my friend 's work is not to be forgotten ? '

Had he welcomed it as offering a possibility of their marriage , that would have gladdened her , though it would then have been necessary to show him all the difficulties by which she was beset ; for some time they had not spoken of her father 's position , and Jasper seemed willing to forget all about that complication of their troubles . But marriage did not occur to him , and he was evidently quite prepared to hear that she could no longer regard this money as her own to be freely disposed of . This was on one side a relief , but on the other it confirmed her fears . She would rather have heard him plead with her to neglect her parents for the sake of being his wife . Love excuses everything , and his selfishness would have been easily lost sight of in the assurance that he still desired her . '

210386	210446	210376	210376	he	511	' that I make no exclusive claim to the use of this room . As I can no longer pretend to study , it would be idle to keep up the show of privacy that must n't be disturbed . Perhaps you will mention to your mother that she is quite at liberty to sit here whenever she chooses . '

211297	211387	211190	211190	She	188	' I agree to that ; and in return I shall let you know when she begins to suffer from hunger . It wo n't be very long till then , you may be sure . How do you suppose three people are going to live on a hundred a year ? And it 's very doubtful indeed whether Marian can earn as much as fifty pounds . Never mind ; I shall let you know when she is beginning to strave , and doubtless that will amuse you . '

This was posted on the morrow , and its writer continued to benefit most remarkably by the sun and breezes and rock - scrambling of Sark . Soon after their return to London , Dora had the satisfaction of paying the first visit to her sister at the Dolomores '

Whether I marry Marian or Miss Rupert , I sacrifice my strongest feelings — in the one case to a sense of duty , in the other to worldly advantage . I was an idiot to write that letter , for I knew at the time that there was a woman who is far more to me than Miss Rupert and all her money — a woman I might , perhaps , marry . Do n't ask any questions ; I shall not answer them . As I have said so much , I wished you to understand my position fully . You know the promise I have made . Do n't say anything to Marian ; if I am left free I shall marry her as soon as possible . '

217297	217669	217293	217293	I	0	' Biffen had waved his hand , and was gone . A week or two more would see him at the end of his money . He had no lessons now , and could not write ; from his novel nothing was to be expected . He might apply again to his brother , but such dependence was unjust and unworthy . And why should he struggle to preserve a life which had no prospect but of misery ? It was in the hours following his encounter with Whelpdale that he first knew the actual desire of death , the simple longing for extinction . One must go far in suffering before the innate will - to - live is thus truly overcome ; weariness of bodily anguish may induce this perversion of the instincts ; less often , that despair of suppressed emotion which had fallen upon Harold . Through the night he kept his thoughts fixed on death in its aspect of repose , of eternal oblivion . And herein he had found solace . The next night it was the same . Moving about among common needs and occupations , he knew not a moment 's cessation of heart - ache , but when he lay down in the darkness a hopeful summons whispered to him . Night , which had been the worst season of his pain , had now grown friendly ; it came as an anticipation of the sleep that is everlasting . A few more days , and he was possessed by a calm of spirit such as he had never known . His resolve was taken , not in a moment of supreme conflict , but as the result of a subtle process by which his imagination had become in love with death . Turning from contemplation of life 's one rapture , he looked with the same intensity of desire to a state that had neither fear nor hope . One afternoon he went to the Museum Reading - room , and was busy for a few minutes in consultation of a volume which he took from the shelves of medical literature . On his way homeward he entered two or three chemists '

218827	218889	218890	218890	He	278	' Dear Mr. Milvain , — I am distressed beyond measure to read in this morning 's newspaper that poor Mr. Biffen has put an end to his life . Doubtless you can obtain more details than are given in this bare report of the discovery of his body . Will you let me hear , or come and see me ? '
219017	219055	218990	218990	He	278	' I suppose there was no alternative between that and starvation . I scarcely thought of Biffen as likely to kill himself . If Reardon had done it , I should n't have felt the least surprise . '
219056	219068	219070	219070	Dora	188	' Mr. Whelpdale will be bringing us information , no doubt , '
219095	219153	219070	219070	Dora	188	' Really , one ca n't grieve . There seemed no possibility of his ever earning enough to live decently upon . But why the deuce did he go all the way out there ? Consideration for the people in whose house he lived , I dare say ; Biffen had a good deal of native delicacy . '
219276	219288	219289	219289	he	186	' I was ignorant of this affair when your letter came , '
219292	219302	219289	219289	he	186	' and I set out immediately to see you . '
219303	219324	219251	219251	he	186	' I hoped you would bring me some news . What can have driven the poor man to such extremity ? '
219325	219350	219289	219289	he	186	' Poverty , I can only suppose . But I will see Whelpdale . I had n't come across Biffen for a long time . '
219351	219359	219361	219361	Amy	191	' Was he still so very poor ? '
219365	219367	219361	219361	Amy	191	' I 'm

219400	219455	219456	219456	He	186	' — So often the regretful remark of one 's friends , when one has been permitted to perish . With Amy 's sorrow was mingled a suggestion of tenderness which came of her knowledge that the dead man had worshipped her . Perchance his death was in part attributable to that hopeless love . '
219465	219469	219456	219456	He	186	' she said , '
219495	219601	219492	219492	I	0	' Having this subject to converse upon put the two more quickly at ease than could otherwise have been the case . Jasper was closely observant of the young widow ; her finished graces made a strong appeal to his admiration , and even in some degree awed him . He saw that her beauty had matured , and it was more distinctly than ever of the type to which he paid reverence . Amy might take a foremost place among brilliant women . At a dinner - table , in grand toilet , she would be superb ; at polite receptions people would whisper : '
219606	219614	219492	219492	I	0	' Biffen fell out of the dialogue . '

219725	219746	219709	219709	Marian	211	' fell from Amy 's lips , as she smiled . Jasper moved uncomfortably . It was a voluntary gesture . '

220231	220248	220166	220166	she	4195	' I scarcely understand . Has Marian expressed a wish to devote herself in that way ? '
220249	220274	220275	220275	he	0	' Not distinctly . But I suspect that her conscience points to it . I am in serious doubt . On the one hand , '
220283	220325	220275	220275	he	0	' who will not blame me if our engagement terminates in circumstances such as these ? On the other — you are aware , by - the - by , that her father objects in the strongest way to this marriage ? '

220336	220379	220166	220166	she	4195	' He will neither see me nor hear of me . Merely because of my connection with Fadge . Think of that poor girl thus situated . And I could so easily put her at rest by renouncing all claim upon her . '

220415	220506	220412	220412	he	0	' What you have said is true . And really , why should I not be glad of it ? I could n't go about declaring that I was heart - broken , in any event ; I must be content for people to judge me according to their disposition , and judgments are pretty sure to be unfavourable . What can I do ? In either case I must to a certain extent be in the wrong . To tell the truth , I was wrong from the first . '
220533	220547	220522	220522	she	4196	' The case is too delicate , I fear , for my advice . '
220548	220589	220412	220412	he	0	' Yes , I feel it ; and perhaps I ought n't to have spoken of it at all . Well , I 'll go back to my scribbling . I am so very glad to have seen you again . '
220590	220612	220614	220614	Jasper	186	' It was good of you to take the trouble to come — whilst you have so much on your mind . '
220819	220830	220815	220815	He	186	' You 've heard that Harold Biffen has committed suicide ? '

220939	220965	220966	220966	She	211	' Well , it remains to be seen how I shall come out when I am weighted with graver cares than I have yet known . '
220976	220987	220988	220988	he	186	' I have made up my mind about our affairs , '

221030	221045	221046	221046	Her	211	' Yes . Will you marry me , and let us take our chance ? '
221051	221075	221046	221046	Her	211	' You do n't mean at once , Jasper ? You would wait until I know what father 's fate is to be ? '
221076	221096	220988	220988	he	186	' Well , now , there 's the point . You feel yourself indispensable to your father at present ? '
221097	221152	221153	221153	She	211	' Not indispensable , but — would n't it seem very unkind ? I should be so afraid of the effect upon his health , Jasper . So much depends , we are told , upon his general state of mind and body . It would be dreadful if I were the cause of — '
221163	221227	221153	221153	She	211	' I understand that . But let us face our position . Suppose the operation is successful ; your father will certainly not be able to use his eyes much for a long time , if ever ; and perhaps he would miss you as much then as now . Suppose he does not regain his sight ; could you then leave him ? '
221228	221268	221399	221399	he	4204	' Dear , I ca n't feel it would be my duty to renounce you because my father had become blind . And if he can see pretty well , I do n't think I need remain with him . '
221269	221293	221399	221399	he	4204	' Has one thing occurred to you ? Will he consent to receive an allowance from a person whose name is Mrs. Milvain ? '
221294	221301	221302	221302	she	4203	' I ca n't be sure , '
221308	221323	221302	221302	she	4203	' And if he obstinately refuses — what then ? What is before him ? '
221334	221345	221346	221346	she	4203	' Why have you changed your mind so , Jasper ? '
221351	221388	221346	221346	she	4203	' Because I have decided that the indefinitely long engagement would be unjust to you — and to myself . Such engagements are always dangerous ; sometimes they deprave the character of the man or woman . '
221395	221398	221399	221399	he	4204	' Everything , '
221403	221452	221399	221399	he	4204	' would be simple enough but for your domestic difficulties . As I have said , there is the very serious doubt whether your father would accept money from you when you are my wife . Then again , shall we be able to afford such an allowance ? '
221453	221462	221399	221399	he	4204	' I thought you felt sure of that ? '

In such an admirable social order as ours , they were bound to go to the dogs . Let us be sorry for them , but let us recognise causas rerum , as Biffen would have said . You have exercised ingenuity and perseverance ; you have your reward . '

224818	224858	224647	224647	Jasper	186	' I admit that you have run the gauntlet , and that you have had marvellous escapes . But be good enough to leave me alone for the present . I must finish this review by mid - day . '
224859	224911	224647	224647	Jasper	186	' Only one word . I do n't know how to thank Dora , how to express my infinite sense of her goodness . Will you try to do so for me ? You can speak to her with calmness . Will you ell her what I have said to you ? '
224912	224939	224787	224787	He	4279	' Oh , certainly . — I should recommend a cooling draught of some kind . Look in at a chemist 's as you walk on . '
225085	225090	225091	225091	he	186	' Upon my word , '
225094	225116	225091	225091	he	186	' I am proud of my sisters ! What did you think of Maud last night ? Was n't she superb ? '
225117	225134	225330	225330	He	4284	' She certainly did look very well . But I doubt if she 's very happy . '
225135	225162	225330	225330	He	4284	' That is her own look out ; I told her plainly enough my opinion of Dolomore . But she was in such a tremendous hurry . '
225163	225187	225091	225091	he	186	' You are detestable , Jasper ! Is it inconceivable to you that a man or woman should be disinterested when they marry ? '
225188	225193	225330	225330	He	4284	' By no means . '
225194	225207	225330	225330	He	4284	' Maud did n't marry for money any more than I did . '
225208	225312	225091	225091	he	186	' You remember the Northern Farmer : " Doän't thou marry for money , but go where money is . " An admirable piece of advice . Well , Maud made a mistake , let us say . Dolomore is a clown , and now she knows it . Why , if she had waited , she might have married one of the leading men of the day . She is fit to be a duchess , as far as appearance goes ; but I was never snobbish . I care very little about titles ; what I look to is intellectual distinction . '
225313	225319	225330	225330	He	4284	' Combined with financial success . '
225320	225329	225330	225330	He	4284	' Why , that is what distinction means . '
225339	225358	225330	225330	He	4284	' You are not uncomfortable here , old girl . I wish mother could have lived till now . '
225359	225368	225369	225369	Dora	188	' I wish it very , very often , '
225376	225420	225369	225369	Dora	188	' We have n't done badly , drawbacks considered . Now you may speak of money as scornfully as you like ; but suppose you had married a man who could only keep you in lodgings ? How would life look to you ? '
225421	225442	225330	225330	He	4284	' Who ever disputed the value of money ? But there are things one must n't sacrifice to gain it . '
225443	225467	225468	225468	Dora	188	' I suppose so . Well , I have some news for you , Dora . I am thinking of following your example . '
225476	225482	225468	225468	Dora	188	' And who is it ? '
225483	225487	225488	225489	His sister	407	' Amy Reardon . '
225500	225509	225510	225510	he	4286	' You see , I am disinterested myself , '
225514	225533	225510	225510	he	4286	' I might find a wife who had wealth and social standing . But I choose Amy deliberately . '
225534	225539	225330	225330	He	4284	' An abominable choice ! '
225540	225583	225468	225468	Dora	188	' No ; an excellent choice . I have never yet met a woman so well fitted to aid me in my career . She has a trifling sum of money , which will be useful for the next year or two — '
225584	225597	225510	225510	he	4286	' What has she done with the rest of it , then ? '
225598	225654	225330	225330	He	4284	' Oh , the ten thousand is intact , but it ca n't be seriously spoken of . It will keep up appearances till I get my editorship and so on . We shall be married early in August , I think . I want to ask you if you will go and see her . '
225655	225668	225669	225669	Jasper	186	' On no account ! I could n't be civil to her . '
225674	225697	225669	225669	Jasper	186	' This is idiotic prejudice , Dora . I think I have some claim upon you ; I have shown some kindness — '
225698	225726	225330	225330	He	4284	' You have , and I am not ungrateful . But I dislike Mrs. Reardon , and I could n't bring myself to be friendly with her . '
225727	225734	225330	225330	He	4284	' You do n't know her . '
225735	225760	225669	225669	Jasper	186	' Too well . You yourself have taught me to know her . Do n't compel me to say what I think of her . '
225761	225803	225330	225330	He	4284	' She is beautiful , and high - minded , and warm - hearted . I do n't know a womanly quality that she does n't possess . You will offend me most seriously if you speak a word against her . '
225804	225821	225330	225330	He	4284	' Then I will be silent . But you must never ask me to meet her . '
225822	225825	225669	225669	Jasper	186	' Never ? '
225826	225829	225330	225330	He	4284	' Never ! '
225830	225886	225330	225330	He	4284	' Then we shall quarrel . I have n't deserved this , Dora . If you refuse to meet my wife on terms of decent friendliness , there 's no more intercourse between your house and mine . You have to choose . Persist in this fatuous obstinacy , and I have done with you ! '
225887	225892	225669	225669	Jasper	186	' So be it ! '
225893	225900	225330	225330	He	4284	' That is your final answer ? '
225958	225963	225964	225964	he	4288	' My dear wife , '
225974	226010	225964	225964	he	4288	' you are right , a thousand times , but it 's impossible for you to be on ill terms with Jasper . There 's no need for you to see much of Mrs. Reardon — '
226011	226027	226072	226073	Mrs. Whelpdale	401	' I hate her ! She killed her husband ; I am sure of it . '
226028	226032	225964	225964	he	4288	' My darling ! '
226033	226062	225964	225964	he	4288	' I mean by her base conduct . She is a cold , cruel , unprincipled creature ! Jasper makes himself more than ever contemptible by marrying her . '
226597	226608	226585	226586	The novelist	4736	' Is it true that Fadge is leaving The Current ? '
226609	226617	226631	226632	a lady	4994	' It is rumoured , I believe . '
226618	226629	226631	226632	a lady	4994	' Going to one of the quarterlies , they say , '
226634	226665	226631	226632	a lady	4994	' He is getting terribly autocratic . Have you heard the delightful story of his telling Mr. Rowland to persevere , as his last work was one of considerable promise ? '
226758	226787	226788	226788	Jasper	186	' Thomas always maintains that it was killed by that solemn old stager , Alfred Yule . By the way , he is dead himself , I hear . '
226792	226798	226788	226788	Jasper	186	' Alfred Yule is dead ? '
226799	226825	226826	226828	All the guests	4327	' So Jedwood told me this morning . He died in the country somewhere , blind and fallen on evil days , poor old fellow . '
226845	226849	226851	226852	the novelist	4736	' I believe , '
226854	226885	226851	226852	the novelist	4736	' that he had a clever daughter who used to do all the work he signed . That used to be a current bit of scandal in Fadge 's circle . '
226886	226896	226898	226898	Jasper	186	' Oh , there was much exaggeration in that , '
226902	226926	226898	226898	Jasper	186	' His daughter assisted him , doubtless , but in quite a legitimate way . One used to see her at the Museum . '
227004	227009	227010	227010	he	186	' Look at this ! '
227080	227094	227066	227066	her	4333	' So soon ! Oh , this is great ! this is glorious ! '
227095	227128	227048	227048	they	4334	' Do you think this would have been offered to me but for the spacious life we have led of late ? Never ! Was I right in my calculations , Amy ? '
227129	227136	227137	227137	He	186	' Did I ever doubt it ? '
227152	227159	227137	227137	He	186	' Does n't the future brighten ? '
227160	227177	227048	227048	they	4334	' It has been very bright to me , Jasper , since I became your wife . '
227178	227196	227197	227197	They	4337	' And I owe my fortune to you , dear girl . Now the way is smooth ! '
227238	227248	227249	227249	He	186	' I am told that your uncle is dead . '
227258	227334	227249	227249	He	186	' I must make inquiries to - morrow . I suppose there will be a notice in The Study , and some of the other papers . I hope somebody will make it an opportunity to have a hit at that ruffian Fadge . By - the - by , it does n't much matter now how you speak of Fadge ; but I was a trifle anxious when I heard your story at dinner . '
227335	227353	227231	227231	Milvain	186	' Oh , you can afford to be more independent . — What are you thinking about ? '
227354	227357	227231	227231	Milvain	186	' Nothing . '
227358	227381	227249	227249	He	186	' Why do you look sad ? — Yes , I know , I know . I 'll try to forgive you . '
227382	227435	227231	227231	Milvain	186	' I ca n't help thinking at times of the poor girl , Amy . Life will be easier for her now , with only her mother to support . Someone spoke of her this evening , and repeated Fadge 's lie that she used to do all her father 's writing . '
227436	227463	227231	227231	Milvain	186	' She was capable of doing it . I must seem to you rather a poor - brained woman in comparison . Is n't it true ? '
227464	227531	227249	227249	He	186	' My dearest , you are a perfect woman , and poor Marian was only a clever school - girl . Do you know , I never could help imagining that she had ink - stains on her fingers . Heaven forbid that I should say it unkindly ! It was touching to me at the time , for I knew how fearfully hard she worked . '
227532	227542	227231	227231	Milvain	186	' She nearly ruined your life ; remember that . '
227547	227562	227543	227543	Jasper	186	' You will never confess it , and that is a fault in you . '
227563	227570	227249	227249	He	186	' She loved me , Amy . '
227571	227587	227249	227249	He	186	' Perhaps ! as a school - girl loves . But you never loved her . '
227588	227591	227543	227543	Jasper	186	' No . '
227600	227609	227592	227592	Amy	191	' Her image is very faint before me , '
227613	227673	227674	227674	She	4340	' and soon I shall scarcely be able to recall it . Yes , you are right ; she nearly ruined me . And in more senses than one . Poverty and struggle , under such circumstances , would have made me a detestable creature . As it is , I am not such a bad fellow , Amy . '
227682	227826	227674	227674	She	4340	' No , I am far from a bad fellow . I feel kindly to everyone who deserves it . I like to be generous , in word and deed . Trust me , there 's many a man who would like to be generous , but is made despicably mean by necessity . What a true sentence that is of Landor 's : " It has been repeated often enough that vice leads to misery ; will no man declare that misery leads to vice ? " I have much of the weakness that might become viciousness , but I am now far from the possibility of being vicious . Of course there are men , like Fadge , who seem only to grow meaner the more prosperous they are ; but these are exceptions . Happiness is the nurse of virtue . '
227827	227835	227674	227674	She	4340	' And independence the root of happiness . '
227836	227899	227674	227674	She	4340	' True . " The glorious privilege of being independent " — yes , Burns understood the matter . Go to the piano , dear , and play me something . If I do n't mind , I shall fall into Whelpdale 's vein , and talk about my " blessedness . " Ha ! is n't the world a glorious place ? '
227900	227905	227674	227674	She	4340	' For rich people . '
227906	227934	227674	227674	She	4340	' Yes , for rich people . How I pity the poor devils ! — Play anything . Better still if you will sing , my nightingale ! '
