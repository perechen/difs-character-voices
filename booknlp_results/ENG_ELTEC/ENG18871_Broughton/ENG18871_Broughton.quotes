1687	1888	1902	1903	Esther Craven	148	" JACK and I got in our last hayload to - day , without a drop of rain ; the first bit of good luck that has come to us , I do n't know when . If we had any land , I should imagine that we must have a bit of consecrated ground among it , to account for our ill - fortune ; but as we have not of our own enough to pasture a goose upon , that can not be it . Such an odd thing happened to - day — Robert Brandon proposed to me : it is the first offer I ever had , though I was seventeen last month . If it is never a more pleasant process than it was to - day , I hope sincerely it may be the last . I said ' Yes , ' too ; at least , a species of Yes after half - a - dozen Noes ; I can not imagine why , for I certainly did not feel Yes . I suppose I must have been pleased at any one wishing for my company during the term of his natural life . "

4198	4211	4212	4212	he	166	" That was why I was in such a hurry to speak , "
4216	4237	4212	4212	he	166	" I felt sure that if I did not , you would be snapped up directly by some one else . "

4301	4362	4279	4279	Esther	148	" Shall I upset the writing - table and make a rush past him ? No , the ink would spoil the carpet , and he would only come again to - morrow , and hunt me into the other corner . Poor fellow ! I hope he is not going to cry , or go down on his knees ! "
4433	4475	4414	4414	He	166	" Well , I suppose I must not worry you any more ; it is not good manners , is it ? A man ought to be satisfied with one No ; I have given you the trouble of saying three . "
4476	4486	4488	4488	Esther	148	" It 's very disagreeable , I 'm sure , "
4499	4534	4488	4488	Esther	148	" and I hate saying No to any one : I do n't mean in this way , because nobody ever asked me before , but about anything ; but what can I do ? "
4535	4539	4540	4540	he	166	" Try me ! "
4563	4651	4540	4540	he	166	" I do n't want to threaten you , saying that I should go to the dogs if you threw me over , for I should not ; that always seemed to me a cowardly sort of thing to do ; and , besides , I should have my mother left to live for if the worst came to the worst ; but you must see that it is everything in the world to a fellow to have one great hope in it to keep him straight .

4812	4849	4851	4851	she	148	" Why , I did not relish the idea of being found driven into a corner , like a child at a dame 's school , and you , like the dame , standing over me , "
4909	4916	4918	4918	Esther	148	" It really is so silly , "
4926	4936	4918	4918	Esther	148	" Do try and get the better of it ! "
4937	4943	4944	4944	he	146	" Easier said than done , "
4948	4965	4944	4944	he	146	" I might as well advise you to get the better of your affection for Jack . "
4966	4974	4976	4976	she	148	" I do n't see the parallel , "
4990	5042	4976	4976	she	148	" My love for Jack is a natural instinct , built too upon the foundation of lifelong obligations , endless benefits , countless kindnesses . What kindness have I ever shown you ? I sewed a button on your glove once , and once I pinned a rose on your coat . "
5043	5050	5051	5051	She	148	" I have the rose still . "
5053	5056	5051	5051	She	148	" Pshaw ! "
5065	5076	5078	5078	Brandon	166	" Perhaps you are afraid of marrying on small means ? "
5130	5140	5141	5141	she	148	" I am afraid of marrying on any means , "
5146	5169	5141	5141	she	148	" I particularly dislike the idea ; marriage seems to me the end of everything , and I am at the beginning . "
5170	5182	5184	5184	Robert	147	" But I do n't want you to marry me now , "
5188	5202	5184	5184	Robert	147	" Do n't you ? You told me just now that you did . "
5203	5229	5141	5141	she	148	" For pity 's sake , Esther , do n't laugh ! it may be play to you , but it is death to me . "
5230	5236	5184	5184	Robert	147	" I 'm not laughing . "
5237	5250	5184	5184	Robert	147	" Perhaps some day you will feel what I am feeling now . "
5251	5253	5141	5141	she	148	" Perhaps "
5258	5271	5141	5141	she	148	" And you will find then that it is no laughing matter . "
5272	5274	5184	5184	Robert	147	" Perhaps "
5302	5305	5312	5312	his	147	" Esther ! "
5328	5338	5312	5312	his	147	" I could live upon such a little hope . "
5339	5347	5348	5348	she	692	" What would you have me say ? "
5363	5423	5348	5348	she	692	" I have told you the plain truth , and it does not please you ; must I dress up some pretty falsehood , and tell you that I fell in love with you at first sight , or that after all I find that you are the only man in the world that can make me really happy ? "
5424	5431	5432	5432	he	147	" Say nothing of the kind ! "
5440	5491	5432	5432	he	147	" I have not much to recommend me , we all know that , and I start with the disadvantage of your thinking me rather a bore than otherwise ; but other men have overcome even greater obstacles ; why should not I ? Give me at least a trial ! "
5496	5514	5492	5492	She	692	" Say that you will try to like me ; there need be no untruth in that . "
5515	5521	5523	5523	Esther	148	" But if I fail ! "
5553	5585	5586	5586	He	694	" If you fail you will not have to tell me so ; I shall find it out for myself , and — and I shall bear it , I suppose . "
5598	5622	5586	5586	He	694	" And you will console yourself by telling all your friends what a flirt I am , and how ill I treated you . "
5642	5654	5636	5636	he	694	" Or , if you do n't , your mother will . "
5655	5658	5624	5624	he	694	" Not she "
5663	5675	5636	5636	he	694	" Or , if she does not , your sisters will . "
5676	5679	5636	5636	he	694	" Not they "
5685	5747	5748	5748	He	694	" And if — if — after a long while — a very long while — I succeed in liking you a little — mind , I do n't say that I shall ; on contrary , I think it far more probable that I shall not — but if I do , you wo n't expect me to marry you ? "
5754	5761	5748	5748	He	694	" I can hardly promise that . "
5762	5791	5636	5636	he	694	" I mean not for many years , till Jack is married , and I am quite , quite old — five - and - twenty or so ? "
5792	5800	5748	5748	He	694	" It shall be as you wish . "
5801	5835	5748	5748	He	694	" And if , as is most likely , I continue not to care about you , and am obliged to tell you so , you will not think the worse of me . "
5836	5839	5636	5636	he	694	" No . "
5840	5845	5748	5748	He	694	" You are certain ? "
5846	5869	5871	5873	the young fellow	695	" Certain . Whatever you do , I shall love you to - day , and to - morrow , and always , "
5970	5979	5960	5960	he	694	" You are longing for me to go . "
5980	5984	5960	5960	he	694	" No — o. "
5985	6011	5960	5960	he	694	" I ought not to have come at this time of night . I ought to have waited till to - morrow , I know . "
6012	6018	5960	5960	he	694	" It is rather late . "
6019	6065	5960	5960	he	694	" But to - morrow seemed such a long time off , that I thought I must know the worst or the best before the sun came up again . I do n't quite know which it is now ; which is it , Esther ? "
6066	6082	6083	6083	she	696	" It 's neither the one nor the other ; it 's the second best , "
6116	6163	5960	5960	he	694	" It is that I really am very much obliged , though , all the same I wish you would think better of it , and that I 'll try ; I will , really ; do n't look as if you did not believe me . "
6795	6834	6793	6793	Esther	148	" Have some roast chips , Essie ? I can not offer you any roast mutton , because there is n't any ; I dare say there was an hour ago , but there certainly is n't now . "
6909	6931	6933	6933	Esther	148	" It 's a fault on the right side , dear boy ; it 's better than quivering and being purple , "
6966	6996	6997	6997	he	728	" I wish that people would remember that there is a time to call and a time to dine , and that the two times are not the same , "
7092	7109	7048	7048	Christian	181	" Esther looks rather conscious , purses up her pink mouth into the shape of a noiseless "
7112	7115	7048	7048	Christian	181	" and says "
7119	7233	7048	7048	Christian	181	" which idiomatic phrase is intended to convey to her brother the indiscreetness of making comments in Sarah 's presence on Mr. Brandon 's enormities . From long familiarity with the sound , Sarah has become entirely acquainted with Esther 's specimen of Parisian French , and always pricks up her ears when it appears on the scene . Then they are silent for a little space . One is not apt to say very brilliant things in one 's family circle ; it requires the friction of mind with mind before bright sayings spring into being , as the flint and the steel must be married before the spark leaps into life . "
7241	7275	7048	7048	Christian	181	" Jack says presently , as he looks out on the evening light lying like a great bright cloak all over the land . The earth is so very fair , all pranked with "
7278	7328	7329	7329	One	559	" and green leaves , that the sun is grievously loth to leave her . Fair - weather friend as he is , he can not be in too great a hurry to desert her , when she lies poor and bare and faded in the dull November days . "
7338	7344	7329	7329	One	559	" Esther says , smiling . "
7402	7403	7405	7405	you	739	" "
7428	7436	7417	7417	you	739	" Jack answers , a little drily . "
7457	7510	7454	7454	I	0	" So , with a little flagging talk , the dinner passes , and the modest dessert appears : scarlet pyramids of strawberries , great bag - shaped British Queens , and little racy , queer - tasted hautbois . Sarah retires , and the embargo is taken off Esther 's speech . "
7518	7525	7526	7526	Heaven	182	" she cries , very eagerly . "
7591	7592	7577	7577	I	0	" "
7598	7611	7612	7612	Jack	146	" asks the boy , his eyes opening very wide and round . "

7832	7833	7836	7836	he	147	" "
7839	7848	7836	7836	he	147	" exclaims Jack , surprised into strong language . "

7872	7894	7895	7895	I	0	" asks the boy , quickly , his mouth emulating the example of his eyes , and opening wide , too . "

8167	8173	8165	8165	you	186	" said Jack , briefly . "
8183	8220	8222	8222	I	0	" she cries , running over to him and putting her gentle arms about his neck in the caressing way which sisters affect so much , and which brothers , in general , disrelish so highly , "
8235	8236	8231	8231	you	146	" "
8247	8256	8257	8257	I	0	" growls Jack , mollified , but struggling . "
8267	8268	8257	8257	I	0	" "
8279	8286	8271	8271	I	0	" she says , very gaily . "

8431	8459	8425	8425	you	146	" asks Jack ( the romantic side of whose mind lies at present fallow and uncultivated , and whose thoughts , Briton - like , speedily turn from "
8464	8479	8547	8547	you	146	" to the pound , shilling , and pence aspect of the matter ) . "
8511	8524	8503	8503	I	0	" Esther says , bursting out into a violent fit of laughing . "
8531	8544	8503	8503	I	0	" Jack says , laughing too , but sorely against his will . "
8597	8613	8582	8582	you	146	" Esther has slidden down to the floor , and sits there tailor - fashion . "
8626	8632	8614	8614	I	0	" she answers , gravely . "
8677	8678	8679	8679	Love	189	" "
8690	8699	8679	8679	Love	189	" she repeats softly , musing to herself ; "
8713	8714	8679	8679	Love	189	" "
8731	8758	8717	8717	you	146	" asks Jack , throwing back his young head , and looking in an inquisitorial manner at the penitent at his feet from under his eyelids . "
8790	8791	8781	8781	he	147	" "
8799	8807	8781	8781	he	147	" says Esther , getting rather red . "
8849	8855	8835	8835	I	0	" she says , relapsing into levity,—"poor
8860	8867	8835	8835	I	0	" ( patting them very fondly ) "

8899	8918	8895	8895	you	146	" cries Jack , with animation , shaking off her hand , and looking very indignant and honest . "
8962	8996	8951	8951	I	0	" Esther 's little head , rich in a soft plenitude of dusky love - locks , sinks low down towards her lap ; she is very easily snubbed , especially by Jack . "
9009	9028	9006	9007	Miss Essie	180	" pursues the young Solomon , severely , still brandishing the metaphorical birch - rod over his sister . "
9046	9071	9031	9031	you	146	" Esther lifts up two sudden , tearful eyes , that look like great jewels seen through running water , and says , piteously , "
9116	9117	9118	9118	I	0	" "
9133	9143	9118	9118	I	0	" says Jack , inexorable in his young severity . "

9182	9211	9180	9180	Jack	146	" cries Esther , very eagerly . She looks grave enough now ; rather alarmed at the little gay sketch her brother has drawn of her future destiny . "
9251	9252	9240	9240	he	190	" "
9263	9278	9255	9255	you	0	" asks the young fellow , not a bit disarmed by her sweet flattery . "
9374	9375	9352	9352	He	190	" "
9389	9409	9352	9352	He	190	" asks honest Jack , rather bewildered by these new lights — these subtleties on the subject of betrothal . "
9457	9498	9499	9499	I	0	" answers Esther , on the battle - field of whose small face smiles and tears are fighting . Her brother does not seem to see the beauty of this in genious mode of reasoning in a very strong light . "
9511	9548	9503	9503	you	0	" he says , very decisively , shaking a stern young head — stern , despite its curliness and its total dearth of those care - lines that are supposed to be Wisdom 's harsh footprints . "
9568	9569	9565	9566	Miss Esther	148	" "
9602	9617	9618	9618	I	0	" answers Essie , very pettishly , looking excessively mutine and ill - humoured . "
9659	10039	9649	9649	I	0	" concludes happy Mr. Brandon 's fiancée weeping . MORNING is come again . The sun can not bear to be long away from his young sweetheart , the earth , so he has come back hasting , with royal pomp , with his crown of gay gold beams on his head , with his flame - cloak about his strong shoulders , and with a great troop of light , flaky clouds — each with a reflex of his red smile on its courtier face — at his back . He has come back to see himself in the laughing blue eyes of her seas and streams , and to rest at noontide , like a sleepy giant , on her warm green lap . The daily miracle — the miracle that none can contest , to which all are witness , has been worked — the resurrection of the world . And this resurrection is not partial , not limited to humanity , as that final one is towards which the eyes of the Christian church have been looking steadfastly for eighteen centuries and a half ; but every beast and bird and flower has shaken off Death 's sweet semblance , his gentle counterfeit , and is feeling , in bounding vein and rushing sap , the ecstatic bliss of the mystery of life . If we never slept , we should not know the joy of waking ; if we never woke , we should not know the joy of sleep . How , I marvel , shall we feel the happiness of heaven , if we never lose , and consequently regain it ? The thrushes and blackbirds are already in the midst of their glees and madrigals and part songs . They sing the same songs every day , so that they are quite perfect in them ; and they are all very joyful ones . In their sweet flute - language there are no words expressive of sorrow or pain ; they know of no minor key . There were twenty roses born last night , and the flowers are all rejoicing greatly . They are smiling and whispering and gossiping together ; the sweet peas , like pink and purple butterflies , "
10056	10747	9649	9649	I	0	" each half - inclined to hover away with the young west wind that is sighing such a little gentle story all about himself into their ears . The lambs , grown so big and woolly that one might almost mistake them for their mothers , are leaping and racing and plunging about in the field below the house , in the giddiness of youth , unprescient of the butcher . Hated of Miss Craven 's soul as much as ever were the blind and lame of King David 's are those too , too agile sheep . Grievously prone are they to ignore the low stone wall of partition , and work havoc and devastation among the aster tops and cabbage shoots of her garden . The King of Glan - yr - Afon is not counting out his money , because he has not any to count , poor young fellow . He is sitting on a garden - chair , reading the Times , and thinking how much better he would rule the Fatherland , how much less mean and shabby and selfish he would make her in other nations ' eyes , if he might but have the whip and reins for six months or so . Old Luath lies at his feet , with dim eyes half closed , snapping lazily at the flies , and catching on an average about one every quarter of an hour . Esther is in the stack - yard , holding a levy of ravenous fowls . She has tied a large white kitchen - apron round her waist ; with one hand she is holding it up , with the other she is scattering light wheat among a mixed multitude . Baby Cochins , in primrose velvet ; hobbledehoy Cochins , au naturel , with not a stitch of clothes on their bare , indecent backs ; adult Cochins , muffled and smothered up to the chin in a wealth of cinnamon feathers , and with cinnamon stockings down to their heels ; Rouen ducks , and scraggy - necked turkeys . She is doing her very best to administer justice to her commonwealth , to protect the weak , to prevent aggression and violence ; but like many another lawgiver she finds it rather up - hill work . Strive as she may , the ducks get far the best of it . They have no sense of shame , and can shovel up such a quantity at a time in their long yellow bills . The turkey - cock , on the other hand , gets much the worst , by reason of the long red pendant to his nose , that gets in his way and hinders him . They say that Nature never makes anything for ornament alone , divorced from use ; but I confess to being ignorant as to what function that long flabby dangler has to fulfil . The stack - yard is all on the slant ; it slopes down with its many stack - frames , to the old rough grey barn that is stained all over - walls and roof and door — with the stormy tears of a score of winters . There is no lack of voices all about the farm to - day : voice of Sarah chattering in the drying ground , where she is hanging Esther 's cotton gowns and Jack 's shirts on the lines ; voice of Evan Evans , the carter , talking friendly to his heavy team in that deplorable tongue which , we trust , will soon be among the abuses of the past ; voice of Seryn ( Welsh for Star ) , from the pasture , lowing for her calf , which a day ago became veal , and a day hence ( Oh blessed short memory ! why can not we take lessons from a cow ? ) she will have forgotten utterly . Presently comes another voice , clearer , stronger , nearer than the others — comes sailing up through the July air . "
10752	10753	10754	10754	Ye	783	" "
10758	10796	10754	10754	Ye	783	" responds Esther at the tip - top of her voice , and consequently not particularly harmonious . It is only the lark that can talk at the top of his voice and yet not be shrill . "
10801	10806	10799	10799	you	783	" ( Forte . ) "
10813	10869	10799	10799	you	783	" ( Fortissimo ) . Obedient to this direction , in about two minutes the owner of the voice , and of the excellent lungs which sent it out , makes his appearance in loose cool clothes and a smile — Jack , in fact , looking very ugly and pleasant and good - natured . "
10899	10969	10972	10978	a person in the drawing - room	786	" cries Esther , in great excitement , rushing wildly about in her big apron , in pursuit of a large drake with a grasping soul , and a wonderful rainbow neck , who , with bill wide open and wings half extended , is waddling , flying , quacking away from Nemesis as hard as his splay feet and his full crop will let him . Jack obeys . "
10985	11004	11005	11009	What sort of a person	788	" he says , leaning his arms on the top of the gate , and looking rather malicious . "
11011	11037	11039	11039	he	146	" Esther asks abstractedly , craning her long neck round the corner of the barn , to see whether the drake shows symptoms of returning . "
11045	11046	11039	11039	he	146	" "
11088	11134	11086	11086	Bob	190	" Esther 's apron drops from her fingers and the wheat rolls down in a shower on to the broad backs of the Cochin householders . Fiercely the war of chickens — the pushing , the fluttering , the pecking — rages about her feet . "
11137	11190	11086	11086	Bob	190	" she says : and in her voice there is none of love 's sweet quiver , nor on her cheeks is there any sign of love 's pretty flag being hung out , neither the red nor the white one . She only looks a little blank — a little troubled . "
11195	11201	11206	11206	he	789	" says Jack , mercilessly ; "
11268	11269	11240	11241	a notary	796	" "
11272	11295	11240	11241	a notary	796	" says Esther , and she comes all over to the gate , and clasps two little petitioning hands on his shoulder . "
11308	11309	11311	11311	I	0	" "
11313	11319	11311	11311	I	0	" says Jack , stoutly . "
11367	11368	11369	11369	Jack	146	" "
11377	11392	11369	11369	Jack	146	" stroking it down with the improvised brush and comb of her slim fingers . "
11414	11560	11369	11369	Jack	146	" Meanwhile Master Brandon and his old women , to wit , his mother , Mrs. Brandon , and his sisters , the two Misses Brandon , are posed about the drawing - room , waiting . Waiting is always a painful process , from the modified form of suffering involved in the ten minutes before dinner , when every man 's tongue is tied , and his wits congealed by the frost of expectant hunger ; upward to the Gehenna of a dentist 's antechamber . Robert is all on wires this morning : he can not sit still ; he keeps shuffling and twisting his long , awkward legs about , beating the devil 's tattoo on the floor with his nailed boots , and hammering an ugly little tune with a paper knife on an old Book of Beauty on the table . "
11567	11646	11369	11369	Jack	146	" cries his sister Bessy . Miss Elizabeth Brandon is ten years older and about ten feet shorter than her brother ; she is in process of souring , like cowslip wine that has been kept too long , or small beer in thunder . She is not so very sour , after all , poor little virgin ! only ten years ago she was , and ten years hence she will be mellower than she is now . "
11650	11654	11655	11655	I	0	" says Bob , "
11659	11725	11655	11655	I	0	" and he stops , only to commence , two seconds later , a new noise , seven times worse than the first ; a very disagreeable sort of scraping with the hind legs of his chair . Is not it one of Miss Yonge 's goody heroes , who , when he feels disposed to be impatient , sits down and strums away at the "
11729	11752	11655	11655	I	0	" Bob could not get through a bar of that soothing melody this morning . Mrs. Brandon is just beginning to say , "
11763	11827	11756	11757	the servant	800	" when the door opens , and a little vision comes in with delicate hair ruffling about her sweet , shining eyes ; a little vision that ought to be walking on rosy clouds , Bob thinks , with cherubim and seraphim holding up her train , instead of on shabby oil - cloth and faded carpet , dragging her train behind her . "
11846	11894	11830	11830	I'm	0	" ( did not expect you so early is on the tip of her tongue , but she remembers just in time that it would be about the impolitest remark she could make . Never , until the millennium , will the marriage of Truth and Civility be solemnized)—"did
11910	11933	11901	11901	Jack	146	" she substitutes so adroitly that none of her auditors perceive the rivet that joins the two halves of her sentence together . "
11966	12099	11964	11964	him	801	" says Mrs. Brandon , nodding her head towards Bob , and looking as if there was something peculiarly humorous in the idea of Esther being in a condition to blame him for anything he could do or leave undone . Mrs. Brandon is an old woman , with a smooth , holy face , and a villainous black poke bonnet : she kisses Esther , and the Misses Brandon likewise come forward and inflict a prim sisterly salute with their thin old - maid lips , on the velvet rose - leaf of her cheek . They had never kissed her before , and she felt as if the manacles were being fastened round her wrists , and the gyves about her ankles . She longs to cry out and say , "
12157	12269	12153	12153	they	809	" Had she been alone with Robert , she would probably have said this ; have said it without much difficulty , but now the words seemed infinitely , impossibly hard to frame . There is upon her the shyness of a young woman with an old one ; the shyness of one against three . She feels , too , that it seems ungracious , churlish , when they are so glad to take her in to themselves , to adopt her as their own , not to be very glad too . When a person says to one , if not in words , yet with looks and gestures , "
12283	12296	12280	12280	thy	812	" it is not easy for a plastic , gracious nature to say "
12303	12511	12512	12512	You	816	" however little they may relish the arrangement . So , in her muteness , Esther accepts the Brandon God and people as hers . Wordless and demure , she sits down on a little low seat as far removed as may be from Robert . Esther will , no doubt , be an ugly old woman ; she makes rather an ugly photograph ; but who can deny that she is a delicious bit of colour as she sits there right in the eye of the morning sun , and not at all afraid of his strict scrutiny ? So many women , now - a - days , are neutral - tinted , drabbish , greyish , as if the colours that God painted with were not fast , but faded , like Reynolds ' . Esther 's colouring is as distinct , as decided , as clean and clear as that on a flower 's petal or a butterfly 's wing . Nobody speaks , except the clock with the short - waisted Minerva on it , and it does not say anything particularly original . Then the old woman bends towards the young one , and says in a kind , low voice , "
12524	12625	12514	12514	Robert	147	" There is flowing in through the French window a broad river of yellow light from the great fountain in the sky ; it is deluging Mrs. Brandon 's bonnet and Esther 's hair . The bonnet is black , and the hair is black ; but there are blacks and blacks . The May grass is green , and a beer bottle is green ; but the resemblance between the two is not striking . Esther has not the remotest idea what answer to make ; so she chooses one of the shortest words she knows of , and says "
12628	12637	12514	12514	Robert	147	" half - assentingly , half - interrogatively . "
12656	12701	12644	12644	we	817	" pursues the old lady , encouragingly . Esther says nothing . Her eyelids feel glued down to her cheeks ; she is conscious , with inward rage and vexation , of looking blushing , bashful , everything that a young betrothed should look . "
12708	12720	12704	12706	an old woman	819	" concludes Mrs. Brandon , rather moved by her own eloquence , "
12772	12811	12753	12753	God	435	" As she speaks she lays one hand on Esther 's head . Bob is happily too far off , or she would lay the other on his , while the two little virgin clerks from the sofa cry "
12814	12863	12753	12753	God	435	" in a breath . Esther is half - frightened . What with the serious words , with the three women 's solemn faces , she half feels as if she were being married on the spot ; her thoughts fly to Jack and the notary ; after that "
12866	12891	12753	12753	God	435	" she is not quite sure that her name is not Esther Brandon She shrinks away a little , but not at all rudely . "
12897	12906	12892	12892	You	824	" she says , in her gentle voice , "
12979	12990	12973	12973	he	825	" she concludes , looking rather reproachfully over at him . "
12996	13019	12991	12991	I	0	" protests poor Bob , eagerly , jumping up , upsetting his chair , and never thinking of picking it up again , "
13049	13083	13033	13033	she	826	" he ends , looking very downcast and snubbed and disconsolate . There is another pause , then Mrs. Brandon rises and puts out her hand to Esther — in farewell this time . "
13099	13119	13087	13087	I	0	" she says , trying not to speak stiffly , and not succeeding quite so well as she deserved . "
13158	13211	13130	13130	you	804	" But Miss Craven can never let well alone . She would marry Old Nick himself sooner than that his mother or sister should look askance at her , or seem hurt and grieved with her for expressing any want of relish for him , hoofs and tail and horns and all . "
13220	13239	13130	13130	you	804	" she cries , in her quick , eager way , putting up two anxious hands in deprecation ; "
13287	13349	13270	13270	I	0	" she ends , with head drooped a little , and cheeks reddened like a peach 's that the sun has been kissing all the afternoon . The stiffness goes away : nobody can be stiff for long with Esther Craven , any more than a snow - ball can remain a snow - ball under the fire 's warm gaze . "
13367	13382	13365	13365	yourself	804	" the old woman says , very gravely , yet not ill - naturedly . "
13390	13471	13383	13383	I	0	" answers the girl , naïvely , in a sort of bewilderment . Then they go , and Robert walks off with his old mother on his arm . He would walk down Pall Mall with her in that identical poke bonnet , and the two little dowdy vestals pottering behind in the most perfect unconsciousness and simplicity , even if he were to know that his brother officers , to a man , were looking out at him from the "
13473	13476	13479	13479	my	0	" windows . "
13492	13517	13479	13479	my	0	" cries Esther , flinging herself down on the oak bench in the porch , and laying her face against the cold ivy leaves . "
13537	13579	13523	13523	you	0	" responds Jack , with all a brother 's candour . Jack has been dodging behind the laurel bushes , after the fashion in which the English gentleman is fond of receiving his friends when they come to call on him . "
13621	13622	13617	13617	mamma	837	" "
13656	13663	13632	13632	I	0	" replies Jack , with philosophy . "
13691	13697	13673	13673	I	0	" says Esther , ruefully . "
13702	13727	13700	13700	Jack	146	" she concludes , laughing , yet vexed ( laughter is as often the exponent of annoyance as of enjoyment , I think ) , "
13764	14121	13761	13761	Ananias	209	" THIS world is divided into poor and rich ; into those who do things for themselves , and those who get other people to do them for them . The Cravens belong to the former class . On the afternoon of the day mentioned in my last chapter , Miss Craven is doing for herself what she had much rather that some one else should do for her . She is sitting at her sewing - machine , with a pile of huckaback cut up into towel - lengths beside her . As long as civilization remains at its present ridiculous pitch of elevation , people must have towels , and there is a prejudice in favour of hemmed versus ravelled edges . In the kitchen garden the maid - servants are all busy , picking currants and raspberries for preserving . Owen , the gardening man , is helping them ; they are combining business with pleasure ; fruit - picking with persiflage . How loudly and shrilly they laugh ! and yet loud , shrill laughter expresses mirth and cause for mirth , as well as low and silvery . Esther , grave and alone , catches herself wondering what the joke was that caused such general merriment two minutes ago . Probably , did she know it , she would not laugh at it , would see no point in it , perhaps , but she would be glad to hear it . The huckaback is thick and heavy ; bending down one 's head over one 's work sends all the blood in one 's body into it . Phew ! How hot ! How much pleasanter to be out of doors , tweaking off dead rose heads , watching the great red poppie straightening out their folded creases , pulling the green nightcaps off the escholtzia buds ! A shadow darkens the French window , causing Miss Craven to give one of those starts that make one feel as if one literally jumped out of one 's skin , and fill one with ungodly wrath against the occasion of them . "
14127	14134	14122	14122	I	0	" says Robert Brandon , apologetically , "
14139	14140	14136	14136	nobody	3405	" "
14150	14165	14145	14145	you	0	" she says , with a tone not exactly of rapture in her voice ; "
14214	14215	14216	14216	I	0	" "
14229	14242	14221	14221	you	850	" he says , hesitatingly , for her manner is not encouraging . "
14246	14276	14221	14221	you	850	" she answers , lazily , leaning her head on the back of her chair , and closing her eyes , as if his presence disposed her to sleep . "
14282	14288	14221	14221	you	850	" he rejoins , eagerly . "
14314	14315	14316	14316	I	0	" "
14320	14372	14316	14316	I	0	" she says , pettishly , annoyed at his persistence , and taking in with a dissatisfied eye his tout ensemble — yellow beard , frayed coat - sleeves , vigorous rustic comeliness . He does not pursue the subject further , but stands leaning wistfully and uncertain against the window . "
14383	14395	14379	14379	I	0	" she says , stiffly , by - and - by . "
14404	14439	14396	14396	I	0	" he answers , bluntly . She does not invite him to come in , but he , crossing the threshold diffidently , takes a seat near , but not aggressively near , her . "
14447	14597	14443	14443	me	0	" he says , deprecatingly . She takes him at his word , and continues her homely occupation . Up and down , up and down her foot goes , keeping the wheel in motion ; prick , prick , prick , the needle travels with its quick , regular stabs . If , as I have said , the process of bending over work on a July afternoon is heating , the consciousness that another person is watching every quiver of your eyelids , counting every breath you draw , and every displaced hair that straggles about brow or cheek , does not conduce to make it less so . The magnetic influence that sooner or later compels the eyes of the looked at to seek those of the looker , obliges Esther , after awhile , to raise hers — reluctant and protesting — to Robert 's . "
14606	14647	14648	14648	I	0	" he says , with a smile of placid happiness . Mr. Brandon carries his mother metaphorically upon his back , almost as much as pious Æneas did the old Anchises literally . Esther suspends her employment for a moment . "
14668	14669	14665	14665	you	0	" "
14681	14682	14675	14675	mother	826	" "

14709	14710	14714	14714	she	826	" "
14720	14740	14741	14741	she	826	" answers the girl , drily , beginning to work again faster than ever , and flushing with annoyance ; "
14784	14785	14786	14786	I	0	" "
14807	14817	14786	14786	I	0	" says Robert , triumphantly . Esther laughs awkwardly . "
14854	14855	14856	14856	She	826	" "
14869	14895	14856	14856	She	826	" ( frivolous had been the word employed by Mrs. Brandon , but Robert can not find it in his heart to apply it to his idol)—"too
14912	14922	14923	14924	Mrs. Brandon	201	" Esther gives her head a little impatient shake . "
14967	15042	15043	15043	I	0	" So speaking she relapses into a chafed silence , and he into his vigilant dumb observation of her . At the end of a quarter of an hour , as he still shows no signs of moving , finding the present position of affairs no longer tolerable , Miss Craven jumps up , flings down her heap of huckaback on the floor , and says abruptly , with a sort of forced resignation : "
15065	15066	15067	15067	I	0	" "
15075	15106	15067	15067	I	0	" he answers with provoking good humour , looking up in blissful unconsciousness at her charming cross face , and the plain yet dainty fit of her trim cheap gown . "
15112	15117	15108	15108	I	0	" she rejoins brusquely ; "
15154	15357	15140	15140	I	0	" She fetches her hat and puts it on ; too indifferent as to her appearance in his eyes to take the trouble of casting even a passing glance at herself in the glass , to see whether it is put on straight or crooked . The Glan - yr - Afon wood is a fickle , changeable place ; like a vain woman , it is always taking off one garment and putting on another . Three months ago , when the April woods were piping to it , it had on a mist - blue cloak of hyacinths — what could be prettier?—but now it has laid it aside , and is all tricked out in gay grass , green , flecked here and there with rosy families of catch - fly and groups of pur- ple orchis spires . Do you remember those words of the sweetest , wildest , fancifullest of all our singers ? They describe Glan - yr - Afon wood much better than I can . It is a great green cathedral , where choral service goes on all day long , and where the rook preaches impressive sermons from the swinging tree - tops . "
15367	15380	15381	15381	I	0	" asks Esther , sardonically , as they march along in silence . "
15404	15420	15422	15422	you	0	" He turns towards her ; an expression of surprised delight upspringing into his eyes . "
15426	15489	15422	15422	you	0	" She is mollified , despite herself , by the simple joy beaming in his poor , good - looking face — face that would be more than good - looking if only some great grief would give it fuller expression ; if only a few months of late hours and mundane dissipations would wear off its look of exuberant bucolic healthiness . "
15499	15500	15494	15494	I	0	" "
15506	15534	15494	15494	I	0	" asks Brandon , presently , pointing to a rustic seat that stands under a great girthed oak , taller and thicker - foliaged than its neighbours . "
15565	15600	15494	15494	I	0	" Esther looks , but the situation does not please her ; it is too secluded , too sentimental ; it looks like a seat on which Colin and Dowsabel might sit fluting and weaving "
15612	15625	15494	15494	I	0	" and simpering at one another over the tops of their crooks . "
15632	15641	15626	15626	I	0	" she says , beginning to walk on ; "
15646	15647	15626	15626	I	0	" "
15662	15669	15652	15652	you	0	" he exclaims , in surprise . "
15690	15947	15681	15681	I	0	" By - and - by Miss Craven finds a position that suits her better ; one nearer the edge of the wood , in full view of the Naullan road , along which market women , coal carts , stray limping tramps , go passing , and where loverly blandishments are out of the question . The sun slides down between two birch stems that stand amid rock fragments , and riots at his will about her head , as she sits at the birch foot on a great grey stone , all flourished over with green mosses and little clinging plants . Below , the baby river runs tinkling ; it is such a baby river that it has not strength to grapple with the boulders that lie in its bed ; it comes stealing round their hoary sides with a coaxing noise , in gentlest swirls and bubbled eddies . The squirrels brought their nuts last autumn to Esther 's stone to crack ; the shells are lying there still ; she is picking them up and dropping them again in idle play . Little dancing lights are flashing down through the birch 's feathery - green locks , and playing Hide and Seek over Esther 's gown and Robert 's recumbent figure , as he lies in the repose of warmth , absolute idleness , absolute content at her feet . An hour and a half , two hours to be spent in trying to like Robert ! Faugh ! She yawns . "
15962	15971	15972	15972	I	0	" remarks her lover , a little reproachfully . "
16001	16002	15984	15984	you	864	" "
16012	16013	16003	16003	You	864	" "
16036	16052	16021	16022	a woman	553	" She stretches out her arms lazily , to embrace the dry , warm air . "
16067	16074	16075	16076	Some one	686	" ( Aside . ) Aloud : "
16116	16117	16110	16110	I	0	" "
16137	16147	16148	16148	I	0	" says Bob , starting a rival masculine proposition . "
16158	16164	16148	16148	I	0	" replies Esther , exhaustively . "
16184	16185	16186	16186	You	0	" "
16191	16197	16186	16186	You	0	" says Brandon , consolingly . "
16210	16218	16219	16219	Heartsease	217	" she answers , her thoughts recurring to "
16221	16227	16219	16219	Heartsease	217	" the heroine of which is "
16234	16240	16241	16241	You	0	" before her sixteenth birthday . "
16250	16251	16253	16253	I	0	" "
16255	16269	16253	16253	I	0	" carelessly , as if such comparative statistics were profoundly uninteresting to her . "
16285	16286	16272	16272	I	0	" "
16289	16290	16272	16272	I	0	" "
16301	16312	16292	16292	you	0	" She passes by the little sentimentalism with silent contempt . "
16319	16324	16313	16313	I	0	" she says confidently . "
16368	16369	16354	16354	I	0	" "
16380	16391	16395	16395	I	0	" he cries , eagerly . She shrugs her shoulders . "
16406	16407	16395	16395	I	0	" "
16418	16424	16415	16415	I	0	" cries Brandon , cheerfully . "
16435	16436	16439	16440	a soldier	886	" "
16444	16480	16439	16440	a soldier	886	" retorts she , with a malicious smile . He laughs ; too warm and lazy and content to be offended , and makes ineffectual passes at a gnat that has settled upon his nose . "
16493	16515	16482	16482	he	146	" he asks , feeling a more personal interest than he had ever before experienced in Jack 's amours and amourettes . "
16557	16558	16559	16559	I	0	" "
16565	16566	16559	16559	I	0	" "
16588	16589	16576	16577	no one	891	" "
16609	16610	16613	16613	you	0	" "
16633	16701	16630	16630	I	0	" A pause . An old woman , with a myriad - wrinkled Welsh face rides by along the road on a drooping - headed donkey ; a large blue and orange handkerchief tied over her bonnet and a basket on each arm . Esther watches her as she jogs along with a feeling of envy . Fortunate , fortunate old woman ! she has no lover ! "
16711	16732	16704	16704	you	0	" Miss Craven says suddenly , flashing round an uneasy look out of her great black eyes at her companion . "
16742	16743	16738	16738	I	0	" "
16758	16764	16745	16745	you	0	" she cries , emphatically . "
16795	16796	16797	16797	You	0	" "
16811	16816	16797	16797	You	0	" she says drily ; "
16829	16863	16864	16864	I	0	" At the decided damper to his hilarity so evidently intended in this speech , a slight cloud passes over the young man 's face ; he looks down with a snubbed expression . "
16874	16880	16866	16866	I	0	" he says , humbly , "
16926	16967	16968	16968	Your	0	" A body free from disease , a commission in a marching regiment , a methodistical , exigeante old mother . These would seem but a poor chétif list of subjects of thankfulness to Fortune 's curled and perfumed darlings . "
16984	16992	16993	16995	The best woman	898	" says Esther , with a smile . "
17001	17002	16993	16995	The best woman	898	" "
17033	17124	17021	17021	you	0	" rejoins Esther , piqued and surprised , despite her utter indifference to his opinion of her , at finding that , notwithstanding the imbecile pitch of love for herself at which she believes him to have arrived , he can still set a dowdy , havering , brown old woman on a pedestal , above even that which she , with all the radiant red and white beauty of which she is so calmly aware , all the triumph of her seventeen sweet summers , occupies in his heart . "
17133	17139	17125	17125	You	0	" says Robert , encouragingly ; "
17157	17158	17159	17159	I	0	" "
17167	17181	17159	17159	I	0	" says Miss Craven , coolly , strangling her twenty - fifth yawn . "
17216	17259	17159	17159	I	0	" Another long pause . ( Have we been here an hour yet ? ) The brown bees go humming , droning , lumbering about , velvet - coated : a high - shouldered grasshopper chirps shrilly : the dim air vibrates . "
17266	17279	17159	17159	I	0	" says Esther , presently , for the sake of saying something . "
17322	17323	17325	17325	he	3402	" "
17327	17347	17325	17325	he	3402	" says Bob , absently , not much interested in his betrothed 's curious little piece of entomological information ; "
17351	17370	17371	17371	Esther	148	" Then dragging himself along the grass and the flowers still closer to her feet , he says , "
17390	17391	17393	17393	she	826	" "
17404	17424	17400	17400	I	0	" answers Esther , formally , with a feeling of compunction at her utter inability to echo the wish . "
17468	17469	17464	17464	mother	826	" "
17483	17490	17499	17499	her	826	" interrupts Esther , smiling drily ; "
17536	17537	17538	17538	You	908	" "
17550	17566	17538	17538	You	908	" says Robert , with an involuntary sigh and slight stress upon the word him . "
17584	17585	17573	17573	We	904	" "
17594	17621	17573	17573	We	904	" says Robert , sighing again , and thinking , ruefully , what a long time it would be before any one would say to her , "
17630	17631	17627	17628	Bob Brandon	190	" "
17646	17680	17681	17681	I	0	" she answers shortly , turning away her head . There are some people that we love so intensely that we can hardly speak even of our own love for them without tears . "
17692	17698	17681	17681	I	0	" says Bob , bluntly , "
17711	17712	17681	17681	I	0	" "
17723	17747	17715	17715	I	0	" she cries , a passionate earnestness chasing the slow languor from her voice , all her soft face afire with eager tenderness ; "
17812	17821	17810	17810	Jack	146	" she continues , in a lighter strain , "
17850	17857	17810	17810	Jack	146	" Robert looks attentive , and says "
17860	17866	17810	17810	Jack	146	" which is a sort of "
17868	17870	17810	17810	Jack	146	" or "
17873	17883	17810	17810	Jack	146	" and does not express much beyond inarticulate interest . "
17896	18005	17810	17810	Jack	146	" says the young girl , mournfully , picking an orchis leaf , and looking down absently on the capricious black splashes that freak its green surface . Bob is a little embarrassed between his love of truth and his desire to coincide in opinion with his beloved . Jack is not in the least like the little morbid boys and girls in his sister Bessy 's books , who retire into corners in play - hours to read about hell - fire , to whom marbles and toffee and bull's - eyes are as dung , and who are inextricably entangled in his mind with the idea of "
18012	18031	17884	17884	I	0	" He evades the discussion of the alarming nature of young Craven 's goodness by a judicious silence . "
18040	18058	17884	17884	I	0	" continues Esther , lugubriously , the corners of her mouth drooping like a child 's about to cry—"what
18096	18097	18099	18099	you	0	" "
18114	18172	18173	18173	He	190	" Robert answers , stroking his great , broad , yellow beard ( beard that will have to disappear before he rejoins his gallant corps in Bermuda ) , and looking very sentimental ; yet not that either , for sentimental implies the existence of a little feeling , and the affectation of a great deal more . "
18193	18194	18195	18195	I	0	" "
18201	18202	18204	18204	you	0	" "
18206	18212	18204	18204	you	0	" she says , jestingly ; "
18241	18242	18243	18243	You	0	" "
18252	18253	18254	18254	I	0	" "
18264	18320	18254	18254	I	0	" she says , giving him a smile that is grateful and bright and cold , all in one , like a January morning . Cold as her smile is , it is a smile , and he is encouraged by it to refer to a subject nearer his heart than Jack Craven 's excellences . "
18372	18387	18344	18344	you	0	" Her countenance falls , more visibly than she is herself perhaps aware of . "
18391	18400	18402	18402	you	0	" she answers , in a constrained voice , "
18417	18418	18419	18419	I	0	" "
18425	18433	18450	18450	mother	826	" says the poor young man wistfully ; "
18453	18454	18450	18450	mother	826	" "
18481	18566	18450	18450	mother	826	" interrupts Esther , with a sort of ironical playfulness , flapping about with her pocket - handkerchief at a squadron of young midges , and looking mild exasperation at the unlucky six - foot slave at her feet . Then she stretches out her hand , plucks a dandelion , or what was a dandelion a week ago , but is now a sphere of delicatest , fragilest , downspikes , and blows it like a child to see what o'clock it is . "
18584	18597	18450	18450	mother	826	" she says , flinging away the hollow stalk and springing up . "
18607	18636	18450	18450	mother	826	" says Robert , with a great sigh of good - bye , looking down at the long stretch of bruised grass that indicates his late resting- place . "
18642	18762	18638	18638	you	926	" exclaims Esther , opening her eyes very wide , and the most violent negative could not have expressed dissent more clearly . So they pass home through the loudly vocal wood , and he parts from her under the porch . He had meant to squeeze her hand at parting ; perhaps still bolder forms of adieu flitted before his mind 's eye , but a certain expression in her face makes all such plans take to their heels . He looks as if he would come in if he were asked ; but he is not asked , therefore , courage failing him , he departs . She stands in the shadow watching him , and thinks , "
18778	18814	18638	18638	you	926	" It is not the least bit higher ; no young fir is straighter than he ; but when a thing belongs , or may possibly belong , to oneself , one waxes marvellous critical . "
18821	19115	18638	18638	you	926	" cried the Athenians ; and across two thousand years we catch up and echo their greedy cry . But why do we ? We all know well enough that there is nothing new ; there was not even in King Solomon 's time — not even in all his treasure - house , nor among his seven hundred wives . What an advantage those ancients who saw the world 's infancy had over us — over us , who have to content ourselves with the lees of the wine , which the few dropped ears scattered about the great reaped harvest field ! Who would not fain have lived in the days when nothing had yet been said — when everything , consequently , remained to be said ? Who could be trite then , in that blest epoch when platitudes were unborn , when Tupper was an impossibility , and even the statement that two and two make four had something startlingly novel about it ? Then a man 's thoughts were his own , his very own , his own by the best of all rights — creation ; now they are the bastard product of ten thousand buried men 's dead ideas . Original is a pleasant word , is it not?—fair and well - sounding ; but it is like the sample figs at the top of the box : it represents nothing , or something infinitely smaller than itself behind and underneath it . Is it too much to say that it is impossible to find an original idea in any writer we wot of ? You meet , perhaps , some day in a book a thought , an image that strikes you . You say , "
19135	19365	19128	19131	this one individual mind	928	" when lo ! mayhap but a few hours later you are reading the thoughts of some elder scribe , one that has been dust nigh ten or twenty centuries back , and you find the same thought , half fledged or quarter fledged , only in the egg , perhaps — but still it is there . There is nothing new under the sun . And if this is true of other subjects , how much truer of that most outworn , threadbare old theme , Love ! The world has been spinning round six thousand years at the lowest , most exploded computation ; in any thousand years there have been thirty or forty generations , and each unit in every one of those generations , if he has lived to man 's estate , has surely loved after one fashion or another . Whosoever has done any worthy thing , whosoever has sent out his thoughts in writing or speech or action to the world , has felt the stirrings of this strange instinct ; unconsciously it has moulded and permeated his deeds and his words : and yet , old as it is , we are not tired of it , any more than we are of the back - coming green of the spring , or the never - extinguished lamps of the stars . "
19376	19662	19128	19131	this one individual mind	928	" at least well nigh ended . Jack and Esther are at breakfast : outside the scarlet geraniums are blazing away in the morning sun , trying their best to shine as brightly as he is doing , and the gnats are dancing round and round on the buoyant floor of their ball - room — the air . I wonder that that incessant valsing does not make them giddy . I am not sure that human beings , like the lions and tigers and uneasy black bears in the Zoological , look their best at feeding - time ; but such as they are , here they are . Esther in a chintz gown , sown all over with little red carnations as thickly as the firmament with heavenly bodies . She looks as fresh as a daisy — as an Englishwoman , to whom morning déshabille , wrapper , slippers , undressed hair , are unknown Gallic abominations — and is eating porridge with a spoon . Jack reading his letters , which look all bills and circulars , after the fashion of men 's correspondence ; for what man made after the fashion of a man , would sit down to indite an epistle to another man , were it his alter ego unless he had something to say about a horse or a dog or a gun ? Presently he finishes this cursory survey , crumples up the last blue envelope in his hand , flings it with manly untidiness into the summer - dressed grate , and says , resuming a conversation which had been interrupted a quarter of an hour ago by the entrance of prayers and the urn , "
19760	19761	19762	19762	I	0	" "
19786	19830	19762	19762	I	0	" says Esther , with a smile as confused as a dog 's , when , not quite sure of his reception , he sneaks up to you sideways , lifting his upper lip , and from tail to muzzle one nervous wriggle . "
19848	19849	19851	19851	you	929	" "
19870	19883	19851	19851	you	929	" Mr. Craven cries , crumbling his bread with a little irritation . "
19909	19933	19934	19934	Whereas	223	" Esther is silent ; only her head droops lower , lower , till her little nose almost immerses itself in her stirabout . "
19936	19950	19934	19934	Whereas	223	" pursues Jack , helping himself to a great deal of cold beef , "
19991	19992	19993	19993	He	930	" "
19999	20026	19997	19997	he	930	" says Esther , lifting up her nose and reddening with vexation . No woman likes to think of her empire as anything short of eternal . "
20044	20055	20056	20056	I	0	" pursues her brother , making a magnanimously handsome offer . "
20089	20090	20072	20072	she	936	" "
20100	20106	20072	20072	she	936	" cries Esther , ironically . "
20116	20117	20072	20072	she	936	" "
20126	20132	20118	20118	I	0	" replies Jack , sturdily . "
20203	20204	20215	20215	him	930	" "
20217	20238	20207	20207	I	0	" suggests Esther , blushing furiously , but holding up her head bravely , and looking straight at her brother . "
20247	20253	20254	20254	I	0	" replies Jack with incredulity . "
20272	20309	20267	20267	I	0	" says Esther , trying to make her face as brass , and failing signally . Jack puts up his hand , and strokes the future birthplace of his moustache , to hide an unavoidable smile . "
20318	20322	20310	20310	I	0	" he says ; "
20376	20377	20403	20403	Essie	180	" "
20381	20388	20403	20403	Essie	180	" cries his sister , indignantly . "
20399	20400	20403	20403	Essie	180	" "
20429	20430	20403	20403	Essie	180	" "
20440	20454	20403	20403	Essie	180	" she cries , becoming irrational , as a worsted woman mostly does . "
20464	20475	20476	20476	I	0	" This last insult is too much for Miss Craven . "
20495	20509	20510	20510	My	0	" she cries , preparing to rush from the room like a tornado . "
20514	20532	20533	20533	I	0	" says Jack , jumping up , taking her two hands , and manfully repressing his inclination to laugh—"here
20554	20555	20541	20541	I	0	" "
20580	20588	20567	20567	him	943	" asks Essie , unreasonable and sobbing . "
20606	20607	20600	20600	you	0	" "
20612	20619	20600	20600	you	0	" she says , smiling through her tears—"more
20631	20632	20633	20633	He	943	" "
20680	20681	20659	20659	he	943	" "
20701	20710	20698	20698	I	0	" remarks Miss Craven , with meek suggestion ; "
20717	20718	20719	20719	He	943	" "
20764	20765	20761	20761	he	943	" "
20774	20796	20798	20798	you	946	" continues Esther , leaning her two hands on the back of a chair , and tilting it up and down , "
20880	20881	20882	20882	You	946	" "
20913	20914	20904	20911	a vestal to the end of the chapter	948	" "
20933	20943	20925	20925	you	946	" she answers , with rather a sad smile . "
20995	20996	20979	20979	he	943	" "

21085	21879	21061	21061	I	0	" if neither Ferdinand nor any other beautiful young Prince had come on the scene , yet if Miranda had remained alone with her father , and the storms and winds and water - spirits , she would have ended by loving Caliban ? I do not know about Miranda , but I am sure that if Esther had been in Miranda 's place she would have so ended ; would have carried faggots in her slender arms for the shaggy monster — have called him caressing diminutives , and asked him little interested questions about his dam Sycorax . The desire to be loved is strong enough in us all ; in this girl it amounted to madness : it is the key to all the foolish , wicked , senseless things you will find her doing through this history 's short course . If she could have had her will , every man , Woman , and child , every cow and calf and dog and cat that met her , would have watched her coming with joy and her going with grief . Add to which , in the summer time most women like to have a lover ; it is almost as necessary to them as warm clothes at Christmas . In winter the fire is lover enough for any one . The frosty splendour of the stars and the chill flashing of the northern lights provoke no yearning in any one human soul towards any other ; we peep at them through our icy casements , then drop the curtain shivering , and leave them alone to their high cold play in the sky . But who can look at a July moon alone ? You will say that Esther was not alone , that she had her brother to look at it with her ; but who will deny that a brother who makes agricultural remarks about the Queen of Night , and observes that the haze round her royal head looks well for the turnips , is worse , immeasurably worse than nobody ? To me it seems that there is nothing absolute , positive in all this shifting , kaleidoscope world ; everything is comparative . There is nothing either good , bad , pretty , ugly , large , small , except as compared with something better , worse , prettier , uglier , larger , smaller . Measure two men together , and you find one tall and the other short ; put the short one by himself or among a world of pigmies , and straightway he grows tall . Lacking a standard to go by , we make egregious errors . I have known many a woman to pass through life with a pigmy beside her , taking him for a giant all the while , nor undeceived to the end . Esther has no man to measure her Robert by ; none at all , save the cowman , the carter , and the groom . Intellectually , morally , physically , he outtops them in stature , and that is all she can as yet know about him . Moonlight , propinquity , total absence of objects of comparison — these three must be Esther 's excuses . Robert is not much like her ideal , certainly — the ideal whose picture she has been painting life - size on the canvas of her mind during the vacant moments of the last two transitional years ; but if we all waited to be we d till our ideal came knocking at our doors , the world would be shortly dispeopled of legitimate inhabitants . Miss Craven 's ideal is dark ; at seventeen , most ideals are dark : he has long , fierce , sleepy , unfathomable eyes . Robert is straw- coloured : his eyes are blue ; very wide awake : they say exactly what his tongue does , neither more nor less , and there is absolutely no harm in them — a doubtful recommendation to a woman . The ideal 's nose is fine cut , delicately chiselled ; his cheeks are a little haggard , slightly hollowed and paled by five and thirty years or so of the reckless life of one that has lived , not existed . Robert 's nose is broad and blunt ; his cheeks have the roundness and bloom of a countryman 's five and twenty . The ideal breaks most of the commandments with easy grace ; is inclined to be sceptical and a little sarcastic over the old world beliefs , and facts hoary with time and reverence . Robert nightly prays on bent knees to be "
21889	21971	21061	21061	I	0	" he believes firmly every thing that he ever was taught , from the Peep of Day upwards , and he could no more shape his honest lips into a sneer than he could square the circle . Before the fell shafts of the ideal 's eyes women lie slain as thick as Greeks lay beneath the arrows of Apollo in the Iliad 's opening clash ; the number of Robert 's female victims is represented by a duck 's egg . "
21980	23179	21061	21061	I	0	" says one of the characters in the best French novel I have read this many a day . The ideal inspires fear equally with love ; you can imagine his being harsh , fierce , cruel , to the woman he loves . In none of the most hard - hearted of created beings could Robert provoke alarm . Children who see him for the first time come and thrust their little dimpled hands into his , and laugh up with confident impudence in his face . Dogs to whom he has never been introduced come and rub their shaggy heads against his knees , and curl and wriggle about his friendly feet . Esther can indulge no faintest hope that he will bully her . The ideal rides straight as a die , and is as much a part of his horse as a centaur . Robert is very fond of getting a day 's hunting when he can afford the two guineas requisite for the hiring of a horse , which is not very often ; and he likes to get his money 's worth by blundering blindly over everything that comes in his way , but he has about as much idea of riding as a tailor or a cow . The ideal is an idol to be set up and worshipped — a Baal to be adored with tears and blood and knife - gashings . Robert is a worshipper to be encouraged by a cold look and smile flung to him every now and then , like a bone to a dog , or spurned away with disapproving foot , as Cain was from his unaccepted altar . To worship is to a woman always sweeter than to be worshipped . To worship one must look up ; to be worshipped one must look down . . . . Come with me this August Sunday through the wood from Glan - yr - Afon to Plas Berwyn — from Esther 's home to Robert 's . It is but a few hundred yards of shade and shine , a small , scarce trodden wood - path whose narrow , faint track the ripe grasses and the seeded ferns have well - nigh obliterated , flinging themselves across it in all the abandon of their unspeakable grace . The apples ' round faces are reddening in the little Plas Berwyn orchard ; the shorn fields slope barely , slantwise along the hill - side in their yellow stubble . For weeks and weeks the corn has been whitening under the sun 's hard , veilless stare , and now at last it has fallen ; the barley has bowed its bearded head beneath the sickle 's stroke , and the oats their tremulous ringlets . They are all gathered in , and garnered in Mrs. Brandon 's stout , well - thatched stacks ; to thatch a stack is the one thing a Welshman can do . It is an hour past noon , and the Reverend Evan Evans has released the bodies of his congregation from that white - washed , tumble - down old barn that he is pleased to call his church , and their minds from the tension necessary to take in the ill - strung - together , misapplied texts that he is pleased to call his sermon . Plas Berwyn is a house of about the same size as Glan - yr - Afon , but the rooms do not look so large , they are so full of large things and large people . The dining - toom is crowded up with a great mahogany table , a great mahogany sideboard , great mahogany chairs — inconvenient relics , fondly clung to by people who from a larger house have subsided into a smaller one — a sort of warranty of past respectability like the cottager 's japanned tea - tray and brass candlesticks . There is an atmosphere of lumbersome age and gravity about the whole place ; none of the fragrance and light and melody that youth , sheer youth , even divorced from any other attractive qualities , brings with it . Of all the gods of the Greek mythology I will bring my votive crowns and my salt cakes to Bacchus . Not the bloated old gentleman striding drunk over a barrel , as we figure him , but Bacchus eternally young . What is there so worthy of adoration in this aging , wrinkling world as never ending youth ? Most people are cross and most people are unusually hungry on Sunday . I do not know why it is , but if you observe your acquaintance you will find it to be true . Hungry or not , the Brandons are at dinner , dining frugally and sparely on cold roast beef and cold apple tart . Nothing hot ever figures on the Brandons ' Sabbath table , not even potatoes ; indeed , unless they boiled themselves , and hopped out of the pot judiciously when they found themselves done , I do not see how they could , as on the Sabbath morn every living soul at Plas Berwyn , every reluctant scullion and recalcitrant housemaid , is trundled off to church , the house - door locked , and the key deposited in Mrs. Brandon 's pocket . All the Brandons hate dining in the middle of the day , consequently they always dine in the middle of the day on Sunday . Everybody knows that there are few things more distinctly unpleasant than to sit in the same room in which you have your meals ; to live with the unending smell and steam of departed viands up your nose and eyes and ears : consequently the Brandons always sit in the dining - room on Sunday . Sunday is to them a sort of aggravated Ash Wednesday and Good Friday rolled into one . On Saturday night Miss Bessy Brandon swoops down upon all novels , travels , biographies , magazines , poetry books , that may be lying about , makes a clean sweep of them and consigns them to disgrace and a cupboard till the return of Monday releases them . The Brandon family at the present moment have got their Sunday faces and their Sunday clothes on , and they misbecome most of them very sorely . Very few men look their best in their Go - to - Meeting clothes . For some unexplained reason , a black coat made by a country tailor shows its shortcomings more plainly than a coloured one . The garment that cases Bob 's broad shoulders would draw tears from Mr. Poole 's eyes , could he see it . As for Mrs. Brandon , she always has more or less of a Sunday face on — which I do not say in any dispraise , but merely to express a sober , steadfast face , unfurrowed by any violent gust of mirth or blast of anger . She is like Enid and her mother , "
23186	23398	21061	21061	I	0	" and on her breast she has a miniature of the departed Brandon , in Geneva gown and bands , about as big as a teacup , and with two small glutinous curls of the departed 's hair at the back . It is so long ago since he died , that she must have forgotten all about him — what he was like , even ; but site still wears his effigy , as an old inn continues to hang out the sign of the Saracen 's Head , though it is centuries since ever a Saracen has been seen on the earth 's face . Opposite each other , like little bad mirrors of one another , sit the Misses Brandon , in melancholy little gowns of no particular stuff and no particular colour , and little wisps of thin , fine hair well down over their ears , and minute chig . nons on the napes of their necks — their little , bustless , waistless , hipless figures , long plaintive noses , and meek , dull eyes proclaiming them of that virgin band to whom St. Paul has awarded the palm of excellence . The Sunday literature is scattered about on the hard - bottomed chairs . "

But seldom has Mr. Brandon missed attending divine service from the auspicious day , two and twenty years ago , when , at the tender age of three years , being , Eutychus- like , overcome with sleep , he fell down with much clamour from a high bench , and raised a mountainous red lump on his baby forehead , coming into contact with the hard pew floor : "

23938	23962	23932	23932	she	682	" subjoins Miss Bessy , with mild spite . Spite is permissible on the Sabbath , though hot potatoes and novels are not . "
23971	23985	23963	23963	She	682	" says Bob , briefly , cutting away rather viciously at the beef . "
24019	24034	24016	24017	dear boy	3425	" says the old woman , gently , seeing that her son is chafed . "

A ruddier tinge rushes into Robert 's already ruddy cheek — ruddy as King David 's when he tended his few sheep in the Syrian pastures , before the weight of the heavy Israelitish crown , and of his own wars and murders had blanched it . Down go the carving knife and fork with a clatter , and , "
24356	24396	24273	24273	myself	0	" he flies after the little vision , banging the door behind him with an impetus that makes his sisters bound up from their horsehair chairs like two small parched peas . Presently he brings her back in triumph . "
24410	24427	24398	24398	you	982	" says Mrs. Brandon , holding Esther 's young white hand in her old veiny one . "
24445	24461	24398	24398	you	982	" answers Esther , trying her best to lengthen her round face and look miserable . "
24473	24480	24470	24470	you	982	" inquires Miss Bessy , drily . "
24524	24534	24519	24519	you	991	" she ends with a happy after - thought . "
24545	24590	24536	24536	you	991	" says Mrs. Brandon , shaking her head , and all the innumerous stiff frillings of her cap , and bringing to bear on Esther 's sanguine youth the weight of her own gloomy experiences , in the infuriating way that old people do , "

24623	24632	24620	24621	good friends	996	" asks the girl , a little incredulously . "

The lovers have Plas Berwyn to themselves . Bob has gained his point , despite a parting fleer from Bessy as to the undesirability of neglecting the Creator for the creature . "
24776	24805	24773	24774	Tim Dowler	242	" cries Esther , joyously , jumping about the room like a child , and mimicking the one church bell which is heard clearly tinkling through the valley . "

Robert has abandoned the window - sill , finding it a painful and not luxurious seat : he is walking up and down , up and down ; one stride and a half of his long legs taking him from end to end of the little room . Esther has thrown herself into an American rocking chair , and is rocking violently backwards and forwards , trying her best to tip herself over . "

26036	26093	26019	26019	you	180	" inquires he , stopping short and looking surprised , as if the idea of there being any deficiency in his sisters ' costumes was an entirely new light to him . But Miss Craven purses up her pretty mouth in a silence more damnatory of the Misses Brandon 's toilettes than any words could be . "

Esther , happily rid of hers , is sitting on the ground at the French window of the study , beside her brother . The rooks that blackened the meadow awhile ago have flapped heavily home to the mile - off rookery . It is such a great , still world ; who would fancy that there were so many noisy men , barking dogs , snorting steam - engines in it ? It seems a world of stars and flowers , as one would imagine it after reading one of Mrs. Heman 's poems . Jack is smoking ; now and then Esther takes the pipe out of his mouth , gives a little puff , coughs and chokes , and puts it back again . Oh , blessed state of intimacy , when you may sit by a person for hours and never utter to them ! Esther is thinking what a pretty , pleasant Idyllic life hers is ; like an Arcadian shepherdess 's in this lovely valley , far away from smoky towns and vulgar cares and sordid toils . Young and beautiful ( what pretty woman is mock - modest to her own thoughts ? ) , living with a brother who is to her what father , mother , brothers , sisters , husband , children , are to other women ; a brother who is only three years older than herself , consequently not likely to die much before her . She is thinking , a little regretfully , that , fair and poetic as this life is , it is passing , and that as it passes she does not feel its beauty as acutely as she ought — does not suck out all its sweetness , as a man swallows a delicious draught hastily , carelessly , without tasting and dwelling upon its rare flavour . It is the same sort of thought ( only much weaker ) as those that torment us as we sit alone by the hearth mourning our dead , and reproach ourselves , with a yearning pain , that while they were yet with us we did not draw our chairs half close enough to theirs — did not take hold of their hands and kiss their faces half often enough — did not half often enough tell them , with eager lips , how preciouser than life they were to us .

30496	30516	30518	30518	she	148	" If you had been a little quicker in your movements , I should have known nothing about you , "

30565	30607	30429	30429	He	247	" but , to tell the truth , we had just been dragging the pool , like Boodles in ' Happy Thoughts , ' and I was such a mass of mud that I had not moral courage to face you . "
30608	30629	30695	30695	he	1144	" We should have met on equal terms . I was as black as a coal , was not I ? "
30630	30638	30640	30641	Miss Blessington	258	" Railroads do make one wonderfully dusty , "
30650	30662	30664	30664	Esther	148	" I had a worse infliction than any dust to bear , "

30706	30724	30695	30695	he	1144	" An aggravated case of baby — a baby that had something odd the matter with it . "

30753	30778	30737	30737	he	1144	" a woman eating gingerbread is bad enough . I travelled once with a woman who ate gingerbread from London to Holyhead without stopping . "

30788	30806	30695	30695	he	1144	" Good heavens , no ! What a prodigious suggestion!—that would have been adding insult to injury . "
30807	30839	30737	30737	he	1144	" If I had been travelling with you I should undoubtedly have offered you some . I should have judged you by myself , and I am very fond of gingerbread . "
30840	30843	30695	30695	he	1144	" Indeed ! "
30844	30846	30695	30695	he	1144	" And "

31610	31687	31607	31608	St. John	164	" ) Below the terrace spreads a large square of grass , uninvaded by flower - bed or shrub , mowed and rolled , rolled and mowed , into the similitude of a pancake for flatness . There croquet - hoops glance whitely in the soft half - light ; mallets lie strewn like dead soldiers after a battle ; balls red , blue , and yellow , like great ripe fruit tumbled among the grass . "
31695	31696	31607	31608	St. John	164	" "
31699	31700	31607	31608	St. John	164	" "

31742	31905	31908	31908	you	258	" answers Esther , cheerily ; she being a young woman to whom the words rest and enjoyment are not synonymous , as they mostly grow to be to people in later years . From the dining - room comes the faint melody of the trombone , played with the skill of much practice by Sir Thomas 's nose . Some one comes to the window , looks out , puts a hand on the sill , and jumps down . St. John apparently has an aversion from going out and coming in by the authorised modes of exit and entrance . Now that one can see him without any bigonia interposing , one notices that he has kind , eager eyes — eyes that seem to be looking , looking for something that they have not found yet — and rather a long nose , that the sun has got hold of and browned , as a cook browns mashed potatoes . "
31915	31988	31908	31908	you	258	" asks Miss Blessington , stooping to reinstate a fallen hoop , and looking calm invitation at him out of her great , fine , passionless , cow eyes . St. John hesitates , and looks towards Esther to see whether she is not going to second the invitation ; but she is balancing herself with her two feet on a croquet - mallet , and does not appear to see him . "
31994	31998	31990	31990	I	0	" she thinks , "
32015	32016	31908	31908	you	258	" "
32022	32035	32036	32036	He	1169	" asks he , with petulance , walking off in a huff . "
32054	32061	32052	32052	he	1169	" says Miss Craven , maliciously . "
32067	32080	32062	32062	He	1169	" replies Miss Blessington , rather sharplier than is her wo nt — "
32087	32088	32062	32062	He	1169	" "
32091	32165	32062	32062	He	1169	" The match begins ; it is about as fair as a foot race between Deerfoot and a lame baby . Esther has played about six times in the course of her life ; Miss Blessington about six thousand . Miss Blessington makes the round of the hoops in triumphant solitude , while poor Essie struggles feebly , ignorantly , unscientifically , to ring a bell that refuses to emit the faintest tinkle . "
32170	32180	32062	32062	He	1169	" cries she , laughing at her own discomfiture ; "
32196	32197	32189	32189	I	0	" "
32211	32238	32203	32203	I	0	" says St. John , appearing suddenly round a big Wellingtonia , and looking confusedly conscious of being seen descending very awkwardly from his high horse . "
32253	32272	32276	32277	another 's	1173	" says Essie , flashing at him with her wicked , laughing , half - lowered eyes . ( "
32298	32305	32284	32284	I	0	" she says to herself . ) "
32316	32322	32313	32314	Miss Craven	164	" interposes Constance , coldly . "
32332	32373	32330	32330	you	1169	" says Esther , making her seventy - second careless , abortive attempt at the bell , and throwing twice as much empressement into her voice from the amiable motive that she thinks such empressement is displeasing to Miss Blessington . "
32396	32425	32426	32426	Constance	256	" answers he , looking at her as he speaks with an intentness only excusable by the dim light , and the indistinctness of all objects in it . "
32443	32444	32438	32439	Miss Craven	164	" "
32460	32469	32449	32449	I	0	" replies Constance , in her measured way . "
32478	32484	32470	32470	I	0	" cries Esther , gaily , "
32506	32507	32490	32490	you	256	" "
32517	32524	32508	32508	I	0	" answers he , gaily too ; "
32534	32574	32530	32530	I	0	" Fate does not smile upon the union of St. John and Esther . Disgrace and disaster attend their arms ; in ignorance , unskilfulness , and general incapacity , St. John is no whit inferior to his partner . "
32584	32593	32577	32577	you	256	" cries she , delighted at the discovery . "
32599	32607	32594	32594	I	0	" he answers , not too amiably ; "
32646	32690	32694	32694	you	256	" pointing with a sort of ill - tempered resignation to Constance , who , with dress delicately lifted with one hand , and foot gracefully poised , is inflicting heavy chastisement , with a calm , satisfied vindictiveness , on his ball . "
32698	32776	32696	32696	you	256	" ( this is addressed to the ball , not to Miss Blessington ) hurling his mallet at it as it scuds swiftly over the sward and lodges in the pink and purple breast of an aster bed . The head and handle of the mallet fly asunder from the violence of their passage through the air , and Mr. Gerard is reduced to the ignominy of picking up the disjecta membra and hammering them together again . "
32790	32796	32777	32777	You	256	" remarks Esther , sarcastically . "
32823	32835	32817	32817	he	1180	" he answers , coming over and standing close to her . "
32851	32920	32847	32847	you	256	" exclaims Constance , with suppressed , lady - like irritation , from the other end of the ground , where she stands in majestic solitude . It is the penalty of greatness to be lonely . A few more egregious blunders on the part of the firm of Gerard and Craven , a few more masterstrokes by Miss Blessington , and the game draws to a conclusion . "
32933	32949	32931	32931	Constance	256	" cries St. John , flinging down his weapon in an unjust , unreasonable fury . "
32976	32987	32931	32931	Constance	256	" ( turning to Essie , and speaking eagerly ) , "
33023	33043	33046	33046	he	1182	" Then he feels that he is making a fool of himself , and walks off in a rage . "
33051	33067	33046	33046	he	1182	" says Esther , opening her great eyes and looking a little blankly after him . "
33075	33082	33068	33068	He	1182	" answers Miss Blessington , composedly ; "
33108	33109	33112	33112	he	1182	" "
33118	33346	33112	33112	he	1182	" says Esther , internally . DEATH and the sun are very much alike in one respect , and that is , their utter impartiality and stupid want of discernment . They make no difference between those who love them and those who hate . They pay their visits equally so those who are longing for and lifting up eager hands towards them , and those who would much prefer to be without them . I will drop the parallel , which can not be carried much farther , and talk of the sun only . He certainly shows very little judgment , and less taste , in these matters . He gives his great , warm light just as readily to a scullery as a boudoir , to an ill - smelling dunghill as to a bed of mignonette ; kisses with just as much relish the raddled cheeks of an old fish - wife as the fresh scarlet lips of a young countess . This present August morning he is blazing full and hot on that very grievous daub of Mrs. Brandon in a no - waisted black satin , out of which she appears to be bursting , like a chrysalis from its sheath , in the Plas Berwyn dining - room , and not a whit more fully or more hotly on the exquisite "
33349	33522	33112	33112	he	1182	" of Da Vinci , which is the chief jewel of the Gerard collection . The same sunbeam that brings out with such clearness Monna Lisa 's faint , weird smile , takes in also within its compass Esther 's small , swart head , round the back of which coils a great , loose , careless twist of burnished hair , like a black snake . She is standing outside the dining - room door , with her lithe , svelte figure stooped forward a little . The family are at prayers , as she ascertained by applying her ear to the key - hole , and hearing a harsh , elderly voice going at a good round trot through a variety of petitions , for himself , his children ( he has only one , and hates him ) , his friends , his enemies , his queen , his bishops and curates , his black brethren , & c. , all without the vestige of a comma between them . "
33527	33553	33112	33112	he	1182	" asks St. John , coming down the handsome , shallow stairs in knickerbockers and heather - mixture stockings that his old mother made him . "
33556	33562	33563	33563	they	1185	" holding up her forefinger ; "
33568	33584	33563	33563	they	1185	" St. John listens too , and a sneer comes and settles on his mouth . "
33615	33616	33596	33596	he	1188	" "
33625	33632	33633	33633	I	0	" ( in a whisper ) . "
33638	33645	33635	33635	I	0	" ( in another whisper ) . "
33652	33675	33648	33648	you	1189	" casting down her eyes , that he may see how large a portion of downy cheeks her long curly lashes shade . "
33695	33696	33684	33684	he	1190	" "
33704	33705	33684	33684	he	1190	" "
33717	33718	33721	33722	Sir Thomas	238	" "
33724	33725	33721	33722	Sir Thomas	238	" "
33749	33750	33730	33730	you	1189	" "
33765	33963	33964	33964	Venus	266	" says St. John , in ironical quotation ; and then the door opens , and a long string of servants issue out , and the two culprits again , as on the previous evening , together enter . Lady Gerard never appears at breakfast . About twenty years ago she had an illness , and , on the strength of it , has kept up a character for invalidhood ever since . Miss Blessington takes her place at the head of the table ; she is sitting there now . Her shapely hands are busy among the teacups ; her white lids drooped over her calm eyes . There is a great gold cross on her breast , that rises and falls in soft , even undulations . Eve , as she was when first she grew into separate entity and embodiment out of Adam 's side ; Eve , of creamiest flesh , and richest , reddest blood , before a soul — a tormenting , puzzling , intangible , incomprehensible soul — was breathed into her . When Constance marries , her husband will gaze at her as a man might gaze at Gibson 's "
33966	34051	33964	33964	Venus	266	" supposing that he had bought for a great price that marvel of modern sculpture , and had set it up in the place of honour in his gallery . He would half - shut his eyes , the better to appreciate the exquisite turn of the cold , stately throat , the modelling of the little rounded wrist ; would put his head on one side , and look at it this way and that , to determine whether he liked the tinting . "
34061	34251	33964	33964	Venus	266	" as the pithy line that everybody knows , and that next to nobody could have written , hath it . At forty Constance will be a much handsomer woman than Esther . At forty those clean - cut , immovable , expressionless features will be hardly the worse for wear ; that colourless marble skin will be hardly less smoothly polished than it is now . At forty Esther ( if she live so long ) will have cried and laughed , and fretted and teased herself into a mere shadow of her present self . Every one 's letters at Felton are put on their plate for them . As Esther takes her seat , she perceives that there is one for her — one directed in a scrawling , schoolboy hand . The blood rushes to her face , as it does to a turkeycock 's wattles when he is excited or angry , and she thrusts it hastily into her pocket . To her guilty imagination it seems that written all over it , in big red letters , legible to every eye , is , "
34261	34291	34292	34292	We	1194	" As her eyes lift themselves shyly , to see whether St. John is observing her , they meet his , looking at her curiously , interestedly , puzzledly . "
34303	34312	34313	34313	we	1194	" he says , with a friendly smile ; "
34333	34334	34322	34322	I	0	" "
34355	34748	34339	34339	I	0	" answers Esther , disjointedly , with would - be indifference , and the turkeycock hue spreading to the edge of her white gown . The morning hours at Felton are not exciting . Sir Thomas is building a new orchid house , and spends much of his time standing over the bricklayers , like an Egyptian overseer , telling them with his usual courteous candour how much more he knows about their trade than they themselves do , who have been at it all their lives . St. John disappears too , and Constance and Esther are left tête - à - tête . Esther has plenty of time to read Bob 's letter , and to understand it , which latter requires some ingenuity , as , from the greater rapidity of his thoughts than of his pen , he omits most of the little words — tos and ands and whichs and who s and he s and she s. There is a good deal about his mother in it : several messages from her ; a great many questions as to what Mr. Gerard was like , with solemn adjurations to answer them ; a sheet devoted to the exposition of the luxury in which it is possible to live on £ 300 a year ; and , lastly , a sentence or two as to his great loneliness , and his eager longing to have his darling Esther back again — not much on that head , as if he were afraid of marring her enjoyment by intruding upon her the picture of his own disconsolateness . It was not an eloquent letter ; in fact , it was rather a stupid one , and had evidently been written with a very nasty scratchy pen ; but for all that it was a nice one , and so Esther felt , and wished that it had been less so . Bob is a dear fellow ; and , no doubt , when she goes back to Glan - yr - Afon , she will be very glad to see him , and be very fond of him ; but , for the present , she would like to forget him altogether — to have a holiday from him : he seems to come in incongruously now somehow . "
34754	34807	34751	34752	St. John	164	" grunts miladi , who makes her appearance towards luncheon time , from the arm - chair which is witness to so many gentle dozes on her part . Miladi likes St. John ; he is very good to her , and often stands in the breach between her and Sir Thomas . "
34810	34822	34823	34823	I	0	" answers Miss Blessington , in her slow , sweet drawl . "
34833	34870	34825	34826	Miss Craven	164	" It is very pleasant , is not it ? when you think you have been making a highly favourable impression on a person , to hear that they have fled before you in abject fear . "
34883	34889	34876	34876	he	1196	" answers Essie , nettled . "
34895	34919	34890	34890	He	1196	" says Constance , her white fingers flying swiftly in and out among the coloured silks of the smoking cap she is embroidering ; "
34929	34930	34931	34933	The greatest friends	1199	" "
34940	34948	34937	34937	strangers	1198	" objects Essie , feeling rather small . "
34978	34980	34976	34976	aunt	1203	" But "
34982	34988	34976	34976	aunt	1203	" has fallen sweetly asleep . "
35010	35011	35008	35008	you	1206	" "
35014	35227	35008	35008	you	1206	" replies Esther , with emphasis . It is not true — she does nothing of the kind ; but , after all , what is truth in comparison of the discomfiture of an adversary ? LUNCHEON comes , but no St. John . After luncheon Sir Thomas , Miss Blessington , and Miss Craven go out riding . Miss Craven 's knowledge of horsemanship is confined to her exploits on a small , shaggy , down - hearted Welsh pony , concerning whom it would be difficult to predicate which he was fullest of , years or grass . Miss Blessington has lent her an old habit ; it is much too big in the waist and shoulders for her , but a well - made garment always manages to adapt itself more or less to any figure , and she does not look amiss in it . It is a matter of very little consequence to her at the present moment how she looks ; she is the arrantest coward in Christendom , and her heart sinks down to the bottom of her boots as she sees three horses that look unnaturally tall and depressingly cheerful issue through the great folding - doors that open into the stable - yard . "
35276	35277	35270	35270	I	0	" "
35280	35287	35270	35270	I	0	" answers Sir Thomas , roughly . "
35353	35558	35349	35350	Miss Craven	164	" After two abortive attempts , in the first of which she springs short , and glides ignobly to earth again , and in the second takes a bound that goes near to carrying her clean over her steed , after having given Simpson a kick in the face , and torn a hole in her borrowed habit , Miss Craven is at length settled in her seat . It is a hot afternoon ; after all , I think that miladi has the best of it , sitting in a garden - chair under a tulip tree , eating apricots . The deer , with dappled sides and heavy- horned heads , are herding about the rough , knotted feet of the great trees that stand here and there in solitary kingship about the park . They spread their ancient , out - stretched arms between earth and heaven , and man and beast rejoice in the shade thereof . The dust lies a hand - breadth thick upon the road ; the nuts in the hedgerow , the half - ripe blackberries , the rag - wort in the grass — all merge their distinctive colours in one dirty - white mask . "
35569	35585	35560	35560	she	3639	" asks Esther , in a mysterious whisper of Miss Blessington , across Sir Thomas . "
35598	35599	35600	35600	I	0	" "
35609	35619	35600	35600	I	0	" answers Constance , with politely - veiled contempt ; "
35629	35709	35600	35600	I	0	" The animal that inspires such alarm in Esther 's mind , is a slight , showy thing , nearly thoroughbred ; a capital lady 's park hack . It is quiet enough , only that the quietness of a young , oats - fed mare , and of an antediluvian Welsh pony blown out with grass , are two different things . She is sidling along now , half across the road , coquetting with her own shadow . "
35715	35722	35712	35713	Sir Thomas	238	" ( in an agonised voice ) "
35738	35739	35732	35732	she	3639	" "
35742	35754	35732	35732	she	3639	" answers Sir Thomas , in his hard , loud voice ; "
35760	35761	35732	35732	she	3639	" "
35780	35868	35869	35869	I	0	" rejoins Esther , ruefully . The glare from the road , the dust and the midges , make people keep their eyes closed as nearly as they can : so that it is not till they are close upon him that they perceive that the man who is dawdling along to meet them on a stout , grey cob , with his hat and coat and whiskers nearly as white as any miller 's , is St. John . He looks rather annoyed at the rencontre . "
35900	35901	35902	35902	You	0	" "
35913	35919	35910	35911	St. John	164	" suggests Constance , graciously . "
35928	35929	35910	35911	St. John	164	" "
35935	35962	35910	35911	St. John	164	" nodding her head and her tall hat , and about a million flies that are promenading on it , gracefully . Esther 's fears vanish . "
35968	36023	35910	35911	St. John	164	" she says in a low voice , and making rather a plaintive little face as he passes her . Drawn by the magnet that has succeeded in drawing to itself most things that it wished — viz . , a woman 's inviting eyes — he turns the cob 's head sharp round . "
36028	36069	35910	35911	St. John	164	" he answers , with an eager smile , putting his horse alongside of hers . She was rather compunctious the moment she had said it . It is reversing the order of things — the woman after the man ; "
36076	36118	35910	35911	St. John	164	" as the homely old proverb says . The road is broad , and for a little while they all four jog on abreast , as in a Roman chariot - race or a city omnibus — rather a dreary squadron . "
36124	36128	35910	35911	St. John	164	" thinks Esther . "
36154	36161	36151	36151	my	0	" No sooner said than done . "
36178	36199	36175	36175	my	0	" Mr. Gerard , of course , dismounts and picks it up ; Sir Thomas and his ward pass on . "
36209	36226	36175	36175	my	0	" says St. John , wiping the little delicate switch before giving it back to her . "
36235	36240	36232	36232	you	247	" ( reddening ) . "
36269	36279	36280	36280	I	0	" He looks at her searchingly as he speaks . "
36287	36294	36280	36280	I	0	" she answers , blushing painfully . "
36313	36314	36297	36297	you	247	" "
36322	36329	36331	36331	anybody	740	" ( a little anxiously ) , "
36333	36334	36331	36331	anybody	740	" "
36347	36348	36344	36344	I	0	" "
36373	36374	36359	36359	you	247	" "
36379	36389	36375	36375	You	247	" ( looking at her with uneasy intentness ) . "
36420	36421	36397	36397	you	247	" "
36432	36452	36428	36428	I	0	" He looks only half - satisfied with this oracular evasion ; but does not press the point farther . "
36482	36483	36484	36484	He	1217	" "
36489	36513	36484	36484	He	1217	" says Esther , rather snappishly ; a little out of humour with him for having put her out of conceit with herself . "
36525	36531	36484	36484	He	1217	" answers he , gravely ; "
36566	36567	36600	36600	you	0	" "
36570	36587	36600	36600	you	0	" cries Esther , turning her eyes , broad open , in childish wonder upon him . "
36595	36596	36600	36600	you	0	" "
36605	36606	36600	36600	you	0	" "
36622	36623	36600	36600	you	0	" "
36659	36671	36648	36648	he	1227	" nodding respectfully at Sir Thomas 's broad , blue back . "
36684	36692	36697	36697	you	0	" says Esther , a little sardonically . "
36699	36706	36695	36695	I	0	" says St. John , energetically ; "
36739	36746	36735	36735	my	0	" ( emphasising every syllable ) , "
36776	36777	36778	36778	I	0	" "

36852	36855	36856	36856	I	0	surgery"(laughing ) . "
36914	36915	36908	36908	Felton	44	" "
36916	36929	37074	37074	her	1236	" You should go about incognito , like the Lord of Burleigh . "
36930	37060	36908	36908	Felton	44	" He was but a landscape painter , you know . Do you know that once , not a very many years ago , I had a ridiculous notion in my head that one ought to try and do some little good in the world ? Thanks to Sir Thomas 's assistance and example , I have very nearly succeeded in getting rid of that chimera . If I am asked at the Last Day how I have spent my life , I can say , I have shot a few bears in Norway , and a good many turkeys and grebe in Albania ; I have killed several salmon in Connemara : I have made a fool of myself once , and a beast of myself many times . "
37061	37071	36908	36908	Felton	44	" How did you make a fool of yourself ? "
37077	37165	36908	36908	Felton	44	" Oh ! never mind ; it is a stupid story without any point , and I have not quite come to the pitch of dotage of telling senile anecdotes about myself . Here , let us turn in at this gate , and take a cut across the park : it is cooler , and we can have a nice gallop under the trees , without coming in for the full legacy of Sir Thomas 's and Conny 's dust , as we are doing now . "
37166	37177	37179	37179	Esther	148	" But — but — is not it rather dangerous ? "
37183	37204	37179	37179	Esther	148	" Do n't they sometimes put their feet into rabbit - holes , and tumble down and break their legs ? "
37205	37214	37216	37217	St. John	164	" Frequently , I may almost say invariably , "
37329	37372	37406	37407	no one	891	" She looked so lovely as she swayedThe rein with dainty finger - tips ; A man had given all other bliss , And all his worldly worth for this — To waste his whole heart in one kissUpon her perfect lips . "
37373	37393	37394	37394	she	1241	" Delicious ! I 'm not a bit afraid now ; I bid defiance to the rabbit - holes , "
37523	37537	37539	37540	St. John	164	" Mind ! Take care ! Hold tight ! Keep her head up ! "
37602	37608	37627	37627	he	1246	" I 'm not dead , "
37642	37649	37627	37627	he	1246	" Do n't look so frightened ! "
37650	37654	37655	37655	he	1246	" Thank God ! "
37677	37694	37667	37667	he	1246	" When I saw you there , lying all shapeless , I half thought — Oh ! "
37700	37709	37667	37667	he	1246	" I do n't know what I thought . "
37710	37723	37725	37725	Essie	180	" I must be tied on next time , must n't I ? "
37751	37755	37729	37729	her	180	" Oh ! Mr. Gerard,"—the
37764	37781	37729	37729	her	180	cheeks—"I do hate riding ! it 's horribly dangerous ! quite as bad as a battle ! "
37782	37785	37787	37788	St. John	164	" Quite ! "
37797	37808	37787	37788	St. John	164	" And you are quite sure you are not hurt ? "
37809	37812	37729	37729	her	180	" Quite ! "
37813	37816	37729	37729	her	180	" Really ? "
37817	37820	37787	37788	St. John	164	" Really ! "
37860	37884	37888	37888	she	180	" Not quite sure , either ; I seem to have done something stupid to my foot — turned it or twisted it . "
37962	37975	37977	37977	his	1246	" I 'm awfully sorry ! Whereabouts does it hurt ? There ? "
37987	37993	37977	37977	his	1246	" Yes , a little . "
37994	38000	38002	38002	You	1248	" I 'm awfully sorry ! "
38014	38037	38002	38002	You	1248	" What can I do for it ? gallop home as hard as I can , and make them send the carriage ? "
38038	38058	37977	37977	his	1246	" With a doctor , a lawyer , and a parson in it ? No , I think not . "
38059	38078	37977	37977	his	1246	" But you can not sit here all night . Could you ride home , do you think ? "
38079	38085	38002	38002	You	1248	" On that dreadful beast ? "
38091	38101	38002	38002	You	1248	" But if I lead her all the way ? "
38102	38105	37977	37977	his	1246	" Very well "
38110	38128	37977	37977	his	1246	" but ( brightening a little ) I can not ride her ; she is not here . "
38129	38141	38143	38144	St. John	164	" I suppose I must be going to look after her , "
38152	38182	38143	38144	St. John	164	" Brute ! she is as cunning as Old Nick ! And you are sure you do n't mind being left here by yourself for a minute or two ? "
38183	38193	38194	38194	she	1249	" Not if there are no horses within reach , "
38362	38406	38341	38342	St. Anthony	286	" Would not let me get within half a mile of her ! far too knowing ! Brute ! and now she 'll be sure to go and knock the saddle to pieces , and then there 'll be the devil to pay ! "
38407	38413	38415	38415	Esther	148	" I 'm so sorry , "
38429	38447	38415	38415	Esther	148	" So am I , for your sake : you 'll have to ride the cob home . "
38448	38460	38461	38461	she	148	" I shall have to turn into a man , then , "
38472	38479	38461	38461	she	148	" No , you wo n't , "
38534	38546	38548	38548	Gerard	247	" You must let me put you up , I think , "
38574	38578	38548	38548	Gerard	247	" Must I ? "
38586	38594	38548	38548	Gerard	247	" Yes ; do you mind much ? "
38595	38599	38600	38600	He	247	" No — o. "
38715	38725	38726	38726	he	247	" I think you must let me hold you , "
38740	38745	38746	38746	she	1252	" No , no ! "
38753	38764	38752	38752	herself	1252	away—"no need!—no need at all ! I shall not fall . "
38809	38813	38814	38814	he	247	" Very well , "
38831	38844	38814	38814	he	247	" But I 'm afraid you will find that you are mistaken . "
38958	38969	38970	38970	she	148	" Mr. Gerard ! Mr. Gerard ! I 'm falling ! "
39020	39033	39015	39015	he	247	" I knew how it would be ; I told you so ! "
39054	39064	39015	39015	he	247	" I 'm afraid you are in great pain ? "
39132	39142	39123	39123	she	258	" Yea , yea , and Nay , nay . "
39143	39151	39153	39153	Gerard	258	" Now for an exchange of civilities , "
39158	39172	39153	39153	Gerard	258	" even at this distance I can see him getting the steam up . "
39173	39188	39189	39189	he	238	" Miss Craven has had a fall , Sir Thomas , and hurt herself , "
39205	39215	39217	39218	Sir Thomas	238	" Broken the mare 's knees , I suppose ? "

39283	39288	39290	39291	St. John	164	" Damn the mare ! "
39382	39394	39395	39395	she	258	" You are not much hurt , really , I hope ? "
39416	39431	39395	39395	she	258	" Which way did you come , and what has become of your horse ? "
39432	39439	39441	39441	Esther	148	" We came through the park , "
39455	39476	39441	39441	Esther	148	" so I suppose the horse is there still . Mr. Gerard tried to catch it , and could not . "
39477	39482	39484	39485	Miss Blessington	258	" Through the park ! "
39495	39535	39484	39485	Miss Blessington	258	" Oh ! I see ; a short cut home ! Poor St. John has such a horror of taking a ride for riding 's sake , that he always tries to shorten his penance as much as possible ! "
39811	39848	39798	39799	the travellers	1287	" Why is this lazy child lying all day on a couch , when we and so many other flowers have been calling to her with our voiceless voices to come out into the breeze and shine "
39934	39944	39946	39946	her	258	" I hope you are feeling a little easier , "
40146	40342	40343	40343	Yours	1291	" DEAR BOB,—Thanks very much for your letter ; please put a few stops next time . I had a very disagreeable journey here — bushels of dust and a sick baby . This is a very handsome place , and they are all very kind to me . ( H'm ! are they ? I do n't know about that ; one of them , is . ) Yesterday I went out riding with Sir Thomas and his ward ( so I did ; I set out with them ) , and I stupidly fell from my horse , a sort of thing that nobody but I would have done , and hurt my foot a little ; but nothing to speak of . Miss Blessington , the ward , is remarkably handsome , but looks a great deal older than I do . My love to your mother , and thanks for her kind messages ; the same to the girls . Tell Bessy that it is hardly worth while sending me ' The Sinfulness of Little Sins , ' as I shall have more time for reading when I get home again . "
40346	40349	40343	40343	Yours	1291	" E. C. "
40378	40379	40362	40362	he	247	" "
40390	40448	40362	40362	he	247	" Dinner is over ; nothing to look forward to but bed - time . Yah ! How dull ! A knock comes at the door . Miss Blessington enters with flowers in her hand — jessamine , heliotrope , everything that smells sweetly and not heavily — unlike Bob 's well meaning but annihilating double stocks . "
40457	40476	40362	40362	he	247	" ( the usual formula , that comes as regularly and frequently as the doxology in church ) . "
40486	40495	40482	40482	I	0	" ( yawning and looking woefully bored . ) "
40500	40501	40502	40503	St. John	164	" "
40508	40514	40515	40516	Mr. Gerard	247	" ( rather shortly ) . "
40518	40529	40515	40516	Mr. Gerard	247	" ( with animation , the bored look vanishing . ) "
40536	40537	40534	40534	him	247	" "
40546	40555	40538	40538	He	247	" answers Constance , with a cold generality . "
40574	40595	40565	40565	he	247	" continues Essie , with a malicious twinkle in her eyes . Constance sweeps to the window , slightly discomfited . "
40619	40629	40596	40596	He	247	" she says , in a somewhat constrained voice ; "
40659	40660	40644	40644	I	0	" "
40673	40681	40665	40665	I	0	" cries Essie , with perverse alacrity . "
40732	40927	40721	40722	your maid	3789	" Outside Miss Craven 's door St. John pauses , as one that is devout hesitates on the threshold of a sanctuary . Chintz curtains rose - lined , white - dressed toilet - table , simple valueless ornaments lying about , two little slippers , that look as if they had been just kicked off — his eye takes in all the details . He feels like Faust in Marguerite 's chamber . And Marguerite herself , lying careless , restful on her couch , her two arms flung lazily upwards and backwards , to make a resting - place for her head ; the smooth elbows and shoulders gleaming warm , cream - white , through the colder blue - white of her dress ; and the up - looking face , childish in its roundness , and blooming down — but oh ! most womanish — in the shafts of quick fire that greet him from the laughing , sleepy eyes : Where did she learn that art of shooting ? From the pigs and cabbages at Glan - yr - Afon ? From old Mrs. Brandon ? From Miss Bessie ? From—"Stop
40931	40937	40721	40722	your maid	3789	" Deponent sayeth not whence . "
40943	40973	40941	40941	you	1296	" she says , with emphasis , stretching out her hand to him , as he stands beside her sofa , looking rather fagged with his day 's work . "
41004	41005	41010	41010	one	559	" "
41017	41025	41010	41010	one	559	" answers St. John , rather ruefully . "
41031	41037	41026	41026	I	0	" she rejoins , simply . "
41053	41060	41038	41038	We	1302	" he says , rather irritably . "
41080	41081	41082	41082	People	3426	" "
41091	41097	41098	41098	they	3426	" answers Essie , laughing ; "
41112	41113	41098	41098	they	3426	" "
41124	41136	41118	41118	her	164	" asks Miss Blessington from the doorway . St. John starts . "
41143	41390	41118	41118	her	164	" He stoops , and lifts her carefully , as a thing most precious ; as he does so , a little foolish trembling passes over her , as a baby - breeze passes over some still pool 's breast , hardly troubling the sky and the trees that lie far down in the blue mirror . Down the grand staircase he bears her , and Constance follows to see that there is no loitering by the way . The morning - room at Felton ( so called because the family always sit there in the evenings ) is very lofty . You have to crane your neck up to see the stucco stalactites , faintly imitative of Staffa and Iona , pendant from the ceiling . There are statuettes in plenty standing about in niches and on pedestals . Venuses and Minervas and Clyties , all with their hair very elaborately dressed , and not a stitch of clothes on . There is a great litter of papers and magazines on the round table : the Justice of the Peace , that is Sir Thomas 's ; the Field , that is St. John 's ; the Cornhill , that is everybody 's . Sir Thomas and miladi are playing backgammon ; miladi is compelled to do so every night as a penance for her sins — four rubbers , and if he wins , as she prays and endeavours that he may , five . "
41404	41410	41402	41402	miladi	3952	" he says , snappishly ; "
41422	41423	41118	41118	her	164	" "
41429	41435	41426	41427	Sir Thomas	238	" responds miladi , meekly . "
41452	41521	41523	41523	they	1311	" Miss Blessington , dressed by Elise in Chambéry gauze , and by Nature in her usual panoply of beautiful stupidity , which she wears sleeping and waking , at home and abroad , living and dying , is at work at a little table , a nude Dian , with cold , chaste smile and crinkly hair , on a red velvet shrine just above her head . "
41528	41808	41810	41810	they	1312	" asks Esther , from the recess where she has been deposited by St. John , whose eyes she encounters , considering her attentively over the top of the Saturday . Shams , Flunkeyism , Woman 's Rights , Dr. Cumming , the Girl of the Period — they have all been passing through his eye into his brain , and , mixed with Esther Craven , make a fine jumble there . St. John has been rather unlucky in his experiences of women hitherto . He has got rather into the habit of thinking that all good women must be stupid , and that all pleasant women must be bad . Esther is not stupid . Is she bad , then ? Those glances of hers , they give a man odd sensations about the midriff ; they inspire in him a greedy , covetous desire for more of them ; but are they such as Una would have given her Red Cross Knight ? Are they such as a man would like to see his wife bestow on his men friends ? The wilder a man is or has been himself , the more scrupulously fastidious he is about the almost prudish nicety of the women that belong to him . He likes to see the sheep and the goats as plainly , widely separated as they are in the parable ; it moves him to deep wrath when he sees a good woman faintly , poorly imitating a bad one . I do not think that good women believe this half generally enough ; or , if they do , they do not act upon it . "
41815	41816	41810	41810	they	1312	" "
41830	41831	41821	41822	Sir Thomas	238	" "
41840	41841	41837	41837	you	238	" "
41855	41856	41853	41853	Conny	256	" "
41863	41864	41858	41858	she	3406	" "
41867	41868	41858	41858	she	3406	" "
41878	41879	41871	41871	she	3406	" "
41912	41913	41890	41890	she	3406	" "
41929	41935	41924	41924	he	1318	" remarks Esther , flippantly . "
41946	41947	41941	41941	her	3406	" "
41950	41955	41941	41941	her	3406	" shrugging his shoulders . "
42027	42028	42032	42032	you	238	" "
42039	42040	42042	42042	I	0	" "
42083	42084	42085	42085	We	1321	" "
42093	42105	42091	42091	miladi	3952	" shouts Sir Thomas 's stentor voice , elate with victory ; "
42142	42262	42132	42132	I	0	" Poor miladi , strangling a gigantic yawn , begins to set her men again ; she had hoped that her punishment was ended for the night , and that she might be dismissed to the otium cum dignitate of her armchair and nap . St. John jumps up and walks over to the players ; there are few things in life he hates so much as playing backgammon with his father , but he hates seeing his mother bullied even more . If a man is cursed with a necessity foi loving something , the chances are that he will love his mother , even if she bear more resemblance to a porpoise than to a Christian lady . "
42279	42280	42274	42275	my mother	3406	" "
42283	42288	42274	42275	my mother	3406	" growls Sir Thomas . "
42324	42564	42321	42321	she	3406	" But the man 's will is stronger than the turkey - cock 's , and the latter yields . A SPRAINED ankle takes mostly a tedious weary time in getting mended . Esther 's , however , is but a slight sprain , and entails only a week 's lying on a thoroughly comfortable , well - stuffed sofa close to one of the library 's windows , where mignonette ends up continual presents of the strongest and sweetest of all flower - perfumes to her grateful nostrils — entails also being made a fuss with . If Miss Blessington had had her will , the sofa would have been upstairs , and the being made a fuss with , save by a compassionate lady 's maid , dispensed with . Miss Blessington desires sincerely , in her affectionate solicitude for her welfare , to keep the young patient in a graceful and pleasing solitude upstairs . The young patient , being of a gregarious turn of mind , desires sincerely to be brought down : and the son of the house , although not particularly young , and in general not particularly gregarious , desires sincerely to bring her down . It is a case of Pull , Devil ; Pull , Baker!—Baker being represented by Constance , Devil by St. John and Esther . But two pull stronger than one , and they gain their point . "
42573	42594	42566	42567	Miss Craven	164	" asks St. John , one morning , addressing the question to Miss Blessington as they stand together after breakfast . "
42607	42608	42604	42605	St. John	164	" "
42611	42612	42321	42321	she	3406	" "
42615	42633	42321	42321	she	3406	" she says , giving a little factitious cough , and speaking with her usual amiable smile , "
42645	42646	42647	42647	I	0	" "
42660	42670	42647	42647	I	0	" he answers , picking up the Pall Mall . "
42676	42688	42671	42671	I	0	" she rejoins , with a certain air of doubtful reserve . "
42744	42745	42730	42730	you	0	" "
42792	42793	42794	42794	I	0	" "
42805	42823	42794	42794	I	0	" he says , laughing broadly to himself behind the little yellowy sheets of the Pall Mall . "
42846	42878	42925	42926	Miss Craven	164	" She is silent ; the resentment of a slow nature , that has a suspicion of being laughed at , but is not sure of it , smouldering within her . "
42916	42917	42925	42926	Miss Craven	164	" "
42966	42967	42960	42960	I	0	" "
42997	43004	43005	43005	I	0	" Miss Blessington turns away pettishly . "
43023	43024	43025	43025	She	682	" "
43035	43036	43025	43025	She	682	" "

43095	43106	43051	43051	your	256	" says Constance , harking back to her former speech , "

43159	43188	43150	43150	I	0	" assents Gerard , blandly . The sentence is Miss Blessington 's own , and yet , by fresh accentuation , it is made exactly to contradict itself . "
43215	43216	43202	43202	I	0	" "
43224	43225	43202	43202	I	0	" "

43289	43301	43279	43279	My	0	" she retorts , with lady - like , gentle exasperation . "
43330	43331	43360	43360	you	256	" "
43337	43338	43360	43360	you	256	" "

43382	43383	43385	43385	you	256	" "
43388	43397	43385	43385	you	256	" ( disdaining to notice the interruption ) — "
43403	43427	43431	43431	me	0	" he says , laying down the paper , and turning his face , kindled by a certain honest self - contempt , towards her—"To
43467	43468	43524	43524	you	256	" "
43471	43477	43431	43431	me	0	" she says , scornfully ; "
43528	43529	43524	43524	you	256	" "
43535	43554	43531	43531	I	0	" he repeats , impatiently , tired of the subject , and of the repetition of the phrase — "
43571	43943	43531	43531	I	0	" So Esther lies all day long in lazy contentment upon the sofa , looking out at the garden , and at the fountain where four bronze dolphins spout continual showers of spray in the autumn sunlight : dips into Owen Meredith 's last poems ; peeps between the crisp uncut leaves of new magazine or novel ; and looks forward towards the ante - dinner hour , when St. John will come in from the day 's amusement or occupation , and passive content will be exchanged for active enjoyment . Esther has , as you know , made but light of her accident in her letters to her lover ; fearing lest , in his eager anxiety on her account , he might get into the train , and give her the unexpected pleasure of seeing him arrive at Felton — seeing him arrive in his threadbare shooting jacket , through whose sleeves he always appears to have thrust his long arms too far , and his patched , creaking , Naullan boots . Imagine St. John introduced to those boots ! A cold shiver runs down her spine at the bare idea . St. John is no dandy , it is true , but coats from Poole 's are as much a matter of course to him as a knife and fork to eat his dinner with , or a bed to lie upon . On the afternoon of the day on which the above - reported short dialogue took place , St. John and his father , converging from different points of the compass to one centre , enter almost at the same moment the library . Two canary - coloured Colossi have just deposited tea on a small table . St. John has neither neckerchief nor collar ; his brown throat is bared in a négligé as becoming to most men as the à quatre épingles exctitude of their park get - up is unbecoming . A man in the loose carelessness of his every - day country clothes is a man : in the prim tightness of his Pall Mall pltte he is a little , stiff , jointless figure out of Noah 's ark . "
43947	43954	43531	43531	I	0	" says Paterfamilias , very gruffly . "
44003	44047	44048	44048	You	1343	" At this courteous speech a silence falls on the company . Sir Thomas mostly brings silence with him ; he is half- conscious that at his entry voices are choked and laughter quenched , and it serves to exasperate him the more . "
44065	44076	44048	44048	You	1343	" pursues he , in his loud , hectoring voice , "
44110	44111	44089	44089	you	1343	" "
44114	44121	44122	44123	the ladies	1347	" says St. John , drily , "
44153	44180	44181	44181	I	0	" As he speaks , his eyes involuntarily rest on the clear , rose brilliance of the young stranger 's happy , beautiful child - face . "
44192	44199	44202	44203	her father	3631	" says Esther , with a low laugh—"Juliet
44219	44220	44221	44221	He	1349	" "
44240	44281	44238	44238	he	1349	" says the young man , gaily stooping over her and whispering . Seeing them so familiarly and joyously whisper together , Constance looks up with an air of astonished displeasure , which Gerard perceiving , instantly turns towards her . "
44289	44290	44284	44284	you	1349	" "
44293	44294	44284	44284	you	1349	" "

44376	44383	44362	44363	St. John	164	" he repeats , little testily . "
44418	44419	44422	44422	Humbug	310	" "
44424	44436	44422	44422	Humbug	310	" growls Sir Thomas , rising and walking towards the door . "
44453	44464	44465	44465	I	0	" Then he goes out , and bangs the door . "
44486	44510	44465	44465	I	0	" says St. John , insensibly speaking in a louder key now that the autocrat before whom all voices sink has removed himself ; "
44580	44581	44583	44583	me	0	" "
44585	44594	44583	44583	me	0	" says Esther , with a crestfallen sigh . "
44606	44618	44596	44596	I	0	" He sits down on a low chair beside her sofa . "
44625	44636	44596	44596	I	0	" he echoes , with a half - incredulous smile . "
44679	44680	44681	44682	No one	891	" "
44694	44702	44718	44718	Conny	256	" says Miss Blessington , with resignation . "
44714	44715	44716	44716	Conny	256	" "
44720	44748	44718	44718	Conny	256	" shouts Sir Thomas from somewhere in the unseen distance . Conny rises , though reluctantly , and leaves the other two téte - à - téte . "
44758	44784	44749	44750	Miss Blessington	258	" says Esther , presently , for the sake of saying something , catching a little nervously at the first remark that occurred to her . "
44787	44788	44749	44750	Miss Blessington	258	" "

45010	45030	44998	44998	I	0	" raising herself from her cushions to get a straighter , truer look into his bright , grave eyes . "
45033	45049	44998	44998	I	0	" he says , lowering his voice a little , and leaning closelier over her , "
45074	45252	45071	45071	you	164	" And Esther does see , and thinking on Robert Brandon , is uneasily joyful . Ere the arrival of the looked - for bazaar , Miss Craven 's cure is complete . On the day preceding the one appointed for that philanthropic festivity , she has been walking in the late evening about the moon - coloured garden , free from any remaining lameness , leaning on St. John 's arm . She does not need the slight stay , but it pleases him to give and her to receive it . It does not please Miss Blessington , however , watching them from an upper chamber — watching Esther dabble her small hands in the opal water in the great bronze water - lily leaf that makes the basin of the fountain — watching St. John , rapt and absorbed in her pretty foolish chatter . And yet their talk , if she could but hear it , holds nothing obnoxiously fond or flirtatious ; it might be proclaimed by the bellman in the streets . "
45267	45282	45283	45283	You	1369	" the young girl is saying , joyfully ; and the man makes answer , "
45297	45298	45283	45283	You	1369	" "
45303	45317	45283	45283	You	1369	" she cries , bringing together emphatically her two gleaming , wet hands . "
45378	45442	45448	45448	people	3426	" He laughs , and then they are silent . A star falls , hurling itself mysteriously down the sky , and into the dark ; two bats glide past , dusky , noiseless . Bats always seem to me like the ghosts of dead birds , that haunt the green gardens and copses they used to love . St. John speaks presently . "
45461	45462	45452	45452	I	0	" "
45472	45514	45464	45464	I	0	" she answers , sighing . As the ladies retire to bed , Miss Blessington enters Esther 's room — a familiarity which somewhat surprises that virgin , as it is the first time that it has been accorded to her . "
45522	45528	45515	45515	I	0	" Constance says , civilly ; "
45536	45537	45529	45529	you	1369	" "
45542	45543	45529	45529	you	1369	" "
45556	45557	45554	45554	you	1369	" "
45559	45585	45586	45587	St. John	164	" ( turning away her head , in the guilty consciousness of having , despite her soundness of limb , not walked without assistance ) . "
45601	45606	45607	45607	He	1375	" ( playfully . ) "
45615	45622	45623	45623	he	1375	" replies the other , flushing ; "
45629	45630	45631	45631	He	1375	" "
45635	45642	45631	45631	He	1375	" answers Miss Blessington , quickly : "
45668	45669	45645	45645	his	1375	" "
45672	45673	45645	45645	his	1375	" "
45713	45714	45702	45702	he	1375	" "
45732	45743	45702	45702	he	1375	" says Esther , smiling merrily , yet with scorn . "
45754	45768	45745	45745	I	0	" continued Constance , leaning in a graceful artistic pose against the mantelpiece , "
45858	45859	45860	45860	I	0	" "
45865	45875	45860	45860	I	0	" answers the young girl , with sarcastic emphasis ; "
45917	45918	45925	45925	you	1369	" "
45927	45934	45925	45925	you	1369	" ( nodding and smiling ) ; "
45997	45998	46026	46027	a person	759	" "
46001	46020	46026	46027	a person	759	" cries Esther , springing up , and catching hold of her companion 's gauzy dress in detention . "
46049	46050	46041	46042	Mr. Gerard	247	" "
46061	46076	46055	46055	I	0	" replies Constance , with reluctance , half - feigned , half - real ; "
46099	46100	46055	46055	I	0	" "
46109	46116	46117	46117	you	1369	" cries the other , authoritatively , "
46125	46126	46117	46117	you	1369	" "
46158	46159	46149	46149	he	247	" "
46171	46172	46165	46165	I	0	" "
46174	46183	46165	46165	I	0	" ( with rather an awkward laugh ) , "
46276	46408	46440	46440	Adeline	317	" But beautiful Esther , standing there stricken , credulous , with eager , angry eyes , forgets to make the answering greeting . THE Bazaar day has arrived ; so likewise have Constance 's chosen friends , the Misses De Grey ; so likewise has their brother , commonly called Dick De Grey , for no other reason that we wot of but that at his baptism he received the name of Charles . The large open carriage which had so impressed Esther on her first arrival at Brainton station , and St. John 's smart T.-cart , with his big , black horse , at whose head , or rather at some distance below whose nose , a cockaded infant stands trim and tidy , are at the door . "
46415	46432	46440	46440	Adeline	317	" says Miss Blessington , coming out under the portico and unfurling her white Honiton parasol . "
46468	46469	46462	46462	you	1391	" "
46475	46497	46462	46462	you	1391	" he answers , slowly and tardily , not looking up from the gardenia which he is fastening on his coat ; "
46523	46553	46521	46521	you	1391	" ( looking at her imploringly , to back him up in the ready lie to which , for love of her , he has just given vent . ) "
46556	46563	46521	46521	you	1391	" she answers , smiling coldly . "
46650	46776	46778	46778	he	1397	" He stares at her for an instant in blank astonishment ; then , turning away quickly to hide the mortification which he knows to be legible on his face , without a word or a groan helps the oldest , plainest , languidest of the Misses De Grey into the T.-cart and drives off with her . And Esther steps into the sociable , and tries to feel triumphant and dignified , contemplating , for a dozen miles , Miss Georgina De Grey 's gold - dusted hair and featureless face , and submitting meekly to having the modest proportions of her own toilette covered up and smothered in the abundance and volume of her vis - à - vis ' laces and frillings . "
46795	46813	46778	46778	he	1397	" she says to herself , her eyes fixed pensively on the revolving black and yellow wheel ; "
46894	46943	46944	46944	She	1399	" And meanwhile St. John holds dreary converse with himself , while a river of sound , on which the words Nilsson , Romeo e Giulietta , Schneider , drums , Holland House , garden party float , pours into his ear from the direction of his companion . "
47020	47402	47404	47404	me	0	" Precisely seventeen minutes past two of the clock , the Melford town - hall clock , and visitors are beginning to arrive pretty thickly ; three or four barouches , seven or eight waggonettes , and nine or ten pony - carriages , are trotting and walking and crawling up the steep Melford street . Climbing the side of a house is child 's play to the ascent of that most perpendicular of high streets . The doctor 's house , red , and with redder berries thick about its plate - glass windows , stands on your right as you go up the town . The Doctor and the Doctress are issuing from the brass - knockered hall door — she in a grey moire antique , that old Mrs. Evans ' quinsy paid for , and gold bracelets that took their rise from Mr. Watkin 's decline and fall . The town - hall stands in its grey limestone respectability in the market place , over against the Bell Inn ; it has an arched doorway , and under this arch man , woman , and child go pacing in little , smart tulle bonnets and black hats , with their purses full of small change , and their hearts of that most excellent virtue — Christian charity . Round the hall counters are ranged , and behind these counters stand a phalanx of young women , prepared to exert their little abilities in overreaching and circumventing their fathers , lovers , and brothers , to the utmost . Miss Blessington 's stall is next - door neighbour to poor Mrs. Tomkins ' , the Felton curate 's fat , childridden wife — as , in some foreign city , they tell us that you may see marble palaces and mud hovels cheek by jowl ; for , as is a mud hovel to a marble palace , so is poor Mrs. Tomkins in the Melford table of valuation to Miss Blessington . Mrs. Tomkins ' main hope is in her sister , pretty , second - rate , pert Miss Smith , who , with a dog - collar round her waist , to demonstrate its tenuity , and two long , uncurled curls , vulgarly known as "
47408	47707	47406	47406	lads	1401	" floating over her fat shoulders , has been kissing strawberries and rosebuds , and selling them at half - a - crown apiece , to such attorneys ' clerks and doctors ' assistants of weak intellect as inhabit Melford town . On Miss Blessington 's other side the Misses Denzil hold sway — daughters of a neighbour baronet , whom for twenty years past Sir Thomas has hated with the hate of hell , because he once beat him in a contest for the county . Belinda Denzil , an elderly young lady , tall and yellow and stately ; likest to a dandelion among the flowers of the field ; and Priscilla , a beady - eyed , brisk brune , of whom her admirers predicate that she could talk the hind leg off a mule ! Mr. Gerard and Mr. De Grey are strolling about together arm in arm ; criticising the wares a little and the saleswomen a good deal . They are not particularly fond of one another ; but no more was Alexander Selkirk , I dare say , of his next - door neighbour , when he lived in town , if he ever did . All the same , if the said next - door neighbour had happened to land on that most irreligious of desert islands , where the benighted valleys and rocks never heard the sound of the church - going bell , do n't you suppose that he would have rushed into his arms ? So in this desert island of Melford , St. John and Dick , the only two respectable fellows , as they think , among a savage horde of squireens , march about , hooked on together for mutual defence against the barbarians . "
47717	47795	47708	47708	You	1402	" remarks St. John , who , after his wanderings , has at length come to anchor at Miss Blessington 's stall , addressing Esther , but addressing her diffidently , as one that , after the severe and uncalled - for snubbing he had this morning received , was by no means sure of the reception his civilities might meet with , while three old women and a parson squeeze in beside himself and his friend . "
47811	47820	47797	47797	you	1402	" replies Miss Craven , coolly and drily . "
47857	47858	47860	47860	you	0	" "
47864	47865	47860	47860	you	0	" "
47907	47929	47931	47931	I	0	" So speaking , she turns away from him to another customer , as if glad to be rid of him . "
47940	47987	47931	47931	I	0	" asks Mr. De Grey , leaning with languid familiarity over Miss Smith 's counter ( everybody is familiar with Miss Smith ; that is one of her great charms ) , and holding up a gorgeously - embroidered smoking cap between his finger and thumb . "
47995	48038	47931	47931	I	0	" replies the young lady , with glib obsequiousness , all a - twitter with excitement at being addressed by an august being in a cut - away coat who is known throughout the room to be a visitor at Felton Hall . "
48044	48052	48042	48042	me	0	" ( fussing about with unnecessary empressement ) "
48089	48096	48087	48087	he	1404	" ( with a giggle . ) "
48102	48418	48087	48087	he	1404	" retorts he , sucking the top of his cane , and staring at her with lazy impertinence . Meanwhile the room is getting very crowded and stuffy : it is a very small town - hall , and all Melford and the southern half of — — shire are compressed into it — the result being much animal heat , some ill - humour , and infinite grief over rent garments ; which is reversing the case of the ancients , who rent their garments in sign of grief . And in and through and about this warm throng , many girls , emissaries from different stalls , go pushing and elbowing to enlist unwilling subscribers to raffles . Philanthropy has gone nigh to unsexing them ; it has turned modest , reserved ladies into forward importunate Mœnads . Foremost , most energetic , most unrebuffable of these emissaries is Miss Priscilla Denzil . She flies about hither and thither , with her white gown all limp and tumbled , and her rough hair pushing its way resolutely from under the blue ribbons which make a vain show of confining it . She is not thinking a bit of how she is looking ; her whole soul is intent on doing a good stroke of business , and none can escape her . Sir Thomas Gerard has just entered the hall . Having ridden into Melford on magisterial business , the idea has struck him of how much better and more cuttingly he will be able to abuse the bazaar at dinner this evening if he has had the advantage of seeing it . With a dog - whip in his hand , and an intense desire to lay it about the shoulders of the company expressed in his cross face , he is pushing his way along when attacked by the dauntless Priscilla . "
48456	48457	48461	48462	Miss Priscilla	324	" "
48464	48465	48461	48462	Miss Priscilla	324	" "
48471	48472	48461	48462	Miss Priscilla	324	" "
48483	48490	48492	48492	they	1405	" answers the baronet , snarling . "
48521	48522	48512	48512	they	1405	" "
48535	48542	48524	48524	they	1405	" asks Miss Prissy , insinuatingly ( "
48563	48565	48524	48524	they	1405	" ) "
48583	48646	48647	48647	I	0	" replies the gracious elder , walking off . For a minute Priscilla stands still , rebuffed ; but recovering herself , speedily rushes off again , charges with her fender - stool an old maid who has one already , and a poor little whity - brown curate who has no house to put one in , & c. , & c. "
48659	48698	48650	48650	I	0	" Esther is saying , as she gives a parcel into Mr. De Grey 's hands — Miss Smith having at length frightened that gentleman from her side by the rapid strides to intimacy which she was making with him—"My
48724	48760	48813	48813	your	0	" Mr. De Grey has spent a small fortune in pincushions , kettle - holders , dressed dolls , and many other such - like articles which no young man of fashion should be without . "
48773	48782	48770	48771	Miss Craven	164	" asks Gerard , elevating his eyebrows plaintively . "
48807	48808	48813	48813	your	0	" "
48827	48851	48819	48821	Miss De Grey	318	" answers Esther , in the most business - like , shop - woman voice , without smiling , or lifting her eyes . "
48863	48886	48852	48852	I	0	" he says , trying to make her look up at him , as she puts a few shillings into his hand . "
48895	48901	48887	48887	I	0	" she answers , demurely ; "
48908	48909	48852	48852	I	0	" "
48932	48941	48942	48942	I	0	" She smiles a little against her will . "
48950	48960	48961	48961	you	1412	" she says , addressing both young men indifferently : "
48987	48988	48989	48989	Rhadamantha	329	" "
48996	49003	48989	48989	Rhadamantha	329	" says St. John , laughing . "
49018	49019	49009	49009	you	1412	" "
49041	49141	49009	49009	you	1412	" At Miss Blessington 's stall trade is certainly very brisk ; it is considered a fitting mark of respect to the family to buy their goods , and so the honest burgesses of Melford make it a point of honour to buy Miss Blessington 's and Miss De Grey 's blotting books and babies ' socks in preference to anyone else 's , however superior in fabric and less exorbitant in price anybody else 's might be . Miss Blessington has just sunk upon a chair , with an affectation of great fatigue , and is saying languidly , "
49173	49174	49152	49153	that person	1417	" "
49203	49225	49194	49194	you	1419	" suggests Gerard , who is still leaning his elbow on the counter , and has not gone away as commanded . "
49232	49244	49194	49194	you	1419	" pursues Miss Blessington , leaning back and fanning herself vigorously , "
49265	49266	49267	49267	Providence	132	" "
49280	49305	49267	49267	Providence	132	" says St. John , following , with a look of half - disgust in his fastidious eyes , Priscilla 's little dishevelled figure ; "
49321	49416	49417	49417	I	0	" The afternoon draws towards its close ; people have come and bought , and raffled and gone again , carrying manifold ill - tied paper parcels with them . The farmeresses and yeomen 's wives of the Melford district have departed , carrying with them , in their mind 's eye , for imitation against next Sunday , the cut of Miss Blessington 's skirt , and the profuse curls and bandeaux of Miss De Grey 's intricate coiffure . The room is emptying , and the day 's duty approaching its end . "
49423	49450	49417	49417	I	0	" remarks Mr. De Grey , touching St. John on the shoulder as he leans against the wall , gazing somewhat morosely at his own boots , "
49486	49487	49474	49474	I	0	" "
49491	49501	49474	49474	I	0	" answers the other , shaking off dull care ; "
49535	49618	49532	49532	my	0	" At the door there is a little confusion — carriages driving up , carriages driving away ; a small crowd gathered to see the smart ladies ; two policemen . The Felton equipage and Mr. Gerard 's T.-cart stand at some little distance down the street . St. John offers Esther his arm , and she , having no decent excuse for declining , takes it . As they walk along , he speaks to her hurriedly and not without temper . "
49696	49697	49680	49680	you	1426	" "
49710	49733	49701	49701	you	0	" she asks , demurring ; the recollection of his reported insult rankling in her mind . He shrugs his shoulders expressively . "
49769	49770	49761	49761	you	1426	" "
49795	49829	49830	49830	I	0	" she inquires , drily . They have reached the T.-cart , the big black horse , the baby - tiger ; in the low , red sun the new harness shines brightly . "
49840	49849	49833	49833	you	1426	" Gerard says , recovering his good humour . "
49863	49947	49857	49857	you	1426	" Ten minutes more and the Melford steep street and railway bridge are left behind them , they are trotting with smooth briskness between the nutty , briary hedgerows . At first the silence which Gerard had guaranteed threatens to remain unbroken ; it is infringed at last by Esther , out of whose heart the fair late breeze , the happy yellow stillness , and latly the proximity to and solitude with the beloved one , are smoothing all angry creases . ( "
49956	49962	49949	49949	he	1430	" she thinks , sorrowfully , "
49999	50001	49996	49996	I	0	" ) "
50016	50017	49996	49996	I	0	" "
50040	50044	50045	50045	I	0	" She laughs . "
50080	50103	50065	50068	old governesses in trousers	1436	" Silence falls on them again ; broken this time by Gerard , who , turning abruptly towards his companion , says , "
50176	50188	50191	50191	your	0	" She hangs her head like a scolded school - child . "
50194	50195	50191	50191	your	0	" "
50202	50210	50191	50191	your	0	" she answers , rallying her spirits . "

50359	50371	50353	50353	I	0	" she cries , indignantly , answering the indirect accusation directly . "
50393	50407	50379	50379	I	0	" he answers , with more vehemence than the occasion seems to demand . "
50411	50429	50430	50430	I	0	" she says , feeling oppressed by the solemnity of his manner and trying to speak lightly , "
50450	50451	50452	50452	I	0	" "
50463	50471	50456	50456	she	3638	" he answers , shortly and grimly . "
50484	50492	50456	50456	she	3638	" she retorts , a little cynically . "
50520	50526	50516	50516	you	0	" he says , gravely ; "

50666	50673	50661	50661	I	0	" ( a little impatiently . ) "

50707	50718	50700	50701	A person	759	" begins Esther , floundering in confusion among different forms of speech—"I

50815	50833	50773	50773	your	0	" she asks , eagerly , lifting her eyes , brimful of joyful relief , to his . "

50858	50864	50850	50851	a man	3402	" He stops abruptly . ( "

50987	51021	50981	50985	two or three stray men	1463	" This remark is addressed by Miss Blessington to her two friends on the afternoon following the bazaar , and contains a list of the guests expected at dinner at Felton that evening . "
51030	51075	51076	51076	I	0	" says Esther , from a window recess , where , hidden by a drooped curtain , she has been lying perdue up to the present moment , deeply buried in the unwonted luxury of a French novel . Constance gives a little start . "

51104	51133	51089	51091	a few people	1464	" asks Miss De Grey , half turning round her head , and a coquettish little lace morning cap , in the direction whence Esther 's voice proceeds . "
51145	51146	51147	51147	I	0	" "
51158	51162	51150	51150	you	0	" Esther laughs . "
51180	51181	51150	51150	you	0	" "
51198	51199	51194	51196	a fortunate person	1467	" "
51202	51203	51194	51196	a fortunate person	1467	" "
51221	51222	51223	51223	I	0	" "
51229	51230	51223	51223	I	0	" "
51257	51258	51236	51236	you	0	" "
51263	51282	51236	51236	you	0	" answers Esther , reluctantly ; regretting having made an admission which evidently tells so much against her . "
51287	51288	51236	51236	you	0	" "
51294	51328	51236	51236	you	0	" asks her brother , who , with St. John , lounges in from the billiard - room , where they have been knocking the balls about and getting tired of one another . "
51343	51367	51329	51330	Miss Craven	164	" answers Constance , in her even voice — perhaps not sorry of an opportunity to let Gerard know his protégée 's deficiencies . "
51389	51456	51383	51383	she	164	" The protégée droops her black eyes in mortification over her book , in which she has already found several things that amuse , several things that startle , and several other things that profoundly puzzle her innocent mind . How unnecessary to make the admission of her own illiterateness , and how needless for Constance to be in such a hurry to repeat the confession ! "
51469	51491	51383	51383	she	164	" says Gerard 's voice , low and laughing , as he sits down on the window - seat beside her . "
51498	51509	51383	51383	she	164	" She looks up with a re - assured smile . "
51514	51523	51383	51383	she	164	" continues he , glancing at her book , "
51539	51554	51527	51527	your	1472	" She colours a little , and involuntarily puts her hand over the title . "
51563	51624	51560	51560	I	0	" She hesitates , and her other hand goes hastily to its fellow 's help ; then , changing her mind , she offers the book boldly to him . He looks at the title , and a slightly shocked expression dawns on his features : men are always shocked that women should read about the things that they do . "
51631	51636	51627	51627	you	0	" ( quickly ) . "
51665	51666	51637	51637	I	0	" "
51681	51682	51668	51668	you	0	" "

51700	51701	51684	51684	I	0	" "
51706	51712	51715	51715	you	0	" ( rather snappishly ) . "
51717	51736	51715	51715	you	0	" he repeats , impatiently — not much fonder of opposition than are most of his masterful sex . "
51756	51757	51761	51761	me	0	" "
51763	51772	51761	51761	me	0	" ( sitting bolt up and reddening ) . "
51781	51782	51774	51774	you	0	" "
51793	51797	51774	51774	you	0	" She laughs . "
51823	51824	51815	51815	you	0	" "
51831	51832	51833	51833	Child	3639	" "
51850	51851	51833	51833	Child	3639	" "
51866	51872	51854	51856	all modest men	1481	" rejoins she , ironically . "
51896	51897	51880	51880	I	0	" "
51920	51936	51912	51912	you	0	" he asks , astonishment and displeasure fighting together for the mastery in his voice . "
51939	51955	51912	51912	you	0	" ( looking rather frightened , but speaking with a sort of timid bravado ) . "
51992	51993	51988	51988	me	0	" "
51997	52010	51988	51988	me	0	" he says , throwing it with hasty impoliteness into her lap . "
52045	52216	52035	52035	I	0	" So speaking , he rises abruptly , and leaves her side and the room at almost the same moment . When he is gone , finding that the rest of the company have likewise slipped away in different directions , Esther relieves her feelings by flinging the disputed volume on the floor ; sits for a quarter of an hour staring uncertainly at it ; then , pocketing her pride , picks it up , sneaks off with it to the library , and , climbing the high , steep ladder , deposits it in the hole whence she had ravished it , between two of its fellows , as agreeably lax and delicately indelicate as itself . Half an hour later , passing through the hall , she sees the door of Gerard 's sanctum ajar , and hears some one walking to and fro within . To one so praise - loving , the temptation to trumpet forth her own excellence is irresistible . She knocks timidly . "
52220	52221	52035	52035	I	0	" "
52230	52244	52222	52222	I	0	" she answers , standing in beautiful , bashful awkwardness in the aperture . "
52255	52267	52249	52249	I	0	" he asks , advancing towards her , looking slightly surprised . "
52289	52326	52331	52331	you	0	" At the end of her sentence her eyes , downcast at first , raise themselves to his with the innocent , eager expectancy of a child that waits for approbation of some infantile good action . "
52333	52344	52331	52331	you	0	" he cries , joyfully , catching both her hands ; "
52353	52354	52349	52349	I	0	" "
52364	52370	52355	52355	I	0	" she answers , unwillingly . "
52381	52382	52355	52355	I	0	" "
52387	52388	52355	52355	I	0	" "
52396	52397	52355	52355	I	0	" "
52400	52401	52355	52355	I	0	" "
52410	52411	52412	52412	Child	3639	" "
52417	52433	52414	52415	child!—always child	1485	" she cries , puckering up her low forehead into the semblance of a frown . "
52447	52448	52449	52452	A good old woman	1486	" "
52472	52483	52449	52452	A good old woman	1486	" ( seeing that she is about to withdraw . ) "
52490	52491	52449	52452	A good old woman	1486	" "
52499	52510	52449	52452	A good old woman	1486	" pulling her gently in , and closing the door . "
52513	52551	52456	52459	a good old lady!—which	1487	" she says , half embarrassed by this tête - à - tête that she has herself invited , holding up a bunch of scarlet geraniums that she has lately reft from one of the garden 's dazzling squares—"I
52591	52592	52582	52582	I	0	" "
52598	52604	52582	52582	I	0	" he answers , smiling . "
52652	52671	52627	52627	you	0	" as a little scarlet shower confirms his prognostications . She stoops to pick up the scattered blossoms . "
52705	52729	52697	52697	I	0	" she says , kneeling on one knee , and looking up gravely for advice and assistance into his friendly , dark face : "
52736	52737	52745	52745	somebody	1233	" "
52747	52754	52745	52745	somebody	1233	" ( ringing the bell ) . "
52758	52768	52745	52745	somebody	1233	" ( drawing an armchair forwards for her ) . "
52802	52835	52781	52781	you	0	" She obeys , and her eyes wander curiously round . Pipes , whips , saloon pistols , prints of Derby winners ; photographs of Nilsson tricked out in water - weeds as "
52838	52845	52846	52846	Marguerite	292	" of Patti gazing up , as "
52848	52897	52846	52846	Marguerite	292	" into Mario 's fortunate eyes ; a table strewn with books — two or three yellow - paper backed , with enticing Gallic titles , similar to the one she has just so heroically foregone . Looking up from these latter , she involuntarily catches his eye . "
52914	52922	52898	52898	You	0	" he says , laughing rather consciously ; "
52949	52999	52924	52924	I	0	" The gum arrives . She holds the flowers , while he with a paint - brush delicately insinuates one drop into the scarlet heart of each . Their heads are bent so close together that his crisp brown locks brush against the silk - smooth sweep of hers . "
53004	53036	52924	52924	I	0	" cries Esther , pleasantly excited by the consciousness of doing something rather hors de règle in that prim household , in having this impromptu tête - à - tête with its heir—"not
53056	53057	53058	53062	These people that are coming	1492	" "
53079	53086	53058	53062	These people that are coming	1492	" says Gerard , half jealously . "
53094	53095	53096	53096	You	0	" "
53105	53106	53096	53096	You	0	" "
53119	53133	53116	53116	you	0	" she asks , confidentially , looking up at him with childish inquisitiveness . "
53155	53156	53150	53151	Sir Thomas	238	" "
53184	53185	53174	53174	you	0	" "
53209	53210	53204	53207	Echoes of the Clubs	1493	" "
53216	53217	53204	53207	Echoes of the Clubs	1493	" "
53224	53247	53221	53222	St. John	164	" shouts Sir Thomas , banging a swing - door , behind him , and coming heavy - footed through the hall . "
53253	53273	53250	53251	Sir Thomas	238	" says Esther growing suddenly pale : and if she had said , and had had reason to say , "
53279	53491	53276	53277	the Devil	748	" she could not have made the communication in a more tragic whisper : then , not waiting for any advice as to her conduct , snatching up her bouquet , she flies as if shot from a crossbow , out of the window and into the garden . Was not it Lord Chesterfield who said that the guests at a dinner party should never be less than the Graces or more than the Muses ? Kant preferred the Grace number , and had daily two friends , never more , to dine with him . The guests at the Felton banquet greatly exceed the Chesterfieldian limits . Those who have come only to dinner have been bemoaning themselves heavily , as they came along , on the hardship of being forced away from garden and croquet - ground , and obliged to drive three , four , five miles bare - necked and bare - backed — and a woman nowadays in full dress is verily and indeed bare - necked and bare - backed — through the mellow crimson evening . To even these grumblers , however , destiny now appears kinder — now , I say , that the too candid daylight is shut out , that the amber champagne—"With
53499	53825	53276	53277	the Devil	748	" is creaming gently in every glass , and the entrées are making their savoury rounds . Esther has fallen to the lot of one of the stray men of whom Miss Blessington spoke — a man who , when bidden to dinner , complies with the letter of his invitation , and dines chiefly and firstly ; looks upon the lady whom he escorts to the social board as a mere adjunct — an agreeable or disagreeable one , as the case may be , but as merely an adjunct , as the flowers in the vases , or the silver Cupids that uphold the fruit baskets . In the intervals of the courses he has no objection to being amused : it is too much exertion to be very amusing himself , but he is not unwilling to smile and . lend an indulgent ear to his companion 's prattle , so as that prattle does not infringe upon the succulent programme that he has , by diligent study of the menu , laid out for himself . Baffled on her left hand , Miss Craven turns to her right , to be baffled there also . Not that this right - hand neighbour labours under any excessive gourmandise — he is willing , on the contrary , that the unknown , black - eyed innocent and the turtle cutlet should share and share alike in his regards ; but ere a quarter of an hour their conversation has come to a shipwreck . In it he takes too much for granted : as , for example , that she has been to London this season ; that she has seen Faed 's last picture ; that she has been at Lady — 's ball ; that , by having seen both , she is in a position to judge of the comparative merits of Mademoiselle Nilsson 's and Madame Carvalho 's rendering of "
53828	53835	53276	53277	the Devil	748	" Tired at length of saying , "
53841	53842	53836	53836	I	0	" "
53849	53850	53855	53855	her	292	" "
53857	54028	53851	53851	I	0	" she relapses into a mortified silence ; thinking , what an impostor must I be to have thrust myself in among all these fine people — I , who can not even catch their jargon for five minutes ! Foiled in her own little conversational ventures , she tries to listen to other people 's . In vain : if , above the general hum , she catches the beginning of one sentence , it is immediately joined on to the end of another . As well , listening to the sultry buzz of a swarm of bees , might one try to distinguish each separate voice . But the dumb show , at least , is left her : the waggling heads , the moving jaws — poor jaws , that have to talk and eat both at once ! To put a history to each of these heads — to pick out characters by watching the delicate shades of difference with which each person sits ; says , "
54034	54555	54032	54032	you	1495	" laughs — this is not unamusing . Yes , to study the faces , and find similitudes for them : one nut - cracker ; several flowers ; one plum - pudding ; one horse , one vulture , one door - knocker . She is puzzled to find a resemblance for all ; for Belinda Denzil , for instance , who , virginally clad in white muslin , that seems to mock her thirty celibate years , is apparently forcing the suave yet weary De Grey into an up - hill , one - sided flirtation . No man has hired Belinda , and it is , with her , the eleventh hour . What fowl , or fish , or quadruped , or article of furniture is she most like ? Before Esther can decide this point quite to her mind , the signal of retirement is given , and each maid and wife rises obedient and vanishes . It is the general complaint in the Felton neighbourhood that at that house the men sit unfashionably , wearisomely long over their wine . Sir Thomas belongs to that excellent school that in their hearts regret the good old days , when a man never rejoined the ladies without seeing double their real number . Half an hour , three - quarters of an hour , an hour and a quarter have passed . Several girls are beginning to yawn behind their fans ; the Misses De Grey are driving heavily through a long duet , with never a squire to turn over the leaves ( in the wrong place ) for them . The door opens , and a fat , bald head appears ; the most uninteresting always come first , but , like Noah 's dove , he is the harbinger of better things . Five minutes more , and the room is as full of broadcloth as of silk and satin . The younger men are still hovering about uncertainly , unfixed as yet in their minds as to which elaborate fair one they shall come to final anchor by . The epicure , now that there is nothing to eat , casts his eyes round in search of the finest woman and the comfortablest chair to be found in the great gilded room . Both requisites he finds united in Esther 's neighbourhood . Accordingly he is moving towards her , when his attention is happily arrested by a remark that he overhears as to the best method of dressing beccaficos . Instantly Miss Craven 's white , silky shoulders and red - pouted lips go out of his head . White shoulders and red lips are good things in their way , but what are they to beccaficos Esther draws a long breath of relief . What an escape ! In a minute more suspense is ended , and the low armchair beside her is occupied by the person for whom it was intended — for whom , indeed , she has been slyly keeping it half - covered by her dress . "
54565	54639	54561	54561	you	1496	" says Gerard , asking a silly question for want of a wiser one occurring to him , and looking rather affectionate . St. John is not in the very least degree elevated ; but it is useless to deny that the best and fondest of men are still fonder after dinner than before : it must be a very , very deep love that can not be a little deepened by champagne . "
54663	54680	54653	54655	that odious gourmand	1497	" she answers , not taking any great trouble to hide her pleasure in his neighbourhood . "
54697	54698	54694	54694	I	0	" "
54707	54714	54699	54699	I	0	" she says , rather viciously , "
54740	54741	54728	54728	I	0	" "
54753	54771	54744	54744	you	0	" answers Gerard , chiefly to tease her , but partly also because he really thinks so . "
54778	54784	54785	54785	I	0	" he continues , laughing . "
54815	54816	54809	54809	you	0	" "
54822	54828	54829	54829	I	0	" she answers , simply ; "
54863	54864	54874	54874	you	0	" "
54891	54892	54880	54882	some of them	548	" "
54898	54914	54916	54918	that old woman	1506	" ( indicating with the slightest possible motion of her head the persons alluded to ) "
54959	54960	54943	54943	they	1507	" "
54974	54975	54971	54971	I	0	" "
54985	54991	54976	54976	They	1507	" she continues , gravely ; "
55020	55021	55023	55023	they	1507	" "
55025	55062	55023	55023	they	1507	" he says , a transient thought flashing through his mind as to whether , after twenty years of wedlock , that blooming peach face would have gained any likeness to his hard , mahogany one . "
55072	55073	55074	55074	He	3613	" "
55096	55101	55102	55102	You	0	" He looks amused . "
55114	55115	55102	55102	You	0	" "
55120	55126	55117	55117	I	0	" she asks , naively ; "
55166	55167	55102	55102	You	0	" "
55171	55202	55102	55102	You	0	" he says , involuntarily drawing his chair closer to hers , and leaning forward under pretence of looking at the flowers that make a scarlet fire in her hair . "
55215	55340	55341	55341	He	1517	" She forgets to reply to his harmless question , while her eyes fall troubled , half - frightened : the eyes that can not , without a theft upon a third person , give him back his tender looks — the eyes in whose pupils Brandon is to see himself reflected for the next forty , fifty , sixty years . There is a little stir and flutter among the company : Belinda Denzil moving to the piano ; a music - stool screwed up and down ; gloves taken off ; then a polite hush , infringed only by a country gentleman in the distance saying something rather loud about guano , while Belinda informs her assembled friends in a faint soprano that "
55350	55410	55341	55341	He	1517	" She has made the same asseveration any time the last ten years ; but he has not returned yet , and her relatives begin to be afraid that he never will . During the song Gerard falls into a reverie . At the end , coming out of it , he asks with an abrupt change of subject : "
55422	55423	55413	55413	you	4219	" "
55430	55431	55413	55413	you	4219	" "
55435	55442	55432	55433	Glan Ravvon	345	" ( following her pronunciation . ) "
55469	55470	55453	55454	Glan Ravvon	345	" "
55482	55483	55413	55413	you	4219	" "
55507	55508	55413	55413	you	4219	" "
55529	55530	55413	55413	you	4219	" "
55545	55546	55413	55413	you	4219	" "
55551	55566	55413	55413	you	4219	" he repeats , as if trying to overtake a recollection that eludes him . "
55579	55580	55582	55582	you	0	" "
55584	55589	55582	55582	you	0	" ( eagerly . ) "
55592	55593	55582	55582	you	0	" "
55625	55633	55620	55623	the Fitz - Maurices	346	" Esther 's countenance falls a little . "
55643	55649	55634	55634	I	0	" she says , uncertainly . "
55659	55660	55652	55652	they	1040	" "
55671	55677	55668	55668	I	0	" she replies , doubtfully . "
55701	55740	55692	55692	I	0	" She does not answer for a moment , but only furls and unfurls her fan uneasily ; then , looking up with a sudden , honest impulse , speaks , colouring up to the eyes the while . "
55808	55839	55805	55806	small ones	1531	" He looks thoroughly annoyed . The idea that the woman of his choice is by her own confession not exactly on his own level , grates upon his pride . "
55842	55848	55849	55850	one gentleman	1532	" he says , brusquely , "
55871	55872	55869	55869	ladies	1534	" "
55885	55917	55876	55876	you	164	" interrupts Constance , sweeping up to them , resplendent but severe , in green satin and seaweed , like a nineteenth century Nereid , if such an anachronism could exist . "
55921	55932	55933	55933	We	1530	" looking rather sulky , and not offering to move . "
55949	55957	55959	55959	himself	164	" Let them play double - dummy ! "
55978	55981	55959	55959	himself	164	" Absurd ! "
55982	56001	56023	56024	Mrs. Annesley	347	" If you are so anxious to oblige them , why can not you take a hand yourself ? "
56002	56010	55959	55959	himself	164	" You know how I detest cards ! "
56011	56021	56023	56024	Mrs. Annesley	347	" And you know how I detest Mrs. Annesley . "
56068	56076	56078	56078	Esther	148	" How could you be so disobliging ? "
56095	56101	56102	56102	he	335	" Why should n't I ? "
56107	56172	56102	56102	he	335	" Believe me , it is the worst plan possible to encourage the idea that you are good - natured among your own people ; it subjects you to endless impositions . For the last thirty years I have been struggling to establish a character for never doing what I am asked ; would you have me undo all my work at one blow ? "
56173	56179	56181	56181	Constance	256	" St. John is impracticable , "
56211	56273	56181	56181	Constance	256	" You must accept of me as his substitute , please ; he is good - naturedly devoting himself to my little friend . Did you happen to notice her , Lady Bolton ? She is really looking quite pretty to - night . She does not know anybody , poor child ! and he was afraid she might feel neglected . "
56417	56430	56431	56431	She	1549	" Nature takes no notice of those that are coming or going . "
56578	56588	56566	56566	him	190	" He goeth heavily , as one that mourneth . "
56713	56726	56733	56733	he	190	" The lust of the flesh , the lust of the eye , "
56818	56838	56800	56800	He	190	" ..... love is not loveThat alters when it alteration finds , Or bends with the remover to remove . "
56927	56935	56936	56936	Care	348	" All is not gold that glitters . "
57079	57088	57089	57089	she	164	" What shall I do?—what shall I do ? "
57120	57539	57540	57540	One	559	" Oh ! if I had some one to advise me!—not that I would take their advice , if it were to give up St. John ! Give him up ! How can I give up what I have not got ? Oh Bob , Bob , if you only knew how I hate you!—Only less than I hate myself ! Oh ! why was not my tongue cut out before that unlucky day when I said I would try to like you ? Try , indeed ! If there is need for trying , one may know how the trial will end . Shall I tell St. John ? What ! volunteer an unasked confession ? Warn him off Robert 's territory when he is not thinking of trespassing ? And if I were to tell him — oh Heaven ! I had sooner put my hand into a lion 's mouth — what would he think of me ? He , with his fastidious , strict ideas of what a woman should be and do and look ? Shall I write and ask Bob to let me off ? It would not break his heart ; he is too good ; only bad people ever break their hearts , as I shall do some day , I dare say . Oh ! poor Bob , how badly I am treating you ! Poor Bob ! and his yellow roses that St. John made such fun of ! How I wish that the thoughts of your long legs and your little sour Puritan sisters did not make me feel so sick ! Oh ! if you would but be good enough to jilt me ! What shall I do?—what shall I do ? Wait , wait , go on waiting for what will never come , probably , and when I have degraded myself by waiting till hope is quite dead , go back whence I came , and jig - jog through life alongside of Bob in a poke bonnet like his mamma 's . Ah Jack , Jack ! why did I ever leave you ? How I wish that all Bobs and St. Johns and other worries were at the bottom of the Red Sea , and you and I king and queen of some desert island , where there was nothing nearer humanity than monkeys and macaws , and where there was no rent nor workmen 's wages nor lovers to torment us ! "
57784	57795	57796	57796	she	148	" I — I — I have lost my locket , "
57805	57810	57811	57811	he	1578	" You up still ! "
57817	57873	57811	57811	he	1578	" Lost your locket , have you ? Oh ! by - the - by , I found it just now ; here it is . Do you know ( with a smile ) I could not resist the temptation of looking to see who you had got inside it . Are you very angry ? "
57874	57877	57878	57878	she	148	" Very ! "
57922	57961	57962	57962	he	1578	" Do n't go ; stay and talk a minute . It is so pleasant to think that we are the only conscious , sentient beings in the house — all the others sleeping like so many pigs , "
57993	58005	58006	58006	She	148	" No , no , I cannot — I must not . "
58044	58048	58049	58049	he	1578	" Five minutes , "
58068	58083	58084	58084	she	148	" If you prevent my going , of course I can not help myself , "
58101	58110	58084	58084	she	148	" Do n't be offended ! Do you know "
58119	58137	58065	58065	he	1578	her)—"do you know what I have been doing ever since you went — not to bed apparently ? "
58138	58147	58084	58084	she	148	" Drinking brandy and soda - water , probably "
58159	58227	58084	58084	she	148	" That would have been hardly worth mentioning . I have been wondering whether my luck is on the turn . I have been da — I mean very unlucky all my life . I never put any money on a horse that he was not sure to be nowhere . Luck does turn , sometimes , does n't it ? Do you think mine is turning ? "
58228	58234	58065	58065	he	1578	" How can I tell ? "
58235	58259	58084	58084	she	148	" You do n't ask in what way I have been so unlucky . Why do n't you ? Have you no curiosity ? "
58260	58268	58270	58270	Esther	148	" I never like to seem inquisitive , "
58292	58310	58276	58276	he	1578	" Do you recollect my telling you that I had made a great fool of myself once ? "
58311	58314	58065	58065	he	1578	" Yes . "
58315	58329	58332	58332	his	1578	" Do you care to hear about it , or do you not ? "
58344	58350	58351	58351	she	148	" Yes , I care , "
58381	58427	58351	58351	she	148	" Well , it was about a woman , of course . Cela va sans dire ; a man never can get into a scrape without a woman to help him , any more than he can be born , or learn his A B C. "
58428	58433	58351	58351	she	148	" Was she handsome ? "
58490	58514	58521	58521	his	1578	" Pretty well . She had a thundering good figure , and knew how to use her eyes . By - the - by "
58525	58552	58521	58521	his	1578	" so do you . I often wish you did not ; I hate being able to trace one point of resemblance between you and her . "
58553	58559	58561	58561	Esther	148	" Did she refuse you ? "
58584	58656	58657	58657	he	1584	" Not she ! I should not have been the one to blame her if she had ; one can not quarrel with people for their tastes . She swore she liked me better than any one else in the world ; that she would go down to Erebus with me , be flayed alive for me — all the protestations usual in such cases , in fact , I suppose , "
58661	58667	58669	58669	Essie	180	" And threw you over ? "
58690	58781	58669	58669	Essie	180	" Exactly ; had meant nothing else all along . I filled only the pleasant and honourable situation of decoy duck to lure on shyer game , and when the bird was limed — such a bird , too ! a great , heavy , haw - haw brute in the Carabineers , with a face like a horse — she pitched me away as coolly as you would pitch an old shoe — or as you would pitch me , I dare say , if you had the chance . "
58782	58789	58791	58791	Essie	180	" And what did you do ? "
58820	58962	58963	58963	He	1585	" Run him through the body , do you suppose?—spitted him like a lark or a woodcock?—cut out his heart and made her eat it , as the man did to his wife in that fine old Norman story ? No ; I could have done any of them with pleasure if I had had the chance ; with all our veneering and French polish , I think the tiger is only half dead in any of us ; but I did not ; I did none of them : I — prepare for bathos , please — I went out hunting ; it was in winter , and , as misfortunes never come singly , I staked one of the best horses I ever was outside of : that diverted the current of my grief a little , I think . "
59008	59018	59023	59023	her	180	" And she told you she was fond of you "
59036	59072	59073	59073	he	1585	" Scores of times — swore it . I suppose it is no harder to tell a lie a hundred times than once ; ce n'est que le premier pas que coûte . Tell me , "
59099	59138	59073	59073	he	1585	" you are a woman , you must know — tell me , is there no difference between truth and lies ? have they both exactly the same face ? How is a man to tell them apart ? "
59211	59219	59220	59220	she	180	" I — I — don't know , "
59246	59253	59254	59254	he	1585	" Do you ever tell untruths ? "
59285	59301	59254	59254	he	1585	" Do n't be angry with me , but I sometimes fancy that you might . "
59302	59310	59254	59254	he	1585	" I ! what do you mean ? "
59326	59340	59254	59254	he	1585	" Is thy servant a dog that he should do , this thing ? "
59364	59370	59371	59371	he	1585	" You must forgive me , "
59376	59416	59371	59371	he	1585	" I suppose it is my own unlucky experience that has made me so suspicious ; because my own day has been cloudy , I have wisely concluded upon the non - existence of the sun . But , come "
59423	59451	59452	59452	He	1585	" one good turn deserves another : have you nothing to tell me in return for the long list of successes I have been confiding to you ? "
59590	59594	59596	59596	Constance	256	" Miss Craven ! "
59632	59641	59647	59647	herself	258	" It is a pity , St. John , "
59662	59701	59643	59644	Miss Blessington	258	" that you and Miss Craven should choose such a very unseasonable time for your interviews ; it is not a very good example for the servants , if any of them should happen to find you here . "
59702	59720	59722	59723	St. John	164	" The servants have something better to do than to come prying and eavesdropping upon their betters , "
59746	59758	59760	59760	Constance	256	" You are mistaken if you think I have been eavesdropping , "
59784	59810	59760	59760	Constance	256	" I could not sleep , and came down to look for a book . Pray do n't let me disturb your téte - à- téte "
59817	59826	59828	59829	St. John	164	" Do n't be a fool , Conny ! "
59849	59865	59841	59841	his	1596	" it is the purest accident your having found Miss Craven and me together here ! "
59866	59874	59875	59875	she	148	" I am well aware of that , "
59884	59911	59875	59875	she	148	" You know what I mean , perfectly well : it is the purest accident our being here . Miss Craven lost her locket , and — "
59912	59914	59955	59955	her	148	" And "
59917	59947	59955	59955	her	148	still)—"and you have been helping her to look for it . Yes , I see . Well , I — hope you will find it . Good - night ! "
59957	59966	59968	59968	Essie	180	" What did she say?—what does she mean ? "
59983	59997	59999	60000	St. John	164	" What does it matter what she means ? She 's a fool ! "
60004	60019	59999	60000	St. John	164	" Go to bed , and do n't think about her ; who cares ? "
60285	60299	60395	60395	Esther	148	" Gogoniant ir Tad , ac ir Mab , ac ir Yspryd Glan ; "
60303	60321	60395	60395	Esther	148	" Glory be to the Father , and to the Son , and to the Holy Ghost . "
60322	60329	60350	60351	Jack Craven	146	" Gwared ni , Arglywd daionus ! "
60330	60337	60395	60395	Esther	148	" Good Lord , deliver us ! "
60338	60342	60395	60395	Esther	148	" Na Ladratta ! "
60343	60349	60350	60351	Jack Craven	146	" Thou shalt not steal ! "
61042	61070	61093	61093	she	258	" Do you know , I have half a mind to go to Radley church this afternoon . Will any one come with me?—will you , Conny ? "
61086	61092	61093	61093	she	258	" How far is it ? "
61123	61134	61135	61135	She	258	" Three or four miles ; four , I suppose . "
61143	61169	61135	61135	She	258	" Four miles there , and four miles back ! Are you mad , St. John ? What do you suppose one is made of ? "
61181	61217	61178	61179	Miss Craven	164	" turning eagerly to Esther . She tilts her hat low down over her little , straight , Greek nose , looks up at him with shy coquetry under the brim , but answers not . "
61255	61267	61231	61232	a god	1637	" ( with a persuasive ring in his pleasant voice ) ; "
61273	61274	61268	61268	you	148	" "
61284	61291	61281	61282	St. John	164	" cries Miss Blessington , pettishly . "
61302	61303	61305	61305	you	148	" "
61307	61314	61305	61305	you	148	" ( appealing to her . ) "
61347	61361	61362	61362	I	0	" ( turning sweet red cheeks and quick eyes towards her hostess . ) "
61372	61405	61407	61407	you	148	" responds Miladi , leaning back and fanning herself with a large fan ( I believe that fat women often suffer a foretaste of the torments of the damned in the matter of heat)—"so
61459	61460	61450	61451	Sir Thomas	238	" "
61479	61486	61464	61465	Sir Thomas	238	" answers St. John , disrespectfully . "
61503	61528	61464	61465	Sir Thomas	238	" asks Esther , as she steps out briskly beside her companion , while heart and conscience keep up a quarrelsome dialogue within her . "
61540	61541	61542	61542	You	148	" "
61548	61549	61542	61542	You	148	" "
61569	61570	61555	61555	I	0	" "
61575	61596	61573	61573	you	148	" she asks , turning a wondering rosy face set in the frame of a minute white bonnet towards him . "
61611	61629	61573	61573	you	148	" he asks , laughing , and switching off a fern - head with a baby umbrella — "
61700	61739	61697	61697	you	1647	" There has been rain in the morning ; now the clouds have rent themselves asunder , and broken up into great glistering rocks , peaks , and spires , such as no fuller on earth could white : "
61747	61810	61811	61811	I	0	" The breeze comes more freshly over the wet grasses and flowers , and blows in little fickle puffs against St. John 's bronzed cheeks and Esther 's carnation ones . The girl 's heart is pulsing with a keen , sharp joy ; all the keener , as the heaven 's blue is deeper for the clouds that hover about it . "
61822	61828	61829	61829	he	1649	" she is saying inwardly ; "
61891	61911	61857	61857	Bob	190	" Then let come what come mayNo matter if I go mad , I shall have had my day . "
61912	61920	61857	61857	Bob	190	" Let me carry your prayer book ? "
61921	61930	61857	61857	Bob	190	" No , thanks ; it is not heavy "
61947	61961	61857	61857	Bob	190	" I am like a retriever ; I like to have something to carry "
61972	61991	61857	61857	Bob	190	" ' Esther Craven from Robert Brandon . ' Who is Robert Brandon when he is at home ? "
62069	62075	62033	62033	she	148	neck—"Like lead into the sea ? "
62189	62194	62196	62197	St. John	164	" Who is Robert Brandon "
62224	62234	62238	62238	she	148	" He is the man I am engaged to , "
62245	62254	62258	62258	she	148	" He is in the — th foot . "
62285	62291	62258	62258	she	148	" An ally of yours ? "
62296	62305	62306	62306	she	148	" I have known him all my life , "
62311	62328	62330	62330	Gerard	258	" I thought he was a very young child , from this specimen of his caligraphy , "
62342	62355	62330	62330	Gerard	258	" He would be none the worse for a few writing lessons . "
62388	62400	62402	62402	he	1659	" It was a fact worth inscribing , I must say , "
62404	62413	62402	62402	he	1659	ironically—"the making of such a very handsome present , "
62435	62453	62402	62402	he	1659	" He must have had a great deal of change out of sixpence , I should think . "
62454	62467	62469	62469	Esther	148	" If you have nothing better to do than abuse my property , "
62480	62488	62469	62469	Esther	148	" you may give it me back , "
62495	62499	62501	62502	St. John	164	" I apologise , "
62506	62523	62501	62502	St. John	164	" I did not mean to offend you ; I give you carte blanche to insult mine "
62535	62558	62501	62502	St. John	164	" But may I ask , is Mr. Robert Blandon , or Brandon , or what 's his name , your godfather ? "
62559	62564	62501	62502	St. John	164	" No ; why ? "
62565	62621	62501	62502	St. John	164	" Because I never heard of any one being given a prayer book except as a wedding present , or by their godfathers and godmothers at their baptism . As you are not married , I know it could not have been the first case , and so I concluded it must be the last . "
62622	62633	62635	62635	Essie	180	" Robert is not old enough to be my godfather , "
62650	62663	62664	62664	she	180	" he is quite young ; a great deal younger than you , "
62670	62677	62679	62680	St. John	164	" He might easily be that , "
62684	62743	62679	62680	St. John	164	" Once , not so very many years ago , in whatever company I was , I always was the youngest present ; now , on the contrary , in whatever company I am , I always feel the eldest present . I do n't suppose I always am , but I always feel as if I were . "
62744	62758	62760	62760	Esther	148	" I believe old people have the best of it , after all , "
62769	62794	62760	62760	Esther	148	" they have certainly fewer troubles than young ones . I should say that Sir Thomas was decidedly a happier man than you are . "
62795	62812	62814	62815	St. John	164	" A man 's happiness is proportioned to the simplicity of his tastes , I suppose , "
62819	62863	62814	62815	St. John	164	" Sir Thomas 's happiness lies in a nutshell : he has two ruling passions — eating and bullying ; he has a very fair cook to satisfy the one , and my mother always at hand for the gratification of the other . "
62864	62872	62874	62874	Esther	148	" We have all our ruling passions , "
62881	62900	62874	62874	Esther	148	" only very often we will not own them . Mine is burnt almonds ; what is yours ? "
62901	62906	62907	62907	he	1661	" Going to church , "
62915	62933	62907	62907	he	1661	" as you may perceive by the strenuous efforts I have made to get there this afternoon . "
63110	63119	63082	63082	he	1670	" Dear little soulsIn nice white stoles , — "
63216	63232	63203	63203	She	180	" She was most beautiful to see , Like a lady from a far countree . "
63274	63285	63287	63288	the Bedouin	1675	" Blessed be God , who has made beautiful women ! "
63324	63328	63323	63328	the " dear little souls "	4326	" dear little souls "
63335	63359	63323	63328	the " dear little souls "	4326	" There God for ever sitteth , Himself of all the Crown;The Lamb , the Light that shineth , And goeth never down . "
63424	63435	63437	63437	Essie	180	" Is not there some different way of going home ? "
63485	63504	63537	63538	the parson	1652	" I hate going back the same way one came ; it shows such a want of invention ! "
63505	63511	63513	63514	St. John	164	" There is another way , "
63587	63607	63576	63576	Jill	358	" but it is a good deal longer and a great deal muddier than the one we came by . "
63608	63613	63615	63615	Essie	180	" I like mud , "
63634	63661	63615	63615	Essie	180	" it is my native element ; at home we are up to our knees in mud in winter , and over our ankles in summer . "
63801	63809	63817	63818	St. John	164	" This is the Gate of Heaven . "
63810	63815	63817	63818	St. John	164	" It strikes me , "
63833	63868	63817	63818	St. John	164	hour—"it strikes me as one of the few instances in which one 's experience tallies with what one reads in novels , the awkward knack people have of interrupting one at the wrong moment . "
63869	63874	63876	63876	Essie	180	" How do you mean "
63886	63890	63892	63892	he	1701	" I never , "
63913	64016	64017	64017	Esther	148	forehead—"I never read aloud to any one in my life — I was rather fond of reading poetry at one period of my history , I leave you to guess which — not that she cared about it — she did not know Milton from Tommy Moore ; but I never read to her in the course of my life without the footman coming in to put coals on at the most affecting passages — Arthur 's parting from Guinivere , say , or Medora 's death — and clattering down the tongs and shovel , making the devil 's own row . "
64020	64030	64017	64017	Esther	148	" These reflections are à propos of — what ? "
64031	64043	64044	64044	he	1702	" Of Conny 's most ill - timed entry last night , "
64050	64124	64044	64044	he	1702	" I do n't suppose she makes such a midnight raid once in five years , and she certainly could not have found you and me téte - à - téte at two in the morning more than once in fifty years . Why could not she leave us in peace that once ? We did not grudge her any amount of pleasant dreams ; why need she grudge us our pleasant wakefulness ? "
64125	64136	64138	64138	Essie	180	" Do you think she came on purpose , then ? "
64170	64223	64224	64224	he	1702	" Can not say , I 'm sure . Conny is not much in the habit of burning the midnight oil in the pursuit of knowledge generally . If it was accident , she came in at a wonderfully à propos , or rather mal à propos , moment . Tell me , "
64245	64332	64224	64224	he	1702	" I may be mistaken — it is a misfortune to which I am often incident — but I could not help thinking that , just as that unlucky candle appeared round the corner last night , you were going to tell me something — something about yourself ? I thought I saw it in your face . I think I deserved some little reward for raking up for your behoof the ashes of that old fire that I burnt my fingers at so badly once . "
64356	64365	64366	64366	he	1702	" Are lamplight and the small hours indispensable accessories "
64375	64385	64366	64366	he	1702	words—"or could not you tell me as well now ? "
64386	64390	64391	64391	she	148	" Tell you what "
64418	64424	64391	64391	she	148	" must I invent something ? "
64425	64436	64437	64437	he	1702	" Are you sure that it is necessary to invent ? "
64479	64487	64488	64488	she	148	" What am I to tell you ? "
64509	64560	64488	64488	she	148	" that I live in an old farm - house with my brother Jack , and that we are very hard up — you know already ; that ' Sudrydachi ' is Welsh for ' How do you do ' and that our asparagus has answered very badly this year ? "
64561	64572	64573	64573	he	1702	" Of course , I can not force your confidence , "
64579	64601	64602	64602	she	148	" Why do you insist upon my having something to confide ? What reason have you for supposing that I have ? "
64609	64621	64602	64602	she	148	" None whatever , but what you yourself have given me ! "
64622	64625	64666	64666	his	1702	" I ! "
64626	64663	64666	64666	his	1702	" Yes , you ; not your words , but your face now and then . Do n't think me impertinent . You know what unhappy reason I have had to be suspicious . But tell me "
64683	64706	64707	64707	Esther	148	companion)—"tell me whether there is not something between you and — and — that fellow that gave you the prayer - book ? "
64904	64911	64912	64912	she	148	" What is that to you ? "
64929	64933	64934	64934	he	1712	" Nothing whatever , "
64951	64956	64958	64958	Esther	148	" Are you angry ? "
64972	64980	64981	64981	he	1712	" I ? not in the least , "
65002	65020	65021	65021	she	148	" You look excessively cross , and have not uttered a word for the last half mile , "
65055	65076	65077	65077	he	1712	" When I do not get civil answers to civil questions , I think it best to hold my tongue , "
65103	65115	65117	65117	Essie	180	" People 's ideas differ as to what are civil questions , "
65135	65156	65117	65117	Essie	180	" Suppose that I had asked you how many times you had been refused , would you have answered me ? "
65157	65162	65163	65163	he	1712	" Undoubtedly I should , "
65168	65175	65176	65176	she	180	" How many times have you ? "
65202	65218	65219	65219	he	1712	" Questions should be answered in the order of priority in which they are asked , "
65243	65254	65255	65255	Esther	148	" Answer my question , and I 'll answer yours . "
65296	65306	65307	65307	he	1712	" Give me an answer one way or another , "
65314	65324	65307	65307	he	1712	" Is there not something between you and him ? "
65329	65331	65325	65325	Esther	148	" No "
65344	65346	65325	65325	Esther	148	" Yes "
65371	65379	65380	65380	he	1712	" For God 's sake answer me ! "
65422	65425	65426	65426	she	148	" Nothing ! "
65447	65461	65462	65462	he	1712	" Why do you turn away your face ? Are you quite certain ? "
65475	65478	65479	65479	she	148	" Certain , "
65502	65518	65519	65519	he	1712	" Why do you stammer and blush , then , whenever his name is mentioned ? "
65526	65537	65538	65538	she	148	" I wo n't stand being catechised in this way , "
65570	65594	65595	65595	she	148	" I have answered a question which you ought never to have asked ; you must be a person of very little observation , "
65600	65644	65595	65595	she	148	" not to have discovered during the three weeks that I have been with you that I blush at everything and nothing ; I should be as likely as not to blush when Sir Thomas 's name was mentioned , or — or — "
65645	65649	65651	65652	St. John	164	" Or mine , "
65656	65665	65651	65652	St. John	164	" put it as strongly as you can . "
65666	65674	65675	65675	she	148	" Or yours , if you like , "
65730	65735	65736	65736	she	148	" No , no ! "
65747	65759	65760	65760	He	1721	rung—"I hate being helped over stills . Go on , please . "
65978	65985	65986	65986	he	1721	" Shall I go on still ? "
66017	66038	66039	66039	she	148	" I believe you knew of this , and brought me here on purpose to make a fool of me , "
66044	66052	66053	66053	he	1721	" I did nothing of the kind , "
66058	66083	66053	66053	he	1721	" Last time I was here there was a plank thrown across ; but you see the stream has been higher than it is now "
66102	66110	66053	66053	he	1721	" and has probably carried it away . "
66111	66119	66120	66120	she	148	" How am I to get over ? "
66135	66141	66142	66142	he	1721	" I 'll carry you , "
66151	66170	66142	66142	he	1721	" the brook is shallower farther down ; I can lift you over with the greatest ease imaginable . "
66171	66177	66179	66179	Esther	148	" That you sha n't ! "
66188	66194	66195	66195	he	1721	" May I ask why ? "
66200	66228	66195	66195	he	1721	" After the number of times I have carried you up and down stairs at Felton , you can hardly be afraid of my letting you fall ? "
66229	66253	66254	66254	she	148	" The very fact of my having already had so many obligations to you makes me resolved not to add to their number , "
66280	66301	66303	66303	he	1721	" If you can suggest any better plan , I shall be delighted to assist you in carrying it out , "
66309	66314	66315	66315	she	148	" I 'll jump ! "
66335	66340	66341	66341	he	1721	" You can not , "
66346	66365	66341	66341	he	1721	" you 'll get a ducking as sure as I stand here . Do n't be so silly ! "
66368	66370	66315	66315	she	148	" silly "
66406	66419	66421	66421	Gerard	238	" As headstrong as an allegory on the banks of the Nile ! "
66531	66538	66539	66539	she	148	" What a fool I was ! "
66576	66592	66593	66593	she	148	" Why do n't you laugh at me ? why do n't you jeer me ? "
66598	66642	66593	66593	she	148	" why do n't you tell me you are very glad of it , and that I richly deserve it , as I see you are longing to do ? Anything would be better than standing there like a stock or a stone ! "
66643	66658	66659	66659	he	1721	" It is not of much consequence how I stand or how I look , "
66664	66681	66659	66659	he	1721	" It would be more to the purpose to know how you are to get home ! "
66682	66690	66691	66691	she	148	" I will walk as I am , "
66700	66736	66691	66691	she	148	" it will be a fit penance for my idiocy , and you shall go on ahead . I do n't want you to be disgraced by being seen in company with such an object . "
66737	66747	66748	66748	he	1721	" That is very probable , is n't it ? "
66756	66820	66748	66748	he	1721	" No , I have a better proposition than that , I think . It has just occurred to me that an old servant of ours lives at no great distance from here , her cottage is not more than three or four fields off . If you can manage to get there she would dry your clothes for you in a minute . "
66894	66910	66911	66911	she	148	" You have had almost enough of taking me out to walk , I expect , "
66918	66931	66932	66932	he	1734	" You have had almost enough of jumping brooks , I expect , "
66993	67006	67008	67008	he	1734	" Are you at home , Mrs. Brown ? How are you ? "
67036	67055	67057	67058	the person	1741	" Quite well , thank you , Mr. St. John ; I hope I see you the same , "
67081	67096	67057	67058	the person	1741	" it 's a long time since we 've seen you come our way . "
67097	67117	67057	67058	the person	1741	" So it is , Mrs. Brown ; but , you see , I have been after the partridges . "
67118	67134	67057	67058	the person	1741	" And Sir Thomas , I hope he keeps pretty well , Mr. St. John ? "
67135	67140	67057	67058	the person	1741	" Yes , thanks . "
67141	67152	67057	67058	the person	1741	" And Miladi , I hope she has her health . "
67153	67158	67057	67058	the person	1741	" Yes , thanks . "
67159	67165	67057	67058	the person	1741	" And Miss Bl — ? "
67166	67167	67057	67058	the person	1741	" "
67172	67188	67057	67058	the person	1741	" interrupts St. John , rather impatiently , breaking through the thread of her interrogatories . "
67228	67229	67214	67214	you	1744	" "
67241	67243	67245	67246	Mrs. Brown	367	" ! "
67277	67303	67304	67305	Mrs. Brown	367	" Why , you have not a dry stitch upon you ; you are one mask of mud ! Would you please to step in ? "
67372	67378	67336	67337	St. John	369	" For a Good Boy , "
67379	67385	67336	67337	St. John	369	" A Keepsake from Melford , "
67386	67392	67336	67337	St. John	369	" A Present from Manchester , "
67646	67652	67653	67653	she	148	" Does it become me ? "
67662	67670	67653	67653	she	148	" Why do not you say something ? "
67671	67686	67688	67688	he	369	" I have been so unlucky in two or three of my remarks lately , "
67709	67720	67688	67688	he	369	" that I have become chary of making any more . "
67721	67738	67739	67739	she	148	" You need not be afraid of offending me by telling me that it is unbecoming , "
67744	67750	67752	67752	she	148	" quite the contrary . I "
67757	67793	67752	67752	she	148	" think that it suits me too well , as if it were a dress that I ought to have been born to . Upon Miss Blessington now such a costume would look utterly incongruous . "
67800	67822	67794	67795	St. John	369	" A goddess in a bed - gown ! Diana of the Ephesians in a linsey petticoat ! Perish the thought ! "
68148	68156	68157	68157	he	369	" Esther , will you marry me ? "
68273	68278	68280	68281	St. John	164	" You wo n't ? "
68312	68340	68341	68341	he	369	" If you have been making a fool of me all this time , you might , at least , have the civility to tell me so , "
68364	68374	68375	68375	she	148	" Do n't blame me before I deserve it , "
68383	68388	68375	68375	she	148	" I will mar — "
68438	68441	68442	68442	he	369	" Esther , "
68445	68473	68442	68442	he	369	" I half believe that you said ' yes ' out of sheer fright ; you thought I was going to upbraid you ; and I am aware "
68480	68570	68442	68442	he	369	" that there are few things you would not do or leave undone to avoid a scolding ; you did not say it readily , as if you were glad of it . I know that you have only known me three weeks , that I am not particularly likeable , especially by women , and that I always show to the worst possible advantage at home . All I beg of you is , tell me the truth : Do you like me , or do you not ? "
68571	68577	68597	68597	his	1766	" I do like you . "
68578	68586	68587	68587	he	1766	" Like is such a comprehensive word , "
68601	68615	68587	68587	he	1766	" You like Mrs. Brown , I suppose , for washing your clothes ? "
68616	68625	68597	68597	his	1766	" I like you better than Mrs. Brown . "
68626	68633	68634	68634	he	1766	" I did not doubt that , "
68639	68684	68634	68634	he	1766	" probably you like me better than Sir Thomas , than my mother , than Constance , perhaps ; but such liking as that I would not stoop to pick off the ground . I must be first or nowhere . Am I first ? "
68685	68692	68693	68693	she	1766	" No , you are not , "
68706	68711	68712	68712	he	1766	" I am not ! "
68720	68729	68712	68712	he	1766	" Who is then , may I ask ? "
68730	68744	68634	68634	he	1766	" Jack , my brother — he is , and always will be ! "
68745	68748	68750	68750	Gerard	238	" Bah ! "
68759	68791	68750	68750	Gerard	238	" How you frightened me ! I believe you did it on purpose , as you said to me about the brook this afternoon . After him , am I first ? "
68792	68795	68634	68634	he	1766	" Yes . "
68796	68815	68634	68634	he	1766	" Before — what 's his name?—the fellow that writes such a remarkably good hand — before Brandon ? "
68816	68826	68827	68827	she	1767	" Why do you always worry me about him ? "
68835	68847	68849	68850	St. John	164	" Why do you so strongly resent being worried about him ? "
68853	68867	68868	68868	she	1767	" It is wearisome to hear a person always harping on one string , "
68872	68895	68868	68868	she	1767	" Believe me or not , as you choose ; but please spare me the trouble of these repeated and useless asseverations . "
68896	68902	68903	68903	he	1768	" I beg your pardon ! "
68925	68946	68947	68947	he	1768	" I will never dig him up as long as I live . Peace to his ashes ! Oh darling ! "
68960	69116	68950	68950	his	1768	key—"I have been so little used to having things go as I wish , that I can hardly believe it is I that am standing here . Pinch me , that I may be sure that I am awake ! Oh Esther ! is it really true ? Can you possibly be fond of me ? So few people are ! Not a soul in the wide world , I do believe , except my old mother . The girl that I told you about last night lay in my arms , and let me kiss her as you are doing ; she kissed me back again , as you do not do ; I looked into her eyes , and they seemed true as truth itself , and all the while she was lying to me : my very touch must have been hateful to her , as it is to you , perhaps ? "
69117	69128	69130	69130	Esther	148	" You are always referring to that — that person , "
69153	69194	69130	69130	Esther	148	" I perceive that I am only a pis aller after all . If you had ceased to care for her , you would have forgiven her long ago , and have given up measuring everybody else by her standard . "
69195	69204	69205	69205	he	1769	" I have forgiven her fully and freely , "
69218	69249	69250	69250	He	1769	" ..... fairer than the evening air , Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;More lovely than the monarch of the sky , In wanton Arethusa 's azured arms . "
69257	69282	69283	69283	he	1769	" I not only forgive her , but hale down blessings on her own and her plunger 's ugly head . To be candid , "
69288	69334	69283	69283	he	1769	" I forgave her a year ago , when I met her at Brainton Station , grown fat , with a red nose , and a tribe of squinting children , who , but for the finger of Providence interposing , might have been mine . "
69367	69370	69371	69371	she	553	" Come , "
69379	69401	69371	69371	she	553	" let us go home . We shall get into dreadful disgrace as it is ; what will Sir Thomas say ? "
69402	69409	69411	69412	St. John	164	" I can tell you beforehand , "
69416	69514	69411	69412	St. John	164	" he will say , with his usual charming candour , that , if we ask his opinion , we are a couple of fools to go gadding about to strange churches just to see a parcel of lighted candles and squeaking little boys and popish mummeries ; that , for his part , he has stuck to his parish church for the last fifty years , and means to do so to the end of the chapter ; and that , if we do n't choose to conform to the rules of his house , & c. "
69515	69523	69525	69525	Esther	148	" Does he always say the same ? "
69529	69558	69525	69525	Esther	148	" Always . A long and affectionate study of his character has enabled me to predicate with exactness what he will say on any great subject , Esther . "
69559	69570	69571	69571	she	148	" How do you know that my name is Esther ? "
69575	69586	69571	69571	she	148	" You have never heard any one call me so . "
69587	69614	69525	69525	Esther	148	" Do you forget the flyleaf of the Prayer - book that — Hang it ! I was on the point of uttering the forbidden name ! "
69630	69644	69645	69645	he	1771	" I have heard of you as Esther Craven from my youth up , "
69648	69686	69645	69645	he	1771	" Before you came we speculated as to what ' Esther ' Craven would be like ; it was only when you arrived in propriá personá that you rose into the dignity of ' Miss ' Craven . "
69687	69694	69695	69695	she	148	" I hate being called Esther , "
69721	69753	69695	69695	she	148	" it always makes me feel as if I were in disgrace . Jack never calls me Esther unless he is vexed with . me . Call me Essie , please . "
69754	69759	69645	69645	he	1771	" Essie , then . "
69760	69763	69695	69695	she	148	" Well ? "
69764	69772	69695	69695	she	148	" I think it right to warn you "
69806	69863	69695	69695	she	148	embrace?)—"I think it right to warn you that I may very possibly grow like Sir Thomas in time ; they tell me that I have a look of him already . I do not see that myself ; but , even if that does come to pass , can you promise to like me even then ? "
69864	69868	69695	69695	she	148	" Even then . "
69869	69927	69957	69957	he	1774	" I may very probably d — n the servants , and be upset for a whole evening if there are lumps in the melted butter ; I may very probably insist on your playing backgammon with me every evening , and insist , likewise , on your being invariably beaten . Can you bear even that ? "
69928	69932	69933	69933	They	1773	" Even that . "
69987	69996	69997	69997	he	1774	" Why are you in such a hurry ? "
70013	70062	70000	70000	his	1774	" Who knows ? to - morrow we may be dead ; to - day we are as gods , knowing good and evil . This walk has not been to you what it has to me , or you would be in no haste to end it . "
70063	70071	70072	70072	she	148	" I do n't suppose it has , "
70094	70104	70105	70105	he	1774	" There can be but one explanation of that , "
70110	70117	70119	70119	Esther	148	" If you only knew — , "
70133	70144	70145	70145	he	1774	" If you are going to tell me anything disagreeable , "
70156	70215	70145	70145	he	1774	" stop ! Tell me to - morrow , or the day after , but not now — not now ! Let there be one day of my life on which I may look back and say , as God said when he looked back upon His new world , ' Behold , it is very good ! ' "
70220	70251	70216	70216	She	148	" And yet , perhaps , it would be better if I knew the end of your sentence ; if I only knew — what?—how little you care about me ? "
70252	70257	70258	70258	she	148	" You are mistaken , "
70265	70280	70287	70287	she	148	" I love you so well , that I have grown hateful to myself ! "
70416	70428	70430	70430	our	1779	" Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought , "
70535	70557	70558	70558	she	256	" I think that you must have regretted being in such a hurry to run away from the garden and us , "
70583	70607	70609	70609	Esther	148	" Sitting in the shade eating nectarines is certainly pleasanter occupation than grovelling on your hands and knees on a mud - bank , "
70613	70621	70623	70624	Miss Blessington	258	" St. John is so terribly energetic ! "
70629	70649	70623	70624	Miss Blessington	258	" he would have walked me off the face of the earth long ago if I had let him . "
70663	70669	70671	70673	the young man	670	" What about St. John ? "
70701	70711	70713	70714	Sir Thomas	238	" Much better have stuck to your parish church , "
70733	70753	70713	70714	Sir Thomas	238	" than gone scrambling heigh - go - mad over hedges and ditches after new - fangled Puseyite mummeries ! "
70910	70919	70920	70920	she	148	" I can not write it to him ! "
70943	71031	70920	70920	she	148	" anything written sounds so harsh , so abrupt , so hard . I must tell him myself very gradually and gently , and tell him how sorry I am , and beg him to forgive me , and cry — go down on my knees , perhaps . No ; I should look such a fool if I did that ! After all , no one cries long over spilt milk — least of all any one so sensible and utterly unimaginative as poor dear Bob . "
71075	71091	71093	71094	Miss Blessington	258	" Two dissyllabic names now passing many mouths by three dissyllabic names are here expressed , "
71240	71246	71248	71248	Constance	256	" That is the whole , "
71250	71272	71248	71248	Constance	256	" These are the proofs ; a woman , a wise man , a king , a poet , a beauty ! "
71275	71279	71281	71282	Miss Blessington	258	" A woman ! "
71311	71315	71317	71318	Miss Blessington	258	" A woman ! "
71336	71359	71326	71326	Esther	148	" Oh ! I beg your pardon ; I do n't think I was attending . A — what did you say ? "
71360	71364	71366	71367	Miss Blessington	258	" A woman ! "
71376	71380	71366	71367	Miss Blessington	258	" A woman ! "
71386	71409	71382	71382	Esther	148	" that is rather vague , is it not ? There have been a good many women , one way or another . "
71410	71419	71421	71421	Constance	256	" Let us try the next , then , "
71425	71430	71421	71421	Constance	256	" A wise man . "
71431	71434	71436	71436	Esther	148	" Solomon ! "
71440	71447	71449	71449	Constance	256	" I said a dissyllable name , "
71464	71473	71460	71461	St. John	164	" Tell us a wise man 's name ? "
71474	71481	71483	71483	they	1791	" Who was a wise man ? "
71489	71492	71494	71495	St. John	164	" Solomon ! "
71499	71504	71506	71506	Esther	148	" So I said , "
71510	71543	71506	71506	Esther	148	" but , unluckily , it must be a two - syllabled wise man . I 'm afraid that it would be disrespectful to abbreviate him into Solmon , would n't it ? "
71544	71571	71573	71573	Gerard	258	" One ought to be provided with a Bible , a Lemprière , and an encyclopaedia before one attempts to grapple with these devices of Satan , "
71591	71600	71573	71573	Gerard	258	" A woman ! Who is the woman ? "
71601	71609	71506	71506	Esther	148	" We have not found out yet . "
71610	71619	71506	71506	Esther	148	" A king ! Who is the king ? "
71620	71628	71573	71573	Gerard	258	" We have not found out yet . "
71629	71640	71642	71642	he	1792	" You seem to be on the highroad to success , "
71652	71659	71661	71662	Miss Blessington	258	" We have only just begun , "
71668	71678	71661	71662	Miss Blessington	258	" You and Miss Craven are always so impatient . "
71679	71692	71694	71694	Esther	148	" There are a great many two - syllabled kings ' names , "
71706	71719	71694	71694	Esther	148	" Edward , Henry , Louis , Ahab , Alfred , Joash ! "
71720	71731	71733	71733	Constance	256	" I daresay it is one of those Jewish kings , "
71737	71759	71733	71733	Constance	256	" they are always fond of introducing Bible names into acrostics . Is there a Bible anywhere about , St. John ? "
71778	71781	71776	71776	Doré	381	" Elaine , "
71784	71787	71782	71782	Flaxman	383	" Dante ; "
71801	71809	71811	71811	Constance	256	" I will go and fetch one , "
71827	71842	71844	71844	Gerard	258	" May she long be occupied in searching the Scriptures for a dissyllabic king ! "
71860	71868	71870	71870	Esther	148	" I am glad she is gone , "
71876	71886	71870	71870	Esther	148	" as I have something to say to you . "
71887	71891	71844	71844	Gerard	258	" Say on . "
71892	71901	71902	71902	she	148	" I must go home to - morrow , "
71919	71930	71931	71931	he	1793	" Are you beginning to try experiments on me already ? "
71951	71967	71931	71931	he	1793	" No ; but I have received a letter from Jack this morning , which — "
71968	71978	71931	71931	he	1793	" Which you are going to read to me ? "
71979	71986	71987	71987	she	148	" Oh , no — no ! "
72002	72011	71987	71987	she	148	" it — it — wouldn't interest you . "
72023	72034	71987	71987	she	148	" He seems to be missing me a good deal . "
72035	72039	72041	72042	St. John	164	" Be honest , "
72057	72068	72041	72042	St. John	164	" Does he miss you as much as I shall ? "
72069	72080	72081	72081	she	148	" More , a good deal , I should say , "
72091	72118	72120	72120	she	148	" I do n't make your tea , and order your dinner , and darn your socks . One , two , three , four weeks , "
72133	72144	72120	72120	she	148	" I have actually been here nearly a month , and "
72154	72169	72120	72120	she	148	" do you know , the very day I left home I told them — "
72170	72175	72176	72176	She	148	" Who 's them ? "
72180	72199	72176	72176	She	148	" Them — did I say them ? Oh ! I meant him , of course — Jack . "
72200	72219	72120	72120	she	148	" Does he always speak of himself in the plural , like a king , or a reviewer ? "
72220	72223	72225	72225	Esther	148	" Nonsense ! "
72234	72244	72225	72225	Esther	148	" Do you never make slips of the tongue ? "
72245	72256	72120	72120	she	148	" Frequently . Well , you must write and tell them "
72266	72289	72225	72225	Esther	148	" that they must get some one else to darn their socks , for that you have found something better to do . "
72290	72297	72298	72298	she	148	" could not have anything better , "
72305	72320	72298	72298	she	148	" You do n't understand about Jack , or you would not make jokes ! "
72321	72341	72342	72342	he	1796	" It is a fault I 'm not often guilty of ; being funny never was my besetting sin , "
72347	72372	72342	72342	he	1796	" Essie , whenever you do go home , I have a great mind to go with you — if you will invite me . "
72373	72381	72382	72382	she	148	" Oh , no , do n't ! "
72397	72406	72407	72407	he	1796	" I believe you are ashamed of me , "
72432	72439	72440	72440	she	148	" Ashamed of myself more likely , "
72450	72453	72440	72440	she	148	" Why ? "
72454	72462	72440	72440	she	148	" You fine gentlemen do not understand the "
72473	72482	72440	72440	she	148	" she answers , with a forced laugh . "
72512	72513	72514	72514	You	1796	" "
72526	72584	72514	72514	You	1796	" says Gerard , laughing again , and yet looking very tender withal — not with the puling , milk - and - water tenderness of a green love - sick boy , but with the condensed , strong passion of a world - worn , world - tainted , half world - weary - grown man . "
72591	72606	72514	72514	You	1796	" says Essie , drooping her eyelids , over which the small blue veins — "
72614	72633	72514	72514	You	1796	" with a maiden 's shyness , under the new - known fire of a lover 's gaze . "
72638	72639	72640	72640	I	0	" "
72650	72663	72648	72648	Jack	146	" she answers , twisting her one paltry ring round her finger . "
72729	72730	72708	72708	he	146	" "
72738	72766	72708	72708	he	146	" replies St. John , gravely , drawing himself up , and looking rather too conscious of the eight centuries of Norman blood in his strong veins . "
72803	72804	72805	72805	Your	3402	" "
72809	72820	72805	72805	Your	3402	" she repeats , with a dreamy , mournful smile . "
72836	72876	72829	72829	I	0	" she says , a look of melancholy inspiration crossing and darkening , as a travelling cloud crosses and darkens the blue eyes of a June brook , the sweet red and sweeter white of her little piquante face . "
72891	72897	72878	72878	you	0	" he asks , gaily . "
72900	72917	72878	72878	you	0	" she answers , shuddering a little , as she has got into the habit of doing lately—"except
72918	72928	72984	72984	you	3402	" ( throwing herself impulsively into his glad arms ) "
72938	72982	72984	72984	you	3402	" There is a pause — a little brief pause — in which that shyest , fleetest - winged of earth 's visitants — Happiness — folds her pinions and settles down for a little minute on two beating , trembling human hearts . "
72987	73016	72984	72984	you	3402	" continues Essie , after awhile — raising herself , and looking up , with tears glistening , like dew on the autumn grass , upon her long swart lashes—"Do
73062	73063	73017	73017	you	3402	" "
73070	73076	73017	73017	you	3402	" he answers , thoughtfully , "
73095	73111	73119	73120	Mother Hubbard	385	" ( smiling fondly , and stroking her ruffled , scented love - locks ) , "
73124	73125	73119	73120	Mother Hubbard	385	" "
73136	73146	73128	73128	you	0	" she asks , in rather a troubled voice . "
73153	73159	73128	73128	you	0	" he answers , laughing — "
73191	73192	73178	73178	I	0	" "
73201	73208	73195	73196	a mésalliance	1809	" she answers , rather sadly . "
73219	73220	73211	73212	Sir Thomas	238	" "
73229	73238	73239	73239	He	238	" answers Gerard , with a careless shrug . "
73297	73298	73301	73301	he	238	" "
73303	73317	73301	73301	he	238	" asks Esther , quickly , looking up eagereyed , parted - lipped . "
73323	73331	73320	73320	you	0	" said the young man , sharply . "
73343	73354	73333	73333	you	0	" inquires she , playfully , not detecting his suspicion . "
73361	73377	73378	73378	He	238	" he replies , coldly , and his arms slacken their fond hold a little . "
73392	73438	73439	73439	Ahab	378	" The door handle , turning , rattles . With one spring , Esther returns to her seat — to her deserted cows and impossible profiles . St. John looks out of the window . No transformation scene at Drury Lane could be more complete . "
73449	73464	73465	73465	I	0	" recites Miss Blessington , entering , with an open Bible in her hand . "
73488	73531	73468	73468	you	0	" says Miss Blessington next day to Esther , as the two girls stand together in the conservatory , picking bits of heliotrope and maidenhair , and regardless of the ten and twenty little pots that their long gowns have knocked down ; "
73570	73603	73641	73641	They	1815	" She speaks politely , with that friendly suavity that one feels on the ultimate and penultimate days of their stay to a guest that one is glad to be rid of . "
73610	73616	73641	73641	They	1815	" says Essie , lightly ; "
73639	73640	73641	73641	They	1815	" "
73649	73664	73641	73641	They	1815	" St. John had said to her overnight , à propos of this ball , "
73735	73921	73922	73922	We	1817	" Gerard had found his betrothed stubborner than he had expected as to her expressed resolution of departure . Looking at the childish roundness of her soft face , at the dewy meekness of her heavenly eyes , he had fancied her malleable by his hand , as clay by the potter 's ; and so , in most things , she would have been . In most things , it was to her easier to yield than to resist — less trouble — and , besides , it pleased people ; but in the one prime passion of her life , her love for her brother , you might as well try to move the Tower of London with your finger and thumb as to stir her . After half an hour of arguments , persuasions , caresses , St. John is constrained vexedly to own to himself that in that young faithful heart lover - love holds as yet only the second place . The sole concession he could win from her was that of one day , the day of the ball . "
73938	73942	73933	73933	ourselves	1817	" he says , laughing—"only
73961	73962	73967	73967	people	3426	" "
73970	74019	73967	73967	people	3426	" says Sir Thomas , entering the morning - room that evening after dinner , with his hair brushed up into - a stiff cockatoo , and tugging away at a huge pair of white kid gloves , off which he has already succeeded in bursting both buttons , "
74047	74120	73967	73967	people	3426	" From Sir Thomas 's description one would imagine that the Cancan was habitually danced at the balls he frequents . The door opens , and Miss Blessington makes her appearance ; looking , not vain or conscious , but calmly defiant of any one to make a better — a triumph of lace and tulle and flowers , and milk - white flesh , and grand , cold curves and contours . "
74126	74146	73967	73967	people	3426	" cries Essie , clasping her little hands , with the unaffected admiration of one handsome woman for another . "
74165	74166	74162	74163	Lady Gerard	239	" "
74173	74204	74162	74163	Lady Gerard	239	" replies miladi , whose unwieldy bulk not even the cunningest of Parisian couturières has been able to fashion into anything nearer than an approximation to any shape at all ; "
74224	74281	74217	74218	Jane Clarke	240	" Constance has walked to a pier - glass , and is examining with anxiety a bite that a gnat has been savage enough to inflict on her face , a little under the lower lip , and which has been disturbing her wonted composed serenity ever since 3 P.M. , when the catastrophe took place . "
74287	74301	74217	74218	Jane Clarke	240	" she asks , turning with a concerned , serious look to Esther . "
74309	74310	74311	74311	I	0	" "
74326	74332	74313	74313	I	0	" she continues , gravely . "
74348	74349	74313	74313	I	0	" "
74359	74380	74313	74313	I	0	" cries Essie , good - naturedly , running off . When she returns Sir Thomas is saying , fussily : "
74403	74404	74405	74405	He	1823	" "
74432	74471	74428	74428	he	1823	" replies Constance , coldly , but casting a scrutinising glance at Esther ( who is deftly , with a small pair of scissors , cutting out a little circle of sticking - plaister ) as she speaks . "
74476	74478	74428	74428	he	1823	" cries "
74482	74485	74501	74501	miladi	3952	" papa , angrily—"a
74521	74522	74503	74503	He	1823	" "
74529	74557	74558	74559	Good God	1827	" inquires Esther , timidly , raising a pair of guilty pink cheeks , and exhibiting the result of her labours on the point of the scissors . "
74583	74662	74663	74663	He	1823	" These are the last sweet words of Sir Thomas , as he follows wife and ward into the carriage . They are gone , and Essie sits down in the large empty room to await the resurrection of her lover . The sort of shy half - fear which always assails her at his expected approach comes over her more strongly than ever . A distant door bangs faintly somewhere about the house ; then another nearer . "
74667	75056	74663	74663	He	1823	" she says to herself , and the quick blood rushes tingling to her fingers ' ends . It is a hot night , and the tall French windows stand unshuttered and open . Some impulse of timid coquetry urges her to flee from before him : she is ashamed that he should see the plain letters of joy written on her face at his coming : she would fain have yet a few moments of the happiness of expectancy , to whose delights those of reality are but seldom comparable . From the terrace a flight of stone steps leads down , with many a twist , to the mere . In a minute Essie has run lightly down , and is standing by the water 's edge . The dahlias are nodding their round drowsy heads , and the sentinel hollyhocks stand up stiff and pompous with their clustered flower - spikes — rulers and law - givers among the flower - people ; the little ripples are biting with playful tooth the low sedge - banks , and the tall bulrush forest , whence the coot and the waterhen families sailed out into life in the warm spring weather . To and fro rock the heavy , lazy , water - lily leaves , whose bloom - time is past two months ago . Through her garden , the sky , the high moon walks stately , holding her silver lamp , in whose light all things shine deliciously . Essie stands entranced . It seems to her like the intermediate residence of some happy soul , freed from the world 's toil and moil , shrived from sin , emancipated from life , where it should dwell in tempered bliss till that last day when heaven 's brighter glories , stronger raptures , should burst upon and clothe it for aye . She strolls along the narrow gravel path , bathing her hands with childish delight in the moonbeams , and then stoops and picks up two or three little stones that the night 's sweet alchemy has gifted with a bright short glory not their own . So stooping , she hears a man 's quick firm foot running down the garden steps . She raises herself , and goes to meet him with "
75062	75067	74663	74663	He	1823	" on her face . "
75073	75174	74663	74663	He	1823	" she asks , holding up her pebbly treasures for him to look at . Not speaking , he takes the little pink palm , stones and all , into his hand , and looks into her face ; and then , as if yielding to a temptation that he hates , that he would fain resist , and to which , being over - strong , he must yet succumb , he snatches her to his breast , and kisses her fiercely — eyelids , lips , and neck — with a violence he is himself hardly conscious of . "
75177	75193	75196	75196	you	1830	" she cries , surprised , half - shocked , pushing him away from her . "
75203	75213	75199	75199	You	1830	" He recollects himself instantly , and releases her . "
75229	75264	75222	75222	you	1830	" he answers , with a sneer . She looks up at him in blank astonishment . Has he gone mad ? Is it the moonlight that has given him that white wrathy look ? "
75269	75275	75222	75222	you	1830	" she says , quickly . "
75283	75284	75222	75222	you	1830	" "
75293	75303	75222	75222	you	1830	" he replies , with a little bitter laugh . "
75318	75319	75308	75308	I	0	" "
75324	75325	75308	75308	I	0	" "
75338	75339	75342	75345	an acquaintance of mine	1831	" "
75348	75349	75342	75345	an acquaintance of mine	1831	" "
75366	75367	75357	75357	I	0	" "
75372	75380	75357	75357	I	0	" she asks , trying to smile . "
75395	75396	75397	75397	I	0	" "
75408	75489	75406	75406	Brandon	190	" he answers , coldly , while his sorrowful , fierce eyes go through her heart like poisoned arrows . She turns her head aside and groans . A great vague darkness blots out the broad moon , and the stars ' thick cohorts ; the bright water beside her grows black as hell 's sluggish rivers . He had not known how much he had been buoyed up by hope till that mute gesture of hers bid him despair . "
75496	75530	75406	75406	Brandon	190	" he asks in a voice of sharp rage and anguish , catching hold of the white wonder of her arm , on which his fingers , unwittingly cruel , leave crimson prints . "
75535	75564	75406	75406	Brandon	190	" she asks , faintly , trying for yet a little longer to stave off Fate , to push away Nemesis , with her weak woman - fingers . "
75577	75578	75579	75579	I	0	" "
75583	75590	75579	75579	I	0	" she falters under her breath . "
75595	75596	75579	75579	I	0	" "
75603	75604	75599	75599	I	0	" "
75616	75632	75608	75608	you	0	" he asks , while a tone of joyful hope vibrates in his deep voice . "
75639	75655	75635	75635	I	0	" she answers , in a frightened whisper . St. John 's face gathers blackness . "
75663	75688	75656	75656	I	0	" he resumes , in a constrained voice , out of which the man 's strong will keeps the pent passion from bursting forth , "
75717	75718	75698	75698	I	0	" "
75721	75722	75698	75698	I	0	" "
75745	75746	75732	75732	you	0	" "
75749	75750	75732	75732	you	0	" "
75770	75771	75753	75753	you	0	" "
75774	75821	75753	75753	you	0	" The little catechism ended , the last cobweb of doubt torn away , they stand dumb . Esther 's guilty head sinks down on her breast as a flower 's head sinks overladen with rain . Suddenly she looks up and stretches out her arms . "
75826	75832	75753	75753	you	0	" she says , huskily . "
75848	75849	75850	75850	I	0	" "
75859	75895	75850	75850	I	0	" he answers , in a hard , low voice ; while his straight brows draw together into one dark line across his face , and his lips look white and thin under his moustache . "
75902	75910	75897	75897	you	0	" she says , incoherent with excitement . "
75930	75931	75925	75925	I	0	" "
75940	75946	75925	75925	I	0	" says he , contemptuously ; "
75990	76002	76004	76004	you	0	" Having spoken , he makes a slight movement to depart . "
76011	76039	76004	76004	you	0	" she cries , smiting her hands together , and forgetting in her great dismay to reflect whether the remonstrance accorded well with her dignity or not . "
76047	76053	76004	76004	you	0	" he answers , icily . "
76059	76065	76056	76056	you	0	" she cries , passionately . "
76113	76114	76091	76091	You	0	" "
76119	76128	76091	76091	You	0	" he repeats , with a sardonic smile . "
76140	76141	76129	76129	I	0	" "
76147	76153	76144	76144	you	0	" she asks , quickly . "
76169	76174	76176	76176	you	0	" He is silent . "
76179	76195	76197	76197	you	0	" she inquires , slowly , her cheeks paling to the whiteness of snowdrops blowing , "
76221	76244	76260	76260	you	0	" ( looking round at the flowering gardens , at the broad lake , at the stately house shimmering in the moonshine ) "
76249	76256	76260	76260	you	0	" Still he holds his peace . "
76263	76269	76270	76270	I	0	" she repeats , urgently . "
76273	76290	76270	76270	I	0	" he says , looking up , his eyes flashing with a hard , metallic gleam , "
76324	76325	76315	76315	you	0	" "
76334	76342	76329	76329	your	0	" she says , turning away indignantly , "
76360	76410	76411	76411	I	0	" He looks askance at her out of the corners of his eyes . She has hidden her face in her hands , but by the panting breast and heaved white shoulder he sees that she is weeping — that a storm of sobs is shaking her childish frame . "
76422	76433	76411	76411	I	0	" he says , harshly , steeling himself against her . "
76469	76490	76493	76493	me	0	" She flings up her little head proudly , and the dusk splendour of her eyes blazes through great tears . "
76495	76510	76493	76493	me	0	" she says , laying hold of his arm with one small burning hand . "
76607	76625	76603	76603	I	0	" ( her long neck droops , and she blushes painfully as she makes the confession ) , "
76655	76684	76646	76646	you	0	" She stops , choked with maiden shame . Upon his averted face an enduring flush , like a hectic autumn leaf 's , burns red and angry . "
76695	76704	76707	76707	you	0	" she continues , commanding her tears with great difficulty—"as
76729	76735	76721	76721	I	0	" she says , simply . "
76766	76772	76773	76773	one	559	" ( with a sigh ) "
76803	76812	76814	76814	you	0	" He makes no comment upon her confession . "
76818	76841	76843	76843	you	0	" she asks , eagerly , her little fingers tightening their clasp upon his coat - sleeve . Still he is dumb . "
76845	76867	76843	76843	you	0	" she repeats , excitedly , the quick breath passing to and fro pantingly across the threshold of her crimson lips . "
76877	76886	76870	76870	you	0	" he says , with a sarcastic smile . "
76971	76972	76973	76973	You	0	" "
76977	76983	76973	76973	You	0	" she says , eagerly . "
77017	77033	77034	77034	Bob	190	" ( how oddly the little unromantic name comes in among her heroics ! ) — "
77063	77064	77065	77065	I	0	" "
77071	77082	77070	77070	Bob	190	" ( with a little sneering emphasis on the monosyllable ) "
77094	77123	77070	77070	Bob	190	" says St. John , with a bitter pale smile , like a gleam of wrathful sunlight on a day of east wind and clouds and driving sleet . "
77130	77152	77128	77128	you	0	" she answers eagerly , her great eyes flashing angry , like unwonted meteors that blaze fitful in the winter sky , "
77164	77198	77124	77124	I	0	" Over Gerard 's features a spasm , contracting and puckering them , passes ugly and painful ; his hands clench themselves in the mightiness of his effort to govern his smitten soul . "
77204	77219	77256	77256	you	0	" he answers , after a little pause , in a clear cold voice . "
77253	77254	77256	77256	you	0	" "
77271	77285	77286	77286	You	0	" she cries , scornfully , voice trembling and lip quivering with passion . "
77322	77323	77318	77318	You	0	" "
77327	77335	77318	77318	You	0	" he answers , with slow difficulty ; "
77374	77405	77366	77367	My God	1865	" Through the proud calmness of his voice penetrates a tone of bitter , unwilling tenderness . Hearing it , her whole soul is melted into fresh , quick tears . "
77424	77436	77439	77439	yourself	0	" she cries , stretching out eager white arms towards him ; "
77470	77535	77466	77466	you	0	" He looks at her — looks at the innocently - wooing arms , at the tear - stained , dimpled , tremulous face — and feels his resolution wasting away like wax before the fire , as Samson 's wasted away in Delilah 's lap . He turns his eyes away across the cool silvered flood , and hardens his heart against her . "
77541	77552	77466	77466	you	0	" she repeats , in her sweet , vibrating voice . "
77563	77569	77554	77554	I	0	" he answers , harshly ; "
77647	77648	77649	77649	I	0	" "
77657	77663	77649	77649	I	0	" she answers , vehemently . "
77704	77721	77700	77700	he	1868	" Through all his bitter , surging wrath , St. John can hardly forbear a smile . "
77733	77739	77723	77723	you	0	" he says , drily . "
77761	77783	77784	77784	he	1868	" And were you going to play the play out to the end , may I ask , and marry us both "
77814	77827	77829	77829	Essie	180	" Do you think it manly or witty to jeer at me , "
77839	77858	77829	77829	Essie	180	" because I have been fool enough to desert for you a man worth a hundred of you ? "
77881	77901	77902	77902	he	238	" I have already announced my conviction of his superiority , and have advised you to return to him , "
77905	77911	77913	77913	Essie	180	" Do you mean really ? "
77930	77934	77935	77935	he	1868	" I do , "
77942	77951	77952	77952	she	180	" And you have done with me altogether ? "
77985	77992	78002	78002	he	1868	" Serve me right!—Serve me right ! "
78019	78028	78029	78029	he	1868	" If I were to marry you now , "
78034	78055	78029	78029	he	1868	" my life would be one long suspicion : I should love you madly , and should disbelieve in you . "
78078	78086	78087	78087	she	180	" Why should you disbelieve in me ? "
78099	78110	78111	78111	he	1868	" Because a faith once broken can never be mended , "
78114	78158	78159	78159	he	1868	sternly—"it may be patched up , but a patched faith will not do to go through life with ; because a woman who has deceived a man once for one object may deceive him a second time for another . I should never , "
78173	78207	78159	78159	he	1868	" look in your sweet eyes without thinking I read some treachery in them ; I should never press your heart against mine without fearing that it was beating for some one else . "
78226	78238	78239	78239	he	1868	" What madness induced you to tell me so many lies ? "
78248	78286	78239	78239	he	1868	" Were you bent on putting a gulf , that could never be bridged through all eternity , between us ? Did not you know that that is the one sin I could never forget or forgive ? "
78299	78356	78287	78287	She	180	" I was afraid of you . I thought that , if I told you , I should lose you as I have done now , without telling you . I was on the point of speaking two or three times , but you looked so angry that my courage failed , and I dared not . "
78357	78362	78363	78363	he	1868	" Afraid of me ! "
78368	78409	78363	78363	he	1868	" By your own showing , then , you could not have loved me perfectly , for ' perfect love casteth out fear . ' If you are afraid of me , it is indeed time for us to part . "
78410	78423	78424	78424	she	1871	" I see you are bent on misconstruing every word I say , "
78441	78450	78424	78424	she	1871	" and so I 'll hold my tongue . "
78464	78479	78480	78480	he	1868	" I almost wish that Constance had left me in my Fool 's Paradise ! "
78483	78486	78488	78488	Esther	148	" Constance ! "
78492	78500	78488	78488	Esther	148	" Was it she that told you ? "
78501	78505	78506	78506	he	1868	" It was , "
78511	78545	78506	78506	he	1868	" she heard it this morning ; she was annoyed with me for not going to the ball , and chose this ingenious and , I must say , complete mode of revenge . "
78546	78554	78556	78556	Essie	180	" What had I done to her ? "
78588	78589	78569	78569	Heaven	182	" "
78597	78607	78592	78592	I	0	" she says , in a sort of wonder , "
78617	78695	78609	78609	she	180	" Looking at her as she stands with upturned eyes , like some sweet prayerful saint or penitent Magdalen , drawn by a cunning hand that has been resolved three centuries back into elemental dust — dust that has stopped a bunghole perhaps , like Alexander's — Gerard 's resolution breaks a little ; not his resolution of parting from her — that remains firm as ever — but his power of so parting with nonchalant coldness : "
78698	78722	78609	78609	she	180	" he cries , a little roughly , and yet with a half - groan , placing a hand heavily on each of her shoulders—"Child
78768	78769	78783	78783	you	0	" "
78773	78782	78783	78783	you	0	" she answers , with a melancholy smile , "
78816	78823	78800	78800	you	0	" ( with a bitter emphasis ) "
78830	78831	78800	78800	you	0	" "
78836	78844	78832	78832	You	391	" he answers , with quick violence . "
78861	78911	78850	78850	I	0	" Hearing that heavy sentence , her knees tremble beneath her a little ; a momentary dimness comes over her eyes ; voice , breath , and heart seem to suspend their functions . No word of protest , of lamentation , of entreaty , crosses her whitened lips . "
78921	78925	78915	78915	I	0	" he asks , indignantly—"I
78956	78957	78939	78939	I	0	" "
78964	78973	78939	78939	I	0	" she answers , with a low , moaning sigh—"since
78993	78994	79038	79038	you	391	" "
78999	79036	79038	79038	you	391	" he answers , very shortly , and turns away his head sharply , that only the lake and the stars may see the distortion that the passion of that parting is working on his face . "
79045	79074	79038	79038	you	391	" says the tender , tremulous voice , that might unman a hero — might unsaint an anchorite — as she lingers yet a little minute beside him . "
79084	79094	79077	79077	I	0	" he asks , turning round roughly upon her . "
79113	79114	79115	79115	You	0	" "
79118	79136	79115	79115	You	0	" she says , sobbingly , the words coming a little wildly through a tempest of tears . "
79179	79197	79142	79142	you	0	" For all answer he turns away from her , and buries his face in his hands . "
79205	79235	79142	79142	you	0	" she says , calmness growing out of her strong emotion , putting up her two small hands and trying to draw his away from before his hidden face . "
79291	79329	79248	79248	you	0	" Still Gerard remains speechless — not from obstinacy , but because he can not command his voice : and his pride revolts from speaking shakily , quaveringly , like an hysterical woman or paralytic old man . "
79340	79350	79248	79248	you	0	" she says , indignantly , withdrawing her hands , "
79361	79362	79351	79351	you	0	" "
79368	79400	79365	79366	a murderer	1880	" he answers , with fierce vehemence , looking at her once again as she had asked him — looking at her with wrathful , reluctant passion , but not kindly . "
79458	79463	79467	79468	a murderer	1880	" He stops abruptly . "
79476	79489	79490	79491	St. John	164	" she replies , with a smile more tearful than her tears . "
79493	79499	79490	79491	St. John	164	" she says , earnestly , "
79550	79551	79543	79543	Essie	180	" "
79564	79581	79583	79583	you	180	" he inquires , sullenly , with a certain savage pulling and biting of his moustache . "
79615	79616	79626	79626	you	164	" "
79619	79625	79626	79626	you	164	" she answers , calmly ; "
79679	79680	79675	79675	you	164	" "
79694	79700	79675	79675	you	164	" he answers , doggedly . "
79729	79780	79781	79781	I	0	" he says again , abruptly , putting out his hand ; feeling that the strain is too great for him , and that if it last much longer he , being but human , will break under it . Her answering farewell is to fling herself upon his breast . "
79792	79803	79781	79781	I	0	" she says , desperately , in a passionate whisper , "
79875	79976	79985	79987	such a woman	1891	" Her arms cling about his brown throat close as the bindweed clings about the hedges in sultry August ; her white warm breast heaves and pants against his , as the sea heaves and pants against the shore 's tawny sides ; her eyes , impassioned as only dark eyes can be — alluring , despairing — flame into his eyes , and down through his eyes into his heart . Prisoned in those sweet , frail fetters , he feels strength and name and fame ebbing from him , as Merlin 's ebbed under Vivien 's wily charm . "
79989	79993	79985	79987	such a woman	1891	" Passion whispers , "
80026	80040	80041	80041	She	1891	" But Will and Honour push her back with their strong right hands . "
80080	80111	80112	80113	Your darling	1895	" Hearkening to them , he , with a groan as of one that teareth out his right eye , with relentless fingers unfastens her arms from about his neck . "
80115	80121	80112	80112	Your	1891	" he says , contemptuously ; "
80130	80131	80122	80122	you	1895	" "
80137	80148	80132	80132	I	0	" she answers , with a sudden revulsion of feeling ; "
80164	80165	80166	80166	I	0	" "
80170	80192	80166	80166	I	0	" he answers , taking refuge in surly rudeness from the almost overpowering temptation to fall at her feet and say , "
80243	80244	80241	80241	mine	0	" "
80256	80274	80245	80245	I	0	" rejoins Essie , in a voice that tries to be angry , but is only trembling ; "
80289	80321	80333	80333	you	180	" she continues , after a pause , her soft nature making it more difficult for her to part from him in anger than to incur his contempt by again descending to supplication—"and
80400	80401	80402	80402	I	0	" "
80406	80412	80404	80404	her	1899	" he answers , sternly , "
80475	80488	80864	80866	tha — anks	1900	" Seeing that she is abasing herself in vain , she refrains . "
80503	80861	80864	80866	tha — anks	1900	" she answers , with meek despair ; and catching suddenly his hand before he has time to prevent her , she kisses it very humbly and sorrowfully . Then , unforgiven , unrecalled , she passes away . And Gerard , the battle over , the victory won , sits down on a garden - seat , and cries like a child for his pretty lost plaything . AND so that act of the play is finished : all the actors have strutted and fumed and fretted through their little parts , and now the curtain has fallen . When next it rises , the principal actress in this tragic drama is discovered lying full - dressed on her bed ; her pretty face buried — eyes , nose , and mouth — in the tumbled pillow ; her little neat - shod feet hanging over the bedside . She looks as if she had been thrown there , an inert , passive mass , by some spiteful giant . Six miles away , at Lord — 's ball , the fiddles are squeaking , and the pink - and - green Chinese lanterns swinging to and fro among the orange boughs in the slight wind made by the rustling dresses and passing men and women . Sir Thomas , with his hands in their burst white gloves under his coat tails , and his blue - cloth back leaning against a marble mantel - piece , is talking sweetly , in his hard , rasping voice , of scab and foot - rot . Miladi is gone down to supper for the sixth time on the sixth devoted married man 's arm ; she is eating game pie , and drinking sherry and champagne and moselle in turns . Miss Blessington , sweeping about on the arm of a small white gentleman , whose estate is as large as his person is minute , is responding a little superciliously to a presumptuous younger son , who , annihilated by her Greek profile and Juno bust , has invited her to tread a measure with him . "
80878	80986	80868	80868	I	0	" Meanwhile Esther lies stretched upon the counterpane , while a gloomy pageant of all that she has lost passes before her eyes . Greedier than the dog in the fable , she had tried to keep shadow and substance : Gerard 's love , Brandon 's liking . Now , lo ! both have fallen into the water . There are a few circles , a few rising bubbles ; then all is over — gone , sunk to the bottom , to come up again never more . Vanished from her grasp is the great house — are the buhl and marqueterie cabinets — are the "
80991	80994	80995	80995	Susanna	263	" and the "
80998	81041	80997	80998	the Elders"—are	397	Elders"—are the vineries , pineries , peacheries . Did they ever exist ? or were they only a mirage , such as the sky presents to us sometimes — a mirage of ships shocking together , of armed men meeting in fight ? "
81048	81075	81045	81045	your	1902	" said the magic fish to Ilsabil , the fisherman 's wife , when she modestly requested to be made lord of the sun and moon . "
81082	81172	81176	81176	him	1906	" cries Fate to Esther . At any other time the subsiding from the prospect of being rather a great lady into the certainty of being a very small one would have caused considerable annoyance to Esther 's aspiring soul . Now , the things she has lost merge and lose themselves in the person she has lost . But is he lost necessarily , irrecoverably ? Despite the forlorn attitude , the tear - swollen face , trying to suffocate itself in down , Hope is busy whispering , "
81233	81258	81221	81221	they	1907	" As Hope , the deceiver , thus murmurs , there comes to her ear the sound of wheels briskly rolling to the door . "
81274	81373	81221	81221	they	1907	" She does not give herself time to speculate on any other hypothesis , but , springing from the bed , runs to the window , draws aside curtain and blind , and looks out . The hall - door is open ; a vehicle stands before it . The moonlight and the light shed from the hanging - lamp in the portico are fighting together , struggling for possession of a horse and dog - cart , of two footmen 's floured heads , and of a portmanteau and hat - box that they are carrying out . "
81378	81413	81221	81221	they	1907	" she hears the portmanteau go in at the back of the cart . Then a man comes out — a man in hat and overcoat — drawing on dogskin gloves , and saying , "
81437	81649	81427	81427	I	0	" It is St. John , speaking in much his usual voice . He is going away ! going away ! and he can think of his cigar - lights ! Her heart stops pulsing for a second , then sets off galloping at the rate of a hundred and twenty a minute . Going without making any sign ! She leans further out of the window , and rests her white arms , that look whiter than any lilies in the moonlight , on the sill . He is so close beneath her , if the servants were not there , she might call to him ; as it is , he will never know that she has watched his departure . A sudden impulse prompts her to throw up the window higher , to rustle her dress , to cough , in order to attract his attention . At the unexpected noise John and Thomas turn their heads and look up , but their master does not . He gives a slight start , but , instantly recovering himself , walks steadily to the cart and gets in . Then she knows that he knows that she is looking at him — knows that he is resolute to part from her—"taking
81653	81670	81427	81427	I	0	" as Lancelot took none of Elaine . The horse is a little fidgety at starting . "
81682	82105	81427	81427	I	0	" This is the affecting form that St. John 's last words take . She cranes her neck out of the window ; she leans out her lithe body , reckless of the danger of losing her balance and tumbling on the hard gravel drive below , in her eagerness to catch the last glimpse of the lessening , dwindling bulk ; then , forgetting to shut the window , careless of any cold or stock of rheumatism that she might be laying up for herself , she returns to her former position , flings herself again prone on her bed , again buries her face in the pillow ; but this time no beguiling hope sits and whispers pleasant falsities to her . Hope got up upon the dog - cart , and drove away with Gerard . The night wanes ; morning dreams , that they say come true , invade many sleepers ' brains . At Lord — 's ball people are still dancing with the fury produced by champagne and supper ; but Sir Thomas , Miladi , and Miss Blessington , are at home again , and in bed . Constance is not one of those hard dancers who think that one after supper- galop is worth ten ante - cœnal ones . Not for all the entrancing valses Strauss ever composed would she run the risk of damaging the freshness of her toilette , nor the still more serious risk of exchanging the marble coolness of her cheeks for the unsightly flush of heat or the ugly pallor of exhaustion . Dawn is just beginning stealthily to unlatch the eastern gate ; her torch , new - lit , makes but a puny opponent for the night 's one great and myriad lesser lamps . Esther has fallen into an uneasy doze , her damp brow and loosened hair resting on her bare , outflung arm . Suddenly a knock at her door makes her start up in a vague , confused horror . Is it St. John come back ? Is it some one come to murder her ? A thousand impossibilities flash across her bewildered brain . Without waiting for permission , the person who knocked enters ; not St. John , nor a murderer — only a dishevelled housemaid , who has evidently just thrown a gown over her night attire , and endeavoured abortively to gather up the straggling hair out of her sleepy eyes under a muslin cap put on awry . "
82113	82217	82218	82219	Robert Brandon	147	" says she , coming forward , holding in one hand a blue envelope , and in the other a tall , solemn tallow candle , as sleepy as herself . A telegraphic message ! Oh hateful telegraph ! Cruellest of modern inventions ! Oh hastener of evil tidings , that , without you , come all too speedily ! Oh maker of sick hearts and blanched cheeks and arrested pulses ! Esther snatches it , while a sudden , awful cold grasps her heart , and reads by the wavering , feeble light these words , in a scrawly clerk 's hand : "
82233	82355	82228	82228	Jack	146	" With how few pen - strokes can a death - warrant be written ! For a moment she sits bolt upright , void of breath or motion , as a white dead woman , from the house of whose fair body the spirit departed an hour ago ; the telegram grasped in a stiff hand that knows not of it . Then consciousness returns , brought back by a huge , tearing , killing agony ; then even the agony yields to one intense , consuming longing — one all - dominating purpose - the longing to slay time and space ; to be with him now , this instant ; to be beside Jack dying , not Jack dead . "
82362	82375	82376	82376	I	0	" she asks collectedly , but in a rough , deep voice . "
82390	82391	82384	82385	my brother	4340	" "
82403	82434	82397	82397	you	0	" replies the servant , growing broadly awake under the delightful excitement of a calamity having happened to somebody , and of herself being the first recipient of the news . "
82441	82470	82435	82435	I	0	" Esther says , putting her hand up in a bewildered way to her head , and then springing off the bed and walking quickly towards the door . "
82475	82491	82435	82435	I	0	" repeats the woman , the most unfeigned alarm painting itself on her broad face — "
82531	82552	82553	82553	I	0	" Esther turns and clutches her arm , while her great eyes brimful of despair , burn on her face . "
82561	82565	82579	82579	God	435	" she says , hoarsely—"I
82590	82591	82579	82579	God	435	" "
82611	82658	82579	82579	God	435	" answers her companion , moved to compassion by the terrible , haggard misery of the young , round face , that she , in company with her fellow - servants , had often admired in its happy , dewy rosiness at prayers on Sunday evenings ; "
82696	82732	82691	82692	Sir Thomas	238	" The tall , yellow candle flares between them : lights up the tortured beauty of the one woman , the placid stolidity of the other . Esther groans , and smites her hands together . "
82741	82746	82691	82692	Sir Thomas	238	" she asks in impatient agony—"no
82777	82805	82773	82773	I	0	" The housemaid puts down her flat candlestick on the table , and rubs her forehead with her rough fore - finger to aid her thinking powers . "
82822	82833	82773	82773	I	0	" she says , presently , with an uncertain suggestion : "
82849	82850	82842	82842	you	1927	" "
82859	82867	82842	82842	you	1927	" cries Esther , with passionate urgency — "
82880	83186	83189	83192	the under - servants	1923	" So saying , she almost pushes the woman out of the room , and herself follows her . Through long passages and corridors , full of emptiness and darkness — darkness utter and complete , save where through the gallery 's high - stained east window the chilly . chilly dawn comes peeping , with a grey glimmer , about the black frames , never closing eyes , and stiff , prim simpers of the family portraits — down to the lower regions , where the huge kitchen - grate yawns , black as Erebus — up steep back - stairs along other passages . In one of these passages Esther stands , her frame trembling and teeth chattering with cold and nervous excitement , while her companion raps with broad , hard knuckles on a door , and loudly calls on Simpson to awake . But hard workers are hard sleepers , and it is some time before the coachman can be induced to leave the country of slumber . When at length he is aroused , and has come out to them , in all the yawning sulkiness of disturbed sleep , it is a still longer time before he can be induced to admit the possibility of any vehicle whatever being put at Esther 's disposal . with so righteous a fear of his wrath has Sir Thomas succeeded in inspiring his subordinates . It is not without the aid of all her remaining money , with the exception of what is needed for the purchase of her railway ticket — not without the aid of all that is left of poor Jack 's hardly - spared five - pound note — that she is able at length to induce him to consent to the getting ready of the dog - cart "
83197	83376	83189	83192	the under - servants	1923	" Fully three - quarters of an hour more elapse before one of the helpers can be knocked up , can dress himself , can harness the oldest and screwiest horse in the stables , and put him , with many a muttered grumble , into the cart . Wretched Esther follows the man and his lanthorn to the stable - yard , with the vain idea that her presence may hurry his movements . During most of the three - quarters of an hour she walks quickly up and down over the hard , round stones with which the yard is paved , or stands watching , with greedy eyes , every step in the harnessing process ; while her hands clench themselves , as his are clenched who is dead by some very cruel , violent death , and a pain like a red - hot , two - bladed knife keeps running through her heart . Before the horse is well between the shafts , she has climbed into the cart and taken her seat . "
83387	83394	83189	83192	the under - servants	1923	" suggests the groom , respectfully . "
83402	83408	83409	83409	I	0	" cries Esther , feverishly ; "
83436	83704	83707	83707	you	1930	" Dawn is breaking , slowly , coldly , greyly , without any of the rose - coloured splendours that mostly gild the day 's childhood , as the glorious delusions of youth gild our morning , There has not been a positive , actual frost in the night — not frost enough to congeal the wayside pools or to kill the dahlias — but the air has , for all that , a frosty crispness , as of the first breath of coming winter . The trees and hedgerow holly - bushes loom gigantic , formless , treble and quadruple their real size , folded round and round in a mantle of mist ; the meadows are like lakes of mist ; sheets of vapour steaming damply up to the shapeless , colourless , low - stooping heavens . Esther has forgotten to take any wrap : through the poor protection of her thin cotton dress and jacket the mist creeps slowly , searchingly , making her limbs shake and shudder ; but she herself is unconscious of it — she could not have told you afterwards whether she had been warm or cold . At the turnpike gate a sleepy old man comes hobbling out ( men at toll - gates are mostly one - legged ) , in his hand a candle , to which the white morning is beginning to give a very sickly , yellow look : it seems to Esther that he will never have done fumbling in his breeches - pocket for the sixpence of change that eludes his search . "
83718	83747	83748	83750	Sir Tummas allus	1931	" asks Esther , hoarsely , her teeth chattering with cold and misery , as the groom allows his horse to walk up a long , gentle incline . "
83766	83771	83772	83772	you	1933	" replies the man ; "
83794	83795	83772	83772	you	1933	" "
83811	83817	83805	83806	Sir Thomas	238	" pleads Esther , imploringly . "
83857	83858	83839	83839	I	0	" "
83866	83891	83839	83839	I	0	" answers the man , touching his hat , and giving another instance of the influence of filthy lucre by whipping up his horse . "
83900	83927	83864	83864	ma'am	1915	" cries Esther , almost before they had pulled up at the station , to a porter , who stands waiting to receive any arriving passengers . "
83930	83937	83864	83864	ma'am	1915	" replies the man , briefly . "
83945	83946	83864	83864	ma'am	1915	" "
83949	83950	83864	83864	ma'am	1915	" "
83958	83959	83864	83864	ma'am	1915	" "
83980	84024	83864	83864	ma'am	1915	" Unmindful of the presence of the careless , indifferent onlookers , Esther clasps her cold hands together and groans . In a great despair , as in a great bodily agony , we do not much mind who sees or hears us . "
84028	84039	83864	83864	ma'am	1915	" she says , with a heavy , tearless sob — "
84052	84053	84057	84057	Miss	1911	" "
84059	84086	84057	84057	Miss	1911	" asks the porter , in his civil , matter - of - fact voice . The common - place question brings her back to life . "
84091	84227	84057	84057	Miss	1911	" she answers , collecting herself ; and so saying walks into the station , and , taking refuge in the waiting - room , sinks down upon a green Utrecht velvet chair . Owing to the earliness of the hour , other occupant of the room is there none ; neither is there any fire ( a fire always looks in good spirits ; it never has the blues ) . Alongside of the empty fire - place stands a stiff , green Utrecht velvet sofa , and round the bare table more green Utrecht velvet chairs . Opposite to Esther , against the wall , hangs a roll of texts . Involuntarily her haggard eyes lift themselves to them , and light upon this one — which , under the slightly inappropriate title of "
84232	84237	84057	84057	Miss	1911	" heads the list : "
84247	84251	84057	84057	Miss	1911	" She shudders , "
84257	84284	84057	84057	Miss	1911	" turns away her head quickly , and tries to look out of window , but the wire - blind hinders her gaze . Once again , "
84294	84431	84433	84433	your	1940	" standing out clear and black in large type from the white paper , greets her eyes . She can bear it no longer , but rising hastily , runs out , and begins to walk swiftly up and down the platform . Brainton is a large station — a junction of many lines . Engines are snorting and puffing about ; boilers letting off steam , with a noise calculated to break the drum of any ear ; tarpaulin - covered waggons standing shunted on side lines . A train has just come in , and is disgorging its human load ; a man with a hammer is walking along by the side of it , stooping and tapping the wheels ; porters are driving luggage - piled trucks before them , and shouting out , "
84436	84571	84572	84572	I	0	" to any unwary traveller who may cross the relentless path of their Juggernaut : other parties are enduring and answering , with angelic patience and bonhomie , the agitated and incoherent questions of unprotected females in waterproof cloaks and turn - down hats . Everybody and everything is rampantly alive ; even to his handiwork , man seems to have imparted some of his own intense vitality ; to the engines he has given motion and voice — motion and voice ten thousandfold stronger than his own . In her hurried walks , Esther suddenly comes face to face with a fair - haired youth , who , followed by a porter carrying a gun - case , is walking lightly along with his hands in his pockets , whistling for very lightheartedness , "
84578	84643	84860	84860	miss	1911	" Jack 's tune ! What business has he to whistle it ? All fair - haired youths , with nothing very prominent in any of their features , are more or less alike ; and this amount of resemblance the unknown bears to her boy . Long after he has passed her , amid the shrieking of the engines , the shouts of the porters—"Take
84651	84652	84860	84860	miss	1911	" "
84661	84824	84860	84860	miss	1911	Manchester?"—the well - known tune echos faintly back to her ears . An overpowering , blinding , deafening rush of feeling comes over her ; she sits down hastily on a bench that is near at hand , in close proximity to an Irish labourer , with a blue - spotted bundle , and , careless of the contaminating contact , buries her head in her hands , and rocks to and fro in a paroxysm of despair . It is one of those incontrovertible facts that we all know to be true , and that we all feel to be false , that every hour is of the same length ; that in an hour of Elysium there are sixty whole minutes , and that in an hour of Hades there are only sixty . In Esther 's hour of waiting there are , however , seventy - five minutes , as the train is a quarter of an hour late . "
84831	84857	84860	84860	miss	1911	" she asks eagerly of the bearded guard , who , with the politeness inborn in guards , opens the carriage - door for her . "
84862	84867	84870	84870	miss	1911	" he answers , with suavity—"slow
84885	85195	84883	84883	miss	1911	" Off at last , sliding slowly at first past platform , officials , trucks , book - stalls , dowdy women and dusty men ; then the wind comes beating with a strong rush against Esther 's cheeks , blowing back her hair , as they fly through the air at the rate of fifty miles an hour . The transit from Brainton to Berwyn occupies three hours , and during the greater part of that time Miss Craven maintains almost exactly the same attitude ; with her greedy eyes devouring every field and tree and homestead as they run past — each village spire and bridge a finger - post to tell her that she is so much nearer her boy . She does not cry at all , or groan . Even had she wished to do so , conventionality — that makes us laugh when we would fain weep , makes us weep when we would fain laugh — would have forbidden her , for she is not alone in the carriage . Two other travellers share it with her — two extremely cheerful young men , to whom it is a matter of supreme indifference how many hedges and meadows are before , how many behind them . They are not exactly gentlemen : and indeed it is a matter of almost as curious inquiry as what becomes of all the pins that are made and lost , in what part of the train , if it be not in the guard 's van , gentlemen and ladies travel , as assuredly they are but seldom to be met with in first - class carriages . The two youths have made themselves and their hat - boxes , rugs , & c. , luxuriously comfortable , and seem rather disposed to be funny — to "
85199	85628	84883	84883	miss	1911	" as children say , for the benefit of the lovely girl , who looks so disconsolate and dishevelled , who seems so unflatteringly unaware of their presence . They eat sandwiches and drink sherry ; they are provided with a large stock of all the morning papers , and by - and - by the eldest and boldest of them proffers Punch , Fun , and half - a - dozen other dreary comicalities to Esther . She looks at him for a second with her large wistful eyes as she declines the offered civility , and then resumes her watch . Having obtained that one short glance , he ceases from his witticisms , half - conscious of being in the company of a great sorrow — as we involuntarily hush our voices and speak softly in the presence of our great master and owner — Death . Perhaps , cowardly slaves as we are , we fear lest , if we should speak loudly , he might be reminded of our existence — might lay his heavy hand on our shoulders also . Another hour of waiting at Berwyn — another hour before there is any train for the branch line that leads to Glan - yr - Afon — any train , at least , that stops at so insignificant a station . Another hour of tramping in forlorn , impotent impatience up and down the platform , hustled by a hurrying crowd , who know nothing , and care , if possible , less , about her and her grief . Well , if every one in England wept for every one else 's sorrows , the noise of tears and sobbings would drown the whirring of all the mills in Leeds and Manchester — the booming of all the cannon at Shoeburyness . It is half an hour past noon , when , almost before the train has stopped at the little wayside station , Esther springs out . She is the only passenger for Glan - yr - Afon ; and the man who unites in himself the functions of station - master and porter looks at her with a recognising eye . He must know whether Jack is alive or dead . He looks much as usual , but so he would whether Jack were alive or dead . Feeling an overmastering sense of fear of and repugnance from the news he may have to give her , she runs to the little wicket that leads out into the road . "
85636	85830	85634	85634	miss	1911	" cries the man , following her . She had forgotten it ; it takes a minute to extricate it from her glove ; she thinks that he looks as if he were going to speak ; and , in a blind terror of what he might say , turns from him and rushes down the road . Any suspense is better than some certainties . THE mountains stand still and drowsy in the sleepiness of midday . Through the mistiness of the air , the russet glories of the dying bracken blaze on their breasts : the oak - woods still keep their deep dusk green , but the sycamore has felt the kiss of winter , and is growing red and sere beneath it . The sun is reigning , sole despot of the sky , having banished every rebel cloud beyond the horizon 's limits . It is almost always fine weather when we are most miserable . Whatever poets say to the contrary , Nature is not sympathetic : rather is she very insolent to us in her triumphant , durable beauty . She loves to say to us , "
85880	86172	86173	86173	He	1952	" In the meadow below the house , Jack 's sheep are browsing — the Cheviots that he was so proud of : down the stony , steep back - road the cart - horses come jogging , to be watered at the pool at the hill - foot . With shortened breath and straining muscles , Esther runs fleetly past them , not daring to look into the carter 's face . Through the gate , by the stables , and then the familiar little old house comes in sight , with its high - pitched roof and its old - fashioned chimney- pots . White pigeons are walking about on the gravelled sweep , bowing and scraping , and making love , with a formal solemnity worthy of Sir Charles Grandison . The Virginia creeper 's scarlet banners wave from the wall ; the hall - window is open ; on the ledge lies a tabby cat , with one eye open and the other shut ; two cocks are crowing in emulous rivalry in the farmyard . Everything looks peaceful , happy , alive . Gathering a little feeble hope from these signs , Esther collects her small remnant of breath , and runs towards the door . She has nearly reached it , when , stepping hastily out from the porch , one comes to meet her : one , but not the one : he will pass through that porch but once again , and then not of his own accord , but borne heavily on others ' shoulders . Unable to frame any speech , Esther looks up mutely in Brandon 's face ( for it is he ) , and there reads her doom . "
86181	86190	86177	86177	he	1952	" she sees written wetly on either eye . "
86199	86355	86177	86177	he	1952	" says the young man , brokenly , taking hold of both her hands . She sits down heavily on the bench in the porch : what hurry is there now ? After all , it is but a poor shabby remnant of us that Death gets when he makes his final claim upon us ; in most of us the greater , better part has died long before . Of Esther , three - fourths died as she sat on the oak bench in the porch that autumn morning : breath remained , and blood still circulated through veins and arteries , and speech and hearing were left ; but youth , and hope , and heart , died very suddenly and utterly , to come back to life again never any more . She sits staring vacantly at the seat opposite her for several minutes , and then speaks distinctly , almost loudly : "
86356	86361	86416	86417	the girl	682	" How long ago ? "
86362	86366	86368	86368	Brandon	147	" About eight , "
86407	86414	86416	86417	the girl	682	" What was it killed him ? "
86465	86470	86471	86471	he	147	" It was diphtheria , "
86518	86524	86525	86525	she	682	" Did he suffer much ? "
86539	86545	86525	86525	she	682	" Not at the last , "
86593	86602	86589	86589	she	682	" Why was not I sent for before ? "
86612	86630	86631	86631	he	147	" We telegraphed for you yesterday morning , the instant that we found there was any danger , "
86650	86682	86683	86683	she	682	" And it did not reach me till this morning . If I had had it when I ought , I suppose I should have been in time to see him , "
86696	86703	86705	86705	Brandon	190	" He sent you his love , "
86717	86726	86714	86714	his	190	" Dear fellow ! he was quite happy ! "
86727	86731	86732	86732	she	682	" Was he ? "
86741	86748	86732	86732	she	682	" I 'll go to him . "
86761	86767	86768	86768	he	190	" You had better not , "
86779	86782	86784	86784	she	682	" Why ? "
86793	86832	86784	86784	she	682	" are you afraid of my fainting or going into hysterics ? You need not be ; it is only that I am not the least sorry that Jack is dead , and that I want to be . "
86833	86839	86840	86840	he	190	" It is not that , "
86845	86863	86840	86840	he	190	" but — but — you know , dear , that it is a terribly infectious complaint . "
86864	86868	86869	86869	she	682	" Is it ? "
86882	86895	86869	86869	she	682	" I 'm glad ; perhaps God will let me catch it ! "
87180	87196	87177	87177	they	1977	" Do n't come in ! I 'd rather have him to myself , please , "
87205	87214	87197	87197	Esther	148	" Promise not to kiss him , Essie ! "
87226	87234	87215	87215	Brandon	190	" We can not spare you too . "
87363	87371	87315	87315	he	190	drawn—"While through the lattice ivy shadows creep . "
87712	87718	87708	87717	the boy that whistled " I paddle my own canoe	4710	" I paddle my own canoe "
87854	87862	87863	87863	Esther	148	" I have overcome ! I know ! "
88025	88045	88007	88007	her	148	" God God ! God ! give him back to me , or let me go where he is . "
88054	88060	88047	88055	the great Lord that said once , " Lazarus	4713	" Lazarus , come forth ! "
88063	88067	88047	88055	the great Lord that said once , " Lazarus	4713	" Come forth ! "
88074	88084	88085	88085	He	644	" Lie thou still , till I call thee ! "
88182	88192	88147	88147	she	408	" Suddenly Brandon 's beseeching words recur to her : "
88201	88285	88199	88199	Essie	180	" If she kiss him , he may give her the boon of death . Instantly she rises , and stooping over him , lays her tremulous warm lips on his still cheek . The unearthly awful cold of the contact between the dead and the living strikes a chilly shrinking along her veins and limbs ; but not for that shrinking does she desist . Again and again she kisses him , driven on by that strong drear hope , saying moaningly , "
88298	88397	88296	88296	me	0	" Then unbelief comes back . This is not Jack : he is somewhere else . She will find him by - and - by . This is very terrible , this present experience , but she catches herself thinking she will tell Jack all about it when she sees him . To the incredulity succeeds a stupid apathy . She sinks down upon her knees again , with her elbows resting on the counterpane , and fixes her stony eyes upon the dead stripling ; watches him ; looks at him steadfastly , without intermission ; looks at "
88405	88457	88296	88296	me	0	" as the old philosopher very grandly said . She does not know how long she means to stay there ; she does not know how long she has already staid there ; when some one entering , lays his hand upon her shoulder , and says , with kindly gravity , "
88463	88464	88461	88461	dear	951	" "
88471	88481	88461	88461	dear	951	" she answers dully , not moving her eyes . "
88486	88515	88484	88484	darling	2012	" he says , not attempting to reason with her , but speaking in the coaxing tone one would use to a fractious sickly child . She answers neither "
88517	88519	88461	88461	dear	951	" nor "
88522	88581	88461	88461	dear	951	" she neither resists nor consents , and so , half carrying , half leading , he takes her from the room , and they leave poor Jack lying all alone in his shroud , smiling sternly sweet . SO the blinds are drawn down ; a sort of notice that people put in their windows , saying , "
88593	88697	88591	88591	Death	192	" and the few neighbours round drive up and inquire how Miss Craven is , and are informed that she is pretty well . And the servants each do the other 's work ; and there is a general interesting bouleversement in the household , and much chattering and crying and a stream of visitors in the kitchen . And Brandon goes hither and thither , taking upon himself all the drear work of arranging Jack 's final departure from his home among the mountains , and keeping at bay his mothers and sisters , who , armed with bibles , hymnals , and "
88703	88742	88743	88743	His	2014	" are prepared to sally forth in proselytising ardour upon the conquest of Esther 's soul . And Esther herself is , for the time , soulless as the fair marble mask in the quiet room up stairs . "
88768	88838	88750	88750	one	559	" If ary one were to smite her on lip or cheek , neither would she resent it or complain ; she sits in an armchair , in the drawing - room , with her hands folded in her lap , and the servants bring her tea every half - hour ( incessant tea being supposed to be the necessary accompaniment of great grief ) , and request her to "
88842	88901	88902	88903	Mr. Brandon	166	" So she sits in the armchair all day long - trying to be sorry , trying to weep . She has had Sarah in , and has made her tell her all the particulars of her brother 's last hours ; has listened attentively while the woman — the easy tears streaming down her cheeks — relates how "
88933	88952	88926	88926	he	166	" and how he lifted him up in his arms , and laid his head on his shoulder — "
89078	89286	89052	89052	he	2018	" It is very touching , but it does not touch Esther . She rises and walks into the hall , and looks at his greatcoat and his hat , and kisses his gloves , that seem to retain somewhat of the shape of the kind hands that once filled them . She thinks resolutely of how he has been her one friend throughout life ; thinks of the presents he gave her , and of how seldom he went to any town without bringing her some little remembrance back from it ; thinks of that last five - pound note , so hardly spared , and yet so very gladly given ; thinks of how poor he was , how slight , how young . But it is all no good ; it seems to her like some pathetic tale about a stranger that she is telling herself . And the days pass , and she grows weak from inanition , but refuses all food . If she can be unnatural , horrible enough to feel hunger and thirst now Jack is dead , at all events she will not indulge her low nature ; and so she eats not , and her pulse grows feeble , "
89295	89408	89052	89052	he	2018	" So it comes to pass that she falls sick and is carried up to bed , and lies there half in sleep , half in insensibility . And the mornings and the evenings go by , and Jack 's burial - day comes . They had hoped that it would have passed without her knowing , but it was not so . Now that he is leaving his home for this last time , he does not go light - springing down the stairs , as at other times , but with much tramping of strange feet , with purposed muffling of strange voices . How can she fail to hear , "
89418	89789	89790	89790	God	435	" Through all her trance it breaks ; from her little latticed window , with her sick limbs trembling beneath her , and her miserable eyes nailed to the gaoler coffin , in whose strait custody her dead lies prisoned , she sees the drooped pall and the black - scarfed mourners . These mourners are but few , for Jack — though now awfuller than any absolutest monarch — was , in life , poor and of little consequence : the gap made by the extinction of that one young life is but narrow . Standing there , she feels a pang of bitter regret and anguish that there are not more people to be sorry for Jack . And so , being weak , the fountains of her soul are broken up within her , and she falls to weeping mightily ; and , but for that weeping , she would , perchance , have died , some say ; but I think not — for why should grief , being our natural element , kill us any more than water the fish , or air the bird ? THUS the grave yawns for another victim , and having swallowed him , and a million more that same day , returns to its former state of insatiable famished greed . It is a law — natural , wise , and comprehensible by the feeblest understanding — that all created beings , in which there is progressive life , must come forth , ripen , decay , and fall . But why , oh ! why , in too many cases does the decay and fall forerun the ripening ? Why is so many a worm permitted to gnaw out so many a closed bud 's green heart ? Why is the canker death allowed to pasture on so many an unblown life ? Why are so many little toddling children , not yet come into the heritage of reason to which we are all by our human birth entitled , borne from their mother 's emptied arms to their small short graves ? Is it , as Hartley Coleridge very nobly , whether truly or untruly , said — "
89800	89826	89827	89827	Bear	410	" Very wasteful is the mighty mother , knowing that her materials are inexhaustible . And so they lay Jack down in the wormy grave . "
89843	89960	89827	89827	Bear	410	" No one will ever abuse him or say anything ill - natured of him again ; for to speak evil of the helpless , speechless , answerless dead , requires a heart as bad , a nature as cowardly vile , as his must be that foully murders a young child . And the mourners go home , and take off their hatbands and scarves , and give them to their wives to make aprons of . And old Luath lies in the hall , watching still , with ears attentively pricked at any incoming footstep , and hope drooping , as day droops too , begins to howl dismally towards sun - down . And Esther—"You
89981	90170	89827	89827	Bear	410	" So they had said to her weepingly , as people do say to us , when the desire of our eyes has left us ; but even as they spake them , she felt that they were but words , hollow and empty as the greetings in the market - place with which we salute our indifferent acquaintance . Was she so sure that the change had been a happy one ? It was a change from the known to the unknown , from moderate certain evils , and moderate probable good , to infinite possibilities of horror or blessedness . Where lay this heaven , this promised land , where we so confidently lodge our dead ? Was it up above that highest bluest arch that looks in truth pure enough , and solid enough , to be the floor of some sweet elysium ? Ah ! no ! Human knowledge , that like a naughty , prying child , has found out at once so infinitely too much and too little , tells us that that skyey vault is but thin air . She thinks , shuddering—"What
90393	90394	90395	90395	We	2034	" "
90402	90456	90395	90395	We	2034	" says old Mrs. Brandon , nodding her head and her poke bonnet . It is the identical poke bonnet , and not another , in which she once paid her congratulatory visit . The summer sun had browned it a little , but otherwise it is in a state of high efficiency . "
90477	90478	90479	90479	I	0	" "
90483	90537	90479	90479	I	0	" answers Esther , listlessly . To her it seems a matter of indifference whose hand it was that inflicted such an immedicable hurt , seeing that it has been inflicted by some one , and now yawns , a gaping rift in her soul , never to be assuaged by any balsam . "
90540	90566	90479	90479	I	0	" cries Miss Bessy , her long , uncertain nose reddening a little in her righteous zeal , at the slackness of Esther 's faith . "
90588	90589	90590	90590	I	0	" "
90599	90608	90590	90590	I	0	" Esther says , gently , but wearily . "
90621	90629	90590	90590	I	0	" continues Miss Bessy , rather venomously . "
90638	90658	90590	90590	I	0	" ( laying hold of a roll of paper to exemplify the tenacity of her own grasp * ) , "
90672	90673	90590	90590	I	0	" "
90692	90702	90687	90687	you	2036	" says Mrs. Brandon , squeezing Esther 's hand . "
90715	90722	90703	90703	We	2034	" says Bessy , with animation , "
90748	90749	90703	90703	We	2034	" "
90752	90789	90703	90703	We	2034	" answers Esther , meekly , too broken - down to resent even the indignity of being set up on a metaphorical stool of repentance , amid a select circle of Miss Bessy 's Christian friends . "
90800	90805	90703	90703	We	2034	" begins Mrs. Brandon . "
90811	90815	90703	90703	We	2034	" interrupts Bessy . "
90825	90830	90831	90831	I	0	" amends her mother . "
90871	90894	90861	90861	you	2036	" concludes the good old woman , suiting her action to her words , and folding Esther in a black bombazine embrace . "
90900	90935	90896	90896	you	0	" replies the girl , gratefully , her low , sad voice almost smothered by her mamma - in - law 's bonnet strings , amongst which her little disconsolate head is lying perdue . "
90948	90962	90946	90946	mamma	837	" says Bessy , a little reprovingly of her parent 's carnal materialism ; "
90979	91087	90970	90970	You	0	" The race of Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite , is by no means extinct : if not in the male line , at all events in the female , it still survives in the person of many a Miss Bessy Brandon . Brandon has been busy all day with Jack 's lawyer : returning in the afternoon , he finds Esther sitting on the study window - ledge , on which she and Jack used to sit on summer nights , and watch the little feathery , plumy clouds sail along the sky 's sapphire sea ; used to watch "
91097	91129	90970	90970	You	0	" and speculate who lived in them , and what they were made of . Jack has entered into the ranks of the initiated , but she still sits and wonders . "
91138	91167	91136	91136	Essie	180	" says the young man , stooping over her till his yellow beard , curly as a bull 's forehead , almost touches her dark , drooped head . "
91172	91193	91136	91136	Essie	180	" she answers , indifferently ; and so drags herself slowly up , and walks away heavily to get ready . "
91199	91245	91136	91136	Essie	180	" inquires he , as they stand at the farmyard gate . The callow Cochin chickens have grown up , and are stalking about , in all the dignity of long , yellow legs and adolescence , under the frames of the corn - ricks . "
91254	91255	91136	91136	Essie	180	" "
91266	91277	91136	91136	Essie	180	" answers the young girl , with a weary smile ; "
91292	91293	91294	91294	They	2044	" "
91304	91332	91333	91333	I	0	" inquires Bob , quickly ; his confidence in his sisters ' infallibility as to words and actions not being so perfect as in his mamma 's . "
91343	91344	91333	91333	I	0	" "
91350	91356	91333	91333	I	0	" she answers , calmly ; "
91395	91411	91376	91378	Mrs. Barrett Browning	419	" ' Fallen too low for special fear . ' That is exactly my case . "
91412	91429	91431	91431	Brandon	201	" I never know the right sort of thing to say , do n't you know , "
91451	91471	91431	91431	Brandon	201	" But I had hoped that mother might have hit upon something that would have comforted you a little . "
91472	91481	91483	91483	Esther	148	" She meant to , I am sure , "
91487	91540	91483	91483	Esther	148	" She was very kind , and so were the girls , I suppose ; only some of Bessy 's speeches rather reminded me of Eliphaz the Temanite 's , ' Remember , I pray thee , who ever perished , being innocent ? or where were the righteous cut off ? ' "
91541	91556	91558	91560	that young lady	2048	" I wish to heaven that Bessy could be possessed with a dumb devil ! "
91572	91587	91558	91560	that young lady	2048	" No one should ever have my leave to try and cast it out . "
91588	91596	91597	91597	Esther	148	" Let us go to the common , "
91936	91947	91948	91948	Esther	148	" This is our territory ; what brings you here ? "
91951	91960	91962	91962	Brandon	201	" You are cold , I 'm afraid , "
91988	91991	91992	91992	she	2068	" Yes , "
91997	92031	92032	92032	she	2068	" and I 'm glad of it . I should hate to feel warm and comfortable ; I want to be cold , and faint , and miserable always . Do you know , "
92044	92094	92032	92032	she	2068	" yesterday I laughed ? — yes ! I actually laughed ! and it is only a fortnight since — wasn't it horrible of me ? I want the days and the weeks to go by quickly : I want it to be a long time since Jack died ! "
92178	92181	92183	92183	Bob	190	" Esther , "
92204	92249	92183	92183	Bob	190	" it seems as if I had no other occupation nowadays than to say disagreeable things to you , but I can not help it : do you think you can bear to leave Glan - yr - Afon in three weeks or so ? "
92250	92253	92254	92254	she	2074	" Bear ! "
92259	92315	92254	92254	she	2074	" I can bear anything — I have proved that already , I think . Any one that had had any feeling would have died of this ; but I — I sleep and eat as well as ever : I am like the baker who refused Christ the loaf — I can not die ! "
92316	92319	92320	92320	he	190	" Hush ! "
92325	92346	92320	92320	he	190	" do n't want to go before your time , or perhaps the Almighty might take you at your word . "
92361	92375	92357	92357	Brandon	201	" At the end of three weeks you will come to us then ? "
92394	92409	92389	92389	he	190	" At the end of three weeks you will come to us , then ? "
92417	92428	92412	92412	her	2075	" Could not I live in some hovel by myself ? "
92434	92440	92441	92441	he	190	" Impossible ! You see , "
92449	92503	92504	92504	he	190	" he — poor dear fellow ! — laid out a great deal of money on all the latest improvements in farming implements , and things of that kind , and they did not bring him anything back ; they would have done , no doubt , if he had been given time , "
92522	92539	92540	92540	she	2075	" You mean to say that I have no money — that I am a beggar , "
92567	92573	92574	92574	he	190	" I mean to say , "
92579	92601	92574	92574	he	190	" that henceforth you are to be one of us , and that we are very , very glad of it . "
92606	92610	92602	92602	She	2075	" Thank you ; "
92646	92653	92654	92654	he	190	" It is agreed , then ? "
92662	92672	92680	92680	his	190	" Why do n't you answer me , Esther ? "
92713	92716	92717	92717	she	2075	" Because , "
92720	92742	92717	92717	she	2075	" I have one friend in the world now ; and when I have answered you , I shall have none ! "
92743	92749	92684	92684	She	2075	" What do you mean ? "
92750	92780	92717	92717	she	2075	" If I were to come to you , I should come as your supposed future wife , should n't I ? Well , I should be an impostor . "
92799	92839	92840	92840	he	190	" Do you think I meant to bargain with you ? Do you think I meant to make a profit for myself out of your troubles ? What have I ever done to make you think me so mean ? "
92852	92861	92862	92862	she	2077	" Why am I beating about the bush ? "
92868	92902	92862	92862	she	2077	" it must out , sooner or later ! Oh , Bob ! Bob ! if I had it in me to be sorry about anything , I should be sorry about this ! "
92903	92907	92908	92908	he	190	" About what ? "
92914	92935	92936	92936	Her	2077	" Look this way , Esther . Is it — is it what I have been afraid of all along ? "
92946	92952	92953	92953	she	2077	" Yes , it is , "
92988	92993	92995	92995	Bob	190	" Who is it ? "
93010	93015	93016	93016	she	2077	" Do you remember , "
93019	93061	93016	93016	she	2077	" before I went to the Gerards'—how many hundred years ago was that?—your saying one day that you wished they had not got a son , and my laughing at you about it ? Well ! you were right!—it is he ! "
93090	93110	93112	93112	Esther	148	" I do n't think he would have cared much about me , if I had let him alone , "
93171	93182	93184	93188	which one that is valiant	2084	" I am your master ! I have conquered you ! "
93192	93214	93184	93188	which one that is valiant	2084	" You are strong , you are terrible ; but you are not my master . I will keep you under ! "
93215	93232	93233	93233	he	2085	" You will go to him then , of course , instead of coming to us ? "
93282	93364	93365	93365	She	2090	" Go to him ! Hardly ! I should get but an indifferent welcome if I did . You know I never told him a word about you — ladylike and honourable of me , was n't it?—but some one else did him that good office ; and now , if he were to see me falling over the edge of that cliff , he would not put out a finger to save me . That is his sort of love ! "
93370	93378	93365	93365	She	2090	" And I think he is right . "
93499	93509	93485	93485	he	2091	" Were you very fond of him , Esther ? "
93510	93515	93516	93516	she	2090	" I suppose so , "
93527	93572	93516	93516	she	2090	" I must have been , or I should not have said and done the mean things I did . I should not have degraded myself into begging him to take me back again , when I might as well have begged of this rock "
93581	93630	93516	93516	she	2090	" to turn to grass and flowers . He told me that he would never forgive me , either in this world or the next ! I thought it very dreadful at the time , but I do n't much care now whether he forgives me or not . "
93631	93640	93642	93642	Bob	190	" Have you forgotten him so completely already ? "
93657	93661	93662	93662	she	2090	" Forgotten him ! "
93666	93746	93662	93662	she	2090	" No , not that I not that ! I might as well try to forget myself . I remember every line of his face , his voice , and his ways , and every word he said almost ; but if I were to see him standing close to us here , I should not feel the slightest inclination to go to him , or to call him to come to me . I feel all dead everywhere . "
93776	93779	93780	93780	she	148	" Well ! "
93783	93818	93819	93819	she	148	" I am waiting!—waiting for you to call me a murderess and a bad woman , and all the other names that St. John gave me , on much less provocation . Make haste ! "
93828	93863	93819	93819	she	148	" I am in a hurry to hear that I have succeeded in getting rid of my last friend . Quick ! quick!—tell me that you hate me , and have done with it ! "
93864	93868	93869	93869	he	2096	" Hate you ! "
93896	93927	93930	93930	he	2096	" You , poor soul ! Why should I hate you because another man is better and more loveable than I , and because you have eyes to see it ? "
93949	93955	93956	93956	she	2097	" You do n't understand ! "
93961	94022	94023	94023	she	2097	" You do n't take it in . I was engaged to him ; I was going to marry him , and all the time I never once mentioned your name to him , of my own accord ; and when he asked me about you , I said you were only a common acquaintance . You must hate me ! "
94028	94037	94023	94023	she	2097	" do n't pretend that you do n't ! "
94038	94041	94042	94042	he	2098	" Hush ! "
94050	94064	94042	94042	he	2098	" that is nonsense ! I do n't even hate him ; at least "
94084	94149	94150	94150	he	2098	jealousy)—"at least , I try not . It was my own fault . I knew all along that I was poor , and stupid , and awkward , that I had nothing but sheer love to give you , and I hoped against hope that that might win you at last . We all set our affections upon some one thing , I suppose , "
94160	94195	94150	94150	he	2098	" and I daresay it is all the better for us in the end that we do n't often get it : but oh , love ! love ! you might have told me ! "
94289	94292	94293	94293	she	148	" Bob ! "
94318	94335	94293	94293	she	148	" I have been very bad to you , but I will make up for it ! "
94336	94340	94341	94341	he	2098	" Will you ? "
94353	94356	94341	94341	he	2098	" how ? "
94357	94378	94379	94379	she	148	" I 'll marry you , if you 'll have me , and make a very good wife to you , "
94395	94398	94399	94399	he	2098	" Child ! "
94402	94419	94399	94399	he	2098	" you are very generous , but do you think I can not be generous too ? "
94420	94426	94427	94427	she	148	" It is not generosity , "
94432	94439	94427	94427	she	148	" I wish to marry you ! "
94446	94456	94457	94457	he	2098	" You do n't know what you are saying , "
94478	94529	94457	94457	he	2098	" You do n't know what marriage is . You do n't understand that a union so close with a person you do n't love would be infinitely worse than being tied to a dead body ; the one could not last very long , the other might for years . "
94574	94582	94583	94583	she	148	" If I do n't love you , "
94588	94612	94613	94613	she	148	" I love nobody ; I like you better than anyone else in the world ! Did n't Jack die in your arms ? "
94624	94645	94646	94646	she	148	" Was n't his head resting on your shoulder when he went away ? Oh , dear , dear shoulder ! "
94653	94663	94646	94646	she	148	" How can I help loving you for that ? "
94923	94929	94930	94930	he	2105	" You are deceiving yourself , "
94937	95002	94930	94930	he	2105	" You think you like me , because I happened to be the last person that was with the dear fellow that 's gone — because you knew that I was grieved about him too : but think of me as you thought of me when you were at the Gerards ' , and you 'll know how much you love me for myself . "
95003	95006	95007	95007	she	2114	" Love ! "
95010	95014	95007	95007	she	2114	dreamily—"love ! love ! "
95043	95081	95082	95082	He	2115	" I have used up all I ever had of that : perhaps I never had much , but I think you the very best man that ever lived . Is not that enough to go upon ? "
95091	95109	95110	95110	he	2115	" Worse and worse ! that would be a difficult character to live up to . No ! "
95132	95180	95110	95110	he	2115	" I will never marry you , Essie ! never!—I swear it ! If you were to go down on your knees to me , I would not : I should deserve that God should strike me dead if I could be guilty of such unmanly selfishness ! "
95181	95187	95188	95188	she	2114	" You refuse me then ? "
95200	95225	95188	95188	she	2114	" Was ever such a thing heard of ? And I have not even the satisfaction of being able to be angry with you . "
95226	95231	95232	95232	he	2115	" I refuse you ! "
95245	95286	95232	95232	he	2115	" But — look at me , dear , and believe me — as I said to you before , so I say now , I shall love you to - day , and to - morrow , and always ! "
95386	95394	95383	95383	Brandon	190	" Promise me one thing , Essie ! "
95395	95399	95383	95383	Brandon	190	" Anything almost . "
95400	95421	95383	95383	Brandon	190	" That this — this — talk we have had shall make no difference as to your coming to us ! "
95422	95425	95426	95426	she	2114	" What ! "
95445	95497	95383	95383	Brandon	190	" After having done you the worst injury a woman can do a man , am I to be indebted to you for daily bread — for food , and clothes , and firing ? How much lower do you wish me to fall ? Have you no pity on me ? "
95498	95505	95506	95506	he	190	" You are misstating the case , "
95539	95564	95525	95525	he	190	" you will be indebted to me for nothing ; I shall not even be there ; I shall have gone back to Bermuda . "
95565	95568	95569	95569	she	2121	" Gone ! "
95574	95592	95593	95593	she	2121	" Are you going too ? Is everybody going away from me ? And do you think , "
95598	95663	95593	95593	she	2121	" that it will be easier for me to lie under such an obligation to your mother and sisters than to you ? Is not it always harder to say ' Thank you ! ' to a woman than to a man ? And would not I immeasurably rather sell matches , or hot potatoes at the street - corners , than do either ? "
95673	95677	95678	95678	he	2122	" My darling ! "
95693	95720	95678	95678	he	2122	" you are a great deal too pretty to sell hot potatoes , or matches either ; bread - winners should not have faces like yours ! "
95721	95727	95728	95728	she	2121	" That is bad reasoning , "
95735	95755	95756	95756	she	2121	" if I am pretty , people will be more likely to buy my wares . Oh , Heavens ! "
95771	95850	95756	95756	she	2121	" what business have people to bring children into the world only to starve , or to sponge upon others ? There ought to be an Act of Parliament against it ! Oh , why — why is not one allowed to have a look into life before one is born — to have one 's choice whether one will come into it at all or no ? But , if one had , who would come?—who would ? "
95851	95855	95857	95857	Bob	190	" I would , "
95861	95906	95907	95907	he	190	" I do n't think the world is half a bad place , though it is the fashion to abuse it now - a - days , and though it does do one some curiously dirty turns now and then . But after all , "
95913	95938	95907	95907	he	190	" bad or good no one can accuse it of lasting long , and there 's a better at the other end of it . "
95939	95944	95946	95946	Esther	148	" Or a worse , "
95950	95966	95967	95967	she	148	" Who knows ? One can not fancy the world without one , can one ? "
95976	96006	95967	95967	she	148	" One knows that , not long ago , there was , and not long hence there will be , no I ; but one can not realize it ! "
96007	96017	96019	96019	Bob	190	" Why should one bother one 's head trying ? "
96024	96035	96036	96036	she	148	" The leaves seem to come out in the spring , "
96044	96076	96036	96036	she	148	" the winds to blow , and the birds to sing , all with some reference to oneself : one can not understand their all going on when oneself has stopped ! "
96143	96160	96132	96132	Brandon	190	" Have you any friends that you have known longer than you have us , Essie ? "
96161	96164	96132	96132	Brandon	190	" None . "
96165	96187	96132	96132	Brandon	190	" Any to whom it would be less irksome to you to lie under an obligation , as you call it ? "
96188	96191	96132	96132	Brandon	190	" None . "
96192	96202	96132	96132	Brandon	190	" Any that you like better , in short ? "
96203	96206	96207	96207	she	148	" None , "
96228	96245	96246	96246	He	190	" Good or bad , I have no friends , none , and you know it . "
96257	96270	96271	96271	he	190	" Good God ! what is to become of you , then ? "
96276	96282	96271	96271	he	190	" I do n't know . "
96283	96290	96246	96246	He	190	" How are you to live ? "
96291	96297	96246	96246	He	190	" I do n't know . "
96298	96307	96271	96271	he	190	" Have you never once thought about it ? "
96308	96316	96317	96317	she	148	" Never . I thought that we , "
96352	96354	96271	96271	he	190	" we "
96356	96375	96317	96317	she	148	sleeping—"I thought that we should have lived to be old together : most people live to be old ! "
96444	96448	96455	96455	he	190	" her boy . "
96449	96454	96455	96455	he	190	" Poor little soul ! "
96751	96758	96759	96759	he	190	" Come to us , Essie ! "
96766	96799	96759	96759	he	190	" we 'll be good to you ; we wo n't plague you ; you would have come to us as my wife , why wo n't you come as my sister ? "
96800	96812	96813	96813	she	148	" Because I like buying things better than being given them ! "
96825	96880	96813	96813	she	148	" If I had come as your wife , I should . have given you something in exchange,—myself , body and soul , my whole life . It would have been of no value really , but you would have thought it something ; as your sister , I shall give you absolutely nothing ! "
96881	96892	96893	96893	he	2138	" Child ! child ! why are you so proud ? "
96900	96941	96813	96813	she	148	" Why are you so bent on standing alone ? Which of us can stand alone in this world ? We all have to lean upon one another , more or less , and the strongest of us upon God ! "
96942	96951	96952	96952	she	2139	" Yes , I know that!—I know that ! "
96957	97050	96952	96952	she	2139	" but I would far rather beg , and have to be obliged to any common stranger that I had never seen before , and that most probably I should never see again , than to you . With them I should , at all events , start fair : I should have no old debts to weigh me down ; but to you I owe so much already , that I am racking my brain to think how I can pay some part of it , instead of contracting new ones . "
97051	97059	97060	97060	he	2140	" You would contract no new ones , "
97065	97109	97060	97060	he	2140	" on the contrary . Essie , you told me just now that you would be very glad to be able to make up to me for any pain you may have made me suffer : now is your time!—now is your opportunity ! "
97110	97113	97114	97114	she	2141	" How ? "
97131	97154	97119	97119	her	2141	" You will be at the other side of the world , thousands of miles away ! How will it affect you ? "
97155	97167	97168	97168	he	2140	" I shall be at the other side of the world , "
97173	97228	97168	97168	he	2140	" better that I should be so ! better so ! But do you think that my being so far away will make it pleasanter for me to think of the one creature I love above all others on the face of the earth , starving , or worse than starving , at home ? "
97229	97234	97235	97235	she	2141	" Worse than starving ! "
97247	97262	97239	97239	her	2141	" What can be worse than starving ? Oh ! I see what you mean "
97281	97324	97325	97325	she	2141	" You think I should go to the bad — do something disgraceful , if I had nobody to look after me : I am sorry you have such a bad opinion of me , but I do n't wonder at it , "
97332	97341	97342	97342	he	2142	" I have no bad opinion of you ! "
97347	97395	97342	97342	he	2142	" but I know the end that women , originally as pure and good as you , have come to before now . I know how hard it is for a beautiful poor girl to live honestly in this world , how frightfully easy to live dishonestly ! "
97396	97399	97400	97400	she	2141	" Well ! "
97405	97432	97400	97400	she	2141	" and if I did live dishonestly , what matter ? Whom have I got to be ashamed of ? Whom have I got to disgrace ? "
97438	97441	97442	97442	he	2142	" Hush ! "
97452	97491	97442	97442	he	2142	" you do n't know what you are saying ! For Heaven 's sake , talk in that strain to no one but me ! Any one that knew you less well than I do might misunderstand you . "
97502	97512	97513	97513	she	2141	" One does say dreadful things without intending it , "
97518	97541	97513	97513	she	2141	" but I only meant to express , as forcibly as possible , how little consequence it was what happened to me . "
97542	97553	97554	97554	he	2142	" For God 's sake , word it differently then ! "
97560	97626	97554	97554	he	2142	" or , better still , do n't say it or think it at all ! It is morbid , and it is not true . If it is of no consequence to any one else what becomes of you , it is of intense , unspeakable consequence to me : how many times must I tell you that before you mean to believe it ? "
97627	97634	97635	97635	she	2141	" To you ! in Bermuda ? "
97644	97653	97654	97654	he	2142	" Yes , to me , in Bermuda , "
97659	97721	97654	97654	he	2142	" Perhaps you think that it was only because I looked upon you as my own , my property , that I took so great an interest in you : it was not as mine , it was as yourself , that I cared about you . You are yourself still , though you are not nor ever will be mine . "
97728	97734	97654	97654	he	2142	" his voice brake suddenly . "
97735	97772	97847	97847	she	2143	" Then , as a stream , that spouting from a cliffFails in mid - air , but gathering at the base , Remakes itself and flashes down the vale , Went on in passionate utterance . "
97773	97825	97826	97826	She	2143	" Essie ! they say that women are more capable of self - sacrifice than men . Prove it to me now ! Sacrifice this pride of yours ; consent to the one thing that would make me leave England with almost a light , instead of such a heavy heart ! "
97856	97924	97847	97847	she	2143	" I can not , Bob — I can not ! Ask me anything , not quite so hard , and I 'll do it ! Just think how young I am , seventeen last birthday , I have probably forty or fifty more years to live ; do you wish me to promise to be a pensioner for half a century on your mother 's charity ? "
97930	97945	97946	97946	she	2143	" Do n't be angry with me for having a little self - respect ! "
97955	98019	97946	97946	she	2143	" I will go and stay with your people till I have found something to do , if they will have me . I will get your mother to help me in looking for work ; I will take her advice in everything , do whatever she tells me ; I will do anything — anything in life to please you , except — "
98020	98028	98029	98029	he	2144	" Except the one thing I wish , "
98036	98051	98052	98052	she	2145	" If you speak in that tone I shall have to promise you anything , "
98057	98080	98081	98081	she	2145	" but it will only be perjury , for I shall infallibly break my promise again . Why should not I work ? "
98094	98124	98125	98125	she	2145	" Am I a cripple , or an idiot ? Let me wait till I am either the one or the other , before I come upon the parish ! "
98135	98149	98125	98125	she	2145	" at all events , let us call things by their right names . "
98150	98155	98156	98156	he	2144	" As you will , "
98162	98207	98156	98156	he	2144	" If you take it as a great indignity to be offered a home with the oldest friends you have in the world , of course I can say no more ; but oh , child ! you are wrong — you are wrong ! "
98919	98922	98924	98924	Bob	190	" Mother , "
98942	98946	98948	98948	he	190	" Thou Fool ! "
98972	98990	99156	99158	the young man	670	Berwyn)—"Mother , do you know I do n't think I shall try for extension , after all ? "

99019	99029	99030	99030	he	190	" Because I do n't see why I should , "
99035	99087	99030	99030	he	190	" I 'm perfectly well : why should I shirk work any more than any other fellow ? I might say that I prefer a cool climate to a hot vapour - bath , English winds to oily calms , but I do n't suppose that I am singular in that ! "
99088	99093	99095	99097	the old woman	3507	" My dear boy ! "
99110	99142	99030	99030	he	190	him,—"why did you ever go into that dreadful profession ? Why did not you enter the ministry , like your dear father , as I so much wished you to do ? "
99143	99154	99156	99158	the young man	670	" I 'm very glad I did n't , mother ! "
99162	99206	99156	99158	the young man	670	" I should have been a fish sadly out of water , and , after all , I hope that Heaven will not be quite so full of black coats that there will not be room for one or two of our colour . "
99207	99213	99215	99217	his eldest sister	2173	" Have you told Essie ? "
99224	99230	99215	99217	his eldest sister	2173	" Yes , she knows . "
99231	99245	99156	99158	the young man	670	" Will she be ready to go with you on such short notice ? "
99246	99249	99156	99158	the young man	670	" No . "
99250	99259	99215	99217	his eldest sister	2173	" You 'll leave her behind , then ? "
99260	99263	99156	99158	the young man	670	" Yes . "
99264	99277	99156	99158	the young man	670	" I thought you always had such a horror of long engagements ? "
99278	99286	99290	99290	his	670	" So I have , but — but "
99295	99299	99290	99290	his	670	" Thou Fool ! "

99325	99328	99156	99158	the young man	670	" What ! "
99336	99346	99156	99158	the young man	670	" No engagement ! Has she thrown you over ? "
99347	99350	99156	99158	the young man	670	" No . "
99351	99358	99156	99158	the young man	670	" Have you thrown her over ? "
99369	99372	99156	99158	the young man	670	" No . "
99373	99380	99156	99158	the young man	670	" Have you quarrelled , then ? "
99381	99388	99390	99390	Bob	190	" No , we have n't , "
99394	99439	99390	99390	Bob	190	" Poor little child ! one would hardly choose such a time as this to quarrel with her . Can not you understand two people coming to the conclusion that they are better apart ; better as friends than as — as anything else ? "
99460	99503	99456	99456	her	2176	" I 'm afraid I see how it is , Bob ; you have found out that this unfortunate girl is , in some way , unworthy of you , and you are too generous to confess it , even to us . "
99507	99511	99517	99517	his	190	" Thou Fool ! "
99525	99558	99517	99517	his	190	" Mother , do you call that the ' charity that thinketh no evil ? ' I tell you , Essie is willing to marry me to - morrow , but I — "
99559	99566	99568	99570	the domestic pack	2177	" But you are not willing ! "
99578	99597	99568	99570	the domestic pack	2177	" Tell us something a little more probable , Bob , and we 'll try and believe it , "
99607	99624	99626	99628	the young man	670	" It is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether you believe me or not , "
99649	99697	99644	99645	Miss Bessy	202	" I only tell you , upon my honour , that Essie is willing to marry me , and that I — solely for her own sake , solely because I know that an inferior being can not make a superior one happy — am not willing . "
99698	99706	99708	99708	Bessy	202	" And a very good thing too , "
99712	99758	99708	99708	Bessy	202	" I always thought you were singularly ill - suited to one another ; I always said so to mamma and Jane . Did n't I , mamma?—didn't I , Jane ? ' Can two walk together except they be agreed ? ' you know . "

99842	99864	99866	99866	Bessy	202	" Of course , what most nearly concerns our only brother can not be supposed to have any interest for us , "
99947	99958	99959	99959	she	3479	" This is a severe trial , my dear boy , "
99966	99994	99959	99959	she	3479	" but take an old woman 's word for it ; look for comfort in the right direction , and you 'll surely , surely find it ! "
99995	100002	100004	100004	Bob	190	" I do n't want comfort , "
100027	100033	100008	100008	he	190	" I do very well . "
100034	100047	100049	100050	his parent	2176	" I thought you had come to your old mother for consolation , "
100076	100101	100066	100066	Paraclete	425	" if not , what was it that you wanted to talk to me about that you did not wish your sisters to hear ? "
100102	100106	100107	100107	he	190	" About her ! "
100123	100144	100145	100145	he	190	" I did n't wish her to be the mark for any more of Bessy 's sneers . I wonder , "
100152	100176	100145	100145	he	190	" that she who is always talking about ' our Great Exemplar ' does not recollect that He never sneered at any one . "
100177	100195	100197	100198	Mrs. Brandon	201	" Did you say that it was Esther Craven that you wished to speak to me about ? "
100203	100206	100207	100207	he	190	" Mother , "
100212	100229	100207	100207	he	190	" she has not a farthing in the world ! What is to become of her ? "
100230	100263	100265	100267	the old lady	3509	" Any one that my dear son takes an interest in will always be welcome to a home with me , for as long as they like to avail themselves of it , "
100276	100282	100283	100283	he	190	" She would not come , "
100288	100313	100283	100283	he	190	" she is too proud : she hates to be beholden to any one ; she is bent on working for her own living . "
100314	100323	100330	100330	her	3479	" And a very proper resolution , too , "
100352	100365	100330	100330	her	3479	" Providence is always more willing to help those that help themselves . "
100366	100373	100375	100375	Esther	148	" How can she help herself ? "
100381	100400	100375	100375	Esther	148	" What sort of work are those little weak hands , that little inexperienced head , fitted for ? "
100401	100423	100425	100426	Mrs. Brandon	201	" Women with hands as weak and heads as inexperienced have toiled for their daily bread before now , I suppose , "
100484	100557	100472	100472	his	190	" Mother ! I 'm sorry I ever broached this subject to you ; one takes a long time , I see , to get acquainted with one 's nearest relatives ' characters . If you can see the child of one of your oldest friends working her poor little fingers to the bone for the bare necessaries of life without stretching out a finger to help her , I can not ! "
100568	100591	100593	100596	the rude old saw	2194	" A spaniel , a woman , and a walnut tree , The more you beat 'em , the better they be . "
100634	100670	100626	100626	her	3507	" My boy ! come back ! let us talk rationally : do n't quarrel with your old mother about a person that will never be so good a friend to you as she is . "
100688	100709	100626	100626	her	3507	" Shall I tell you , Bob , why I can not feel common compassion for — for this girl ? "
100710	100713	100719	100721	the old lady	3509	" Why ? "
100714	100717	100719	100721	the old lady	3509	" Because , "
100744	100760	100719	100721	the old lady	3509	" because some instinct tells me that she has not had common compassion upon you . "
100761	100780	100782	100782	Bob	190	" ' An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth ; ' in fact , "
100791	100848	100849	100849	She	3509	" you are forgetting , mother , how often you have impressed upon me that we are no longer under the Mosaic dispensation ! But why should she have compassion on me , may I ask ? In what way do I stand in need for it ? I 'm not a woman , thank God ! "
100863	100897	100849	100849	She	3509	" Bob , can you look me in the face and tell me that you have not been unhappier since you knew Esther Craven than ever you were before in all your life ? "
100898	100902	100903	100903	he	190	" I have , "
100908	100919	100903	100903	he	190	" and happier too ; so that makes it square . "
100934	100972	100925	100925	she	3509	" Can you look me in the face , and tell me that since your engagement she has behaved to you as a modest , honourable woman should behave to the man she has promised to marry ? "
100974	101000	100925	100925	she	3509	" He casts his eyes down troubled , and begins to fidget with a dilapidated little Chelsea Cupid on the mantelshelf , too truthful to say "
101003	101008	100925	100925	she	3509	" too generous to say "
101011	101012	101013	101013	She	3509	" "
101021	101027	101013	101013	She	3509	" he answers , evasively . "
101059	101060	101028	101028	She	3509	" "
101077	101098	101028	101028	She	3509	" says his mother , in a tone of slighting pity . Bob perceives , and is stung by it . "
101106	101112	101028	101028	She	3509	" he answers , indignantly . "
101129	101130	101116	101116	she	3509	" "
101143	101144	101145	101145	She	3509	" "
101161	101191	101149	101149	she	3509	" he answers , with the reluctance of one who is making a statement that he believes will not be credited by the auditor to whom it is addressed . "
101202	101215	101200	101200	her	3509	" ( with a sort of compassionate scorn ) . He hesitates . "
101228	101234	101222	101222	she	3509	" he replies , doubtfully . "
101256	101282	101222	101222	she	3509	" she inquires , a little sharply . No answer , except quickened breathing , and a frown slightly contracting his climate - bronzed forehead . "
101326	101327	101311	101311	you	0	" "
101334	101348	101311	101311	you	0	" answers the young man , quickly , with scarcely repressed impatience in his tone—"nothing
101420	101421	101422	101427	A higher authority than I am	2213	" "
101438	101451	101422	101427	A higher authority than I am	2213	" says the old woman , sententiously , pursing up her mouth ; "
101499	101518	101487	101487	you	826	" He looks down , for an instant or two , biting his lips , then speaks petulantly : "
101563	101564	101525	101525	mother?—why	2215	" "
101570	101586	101525	101525	mother?—why	2215	" answers his mother , rather nettled at what she considers a want of confidence ; "
101617	101618	101609	101609	I	0	" "
101625	101633	101619	101619	I	0	" interrupts the young man , eagerly . "

101649	101650	101619	101619	I	0	" "
101659	101666	101619	101619	I	0	" he says , with warmth , "
101696	101697	101683	101683	she	2219	" "
101718	101726	101727	101727	I	0	" rejoins his mother , rather tartly . "
101732	101738	101727	101727	I	0	" says Bob , quietly . "
101798	101799	101793	101796	a woman - friend	2227	" "
101802	101813	101818	101818	you	0	" replies his mother , drawing herself up and looking very stiff—"If
101859	101909	101910	101910	Mother	162	" Brandon looks at her for a moment with something akin to indignant scorn in his face , dutiful son as he usually is ; then , repenting , throws himself on his knees beside her , and clasping his arms about her withered neck , says , entreatingly : "
101978	101984	101940	101940	her	553	" he continues , musingly , "
102006	102030	102061	102061	Bob	190	" He had never spoken truer words in all his life , but the truth is not always the best to be spoken . "
102035	102057	102061	102061	Bob	190	" says the old lady , with emphasis , freeing herself from his arms , and getting rather red in the face face—"At
102105	102106	102107	102107	I	0	" "
102120	102143	102111	102113	any honest man	2236	" retorts Bob , sarcastically , quitting his caressing posture , with a revulsion of feeling as sudden as it was complete . "
102149	102175	102144	102145	The servants	4284	" says the youngest , best , modestest , piousest of the girls , opening the door , and putting in her little drab face . "
102202	102203	102195	102195	Bob	190	" "
102206	102235	102236	102236	You	2239	" replies Bob , emphatically . He is standing leaning against the chimneypiece , his colour heightened , and a sorely angered look on his open simple face . "
102245	102271	102243	102243	mother	826	" he continues , seeing his parent look inquiringly towards him , as she moves with the slowness of age and portliness to the door ; "
102306	102440	102302	102302	I	0	" THE rough winds and the spiteful rains have wellnigh stripped all their red - and - yellow clothing off the trees : upon the oaks alone some leaves still hang persistent , though withered and crackly . The apples and pears are all gathered and stored for the winter ; even the dark - blue Orleans plums , that require the crisping frost to ripen them , are eaten and gone . The sale at Glan - yr - Afon is over ; it is enrolled among that countless array of unrecallable events , great and little , that is past . The new tenant , an ordinary Welsh farmer , with an overfull quiver of sprouting Welshmen and Welshwomen , has entered into possession . No one has taken the trouble to "
102443	102558	102302	102302	I	0	" the garden for the winter ; flowers do not help to pay the rent — they give back nothing but their beauty and perfume ; and so , over Esther 's trim flower - beds , sheep - dogs gallop , and children , boisterous with health and spirits , run races . The rustic seat under the old cherry- tree — the seat that Jack fashioned in the summer evenings — has been broken up for firewood ; and in Jack 's chair in the dining - room , the father of the family reposes his plethoric bulk of an evening , when he does not happen to be getting drunk at the "
102562	102755	102302	102302	I	0	" and snores euphoniously . And Bob , pursued by blessings , prayers , lamentations , and strong wishes for his safe back - coming , is gone — gone away in a smoky steamer , over the mist - mantled grey sea . Not a few of the tears that fell for him came from Esther 's eyes — not love - tears , shed privily , secretly , dashed away with hasty care at the sound of any approaching footsteps , but poured out openly , publicly , in the presence of his mother and sisters — mingled with theirs , indeed , as of no different quality . Not more openly , not more publicly , had she wept for old Luath , when , on the day before the sale , the old dog , who had ailed and moped ever since his master 's ( to him ) unaccountable disappearance , crawled weakly to her feet , and , looking up dimly wistful into her face for the last time , died licking her tender hand . On the day before his departure , Brandon came to say "
102759	102763	102764	102764	I	0	" to her . "
102770	102785	102767	102767	mother	826	" he says , with some embarrassment , in allusion to their late engagement — "
102848	102849	102850	102850	I	0	" "
102853	102862	102863	102863	I	0	" she answers , with a faint smile . "
102931	103086	102888	102888	she	826	" Then , bidding God bless her , he wrings her hand , strongly , and so takes his last farewell of her , nor ever sees her fair face and great gentle stag eyes again . And now he is gone — gone with a difficult smile on his face , and very little money in his pocket . He never has much , but he has less than usual now ; having spent his few last sovereigns on the erecting a plain white cross at the head of Jack 's low grave , that , when this generation has passed , his place of sleeping may not be quite undistinguished from that of his neighbour dust . He has gone , with his heart 's strongest longing balked , his prime hope death - smitten ; but yet not despairing — not cursing his day , nor arraigning High God , saying , "
103096	103575	102888	102888	she	826	" He carries away with him no heavy seething load of revenge , no man - slaying ardour of hatred against the woman that has wronged him , and the man for whose sake she did it . Life is full , interesting , complex — not all on one string , whatever morbid women and moody rhymers may say ; not all sexual love — all of it , that is , that is not devoted to drinking , as Anacreon , Catullus , and Moore have dulcetly told us . And therefore , though poor , disappointed , and heart - wrung , Brandon is not all unhappy . He has been greatly sinned against , and has forgiven , thus exercising the function that raises us nearest to a level with the Godhead . And meanwhile Esther , left behind in wintry Wales , takes his emptied place at triste Plas Berwyn . Despite all her resolves , despite her high talk that a morsel of Mrs. Brandon 's bread would choke her — that it would be better to starve than to be under any obligation to the family of the man she has betrayed — she is now eating that suffocating bread , now lying under those annihilating obligations . Want makes us swallow our dignity — makes us do many mean things . One must live ; one must keep in that breath that perhaps is only spent in sighs : and Mr. James Greenwood has made us all out of love with the workhouse . So she sits down three times a day at Mrs. Brandon 's table , the unwillingest guest that ever sat at any board , and eats the bread of charity , and the roast mutton and apple - tart of charity , when the conclusion of the long Puritan grace gives her permission to do so . There is plenty of time for thinking at Plas Berwyn , for in that still household talk is not rife . When people never leave their own little one earth - nook , rarely see any one beyond their immediate family circle , and rarelier still read any reviews , papers , books , that treat of any subject but one , they have not much to talk about . There are few minds original enough , copious enough , to suffice to them- selves — to be able to do without supplies derived from external objects . Our thoughts are generally our own , merely by right of immediate possession ; mostly they are the thoughts of others , more or less digested , more or less amalgamated with thought - matter of our own . They are not unkind to her , these chill faded women . Not loving her — for , as Bessy appositely quoted , "
103584	104010	102888	102888	she	826	" — and Esther and they are most surely in nothing agreed ; mistrusting her , though not knowing , of having dealt falsely by their brother ; sincerely , though bigotedly , looking upon her society as unprofitable — nay , almost contaminating ; as being one of the unregenerate many — one standing in the cold , outside their little clique of elect , safe souls : despite all this , they are yet willing to give her food and shelter , to give them her for an indefinite number of years , to make her a part of their own dry sapless lives . But she is not willing — oh , most unwilling ! Let me not be mistaken , however : it is not with the dryness and saplessness of the offered life that she quarrels . Life must henceforth be to her , everywhere , dry and sapless ; the duller it is , the less it contrasts with her own thoughts . It must be lived somewhere : it can be lived pleasurably nowhere . Then , why not unpleasurably , greyly , negatively , at Plas Berwyn ? Why not , supposing that she had been able to pay for her own cups of tea and slices of mutton , for her own iron bedstead and deal washhand - stand ? But , supposing that she was not able ; supposing that she was so destitute as to be glad , even while weeping over his poor rough body , that her old dog had died because she was too poor to be able to keep him ; supposing that this life entailed upon her the bitter pain of being daily , hourly grateful to people for whose society she had a strong repugnance , and upon whom , in the person of one of their nearest and dearest , she had inflicted a mortal injury ? It is hard to live with people whose every idea runs counter to your own — whose whole tone of thought and conversation is diametrically opposed to what you have been used to all your life — and yet not be able to contradict , to argue with , or differ from them , because you are eating of their bread and drinking of their cup . The mere fact of feeling that you are too deeply indebted to people to be able , without flagrant ingratitude , to quarrel , makes you desire ardently to fall out with them . "
104022	104033	104016	104018	a professed beggar	2248	" thinks Esther , with a sort of grim humour . "
104072	104184	104186	104186	you	2251	" It is only the very basest and the very noblest natures that can accept great favours and not be crushed by them . Esther 's is neither . To her it is only the thought that her state of dependence is temporary that makes it supportable . She has lost no time in appealing to Mrs. Brandon for her aid in the search for work — work , that vague word , that conveys to her no distinct idea , that stands to her in the place of something to be done by her , in return for which she may be able to obtain food and drink , without saying "
104187	104333	104334	104335	Mrs. Brandon	201	" to any one for them . On the afternoon of the day of Bob 's departure Esther has been sitting for an hour or more , in listless sadness , on the fender - stool before the fire , her eyes staring vacantly at the battered Michaelmas daisies aqd discoloured chrysanthemums in the wintry , darkening garden outside . Mrs. Brandon 's steel knitting - pins click gently , as she knits round and round , round and round , in the monotonous eternity of a long - ribbed knickerbocker stocking . The fire - gleams flicker dully red on the sombre , large - patterned flock - paper , which makes the room look twice as small and twice as dark as it need otherwise do . Esther is roused from her reverie by the entrance of the servant with the moderator lamp . "
104337	104345	104334	104335	Mrs. Brandon	201	" she says , addressing her hostess . "
104351	104353	104334	104335	Mrs. Brandon	201	" The "
104356	104365	104366	104366	Bob	190	" is a concession to Bob 's memory . "
104370	104380	104382	104382	you	804	" says the young girl , with some diffidence , "
104403	104418	104419	104419	My	0	" The old lady looks scrutinizingly at her over the tops of her spectacles . "
104450	104451	104446	104446	I	0	" "
104456	104463	104453	104453	you	804	" asks the other , timidly . "
104474	104488	104472	104472	I	0	" ( with a slight expressive accent on the I and my ) . "
104499	104510	104511	104511	I	0	" cries the girl , eagerly . Mrs. Brandon hesitates : "
104531	104532	104511	104511	I	0	" "
104539	104545	104533	104533	I	0	" she answers , despondently ; "
104574	104575	104577	104577	you	804	" "
104600	104606	104607	104607	I	0	" She shakes her head . "
104686	104693	104741	104741	one	559	" Mrs. Brandon pauses in consideration . "
104703	104714	104741	104741	one	559	" she remarks , with an emphasis on the word . "
104733	104734	104741	104741	one	559	" "
104753	104760	104741	104741	one	559	" answers Esther , rather grimly ; "
104790	104791	104783	104783	they	547	" "
104799	104924	104925	104925	they	2272	" inquires her companion , rather doubtfully . Esther gives an involuntary gasp . It is not a pleasant sensation when the consciousness that one is about to descend from the station that one has been born and has grown up in is first brought stingingly home to one . Happiness , they say , is to be found equally in all ranks , but no one ever yet started the idea that it was sweet to go down . Quick as lightning there flashed before her mind the recollection of a slighting remark made by Miss Blessington , à propos of two very second - rate young ladies , who had come to call at Felton one day during her visit there , that "
104931	104938	104928	104929	little milliners	2273	" Was she going to be a "
104942	104943	104944	104944	I	0	" "
104954	104982	104983	104983	I	0	" she answers , gently , wondering meanwhile that the idea has never before struck her what a singularly inefficient , incapable member of society she is . "
105014	105043	104944	104944	I	0	" Recollecting whose stockings it was that she had been used to mend in the boggling way she speaks of , a knife passes through her quivering heart . "
105062	105063	105059	105059	I	0	" "
105068	105082	104944	104944	I	0	" ( bending down her long white neck in a despondent attitude ) ; "
105084	105092	105059	105059	I	0	" ( with regathered animation in eye and tone)—"but
105153	105199	105200	105200	My	0	" Mrs. Brandon 's eyes travel involuntarily to the small , idle , white hands that lie on Esther 's lap — the blue - veined , patrician hands that she is so calmly destining to spend their existence in trundling mops and scouring floors . "
105204	105215	105200	105200	My	0	" she says , with compelled compassion in her voice , "
105264	105265	105266	105266	I	0	" "
105276	105282	105266	105266	I	0	" answer Esther , firmly , "
105321	105322	105319	105319	she	2283	" "
105327	105345	105319	105319	she	2283	" pursues Mrs. Brandon — unconvinced by Esther 's anecdote , which indeed she treats as apocryphal — "
105391	105419	105420	105421	Mrs. Brandon	201	" Esther 's little face seems to catch some of the deep fire - glow — her breast heaves up and down in angry , quick pants . "
105434	105446	105424	105424	you	201	" she begins , fiercely ; then breaks off , ashamed . "
105459	105467	105468	105468	I	0	" ( with a long low sigh ) "
105493	105494	105495	105495	I	0	" "
105530	105531	105522	105522	you	148	" "
105539	105540	105522	105522	you	148	" "
105543	105554	105522	105522	you	148	" answers Mrs. Brandon , with cool , common sense . "
105619	105620	105652	105652	you	148	" "
105628	105635	105652	105652	you	148	" cries the child , passionately . "
105702	105703	105705	105705	you	148	" "
105710	105751	105708	105708	Esther	148	" answers Mrs. Brandon , loving her too little , and respecting her independence of spirit too much , to reason further with her . There is a pause — a pause broken presently by Esther , who speaks diffidently : "
105807	105813	105757	105757	you	201	" Mrs. Brandon looks doubtful . "
105880	105881	105883	105883	she	2301	" "
105888	105895	105883	105883	she	2301	" suggests Esther , rather timidly . "
105901	105902	105883	105883	she	2301	" "
105908	105921	105903	105903	They	2303	" says the girl , involuntarily drawing up her slight élancé figure ; "
105931	105932	105933	105933	I	0	" "
105944	105952	105933	105933	I	0	" answers the old lady , drily ; "
105956	105967	105933	105933	I	0	" she continues , pursing up her mouth rather primly , "
106010	106011	106008	106008	you	2307	" "
106014	106036	106008	106008	you	2307	" repeats Esther , rather resentfully , raising her great eyes in unfeigned , displeased surprise to her companion 's face . "
106065	106066	106067	106067	I	0	" "
106078	106085	106067	106067	I	0	" returns Mrs. Brandon , sharply ; "
106095	106096	106067	106067	I	0	" "
106120	106133	106104	106104	they	3426	" says Esther , not yet quite recovered from her annoyed astonishment ; "
106157	106179	106180	106180	Esther	148	" Mrs. Brandon takes off and lays down her spectacles the better to point the rebuke she is about to administer . "
106182	106188	106180	106180	Esther	148	" she says , severely , "
106260	106271	106272	106272	I	0	" Esther flings up her head with an angry gesture . "
106290	106296	106279	106280	a person	759	" she says , contemptuously , "
106352	106353	106355	106355	you	148	" "
106374	106391	106355	106355	you	148	" says Mrs. Brandon , resuming her spectacles , and beginning to knit faster than ever , "
106403	106465	106392	106392	I	0	" An apposite retort rises prompt and saucy to Esther 's lips , clamouring for egress through those sweet red gates ; but the recollection of Mrs. Brandon 's weak tea and legs of mutton , and the obligations thereto hanging , drives it back again . She leans her elbow on her knee , and elevates her straight dark brows . "
106470	106476	106478	106478	you	148	" she says , gravely , "
106510	106629	106498	106498	one	559	" But Mrs. Brandon is silent , counting her stitches , buried in calculations as to whether her stocking - leg has attained the length and breadth suited to the dimensions of one of her son 's large limbs . The wind shakes the shutter as if , in its lonely coldness outside , it coveted the fire and lamp - light . The old grey cat sits on the fender - stool beside Esther , yawning prodigiously every now and then ; her round fore - paws gathered trimly under her , and the sleepy benignity of her face half - contradicting the fierce stiffness of her whiskers , and the tigerish upward curve of her lips . "
106644	106714	106715	106715	We	2328	" says Mrs. Brandon , presently , having satisfactorily calculated that five more rows will conduct her to Bob 's large heel — giving utterance to her little trite saw with a certain air of complacency . Original remarks come forth doubtfully , questioningly , feeling their way : it is only a well aired platitude that can strut and swagger forwards in the certainty of a good reception . "
106750	106751	106793	106793	you	804	" "
106761	106779	106793	106793	you	804	" cries Esther , the lilies in her fair cheek turning quickly to deepest , angriest carnations . "
106816	106817	106818	106818	I	0	" "
106825	106832	106823	106823	Esther	148	" answers Mrs. Brandon , coldly . "
106840	106894	106895	106895	I	0	" exclaims the girl , passionately , throwing herself on the floor beside Mrs. Brandon , too much in earnest to be chilled by the frosty cold of her manner ; her whole soul thrown , in bright entreaty , into the great clear pupils of her superb , up - looking eyes . "
106936	106956	106933	106934	Mrs. Brandon	201	" she says , laying her little eager hand on her companion 's rusty - black - coburg knee ; "
107027	107028	107038	107038	Esther	148	" "
107040	107056	107038	107038	Esther	148	" replied Mrs. Brandon , deliberately rubbing her spectacles gently with her pocket - handkerchief , "
107102	107103	107159	107159	God	435	" "
107117	107135	107159	107159	God	435	" cries the other , springing impetuously to her feet , and drawing up her head haughtily . "
107138	107157	107159	107159	God	435	" she continues , beginning to walk up and down the little room with agitated steps and fingers hotly interlaced—"why
107221	107313	107314	107314	Esther	148	" Mrs. Brandon deposits her knitting on the table ; rises slowly — old people 's joints , like wooden dolls , decline to bend on short notice ( it is a pity , is it not , that our machinery is not calculated to remain in a state of efficiency , even through our paltry seventy years?)—dismounts from the footstool , on which her feet have been perched , walks to the door , there stands , and , shaking her stiff , grey curls , speaks with trembling severity : "
107338	107339	107314	107314	Esther	148	" "
107387	107415	107426	107427	Mrs. Brandon	201	" This is the modest form in which Miss Craven 's desire for work comes before the public . She had begged earnestly for the expunging of the "
107419	107420	107426	107427	Mrs. Brandon	201	" "
107429	107440	107426	107427	Mrs. Brandon	201	" she says , with vexed tears in her eyes ; "
107461	107462	107426	107427	Mrs. Brandon	201	" "
107476	107588	107591	107592	a cook	2343	" answers promptly Mrs. Brandon , who , having paid for the insertion of the advertisement , thinks that she has a right to word it as she wishes . And now it has gone forth through the length and breadth of the civilized world , from the Arctic to the Antarctic Poles — has found its way into clubs and cafés , hotels and private houses , numerous as the sea - sand grains , in the overgrown advertisement sheet of the Times . To not one in ten thousand of that journal 's millions of readers is it more interesting than any other announcement in the long columns of — "
107594	107595	107598	107599	a cook	2343	" "
107601	107602	107605	107608	a good plain cook	2345	" "
107610	107611	107614	107615	a footman	2346	" "
107617	107618	107621	107622	a footman	2346	" "
107624	107999	107621	107622	a footman	2346	" A companionship , then , is what has been decided upon as the vocation to which Esther is best suited : it requires neither French nor German , neither astronomy nor the use of the globes : it demands only a patience out - Jobing Job , a meekness out - Mosesing Moses , a capacity for eating dirt greater than that of any parvenu struggling into society , health and spirits more aggressively strong than a schoolboy 's , and a pliability greater than an osier 's . These qualities being supposed to be more quickly acquirable than music , drawing , and languages , Esther has decided upon entering on the office that will call for the exercise of them all . Besides the printed advertisement above quoted , Mrs. Brandon has been advertising largely in private , by means of many long - winded epistles ; has been seeking far and wide among the circle of her acquaintance for some grey maid , wife , or widow , in the tending of whose haggard , peevish age Esther may waste her sweet , ripe youth , unassailed by wicked men , in safe , respectable misery . And meanwhile Esther waits — waits through the fog - shrouded , sun - forgotten November days , through the eternal black November nights,—waits , straying lonely along the steaming tree - caverned wood - paths — the solemn charnels of the dead summer nations of leaves and flowers . Preachers are fond of drawing a parallel between us and those forest leaves ; telling us that , as in the autumn they fall , rot , are dissolved , and mingle together , stamped down and shapeless , in brown confusion , and yet in the spring come forth again , fresh as ever ; so shall we — who , in our autumn , die , rot , and are not — come forth again in our distant spring , in lordly beauty and gladness . So speaking , whether thinkingly or unthinkingly , they equivocate — they lie ! It is not the same leaves that reappear ; others like them burst from their sappy buds , and burgeon in .the "
108005	108080	107621	107622	a footman	2346	" but not they — not they ! They stir not , nor is there any movement among the sodden earth- mass that was them . If the parallel be complete , others like us — others as good , as fair , as we ! but yet not we — other than us , shall break forth in lusty youth , in their strong May - time ; but we shall rot on ! "
108102	108166	108092	108092	God	435	" how much longer can you bear the weight of all your dead children , that lie so heavy on your mother breast ! One morning , on joining the Brandon family before prayers , Esther finds Mrs. Brandon reading aloud a letter ; but on Esther 's entrance she desists . Hearing her voice stop , the young girl comes forward eagerly . "
108172	108183	108186	108186	Esther	148	" she asks , panting , forgetting her morning salutations . "
108188	108263	108186	108186	Esther	148	" replies Mrs. Brandon , laconically , continuing to read , but this time to herself . Esther walks to the window , drums on the rain - beaten pane , returns to the table ; takes up the bread - knife , and begins to chip bits of crust off the loaf ; sits down , gets up again ; then , unable to contain herself any longer , cries out , hastily , "
108270	108271	108186	108186	Esther	148	" "
108302	108384	108289	108289	I	0	" answers the old lady , drily . Esther sits down again , snubbed ; and then the door opens , and the three middle - aged , quakerish maid - servants make their sober entry , each with bible and hymnal in her hand ; and the long exposition , the eight - versed hymn , and extempore prayer set in . To Esther 's ears , all the words of exposition , hymn , and prayer seem to be , "
108394	108395	108396	108396	I	0	" "
108402	108413	108396	108396	I	0	" begins Mrs. Brandon , slowly addressing Esther , when the "
108415	108419	108396	108396	I	0	" is ended , "
108452	108453	108433	108434	a lady	1109	" "
108456	108462	108433	108434	a lady	1109	" interrupted Esther , breathlessly . "
108508	108509	108562	108563	Mrs. Brandon	201	" "
108519	108543	108562	108563	Mrs. Brandon	201	" says Esther , with a nearer approach to hopefulness in her face than has been seen there since her brother 's death . "
108581	108582	108583	108583	Blessington	258	" "
108585	108586	108587	108587	Blessington	258	" "
108589	108600	108587	108587	Blessington	258	" repeats Essie , her lips parting in some dismay . "
108622	108623	108624	108624	I	0	" "
108667	108677	108679	108679	they	2358	" Esther passes by the small reproach in silence . "
108687	108691	108679	108679	they	2358	" suggests Bessy . "

108738	108752	108734	108736	the same family	2372	" remarks Mrs. Brandon , intending to say something rather agreeable than otherwise . "

108765	108798	108762	108762	I	0	" Esther says , contracting her forehead in the effort to recall all that was said upon a subject which at the time interested her too little to have made much impression — "
108826	108827	108801	108801	her	258	" "
108835	108836	108801	108801	her	258	" "
108844	108858	108801	108801	her	258	" cries Essie , a look of acute chagrin passing over her features . "
108887	108888	108879	108879	I	0	" "
108895	108917	108879	108879	I	0	" inquires the other , staring in displeased astonishment from under her thick white eyebrows at her young protégée . Silence . "
108921	108933	108879	108879	I	0	" inquires the old lady , looking rather suspiciously at her , "
108962	108963	108879	108879	I	0	" "
108970	109035	108879	108879	I	0	" answers Essie , vehemently , blushing scarlet as any June poppy . The elder woman 's sharp ancient eyes pass like a gimlet through and through the younger one . They fasten with the pitiless fixedness of one who has passed the age for blushing , and has consequently no compassion for that infirmity upon the betraying red of her sweet bright cheeks . "
109043	109044	109037	109037	you	0	" "
109047	109055	109037	109037	you	0	" replies Esther , with steady slowness . "

109103	109113	109088	109088	you	0	" says Miss Bessy , with a sprightly smile . "
109120	109131	109116	109116	I	0	" answers Esther , bitterly , turning away her head ; "
109140	109141	109118	109118	Bessy	202	" "
109149	109163	109143	109143	I	0	" says Mrs. Brandon , with an inquisitorial elevation of nose and spectacles , "

109227	109236	109206	109206	your	0	" answered the poor proud child , sighing , "

109259	109266	109206	109206	your	0	" answers Mrs. Brandon , chidingly ; "

109369	109423	109424	109424	Cynegan	432	" Mrs. Brandon seats herself at the table , and begins to pour out the tea out of a huge , deep - bodied family tea - pot . Miss Bessy divides the small curling rashers of fat bacon into four exactly equal portions . At Plas Berwyn it is generally a case of "
109434	109496	109424	109424	Cynegan	432	" That is to say , at the first onslaught everything vanishes ; and if any one , with fruitless gluttony , craves a second help , he must console himself with the idea that many medical men agree in the opinion that , in order to preserve ourselves in perfect health , we should always rise from table feeling hungry . "
109499	109532	109534	109534	Esther	148	" says Mrs. Brandon , resuming the conversation , and setting her words to the music of a peculiarly crisp piece of toast , which she eats with a rather infuriating sound of crunching—"If
109595	109616	109617	109617	Esther	148	" Esther stoops her head in silence over her fat bacon , which she has not the heart to eat . "
109633	109640	109629	109629	she	148	" says Bessy , smiling slightly — "

109670	109676	109667	109667	I	0	" answers Esther , gloomily . "
109683	109700	109677	109677	I	0	" says Mrs. Brandon , taking another piece of toast , and shaking her head prophetically , "
109724	109725	109677	109677	I	0	" "
109729	110124	109677	109677	I	0	" answers the young girl , calmly ; but to her own heart she says that she defies any earthly furnace to burn hotlier than the one she has already passed through . IN another week letters have passed , references been asked and given ; Esther proved unimpeachably respectable ; the amount of her salary agreed upon ; the day of her journey into — shire fixed , and all preliminaries settled previous to her undertaking the agreeable , free , and independent office of companion to John Blessington , Esq . , of Blessington Court , in the county of — , aged eighty - nine , and to Harriet Blessington his wife , aged eighty . Miss Craven has but one good - bye to say , and on the afternoon of the day before her departure she stands in the churchyard ready to say it . It is only to a grave . Huge cloud headlands , great leaden capes and promontories , mournful and heavy with unwept snow - tears , heap and pile themselves up behind the dim mirk hills ; it snowed last night , but the snow has nearly all melted ; only enough remains to make the old dirty church - tower , from which great patches of whitewash have fallen , look dirtier than ever . Upon the broken headstones , all awry and askew with age and negligence , the lichens flourish dankly . Wet nettles and faded bents overlie , overcross each cold hillock . No one cares to weed in the garden of the dead . Each hillock is the last chapter in some forgotten history . Oh ! why must all stories that are told truly end amongst the worms ? Why must death be always at the end of life ? Oh ! if we could but get it over , like some cruelest operation , in the middle or early part of our little day ; so that we might have some half a life , some quarter or twentieth part even of one , to live merrily in , to breathe and laugh and be gay in , without , in our cheerfullest moments , experiencing the chilly fear of feeling the black - cloaked skeleton - headed phantom lay his bony finger on us , saying , "
110129	110308	110313	110313	Jack	146	" Upon the grey flat tombstone near the church - gate the great grave yew has been dropping her scarlet berries , one by one — berries that shine , like little lights , amid the night of her changeless foliage : there they lie like a forgotten rosary , that some holy man , having prayed amongst the unpraying dead , going , has left behind him . Evening is closing in fast ; the air is raw and chill ; no one that can avoid it is outside a house 's sheltering walls : there is no one to disturb Esther 's meeting with her brother . What cares she for the cold , or for the six feet of miry earth that part them . She flings herself upon the sodden mound ; stretching herself all along upon it , as the prophet stretched himself on the young dead child — hand to hand , heart to heart , mouth to mouth . She lays her lips upon the soaked soil , and whispers moaningly , "
110344	110463	110464	110464	Lord	2392	" Lord God ! of what stuff can Mary and Martha have been made , to have overlived the awful ecstasy of seeing their dead come forth in warm supple life out of the four - days - holding grave ! Their hearts must have been made of tougher fibre than ours , or , in the agony of that terrible rapture , soul and body must have sundered suddenly , and they fallen down into the arms of that tomb whence their brother had just issued in his ghastly cerements , in dazed , astonished gladness ! As Esther lifts her streaming eyes , they fall upon the inscription on the cross at the grave - head : "
110474	110496	110497	110497	Lord	2394	" She casts her arms about the base of the holy symbol ; she presses her panting breast against the stone . "
110507	110563	110497	110497	Lord	2394	" she cries too ; and surely the live sinner needs mercy as much as the dead one ? And as she so lies prostrate , with her forehead leant against the white damp marble , a hideous doubt flashes into her heart — sits there , like a little bitter serpent , gnawing it : "
110584	110631	110632	110632	They	2397	" . . . . . . . Let me not go mad!Sweet Heaven , forgive weak thoughts ! If there should beNo God , no heaven , no earth in the void world — The wide , grave , lampless , deep , unpeopled world . "
110713	110786	110793	110793	she	148	" What if this great distant being , who , without any foregone sin of ours , has laid upon us the punishment of life — in the hollow of whose hand we lie!—what if He be laughing at us all this while ! What if the sight of our writhings , of our unlovely tears and grotesque agonies , be to Him , in His high prosperity , a pleasant diversion ! "
110810	110821	110793	110793	she	148	" Lord , have mercy upon me , a sinner ! "
110907	110962	110989	110990	wretched Esther	148	" . . . . . . . . If this be all , And other life await us not , for oneI say , ' tis a poor cheat , a stupid bungle , A wretched failure 1 I , for one , protestAgainst it — and I hurl it back with scorn ! "

111159	111180	111182	111184	the good Lord	2410	" . . . . . They who loved Him said ' He wept,'None ever said ' He smiled ! ' "
111317	111332	111292	111292	she	2409	" If love were kind , why should we doubtThat holy death were kinder ? "
111424	111440	111394	111394	she	2409	" Good - bye , my boy , good - bye!—God bless you , Jack ! "

114021	114036	114038	114040	the young girl	3585	" I wish that — that stuff would not sway and shake about so , "
114054	114077	114038	114040	the young girl	3585	" Might not some one get behind it very easily and hide , as it does not seem to be fastened down ? "
114078	114081	114083	114084	Miss Blessington	258	" Possibly , "
114088	114099	114083	114084	Miss Blessington	258	" I never heard of such a thing having happened . "

114122	114126	114116	114116	Esther	148	" Not very . "
114127	114137	114138	114138	she	148	" Would no one hear me if I screamed ? "

115005	115013	114929	114929	Esther	148	" My uncle will be down presently , "
115018	115032	115015	115016	Miss Blessington	258	" and he will then expect you to read to him until luncheon . "
115033	115041	115043	115043	Esther	148	" To read what ? The Bible ? "
115068	115078	115015	115016	Miss Blessington	258	" The Bible ? Oh , dear , no ! "
115086	115121	115015	115016	Miss Blessington	258	" The papers : the Times , Saturday , and Justice of the Peace , are his favourites ; he takes a great , a remarkable interest , considering his age , in politics . "
115122	115128	115130	115130	Esther	148	" I like reading aloud , "
115140	115150	115152	115152	Constance	256	" Reading aloud to my uncle is very fatiguing , "
115156	115198	115199	115199	she	148	" one has to sustain one 's voice at a pitch several octaves higher than the natural one . I attempted reading to him once or twice , but it affected my throat so much that I had to leave off , "

115302	115307	115267	115267	Esther	148	" Quite — thanks . "

115314	115319	115267	115267	Esther	148	" Yes — thanks . "

115366	115524	115359	115359	He	247	" replies Miss Blessington , with the conscious smile that had formerly exasperated Esther , and with an emphasis not common with her . Miss Blessington does not usually employ emphasis : it is mezzoceto , as is enthusiasm of which it is the exponent . Half an hour later Esther is sitting beside the old squire , as close as possible to his best ear , brandishing the Times ' giant squares in her unaccustomed hand . The old squire is a superb wreck . Spiteful Time is fond of removing the landmarks that youth sets upon our faces ; is fond of changing great , clear , almond eyes into little damp jellies — sweet moist pursemouths into dry bags of wrinkles ; but it is a task beyond even his power to destroy the shape of that grand old bent head — to deface the outlines of that thin - nostriled , patrician nose .

115556	115590	115527	115527	I	0	" replies the old gentleman , promptly , thrusting his hand into his breast , and closing his eyes , in his favourite attitude . Esther has not the most distant idea where the "
115595	115644	115527	115527	I	0	" lives : she turns the huge sheets topsy - turvy — inside out , outside in — in the vain search for their habitat , making , meanwhile , the most unjustifiable aggressive rustling and crackling , which she presumptuously trusts to his deafness not to hear . "
115656	115665	115666	115666	I	0	" he says presently , with some pettishness . "
115673	115680	115666	115666	I	0	" she unwisely answers , trembling . "
115699	115713	115688	115689	The dead	2540	" he rejoins , snappishly . Having at length mastered the fact that the "

115731	115743	115688	115689	The dead	2540	" Esther gives the desired information . Then follows a leader : "

115814	115815	115806	115806	God	435	" "

115885	115941	115942	115942	I	0	" Esther now proceeds for a considerable period unchecked — gradually and unconsciously relapsing into the brisk gallop so dear to youth when engaged upon a subject that does not interest it . Suddenly a deep slumberous breath , drawn close to her ear , makes her aware that her hearer has lapsed into sleep . "
115949	116012	115942	115942	I	0	" she says to herself , with a sort of triumphant feeling at her own prowess , taking furtive glances at the wrinkled profile , sunk , in perfect imbecility of slumber , on his breast . Not feeling any particular personal interest in the effect of Secession upon American politics , she stops , and gazes vacantly out of window at the "
116018	116035	115942	115942	I	0	" But the cessation of the sweet monotony that lulled him , arouses the old man . "
116042	116057	115942	115942	I	0	" he cries , fussily , lifting his head and opening his dim eyes . "
116086	116129	116070	116070	you	0	" She complies , and so , with dozing and waking , waking and dozing , on one side , reading and stopping , stopping and reading on the other , the little drama plays itself out till nearly luncheon - time . "
116154	116187	116149	116149	Constance	256	" asks the old lady , as they quit the luncheon - table — Esther dutifully bringing up the rear , with air - cushion , footstool , and couvre - pied . "
116200	116210	116193	116193	aunt	1203	" answers Constance , with the utmost sweetness ; the "
116215	116293	116195	116195	I	0	" seeming to imply that on some future morrow she will gladly avail herself of the invitation to join her elderly relatives in their triste airing ; but Miss Blessington being in her generation a wise woman , that morrow never comes . The old family - coach rolls round the frosty sweep to the door ; two large horses , sleek and fat with over - many oats and over - little work , draw it . "

116329	116566	116316	116317	Miss Craven	164	" says the old lady , appearing at the door , transformed , by the aid of numberless cloaks and shawls , and a huge velvet bonnet , date anno domini , into a large and perfectly shapeless bundle . Supported on one side by Esther 's slender arm , and on the other by the florid and plethoric butler , she is hoisted up the three steps into the body of the ancient machine , which is painted invisible green , and hung marvellous high in air . The same course is pursued with the old gentleman , who , muffled , comfortered , and scarved up to the tip of his venerable nose , follows . Lastly , the young prop steps in , and sits down humbly with her back to the horses — a process which usually ends in making her sick . The windows are shut tight up ; a great hot skin of some wild beast is thrown over their knees ; in that confined atmosphere it emits a strong furry odour , more powerful than agreeable ; striving emulously with it — sometimes mastering it , sometimes mastered by it — is the fusty smell of the cloth lining . The old people do not seem to perceive either ; old noses haie less keen scent , old lungs require less air to feed on , than young ones . "
116579	116625	116316	116317	Miss Craven	164	" goes the old vehicle along the beaten snow of the broad turnpike - road . As they are jogging a little brisklier than usual down a very slight decline , the old gentleman speaks — his strong , shaky old voice loudly audible above the "
116632	116650	116316	116317	Miss Craven	164	" which , joined to the want of air , is fast making Esther faint and headachy : "
116686	116687	116688	116688	I	0	" "
116699	116715	116696	116697	Mr. Blessington	438	" answers the old lady , nervously laying hold of the side of the carriage ; "
116736	116737	116738	116739	Miss Craven	164	" "
116759	116823	116751	116751	him	1310	" says the old gentleman , in some excitement . Miss Craven , having with some difficulty lowered the front window , thrusts her head out of it , and , having taken the opportunity to open mouth and nose and eyes as wide as they will go , to inhale as large a quantity as possible of crisp fresh air , cries : "
116834	116920	116751	116751	him	1310	" Ruggles grins , but complies , and subsides into a solemn walk , which continues until they reach Shelford . There smug bareheaded shop - keepers , violet - nosed , scarlet - fingered , standing out in the cold street at the carriage - door , executing with pleased alacrity extensive commissions of half a yard of elastic for Miss Blessington — three ounces of red wool for Mrs. Blessington 's knitting — half a dozen blue envelopes for Mr. Blessington . Then , "
116929	117697	116751	116751	him	1310	" home again . Dinner at six : a later hour would be fatal to his digestion , the old gentleman thinks , then , a nice long evening — long as one of those Veillées du Cháteau , when Madame la Baronne read aloud some enthralling yet severely moral tale , and Cassar and Caroline and Pulchérie all sat entranced , unheeding the flight of time , as ticked away by the château clocks . There is only one small lamp in the whole of the grand old room , and that , in deference to the old man 's failing eyes , is hung with so large and deep a green shade , that it is impossible to see to do anything by its light . There is nothing for it but to gape , from seven till ten , at the great battle - pieces hung round the walls — to endeavour to make out , by the aid of the fitful firelight , the singularly clean dead bodies , free apparently from the slightest speck of dust , or stain of blood ; at the red - nostriled chargers , snorting away their ebbing lives with all four legs in the air . At ten o'clock , James rung for , to light the candles : then Mrs. Blessington , her air - cushion , work - basket , and Shetland shawl , escorted to her room ; two long chapters and several psalms read to her ; then a frightened rush along dark passages and draughty galleries to the great distant bedroom — to the rats ' multifarious noises ; to the ingenious tunes played by the wind upon the rattling window - frames ; to the ginger - curtained bed and many - folded screen ; to possible sleep , and certain terrors — terrors none the less awful for being totally unreasonable . THIS first day is a sample of Esther 's new life ; the other days were like it — not a jot better , not a jot worse . The same thing happened at the same time each day : no two things ever changed places . It was a life that provided all the necessaries of life — that demanded no hard manual labour , no overworking of the brain . The intellectual faculties that it called into play must have been possessed by any moderately intelligent seven - years ' child . No one bullies Esther ; no one oppresses her ; no one troubles their head much about her . So as she performs her monotonous , easy , tiresome little duties towards them , the old people have no sort of objection to her enjoying life , if she can . With the aged , comfort and happiness are interchangeable terms : continuous warmth of body , pleasant - tasted meats , a profound stagnant quiet around their arm - chairs , much sleep — these are their summum bonum . They have had love , and have outlived it — excitement also , and grief : they have outlived all but the elemental instincts that refuse to be outlived . Looking back from the vantage - ground of dotage on the fought battle of life , they wonder that any one can long to be in the thick of it . In this life of Esther 's there are no hardships to be borne — none of those sufferings , the enduring of which with self - conscious complacent heroism almost compensates them . It has none of the elements of tragedy : there is nothing very noble in bearing with respectable patience the trifling annoyance of making yourself hoarse roaring the price of wheat , and the pros and cons of disendowment , into an old man 's ear ; there is nothing grand in picking up the countless dropped stitches in an old woman 's knitting . In it there is nothing to endure , nothing to enjoy ; it is essentially negative , flat , stale , sterile . It would be all very well if any end were to be seen to it ; if it were not a sort of small Eternity in life ; if there were to be distant holidays to be looked forward to , when the few saved pounds might be poured , with the joyful generosity of the very poor , into some stricken parent 's lap — might go to buy boots and shoes for needy little brothers and sisters . But "
117709	117788	116751	116751	him	1310	" All her life seems crowded into the seventeen years behind her ; there seems to be nothing left to happen in the fifty or sixty years ahead . She has nothing to look forward to but huge cycles of newspaper - reading , footstool - carrying , message- running ; of lending all her useful organs of sight and hearing and touch to others ; of keeping for herself only her suffering , aching , empty heart ! "
117800	117847	116751	116751	him	1310	" People pity her now , because she is so young and pretty — not reflecting that the possession of the two best gifts under heaven makes her so much the less worthy a subject for compassion . Twenty years hence , she will probably be a "
117849	117895	116751	116751	him	1310	" still — will be not near so young , nor near so touching , and infinitely more to be pitied . The snow lies long — longer than it generally does at this time of year . Ordinarily the old Cheshire saying holds good : "
117917	117950	116751	116751	him	1310	" But this October there has been ice enough to hold many ducks ; but yet the rest of the winter shows no signs of , as the homely saw phrases it , "
117955	118176	116751	116751	him	1310	" In the little flower - garden , round three sides of which the ivied buttressed house is built , only a white heap here , and a white depression there , show where bush or bed were wo nt to be . Over the fair wide park , with all its mimic hills and valleys , copses and spinneys , God has laid a great sheet — great as the one that was let down by its four corners on the housetop to the fastidious Apostle — a sheet purely , crisply , miserably white . In the park Esther , in the early gloaming , after the daily drive , so literally a promenade en voiture , takes long walks ; ruins her boots , discolours her petticoats , and makes her crape crimp with snow - water : strolls listless and alone under the old bare trees that have stripped off all their clothing — now at the very time that they seem to need them most ; traces the slender footprints of the famished birds — the little delicate tracks crossing and recrossing one another . And always the leading thought — displaced now and then by lesser thoughts , that flit like travelling swallows through her mind , but ever , ever returning — is , "
118196	118213	118218	118218	him	146	" If some trusty messenger could but come to her , with sure tidings , saying , "
118220	118269	118218	118218	him	146	" Has she any reason for believing him to be in heaven , beyond the vague confidence that most people seem to feel that their relatives must be there , on the principle , I suppose , of the French Duke , of whom his kindred remarked , that "
118286	118423	118270	118270	God	435	" Jack 's death had been most unlike the deaths of the shining Evangelical lights in Bessy Brandon 's books , whose whole lives had been but trifling prologues to the jubilant drama of their death . Death had been to them an ecstasy ; they had died with words of confident rapture on their lips , with strains of welcoming music in their ears : he had departed painfully , sadly , almost dumbly ; no sound of triuphant clarions greeted him from beyond Death 's deep ford . Is he , then , in hell ? Oh blessed doctrine of cleansing purgatorial pains ! if our faith would but admit of you ! Which of us does not seem to himself so much too bad for heaven , so much too good for hell ? "
118444	118538	118270	118270	God	435	" Where is he , then?—where is he ? She takes counsel of the mute forces of nature — of the clouds , the snows , and the blasts But of what use ? They knew not of his story ; or , if they did , they were forbidden to tell of it ; silence was laid like a seal upon their lips . It is not in the most edifying books that the grandest sayings are to be found . What can be nobler than this of Rousseau 's dying Julie : "
118554	118627	118270	118270	God	435	" The wearier in body she can return from these long , sad rambles , the better pleased is Esther ; for is not weariness the father of sleep — sleep , the one impartial thing under heaven ; sleep , the radical ; sleep , the leveller , that leaves a king 's arms to embrace a tinker ? But of what use is it to sleep , if in sleep one hear—"False
118644	118865	118270	118270	God	435	" And worse even than such dream - tortured slumber is fear - tortured waking . Constitutionally timid , a weakened body and broken spirit have made Esther pitiably nervous . Jealousy , remorse , and fear run a dreary race for the palm of extremest suffering ; and I am not sure that fear does not win . The poor child suffers the torments of the damned in her huge hearse - bed in the far - off , rat - haunted , ghostly old chamber . She dreads falling asleep , for fear of waking to find the low fire playing antics with Burke 's long nose and spectacles , with Pitt 's maypole figure on the screen ; flickering over the malignant fleshy Cupids on the wall ; waking to see , looking in upon her through the curtains , Jack 's face — not kind , débonnaire , smiling , as she used to see it in the study at home ( for that could frighten no one ) , but solemn , stiff , with closed eyes and bandaged chin , as she had last seen it . Sometimes she sits up in bed , a cold sweat standing on her brow , as some noise , distincter than usual , sounds through the room ; "
118870	118903	118270	118270	God	435	" as of some falling object ; an unexplained rustling in the passage ; a little clicking in the door - lock — sits up , listening with strained ears , thinking , "
118909	119026	118270	118270	God	435	" Momently she expects to see some crape - masked burglar enter the door or window . And if such burglar did enter , it would be useless to scream for help ; she is too far off from the rest of the household to be heard : it would be of no use to ring the bell , for it rings downstairs , miles away , and everybody is in bed and asleep upstairs . So she lies quaking — her terror now and then rising to such an uncontrollable pitch that she feels as though , if it lasted a moment longer , she must go mad : listening with intense impatience to the leisurely "
119038	119054	118270	118270	God	435	" of the cuckoo- clock outside ; listening with inexpressible longing to hear it say , "
119063	119166	118270	118270	God	435	" four times . At four o'clock she will be safe , she thinks ; at four o'clock cocks begin to crow , dairymaids to get up , the bodiless dead return to their churchyard homes , night 's unutterable horror to pass . What wonder if , after the agony of such vigils — agony causeless , you will say , unreasonable , but none the less real , none the less acute for that — she comes down in the morning wan , nerveless , with haggard cheeks , and great dark streaks under the unrested beauty of her eyes ? "
119176	119177	119174	119174	Christ	420	" "
119182	119357	118270	118270	God	435	" is past ; people have bought their raisins , and suet , and citron , and begun to mix their Christmas puddings . Turkeys lie dead , thick as autumn - leaves in Vallambrosa . The snow is gone , but not without leaving Miss Craven the legacy of a very bad cold , derived from countless soaked stockings and neglected wet petticoats . She has had it a fortnight , and her weakened , lowered frame seems incapable of shaking off the trifling ailment . For a week her voice has been almost gone , and she has consumed many sticks of liquorice , many boxes of black currant lozenges , in the endeavour to bring it back to the requisite shouting pitch for the inevitable daily newspaper reading . It is afternoon : heavy rain , following the thaw , has prevented the invariable drive to Shelford . Mrs. Blessington and the two girls are sitting in the great room hung with battle - pieces , which is old - fashionedly named "
119361	119423	118270	118270	God	435	" It is a mercy that it is a great room — else the fire , piled halfway up the chimney , and the never - opened windows would render it unendurably close . As it is , the atmosphere , though less stifling than that of the interior of the family - coach , is fustier than is altogether agreeable . "
119427	119434	119424	119425	My dear	804	" says Mrs. Blessington , shivering , "
119469	119632	119424	119425	My dear	804	" Esther complies , and then resumes her occupation of holding a skein of wool for Miss Blessington to wind . As often as she can do so without positive rudeness , she takes long looks at her companion 's face — immovably polished , like a monumental angel 's : looks at her , half out of that sheer love of beauty in any form , from a man 's to a beetle 's , which is innate in some sensuous natures ; partly , and much more , because each frosty - fair feature of her face , each trinket almost upon her person , is linked indissolubly in her mind with some look or word of St. John . Association , they say , lies stronger in a smell than in aught else — stronger than in anything seen or heard ; and so now the slight subtle scent floating from Constance 's perfumed hair recalls to the sad young "
119635	119673	119424	119425	My dear	804	" with a thrust of sharpest pain , her one day 's betrothal ; that one day for whose sweet sake she does not regret having endured the calamity of existence ; that day when they sowed — "
119687	119727	119728	119728	My	0	" It is odd how often , when one is musing dumbly on some unspoken name , the people in whose company one is give utterance to that name , without any former conversation having led up to it . "
119732	119750	119728	119728	My	0	" says Mrs. Blessington , her slow old thoughts having at length travelled from draughts and sandbags , "
119789	119846	119781	119781	I	0	" St. John 's room ! He is coming here , then ! The wool that she is holding drops forgotten into Esther 's lap ; the old delicious carmine that used to make her so like a dogrose springs up suddenly lovely into her face . Love is as hard to kill as any snake : "
119907	119908	119901	119901	thou	2558	" "
119929	120018	119922	119922	I	0	" says Constance , a slight shade of contemptuous displeasure in her voice . Esther jumps back to reality , to find Miss Blessington 's icy , unescapable eyes riveted upon her . She can not turn away her head , nor dive under the table for an imaginary lost handkerchief ; she can not lift her hands to hide her face ; her occupation , which keeps both ruthlessly employed , forbids it . She can only sit still , plainly crimson , and be stared at . "
120026	120053	120024	120024	aunt	1203	" Constance says , in her lady - like , piano voice , beginning again to turn the scarlet ball swiftly through her long pale fingers ; "
120092	120093	120078	120078	I	0	" "
120112	120125	120078	120078	I	0	" rejoins the old lady , gathering her wraps closelier about her : "
120164	120165	120167	120168	Mr. Gerard	247	" "
120171	120189	120167	120168	Mr. Gerard	247	" asks Esther , tremulously , resolute to show Miss Blessington that she can mention his name . "
120213	120233	120234	120235	Miss Craven	164	" replies the old lady , looking a little inquisitively at the tender rose - face of the girl . "
120244	120264	120265	120265	He	247	" Constance answers for her — no faintest gust of feeling apparently agitating the even indifference of her voice . "
120313	120325	120305	120305	he	247	" Esther stoops her head low down , choked with indignation . "
120341	120350	120327	120327	I	0	" she says , almost in a whisper ; "
120360	120361	120364	120364	he	247	" "
120366	120372	120364	120364	he	247	" Constance replies , carelessly . "
120421	120445	120446	120446	His	247	" Esther bites her lips , but has the sense to allow , with vast difficulty , this last observation to pass unquestioned . "
120452	120458	120446	120446	His	247	" continues Constance , placidly ; "
120491	120492	120471	120471	he	247	" "
120521	120579	120504	120505	Mr. Gerard	247	" remarks Esther , almost composedly ; a dim , exquisite hope flashing up in her mind that he has heard of her being at Blessington , and is coming to ask her to forgive him — to forgive her , rather ; to ask her to kiss and make friends . The story - book ending , "
120585	120626	120643	120643	aunt	1203	" is running through her brain , when her reverie is broken , gently , but very effectually , as reveries are apt to be , by a simple speech of Miss Blessington 's , spoken with a little smile : "
120645	120646	120631	120632	Miss Craven	164	" "
120650	120657	120643	120643	aunt	1203	" inquires the girl , eagerly . "
120674	120690	120692	120693	St. John	164	" ( speaking with slow triumph , and narrowly watching the effect of her words ) "
120706	120880	120881	120881	Our	2575	" The knife cuts as clean and clear as she could have wished ; the divine happy rose - flush slips away suddenly out of the poor blank face opposite her ; a grey ashy - white takes its place . She had thought that pain and pleasure were buried with Jack on the slope of Glan - yr - Afon 's mountain graveyard ; but that moment of raging agony undeceives her . For an instant the table and chairs seem dancing round ; a humming buzz sounds dully in her ears ; then the faintness passes ; the table and chairs stand still again ; the buzz ceases ; and she is sitting on an old gilt chair : her arms still moving mechanically , with the outstretched wool upon them , while Constance goes winding , winding on — winding away hope and pleasure and joy ; while the ball , growing larger under her hands , seems to have stolen its red colour from Esther 's heart - blood . "
120893	120902	120903	120903	they	2579	" says Miss Blessington with a subdued laugh ; "
120933	120934	120903	120903	they	2579	" "
120940	120953	120903	120903	they	2579	" replies Mrs. Blessington , shaking her head slowly to and fro , "
121011	121012	121016	121016	you	2583	" "
121020	121022	121024	121024	Esther	148	" ? "
121084	121092	121094	121094	Constance	256	" How long ? I really forget , "
121100	121125	121094	121094	Constance	256	" Oh , no ! By - the - by , I recollect ; it was almost immediately after you left Felton . I daresay "
121131	121152	121094	121094	Constance	256	" that you were among the ranks of the prophets ; lookers - on proverbially see most of the game . "
121153	121158	121160	121161	the girl	682	" Indeed — no ! "
121180	121189	121160	121161	the girl	682	" Nothing ever struck me as more unlikely ! "
121190	121200	121094	121094	Constance	256	" Indeed ! And why , may I ask ? "
121224	121229	121206	121206	Esther	148	" Why , pray ? "
121236	121241	121242	121242	she	148	" Because — because , "
121248	121279	121242	121242	she	148	" you had been brought up together from children ; because Mr. Gerard 's manner seemed so much more like a brother 's than a — a — lover 's . "
121288	121300	121302	121303	the other	1100	" We dislike public demonstrations of affection , both of us , "
121308	121317	121302	121303	the other	1100	" we leave those to servants and savages . "
121368	121378	121379	121379	Constance	256	" You have not congratulated me , Miss Craven , "
121406	121429	121400	121400	Esther	148	" I ? Oh , I beg your pardon ! I — I forgot ; I — I — I congratulate you ! "
121430	121443	121445	121445	Constance	256	" I was just going to write and tell you the news , "
121447	121481	121445	121445	Constance	256	graciously—"I thought it might interest you , as you had been with us so lately , and seen the whole thing going on — when we heard of your brother 's sudden death . "
121516	121526	121528	121529	Mrs. Blessington	437	" Was he your only brother , my dear ? "
121535	121538	121528	121529	Mrs. Blessington	437	" Yes . "
121539	121559	121528	121529	Mrs. Blessington	437	" Dear — dear ! Very sad — very sad ! And what did he die of ? Consumption ? "
121560	121565	121528	121529	Mrs. Blessington	437	" No — diphtheria . "
121566	121642	121528	121529	Mrs. Blessington	437	" Ah ! A very fatal complaint , my dear , especially among children . I have always had a great horror of it . In my younger days it used to be called sore throat , but I suppose it killed just as many people then as it does now that it has got a fine long Latin name . I suppose your poor brother suffered a great deal — didn't he , love ? "
121717	121738	121739	121739	Esther	148	" GET me some fresh candles — long ones ; longer than these — as long as you possibly can , "
121762	121780	121781	121782	the woman	3893	" I think , ' m , that you will find these will last for to- night , "
121806	121815	121816	121816	she	3893	" No — no , they wo n't ! "
121821	121832	121816	121816	she	3893	" it is better to be on the safe side . "
121833	121844	121781	121782	the woman	3893	" Would you like a night - light , miss ? "
121845	121877	121878	121878	she	3893	" Oh no , no ! they make the corners of the room blacker than ever , and they cast such odd shadows . I 'm so afraid of the dark , "
121883	121896	121878	121878	she	3893	" I 'm afraid you do n't sleep well , ' m ? "
121897	121906	121781	121782	the woman	3893	" Not very . By - the - by "
121914	121935	121781	121782	the woman	3893	" have you got anything that you could give me to make me sleep — any opiate of any kind ? "
121936	121960	121878	121878	she	3893	" I 've got a little laudanum , ma'am , that Mrs. Franklin give me last week when I had a bad face . "
121961	121966	121967	121967	she	3893	" Fetch it me , "

121999	122008	121992	121992	she	3893	" but I can not sleep for fright . "
122023	122035	122036	122036	Esther	148	" About how much ought one to take , I wonder ? "
122048	122079	122086	122086	her	148	" If you have never been used to take it before , I should think two or three drops would be hample , ' m ; I hope , ' m "
122092	122159	122086	122086	her	148	" as you 'll be careful not to take a hoverdose , or you might chance never to wake up again : I knew a young person as took it by mistake for ' black dose'—it was the fault of the chemist 's young man — and in an hour she was a corpse ; they said as she had took enough to kill ten men . "
122160	122173	122174	122175	Miss Craven	164	" It is no wonder that she was a corpse , then , "
122183	122188	122174	122175	Miss Craven	164	" I should not think "
122197	122228	122231	122231	her	148	" that there was enough here to kill one woman , let alone ten men . Yes , I 'll be careful ; thanks , very much . Good night ! "
122590	122598	122576	122576	we	2619	" I am here — remember me , "
122612	122641	122576	122576	we	2619	" Wilt thou remember me when I am gone , Further each day from thy vision withdrawn — Thou in the sunset , and I in the dawn ? "
122668	122699	122700	122701	Miss Craven	164	" I will remember thee for a very little while ; even till I see some one younger and prettier than thou wert , and then I will forget thee ! "
122766	122771	122772	122772	she	164	" At all events , "
122782	122845	122772	122772	she	164	" there is one comfort : he 'll be miserable — he'll curse the day when he ties himself to that lump of blancmange . Blancmange ! white meat ! that exactly expresses her ; she looks as if she would be good to eat — soft , luscious , ripe . Unfortunately , a man does not contemplate eating his wife ! "
123109	123119	123087	123087	she	256	" Why should one woman have all goodly things ? "
123244	123257	123258	123258	he	3402	" selon les us et coutumes Anglaises , elle aura beaucoup d'enfants ; "
123363	123380	123346	123346	he	3402	" She is bad , and she is ugly ; I was well rid of her ! "
123477	123593	123594	123594	She	2647	" ..... Worse than despair , Worse than the bitterness of death , is hope . It is the only ill which can find placeUpon the giddy , sharp , and narrow hourTottering beneath us . Plead with the swift frost , That it should spare the eldest flower of spring ; Plead with awakening earthquake , o'er whose couchEven now a city stands , strong , fair and free , Now stench and blackness yawns like death . Oh ! pleadWith famine and wind - walking pestilence , Blind lightning , or the deep sea ; not with man — Cruel , cold formal man - righteous in words , In deeds a Cain . "
123706	123719	123686	123686	She	2647	" Everything else is gone , why should not this go too ? "
123752	123763	123764	123764	she	2647	" It was only for my beauty he liked me , "
123771	123824	123764	123764	she	2647	" it was only for my beauty that anybody could like me ; there is nothing else to like in me . I never was clever , or said witty things , or sang , or played : I was only pretty . Now that that is gone , everything is gone ! "
124095	124120	124088	124089	the housemaid	647	" I hope you 'll be careful not to take an overdose , ' m , or you might chance never to wake again ! "
124151	124158	124088	124089	the housemaid	647	" Would God it were morning ! "
124164	124171	124088	124089	the housemaid	647	" Would God it were evening ! "
124679	124694	124702	124702	they	2672	" It is but a watch or a visionBetween a sleep and a sleep . "
124824	124873	124814	124814	we	2668	" Oh , Master , give me of this life ! I know not what it is , but I would fain taste it ; and if Thou givest it to me , I swear to Thee to keep and guard it carefully , as long as I may—. "
124926	124977	124923	124923	we	2668	" Oh , Great Builder ! take back that house in which , a reluctant tenant , Thou hast placed me . Resume Thy gift ; it is a burden too heavy for me ! Lay it , I pray Thee , on shoulders that mayhap may bear it stoutlier ! "
125029	125039	125040	125040	she	2677	" It is the key to all my doubts , "
125050	125098	125040	125040	she	2677	" it is the answer to all my questions . If I do but drink this little draught , I shall have all knowledge ; I shall never wonder again ! I shall know where Jack is ; I shall be with him ! But shall I ? "
125271	125417	125253	125253	her	2677	" If I go , I shall leave no gap behind me , any more than a teacupful of water taken out of a great pool leaves a gap behind . If it is disgraceful to go willingly out of the world , instead of being dragged unwillingly out of it , my disgrace is my own . I involve no one else in it ; there is no one of my name left to be ashamed of me . I leave no work undone in the world . Hundreds of others can carry air - cushions , and read to a deaf old man far more patiently than I have done . My fifty pounds a year will go to put daily bread into some other poor woman 's mouth , to whom it may perhaps taste sweeter than it has done to me . "
125429	125443	125444	125444	she	2677	" It is awful to go out into the dark all by oneself , "
125472	125517	125444	125444	she	2677	" and I , that hate the dark so — , is it very wicked of me to think of this thing ? People will say so , but I will not hear them . Where shall I be to - morrow at even ? "
125518	125539	125444	125444	she	2677	" You will be at Blessington , and feeling a good deal ashamed of your absurd paroxysm of cowardly despair , "

126865	126902	126822	126824	the old lady	3509	" he has more to say to her than I have . You see it was too great a strain on dear Constance 's strength reading to him every day , and he dislikes Gurney 's reading "
126909	126947	126822	126824	the old lady	3509	" he says he never minds his stops , and bawls at him ; and so we thought it better to get a person of more education , who would be always on the spot , and — "
126948	126953	126955	126956	St. John	164	" And whose strength , "
126962	126974	126955	126956	St. John	164	" unlike Constance 's , would be warranted un - overworkable ? "
126975	126978	126980	126982	the old lady	3509	" Exactly , "
126986	126999	127001	127001	Gerard	258	" And she is a satisfactory beast of burden , I hope ? "
127012	127018	127001	127001	Gerard	258	" fetches and carries well ? "
127019	127031	127033	127034	Mrs. Blessington	437	" She seems a nice , quiet , ladylike person enough , "
127058	127142	127001	127001	Gerard	258	lap—"only , unfortunately , over - sensitive : those sort of people always are . Why , it was only yesterday that she rushed from this room with such violence that she nearly shook Constance and me out of our chairs , because I made some slight observation about a brother of hers who died lately , and to whom , it seems , she was much attached . I 'm sure I had no intention of hurting her feelings , poor girl ! "
127143	127146	127148	127149	St. John	164	" Girl ! "
127153	127165	127148	127149	St. John	164	" that means a gushing thing of fifty , I suppose ? "
127166	127188	127001	127001	Gerard	258	" More like fifteen . By - the - by , she said something the other day about having known you . "
127189	127193	127195	127197	the young man	670	" Known me ! "
127205	127247	127195	127197	the young man	670	" Well , ' more know Tom Fool than Tom Fool knows . ' I never knew any one in my life that had a ' companion'—of this sort , I mean . What may my unknown friend 's name be ? "
127325	127328	127302	127303	St. John	164	" Constance ! "
127329	127334	127302	127303	St. John	164	" Who 's there ? "
127349	127372	127302	127303	St. John	164	" I. Can you come out and speak to me for a minute , if you are not in too great deshabille ? "
127373	127376	127302	127303	St. John	164	" Certainly . "
127608	127621	127596	127596	he	5153	" I say , does this sort of thing happen every day ? "
127622	127628	127596	127596	he	5153	" What sort of thing ? "
127650	127669	127596	127596	he	5153	" This feeding , I can not call it dining , like savages , at mid - day ? "
127670	127679	127681	127681	Constance	256	" It is a fancy of my uncle , "
127693	127717	127681	127681	Constance	256	" he imagines that , if he dined later , he should not have time to digest his food before going to bed . "
127725	127797	127718	127719	St. John	164	" In Heaven 's name let him digest in bed , then ; or , if not , let him dine by himself ! I 'm sure no one would object to that arrangement . Poor old boy ! he ca n't help it ; but it does take away one 's appetite to see a very old man mumbling his food , like a toothless old dog over a bone . "
127798	127814	127816	127816	Constance	256	" I suppose he may dine at what hour he chooses in his own house ? "
127820	127840	127842	127842	Gerard	258	" Of course he may . He may go back to the manners and customs of the ancient British , "
127846	127890	127842	127842	Gerard	258	" he may get up in the middle of the night and paint himself in blue - and - white stripes , instead of wearing coat and waistcoat , if he chooses — only he can hardly expect civilized beings to join him . "
127891	127908	127910	127910	Constance	256	" I always think it right , on principle , to humour old people 's whims , "
127949	127958	127960	127961	St. John	164	" A very excellent sentiment , my dear , "
127967	128080	127960	127961	St. John	164	" worthy of being copied by little boys and girls after they have mastered straight strokes and pot - hooks ; but to - night I must request the aged to humour my whim , and my whim is to absent myself from this symposium . I have got a splitting headache , and am altogether pretty nearly dead - beat . I have hardly a leg to stand upon : if you wo n't take it as a personal insult , I have a good mind to turn in at once . I have not been in bed , for any time worth speaking of , for the last ten days . "
128081	128084	128086	128086	Constance	256	" Indeed ! "
128120	128128	127960	127961	St. John	164	" You will please yourself of course . "
128129	128153	128155	128156	St. John	164	" If every one pleased themselves , and no one else , this would be a much more passable world to live in , "
128163	128188	128155	128156	St. John	164	" for then each person would get their fair share of attention neither more nor less , which is what they do not now . "

129503	129508	129510	129511	Mrs. Blessington	437	" Gone to bed ! "

I thought he seemed rather absent when he was talking to me before I went to dress ; and he left the room so abruptly too ! Are you sure , Constance , that he would not like something sent up to him ? "
129581	129600	129602	129602	Constance	256	" He is quite able to take care of himself , I assure you — thanks , aunt , "
129615	129646	129602	129602	Constance	256	" If we served him right , we should accept him as the invalid he pretends himself , and allow him nothing but a little water - gruel or arrowroot . "
129647	129676	129678	129680	the old lady	3509	" It seems so unnatural , a young man going to bed without his dinner ; I 'm sure , dear , I hope it is nothing serious , "
129711	129726	129728	129728	Constance	256	" Nothing more serious than the natural results of ten days ' Irish hospitality , "
129745	129775	129728	129728	Constance	256	" men are so fond of one another 's society when they get together , that they never can take it in moderation . I dislike bachelor parties particularly . "

129809	129840	129843	129844	the squire	2786	" Quite right , too!—quite right ! Sensible fellow — knows when he is well off ! So did I when I was his age — eh , Mrs. Blessington ? "

129914	129932	129934	129936	the old man	2484	" You 'll have to be content with the old squire again , Conny , my dear , "
129944	129957	129934	129936	the old man	2484	" you 'll find the old fellows are best , after all . "
129958	129972	129974	129974	Constance	256	" I quite agree with you , uncle — I think they are , "
130022	130036	130038	130038	Constance	256	" What a brilliant colour you have to - night , Miss Craven ! "
130070	130084	130086	130086	Esther	148	" I went out in the wind , and it caught my face , "
130120	130143	130086	130086	Esther	148	" But there was no wind to - day , and I did not think that you had been outside the doors ? "
130144	130164	130086	130086	Esther	148	" Yes , I was ; I went for a run in the park just before dressing - time . "

130174	130205	130206	130206	Constance	256	" It is never quite dark out - of - doors ; total darkness is a human invention , I think ; there is always a sort of owl light . "
130211	130225	130206	130206	Constance	256	" Chacun à son goût , I prefer leaving it to the owls . "
130226	130243	130244	130245	Miss Blessington	258	" It stifles me staying indoors all day ; I have never been used to it . "
130253	130256	130244	130245	Miss Blessington	258	" Really ? "
130257	130262	130244	130245	Miss Blessington	258	" Yes , really . "

130537	130560	130497	130498	Miss Craven	164	" I have not told him you are here ; it will be a surprise to him to meet an old acquaintance . "

130583	130618	130578	130578	she	148	" I ! Oh , I do n't know ; I have the worst memory in the world . I have intended to tell him in every letter , but I have always forgotten . "

130644	130676	130641	130641	her	2797	" I do n't know , I 'm sure ; he is always so full of engagements , and I never allow him to refuse a good invitation on my account . "

130857	130889	130578	130578	she	148	" All men hate all towns , I think , except American men ; ' good Americans when they die go to Paris , ' somebody said , did n't they ? "
130890	130940	130780	130782	the young companion	2798	" Did they ? It was rather irreverent , do n't you think ? By - the - by , some one told me in the summer that you were engaged to be married ; is it true ? I hope you wo n't think me impertinent for asking . "
130941	130953	130578	130578	she	148	" Not in the least ; but it is not true . "
130954	130970	130780	130782	the young companion	2798	" Really ? How odd it is the way those sort of reports get about ! "
130971	130995	130578	130578	she	148	" Very odd ; people are singularly fond of pairing their neighbours , but they do n't often hit upon the right pairs . "

132727	132752	132772	132772	she	148	" Such a wish in your mouth is something like a butcher with his knife at its throat wishing a sheep a long life ! "
132786	132807	132808	132808	he	2803	" Why could not you have sent me word that you were here , and I would have kept away ? "
132816	132829	132830	132830	He	2803	" I asked Miss Blessington to tell you , but she forgot . "

132996	133005	132992	132992	he	2803	" Yes — oh yes — quite kind . "
133006	133015	133016	133016	he	2803	" And what , in God 's name , "
133049	133088	133046	133046	her	5258	" And what , in God 's name , can have induced your friends to allow you to accept such a situation , for which you are about as well fitted as I for the archbishopric of Canterbury ? "
133089	133109	133038	133038	her	5258	" I have not many friends , and I did not ask the advice of the few I have . "
133110	133119	133120	133120	he	2803	" They ought to have given it unasked , "

133202	133232	133195	133195	he	2803	" during the last three months , as I should not have thought it possible to hate anything so weak and tender . I hope I hate you still ! "
133266	133290	133291	133291	he	2803	" The worse case I see you in , the more I ought to rejoice — the more I should have rejoiced yesterday , "
133298	133305	133291	133291	he	2803	" and yet — and yet — "
133346	133351	133352	133352	she	2833	" And yet what ? "
133364	133429	133352	133352	she	2833	" And yet , for the life of me , while I am with you , I can not . When I am away from you , I can remember what you are ; when I am with you , I see only what you seem . Esther ! Esther ! why , in God 's name , do n't the two tally better ? "
133430	133449	133450	133450	she	2833	" Whether they tally or not can be of but little concern to you now , Mr. Gerard , "
133467	133472	133473	133473	he	2803	" You are right , "
133478	133493	133473	133473	he	2803	" It is no concern of mine ; I am sorry I needed reminding . "
133494	133510	133511	133511	she	2833	" Why must we waste time digging that poor old past out of its grave ? "

133554	133584	133511	133511	she	2833	" are so completely bygones , be bygones ? I did you an injury once — not an irreparable one , you will allow , since it is already repaired "
133596	133614	133617	133617	her	2833	" and my whole life since has been a punishment — O God ! what a punishment ! "
133627	133662	133617	133617	her	2833	" I am tired of being punished now . We shall see very little of one another heneforth , but that little might as well be in civility as in inoivility — mightn't it ? "
133663	133664	133673	133673	his	2803	" Civility!"—he

It would be oversweet at first , and bitterer than wormwood afterwards , as our former civility was . No — no ! we will have no sophisms , no absurd Platonisms here ! God forbid my thrusting myself into temptation again ! We will say ' good morning ' and ' good evening ' to one another , as people would remark it if we did not . But for the rest , let us hold our tongues and keep apart ; and as soon as I can do it , without exciting great question , you may rely upon my going ; and then we shall have done with one another for good , I pray God !

134639	134679	134633	134635	the old gentleman	5182	" What do young eyes like yours want with light ? They ought to be able to see in the dark , like cats . You 'll be borrowing Mrs. Blessington 's spectacles next — eh , Mrs. Blessington ? "
134680	134689	134622	134622	she	256	" Mrs. Blessington is asleep , Mr. Blessington . "
134690	134736	134737	134737	Her	256	" Oh ! Go on , then , my dear — go on . Let us hear what they have got to say for these rascally placehunters , who are trying to remove the landmarks of the Constitution for the sake of getting into office . "
134844	134854	134831	134831	She	256	" Had you a good run to - day ? "
134855	134863	134820	134821	Mr. Gerard	247	" Yes , rather a quick thing . "
134864	134871	134820	134821	Mr. Gerard	247	" Which horse did you ride ? "
134872	134898	134831	134831	She	256	" The grey — one you have not seen . I bought her in Ireland of Brownrigg ; he required more of a weight- carrier . "
134899	134908	134820	134821	Mr. Gerard	247	" Does she seem likely to prove satisfactory ? "
134909	134928	134820	134821	Mr. Gerard	247	" Very : she has a good turn of speed , jumps capitally , and is very temperate . "
134929	134936	134831	134831	She	256	" Was it a large field ? "
134937	134940	134820	134821	Mr. Gerard	247	" Middling . "
134941	134947	134820	134821	Mr. Gerard	247	" Any one you knew ? "
134948	134952	134820	134821	Mr. Gerard	247	" Two or three "
134959	134972	134820	134821	Mr. Gerard	247	" You are going out to - morrow again , of course ? "
134996	135075	134820	134821	Mr. Gerard	247	" No , I think not ; it is five - and - twenty miles , and the trains do not fit : one gets lazy in one 's old age . I suppose I shall agree soon with Brakespeare , of the — th , who sent seven horses down to Melton last year ; and at the end of the season confessed that he hated hunting , and that he thought it a very dangerous amusement . "
135076	135079	135081	135081	Constance	256	" Really ? "
135095	135104	135105	135105	he	2876	" No , not really — most assuredly ! "
135111	135146	135105	135105	he	2876	" On the contrary , I am nearer coinciding with the opinion of the Jewish gentleman , who said it would be a very pleasant world if there were no shummers and no shabbaths . "
135275	135298	135272	135272	She	164	" By - the - bye , Conny , how was the lump on your pony 's leg when you left home ? "
135369	135380	135381	135381	he	247	" Will you let me read to you a bit ? "
135404	135412	135414	135416	the old gentleman	5182	" Eh ! what does he say ? "
135436	135457	135414	135416	the old gentleman	5182	" I asked whether you would let me read to you , for a change , instead of Miss Craven ? "
135458	135465	135467	135469	the old man	2484	" No — thanks , no , "
135473	135498	135467	135469	the old man	2484	" Much obliged to you , but I can not hear a word you say ; you run all your words into one another . "
135499	135506	135508	135508	Gerard	258	" Do I ? I daresay , "
135514	135527	135508	135508	Gerard	258	" but have you ever heard me read ? I think not . "
135528	135548	135414	135416	the old gentleman	5182	" Begging your pardon , I have , though ; I heard you read prayers here one Sunday evening . "
135549	135567	135569	135571	the young man	670	" And I am afraid my mode of conducting divine worship has not left a pleasant impression , "
135575	135600	135569	135571	the young man	670	" Well , but I promise to read as slow as ever you choose , and to count four at every full - stop . "
135601	135606	135608	135610	the old man	2484	" No — no , "
135614	135671	135608	135610	the old man	2484	" Get away with you , my dear boy ! you are interrupting us . No offence , but we are very happy without you — aren't we , Miss Esther ? You attend to your own business ; we do n't offer to help you in that — do we — eh , my dear ? "
135747	135756	135762	135762	herself	258	" What a churchyard cough that girl has ! "
135772	135809	135762	135762	herself	258	" it really quite fidgets one . Of course it is very unjust of one , but I always feel so angry with a person who goes ' cough , cough , cough ' every minute . "
135810	135824	135826	135826	Gerard	258	" I feel angrier with the person who is the cause of it , "
135831	135862	135826	135826	Gerard	258	" it is positive barbarity . You see what success I met with when I tried to relieve guard . Suppose you offer : you can always make him hear ! "
135863	135869	135871	135871	Conny	256	" I should be delighted , "

135902	135910	135871	135871	Conny	256	" that I really should be afraid . "
135911	135921	135923	135923	he	2484	" Just try — there 's a good girl , "
135927	135942	135923	135923	he	2484	" you can stop in a minute if you find that it hurts you . "
135965	136001	135871	135871	Conny	256	" I am very sorry I can not oblige you ; but as I am to dine out on Thursday , and one is always expected to sing , I really must nurse my voice . "
136544	136661	136537	136537	Shylock	476	" Am not I ' fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons , subject to the same diseases , healed by the same means , warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer ? ' Why , then , are they frisking about in purple and fine linen upon the ice , with half - a - dozen young patricians ( in trousers of surprising tightness and coats of unequalled brevity ) in their train , while I am perched here upon the all - alone stone , among these stiff cold sedges , with only the Canada geese , with their long necks craned out , screeching above my head ? "
136680	136686	136688	136689	Lord Linley	474	" I say , Gerard , "

136784	136794	136795	136795	he	2921	" Her name is Miss Craven , I believe , "
136800	136811	136813	136815	a second man	2923	" Uncommon good - looking girl , whoever she is ! "
136826	136851	136813	136815	a second man	2923	" I have been perilling my life among those d — d rushes by the edge , to get a good look at her ! "
136852	136857	136864	136864	his	2924	" Deuced good legs ! "
136902	136917	136919	136921	a " Heavy	5495	" She is vewy like a girl I used to know at the Cape , "
136920	136923	136919	136921	a " Heavy	5495	" Heavy , "
136935	136961	136919	136921	a " Heavy	5495	" The Fly we used to call her , because when she settled on a f'la , it was mowally impossible to dwive her off . "
137026	137032	137020	137020	Linley	474	" I say , Gerard!—Gerard ! "
137033	137036	137020	137020	Linley	474	" Well ? "
137037	137043	137020	137020	Linley	474	" Do you know her ? "
137044	137047	137020	137020	Linley	474	" Slightly . "
137048	137060	137020	137020	Linley	474	" Introduce me , then — there 's a good fellow ! "
137061	137065	137020	137020	Linley	474	" And me ! "
137066	137070	137020	137020	Linley	474	" And me ! "
137071	137090	137092	137092	Gerard	258	" My acquaintance with Miss Craven is not such as to justify my introducing any one to her , "
137102	137106	137108	137108	Linley	474	" Sly dog ! "
137112	137130	137108	137108	Linley	474	" means to keep her all to himself — a nice quiet little game of his own . "
137131	137141	137143	137145	the laconic youth	2927	" Means to drive a pair then — eh ? "
137147	137152	137154	137156	the " Heavy	5499	" Vewy seldom pays , "
137155	137158	137108	137108	Linley	474	" Heavy , "
137161	137168	137108	137108	Linley	474	" one or other invawiably jibs . "
137207	137215	137216	137216	he	480	" Do you know , Miss Blessington , "
137238	137274	137216	137216	he	480	" I have actually been putting the same question to twenty people running , and never yet succeeded in getting an answer ? You are my last hope : who is that lady in black ? "
137275	137281	137283	137283	Constance	256	" The lady in black ! "
137301	137304	137216	137216	he	480	" Oh ! "
137314	137329	137216	137216	he	480	" nobody very particular ; only poor Miss Craven , my aunt 's companion ! "
137330	137334	137335	137335	he	480	" Poor girl ! "
137400	137469	137395	137395	she	2930	" It must be very slow for her , must n't it ? I always hate looking on — don't you ? I always like to have a hand in everything , whatever it may be ; it would really be a charity to go and speak to her , only I 'm afraid she would take it as an insult if I went up and introduced myself . "
137470	137481	137483	137483	Constance	256	" I assure you she is quite happy watching us , "
137526	137546	137547	137547	he	2936	" Do n't you think that a little improving conversation with me would tend to make her happier still ? "
137556	137601	137547	137547	he	2936	" I tried to get Gerard to introduce me , but I could not make out exactly what was up ; he seemed to take it as a personal insult . You wo n't mind doing me that good turn , I 'm sure ? "
137602	137612	137613	137613	she	256	" I shall be most happy , of course , "
137672	137685	137662	137662	her	256	" Miss Craven , Mr. Linley wishes to be introduced to you . "
137686	137690	137691	137691	she	256	" To me ! "
137770	137779	137781	137787	the man to whom Esther 's legs	2940	" Linley has succeeded , do you see ? "
137794	137798	137781	137787	the man to whom Esther 's legs	2940	" very good . "
137799	137811	137781	137787	the man to whom Esther 's legs	2940	" Mostly does ; it is a little way he has ! "
137812	137820	137781	137787	the man to whom Esther 's legs	2940	" Who did they say she was ? "
137821	137833	137781	137787	the man to whom Esther 's legs	2940	" Somebody 's companion ; old Blessington 's , I think . "
137834	137856	137781	137787	the man to whom Esther 's legs	2940	" Cunning old beggar ! He knows what he is about , though he does pretend to be stone - blind . "
137857	137874	137781	137787	the man to whom Esther 's legs	2940	" Old Blessington 's companion , eh ? I 'm sure I wish she were mine . "
137875	137888	137781	137787	the man to whom Esther 's legs	2940	" A sort of ' Abishag the Shunammite , ' I suppose ? "
138121	138126	138127	138127	they	2947	" Whirr ! whirr ! "
138364	138373	138375	138375	Linley	480	" There 's no wind to - day , "
138394	138445	138375	138375	Linley	480	" when there is , it is the best fun in the world to get a very light cane chair and a big umbrella — to sit on the one and hold the other up ; you can have no conception of the terrific rate that one gets along at . "
138446	138470	138472	138472	Esther	148	" I should think it sometimes happened that the cane chair and the big umbrella went on by themselves and left you behind ? "
138475	138487	138472	138472	Esther	148	" Frequently , but that makes it all the more exciting . "
138488	138492	138375	138375	Linley	480	" Does it ? "
138493	138517	138525	138525	his	480	" Keep hold of the chair , push it gently before you , and try to balance yourself as well as you can , "
138529	138544	138545	138545	she	2960	" How can one balance oneself on things no bigger than knife - blades ? "
138555	138564	138565	138565	he	480	" Rome was not built in a day , "
138573	138576	138565	138565	he	480	" try ! "
138593	138607	138608	138608	she	2960	" I have that poor gentleman 's fate before my mind 's eye , "
138613	138644	138608	138608	she	2960	" I feel as if , by some natural attraction , one 's feet must go up sky - wards , and one 's head make acquaintance with the ice . "
138645	138651	138653	138655	the young man	670	" No necessity at all , "
138659	138689	138653	138655	the young man	670	" That fellow is a duffer at everything ; he is the very worst rider I ever set eyes on - holds his whip like a fishing - rod . "
138690	138694	138608	138608	she	2960	" Does he ? "
138695	138744	138748	138748	he	670	" Look at that girl , now , with the purple feather ! She skims along like a bird ; she is as much at her ease as if she were in her arm - chair at home . By Jove ! no , she ai n't though ! "
138751	138754	138748	138748	he	670	" Thud ! "
138788	138802	138803	138803	Esther	148	" You must be more careful next time in your selection of examples , "
138809	138820	138803	138803	Esther	148	" that one was not encouraging , you must allow . "
138871	138886	138887	138887	he	670	" Perhaps you 'd get on better if you tried walking between two people , "
138892	138942	138887	138887	he	670	" it is easier than with a chair . That is the way my sister began — I on one side , do n't you know , and another fellow on the other . Here , Gerard , come and make yourself useful ; give Miss Craven your arm ! "
139037	139045	139046	139046	he	670	" She would flirt in her coffin , "
139059	139070	139046	139046	he	670	" I cannot — I have taken my skates off ! "
139071	139075	139077	139078	Mr. Linley	480	" All right , "
139091	139097	139077	139078	Mr. Linley	480	" On duty , evidently ! "
139098	139101	139102	139102	She	148	" Evidently ! "
139118	139128	139129	139129	she	148	" He need not have slighted me so openly , "
139136	139152	139153	139153	she	148	" Perhaps if you gave me your hand I might manage to steady myself gradually , "
139465	139470	139471	139471	he	480	" I hate her ! "
139478	139528	139471	139471	he	480	" she is a vile unprincipled coquette . Thank God , I found her out in time ! Thank God , I washed my hands of her before it was too late ! And yet — and yet — if I could but pick a quarrel with that fellow ! "
139643	139649	139655	139655	he	2980	" She is extwemely dark , "
139661	139679	139655	139655	he	2980	" a thowough bwunette ; must have a touch of the tar - bwush , I fancy ! "
139701	139705	139706	139706	she	148	" I must go "
139711	139717	139706	139706	she	148	" I shall be wanted . "
139718	139721	139722	139722	he	2980	" Wanted ? "
139727	139749	139722	139722	he	2980	" And are not you wanted here I You can not be in two places at once , like a bird . "
139750	139762	139763	139763	she	148	" Mrs. Blessington will want me — I am her companion , "
139769	139778	139763	139763	she	148	" I daresay you did not know it . "
139780	139797	139763	139763	she	148	" He would not have been so civil to me if he had , I daresay , "
139804	139810	139763	139763	she	148	" Yes , I did . "
139811	139832	139763	139763	she	148	" Who told you?—or have all ' companions ' such a family likeness that you detected me at a glance ? "
139833	139854	139855	139855	he	2981	" Miss Blessington told me ; and for the first time in my life I wished myself an old woman , "
139921	139927	139929	139931	the young man	670	" If the frost holds , "

140043	140052	140053	140053	she	148	" To - day has been very pleasant , "
140058	140069	140053	140053	she	148	" but I can not answer for to - morrow . "
140070	140076	140077	140077	he	2981	" Are you so changeable , "
140101	140118	140077	140077	he	2981	" as not to know to - day what you will like or not like tomorrow ? "
140119	140127	140128	140128	she	148	" I know what I shall like , "
140133	140169	140128	140128	she	148	" but I do n't know what other people will . Would not you think it very odd if your valet were to make engagements without consulting you ? I am Mrs. Blessington 's valet . "
140218	140225	140199	140199	she	148	" Very clean about the fetlock ! "
140253	140274	140199	140199	she	148	" Yes , but what howible boots ! Whoever could have had the atwocity to fwame such beetle - cwushers ? "

140369	140380	140362	140362	he	2981	" I must try and make the best of her . "
140489	140503	140476	140482	this unsuggestive , unresponsive , negative woman	2990	" It is her misfortune that she is not a woman of science , "
140513	140521	140505	140506	Mr. Shandy	485	" but she might ask a question . "
140762	140772	140773	140773	he	2981	" Why do n't we cut off the entail ? "
140806	140862	140864	140864	he	2981	" You and I together can do it , can not we , Sir Thomas , and leave the property to the Foundling , or Hanwell , or to some hospital or penitentiary , where it would do a deal more good , I do n't doubt , than it ever has in our hands ? "
140895	140903	140905	140906	his parent	2176	" It 's all your cursed selfishness , "
140945	141008	141010	141011	Sir Thomas	238	" You prefer your lazy , lounging club life , your French chef , and d — d sybarite habits , to everything else under heaven ; you do n't reflect that , when a man has been given such advantages as yours , he owes corresponding duties to his country and his estate , and — and — and his father — "
141033	141046	141047	141047	he	238	" If you like to look out for a wife for me , "
141069	141125	141047	141047	he	238	" and will engage to undertake all the bore of the preliminaries — love - making , dancing attendance , etc.—I have no objection to marrying , since the duty of continuing this illustrious race has been perverse enough to devolve on me , who , God knows , am not ambitious of perpetuating myself . "
141126	141134	141136	141137	Sir Thomas	238	" Love - making ! — pooh ! "
141141	141174	141136	141137	Sir Thomas	238	" we need have none of that rubbish ; respect and esteem are a deal the best basis to go upon ; that 's what your mother and I began life with — "
141175	141186	141188	141189	St. John	164	" And have continued undiminished up to the present day , "
141196	141198	141188	141189	St. John	164	" Well "
141203	141289	141188	141189	St. John	164	" if you can find , amongst the wide range of your acquaintance , any young lady who is willing io respect and esteem me — which is not likely — or to respect and esteem Felton — which is more probable , and , after all , comes to much the same in the end — she may have the felicity of being your daughter - in - law , for all I shall do to hinder it : anything for a quiet life . "
141389	141396	141397	141397	he	238	" If you are in earnest , "
141402	141442	141397	141397	he	238	" and not making a jest of this , as you mostly do of every serious subject , why — why — there 's no use in going far afield for what one has ready to one 's hand . "
141443	141446	141448	141449	St. John	164	" Where ? "

141526	141578	141491	141492	Sir Thomas	238	" God bless my soul , sir ! where are your wits to - day ? How can you do better than Conny ? That bit of land of hers down at Four Oaks dovetails into ours as neatly as possible ; it seems as if it were intended by Providence , "
141594	141597	141598	141598	he	238	" Conny ! "
141605	141630	141598	141598	he	238	" I should as soon have thought of marrying my mother . Why , we have been like brother and sister all our lives . "
141631	141634	141636	141637	Sir Thomas	238	" Fiddlesticks ! "
141641	141690	141636	141637	Sir Thomas	238	" She is no more your sister than I am . When I was young , if people were born brothers and sisters they called themselves so , and if they were not they did not . I hate your adopted brother and sister and father and motherhoods . "
141691	141694	141696	141697	St. John	164	" Conny ! "
141846	141849	141851	141852	Sir Thomas	238	" Well ? "
141871	141901	141903	141905	the young man	670	" If she have no objection , neither have I ; ' one woman is as good as another , if not better , ' as the Irishman said , "
141909	141915	141903	141905	the young man	670	" Well , Sir Thomas , "
141922	141968	141903	141905	the young man	670	" I suppose I may go now , may n't I ? I promised Bellew to go down to the kennels with him , and as it is past twelve o'clock , I 'm afraid my bliss can not well be consummated to - day . "
141986	142012	142013	142013	he	238	" She is good to look at , and she does not pretend to care two straws about me — both causes for special thankfulness , "
142033	142099	142013	142013	he	238	" ' On this day two years I married : Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth . ' Will Byron 's summary of wedded felicity be mine also ? Probably . I suppose one may think oneself tolerably lucky nowadays if one steer clear of Sir James Wilde , and if one 's children do not bear a very striking resemblance to one 's neighbour . "

142713	142761	142693	142693	Linley	480	" Could not imagine who you were . I thought , perhaps , you were the spirit of a departed Blessington , and as I am rather nervous , and frightened out of my wits at ghosts , I had half a mind to turn and flee . "
142762	142771	142772	142772	she	148	" Only curiosity got the better of fear , "
142792	142803	142772	142772	she	148	" you thought I might prove human , after all ? "
142804	142824	142825	142825	he	480	" Why did not you come and see me the other day when I came to call upon you ? "
142833	142844	142825	142825	he	480	" I believe you were at home all the time . "
142895	142902	142903	142903	he	480	" Were you really at home ? "
142927	142933	142903	142903	he	480	" Yes , I was . "
142934	142944	142903	142903	he	480	" And knew I was there all the time ? "
142945	142948	142903	142903	he	480	" Yes . "
142949	142957	142903	142903	he	480	" A prey to Mrs. Blessington — ? "
142958	142961	142903	142903	he	480	" Yes . "
142962	142970	142903	142903	he	480	" And never came to my rescue ? "
142971	142985	142986	142986	she	148	" Did you expect the butler and housekeeper to come and entertain you ? "
142993	143028	142986	142986	she	148	" Have you forgotten what I told you the other day — that I am Mrs. Blessington 's valet ? I have as little concern with her visitors as the kitchen - maids have . "
143029	143037	143039	143041	the young fellow	695	" But I was not her visitor , "
143043	143045	143039	143041	the young fellow	695	stoutly—"at least "
143049	143108	142986	142986	she	148	" I was , but Heaven knows I did not mean to be ! However , ' God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb , ' and I obtained a great deal of information gratis upon a subject on which I really never had reflected as seriously as , it appears , I ought to have done — "
143109	143123	143125	143125	Esther	148	" Draughts and sandbags ! I know what you are going to say , "
143134	143205	143125	143125	Esther	148	" We do hear a great deal about them ; but I do n't mind now ; I 'm used to it . I fall into a sort of waking trance when the subject is first broached , and say ' Yes ' and ' No , ' and ' H'm ' and ' Oh , ' at stated intervals ; it does just as well as listening all through . "
143232	143238	143239	143239	he	480	" Not a bad plan , "
143244	143316	143239	143239	he	480	" but , really now , I flattered myself I struck out one or two very original thoughts on the subject of sash - windows ; I said several rather brilliant things , only she did not seem to see them . I hoped she would have found my conversation so improving that she would have asked me to come again ; but she did not do anything of the kind . "
143317	143325	143327	143327	Esther	148	" They never ask anybody to Blessington , "
143374	143430	143239	143239	he	480	" They are too old to care for society ; like Barzillai the Gileadite , they can not hear any more ' the voice of singing men and singing women . ' They have the clergyman and his wife to dine on Christmas Day , and there their gaiety for the year begins and ends . "
143431	143436	143499	143499	his	480	" And yours too ? "
143437	143450	143451	143451	she	148	" And mine too . But I do n't wish for gaiety , "
143477	143493	143495	143495	Linley	480	" It must be an awful fate being shut up with those two old mummies , "
143517	143535	143511	143512	Mrs. Blessington	437	" I had rather live in a lighthouse , or sweep a crossing , by long odds . "
143536	143541	143542	143542	she	148	" So would I , "
143547	143563	143542	143542	she	148	" if any one would set on foot a subscription to buy me a broom . "
143564	143578	143580	143580	he	480	" You have Miss Blessington now as a companion , at all events , "
143600	143610	143580	143580	he	480	" Yes ; she is pleasant to look at . "
143611	143617	143542	143542	she	148	" And to talk to . "
143618	143623	143542	143542	she	148	" She never talks . "
143624	143639	143580	143580	he	480	" And Gerard ? He is not particularly pleasant to look at , certainly — "
143640	143644	143645	143645	she	148	" Not particularly , "
143664	143696	143645	143645	she	148	" But when he is not in one of his sulks , as he was the other day — do you remember?—he is not a bad fellow , as fellows go . "
143697	143702	143703	143703	He	480	" Is n't he ? "
143710	143737	143703	143703	He	480	" Why , surely , living in the same house with him , you ought to know him , at least as well as I do ? "
143738	143752	143753	143753	she	148	" I never speak to him , and he never speaks to me , "
143763	143783	143758	143758	Linley	480	" Good heavens ! what a horrible picture you draw ! You remind one of Mr. Watts 's pretty little hymn—"'Where'er
143805	143822	143794	143794	I	0	" Esther laughs ; but anyone listening might have heard a melancholy ring in her merriment . "
143851	143874	143846	143847	his companion	1252	" Mr. Blessington roars at Mrs. Blessington , and Mrs. Blessington roars at Mr. Blessington , and I roar at them both . "
143875	143886	143794	143794	I	0	" And the other two — do not they speak ? "
143887	143900	143901	143901	she	1252	" We are , none of us , much addicted to conversation , "
143906	143921	143901	143901	she	1252	" but , en revanche , what we do say we say very loud . "
143922	143930	143794	143794	I	0	" Are you all deaf , then ? "
143931	143963	143794	143794	I	0	" No ; but when one lives with deaf people , one gets into the habit of thinking that the whole world is hard of hearing ; one bawls at everyone . "
143964	143970	143971	143971	he	1252	" What an exhausting process ! "
143978	143991	143971	143971	he	1252	" takes a great deal out of you , does n't it ? "
143992	144045	143794	143794	I	0	" A good deal ; lately , I have generally ended the day without any voice at all . I do n't mind making short remarks at the top of my voice , but shouting out six columns of the Times , as is daily my pleasing task , is rather fatiguing . "
144046	144055	144056	144056	he	1252	" How inhuman of them to allow you ! "
144098	144103	144104	144104	she	3056	" Not at all , "
144109	144116	144104	144104	she	3056	" they pay me for it . "
144117	144172	144174	144176	the young man	670	" It would require very high pay to indemnify any one for the sacrifice of the best years of their lives to those two old fossils ; I thought I was entitled to something considerable for standing the old woman for three - quarters of an hour the other day without uttering a groan , "
144190	144199	144200	144200	she	3056	" My pay is fifty pounds a year , "
144205	144212	144200	144200	she	3056	" if you call that high . "
144357	144363	144364	144364	he	1252	" Fifty pounds!—what a pittance ! "
144367	144373	144374	144374	she	3056	" Do you think so ? "
144379	144421	144374	144374	she	3056	" I think it is a good deal . Considering that they find me in food and lodging , and that I do for them only what any charity- school boy could do nearly as well , it is surely enough . "
144432	144442	144462	144462	he	1252	" When ignorance is bliss'Tis folly to be wise ; "
144476	144487	144469	144469	his	1252	" Have you no amusement of any kind — none ? "
144488	144511	144462	144462	he	1252	" Oh dear , yes ! We drive into Shelford every day in a close carriage , with all the windows up . "
144512	144525	144462	144462	he	1252	" Terrific ! And what do you do when you get there ? "
144526	144532	144462	144462	he	1252	" We come back again . "
144533	144548	144462	144462	he	1252	" And have you no visitors ? Does no one ever come to call ? "
144549	144558	144462	144462	he	1252	" Yes ; you came the other day . "
144559	144572	144462	144462	he	1252	" And am I a solitary instance of would - be sociability ? "
144573	144629	144462	144462	he	1252	" Not quite . Mr. Blessington gets into a panic about himself , sometimes , and thinks that he is drawing near his latter end ; and he bids us all good - bye ; and he cries , and we cry , and then Mr. Brand , the doctor , comes and reassures us . "
144630	144646	144462	144462	he	1252	" I had no idea that there was anything the matter with the old gentleman . "
144647	144705	144706	144706	she	3061	" No more there is . He has no more idea of dying really than you have ; less , probably . You may break your neck out hunting , and he can not well break his out of his armchair . When a person has got into such a confirmed habit of living as he has , "
144711	144723	144706	144706	she	3061	" they find it extremely difficult to break themselves of it . "
144727	144731	144732	144732	she	3061	" After all , "
144737	144781	144732	144732	she	3061	" since it is wear - and - tear of mind , brain and heart - work , that drives people to the churchyard , I do n't see any reason why mere sleeping and eating machines should not go on for ever . "
145016	145180	145194	145194	he	480	" It was an assignation ! She arranged it with him on the day he came to call . Damnable flirt ! Is not she satisfied with two ruined lives ? Is she fool enough to think that Linley will marry her ? A nice time of night for a respectable young woman to be out walking with a man she has only seen twice in her life ! And I heard her tell Mrs. Blessington the other day that she never went outside the park - gates ! Liar ! What man was ever deep enough to be up to a Woman 's tricks ? She 'll go to the dogs , as sure as fate , if she is left to herself ! Pshaw ! I daresay she knows the way there already . She is so young ; shall I warn her ? Shall I speak to her ? Not I. Thank God , it is no business of mine ! "
145181	145184	145186	145186	Linley	480	" Gerard ! "
145220	145241	145194	145194	he	480	" Certainly being in love do n't improve him ; he is not half the fellow he was last season . "
145271	145286	145287	145287	she	148	" I 'm afraid Mr. Gerard thought it odd my being out so late , "
145301	145309	145311	145311	Linley	480	" Well , and if he did ? "
145315	145321	145322	145322	she	148	" It is very late , "
145331	145353	145322	145322	she	148	" it must be , by the light . I never noticed how dark it has grown since you overtook me . "
145354	145367	145368	145368	he	480	" It is no darker than it was before Gerard passed us , "
145374	145379	145322	145322	she	148	" No , but — "
145380	145388	145389	145389	he	480	" Why , how scared you look ! "
145393	145406	145389	145389	he	480	" You do n't mean to say you are afraid of him ? "
145411	145448	145449	145449	She	148	" If I were you , I do n't think I should pay much deference to the opinion of a person who , as you say , never has the civility even to speak to you . "
145453	145468	145470	145472	the young man	670	" It is the authority of his eye that awes you , I suppose ? "
145479	145493	145470	145472	the young man	670	" ' An eye like Mars ' , to threaten and command . ' "
145504	145522	145470	145472	the young man	670	" Hearing his words , Esther recovers her self - possession , and speaks with some dignity : "
145581	145582	145572	145572	I	0	" "
145589	145603	145572	145572	I	0	" says the young man , with the air of an aggrieved person . "
145620	145621	145572	145572	I	0	" "
145629	145641	145572	145572	I	0	" says Esther , evidently in a hurry to be off ; "
145676	145677	145572	145572	I	0	" "
145682	145688	145572	145572	I	0	" he says , reluctantly . "
145765	145766	145762	145762	I	0	" "
145774	145905	145762	145762	I	0	" answers Esther , hastily and contradictorily , running up the gamut of adverbs in search of the one most likely to obtain her release . Having gained that object , she jumps over the stile , and disappears into a sea of mist . Meanwhile St. John , having arrived at Blessington , and given up his horse to a groom , enters the house ; but the confinement of roof and walls is insupportable to him . So he goes out again , and , walking up the avenue , stations himself at the gate . There , resting his arms on the topmost bar , he stands , straining his eyes down the road by which he expects to see Esther and her companion make their appearance . "
145921	145932	145906	145906	They	3084	" he says to himself , in his lonely pain . "
145935	145958	145906	145906	They	3084	" taking out his watch and minuting them , in order to drink the cup of his jealous misery to the dregs , "
145996	146019	146020	146020	Linley	480	" He has not long to wait . Before five minutes are over he hears the sound of a horse 's feet . "
146028	146136	146020	146020	Linley	480	" he thinks , with a sort of shame at himself , and so steps back into the shade of a great tree . Linley rides by alone . His face is turned towards the house , in whose great black facade the lighted windows make oblong - shaped red glories ; his eyes are trying to fix upon Esther 's casement . Of course he hits upon the wrong one , and directs his sentimental gaze towards the apartment where , with wig off and teeth out , Mrs. Blessington , aided by her maid , is slowly moving through the stages of her dinner toilette . "
146149	146160	146137	146137	She	3087	" thinks Gerard , with a sense of unwilling relief . "
146173	146423	146170	146170	I	0	" He retraces his steps down the avenue , and , following a back road that skirts the kitchen - garden , reaches another gate that leads into the park , and there stands and waits again . The short - cut has proved rather a long one . Part of the park has been fenced off , to keep the deer and the Scotch cattle separate ; a gate which she had reckoned upon finding open , she discovers to be padlocked , and has to make a long circuit round to another gate . As she toils weary - footed through the wet grass , vague alarms assail him that watches for her . Can any evil have come to her in the darkness ? Most improbably in that still , safe park . After a while , and when his reasonless fears are beginning to gather more strongly about his heart , he hears the sound as of some one running pantingly . Esther is not so good at running as she was in the old Glan - yr - Afon days . She has been flying along in hot haste , with a mixed fear of Scotch bulls and goblins in pursuit . As she approaches the gate , Gerard opens it for her . Seeing it swing open without any apparent cause , she gives a great nervous start ; then , discovering the motive cause of the phenomenon , drops into a walk . "
146441	146513	146429	146430	Mr. Gerard	247	" she asks , with some hesitation at this disobedience to his command of silence . And yet , surely , if he had meant not to speak to her , he would not have come thither . Two speech - gifted human beings could hardly be expected to meet with less civility than two pigs , who would at least exchange a grunt . He looks at his watch again . "
146521	146528	146429	146430	Mr. Gerard	247	" he replies with punctilious politeness . "
146542	146548	146533	146533	I	0	" she says , apologetically , "
146560	146572	146550	146550	your	247	" The line of defence she has hit upon is unlucky . "
146575	146581	146550	146550	your	247	" he answers , stiffly . "
146598	146612	146582	146582	I	0	" she continues , innocently , floundering at every word into deeper disgrace . "
146617	146654	146582	146582	I	0	" he replies , freezingly . She had addressed him , penitent and humble , willing to take a scolding in all submissiveness , but the chill brevity of his answers turns her meekness to gall . "
146662	146672	146673	146673	one	559	" she remarks , with a rather hysterical laugh , "
146680	146681	146673	146673	one	559	" "
146684	146711	146673	146673	one	559	" replies Gerard , endeavouring to conceal his anger under an appearance of calmness , and unable to manage more than one word at a time . "
146743	146751	146734	146741	a person who is neither deaf nor dumb	3092	" she says , emboldened by exasperation . "
146759	146767	146734	146741	a person who is neither deaf nor dumb	3092	" he answers , in deep displeasure . "
146777	146788	146734	146741	a person who is neither deaf nor dumb	3092	" he continues , unable to resist the temptation to lecture her—"who
146839	146840	146845	146845	choosers	3094	" "
146847	146853	146854	146854	You	0	" she answers , sulkily . "
146873	146892	146893	146893	I	0	" He draws himself up to his full height , and a stern expression makes his lip thin . "
146897	146902	146893	146893	I	0	" he says internally ; "
146908	146912	146913	146913	I	0	" Then aloud : "
146971	146972	146973	146973	I	0	" "
146980	146986	146973	146973	I	0	" retorts she , defiantly ; "
147021	147209	147004	147004	he	480	" Then , to avoid the disgrace of seeming to court his compassion by tears , she darts from his side , and rushes to that harbour of refuge — her great , bare sleeping - chamber . TIME goes by . Since Joshua , God - bidden , commanded sun and moon to stand still , who has been able to stop it ? Gerard still remains at Blessington — remains , despite the six - o'clock dinners ; despite the inarticulate and inharmonious mumblings with which old Blessington takes away the appetites of such as feast with him ; despite the utter failure of his endeavours to draw from the mind of his betrothed any ideas but such as Le Follet and Le Journal des Demoiselles had just put into it . Latterly he has abandoned the attempt , has taken to reading the Times , Field , anything in the evening , instead ; has even , in his despair — modern works of fiction being , as I have before observed , unknown at Blessington — waded through two chapters and a half of "
147212	147241	147004	147004	he	480	" which Esther had inadvertently left on the table . Sometimes , to his own surprise , he catches himself wishing that his wedding - day were over . "
147255	147259	147247	147247	we	3099	" he reflects . "
147368	147385	147386	147386	You	3104	" Now and again conscience 's voice thunders at him in the recesses of his soul : "
147394	147411	147442	147442	her	3101	" But he , strong in the innocence of his acts and words , replies doughtily : "
147480	148170	147470	147470	her	3106	" And , in the meantime , that other woman droops like an unwatered flower , day by day . When the mainspring of a watch is broken , must it not stop ? If hope , the mainspring of life , be broken , must not life stop — not all at once , as the watch does , but by gentle yet sure degrees ? A slow fire burns in the child 's veins ; before this man had come , she had peace — a sad stagnant peace , indeed , but still peace . Now she lives in a state of perpetual concealed excitement . True , they meet but rarely , speak to each other never ; but the same roof covers them both . From her outlook in the China Gallery , she can watch his going forth in the morning , his coming back at evening . At breakfast and dinner he sits opposite to her ; she can study his face , with stealthy care , lest she may be observed , while he drives heavily through slow trite talk with her that fills the place in his life that , for a golden day , from one sundown to another , was Esther 's . Sometimes they meet upon the stairs ; her black dress lightly touches him , as they pass one another dumbly . At night she lies awake , waiting to catch the sound of his footfall in the gallery past her door ; has to wait long hours often ; for he , unknowing that any one takes note of his vigils , sits in the smoking - room far into the small hours , puffing out of his well - coloured meerschaum great volumes of smoke — wishing , not seldom , I think , that he could puff away Constance , his beloved , into smoke volumes and thin air . Fed by no kindly words , nourished only upon neglect and cold looks , Esther 's love for Gerard yet strikes out great roots downwards — shoots forth strong branches upwards . A tree of far statelier growth it stands than in the days when the soft gales and gentle streams of answering love fanned and watered it . Who cares for what they can have ? Who cries for the moon ? It is the intermediate something — the something that lies just a handbreadth beyond the utmost stretch of our most painfully - strained arms , that we eat out our hearts in longing for . Esther never goes beyond the park palings now , deterred by the fear of being waylaid by Linley . She need not have been alarmed . As long as she came naturally in his way , he was delighted to see her : as we stoop and pick gladly the fruit that drops off the tree at our feet . He had even , on a day when the frost forbade hunting , and when he had got tired of skating , taken the unwonted trouble of riding over to Blessington , to warm himself at the fire of those great black eyes , that have still for him the charm of novelty upon them ; but women , many and fair , came too readily to his hand to make him very keen in the chase of any one individual woman . In former generations men used to be the pursuers , women the pursued . In this generation we , who have set right most things , have set right this also . Now , the hares pursue the harriers , the foxes the hounds , and the doves swoop upon the falcons . During these latter evenings Mr. Blessington has been very alert and wakeful — has insisted on being read to from tea to bed - time — a liberal hour . But , however hoarse and voiceless the young reader may be , Gerard never now comes to the rescue , never interferes , though the frequent teasing cough of the "
148173	148282	148874	148875	The Lord	2038	" goes through his heart like a sword . With steady certainty , through frost and thaw , rain and shine , through all the alternations of an English winter , the young girl 's health declines . To all but herself is this fact evident , and she , unaccustomed to illness — never having seen the signs of premature decay in others — thinks it is but a little weariness , a little languor , a nothing . It will pass when the swooned world revives into spring and the buttercups come . Sunday is here again , the initial letter in the week 's alphabet : "
148308	148425	149097	149097	Lord	2394	" Ah me ! the languid , yawning Sundays of most of us will make but sorry bracelets for any one , methinks . Sunday — the day on which the Shelford shopboys and shopgirls walk about gloriously apparelled , arm - in - arm , man and maid , filling their lungs with country air,—day on which the gentlefolks , such as are men of them , debarred from horse and hound and cue , smoke a cigar or two more than usual over the instructive pages of Messieurs De Kock , Sue , Balzac , & c. ; while such as are women , being for the most part piously disposed , hold Goulburn 's "
148431	148435	149097	149097	Lord	2394	" or Hannay 's "
148444	148846	148849	148849	thy	3110	" open on their velvet laps , and kill a reputation between each paragraph . On this especial Sunday Esther has risen , feeling feebler , more nerveless than usual . Something in the influence of the weather — soft , sodden , sunless — weighs upon her with untold oppression . She would fain not go to church , remain at home , and lie on her bed ; but this can not be . Foremost in importance , in indispensability , among her duties are these Sunday ones . If the weather be tolerable , Mr. Blessington is always scrupulously punctual in attending Divine worship . Leaning on his valet 's arm , he totters up the church , in his old tail - coat , tightly buttoned over his sunken chest , and , arrived at the Blessington pew , is deposited in a little nook thereof , partitioned ( in some quirk of his , while he could yet see ) from the rest . In thia nook there is room for two people — to wit , for Mr. Blessington , and for the happy person who is to guide his devotions . And to conduct Mr. Blessington 's prayers and praises is , I assure you , no sinecure . Almost entirely deaf , almost entirely blind , he is yet resolute to take a part in the services by no means less prominent than the clerk 's . It is , therefore , his attendant 's duty to shout the responses in his ear , in order to give him some clue to the portion of the ritual which has been arrived at and to check him with elbowings and nudgings , when his aberrations from the right path become so flagrantly noticeable as to distract the attention of the other worshippers . But too often , however , the attempts at repression on the part of the acolyte are so much labour lost . In the region of darkness and silence in which his infirmities have placed him , the old man frequently becomes impatient of the slow progress of the service as notified to him by the roars of his companion . Not seldom he proclaims , in a voice distinctly audible throughout the building , the point at which , according to his reckoning , priest and people should have arrived . "
148852	148873	148849	148849	thy	3110	" cries the squire , with unction in his deep , tremulous bass , while the sleek young rector 's gentle "
148879	149082	148874	148875	The Lord	2038	" does not follow till five minutes later . In the Creed there is but one course to pursue : to start him , if possible , fair — happy , indeed , if he does not insist on turning to the altar somewhere towards the close of the second lesson or beginning of the Jubilate,—to start him fair , I say . and then in despair , give him his head . Fervently , loudly , rapidly , he announces his belief in the articles of the Christian faith , while parson , clerk , and congregation toil after him in vain . Occasionally — especially at such portions of the service as refer to our need of forgiveness , our sinfulness , our mortality,—he breaks out into senile tears ; too deaf to hear his own penitent sobs , he has no idea of the loudness with which they reverberate through the church . Strangers , hearing , perk their heads up above their pews , and then fling them down again on their pocket - handkerchiefs convulsed with inextinguishable laughter ; but the greater part of the assemblage are used to these spasms of grotesque devotion — it is only "
149086	149096	148874	148875	The Lord	2038	" Esther always draws a long breath of relief when "
149114	149134	149097	149097	Lord	2394	" has been safely tided over without any unusually noisy burst of lamentation . On the Sunday I speak of "
149138	149289	149097	149097	Lord	2394	" prayers were more unruly than usual . Whether it was that Esther 's weakened voice was unable to guide them into the right channel , or to whatever other cause assignable , certain it is that his vagaries were more painfully evident — ludicrously to the congregation , distressingly to his family — than on any former Sunday within the memory of man . Many heads turn towards the Blessington pew ; even the rector — meekest among M.A.s — looks now and again with gentle reproach at the old man , who is , with such aggressive loudness , usurping his office of leading the devotions of his flock . A proud woman is Esther Craven when the Liturgy comes to a close . In the sermon there are , thank God , no responses for the congregation to make ; it is not even customary to cry , "
149294	149295	149097	149097	Lord	2394	" "
149298	149299	149097	149097	Lord	2394	" "
149305	149433	149097	149097	Lord	2394	" at intervals . In the sermon , therefore , the old gentleman composes himself to sleep , and there is peace . The Blessington pulpit is to - day occupied by a stranger — a Boanerges , or Son of Thunder , in the shape of a muscular , half - educated , fluent Irishman — a divine who would fain flog his hearers to heaven , show them the way upwards by the light of hell 's flambeaux — one of that too numerous class who revel in disgusting descriptions , and similes drawn from our mortality . It is impossible to help listening to him , and difficult to help being sick . Esther listens , trembling , while he descants with minute relish on "
149440	149664	149097	149097	Lord	2394	" The worm that never dies ! Surely , a terrible picture enough , in its simple bareness , without enlargement thereupon ! With imagination rendered more vivid , and reason weakened by sickness , the unhappy girl pictures that worm gnawing at her brother 's heart — gnawing , crawling , torturing eternally . She covers her face with her hands ; it is too horrible ! A sort of sick feeling comes over her — a giddy faintness . If she can but reach the open air ! She rises unsteadily , opens the pew - door , and walks as in a mist down the aisle , between the two rows of questioning faces , and so out . As she passes through the church - door she staggers slightly , and catches at the wall for support . Gerard , watching her anxiously , sees her unsteady gait , and the involuntary gesture of reaching out for some stay for her tottering figure . Instantly , without giving thought to the light in which his beloved may regard his proceeding , he , rising , quickly follows the young girl . She has just managed to reach a flat tombstone , and there sits , with her face turned thirstily westwards , whence a small soft wind blows fitfully . "
149669	149710	149665	149665	You	3117	" he says , bending solicitously over her , and laying aside in that compassionate mment the armour of his coldness . She does not answer for awhile ; then , drawing a long breath , and trying to smile : "
149717	149723	149097	149097	Lord	2394	" she says , sighingly ; "
149739	149746	149747	149749	that dreadful man	3119	" ( with a shudder ) — "
149760	149761	149764	149764	he	3119	" "
149774	149780	149764	149764	he	3119	" answers Gerard , devoutly ; "
149793	149794	149781	149781	he	3119	" "
149812	149835	149781	149781	he	3119	" she says , fixing her great awestruck eyes upon his face , as if trying to find comfort and reassurance there ; "
149883	149884	149871	149871	God	435	" "
149906	149913	149871	149871	God	435	" replies St. John , composedly . "
149918	149924	149871	149871	God	435	" she cries , eagerly : "
150000	150001	149951	149951	you	3124	" "
150004	150008	150009	150011	My poor child	2039	" he says . "
150058	150059	150060	150060	My	0	" "
150076	150081	150073	150073	I	0	" she answers gravely , "
150106	150107	150101	150101	one	559	" "
150118	150124	150138	150138	you	3124	" he says , chidingly ; "
150131	150132	150138	150138	you	3124	" "
150146	150180	150142	150142	I	0	" she asks , with startled eagerness . The havoc worked in face and figure by the last few months is too directly under his eyes for him to answer anything but truthfully , "
150184	150185	150186	150186	You	3124	" "
150196	150223	150186	150186	You	3124	" she says , lowering her voice , and laying her hand on his arm , while her great feverish eyes burn into his very soul . "
150248	150249	150240	150240	they	3426	" "
150253	150262	150240	150240	they	3426	" he replies , trying to speak lightly . "
150339	150394	150396	150407	dead men of good days , Ere the wrong side of death	3136	" So they return to the house , and he still shows no inclination to leave her . He draws a chair for her near an open window , and stands with his hand resting on the back . It is almost like the old times — the old times that he thinks of , "
150417	150439	150412	150413	GodWas friends	3137	" Something in the recollection of those days makes soft his voice , which is not wo nt to be soft . "
150448	150462	150440	150440	You	0	" he says , stooping down his face towards her small wan one . "
150490	150498	150484	150484	you	0	" She turns away , crimsoning painfully . "
150509	150518	150500	150501	no one	891	" she answers , trying to speak banteringly . "
150529	150530	150520	150520	you	0	" "
150533	150534	150520	150520	you	0	" "
150541	150555	150520	150520	you	0	" With ungovernable , unaccountable impatience , he awaits the slow brief answer . "
150558	150559	150520	150520	you	0	" "
150569	150587	150561	150561	he	3141	" Gerard asks , finding some difficulty in framing the question politely . She fires up quickly . "
150591	150597	150520	150520	you	0	" she repeats , indignantly . "
150620	150621	150615	150615	I	0	" "
150629	150630	150622	150622	You	0	" "
150637	150638	150639	150639	He	3141	" "
150642	150643	150639	150639	He	3141	" "
150646	150647	150648	150649	Poor fellow	3401	" "
150659	150687	150651	150651	he	3141	" says St. John ; the old bitterness surging back upon him , as he reflects on the cowardly duplicity that had made waste two honest lives . "
150694	150700	150701	150701	he	3141	" she cries , eagerly : "
150727	150736	150723	150723	I	0	" ( her eyes gazing out abstractedly at the "
150742	150769	150723	150723	I	0	" as her thoughts fly back to that quarried nook on the bleak autumnal hillside , where she had broken a brave man 's heart ) . "
150798	150799	150800	150800	He	3141	" "
150808	150827	150800	150800	He	3141	" says St. John , exasperated at these laudations , which he imagines levelled as reproaches against himself . "
150830	150835	150864	150864	he	3141	" she answered quietly , "
150923	150935	150936	150936	You	0	" she concludes , while the tears come into her eyes . "
150944	150976	150936	150936	You	0	" says St. John , who , though not usually an ungenerous fellow , is maddened by the expressions of affection , the tears and regretful looks bestowed upon his rival . "
150987	150988	150989	150989	Men	595	" "
150997	151003	151004	151004	women	547	" she answers , gently ; "
151040	151112	151113	151113	Esther	148	" At her words , and the fidelity to himself which they so innocently imply , a fierce bright joy upleaps in his heart — a joy that clamours for utterance in violent fond words , in the wild closeness of forbidden embraces ; but honour , that strong gaoler that keeps so many under lock and key , keeps him too . He only holds out his hand to her . "
151136	151137	151138	151138	I	0	" "
151145	151158	151159	151159	you	0	" she answers meekly , laying her little trembling hand in his — "
151184	151202	151211	151211	you	0	" she asks , impulsively , lifting quivering red lips and dew - soft eyes to his — "
151217	151218	151211	151211	you	0	" "
151224	151241	151221	151221	you	0	" he says , in a troubled voice , hurt pride and hot passion struggling together . "
151266	151267	151268	151268	You	0	" "
151271	151275	151268	151268	You	0	" she answers , feverishly—"you
151320	151353	151310	151310	I	0	" He does not answer : leaning still over her in a dumb agonised yearning , that — with the chains of another still dragging about him — may not be outspoken . "
151362	151379	151380	151380	you	0	" she continues , eyes and cheeks aflame and lustrous with the consuming fire within her , "
151431	151471	151428	151428	you	0	" He is silent for a few moments , questioning his own soul — questioning that conscience whose monitions he has hitherto so stoutly resisted . Then he speaks , a flush of shame making red his bronzed cheek : "
151524	151525	151511	151512	a man	3402	" "
151534	151547	151511	151512	a man	3402	" she cries , passionately , taking his hand between both hers ; "
151587	151635	151636	151636	You	3156	" She is weeping freely as she speaks ; her tears drop hot and slow , one after another , upon his hand . He flings himself on his knees beside her , his mastery over himself reeling in the strong rush of long - pent passion . "
151642	151655	151636	151636	You	3156	" he says , in a voice choked and altered with emotion , "
151679	151680	151681	151681	My	0	" "
151684	151705	151681	151681	My	0	" she answers , trying to speak collectedly , and by gaining calmness herself to bring it back to him . "
151796	151836	151793	151793	I	0	" He is silent ; hesitating to take that step of irrevocable banishment — banishment from the woman that he cast away in righteous wrath , and in whose frail life his own now seems to be bound up . "
151839	151855	151793	151793	I	0	" she says again , earnestly , with a resolute look in her soft face . "
151888	151900	151901	151901	I	0	" The determination in her voice recalls him to his senses . "
151910	151916	151901	151901	I	0	" he says , coldly . "
151966	151967	151959	151959	I	0	" "
151972	151983	151959	151959	I	0	" she answers , trying to smile through her tears . "
152011	152068	152003	152003	she	0	" The people are flocking out of church ; the squire , in a low pony - chaise , driven by a groom as old and toothless as himself , and drawn by a pony ( considering the comparative ages of horses and men ) also nearly as old , is bowling gently up the drive . "
152073	152080	152069	152069	I	0	" Esther says , rising hastily ; "
152099	152520	152087	152087	she	437	" AT Blessington no one goes to church twice . It is the bounden duty of every Christian man , woman , and child to go to church in the morning ; it is the duty of only the clergyman , the school - children , and the organist to go to church in the afternoon . The old people sleep side by side in the blaze of the saloon - fire ; being , both of them , happily deaf , they are undisturbed by each other 's grunts and snores . Since the beginning of St. John 's visit , the north drawing - room has been made over to him and his betrothed to be affectionate in , so that they may enjoy , uninterrupted , those fits of affection to which all engaged people are supposed , and sometimes unjustly supposed , to be liable . Whether they have reached the requisite pitch of warmth on the afternoon I speak of is , to say the least , doubtful ; but , all the same , in the north drawing - room they are . Constance leans back in an armchair , rather listless . She is fond of work , and it is not right to work on Sunday : her feet repose on a foot - stool before her — her eyes are fixed upon them : she is thinking profoundly whether steel buckles a size smaller than the ones she is at present wearing would not be more becoming to the feet . St. John sits by the table ; his left hand supports his head ; his right scribbles idly , on a bit of paper , horses taking impossible fences , prize pigs , ballet - girls , little skeleton men squaring up at one another . He , too , is thinking — but not of shoe - buckles . He has got something to say to Miss Blessington — something unpleasant , unpolite ; and he can not , for the life of him , imagine how to begin to say it . Chance favours him . Miss Blessington , happening to look up , catches her lover 's eyes fixed , with an expression she had never before seen in them — not on herself , as she , for the first second imagines , but ( as a second glance informs her ) on some object outside the window . Her gaze follows his , and lights upon "
152530	152545	152527	152528	Miss Craven	164	" who , with head rather bent , is trudging by towards the garden . "
152552	152558	152527	152528	Miss Craven	164	" she says , pettishly . "
152587	152598	152599	152599	Constance	256	" The opening he has been looking for has come . "
152601	152616	152599	152599	Constance	256	" he says , bending his head , and speaking in a low voice , "
152635	152636	152637	152637	You	0	" "
152648	152654	152637	152637	You	0	" she answers , coldly ; "
152717	152732	152711	152711	she	1422	" St. John lifts his head , and stares at her in blank astonishment . "
152735	152736	152763	152763	you	0	beauty!"—that "
152741	152751	152763	152763	you	0	" he repeats , in a sort of stupefaction . "
152754	152760	152763	152763	you	0	" she replies , languidly , "
152822	152827	152828	152828	I	0	" Gerard smiles contemptuously . "
152847	152848	152851	152851	you	0	" "
152854	152862	152851	152851	you	0	" she asks , with some animation . "

152892	152898	152890	152890	her	1422	" he answers , steadily , "

152951	152987	152933	152933	I	0	" she answers , reddening — an insult to her appearance or her clothes being the one weapon that has power to pierce the scales of her armour of proof . St. John smiles again . "
153015	153016	152933	152933	I	0	" "
153045	153046	152933	152933	I	0	" "

153099	153105	153087	153087	You	0	" objects Constance , pouting . "
153116	153122	153110	153110	I	0	" he rejoins , calmly . "
153156	153162	153152	153152	you	0	" he asks , banteringly , "
153169	153186	153187	153187	Constance	256	" She turns away her head , too indignant to answer . He changes his tone . "
153189	153195	153187	153187	Constance	256	" he says , gravely , "
153257	153258	153211	153211	I	0	" "
153262	153268	153211	153211	I	0	" she answers , resentfully ; "
153319	153337	153310	153310	I	0	" she continues , having recourse to the high moral tone which is her last sure refuge , "
153359	153360	153354	153354	I	0	" "
153372	153384	153392	153392	you	256	" he asks , half - cynically , half - mournfully . "
153481	153491	153479	153479	me	0	" he ends , in bitter self - contempt , "
153515	153516	153479	153479	me	0	" "
153527	153533	153534	153534	I	0	" she asks , drily . "
153575	153576	153566	153566	you	0	" "
153584	153590	153566	153566	you	0	" he asks , bitterly ; "
153647	153648	153649	153649	I	0	" "
153653	153659	153649	153649	I	0	" she answers , sulkily . "
153663	153669	153649	153649	I	0	" he continues , sternly , "
153732	153733	153735	153735	you	0	" "
153742	153749	153735	153735	you	0	" she answers , with anger , "
153807	153808	153809	153809	You	0	" "
153815	153830	153809	153809	You	0	" he rejoins , with a sigh that is more than half a groan ; "
153851	153852	153853	153853	I	0	" "
153866	153875	153853	153853	I	0	" she answers , coldly , mistaking his meaning "
153883	153971	153972	153972	Constance	256	" he replies , curtly . She makes no rejoinder , and he , rising , begins to walk up and down the room with his hands in his pockets . He has made his meaning clear enough , surely , and yet she does not appear to see it . As she continues resolutely silent , he stops opposite to her , and speaks earnestly , and yet with some embarrassment , as one who knows that what he says will be unpleasing to his listener . "
154065	154066	154067	154067	Pshaw	123	" "
154069	154080	154067	154067	Pshaw	123	" she says , pettishly , turning her head aside ; "
154094	154095	154091	154091	I	0	" "
154098	154105	154091	154091	I	0	" he continues , very gravely , "
154210	154211	154239	154239	you	256	" "
154224	154230	154231	154231	You	256	" retorts she , indignantly . "
154309	154310	154311	154311	You	256	" "
154315	154321	154311	154311	You	256	" he answers , quietly . "
154381	154405	154371	154371	yourself	256	" She sits upright in her chair ; her pale , handsome face paler , harder than usual , in her great anger . "
154435	154440	154425	154425	you	256	" He is silent . "
154445	154460	154425	154425	you	256	" she repeats , her voice raised several notes above its wonted low key . "
154469	154480	154481	154481	I	0	" he answers , slowly , reluctantly , yet steadily , "
154499	154575	154576	154576	I	0	" The Gerard diamonds flash before her mind 's eye : they are so big , and numerous — necklace , aigrette , stomacher . The idea of seeing them gleam restless in Esther 's hair , on Esther 's fair neck , is insupportable to her . She will not release him , ardently as he wishes it ; she will hold him by a strong chain that will not snap — his honour . "
154583	154589	154576	154576	I	0	" she answers , coldly . "
154646	154659	154637	154637	people	3426	" He turns to the window , to hide his bitter disappointment . "
154663	154669	154637	154637	people	3426	" he answers , calmly ; "
154714	154872	154712	154712	yourself	0	" NIGHT 'S black sheet drawn off the other half of the world is thrown over us ; the dark side of the lantern is turned towards us . Esther has fallen asleep , with almost a happy smile upon her soft , parted lips . She is forgiven ; and is there any sweetness like the sweetness of being pardoned , having sinned ? He no longer hates her ! That was not hate that looked out of his quick , keen eyes to - day , as he leant over her while she sat , dizzy and faint , on that church- yard slab , or as he knelt in strong emotion at her knees , And now , though at her own telling , he is going away from her to - morrow — though , when next they meet , either they will have put off mortality 's tatters , God will have laid "
154883	155659	154712	154712	yourself	0	" or else , to look and lean as he looked and leant to - day will be deadly sin — yet creeps there a sorrowful joy about her heart . He has given her back the past — the short , happy Felton past ; no one can take it from her again ; not even Miss Blessington , who has taken all else — present and future and all . She is dreaming of him now — dreaming that she is sitting in the library at Felton , in the fragrant gloom made by the lowered Venetian blinds , by dark oak book- shelves , by plentiful sweet flowers , and so sitting hears the sound of his quick feet coming along the passage . He is at the door — he is opening it . But , ah ! what is this — it will not open ; it is stiff on its hinges . He is pushing it — pushing gently , pushing hard — but it will not move . What a stealthy noise it is he makes , as if he were afraid of some one hearing him ! She starts up , broad awake ; it is not all dream ; there is some one pushing stealthily , yet audibly , against a door . For the first bewildered moment of sick fear she imagines that it is her own door on which this attempt is being made ; but a moment 's listening undeceives her . The sound comes from underneath her window , apparently . It is not rats this time ; a rat , with all its ingenuity , would be puzzled to make a noise so distinctly human . Upon her mind there flashes suddenly the recollection of a door leading into the garden beneath her casement , but not so immediately beneath but that she can see it ; a door that stands wide open all the summer through , when people step from house to garden , from garden to house , a hundred times a day , but which in winter is rarely used . She sits up motionless , while round her utter darkness surges . The noise is repeated : push — push ! creak — creak ! it is as if some one , with hand and knee , were attempting to obtain entrance . When light is withdrawn hearing becomes preternaturally sharpened ; in an instant she has jumped out of bed , and run barefoot over the cold boards to the window . There , pulling aside the blind , she , trembling all over , peeps out . Moon is there none , but the joint light of countless star - squadrons , faint though it be , is yet strong enough to enable her distinctly to make out the figure of a man pressing itself against the door in question . With bodily eyes she at length looks upon that burglar , whom , with the terrified eyes of imagination , she had so often beheld . Whether he wear a crape mask or not it is too dark to discern . What is she to do?—she , in all probability , the only wakeful , conscious being in all that great house . For a minute she stands irresolute , while a rushing sound fills her ears , and her teeth chatter dismally in the cold . Shall she alarm the servants ? But how to reach them ? She does not even know the way to their sleeping - places . They are miles away , in the other wing of the house , where she has never been . Shall she go to Miss Blessington ? At least she knows the way thither , though it is some distance off . But of what avail would that be ? Of what use would two girls be , any more than one , against the onslaught of daring unscrupulous robbers ? Shall she betake herself to St. John , whose room is but two doors off ? No sooner does this idea suggest itself to her , than she puts it into practice . Hastily striking a light , and wrapping her dressing - gown round her , she opens her door , and , flying down the passage , knocks loudly at Mr. Gerard 's . But Gerard , having a not particularly bad conscience , and a particularly good digestion , is a sound sleeper . She knocks again , more violently , almost to the flaying of her knuckles : "
155665	155666	155660	155663	Mr. Gerard!—Mr . Gerard	247	" "
155673	155679	154712	154712	yourself	0	" responds a sleepy voice . "
155686	155691	155684	155684	Esther	148	" she cries pantingly . "
155703	155704	155684	155684	Esther	148	" "
155707	155717	155684	155684	Esther	148	" says the voice , perfectly awake this time . "
155730	155750	155724	155724	I	0	" He hurries on his clothes , and then hastens to accede to her request of opening the door . "
155755	155781	155684	155684	Esther	148	" he asks , anxiously , seeing her lean against the door - post , with death - white cheeks and terror - struck eyes . "
155786	155814	155818	155818	I	0	" she answers , hoarse and breathless , while , St. John , candle , and door , all seem to be dancing a jig round her . "
155841	155842	155839	155839	him	3402	" "
155848	155857	155839	155839	him	3402	" replies the young man , with animation . "
155875	155876	155866	155866	I	0	" "
155881	155892	155866	155866	I	0	" she cries , with all a woman 's unreason . "
155901	155922	155923	155923	I	0	" ( though for what other purpose she had sought his assistance she would have been puzzled to say ) . "
155934	156218	155866	155866	I	0	" and so , gasping , stretches out her white arms towards him , and , letting drop her candle , falls insensible , in the total darkness , into his embrace . For a month past or more , the dream that has pursued Gerard night and day — unchecked in sleep , in waking faintly repressed by considerations of honour — is to hold that fair woman 's form in his arms ; and now he so holds her in reality . And yet , as the fulfilment of our wishes seldom affords us the gratification we had anticipated , so it is with him . Now that he has got her , he does not quite know what to do with her . Shall he , encumbered by his beautiful burden , grope his way back into his room , and lay her down there , while he goes and investigates into the cause of her terror and swoon ? But the household , being alarmed , may find her there ; and , so finding , would not the reputation of her , most innocent , be endangered ? Her head droops heavy in its perfect lifelessness on his shoulder ; her soft warm hair caresses his cheek in the blackness of the night . He looks down the passage . From Esther 's open door a flood of light streams ; at all events there is a candle left burning there . In a moment he has borne her into her own chamber , and has laid her most gently down upon the ginger - moreen bed . He has no time to try and revive her now . "
156237	156475	156227	156228	poor child!—her	3213	" is the hasty thought that has crossed his mind ; but looking through the window , as she had done , he sees , as she had seen , a man 's dim figure in the starlight . Without a moment 's delay , without casting another thought even to the fair swooned woman he leaves behind him , Gerard runs down the corridor , his blood pleasantly astir with the thought of a possible adventure — through interminable dark galleries , down the gleaming cold of white stone stairs , through hall , saloon , north drawing - room , and justicing - room — till he reaches a narrow short passage that leads to the garden door . As he and his light draw near , the noise suddenly ceases . He stands still for a moment , expecting to hear it repeated , but it is not . Setting down his candle , therefore , he advances towards the door and unfastens it — it is secured by an old - fashioned catch inside — opens it , and looks out into the night . At first he can discern nothing but the chill wintry garden , and the million stars scattered broadcast over God 's one great unenclosed field of the sky ; but a second glance reveals to him a dim figure crouching indistinct in the shadow of a projecting buttress . "
156480	156493	156227	156228	poor child!—her	3213	" he cries , in a loud clear voice . No answer . "
156498	156502	156227	156228	poor child!—her	3213	" he repeats . "
156513	156565	156509	156509	I	0	" Firing , in this instance , must mean using the flat candlestick as a projectile , for other weapon has Mr. Gerard none . Hardly have the words left his mouth , however , before the figure springs forth from its hiding - place , and stands erect before him . "
156577	156616	156576	156576	I.	0	" Livery - buttons flash in the starlight : behold the culprit revealed!—a young and lighthearted footman , who has on one or two previous occasions been suspected of a too great proclivity towards the nocturnal festivities of the "
156619	156638	156576	156576	I.	0	" A sense of infuriation at the bald tame end of the adventure gets possession of St. John . "
156666	156680	156643	156643	you	3214	" he asks , with a gruff asperity not unworthy of his papa . "
156705	156706	156703	156703	sir	3823	" "
156711	156718	156703	156703	sir	3823	" cries St. John , angrily . "
156773	156774	156776	156776	you	3823	" "
156781	156795	156798	156800	a young woman	3496	" replies the man , hanging his head , and looking very sheepish , "
156825	156826	156827	156829	A young woman	3496	" "
156831	156842	156827	156829	A young woman	3496	" repeats St. John , repressing an inclination to smile . "
156865	156866	156827	156829	A young woman	3496	" "
156942	156943	156927	156927	she	274	" "
156958	156964	156950	156950	Betsy	274	" interrupts Gerard , drily . "
156993	157036	156980	156980	I	0	" Relieved at being let off so easily , the young fellow slinks away , and Gerard retraces his steps upstairs again . He can not help laughing as he thinks of poor Esther 's tragic fears , of her agonised pleadings : "
157054	157055	157042	157042	I	0	" "
157072	157076	157077	157077	I	0	" he thinks , "
157095	157100	157102	157102	I	0	" He laughs again . "
157144	157233	157133	157135	this bloodthirsty villain	3237	" Having reached her door , he pauses and listens . There is no sound within . He knocks gently — no answer : knocks again — still no reply . Half - hesitating , as one that stands doubtful on the threshold of a church , he opens the door and enters . The light burns on the dressing - table , and she lies still prone , where he had laid her , on the bed , still completely insensible . This swoon is horribly deathlike : "
157273	157345	157234	157234	...........	506	" Her head is thrown back , and her round chin slightly raised . Over the tossed pillow wander the tangled riches of her swart hair ; nerveless on the counterpane lie the white , carven hands and blue - veined wrists , on which the faint fine lines make a tender network . Half - shadowed by her dressing - gown , half - emerging from it gleam bare feet , "
157356	157455	157234	157234	...........	506	" He leans over her , gazing with passionate admiration at the heavy shut lids and upward curling lashes — with passionate admiration mixed with sharp pain ; for he can see , plainlier now in this long quiet look than in the hasty , stolen glances he has hitherto given her , the purple stains under closed eyes , the little depressions in the rounded cheek , the droop of the sweet sorrowful mouth . Iachimo 's words recur to him — Iachimo 's , as he gazed in his treachery upon the sleeping beauty of Imogen : "
158080	158085	158086	158086	she	148	" Where is he ? "
158095	158106	158086	158086	she	148	" Is he gone?—did he get in?—did he hurt you ? "
158107	158119	158120	158120	Gerard	247	" He was not a very formidable burglar , after all , "
158128	158154	158120	158120	Gerard	247	" it was only Thomas , who had been seeing his sweetheart home , and was trying to get into the house without being heard . "
158155	158164	158166	158166	her	148	" Oh , I 'm so glad ! But "
158174	158193	158166	158166	her	148	" how did I get here ? When last I remember any thing I was in the passage . "
158194	158200	158120	158120	Gerard	247	" I carried you here . "
158201	158212	158120	158120	Gerard	247	" And then went and found out about this man ? "
158213	158216	158166	158166	her	148	" Yes . "
158217	158225	158120	158120	Gerard	247	" And then came back - here ? "
158226	158239	158240	158240	he	3255	" Yes . I hope you do n't think me very impertinent , "
158245	158271	158240	158240	he	3255	" but I could not bear the idea of your lying here , insensible , without any one making an attempt to bring you round . "
158315	158321	158322	158322	he	3255	" You are better now , "
158332	158337	158322	158322	he	3255	" I will go . "
158377	158398	158358	158358	Constance	256	" Oh , Miss Craven ! I 'm so frightened ! I heard people talking outside — St. John ! ! "
158423	158427	158416	158417	Miss Blessington	258	" St. John ! "
158428	158431	158433	158434	St. John	164	" Well ! "
158451	158465	158466	158466	she	256	" I suppose I may be allowed to ask what brings you here ? "
158477	158482	158483	158483	he	3255	" You certainly may , "
158494	158554	158483	158483	he	3255	" and I have not the slightest objection to telling you . What brought me here was the endeavour to recover Miss Craven from a faint into which she fell on coming to tell me — as the only person within her reach — that a man was , as she imagined , endeavouring to break into the house . "
158572	158582	158584	158584	Constance	256	" And you took no steps to prevent him ? "
158606	158673	158677	158677	he	3255	" Pardon me ! I did ; but having discovered that it was only one of the footmen , who had been accidentally locked out , I came back to tell Miss Craven so , if she were recovered ! and , if not , to give her that assistance which any one human being may render to another without being called to account for it . "
158692	158703	158704	158704	she	256	" I should hardly have imagined it was your business , "
158713	158726	158704	158704	she	256	" May I ask why you could not ring for the servants ? "
158727	158736	158737	158737	he	3255	" Because , as you are well aware , "
158747	158789	158737	158737	he	3255	" if I were to ring from now till doomsday , not a soul would hear me ; all the bells ring downstairs , and the servants ' bedrooms are at least a quarter of a mile distant up - stairs . "
158790	158802	158704	158704	she	256	" Why could not you have come to me , then ? "
158803	158818	158819	158819	he	3255	" The impropriety would , in that case , have been at least equal , "
158824	158841	158844	158844	his	3255	" and , to tell you the truth , such a course never occurred to me . "
158849	158861	158862	158862	she	256	" It is , of course , no concern of mine , "
158869	158896	158897	158897	She	256	" If Miss Craven chooses to receive the visits of gentlemen , HERE , at two o'clock in the morning , it does me no harm ! "
158957	158993	158941	158941	his	3255	" Constance ! what do you mean by these insults ? How dare you give utterance to them ? Is your own mind so impure that you can not believe in the purity of others ? "
158994	159007	159008	159008	she	256	" You must allow that it is at least an equivocal position , "
159026	159030	159031	159031	he	3255	" It is , "
159036	159160	159031	159031	he	3255	" I allow it — I bitterly feel it . And yet , if it were only myself that were concerned , I should scorn to descend to any more explanation than that I have already given you ; but for the sake of this most innocent girl , whom by my folly I have compromised , I swear to you , Constance — I solemnly take God to witness!—that it is exactly and simply as I have told you . Miss Craven had not recovered from her insensibility more than two minutes before you came into the room ; I was in the act of leaving it as you entered . This is the whole plain truth : do you believe it ? "
159166	159172	159173	159173	he	3256	" Do you believe it ? "
159196	159213	159214	159214	she	3256	" It can not be of much consequence to you whether I believe it or not , "
159227	159274	159214	159214	she	3256	" You have , at all events , adopted the best method of obtaining your release from that engagement , which you so broadly hinted , only yesterday afternoon , that you wished to be free from . You have your wish — you are free ! "
159275	159280	159281	159281	he	3256	" As you will , "
159286	159383	159384	159384	he	3256	" God knows there never was much love in our connection ; an iller - mated pair never came together ; it was a mere matter of business on both sides . But , as to saying that the pure accident which has brought Miss Craven and me into slight and transient collision to - night can have any influence upon the conclusion or continuance of our engagement — it is tantamount to telling me that what I have sworn to you , upon my honour as a gentleman , to be true , is false ! "
159394	159398	159399	159399	she	3257	" Is it ? "
159444	159447	159448	159448	she	3257	" Unfortunately , "
159451	159500	159448	159448	she	3257	" I am behind the spirit of the age ; I am shackled with obsolete old notions of propriety and decency ; and therefore — as you have no longer any smallest control over my actions — will you be so good as to allow me to go ? "
159522	159537	159516	159516	his	3256	" Go ! I have neither the wish nor the power to detain you ; "
159600	159604	159605	159605	he	3256	" My darling ! "
159615	159629	159605	159605	he	3256	" how will you ever forgive me for having exposed you to this ! "
159645	159648	159649	159649	she	3257	" Go ! "
159652	159677	159649	159649	she	3257	faintly—"go , this minute ! Do n't say another word ! Do n't give her any more reason for her wicked slanders ! Go ! "
160016	160024	160036	160036	She	148	" I am going to be ill , "
160026	160035	160036	160036	She	148	" I am going to be turned away . "
160273	160287	160288	160288	she	148	" What have you come here for ? Why have you followed me ? "
160298	160313	160288	160288	she	148	" Miss Blessington 's windows look this way — she will see us together . "
160314	160320	160321	160321	he	455	" Let her see us , "
160326	160340	160342	160343	poor Esther	148	" She will never believe that it was by accident we have met , "
160349	160362	160342	160343	poor Esther	148	" She will be right , then ; it is not accident , "
160363	160373	160374	160374	she	148	" She will think that it was an appointment ! "
160384	160390	160374	160374	she	148	" Let her think so ! "
160391	160404	160405	160405	she	148	" It is very well for you to talk in this way , "
160412	160435	160405	160405	she	148	" You are a man — you may defy the opinion of the world ; but is it so easy for me ? "
160436	160447	160448	160448	he	455	" Why should her opinion concern either you or me ? "
160453	160478	160448	160448	he	455	" What is she to either of us ? Did not you last night , with your own ears , hear my dismissal pronounced ? "
160493	160498	160499	160499	she	148	" She was angry , "
160507	160523	160499	160499	she	148	" she will be sorry for the things she said ; she will forgive you . "
160524	160528	160529	160529	he	455	" Will she ? "
160535	160554	160555	160555	She	148	" I think not ; to tell you the truth , I do n't mean to ask her . "
160566	160570	160571	160571	she	148	" You must ! "
160576	160595	160571	160571	she	148	" You must explain to her , as you tried to do last night , that what happened then "
160601	160634	160635	160635	He	455	" is no possible reason why her engagement to you should be broken off . You must convince her of this — you must , indeed ; for my sake you must ! "
160642	160661	160635	160635	He	455	" When a galley - slave 's chains have been knocked off , must he handcuff himself again ? "
160662	160671	160672	160672	she	148	" Why did you handcuff yourself at first ? "
160679	160700	160672	160672	she	148	" Whose doing was it but your own ? What madness first impelled you to ask her to marry you ? "
160701	160704	160705	160705	he	455	" Because , "
160716	160842	160672	160672	she	148	her—"because I was smarting miserably under the blow you had just given me — you , who had made me mistrust everything attractive , and womanly , and innocent - seeming . I was obliged to marry some one ; that is one of the many curses attached to being an eldest son , and the last male heir of an inconveniently old family . I said to myself , ' She is too dull to deceive me , too passionless to disgrace me . ' I chose her because she was , of all the women I knew , the one least capable of calling forth emotion of any kind whatever in me — consequently , the one most powerless to make me suffer . "
160868	160872	160873	160873	she	3283	" Mr. Gerard , "
160878	160920	160873	160873	she	3283	" the twenty - four hours you asked me to allow you yesterday are nearly expired : have you come to say ' good - bye ' to me ? If so , it is well ; you remember your promise ? "
160921	160926	160927	160927	he	3282	" I remember it , "
160932	160968	160969	160969	he	3282	" and I am prepared to — break it . Do n't look so reproachful , Esther ! I am ready to make you as good a one instead . I am ready to swear , "
160983	161020	160972	160972	his	3282	passion—"I am ready to swear to you that I will never leave you again , unless you send me away , until death do us part . Will that promise do as well as the other ? "
161029	161035	161036	161036	she	3284	" What do you mean ? "
161049	161053	161054	161054	he	3282	" I mean , "
161072	161100	161054	161054	he	3282	" that I am sick of my life without you , Esther ; and you — you are sick of yours without me , are n't you ? "
161120	161127	161128	161128	he	3282	" There must be some reason , "
161133	161151	161128	161128	he	3282	" for your failing health , for your thin white cheeks , for your total loss of beauty "
161158	161188	161128	161128	he	3282	" as Constance tersely worded it yesterday . Am I right ; or is it my conceit that makes me think that I have some concern in the change ? "
161189	161194	161195	161195	she	3284	" You are mistaken , "
161220	161264	161265	161265	She	3284	" I was very fond of you — very ; it was a great grief to me when you threw me away from you ; but I could have done without you , if — if — I had not lost my boy . "
161310	161314	161315	161315	he	247	" Could you ? "
161322	161340	161315	161315	he	247	" No doubt ! I was unreasonable to suppose that I could be indispensable to any one . "
161431	161444	161445	161445	Gerard	247	" This is not fit weather for you to be out in , "
161462	161473	161445	161445	Gerard	247	" Let us shelter here till the storm is over ! "
161536	161697	161698	161698	he	3293	" Esther , I have been thinking what a short section of my life , counting by days and weeks , the time that I have known you forms ; that month at Felton , when we had scarcely eyes or ears for any one but each other , and this month here , when we have hardly exchanged two words . I suppose I know very little about you , really ; you may be a very bad worthless girl , for all I know to the contrary . God knows I have not had much reason to think you a very good one ; and yet , good or bad — well , as you say , and as I have no reason to doubt , that you can get on without me — I can not , for the life of me , bear any longer the dragging of the endless empty days without you . Esther ! "
161708	161731	161698	161698	he	3293	" I want you ! I must have you for my own ! Is there now any reason why I should not ? "
161732	161737	161738	161738	she	3294	" Have you forgotten , "
161746	161813	161738	161738	she	3294	" the night when you told me that you would never forgive me , either in this world or the next ? What have I done since to make you change your mind ? I am no different to what I was then — unless , perhaps , I may be a little wickeder ; I have been most unhappy , and adversity makes one wicked . "
161814	161823	161824	161824	he	3295	" I suppose I have lost my senses , "
161830	161920	161921	161921	he	3295	" but it seems to me now that , even were you to deceive me again , as you did at Felton — if you were to cheat me , and tell me falsehoods with the same baby - innocent face that you did there — that even then I should not repent of my bargain . Of two evils it would be the least ; it would be better than never to have possessed you at all . Only , child , one thing I beg of you , "
161928	161965	161921	161921	he	3295	" if you mean to trick me a second time , do n't let me find it out for a little while ! Let me be happy for a year — a month — a week ! "
162009	162015	162016	162016	she	3296	" You are very good , "
162025	162093	162016	162016	she	3296	" and it is very generous of you trying to hide your real motive ; but I can see it : it is pity ! You look at me , and think , ' She was a pretty girl once , and now she has grown old and thin and plain , and it is all for love of me ! ' Yes , it is pity ! "
162094	162099	162100	162100	he	3295	" You are right , "
162105	162130	162100	162100	he	3295	" it is pity , profound pity , for the most miserable , discontented fellow upon God 's earth — to wit , myself . "
162156	162170	162171	162171	he	3295	" If I was over - harsh to you that night at Felton , "
162176	162300	162171	162171	he	3295	" and I am willing now to own that I was — for , after all , it was not against me that you had most greatly sinned — I have , at all events , paid heavily enough for it . What do you suppose I have suffered during the last month , watching you day by day wearing out your young life in a cold servile drudgery — hearing you strain your poor little tired voice in the interminable readings to that insatiable old man ! Essie , I 'm not a particularly pleasant fellow to live with — sometimes I believe I am particularly unpleasant — but , at my worst , I 'm not so bad as old Blessington . "
162313	162321	162322	162322	he	3298	" Why do you shake your head ? "
162338	162342	162343	162343	he	3298	" Is it , "
162363	162424	162343	162343	he	3298	" that you want to tell me by signs , what you dare not tell me in words to my face , that the old love is dead , killed by my hard words that miserable night at Felton Oh , love ! it must have been but a weakly thing , if a few rough words could kill it . "
162430	162439	162440	162440	he	3298	" You did love me once , Esther , "
162445	162530	162440	162440	he	3298	" I know you did ! I knew it then , only , in my blind rage , I affected to disbelieve it . You must have loved me , when you , who had always been so shy , so reserved , so maidenly to me , of your own accord — do you recollect , sweet?—held out your arms to me , and flung yourself upon my breast . God only knows how hard it was for me to put you away ! "
162555	162604	162605	162605	She	3299	" Esther , speak!—and yet , perhaps , when you have spoken , I shall wish that you had kept silence . Say anything you will , do anything you will , only do n't kill me by telling me that so sweet a thing can be dead ! "
162624	162634	162635	162635	she	3299	" Why do you torment me with these questions ? "
162640	162672	162635	162635	she	3299	" If my love for you is dead , you ought to be thankful ; for , while it was alive , it brought nothing but misery to either of us . "
162673	162685	162686	162686	he	3298	" If you think so , it must indeed be dead , "
162692	162704	162705	162705	she	3299	" Why will you insist on driving me into a corner ? "
162719	162758	162705	162705	she	3299	" Why will you force me to make admissions that I do n't want to make ? What is the good of my owning that I love you still , when I am determined never to marry you ? "
162759	162765	162766	162766	he	3298	" Never to marry me ! "
162807	162813	162814	162814	she	3299	" Never to marry you ! "
162819	162856	162814	162814	she	3299	" I was a bad - enough match for you before — without fortune , position , or connexion ; people would have pitied you then for being drawn into such a marriage ; but now — "
162857	162863	162814	162814	she	3299	" But now , what ? "
162864	162873	162874	162874	she	3299	" But now that I am a companion , "
162880	162928	162874	162874	she	3299	pride—"an anomalous animal , just two shades higher than the lady's - maid in my own estimation , and probably not that in any one else's — a companion , too , of whom people can say the things that Miss Blessington will say of me now — "
162929	162943	162814	162814	she	3299	" What do you mean ? What sort of things can she say ? "
162952	162958	162945	162945	Esther	148	" That you are completely passé "
162959	162970	162874	162874	she	3299	" No , not that!—that would not concern me much . "
162971	162985	162874	162874	she	3299	" That the way you cough in the evening fidgets her to death ? "
162986	162992	162874	162874	she	3299	" No , not that . "
162993	163009	162874	162874	she	3299	" That you are over - sensitive , as these sort of people always are ? "
163025	163031	162874	162874	she	3299	" No , not that . "
163032	163036	162874	162874	she	3299	" What then ? "
163037	163060	163061	163061	she	148	" You must remember the things she said ; you were there , and it is not more than five hours ago , "
163068	163078	163061	163061	she	148	" I forget every word she uttered except three . "
163079	163085	162874	162874	she	3299	" And what were they ? "
163086	163091	162874	162874	she	3299	" You are free . "
163092	163099	163101	163101	Esther	148	" She did not mean them , "
163110	163129	163101	163101	Esther	148	" she was under an erroneous impression when she said them ; she will take you back again . "
163130	163136	163137	163137	he	3303	" Take me back again ! "
163142	163212	163137	163137	he	3303	" Good heavens , Esther ! are you bent on driving me mad ? Not satisfied with refusing me point - blank yourself , are you determined to insult me , by forcing upon me a woman for whom , as you know — as you must have known from the first moment you saw us together — I have never felt anything but the profoundest , coldest indifference ? "
163213	163219	163220	163220	she	3304	" I meant no insult , "
163225	163250	163220	163220	she	3304	" I only meant to say what is true — that she is a suitable match for you — that she is your equal . "
163251	163255	163256	163256	he	3305	" Is she ? "
163260	163318	163256	163256	he	3305	" You are very good , I 'm sure ; I ask for bread , and you give me a stone . For God 's sake , Essie , if you will have nothing to say to me yourself , at least spare me the degradation of listening to your kind and disinterested plans for my welfare ! "
163329	163333	163334	163334	he	3305	" Is it , "
163346	163407	163408	163408	She	164	" the mere fact of my being well - off that damns me in your eyes ? If so , I think I may plead ' not guilty , ' seeing that this oppressive wealth of mine lies on the other side of Sir Thomas 's death — an event probably , at least , as distant as the millennium . "
163438	163440	163435	163435	she	164	" Yea "
163442	163445	163435	163435	she	164	" Nay . "
163446	163460	163461	163461	he	3305	" When I am asking you to give me your whole sweet life , "
163474	163493	163461	163461	he	3305	" are you so ungenerous as to wish me to have absolutely nothing to offer you in return ? "
163497	163500	163501	163501	he	3305	" Essie ! "
163520	163621	163501	163501	he	3305	" I do n't ask you to have pity upon me — that is a puling , cowardly way of making love , I always think ; if the only road to a woman 's heart lies through her compassion , I had rather never get there at all — but I ask you to pity yourself . To be my wife , ill - tempered and jealous as I , no doubt , should often be , would be distinctly a better fate than to be old Blessington 's drudge . Child ! have you no pity for yourself ? "
163622	163626	163627	163627	she	164	" None whatever , "
163633	163698	163699	163699	He	3306	" I am not in the least sorry for myself ; I richly deserve everything that is come to me . As long as I am unhappy myself , I can better bear the recollection of my vile conduct to the best and loyalest lover ever any woman had ; if I began to be happy , I think my remorse would kill me . "
163711	163721	163722	163722	he	3306	" I have been sacrificed to him once already , "
163727	163751	163722	163722	he	3306	" am I to be sacrificed a second time to a sentimental recollection of him — to the mere memory of his perfections ? "
163764	163772	163773	163773	she	164	" Do n't be angry with me , "
163778	163804	163773	163773	she	164	" this has nothing to say to him ; the reason why I will not marry you is that I am a mésalliance for you . "
163805	163814	163815	163815	he	3306	" That is my concern , I imagine , "
163820	163825	163826	163826	she	164	" I think not , "
163831	163876	163826	163826	she	164	" You have lost your senses , as you told me just now ; you are mad , and I am sane ; therefore I can judge better than you yourself what is for your good : some day you will agree with me . "
163877	163880	163881	163881	he	3306	" Never ! "
163988	164007	164088	164088	he	3306	" After long grief and pain , To feel the arms of your true loveRound you once again ? "
164015	164020	164021	164021	she	164	" Let me go , "
164026	164032	164021	164021	she	164	" this is not right ! "
164033	164038	164039	164039	he	3306	" Right or wrong , "
164044	164075	164039	164039	he	3306	" it is the one moment worth being called ' life ' that I have spent since I was fool enough to cut my own throat by parting from you . "
164076	164081	164082	164082	she	164	" Let me go ! "
164120	164175	164088	164088	he	3306	" Essie , I am not unjust ; I will let you go this instant , to any quarter of the world that you wish , without a word of remonstrance , if you will only look up in my face and say , ' St. John , I do n't love you . ' "
164201	164209	164176	164176	She	164	" St. John , I do n't — "
164237	164242	164243	164243	he	3306	" I knew it , "
164266	164324	164325	164325	She	164	" I risked my everything upon that test , and it has not failed me . Even your miserable pride , Esther , could not constrain you to such a lie ! With your heart beating against mine , as if we had but one between us , your lips did not dare frame those ugly words . "
164358	164362	164363	164363	he	3306	" Oh love ! "
164375	164452	164363	164363	he	3306	" are you struggling to get away from me still ? Am I never to persuade any good thing to stay with me ? Will you never forgive me the sin of being an eldest son ? God knows it is not my fault — that it was not my choice to be born amongst the drones ! Oh , Essie , is it just of you to punish me for what I can not help ? "
164453	164462	164463	164463	she	164	" I do n't wish to punish you , "
164487	164516	164478	164478	he	3306	" The real way to punish you would be to let you have your will — to say , ' I will marry you , St. John ! ' "
164517	164538	164478	164478	he	3306	" In God 's name punish me , then ! No one ever took chastisement meeklier than I will this . "
164539	164547	164548	164548	she	164	" And what would the end be ? "
164553	164590	164591	164591	she	164	" You would be insanely happy for a little while — a month — two months , perhaps — and then you would get tired of me . There is nothing in me , I think , "
164596	164634	164591	164591	she	164	" to keep a man 's love after the first madness is over : I never had anything but a pretty face , and now even that is gone in the eyes of every one but you . "
164635	164642	164643	164643	he	3310	" What ! in Linley 's ? "
164665	164701	164702	164702	He	3310	" Some day you would wake up and say , ' I have thrown myself away ; ' and I — I prefer to say it for you now , while it is yet time . "
164714	164814	164711	164711	she	164	" When a person has once lost confidence in another , they can never get it quite back again ; you would never quite trust me . Only the other day you thought hard things of me , because I seemed grateful to Mr. Linley for talking friendly to me : I saw it in your eyes as you rode past us that night : and — which is the last and greatest reason of all — you would not like people to say of your wife the things that Miss Blessington will enable them to say of me . "
164815	164819	164822	164822	Gerard	258	" Even granting , "
164826	164883	164822	164822	Gerard	258	violence—"and God forbid my ever granting anything of the kind!—that it is in her or any one else 's power to blast your reputation , what pleasure could it possibly give one girl to sully the good name of another , whom she must know in her heart of hearts to be as innocent as herself ? "
164884	164897	164898	164898	she	258	" None whatever , perhaps , if I remain as I am , "
164908	164988	164898	164898	she	258	" As Esther Craven , I am too insignificant to clash with her ; but if I were to be your wife — if I were to be her successor in that position for which she is , in her own and her friends ' opinion , so well suited — would not she be likely to give her own explanation of the change She would describe things as they seemed to her , and people would believe her . "
164989	164993	164994	164994	he	3311	" Let them ! "
164998	165021	164994	164994	he	3311	" If you loved me perfectly , the only people that existed in the world for you would be yourself and me . "
165022	165035	165036	165036	she	3312	" I do not love you perfectly , then , I suppose , "
165041	165073	165036	165036	she	3312	" for not even the enormous happiness of being with you always , of being half your life , could compensate me for the degradation of bringing you a sullied name . "
165097	165101	165102	165102	she	3312	" St. John , "
165114	165161	165102	165102	she	3312	" you have made me two promises — one that you will go away and leave me to - day , and one that you will leave me never until I send you away . I keep you to the first : I send you away . "
165162	165170	165171	165171	he	3311	" But I will not be sent , "
165182	165236	165171	165171	he	3311	" The conditions under which that promise was made are utterly changed ; the obstacle that parted us then no longer exists : there is none between us now but what is of your own raising . I am , therefore , no longer bound by that oath ; I will not go ! "
165237	165241	165242	165242	she	3313	" Very well , "
165247	165293	165242	165242	she	3313	" then I must ; and when one is to have a foot or a hand cut off , it is best to do it at once . St. John , I will not sleep another night under the same roof with you ! Goodbye ! "
165300	165336	165337	165337	She	3313	" You may say ' goodbye ' to me , but I will never say ' goodbye ' to you : death is the only ' goodbye ' I will accept as valid between us . "
165363	165366	165367	165367	he	3311	" Esther!—Esther ! "
165374	165378	165367	165367	he	3311	" drip , drip "
165536	165546	165548	165549	St. John	164	" Does Miss Craven know that luncheon is ready ? "
165564	165583	165548	165549	St. John	164	" If you please , sir , I do n't think that Miss Craven is coming to lunch . "
165584	165590	165591	165591	he	3311	" Why not?—is she ill ? "
165608	165618	165591	165591	he	3311	" I believe she is rather poorly , sir . "
165669	165685	165686	165686	she	256	" I have been telling my aunt about our alarm last night , St. John , "
165694	165697	165686	165686	she	256	" Indeed ! "
165698	165705	165686	165686	she	256	" And its tame prosaic dénouement . "
165706	165709	165686	165686	she	256	" Indeed ! "
165710	165758	165686	165686	she	256	" I am afraid I was unreasonably angry with you for what was evidently a mere accident ; but when one is nervous and frightened , one really does not know what one says . I 'm sure I have the vaguest recollection of what I said . "
165759	165769	165686	165686	she	256	" I remember distinctly what you said , Constance . "
165770	165773	165686	165686	she	256	" Indeed ! "
165782	165803	165804	165804	He	3322	" You do n't bear malice , I hope ? Things are much as they were before , I suppose ? "
165821	165851	165816	165816	his	3322	" Things are between us as they have been all our lives up to last October ; as they have been since then , they will never be again . "
165875	165882	165883	165883	she	256	" That is what I meant , "
166044	166051	166028	166029	the housemaid	647	" Dinner , please , miss . "
166052	166059	166061	166063	the poor child	5258	" I can not go down , "
166092	166104	166028	166029	the housemaid	647	" I do n't want any dinner ; I 'm ill ! "
166105	166117	166119	166120	the woman	3893	" Dear me , ' m ! you do look bad ! "
166164	166176	166119	166120	the woman	3893	" Would not you like to have Mr. Brand sent for ? "
166177	166184	166186	166187	the girl	682	" Oh , no — thanks ! "
166196	166205	166186	166187	the girl	682	" I daresay it will go of itself . "—"If
166221	166316	166212	166212	I	0	" is her mental reflection . The evening drags away about as heavily as usual in the saloon . Gerard , having ascertained that Miss Craven is still in the house , and has consequently broken her resolution of not sleeping another night under the same roof with him , tries to content himself with the idea that to - morrow to - morrow — her temporary indisposition probably past — he will have another opportunity of reasoning and pleading with her . About nine o'clock Miss Blessington 's maid appears at the door . "
166330	166331	166322	166322	I	0	" "
166334	166374	166322	166322	I	0	" answers Constance , graciously , rising and walking off to the demanded conference . Constance is always polite to her servants ; it is a bad style , middle - class to be rude to one 's inferiors . "
166404	166405	166395	166395	she	164	" "
166413	166420	166395	166395	she	164	" inquires the other , placidly ; "
166435	166436	166425	166425	I	0	" "
166476	166477	166467	166467	she	164	" "
166481	166492	166467	166467	she	164	" cries Constance , thoroughly roused by this gay picture ; "
166501	166523	166467	166467	she	164	" Reassured on this point , and having ordered the attendance of Mr. Brand , she returns unruffled to the fireside . "
166532	166554	166555	166555	She	164	" asks St. John , lazily , quite willing to be amicable now that their relative positions are made clearly evident . "
166568	166574	166575	166575	Servants	1158	" she answers , carelessly . "
166585	166586	166579	166579	I	0	" "
166594	166600	166601	166601	I	0	" he asks , hurriedly . "
166607	166613	166579	166579	I	0	" she replies , drily ; "
166627	166652	166619	166620	Mr. Brand	166	" Ten o'clock ! The old couple are trundled off to their separate apartments : and Miss Blessington , having bidden St. John a cold "
166657	167008	166619	166620	Mr. Brand	166	" sails , candle in hand , up the grand staircase , to that sleep that never fails to come at her calm bidding . Gerard foregoes his evening pipe , because the smoking - room does not look to the front . In painful unrest , he unfastens the shutters of one of the saloon - windows , and , raising the stiff and seldom - opened sash , leans out , looking and listening - looking at the maiden moon that rides , pale and proud , while black ruffian clouds chase each other to overtake her . Mr. Brand is out , apparently ; for half - past ten has been struck , in different tones — bass and treble , deep and squeaky — by half - a - dozen different clocks , and still he has not arrived . At length , to the watcher 's strained ear , comes the sound of wheels descending the steep pitch , from Blessington village ; then a brougham 's lamps gleam , issuing from between the rhododendron banks , and roll , like two angry eyes , to the door . In his feverish anxiety , and impatience at the long tarrying of the sleepy footman , St. John himself admits the doctor ; and , following him at a little distance , as he is ushered upstairs , sits down in his own bedroom , with the door wide open , ready to pounce out upon the small Æsculapius , as he passes along the gallery at his departure , and learn his verdict . The visit is rather a long one ; to St. John , sitting still in his idle impatient misery , it seems as though the sound of Esther 's opening door would never come ; but never is a long day . At length the welcome sound is heard ; and the young man , precipitating himself into the passage , comes face to face with a small elderly gentleman , shiveringly taking his way down the unwarmed ghostly old corridors . "
167015	167093	166619	166620	Mr. Brand	166	" he asks , abruptly , framing the simple words as they rise from his full heart . Mr. Brand stares , surprised , at his questioner 's blanched face . He had imagined that his patient was a little friendless orphan companion , whose life or death — save as a mere matter of compassion — were subjects of almost equal indifference to the people under whose roof she lies , panting out her young life . "
167114	167129	167100	167100	I	0	" he says , imagining that he has got the key to the mystery ; "
167142	167143	167135	167135	I	0	" "
167151	167157	167148	167148	I	0	" rejoins Gerard , bluntly . "
167173	167174	167148	167148	I	0	" "
167190	167226	167148	167148	I	0	" inquires the little doctor , peering inquisitively , though under difficulties — for the abundant wind is playing rude tricks with the flame of his candle — into St. John 's sad brown face . "
167231	167232	167148	167148	I	0	" "
167249	167275	167299	167299	you	0	" he answers , with the careless deliberate calmnesa which those whose half - life is spelt in pronouncing death- warrants seem insensibly to acquire : "
167319	167320	167321	167321	I	0	" "
167328	167426	167321	167321	I	0	" replies the other , gloomily . He has no reason , beyond the probability of the thing , for supposing that she had ever had a father or mother , much less a grandfather or grandmother . Mr. Brand retires , completely mystified ; and St. John , re - entering his room , throws himself into an arm - chair , and , covering his face with his hands , sends up violent voiceless prayers for the young life that is exchanging the first passes with that skilfulest of fencers , whom the nations have christened "
167429	167661	167299	167299	you	0	" In all his rough godless life he has had small faith in the efficacy of prayer ; but , on the bare chance of there being some good in it , he prays wordlessly in his stricken heart for her . Before they have done with him , the inmates of Blessington Hall have grown very familiar with Dr. Brand 's face night and morning , night and morning , coming and going , coming and going , through many days ; for the adversary with whom the child is wrestling has thrown many a better and stouter than she — and the battle is bitter . It is of little use now that she hate the shadowing ginger curtains of the vast old wooden four - poster ; there must she lie , through all the weary twenty - four hours , in paroxysms of acutest pain , in fits of utter breathlessness , in agonies of thirst . Grief for Jack , love for St. John , shamed concern at Miss Blessington 's damaging story and insulting words , are all swallowed up in the consuming craving for something to wet her parched lips , to cool her dry throat — something to drink ! something to drink ! By - and - by , with the pain , she becomes light - headed — wanders a little — "
167667	168085	167299	167299	you	0	" babbles to the uninterested ears of the sleepy tired nurse , of the twisted seat under the old cherry - tree , of the tea - roses up the kitchen - garden walk , of the yellow chickens in the rickyard . Then her delirium grows wilder : the green flabby Cupids on the walls come down out of the tapestry , and make at her . One , that is riding on a lion and blowing a horn , with fat cheeks puffed out , comes riding at her — riding up the bed - quilt , riding over her . Then the black and gold cocks on the old japan - chest , that , with neck - feathers ruffled , and heads lowered , stand ever , in act to fight , change their attitude : come pecking , pecking at her — pecking at her eyes ; and she , with terrified hands stretched out , fights at them — thrusts them away . And it comes to pass , that there falls a day when these sick fancies pass — when the pain and breathlessness pass — and when Esther lies in utter exhaustion , weak as a day - old babe , whiter than any Annunciation lily , between her sheets . Eyes and ears and power of touch are still hers : but it seems as though all objects of sensation , of sight and sound and touch , reach her only through a thick blanket . She can see , as if at an immense distance off , shrouded in mist , the faces of doctor and nurse as they lean over her , and then , turning away , whisper together . She can not hear what they say ; she has no wish to hear — she has no wish for anything ; only she lies , staring , with great eyes , straight before her at the bed - hangings , at the ceiling , at the little countless pigeon - holes in her toilet - table . One of the windows is open ; and heaven 's sweet breath circulates fresh and slow through the quiet room . It is Sunday ; the village people are clustering about the church - door ; the violets , like blue eyes that have slept through winter 's night , are opening under the churchyard wall . The bells are ringing ; now , loud and clear — "
168096	168288	168289	168289	My	0	" almost as if they were being rung in the still chamber itself — they come ; now , faint and far ; the wind has caught the sound in his rough hand , and carried it otherwhither . Whether they ring loud or faint , whether they ring or ring not at all , she has no care ; she has no care for anything . She is very weary : it seems as if there were but a faint life - spark left in her ; she can scarce lift her hand to her head . Now and then they raise her up , and , without asking her consent , pour brandy and beef - tea down her reluctant throat . She is so tired ! Oh ! why can not they leave her alone ! The slow hours roll themselves round ; the people have gone into church , and have come out again . Mr. Brand is here still ; he is entering at the door ; he is leaning over her . What can he have to say that he must needs look so solemn over "
168294	168317	168291	168292	Miss Craven	164	" he begins , with slow distinctness , as if he imagined that her illness had carried away her powers of hearing , "
168331	168352	168356	168356	her	164	" Mr. Winter is the meek M.A. , whose voice the old squire drowns . She fixes her great eyes , "
168359	168377	168378	168378	I	0	" upon his face — wondering as a child 's just opened upon this strange green world . "
168384	168408	168378	168378	I	0	" she asks , in a faint astonished whisper . She can not speak above a whisper . The good man looks embarrassed . "
168414	168420	168378	168378	I	0	" he says , indirectly . "
168424	168425	168422	168422	I	0	" "

168487	168494	168447	168447	they	3343	" he says , very gravely , "
168539	168578	168591	168591	you	164	" Through the thick veil of her weakness and its attendant apathy pierces the sting of that awful news : her eyes dilate in their horror and fear , and she falls to weeping , feebly and helplessly . "
168613	168614	168615	168615	We	3345	" "
168623	168678	168615	168615	We	3345	" says the doctor , a little tritely . It is so easy to submit to God 's will towards one 's friends and acquaintance . She does not answer , but raises her hands with difficulty to her wasted face , while the tears trickle hot and frequent through that poor white shield . "
168692	168731	168732	168732	Thou	3346	" inquires Mr. Brand , not unkindly ; stooping over her , rather moved , but not very much so . Often before has it been his portion to say , to youth and maid and stalwart man , "

168743	168750	168738	168738	I	0	" she answers , almost inaudibly . "

168851	168857	168802	168802	you	0	" he answers , slowly ; "

168975	169040	168958	168959	Mr. Gerard	247	" He looks at her in astonishment , with a half - suspicion that she is light - headed ; but her eyes look back at him with such perfect sanity in their clear depths , that he must needs abandon that idea . He can not choose but undertake her commission at her bidding . And St. John comes . They are singing the "

There comes no greeting blush now into her cheeks — the cheeks , that the sound of his far - off footfall had been wo nt to redden . How can she , that is the affianced of great Death , blush for any mortal lover ? Her eyes lift themselves languidly to his face ; and , even in the "

169219	169254	169215	169215	they	3351	" she says , whisperingly — says it simply and mournfully . Gerard can not answer ; only he flings himself forward upon the bed , and devours her thin hand with miserable kisses . "
169272	169306	169269	169270	St. John	164	" she says , falling to weeping ; in her feebleness and great dread of that goal to which all our highways and byways and field - paths lead : Still no answer . "
169315	169354	169309	169309	they	3351	" she asks piteously . He lifts his head ; and in his eyes — the eyes that have not wept more than twice since he was a little white - frocked child — stand heavy burning tears . "
169363	169373	169359	169359	I	0	" he answers , in a rough choked voice . "

169486	169518	169480	169480	I	0	" His features contract in the agony of that moment ; an overpowering temptation assails him , to tell her some pleasant falsehood about her state ; but he resists it . "

169553	169554	169543	169543	you	0	" "
169557	169558	169543	169543	you	0	" "
169559	169576	169480	169480	I	0	Then"—essaying to raise herself in the bed , and reaching out her slight , weary arms to him—"then
169583	169635	169580	169581	St. John	164	" Without a word he gathers her to his breast ; fully understanding , in his riven heart , that this embrace , which she herself can ask for , must indeed be a final one ; his lips cling to hers in the wild silence of a solemn last farewell . "
169647	169768	169639	169639	you	3355	" she whispers , almost inaudibly ; and then her arms slacken their clasp about his bronzed neck , and her head droops heavy and inert on his shoulder . And so they find them half an hour later : he , like one crazed , with a face as ashen - white as her own , clasping a lifeless woman to his breast . LIFELESS ! Yes ! But there are two kinds of lifelessness : one from which there is no back - coming — one from which there is . Esther 's is the latter . Although a member of that fraternity whose province it is to kill and to make alive has sapiently said of her , "
169779	169786	169787	169787	She	3356	" Mother Nature has made answer , "
169804	170092	169798	169798	She	3356	" And Esther lives . For many days , it is hard to predicate of her whether she be dead or alive ; so faintly does the wave of life heave to and fro in her breast — so lowly does life 's candle burn . But though the candle burn low , it is not blown out . By - and - bye strength gathers itself again , and comes back to pulse and vein and limb . At seventeen life holds us so fast in his embrace that he will hardly let us go . To the sick child there come sweet sleeps ; there comes a desire for food — a pleasure in the dusty sunbeam streaming through the window — in the mote playing up and down on ceiling and wall . I marvel will the bliss of spirits at the Resurrection dawn , feeling the clothing of pure new bodies , surpass the delight that attends the renewal of the old body at the uprising from a great sickness ? The blanket that hung between Esther and all objects of sensation is withdrawn : full consciousness returns , and remembrance ; and in their company , untold shame — shame at not having died ! The celandine 's greenish buds are unclosing into little brazen wide - awake flowers in the hedge - banks : the crocuses in the garden - borders hold up their gold chalices to catch the gentle February rain and the mild February sunbeams ; in the wood - hollows the mercury — spring 's earliest herald — flourishes , thick and frequent , its stout green shoots . About the meadows , small gawky lambs make a feeble "
170101	170412	169798	169798	She	3356	" It is drawing towards sundown . The window is open ; and near it , on a beech bough , a thrush sits , singing a loud sweet even - song . Esther has been fully dressed for the first time , and has been moved into an adjoining dressing - room . In the small change of scene , there is , to her , intense delight — delight even in the changed pattern on the walls , in the different shape of the chairs — even in the brass handles of the old oak chest of drawers . Every power seems new and fresh — every sensation exquisitely keen ; in every exercise of sight and sound and touch there is conscious joy . She has been amusing herself making little tests of her strength . She lifts a book that lies on the table beside her ; it is small and light , but to her it seems over - heavy ; she has to take two hands to it . She makes a pilgrimage from her arm - chair to the window — she has to catch at the wall , at the furniture , for support ; but she gets there at last , and , sitting down on the window - seat , looks out at the quiet sky , blackened with home - coming rooks — at the pool made flame - red by the westering sun — at the peeping roof of the distant deer - barn . That little bit of roof brings a flood of recollections to her , and first and foremost amongst them stands St. John and her last interview with him . Although she is quite alone , a torrent of red invades cheeks and throat and brow , even to the roots of her hair . "
170418	170430	170431	170431	I	0	" she says to herself , with a sort of gasp ; "
170454	170521	170451	170451	him	3357	" Then she falls to thinking about him : whether he is still in the house ? whether he has made up his differences with Miss Blessington ? whether he is very joyful at her own recovery ? whether he is not penetrated with the ridiculousness of her impressive leave - taking , which , after all — oh bathos!—was no leave - taking at all ? "
170530	170540	170522	170522	He	3357	" she says , twisting her hands nervously together . "
170583	170754	170756	170756	you	3359	" Aye , whither , Miss Craven ? There are but two alternatives for her — the Union and Plas Berwyn . She must swallow her pride , and return to the Brandons : to the long prayers ; to the half - past six tea and bread and scrape ; to the three bits of bacon at breakfast ; and to the perusal of the Record and the Rock : she must induce Mrs. Brandon again to advertise for a situation in a pious family . This morning 's post has brought her four pages of doctrine , reproof , and instruction from Miss Bessy , and , lurking within them , has come a short , sweet , metrical prayer , adapted to every Christian 's daily use : There is no time like the present ; she will write now . She has drawn paper and pens towards her , when the door opens , and her friend the housemaid enters . Doctor and nurse have fled , "
170771	170777	170778	170778	I	0	" She looks up astonished . "
170800	170801	170802	170803	Mr. Gerard	247	" "
170815	170816	170802	170803	Mr. Gerard	247	" "
170833	171077	170830	170830	he	247	" replies the girl , stammering hopelessly . Miss Craven looks rather small , and excessively childish , sunk in her huge elbow - chair ; a white wrapper envelopes her figure ; her hair , which she has not taken the trouble to dress properly , is twisted up in the loosest , unfashionablest , sweetest great knot at the back of her neck ; while a cherry - coloured ribbon coquettishly snoods her noble small head : the innocentest , freshest , shyest rosebud - face , and the liquidest southern eyes , complete the picture . St. John apparently treads hard upon the heels of the messenger , for , before permission is well accorded him , he is in his mistress 's presence . Upon his brown face is untold gladness — in his eyes enormous love ; and in them lurks also a look of half - malicious , half - tender mirth . She rises , and then sits down again , in unutterable confusion ; and at length holds out her hand with distant diffidence to him , while as intense a blush as ever made mortal woman call upon the hills to cover her , bathes every inch of her that is visible . Her cheeks feel like gigantic red globes ; over which her eyes have difficulty in looking . His eyes , laughing , pitiless , yet impassioned , refuse to leave her . "
171095	171137	171093	171093	Essie	180	" he says , with an enraging smile of passionate triumph . She turns away her head , and covers her face with both hands ; but , in the interstices between her fingers , the lovely carnation blazes manifestly vivid . "
171147	171156	171093	171093	Essie	180	" she murmurs , in a stifled voice . "
171164	171187	171093	171093	Essie	180	" he says quietly , smiling still ; and so kneels down on the floor beside her . But she only murmurs , "
171200	171240	171245	171245	Essie	180	" — the words coming half - broken , half lost , from behind the covering of her hands . He puts up his , and tries to draw away the screen from her shamed discomfited face , saying , "
171247	171259	171245	171245	Essie	180	" But she , with all her feeble strength , resists . "
171265	171271	171245	171245	Essie	180	" she cries , vehemently ; "
171305	171306	171302	171302	they	3362	" "
171320	171380	171316	171316	they	3362	" he answers , gravely ; and so , with one final effort , he being strong , and she being weak , he obtains possession of her two hands , and her face lies bare , unshaded — dyed with an agony of shame — clothed with great beauty — under the hungry tenderness of his happy eyes . "
171400	171417	171316	171316	they	3362	" she says , in torments of confusion , yet unable to restrain an uneasy laugh . "
171439	171440	171316	171316	they	3362	" "
171452	171481	171316	171316	they	3362	" he replies , gaily , unable to resist the exquisite pleasure of teasing her . She turns from him with a petulant movement of head and shoulder . "
171488	171500	171501	171501	I	0	" she cries , the angry tears flashing into her eyes ; "
171508	171515	171516	171516	Essie	180	" At that he grows grave . "
171518	171541	171516	171516	Essie	180	" he says , slipping his arms round her as she sits , shrinking away from him in the deep chintz chair , "
171601	171602	171603	171603	I	0	" "
171614	171620	171610	171610	I	0	" she answers , ruefully . "
171629	171630	171610	171610	I	0	" "
171644	171697	171610	171610	I	0	" he says , his mirth swallowed up in great solemn joy . She has fallen forwards into his embrace ; he holds her little trembling form against his heart — a posture to which she submits , chiefly because it affords her an opportunity of hiding her face upon his shoulder . "
171702	171737	171738	171739	St. John	164	" she repeats , mechanically , and then there is silence , save for the thrush , that trills ever his high tender lay . Presently Essie stirs , and whispers , with uneasiness , "
171741	171742	171738	171739	St. John	164	" "
171745	171746	171738	171739	St. John	164	" "
171757	171758	171755	171755	you	0	" "
171803	171804	171807	171807	I	0	" "
171827	171843	171844	171844	Esther	148	" This is the nearest approach she can bear to make to the abhorred theme . "
171846	171847	171844	171844	Esther	148	" "
171858	171859	171849	171849	you	0	" "
171867	171868	171849	171849	you	0	" "
171881	171882	171870	171870	you	0	" "
171894	171895	171885	171885	you	0	" "
171899	171905	171885	171885	you	0	" she answers , laughing ; "
171922	171923	171885	171885	you	0	" "
171929	171952	171885	171885	you	0	" he cries , passionately kissing her sweet shy lips , as one that can never be satiated with their tender warmth , "
171993	172003	171980	171980	Essie	514	" And Essie , obedient , murmurs after him , "
172010	172215	171980	171980	Essie	514	" And so it comes to pass that in the sweet spring weather , when the ground is a carpet of strewn cherry - blooms , when the cows stand knee - deep in buttercups , and the brake - fern is uncrumpling its tender fronds , the church - bells ring out , and they two are we d. And the sun , that shines down on the bravery of the wedding pomp , as bride and groom pace by , shines also hotlier , with a more brazen sickly glare , on a soldier 's grave , over which , three days ago , his comrades fired the parting volley on Bermuda 's sultry shore . The name of the soldier to whom Heaven has granted his discharge is Robert Brandon . Esther Gerard may spare her remorse now ; treachery of hers can wound that loyal heart , on which the worm feeds sweetly , never more ! Not unknowing of the good fortune of the woman he had so madly , miserably , nobly loved , has he passed away . In his poor schoolboy scrawl he had written her a little simple , badly - worded note , bidding , "
