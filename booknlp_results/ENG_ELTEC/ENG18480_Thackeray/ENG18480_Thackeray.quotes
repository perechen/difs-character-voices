537	638	524	525	Miss Pinkerton	629	“ MADAM — After her six years ’ residence at the Mall , I have the honour and happiness of presenting Miss Amelia Sedley to her parents , as a young lady not unworthy to occupy a fitting position in their polished and refined circle . Those virtues which characterise the young English gentlewoman , those accomplishments which become her birth and station , will not be found wanting in the amiable Miss Sedley , whose industry and obedience have endeared her to her instructors , and whose delightful sweetness of temper has charmed her aged and her youthful companions . “
724	795	796	797	P.S.—Miss Sharp	638	“ In the principles of religion and morality , Miss Sedley will be found worthy of an establishment which has been honoured by the presence of The Great Lexicographer , and the patronage of the admirable Mrs. Chapone . In leaving the Mall , Miss Amelia carries with her the hearts of her companions , and the affectionate regards of her mistress , who has the honour to subscribe herself , “

944	1030	915	916	Miss Sedley	632	“ In music , in dancing , in orthography , in every variety of embroidery and needle - work , she will be found to have realised her friends ’ fondest wishes . In geography there is still much to be desired ; and a careful and undeviating use of the backboard , for four hours daily during the next three years , is recommended as necessary to the acquirement of that dignified deportment and carriage , so requisite for every young lady of fashion . “
1101	1148	1090	1091	her mistress	15345	“ P.S.—Miss Sharp accompanies Miss Sedley . It is particularly requested that Miss Sharp ’s stay in Russell Square may not exceed ten days . The family of distinction with whom she is engaged , desire to avail themselves of her services as soon as possible . ”

1397	1422	1389	1390	Miss Pinkerton	629	“ Are you in your senses ? Replace the Dixonary in the closet , and never venture to take such a liberty in future . ”
1423	1450	1364	1364	she	629	“ Well , sister , it ’s only two - and - ninepence , and poor Becky will be miserable if she do n’t get one . ”

3880	3889	3892	3892	she	2185	“ How could you do so , Rebecca ? ”
3899	3920	3922	3922	Rebecca	639	“ Why , do you think Miss Pinkerton will come out and order me back to the black - hole ? ”
3926	3932	3922	3922	Rebecca	639	“ No : but — — ”
3933	3940	3942	3943	Miss Sharp	639	“ I hate the whole house , ”
3948	4028	3942	3943	Miss Sharp	639	“ I hope I may never set eyes on it again . I wish it were in the bottom of the Thames , I do ; and if Miss Pinkerton were there , I would n’t pick her out , that I would n’t . O how I should like to see her floating in the water yonder , turban and all , with her train streaming after her , and her nose like the beak of a wherry . ”
4029	4032	4034	4035	Miss Sedley	632	“ Hush ! ”
4037	4047	4049	4050	Miss Rebecca	639	“ Why , will the black footman tell tales ? ”
4054	4224	4049	4050	Miss Rebecca	639	“ He may go back and tell Miss Pinkerton that I hate her with all my soul ; and I wish he would ; and I wish I had a means of proving it , too . For two years I have only had insults and outrage from her . I have been treated worse than any servant in the kitchen . I have never had a friend or a kind word , except from you . I have been made to tend the little girls in the lower schoolroom , and to talk French to the Misses , until I grew sick of my mother - tongue . But that talking French to Miss Pinkerton was capital fun , was n’t it ? She does n’t know a word of French , and was too proud to confess it . I believe it was that which made her part with me ; and so thank Heaven for French . Vive la France ! Vive l’Empereur ! Vive Bonaparte ! ”
4225	4234	4236	4237	Miss Sedley	632	“ O Rebecca , Rebecca , for shame ! ”
4262	4267	4049	4050	Miss Rebecca	639	“ Long live Bonaparte ! ”
4275	4280	4049	4050	Miss Rebecca	639	“ Long live Lucifer ! ”
4281	4296	4049	4050	Miss Rebecca	639	“ How can you — how dare you have such wicked , revengeful thoughts ? ”
4297	4308	4310	4311	Miss Rebecca	639	“ Revenge may be wicked , but it ’s natural , ”
4313	4319	4310	4311	Miss Rebecca	639	“ I ’m no angel . ”
6133	6151	6152	6152	she	639	“ What airs that girl gives herself , because she is an Earl ’s grand - daughter , ”
6157	6251	6152	6152	she	639	“ How they cringe and bow to that Creole , because of her hundred thousand pounds ! I am a thousand times cleverer and more charming than that creature , for all her wealth . I am as well bred as the Earl ’s grand - daughter , for all her fine pedigree ; and yet every one passes me by here . And yet , when I was at my father ’s , did not the men give up their gayest balls and parties in order to pass the evening with me ? ”
6427	6438	6439	6439	Rebecca	639	“ I am here to speak French with the children , ”
6443	6466	6439	6439	Rebecca	639	“ not to teach them music , and save money for you . Give me money , and I will teach them . ”
6484	6493	6494	6494	she	643	“ For five - and - thirty years , ”
6502	6530	6494	6494	she	643	“ I never have seen the individual who has dared in my own house to question my authority . I have nourished a viper in my bosom . ”
6531	6538	6540	6541	Miss Sharp	639	“ A viper — a fiddlestick , ”
6552	6594	6540	6541	Miss Sharp	639	“ You took me because I was useful . There is no question of gratitude between us . I hate this place , and want to leave it . I will do nothing here but what I am obliged to do . ”
6637	6645	6647	6648	the girl	2155	“ Give me a sum of money , ”
6650	6685	6647	6648	the girl	2155	“ and get rid of me — or , if you like better , get me a good place as governess in a noblesman ’s family — you can do so if you please . ”
6698	6716	6691	6691	she	2155	“ Get me a situation — we hate each other , and I am ready to go . ”
6863	6870	6871	6871	she	629	“ I can not , certainly , ”
6874	6923	6871	6871	she	629	“ find fault with Miss Sharp ’s conduct , except to myself ; and must allow that her talents and accomplishments are of a high order . As far as the head goes , at least , she does credit to the educational system pursued at my establishment . ”

7579	7603	7577	7577	Amelia	632	“ you know , Rebecca , I shall always be your friend , and love you as a sister — indeed I will . ”
7604	7681	7682	7682	Amelia	632	“ Ah , but to have parents , as you have — kind , rich , affectionate parents , who give you everything you ask for ; and their love , which is more precious than all ! My poor papa could give me nothing , and I had but two frocks in all the world ! And then , to have a brother , a dear brother ! Oh , how you must love him ! ”
7685	7702	7682	7682	Amelia	632	“ What ! do n’t you love him ? you , who say you love everybody ? ”
7703	7714	7577	7577	Amelia	632	“ Yes , of course , I do — only — ”
7715	7719	7682	7682	Amelia	632	“ Only what ? ”
7720	7779	7682	7682	Amelia	632	“ Only Joseph does n’t seem to care much whether I love him or not . He gave me two fingers to shake when he arrived after ten years ’ absence ! He is very kind and good , but he scarcely ever speaks to me ; I think he loves his pipe a great deal better than his ”
7797	7808	7809	7809	she	632	“ He was very kind to me as a child , ”
7812	7824	7809	7809	she	632	“ I was but five years old when he went away . ”
7825	7832	7834	7834	Rebecca	639	“ Is n’t he very rich ? ”
7836	7846	7834	7834	Rebecca	639	“ They say all Indian nabobs are enormously rich . ”
7847	7857	7809	7809	she	632	“ I believe he has a very large income . ”
7858	7872	7809	7809	she	632	“ And is your sister - in - law a nice pretty woman ? ”
7873	7881	7883	7883	Amelia	632	“ La ! Joseph is not married , ”
7957	7970	7972	7972	Amelia	632	“ I think you must have had enough of them at Chiswick , ”
8071	8105	8107	8107	she	639	this:—“If Mr. Joseph Sedley is rich and unmarried , why should I not marry him ? I have only a fortnight , to be sure , but there is no harm in trying . ”
8194	8205	8207	8207	she	639	“ Feel my heart , how it beats , dear ! ”
8212	8219	8221	8221	Amelia	632	“ No , it does n’t , ”

8925	8934	8766	8766	he	2399	“ But in this dress it ’s impossible . ”
8935	8952	8766	8766	he	2399	“ Look at him , is n’t he handsome enough to dine anywhere , Miss Sharp ? ”
8984	9000	9002	9002	he	2402	“ Did you ever see a pair of buckskins like those at Miss Pinkerton ’s ? ”
9009	9015	9017	9017	Joseph	674	“ Gracious heavens ! Father , ”
9019	9075	9017	9017	Joseph	674	“ There now , I have hurt his feelings . Mrs. Sedley , my dear , I have hurt your son ’s feelings . I have alluded to his buckskins . Ask Miss Sharp if I have n’t ? Come , Joseph , be friends with Miss sharp and let us all go to dinner . ”

11245	11283	11230	11230	she	639	“ I ought to have remembered the pepper which the Princess of Persia puts in the cream - tarts in the Arabian Nights . Do you put cayenne into your cream - tarts in India , sir ? ”

11406	11560	11401	11401	Joe	674	“ I recollect , sir , there was a girl at Dumdum , a daughter of Cutler of the Artillery , and afterwards married to Lance , the surgeon , who made a dead set at me in the year ’ 4 — at me and Mulligatawney , whom I mentioned to you before dinner — a devilish good fellow , Mulligatawney — he ’s a magistrate at Budgebudge , and sure to be in council in five years . Well , sir , the Artillery gave a ball , and Quintin , of the King ’s 14th , said to me , ‘ Sedley , ’ said he , ‘ I bet you thirteen to ten that Sophy Cutler hooks either you or Mulligatawney before the rains . ’ ‘ Done , ’ says I ; and egad , sir — this claret ’s very good . Adamson ’s or Carbonell ’s ? ”

11845	11850	11852	11852	Amelia	632	“ There goes Joseph , ”
11875	11883	11885	11886	Mrs. Sedley	630	“ Miss Sharp has frightened him away , ”
11888	11899	11885	11886	Mrs. Sedley	630	“ Poor Joe , why will he be so shy ? ”
12005	12033	12041	12041	Heaven	659	“ What ! you who have shown the poor orphan what happiness and love are for the first time in her life — quit you ? never ! ”
12146	12149	12141	12141	she	639	“ Sir , ”
12151	12155	12141	12141	she	639	“ Mr. Sambo , ”
12278	12307	12263	12267	the good - natured girl	2543	“ You know , her father was our drawing - master , Mamma , at Chiswick , and used to do all the best parts of our drawings . ”
12308	12333	12263	12267	the good - natured girl	2543	“ My love ! I ’m sure I always heard Miss Pinkerton say that he did not touch them — he only mounted them . ”
12334	12374	12263	12267	the good - natured girl	2543	“ It was called mounting , Mamma . Rebecca remembers the drawing , and her father working at it , and the thought of it came upon her rather suddenly — and so , you know , she — — ”
12375	12383	12385	12386	Mrs. Sedley	630	“ The poor child is all heart , ”
12388	12399	12401	12401	Amelia	632	“ I wish she could stay with us another week , ”
12403	12450	12401	12401	Amelia	632	“ She ’s devilish like Miss Cutler that I used to meet at Dumdum , only fairer . She ’s married now to Lance , the Artillery Surgeon . Do you know , Ma’am , that once Quintin , of the 14th , bet me — — ”
12451	12459	12461	12461	Amelia	632	“ O Joseph we know that story , ”
12465	12498	12461	12461	Amelia	632	“ Never mind about telling that , but persuade Mamma to write to Sir Something Crawley for leave of absence for poor dear Rebecca:—here she comes , her eyes red with weeping . ”
12499	12506	12508	12509	the girl	2155	“ I ’m better , now , ”
12531	12542	12543	12543	she	2155	“ How kind you all are to me ! All , ”
12550	12557	12543	12543	she	2155	“ except you , Mr. Joseph . ”
12558	12561	12563	12563	Joseph	674	“ Me ! ”
12570	12580	12563	12563	Joseph	674	“ Gracious Heavens ! Good Gad ! Miss Sharp ! ”
12581	12622	12543	12543	she	2155	“ Yes ; how could you be so cruel as to make me eat that horrid pepper - dish at dinner , the first day I ever saw you ? You are not so good to me as dear Amelia . ”
12623	12632	12634	12634	Amelia	632	“ He does n’t know you so well , ”
12636	12650	12634	12634	Amelia	632	“ I defy anybody not to be good to you , my dear , ”
12655	12665	12667	12667	Joe	674	“ The curry was capital ; indeed it was , ”
12672	12689	12667	12667	Joe	674	“ Perhaps there was not enough citron juice in it : no , there was not . ”
12690	12695	12634	12634	Amelia	632	“ And the chilis ? ”
12696	12707	12709	12709	Joe	674	“ By Jove , how they made you cry out ! ”
12734	12749	12751	12751	Rebecca	639	“ I shall take care how I let you choose for me another time , ”
12761	12777	12751	12751	Rebecca	639	“ I did n’t think men were fond of putting poor harmless girls to pain . ”
12778	12794	12812	12812	she	639	“ By Gad , Miss Rebecca , I would n’t hurt you for the world . ”
12795	12798	12800	12800	she	639	“ No , ”
12802	12809	12800	12800	she	639	“ I know you would n’t ; ”
13089	13092	13094	13094	Joseph	674	“ Egad ! ”
13102	13117	13094	13094	Joseph	674	“ I exactly begin to feel as I did at Dumdum with Miss Cutler . ”
13214	13222	13224	13224	she	632	holidays—“When I was a girl at school , ”
13241	13244	13245	13245	she	632	“ Now , ”
13248	13261	13245	13245	she	632	“ that Rebecca is with us , will be the very time . ”
13262	13267	13269	13269	Rebecca	639	“ O , delightful ! ”
13294	13303	13305	13305	Joe	674	“ To - night is not the night , ”
13307	13314	13305	13305	Joe	674	“ Well , to - morrow . ”
13315	13326	13328	13329	Mrs. Sedley	630	“ To - morrow your Papa and I dine out , ”
13331	13345	13347	13348	her husband	2573	“ You do n’t suppose that I ’m going , Mrs. Sed . ? ”
13350	13372	13347	13348	her husband	2573	“ and that a woman of your years and size is to catch cold , in such an abominable damp place ? ”
13373	13383	13385	13386	Mrs. Sedley	630	“ The children must have some one with them , ”
13388	13393	13395	13396	his father	2492	“ Let Joe go , ”
13400	13406	13395	13396	his father	2492	“ He ’s big enough . ”
13433	13438	13440	13443	the pitiless old gentleman	2576	“ Undo his stays ! ”
13445	13482	13440	13443	the pitiless old gentleman	2576	“ Fling some water in his face , Miss Sharp , or carry him upstairs : the dear creature ’s fainting . Poor victim ! carry him up ; he ’s as light as a feather ! ”
13483	13495	13497	13497	Joseph	674	“ If I stand this , I ’m d — — ! ”
13499	13508	13510	13511	the father	2261	“ Order Mr. Jos ’s elephant , Sambo ! ”
13513	13522	13510	13511	the father	2261	“ Send to Exeter ’ Change , Sambo ; ”
13551	13594	13545	13545	his	2578	“ It ’s all fair on the Stock Exchange , Jos,—and , Sambo . never mind the elephant , but give me and Mr. Jos a glass of Champagne . Boney himself has n’t got such in his cellar , my boy ! ”
13633	13642	13644	13646	the old gentleman	2402	“ The girls must have a gentleman apiece , ”
13648	13683	13644	13646	the old gentleman	2402	“ Jos will be sure to leave Emmy in the crowd , he will be so taken up with Miss Sharp here . Send to 96 and ask George Osborne if he ’ll come . ”
13780	13788	13790	13791	her father	2228	“ Amelia had better write a note , ”
13793	13838	13790	13791	her father	2228	“ and let George Osborne see what a beautiful hand - writing we have brought back from Miss Pinkerton ’s . Do you remember when you wrote to him to come on Twelfth - night , Emmy , and spelt twelfth without the f ? ”
13839	13845	13847	13847	Amelia	632	“ That was years ago , ”
13849	13861	13863	13864	Mrs. Sedley	630	“ It seems like yesterday , do n’t it , John ? ”
13985	13996	13998	13998	she	630	“ It was quite wicked of you , Mr. Sedley , ”
14000	14008	13998	13998	she	630	“ to torment the poor boy so . ”
14009	14013	14022	14022	his	2573	“ My dear , ”
14025	14078	14022	14022	his	2573	“ Jos is a great deal vainer than you ever were in your life , and that ’s saying a good deal . Though , some thirty years ago , in the year seventeen hundred and eighty — what was it?—perhaps you had a right to be vain.—I do n’t say no . “
14227	14228	14229	14229	She	2601	” “
14242	14251	14237	14240	the little artful creature	2602	” said Mrs. Sedley , with great energy . “
14286	14740	14284	14284	himself	674	” And presently the voices of the two speakers were hushed , or were replaced by the gentle but unromantic music of the nose ; and save when the church bells tolled the hour and the watchman called it , all was silent at the house of John Sedley , Esquire . of Russell Square , and the Stock Exchange . When morning came , the good - natured Mrs. Sedley no longer thought of executing her threats with regard to Miss Sharp ; for though nothing is more keen , nor more common , nor more justifiable , than maternal jealousy , yet she could not bring herself to suppose that the little , humble , grateful , gentle governess , would dare to look up to such a magnificent personage as the Collector of Boggley Wollah . The petition , too , for an extension of the young lady ’s leave of absence had already been despatched , and it would be difficult to find a pretext for abruptly dismissing her . And as if all things conspired in favour of the gentle Rebecca , the very elements ( although she was not inclined at first to acknowledge their action in her behalf ) interposed to aid her . For on the evening appointed for the Vauxhall party , George Osborne having come to dinner , and the elders of the house having departed , according to invitation , to dine with Alderman Balls , at Highbury Barn , there came on such a thunder - storm as only happens on Vauxhall nights , and as obliged the young people , perforce , to remain at home . Mr. Osborne did not seem in the least disappointed at this occurrence . He and Joseph Sedley drank a fitting quantity of port - wine , tête - à - tête , in the dining - room,—during the drinking of which Sedley told a number of his best Indian stories ; for he was extremely talkative in man ’s society;—and afterwards Miss Amelia Sedley did the honours of the drawing - room ; and these four young persons passed such a comfortable evening together , that they declared they were rather glad of the thunder - storm than otherwise , which had caused them to put off their visit to Vauxhall . Osborne was Sedley ’s godson , and had been one of the family any time these three - and - twenty years . At six weeks old , he had received from John Sedley a present of a silver cup ; at six months old , a coral with gold whistle and bells ; from his youth , upwards , he was “
14742	14811	14813	14813	you	2604	” regularly by the old gentleman at Christmas : and on going back to school , he remembered perfectly well being thrashed by Joseph Sedley , when the latter was a big , swaggering , hobbadyhoy , and George an impudent urchin of ten years old . In a word George was as familiar with the family as such daily acts of kindness and intercourse could make him . “
14869	14887	14853	14853	her	632	” Jos remembered this remarkable circumstance perfectly well , but vowed that he had totally forgotten it . “
14956	14957	14989	14989	I	0	” “
14974	14984	14961	14962	Mr. Sedley	674	” exclaimed Rebecca , in accents of extreme delight . “
15011	15012	15013	15013	I	0	” “
15019	15060	15061	15062	Miss Sharp	639	” said Rebecca . Jos Sedley , who admired his own legs prodigiously , and always wore this ornamental chaussure , was extremely pleased at this remark , though he drew his legs under his chair as it was made . “
15064	15069	15061	15062	Miss Sharp	639	” said George Osborne , “
15157	15158	15159	15159	I	0	” “
15169	15173	15159	15159	I	0	” said Rebecca . “
15185	15219	15174	15174	I	0	” And she dropped her voice , and looked so sad and piteous , that everybody felt how cruel her lot was , and how sorry they would be to part with her . “
15230	15234	15228	15228	Rebecca	639	” said Amelia . “
15237	15246	15228	15228	Rebecca	639	” answered the other , still more sadly . “
15261	15337	15228	15228	Rebecca	639	” And she turned away her head . Amelia began to give way to that natural infirmity of tears which , we have said , was one of the defects of this silly little thing . George Osborne looked at the two young women with a touched curiosity ; and Joseph Sedley heaved something very like a sigh out of his big chest , as he cast his eyes down towards his favourite Hessian boots . “
15349	15573	15347	15347	Amelia	632	” said George , who felt at that moment an extraordinary , almost irresistible impulse to seize the above - mentioned young woman in his arms , and to kiss her in the face of the company ; and she looked at him for a moment , and if I should say that they fell in love with each other at that single instant of time , I should perhaps be telling an untruth , for the fact is , that these two young people had been bred up by their parents for this very purpose , and their banns had , as it were , been read in their respective families any time these ten years . They went off to the piano , which was situated , as pianos usually are , in the back drawing - room ; and as it was rather dark , Miss Amelia , in the most unaffected way in the world , put her hand into Mr. Osborne ’s , who , of course , could see the way among the chairs and ottomans a great deal better than she could . But this arrangement left Mr. Joseph Sedley tête - à - tête with Rebecca . at the drawing - room table , where the latter was occupied in knitting a green silk purse . “
15583	15588	15589	15590	Those two	2613	” said Miss Sharp . “
15595	15596	15589	15590	Those two	2613	” “
15605	15609	15589	15590	Those two	2613	” said Joseph , “
15624	15625	15620	15622	a capital fellow	2615	” “
15636	15640	15642	15646	the man who wins her	2619	” said Rebecca . “
15648	16003	15642	15646	the man who wins her	2619	” With this Miss Sharp gave a great sigh . When two unmarried persons get together , and talk upon such delicate subjects as the present , a great deal of confidence and intimacy is presently established between them . There is no need of giving a special report of the conversation , which now took place between Mr. Sedley and the young lady ; for the conversation , as may be judged from the foregoing specimen , was not especially witty or eloquent ; it seldom is in private societies , or any where except in very high - flown and ingenious novels . As there was music in the next room , the talk was carried on , of course , in a low and becoming tone , though , for the matter of that , the couple in the next apartment would not have been disturbed had the talking been so loud , so occupied were they with their own pursuits . Almost for the first time in his life , Mr. Sedley found himself talking , without the least timidity or hesitation , to a person of the other sex . Miss Rebecca asked him a great number of questions about India , which gave him an opportunity of narrating many interesting anecdotes about that country and himself . He described the balls at Government House , and the manner in which they kept themselves cool in the hot weather , with punkahs , tatties , and other contrivances ; and he was very witty regarding the number of Scotchmen whom Lord Minto , the Governor - General , patronised ; and then he described a tiger - hunt ; and the manner in which the mahout of his elephant had been pulled off his seat by one of the infuriated animals . How delighted Miss Rebecca was at the Government balls , and how she laughed at the stories of the Scotch aides - de - camp , and called Mr. Sedley a sad wicked satirical creature ; and how frightened she was at the story of the elephant ! “
16014	16018	16010	16012	dear Mr. Sedley	674	” she said , “
16038	16039	16044	16045	Miss Sharp	639	” “
16047	16055	16044	16045	Miss Sharp	639	” said he pulling up his shirtcollars ; “
16065	16145	16044	16045	Miss Sharp	639	” He had never been but once at a tiger - hunt , when the accident in question occurred , and when he was half killed — not by the tiger , but by the fright . And as he talked on , he grew quite bold , and actually had the audacity to ask Miss Rebecca for whom she was knitting the green silk purse ? He was quite surprised and delighted at his own graceful familiar manner . “
16154	16184	16185	16186	Miss Sharp	639	” replied Miss Rebecca , looking at him in the most gentle winning way . Sedley was going to make one of the most eloquent speeches possible , and had begun—“O
16191	16231	16185	16186	Miss Sharp	639	” when some song which was performed in the other room came to an end , and caused him to hear his own voice so distinctly that he stopped , blushed , and blew his nose in great agitation . “
16243	16250	16185	16186	Miss Sharp	639	” whispered Mr. Osborne to Amelia . “
16259	16260	16253	16254	your friend	15401	” “
16266	16485	16253	16254	your friend	15401	” said Miss Amelia ; who , like almost all women who are worth a pin , was a match - maker in her heart , and would have been delighted that Joseph should carry back a wife to India . She had , too , in the course of this few days ’ constant intercourse , warmed into a most tender friendship for Rebecca , and discovered a million of virtues and amiable qualities in her which she had not perceived when they were at Chiswick together . For the affection of young ladies is of as rapid growth as Jack ’s beanstalk , and reaches up to the sky in a night . It is no blame to them that after marriage this Sehnsucht nach der Liebe subsides . It is what sentimentalists , who deal in very big words , call a yearning after the Ideal , and simply means that women are commonly not satisfied until they have husbands and children on whom they may centre affections , which are spent elsewhere , as it were , in small change . Having expended her little store of songs , or having stayed long enough in the back drawing - room , it now appeared proper to Miss Amelia to ask her friend to sing . “
16494	16511	16486	16486	You	2626	” she said to Mr. Osborne ( though she knew she was telling a fib ) , “
16518	16519	16515	16515	Rebecca	639	” “
16528	16532	16515	16515	Rebecca	639	” said Osborne , “
16551	16552	16553	16553	You	2626	” “
16557	16985	16553	16553	You	2626	” said Amelia ; and Joseph Sedley was actually polite enough to carry the candles to the piano . Osborne hinted that he should like quite as well to sit in the dark ; but Miss Sedley , laughing , declined to bear him company any farther , and the two accordingly followed Mr. Joseph . Rebecca sang far better than her friend ( though of course Osborne was free to keep his opinion ) and exerted herself to the utmost , and , indeed , to the wonder of Amelia , who had never known her perform so well . She sang a French song , which Joseph did not understand in the least , and which George confessed he did not understand , and then a number of those simple ballads which were the fashion forty years ago , and in which British tars , our King , poor Susan , blue - eyed Mary , and the like , were the principal themes . They are not , it is said , very brilliant , in a musical point of view , but contain numberless good - natured , simple appeals to the affections , which people understood better than the milk - and - water lagrime , sospiri , and felicità of the eternal Donizettian music with which we are favoured now - a - days . Conversation of a sentimental sort , befitting the subject , was carried on between the songs , to which Sambo , after he had brought the tea , the delighted cook , and even Mrs. Blenkinsop , the housekeeper , condescended to listen on the landingplace . Among these ditties was one , the last of the concert , and to the following effect : — Ah ! bleak and barren was the moor , Ah ! loud and piercing was the storm , The cottage roof was shelter’d sure , The cottage hearth was bright and warm . An orphan boy the lattice pass’d , And , as he mark’d its cheerful glow , Felt doubly keen the midnight blast , And doubly cold the fallen snow . They mark’d him as he onward prest , With fainting heart and weary limb;Kind voices bade him turn and rest , And gentle faces welcomed him . The dawn is up — the guest is gone , The cottage hearth is blazing still;Heaven pity all poor wanderers lone ! Hark to the wind upon the hill ! It was the sentiment of the before - mentioned words , “
16991	17006	16553	16553	You	2626	” over again . As she came to the last words , Miss Sharp ’s “
17013	17219	16553	16553	You	2626	” Everybody felt the allusion to her departure , and to her hapless orphan state . Joseph Sedley , who was fond of music , and softhearted , was in a state of ravishment during the performance of the song , and profoundly touched at its conclusion . If he had had the courage ; if George and Miss Sedley had remained , according to the former ’s proposal , in the farther room , Joseph Sedley ’s bachelorhood would have been at an end , and this work would never have been written . But at the close of the ditty , Rebecca quitted the piano , and giving her hand to Amelia , walked away into the front drawingroom twilight ; and , at this moment , Mr. Sambo made his appearance with a tray , containing sandwiches , jellies , and some glittering glasses and decanters , on which Joseph Sedley ’s attention was immediately fixed . When the parents of the house of Sedley returned from their dinner - party , they found the young people so busy in talking , that they had not heard the arrival of the carriage , and Mr. Joseph was in the act of saying , “
17243	17244	17222	17223	Miss Sharp	639	” “
17249	17367	17247	17247	Jos	674	” said Mr. Sedley ; on hearing the bantering of which well - known voice , Jos instantly relapsed into an alarmed silence , and quickly took his departure . He did not lie awake all night thinking whether or not he was in love with Miss Sharp ; the passion of love never interfered with the appetite or the slumber of Mr. Joseph Sedley ; but he thought to himself how delightful it would be to hear such songs as those after Cutcherry — what a distinguée girl she was — how she could speak French better than the Governor General ’s lady herself — and what a sensation she would make at the Calcutta balls . “
17380	17384	17385	17385	She	2630	” thought he . “
17412	17487	17401	17401	I	0	” And in these meditations he fell asleep . How Miss Sharp lay awake , thinking , will he come or not to - morrow ? need not be told here . To - morrow came , and , as sure as fate , Mr. Joseph Sedley made his appearance before luncheon . He had never been known to confer such an honour on Russell Square . George Osborne was somehow there already ( sadly “
17490	17744	17745	17745	Bravo	719	” Amelia , who was writing to her twelve dearest friends at Chiswick Mall ) , and Rebecca was employed upon her yesterday ’s work . As Joe ’s buggy drove up , and while , after his usual thundering knock and pompous bustle at the door , the ex - Collector of Boggley Wollah laboured upstairs to the drawing - room , knowing glances were telegraphed between Osborne and Miss Sedley , and the pair , smiling archly , looked at Rebecca , who actually blushed as she bent her fair ringlets over her knitting . How her heart beat as Joseph appeared,—Joseph , puffing from the staircase in shining creaking boots,—Joseph , in a new waistcoat red with heat and nervousness , and blushing behind his wadded neck - cloth . It was a nervous moment for all ; and as for Amelia , I think she was more frightened than even the people most concerned . Sambo , who flung open the door and announced Mr. Joseph , followed grinning , in the Collector ’s rear , and bearing two handsome nosegays of flowers , which the monster had actually had the gallantry to purchase in Covent Garden Market that morning — they were not as big as the haystacks which ladies carry about with them now - a - days , in cones of filigree paper ; but the young women were delighted with the gift , as Joseph presented one to each , with an exceedingly solemn bow . “
17749	17753	17745	17745	Bravo	719	” cried Osborne . “
17760	17805	17755	17755	you	2632	” said Amelia , quite ready to kiss her brother , if he were so minded . ( And I think for a kiss from such a dear creature as Amelia , I would purchase all Mr. Lee ’s conservatories out of hand . ) “
17812	17872	17874	17874	they	2633	” exclaimed Miss Sharp and smelt them delicately , and held them to her bosom , and cast up her eyes to the ceiling , in an ecstasy of admiration . Perhaps she just looked first into the bouquet , to see whether there was a billet - doux hidden among the flowers ; but there was no letter . “
17886	17892	17884	17884	Sedley	632	” asked Osborne , laughing . “
17897	17903	17874	17874	they	2633	” replied the sentimental youth . “
17956	18043	18054	18054	you	2634	” Rebecca said she had never tasted a pine , and longed beyond everything to taste one . So the conversation went on . I do n’t know on what pretext Osborne left the room , or why , presently , Amelia went away , perhaps to superintend the slicing of the pine - apple ; but Jos was left alone with Rebecca , who had resumed her work , and the green silk and the shining needles were quivering rapidly under her white slender fingers . “
18063	18068	18059	18061	dear Miss Sharp	639	” said the Collector . “
18082	18083	18059	18061	dear Miss Sharp	639	” “

18216	18224	18213	18214	Mr. Sedley	674	” said Rebecca , with a sigh . “
18249	18359	18242	18242	you	674	” And before he had time to ask how , Mr. Joseph Sedley , of the East India Company ’s service , was actually seated tête - à - tête with a young lady looking at her with a most killing expression ; his arms stretched out before her in an imploring attitude , and his hands bound in a web of green silk , which she was unwinding . In this romantic position Osborne and Amelia found the interesting pair , when they entered to announce that tiffin was ready . The skein of silk was just wound round the card ; but Mr. Jos had never spoken . “
18371	18398	18369	18369	dear	15415	” Amelia said , as she pressed Rebecca ’s hand ; and Sedley , too , had communed with his soul , and said to himself , “
18410	18523	18369	18369	dear	15415	” CUFF ’S fight with Dobbin , and the unexpected issue of that contest , will long be remembered by every man who was educated at Dr. Swishtail ’s famous school . The latter youth ( who used to be called Heigh - ho Dobbin , Gee - ho Dobbin , and by many other names indicative of puerile contempt ) was the quietest , the clumsiest , and , as it seemed , the dullest of all Dr. Swishtail ’s young gentlemen . His parent was a grocer in the city : and it was bruited abroad that he was admitted into Dr. Swishtail ’s academy upon what are called ‘ mutual principles”—that

There has been a fight here between Cuff & Dobbin . Cuff , you know , was the Cock of the School . They fought thirteen rounds , and Dobbin Licked . So Cuff is now only Second Cock . The fight was about me . Cuff was licking me for breaking a bottle of milk , and Figs would n’t stand it . We call him Figs because his father is a Grocer — Figs & Rudge , Thames St. , City — I think as he fought for me you ought to buy your tea and sugar at his father ’s . Cuff goes home every Saturday , but ca n’t this , because he has 2 Black Eyes . He has a white Pony to come and fetch him , and a groom in livery on a bay mare . I wish my Papa would let me have a Pony , and I am “

Do n’t you remember the catastrophe , Ma’am , seven years ago ? ”

27854	27891	27774	27774	he	3036	“ For thrashing him last night — didn’t he , Dobbin ? You hit out , sir , like Molyneux . The watchman says he never saw a fellow go down so straight . Ask Dobbin . ”

28116	28158	28114	28114	Osborne	709	“ You were terrible ! Why , man , you could n’t stand — you made everybody laugh in the Gardens , though you were crying yourself . You were maudlin , Jos . Do n’t you remember singing a song ? ”
28159	28163	28164	28164	Jos	674	“ A what ? ”
28167	28196	28164	28164	Jos	674	“ A sentimental song , and calling Rosa , Rebecca , what ’s her name , Amelia ’s little friend — your dearest diddle - diddle - darling ? ”
28239	28246	28247	28247	Osborne	709	“ Why should I spare him ? ”
28270	28407	28247	28247	Osborne	709	“ What the deuce right has he to give himself his patronizing airs , and make fools of us at Vauxhall ? Who ’s this little school - girl that is ogling and making love to him ? Hang it , the family ’s low enough already , without her . A governess is all very well , but I ’d rather have a lady for my sister - in - law . I ’m a liberal man ; but I ’ve proper pride , and know my own station : let her know hers . And I ’ll take down that great hectoring Nabob , and prevent him from being made a greater fool than he is . That ’s why I told him to look out , lest she brought an action against him . ”

28911	28944	28906	28906	I	0	” Osborne said ; and as he spoke Miss Sharp began to have a feeling of distrust and hatred towards this young officer , which he was quite unconscious of having inspired . “
28956	28960	28954	28954	he	3071	” thought Rebecca . “
28981	28995	28976	28976	he	3071	”—A film passed over her eyes , and her heart beat quite quick . “
29001	29012	28996	28996	You	0	” said she , smiling as innocently as she could . “
29026	29059	29021	29021	nobody	2167	” And George Osborne , as she walked away — and Amelia looked reprovingly at him — felt some little manly compunction for having inflicted any unnecessary unkindness upon this helpless creature . “
29064	29068	29021	29021	nobody	2167	” said he , “

29170	29375	29162	29162	My	0	” He was off laughing again ; and he did it so drolly that Emmy laughed too . All that day Jos never came . But Amelia had no fear about this ; for the little schemer had actually sent away the page , Mr. Sambo ’s aide - de - camp , to Mr. Joseph ’s lodgings , to ask for some book he had promised , and how he was ; and the reply through Jos ’s man , Mr. Brush , was , that his master was ill in bed and had just had the doctor with him . He must come to - morrow , she thought , but she never had the courage to speak a word on the subject to Rebecca ; nor did that young woman herself allude to it in any way during the whole evening after the night at Vauxhall . The next day , however , as the two young ladies sate on the sofa , pretending to work , or to write letters , or to read novels , Sambo came into the room with his usual engaging grin , with a packet under his arm , and a note on a tray . “
29383	29399	29381	29381	Miss	3081	” says Sambo . How Amelia trembled as she opened it ! So it ran — “
29495	29673	29679	29679	Miss.	778	“ DEAR AMELIA,—I send you the ‘ Orphan of the Forest . ’ I was too ill to come yesterday . I leave town to - day for Cheltenham . Pray excuse me , if you can , to the amiable Miss Sharp , for my conduct at Vauxhall , and entreat her to pardon and forget every word I may have uttered when excited by that fatal supper . As soon as I have recovered , for my health is very much shaken , I shall go to Scotland for some months , and am It was the death - warrant . All was over . Amelia did not dare to look at Rebecca ’s pale face and burning eyes , but she dropt the letter into her friend ’s lap ; and got up , and went up stairs to her room , and cried her little heart out . Blenkinsop , the housekeeper , there sought her presently with consolation , on whose shoulder Amelia wept confidentially , and relieved herself a good deal . “
29747	29748	29737	29737	she	3087	” “
29759	29776	29754	29754	I	0	” Amelia said . But this did not alter Mrs. Blenkinsop ’s opinion of Miss Sharp . “
29786	29793	29784	29784	Pinner	779	” she remarked to the maid . “
29815	30011	29813	29813	me	0	” It now became clear to every soul in the house , except poor Amelia , that Rebecca should take her departure , and high and low ( always with the one exception ) agreed that that event should take place as speedily as possible . Our good child ransacked all her drawers , cupboards , reticules , and gimcrack boxes — passed in review all her gowns , fichus , tags , bobbins , laces , silk stockings , and fallals — selecting this thing and that and the other , to make a little heap for Rebecca . And going to her Papa , that generous British merchant , who had promised to give her as many guineas as she was years old — she begged the old gentleman to give the money to dear Rebecca , who must want it , while she lacked for nothing . She even made George Osborne contribute , and nothing loth ( for he was as free - handed a young fellow as any in the army ) , he went to Bond Street , and bought the best hat and spenser that money could buy . “
30024	30037	30020	30020	Rebecca	639	” said Amelia , quite proud of the bandbox conveying these gifts . “
30050	30051	30052	30052	Nobody	2167	” “
30054	30058	30052	30052	Nobody	2167	” Rebecca answered . “
30066	30074	30061	30061	I	0	” She was thinking in her heart , “
30084	30230	30077	30078	George Osborne	709	”—And she loved George Osborne accordingly . She made her preparations for departure with great equanimity ; and accepted all the kind little Amelia ’s presents , after just the proper degree of hesitation and reluctance . She vowed eternal gratitude to Mrs. Sedley , of course ; but did not intrude herself upon that good lady too much , who was embarrassed , and evidently wishing to avoid her . She kissed Mr. Sedley ’s hand , when he presented her with the purse ; and asked permission to consider him for the future as her kind , kind friend and protector . Her behaviour was so affecting that he was going to write her a cheque for twenty pounds more ; but he restrained his feelings : the carriage was in waiting to take him to dinner , so he tripped away with a “
30256	30607	30254	30254	James	780	” Finally came the parting with Miss Amelia , over which picture I intend to throw a veil . But after a scene in which one person was in earnest and the other a perfect performer — after the tenderest caresses , the most pathetic tears , the smelling - bottle , and some of the very best feelings of the heart , had been called into requisition — Rebecca and Amelia parted , the former vowing to love her friend for ever and ever and ever . AMONG the most respected of the names beginning in C , which the Court - Guide contained , in the year 18 — , was that of Crawley , Sir Pitt , Baronet , Great Gaunt Street , and Queen ’s Crawley , Hants . This honourable name had figured constantly also in the parliamentary list for many years , in conjunction with that of a number of other worthy gentlemen who sat in turns for the borough . It is related , with regard to the borough of Queen ’s Crawley , that Queen Elizabeth in one of her progresses , stopping at Crawley to breakfast , was so delighted with some remarkably fine Hampshire beer which was then presented to her by the Crawley of the day ( a handsome gentleman with a trim beard and a good leg ) , that she forthwith erected Crawley into a borough to send two members to Parliament ; and the place , from the day of that illustrious visit , took the name of Queen ’s Crawley , which it holds up to the present moment . And though , by the lapse of time , and those mutations which age produces in empires , cities , and boroughs , Queen ’s Crawley was no longer so populous a place as it had been in Queen Bess ’s time — nay , was come down to that condition of borough which used to be denominated rotten — yet , as Sir Pitt Crawley would say with perfect justice in his elegant way , “
30623	31047	31048	31050	Sir Pitt Crawley	697	” Sir Pitt Crawley ( named after that great Commoner ) was the son of Walpole Crawley , first Baronet , of the Tape and Sealing - Wax Office in the reign of George II . , when he was impeached for peculation , as were a great number of other honest gentlemen of those days ; and Walpole Crawley was , as need scarcely be said , son of John Churchill Crawley , named after the celebrated military commander of the reign of Queen Anne . The family tree ( which hangs up at Queen ’s Crawley , ) furthermore mentions Charles Stuart , afterwards called Barebones - Crawley , son of the Crawley of James the First ’s time ; and finally , Queen Elizabeth ’s Crawley , who is represented as the foreground of the picture in his forked beard and armour . Out of his waistcoat , as usual , grows a tree , on the main branches of which the above illustrious names are inscribed . Close by the name of Sir Pitt Crawley , Baronet ( the subject of the present memoir ) , are written that of his brother , the Reverend Bute Crawley ( the great Commoner was in disgrace when the reverend gentleman was born ) , rector of Crawley - cum - Snailby , and of various other male and female members of the Crawley family . Sir Pitt was first married to Grizzel , sixth daughter of Mungo Binkie , Lord Binkie , and cousin , in consequence , of Mr. Dundas . She brought him two sons : Pitt , named not so much after his father as after the heaven - born minister ; and Rawdon Crawley , from the Prince of Wales ’s friend , whom his Majesty George IV . forgot so completely . Many years after her ladyship ’s demise , Sir Pitt led to the altar Rosa , daughter of Mr. G. Dawson , of Mudbury , by whom he had two daughters , for whose benefit Miss Rebecca Sharp was now engaged as governess . It will be seen that the young lady was come into a family of very genteel connexions , and was about to move in a much more distinguished circle than that humble one which she had just quitted in Russell Square . She had received her orders to join her pupils , in a note which was written upon an old envelope , and which contained the following words : — “
31075	31080	31063	31063	I	0	“ Great Gaunt Street . ”
31081	31109	31048	31050	Sir Pitt Crawley	697	“ Sir Pitt Crawley begs Miss Sharp and baggidge may be hear on Tuesday , as I leaf for Queen ’s Crawley to - morrow morning erly . “
31114	31203	31208	31208	he	3102	” Rebecca had never seen a Baronet , as far as she knew , and as soon as she had taken leave of Amelia , and counted the guineas which good - natured Mr. Sedley had put into a purse for her , and as soon as she had done wiping her eyes with her handkerchief ( which operation she concluded the very moment the carriage had turned the corner of the street ) , she began to depict in her own mind what a baronet must be . “
31213	31217	31208	31208	he	3102	” thought she , “
31302	31544	31293	31293	gentlefolks	3104	” and she fell to thinking of her Russell Square friends with that very same philosophical bitterness with which , in a certain apologue , the fox is represented as speaking of the grapes . Having passed through Gaunt Square into Great Gaunt Street , the carriage at length stopped at a tall gloomy house between two other tall gloomy houses , each with a hatchment over the middle drawing - room window ; as is the custom of houses in Great Gaunt Street , in which gloomy locality death seems to reign perpetual . The shutters of the first - floor windows of Sir Pitt ’s mansion were closed — those of the dining - room were partially open , and the blinds neatly covered up in old newspapers . John , the groom , who had driven the carriage alone , did not care to descend to ring the bell ; and so prayed a passing milk - boy to perform that office for him . When the bell was rung , a head appeared between the interstices of the dining - room shutters , and the door was opened by a man in drab breeches and gaiters , with a dirty old coat , a foul old neckcloth lashed round his bristly neck , a shining bald head , a leering red face , a pair of twinkling grey eyes , and a mouth perpetually on the grin . “
31551	31559	31546	31548	Sir Pitt Crawley	697	” says John , from the box . “
31562	31574	31546	31548	Sir Pitt Crawley	697	” says the man at the door , with a nod . “
31584	31588	31546	31548	Sir Pitt Crawley	697	” said John . “
31595	31600	31593	31593	yourself	3106	” said the porter . “
31630	31709	31623	31623	Miss	3109	” said John , with a horse - laugh , for he was no longer respectful to Miss Sharp , as her connexion with the family was broken off , and as she had given nothing to the servants on coming away . The bald - headed man , taking his hands out of his breeches pockets , advanced on this summons , and throwing Miss Sharp ’s trunk over his shoulder , carried it into the house . “
31725	31739	31740	31740	I	0	” said Miss Sharp , and descended from the carriage in much indignation . “
31753	31760	31740	31740	I	0	” said she to the groom . “
31764	31769	31740	31740	I	0	” replied that functionary . “
31822	31834	31810	31810	Jim	780	” continued John , pointing with his thumb towards Miss Sharp ; “
31847	32143	31839	31839	I	0	” and so saying , Mr. Sedley ’s groom drove away . The truth is , he was attached to the lady ’s maid in question , and indignant that she should have been robbed of her perquisites . On entering the dining - room , by the orders of the individual in gaiters , Rebecca found that apartment not more cheerful than such rooms usually are , when genteel families are out of town . The faithful chambers seem , as it were , to mourn the absence of their masters . The turkey carpet has rolled itself up , and retired sulkily under the sideboard : the pictures have hidden their faces behind old sheets of brown paper : the ceiling lamp is muffled up in a dismal sack of brown holland : the window - curtains have disappeared under all sorts of shabby envelopes : the marble bust of Sir Walpole Crawley is looking from its black corner at the bare boards and the oiled fire - irons , and the empty card - racks over the mantel - piece : the cellaret has lurked away behind the carpet : the chairs are turned up heads and tails along the walls : and in the dark corner opposite the statue , is an old - fashioned crabbed knife - box locked and sitting on a dumb waiter . Two kitchen chairs , and a round table , and an attenuated old poker and tongs were , however , gathered round the fire - place , as was a saucepan over a feeble sputtering fire . There was a bit of cheese and bread , and a tin candlestick on the table , and a little black porter in a pint - pot . “
32165	32166	31839	31839	I	0	” “
32173	32179	32180	32180	He	697	” said Miss Sharp majestically . “
32228	32284	32218	32219	Miss Governess	801	” The lady addressed as Mrs. Tinker , at this moment made her appearance with a pipe and a paper of tobacco , for which she had been despatched a minute before Miss Sharp ’s arrival ; and she handed the articles over to Sir Pitt , who had taken his seat by the fire . “
32290	32294	32295	32295	I	0	” said he . “
32309	32310	32306	32307	old Tinker	800	” “
32313	32323	32306	32307	old Tinker	800	” replied Mrs. Tinker , flinging down the coin ; “
32333	32334	32327	32331	baronets as cares about farthings	3114	” “
32345	32350	32327	32331	baronets as cares about farthings	3114	” answered the M.P. ; “
32379	32380	32381	32381	You	800	” “
32394	32401	32403	32403	he	697	” said Mrs. Tinker , surlily ; “
32417	32418	32409	32409	You	800	” “
32429	32442	32426	32427	Miss Sharp	639	” said the old gentleman , with an air almost of politeness . “
32452	32453	32448	32448	I	0	” “
32464	32468	32454	32454	He	697	” growled Tinker . “
32509	32552	32553	32553	You	800	” Presently the baronet plunged a fork into the saucepan on the fire and withdrew from the pot a piece of tripe and an onion , which he divided into pretty equal portions , and of which he partook with Mrs. Tinker . “
32600	32659	32598	32598	Tink	803	” And they fell to upon their frugal supper . After supper Sir Pitt Crawley began to smoke his pipe ; and when it became quite dark , he lighted the rushlight in the tin candlestick , and producing from an interminable pocket a huge mass of papers , began reading them , and putting them in order . “
32692	32693	32694	32694	He	3121	” “
32701	32713	32694	32694	He	3121	” said Mrs. Tinker , taking up the pot of porter . “
32719	32724	32694	32694	He	3121	” said the baronet . “
32887	32888	32889	32889	She	3131	” “
32896	32900	32889	32889	She	3131	” said Tinker . “
32923	32924	32925	32925	She	3131	” “
32932	32939	32925	32925	She	3131	” said the baronet , simply ; “
32955	33052	32941	32941	she	3131	”—And in this confidential strain , and much to the amusement of the new - comer , the conversation continued for a considerable time . Whatever Sir Pitt Crawley ’s qualities might be , good or bad , he did not make the least disguise of them . He talked of himself incessantly , sometimes in the coarsest and vulgarest Hampshire accent ; sometimes adopting the tone of a man of the world . And so , with injunctions to Miss Sharp to be ready at five in the morning , he bade her good night . “
33062	33066	33053	33053	You	3138	” he said ; “
33089	33237	33238	33238	I	0	” Sir Pitt went off after this benediction , and the solemn Tinker , rushlight in hand , led the way up the great bleak stone stairs , past the great dreary drawing - room doors , with the handles muffled up in paper , into the great front bed - room , where Lady Crawley had slept her last . The bed and chamber were so funereal and gloomy , you might have fancied , not only that Lady Crawley died in the room , but that her ghost inhabited it . Rebecca sprang about the apartment , however , with the greatest liveliness , and had peeped into the huge wardrobes , and the closets , and the cupboards , and tried the drawers which were locked , and examined the dreary pictures and toilette appointments , while the old charwoman was saying her prayers . “
33255	33261	33253	33253	Miss	3141	” said the old woman . “
33277	33281	33253	33253	Miss	3141	” says Rebecca . “
33301	33681	33298	33299	Mrs. Tinker	800	” But old Tinker was not to be pumped by this little cross - questioner ; and signifying to her that bed was a place for sleeping , not conversation , set up in her corner of the bed such a snore as only the nose of innocence can produce . Rebecca lay awake for a long , long time , thinking of the morrow , and of the new world into which she was going , and of her chances of success there . The rushlight flickered in the basin . The mantel - piece cast up a great black shadow , over half of a mouldy old sampler , which her defunct ladyship had worked , no doubt , and over two little family pictures of young lads , one in a college gown , and the other in a red jacket like a soldier . When she went to sleep , Rebecca chose that one to dream about . At four o’clock , on such a roseate summer ’s morning as even made Great Gaunt Street look cheerful , the faithful Tinker , having wakened her bedfellow , and bid her prepare for departure , unbarred and unbolted the great hall door ( the clanging and clapping whereof startled the sleeping echoes in the street ) , and taking her way into Oxford Street , summoned a coach from a stand there . It is needless to particularize the number of the vehicle , or to state that the driver was stationed thus early in the neighbourhood of Swallow Street , in hopes that some young buck , reeling homeward from the tavern , might need the aid of his vehicle , and pay him with the generosity of intoxication . It is likewise needless to say , that the driver , if he had any such hopes as those above stated , was grossly disappointed ; and that the worthy Baronet whom he drove to the City did not give him one single penny more than his fare . It was in vain that Jehu appealed and stormed ; that he flung down Miss Sharp ’s bandboxes in the gutter at the ‘ Necks , and swore he would take the law of his fare . “
33687	33694	33682	33682	You	3145	” said one of the hostlers ; “
33701	33702	33697	33699	Sir Pitt Crawley	697	” “
33709	33716	33707	33707	Joe	674	” cried the Baronet , approvingly ; “
33729	33730	33723	33724	the man	3146	” “
33735	33755	33723	33724	the man	3146	” said Joe , grinning sulkily , and mounting the Baronet ’s baggage on the roof of the coach . “
33764	33777	33762	33762	Leader	3147	” exclaims the Member of Parliament to the coachman ; who replied , “
33783	34439	33780	33781	Sir Pitt	697	” with a touch of his hat , and rage in his soul ( for he had promised the box to a young gentleman from Cambridge , who would have given a crown to a certainty ) , and Miss Sharp was accommodated with a back seat inside the carriage , which might be said to be carrying her into the wide world . How the young man from Cambridge sulkily put his five great coats in front ; but was reconciled when little Miss Sharp was made to quit the carriage , and mount up beside him — when he covered her up in one of his Benjamins , and became perfectly good - humoured — how the asthmatic gentleman , the prim lady , who declared upon her sacred honour she had never travelled in a public carriage before ( there is always such a lady in a coach,—Alas ! was ; for the coaches , where are they ? ) , and the fat widow with the brandy - bottle , took their places inside — how the porter asked them all for money , and got sixpence from the gentleman and five greasy halfpence from the fat widow — and how the carriage at length drove away — now , threading the dark lanes of Aldersgate , anon clattering by the Blue Cupola of St. Paul ’s , jingling rapidly by the strangers ’ entry of Fleet - Market , which , with Exeter ’ Change , has now departed to the world of shadows — how they passed the White Bear in Piccadilly , and saw the dew rising up from the marketgardens of Knightsbridge — how Turnham - green , Brentford , Bagshot , were passed — need not be told here . But the writer of these pages , who has pursued in former days , and in the same bright weather , the same remarkable journey , can not but think of it with a sweet and tender regret . Where is the road now , and its merry incidents of life ? Is there no Chelsea or Greenwich for the old honest pimple - nosed coachmen ? I wonder where are they , those good fellows ? Is old Weller alive or dead ? and the waiters , yea , and the inns at which they waited , and the cold rounds of beef inside , and the stunted ostler , with his blue nose and clinking pail , where is he , and where is his generation ? To those great geniuses now in petticoats , who shall write novels for the beloved reader ’s children , these men and things will be as much legend and history as Nineveh , or Cœur de Lion , or Jack Sheppard . For them stage - coaches will have become romances — a team of four bays as fabulous as Bucephalus or Black Bess . Ah , how their coats shone , as the stable - men pulled their clothes off , and away they went — ah , how their tails shook , as with smoking sides at the stage ’s end they demurely walked away into the innyard . Alas ! we shall never hear the horn sing at midnight , or see the pike - gates fly open any more . Whither , however , is the light four - inside Trafalgar coach carrying us ? Let us be set down at Queen ’s Crawley without further divagation , and see how Miss Rebecca Sharp speeds there . Everything considered , I think it is quite as well for our dear Amelia Sedley , in Russell Square , that Miss Sharp and she are parted . Rebecca is a droll funny creature , to be sure ; and those descriptions of the poor lady weeping for the loss of her beauty , and the gentleman “
34451	34507	33780	33781	Sir Pitt	697	” are very smart , doubtless , and show a great knowledge of the world . That she might , when on her knees , have been thinking of something better than Miss Horrock ’s ribbons , has possibly struck both of us . But my kind reader will please to remember that this history has “
34510	34769	34770	34770	Ah	3148	” for a title , and that Vanity Fair is a very vain , wicked , foolish place , full of all sorts of humbugs and falseness and pretensions . And while the moralist , who is holding forth on the cover ( an accurate portrait of your humble servant ) , professes to wear neither gown nor bands , but only the very same long - eared livery in which his congregation is arrayed : yet , look you , one is bound to speak the truth as far as one knows it , whether one mounts a cap and bells or a shovel - hat ; and a deal of disagreeable matter must come out in the course of such an undertaking . I have heard a brother of the story - telling trade , at Naples , preaching to a pack of good - for - nothing honest lazy fellows by the sea - shore , work himself up into such a rage and passion with some of the villains whose wicked deeds he was describing and inventing , that the audience could not resist it ; and they and the poet together would burst out into a roar of oaths and execrations against the fictitious monster of the tale , so that the hat went round , and the bajocchi tumbled into it , in the midst of a perfect storm of sympathy . At the little Paris theatres , on the other hand , you will not only hear the people yelling out : “
34776	34902	34773	34774	Ah monstre	3149	” and cursing the tyrant of the play from the boxes ; but the actors themselves positively refuse to play the wicked parts , such as those of infâmes Anglais , brutal Cossacks , and what not , and prefer to appear at a smaller salary , in their real characters as loyal Frenchmen . I set the two stories one against the other , so that you may see that it is not from mere mercenary motives that the present performer is desirous to show up and trounce his villains ; but because he has a sincere hatred of them , which he can not not keep down , and which must find a vent in suitable abuse and bad language . I warn my “
34906	36353	34773	34774	Ah monstre	3149	” then , that I am going to tell a story of harrowing villany and complicated — but , as I trust , intensely interesting — crime . My rascals are not milk - and - water rascals , I promise you . When we come to the proper places we wo n’t spare fine language — No . no ! But when we are going over the quiet country we must perforce be calm . A tempest in a slop - basin is absurd We will reserve that sort of thing for the mighty ocean and the lonely midnight . The present Chapter is very mild . Others —— But we will not anticipate those . And , as we bring our characters forward , I will ask leave , as a man and a brother , not only to introduce , but occasionally to step down from the platform , and talk about them : if they are good and kindly , to love them and shake them by the hand : if they are silly , to laugh at them confidentially in the reader ’s sleeve : if they are wicked and heartless , to abuse them in the strongest terms which politeness admits of . Otherwise you might fancy it was I who was sneering at the practice of devotion , which Miss Sharp finds so ridiculous ; that it was I who laughed good - humouredly at the reeling old Silenus of a baronet — whereas the laughter comes from one who has no reverence except for prosperity , and no eye for anything beyond success . Such people there are living and flourishing in the world — Faithless , Hopeless , Charityless : let us have at them , dear friends , with might and main . Some there are , and very successful too , mere quacks and fools : and it was to combat and expose such as those , no doubt , that Laughter was made . SIR PITT CRAWLEY was a philosopher with a taste for what is called low life . His first marriage with the daughter of the noble Binkie had been made under the auspices of his parents ; and as he often told Lady Crawley in her life - time she was such a confounded quarrelsome high - bred jade that when she died he was hanged if he would ever take another of her sort , at her ladyship ’s demise he kept his promise , and selected for a second wife Miss Rose Dawson , daughter of Mr. John Thomas Dawson , ironmonger , of Mudbury . What a happy woman was Rose to be my Lady Crawley ! Let us set down the items of her happiness . In the first place , she gave up Peter Butt , a young man who kept company with her , and in consequence of his disappointment in love , took to smuggling , poaching , and a thousand other bad courses . Then she quarrelled , as in duty bound , with all the friends and intimates of her youth , who , of course , could not be received by my Lady at Queen ’s Crawley — nor did she find in her new rank and abode many persons who were willing to welcome her . Who ever did ? Sir Huddleston Fuddleston had three daughters who all hoped to be Lady Crawley . Sir Giles Wapshot ’s family were insulted that one of the Wapshot girls had not the preference in the marriage , and the remaining baronets of the county were indignant at their comrade ’s misalliance . Never mind the commoners , whom we will leave to grumble anonymously . Sir Pitt did not care , as he said , a brass farden for any one of them . He had his pretty Rose , and what more need a man require than to please himself ? So he used to get drunk every night : to beat his pretty Rose sometimes : to leave her in Hampshire when he went to London for the parliamentary session , without a single friend in the wide world . Even Mrs. Bute Crawley , the Rector ’s wife , refused to visit her , as she said she would never give the pas to a tradesman ’s daughter . As the only endowments with which Nature had gifted Lady Crawley were those of pink cheeks and a white skin , and as she had no sort of character , nor talents , nor opinions , nor occupations , nor amusements , nor that vigour of soul and ferocity of temper which often falls to the lot of entirely foolish women , her hold upon Sir Pitt ’s affections was not very great . Her roses faded out of her cheeks , and the pretty freshness left her figure after the birth of a couple of children , and she became a mere machine in her husband ’s house , of no more use than the late Lady Crawley ’s grand piano . Being a light - complexioned woman , she wore light clothes , as most blondes will , and appeared , in preference , in draggled sea - green , or slatternly sky - blue . She worked that worsted day and night , or other pieces like it . She had counterpanes in the course of a few years to all the beds in Crawley . She had a small flower - garden , for which she had rather an affection ; but beyond this no other like or disliking . When her husband was rude to her she was apathetic : whenever he struck her she cried . She had not character enough to take to drinking , and moaned about , slip - shod and in curl - papers all day . O Vanity Fair — Vanity Fair ! This might have been , but for you , a cheery lass:—Peter Butt and Rose a happy man and wife , in a snug farm , with a hearty family ; and an honest portion of pleasures , cares , hopes and struggles:—but a title and a coach and four are toys more precious than happiness in Vanity Fair : and if Harry the Eighth or Bluebeard were alive now , and wanted a tenth wife , do you suppose he could not get the prettiest girl that shall be presented this season ? The languid dulness of their mamma did not , as it may be supposed , awaken much affection in her little daughters , but they were very happy in the servants ’ hall and in the stables ; and the Scotch gardener having luckily a good wife and some good children , they got a little wholesome society and instruction in his lodge , which was the only education bestowed upon them until Miss Sharp came . Her engagement was owing to the remonstrances of Mr. Pitt Crawley , the only friend or protector Lady Crawley ever had , and the only person , besides her children , for whom she entertained a little feeble attachment . Mr. Pitt took after the noble Binkies , from whom he was descended , and was a very polite and proper gentleman . When he grew to man ’s estate , and came back from Christchurch , he began to reform the slackened discipline of the hall , in spite of his father , who stood in awe of him . He was a man of such rigid refinement , that he would have starved rather than have dined without a white neck - cloth . Once , when just from college , and when Horrocks the butler brought him a letter without placing it previously on a tray , he gave that domestic a look , and administered to him a speech so cutting , that Horrocks ever after trembled before him ; the whole household bowed to him : Lady Crawley ’s curl - papers came off earlier when he was at home : Sir Pitt ’s muddy gaiters disappeared ; and if that incorrigible old man still adhered to other old habits , he never fuddled himself with rum - and - water in his son ’s presence , and only talked to his servants in a very reserved and polite manner ; and those persons remarked that Sir Pitt never swore at Lady Crawley while his son was in the room . It was he who taught the butler to say , “
36359	36869	36870	36871	The Sailor	3151	” and who insisted on handing her ladyship in to dinner . He seldom spoke to her , but when he did it was with the most powerful respect ; and he never let her quit the apartment , without rising in the most stately manner to open the door , and making an elegant bow at her egress . At Eton he was called Miss Crawley ; and there , I am sorry to say , his younger brother Rawdon used to lick him violently . But though his parts were not brilliant , he made up for his lack of talent by meritorious industry , and was never known , during eight years at school , to be subject to that punishment which it is generally thought none but a cherub can escape . At college his career was of course highly creditable . And here he prepared himself for public life , into which he was to be introduced by the patronage of his grandfather , Lord Binkie , by studying the ancient and modern orators with great assiduity , and by speaking unceasingly at the debating societies . But though he had a fine flux of words , and delivered his little voice with great pomposity and pleasure to himself , and never advanced any sentiment or opinion which was not perfectly trite and stale , and supported by a Latin quotation ; yet he failed somehow , in spite of a mediocrity which ought to have insured any man a success . He did not even get the prize poem , which all his friends said he was sure of . After leaving college he became Private Secretary to Lord Binkie , and was then appointed Attaché to the Legation at Pumpernickel , which post he filled with perfect honour , and brough home despatches , consisting of Strasburg pie , to the Foreign Minister of the day . After remaining ten years Attaché ( several years after the lamented Lord Binkie ’s demise ) , and finding the advancement slow , he at length gave up the diplomatic service in some disgust , and began to turn country gentleman . He wrote a pamphlet on Malt on returning to England ( for he was an ambitious man , and always liked to be before the public ) , and took a strong part in the Negro Emancipation question . Then he became a friend of Mr. Wilberforce ’s , whose politics he admired , and had that famous correspondence with the Reverend Silas Hornblower , on the Ashantee Mission . He was in London , if not for the Parliament session , at least in May , for the religious meetings . In the country he was a magistrate , and an active visitor and speaker among those destitute of religious instruction . He was said to be paying his addresses to Lady Jane Sheepshanks , Lord Southdown ’s third daughter , and whose sister , Lady Emily , wrote those sweet tracts , “
36876	36878	36870	36871	The Sailor	3151	” and “
36885	37166	36879	36883	The Applewoman of Finchley Common	3152	” Miss Sharp ’s accounts of his employment at Queen ’s Crawley were not caricatures . He subjected the servants there to the devotional exercises before mentioned , in which ( and so much the better ) he brought his father to join . He patronised an Independent meeting - house in Crawley parish , much to the indignation of his uncle the Rector , and to the consequent delight of Sir Pitt , who was induced to go himself once or twice , which occasioned some violent sermons at Crawley parish church , directed point - blank at the Baronet ’s old gothic pew there . Honest Sir Pitt , however , did not feel the force of these discourses , as he always took his nap during sermon - time . Mr. Crawley was very earnest , for the good of the nation and of the Christian world , that the old gentleman should yield him up his place in Parliament ; but this the elder constantly refused to do . Both were of course too prudent to give up the fifteen hundred a year which was brought in by the second seat ( at this period filled by Mr. Quadroon , with carte - blanche on the Slave question ) ; indeed the family estate was much embarrassed , and the income drawn from the borough was of great use to the house of Queen ’s Crawley . It had never recovered the heavy fine imposed upon Walpole Crawley , first baronet , for peculation in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office . Sir Walpole was a jolly fellow , eager to seize and to spend money ( “
37173	38821	36879	36883	The Applewoman of Finchley Common	3152	” as Mr. Crawley would remark with a sigh ) , and in his day beloved by all the county for the constant drunkenness and hospitality which was maintained at Queen ’s Crawley . The cellars were filled with burgundy then , the kennels with hounds , and the stables with gallant hunters ; now , such horses as Queen ’s Crawley possessed went to plough , or ran in the Trafalgar Coach ; and it was with a team of these very horses , on an off - day , that Miss Sharp was brought to the Hall ; for boor as he was , Sir Pitt was a stickler for his dignity while at home , and seldom drove out but with four horses , and though he dined off boiled mutton , had always three footmen to serve it . If mere par simony could have made a man rich , Sir Pitt Crawley might have become very wealthy — if he had been an attorney in a country town , with no capital but his brains , it is very possible that he would have turned them to good account , and might have achieved for himself a very considerable influence and competency . But he was unluckily endowed with a good name and a large though encumbered estate , both of which went rather to injure than to advance him . He had a taste for law , which cost him many thousands yearly ; and being a great deal too clever to be robbed , as he said , by any single agent , allowed his affairs to be mismanaged by a dozen , whom he all equally mistrusted . He was such a sharp landlord , that he could hardly find any but bankrupt tenants ; and such a close farmer , as to grudge almost the seed to the ground , whereupon revengeful Nature grudged him the crops which she granted to more liberal husbandmen . He speculated in every possible way ; he worked mines ; bought canal - shares ; horsed coaches ; took government contracts , and was the busiest man and magistrate of his country . As he would not pay honest agents at his granite quarry , he had the satisfaction of finding that four overseers ran away , and took fortunes with them to America . For want of proper precautions , his coal - mines filled with water ; the government flung his contract of damaged beef upon his hands : and for his coach - horses , every mail proprietor in the kingdom knew that he lost more horses than any man in the country , from underfeeding and buying cheap . In disposition he was sociable , and far from being proud ; nay , he rather preferred the society of a farmer or a horse - dealer to that of a gentleman , like my lord , his son : he was fond of drink , of swearing , of joking with the farmers ’ daughters : he was never known to give away a shilling or to do a good action , but was of a pleasant , sly , laughing mood , and would cut his joke and drink his glass with a tenant and sell him up the next day ; or have his laugh with the poacher he was transporting with equal good humour . His politeness for the fair sex has already been hinted at by Miss Rebecca Sharp — in a word , the whole baronetage , peerage , commonage of England , did not contain a more cunning , mean , selfish , foolish , disreputable old man . That blood - red hand of Sir Pitt Crawley ’s would be in anybody ’s pocket except his own ; and it is with grief and pain , that , as admires of the British aristocracy , we find ourselves obliged to admit the existence of so many ill qualities in a person whose name is in Debrett . One great cause why Mr. Crawley had such a hold over the affections of his father , resulted from money arrangements . The Baronet owed his son a sum of money out of the jointure of his mother , which he did not find it convenient to pay ; indeed he had an almost invincible repugnance to paying anybody , and could only be brought by force to discharge his debts . Miss Sharp calculated ( for she became , as we shall hear speedily , inducted into most of the secrets of the family ) that the mere payment of his creditors cost the honourable Baronet several hundreds yearly ; but this was a delight he could not forego ; he had a savage pleasure in making the poor wretches wait , and in shifting from court to court and from term to term the period of satisfaction . What ’s the good of being in Parliament , he said , if you must pay your debts ? Hence , indeed , his position as a senator was not a little useful to him . Vanity Fair — Vanity Fair ! Here was a man , who could not spell , and did not care to read — who had the habits and the cunning of a boor : whose aim in life was pettifoggin who never had a taste , or emotion , or enjoyment , but what was sordid and foul ; and yet he had rank , and honours , and power , somehow : and was a dignitary of the land , and a pillar of the state . He was high sheriff , and rode in a golden coach . Great ministers and statesmen courted him ; and in Vanity Fair he had a higher place than the most brilliant genius or spotless virtue . Sir Pitt had an unmarried half - sister who inherited her mother ’s large fortune , and though the Baronet proposed to borrow this money of her on mortgage , Miss Crawley declined the offer , and preferred the security of the funds . She had signified , however , her intention of leaving her inheritance between Sir Pitt ’s second son and the family at the Rectory , and had once or twice paid the debts of Rawdon Crawley in his career at college and in the army . Miss Crawley was , in consequence , an object of great respect when she came to Queen ’s Crawley , for she had a balance at her banker ’s which would have made her beloved anywhere . What a dignity it gives an old lady , that balance at the banker ’s ! How tenderly we look at her faults if she is a relative ( and may every reader have a score of such ) , what a kind good - natured old creature we find her ! How the junior partner of Hobbs and Dobbs leads her smiling to the carriage with the lozenge upon it , and the fat wheezy coachman ! How , when she comes to pay us a visit , we generally find an opportunity to let our friends know her station in the world ! We say ( and with perfect truth ) I wish I had Miss MacWhirter ’s signature to a cheque for five thousand pounds . She would n’t miss it , says your wife . She is my aunt , say you , in an easy careless way , when your friend asks if Miss MacWhirter is any relative . Your wife is perpetually sending her little testimonies of affection , your little girls work endless worsted baskets , cushions , and footstools for her . What a good fire there is in her room when she comes to pay you a visit , although your wife laces her stays without one ! The house during her stay assumes a festive , neat , warm , jovial , snug appearance not visible at other seasons . You yourself , dear sir , forget to go to sleep after dinner , and find yourself all of a sudden ( though you invariably lose ) very fond of a rubber . What good dinners you have — game every day , Malmsey - Madeira , and no end of fish from London . Even the servants in the kitchen share in the general prosperity ; and , somehow , during the stay of Miss MacWhirter ’s fat coachman , the beer is grown much stronger , and the consumption of tea and sugar in the nursery ( where her maid takes her meals ) is not regarded in the least . Is it so , or is it not so ? I appeal to the middle classes . Ah , gracious powers ! I wish you would send me an old aunt — a maiden aunt — an aunt with a lozenge on her carriage , and a front of light coffee - coloured hair — how my children should work workbags for her , and my Julia and I would make her comfortable ! Sweet — sweet vision ! Foolish — foolish dream ! AND now , being received as a member of the amiable family whose portraits we have sketched in the foregoing pages , it became naturally Rebecca ’s duty to make herself , as she said , agreeable to her benefactors , and to gain their confidence to the utmost of her power . Who can but admire this quality of gratitude in an unprotected orphan ; and , if there entered some degree of selfishness into her calculations , who can say but that her prudence was perfectly justifiable ! “
38829	38835	38836	38836	I	0	” said the friendless girl . “
38980	39038	39039	39039	I	0	” Thus it was that our little romantic friend formed visions of the future for herself,—nor must we be scandalised that , in all her castles in the air , a husband was the principal inhabitant . Of what else have young ladies to think , but husbands ? Of what else do their dear mammas think ? “
39046	39177	39042	39044	my own mamma	3158	” said Rebecca ; not without a tingling consciousness of defeat , as she thought over her little misadventure with Jos Sedley . So she wisely determined to render her position with the Queen ’s Crawley family comfortable and secure , and to this end resolved to make friends of every one around her who could at all interfere with her comfort . As my Lady Crawley was not one of these personages , and a woman , moreover , so indolent and void of character as not to be of the least consequence in her own house , Rebecca soon found that it was not at all necessary to cultivate her good will — indeed , impossible to gain it . She used to talk to her pupils about their “
39181	39447	39448	39448	Smollett	840	” and , though she treated that lady with every demonstration of cool respect , it was to the rest of the family that she wisely directed the chief part of her attentions . With the young people , whose applause she thoroughly gained , her method was pretty simple . She did not pester their young brains with too much learning , but , on the contrary , let them have their own way in regard to educating themselves ; for what instruction is more effectual than self - instruction ? The eldest was rather fond of books , and as there was in the old library at Queens Crawley a considerable provision of works of light literature of the last century , both in the French and English languages ( they had been purchased by the Secretary of the Tape and Sealing Wax Office at the period of his disgrace ) , and as nobody ever troubled the bookshelves but herself , Rebecca was enabled agreeably , and , as it were , in playing , to impart a great deal of instruction to Miss Rose Crawley . She and Miss Rose thus read together many delightful French and English works , among which may be mentioned those of the learned Dr. Smollett , of the ingenious Mr. Henry Fielding , of the graceful and fantastic Monsieur Crèbillon the younger , whom our immortal poet Gray so much admired , and of the universal Monsieur de Voltaire . Once , when Mr. Crawley asked what the young people were reading , the governess replied “
39450	39451	39448	39448	Smollett	840	” “
39456	39464	39454	39454	Smollett	840	” said Mr. Crawley , quite satisfied . “
39490	39491	39454	39454	Smollett	840	” “
39494	39901	39454	39454	Smollett	840	” said Miss Rose ; without , however , adding that it was the history of Mr. Humphrey Clinker . On another occasion he was rather scandalised at finding his sister with a book of French plays ; but as the governess remarked that it was for the purpose of acquiring the French idiom in conversation , he was fain to be content . Mr. Crawley , as a diplomatist , was exceedingly proud of his own skill in speaking the French language ( for he was of the world still ) , and not a little pleased with the compliments which the governess continually paid him upon his proficiency . Miss Violet ’s tastes were , on the contrary , more rude and boisterous than those of her sister . She knew the sequestered spots where the hens laid their eggs . She could climb a tree to rob the nests of the feathered songsters of their speckled spoils . And her pleasure was to ride the young colts , and to scour the plains like Camilla . She was the favourite of her father and of the stable - men . She was the darling , and withal the terror of the cook ; for she discovered the haunt of the jam - pots and would attack them when they were within her reach . She and her sister were engaged in constant battles . Any of which peccadilloes , if Miss Sharp discovered , she did not tell them to Lady Crawley , who would have told them to the father , or worse , to Mr. Crawley ; but promised not to tell if Miss Violet would be a good girl and love her governess . With Mr. Crawley Miss Sharp was respectful and obedient . She used to consult him on passages of French which she could not understand , though her mother was a Frenchwoman , and which he would construe to her satisfaction : and , besides giving her his aid in profane literature , he was kind enough to select for her books of a more serious tendency , and address to her much of his conversation . She admired , beyond measure , his speech at the Quashimaboo - Aid Society ; took an interest in his pamphlet on malt ; was often affected , even to tears , by his discourses of an evening , and would say—“Oh
39908	39931	39454	39454	Smollett	840	” with a sigh , and a look up to heaven , that made him occasionally condescend to shake hands with her . “
39939	39946	39906	39906	sir	15428	” would that aristocratic religionist say . “
39993	40191	39990	39991	a Montmorency	848	” Indeed it was from this famous family , as it appears , that Miss Sharp , by the mother ’s side , was descended . Of course she did not say that her mother had been on the stage ; it would have shocked Mr. Crawley ’s religious scruples . How many noble émigrées had this horrid revolution plunged in poverty ! She had several stories about her ancestors ere she had been many months in the house ; some of which Mr. Crawley happened to find in D’Hozier ’s dictionary , which was in the library , and which strengthened his belief in their truth , and in the high - breeding of Rebecca . Are we to suppose from this curiosity and prying into dictionaries , could our heroine suppose , that Mr. Crawley was interested in her?—no , only in a friendly way . Have we not stated that he was attached to Lady Jane Sheepshanks ? He took Rebecca to task once or twice about the propriety of playing at backgammon with Sir Pitt , saying that it was a godless amusement , and that she would be much better engaged in reading “
40196	40198	39990	39991	a Montmorency	848	” or “
40205	40830	40831	40831	She	3169	” or any work of a more serious nature ; but Miss Sharp said her dear mother used often to play the same game with the old Count de Trictrac and the venerable Abbè du Cornet , and so found an excuse for this and other worldly amusements . But it was not only by playing at backgammon with the Baronet , that the little governess rendered herself agreeable to her employer . She found many different ways of being useful to him . She read over , with indefatigable patience , all those law papers , with which , before she came to Queen ’s Crawley , he had promised to entertain her . She volunteered to copy many of his letters , and adroitly altered the spelling of them so as to suit the usages of the present day . She became interested in everything appertaining to the estate , to the farm , the park , the garden , and the stables ; and so delightful a companion was she , that the Baronet would seldom take his after - breakfast walk without her ( and the children of course ) , when she would give her advice as to the trees which were to be lopped in the shrubberies , the garden - beds to be dug , the crops which were to be cut , the horses which were to go to cart or plough . Before she had been a year at Queen ’s Crawley she had quite won the Baronet ’s confidence ; and the conversation at the dinner - table , which before used to be held between him and Mr. Horrocks the butler , was now almost exclusively between Sir Pitt and Miss Sharp . She was almost mistress of the house when Mr. Crawley was absent , but conducted herself in her new and exalted situation with such circumspection and modesty as not to offend the authorities of the kitchen and stable , among whom her behaviour was always exceedingly modest and affable . She was quite a different person from the haughty , shy , dissatisfied little girl whom we have known previously , and this change of temper proved great prudence , a sincere desire of amendment , or at any rate great moral courage on her part . Whether it was the heart which dictated this new system of complaisance and humility adopted by our Rebecca , is to be proved by her after - history . A system of hypocrisy , which lasts through whole years , is one seldom satisfactorily practised by a person of one - and - twenty ; however , our readers will recollect , that , though young in years , our heroine was old in life and experience , and we have written to no purpose if they have not discovered that she was a very clever woman . The elder and younger son of the house of Crawley were , like the gentleman and lady in the weather - box , never at home together — they hated each other cordially : indeed , Rawdon Crawley , the dragoon , had a great contempt for the establishment altogether , and seldom come thither except when his aunt paid her annual visit . The great good quality of this old lady has been mentioned . She possessed seventy thousand pounds , and had almost adopted Rawdon . She disliked her elder nephew exceedingly , and despised him as a milksop . In return he did not hesitate to state that her soul was irretrievably lost , and was of opinion that his brother ’s chance in the next world was not a whit better . “
40840	40846	40831	40831	She	3169	” would Mr. Crawley say ; “
40894	40933	40936	40937	your sarmons	3175	” In fact , the old lady declined altogether to hear his hour ’s lecture of an evening ; and when she came to Queen ’s Crawley alone , he was obliged to pretermit his usual devotional exercises . “
40947	40952	40953	40953	she	3169	” said his father ; “
40966	40967	40953	40953	she	3169	” “
40976	40977	40973	40974	the servants	2120	” “
40983	41006	40978	40979	The servants	2120	” said Sir Pitt ; and his son thought even worse would happen were they deprived of the benefit of his instruction . “
41014	41022	41012	41012	Pitt	697	” said the father to his remonstrance . “
41043	41044	41023	41023	You	3174	” “
41055	41060	41053	41053	sir	15428	” continued Mr. Crawley . “
41073	41416	41064	41066	the old lady	2255	you?”—and who knows but it was Mr. Crawley ’s meaning ? Old Miss Crawley was certainly one of the reprobates . She had a sung little house in Park Lane , and , as she ate and drank a great deal too much during the season in London , she went to Harrowgate or Cheltenham for the summer . She was the most hospitable and jovial of old vestals , and had been a beauty in her day , she said . ( All old women were beauties once , we very well know . ) She was a bel esprit , and a dreadful Radical for those days . She had been in France ( where St. Just , they say , inspired her with an unfortunate passion ) , and loved , ever after , French novels , French cookery , and French wines . She read Voltaire , and had Rousseau by heart ; talked very lightly about divorce , and most energetically of the rights of women . She had pictures of Mr. Fox in every room in the house : when that statesman was in opposition . I am not sure that she had not flung a main with him ; and when he came into office , she took great credit for bringing over to him Sir Pitt and his colleague for Queen ’s Crawley , although Sir Pitt would have come over himself , without any trouble on the honest lady ’s part . It is needless to say that Sir Pitt was brought to change his views after the death of the great Whig statesman . This worthy old lady took a fancy to Rawdon Crawley when a boy , sent him to Cambridge ( in opposition to his brother at Oxford ) , and , when the young man was requested by the authorities of the first - named University to quit after a residence of two years , she bought him his commission in the Life Guards Green . A perfect and celebrated “
41419	41533	41064	41066	the old lady	2255	” or dandy about town , was this young officer . Boxing , rat - hunting , the fives court , and four - in - hand driving were then the fashion of our British aristocracy ; and he was an adept in all these noble sciences . And though he belonged to the household troops , who , as it was their duty to rally round the Prince Regent , had not shown their valour in foreign service yet , Rawdon Crawley had already ( àpropos of play , of which he was immoderately fond ) fought three bloody duels , in which he gave ample proofs of his contempt for death . “
41541	41639	41640	41640	He	3183	” would Mr. Crawley observe , throwing his gooseberry - coloured eyes up to the ceiling . He was always thinking of his brother ’s soul , or of the souls of the souls of those who differed with him in opinion : it is a sort of comfort which many of the serious give themselves . Silly , romantic Miss Crawley , far from being horrified at the courage of her favourite , always used to pay his debts after his duels ; and would not listen to a word that was whispered against his morality . “
41648	41653	41643	41643	his	3183	” she would say , “
41669	41768	41640	41640	He	3183	” BESIDES these honest folks at the Hall ( whose simplicity and sweet rural purity surely show the advantage of a country life over a town one ) , we must introduce the reader to their relatives and neighbours at the Rectory , Bute Crawley and his wife . The Reverend Bute Crawley was a tall , stately , jolly , shovel - hatted man , far more popular in his county than the Baronet his brother . At college he pulled stroke - oar in the Christchurch boat , and had thrashed all the best bruisers of the “
41771	41908	41640	41640	He	3183	” He carried his taste for boxing and athletic exercises into private life ; there was not a fight within twenty miles at which he was not present , nor a race , nor a coursing match , nor a regatta , nor a ball , nor an election , nor a visitation dinner , nor indeed a good dinner in the whole county , but he found means to attend it . You might see his bay - mare and gig - lamps a score of miles away from his Rectory House , whenever there was any dinner - party at Fuddleston , or at Roxby , or at Wapshot Hall , or at the great lords of the county , with all of whom he was intimate . He had a fine voice ; sang “
41917	41921	41640	41640	He	3183	” and gave the “
41923	42211	41640	41640	He	3183	” in chorus with general applause . He rode to hounds in a pepper - and - salt frock , and was one of the best fishermen in the county . Mrs. Crawley , the rector ’s wife , was a smart little body , who wrote this worthy divine ’s sermons . Being of a domestic turn , and keeping the house a great deal with her daughters , she ruled absolutely within the rectory , wisely giving her husband full liberty without . He was welcome to come and go , and dine abroad as many days as his fancy dictated , for Mrs. Crawley was a saving woman and knew the price of port wine . Ever since Mrs. Bute carried off the young Rector of Queen ’s Crawley ( she was of a good family , daughter of the late Lieut.-Colonel Hector Mac Tavish , and she and her mother played for Bute and won him at Harrowgate ) , she had been a prudent and thrifty wife to him . In spite of her care , however , he was always in debt . It took him at least ten years to pay off his college bills contracted during his father ’s lifetime . In the year 179 — , when he was just clear of these incumbrances , he gave the odds of 100 to 1 ( in twenties ) against Kangaroo , who won the Derby . The Rector was obliged to take up the money at a ruinous interest , and had been struggling ever since . His sister helped him with a hundred now and then , but of course his great hope was in her death — when “
42214	42222	41640	41640	He	3183	” ( as he would say ) , “
42231	42683	42223	42223	Matilda	856	” So that the Baronet and his brother had every reason which two brothers possibly can have for being by the ears . Sir Pitt had had the better of Bute in innumerable family transactions . Young Pitt not only did not hunt , but set up a meeting house under his uncle ’s very nose . Rawdon , it was known , was to come in for the bulk of Miss Crawley ’s property . These money transactions — these speculations in life and death — these silent battles for reversionars spoil — make brothers very loving towards each other in Vanity Fair . I , for my part , have known a five - pound note to interpose and knock up a half century ’s attachment between two brethren ; and ca n’t but admire , as I think what a fine and durable thing Love is among worldly people . It can not be supposed that the arrival of such a personage as Rebecca at Queen ’s Crawley , and her gradual establishment in the good graces of all people there , could be unremarked by Mrs. Bute Crawley . Mrs. Bute , who knew how many days the sirloin of beef lasted at the Hall ; how much linen was got ready at the great wash ; how many peaches were on the south wall ; how many doses her ladyship took when she was ill — for such points are matters of intense interest to certain persons in the country — Mrs. Bute , I say , could not pass over the Hall governess without making every inquiry respecting her history and character . There was always the best understanding between the servants at the Rectory and the Hall . There was always a good glass of ale in the kitchen of the former place for the Hall people , whose ordinary drink was very small — and , indeed , the Rector ’s lady knew exactly how much malt went to every barrel of Hall beer — ties of relationship existed between the Hall and Rectory domestics , as between their masters ; and through these channels each family was perfectly well acquainted with the doings of the other . That , by the way , may be set down as a general remark . When you and your brother are friends , his doings are indifferent to you . When you have quarrelled , all his outgoings and incomings you know , as if you were his spy . Very soon after her arrival , Rebecca began to take a regular place in Mrs. Crawley ’s bulletin from the Hall . It was to this effect:—“The
42748	42780	42741	42743	the young ladies	2161	” Then the report would come — the new governess be a rare manager — Sir Pitt be very sweet on her — Mr. Crawley too — He be reading tracts to her—“What
42785	42809	42723	42724	Mr. Pitt	823	” said little , eager , active , black - faced Mrs. Bute Crawley . Finally , the reports were that the governess had “
42812	42909	42910	42911	MY DEAR	15357	” everybody , wrote Sir Pitt ’s letters , did his business , managed his accounts — had the upper hand of the whole house , my lady , Mr. Crawley , the girls and all — at which Mrs. Crawley declared she was an artful hussey , and had some dreadful designs in view . Thus the doings at the Hall were the great food for conversation at the Rectory , and Mrs. Bute ’s bright eyes spied out everything that took place in the enemy ’s camp — everything and a great deal besides . “

Though her appearance is disagreeable , we can not control the operations of nature ; and though her parents were disreputable ( her father being a painter , several times bankrupt , and her mother , as I have since learned , with horror , a dancer at the Opera ) ; yet her talents are considerable , and I can not regret that I received her out of charity . My dread is , lest the principles of the mother — who was represented to me as a French Countess , forced to emigrate in the late revolutionary horrors ; but who , as I have since found , was a person of the very lowest order and morals — should at any time prove to be hereditary in the unhappy young woman whom I took as an outcast . But her principles have hitherto been correct ( I believe ) , and I am sure nothing will occur to injure them in the elegant and refined circle of the eminent Sir Pitt Crawley . ’ “

56276	56338	56339	56339	Stubble	930	“ That Osborne ’s a devil of a fellow . There was a judge ’s daughter at Demerara went almost mad about him ; then there was that beautiful quadroon girl , Miss Pye , at St. Vincent ’s , you know ; and since he ’s been home , they say he ’s a regular Don Giovanni , by Jove . ”
56347	56354	56341	56341	Spooney	929	“ regular Don Giovanni , by Jove ”
56828	56900	56821	56821	he	752	“ Cackle , you ’re a stupid fool . You ’re always talking nonsense and scandal . Osborne is not going to run off with a Duchess or ruin a milliner . Miss Sedley is one of the most charming young women that ever lived . He ’s been engaged to her ever so long ; and the man who calls her names had better not do so in my hearing . ”
57030	57042	57043	57043	Osborne	749	“ Who the deuce asked you to talk about my affairs ? ”
57047	57123	57043	57043	Osborne	749	“ Why the devil is all the regiment to know that I am going to be married ? Why is that tattling old harridan , Peggy O’Dowd , to make free with my name at her d — d supper - table , and advertise my engagement over the three kingdoms ? After all , what right have you to say I am engaged , or to meddle in my business at all , Dobbin ? ”
57124	57128	57129	57129	Dobbin	752	“ It seems to me,”—Captain
57132	57139	57129	57129	Dobbin	752	“ Seems be hanged , Dobbin , ”
57145	57216	57129	57129	Dobbin	752	“ I am under obligations to you , I know it , a d — d deal too well too ; but I wo n’t be always sermonised by you because you ’re five years my senior . I ’m hanged if I ’ll stand your airs of superiority and infernal pity and patronage . Pity and patronage ! I should like to know in what I ’m your inferior ? ”
57217	57222	57223	57224	Captain Dobbin	752	“ Are you engaged ? ”
57227	57243	57223	57224	Captain Dobbin	752	“ What the devil ’s that to you or any one here if I am ? ”
57244	57251	57252	57252	Dobbin	752	“ Are you ashamed of it ? ”
57255	57274	57275	57275	George	749	“ What right have you to ask me that question , sir ? I should like to know , ”
57278	57294	57296	57296	Dobbin	752	“ Good God , you do n’t mean to say you want to break off ? ”
57301	57317	57319	57319	Osborne	749	“ In other words , you ask me if I ’m a man of honour , ”
57323	57352	57319	57319	Osborne	749	“ is that what you mean ? You ’ve adopted such a tone regarding me lately that I ’m — — if I ’ll bear it any more . ”
57353	57401	57319	57319	Osborne	749	“ What have I done ? I ’ve told you you were neglecting a sweet girl , George . I ’ve told you that when you go to town you ought to go to her , and not to the gambling - houses about St. James ’s . ”
57402	57412	57414	57414	George	749	“ You want your money back , I suppose , ”
57420	57434	57436	57436	Dobbin	752	“ Of course I do — I always did , did n’t I ? ”
57438	57446	57436	57436	Dobbin	752	“ You speak like a generous fellow . ”
57447	57458	57459	57459	George	749	“ No , hang it , William , I beg your pardon”—here
57467	57685	57459	57459	George	749	“ you have been my friend in a hundred ways , Heaven knows . You ’ve got me out of a score of scrapes . When Crawley of the Guards won that sum of money of me I should have been done but for you : I know I should . But you should n’t deal so hardly with me ; you should n’t be always catechising me . I am very fond of Amelia ; I adore her , and that sort of thing . Do n’t look angry . She ’s faultless ; I know she is . But you see there ’s no fun in winning a thing unless you play for it . Hang it : the regiment ’s just back from the West Indies , I must have a little fling , and then when I ’m married I ’ll reform ; I will upon my honour , now . And — I say — Bob — don’t be angry with me , and I ’ll give you a hundred next month , when I know my father will stand something handsome ; and I ’ll ask Heavytop for leave , and I ’ll go to town , and see Amelia to - morrow — there now , will that satisfy you ? ”
57686	57699	57701	57705	the good - natured Captain	3820	“ It is impossible to be long angry with you , George , ”
57707	57732	57701	57705	the good - natured Captain	3820	“ and as for the money , old boy , you know if I wanted it you ’d share your last shilling with me . ”
57733	57743	57744	57744	George	749	“ That I would , by Jove , Dobbin , ”
57764	57840	57744	57744	George	749	“ Only I wish you had sown those wild oats of yours , George . If you could have seen poor little Miss Emmy ’s face when she asked me about you the other day , you would have pitched those billiard - balls to the deuce . Go and comfort her , you rascal . Go and write her a long letter . Do something to make her happy ; a very little will . ”
57841	57853	57854	57855	the lieutenant	3006	“ I believe she ’s d — d fond of me , ”
58091	58103	58104	58104	Osborne	749	“ I should have liked to make her a little present , ”
58112	58126	58104	58104	Osborne	749	“ only I am quite out of cash until my father tips up . ”
59405	59413	59383	59383	He	749	“ Why the devil is she here ? ”
59419	59442	59383	59383	He	749	“ George is in town , Papa ; and has gone to the Horse Guards , and will be back to dinner . ”
59464	59547	59462	59462	Jane	908	” with which this worthy man lapsed into his particular chair , and then the utter silence in his genteel , well - furnished drawing - room was only interrupted by the alarmed ticking of the great French clock . When that chronometer , which was surmounted by a cheerful brass group of the sacrifice of Iphigenia , tolled five in a heavy cathedral tone , Mr. Osborne pulled the bell at his right hand violently , and the butler rushed up . “
59550	59555	59556	59557	Mr. George	709	” roared Mr. Osborne . “
59565	59570	59563	59563	sir	15428	” interposed the man . “
59586	59668	59578	59582	I master of the house	3911	” Mr. Osborne scowled . Amelia trembled . A telegraphic communication of eyes passed between the other three ladies . The obedient bell in the lower regions began ringing the announcement of the meal . The tolling over , the head of the family thrust his hands into the great tailpockets of his great blue coat and brass buttons , and without waiting for a further announcement , strode down stairs alone , scowling over his shoulder at the four females . “
59678	59695	59675	59676	my dear	15357	” asked one of the other , as they rose and tripped gingerly behind the sire . “
59703	59789	59696	59696	I	0	” whispered Miss Wirt ; and so , trembling and in silence , this hushed female company followed their dark leader . They took their places in silence . He growled out a blessing , which sounded as gruffly as a curse . The great silver dish - covers were removed . Amelia trembled in her place , for she was next to the awful Osborne , and alone on her side of the table — the gap being occasioned by the absence of George . “
59792	59827	59696	59696	I	0	” says Mr. Osborne , clutching the ladle , fixing his eyes on her , in a sepulchral tone ; and having helped her and the rest , did not speak for a while . “
59835	59841	59842	59842	She	632	” at last he said . “
59878	59956	59876	59876	Jane	908	” Having concluded his observations upon the soup , Mr. Osborne made a few curt remarks respecting the fish , also of a savage and satirical tendency , and cursed Billingsgate with an emphasis quite worthy of the place . Then he lapsed into silence , and swallowed sundry glasses of wine , looking more and more terrible , till a brisk knock at the door told of George ’s arrival , when everybody began to rally . “
59996	60349	60350	60350	We	3918	” His good humour contrasted with his father ’s severity ; and he rattled on unceasingly during dinner , to the delight of all — of one especially , who need not be mentioned . As soon as the young ladies had discussed the orange and the glass of wine which formed the ordinary conclusion of the dismal banquets at Mr. Osborne ’s house , the signal to make sail for the drawing - room was given , and they all arose and departed . Amelia hoped George would soon join them there . She began playing some of his favourite waltzes ( then newly imported ) at the great carved - legged , leather - cased grand piano in the drawing - room overhead . This little artifice did not bring him . He was deaf to the waltzes ; they grew fainter and fainter ; the discomfited performer left the huge instrument presently ; and though her three friends performed some of the loudest and most brilliant new pieces of their rèpertoire , she did not hear a single note , but state thinking , and boding evil . Old Osborne ’s scowl , terrific always , had never before looked so deadly to her . His eyes followed her out of the room , as if she had been guilty of something . When they brought her coffee , she started as though it were a cup of poison which Mr. Hicks , the butler , wished to propose to her . What mystery was there lurking ? Oh , those women . They nurse and cuddle their presentiments , and make darlings of their ugliest thoughts , as they do of their deformed children . The gloom on the paternal countenance had also impressed George Osborne with anxiety . With such eyebrows , and a look so decidedly bilious , how was he to extract that money from the governor , of which George was consumedly in want ? He began praising his father ’s wine . That was generally a successful means of cajoling the old gentleman . “
60385	60386	60388	60388	he	933	” “
60390	60396	60388	60388	he	933	” said the old gentleman . “
60406	60407	60388	60388	he	933	” “
60420	60428	60409	60409	you	15428	” said George , with a laugh . “
60442	60443	60445	60445	he	3922	” “
60447	60452	60445	60445	he	3922	” growled the senior . “
60459	60460	60445	60445	he	3922	” “
60513	60514	60504	60504	He	3926	” “
60521	60576	60504	60504	He	3926	” said the Eyebrows , and they looked more good - humoured ; and George was going to take advantage of this complacency , and bring the supply question on the mahogany , when the father , relapsing into solemnity , though rather cordial in manner , bade him ring the bell for claret . “
60622	60664	60611	60611	I	0	” Amelia heard the claret bell ringing as she sat nervously upstairs . She thought , somehow , it was a mysterious and presentimental bell . Of the presentiments which some people are always having , some surely must come right . “
60673	60684	60685	60685	I	0	” the old gentleman said , after slowly smacking his first bumper—“What
60706	60707	60708	60708	I	0	” “
60720	60731	60708	60708	I	0	” George said , with a self - satisfied grin . “
60739	60740	60708	60708	I	0	” “
60750	60751	60708	60708	I	0	” “
60814	60815	60805	60805	Anybody	2200	” “
60820	60821	60817	60817	you	15428	” “
60853	60854	60855	60857	A pretty boy	3944	” “
60899	61017	60893	60893	sir	15428	” The old gentleman pronounced these aristocratic names with the greatest gusto . Whenever he met a great man he grovelled before him , and my - lorded him as only a freeborn Briton can do . He came home and looked out his history in the Peerage ; he introduced his name into his daily conversation ; he bragged about his Lordship to his daughters . He fell down prostrate and basked in him as a Neapolitan beggar does in the sun . George was alarmed when he heard the names . He feared his father might have been informed of certain transactions at play . But the old moralist eased him by saying serenely : — “
61068	61069	61071	61071	you	0	” “
61075	61085	61073	61073	sir	15428	” says George , making his point at once . “
61107	61133	61134	61134	You	15428	” and he held up a little token which had been netted by Amelia , and contained the very last of Dobbin ’s pound notes . “
61333	61334	61340	61340	sir	15428	” “
61342	61346	61340	61340	sir	15428	” said George . “
61381	61382	61371	61371	George	709	” “
61391	61398	61389	61389	sir	15428	” says George , cracking filberts . “
61411	61412	61401	61402	Mr. Sedley	674	” “
61630	62022	61623	61623	sir	15428	” With which Mr. Osborne spread out the evening paper , and George knew from this signal that the colloquy was ended , and that his Papa was about to take a nap . He hurried upstairs to Amelia in the highest spirits . What was it that made him more attentive to her on that night than he had been for a long time — more eager to amuse her , more tender , more brilliant in talk ? Was it that his generous heart warmed to her at the prospect of misfortune ; or that the idea of losing the dear little prize made him value it more ? She lived upon the recollections of that happy evening for many days afterwards , remembering his words ; his looks ; the song he sang ; his attitude , as he leant over her or looked at her from a distance . As it seemed to her , no night ever passed so quickly at Mr. Osborne ’s house before ; and for once this young person was almost provoked to be angry by the premature arrival of Mr. Sambo with her shawl . George came and took a tender leave of her the next morning ; and then hurried off to the City , where he visited Mr. Chopper , his father ’s head man , and received from that gentleman a document which he exchanged at Hulker & Bullock ’s for a whole pocket - full of money . As George entered the house , old John Sedley was passing out of the banker ’s parlour , looking very dismal . But his godson was much too elated to mark the worthy stock - broker ’s depression , or the dreary eyes which the kind old gentleman cast upon him . Young Bullock did not come grinning out of the parlour with him as had been his wo nt in former years . And as the swinging doors of Hulker , Bullock & Co. closed upon Mr. Sedley , Mr. Quill , the cashier ( whose benevolent occupation it is to hand out crisp bank - notes from a drawer and dispense sovereigns out of a copper shovel ) , winked at Mr. Driver , the clerk at the desk on his right . Mr. Driver winked again . “
62026	62031	61623	61623	sir	15428	” Mr. D. whispered . “
62037	62042	62043	62045	Mr. George Osborne	709	” Mr. Q. said . “
62055	62162	62051	62051	you	15428	” George crammed eagerly a quantity of notes into his pockets , and paid Dobbin fifty pounds that very evening at mess . The very evening Amelia wrote him the tenderest of long letters . Her heart was overflowing with tenderness , but it still foreboded evil . What was the cause of Mr. Osborne ’s dark looks ? she asked . Had any difference arisen between him and her papa ? Her poor papa returned so melancholy from the City , that all were alarmed about him at home — in fine , there were four pages of loves and fears and hopes and forebodings . “
62178	62186	62173	62173	she	677	” George said , as he perused the missive—“and
62199	62982	62173	62173	she	677	” Poor little Emmy , indeed . ABOUT this time there drove up to an exceedingly snug and well appointed house in Park Lane , a travelling chariot with a lozenge on the panels , a discontented female in a green veil and crimped curls on the rumble , and a large and confidential man on the box . It was the equipage of our friend Miss Crawley , returning from Hants . The carriage windows were shut ; the fat spaniel , whose head and tongue ordinarily lolled out of one of them , reposed on the lap of the discontented female . When the vehicle stopped , a large round bundle of shawls was taken out of the carriage by the aid of various domestics and a young lady who accompanied the heap of cloaks . That bundle contained Miss Crawley , who was conveyed upstairs forthwith , and put into a bed and chamber warmed properly as for the reception of an invalid . Messengers went off for her physician and medical man . They came , consulted , prescribed , vanished . The young companion of Miss Crawley , at the conclusion of their interview , came in to receive their instructions , and administered those antiphlogistic medicines which the eminent men ordered . Captain Crawley of the Life Guards rode up from Knightsbridge Barracks the next day ; his black charger pawed the straw before his invalid aunt ’s door . He was most affectionate in his inquiries regarding that amiable relative . There seemed to be much source of apprehension . He found Miss Crawley ’s maid ( the discontented female ) unusually sulky and despondent ; he found Miss Briggs , her dame de compagnie , in tears alone in the drawing - room . She had hastened home , hearing of her beloved friend ’s illness . She wished to fly to her couch , that couch which she , Briggs , had so often smoothed in the hour of sickness . She was denied admission to Miss Crawley ’s apartment . A stranger was administering her medicines — a stranger from the country — an odious Miss … — tears choked the utterance of the dame de compagnie , and she buried her crushed affections and her poor old red nose in her pocket handkerchief . Rawdon Crawley sent up his name by the sulky femme de chambre , and Miss Crawley ’s new companion , coming tripping down from the sick - room , put a little hand into his as he stepped forward eagerly to meet her , gave a glance of great scorn at the bewildered Briggs , and beckoning the young Guardsman out of the back drawing - room , led him downstairs into that now desolate dining - parlour , where so many a good dinner had been celebrated . Here these two talked for ten minutes , discussing , no doubt , the symptoms of the old invalid above stairs ; at the end of which period the parlour bell was rung briskly , and answered on that instant by Mr. Bowls , Miss Crawley ’s large confidential butler ( who , indeed , happened to be at the keyhole during the most part of the interview ) ; and the Captain coming out , curling his moustachios , mounted the black charger pawing among the straw , to the admiration of the little blackguard boys collected in the street . He looked in at the dining - room window , managing his horse , which curvetted and capered beautifully — for one instant the young person might be seen at the window , when her figure vanished , and , doubtless , she went upstairs again to resume the affecting duties of benevolence . Who could this young woman be , I wonder ? That evening a little dinner for two persons was laid in the dining - room — when Mrs. Firkin , the lady ’s maid , pushed into her mistress ’s apartment , and bustled about there during the vacancy occasioned by the departure of the new nurse — and the latter and Miss Briggs sat down to the neat little meal . Briggs was so much choked by emotion that she could hardly take a morsel of meat . The young person carved a fowl with the utmost delicacy , and asked so distinctly for egg - sauce , that poor Briggs , before whom that delicious condiment was placed , started , made a great clattering with the ladle , and once more fell back in the most gushing hysterical state . “
62995	63037	62984	62984	you	3986	” said the person to Mr. Bowls , the large confidential man . He did so . Briggs seized it mechanically , gasped it down convulsively , moaned a little , and began to play with the chicken on her plate . “
63049	63057	63038	63038	I	0	” said the person with great suavity : “
63085	63110	63070	63071	Mr. Bowls	888	” He went downstairs , where , by the way , he vented the most horrid curses upon the unoffending footman , his subordinate . “
63123	63138	63120	63121	Miss Briggs	644	” the young lady said , with a cool , slightly sarcastic , air . “
63157	63168	63169	63169	She	3989	” gurgled out Briggs in an agony of renewed grief . “
63235	63236	63226	63226	yourself	3986	” “
63248	63254	63243	63243	she	3989	” Miss Briggs bleated out . “
63282	63283	63316	63316	she	3989	” “
63293	63307	63308	63308	she	3989	” the other said ( with ever so little of a grin ) ; “
63349	63350	63343	63343	you	3986	” “
63361	63365	63352	63352	I	0	” Arabella said , “
63370	63371	63373	63373	she	3989	” “
63399	63400	63395	63395	I	0	” “
63405	63416	63395	63395	I	0	” Arabella exclaimed , madly inhaling her salts - bottle . “
63427	63440	63424	63425	Miss Briggs	644	” the other said , with the same provoking good - nature . “
63574	63647	63648	63652	the person ” hitherto )	16874	” The placable and soft - hearted Briggs speechlessly pushed out her hand at this appeal ; but she felt the desertion most keenly for all that , and bitterly , bitterly moaned the fickleness of her Matilda . At the end of half an hour , the meal over , Miss Rebecca Sharp ( for such , astonishing to state , is the name of her who has been described ingeniously as “
63650	63677	63679	63679	you	644	” hitherto ) , went upstairs again to her patient ’s rooms , from which , with the most engaging politeness , she eliminated poor Firkin . “
63703	63704	63695	63695	I	0	” “
63708	63805	63706	63706	you	644	” and Firkin came downstairs in a tempest of jealousy , only the more dangerous because she was forced to confine it in her own bosom . Could it be the tempest which , as she passed the landing of the first floor , blew open the drawing - room door ? No ; it was stealthily opened by the hand of Briggs . Briggs had been on the watch . Briggs too well heard the creaking Firkin descend the stairs , and the clink of the spoon and gruel - basin the neglected female carried . “
63810	63821	63808	63808	Firkin	883	” says she , as the other entered the apartment . “
63826	63827	63824	63824	Jane	908	” “
63835	63843	63824	63824	Jane	908	” Firkin said , wagging her head . “
63850	63851	63852	63852	She	4005	” “
63894	63905	63882	63883	Miss B.	966	” And the water - works again began to play . “
63965	63992	63963	63963	Matilda	856	” Miss Briggs , it will be seen by her language , was of a literary and sentimental turn , and had once published a volume of poems—“Trills
63995	63998	63999	64000	Miss B.	966	Nightingale”—by subscription . “
64011	64015	64002	64002	they	4012	” Firkin replied . “
64097	64453	64090	64090	I	0	” Rebecca passed that night in constant watching upon Miss Crawley ; the next night the old lady slept so comfortably , that Rebecca had time for several hours ’ comfortably , repose herself on the sofa , at the foot of her patroness ’s bed ; very soon , Miss Crawley was so well that she sat up and laughed heartily at a perfect imitation of Miss Briggs and her grief , which Rebecca described to her . Briggs ’ weeping snuffle , and her manner of using the handkerchief , were so completely rendered , that Miss Crawley became quite cheerful , to the admiration of the doctors when they visited her , who usually found this worthy woman of the world , when the least sickness attacked her , under the most abject depression and terror of death . Captain Crawley came every day , and received bulletins from Miss Rebecca respecting his aunt ’s health . This improved so rapidly , that poor Briggs was allowed to see her patroness ; and persons with tender hearts may imagine the smothered emotions of that sentimental female , and the affecting nature of the interview . Miss Crawley liked to have Briggs in a good deal soon . Rebecca used to mimic her to her face with the most admirable gravity , thereby rendering the imitation doubly piquant to her worthy patroness . The causes which had led to the deplorable illness of Miss Crawley , and her departure from her brother ’s house in the country , were of such an unromantic nature that they are hardly fit to be explained in this genteel and sentimental novel . For how is it possible to hint of a delicate female , living in good society , that she ate and drank too much , and that a hot supper of lobsters profusely enjoyed at the Rectory was the reason of an indisposition which Miss Crawley herself persisted was solely attributable to the dampness of the weather ? The attack was so sharp that Matilda — as his Reverence expressed it — was very nearly “
64458	65626	64090	64090	I	0	” all the family were in a fever of expectation regarding the will , and Rawdon Crawley was making sure of at least forty thousand pounds before the commencement of the London season . Mr. Crawley sent over a choice parcel of tracts , to prepare her for the change from Vanity Fair and Park Lane for another world ; but a good doctor from Southampton being called in in time , vanquished the lobster which was no nearly fatal to her , and gave her sufficient strength to enable her to return to London . The Baronet did not disguise his exceeding mortification at the turn which affairs took . While everybody was attending on Miss Crawley , and messengers every hour from the Rectory were carrying news of her health to the affectionate folks there , there was a lady in another part of the house , being exceedingly ill , of whom no one took any notice at all ; and this was the lady of Crawley herself . The good doctor shook his head after seeing her ; to which visit Sir Pitt consented , as it could be paid without a fee ; and she was left fading away in her lonely chamber , with no more heed paid to her than to a weed in the park . The young ladies , too , lost much of the inestimable benefit of their governess ’s instruction . So affectionate a nurse was Miss Sharp , that Miss Crawley would take her medicines from no other hand . Firkin had been deposed long before her mistress ’s departure from the country . That faithful attendant found a gloomy consolation on returning to London , in seeing Miss Briggs suffer the same pangs of jealousy and undergo the same faithless treatment to which she herself had been subject . Captain Rawdon got an extension of leave on his aunt ’s illness , and remained dutifully at home . He was always in her antechamber . ( She lay sick in the state bed - room , into which you entered by the little blue saloon . ) His father was always meeting him there ; or if he came down the corridor ever so quietly his father ’s door was sure to open , and the hyæna face of the old gentleman to glare out . What was it set one to watch the other so ? A generous rivalry , no doubt , as to which should be most attentive to the dear sufferer in the state bed - room . Rebecca used to come out and comfort both of them ; or one or the other of them rather . Both of these worthy gentlemen were most anxious to have news of the invalid from her little confidential messenger . At dinner — to which meal she descended for half an hour — she kept the peace between them : after which she disappeared for the night ; when Rawdon would ride over to the depôt of the 150th at Mudbury , leaving his Papa to the society of Mr. Horrocks and his rum and water . She passed as weary a fortnight as ever mortal spent in Miss Crawley ’s sick - room ; but her little nerves seemed to be of iron , as she was quite unshaken by the duty and the tedium of the sick - chamber . She never told until long afterwards how painful that duty was ; how peevish a patient was the jovial old lady ; how angry ; how sleepless ; in what horrors of death ; during what long nights she lay moaning , and in almost delirious agonies respecting that future world which she quite ignored when she was in good health.—Picture to yourself , oh fair young reader , a worldly , selfish , graceless , thankless , religionless old woman , writhing in pain and fear , and without her wig . Picture her to yourself , and ere you be old , learn to love and pray ! Sharp watched this graceless bedside with indomitable patience . Nothing escaped her ; and , like a prudent steward , she found a use for everything . She told many a good story about Miss Crawley ’s illness in after days,—stories which made the lady blush through her artificial carnations . During the illness she was never out of temper ; always alert ; she slept light , having a perfectly clear conscience ; and could take that refreshment at almost any minute ’s warning . And so you saw very few traces of fatigue in her appearance . Her face might be a trifle paler , and the circles round her eyes a little blacker than usual ; but whenever she came out from the sick - room she was always smiling , fresh , and neat , and looked as trim in her little dressing - gown and cap , as in her smartest evening suit . The Captain thought so , and raved about her in uncouth convulsions . The barbed shaft of love had penetrated his dull hide . Six weeks — appropinquity — opportunity — had victimised him completely . He made a confidante of his aunt at the Rectory , of all persons in the world . She rallied him about it ; she had perceived his folly ; she warned him ; she finished by owning that little Sharp was the most clever , droll , odd , good - natured , simple , kindly creature in England . Rawdon must not trifle with her affections , though — dear Miss Crawley would never pardon him for that ; for she , too , was quite overcome by the little governess , and loved Sharp like a daughter . Rawdon must go away — go back to his regiment and naughty London and not play with a poor artless girl ’s feelings . Many and many a time this good - natured lady , compassionating the forlorn life - guardsman ’s condition , gave him an opportunity of seeing Miss Sharp at the Rectory , and of walking home with her , as we have seen . When men of a certain sort , ladies , are in love , though they see the hook and the string , and the whole apparatus with which they are to be taken , they gorge the bait nevertheless — they must come to it — they must swallow it — and are presently struck and landed gasping . Rawdon saw there was a manifest intention on Mrs. Bute ’s part to captivate him with Rebecca . He was not very wise ; but he was a man about town , and had seen several seasons . A light dawned upon his dusky soul , as he thought , through a speech of Mrs. Bute ’s . “
65633	65637	65631	65631	Rawdon	870	” she said . “
65649	65650	65641	65642	Miss Sharp	639	” “
65666	65672	65659	65659	James	945	” inquired the waggish officer . “
65677	65690	65659	65659	James	945	” Mrs. Bute said , with a flash from her black eyes . “
65713	65714	65705	65705	He	4019	” “
65751	65836	65733	65734	Miss Sharp	639	” Rawdon Crawley , Esquire , gave vent to a prodigious whistle , in token of astonishment at this announcement . He could n’t deny it . His father ’s evident liking for Miss Sharp had not escaped him . He knew the old gentleman ’s character well ; and a more unscrupulous old — whyou — he did not conclude the sentence , but walked home , curling his mustachios , and convinced he had found a clue to Mrs. Bute ’s mystery . “
65845	65849	65854	65854	Jove	701	” thought Rawdon , “
65883	65921	65925	65925	he	4025	” When he saw Rebecca alone , he rallied her about his father ’s attachment in his graceful way . She flung up her head scornfully , looked him full in the face , and said , — “
65965	65978	65957	65957	I	0	” said the little woman , looking as stately as a queen . “
66000	66007	66008	66008	You	4027	” said the mustachio - twiddler . “
66017	66024	66008	66008	You	4027	” said she , flashing out . “
66034	66040	66008	66008	You	4027	” the heavy dragoon interposed . “
66114	66149	66102	66102	you	4027	” When Miss Sharp was agitated , and alluded to her maternal relatives , she spoke with ever so slight a foreign accent , which gave a great charm to her clear ringing voice . “
66152	66164	66102	66102	you	4027	” she continued , kindling as she spoke to the Captain ; “
66187	66199	66185	66185	you	4027	” Her feelings gave way , and she burst into tears . “
66227	67343	66225	66225	Rebecca	639	” She was gone . She drove out with Miss Crawley that day . It was before the latter ’s illness . At dinner she was unusually brilliant and lively ; but she would take no notice of the hints , or the nods , or the clumsy expostulations of the humiliated , infatuated guardsman . Skirmishes of this sort passed perpetually during the little campaign — tedious to relate , and similar in result . The Crawley heavy cavalry was maddened by defeat , and routed every day . If the Baronet of Queen ’s Crawley had not had the fear of losing his sister ’s legacy before his eyes , he never would have permitted his dear girls to lose the educational blessings which their invaluable governess was conferring upon them . The old house at home seemed a desert without her , so useful and pleasant had Rebecca made herself there . Sir Pitt ’s letters were not copied and corrected ; his books not made up ; his household business and manifold schemes neglected , now that his little secretary was away . And it was easy to see how necessary such an amanuensis was to him , by the tenor and spelling of the numerous letters which he sent to her , entreating her and commanding her to return . Almost every day brought a frank from the Baronet , enclosing the most urgent prayers to Becky for her return , or conveying pathetic statements to Miss Crawley , regarding the neglected state of his daughters ’ education ; of which documents Miss Crawley took very little heed . Miss Briggs was not formally dismissed , but her place as companion was a sinecure and a derision ; and her company was the fat spaniel in the drawing - room , or occasionally the discontended Firkin in the housekeeper ’s closet . Nor though the old lady would by no means hear of Rebecca ’s departure , was the latter regularly installed in office in Park Lane . Like many wealthy people , it was Miss Crawley ’s habit to accept as much service as she could get from her inferiors ; and good - naturedly to take leave of them when she no longer found them useful . Gratitude among certain rich folks is scarcely natural or to be thought of . They take needy people ’s services as their due . Nor have you , O poor parasite and humble hanger - on , much reason to complain ! Your friendship for Dives is about as sincere as the return which it usually gets . It is money you love , and not the man ; and were Crœsus and his footman to change places you know , you poor rogue , who would have the benefit of your allegiance . And I am not sure , that , in spite of Rebecca ’s simplicity and activity , and gentleness and untiring good humour , the shrewd old London lady , upon whom these treasures of friendship were lavished , had not a lurking suspicion all the while of her affectionate nurse and friend . It must have often crossed Miss Crawley ’s mind that nobody does anything for nothing . If she measured her own feeling towards the world , she must have been pretty well able to gauge those of the world , towards herself ; and perhaps she reflected , that it is the ordinary lot of people to have no friends if they themselves care for nobody . Well , meanwhile Becky was the greatest comfort and convenience to her , and she gave her a couple of new gowns , and an old necklace and shawl , and showed her friendship by abusing all her intimate acquaintances to her new confidante ( than which there ca n’t be a more touching proof of regard ) , and meditated vaguely some great future benefit — to marry her perhaps to Clump , the apothecary , or to settle her in some advantageous way of life ; or at any rate , to send her back to Queen ’s Crawley when she had done with her , and the full London season had begun . When Miss Crawley was convalescent and descended to the drawing - room , Becky sang to her , and otherwise amused her ; when she was well enough to drive out , Becky accompanied her . And amongst the drives which they took , whither , of all places in the world , did Miss Crawley ’s admirable good - nature and friendship actually induce her to penetrate , but to Russell Square , Bloomsbury , and the house of John Sedley , Esquire . Ere that event , many notes had passed , as may be imagined , between the two dear friends . During the months of Rebecca ’s stay in Hampshire , the eternal friendship had ( must it be owned ? ) suffered considerable diminution , and grown so decrepit and feeble with old age as to threaten demise altogether . The fact is , both girls had their own real affairs to think of : Rebecca her advance with her employers — Amelia her own absorbing topic . When the two girls met , and flew into each other ’s arms with that impetuosity which distinguishes the behaviour of young ladies towards each other , Rebecca performed her part of the embrace with the most perfect briskness and energy . Poor little Amelia blushed as she kissed her friend , and thought she had been guilty of something very like coldness towards her . Their first interview was but a very short one . Amelia was just ready to go out for a walk . Miss Crawley was waiting in her carriage below , her people wondering at the locality in which they found themselves , and gazing upon honest Sambo , the black footman of Bloomsbury , as one of the queer natives of the place . But when Amelia came down with her kind smiling looks ( Rebecca must introduce her to her friend , Miss Crawley was longing to see her , and was too ill to leave her carriage)—when , I say , Amelia came down , the Park Lane shoulder - knot aristocracy wondered more and more that such a thing could come out of Bloomsbury ; and Miss Crawley was fairly captivated by the sweet blushing face of the young lady who came forward so timidly and so gracefully to pay her respects to the protector of her friend . “
67356	67371	67372	67372	My	0	” Miss Crawley said , as they drove away westward after the little interview . “
67393	67490	67492	67492	he	4034	” Miss Crawley had a good taste . She liked natural manners — a little timidity only set them off . She liked pretty faces near her ; as she liked pretty pictures and nice china . She talked of Amelia with rapture half - a - dozen times that day . She mentioned her to Rawdon Crawley , who came dutifully to partake of his aunt ’s chicken . Of course , on this Rebecca instantly stated , that Amelia was engaged to be married — to a Lieutenant Osborne — a very old flame . “
67501	67533	67492	67492	he	4034	” Captain Crawley asked , remembering after an effort , as became a guardsman , the number of the regiment , the — th . Rebecca thought that was the regiment . “
67539	67543	67534	67535	The Captain	2862	” she said , “
67548	67549	67545	67546	Captain Dobbin	752	” “
67555	67559	67550	67553	A lanky gawky fellow	4038	” said Crawley , “
67582	67583	67571	67575	a goodish - looking fellow	4040	” “
67586	67592	67597	67597	them	4041	” Miss Rebecca Sharp said , “
67603	67637	67638	67638	He	4034	” Captain Rawdon Crawley burst into a horse - laugh by way of reply ; and being pressed by the ladies to explain , did so when the explosion of hilarity was over . “
67646	67650	67638	67638	He	4034	” said he . “
67691	67692	67693	67693	Rawdon	870	” “
67703	67711	67693	67693	Rawdon	870	” Miss Crawley remarked , highly pleased . “
67775	67776	67770	67770	they	4048	” “
67787	67788	67783	67783	I	0	” “
67809	67826	67827	67827	Rawdon	870	” and the Captain laughed more and more , thinking he had made a good joke . “
67834	67839	67827	67827	Rawdon	870	” his aunt exclaimed . “
67882	67883	67886	67887	Captain Crawley	870	” “
67898	67899	67894	67896	A gambling husband	4057	” “
67908	67925	67927	67927	I	0	” the Captain said with great solemnity ; and then added , a sudden thought having struck him:—“Gad
67938	67939	67927	67927	I	0	” “
67948	67953	67942	67946	a presentable sort of person	4060	” the aunt inquired . “
67966	67971	67959	67959	You	870	” Captain Crawley answered . “
68043	68542	68040	68041	Miss Sharp	639	” Miss Sharp told Crawley the Lieutenant ’s town address ; and a few days after this conversation , Lieutenant Osborne received a letter , in Captain Rawdon ’s school - boy hand , and enclosing a note of invitation from Miss Crawley . Rebecca despatched also an invitation to her darling Amelia , who , you may be sure , was ready enough to accept it when she heard that George was to be of the party . It was arranged that Amelia was to spend the morning with the ladies of Park Lane , where all were very kind to her . Rebecca patronised her with calm superiority : she was so much the cleverer of the two , and her friend so gentle and unassuming , that she always yielded , when anybody chose to command , and so took Rebecca ’s orders with perfect meekness and good humour . Miss Crawley ’s graciousness was also remarkable . She continued her raptures about little Amelia , talked about her before her face as if she were a doll , or a servant , or a picture , and admired her with the most benevolent wonder possible . I admire that admiration which the genteel world sometimes extends to the commonalty . There is no more agreeable object in life than to see May Fair folks condescending . Miss Crawley ’s prodigious benevolence rather fatigued poor little Amelia and I am not sure that of the three ladies in Park Lane she did not find honest Miss Briggs the most agreeable . She sympathised with Briggs as with all neglected or gentle people : she was n’t what you call a woman of spirit . George came to dinner — a repast en garçon with Captain Crawley . The great family coach of the Osbornes transported him to Park Lane from Russell Square ; where the young ladies , who were not themselves invited , and professed the greatest indifference at that slight , nevertheless looked at Sir Pitt Crawley ’s name in the baronetage ; and learned everything which that work had to teach about the Crawley family and their pedigree , and the Binkies , their relatives , & c. , & c. Rawdon Crawley received George Osborne with great frankness and graciousness : praised his play at billiards : asked him when he would have his revenge : was interested about Osborne ’s regiment : and would have proposed piquet to him that very evening , but Miss Crawley absolutely forbade any gambling in her house ; so that the young Lieutenant ’s purse was not lightened by his gallant patron , for that day at least . However , they made an engagement for the next , somewhere : to look at a horse that Crawley had to sell , and to try him in the Park ; and to dine together , and to pass the evening with some jolly fellows . “
68558	68567	68547	68547	you	4062	” Crawley said , with a knowing wink . “
68581	68589	68579	68579	Osborne	749	” he was good enough to add , “
68599	68661	68594	68594	I	0	” Osborne was n’t on duty ; he would join Crawley with pleasure : and the latter , when they met the next day , praised his new friend ’s horsemanship — as he might with perfect honesty — and introduced him to three or four young men of the first fashion , whose acquaintance immensely elated the simple young officer . “
68674	68689	68664	68666	little Miss Sharp	639	” Osborne inquired of his friend over their wine , with a dandified air . “
68717	68826	68707	68708	Miss Sedley	632	” Captain Crawley looked savagely at the Lieutenant out of his little blue eyes , and watched him when he went up to resume his acquaintanceship with the fair governess . Her conduct must have relieved Crawley if there was any jealousy in the bosom of that life - guardsman . When the young men went upstairs , and after Osborne ’s introduction to Miss Crawley , he walked up to Rebecca with a patronising , easy swagger . He was going to be kind to her and protect her . He would even shake hands with her , as a friend of Amelia ’s ; and saying , “
68838	68935	68829	68830	Miss Sharp	639	” held out his left hand towards her , expecting that she would be quite confounded at the honour . Miss Sharp put out her right fore - finger , and gave him a little nod , so cool and killing , that Rawdon Crawley , watching the operations from the other room , could hardly restrain his laughter as he saw the Lieutenant ’s entire discomfiture ; the start he gave , the pause , and the perfect clumsiness with which he at length condescended to take the finger which was offered for his embrace . “
68945	68975	68943	68943	Jove	701	” the Captain said , in a rapture ; and the Lieutenant , by way of beginning the conversation , agreeably asked Rebecca how she liked her new place . “
68979	68986	68943	68943	Jove	701	” said Miss Sharp , coolly , “
69039	69040	69034	69034	I	0	” “
69044	69051	69034	69034	I	0	” Mr. Osborne said , amazed . “
69093	69094	69079	69080	poor governesses	4071	” “
69100	69104	69097	69098	Miss Sharp	639	” Osborne ejaculated . “
69111	69115	69097	69098	Miss Sharp	639	” Rebecca continued . “
69199	69243	69195	69195	you	0	” Osborne was quite savage . The little governess patronised him and persiffléd him until this young British Lion felt quite uneasy ; nor could he muster sufficient presence of mind to find a pretext for backing out of this most delectable conversation . “
69254	69260	69246	69246	you	0	” he said , haughtily . “
69382	69383	69379	69380	Mr. Joseph	674	” “
69399	69404	69408	69408	you	0	” Osborne said kindly . “
69457	69469	69450	69450	I	0	” Mr. Osborne gave a look as much as to say , “
69476	69477	69450	69450	I	0	” “
69619	69806	69807	69807	I	0	” Thus was George utterly routed . Not that Rebecca was in the right ; but she had managed most successfully to put him in the wrong . And he now shamefully fled , feeling , if he stayed another minute , that he would have been made to look foolish in the presence of Amelia . Though Rebecca had had the better of him , George was above the meanness of tale - bearing or revenge upon a lady,—only he could not help cleverly confiding to Captain Crawley , next day , some notions of his regarding Miss Rebecca — that she was a sharp one , a dangerous one , a desperate flirt , & c. ; in all of which opinions Crawley agreed laughingly , and with every one of which Miss Rebecca was made acquainted before twenty - four hours were over . They added to her original regard for Mr. Osborne . Her woman ’s instinct had told her , that it was George who had interrupted the success of her first love - passage , and she esteemed him accordingly . “
69813	69840	69841	69841	I	0	” he said to Rawdon Crawley , with a knowing look — he had bought the horse , and lost some score of guineas after dinner , “
69861	69862	69846	69846	I	0	” “
69869	69880	69864	69864	you	4094	” said Crawley , with a look of peculiar gratitude . “
69889	69942	69886	69886	I	0	” And George went off , thinking Crawley was quite right . He told Amelia of what he had done , and how he had counselled Rawdon Crawley — a devilish good , straight - for - ward fellow — to be on his guard against that little sly , scheming Rebecca . “
69946	69950	69951	69952	Your friend	15401	” Amelia cried . “
69959	69960	69951	69952	Your friend	15401	” “
69969	70076	70077	70077	Rebecca	639	” Amelia said . For her woman ’s eyes , which Love had made sharp - sighted , had in one instant discovered a secret which was invisible to Miss Crawley , to poor virgin Briggs , and above all , to the stupid peepers of that young whiskered prig , Lieutenant Osborne . For as Rebecca was shawling her in an upper apartment , where these two friends had an opportunity for a little of that secret talking and conspiring which forms the delight of female life , Amelia , coming up to Rebecca , and taking her two little hands in hers , said , “
70084	70595	70077	70077	Rebecca	639	” Rebecca kissed her . And regarding this delightful secret , not one syllable more was said by either of the young women . But it was destined to come out before long . Some short period after the above events , and Miss Rebecca Sharp still remaining at her patroness ’s house in Park Lane , one more hatchment might have been seen in Great Gaunt Street , figuring amongst the many which usually ornament that dismal quarter . It was over Sir Pitt Crawley ’s house ; but it did not indicate the worthy baronet ’s demise . It was a feminine hatchment , and indeed a few years back had served as a funeral compliment to Sir Pitt ’s old mother , the late dowager Lady Crawley . Its period of service over , the hatchment had come down from the front of the house , and lived in retirement somewhere in the back premises of Sir Pitt ’s mansion . It re appeared now for poor Rose Dawson . Sir Pitt was a widower again . The arms quartered on the shield along with his own were not , to be sure , poor Rose ’s . She had no arms . But the cherubs painted on the scutcheon answered as well for her as for Sir Pitt ’s mother , and Resurgam was written under the coat , flanked by the Crawley Dove and Serpent . Arms and Hatchments , Resurgam.—Here is an opportunity for moralising ! Mr. Crawley had tended that otherwise friendless bedside . She went out of the world strengthened by such words and comfort as he could give her . For many years his was the only kindness she ever knew ; the only friendship that solaced in any way that feeble , lonely soul . Her heart was dead long before her body . She had sold it to become Sir Pitt Crawley ’s wife . Mothers and daughters are making the same bargain every day in Vanity Fair . When the demise took place , her husband was in London attending to some of his innumerable schemes , and busy with his endless lawyers . He had found time , nevertheless , to call often in Park Lane , and to despatch many notes to Rebecca , entreating her , enjoining her , commanding her to return to her young pupils in the country , who were now utterly without companionship during their mother ’s illness . But Miss Crawley would not hear of her departure ; for though there was no lady of fashion in London who would desert her friends more complacently as soon as she was tired of their society , and though few tired of them sooner , yet as long as her engoûment lasted her attachment was prodigious , and she clung still with the greatest energy to Rebecca . The news of Lady Crawley ’s death provoked no more grief or comment than might have been expected in Miss Crawley ’s family circle . “
70608	70620	70598	70598	I	0	” Miss Crawley said ; and added , after a pause , “
70634	70635	70621	70621	I	0	” “
70648	70745	70640	70640	Pitt	697	” Rawdon remarked , with his usual regard for his elder brother . Rebecca said nothing . She seemed by far the gravest and most impressed of the family . She left the room before Rawdon went away that day ; but they met by chance below , as he was going away after taking leave , and had a parley together . On the morrow , as Rebecca was gazing from the window , she startled Miss Crawley , who was placidly occupied with a French novel , by crying out in an alarmed tone , “
70753	70763	70764	70765	My dear	15357	” and the Baronet ’s knock followed this announcement . “
70811	70822	70799	70799	My	0	” cried out Miss Crawley , and resumed the novel . “
70833	70849	70823	70823	She	4104	” Rebecca said , tripping down to Sir Pitt , who was preparing to ascend . “
70855	70860	70861	70861	I	0	” Sir Pitt answered . “
70878	70886	70887	70887	I	0	” and they entered that apartment together . “
70898	70949	70896	70896	Miss	3081	” the baronet said , fixing his eyes upon her , and taking off his black gloves and his hat with its great crape hat - band . His eyes had such a strange look , and fixed upon her so steadfastly , that Rebecca Sharp began almost to tremble . “
70956	70964	70896	70896	Miss	3081	” she said in a low voice , “
70982	70983	70984	70984	You	15357	” “
70994	70999	70984	70984	You	15357	” replied Sir Pitt , “
71051	71052	71043	71043	you	639	” “
71075	71084	71085	71085	I	0	” Becky said , seemingly in great agitation . “
71093	71102	71085	71085	I	0	” Sir Pitt said , thumping the table . “
71160	71161	71153	71154	Dear Becky	976	” “
71169	71174	71153	71154	Dear Becky	976	” Rebecca gasped out . “
71184	71194	71177	71178	Lady Crawley	871	” the Baronet said , grasping his crape hat . “
71255	71256	71259	71260	Sir Pitt	697	” “
71262	71270	71259	71260	Sir Pitt	697	” Rebecca said , very much moved . “
71276	71281	71274	71274	Becky	976	” Sir Pitt continued . “
71348	71411	71332	71332	I	0	” and the old man fell down on his knees and leered at her like a satyr . Rebecca started back a picture of consternation . In the course of this history we have never seen her lose her presence of mind ; but she did now , and wept some of the most genuine tears that ever fell from her eyes . “
71417	71421	71424	71424	sir	15428	” she said . “
71432	71527	71428	71428	I’m	0	” EVERY reader of a sentimental turn ( and we desire no other ) must have been pleased with the tableau with which the last act of our little drama concluded ; for what can be prettier than an image of Love on his knees before Beauty ? But when Love heard that awful confession from Beauty that she was married already , he bounced up from his attitude of humility on the carpet , uttering exclamations which caused poor little Beauty to be more frightened than she was when she made her avowal . “
71533	71547	71530	71530	you	0	” the Baronet cried , after the first explosion of rage and wonder . “
71571	71572	71548	71548	You	0	” “
71577	71620	71621	71623	O Sir Pitt	697	” Rebecca said , in an agony of tears — her voice choking with emotion , her handkerchief up to her ready eyes , fainting against the mantel - piece — a figure of woe fit to melt the most obdurate heart . “
71652	71653	71644	71644	your	697	” “
71658	71664	71654	71654	Generosity	978	” Sir Pitt roared out . “
71680	71681	71654	71654	Generosity	978	” “
71717	71718	71726	71726	he	4127	” “
71728	71742	71726	71726	he	4127	” the Baronet said , beginning , as he fancied , to comprehend . “
71786	71820	71822	71823	the rascal	4129	” She held out one hand . She cried fit to break her heart ; her ringlets fell over her face , and over the marble mantel - piece where she laid it . “
71829	71841	71822	71823	the rascal	4129	” Sir Pitt said , with a hideous attempt at consolation . “
71855	71856	71847	71847	I	0	” “
71941	72211	72214	72218	the lady on the ground	4137	” Saying which , Rebecca went down on her knees in a most tragical way , and , taking Sir Pitt ’s horny black hand between her own two ( which were very pretty and white , and as soft as satin ) , looked up in his face with an expression of exquisite pathos and confidence , when — when the door opened , and Miss Crawley sailed in . Mrs. Firkin and Miss Briggs , who happened by chance to be at the parlour door soon after the Baronet and Rebecca entered the apartment , had also seen accidentally , through the key - hole , the old gentleman prostrate before the governess , and had heard the generous proposal which he made her . It was scarcely out of his mouth when Mrs. Firkin and Miss Briggs had streamed up the stairs , had rushed into the drawing - room where Miss Crawley was reading the French novel , and had given that old lady the astounding intelligence that Sir Pitt was on his knees , proposing to Miss Sharp . And if you calculate the time for the above dialogue to take place — the time for Briggs and Firkin to fly to the drawing - room — the time for Miss Crawley to be astonished , and to drop her volume of Pigault le Brun — and the time for her to come downstairs — you will see how exactly accurate this history is , and how Miss Crawley must have appeared at the very instant when Rebecca had assumed the attitude of humility . “
72225	72239	72222	72223	the gentleman	2395	” Miss Crawley said , with a look and voice of great scorn . “
72266	72267	72268	72268	I	0	” “
72276	72282	72271	72274	Sir Pitt Crawley Ma’am	697	” Rebecca said , rising , “
72297	72298	72300	72300	him	697	” “
72302	72328	72300	72300	him	697	” Miss Crawley said more bewildered than ever . Briggs and Firkin at the door opened the eyes of astonishment and the lips of wonder . “
72333	72344	72300	72300	him	697	” Rebecca continued , with a sad , tearful voice . “
72362	72368	72369	72369	Ees	980	” the old lady asked . “
72371	72376	72377	72377	I	0	” said the Baronet , “
72380	72381	72369	72369	Ees	980	” “
72390	72391	72383	72383	she	871	” “
72394	72406	72383	72383	she	871	” Sir Pitt said , his features on a broad grin . “
72419	72424	72387	72387	she	871	” Miss Crawley remarked . “
72429	72502	72387	72387	she	871	” answered Sir Pitt , with a coolness and good - humour which set Miss Crawley almost mad with bewilderment . That an old gentleman of station should fall on his knees to a penniless governess , and burst out laughing because should refuse a Baronet with four thousand a year,—these were mysteries which Miss Crawley could never comprehend . It surpassed any complications of intrigue in her favourite Pigault le Brun . “
72514	72524	72506	72506	you	697	” she continued , groping wildly through this amazement . “
72527	72532	72512	72512	brother	15420	” said Sir Pitt . “
72553	72563	72547	72550	a little fox it	4144	” he muttered to himself , chuckling with pleasure . “
72570	72579	72564	72568	Who ’d have thought what	4145	” cries Miss Crawley , stamping her foot . “
72607	72608	72609	72609	My	0	” “
72612	72616	72609	72609	My	0	” Rebecca said , “
72727	72751	72721	72721	my	0	” and she sank down in a chair so pathetically , that most of the audience present were perfectly melted with her sadness . “
72776	72921	72771	72771	your	839	” said Sir Pitt , and putting on his crape - bound hat , he walked away — greatly to Rebecca ’s relief ; for it was evident that her secret was unrevealed to Miss Crawley , and she had the advantage of a brief reprieve . Putting her handkerchief to her eyes , and nodding away honest Briggs , who would have followed her upstairs , she went up to her apartment ; while Briggs and Miss Crawley , in a high state of excitement , remained to discuss the strange event , and Firkin , no less moved , dived down into the kitchen regions , and talked of it with all the male and female company there . And so impressed was Mrs. Firkin with the news , that she thought proper to write off by that very night ’s post , “
72962	73043	72951	72951	she	4156	” The two ladies in the dining - room ( where worthy Miss Briggs was delighted to be admitted once more to a confidential conversation with her patroness ) wondered to their hearts ’ content at Sir Pitt ’s offer , and Rebecca ’s refusal ; Briggs very acutely suggesting that there must have been some obstacle in the shape of a previous attachment , otherwise no young woman in her senses would ever have refused so advantageous a proposal . “
73057	73064	73055	73055	Briggs	644	” Miss Crawley said , kindly . “
73078	73086	73089	73089	Becky	639	” Briggs replied , with meek evasion . “
73101	73130	73131	73131	She	639	” Miss Crawley remarked ( who was mollified by the girl ’s refusal , and very liberal and generous now there was no call for her sacrifices ) . “
73212	73220	73206	73210	that unfortunate ironmonger ’s daughter	4164	” Briggs coincided as usual , and the “
73223	73230	73231	73231	You	4159	” was then discussed in conjectures . “
73242	73247	73248	73248	You	4159	” Miss Crawley said . “
73318	73319	73297	73298	some apothecary	4167	” “
73326	73371	73297	73298	some apothecary	4167	” says Briggs ( who was thinking of twenty - four years back , and that hectic young writing - master whose lock of yellow hair , and whose letters , beautiful in their illegibility , she cherished in her old desk upstairs ) . “
73378	73418	73297	73298	some apothecary	4167	” says Briggs . Once more she was a fresh - cheeked lass of eighteen ; she was at evening church , and the hectic writing - master and she were quavering out of the same psalm - book . “
73427	73433	73297	73298	some apothecary	4167	” Miss Crawley said enthusiastically , “
73504	73843	73490	73490	Briggs	644	” Briggs declared that it would be delightful , and vowed that her dear Miss Crawley was always kind and generous , and went up to Rebecca ’s bed - room to console her and prattle about the offer , and the refusal , and the cause thereof ; and to hint at the generous intentions of Miss Crawley , and to find out who was the gentleman that had the mastery of Miss Sharp ’s heart . Rebecca was very kind , very affectionate and affected — responded to Brigg ’s offer of tenderness with grateful fervour — owned there was a secret attachment — a delicious mystery — what a pity Miss Briggs had not remained half a minute longer at the key - hole ! Rebecca might , perhaps , have told more : but five minutes after Miss Briggs ’s arrival in Rebecca ’s apartment , Miss Crawley actually made her appearance there — an unheard - of honour;—her impatience had overcome her ; she could not wait for the tardy operations of her ambassadress : so she came in person , and ordered Briggs out of the room . And expressing her approval of Rebecca ’s conduct , she asked particulars of the interview , and the previous transactions which had brought about the astonishing offer of Sir Pitt . Rebecca said she had long had some notion of the partiality with which Sir Pitt honoured her , ( for he was in the habit of making his feelings known in a very frank and unreserved manner , ) but , not to mention private reasons with which she would not for the present trouble Miss Crawley , Sir Pitt ’s age , station , and habits were such as to render a marriage quite impossible ; and could a woman with any feeling of self - respect and any decency listen to proposals at such a moment , when the funeral of the lover ’s deceased wife had not actually taken place ? “
73866	73878	73849	73849	you	15357	” Miss Crawley said , coming to her point at once . “
73905	73917	73893	73894	some one	16671	” Rebecca cast down her eyes , and owned there was . “
73926	73937	73918	73918	You	15357	” she said , with a sweet simple faltering voice . “
73971	73972	73966	73966	I	0	” “
73978	73992	73966	73966	I	0	” cried Miss Crawley , who was always quite ready to be sentimental , “
74016	74017	74012	74012	me	0	” “
74026	74035	74020	74020	you	15357	” Rebecca said in the same tearful tone . “
74044	74108	74040	74040	I	0	” And she laid her head upon Miss Crawley ’s shoulder and wept there so naturally that the old lady , surprised into sympathy , embraced her with an almost maternal kindness , uttered many soothing protests of regard and affection for her , vowed that she loved her as a daughter , and would do everything in her power to serve her . “
74156	74157	74147	74147	you	15357	” “
74164	74168	74147	74147	you	15357	” Rebecca said . “
74192	74193	74188	74188	I	0	” “
74201	74210	74195	74195	you	15357	” the old lady replied , kissing her . “
74218	74223	74211	74211	I	0	” sobbed out Rebecca , “
74243	74687	74688	74688	You	4194	” And in the midst of mutual tears — for the emotions of the younger woman had awakened the sympathies of the elder — this promise was solemnly given by Miss Crawley , who left her little protégée , blessing and admiring her as a dear , artless , tender - hearted , affectionate , incomprehensible creature . And now she was left alone to think over the sudden and wonderful events of the day , and of what had been and what might have been . What think you were the private feelings of Miss , no ( begging her pardon ) of Mrs. Rebecca ? If , a few pages back , the present writer claimed the privilege of peeping into Miss Amelia Sedley ’s bedroom , and understanding with the omniscience of the novelist all the gentle pains and passions which were tossing upon that innocent pillow , why should he not declare himself to be Rebecca ’s confidante too , master of her secrets , and seal - keeper of that young woman ’s conscience ? Well , then , in the first place , Rebecca gave way to some very sincere and touching regrets that a piece of marvellous good fortune should have been so near her , and she actually obliged to decline it . In this natural emotion every properly regulated mind will certainly share . What good mother is there that would not commiserate a penniless spinster , who might have been my lady , and have shared four thousand a year ? What well - bred young person is there in all Vanity Fair , who will not feel for a hard working , ingenious , meritorious girl , who gets such an honourable , advantageous , provoking offer , just at the very moment when it is out of her power to accept it ? I am sure our friend Becky ’s disappointment deserves and will command every sympathy . I remember one night being in the Fair myself , at an evening party . I observed old Miss Today there also present , single out for her special attentions and flattery little Mrs. Briefless , the barrister ’s wife , who is of a good family certainly , but , as we all know , is as poor as poor can be . What , I asked in my own mind , can cause this obsequiousness on the part of Miss Toady ; has Briefless got a county court , or his wife had a fortune left her ? Miss Toady explained presently , with that simplicity which distinguishes all her conduct . “
74691	74695	74688	74688	You	4194	” she said , “
74736	76643	76645	76645	she	4197	” And Toady asked Briefless and his wife to dinner the very next week . If the mere chance of becoming a baronet ’s daughter can procure a lady such homage in the world , surely , surely we may respect the agonies of a young woman who has lost the opportunity of becoming a baronet ’s wife . Who would have dreamed of Lady Crawley dying so soon ? She was one of those sickly women that might have lasted these ten years — Rebecca thought to herself , in all the woes of repentance — and I might have been my lady ! I might have led that old man whither I would . I might have thanked Mrs. Bute for her patronage , and Mr. Pitt for his insufferable condescension . I would have had the town - house newly furnished and decorated . I would have had the handsomest carriage in London , and a box at the opera ; and I would have been presented next season . All this might have been , and now — now all was doubt and mystery . But Rebecca was a young lady of too much resolution and energy of character to permit herself much useless and unseemly sorrow for the irrevocable past ; so , having devoted only the proper portion of regret to it , she wisely turned her whole attention towards the future , which was now vastly more important to her . And she surveyed her position , and its hopes , doubts , and chances . In the first place , she was married;—that was a great fact . Sir Pitt knew it . She was not so much surprised into the avowal , as induced to make it by a sudden calculation . It must have come some day : and why not now as at a later period ? He who would have married her himself must at least be silent with regard to her marriage . How Miss Crawley would bear the news — was the great question . Misgivings Rebecca had ; but she remembered all Miss Crawley had said ; the old lady ’s avowed contempt for birth ; her daring liberal opinions ; her general romantic propensities ; her almost doting attachment to her nephew , and her repeatedly - expressed fondness for Rebecca herself . She is so fond of him , Rebecca thought , that she will forgive him anythin she is so used to me that I do n’t think she could be comfortable without me : when the éclaircissement comes there will be a scene , and hysterics , and a great quarrel , and then a great reconciliation . At all events , what use was there in delaying ? the die was thrown , and now or to - morrow the issue must be the same . And so , resolved that Miss Crawley should have the news , the young person debated in her mind as to the best means of conveying it to her ; and whether she should face the storm that must come , or fly and avoid it until its first fury was blown over . In this state of meditation she wrote the following letter : — Dearest Friend,—The great crisis which we have debated about so often is come . Half of my secret is known , and I have thought and thought , until I am quite sure that now is the time to reveal the whole of the mystery . Sir Pitt came to me this morning , and made — what do you think?—a declaration in form . Think of that ! Poor little me . I might have been Lady Crawley . How pleased Mrs. Bute would have been and ma tante if I had taken precedence of her . I might have been somebody ’s mamma , instead of — O , I tremble , I tremble , when I think how soon we must tell all ! — Sir Pitt knows I am married , and not knowing to whom , is not very much displeased as yet . Ma tante is actually angry that I should have refused him . But she is all kindness and graciousness . She condescends to say I would have made him a good wife ; and vows that she will be a mother to your little Rebecca . She will be shaken when she first hears the news . But need we fear anything beyond a momentary anger ? I think not : I am sure not . She dotes upon you so ( you naughty , good - for - nothing man ) , that she would pardon you anythin and , indeed , I believe , the next place in her heart is mine : and that she would be miserable without me . Dearest ! something tells me we shall conquer . You shall leave that odious regiment : quit gaming , racing , and be a good boy ; and we shall all live in Park Lane , and ma tante shall leave us all her money . I shall try and walk to - morrow at 3 in the usual place . If Miss B. accompanies me , you must come to dinner , and bring an answer , and put it in the third volume of Porteus ’s Sermons . But , at all events , come to your own R. To Miss Eliza Styles , At Mr. Barnet ’s , Saddler , Knightsbridge . Dearest Friend,—The great crisis which we have debated about so often is come . Half of my secret is known , and I have thought and thought , until I am quite sure that now is the time to reveal the whole of the mystery . Sir Pitt came to me this morning , and made — what do you think?—a declaration in form . Think of that ! Poor little me . I might have been Lady Crawley .

But , at all events , come to your own R. To Miss Eliza Styles , At Mr. Barnet ’s , Saddler , Knightsbridge . And I trust there is no reader of this little story who has not discernment enough to perceive that the Miss Eliza Styles ( an old schoolfellow , Rebecca said , with whom she had resumed an active correspondence of late , and who used to fetch these letters from the saddler ’s ) , wore brass spurs , and large curling mustachios , and was indeed no other than Captain Rawdon Crawley . HOW they were married is not of the slightest consequence to anybody . What is to hinder a Captain who is a major , and a young lady who is of age , from purchasing a license , and uniting themselves at any church in this town ? Who needs to be told , that if a woman has a will , she will assuredly find a way?—My belief is , that one day , when Miss Sharp had gone to pass the forenoon with her dear friend Miss Amelia Sedley in Russell Square , a lady very like her might have been seen entering a church in the City , in company with a gentleman with dyed mustachios , who , after a quarter of an hour ’s interval , escorted her back to the hackney - coach in waiting , and that this was a quiet bridal party . And who on earth , after the daily experience we have , can question the probability of a gentleman marrying anybody ? How many of the wise and learned have married their cooks ? Did not Lord Eldon himself , the most prudent of men , make a run - away match ? Were not Achilles and Ajax both in love with their servant maids ? And are we to expect a heavy dragoon with strong desires and small brains , who had never controlled a passion in his life , to become prudent all of a sudden , and to refuse to pay any price for an indulgence to which he had a mind ? If people only made prudent marriages , what a stop to population there would be ! It seems to me , for my part , that Mr. Rawdon ’s marriage was one of the honestest actions which we shall have to record in any portion of that gentleman ’s biography which has to do with the present history . No one will say it is unmanly to be captivated by a woman , or , being captivated , to marry her ; and the admiration , the delight , the passion , the wonder , the unbounded confidence , and frantic adoration with which , by degrees , this big warrior got to regard the little Rebecca , were feelings which the ladies at least will pronounce were not altogether discreditable to him . When she sang , every note thrilled in his dull soul , and tingled through his huge frame . When she spoke , he brought all the force of his brains to listen and wonder . If she was jocular , he used to revolve her jokes in his mind , and explode over them half an hour afterwards in the street , to the surprise of the groom in the tilbury by his side , or the comrade riding with him in Rotten Row . Her words were oracles to him , her smallest actions marked by an infallible grace and wisdom . “
76650	76654	76647	76647	she	4197	” thought he . “
76666	76677	76656	76656	she	4197	” And he would say to her in confidential moments , “
76702	76827	76700	76700	Jove	701	” Is his case a rare one ? and do n’t we see every day in the world many an honest Hercules at the apron - strings of Omphale and great whiskered Samsons prostrate in Delilah ’s lap ? When , then , Becky told him that the great crisis was near , and the time for action had arrived , Rawdon expressed himself as ready to act under her orders , as he would be to charge with his troop at the command of his colonel . There was no need for him to put his letter into the third volume of Porteus . Rebecca easily found a means to get rid of Briggs , her companion , and met her faithful friend in “
76831	76888	76927	76927	Beck	639	” on the next day . She had thought over matters at night , and communicated to Rawdon the result of her determinations . He agreed , of course , to everything ; was quite sure that it was all right ; that what she proposed was best ; that Miss Crawley would infallibly relent , or “
76892	76917	76927	76927	Beck	639	” as he said , after a time . Had Rebecca ’s resolutions been entirely different , he would have followed them as implicitly . “
76929	76933	76927	76927	Beck	639	” said he . “
76963	77637	77638	77638	My	0	” And with this simple confession of faith , the love - stricken dragoon left her to execute his part of the project which she had formed for the pair . It consisted simply in the hiring of quiet lodgings at Brompton , or in the neighbourhood of the barracks , for Captain and Mrs. Crawley . For Rebecca had determined , and very prudently , we think , to fly . Rawdon was only too happy at her resolve ; he had been entreating her to take this measure any time for weeks past . He pranced off to engage the lodgings with all the impetuosity of love . He agreed to pay two guineas a week so readily , that the landlady regretted she had asked him so little . He ordered in a piano , and half a nursery - house full of flowers : and a heap of good things . As for shawls , kid gloves , silk stockings , gold French watches , bracelets and perfumery , he sent them in with the profusion of blind love and unbounded credit . And having relieved his mind by this outpouring of generosity , he went and dined nervously at the club , waiting until the great moment of his life should come . The occurrences of the previous day ; the admirable conduct of Rebecca in refusing an offer so advantageous to her , the secret unhappiness preying upon her , the sweetness and silence with which she bore her affliction , made Miss Crawley much more tender than usual . An event of this nature , a marriage , or a refusal , or a proposal , thrills through a whole household of women , and sets all their hysterical sympathies at work . As an observer of human nature , I regularly frequent St. George ’s , Hanover Square , during the genteel marriage season ; and though I have never seen the bridegroom ’s male friends give way to tears , or the beadles and officiating clergy any way affected , yet it in not at all uncommon to see women who are not in the least concerned in the operations going on — old ladies who are long past marrying , stout middle - aged females with plenty of sons and daughters , let alone pretty young creatures in pink bonnets , who are on their promotion , and may naturally take an interest in the ceremony — I say it is quite common to see the women present piping , sobbing , sniffling ; hiding their little faces in their little useless pocket - handkerchiefs ; and heaving , old and young , with emotion . When my friend , the fashionable John Pimlico , married the lovely Lady Belgravia Green Parker , the excitement was so general , that even the little snuffy old pew - opener who let me into the seat was in tears . And wherefore ? I inquired of my own soul : she was not going to be married . Miss Crawley and Briggs in a word , after the affair of Sir Pitt , indulged in the utmost luxury of sentiment , and Rebecca became an object of the most tender interest to them . In her absence Miss Crawley solaced herself with the most sentimental of the novels in her library . Little Sharp , with her secret griefs , was the heroine of the day . That night Rebecca sang more sweetly and talked more pleasantly than she had ever been heard to do in Park Lane . She twined herself round the heart of Miss Crawley . She spoke lightly and laughingly of Sir Pitt ’s proposal , ridiculed it as the foolish fancy of an old man ; and her eyes filled with tears , and Briggs ’s heart with unutterable pangs of defeat , as she said she desired no other lot than to remain for ever with her dear benefactress . “
77643	77649	77638	77638	My	0	” the old lady said , “
77737	78262	77726	77726	you	4203	” If Rawdon Crawley had been then and there present , instead of being at the club nervously drinking claret , the pair might have gone down on their knees before the old spinster , avowed all , and been forgiven in a twinkling . But that good chance was denied to the young couple , doubtless in order that this story might be written , in which numbers of their wonderful adventures are narrated — adventures which could never have occurred to them if they had been housed and sheltered under the comfortable uninteresting forgiveness of Miss Crawley . Under Mrs. Firkin ’s orders , in the Park Lane establishment , was a young woman from Hampshire , whose business it was , among other duties , to knock at Miss Sharp ’s door with that jug of hot water , which Firkin would rather have perished than have presented to the intruder . This girl , bred on the family estate , had a brother in Captain Crawley ’s troop , and if the truth were known , I dare say it would come out that she was aware of certain arrangements , which have a great deal to do with this history . At any rate she purchased a yellow shawl , a pair of green boots , and a light blue hat with a red feather with three guineas which Rebecca gave her , and as little Sharp was by no means too liberal with her money , no doubt it was for services rendered that Betty Martin was so bribed . On the second day after Sir Pitt Crawley ’s offer to Miss Sharp , the sun rose as usual , and at the usual hour Betty Martin , the upstairs maid , knocked at the door of the governess ’s bed - chamber . No answer was returned , and she knocked again . Silence was still uninterrupted ; and Betty , with the hot water , opened the door and entered the chamber . The little white dimity bed was as smooth and trim as on the day previous , when Betty ’s own hands had helped to make it . Two little trunks were corded in one end of the room ; and on the table before the window — on the pincushion — the great fat pincushion lined with pink inside , and twilled like a lady ’s nightcap — lay a letter . It had been reposing there probably all night . Betty advanced towards it on tiptoe , as if she were afraid to awake it — looked at it , and round the room , with an air of great wonder and satisfaction ; took up the letter , and grinned intensely as she turned it round and over , and finally carried it into Miss Briggs ’s room below . How could Betty tell that the letter was for Miss Briggs , I should like to know ? All the schooling Betty had was at Mrs. Bute Crawley ’s Sunday School , and she could no more read writing than Hebrew . “
78268	78273	77726	77726	you	4203	” the girl exclaimed , “
78313	78314	78312	78312	Miss.	778	” “
78317	78336	78301	78301	she’ve	639	” cries Briggs , dropping her comb , the thin wisp of faded hair falling over her shoulders ; “
78351	78366	78312	78312	Miss.	778	” and she eagerly broke the neat seal , and , as they say , “
78370	78378	78379	78381	Dear Miss Briggs	644	” of the letter addressed to her . “
78383	78388	78379	78381	Dear Miss Briggs	644	” the refugee wrote , “
78752	78755	78732	78732	I	0	“ Midnight . ”
78756	78761	78762	78763	the refugee	17367	“ Dear Miss Briggs , ”
78766	79130	78762	78763	the refugee	17367	“ the kindest heart in the world , as yours is , will pity and sympathise with me and excuse me . With tears , and prayers , and blessings , I leave the home where the poor orphan has ever met with kindness and affection . Claims even superior to those of my benefactress call me hence . I go to my duty — to my husband . Yes , I am married . My husband commands me to seek the humble home which we call ours . Dearest Miss Briggs , break the news as your delicate sympathy will know how to do it — to my dear , my beloved friend and benefactress . Tell her , ere I went , I shed tears on her dear pillow — that pillow that I have so often soothed in sickness — that I long again to watch — Oh , with what joy shall I return to dear Park Lane ! How I tremble for the answer which is to seal my fate ! When Sir Pitt deigned to offer me his hand , an honour of which my beloved Miss Crawley said I was deserving ( my blessings go with her for judging the poor orphan worthy to be her sister ! ) I told Sir Pitt that I was already a wife . Even he forgave me . But my courage failed me , when I should have told him all — that I could not be his wife , for I was his daughter ! I am wedded to the best and most generous of men — Miss Crawley ’s Rawdon is my Rawdon . At his command I open my lips , and follow him to our humble home , as I would through the world . O , my excellent and kind friend , intercede with my Rawdon ’s beloved aunt for him and the poor girl to whom all his noble race have shown such unparalleled affection . Ask Miss Crawley to receive her children . I can say no more , but blessings , blessings on all in the dear house I leave , prays “
79133	79165	78762	78763	the refugee	17367	” Just as Briggs had finished reading this affecting and interesting document , which reinstated her in her position as first confidante of Miss Crawley , Mrs. Firkin entered the room . “
79194	79249	79192	79192	Miss	3081	” And to the surprise of Firkin , clasping her dressing - gown around her , the wisp of hair floating dishevelled behind her , the little curl - papers still sticking in bunches round her forehead , Briggs sailed down to Mrs. Bute with the letter in her hand containing the wonderful news . “
79255	79259	79252	79253	Mrs. Firkin	883	” gasped Betty , “
79284	79741	79277	79277	they	4246	” We would devote a chapter to describe the emotions of Mrs. Firkin , did not the passions of her mistresses occupy our genteeler muse . When Mrs. Bute Crawley , numbed with midnight travelling , and warming herself at the newly crackling parlour fire , heard from Miss Briggs the intelligence of the clandestine marriage , she declared it was quite providential that she should have arrived at such a time to assist poor dear Miss Crawley in supporting the shock — that Rebecca was an artful little hussy of whom she had always had her suspicions ; and that as for Rawdon Crawley , she never could account for his aunt ’s infatuation regarding him , and had long considered him a profligate , lost , and abandoned being . And this awful conduct , Mrs. Bute said , will have at least this good effect , it will open poor dear Miss Crawley ’s eyes to the real character of this wicked man . Then Mrs. Bute had a comfortable hot toast and tea ; and as there was a vacant room in the house now , there was no need for her to remain at the Gloster Coffee House where the Portsmouth mail had set her down , and whence she ordered Mr. Bowls ’s aide - de - camp the footman to bring away her trunks . Miss Crawley , be it known , did not leave her room until near noon — taking chocolate in bed in the morning , while Becky Sharp read the Morning Post to her , or otherwise amusing herself or dawdling . The conspirators below agreed that they would spare the dear lady ’s feelings until she appeared in her drawing - room : meanwhile it was announced to her , that Mrs. Bute Crawley had come up from Hampshire by the mail , was staying at the Gloster , sent her love to Miss Crawley , and asked for breakfast with Miss Briggs . The arrival of Mrs. Bute , which would not have caused any extreme delight at another period , was hailed with pleasure now ; Miss Crawley being pleased at the notion of a gossip with her sister - in - law regarding the late Lady Crawley , the funeral arrangements pending , and Sir Pitt ’s abrupt proposals to Rebecca . It was not until the old lady was fairly ensconced in her usual arm - chair in the drawing - room , and the preliminary embraces and inquiries had taken place between the ladies , that the conspirators thought it advisable to submit her to the operation . Who has not admired the artifices and delicate approaches with which women “
79743	79783	79785	79785	she	4247	” their friends for bad news ? Miss Crawley ’s two friends made such an apparatus of mystery before they broke the intelligence to her , that they worked her up to the necessary degree of doubt and alarm . “
79802	79807	79794	79795	Miss Crawley	839	” Mrs. Bute said , “
79817	79818	79811	79811	she	4247	” “
79826	79831	79811	79811	she	4247	” Miss Crawley answered . “
79843	79844	79839	79839	Briggs	644	” “
79849	79853	79846	79847	somebody else	2340	” Briggs gasped . “
79864	79865	79859	79859	she	4247	” “
79869	79889	79859	79859	she	4247	” Mrs. Bute chimed in ; and both sate with clasped hands looking from each other at their victim . “
79913	79919	79920	79920	She	4247	” cried out Miss Crawley . “
79949	79950	79944	79944	she	4247	” “
79977	79983	79970	79970	I	0	” the old lady said . “
79991	79996	79997	79997	She	4247	” cried Mrs. Bute . “
80004	80008	79997	79997	She	4247	” Briggs exclaimed . “
80014	80015	79997	79997	She	4247	” “
80034	80035	80031	80032	Miss Briggs	644	” “
80042	80050	79997	79997	She	4247	” cries the spinster in a nervous fury “
80059	80060	80061	80061	She	4247	” “
80066	80071	80090	80091	Miss Briggs	644	” cried the victim . “
80082	80083	80084	80085	O Ma’am	1001	” “
80100	80101	80102	80102	Rawdon	870	” “
80158	80168	80153	80153	you	644	” the poor old lady screamed in hysteric sentences . “
80188	80189	80190	80190	Her	4264	” “
80196	80212	80193	80194	a Montmorency	848	” cried out the old lady , pulling at the bell with all her might . “
80231	80295	80221	80221	she	4264	” said Mrs. Bute . Miss Crawley gave a final scream , and fell back in a faint . They were forced to take her back to the room which she had just quitted . One fit of hysterics succeeded another . The doctor was sent for — the apothecary arrived . Mrs. Bute took up the post of nurse by her bedside . “
80305	80342	80296	80297	Her relations	4205	” that amiable woman said . She had scarcely been carried up to her room , when a new person arrived to whom it was also necessary to break the news . This was Sir Pitt . “
80347	80354	80345	80345	Becky	639	” he said , coming in . “
80370	80371	80360	80360	She	639	” “
80384	80388	80360	80360	She	639	” Briggs asked . “
80395	80400	80401	80401	I	0	” Sir Pitt asked . “
80425	80426	80413	80413	her	639	” “
80434	80439	80428	80428	you	0	” Miss Briggs asked , “
80469	80643	80645	80647	the old lady	2255	” When Sir Pitt Crawley heard that Rebecca was married to his son , he broke out into a fury of language , which it would do no good to repeat in this place , as indeed it sent poor Briggs shuddering out of the room ; and with her we will shut the door upon the figure of the frenzied old man , wild with hatred and insane with baffled desire . One day after he went to Queen ’s Crawley , he burst like a madman into the room she had used when there — dashed open her boxes with his foot , and flung about her papers , clothes , and other relics . Miss Horrocks , the butler ’s daughter , took some of them . The children dressed themselves and acted plays in the others . It was but a few days after the poor mother had gone to her lonely burying place ; and was laid , unwept and disregarded , in a vault full of strangers . “
80653	80717	80719	80719	she	2255	” Rawdon said to his little wife , as they sate together in the snug little Brompton lodgings . She had been trying the new piano all the morning . The new gloves fitted her to a nicety ; the new shawls became her wonderfully ; the new rings glittered on her little hands , and the new watch ticked at her waist ; “
80729	80730	80719	80719	she	2255	” “
80737	80748	80731	80731	I	0	” she said ; and Delilah patted Samson ’s cheek . “
80754	80763	80749	80749	You	639	” he said , kissing the little hand . “
80786	81218	80784	80784	Jove	701	” IF there is any exhibition in all Vanity Fair which Satire and Sentiment can visit arm in arm together ; where you light on the strangest contrasts laughable and tearful : where you may be gentle and pathetic , or savage and cynical with perfect propriety : it is at one of those public assemblies , a crowd of which are advertised every day in the last page of the Times newspaper , and over which the late Mr. George Robins used to preside with so much dignity . There are very few London people , as I fancy , who have not attended at these meetings , and all with a taste for moralizing must have thought , with a sensation and interest not a little startling and queer , of the day when their turn shall come too , and Mr. Hammerdown will sell by the orders of Diogenes ’s assignees , or will be instructed by the executors , to offer to public competition , the library , furniture , plate , wardrobe , and choice cellar of wines of Epicurus deceased . Even with the most selfish disposition , the Vanity - fairian , as he witnesses this sordid part of the obsequies of a departed friend , ca n’t but feel some sympathies and regret . My Lord Dives ’s remains are in the family vault : the statuaries are cutting an inscription veraciously commemorating his virtues , and the sorrows of his heir , who is disposing of his goods . What guest at Dives ’s table can pass the familiar house without a sigh?—the familiar house of which the lights used to shine so cheerfully at seven o’clock , of which the hall - doors opened so readily , of which the obsequious servants , as you passed up the comfortable stair , sounded your name from landing to landing , until it reached the apartment where jolly old Dives welcomed his friends ! What a number of them he had ; and what a noble way of entertaining them . How witty people used to be here who were morose when they got out of the door ; and how courteous and friendly men who slandered and hated each other everywhere else ! He was pompous , but with such a cook what would one not swallow ? he was rather dull , perhaps , but would not such wine make any conversation pleasant ? We must get some of his Burgundy at any price , the mourners cry at his club . “
81229	81237	81219	81219	I	0	” Pincher says , handing it round , “
81254	81723	80784	80784	Jove	701	” and they talk of the way in which young Dives is dissipating his fortune . How changed the house is , though ! The front is patched over with bills , setting forth the particulars of the furniture in staring capitals . They have hung a shred of carpet out of an upstairs window — a half dozen of porters are lounging on the dirty steps — the hall swarms with dingy guests of oriental countenance , who thrust printed cards into your hand , and offer to bid . Old women and amateurs have invaded the upper apartments , pinching the bed - curtains , poking into the feathers , shampooing the mattresses , and clapping the wardrobe drawers to and fro . Enterprising young housekeepers are measuring the looking - glasses and hangings to see if they will suit the new ménage—(Snob will brag for years that he has purchased this or that at Dives ’s sale , ) and Mr. Hammerdown is sitting on the great mahogany dining - tables , in the dining - room below , waving the ivory hammer , and employing all the artifices of eloquence , enthusiasm , entreaty , reason , despair ; shouting to his people ; satirizing Mr. Davids for his sluggishness ; inspiriting Mr. Moss into action ; imploring , commanding , bellowing , until down comes the hammer like fate , and we pass to the next lot . O Dives , who would ever have thought , as we sat around the broad table sparkling with plate and spotless linen , to have seen such a dish at the head of it as that roaring auctioneer ? It was rather late in the sale . The excellent drawing - room furniture by the best makers ; the rare and famous wines selected , regardless of cost , and with the well - known taste of the purchaser ; the rich and complete set of family plate had been sold on the previous days . Certain of the best wines ( which all had a great character among amateurs in the neighbourhood ) had been purchased for his master . who knew them very well , by the butler of our friend John Osborne , Esquire , of Russell Square . A small portion of the most useful articles of the plate had been bought by some young stock - brokers from the City . And now the public being invited to the purchase of minor objects , it happened that the orator on the table was expatiating on the merits of a picture , which he sought to recommend to his audience : it was by no means so select or numerous a company as had attended the previous days of the auction . “
81728	81733	80784	80784	Jove	701	” roared Mr. Hammerdown . “
81767	81799	81757	81757	Blowman	1012	” A long , pale , military - looking gentleman , seated demurely at the mahogany table , could not help grinning as this valuable lot was shown by Mr. Blowman . “
81820	81839	81811	81811	we	4281	” but the Captain , blushing in a very hurried and discomfited manner , turned away his head . “
81868	81869	81870	81870	I	0	” “
81880	81886	81887	81887	he	4283	” said a professional wag , “
81895	81922	81887	81887	he	4283	” at which ( for the elephant - rider was represented as of a very stout figure ) there was a general giggle in the room . “
81938	81943	81935	81936	Mr. Moss	1010	” Mr. Hammerdown said ; “
82029	82315	82019	82019	gentlemen	3038	” Some one bid five shillings , at which the military gentleman looked towards the quarter from which this splendid offer had come , and there saw another officer with a young lady on his arm , who both appeared to be highly amused with the scene , and to whom , finally , this lot was knocked down for half - a - guinea . He at the table looked more surprised and discomposed than ever when he spied this pair , and his head sank into his military collar , and he turned his back upon them , so as to avoid them altogether . Of all the other articles which Mr. Hammerdown had the honour to offer for public competition that day it is not our purpose to make mention , save of one only , a little square piano , which came down from the upper regions of the house ( the state grand piano having been disposed of previously ) ; this the young lady tried with a rapid and skilful hand ( making the officer blush and start again ) , and for it , when its turn came , her agent began to bid . But there was an opposition here . The Hebrew aide - de - camp in the service of the officer at the table bid against the Hebrew gentleman employed by the elephant purchasers , and a brisk battle ensued over this little piano , the combatants being greatly encouraged by Mr. Hammerdown . At last , when the competition had been prolonged for some time , the elephant captain and lady desisted from the race ; and the hammer coming down , the auctioneer said:—“Mr
82323	82374	82317	82317	Lewis	1013	” and Mr. Lewis ’s chief thus became the proprietor of the little square piano . Having effected the purchase , he sate up as if he was greatly relieved , and the unsuccessful competitors catching a glimpse of him at this moment , the lady said to her friend . “
82384	83322	82381	82382	Captain Dobbin	752	” I suppose Becky was discontented with the new piano her husband had hired for her , or perhaps the proprietors of that instrument had fetched it away , declining farther credit , or perhaps she had a particular attachment for the one which she had just tried to purchase , recollecting it in old days , when she used to play upon it , in the little sitting - room of our dear Amelia Sedley . The sale was at the old house in Russell Square , where we passed some evenings together at the beginning of this story . Good old John Sedley was a ruined man . His name had been proclaimed as a defaulter on the Stock Exchange , and his bankruptcy and commercial extermination had followed . Mr. Osborne ’s butler came to buy some of the famous port wine to transfer to the cellars over the way . As for one dozen well - manufactured silver spoons and forks at per oz . , and one dozen dessert ditto ditto , there were three young stock - brokers ( Messrs. Dale , Spiggot , and Dale . of Threadneedle - Street , indeed ) , who , having had dealings with the old man , and kindnesses from him in days when he was kind to everybody with whom he dealt , sent this little spar out of the wreck with their love to good Mrs. Sedley ; and with respect to the piano , as it had been Amelia ’s , and as she might miss it and want one now , and as Captain William Dobbin could no more play upon it than he could dance on the tight - rope , it is probable that he did not purchase the instrument for his own use . In a word , it arrived that evening at a wonderful small cottage in a street leading from the Fulham Road — one of those streets which have the finest romantic names—(this was called St. Adelaide Villas , Anna - Maria Road , West ) . where the houses look like baby - houses ; where the people , looking out of the first - floor windows , must infallibly , as you think , sit with their feet in the parlours ; where the shrubs in the little gardens in front , bloom with a perennial display of little children ’s pinafores , little red socks , caps , & c. ( polyandria polygynia ) ; whence you hear the sound of jingling spinets and women singing ; where little porter pots hang on the railing sunning themselves ; whither of evenings you see City clerks padding wearily : here it was that Mr. Clapp , the clerk of Mr. Sedley , had his domicile , and in this asylum the good old gentleman hid his head with his wife and daughter when the crash came . Jos Sedley had acted as a man of his disposition would , when the announcement of the family misfortune reached him . He did not come to London , but he wrote to his mother to draw upon his agents for whatever money was wanted , so that his kind broken - spirited old parents had no present poverty to fear . This done , Jos went on at the boarding - house at Cheltenham pretty much as before . He drove his curricle ; he drank his claret ; he played his rubber ; he told his Indian stories , and the Irish widow consoled and flattered him as usual . His present of money , needful as it was , made little impression on his parents ; and I have heard Amelia say , that the first day on which she saw her father lift up his head after the failure , was on the receipt of the packet of forks and spoons with the young stock - brokers ’ love , over which he burst out crying like a child , being greatly more affected than even his wife , to whom the present was addressed . Edward Dale , the junior of the house , who purchased the spoons for the firm , was , in fact , very sweet upon Amelia , and offered for her in spite of all . He married Miss Louisa Cutts ( daughter of Higham and Cutts , the eminent cornfactors ) with a handsome fortune in 1820 ; and is now living in splendour , and with a numerous family , at his elegant villa , Muswell Hill . But we must not let the recollections of this good fellow cause us to diverge from the principal history . I hope the reader has much too good an opinion of Captain and Mrs. Crawley to suppose that they ever would have dreamed of paying a visit to so remote a district as Bloomsbury , if they thought the family whom they proposed to honour with a visit were not merely out of fashion , but out of money , and could be serviceable to them in no possible manner . Rebecca was entirely surprised at the sight of the comfortable old house where she had met with no small kindness , ransacked by brokers and bargainers , and its quiet family treasures given up to public desecration and plunder . A month after her flight , she had bethought her of Amelia , and Rawdon , with a horse - laugh , had expressed a perfect willingness to see young George Osborne again . “
83332	83337	83330	83330	Beck	630	” the wag added . “
83378	83437	83373	83374	Mrs. C.—ha	4291	” by which sort of speech it is not to be supposed that Rawdon Crawley had a deliberate desire to cheat Mr. Osborne at play , but only wished to take that fair advantage of him which almost every sporting gentleman in Vanity Fair considers to be his due from his neighbour . The old Aunt was long in “
83442	83515	83516	83516	Gad	700	” A month had elapsed . Rawdon was denied the door by Mr. Bowls ; his servants could not get a lodgment in the house at Park Lane ; his letters were sent back unopened . Miss Crawley never stirred out — she was unwell — and Mrs. Bute remained still and never left her . Crawley and his wife both of them augured evil from the continued presence of Mrs. Bute . “
83535	83539	83524	83524	she	4292	” Rawdon said . “
83546	83550	83541	83544	an artful little woman	4294	” ejaculated Rebecca . “
83564	83604	83560	83560	you	4292	” the Captain cried , still in an amorous rapture with his wife , who rewarded him with a kiss by way of reply , and was indeed not a little gratified by the generous confidence of her husband . “
83614	83620	83621	83621	I	0	” she thought to herself , “
83628	84040	83621	83621	I	0	” but she never let him perceive the opinion she had of him ; listened with indefatigable complacency to his stories of the stable and the mess ; laughed at all his jokes ; felt the greatest interest in Jack Spatterdash , whose cab - horse had come down , and Bob Martingale , who had been taken up in a gambling - house , and Tom Cinqbars , who was going to ride the steeple - chase . When he came home she was alert and happy : when he went out she pressed him to go : when he stayed at home , she played and sang for him , made him good drinks , superintended his dinner , warmed his slippers , and steeped his soul in comfort . The best of women ( I have heard my grandmother say ) are hypocrites . We do n’t know how much they hide from us : how watchful they are when they seem most artless and confidential : how often those frank smiles which they wear so easily , are traps to cajole or elude or disarm — I do n’t mean in your mere coquettes , but your domestic models , and paragons of female virtue . Who has not seen a woman hide the dulness of a stupid husband , or coax the fury of a savage one ? We accept this amiable slavishness , and praise a woman for it : we call this pretty treachery truth . A good housewife is of necessity a humbug ; and Cornelia ’s husband was hoodwinked , as Potiphar was — only in a different way . By these attentions , that veteran rake , Rawdon Crawley , found himself converted into a very happy and submissive married man . His former haunts knew him not . They asked about him once or twice at his clubs , but did not miss him much : in those booths of Vanity Fair people seldom do miss each other . His secluded wife ever smiling and cheerful , his little comfortable lodgings , snug meals , and homely evenings , had all the charms of novelty and secrecy . The marriage was not yet declared to the world , or published in the Morning Post . All his creditors would have come rushing on him in a body , had they known that he was united to a woman without fortune . “
84050	84429	84048	84048	me	0	” Becky said , with rather a bitter laugh ; and she was quite contented to wait until the old aunt should be reconciled , before she claimed her place in society . So she lived at Brompton , and meanwhile saw no one , or only those few of her husband ’s male companions who were admitted into her little dining - room . These were all charmed with her . The little dinners , the laughing and chatting , the music afterwards , delighted all who participated in these enjoyments . Major Martingale never thought about asking to see the marriage licence . Captain Cinqbars was perfectly enchanted with her skill in making punch . And young Lieutenant Spatterdash ( who was fond of piquet , and whom Crawley would often invite ) was evidently and quickly smitten by Mrs. Crawley ; but her own circumspection and modesty never forsook her for a moment , and Crawley ’s reputation as a fire - eating and jealous warrior was a further and complete defence to his little wife . There are gentlemen of very good blood and fashion in this city , who never have entered a lady ’s drawing - room ; so that though Rawdon Crawley ’s marriage might be talked about in his county , where , of course , Mrs. Bute had spread the news , in London it was doubted , or not heeded , or not talked about at all . He lived comfortably on credit . He had a large capital of debts , which laid out judiciously , will carry a man along for many years , and on which certain men about town contrive to live a hundred times better than even men with ready money can do . Indeed who is there that walks London streets , but can point out a half - dozen of men riding by him splendidly , while he is on foot , courted by fashion , bowed into their carriages by tradesmen , denying themselves nothing , and living on who knows what ? We see Jack Thriftless prancing in the park , or darting in his brougham down Pall Mall : we eat his dinners served on his miraculous plate . “

84446	84447	84448	84450	My dear fellow	4297	” “
84452	84459	84448	84450	My dear fellow	4297	” I heard Jack once say , “
84469	84575	84460	84460	I	0	” The end must come some day , but in the meantime Jack thrives as much as ever ; people are glad enough to shake him by the hand , ignore the little dark stories that are whispered every now and then against him , and pronounce him a good - natured , jovial , reckless fellow . Truth obliges us to confess that Rebecca had married a gentleman of this order . Everything was plentiful in his house but ready money , of which their ménage pretty early felt the want ; and reading the Gazette one day , and coming upon the announcement of “
84591	84662	84585	84586	vice Smith	4300	” Rawdon uttered that sentiment regarding Amelia ’s lover , which ended in the visit to Russell Square . When Rawdon and his wife wished to communicate with Captain Dobbin at the sale , and to know particulars of the catastrophe which had befallen Rebecca ’s old acquaintances , the Captain had vanished ; and such information as they got was from a stray porter or broker at the auction . “
84671	84690	84585	84586	vice Smith	4300	” Becky said , getting into the buggy , her picture under her arm , in great glee . “
84699	84700	84585	84586	vice Smith	4300	” “
84730	84731	84732	84732	He	4303	” “
84743	84747	84740	84741	Mr. Sedley	674	” Rebecca said ; “

84773	84786	84752	84752	he	4303	” Rawdon replied , cutting a fly off the horse ’s ear . “
84800	84806	84798	84798	Rawdon	870	” the wife continued sentimentally . “
84846	84847	84861	84861	I	0	” “
84884	84885	84882	84882	Becky	630	” “
84893	85020	84888	84888	she	4311	” Becky said with a smile — and they drove on and talked about something else . OUR surprised story now finds itself for a moment among very famous events and personages , and hanging on to the skirts of history . When the eagles of Napoleon Bonaparte , the Corsican upstart , were flying from Provence , where they had perched after a brief sojourn in Elba , and from steeple to steeple until they reached the towers of Notre Dame , I wonder whether the Imperial birds had any eye for a little corner of the parish of Bloomsbury , London , which you might have thought so quiet , that even the whirring and flapping of those mighty wings would pass unobserved there ? “
85027	85490	85021	85021	Napoleon	1029	” Such news might create a panic at Vienna , and cause Russia to drop his cards , and take Prussia into a corner , and Talleyrand and Metternich to wag their heads together , while Prince Hardenberg , and even the present Marquis of Londonderry , were puzzled ; but how was this intelligence to affect a young lady in Russell Square , before whose door the watchman sang the hours when she was asleep : who , if she strolled in the square , was guarded there by the railings and the beadle : who , if she walked ever so short a distance to buy a ribbon in Southampton Row , was followed by Black Sambo with an enormous cane : who was always cared for , dressed , put to bed , and watched over by ever so many guardian angels , with and without wages ? Bon Dieu , I say , is it not hard that the fateful rush of the great Imperial struggle ca n’t take place without affecting a poor little harmless girl of eighteen , who is occupied in billing and cooing , or working muslin collars in Russell Square ? You , too , kindly , homely flower!—is the great roaring war tempest coming to sweep you down , here , although cowering under the shelter of Holborn ? Yes ; Napoleon is flinging his last stake , and poor little Emmy Sedley ’s happiness forms , somehow , part of it . In the first place , her father ’s fortune was swept down with that fatal news . All his speculations had of late gone wrong with the luckless old gentleman . Ventures had failed ; merchants had broken ; funds had risen when he calculated they would fall . What need to particularize ? If success is rare and slow , everybody knows how quick and easy ruin is . Old Sedley had kept his own sad counsel . Everything seemed to go on as usual in the quiet , opulent house ; the good - natured mistress pursuing , quite unsuspiciously , her bustling idleness , and daily easy avocations ; the daughter absorbed still in one selfish , tender thought , and quite regardless of all the world besides , when that final crash came , under which the worthy family fell . One night Mrs. Sedley was writing cards for a party ; the Osbornes had given one , and she must not be behindhand ; John Sedley , who had come home very late from the City , sate silent at the chimney side , while his wife was prattling to him ; Emmy had gone up to her room ailing and low - spirited . “
85496	85502	85503	85504	George Osborne	709	” the mother went on . “
85653	85686	85647	85647	John	635	” John Sedley sprang up out of his chair to meet his wife , who ran to him . He seized her in his arms , and said with a hasty voice , “
85718	85943	85944	85945	My God	4325	” As he spoke , he trembled in every limb , and almost fell . He thought the news would have overpowered his wife — his wife , to whom he had never said a hard word . But it was he that was the most moved , sudden as the shock was to her . When he sank back into his seat , it was the wife that took the office of consoler . She took his trembling hand , and kissed it , and put it round her neck : she called him her John — her dear John — her old man — her kind old man ; she poured out a hundred words of incoherent love and tenderness ; her faithful voice and simple caresses wrought this sad heart up to an inexpressible delight and anguish , and cheered and solaced his over - burdened soul . Only once in the course of the long night as they sate together , and poor Sedley opened his pent - up soul , and told the story of his losses and embarrassments — the treason of some of his oldest friends , the manly kindness of some , from whom he never could have expected it — in a general confession — only once did the faithful wife give way to emotion . “
85957	87003	85944	85945	My God	4325	” she said . The father had forgotten the poor girl . She was lying , awake and unhappy , overhead . In the midst of friends , home , and kind parents , she was alone . To how many people can any one tell all ? Who will be open where there is no sympathy , or has call to speak to those who never can understand ? Our gentle Amelia was thus solitary . She had no confidante , so to speak , ever since she had anything to confide . She could not tell the old mother her doubts and cares ; the would - be sisters seemed every day more strange to her . And she had misgivings and fears which she dared not acknowledge to herself , though she was always secretly brooding over them . Her heart tried to persist in asserting that George Osborne was worthy and faithful to her , though she knew otherwise . How many a thing had she said , and got no echo from him . How many suspicions of selfishness and indifference had she to encounter and obstinately overcome . To whom could the poor little martyr tell these daily struggles and tortures ? Her hero himself only half understood her . She did not dare to own that the man she loved was her inferior ; or to feel that she had given her heart away too soon . Given once , the pure bashful maiden was too modest , too tender , too trustful , too weak , too much woman to recall it . We are Turks with the affections of our women ; and have made them subscribe to our doctrine too . We let their bodies go abroad liberally enough , with smiles and ringlets and pink bonnets to disguise them instead of veils and yakmaks . But their souls must be seen by only one man , and they obey not unwillingly , and consent to remain at home as our slaves — ministering to us and doing drudgery for us . So imprisoned and tortured was this gentle little heart , when in the month of March , Anno Domini 1815 , Napoleon landed at Cannes , and Louis XVIII . fled , and all Europe was in alarm , and the funds fell , and old John Sedley was ruined . We are not going to follow the worthy old stock - broker through those last pangs and agonies of ruin through which he passed before his commercial demise befell . They declared him at the Stock Exchange ; he was absent from his house of business : his bills were protested : his act of bankruptcy formal . The house and furniture of Russell Square were seized and sold up , and he and his family were thrust away , as we have seen , to hide their heads where they might . John Sedley had not the heart to review the domestic establishment who have appeared now and anon in our pages , and of whom he was now forced by poverty to take leave . The wages of those worthy people were discharged with that punctuality which men frequently show who only owe in great sums — they were sorry to leave good places — but they did not break their hearts at parting from their adored master and mistress . Amelia ’s maid was profuse in condolences , but went off quite resigned to better herself in a genteeler quarter of the town . Black Sambo , with the infatuation of his profession , determined on setting up a public - house . Honest old Mrs. Blenkinsop indeed , who had seen the birth of Jos and Amelia , and the wooing of John Sedley and his wife , was for staying by them without wages , having amassed a considerable sum in their service : and she accompanied the fallen people into their new and humble place of refuge , where she tended them and grumbled against them for a while . Of all Sedley ’s opponents in his debates with his creditors which now ensued , and harassed the feelings of the humiliated old gentleman so severely , that in six weeks he oldened more than he had done for fifteen years before — the most determined and obstinate seemed to be John Osborne , his old friend and neighbour — John Osborne , whom he had set up in life — who was under a hundred obligations to him — and whose son was to marry Sedley ’s daughter . Any one of these circumstances would account for the bitterness of Osborne ’s opposition . When one man has been under very remarkable obligations to another , with whom he subsequently quarrels , a common sense of decency , as it were , makes of the former a much severer enemy than a mere stranger would be . To account for your own hard - heartedness and ingratitude in such a case , you are bound to prove the other party ’s crime . It is not that you are selfish , brutal , and angry at the failure of a speculation — no , no — it is that your partner has led you into it by the basest treachery and with the most sinister motives . From a mere sense of consistency , a persecutor is bound to show that the fallen man is a villain — otherwise he , the persecutor , is a wretch himself . And as a general rule , which may make all creditors who are inclined to be severe pretty comfortable in their minds , no men embarrassed are altogether honest , very likely . They conceal something ; they exaggerate chances of good luck ; hide away the real state of affairs ; say that things are flourishing when they are hopeless ; keep a smiling face ( a dreary smile it is ) upon the verge of bankruptcy — are ready to lay hold of any pretext for delay or of any money , so as to stave off the inevitable ruin a few days longer . “
87009	87022	85944	85945	My God	4325	” says the creditor in triumph , and reviles his sinking enemy . “
87034	87046	87047	87048	You villain	4329	” calm good sense says to the man that is drowning . “
87061	88331	87047	87048	You villain	4329	” says prosperity to the poor devil battling in that black gulf . Who has not remarked the readiness with which the closest of friends and honestest of men suspect and accuse each other of cheating when they fall not on money matters ? Everybody does it . Everybody is right , I suppose , and the world is a rogue . Then Osborne had the intolerable sense of former benefits to goad and irritate him : these are always a cause of hostility aggravated . Finally , he had to break off the match between Sedley ’s daughter and his son ; and as it had gone very far indeed , and as the poor girl ’s happiness and perhaps character were compromised , it was necessary to show the strongest reasons for the rupture , and for John Osborne to prove John Sedley to be a very bad character indeed . At the meetings of creditors , then , he comported himself with a savageness and scorn towards Sedley , which almost succeeded in breaking the heart of that ruined bankrupt man . On George ’s intercourse with Amelia he put an instant veto — menacing the youth with maledictions if he broke his commands , and vilipending the poor innocent girl as the basest and most artful of vixens . One of the great conditions of anger and hatred is , that you must tell and believe lies against the hated object , in order , as we said , to be consistent . When the great crash came — the announcement of ruin , and the departure from Russell Square , and the declaration that all was over between her and George — all over between her and love , her and happiness , her and faith in the world — a brutal letter from John Osborne told her in a few curt lines that her father ’s conduct had been of such a nature that all engagements between the families were at an end — when the final award came , it did not shock her so much as her parents , as her mother rather expected ( for John Sedley himself was entirely prostrate in the ruins of his own affairs and shattered honour ) . Amelia took the news very palely and calmly . It was only the confirmation of the dark presages which had long gone before . It was the mere reading of the sentence — of the crime she had long ago been guilty — the crime of loving wrongly , too violently , against reason . She told no more of her thoughts now than she had before . She seemed scarcely more unhappy now when convinced all hope was over , than before when she felt but dared not confess that it was gone . So she changed from the large house to the small one without any mark or difference ; remained in her little room for the most part ; pined silently ; and died away day by day . I do not mean to say that all females are so . My dear Miss Bullock , I do not think your heart would break in this way . You are a strong - minded young woman with proper principles . I do not venture to say that mine would ; it has suffered , and , it must be confessed , survived . But there are some souls thus gently constituted , thus frail , and delicate , and tender . Whenever old John Sedley thought of the affair between George and Amelia , or alluded to it , it was with bitterness almost as great as Mr. Osborne himself had shown . He cursed Osborne and his family as heartless , wicked , and ungrateful . No power on earth , he swore , would induce him to marry his daughter to the son of such a villain , and he ordered Emmy to banish George from her mind , and to return all the presents and letters which she had ever had from him . She promised acquiescence , and tried to obey . She put up the two or three trinkets : and , as for the letters , she drew them out of the place where she kept them ; and read them over — as if she did not know them by heart already ; but she could not part with them . That effort was too much for her ; she placed them back in her bosom again — as you have seen a woman nurse a child that is dead . Young Amelia felt that she would die or lose her senses outright , if torn away from this last consolation . How she used to blush and lighten up when those letters came ! How she used to trip away with a beating heart , so that she might read unseen ! If they were cold , yet how perversely this fond little soul interpreted them into warmth . If they were short or selfish , what excuses she found for the writer ! It was over these few worthless papers that she brooded and brooded . She lived in her past life — every letter seemed to recall some circumstance of it . How well she remembered them all ! His looks and tones , his dress , what he said and how — these relics and remembrances of dead affection were all that were left her in the world . And the business of her life , was — to watch the corpse of Love . To death she looked with inexpressible longing . Then , she thought , I shall always be able to follow him . I am not praising her conduct or setting her up as a model for Miss Bullock to imitate . Miss B. knows how to regulate her feelings better than this poor little creature . Miss B. would never have committed herself as that imprudent Amelia had done ; pledged her love irretrievably ; confessed her heart away , and got back nothing — only a brittle promise which was snapt and worthless in a moment . A long engagement is a partnership which one party is free to keep or to break , but which involves all the capital of the other . Be cautions then , young ladies ; be wary how you engage . Be shy of loving frankly ; never tell all you feel , or ( a better way still ) , feel very little See the consequences of being prematurely honest and confiding , and mistrust yourselves and everybody . Get yourselves married as they do in France , where the lawyers are the bridesmaids and confidantes . At any rate , never have any feelings which may make you uncomfortable , or make any promises which you can not at any required moment command and withdraw . That is the way to get on , and be respected , and have a virtuous character in Vanity Fair . If Amelia could have heard the comments regarding her which were made in the circle from which her father ’s ruin had just driven her , she would have seen what her own crimes were , and how entirely her character was jeopardised . Such criminal imprudence Mrs. Smith never knew of ; such horrid familiarities Mrs. Brown had always condemned , and the end might be a warning to her daughters . “
88346	88352	88332	88333	Captain Osborne	1045	” the Misses Dobbin said . “
88378	88379	88371	88371	her	1042	” “
88383	88389	88371	88371	her	1042	” Captain Dobbin roared out . “
88435	88436	88439	88439	William	752	” “
88461	88466	88455	88455	We	4337	” Miss Jane said . “

88526	88532	88524	88524	William	752	” Miss Ann asked sarcastically . “

88552	88564	88550	88550	her	632	” Dobbin said , blushing very much , and talking quick . “
88635	88636	88637	88637	I	0	” “
88651	88656	88649	88649	William	752	” Miss Ann remarked . “
88676	88684	88673	88673	you	752	” cried out this uproused British lion . “
88749	88767	88739	88739	I	0	” Will Dobbin said , perceiving Miss Ann ’s pink eyes were beginning to moisten as usual . “
88792	88886	88788	88789	Miss Sedley	632	” Anything like William ’s infatuation about that silly little flirting , ogling thing was never known , the mamma and sisters agreed together in thinkin and they trembled lest , her engagement being off with Osborne , she should take up immediately her other admirer and Captain . In which forebodings these worthy young women no doubt judged according to the best of their experience ; or rather ( for as yet they had had no opportunities of marying or of jilting ) according to their own notions of right and wrong . “
88901	88906	88892	88892	Mamma	4352	” the girls said . “
88919	89702	89703	89703	She	4356	” Such , indeed , was the fact ; and so it is that the French Emperor comes in to perform a part in this domestic comedy of Vanity Fair which we are now playing , and which would never have been enacted without the intervention of this august mute personage . It was he that ruined the Bourbons and Mr. John Sedley . It was he whose arrival in his capital called up all France in arms to defend him there ; and all Europe to oust him . While the French nation and army were swearing fidelity round the eagles in the Champ de Mars , four mighty European hosts were getting in motion for the great chasse - à - l’aigle ; and one of these was a British army , of which two heroes of ours , Captain Dobbin and Captain Osborne , formed a portion . The news of Napoleon ’s escape and landing was received by the gallant — th with a fiery delight and enthusiasm , which everybody can understand who knows that famous corps . From the colonel to the smallest drummer in the regiment , all were filled with hope and ambition and patriotic fury ; and thanked the French Emperor as for a personal kindness in coming to disturb the peace of Europe . Now was the time the — th had so long panted for , to show their comrades in arms that they could fight as well as the Peninsular veterans , and that all the pluck and valour of the — th had not been killed by the West Indies and the yellow fever . Stubble and Spooney looked to get their companies without purchase . Before the end of the campaign ( which she resolved to share ) , Mrs. Major O’Dowd hoped to write herself Mrs. Colonel O’Dowd , C.B. Our two friends ( Dobbin and Osborne ) were quite as much excited as the rest : and each in his way — Mr. Dobbin very quietly , Mr. Osborne very loudly and energetically — was bent upon doing his duty , and gaining his share of honour and distinction . The agitation thrilling through the country and army in consequence of this news was so great , that private matters were little heeded : and hence probably George Osborne , just gazetted to his company , busy with preparations for the march , which must come inevitably , and panting for further promotion — was not so much affected by other incidents which would have interested him at a more quiet period . He was not , it must be confessed , very much cast down by good old Mr. Sedley ’s catastrophe . He tried his new uniform , which became him very handsomely , on the day when the first meeting of the creditors of the unfortunate gentleman took place . His father told him of the wicked , rascally , shameful conduct of the bankrupt , reminded him of what he had said about Amelia , and that their connection was broken off for ever ; and gave him that evening a good sum of money to pay for the new clothes and epaulets in which he looked so well . Money was always useful to this free - handed young fellow , and he took it without many words . The bills were up in the Sedley house , where he had passed so many , many happy hours . He could see them as he walked from home that night ( to the Old Slaughters ’ , where he put up when in town ) shining white in the moon . That comfortable home was shut , then , upon Amelia and her parents : where had they taken refuge ? The thought of their ruin affected him not a little . He was very melancholy that night in the coffee - room at the Slaughters ’ ; and drank a good deal , as his comrades remarked there . Dobbin came in presently , cautioned him about the drink , which he only took , be said , because he was deuced low ; but when his friend began to put to him clumsy inquiries , and asked him for news in a significant manner , Osborne declined entering into conversation with him ; avowing , however , that he was devilish disturbed and unhappy . Three days afterwards , Dobbin found Osborne in his room at the barracks:—his head on the table , a number of papers about , the young Captain evidently in a state of great despondency . “
89723	89779	89705	89705	she	4356	” There was a little packet directed in the well - known hand to Captain George Osborne , and some things lying about — a ring , a silver knife he had bought , as a boy , for her at a fair ; a gold chain , and a locket with hair in it . “
89785	89796	89705	89705	she	4356	” said he , with a groan of sickening remorse . “
89809	89829	89799	89799	Will	701	” There was a little letter of a few lines , to which he pointed , which said : — “
89953	89973	89936	89936	God	655	“ I shall often play upon the piano — your piano . It was like you to send it . ”
89974	90098	89936	89936	God	655	“ My papa has ordered me to return to you these presents , which you made in happier days to me ; and I am to write to you for the last time . I think , I know you feel as much as I do the blow which has come upon us . It is I that absolve you from an engagement which is impossible in our present misery . I am sure you had no share in it , or in the cruel suspicions of Mr. Osborne , which are the hardest of all our griefs to bear . Farewell . Farewell . I pray God to strengthen me to bear this and other calamities , and to bless you always . “
90118	90321	90113	90113	you	4359	” Dobbin was very soft - hearted . The sight of women and children in pain always used to melt him . The idea of Amelia broken - hearted and lonely , tore that good - natured soul with anguish . And he broke out into an emotion , which anybody who likes may consider unmanly . He swore that Amelia was an angel , to which Osborne said aye with all his heart . He , too , had been reviewing the history of their lives — and had seen her from her childhood to her present age , so sweet , so innocent , so charmingly simple , and artlessly fond and tender . What a pang it was to lose all that : to have had it and not prized it ! A thousand homely scenes and recollections crowded on him — in which he always saw her good and beautiful . And for himself , he blushed with remorse and shame , as the remembrance of his own selfishness and in difference contrasted with that perfect purity . For a while glory , war , everything was forgotten , and the pair of friends talked about her only . “
90326	90359	90113	90113	you	4359	” Osborne asked , after a long talk , and a long pause,—and , in truth , with no little shame at thinking that he had taken no steps to follow her . “
90372	90638	90113	90113	you	4359	” Dobbin knew . He had not merely sent the piano ; but had written a note to Mrs. Sedley , and asked permission to come and see her,—and he had seen her , and Amelia too . yesterday , before he came down to Chatham ; and , what is more , he had brought that farewell letter and packet which had so moved them . The good - natured fellow had found Mrs. Sedley only too willing to receive him , and greatly agitated by the arrival of the piano , which , as she conjectured , must have come from George , and was a signal of amity on his part . Captain Dobbin did not correct this error of the worthy lady , but listened to all her story of complaints and misfortunes with great sympathy — condoled with her losses and privations , and agreed in reprehending the cruel conduct of Mr. Osborne towards his first benefactor . When she had eased her overflowing bosom somewhat , and poured forth many of her sorrows , he had the courage to ask actually to see Amelia , who was above in her room as usual , and whom her mother led trembling downstairs . Her appearance was so ghastly , and her look of despair so pathetic , that honest William Dobbin was frightened as he beheld it ; and read the most fatal forebodings in that pale fixed face . After sitting in his company a minute or two , she put the packet into his hand , and said , “
90700	90826	90827	90827	George	1045	” And with this , and a curtsey and a smile , the poor child went her way . The mother , as she led her up , cast back looks of anguish towards Dobbin . The good fellow wanted no such appeal . He loved her himself too fondly for that . Inexpressible grief , and pity , and terror pursued him , and he came away as if he was a criminal after seeing her . When Osborne heard that his friend had found her , he made hot and anxious inquiries regarding the poor child . How was she ? How did she look ? What did she say ? His comrade took his hand , and looked him in the face . “
90833	90978	90827	90827	George	1045	” William Dobbin said,—and could speak no more . There was a buxom Irish servant - girl , who performed all the duties of the little house where the Sedley family had found refuge : and this girl had in vain , on many previous days , striven to give Amelia aid or consolation . Emmy was much too sad to answer , or even to be aware of the attempts the other was making in her favour . Four hours after the talk between Dobbin and Osborne , this servant maid came into Amelia ’s room , where she sat as usual , brooding silently over her letters — her little treasures . The girl , smiling , and looking arch and happy , made many trials to attract poor Emmy ’s attention , who , however , took no heed of her . “
90982	90987	90979	90980	Miss Emmy	677	” said the girl . “
90992	91000	90988	90988	I	0	” Emmy said , not looking round . “
91006	91012	90988	90988	I	0	” the maid went on . “
91038	91053	91017	91017	somebody	2339	” And she gave her a letter , which Emmy took , and read . “
91059	91064	91017	91017	somebody	2339	” the letter said . “
91078	91253	91071	91072	dearest wife	4366	” George and her mother were outside , waiting until she had read the letter . WE have seen how Mrs. Firkin , the lady ’s maid , as soon as any event of importance to the Crawley family came to her knowledge , felt bound to communicate it to Mrs. Bute Crawley , at the Rectory ; and have before mentioned how particularly kind and attentive that good - natured lady was to Miss Crawley ’s confidential servant . She had been a gracious friend to Miss Briggs , the companion , also ; and had secured the latter ’s good - will by a number of those attentions and promises , which cost so little in the making , and are yet so valuable and agreeable to the recipient . Indeed every good economist and manager of a household must know how cheap and yet how amiable these professions are , and what a flavour they give to the most homely dish in life . Who was the blundering idiot who said that “
91259	92010	92011	92012	My girls	4367	” ? Half the parsnips of society are served and rendered palatable with no other sauce . As the immortal Alexis Soyer can make more delicious soup for a halfpenny than an ignorant cook can concoct with pounds of vegetables and meat , so a skilful artist will make a few simple and pleasing phrases go farther than ever so much substantial benefit - stock in the hands of a mere bungler . Nay , we know that substantial benefits often sicken some stomachs ; whereas , most will digest any amount of fine words , and be always eager for more of the same food . Mrs. Bute had told Briggs and Firkin so often of the depth of her affection for them ; and what she would do , if she had Miss Crawley ’s fortune , for friends so excellent and attached , that the ladies in question had the deepest regard for her ; and felt as much gratitude and confidence as if Mrs. Bute had loaded them with the most expensive favours . Rawdon Crawley , on the other hand , like a selfish heavy dragoon as he was , never took the least trouble to conciliate his aunt ’s aides - de - camp , showed his contempt for the pair with entire frankness — made Firkin pull off his boots on one occasion — sent her out in the rain on ignominious messages — and if he gave her a guinea , flung it to her as if it were a box on the ear . As his Aunt , too , made a butt of Briggs , the Captain followed the example , and levelled his jokes at her — jokes about as delicate as a kick from his charger . Whereas , Mrs. Bute consulted her in matters of taste or difficulty , admired her poetry , and by a thousand acts of kindness and politeness , showed her appreciation of Briggs ; and if she made Firkin a twopenny - halfpenny present , accompanied it with so many compliments , that the twopence - halfpenny was transmuted into gold in the heart of the grateful waiting - maid , who , besides , was looking forwards quite contentedly to some prodigious benefit which must happen to her on the day when Mrs. Bute came into her fortune . The different conduct of these two people is pointed out respectfully to the attention of persons commencing the world . Praise everybody , I say to such : never be squeamish , but speak out your compliment both point blank in a man ’s face , and behind his back , when you know there is a reasonable chance of his hearing it again . Never lose a chance of saying a kind word . As Collingwood never saw a vacant place in his estate but he took an acorn out of his pocket and popped it in ; so deal with your compliments through life . An acorn costs nothing ; but it may sprout into a prodigious bit of timber . In a word , during Rawdon Crawley ’s prosperity , he was only obeyed with sulky acquiescence ; when his disgrace came , there was nobody to help or pity him . Whereas , when Mrs. Bute took the command at Miss Crawley ’s house , the garrison there were charmed to act under such a leader , expecting all sorts of promotion from her promises , her generosity , and her kind words . That he would consider himself beaten , after one defeat , and make no attempt to regain the position he had lost , Mrs. Bute Crawley never allowed herself to suppose . She knew Rebecca to be too clever and spirited , and desperate a woman to submit without a struggle ; and felt that she must prepare for that combat , and be incessantly watchful against assault , or mine , or surprise . In the first place , though she held the town , was she sure of the principal inhabitant ? Would Miss Crawley herself hold out ; and had she not a secret longing to welcome back the ousted adversary ? The old lady liked Rawdon , and Rebecca , who amused her . Mrs. Bute could not disguise from herself the fact that none of her party could so contribute to the pleasures of the town - bred lady . “
92028	92038	92039	92039	She	4369	” the candid Rector ’s wife owned to herself . “
92165	92861	92900	92900	He	4375	” In the very best of moments , if anybody told Miss Crawley that she was , or looked ill , the trembling old lady sent off for her doctor ; and I daresay she was very unwell after the sudden family event , which might serve to shake stronger nerves than hers . At least , Mrs. Bute thought it was her duty to inform the physician , and the apothecary , and the dame - de - compagnie , and the domestics , that Miss Crawley was in a most critical state , and that they were to act accordingly . She had the street laid knee - deep with straw ; and the knocker put by with Mr. Bowls ’s plate . She insisted that the Doctor should call twice a day ; and deluged her patient with draughts every two hours . When anybody entered the room , she uttered a shshshsh so sibilant and ominous , that it frightened the poor old lady in her bed , from which she could not look without seeing Mrs. Bute ’s beady eyes eagerly fixed on her , as the latter sate steadfast in the arm - chair by the bedside . They seemed to lighten in the dark ( for she kept the curtains closed ) as she moved about the room on velvet paws like a cat . There Miss Crawley lay for days — ever so many days — Mrs. Bute reading books of devotion to her : for nights , long nights , during which she had to hear the watchman sing , the night - light sputter ; visited at midnight , the last thing , by the stealthy apothecary ; and then left to look at Mrs. Bute ’s twinkling eyes , or the flicks of yellow that the rushlight threw on the dreary darkened ceiling . Hygeia herself would have fallen sick under such a regimen ; and how much more this poor old nervous victim ? It has been said that when she was in health and good spirits this venerable inhabitant of Vanity Fair had as free notions about religion and morals as Monsieur de Voltaire himself could desire , but when illness overtook her , it was aggravated by the most dreadful terrors of death , and an utter cowardice took possession of the prostrate old sinner . Sick - bed homilies and pious reflections are , to be sure , out of place in mere story - books , and we are not going ( after the fashion of some novelists of the present day ) to cajole the public into a sermon , when it is only a comedy that the reader pays his money to witness . But , without preaching , the truth may surely be borne in mind , that the bustle , and triumph , and laughter , and gaiety which Vanity - Fair exhibits in public , do not always pursue the performer into private life , and that the most dreary depression of spirits and dismal repentances sometimes overcome him . Recollections of the best ordained banquets will scarcely cheer sick epicures . Reminiscences of the most becoming dresses and brilliant ball - triumphs will go very little way to console faded beauties . Perhaps statesmen , at a particular period of existence , are not much gratified at thinking over the most triumphant divisions ; and the success or the pleasure of yesterday becomes of very small account when a certain ( albeit uncertain ) morrow is in view , about which all of us must some day or other be speculating . O brother wearers of motley ! Are there not moments when one grows sick of grinning and tumbling , and the jingling of cap and bells ? This , dear friends and companions , is my amiable object — to walk with you through the Fair , to examine the shops and the shows there ; and that we should all come home after the flare , and the noise , and the gaiety , and be perfectly miserable in private . “
92875	92883	92913	92913	he	4375	” Mrs. Bute Crawley thought to herself , “
92971	94446	94447	94447	I	0	” And , as the hatred of vice is always a progress towards virtue , Mrs. Bute Crawley endeavoured to instil into her sister - in - law a proper abhorrence for all Rawdon Crawley ’s manifold sins : of which his uncle ’s wife brought forward such a catalogue as indeed would have served to condemn a whole regiment of young officers . If a man has committed wrong in life , I do n’t know any moralist more anxious to point his errors out to the world than his own relations ; so Mrs. Bute showed a perfect family interest and knowledge of Rawdon ’s history . She had all the particulars of that ugly quarrel with Captain Marker , in which Rawdon , wrong from the beginning , ended in shooting the Captain . She knew how the unhappy Lord Dovedale , whose mamma had taken a house at Oxford , so that he might be educated there , and who had never touched a card in his life till he came to London , was perverted by Rawdon at the Cocoa - Tree , made helplessly tipsy by this abominable seducer and perverter of youth , and fleeced of four thousand pounds . She described with the most vivid minuteness the agonies of the country families whom he had ruined — the sons whom he had plunged into dishonour and poverty — the daughters whom he had inveigled into perdition . She knew the poor tradesmen who were bankrupt by his extravagance — the mean shifts and rogueries with which he had ministered to it — the astounding falsehoods by which he had imposed upon the most generous of aunts , and the ingratitude by which he had repaid her sacrifices . She imparted these stories gradually to Miss Crawley ; gave her the whole benefit of them ; felt it to be her bounden duty as a Christian woman and mother of a family to do so ; had not the smallest remorse or compunction for the victim whom her tongue was immolating ; nay , very likely thought her act was quite meritorious , and plumed herself upon her resolute manner of performing it . Yes , if a man ’s character is to be abused , say what you will , there ’s nobody like a relation to do the business . And one is bound to own , regarding this unfortunate wretch of a Rawdon Crawley , that the mere truth was enough to condemn him , and that all inventions of scandal were quite superfluous pains on his friends ’ parts . Rebecca , too , being now a relative , came in for the fullest share of Mrs. Bute ’s kind inquiries . This indefatigable pursuer of truth ( having given strict orders that the door was to be denied to all emissaries or letters from Rawdon ) , took Miss Crawley ’s carriage , and drove to her old friend Miss Pinkerton , at Minerva House , Chiswick Mall , to whom she announced the dreadful intelligence of Captain Rawdon ’s seduction by Miss Sharp , and from whom she got sundry strange particulars regarding the ex - governess ’s birth and early history . The friend of the Lexicographer had plenty of information to give . Miss Jemima was made to fetch the drawing - master ’s receipts and letters . This one was from a spunging - house : that entreated an advance : another was full of gratitude for Rebecca ’s reception by the ladies of Chiswick : and the last document from the unlucky artist ’s pen was that in which , from his dying bed , he recommended his orphan child to Miss Pinkerton ’s protection . There were juvenile letters and petitions from Rebecca , too , in the collection , imploring aid for her father or declaring her own gratitude . Perhaps in Vanity Fair there are no better satires than letters . Take a bundle of your dear friend ’s of ten years back — your dear friend whom you hate now . Look at a file of your sister ’s ! how you clung to each other till you quarrelled about the twenty - pound legacy ! Get down the round - hand scrawls of your son who has half broken your heart with selfish undutifulness since ; or a parcel of your own , breathing endless ardour and love eternal , which were sent back by your mistress when she married the Nabob — your mistress for whom you now care no more than for Queen Elizabeth . Vows , love , promises , confidences , gratitude ; how queerly they read after a while ! There ought to be a law in Vanity Fair ordering the destruction of every written document ( except receipted tradesmen ’s bills ) after a certain brief and proper interval . Those quacks and misanthropes who advertise indelible Japan ink should be made to perish along with their wicked discoveries . The best ink for Vanity Fair use would be one that faded utterly in a couple of days , and left the paper clean and blank , so that you might write on it to somebody else . From Miss Pinkerton ’s the indefatigable Mrs. Bute followed the track of Sharp and his daughter back to the lodgings in Greek Street , which the defunct painter had occupied ; and where portraits of the landlady in white satin , and of the husband in brass buttons , done by Sharp in lieu of a quarter ’s rent , still decorated the parlour walls . Mrs. Stokes was a communicative person , and quickly told all she knew about Mr. Sharp ; how dissolute and poor he was ; how good - natured and amusin how he was always hunted by bailiffs and duns : how , to the landlady ’s horror , though she never could abide the woman , he did not marry his wife till a short time before her death : and what a queer little wild vixen his daughter was ; how she kept them all laughing with her fun and mimicry ; how she used to fetch the gin from the public - house , and was known in all the studios in the quarter — in brief , Mrs. Bute got such a full account of her new niece ’s parentage , education , and behaviour as would scarcely have pleased Rebecca , had the latter known that such inquiries were being made concerning her . Of all these industrious researches Miss Crawley had the full benefit . Mrs. Rawdon Crawley was the daughter of an opera - girl . She had danced herself . She had been a model to the painters . She was brought up as became her mother ’s daughter . She drank gin with her father , & c. , & c. It was a lost woman who was married to a lost man ; and the moral to be inferred from Mrs. Bute ’s tale was , that the knavery of the pair was irremediable , and that no properly - conducted person should ever notice them again . These were the materials which prudent Mrs. Bute gathered together in Park Lane , the provisions and ammunition as it were with which she fortified the house against the siege which she knew that Rawdon and his wife would lay to Miss Crawley . But if a fault may be found with her arrangements , it is this , that she was too eager : she managed rather too well ; undoubtedly she made Miss Crawley more ill than was necessary ; and though the old invalid succumbed to her authority , it was so harassing and severe , that the victim would be inclined to escape at the very first chance which fell in her way . Managing women , the ornaments of their sex,—women who order everything for everybody , and know so much better than any person concerned what is good for their neighbours , do n’t sometimes speculate upon the possibility of a domestic revolt , or upon other extreme consequences resulting from their overstrained authority . Thus , for instance , Mrs. Bute , with the best intentions no doubt in the world , and wearing herself to death as she did by foregoing sleep , dinner , fresh air , for the sake of her invalid sister - in - law , carried her conviction of the old lady ’s illness so far that she almost managed her into her coffin . She pointed out her sacrifices and their results one day to the constant apothecary , Mr. Clump . “
94456	94460	94453	94454	Mr. Clump	972	” she said , “
94502	94503	94504	94504	Your	0	” “
94515	94525	94504	94504	Your	0	” Mr. Clump says , with a low bow ; “
94528	94529	94530	94530	I	0	” “
94578	94579	94580	94580	You	0	” “

94624	94636	94615	94615	I	0	” Mrs. Bute said , with a happy solemnity of conviction ; “
94735	94736	94718	94718	I	0	” “
94746	94756	94738	94738	I	0	Madam,”—here the resolute Clump once more interposed with a bland air—“what
94799	94800	94801	94801	I	0	” “
94821	94826	94829	94829	Madam	15335	” Mrs. Bute interposed . “
94848	94853	94840	94842	Mrs. Bute Crawley	820	” Clump said gallantly . “
94891	94892	94893	94893	Her	839	” “
94900	94905	94893	94893	Her	839	” Mrs. Crawley cried . “
94996	95008	95034	95034	They	4411	” Mr. Clump said , grinning and showing his handsome teeth . “
95054	95055	95050	95052	Mrs. Bute Crawley	820	” “
95082	95100	95068	95068	I	0	” Mrs. Bute said ( letting the cat of selfishness out of the bag of secrecy ) , “
95171	95172	95161	95161	I	0	” “
95179	95186	95177	95177	Madam	15335	” Mr. Clump now said bluntly , “
95245	95246	95235	95235	you	15335	” “
95256	95261	95235	95235	you	15335	” Mrs. Bute cried . “
95276	95324	95270	95270	you	972	” The night before , Mr. Clump and Dr. Squills had had a consultation ( over a bottle of wine at the house of Sir Lapin Warren , whose lady was about to present him with a thirteenth blessing ) , regarding Miss Crawley and her case . “
95336	95340	95334	95334	Clump	972	” Squills remarked , “
95353	95354	95349	95351	Devilish good Madeira	1060	” “
95363	95367	95356	95357	a fool	16627	” Clump replied , “
95384	95385	95379	95380	the girl	2155	” “
95399	95403	95408	95408	her	2155	” Squills remarked . “
95418	95419	95413	95414	a fool	16627	” “
95429	95434	95413	95414	a fool	16627	” the apothecary replied . “
95445	95456	95437	95439	the old girl	4427	” said the physician , and after a pause added , “
95466	95467	95457	95457	She	4427	” “
95471	95478	95457	95457	She	4427	” says Clump with a grin : “
95492	95493	95479	95479	I	0	” “
95515	95520	95510	95510	she	4428	” Dr. Squills said . “
95572	95715	95716	95716	We	4431	” And it was acting upon this hint that the worthy apothecary spoke with so much candour to Mrs. Bute Crawley . Having the old lady under her hand : in bed : with nobody near , Mrs. Bute had made more than one assault upon her , to induce her to alter her will . But Miss Crawley ’s usual terrors regarding death increased greatly when such dismal propositions were made to her , and Mrs. Bute saw that she must get her patient into cheerful spirits and health before she could hope to attain the pious object which she had in view . Whither to take her was the next puzzle . The only place where she is not likely to meet those odious Rawdons is at church , and that wo n’t amuse her , Mrs. Bute justly felt . “
95727	95732	95733	95733	I	0	” she then thought . “
95744	96078	95733	95733	I	0	” and so she had a sudden interest for Hampstead , and Hornsey , and found that Dulwich had great charms for her , and getting her victim into her carriage , drove her to those rustic spots , beguiling the little journeys with conversations about Rawdon and his wife , and telling every story to the old lady which could add to her indignation against this pair of reprobates . Perhaps Mrs. Bute pulled the string unnecessarily tight . For though she worked up Miss Crawley to a proper dislike of her disobedient nephew , the invalid had a great hatred and secret terror of her victimizer , and panted to escape from her . After a brief space , she rebelled against Highgate and Hornsey utterly . She would go into the Park . Mrs. Bute knew they would meet the abominable Rawdon there , and she was right . One day in the ring , Rawdon ’s stanhope came in sight ; Rebecca was seated by him . In the enemy ’s equipage Miss Crawley occupied her usual place , with Mrs. Bute on her left , the poodle and Miss Briggs on the back seat . It was a nervous moment , and Rebecca ’s heart beat quick as she recognized the carriage ; and as the two vehicles crossed each other in a line , she clasped her hands , and looked towards the spinster with a face of agonized attachment and devotion . Rawdon himself trembled , and his face grew purple behind his dyed mustachios . Only old Briggs was moved in the other carriage , and cast her great eyes nervously towards her old friends Miss Crawley ’s bonnet was resolutely turned towards the Serpentine . Mrs. Bute happened to be in ecstasies with the poodle , and was calling him a little darling , and a sweet little zoggy , and a pretty pet . The carriages moved on , each in his line . “
96084	96091	96082	96082	Jove	701	” Rawdon said to his wife . “
96098	96102	96096	96096	Rawdon	870	” Rebecca answered . “
96114	96881	96105	96105	you	870	” Rawdon had not the heart for that manœuvre . When the carriages met again , he stood up in his stanhope ; he raised his hand ready to doff his hat ; he looked with all his eyes . But this time Crawley ’s face was not turned away ; she and Mrs. Bute looked him full in the face , and cut their nephew pitilessly . He sank back in his seat with an oath and striking out of the ring , dashed away desperately home , wards . It was a gallant and decided triumph for Mrs. Bute . But she felt the danger of many such meetings , as she saw the evident nervousness of Miss Crawley ; and she determined that it was most necessary for her dear friend ’s health , that they should leave town for a while , and recommended Brighton very strongly . WITHOUT knowing how , Captain William Dobbin found himself the great promoter , arranger , and manager of the match between George Osborne and Amelia . But for him it never would have taken place : he could not but confess as much to himself , and smiled rather bitterly as he thought that he of all men in the world should be the person upon whom the care of this marriage had fallen . But though indeed the conducting of this negotiation was about as painful a task as could be set to him , yet when he had a duty to perform , Captain Dobbin was accustomed to go through it without many words or much hesitation : and , having made up his mind completely , that if Miss Sedley was balked of her husband she would die of the disappointment , he was determined to use all his best endeavours to keep her alive . I forbear to enter into minute particulars of the interview between George and Amelia , when the former was brought back to the feet ( or should we venture to say the arms ? ) of his young mistress by the intervention of his friend honest William . A much harder heart than George ’s would have melted at the sight of that sweet face so sadly ravaged by grief and despair , and at the simple tender accents in which she told her little broken - hearted story : but as she did not faint when her mother , trembling , brought Osborne to her ; and as she only gave relief to her overcharged grief , by laying her head on her lover ’s shoulder and there weeping for a while the most tender , copious , and refreshing tears — old Mrs. Sedley , too greatly relieved , thought it was best to leave the young persons to themselves ; and so quitted Emmy crying over George ’s hand , and kissing it humbly as if he were her supreme chief and master , and as if she were quite a guilty and unworthy person needing every favour and grace from him . This prostration and sweet unrepining obedience exquisitely touched and flattered George Osborne . He saw a slave before him in that simple yielding faithful creature , and his soul within him thrilled secretly somehow at the knowledge of his power . He would be generous - minded , Sultan as he was , and raise up this kneeling Esther and make a queen of her : besides , her sadness and beauty touched him as much as her submission , and so he cheered her , and raised her up and forgave her , so to speak . All her hopes and feelings , which were dying and withering , this her sun having been removed from her , bloomed again and at once , its light being restored . You would scarcely have recognized the beaming little face upon Amelia ’s pillow that night as the one that was laid there the night before , so wan , so lifeless , so careless of all round about . The honest Irish maid - servant , delighted with the change , asked leave to kiss the face that had grown all of a sudden so rosy . Amelia put her arms round the girl ’s neck and kissed her with all her heart , like a child . She was little more . She had that night a sweet refreshing sleep , like one — and what a spring of inexpressible happiness as she woke in the morning sunshine ! “
96891	96895	96896	96896	He	4436	” Amelia thought . “
96905	97137	97138	97138	They	4438	” And the fact is , that George thought he was one of the generousest creatures alive : and that he was making a tremendous sacrifice in marrying this young creature . While she and Osborne were having their delightful tête - à - tête above stairs , old Mrs. Sedley and Captain Dobbin were conversing below upon the state of the affairs , and the chances and future arrangements of the young people . Mrs. Sedley having brought the two lovers together and left them embracing each other with all their might , like a true woman , was of opinion that no power on earth would induce Mr. Sedley to consent to the match between his daughter and the son of a man who had so shamefully , wickedly , and monstrously treated him . And she told a long story about happier days and their earlier splendours , when Osborne lived in a very humble way in the New Road , and his wife was too glad to receive some of Jos ’s little baby things , with which Mrs. Sedley accommodated her at the birth of one of Osborne ’s own children . The fiendish ingratitude of that man , she was sure , had broken Mr. S. ’s heart : and as for a marriage , he would never , never , never , never consent . “
97146	97152	97144	97144	Ma’am	16617	” Dobbin said , laughing , “
97171	97313	97167	97169	the little governess	16280	” Was it possible ? Well she never ! Mrs. Sedley was all excitement about this news . She wished that Blenkinsop were here to hear it : Blenkinsop always mistrusted that Miss Sharp.—What an escape Jos had had ! and she described the already well - known love - passages between Rebecca and the Collector of Boggley Wollah . It was not , however , Mr. Sedley ’s wrath which Dobbin feared , so much as that of the other parent concerned , and he owned that he had a very considerable doubt and anxiety respecting the behaviour of the black - browed old tyrant of a Russia merchant in Russell Square . He has forbidden the match peremptorily , Dobbin thought . He knew what a savage determined man Osborne was , and how he stuck by his word . “
97322	97327	97167	97169	the little governess	16280	” argued his friend , “
97394	98102	98103	98103	Sir	15428	” With such a partner Dobbin thought he would not mind Siberia — and , strange to say , this absurd and utterly imprudent young fellow never for a moment considered that the want of means to keep a nice carriage and horses , and of an income which should enable its possessors to entertain their friends genteelly , ought to operate as bars to the union of George and Miss Sedley . It was these weighty considerations which made him think too that the marriage should take place as quickly as possible . Was he anxious himself , I wonder , to have it over?—as people , when death has occurred , like to press forward the funeral , or when a parting is resolved upon , hasten it . It is certain that Mr. Dobbin , having taken the matter in hand , was most extraordinarily eager in the conduct of it . He urged on George the necessity of immediate action : he showed the chances of reconciliation with his father , which a favourable mention of his name in the Gazette must bring about . If need were he would go himself and brave both the fathers in the business . At all events , he besought George to go through with it before the orders came , which everybody expected , for the departure of the regiment from England on foreign service . Bent upon these hymeneal projects , and with the applause and consent of Mrs. Sedley , who did not care to break the matter personally to her husband , Mr. Dobbin went to seek John Sedley at his house of call in the City , the Tapioca Coffee - house , where , since his own offices were shut up , and fate had overtaken him , the poor broken - down old gentleman used to betake himself daily , and write letters and receive them , and tie them up into mysterious bundles , several of which he carried in the flaps of his coat . I do n’t know anything more dismal than that business and bustle and mystery of a ruined man : those letters from the wealthy which he shows you : those worn greasy documents promising support and offering condolence which he places wistfully before you , and on which he builds his hopes of restoration and future fortune . My beloved reader has no doubt in the course of his experience been waylaid by many such a luckless companion . He takes you into the corner ; he has his bundle of papers out of his gaping coat pocket ; and the tape off , and the string in his mouth , and the favourite letters selected and laid before you ; and who does not know the sad eager half - crazy look which he fixes on you with his hopeless eyes ? Changed into a man of this sort , Dobbin found the once florid , jovial , and prosperous John Sedley . His coat , that used to be so glossy and trim , was white at the seams , and the buttons showed the copper . His face had fallen in , and was unshorn ; his frill and neck - cloth hung limp under his bagging waistcoat . When he used to treat the boys in old days at a coffee - house , he would shout and laugh louder than anybody there , and have all the waiters skipping round him ; it was quite painful to see how humble and civil he was to John of the Tapioca , a blear - eyed old attendant in dingy stockings and cracked pumps , whose business it was to serve glasses of wafers , and bumpers of ink in pewter , and slices of paper to the frequenters of this dreary house of entertainment , where nothing else seemed to be consumed . As for William Dobbin , whom he had tipped repeatedly in his youth , and who had been the old gentleman ’s butt on a thousand occasions , old Sedley gave his hand to him in a very hesitating humble manner now , and called him “
98105	98146	98103	98103	Sir	15428	” A feeling of shame and remorse took possession of William Dobbin as the broken old man so received and addressed him , as if he himself had been somehow guilty of the misfortunes which had brought Sedley so low . “
98160	98221	98155	98156	Captain Dobbin	752	” says he , after a skulking look or two at his visitor ( whose lanky figure and military appearance caused some excitement likewise to twinkle in the blear eyes of the waiter in the cracked dancing pumps , and awakened the old lady in black , who dozed among the mouldy old coffee - cups in the bar ) . “
98238	98249	98224	98226	the worthy alderman	4448	” He looked round at the waiter as he said , “
98253	98260	98224	98226	the worthy alderman	4448	” as much as to say , “
98280	98281	98268	98268	friends	16427	” “
98343	98408	98409	98409	My	0	” Dobbin , with a great deal of hesitation and stuttering , protested that he was not in the least hungry or thirsty ; that he had no business to transact ; that he only came to ask if Mr. Sedley was well , and to shake hands with an old friend ; and , he added , with a desperate perversion of truth , “
98456	98537	98449	98449	I	0	” And here he paused , reflecting on his own consummate hypocrisy ; for the day was as fine , and the sunshine as bright as it ever is in Coffin Court . where the Tapioca Coffee - house is situated : and Mr. Dobbin remembered that he had seen Mrs. Sedley himself only an hour before , having driven Osborne down to Fulham in his gig , and left him there tête - à - tête with Miss Amelia . “
98549	98558	98538	98539	My wife	4114	” Sedley replied , pulling out his papers . “
98635	98670	98628	98628	sir?—yes	4474	” The old gentleman ’s eyes were wandering as he spoke , and he was thinking of something else , as he sate thrumming on his papers and fumbling at the worn red tape . “
98677	98682	98671	98671	You	15428	” he went on ; “
98987	98988	98985	98985	Jove	701	” “
98999	99033	98997	98997	sir	15428	” Dobbin said , rather alarmed at the fury of the old man , the veins of whose forehead began to swell , and who sate drumming his papers with his clenched first . “
99059	99060	99062	99062	him	707	” “
99082	99086	99080	99080	sir	15428	” Sedley roared . “
99135	99200	99131	99131	their	4516	” he added , with a break in his voice . Dobbin was not a little affected by the sight of this once kind old friend , crazed almost with misfortune and raving with senile anger . Pity the fallen gentleman : you to whom money and fair repute are the chiefest good ; and so , surely , are they in Vanity Fair . “
99203	99207	99131	99131	their	4516	” he continued , “
99290	99291	99292	99292	I	0	” “
99306	99317	99304	99304	George	1045	” Dobbin said , anxious to come to his point . “
99347	99348	99339	99341	the bearer of	4525	” “
99359	99368	99339	99341	the bearer of	4525	” cried the old man , jumping up . “
99476	99477	99478	99478	His	1045	” “
99527	99528	99533	99534	his father	2492	” “
99541	99547	99533	99534	his father	2492	” old Sedley cried out . “
99600	99601	99582	99582	you	15428	” “
99623	99631	99610	99610	you	15428	” Dobbin answered in a low voice ; “
99727	99767	99768	99768	We	4550	” A light of something like satisfaction seemed to break over old Sedley as this point was put to him : but he still persisted that with his consent the marriage between Amelia and George should never take place . “
99774	99813	99768	99768	We	4550	” Dobbin said , smiling , and told Mr. Sedley , as he had told Mrs. Sedley in the day , before the story of Rebecca ’s elopement with Captain Crawley . It evidently amused the old gentleman . “
99822	99908	99814	99814	You	4551	” said he , tying up his papers ; and his face wore something like a smile upon it , to the astonishment of the blear - eyed waiter who now entered , and had never seen such an expression upon Sedley ’s countenance since he had used the dismal coffee - house . The idea of hitting his enemy Osborne such a blow soothed , perhaps , the old gentleman : and , their colloquy presently ending , he and Dobbin parted good friends . “
99922	99927	99909	99910	My sisters	4555	” George said laughing . “
99995	100119	99987	99987	she	4556	” George , in conversation with Amelia , was rallying the appearance of a young lady of whom his father and sisters had lately made the acquaintance , and who was an object of vast respect to the Russell Square family . She was reported to have I do n’t know how many plantations in the West Indies ; a deal of money in the funds ; and three stars to her name in the East India stockholders ’ list . She had a mansion in Surrey , and a house in Portland Place . The name of the rich West India heiress had been mentioned with applause in the Morning Post . Mrs. Haggistoun , Colonel Haggistoun ’s widow , her relative , “
100121	100343	99987	99987	she	4556	” her , and kept her house . She was just from school , where she had completed her education , and George and his sisters had met her at an evening party at old Hulker ’s house , Devonshire Place ( Hulker , Bullock , and Co. were long the correspondents of her house in the West Indies ) , and the girls had made the most cordial advances to her , which the heiress had received with great good humour . An orphan in her position — with her money — so interesting ! the Misses Osborne said . They were full of their new friend when they returned from the Hulker ball to Miss Wirt , their companion ; they had made arrangements for continually meeting , and had the carriage and drove to see her the very next day . Mrs. Haggistoun , Colonel Haggistoun ’s widow , a relation of Lord Binkie , and always talking of him , struck the dear unsophisticated girls as rather haughty , and too much inclined to talk about her great relations : but Rhoda was everything they could wish — the frankest , kindest , most agreeable creature — wanting a little polish , but so good - natured . The girls Christian - named each other at once . “
100355	100361	100362	100362	She	4559	” Osborne cried , laughing . “
100490	100491	100495	100495	she	4559	” “
100497	100533	100495	100495	she	4559	” asked Emmy , to whom George was rattling away regarding this dark paragon , on the morning of their re - union — rattling away as no other man in the world surely could . “
100601	100602	100579	100579	she	1073	” “
100616	100643	100609	100610	Miss Swartz	647	” Emmy said , remembering that good - natured young mulatto girl , who had been so hysterically affected when Amelia left Miss Pinkerton ’s academy . “
100648	100652	100609	100610	Miss Swartz	647	” George said . “
100732	100733	100719	100719	Jane	908	” “
100742	100748	100736	100736	they	4579	” said Emmy , wistfully . “
100757	100758	100749	100749	They	4579	” “
100777	100781	100749	100749	They	4579	” George replied . “
100869	100881	100866	100866	our	4581	” George said , with an uneasy laugh and a blush . “
101039	101409	101030	101030	him	4598	” Amelia admired Mr. Crawley very much , too , for this ; and trusted Rebecca would be happy with him , and hoped ( with a laugh ) Jos would be consoled . And so the pair went on prattling , as in quite early days . Amelia ’s confidence being perfectly restored to her , though she expressed a great deal of petty jealousy about Miss Swartz , and professed to be dreadfully frightened — like a hypocrite as she was — lest George should forget her for the heiress and her money and her estates in Saint Kitt ’s . But the fact is , she was a great deal too happy to have fears or doubts or misgivings of any sort : and having George at her side again , was not afraid of any heiress or beauty , or indeed of any sort of danger . When Captain Dobbin came back in the afternoon to these people — which he did with a great deal of sympathy for them — it did his heart good to see how Amelia had grown young again — how she laughed , and chirped , and sang familiar old songs at the piano , which were only interrupted by the bell from without proclaiming Mr. Sedley ’s return from the City , before whom George received a signal to retreat . Beyond the first smile of recognition — and even that was an hypocrisy , for she thought his arrival rather provoking — Miss Sedley did not once notice Dobbin during his visit . But he was content , so that he saw her happy ; and thankful to have been the means of making her so . LOVE may be felt for any young lady endowed with such qualities as Miss Swartz possessed ; and a great dream of ambition entered into old Mr. Osborne ’s soul , which she was to realize . He encouraged , with the utmost enthusiasm and friendliness , his daughters ’ amiable attachment to the young heiress , and protested that it gave him ‘ the sincerest pleasure as a father to see the love of his girls so well disposed . “
101415	101423	101410	101410	You	4601	” he would say to Miss Rhoda , “
101602	102127	101597	101597	Champagne	1081	” There is little doubt that old Osborne believed all he said , and that the girls were quite earnest in their protestations of affection for Miss Swartz . People in Vanity Fair fasten on to rich folks quite naturally . If the simplest people are disposed to look not a little kindly on great Prosperity ( for I defy any member of the British public to say that the notion of Wealth has not something awful and pleasing to him ; and you , if you are told that the man next you at dinner has got half a million , not to look at him with a certain interest;)—if the simple look benevolently on money , how much more do your old worldlings regard it ! Their affections rush out to meet and welcome money . Their kind sentiments awaken spontaneously towards the interesting possessors of it . I know some respectable people who do n’t consider themselves at liberty to indulge in friendship for any individual who has not a certain competency , or place in society . They give a loose to their feelings on proper occasions . And the proof is , that the major part of the Osborne family , who had not , in fifteen years , been able to get up a hearty regard for Amelia Sedley , became as fond of Miss Swartz in the course of a single evening as the most romantic advocate of friendship at first sight could desire . What a match for George she ’d be ( the sisters and Miss Wirt agreed ) , and how much better than that insignificant little Amelia ! Such a dashing young fellow as he is , with his good looks , rank , and accomplishments , would be the very husband for her . Visions of balls in Portland Place , presentations at Court , and introductions to half the peerage , filled the minds of the young ladies ; who talked of nothing but George and his grand acquaintances to their beloved new friend . Old Osborne thought she would be a great match , too , for his son . He should leave the army ; he should go to Parliament ; he should cut a figure in the fashion and in the state . His blood boiled with honest British exultation , as he saw the name of Osborne ennobled in the person of his son , and thought that he might be the progenitor of a glorious line of baronets . He worked in the City and on ’ Change , until he knew everything relating to the fortune of the heiress , how her money was placed , and where her estates lay . Young Fred Bullock , one of his chief informants , would have liked to make a bid for her himself ( it was so the young banker expressed it ) only he was booked to Maria Osborne . But not being able to secure her as a wife , the disinterested Fred quite approved of her as a sister - in - law . “
102137	102142	102129	102129	George	709	” was his advice . “
102233	102348	102228	102228	them	4624	” the wag said ; though , when Osborne had left the bank parlour , Mr. Bullock remembered Amelia , and what a pretty girl she was , and how attached to George Osborne ; and he gave up at least ten seconds of his valuable time to regretting the misfortune which had befallen that unlucky young woman . While thus George Osborne ’s good feelings , and his good friend and genius , Dobbin , were carrying back the truant to Amelia ’s feet , George ’s parent and sisters were arranging this splendid match for him , which they never dreamed he would resist . When the elder Osborne gave what he called “
102352	102640	102228	102228	them	4624	” there was no possibility for the most obtuse to mistake his meaning . He called kicking a footman down - stairs , a hint to the latter to leave his service . With his usual frankness and delicacy he told Mr. Haggistoun that he would give her a cheque for five thousand pounds on the day his son was married to her ward ; and called that proposal a hint , and considered it a very dexterous piece of diplomacy . He gave George finally such another hint regarding the heiress ; and ordered him to marry her out of hand , as he would have ordered his butler to drew a cork , or his clerk to write a letter . This imperative hint disturbed George a good deal . He was in the very first enthusiasm and delight of his second courtship of Amelia , which was inexpressibly sweet to him . The contrast of her manners and appearance with those of the heiress , made the idea of a union with the latter appear doubly ludicrous and odious . Carriages and opera - boxes , thought he ; fancy being seen in them by the side of such a mahogany charmer as that ! Add to all , that the junior Osborne was quite as obstinate as the senior ; when he wanted a thing , quite as firm in his resolution to get it ; and quite as violent when angered , as his father in his most stern moments . On the first day when his father formally gave him the hint that he was to place his affections at Miss Swartz ’s feet , George temporised with the old gentleman . “
102652	102656	102650	102650	sir	15428	” he said . “
102686	102750	102753	102753	I	0	” and then he represented , that the time when the regiment was daily expecting to quite England , was exceedingly ill - chosen : that the few days or weeks during which they were still to remain at home , must be devoted to business and not to love - makin time enough for that when he came home with his majority ; “
102757	102766	102753	102753	I	0	” said he , with a satisfied air , “
102784	102876	102772	102772	you	4625	” The father ’s reply to this was founded upon the information which he had got in the City : that the West End chaps would infallibly catch hold of the heiress if any delay took place ; that if he did n’t marry Miss S. , he might at least have an engagement in writing , to come into effect when he returned to England ; and that a man who could get ten thousand a year by staying at home , was a fool to risk his life abroad . “
102904	102936	102937	102937	You	4625	” George interposed . This remark staggered the old gentleman ; but as he had to reply to it , and as his mind was nevertheless made up , he said , “
102976	103824	103825	103825	Dammy	1088	” Thus a new obstacle was in George ’s way , to interfere with his plans regarding Amelia ; and about which he and Dobbin had more than one confidential consultation . His friend ’s opinion respecting the line of conduct which he ought to pursue , we know already . And as for Osborne , when he was once bent on a thing , a fresh obstacle or two only rendered him the more resolute . The dark object of the conspiracy into which the chiefs of the Osborne family had entered , was quite ignorant of all their plans regarding her ( which , strange to say , her friend and chaperon did not divulge ) , and , taking all the young ladies ’ flattery for genuine sentiment , and being , as we have before had occasion to show , of a very warm and impetuous nature , responded to their affection with quite a tropical ardour . And if the truth may be told , I dare say that she too had some selfish attraction in the Russell Square house ; and in a word , thought George Osborne a very nice young man . His whiskers had made an impression upon her , on the very first night she beheld them at the ball at Messrs. Hulkers ; and , as we know , she was not the first woman who had been charmed by them . George had an air at once swaggering and melancholy , languid and fierce . He looked like a man who had passions , secrets , and private harrowing griefs and adventures . His voice was rich and deep . He would say it was a warm evening , or ask his partner to take an ice , with a tone as sad and confidential as if he were breaking her mother ’s death to her , or preluding a declaration of love . He trampled over all the young bucks of his father ’s circle , and was the hero among those third - rate men . Some few sneered at him and hated him . Some , like Dobbin , fanatically admired him . And his whiskers had begun to do their work , and to curl themselves round the affections of Miss Swartz . Whenever there was a chance of meeting him in Russell Square , that simple and good - natured young woman was quite in a flurry to see her dear Misses Osborne . She went to great expenses in new gowns , and bracelets , and bonnets , and in prodigious feathers . She adorned her person with her utmost skill to please the Conqueror , and exhibited all her simple accomplishments to win his favour . The girls would ask her , with the greatest gravity , for a little music , and she would sing her three songs and play her two little pieces as often as ever they asked , and with an always increasing pleasure to herself . During these delectable entertainments , Miss Wirt and the chaperon sate by , and conned over the peerage , and talked about the nobility . The day after George had his hint from his father , and a short time before the hour of dinner , he was lolling upon a sofa in the drawing - room in a very becoming and perfectly natural attitude of melancholy . He had been , at his father ’s request , to Mr. Chopper in the City , ( the old gentleman , though he gave great sums to his son , would never specify any fixed allowance for him , and rewarded him only as he was in the humour ) . He had then been to pass three hours with Amelia , his dear little Amelia , at Fulham ; and he came home to find his sisters spread in starched muslin in the drawing - room , the dowagers cackling in the background , and honest Swartz in her favourite amber - coloured satin , with turquoise bracelets , countless rings , flowers , feathers , and all sorts of tags and gimcracks , about as elegantly decorated as a she chimney - sweep on Mayday . The girls , after vain attempts to engage him in conversation , talked about fashions and the last drawing - room until he was perfectly sick of their chatter . He contrasted their behaviour with little Emmy’s — their shrill voices with her tender ringing tones ; their attitudes and their elbows and their starch , with her humble soft movements and modest graces . Poor Swartz was seated in a place where Emmy had been accustomed to sit . Her bejewelled hands lay sprawling in her amber satin lap . Her tags and ear - rings twinkled , and her big eyes rolled about . She was doing nothing with perfect contentment , and thinking herself charming . Anything so becoming as the satin the sisters had never seen . “
103827	103835	103836	103836	she	1088	” George said to a confidential friend , “
103881	103901	103858	103861	By Jove , Will	701	” He restrained that exhibition of sentiment , however . The sisters began to play the Battle of Prague . “
103909	103920	103858	103861	By Jove , Will	701	” George howled out in a fury from the sofa . “
103946	103947	103926	103926	You	4632	” “
103962	103967	103949	103949	I	0	” Miss Swartz asked . “
103975	103980	103949	103949	I	0	” the sisters said . “
103986	103994	103981	103981	We	4633	” replied the misanthrope on the sofa . “
104002	104011	103995	103995	I	0	” Swartz said , in a meek voice , “
104018	104031	104013	104013	I	0	” It was the last of the worthy young woman ’s collection . “
104038	104043	104044	104044	we	4633	” Miss Maria cried ; “
104049	104152	104044	104044	we	4633	” and went off to fetch the book in which it was . Now it happened that this song , then in the height of the fashion , had been given to the young ladies by a young friend of theirs , whose name was on the title , and Miss Swartz , having concluded the ditty with George ’s applause , ( for he remembered that it was a favourite of Amelia ’s , ) was hoping for an encore perhaps , and fiddling with the leaves of the music , when her eye fell upon the title , and she saw “
104155	104161	104044	104044	we	4633	” written in the corner . “
104164	104178	104182	104182	Amelia	632	” cried Miss Swartz , spinning swiftly round on the music - stool , “
104214	104215	104199	104199	It	632	” “
104221	104228	104199	104199	It	632	” Miss Maria Osborne said hastily . “
104253	104270	104235	104235	Her	632	” This was Miss Maria ’s return for George ’s rudeness about the Battle of Prague . “
104279	104286	104272	104272	you	0	” George said , bouncing up . “
104318	104319	104313	104313	She	632	” “
104332	104336	104322	104322	you	0	” cried Jane . “
104341	104342	104337	104337	Papa	675	” “
104349	104354	104355	104355	I	0	” George cried out . “
104452	104462	104463	104463	George	709	” and he went up and wrung her hand . “
104467	104475	104476	104476	I	0	” one of the sisters cried imploringly . “
104479	104484	104476	104476	I	0	” George said fiercely , “
104493	104587	104490	104491	Amelia Sed	1091	” He stopped . Old Osborne was in the room with a face livid with rage , and eyes like hot coals . Though George had stopped in his sentence , yet , his blood being up , he was not to be cowed by all the generations of Osborne ; rallying instantly , he replied to the bullying look of his father , with another so indicative of resolution and defiance , that the elder man quailed in his turn , and looked away . He felt that the tussle was coming . “
104599	104603	104592	104592	me	0	” he said . “
104613	104618	104611	104611	George	709	” and they marched . “
104636	104852	104853	104856	Gentlemen of the Guard	4650	” Osborne said to his partner ; and during all the dinner , George rattled on with a volubility which surprised himself , and made his father doubly nervous for the fight which was to take place as soon as the ladies were gone . The difference between the pair was , that while the father was violent and a bully , the son had thrice the nerve and courage of the parent , and could not merely make an attack , but resist it ; and finding that the moment was now come when the contest between him and his father was to be decided , he took his dinner with perfect coolness and appetite before the engagement began . Old Osborne , on the contrary , was nervous , and drank much . He floundered in his conversation with the ladies , his neighbours : George ’s coolness only rendering him more angry . It made him half mad to see the calm way in which George , flapping his napkin , and with a swaggering bow , opened the door for the ladies to leave the room ; and filling himself a glass of wine , smacked it , and looked his father full in the face , as if to say , “
104861	104903	104853	104856	Gentlemen of the Guard	4650	” The old man also took a supply of ammunition , but his decanter clinked against the glass as he tried to fill it . After giving a great heave , and with a purple choking face , he then began . “
104939	104940	104927	104927	I	0	” “
104945	104949	104927	104927	I	0	” says George , “
104973	104974	104975	104975	I	0	” “
105016	105021	105009	105009	I	0	” the elder said . “
105034	105039	105029	105030	your son	15433	” George answered haughtily . “
105077	105153	105154	105154	My	0	” Whenever the lad assumed his haughty manner , it always created either great awe or great irritation in the parent . Old Osborne stood in secret terror of his son as a better gentleman than himself ; and perhaps my readers may have remarked in their experience of this Vanity Fair of ours , that there is no character which a low - minded man so much mistrusts , as that of a gentleman . “
105269	105270	105260	105260	mine	0	” “
105307	105328	105300	105300	you	15428	” said George ( fingering a bundle of notes which he had got in the morning from Mr. Chopper ) . “
105347	105348	105349	105349	I	0	” “
105361	105366	105351	105351	you	15428	” the sire answered . “
105410	105411	105407	105407	I	0	” “
105416	105431	105407	105407	I	0	” George asked , with scarcely a sneer , filling another glass of claret . “
105437	105445	105407	105407	I	0	” burst out his father with a screaming oath—“that
105470	105471	105468	105468	sir	15428	” “
105559	105560	105551	105551	you	15428	” “
105569	105583	105564	105564	sir	15428	” the old gentleman said , his eyes starting out of his head . “
105677	105692	105675	105675	Heavens	769	” said George , working himself up into passion and enthusiasm as he proceeded , “
105764	105765	105760	105760	she	632	” “
105784	105790	105782	105782	sir	15428	” the father cried out . “
105862	105863	105859	105859	you	15428	” “
105869	105880	105859	105859	you	15428	” George said , pulling up his shirt - collars . “
105911	105951	105952	105952	I	0	” Ms. Osborne pulled frantically at the cord by which he was accustomed to summon the butler when he wanted wine — and almost black in the face , ordered that functionary to call a coach for Captain Osborne . “
105957	105973	105952	105952	I	0	” said George , coming into the Slaughters an hour afterwards , looking very pale . “
105979	105994	105952	105952	I	0	” says Dobbin . George told what had passed between his father and himself . “
106003	106010	105995	105995	I	0	” he said with an oath . “
106020	106655	106018	106018	Dobbin	752	” ENEMIES the most obstinate and courageous ca n’t hold out against starvation : so the elder Osborne felt himself pretty easy about his adversary in the encounter we have just described ; and as soon as George ’s supplies fell short , confidently expected his unconditional submission . It was unlucky , to be sure , that the lad should have secured a stock of provisions on the very day when the first encounter took place ; but this relief was only temporary , old Osborne thought , and would but delay George ’s surrender . No communication passed between father and son for some days . The former was sulky at this silence , but not disquieted ; for , as he said , he knew where he could put the screw upon George , and only waited the result of that operation . He told the sisters the upshot of the dispute between them , but ordered them to take no notice of the matter , and welcome George on his return as if nothing had happened . His cover was laid as usual every day , and perhaps the old gentleman rather anxiously expected him ; but he never came . Some one inquired at the Slaughters ’ regarding him , where it was said that he and his friend Captain Dobbin had left town . One gusty , raw day at the end of April,—the rain whipping the pavement of that ancient street where the old Slaughters ’ Coffee - house was once situated,—George Osborne came into the coffee - room , looking very haggard and pale ; although dressed rather smartly in a blue coat and brass buttons , and a neat buff waistcoat of the fashion of those days . Here was his friend Captain Dobbin , in blue and brass too , having abandoned the military frock and French - grey trowsers , which were the usual coverings of his lanky person . Dobbin had been in the coffee - room for an hour or more . He had tried all the papers , but could not read them . He had looked at the clock many scores of times ; and at the street , where the rain was pattering down , and the people as they clinked by in patterns , left long reflections on the shining stone : he tattooed at the table : he bit his nails most completely , and nearly to the quick ( he was accustomed to ornament his great big hands in this way ): he balanced the teaspoon dexterously on the milk ju upset it , & c. , & c. ; and in fact showed those signs of disquietude , and practised those desperate attempts at amusement , which men are accustomed to employ when very anxious , and expectant , and perturbed in mind . Some of his comrades , gentlemen who used the room , joked him about the splendour of his costume and his agitation of manner . One asked him if he was going to be married ? Dobbin laughed , and said he would send his acquaintance ( Major Wagstaff of the Engineers ) a piece of cake when that event took place . At length Captain Osborne made his appearance , very smartly dressed , but very pale and agitated as we have said . He wiped his pale face with a large yellow bandanna pocket - handkerchief that was prodigiously scented . He shook hands with Dobbin , looked at the clock , and told John , the waiter , to bring him some curaçoa . Of this cordial he swallowed off a couple of glasses with nervous eagerness . His friend asked with some interest about his health . “
106668	106672	106666	106666	Dob	946	” said he . “
106715	106716	106711	106711	Rocket	1094	” “
106721	106725	106719	106719	I	0	” William responded . “
106752	106753	106745	106745	I	0	” “
106776	106777	106763	106763	I	0	” “
106787	106792	106763	106763	I	0	” Dobbin interrupted him . “
106823	106908	106909	106909	We	4715	” It was about half - an - hour from twelve when this brief meeting and colloquy took place between the two captains . A coach , into which Captain Osborne ’s servant put his master ’s desk and dressing - case , had been in waiting for some time ; and into this the two gentlemen hurried under an umbrella , and the valet mounted on the box , cursing the rain and the dampness of the coachman who was steaming beside him . “
106921	106925	106909	106909	We	4715	” says he ; “
106931	107038	106909	106909	We	4715	” And the carriage drove on , taking the road down Piccadilly , where Apsley House and St. George ’s Hospital wore red jackets still ; where there were oil - lamps ; where Achilles was not yet born ; nor the Pimlico arch raised ; nor the hideous equestrian monster which pervades it and the neigbourhood;—and so they drove down by Brompton to a certain chapel near the Fulham - road there . A chariot was in waiting with four horses ; likewise a coach of the kind called glass coaches . Only a very few idlers were collected on account of the dismal rain . “
107042	107046	107047	107047	I	0	” said George , “
107053	107054	107047	107047	I	0	” “
107061	107096	107055	107056	My master	4718	” said Mr. Joseph Sedley ’s servant , who was in waiting ; and he and Mr. Osborne ’s man agreed as they followed George and William into the church , that it was a “
107115	107116	107118	107118	you	4719	” “
107121	107133	107118	107118	you	4719	” said our old friend , Jos Sedley , coming forward . “
107188	107584	107182	107182	Emmy	677	” Jos Sedley was splendid . He was fatter than ever . His shirt collars were higher ; his face was redder ; his shirt - frill flaunted gorgeously out of his variegated waistcoat . Varnished boots were not invented as yet ; but the Hessians on his beautiful legs shone so that they must have been the identical pair in which the gentleman in the old picture used to shave himself ; and on his light green coat there bloomed a fine wedding favour , like a great white spreading magnolia . In a word , George had thrown the great cast . He was going to be married . Hence his pallor and nervousness — his sleepless night and agitation in the morning . I have heard people who have gone through the same thing own to the same emotion . After three of four ceremonies , you get accustomed to it , no doubt ; but the first dip , everybody allows , is awful . The bride was dressed in a brown silk pelisse ( as Captain Dobbin has since informed me ) , and wore a straw bonnet with a pink ribbon ; over the bonnet she had a veil of white Chantilly lace , a gift from Mr. Joseph Sedley , her brother . Captain Dobbin himself had asked leave to present her with a gold chain and watch . Which she sported on this occasion ; and her mother gave her her diamond brooch — almost the only trinket which was left to the old lady . As the service went on , Mrs. Sedley sat and whimpered a great deal in a pew , consoled by the Irish maid - servant and Mrs. Clapp from the lodgings . Old Sedley would not be present . Jos acted for his father , giving away the bride whilst Captain Dobbin stepped up as groom’s - man to his friend George . There was nobody in the church besides the officiating persons and the small marriage party and their attendants . The two valets sat aloof superciliously . The rain came rattling down on the windows . In the intervals of the service you heard it , and the sobbing of old Mrs. Sedley in the pew . The person ’s tones echoed sadly through the empty walls . Osborne ’s “
107587	107660	107182	107182	Emmy	677	” was sounded in very deep bass . Emmy ’s response came fluttering up to her lips from her heart , but was scarcely heard by anybody except Captain Dobbin . When the service was completed , Jos Sedley came forward and kissed his sister , the bride , for the first time for many months — George ’s look of gloom had gone , and he seemed quite proud and radiant . “
107668	107703	107666	107666	William	752	” says he , putting his hand fondly upon Dobbin ’s shoulder ; and Dobbin went up and touched Amelia on the cheek . Then they went into the vestry and signed the register . “
107711	107748	107708	107709	Old Dobbin	745	” George said , grasping him by the hand , with something very like moisture glistening in his eyes . William replied only by nodding his head . His heart was too full to say much . “
107764	107788	107758	107758	you	4724	” Osborne said . After Mrs. Sedley had taken an hysterical adieu of her daughter , the pair went off to the carriage . “
107799	107900	107795	107795	you	4724	” George cried to a small crowd of damp urchins that were hanging about the chapel - door . The rain drove into the bride and bride - groom ’s faces as they passed to the chariot . The postilions ’ favours draggled on their dripping jackets . The few children made a dismal cheer , as the carriage , splashing mud , drove away . William Dobbin stood in the church - porch , looking at it , a queer figure . The small crew of spectators jeered him . He was not thinking about them or their laughter . “
107910	107990	107908	107908	Dobbin	752	” a voice cried behind him ; as a pudgy hand was laid on his shoulder , and the honest fellow ’s reverie was interrupted . But the Captain had no heart to go a feasting with Jos Sedley . He put the weeping old lady and her attendants into the carriage with Jos , and left them without any farther words passing . This carriage , too , drove away , and the urchins gave another sarcastical cheer . “
108431	108447	108448	108452	one of these three promenaders	4753	“ What a monstrous fine girl that is in the lodgings over the milliner ’s , ”
108458	108476	108448	108452	one of these three promenaders	4753	“ Gad , Crawley , did you see what a wink she gave me as I passed ? ”
108477	108489	108491	108491	another	2654	“ Do n’t break her heart , Jos , you rascal , ”
108493	108505	108491	108491	another	2654	“ Do n’t trifle with her affections , you Don Juan ! ”
108506	108510	108512	108513	Jos Sedley	674	“ Get away , ”
108640	108653	108654	108655	the buck	4762	“ What shall we do , boys , till the ladies return ? ”
108671	108680	108687	108689	the tall one	4767	“ Let ’s have a game at billiards , ”
108695	108704	108687	108689	the tall one	4767	“ No , dammy ; no , Captain , ”
108710	108726	108705	108705	Jos	674	“ No billiards to - day , Crawley , my boy ; yesterday was enough . ”
108727	108733	108735	108735	Crawley	847	“ You play very well , ”
108739	108756	108735	108735	Crawley	847	“ Do n’t he , Osborne ? How well he made that five stroke , eh ? ”
108757	108760	108761	108761	Osborne	909	“ Famous , ”
108764	108849	108761	108761	Osborne	909	“ Jos is a devil of a fellow at billiards , and at everything else , too . I wish there were any tiger - hunting about here ! we might go and kill a few before dinner . ( There goes a fine girl ! what an ankle , eh , Jos ? ) Tell us that story about the tiger - hunt , and the way you did for him in the jungle — it ’s a wonderful story that , Crawley . ”
108857	108864	108866	108866	he	709	“ It ’s rather slow work , ”
108868	108877	108866	108866	he	709	“ down here ; what shall we do ? ”
108878	108896	108897	108897	Crawley	847	“ Shall we go and look at some horses that Snaffer ’s just brought from Lewes fair ? ”
108900	108912	108914	108916	the rogue Jos	674	“ Suppose we go and have some jellies at Dutton ’s , ”
108927	108935	108914	108916	the rogue Jos	674	“ Devilish fine gal at Dutton ’s . ”
108936	108953	108954	108954	George	709	“ Suppose we go and see the Lightning come in , it ’s just about time ? ”
109126	109136	109137	109137	she	4779	“ We have had a delightful drive , George , ”
109140	109163	109137	109137	she	4779	“ and — and we ’re so glad to come back ; and , Joseph , do n’t let him be late . ”
109164	109185	109186	109186	Rebecca	630	“ Do n’t be leading our husbands into mischief , Mr. Sedley , you wicked , wicked man , you , ”
109204	109214	109186	109186	Rebecca	630	“ No billiards , no smoking , no naughtiness ! ”
109215	109229	109232	109232	Jos	674	“ My dear Mrs. Crawley — Ah , now ! upon my honour ! ”
109497	109555	109556	109556	Rebecca	630	“ Do you remember the last time we met at Miss Crawley ’s , when I was so rude to you , dear Captain Osborne ? I thought you seemed careless about dear Amelia . It was that made me angry : and so pert : and so unkind : and so ungrateful . Do forgive me ! ”
109795	109813	109814	109814	Rebecca	630	“ I wish you could see some of Rawdon ’s friends who are always about our door , ”
109818	109872	109814	109814	Rebecca	630	“ Did you ever see a dun , my dear ; or a bailiff and his man ? Two of the abominable wretches watched all last week at the green grocer ’s opposite , and we could not get away until Sunday . If aunty does not relent , what shall we do ? ”
110251	110259	110260	110260	George	1045	“ Hullo ! there ’s old Dobbin , ”
110287	110309	110310	110310	Osborne	1045	“ How are you , old fellow ? Glad you ’re come down . Emmy ’ll be delighted to see you , ”
110343	110366	110333	110333	he	1045	“ What ’s the news ? Have you been in Russell Square ? What does the governor say ? Tell me everything . ”
110374	110381	110383	110383	he	752	“ I ’ve seen your father , ”
110385	110417	110383	110383	he	752	“ How ’s Amelia — Mrs. George ? I ’ll tell you all the news presently : but I ’ve brought the great news of all : and that is — — ”
110418	110426	110427	110427	George	657	“ Out with it , old fellow , ”
110430	110475	110427	110427	George	657	“ We ’re ordered to Belgium . All the army goes — Guards and all . Heavytop ’s got the gout , and is mad at not being able to move . O’Dowd goes in command , and we embark from Chatham next week . ”
111386	111396	111397	111398	Miss Osborne	909	“ What a nice party it was last night , ”
111405	111426	111427	111427	she	909	“ and — and how you ’re improved in your dancing , Captain Dobbin . Surely somebody has taught you , ”
111434	111477	111427	111427	she	909	“ You should see me dance a reel with Mrs. Major O’Dowd of ours ; and a jig — did you ever see a jig ? But I think anybody could dance with you , Miss Osborne , who dance so well . ”
111478	111490	111491	111493	the fair questioner	4898	“ Is the Major ’s lady young and beautiful , Captain ? ”
111496	111568	111491	111493	the fair questioner	4898	“ Ah , what a terrible thing it must be to be a soldier ’s wife ! I wonder they have any spirits to dance , and in these dreadful times of war , too ! O Captain Dobbin , I tremble sometimes when I think of our dearest George , and the dangers of the poor soldier . Are there many married officers of the — th , Captain Dobbin ? ”
111569	111583	111584	111585	Miss Wirt	907	“ Upon my word , she ’s playing her hand rather too openly , ”
111612	111622	111623	111623	Dobbin	752	“ One of our young men is just married , ”
111632	111651	111623	111623	Dobbin	752	“ It was a very old attachment , and the young couple are as poor as church mice . ”
111652	111663	111664	111665	Miss Osborne	909	“ O , how delightful ! O , how romantic ! ”
111672	111675	111669	111670	the Captain	2862	“ old attachment ”
111677	111679	111669	111670	the Captain	2862	“ poor ”
111686	111695	111696	111696	he	2862	“ The finest young fellow in the regiment , ”
111699	111735	111696	111696	he	2862	“ Not a braver or handsomer officer in the army ; and such a charming wife ! How you would like her ! how you will like her when you know her , Miss Osborne . ”
111865	111904	111905	111905	Dobbin	752	“ But it ’s not about marriage that I came to speak — that is that marriage — that is — no , I mean — my dear Miss Osborne , it ’s about our dear friend George , ”
111908	111912	111913	111913	she	4902	“ About George ? ”
111969	112002	111960	111960	George	709	“ Hang it , Will , why do n’t you take old Jane ? She ’ll have you if you ask her . I ’ll bet you five to two she will . ”
112003	112011	112012	112012	he	752	“ Yes , about George , then , ”
112015	112100	111960	111960	George	709	“ There has been a difference between him and Mr. Osborne . And I regard him so much — for you know we have been like brothers — that I hope and pray the quarrel may be settled . We must go abroad , Miss Osborne . We may be ordered off at a day ’s warning . Who knows what may happen in the campaign ? Do n’t be agitated , dear Miss Osborne ; and those two at least should part friends . ”
112101	112119	112120	112121	the lady	2536	“ There has been no quarrel , Captain Dobbin , except a little usual scene with papa , ”
112124	112186	112120	112121	the lady	2536	“ We are expecting George back daily . What papa wanted was only for his good . He has but to come back , and I ’m sure all will be well ; and dear Rhoda , who went away from here in sad , sad anger , I know will forgive him . Woman forgives but too readily , Captain . ”
112187	112198	112199	112200	Mr. Dobbin	727	“ Such an angel as you I am sure would , ”
112207	112233	112199	112200	Mr. Dobbin	727	“ And no man can pardon himself for giving a woman pain . What would you feel , if a man were faithless to you ? ”
112234	112263	112264	112265	Miss Osborne	908	“ I should perish — I should throw myself out of window — I should take poison — I should pine and die . I know I should , ”
112286	112292	112293	112293	Dobbin	727	“ And there are others , ”
112296	112450	112293	112293	Dobbin	727	“ as true and as kind - hearted as yourself . I ’m not speaking about the West Indian heiress , Miss Osborne , but about a poor girl whom George once loved , and who was bred from her childhood to think of nobody but him . I ’ve seen her in her poverty uncomplaining , broken - hearted , without a fault . It is of Miss Sedley I speak . Dear Miss Osborne , can your generous heart quarrel with your brother for being faithful to her ? Could his own conscience ever forgive him if he deserted her ? Be her friend — she always loved you — and — and I am come here charged by George to tell you that he holds his engagement to her as the most sacred duty he has ; and to entreat you , at least , to be on his side . ”
112498	112501	112503	112503	she	4905	“ Well , ”
112505	112559	112560	112560	she	4905	“ this is — most surprising — most painful — most extraordinary — what will papa say?—that George should fling away such a superb establishment as was offered to him,—but at any rate he has found a very brave champion in you , Captain Dobbin . It is of no use , however , ”
112567	112646	112560	112560	she	4905	“ I feel for poor Miss Sedley , most certainly — most sincerely , you know . We never thought the match a good one , though we were always very kind to her here — very . But papa will never consent , I am sure . And a well brought up young woman , you know,—with a well - regulated mind , must — George must give her up , Captain Dobbin , indeed he must . ”
112647	112665	112666	112666	Dobbin	752	“ Ought a man to give up the woman he loved , just when misfortune befel her ? ”
112674	112727	112666	112666	Dobbin	752	“ Dear Miss Osborne , is this the counsel I hear from you ? My dear young lady ! you must befriend her . He ca n’t give her up . He must not give her up . Would a man , think you , give you up if you were poor ? ”
112742	112761	112762	112762	she	908	“ I do n’t know whether we poor girls ought to believe what you men say , Captain , ”
112765	112789	112762	112762	she	908	“ There is that in woman ’s tenderness which induces her to believe too easily . I ’m afraid you are cruel , cruel deceivers,”—and
112815	112818	112820	112820	he	752	“ Deceivers ! ”
112822	112874	112820	112820	he	752	“ No , dear Miss Osborne , all men are not ; your brother is not ; George has loved Amelia Sedley ever since they were children ; no wealth would make him marry any but her . Ought he to forsake her ? Would you counsel him to do so ? ”

I have been at the Horse Guards this morning , and there ’s no doubt that our regiment will be ordered abroad , and on its way to Belgium before the week is over . And you know , sir , that we sha n’t be home again before a tussle which may be fatal to many of us . ”
114333	114351	114352	114352	he	709	“ My s — — , the regiment will do its duty , sir , I daresay , ”
114355	114364	114352	114352	he	709	“ The French are very strong , sir , ”
114369	114414	114365	114365	Dobbin	752	“ The Russians and Austrians will be a long time before they can bring their troops down . We shall have the first of the flight , sir ; and depend on it Boney will take care that it shall be a hard one . ”

114435	114451	114425	114426	his interlocutor	4973	“ I suppose no Briton ’s afraid of any d — — Frenchman , hay ? ”
114452	114528	114530	114530	he	709	“ I only mean , that before we go . and considering the great and certain risk that hangs over every one of us — if there are any differences between you and George — it would be as well , sir , that — that you should shake hands : would n’t it ? Should anything happen to him , I think you would never forgive yourself if you had n’t parted in charity . ”
114705	114714	114716	114717	Mr. Osborne	709	“ You are a good fellow , William , ”
114723	115042	114716	114717	Mr. Osborne	709	“ and me and George should n’t part in anger , that is true . Look here . I ’ve done for him as much as any father ever did . He ’s had three times as much money from me , as I warrant your father ever gave you . But I do n’t brag about that . How I ’ve toiled for him , and worked and employed my talents and energy , I wo n’t say . Ask Chopper . Ask himself . Ask the City of London . Well , I proposed to him such a marriage as any nobleman in the land might be proud of — the only thing in life I ever asked him — and he refuses me . Am I wrong ? Is the quarrel my making ? What do I seek but his good , for which I ’ve been toiling like a convict ever since he was born ? Nobody can say there ’s anything selfish in me . Let him come back . I say , here ’s my hand . I say , forget and forgive . As for marrying now , it ’s out of the question . Let him and Miss S. make it up , and make out the marriage afterwards , when he comes back a Colonel ; for he shall be a Colonel , by G — — he shall , if money can do it . I ’m glad you ’ve brought him round . I know it ’s you Dobbin . You ’ve took him out of many a scrape before . Let his come . I sha n’t be hard . Come along , and dine in Russell Square to - day : both of you . The old shop , the old hour . You ’ll find a neck of venison , and no questions asked . ”
115070	115073	115075	115075	he	752	“ Sir , ”
115077	115128	115075	115075	he	752	“ I fear you deceive yourself . I am sure you do . George is much too high - minded a man ever to marry for money . A threat on your part that you would disinherit him in case of disobedience would only be followed by resistance on his . ”
115129	115152	115153	115154	Mr. Osborne	709	“ Why , hang it , man , you do n’t call offering him eight or ten thousand a year threatening him ? ”
115163	115190	115153	115154	Mr. Osborne	709	“ Gad , if Miss S. will have me , I ’m her man . I ai n’t particular about a shade or so of tawny . ”

115259	115376	115242	115243	Mr. Osborne	709	“ you do n’t mean that he ’s such a d — — ; fool as to be still hankering after that swindling old bankrupt ’s daughter ? You ’ve not come here for to make me suppose that he wants to marry her ? Marry her , that is a good one . My son and heir marry a beggar ’s girl out of a gutter . D — — him . if he does , let him buy a broom and sweep a crossing . She was always dangling and ogling after him , I recollect now ; and I ’ve no doubt she was put on by her old sharper of a father . ”
115377	115388	115389	115389	Dobbin	752	“ Mr. Sedley was your very good friend , sir , ”
115400	115431	115389	115389	Dobbin	752	“ Time was you called him better names than rogue and swindler . The match was of your making . George had no right to play fast and loose — — ”
115432	115437	115440	115441	old Osborne	709	“ Fast and loose ! ”
115443	115555	115440	115441	old Osborne	709	“ Fast and loose ! Why , hang me , those are the very words my gentleman used himself when he gave himself airs , last Thursday was a fortnight , and talked about the British army to his father who made him . What , it ’s you who have been a setting of him up — is it ? and my service to you , Captain . It ’s you who want to introduce beggars into my family . Thank you for nothing , Captain . Marry her indeed — he , he ! why should he ? I warrant you she ’d go to him fast enough without . ”
115556	115559	115561	115561	Dobbin	752	“ Sir , ”
115569	115586	115561	115561	Dobbin	752	“ no man shall abuse that lady in my hearing , and you least of all . ”
115587	115626	115627	115627	Osborne	709	“ O , your’re a going to call me out , are you ? Stop , let me ring the bell for pistols for two . Mr. George sent you here to insult his father , did he ? ”
115637	115641	115643	115643	Dobbin	752	“ Mr. Osborne , ”
115650	115680	115643	115643	Dobbin	752	“ it ’s you who are insulting the best creature in the world . You had best spare her , sir , for she ’s your son ’s wife . ”

115769	115784	115758	115759	Mr. Chopper	955	“ The governor ’s in a fit . What has Mr. George been doing ? ”
115785	115794	115795	115795	Dobbin	752	“ He married Miss Sedley five days ago , ”
115798	115814	115795	115795	Dobbin	752	“ I was his groomsman , Mr. Chopper , and you must stand his friend . ”

117215	118059	117210	117211	G. Osborne	1027	” & c. ,—his letters from the West Indies — his agent ’s letters , and the newspapers containing his commissions : here was a whip he had when a boy , and in a paper a locket containing his hair , which his mother used to wear . Turning one over after another , and musing over these memorials , the unhappy man passed many hours . His dearest vanities , ambitious hopes , had all been here . What pride he had in his boy ! He was the handsomest child ever seen . Everybody said he was like a nobleman ’s son . A royal princess had remarked him , and kissed him , and asked his name in Kew Gardens . What City man could show such another ? Could a prince have been better cared for ? Anything that money could buy had been his son ’s . He used to go down on speech - days with four horses and new liveries , and scatter new shillings among the boys at the school where George was : when he went with George to the depôt of his regiment , before the boy embarked for Canada , he gave the officers such a dinner as the Duke of York might have sat down to . Had he ever refused a bill when George drew one ? There they were — paid without a word . Many a general in the army could n’t ride the horses he had ! He had the child before his eyes , on a hundred different days when he remembered George — after dinner , when he used to come in as bold as a lord and drink off his glass by his father ’s side , at the head of the table — on the pony at Brighton , when he cleared the hedge and kept up with the huntsman — on the day when he was presented to the Prince Regent at the levee , when all Saint James ’s could n’t produce a finer young fellow . And this , this was the end of all!—to marry a bankrupt and fly in the face of duty and fortune ! What humiliation and fury : what pangs of sickening rage , balked ambition and love ; what wounds of outraged vanity , tenderness even , had this old worldling now to suffer under ! Having examined these papers , and pondered over this one and the other , in that bitterest of all helpless woe , with which miserable men think of happy past times — George ’s father took the whole of the documents out of the drawer in which he had kept them so long , and locked them into a writing - box , which he tied , and sealed with his seal . Then he opened the book - case , and took down the great red Bible we have spoken of — a pompous book , seldom looked at , and shining all over with gold . There was a frontispiece to the volume , representing Abraham sacrificing Isaac . Here , according to custom , Osborne had recorded on the fly - leaf and in his large clerk - like hand , the dates of his marriage and his wife ’s death , and the births and Christian names of his children . Jane came first , then George Sedley Osborne , then Maria Frances , and the days of the christening of each . Taking a pen , he carefully obliterated George ’s names from the page ; and when the leaf was quite dry , restored the volume to the place from which he had moved it . Then he took a document out of another drawer , where his own private papers were kept ; and having read it , crumpled it up and lighted it at one of the candles , and saw it burn entirely away in the grate . It was his will ; which being burned , he sate down and wrote off a letter , and rang for his servant , whom he charged to deliver it in the morning . It was morning already : as he went up to bed , the whole house was alight with the sunshine ; and the birds were singing among the fresh green leaves in Russell Square . Anxious to keep all Mr. Osborne ’s family and dependants in good humour , and to make as many friends as possible for George in his hour of adversity , William Dobbin , who knew the effect which good dinners and good wines have upon the soul of man , wrote off immediately on his return to his inn the most hospitable of invitations to Thomas Chopper , Esquire , begging that gentleman to dine with him at the Slaughters ’ next day . The note reached Mr. Chopper before he left the City , and the instant reply was , that “
118079	118236	117210	117211	G. Osborne	1027	” The invitation and the rough draft of the answer were shown to Mrs. Chopper and her daughters on his return to Somers ’ Town that evening , and they talked about military gents and West End men with great exultation as the family sate and partook of tea . When the girls had gone to rest , Mr. and Mrs. C. discoursed upon the strange events which were occuring in the gevernor ’s family . Never had the clerk seen his principal so moved . When he went in to Mr. Osborne , after Captain Dobbin ’s departure , Mr. Chopper found his chief black in the face , and all but in a fit : some dreadful quarrel , he was certain , had occurred between Mr. O. and the young Captain . Chopper had been instructed to make out an account of all sums paid to Captain Osborne within the last three years . “
118248	118575	118576	118576	I	0	” the chief clerk said , and respected his old and young master the more , for the liberal way in which the guineas had been flung about . The dispute was something about Miss Sedley . Mrs. Chopper vowed and declared she pitied that poor young lady to lose such a handsome young fellow as the Capting . As the daughter of an unlucky speculator , who had paid a very shabby dividend , Mr. Chopper had no great regard for Miss Sedley . He respected the house of Osborne before all others in the City of London : and his hope and wish was that Captain George should marry a nobleman ’s daughter . The clerk slept a great deal sounder than his principal that night ; and , cuddling his children after breakfast ( of which he partook with a very hearty appetite , though his modest cup of life was only sweetened with brown sugar ) , he set off in his best Sunday suit and frilled shirt for business , promising his admiring wife not to punish Captain D ’s port too severely that evening . Mr. Osborne ’s countenance , when he arrived in the City at his usual time , struck those dependents who were accustomed , for good reasons , to watch its expression , as peculiarly ghastly and worn . At twelve o’clock Mr. Higgs ( of the firm of Higgs & Blatherwick , solicitors , Bedford Row , ) called by appointment , and was ushered into the governor ’s private room , and closeted there for more than an hour . At about one Mr. Chopper received a note brought by Captain Dobbin ’s man , and containing an inclosure for Mr. Osborne , which the clerk went in and delivered . A short time afterwards Mr. Chopper and Mr. Birch , the next clerk , were summoned , and requested to witness a paper . “
118584	118766	118576	118576	I	0	” Mr. Osborne said , to which these gentlemen appended their names accordingly . No conversation passed . Mr. Higgs looked exceedingly grave as he came into the outer rooms , and very hard in Mr. Chopper ’s face ; but there were not any explanations . It was remarked that Mr. Osborne was particularly quiet and gentle all day , to the surprise of those who had augured ill from his darkling demeanour . He called no man names that day , and was not heard to swear once . He left business early ; and before going away , summoned his chief clerk once more , and having given him general instructions , asked him , after some seeming hesitation and reluctance to speak , if he knew whether Captain Dobbin was in town ? Chopper said he believed he was . Indeed both of them knew the fact perfectly . Osborne took a letter directed to that officer , and giving it to the clerk , requested the latter to deliver it into Dobbin ’s own hand immediately . “
118772	118786	118770	118770	Chopper	955	” says he , taking his hat , and with a strange look , “
118793	119144	118770	118770	Chopper	955	” Exactly as the clock struck two ( there was no doubt an appointment between the pair , ) Mr. Frederick Bullock called , and he and Mr. Osborne walked away together . The Colonel of the — th regiment , in which Messieurs Dobbin and Osborne had companies , was an old General who had made his first campaign under Wolfe at Quebec , and was long since quite too old and feeble for command ; but he took some interest in the regiment of which he was the nominal head , and made certain of his young officers welcome at his table , a kind of hospitality which I believe is not now common amongst his brethren . Captain Dobbin was an especial favourite of this old General . Dobbin was versed in the literature of his profession , and could talk about the great Frederick , and the Empress Queen , and their wars , almost as well as the General himself , who was indifferent to the triumphs of the present day , and whose heart was with the tacticians of fifty years back . This officer sent a summons to Dobbin to come and breakfast with him , on the morning when Mr. Osborne altered his will and Mr. Chopper put on his best shirt frill , and then informed his young favourite , a couple of days in advance , of that which they were all expecting — a marching order to go to Belgium . The order for the regiment to hold itself in readiness would leave the Horse Guards in a day or two ; and as transports were in plenty , they would get their route before the week was over . Recruits had come in during the stay of the regiment at Chatham ; and the old General hoped that the regiment which had helped to beat Montcalm in Canada , and to rout Mr. Washington on Long Island , would prove itself worthy of its historical reputation on the oft - trodden battle - grounds of the Low Countries . “
119159	119197	119199	119199	you	5067	” said the old General , taking a pinch of snuff with his trembling white old hand , and then pointing to the spot of his robe de chambre under which his heart was still feebly beating , “
119232	119467	119468	119468	I	0	” With which the General gave his young friend a finger to shake , and a good - natured nod of his powdered and pig - tailed head ; and the door being closed upon Dobbin , sate down to pen a poulet ( he was exceedingly vain of his French ) to Mademoiselle Amènaide of His Majesty ’s Theatre . This news made Dobbin grave , and he thought of our friends at Brighton , and then he was ashamed of himself that Amelia was always the first thing in his thoughts ( always before anybody — before father and mother , sisters and duty — always at waking and sleeping indeed , and all day long ) ; and returning to his hotel , he sent off a brief note to Mr. Osborne acquainting him with the information which he had received , and which might tend farther , he hoped , to bring about a reconciliation with George . This note , despatched by same messenger who had carried the invitation to Chopper on the previous day , alarmed the worthy clerk not a little . In was inclosed to him , and as he opened the letter he trembled lest the dinner should be put off on which he was calculating . His mind was inexpressibly relieved when he found that the envelope was only a reminder for himself . ( “
119478	119652	119468	119468	I	0	” Captain Dobbin wrote . ) He was very much interested about his employer ’s family ; but , que voulez - vous ? a grand dinner was of more concern to him than the affairs of any other mortal . Dobbin was quite justified in repeating the General ’s information to any officers of the regiment whom he should see in the course of his peregrinations ; accordingly he imparted it to Ensign Stubble , whom he met at the agent ’s , and who — such was his military ardour — went off instantly to purchase a new sword at the accoutrement - maker ’s . Here this fellow , who , though only seventeen years of age , and about sixty - five inches high , with a constitution naturally rickety and much impaired by premature brandy and water , had an undoubted courage and a lion ’s heart , poised , tried , bent , and balanced a weapon such as he thought would do execution amongst Frenchmen . Shouting “
119657	119891	119468	119468	I	0	” and stamping his little feet with tremendous energy , he delivered the point twice or thrice at Captain Dobbin , who parried the thrust laughingly with his bamboo walking - stick . Mr. Stubble , as may be supposed from his size and slenderness , was of the Light Bobs . Ensign Spooney , on the contrary was a tall youth , and belonged to ( Captain Dobbin ’s ) the Grenadier Company , and he tried on a new bearskin cap , under which he looked savage beyond his years . Then these two lads went off to the Slaughters ’ and having ordered a famous dinner , sat down and wrote off letters to the kind anxious parents at home — letters full of love and heartiness , and pluck and bad spelling . Ah ! there were many anxious hearts beating through England at that time ; and mothers ’ prayers and tears flowing in many homesteads . Seeing young Stubble engaged in composition at one of the coffee - room tables at the Slaughters ’ , and the tears trickling down his nose on to the paper ( for the youngster was thinking of his mamma , and that he might never see her again , ) Dobbin , who was going to write off a letter to George Osborne , relented , and locked up his desk . “
119896	119900	119894	119894	I	0	” said he . “
119930	120011	120015	120015	Dobbin	752	” So he went up and laid his big hand on young Stubble ’s shoulder , and backed up that young champion , and told him if he would leave off brandy and water he would be a good soldier , as he always was a gentlemanly good - hearted fellow . Young Stubble ’s eyes brightened up at this , for Dobbin was greatly respected in the regiment , as the best officer and the cleverest man in it . “
120017	120028	120015	120015	Dobbin	752	” he said , rubbing his eyes with his knuckles , “
120052	120560	120044	120044	she	5074	” The water pumps were at work again , and I am not sure that the soft - hearted Captain ’s eyes did not also twinkle . The two ensigns , the Captain , and Mr. Chopper , dined together in the same box . Chopper brought the letter from Mr. Osborne , in which the letter briefly presented his compliments to Captain Dobbin , and requested him to forward the inclosed to Captain George Osborne . Chopper knew nothing further ; he described Mr. Osborne ’s appearance , it is true , and his interview with his lawyer , wondered how the governor had sworn at nobody , and — especially as the wine circled round — abounded in speculations and conjectures . But these grew more vague with every glass , and at length became perfectly unintelligible . At a late hour Captain Dobbin put his guest into a hackney coach , in a hiccupping state , and swearing that he would be the kick — the kick — Captain ’s friend for ever and ever . When Captain Dobbin took leave of Miss Osborne we have said that he asked leave to come and pay her another visit , and the spinster expected him for some hours the next day , when , perhaps , had he come , and had he asked her that question which she was prepared to answer , she would have declared herself as her brother ’s friend , and a reconciliation might have been effected between George and his angry father . But though she waited at home the Captain never came . He had his own affairs to pursue ; his own parents to visit and console ; and at an early hour of the day to take his place on the Lightning coach , and go down to his friends at Brighton . In the course of the day Miss Osborne heard her father give orders that that meddling scoundrel , Captain Dobbin , should never be admitted within his doors again , and any hopes in which she may have indulged privately were thus abruptly brought to an end . Mr. Frederick Bullock came , and was particularly affectionate to Maria , and attentive to the broken - spirited old gentleman . For though he said his mind would be easy , the means which he had taken to secure quiet did not seem to have succeeded as yet , and the events of the past two days had visibly shattered him . CONDUCTED to the ladies , at the Ship Inn , Dobbin assumed a jovial and rattling manner , which proved that this young officer was becoming a more consummate hypocrite every day of his life . He was trying to hide his own private feelings , first upon seeing Mrs. George Osborne in her new condition , and secondly to mask the apprehensions he entertained as to the effect which the dismal news brought down by him would certainly have upon her . “
120568	120572	120566	120566	George	657	” he said , “
120668	121219	120664	120666	ladies of fashion	5084	” So it was agreed to represent the duty of the British army in Belgium in this harmless light to Amelia . This plot being arranged , the hypocritical Dobbin saluted Mrs. George Osborne quite gaily , tried to pay her one or two compliments relative to her new position as a bride ( which compliments , it must be confessed , were exceedingly clumsy and hung fire woefully ) , and then fell to talking about Brighton , and the sea - air , and the gaieties of the place , and the beauties of the road and the merits of the Lightning coach and horses,—all in a manner quite incomprehensible to Amelia , and very amusing to Rebecca , who was watching the Captain , as indeed she watched every one near whom she came . Little Amelia , it must be owned , had rather a mean opinion of her husband ’s friend , Captain Dobbin . He lisped — he was very plain and homely - lookin and exceedingly awkward and ungainly . She liked him for his attachment to her husband ( to be sure there was very little merit in that ) , and she thought George was most generous and kind in extending his friendship to his brother officer . George had mimicked Dobbin ’s lisp and queer manners many times to her , though to do him justice , he always spoke most highly of his friend ’s good qualities . In her little day of triumph , and not knowing him intimately as yet , she made light of honest William — and he knew her opinions of him quite well , and acquiesced in them very humbly . A time came when she knew him better , and changed her notions regarding him ; but that was distant as yet . As for Rebecca , Captain Dobbin had not been two hours in the ladies ’ company before she understood his secret perfectly . She did not like him , and feared him privately ; nor was he very much prepossessed in her favour . He was so honest , that her arts and cajoleries did not affect him , and he shrank from her with instinctive repulsion . And , as she was by no means so far superior to her sex as to be above jealousy , she disliked him the more for his adoration of Amelia . Nevertheless , she was very respectful and cordial in her manner towards him . A friend to the Osbornes ! a friend to her dearest benefactors ! She vowed she should always love him sincerely : she remembered him quite well on the Vauxhall night , as she told Amelia archly , and she made a little fun of him when the two ladies went to dress for dinner . Rawdon Crawley paid scarcely any attention to Dobbin , looking upon him as a good - natured nincompoop , an underbred City man . Jos patronised him with much dignity . When George and Dobbin were alone in the latter ’s room , to which George had followed him , Dobbin took from his desk the letter which he had been charged by Mr. Osborne to deliver to his son . “
121231	121259	121260	121260	SIR	15428	” said George , looking rather alarmed ; nor was it : the letter was from Mr. Osborne ’s lawyer , and to the following effect : — “
121320	121468	121471	121471	Osborne	709	“ Although the monies expended upon you in your minority , and the bills which you have drawn upon him so unsparingly of late years , far exceed in amount the sum to which you are entitled in your own right ( being the third part of the fortune of your mother , the late Mrs. Osborne and which reverted to you at her decease , and to Miss Jane Osborne and Miss Maria Frances Osborne ) ; yet I am instructed by Mr. Osborne to say , that he waives all claim upon your estate , and that the sum of 2,000l . 4 per cent . annuities , at the value of the day ( being your one - third share of the sum of 6,000l . ) , shall be paid over to yourself or your agents upon your receipt for the same , by “
121502	121503	121504	121504	SIR	15428	” “
121564	121712	121715	121715	Osborne	709	“ Although the monies expended upon you in your minority , and the bills which you have drawn upon him so unsparingly of late years , far exceed in amount the sum to which you are entitled in your own right ( being the third part of the fortune of your mother , the late Mrs. Osborne and which reverted to you at her decease , and to Miss Jane Osborne and Miss Maria Frances Osborne ) ; yet I am instructed by Mr. Osborne to say , that he waives all claim upon your estate , and that the sum of 2,000l . 4 per cent . annuities , at the value of the day ( being your one - third share of the sum of 6,000l . ) , shall be paid over to yourself or your agents upon your receipt for the same , by “
121746	121747	121751	121751	you	5093	” “
121757	121767	121751	121751	you	5093	” said George , looking savagely at William Dobbin . “
121773	121786	121787	121788	A beggar	4520	” and he flung over to the latter his parent ’s letter . “
121916	121917	121911	121911	you	5093	” “
121930	121944	121947	121947	you	5093	” Dobbin replied , after reading over the letter with a blank countenance ; “
121969	121978	121959	121967	some men who would n’t mind changing with you	5099	” he added , with a bitter smile . “
122020	122021	122011	122011	you	5093	” “
122041	122049	122023	122023	you	5093	” George cried out in great anger . “
122134	122135	122113	122113	you	5093	” “
122140	122149	122113	122113	you	5093	” said Dobbin , still good - naturedly , “
122211	122212	122204	122206	the old father	5115	” “
122218	122222	122204	122206	the old father	5115	” George answered . “
122248	122249	122250	122250	Psha	1142	” “
122265	122269	122250	122250	Psha	1142	” Dobbin said . “
122305	122359	122360	122360	I	0	” he added , with a smile . Whereupon the dispute ended — as many scores of such conversations between Osborne and his friend had concluded previously — by the former declaring there was no possibility of being angry with Dobbin long , and forgiving him very generously after abusing him without cause . “
122365	122391	122360	122360	I	0	” cried Rawdon Crawley out of his dressing - room , to his lady , who was attiring herself for dinner in her own chamber . “
122394	122449	122450	122450	I	0	” said Becky ’s shrill voice . She was looking over her shoulder in the glass . She had put on the neatest and freshest white frock imaginable , and with bare shoulders and a little necklace , and a light blue sash , she looked the image of youthful innocence and girlish happiness . “
122467	122503	122460	122460	O.	1143	” Crawley said coming into the room , performing a duet on his head with two huge hair - brushes , and looking out from under his hair with admiration on his pretty little wife . “
122513	122517	122506	122506	she	1143	” Becky answered . “
122540	122549	122550	122550	Rawdon	870	” You do n’t care , I suppose ? ”
122563	122579	122580	122580	Becky	630	“ You wretch ! do n’t you know that I intend to go with you , ”
122583	122610	122611	122612	Mrs. Crawley	820	“ Besides , you ’re different . You go as General Tufo ’s aide - de - camp . We do n’t belong to the line , ”
122635	122656	122657	122657	Becky	630	“ Rawdon dear — don’t you think — you’d better get that — money from Cupid , before he goes ? ”
123273	123288	123289	123289	George	709	“ Gad , what a fine night , and how bright the moon is ! ”
123305	123341	123342	123342	Becky	630	“ How delicious they smell in the open air ! I adore them . Who ’d think the moon was two hundred and thirty - six thousand eight hundred and forty - seven miles off ? ”
123353	123397	123342	123342	Becky	630	“ Is n’t it clever of me to remember that ? Pooh ! we learned it all at Miss Pinkerton ’s ! How calm the sea is , and how clear everything . I declare I can almost see the coast of France ! ”
123419	123431	123432	123432	she	630	“ Do you know what I intend to do one morning ? ”
123435	123507	123432	123432	she	630	“ I find I can swim beautifully , and some day , when my Aunt Crawley ’s companion — old Briggs , you know — you remember her — that hook - nosed woman , with the long wisps of hair — when Briggs goes out to bathe , I intend to dive under her awning , and insist on a reconciliation in the water . Is n’t that a stratagem ? ”
123520	123530	123531	123531	Rawdon	870	“ What ’s the row there , you two ? ”
124020	124092	124094	124094	he	1147	“ No , Emmy ; it is n’t that : it ’s not myself I care about : it ’s you . I have had bad news from my father . He refuses any communication with me ; he has flung us off ; and leaves us to poverty . I can rough it well enough ; but you , my dear , how will you bear it ? read here . ”
124229	124250	124207	124207	she	632	“ O , George , how your poor heart must bleed at the idea of being separated from your papa ! ”
124251	124255	124257	124257	George	709	“ It does , ”
124264	124275	124276	124276	she	632	“ But he ca n’t be angry with you long , ”
124279	124310	124276	124276	she	632	“ Nobody could , I ’m sure . He must forgive you , my dearest , kindest husband . O , I shall never forgive myself if he does not . ”
124311	124328	124329	124329	George	709	“ What vexes me , my poor Emmy , is not my misfortune , but yours , ”
124332	124359	124329	124329	George	709	“ I do n’t care for a little poverty ; and I think , without vanity , I ’ve talents enough to make my own way . ”
124360	124365	124367	124368	his wife	2212	“ That you have , ”
124387	124400	124401	124401	Osborne	709	“ Yes , I shall make my way as well as another , ”
124405	124466	124401	124401	Osborne	709	“ but you , my dear girl , how can I bear your being deprived of the comforts and station in society which my wife had a right to expect ? My dearest girl in barracks ; the wife of a soldier in a marching regiment ; subject to all sorts of annoyance and privation ! It makes me miserable . ”
124505	124510	124513	124514	the heroine	5180	“ Wapping Old Stairs , ”
124524	124537	124513	124514	the heroine	5180	“ his trowsers to mend , and his grog too to make , ”
124551	124554	124555	124555	she	677	“ Besides , ”
124576	124590	124555	124555	she	677	“ is n’t two thousand pounds an immense deal of money , George ? ”

124823	124835	124815	124815	Amelia	632	“ Is the regiment ordered away , George,—is it ordered away ? ”
124857	124865	124866	124866	he	709	“ Do n’t be afraid , dear , ”
124872	124896	124866	124866	he	709	“ it is but a twelve hours ’ passage . It wo n’t hurt you . You shall go , too , Emmy . ”
124897	124903	124905	124905	Becky	630	“ I intend to go , ”
124907	124929	124905	124905	Becky	630	“ I ’m on the staff . General Tufto is a great flirt of mine . Is n’t he , Rawdon ? ”
124945	124951	124952	124952	he	709	“ She ca n’t go , ”
124955	124964	124952	124952	he	709	“ think of the — of the danger , ”
124995	125002	124988	124988	He	709	“ I must and will go , ”
125050	125060	125061	125061	he	709	“ We ’ll have Mrs. O’Dowd to chaperon you , ”
125300	125304	125305	125305	she	630	“ Great news , ”
125308	125336	125305	125305	she	630	“ Mrs. Bute is gone . Get the money from Cupid to - night , as he ’ll be off to - morrow most likely . Mind this.—R. ”
125364	125388	125353	125353	Rawdon	870	“ I say , Osborne , my boy , if quite convenient , I ’ll trouble you for that ’ ere small trifle . ”
125828	125839	125840	125841	Captain Rawdon	870	“ We might as well be in London as here , ”
125850	125867	125868	125869	his wife	2212	“ A comfortable inn in Brighton is better than a spunging - house in Chancery Lane , ”
125880	125934	125868	125869	his wife	2212	“ Think of those two aides - de - camp of Mr. Moses , the sheriff ’s officer , who watched our lodging for a week . Our friends here are very stupid , but Mr. Jos and Captain Cupid are better companions than Mr. Moses ’s men , Rawdon , my love . ”
125935	125947	125948	125948	Rawdon	870	“ I wonder the writs have n’t followed me down here , ”
125954	125969	125971	125973	dauntless little Becky	630	“ When they do , we ’ll find means to give them the slip , ”
126009	126021	126023	126024	the Guardsman	5225	“ It will hardly be enough to pay the inn bill , ”
126026	126033	126035	126036	the lady	2536	“ Why need we pay it ? ”
126386	126398	126384	126384	Firkin	883	“ my poor Missus du take her physic like a lamb . ”
126481	126490	126491	126491	Firkin	883	“ She ’s no spirit left in her , ”

127380	127470	127471	127471	Rebecca	630	“ I shall never cease to love her , and I would devote my life to her service . As my own benefactress , as my beloved Rawdon ’s adored relative , I love and admire Miss Crawley , dear Miss Briggs , beyond any woman in the world , and next to her I love all those who are faithful to her . I would never have treated Miss Crawley ’s faithful friends as that odious designing Mrs. Bute has done . Rawdon , who was all heart , ”
127474	127592	127593	127593	she	5296	“ although his outward manners might seem rough and careless , had said a hundred times , with tears in his eyes , that he blessed Heaven for sending his dearest Aunty two such admirable nurses as her attached Firkin and her admirable Miss Briggs . Should the Machinations of the horrible Mrs. Bute end , as she too much feared they would , in banishing everybody that Miss Crawley loved from her side , and leaving that poor lady a victim to those harpies at the Rectory , Rebecca besought her ( Miss Briggs ) to remember that her own home , humble as it was , was always open to receive Briggs . Dear friend , ”
127602	127625	127626	127626	Rebecca	630	“ some hearts can never forget benefits ; all women are not Bute Crawleys ! Though why should I complain of her , ”
127629	127653	127626	127626	Rebecca	630	“ though I have been her tool and the victim to her arts , do I not owe my dearest Rawdon to her ? ”
128117	128164	128100	128100	She	630	“ You will now , if you please , my dear , sit down at the writing - table and pen me a pretty little letter to Miss Crawley , in which you say that you are a good boy , and that sort of thing . ”
128174	128179	128166	128166	Rawdon	794	“ Brighton , Thursday , ”
128181	128186	128166	128166	Rawdon	794	“ My dear Aunt , ”
128255	128272	128241	128243	the little woman	16977	“ Before quitting the country and commencing a campaign , which very possibly may be fatal , ”
128273	128276	128278	128278	Rawdon	794	“ What ? ”
128300	128313	128278	128278	Rawdon	794	“ Which very possibly may be fatal , I have come hither — ”
128314	128328	128329	128330	the dragoon	16309	“ Why not say come here , Becky ? come here ’s grammar , ”
128333	128339	128340	128340	Rebecca	630	“ I have come hither , ”
128350	128393	128340	128340	Rebecca	630	“ to say farewell to my dearest and earliest friend . I beseech you before I go , not perhaps to return , once more to let me press the hand from which I have received nothing but kindnesses all my life . ”
128394	128400	128402	128402	Rawdon	794	“ Kindnesses all my life , ”
128419	128465	128413	128413	his	2573	“ I ask nothing from you but that we should part not in anger . I have the pride of my family on some points , though not on all . I married a painter ’s daughter , and am not ashamed of the union . ”
128466	128478	128479	128479	Rawdon	794	“ No , run me through the body if I am ! ”
128482	128487	128488	128488	Rebecca	630	“ You old booby , ”

128552	128686	128549	128549	Rebecca	630	“ I knew that Mrs. Bute Crawley confirmed and encouraged it . But I make no reproaches . I married a poor woman , and am content to abide by what I have done . Leave your property , dear Aunt , as you will . I shall never complain of the way in which you dispose of it . I would have you believe that I love you for yourself , and not for money ’s sake . I want to be reconciled to you ere I leave England . Let me , let me see you before I go . A few weeks or months hence it may to too late , and I can not bear the notion of quitting the country without a kind word of farewell from you . ”
128687	128697	128699	128699	Becky	630	“ She wo n’t recognise my style in that , ”
128701	128713	128699	128699	Becky	630	“ I have made the sentences short and brisk on purpose . ”
128746	128757	128758	128758	she	839	“ We may read it now Mrs. Bute is away , ”
128761	128769	128758	128758	she	839	“ Read it to me , Briggs . ”
128783	128792	128793	128793	she	839	“ Do n’t you see , you goose , ”
128813	128868	128793	128793	she	839	“ Do n’t you see that Rawdon never wrote a word of it . He never wrote to me without asking for money in his life , and all his letters are full of bad spelling , and dashes and bad grammar . It is that little serpent of a governess who rules him . ”
128894	128902	128903	128903	she	839	“ I do n’t mind seeing Rawdon , ”
128918	128974	128903	128903	she	839	“ I had just as soon shake hands with him as not . Provided there is no scene , why should n’t we meet ? I do n’t mind . But human patience has its limits ; and mind , my dear , I respectfully decline to receive Mrs. Rawdon — I ca n’t support that quite”—and
129148	129161	129162	129162	he	5327	“ The old girl has always acted like a trump to me , ”
129174	129232	129162	129162	he	5327	“ and I felt , you know , rather queer , and that sort of thing . I walked by the side of the what - dy’e - call-’em , you know , and to her own door , where Bowls came to help her in . And I wanted to go in very much . only — ”
129233	129242	129244	129245	his wife	2212	“ You did n’t go in , Rawdon ! ”
129247	129268	129244	129245	his wife	2212	“ No , my dear ; I ’m hanged if I was n’t afraid when it came to the point . ”
129269	129286	129287	129287	Rebecca	630	“ You fool ! you ought to have gone in , and never come out again , ”

129348	129380	129381	129381	Rebecca	630	“ Well , dearest , to - morrow you must be on the look - out , and go and see her , mind , whether she asks you or no , ”
129525	129536	129537	129537	she	839	“ Rawdon is getting very fat and old , Briggs , ”
129543	129600	129537	129537	she	839	“ His nose has become red , and he is exceedingly coarse in appearance . His marriage to that woman has hopelessly vulgarised him . Mrs. Bute always said they drank together ; and I have no doubt they do . Yes : he smelt of gin abominably . I remarked it . Did n’t you ? ”
129630	129667	129606	129607	Mrs. Bute	820	“ An artful , designing woman ? Yes , so she is , and she does speak ill of every one,—but I am certain that woman has made Rawdon drink . All those low people do — ”
129668	129680	129681	129682	the companion	17916	“ He was very much affected at seeing you , ma’am , ”
129685	129704	129681	129682	the companion	17916	“ and I am sure , when you remember that he is going to the field of danger — ”

129828	129985	129824	129826	Mrs. Bute Crawley	820	“ Begin ‘ My dear sir , ’ or , ‘ Dear sir , ’ that will be better , and say you are desired by Miss Crawley — no , by Miss Crawley ’s medical man , by Mr. Creamer , to state , that my health is such that all strong emotions would be dangerous in my present delicate condition — and that I must decline any family discussions or interviews whatever . And thank him for coming to Brighton , and so forth , and beg him not to stay any longer on my account . And , Miss Briggs , you may add that I wish him a bon voyage , and that if he will take the trouble to call upon my lawyers in Gray ’s Inn Square , he will find there a communication for him . Yes , that will do ; and that will make him leave Brighton . ”
129997	130011	130012	130014	the old lady	2255	“ To seize upon me the very day after Mrs. Bute was gone , ”
130018	130083	130012	130014	the old lady	2255	“ it was too indecent . Briggs , my dear , write to Mrs. Crawley , and say she need n’t come back . No — she needn’t — and she shan’t — and I wo n’t be a slave in my own house — and I wo n’t be starved and choked with poison . They all want to kill me — all — all”—and
130306	130320	130321	130321	Rawdon	870	“ I should have liked to see the old girl before we went , ”

I say , make Sedley cut off his moustache . What the devil does a civilian mean with a moustache and those infernal frogs to his coat ? By - bye . Try and come on Tuesday ; ”
143901	143914	143916	143916	he	3926	“ I will go in and pay my respects to your wife , ”
143923	143930	143920	143920	Rawdon	870	“ Hm , as you please , ”
143970	143973	143946	143946	George	657	“ Entrez , ”
144048	144054	144056	144057	little Rebecca	630	“ My dear Captain George ! ”
144062	144097	144056	144057	little Rebecca	630	“ How good of you to come . The general and I were moping together tâte - é - tâte . General , this is my Captain George of whom you heard me talk . ”
144098	144101	144103	144104	the General	3926	“ Indeed , ”
144112	144120	144103	144104	the General	3926	“ of what regiment is Captain George ? ”
144141	144166	144130	144130	he	1045	“ Come home lately from the West Indies , I believe . Not seen much service in the late war . Quartered here , Captain George?”—the
144174	144186	144187	144187	Rebecca	630	“ Not Captain George , you stupid man ; Captain Osborne , ”
144204	144218	144190	144191	The General	3926	“ Captain Osborne , indeed ! Any relation to the L — Osbornes ? ”
144219	144226	144227	144227	George	1045	“ We bear the same arms , ”
144335	144404	144330	144330	She	630	“ How is dearest Amelia ? But I need n’t ask : how pretty she looks ! And who is that nice good - natured looking creature with her — a flame of yours ? O , you wicked man ! And there is Mr. Sedley eating ice , I declare : how he seems to enjoy it ! General , why have we not had any ices ? ”
144405	144414	144416	144417	the General	3926	“ Shall I go and fetch you some ? ”
144422	144431	144432	144432	George	709	“ Let me go , I entreat you , ”
144435	144459	144432	144432	George	709	“ No , I will go to Amelia ’s box . Dear , sweet girl ! Give me your arm , Captain George ; ”
144499	144519	144478	144478	She	6088	“ Do n’t you see the state of affairs , and what a fool I ’m making of him ? ”
144862	144870	144871	144873	honest old Dobbin	752	“ What a humbug that woman is ! ”
144907	144942	144888	144888	he	1045	“ She writhes and twists about like a snake . All the time she was here , did n’t you see , George , how she was acting at the General over the way ? ”
144943	144960	144961	144961	George	1045	“ Humbug — acting ! Hang it , she ’s the nicest little woman in England , ”
144977	145034	144961	144961	George	1045	“ You ai n’t a man of the world , Dobbin . Dammy , look at her now , she ’s talked over Tufto in no time . Look how he ’s laughing ! Gad , what a shoulder she has ! Emmy , why did n’t you have a bouquet ? Everybody has a bouquet . ”
145035	145047	145048	145049	Mrs. O’Dowd	937	“ Faith , then , why did n’t you boy one ? ”
145117	145141	145142	145142	Dobbin	752	“ When do you intend to give up play , George , as you have promised me , any time these hundred years ? ”
145157	145167	145169	145170	the other	15526	“ When do you intend to give up sermonising ? ”
145174	145219	145169	145170	the other	15526	“ What the deuce , man , are you alarmed about ? We play low ; I won last night . You do n’t suppose Crawley cheats ? With fair play it comes to pretty much the same thing at the year ’s end . ”
145220	145233	145234	145234	Dobbin	752	“ But I do n’t think he could pay if he lost , ”
145437	145460	145461	145461	Rebecca	630	“ I think Emmy has become prouder since her father ’s name was in the — , since Mr. Sedley ’s misfortunes , ”
145473	145569	145570	145571	Mrs. Rawdon	794	“ Upon my word , I thought when we were at Brighton she was doing me the honour to be jealous of me ; and now I suppose she is scandalised because Rawdon , and I , and the General live together . Why my dear creature , how could we , with our means , live at all , but for a friend to share expenses ? And do you suppose that Rawdon is not big enough to take care of my honour ? But I ’m very much obliged to Emmy , very , ”
145574	145579	145581	145581	George	1045	“ Pooh , jealousy ! ”
145583	145589	145581	145581	George	1045	“ all women are jealous . ”
145590	145649	145650	145650	Crawley	794	“ And all men too . Were n’t you jealous of General Tufto , and the General of you , on the night of the Opera ? Why , he was ready to eat me for going with you to visit that foolish little wife of yours ; as if I care a pin for either of you , ”
145663	145701	145660	145660	her	6129	“ Will you dine here ? The dragon dines with the Commander - in - Chief . Great news is stirring . They say the French have crossed the frontier . We shall have a quiet dinner . ”
147142	147156	147157	147157	she	630	“ For God ’s sake , stop him from gambling , my dear , ”
147160	147291	147157	147157	she	630	“ or he will ruin himself . He and Rawdon are playing at cards every night , and you know he is very poor , and Rawdon will win every shilling from him if he does not take care . Why do n’t you prevent him , you little careless creature ? Why do n’t you come to us of an evening , instead of moping at home with that Captain Dobbin . I dare say he is très aimable ; how could one love a man with feet of such size ? Your husband ’s feet are darlings - Here he comes . Where have you been , wretch ? Here is Emmy crying her eyes out for you . Are you coming to fetch me for the quadrille ? ”
147474	147499	147500	147500	Dobbin	752	“ It is curious , when a man is bent upon play , by what clumsy rogues he will allow himself to be cheated , ”
147507	147510	147504	147504	Emmy	677	“ Indeed . ”
147863	147866	147867	147867	she	630	“ William , ”
147880	147900	147867	147867	she	630	“ you ’ve always been very kind to me — I’m — I’m not well . Take me home . ”

148154	148181	148183	148183	he	752	“ Hullo , Dob ! Come and drink , old Dob ! The Duke ’s wine is famous . Give me some more , you sir ; ”
148193	148199	148201	148201	Dobbin	752	“ Come out , George , ”
148206	148211	148201	148201	Dobbin	752	“ do n’t drink . ”
148212	148239	148240	148240	Dobbin	752	“ Drink ! there ’s nothing like it . Drink yourself , and light up your lantern jaws , old boy . Here ’s to you . ”

148294	148313	148291	148291	William	752	“ and our left is already engaged . Come away . We are to march in three hours . ”

149211	149236	149202	149202	he	18559	“ that there will be such a ball danced in a day or two as some of ’em has never heard the chune of ; ”
149304	149320	149321	149322	the Major	18559	“ I ’d like ye wake me about half an hour before the assembly beats , ”

149418	149424	149425	149425	she	6286	“ Time enough for that , ”
149428	149434	149425	149425	she	6286	“ when Mick ’s gone ; ”

But since I ’m married , except renewing , of course , I give you my honour I ’ve not touched a bit of stamped paper . ”
150321	150328	150329	150329	she	982	“ Why , my stupid love , ”
150333	150397	150329	150329	she	982	“ we have not done with your aunt yet . If she fails us , is n’t there what you call the Gazette ? or , stop , when your uncle Bute ’s life drops , I have another scheme . The living has always belonged to the younger brother , and why should n’t you sell out and go into the Church ? ”
150526	150541	150542	150542	he	870	“ You do n’t suppose I ’m afraid , Becky , I should think , ”
150552	150610	150542	150542	he	870	“ But I ’m a pretty good mark for a shot , and you see if it brings me down , why I leave one and perhaps two behind me whom I should wish to provide for , as I brought ’em into the scrape . It is no laughing matter that , Mrs. C. , anyways . ”
150677	150681	150682	150682	she	982	“ Dearest love , ”

150722	150956	150957	150957	Rawdon	870	“ If I drop , let us see what there is for you . I have had a pretty good run of luck here , and here ’s two hundred and thirty pounds . I have got ten Napoleons in my pocket . That is as much as I shall want ; for the General pays everything like a prince ; and if I ’m hit , why , you know I cost nothing . Do n’t cry , little woman ; I may live to vex you yet . Well , I sha n’t take either of my horses , but shall ride the General ’s grey charger : it ’s cheaper , and I told him mine was lame . If I ’m done , those two ought to fetch you something . Grigg offered ninety for the mare yesterday , before this confounded news came , and like a fool I would n’t let her go under the two o ’s . Bullfinch will fetch his price any day , only you ’d better sell him in this country , because the dealers have so many bills of mine , and so I ’d rather he should n’t go back to England . Your little mare the General gave you will fetch something , and there ’s no d — d livery stable bills here as there are in London , ”
150964	151117	150957	150957	Rawdon	870	“ There ’s that dressing - case cost me two hundred,—that is , I owe two for it ; and the gold tops and bottles must be worth thirty or forty . Please to put that up the spout , ma’am , with my pins , and rings , and watch and chain , and things . They cost a precious lot of money . Miss Crawley , I know , paid a hundred down for the chain and ticker . Gold tops and bottles , indeed ! dammy , I ’m sorry I did n’t take more now . Edwards pressed on me a silver - gilt boot - jack , and I might have had a dressing - case fitted up with a silver warming - pan , and a service of plate . But we must make the best of what we ’ve got , Becky , you know . ”

152500	152533	152492	152492	Dobbin	752	“ because you know some of us may n’t come back again , and I like to see you all well , and — and that sort of thing , you know . ”

152667	152676	152677	152678	the Captain	2862	“ I tell you what you can do , ”
152687	152847	152677	152678	the Captain	2862	“ we march in a quarter of an hour , Sedley , and neither George nor I may ever come back . Mind you , you are not to stir from this town until you ascertain how things go . You are to stay here and watch over your sister , and comfort her , and see that no harm comes to her . If anything happens to George , remember she has no one but you in the world to look to . If it goes wrong with the army , you ’ll see her safe back to England ; and you will promise me on your word that you will never desert her . I know you wo n’t : as far as money goes , you were always free enough with that . Do you want any ? I mean , have you enough gold to take you back to England in case of a misfortune ? ”
152848	152851	152853	152853	Jos	674	“ Sir , ”
152857	152890	152853	152853	Jos	674	“ when I want money , I know where to ask for it . And as for my sister , you need n’t tell me how I ought to behave to her . ”

152950	152957	152959	152960	Mr. Jos	674	“ Of course , of course , ”
152972	152989	152967	152967	Dobbin	752	“ And you ’ll see her safe out of Brussels in the event of a defeat ? ”

154977	155012	154961	154961	he	674	“ I long for sleeve - buttons ; and the Captain ’s boots with brass spurs , in the next room , corbleu ! what an effect they will make in the Allée Verte ! ”

Then , as after Austerlitz , as after Wagram , we were too generous . We believed in the oaths and promises of princes whom we suffered to remain upon their thrones . Let us march once more to meet them . We and they , are we not still the same men ? Soldiers ! these same Prussians who are so arrogant to - day , were three to one against you at Jena , and six to one at Montmirail . Those among you who were prisoners in England can tell their comrades what frightful torments they suffered on board the English hulks . Madmen ! a moment of prosperity has blinded them , and if they enter into France it will be to find a grave there ! ”

They were six to one at Montmirail , and he scattered them like sheep . The Austrian army is coming , but with the Express and the King of Rome at its head ; and the Russians , bah ! the Russians will withdraw . No quarter is to be given to the English , on account of their cruelty to our braves on board the infamous pontoons . Look here , here it is in black and white . Here ’s the proclamation of his Majesty the Emperor and King , ”

156545	156548	156549	156549	Jos	674	“ Tremendous , ”
156552	156559	156561	156562	the lady	2536	“ You men can bear anything , ”
156564	156646	156561	156562	the lady	2536	“ Parting or danger are nothing to you . Own now that you were going to join the army and leave us to our fate . I know you were — something tells me you were . I was so frightened , when the thought came into my head ( for I do sometimes think of you when I am alone , Mr. Joseph ) , that I ran off immediately to beg and entreat you not to fly from us . ”
156653	156687	156688	156688	I	0	“ My dear sir , should an accident befall the army , and a retreat be necessary , you have a very comfortable carriage , in which I propose to take a seat . ”
156784	156787	156789	156789	Jos	674	“ Ah ! ”
156791	156817	156789	156789	Jos	674	“ now she wants me she comes to me . When there is nobody else in the way she can think about old Joseph Sedley ! ”
156848	156857	156858	156858	he	674	“ I should like to see the action , ”
156861	156888	156858	156858	he	674	“ Every man of any spirit would , you know . I ’ve seen a little service in India , but nothing on this grand scale . ”
156889	156900	156901	156901	Rebecca	982	“ You men would sacrifice any thing for a pleasure , ”
156904	157043	156901	156901	Rebecca	982	“ Captain Crawley left me this morning as gay as if he were going to a hunting party . What does he care ? What do any of you care for the agonies and tortures of a poor forsaken woman ? ( I wonder whether he could really have been going to the troops , this great lazy gourmand ? ) Oh ! dear Mr. Sedley , I have come to you for comfort — for consolation . I have been on my knees all the morning . I tremble at the frightful danger into which our husbands , our friends , our brave troops and allies , are rushing . And I come here for shelter , and find another of my friends — the last remaining to me — bent upon plunging into the dreadful scene ! ”
157044	157049	157050	157050	Jos	674	“ My dear madam , ”
157060	157099	157101	157101	he	674	“ do n’t be alarmed . I only said I should like to go — what Briton would not ? But my duty keeps me here : I ca n’t leave that poor creature in the next room . ”
157117	157122	157123	157123	Rebecca	982	“ Good noble brother ! ”
157147	157166	157123	157123	Rebecca	982	“ I have done you injustice ; you have got a heart . I thought you had not . ”
157167	157174	157183	157183	he	674	“ O , upon my honour ! ”
157194	157209	157183	157183	he	674	“ You do me injustice , indeed you do — my dear Mrs. Crawley . ”
157210	157237	157238	157238	Rebecca	982	“ I do , now your heart is true to your sister . But I remember two years ago — when it was false to me ! ”
157333	157341	157342	157342	Rebecca	982	“ I know you think me ungrateful , ”
157366	157461	157342	157342	Rebecca	982	“ Your coldness , your averted looks , your manner when we have met of late — when I came in just now , all proved it to me . But were there no reasons why I should avoid you ? Let your own heart answer that question . Do you think my husband was too much inclined to welcome you ? The only unkind words I have ever had from him ( I will do Captain Crawley that justice ) have been about you — and most cruel , cruel words they were . ”
157462	157471	157473	157473	Jos	674	“ Good gracious ! what have I done ? ”
157482	157493	157342	157342	Rebecca	982	“ what have I done — to — to — ? ”
157494	157499	157501	157501	Rebecca	982	“ Is jealousy nothing ? ”
157503	157537	157501	157501	Rebecca	982	“ He makes me miserable about you . And whatever it might have been once — my heart is all his . I am innocent now . Am I not , Mr. Sedley ? ”
157600	157609	157610	157610	Becky	982	“ If the worst comes to the worst , ”
157613	157631	157610	157610	Becky	982	“ my retreat is secure ; and I have a right - hand seat in the barouche . ”
157721	157725	157726	157726	she	982	“ Au revoir . ”
157773	157782	157783	157783	Isidor	1198	“ That coat is very tight for Milor , ”
158112	158121	158122	158123	the visitor	6589	“ Dearest Amelia , you are very unwell , ”
158135	158151	158122	158123	the visitor	6589	“ What is it ? I could not rest until I knew how you were . ”
158194	158202	158203	158203	she	982	“ Why are you here , Rebecca ? ”
158222	158236	158237	158237	Rebecca	982	“ She must have seen him give me the letter at the ball , ”
158240	158249	158250	158250	she	982	“ Do n’t be agitated , dear Amelia , ”
158256	158271	158250	158250	she	982	“ I came but to see if I could — if you were well . ”
158272	158277	158279	158279	Amelia	632	“ Are you well ? ”
158280	158317	158279	158279	Amelia	632	“ I dare say you are . You do n’t love your husband . You would not be here if you did . Tell me , Rebecca , did I ever do you anything but kindness ? ”
158318	158325	158326	158327	the other	15526	“ Indeed , Amelia , no , ”
158336	158479	158326	158327	the other	15526	“ When you were quite poor , who was it that befriended you ? Was I not a sister to you ? You saw us all in happier days before he married me . I was all in all then to him ; or would he have given up his fortune , his family , as he nobly did to make me happy ? Why did you come between my love and me ? Who sent you to separate those whom God joined , and take my darling ’s heart from me — my own husband ? Do you think you could love him as I did ? His love was everything to me . You knew it , and wanted to rob me of it . For shame , Rebecca ; bad and wicked woman — false friend and false wife . ”
158480	158496	158497	158497	Rebecca	982	“ Amelia , I protest before God , I have done my husband no wrong , ”
158504	158531	158497	158497	Rebecca	982	“ Have you done me no wrong , Rebecca ? You did not succeed , but you tried . Ask your heart if you did not . ”
158539	158579	158536	158536	Rebecca	982	“ He came back to me . I knew he would . I knew no falsehood , no flattery , could keep him from me long . I knew he would come . I prayed so that he should . ”
158609	158618	158619	158619	she	6593	“ But what have I done to you , ”
158627	158688	158689	158689	she	6593	“ that you should try and take him from me ? I had him but for six weeks . You might have spared me those , Rebecca . And yet , from the very first day of our wedding , you came and blighted it . Now he is gone , are you come to see how unhappy I am ? ”
158692	158712	158689	158689	she	6593	“ You made me wretched enough for the past fortnight : you might have spared me to - day . ”
158713	158721	158723	158723	Rebecca	982	“ I — I never came here , ”
158729	158751	158752	158752	she	6593	“ No . You did n’t come . You took him away . Are you come to fetch him from me ? ”
158759	158833	158752	158752	she	6593	“ He was here , but he is gone now . There on that very sofa he sate . Do n’t touch it . We sate and talked there . I was on his knee , and my arms were round his neck , and we said ‘ Our Father . ’ Yes , he was here : and they came and took him away , but he promised me to come back . ”
158834	158843	158845	158845	Rebecca	982	“ He will come back , my dear , ”
158853	158856	158858	158858	Amelia	632	“ Look , ”
158860	158872	158858	158858	Amelia	632	“ this is his sash — isn’t it a pretty colour ? ”
158948	158953	158955	158955	Jos	674	“ How is Amelia ? ”
158966	158974	158976	158976	Rebecca	982	“ There should be somebody with her , ”
158978	158986	158988	158988	she	982	“ I think she is very unwell ; ”
159150	159159	159143	159143	she	5753	“ I ’ve cares of my own enough , ”
159166	159228	159236	159236	her	5753	“ and I thought poor Amelia would be little wanting for company this day . But if she ’s so bad as you say , and you ca n’t attend to her , who used to be so fond of her , faith I ’ll see if I can be of service . And so good marning to ye , Madam ; ”
159299	159319	159321	159321	Peggy	944	“ My service to ye , me fine Madam , and I ’m glad to see ye so cheerful , ”
159323	159339	159321	159321	Peggy	944	“ It ’s not you that will cry your eyes out with grief , anyway . ”
159399	159409	159410	159410	she	5753	“ You must bear up , Amelia , dear , ”
159414	159449	159410	159410	she	5753	“ for he must n’t find you ill when he sends for you after the victory . It ’s not you are the only woman that are in the hands of God this day . ”
159450	159463	159464	159464	Amelia	632	“ I know that . I am very wicked , very weak , ”
159616	159619	159621	159621	he	674	“ Try , ”
159623	159635	159637	159637	he	674	“ the soup is very good . Do try , Emmy , ”
159658	159668	159669	159669	she	632	“ You are very good and kind , Joseph , ”
159672	159691	159669	159669	she	632	“ Everybody is , but if you please , I will stay in my room to - day . ”

159910	159915	159917	159917	Jos	674	“ What is it ? ”
159919	159929	159917	159917	Jos	674	“ Why do n’t you pour , you rascal ? ”

160449	160460	160444	160446	the stout lady	6668	“ until after sunset , when the firing was over . ”
160613	160617	160618	160618	he	674	“ Mrs. O’Dowd , ”
160621	160630	160618	160618	he	674	“ had n’t you better get Amelia ready ? ”
160631	160643	160645	160646	the Major	18559	“ Are you going to take her out for a walk ? ”
160650	160659	160645	160646	the Major	18559	“ sure she ’s too weak to stir . ”
160660	160668	160669	160669	he	674	“ I — I’ve ordered the carriage , ”
160672	160686	160669	160669	he	674	“ and — and post - horses ; Isidor is gone for them , ”
160690	160701	160703	160704	the lady	2536	“ What do you want with driving to - night ? ”
160706	160724	160703	160704	the lady	2536	“ Is n’t she better on her bed ? I ’ve just got her to lie down . ”
160725	160730	160732	160732	Jos	674	“ Get her up , ”
160734	160743	160745	160745	he	674	“ she must get up , I say : ”
160751	160773	160745	160745	he	674	“ I say the horses are ordered — yes , the horses are ordered . It ’s all over , and — ”
160774	160778	160780	160781	Mrs. O’Dowd	937	“ And what ? ”
160783	160790	160791	160791	Jos	674	“ I ’m off for Ghent , ”
160794	160816	160791	160791	Jos	674	“ Everybody is going ; there ’s a place for you ! We shall start in half - an - hour . ”
160828	160840	160842	160842	she	5753	“ I do n’t move till O’Dowd gives me the route , ”
160844	160865	160842	160842	she	5753	“ You may go if you like , Mr. Sedley ; but , faith , Amelia and I stop here . ”
160866	160871	160873	160873	Jos	674	“ She shall go , ”
160896	160909	160910	160910	she	5753	“ Is it her mother you ’re going to take her to ? ”
160913	160964	160910	160910	she	5753	“ or do you want to go to Mamma yourself , Mr. Sedley ? Good marning — a pleasant journey to ye , sir . Bon voyage , as they say , and take my counsel , and shave off them mustachios , or they ’ll bring you into mischief . ”
160965	160970	160973	160973	Jos	674	“ D — n ! ”
160997	161004	161007	161009	the furious domestic	6683	“ Pas de chevaux , sacrebleu ! ”
161789	161795	161796	161796	he	2906	“ It is all over , ”
161801	161843	161796	161796	he	2906	“ Milor Duke is a prisoner ; the Duke of Brunswick is killed ; the British army is in full flight ; there is only one man escaped , and he is in the kitchen now — come and hear him . ”
161941	161947	161949	161949	Jos	674	“ And the — th ? ”
161951	161956	161958	161959	the hussar	6722	“ Cut in pieces , ”
161967	161977	161963	161963	Pauline	1239	“ O my mistress , ma bonne petite dame , ”
162320	162327	162329	162329	he	674	“ Coupez - moi , Isidor , ”
162331	162338	162329	162329	he	674	“ vite ! Coupez - moi ! ”
162360	162363	162365	162365	Jos	674	“ Les moustaches ”
162367	162427	162365	162365	Jos	674	“ les moustaches — coupy , rasy , vite!—his French was of this sort — voluble , as we have said , but not remarkable for grammar . Isidor swept off the mustachios in no time with the razor , and heard with inexpressible delight his master ’s orders that he should fetch a hat and a plain coat . “
162441	162520	162521	162522	Venny maintenong	1260	dehors”—were Jos ’s words,—the coat and cap were at last his property . This gift being made , Jos selected a plain black coat and waistcoat from his stock , and put on a large white neck - cloth , and a plain beaver . If he could have got a shovelhat he would have worn it . As it was , you would have fancied he was a flourishing , large parson of the Church of England . “
162524	162528	162521	162522	Venny maintenong	1260	” he continued , “
162539	163105	163107	163108	a lady	2472	” And so having said , he plunged swiftly down the stairs of the house and passed into the street . Although Regulus had vowed that he was the only man of his regiment or of the allied army , almost , who had escaped being cut to pieces by Ney , it appeared that his statement was incorrect , and that a good number more of the supposed victims had survived the massacre . Many scores of Regulus ’s comrades had found their way back to Brussels , and — all agreeing that they had run away — filled the whole town with an idea of the defeat of the allies . The arrival of the French was expected hourly ; the panic continued , and preparations for flight went on everywhere . No horses ! thought Jos , in terror . He made Isidor inquire of scores of persons , whether they had any to lend or sell , and his heart sank within him , at the negative answers returned everywhere . Should he take the journey on foot ? Even fear could not render that ponderous body so active . Almost all the hotels occupied by the English in Brussels face the Parc , and Jos wandered irresolutely about in this quarter , with crowds of other people , oppressed as he was by fear and curiosity . Some families he saw more happy than himself , having discovered a team of horses , and rattling through the streets in retreat ; others again there were whose case was like his own , and who could not for any bribes or entreaties procure the necessary means of flight . Amongst these would - be fugitives , Jos remarked the Lady Bareacres and her daughter , who sate in their carriage in the porte - cochère of their hotel , all their imperials packed , and the only drawback to whose flight was the same want of motive power which kept Jos stationary . Rebecca Crawley occupied apartments in this hotel ; and had before this period had sundry hostile meetings with the ladies of the Bareacres family . My lady Bareacres cut Mrs. Crawley on the stairs when they met by chance ; and in all places where the latter ’s name was mentioned , spoke perseveringly ill of her neighbour . The Countess was shocked at the familiarity of General Tufto with the aide - de - camp ’s wife . The Lady Blanche avoided her as if she had been an infectious disease . Only the Earl himself kept up a sly occasional acquaintance with her , when out of the jurisdiction of his ladies . Rebecca had her revenge now upon these insolent enemies . It became known in the hotel that Captain Crawley ’s horses had been left behind , and when the panic began , Lady Bareacres condescended to send her maid to the Captain ’s wife with her Ladyship ’s compliments , and a desire to know the price of Mrs. Crawley ’s horses . Mrs. Crawley returned a note with her compliments , and an intimation that it was not her custom to transact bargains with ladies ’ maids . This curt reply brought the Earl in person to Becky ’s apartment : but he could get no more success than the first ambassador . “
163114	163122	163107	163108	a lady	2472	” Mrs. Crawley cried in great anger ; “
163155	163235	163148	163149	her ladyship	15801	” And this was all the answer that the Earl bore back to his Countess . What will not necessity do ? The Countess herself actually came to wait upon Mrs. Crawley on the failure of her second envoy . She entreated her to name her own price ; she even offered to invite Becky to Bareacres House , if the latter would but give her the means of returning to that residence . Mrs. Crawley sneered at her . “
163249	163253	163148	163149	her ladyship	15801	” she said ; “
163323	163350	163351	163351	Woman	2598	” Lady Bareacres trembled with rage and terror . The diamonds were sewed into her habit , and secreted in my Lord ’s padding and boots . “
163368	163480	163362	163362	I	0	” she said . Rebecca laughed in her face . The infuriate Countess went below , and sate in her carriage ; her maid , her courier , and her husband were sent once more through the town , each to look for cattle ; and woe betide those who came last ! Her Ladyship was resolved on departing the very instant the horses arrived from any quarter — with her husband or without him . Rebecca had the pleasure of seeing her Ladyship in the horseless carriage , and keeping her eyes fixed upon her , and bewailing , in the loudest tone of voice , the Countess ’s perplexities . “
163489	163493	163362	163362	I	0	” she said , “
163530	163624	163625	163625	He	6764	” She gave this information to the landlord , to the servants , to the guests , and the innumerable stragglers about the courtyard . Lady Bareacres could have shot her form the carriage window . It was while enjoying the humiliation of her enemy that Rebeca caught sight of Jos , who made towards her directly he perceived her . That altered , frightened , fat face , told his secret well enough . He too wanted to fly , and was on the look - out for the means of escape . “
163631	163635	163625	163625	He	6764	” thought Rebecca , “
163643	163664	163666	163666	she	6765	” Jos walked up to his friend , and put the question for the hundredth time during the past hour , “
163675	163676	163666	163666	she	6765	” “
163682	163690	163679	163679	you	6764	” said Rebecca , with a laugh . “
163705	163706	163707	163707	I	0	” “
163715	163719	163707	163707	I	0	” gasped he . “
163732	163736	163737	163737	You	6764	” asked Rebecca . “
163744	163745	163737	163737	You	6764	” “
163760	163764	163765	163765	They	6771	” Jos answered . “
163794	163795	163777	163777	they	6771	” “
163798	163806	163777	163777	they	6771	” cried Rebecca , enjoying his perplexity . “
163817	163822	163809	163809	I	0	” cried the brother . “
163860	163864	163865	163865	I	0	” sighed he — “
163870	163887	163892	163892	Isidor	1198	” the lady said . Jos could have flung himself into her arms at the news . “
163894	163898	163892	163892	Isidor	1198	” he cried : “
163909	163910	163911	163911	My	0	” “
163918	163923	163911	163911	My	0	” added the lady . “
163940	163941	163924	163924	Bullfinch	1227	” “
163949	163954	163943	163943	he	1227	” asked the civilian . “
163968	163972	163943	163943	he	1227	” answered Rebecca . “
163983	164109	164110	164110	She	6781	” Jos said . He was already on his back , in imagination , without ever so much as a thought for poor Amelia . What person who loved a horse - speculation could resist such a temptation ? In reply , Rebecca asked him to come into her room , whither he followed her quite breathless to conclude the bargain . Jos seldom spent a half - hour in his life which cost him so much money . Rebecca , measuring the value of the goods which she had for sale by Jos ’s eagerness to purchase , as well as by the scarcity of the article , put upon her horses a price so prodigious as to make even the civilian draw back . “
164117	164310	164110	164110	She	6781	” she said , resolutely . Rawdon had ordered her not to part with them , for a price less than that which she specified . Lord Bareacres below would give her the same money — and with all her love and regard for the Sedley family , her dear Mr. Joseph must conceive that poor people must live — nobody , in a word , could be more affectionate , but more firm about the matter of business . Jos ended by agreeing , as might be supposed of him . The sum he had to give her was so large that he was obliged to ask for time ; so large as to be a little fortune to Rebecca , who rapidly calculated that with this sum , and the sale of the residue of Rawdon ’s effects , and her pension as a widow should he fall , she would now be absolutely independent of the world , and might look her weeds steadily in the face . Once or twice in the day she certainly had herself thought about flying . But her reason gave her better counsel . “
164317	164321	164324	164324	they	918	” thought Becky , “
164365	165044	164110	164110	She	6781	” Meanwhile Jos and Isidor went off to the stables to inspect the newly - purchased cattle . Jos bade his man saddle the horses at once . He would ride away that very night , that very hour . And he left the valet busy in getting the horses ready , and went homewards himself to prepare for his departure . It must be secret . He would go to his chamber by the back entrance . He did not care to face Mrs. O’Dowd and Amelia , and own to them that he was about to run . By that time Jos ’s bargain with Rebecca was completed , and his horses had been visited and examined , it was almost morning once more . But though midnight was long passed , there was no rest for the city ; the people were up , the doors , and the streets were busy . Rumours of various natures went still from mouth to mouth : one report averred that the Prussians had been utterly defeated ; another that it was the English who had been attacked and conquered : a third that the latter had held their ground . This last rumour gradually got strength . No Frenchmen had made their appearance . Stragglers had come in from the army bringing reports more and more favourable : at last an aide - de - camp actually reached Brussels with despatches for the Commandant of the place , who placarded presently through the town an official announcement of the success of the allies at Quatre Bras , and the entire repulse of the French under Ney after a six hours ’ battle . The aide - de - camp must have arrived sometime while Jos and Rebecca were making their bargain together , or the latter was inspecting his purchase . When he reached his own hotel , he found a score of its numerous inhabitants on the threshold discoursing of the news ; there was no doubt as to its truth . And he went up to communicate it to the ladies under his charge . He did not think it was necessary to tell them how he had intended to take leave of them , how he had bought horses , and what a price he had paid for them . But success or defeat was a minor matter to them , who had only thought for the safety of those they loved . Amelia , at the news of the victory , became still more agitated even than before . She was for going that moment to the army . She besought her brother with tears to conduct her thither . Her doubts and terrors reached their paroxysm ; and the poor girl , who for many hours had been plunged into stupor , raved and ran hither and thither in hysteric insanity — a piteous sight . No man writhing in pain on the hard - fought field fifteen miles off , where lay , after their struggles , so many of the brave — no man suffered more keenly than this poor harmless victim of the war . Jos could not bear the sight of her pain . He left his sister in the charge of her stouter female companion , and descended once more to the threshold of the hotel , where everybody still lingered , and talked , and waited for more news . It grew to be broad daylight as they stood here , and fresh news began to arrive from the war , brought by men who had been actors in the scene . Wagons and long country carts laden with wounded came rolling into the town ; ghastly groans came from within them , and haggard faces looked up sadly from out of the straw . Jos Sedley was looking at one of these carriages with a painful curiosity — the moans of the people within were frightful — the wearied horses could hardly pull the cart . “
165049	165068	164110	164110	She	6781	” a feeble voice cried from the straw , and the carriage stopped opposite Mr. Sedley ’s hotel . “
165078	165206	165071	165071	George	657	” cried Amelia , rushing in a moment to the balcony , with a pallid face and loose flowing hair . It was not George , however , but it was the next best thin it was news of him . It was poor Tom Stubble , who had marched out of Brussels so gallantly twenty - four hours before , bearing the colours of the regiment which he had defended very gallantly upon the field . A French lancer had speared the young ensign in the leg , who fell , still bravely holding to his flag . At the conclusion of the engagement , a place had been found for the poor boy in a cart , and he had been brought back to Brussels . “
165213	165254	165210	165211	Mr. Sedley	674	” cried the boy , faintly , and Jos came up almost frightened at the appeal . He had not at first distinguished who it was that called him . Little Tom Stubble held out his hot and feeble hand . “
165263	165267	165268	165268	Osborne	657	” he said . “
165294	165776	165780	165780	he	6789	” This young fellow ’s thoughts , during the long feverish hours passed in the cart , had been wandering to his father ’s personage which he had quitted only a few months before , and he had sometimes forgotten his pain in that delirium . The hotel was large , and the people kind , and all the inmates of the cart were taken in and placed on various couches . The young ensign was conveyed upstairs to Osborne ’s quarters . Amelia and the Major ’s wife had rushed down to him , when the latter had recognized him from the balcony . You may fancy the feelings of these women when they were told that the day was over , and both their husbands were safe ; in what mute rapture Amelia fell on her good friend ’s neck , and embraced her ; in what a grateful passion of prayer she fell on her knees , and thanked the Power which had saved her husband . Our young lady , in her fevered and nervous condition , could have had no more salutary medicine prescribed for her by any physician than that which chance put in her way . She and Mrs. O’Dowd watched incessantly by the wounded lad , whose pains were very severe , and in the duty thus forced upon her , Amelia had not time to brood over her personal anxieties , or to give herself up to her own fears and forebodings after her wo nt . The young patient told in his simple fashion the events of the day , and the actions of our friends of the gallant — th . They had suffears severly . They had lost very many officers and men . The Major ’s horse had been shot under him as the regiment charged , and they all thought that O’Dowd was gone , and that Dobbin had got his majority , until on their return from the charge to their old ground , the Major was discovered seated on Pyramus ’s carcase , refreshing himself from a case - bottle . It was Captain Osborne that cut down the French lancer who had speared the ensign . Amelia turned so pale at the notion , that Mrs. O’Dowd stopped the young ensign in this story . And it was Captain Dobbin who at the end of the day , though wounded himself , took up the lad in his arms and carried him to the surgeon , and thence to the cart which was to bring him back to Brussels . And it was he who promised the driver two louis if he would make his way to Mr. Sedley ’s hotel in the city ; and tell Mrs. Captain Osborne that the action was over , and that her husband was unhurt and well . “
165789	165794	165796	165796	he	6789	” Mrs. O’Dowd said , “
165803	166554	165796	165796	he	6789	” Young Stubble vowed there was not such another officer in the army , and never ceased his praises of the senior captain , his modesty , his kindness , and his admirable coolness in the field . To these parts of the conversation , Amelia lent a very distracted attention : it was only when George was spoken of that she listened , and when he was not mentioned , she thought about him . In tending her patient , and in thinking of the wonderful escapes of the day before , her second day passed away not too slowly with Amelia . There was only one man in the army for her : and as long as he was well , it must be owned that its movements interested her little . All the reports which Jos brought from the street fell very vaguely on her ears ; though they were sufficient to give that timorous gentleman , and many other people then in Brussels , every disquiet . The French had been repulsed certainly , but it was after a severe and doubtful struggle , and with only a division of the French army . The Emperor , with the main body , was away at Ligny , where he had utterly annihilated the Prussians , and was now free to bring his whole force to bear upon the allies . The Duke of Wellington was retreating upon the capital , and a great battle must be fought under its walls probably , of which the chances were more than doubtful . The Duke of Wellington had but twenty thousand British troops on whom he could rely , for the Germans were raw militia , the Belgians disaffected ; and with his handful his Grace had to resist a hundred and fifty thousand men that had broken into Belgium under Napoleon . Under Napoleon ! What warrior was there , however famous and skilful , that could fight at odds with him ? Jos thought of all these things , and trembled . So did all the rest of Brussels — where people felt that the fight of the day before was but the prelude to the greater combat which was imminent . One of the armies opposed to the Emperor was scattered to the winds already . The few English that could be brought to resist him would perish at their posts , and the conqueror would pass over their bodies into the city . Woe be to those whom he found there ! Addresses were prepared , public functionaries assembled and debated secretly , apartments were got ready , and tricoloured banners and triumphal emblems manufactured , to welcome the arrival of His Majesty the Emperor and King . The emigration still continued , and wherever families could find means of departure , they fled . When Jos , on the afternoon of the 17th of June , went to Rebecca ’s hotel , he found that the great Bareacres ’ carriage had at length rolled away from the porte - cochère . The Earl had procured a pair of horses somehow , in spite of Mrs. Crawley , and was rolling on the road to Ghent . Louis the Desired was getting ready his portmanteau in that city , too . It seemed as if Misfortune was never tired of worrying into motion that unwieldy exile . Jos felt that the delay of yesterday had been only a respite , and that his dearly bought horses must of a surety be put into requisition . His agonies were very severe all this day . As long as there was an English army between Brussels and Napoleon , there was no need of immediate flight ; but he had his horses brought from their distant stables , to the stables in the court - yard of the hotel where he lived ; so that they might be under his own eyes , and beyond the risk of violent abduction . Isidor watched the stable - door constantly , and had the horses saddled , to be ready for the start . He longed intensely for that event . After the reception of the previous day , Rebecca did not care to come near her dear Amelia . She clipped the bouquet which George had brought her , and gave fresh water to the flowers , and read over the letter which he had sent her . “
166558	166573	165796	165796	he	6789	” she said , twirling round the little bit of paper in her fingers , “
166626	167245	166615	166618	My poor good Rawdon	6794	” And then she fell to thinking what she should do if — if anything happened to poor good Rawdon , and what a great piece of luck it was that he had left his horses behind . In the course of this day too , Mrs. Crawley , who saw not without anger the Bareacres party drive off , bethought her of the precaution which the Countess had taken , and did a little needlework for her own advantage ; she stitched away the major part of her trinkets , bills and bank - notes about her person , and so prepared , was ready for any event — to fly if she thought fit , or to stay and welcome the conqueror , were he Englishman or Frenchman . And I am not sure that she did not dream that night of becoming a duchess and Madame la Maréchale , while Rawdon wrapped in his cloak , and making his bivouac under the rain at Mount Saint John , was thinking , with all the force of his heart , about the little wife whom he had left behind him . The next day was a Sunday . And Mrs. Major O’Dowd had the satisfaction of seeing both her patients refreshed in health and spirits by some rest which they had taken during the night . She herself had slept on a great chair in Amelia ’s room , ready to wait upon her poor friend or the ensign , should either need her nursing . When morning came , this robust woman went back to the house where she and her Major had their billet ; and here performed an elaborate and splendid toilette , befitting the day . And it is very possible that whilst alone in that chamber , which her husband had inhabited , and where his cap still lay on the pillow , and his cane stood in the corner , one prayer at least was sent up to Heaven for the welfare of the brave soldier , Michael O’Dowd . When she returned she brought her prayer - book with her , and her uncle the Dean ’s famous book of sermons , out of which she never failed to read every Sabbath ; not understanding all , haply , not pronouncing many of the words aright , which were long and abstruse — for the Dean was a learned man , and loved long Latin words — but with great gravity , vast emphasis , and with tolerable corrections in the main . How often has my Mick listened to these sermons , she thought , and me reading in the cabin of a calm ! She proposed to resume this exercise on the present day , with Amelia and the wounded ensign for a congregation . The same service was read on that day in twenty thousand churches at the same hour ; and millions of British men and women , on their knees , implored protection of the Father of all . They did not hear the noise which disturbed our little congregation at Brussels . Much louder than that which had interrupted them two days previously , as Mrs. O’Dowd was reading the service in her best voice , the cannon of Waterloo began to roar . When Jos heard that dreadful sound , he made up his mind that he would bear this perpetual recurrence of terrors no longer , and would fly at once . He rushed into the sick man ’s room , where our three friends had paused in their prayers , and further interrupted them by a passionate appeal to Amelia . “
167256	167260	167254	167254	Emmy	677	” he said ; “
167302	167303	167304	167304	God	655	” “
167320	167330	167331	167331	I	0	” Mrs. O’Dowd said , laying down the book . “
167337	167343	167331	167331	I	0	” the civilian went on ; “
167363	167364	167347	167347	she	632	” “
167374	167386	167365	167365	You	674	” said the little Stubble , the wounded hero , from his bed—“and
167401	167402	167396	167396	you	674	” “
167409	167420	167396	167396	you	674	” said she , going up and kissing the boy . “
167463	167484	167485	167485	I	0	” This image caused the young patient to burst out laughing in his bed , and even made Amelia smile . “
167491	167494	167485	167485	I	0	” Jos shouted out—“I
167515	167516	167512	167512	you	4297	” “
167523	167549	167521	167521	Joseph	674	” Amelia said , with a look of wonder , and gave her hand to the Major ’s wife . Jos ’s patience was exhausted . “
167556	167673	167676	167676	him	6804	” he said , shaking his fist in a rage , and slamming the door by which he retreated . And this time he really gave his order for march : and mounted in the courtyard . Mrs. O’Dowd heard the clattering hoofs of the horses as they issued from the gate ; and looking on , made many scornful remarks on poor Joseph as he rode down the street with Isidor after him in the laced cap . The horses , which had not been exercised for some days , were lively , and sprang about the street . Joe , a clumsy and timid horseman , did not look to advantage in the saddle . “
167697	168360	167693	167693	I	0	” And presently the pair of riders disappeared at a canter down the street leading in the direction of the Ghent road , Mrs. O’Dowd pursuing them with a fire of sarcasm so long as they were in sight . All that day from morning until past sunset , the cannon never ceased to roar . It was dark when the cannonading stopped all of a sudden . All of us have read of what occurred during that interval . The tale is in every Englishman ’s mouth ; and you and I , who were children when the great battle was won and lost , are never tired of hearing the recounting the history of that famous action . Its remembrance rankles still in the bosoms of millions of the countrymen of those brave men who lost the day . They pant for an opportunity of revenging that humiliation ; and if a contest , ending in a victory on their part , should ensue , elating them in their turn , and leaving its cursed legacy of hatred and rage behind to us , there is no end to the so - called glory and shame , and to the alterations of successful and unsuccessful murder , in which two high - spirited nations might engage . Centuries hence , we Frenchmen and Englishmen might be boasting and killing each other still , carrying out bravely the Devil ’s code of honour . All our friends took their share and fought like men in the great field . All day long , whilst the women were praying ten miles away , the lines of the dauntless English infantry were receiving and repelling the furious charges of the French horsemen . Guns which were heard at Brussels were ploughing up their ranks , and comrades falling , and the resolute survivors closing in . Toward evening , the attack of the French , repeated and resisted so bravely , slackened in its fury . They had other foes besides the British to engage , or were preparing for a final onset . It came at last ; the columns of the Imperial Guard marched up the hill of Saint Jean , at length and at once to sweep the English from the height which they had maintained all day , and spite of all : unscared by the thunder of the artillery , which hurled death from the English line — the dark rolling column pressed on and up the hill . It seemed almost to crest the eminence , when it began to wave and falter . Then it stopped , still facing the shot . Then at last the English troops rushed from the post from which no enemy had been able to dislodge them , and the Guard turned and fled . No more firing was heard at Brussels — the pursuit rolled miles away . Darkness came down on the field and city : and Amelia was praying for George , who was lying on his face , dead , with a bullet through his heart . THE KIND reader must please to remember — while the army is marching from Flanders , and , after its heroic actions there , is advancing to take the fortifications on the frontiers of France , previous to an occupation of that country,—that there are a number of persons living peaceably in England who have to do with the history at present in hand , and must come in for their share of the chronicle . During the time of these battles and dangers , old Miss Crawley was living at Brighton , very moderately moved by the great events going on . The great events rendered the newspapers rather interesting , to be sure , and Briggs read out the Gazette , in which Rawdon Crawley ’s gallantry was mentioned with honour , and his promotion was presently recorded . “
168377	168382	168388	168388	he	6806	” his aunt said ; “
168482	168483	168487	168488	Miss Crawley	839	” “
168513	168537	168487	168488	Miss Crawley	839	” said Miss Briggs , who was greatly excited by the Waterloo proceedings , and loved speaking romantically when there was an occasion . “
168563	168564	168565	168565	Briggs	644	” “
168572	168577	168565	168565	Briggs	644	” said Miss Crawley : “
168713	169101	168692	168692	you	644	” Miss Crawley was now in the habit of writing to Mr. Waxy her solicitor almost every day in the week , for her arrangements respecting her property were all revoked , and her perplexity was great as to the future disposition of her money . The spinster had , however , rallied considerably ; as was proved by the increased vigour and frequency of her sarcasms upon Miss Briggs , all which attacks the poor companion bore with meekness , with cowardice , with a resignation that was half generous and half hypocritical — with the slavish submission , in a word , that women of her disposition and station are compelled to show . Who has not seen how women bully women ? What tortures have men to endure , comparable to those daily repeated shafts of scorn and cruelty with which poor women are riddled by the tyrants of their sex ? Poor victims ! But we are starting from our proposition , which is , that Miss Crawley was always particularly annoying and savage when she was rallying from illness — as they say wounds tingle most when they are about to heal . While thus approaching , as all hoped , to convalescence , Miss Briggs was the only victim admitted into the presence of the invalid ; yet Miss Crawley ’s relatives afar off did not forget their beloved kinswoman , and by a number of tokens , presents , and kind affectionate messages , strove to keep themselves alive in her recollection . In the first place , let us mention her nephew , Rawdon Crawley . A few weeks after the famous fight of Waterloo , and after the Gazette had made known to her the promotion and gallantry of that distinguished officer , the Dieppe packet brought over to Miss Crawley at Brighton , a box containing presents , and a dutiful letter , from the Colonel her nephew . In the box were a pair of French epaulets , a Cross of the Legion of Honour , and the hilt of a sword — relics from the field of battle : and the letter described with a good deal of humour how the latter belonged to a commanding - officer of the Guard , who having sworn that “
169110	169297	168692	168692	you	644	” was taken prisoner the next minute by a private soldier , who broke the Frenchman ’s sword with the butt of his musket , when Rawdon made himself master of the shattered weapon . As for the cross and epaulets , they came from a Colonel of French cavalry , who had fallen under the aide - de - camp ’s arm in the battle : and Rawdon Crawley did not know what better to do with the spoils than to send them to his kindest and most affectionate old friend . Should he continue to write to her from Paris , whither the army was marching ? He might be able to give her interesting news from that capital , and of some of Miss Crawley ’s old friends of the emigration , to whom she had shown so much kindness during their distress . The spinster caused Briggs to write back to the Colonel a gracious and complimentary letter , encouraging him to continue his correspondence . His first letter was so excessively lively and amusing that she should look with pleasure for its successors.—“Of
169303	169310	169300	169300	I	0	” she explained to Miss Briggs , “
169379	169733	169368	169368	him	6830	” I wonder whether she knew that it was not only Becky who wrote the letters , but that Mrs. Rawdon actually took and sent home the trophies — which she bought for a few francs , from one of the innumerable pedlars who immediately began to deal in relics of the war . The novelist , who knows everything , knows this also . Be this , however , as it may , Miss Crawley ’s gracious reply greatly encouraged our young friends , Rawdon and his lady , who hoped for the best from their aunt ’s evidently pacified humour : and they took care to entertain her with many delightful letters from Paris , whither , as Rawdon said , they had the good luck to go in the track of the conquering army . To the rector ’s lady , who went off to tend her husband ’s broken collar - bone at the Rectory at Queen ’s Crawley , the spinster ’s communications were by no means so gracious . Mrs. Bute , that brisk , managing , lively , imperious woman , had committed the most fatal of all errors with regard to her sister - in - law . She had not merely oppressed her and her household — she had bored Miss Crawley ; and if poor Miss Briggs had been a woman of any spirit , she might have been made happy by the commission which her principal gave her to write a letter to Mrs. Bute Crawley , saying that Miss Crawley ’s health was greatly improved since Mrs. Bute had left her , and begging the latter on no account to put herself to trouble , or quit her family for Miss Crawley ’s sake . This triumph over a lady who had been very haughty and cruel in her behaviour to Miss Briggs , would have rejoiced most women ; but the truth is , Briggs was a woman of no spirit at all , and the moment her enemy was discomfited , she began to feel compassion in her favour . “
169739	169748	169368	169368	him	6830	” Mrs. Bute thought , and with reason , “
169827	170244	169820	169820	you	820	” Why , indeed ? We have seen how Mrs. Bute , having the game in her hands , had really played her cards too well . She had ruled over Miss Crawley ’s household utterly and completely , to be utterly and completely routed when a favourable opportunity for rebellion came . She and her household , however , considered that she had been the victim of horrible selfishness and treason , and that her sacrifices in Miss Crawley ’s behalf had met with the most savage ingratitude . Rawdon ’s promotion , and the honourable mention made of his name in the Gazette , filled the good Christian lady also with alarm . Would his aunt relent towards him now that he was a Lieutenant - Colonel and a C.B. ? and would that odious Rebecca once more get into favour ? The Rector ’s wife wrote a sermon for her husband about the vanity of military glory and the prosperity of the wicked , which the worthy parson read in his best voice and without understanding one syllable of it . He had Pitt Crawley for one of his auditors — Pitt , who had come with his two half - sisters to church , which the old Baronet could now by no means be brought to frequent . Since the departure of Becky Sharp , that old wretch had given himself up entirely to his bad courses , to the great scandal of the county and the mute horror of his son . The ribbons in Miss Horrock ’s cap became more splendid than ever . The polite families fled the hall and its owner in terror . Sir Pitt went about tippling at his tenants ’ houses ; and drank rum - and - water with the farmers at Mudbury and the neighbouring places on market - days . He drove the family coach - and - four to Southampton with Miss Horrocks inside ; and the county people expected every week , as his son did in speechless agony , that his marriage with her would be announced in the provincial paper . It was indeed a rude burthen for Mr. Crawley to bear . His eloquence was palsied at the missionary meetings , and other religious assemblies in the neighbourhood , where he had been in the habit of presiding , and of speaking for hours ; for he felt , when he rose , that the audience said , “
170271	170308	170253	170254	Sir Pitt	697	” And once when he was speaking of the benighted condition of the king of Timbuctoo , and the number of his wives who were likewise in darkness , some gipsy miscreant from the crowd asked , “
170321	170866	170318	170319	Young Squaretoes	1269	” to the surprise of the platform , and the ruin of Mr. Pitt ’s speech . And the two daughters of the house of Queen ’s Crawley would have been allowed to run utterly wild ( for Sir Pitt swore that no governess should ever enter into his doors again ) , had not Mr. Crawley , by threatening the old gentleman , forced the latter to send them to school . Meanwhile , as we have said , whatever individual differences there might be between them all , Miss Crawley ’s dear nephews and nieces were unanimous in loving her and sending her tokens of affection . Thus Mrs. Bute sent guinea - fowls , and some remarkably fine cauliflowers , and a pretty purse or pincushion worked by her darling girls , who begged to keep a little place in the recollection of their dear aunt , while Mr. Pitt sent peaches and grapes and venison from the Hall . The Southampton coach used to carry those tokens of affection to Miss Crawley at Brighton : it used sometimes to convey Mr. Pitt thither too : for his differences with Sir Pitt caused Mr. Crawley to absent himself a good deal from home now : and besides , he had an attraction at Brighton in the person of the Lady Jane Sheepshanks , whose engagement to Mr. Crawley has been formerly mentioned in this history . Her Ladyship and her sisters lived at Brighton with their mamma , the Countess Southdown , that strong - minded woman so favourably known in the serious world . A few words ought to be said regarding her Ladyship and her noble family , who are bound by ties of present and future relationship to the house of Crawley . Respecting the chief of the Southdown family , Clement William , fourth Earl of Southdown , little need be told , except that his Lordship came into Parliament ( as Lord Wolsey ) under the auspices of Mr. Wilberforce , and for a time was a credit to his political sponsor , and decidedly a serious young man . But words can not describe the feelings of his admirable mother , when she learned , very shortly after her noble husband ’s demise , that her son was a member of several worldly clubs , had lost largely at play at Wattier ’s and the Cocoa Tree ; that he had raised money on post - obits , and encumbered the family estate ; that he drove four - in - hand , and patronised the ring ; and that he actually had an opera - box , where he entertained the most dangerous bachelor company . His name was only mentioned with groans in the dowager ’s circle . The Lady Emily was her brother ’s senior by many years ; and took considerable rank in the serious world as author of some of the delightful tracts before mentioned , and of many hymns and spiritual pieces . A mature spinster , and having but faint ideas of marriage , her love for the blacks occupied almost all her feelings . It is to her , I believe , we owe that beautiful poem — “
170892	171342	170886	170887	the blacks	19886	” & c. She had correspondence with clerical gentlemen in most of our East and West India possessions ; and was secretly attached to the Reverend Silas Hornblower , who was tattoed in the South Sea Islands . As for the Lady Jane , on whom , as it has been said , Mr. Pitt Crawley ’s affection had been placed , she was gentle , blushing , silent , and timid . In spite of his falling away , she wept for her brother , and was quite ashamed of loving him still . Even yet she used to send him little hurried smuggled notes , and pop them into the post in private . The one dreadful secret which weighed upon her life was , that she and the old housekeeper had been to pay Southdown a furtive visit at his chambers in the Albany ; and found him — O the naughty dear abandoned wretch!—smoking a cigar with a bottle of Curacoa before him . She admired her sister , she adored her mother , she thought Mr. Crawley the most delightful and accomplished of men , after Southdown , that fallen angel : and her mamma and sister , who were ladies of the most superior sort , managed everything for her , and regarded her with that amiable pity , of which your really superior woman always has such a share to give away . Her mamma ordered her dresses , her books , her bonnets , and her ideas for her . She was made to take pony - riding , or piano - exercise , or any other sort of bodily medicament , according as my Lary Southdown saw meet ; and her ladyship would have kept her daughter in pinafores up to her present age of six - and - twenty , but that they were thrown off when Lady Jane was presented to Queen Charlotte . When these ladies first came to their house at Brighton , it was to them alone that Mr. Crawley paid his personal visits , contenting himself by leaving a card at his aunt ’s house , and making a modest inquiry of Mr. Bowls or his assistant footman , with respect to the health of the invalid . When he met Miss Briggs coming home from the library with a cargo of novels under her arm , Mr. Crawley ’s blushed in a manner quite unusual to him , as he stepped forward and shook Miss Crawley ’s companion by the hand . He introduced Miss Briggs to the lady with whom he happened to be walking , the Lady Jane Sheepshanks , saying , “
171391	172034	171362	171363	Miss Briggs	644	” Lady Jane blushed too as she held out a kind little hand to Miss Briggs and said something very civil and incoherent about mamma , and proposing to call on Miss Crawley , and being glad to be made known to the friends and relatives of Mr. Crawley ; and with soft dove - like eyes saluted Miss Briggs as they separated , while Pitt Crawley treated her to a profound courtly bow , such as he had used to H.H. the Duchess of Pumpernickel , when he was attaché at that court . The artful diplomatist and disciple of the Machiavellian Binkie ! It was he who had given Lady Jane that copy of poor Briggs ’s early poems , which he remembered to have seen at Queen ’s Crawley , with a dedication from the poetess to his father ’s late wife ; and he brought the volume with him to Brighton , reading it in the Southampton coach and marking it with his own pencil , before he presented it to the gentle Lady Jane . It was he , too , who laid before Lady Southdown the great advantages which might occur from an intimacy between her family and Miss Crawley,—advantages both worldly and spiritual , he said : for Miss Crawley was now quite alone ; the monstrous dissipation and alliance of his brother Rawdon had estranged her affections from that reprobate young man ; the greedy tyranny and avarice of Mrs. Bute Crawley had caused the old lady to revolt against the exorbitant pretensions of that part of the family ; and though he himself had held off all his life from cultivating Miss Crawley ’s friendship , with perhaps an improper pride , he thought now that every becoming means should be taken , both to save her soul from perdition , and to secure her fortune to himself as the head of the house of Crawley . The strong - minded Lady Southdown quite agreed in both proposals of her son - in - law , and was for converting Miss Crawley off hand . At her own home , both at Southdown and at Trottermore Castle , this tall and awful missionary of the truth rode about the country in her barouche with outriders , launched packets of tracts among the cottagers and tenants , and would order Gaffer Jones to be converted , as she would order Goody Hicks to take a James ’s powder , without appeal , resistance , or benefit of clergy . My Lord Southdown , her late husband , an epileptic and simple - minded nobleman , was in the habit of approving of everything which his Matilda did and thought . So that whatever changes her own belief might undergo ( and it accommodated itself to a prodigious variety of opinion , taken from all sorts of doctors among the Dissenters ) , she had not the least scruple in ordering all her tenants and inferiors to follow and believe after her . Thus whether she received the Reverend Saunders McNitre , the Scotch divine ; or the Reverend Luke Waters , the mild Wesleyan ; or the Reverend Giles Jowls , the illuminated Cobbler , who dubbed himself Reverend as Napoleon crowned himself Emperor — the household , children , tenantry of my Lady Southdown were expected to go down on their knees with her Ladyship , and say Amen to the prayers of either Doctor . During these exercises old Southdown , on account of his invalid condition , was allowed to sit in his own room , and have negus and the paper read to him . Lady Jane was the old Earl ’s favourite daughter , and tended and loved him sincerely ; as for Lady Emily , the authoress of the “
172040	172089	171362	171363	Miss Briggs	644	” her denunciations of future punishment ( at this period , for her opinions modified afterwards ) , were so awful that they used to frighten the timid old gentleman her father , and the physician declared his fits always occurred after one of her Ladyship ’s sermons . “
172095	172114	171362	171363	Miss Briggs	644	” said Lady Southdown then , in reply to the exhortation of her daughter ’s prétendu , Mr. Pitt Crawley—“Who
172122	172132	172133	172138	A most dangerous and ignorant practitioner	6844	” Mr. Crawley mentioned the name of Mr. Creamer . “
172242	172365	172235	172235	Pitt	823	” Pitt expressed his perfect acquiescence . He , too , had been carried along by the energy of his noble kinswoman , and future mother - in - law . He had been made to accept Saunders McNitre , Luck Waters , Giles Jowls , Podgers ’ Pills , Rodgers ’ Pills , Pokey ’s Elixir , every one of her Ladyship ’s remedies spiritual or temporal . He never left her house without carrying respectfully away with him piles of her quack theology and medicine . O , my dear brethren and fellow - sojourners in Vanity Fair , which among you does not know and suffer under such benevolent despots ? It is in vain you say to them , “
172400	172445	172450	172450	Rodgers	1285	” There is no help for it ; the faithful proselytizer , if she can not convince by arguments , bursts into tears , and the recusant finds himself , at the end of the contest , taking down the bolus , and saying . “
172455	172456	172450	172450	Rodgers	1285	” “
172464	172469	172450	172450	Rodgers	1285	” continued the Lady , “
172620	172621	172631	172631	Mamma	651	” “
172633	172638	172631	172631	Mamma	651	” said Lady Emily . “
172649	172650	172631	172631	Mamma	651	” “
172657	172664	172631	172631	Mamma	651	” said Pitt , the diplomatist . “
172722	172723	172710	172710	she	839	” “
172733	172748	172731	172731	Pitt	823	” said Lady Emily , rising with six little books already in her hand . “
172822	172823	172824	172824	You	823	” “
172834	172851	172829	172830	Miss Crawley	839	” said Lady Emily , tossing out of the room , her books in her hand . “
172864	172879	172829	172830	Miss Crawley	839	” Pitt continued , in a low voice , and without heeding the interruption , “
172986	172987	172977	172977	you	6863	” “
172994	172999	172977	172977	you	6863	” Lady Southdown remarked . “
173041	173042	173031	173031	I	0	” “
173053	173061	173045	173045	I	0	” Pitt said in a bland tone , “
173094	173095	173099	173099	Emily	831	” “
173104	173322	173099	173099	Emily	831	” Lady Southdown said ; and this time agreed to forego her usual practice , which was , as we have said , before she bore down personally upon any individual whom she proposed to subjugate , to fire in a quantity of tracts upon the menaced party ( as a charge of the French was always preceded by a furious cannonade ) . Lady Southdown , we say , for the sake of the invalid ’s health , or for the sake of her soul ’s ultimate welfare , or for the sake of her money , agreed to temporise . The next day , the great Southdown female family carriage , with the Earl ’s coronet and the lozenge ( upon which the three lambs trottant argent upon the field vert of the Southdowns , were quartered with sable on a bend or , three snuff - mulls gules , the cognizance of the house of Binkie ) , drove up in state to Miss Crawley ’s door , and the tall serious footman handed to Mr. Bowls her Ladyship ’s cards for Miss Crawley , and one likewise for Miss Briggs . By way of compromise , Lady Emily sent in a packet in the evening for the latter lady , containing copies of the “
173325	173351	173099	173099	Emily	831	” and other mild and favourite tracts for Miss B. ’s own perusal ; and a few for the servants ’ hall , viz . : “
173357	173358	173099	173099	Emily	831	” “
173366	173368	173099	173099	Emily	831	” and “
173374	173451	173099	173099	Emily	831	” of a much stronger kind . THE AMIABLE behaviour of Mr. Crawley , and Lady Jane ’s kind reception of her , highly flattered Miss Briggs , who was enabled to speak a good word for the latter , after the cards of the Southdown family had been presented to Miss Crawley . A Countess ’s card left personally too for her , Briggs , was not a little pleasing to the poor friendless companion . “
173470	173483	173485	173485	she	1274	” said the republican Miss Crawley ; upon which the companion meekly said “
173504	174106	173485	173485	she	1274	” and she put away this card in her work - box amongst her most cherished personal treasures . Furthermore , Miss Briggs explained how she had met Mr. Crawley walking with his cousin and long affianced bride the day before : and she told how kind and gentle - looking the lady was , and what a plain , not to say common , dress she had , all the articles of which , from the bonnet down to the boots , she described and estimated with female accuracy . Miss Crawley allowed Briggs to prattle on without interrupting her too much . As she got well , she was pining for society . Mr. Creamer , her medical man , would not hear of her returning to her old haunts and dissipation in London . The old spinster was too glad to find any companionship at Brighton , and not only were the cards acknowledged the very next day , but Pitt Crawley was graciously invited to come and see his aunt . He came , bringing with him Lady Southdown and her daughter . The dowager did not say a word about the state of Miss Crawley ’s soul ; but talked with much discretion about the weather : about the war and the downfall of the monster Bonaparte : and above all , about doctors , quacks , and the particular merits of Dr. Podgers , whom she then patronised . During their interview Pitt Crawley made a great stroke , and one which showed that , had his diplomatic career not been blighted by early neglect , he might have risen to a high rank in his profession . When the Countess Dowager of Southdown fell foul of the Corsican upstart , as the fashion was in those days , and showed that he was a monster stained with every conceivable crime , a coward and a tyrant not fit to live , one whose fall was predicted , & c. , Pitt Crawley suddenly took up the cudgels in favour of the man of Destiny . He described the First Consul as he saw him at Paris at the peace of Amiens ; when he , Pitt Crawley , had the gratification of making the acquaintance of the great and good Mr. Fox , a statesman whom , however much he might differ with him , it was impossible not to admire fervently — a statesman who had always had the highest opinion of the Emperor Napoleon . And he spoke in terms of the strongest indignation of the faithless conduct of the allies towards this dethroned monarch , who , after giving himself generously up to their mercy , was consigned to an ignoble and cruel banishment , while a bigoted Popish rabble was tyrannising over France in his stead . This orthodox horror of Romish superstition saved Pitt Crawley in Lady Southdown ’s opinion , whilst his admiration for Fox and Napoleon raised him immeasurably in Miss Crawley ’s eyes . Her friendship with that defunct British statesman was mentioned when we first introduced her in this history . A true Whig , Miss Crawley had been in opposition all through the war , and though , to be sure , the downfall of the Emperor did not very much agitate the old lady , or his ill - treatment tend to shorten her life or natural rest , yet Pitt spoke to her heart when he lauded both her idols ; and by that single speech made immense progress in her favour . “
174116	174169	174171	174171	she	6875	” Miss Crawley said to the young lady , for whom she had taken a liking at first sight , as she always did for pretty and modest young people ; though it must be owned her affections cooled as rapidly as they rose . Lady Jane blushed very much , and said “
174202	174219	174196	174197	Mr. Crawley	823	” And when the ladies were retiring at the conclusion of their visit , Miss Crawley hoped “
174251	174267	174235	174235	she	1274	” This promise was graciously accorded , and they separated upon great terms of amity . “
174278	174284	174276	174276	Pitt	823	” said the old lady . “
174320	174869	174312	174312	Jane	829	” Pitt promised that he would do so . He did not tell the Countess of Southdown what opinion his aunt had formed of her Ladyship , who , on the contrary , thought that she had made a most delightful and majestic impression on Miss Crawley . And so , nothing loth to comfort a sick lady , and perhaps not sorry in heart to be freed now and again from the dreary spouting of the Reverend Bartholomew Irons , and the serious toadies who gathered round the footstool of the pompous Countess , her mamma , Lady Jane became a pretty constant visitor to Miss Crawley , accompanied her in her drives , and solaced many of her evenings . She was so naturally good and soft , that even Firkin was not jealous of her ; and the gentle Briggs thought her friend was less cruel to her , when kind Lady Jane was by . Towards her Ladyship Miss Crawley ’s manners were charming . The old spinster told her a thousand anecdotes about her youth , talking to her in a very different strain from that in which she had been accustomed to converse with the godless little Rebecca ; for there was that in Lady Jane ’s innocence which rendered light talking impertinence before her , and Miss Crawley was too much of a gentlewoman to offend such purity . The young lady herself had never received kindness except from this old spinster , and her brother and father : and she repaid Miss Crawley ’s engoûment by artless sweetness and friendship . In the autumn evenings ( when Rebecca was flaunting at Paris , the gayest among the gay conquerors there , and our Amelia , our dear wounded Amelia , ah ! where was she ? ) Lady Jane would be sitting in Miss Crawley ’s drawing - room singing sweetly to her , in the twilight , her little simple songs and hymns , while the sun was setting and the sea was roaring on the beach . The old spinster used to wake up when these ditties ceased , and ask for more . As for Briggs , and the quantity of tears of happiness which she now shed as she pretended to knit , and looked out at the splendid ocean darkling before the windows , and the lamps of heaven beginning more brightly to shine — who , I say , can measure the happiness and sensibility of Briggs ? Pitt meanwhile in the dining - room , with a pamphlet on the Corn Laws or a Missionary Register by his side , took that kind of recreation which suits romantic and unromantic men after dinner . He sipped Madeira : built castles in the air : thought himself a fine fellow : felt himself much more in love with Jane than he had been any time these seven years , during which their liaison had lasted without the slightest impatience on Pitt ’s part — and slept a good deal . When the time for coffee came , Mr. Bowls used to enter in a noisy manner , and summon Squire Pitt , who would be found in the dark very busy with his pamphlet . “
174886	174905	174879	174879	somebody	2339	” Miss Crawley said one night when this functionary made his appearance with the candles and the coffee . “
174920	174936	174916	174916	she	6884	” ( the spinster always took an opportunity of abusing Briggs before the servants ) ; “
174950	174993	174994	174995	Miss Crawley	839	” At this Lady Jane blushed to the tips of her little ears , and down to the ends of her pretty fingers ; and when Mr. Bowls had quitted the room , and the door was quite shut , she said : “
175016	175017	175003	175003	I	0	” “
175035	175264	175030	175030	you	839	” cried Miss Crawley in an ecstasy : and in this picturesque and friendly occupation Mr. Pitt found the old lady and the young one , when he came upstairs with his pamphlet in his hand . How she did blush all the evening , that poor Lady Jane ! It must not be imagined that Mr. Pitt Crawley ’s artifices escaped the attention of his dear relations at the Rectory at Queen ’s Crawley . Hampshire and Sussex lie very close together , and Mrs. Bute had friends in the latter county who took care to inform her of all , and a great deal more than all , that passed at Miss Crawley ’s house at Brighton . Pitt was there more and more . He did not come for months together to the Hall , where his abominable old father abandoned himself completely to rum - and - water , and the odious society of the Horrocks family . Pitt ’s success rendered the Rector ’s family furious , and Mrs. Bute regretted more ( though she confessed less ) than ever her monstrous fault in so insulting Miss Briggs , and in being so haughty and parsimonious to Bowls and Firkin , that she had not a single person left in Miss Crawley ’s household to give her information of what took place there . “
175274	175280	175268	175268	Bute	820	” she persisted in saying ; “
175311	175312	175309	175309	Bute	820	” “
175326	175331	175319	175319	you	6888	” the divine interposed . “
175359	175360	175349	175349	you	890	” “
175377	175378	175379	175379	I	0	” “
175387	175396	175381	175381	I	0	” said the rector , good - naturedly . “
175412	175426	175409	175409	you	890	” and the pious man consoled himself with a big glass of port . “
175441	175445	175446	175447	The fellow	15669	” he continued . “
175533	175534	175535	175535	I	0	” “
175540	175549	175535	175535	I	0	” his reverence continued , after a pause . “
175552	175567	175568	175568	I	0	” said Barbara , who was biting her nails , and drumming the table . “
175681	175682	175683	175683	Jim	780	” “
175693	175703	175683	175683	Jim	780	” the housewife said ; adding with a sigh , “
175730	176255	176256	176256	Jack	1020	” Those unfortunate and well - educated woman made themselves heard from the neighbouring drawing - room , where they were thrumming away , with hard fingers , an elaborate music - piece on the pianoforte , as their mother spoke ; and indeed , they were at music , or at blackboard , or at geography , or at history , the whole day long . But what avail all these accomplishments , in Vanity Fair , to girls who are short , poor , plain , and have a bad complexion ? Mrs. Bute could think of nobody but the Curate to take one of them off her hands ; and Jim coming in from the stable at this minute , through the parlour window , with a short pipe stuck in his oil - skin cap , he and his father fell to talking about odds on the St. Leger , and the colloquy between the Rector and his wife ended . Mrs. Bute did not augur much good to the cause from the sending of her son James as an ambassador , and saw him depart in rather a despairing mood . Nor did the young fellow himself , when told what his mission was to be , expect much pleasure or benefit from it ; but he was consoled by the thought that possibly the old lady would give him some handsome remembrance of her , which would pay a few of his most pressing bills at the commencement of the ensuing Oxford term , and so took his place by the coach from Southampton , and was safely landed at Brighton on the same evening , with his portmanteau , his favorite bulldog Towzer , and an immense basket of farm and garden produce , from the dear Rectory folks to the dear Miss Crawley . Considering it was too late to disturb the invalid lady on the first night of his arrival , he put up at an inn , and did not wait upon Miss Crawley until a late hour in the noon of next day . James Crawley , when his aunt had last beheld him , was a gawky lad , at that uncomfortable age when the voice varies between an unearthly treble and a preternatural bass : when the face not uncommonly blooms out with appearances for which Rowland ’s Kalydor is said to act as a cure ; when boys are seen to shave furtively with their sister ’s scissors , and the sight of other young women produces intolerable sensations of terror in them ; when the great hands and ankles protrude a long way from garments which have grown too tight for them ; when their presence after dinner is at once frightful to the ladies , who are whispering in the twilight in the drawing - room , and inexpressibly odious to the gentlemen over the mahogany , who are restrained from freedom of intercourse and delightful interchange of wit by the presence of that gawky innocence ; when at the conclusion of the second glass , papa says , “
176271	176409	176410	176410	he	15491	” and the youth , willing to be free yet hurt at not being yet a man , quits the incomplete banquet . James , then a hobbadehoy , was now become a young man , having had the benefits of a university education , and acquired he inestimable polish which is gained by living in a fast set at a small college , and contracting debts , and being rusticated , and being plucked . He was a handsome lad , however , when he came to present himself to his aunt at Brighton , and good looks were always a title to the fickle old lady ’s favour . Nor did his blushes and awkwardness take away from it : she was pleased with these healthy tokens of the young gentleman ’s ingenuousness . He said “
176453	176592	176595	176595	ye	6917	” Pitt was in the room with Miss Crawley when the lad was announced , and looked very blank when his name was mentioned . The old lady had plenty of humour , and enjoyed her correct nephew ’s perplexity . She asked after all the people at the Rectory with great interest ; and said she was thinking of paying them a visit . She praised the lad to his face , and said he was well - grown and very much improved , and that it was a pity his sisters had not some of his good looks ; and finding , on inquiry , that he had taken up his quarters at an hotel , would not hear of his stopping there , but bade Mr. Bowls send for Mr. James Crawley ’s things instantly ; “
176599	176607	176595	176595	ye	6917	” she added , with great graciousness , “
176620	176680	176681	176681	I	0	” She flung Pitt a look of arch triumph , which caused that diplomatist almost to choke with envy . Much as he had ingratiated himself with his aunt , she had never yet invited him to stay under her roof , and here was a young whipper - snapper , who at first sight was made welcome there . “
176688	176698	176686	176686	Sir	15428	” says Bowls , advancing with a profound bow ; “
176712	176713	176706	176706	Thomas	1234	” “
176718	176732	176706	176706	Thomas	1234	” said young James , starting up , as if in some alarm , “
176737	176738	176733	176733	I	0	” “
176741	176746	176747	176749	The Tom Cribb	1303	” said Miss Crawley . “
176753	176797	176798	176798	I	0	” said James , blushing deeply . Miss Crawley burst out laughing at this title . Mr. Bowls gave one abrupt guffaw , as a confidential servant of the family , but choked the rest of the volley ; the diplomatist only smiled . “
176807	176814	176800	176800	I	0	” said James , looking down . “
176829	176900	176901	176901	I	0	” The young story - teller ! The fact is , that on the Southampton coach , the day previous , James Crawley had met the Tutbury Pet , who was coming to Brighton to make a match with the Rottingdean Fibber ; and enchanted by the Pet ’s conversation , had passed the evening in company with that scientific man and his friends , at the inn in question . “
176911	176915	176903	176903	I’d	0	” James continued . “
176925	176940	176921	176921	you	6922	” he added , generously . This delicacy made his aunt laugh the more . “
176949	176960	176947	176947	Bowls	888	” she said , with a wave of her hand , “
176967	176980	176947	176947	Bowls	888	” Poor lady , she did not know what she had done ! “
176989	176997	176985	176987	a little dawg	6923	” said James , looking frightfully guilty , “
177011	177180	177005	177005	He	6923	” All the party cried out with laughing at this description ; even Briggs and Lady Jane , who was sitting mute during the interview between Miss Crawley and her nephew : and Bowls , without a word , quitted the room . Still , by way of punishing her elder nephew , Miss Crawley persisted in being gracious to the young Oxonian . There were no limits to her kindness or her compliments when they once began . She told Pitt he might come to dinner , and insisted that James should accompany her in her drive , and paraded him solemnly up and down the cliff , on the back seat of the barouche . During all this excursion , she condescended to say civil things to him : she quoted Italian and French poetry to the poor bewildered lad , and persisted that he was a fine scholar , and was perfectly sure he would gain a gold medal , and be a Senior Wrangler . “
177185	177194	177005	177005	He	6923	” laughed James , encouraged by these compliments ; “
177207	177208	177005	177005	He	6923	” “
177219	177224	177225	177226	Senior Wranglers	1307	” said the lady . “
177233	177434	177225	177226	Senior Wranglers	1307	” said the scholar , with a knowing air ; and would probably have been more confidential , but that suddenly there appeared on the cliff in a tax - cart , drawn by a bang - up pony , dressed in white flannel coats , with mother - of - pearl buttons , his friends the Tutbury Pet and the Rottingdean Fibber , with three other gentlemen of their acquaintance , who all saluted poor James there in the carriage as he sate . This incident damped the ingenuous youth ’s spirits , and no word of yea or nay could he be induced to utter during the rest of the drive . On his return he found his room prepared , and his portmanteau ready , and might have remarked that Mr. Bowls ’s countenance , when the latter conducted him to his apartments , wore a look of gravity , wonder , and compassion . But the thought of Mr. Bowls did not enter his head . He was deploring the dreadful predicament in which he found himself , in a house full of old women , jabbering French and Italian , and talking poetry to him . “
177443	177725	177225	177226	Senior Wranglers	1307	” exclaimed the modest boy , who could not face the gentlest of her sex — not even Briggs — when she began to talk to him ; whereas , put him at Iffley Lock , and he could out - slang the boldest bargeman . At dinner , James appeared choking in a white neckcloth , and had the honour of handing my Lady Jane downstairs , while Briggs and Mr. Crawley followed afterwards , conducting the old lady , with her apparatus of bundles , and shawls , and cushions . Half of Briggs ’s time at dinner was spent in superintending the invalid ’s comfort , and in cutting up chicken for her fat spaniel . James did not talk much , but he made a point of asking all the ladies to drink wine , and accepted Mr. Crawley ’s challenge , and consumed the greater part of a bottle of champagne which Mr. Bowls was ordered to produce in his honour . The ladies having withdrawn , and the two cousins being left together , Pitt , the ex - diplomatist , became very communicative and friendly . He asked after James ’s career at college — what his prospects in life were — hoped heartily he would get on ; and , in a word , was frank and amiable . James ’s tongue unloosed with the port , and he told his cousin his life , his prospects , his debts , his troubles at the little - go , and his rows with the proctors , filling rapidly from the bottles before him , and flying from Port to Madeira with joyous activity . “
177734	177743	177225	177226	Senior Wranglers	1307	” said Mr. Crawley , filling his glass , “
177828	177829	177813	177813	She	839	” “
177841	177845	177832	177832	you	6934	” said James . “
177865	177874	177875	177875	She	829	” Pitt replied , with a courtly air . “

178009	178020	178001	178001	you	0	” Pitt remarked mildly , handling his cousin the decanter to “

178087	178097	178077	178085	a bull - terrier as —— Pooh ! gammon	6951	” cried James , bursting out laughing at his own absurdity,—“you

178137	178144	178118	178118	you	697	” Pitt continued with increased blandness , “

178177	178187	178217	178217	I	0	” said James , gulping the ruby fluid down . “
178269	178377	178254	178256	the Banbury bargeman	6957	“ I could n’t . My arm was in a sling ; could n’t even take the drag down,—a brute of a mare of mine had fell with me only two days before , out with the Abingdon , and I thought my arm was broke . Well , sir , I could n’t finish him , but Bob had his coat off at once — he stood up to the Banbury man for three minutes , and polished him off in four rounds , easy . Gad , how he did drop , sir , and what was it ? Blood , sir , all blood . ”

The King took notice of her yesterday at the Tuileries , and we are all jealous of the attention which Monsieur pays her . If you could have seen the spite of a certain stupid Miladi Bareacres , ( whose eagle - beak and toque and feathers may be seen peering over the heads of all assemblies , ) when Madame , the Duchess of Angoulême , the august daughter and companion of kings , desired especially to be presented to Mrs. Crawley , as your dear daughter and protégée , and thanked her in the name of France , for all your benevolence towards our unfortunates during their exile ! She is of all the societies , of all the balls — of the balls — yes — of the dances , no ; and yet how interesting and pretty this fair creature looks surrounded by the homage of the men , and so soon to be a mother ! To hear her speak of you , her protectress , her mother , would bring tears to the eyes of ogres . How she loves you ! how we all love our admirable , our respectable Miss Crawley ! ”

All the rage in the world wo n’t get us your aunt ’s money ; and it is much better that we should be friends with your brother ’s family than enemies , as those foolish Butes are . When your father dies , Queen ’s Crawley will be a pleasant house for you and me to pass the winter in .

I should n’t miss it much , out of five thousand a - year . I could even drive out ten miles to dine at a neighbour ’s , and dress in the fashions of the year before last . I could go to church and keep awake in the great family pew : or go to sleep behind the curtains , with my veil down , if I only had practice . I could pay everybody , if I had but the money .

221693	221712	221713	221713	Fred	701	“ Fred might take it , and welcome , or leave it , and go and be hanged . ”
221806	221826	221827	221827	she	908	“ I always told you , Maria , that it was your money he loved , and not you , ”
221851	221913	221843	221843	he	956	” replied Maria , tossing up her head . The rupture was , however , only temporary . Fred ’s father and senior partners counselled him to take Maria , even with the twenty thousand settled , half down , and half at the death of Mr. Osborne , with the chances of the further division of the property . So he “
221917	221991	221843	221843	he	956	” again to use his own phrase ; and sent old Hulker with peaceable overtures to Osborne . It was his father , he said , who would not hear of the match , and had made the difficulties ; he was most anxious to keep the engagement . The excuse was sulkily accepted by Mr. Osborne . Hulker and Bullock were a high family of the City aristocracy , and connected with the “
221993	222012	222013	222014	My son	4527	” at the West End . It was something for the old man to be able to say , “
222052	222063	222047	222049	the Earl of	9398	” In his imagination he saw his house peopled by the “
222066	222114	222047	222049	the Earl of	9398	” So he forgave young Bullock , and consented that the marriage should take place . It was a grand affair — the bridegroom ’s relatives giving the breakfast , their habitations being near St. George ’s , Hanover Square , where the business took place . The “
222120	222469	222536	222536	she	1446	” were invited , and many of them signed the book . Mr. Mango and Lady Mary Mango were there , with the dear young Gwendoline and Guinever Mango as bridesmaids ; Colonel Bludyer of the Dragoon Guards ( eldest son of the house of Bludyer Brothers , Mincing Lane ) , another cousin of the bridegroom , and the Honourable Mrs. Bludyer ; the Honourable George Boulter , Lord Levant ’s son , and his lady , Miss Mango that was ; Lord Viscount Castletoddy ; Honourable James McMull and Mrs. McMull ( formerly Miss Swartz ) , and a host of fashionables , who have all married into Lombard Street , and done a great deal to ennoble Cornhill . The young couple had a house near Berkeley Square , and a small villa at Roehampton , among the banking colony there . Fred was considered to have made rather a mésalliance by the ladies of his family , whose grandfather had been in a Charity School , and who were allied through the husbands with some of the best blood in England . And Maria was bound , by superior pride and great care in the composition of her visiting - book , to make up for the defects of birth ; and felt it her duty to see her father and sister as little as possible . That she should utterly break with the old man , who had still so many scores of thousand pounds to give away , is absurd to suppose . Fred Bullock would never allow her to do that . But she was still young and incapable of hiding her feelings : and by inviting her papa and sister to her thirdrate parties , and behaving very coldly to them when they came , and by avoiding Russell Square , and indiscreetly begging her father to quit that odious vulgar place ; she did more harm than all Frederick ’s diplomacy could repair , and perilled her chance of her inheritance like a giddy heedless creature as she was . “
222483	222513	222478	222479	Mrs. Maria	1446	” said the old gentleman , rattling up the carriage - windows as he and his daughter drove away one night from Mrs. Frederick Bullock ’s , after dinner . “
222716	222819	222703	222703	I	0	” and he sank back into the corner with a furious laugh . With such reflections on his own superior merit , it was the custom of the old gentleman not unfrequently to console himself . Jane Osborne could not but concur in these opinions respecting her sister ’s conduct ; and when Mrs. Frederick ’s first - born , Frederick Augustus Howard Stanley Devereux Bullock , was born , old Osborne , who was invited to the christening and to be godfather , contented himself with sending the child a gold cup , with twenty guineas inside it for the nurse . “
222835	222923	222831	222831	I	0	” he said , and refused to attend at the ceremony . The splendour of the gift , however , caused great satisfaction to the house of Bullock . Maria thought that her father was very much pleased with her , and Frederick augured the best for his little son and heir . One can fancy the pangs with which Miss Osborne in her solitude in Russell Square read the Morning Post , where her sister ’s name occurred every now and then , in the articles headed “
222927	223431	222831	222831	I	0	” and where she had an opportunity of reading a description of Mrs. F. Bullock ’s costume , when presented at the Drawing - room by Lady Frederica Bullock . Jane ’s own life , as we have said , admitted of no such grandeur . It was an awful existence . She had to get up of black winter ’s mornings to make breakfast for her scowling old father , who would have turned the whole house out of doors if his tea had not been ready at half - past eight . She remained silent opposite to him , listening to the urn hissing , and sitting in tremor while the parent read his paper , and consumed his accustomed portion of muffins and tea . At half - past nine he rose and went to the City , and she was almost free till dinner - time , to make visitations in the kitchen , and to scold the servants : to drive abroad and descend upon the tradesmen , who were prodigiously respectful : to leave her cards and her papa ’s at the great glum respectable houses of their City friends ; or to sit alone in the large drawingroom , expecting visitors ; and working at a huge piece of worsted by the fire , on the sofa , hard by the great Iphigenia clock , which ticked and tolled with mournful loudness in the dreary room . The great glass over the mantel - piece , faced by the other great console glass at the opposite end of the room , increased and multiplied between them the brown Holland bag in which the chandelier hung ; until you saw these brown Holland bags fading away in endless perspectives , and this apartment of Miss Osborne ’s seemed the centre of a system of drawing - rooms . When she removed the cordovan leather from the grand piano , and ventured to play a few notes on it , it sounded with a mournful sadness , startling the dismal echoes of the house . George ’s picture was gone , and laid upstairs in a lumber - room in the garret ; and though there was a consciousness of him , and father and daughter often instinctively knew that they were thinking of him , no mention was ever made of the brave and once darling son . At five o’clock Mr. Osborne came back to his dinner , which he and his daughter took in silence ( seldom broken , except when he swore and was savage , if the cooking was not to his liking ) , or which they shared twice in a month with a party of dismal friends of Osborne ’s rank and age . Old Dr. Gulp and his lady from Bloomsbury Square : old Mr. Frowser , the attorney , from Bedford Row , a very great man , and from his business , hand - in - glove with the “
223438	224139	222831	222831	I	0	” old Colonel Livermore , of the Bombay Army , and Mrs. Livermore , from Upper Bedford Place : old Serjeant Toffy and Mrs. Toffy ; and sometimes old Sir Thomas Coffin and Lady Coffin , from Bedford Square . Sir Thomas was celebrated as a hanging judge , and the particular tawny port was produced when he dined with Mr. Osborne . These people and their like gave the pompous Russell Square merchant pompous dinners back again . They had solemn rubbers of whist , when they went upstairs after drinking , and their carriages were called at half - past ten . Many rich people , whom we poor devils are in the habit of envying , lead contentedly an existence like that above described . Jane Osborne scarcely ever met a man under sixty , and almost the only bachelor who appeared in their society was Mr. Smirk , the celebrated ladies ’ doctor . I ca n’t say that nothing had occurred to disturb the monotony of this awful existence : the fact is , there had been a secret in poor Jane ’s life which had made her father more savage and morose than even nature , pride , and over - feeding had made him . This secret was connected with Miss Wirt , who had a cousin an artist , Mr. Smee , very celebrated since as a portrait - painter and R.A. , but who once was glad enough to give drawing - lessons to ladies of fashion . Mr. Smee has forgotten where Russell Square is now , but he was glad enough to visit it in the year 1818 , when Miss Osborne had instruction from him . Smee ( formerly a pupil of Sharpe of Frith Street , a dissolute , irregular , and unsuccessful man , but a man with great knowledge of his art ) being the cousin of Miss Wirt , we say , and introduced by her to Miss Osborne , whose hand and heart were still free after various incomplete love affairs , felt a great attachment for this lady , and it is believed inspired one in her bosom . Miss Wirt was the confidante of this intrigue . I know not whether she used to leave the room where the master and his pupil were painting , in order to give them an opportunity for exchanging those vows and sentiments which can not be uttered advantageously in the presence of a third party : I know not whether she hoped that should her cousin succeed in carrying off the rich merchant ’s daughter , he would give Miss Wirt a portion of the wealth which she had enabled him to win — all that is certain is , that Mr. Osborne got some hint of the transaction , came back from the City abruptly , and entered the drawing - room with his bamboo cane ; found the painter , the pupil , and the companion all looking exceedingly pale there ; turned the former out of doors with menaces that he would break every bone in his skin , and half - an - hour afterwards dismissed Miss Wirt likewise , kicking her trunks down the stairs , trampling on her band - boxes , and shaking his fist at her hackney coach , as it bore her away . Jane Osborne kept her bedroom for many days . She was not allowed to have a companion afterwards . Her father swore to her that she should not have a shilling of his money if she made any match without his concurrence ; and as he wanted a woman to keep his house , he did not choose that she should marry : so that she was obliged to give up all projects with which Cupid had any share . During her papa ’s life , then , she resigned herself to the manner of existence here described , and was content to be an Old Maid . Her sister , meanwhile , was having children with finer names every year — and the intercourse between the two grew fainter continually . “
224153	224158	224142	224142	I	0	” Mrs. Bullock said . “
224167	224849	224163	224164	a sister	15402	course”—which means — what does it mean when a lady says that she regards Jane as a sister ? It has been described how the Misses Dobbin lived with their father at a fine villa at Denmark Hill , where there were beautiful graperies and peach - trees which delighted little Georgy Osborne . The Misses Dobbin , who drove often to Brompton to see our dear Amelia , came sometimes to Russell Square too , to pay a visit to their old acquaintance Miss Osborne . I believe it was in consequence of the commands of their brother the Major in India ( for whom their papa had a prodigious respect ) , that they paid attention to Mrs. George ; for the Major , the godfather and guardian of Amelia ’s little boy , still hoped that the child ’s grandfather might be induced to relent towards him , and acknowledge him for the sake of his son . The Misses Dobbin kept Miss Osborne acquainted with the state of Amelia ’s affairs ; how she was living with her father and mother ; how poor they were ; how they wondered what men , and such men as their brother and dear Captain Osborne , could find in such an insignificant little chit ; how she was still , as heretofore , a namby - pamby milk - and - water affected creature — but how the boy was really the noblest little boy ever seen — for the hearts of all women warm towards young children , and the sourest spinster is kind to them . One day , after great entreaties on the part of the Misses Dobbin , Amelia allowed little George to go and pass a day with them at Denmark Hill — a part of which day she spent herself in writing to the Major in India . She congratulated him on the happy news which his sisters had just conveyed to her . She prayed for his prosperity , and that of the bride he had chosen . She thanked him for a thousand thousand kind offices and proofs of steadfast friendship to her in her affliction . She told him the last news about little Georgy , and how he was gone to spend that very day with his sisters in the country . She underlined the letter a great deal , and she signed herself affectionately his friend , Amelia Osborne . She forgot to send any message of kindness to Lady O’Dowd , as her wo nt was — and did not mention Glorvina by name , and only in italics , as the Major ’s bride , for whom she begged blessings . But the news of the marriage removed the reserve which she had kept up towards him . She was glad to be able to own and feel how warmly and gratefully she regarded him — and as for the idea of being jealous of Glorvina , ( Glorvina , indeed ! ) Amelia would have scouted it , if an angel from heaven had hinted it to her . That night , when Georgy came back in the pony - carriage in which he rejoiced , and in which he was driven by Sir Wm . Dobbin ’s old coachman , he had round his neck a fine gold chain and watch . He said an old lady , not pretty , had given it him , who cried and kissed him a great deal . But he did n’t like her . He liked grapes very much . And he only liked his mamma . Amelia shrank and started : the timid soul felt a presentiment of terror when she heard that the relations of the child ’s father had seen him . Miss Osborne came back to give her father his dinner . He had made a good speculation in the City , and was rather in a good humour that day , and chanced to remark the agitation under which she laboured . “
224858	224870	224855	224856	Miss Osborne	908	” he deigned to say . The woman burst into tears . “
224875	224879	224873	224873	sir	15428	” she said , “
224899	225816	224897	224897	him	1045	” The old man opposite to her did not say a word , but flushed up , and began to tremble in every limb . THE ASTONISHED reader must be called upon to transport himself ten thousand miles to the military station of Bundlegunge , in the Madras division of our Indian empire , where our gallant old friends of the — th regiment are quartered under the command of the brave Colonel , Sir Michael O’Dowd . Time has dealt kindly with that stout officer , as it does ordinarily with men who have good stomachs and good tempers , and are not perplexed over much by fatigue of the brain . The Colonel plays a good knife and fork at tiffin , and resumes those weapons with great success at dinner . He smokes his hookah after both meals , and puffs as quietly while his wife scolds him , as he did under the fire of the French at Waterloo . Age and heat have not diminished the activity or the eloquence of the descendant of the Malonys and the Molloys . Her Ladyship , our old acquaintance , is as much at home at Madras as at Brussels — in the cantonment as under the tents . On the march you saw her at the head of the regiment seated on a royal elephant , a noble sight . Mounted on that beast , she has been into action with tigers in the jungle : she has been received by native princes , who have welcomed her and Glorvina into the recesses of their zenanas and offered her shawls and jewels which it went to her heart to refuse . The sentries of all arms salute her wherever she makes her appearance : and she touches her hat gravely to their salutation . Lady O’Dowd is one of the greatest ladies in the Presidency of Madras — her quarrel with Lady Smith , wife of Sir Minos Smith the puisne judge , is still remembered by some at Madras when the Colonel ’s lady snapped her fingers in the Judge ’s lady ’s face , and said she ’d never walk behind ever a beggarly civilian . Even now , though it is five - and - twenty years ago , people remember Lady O’Dowd performing a jig at Government House , where she danced down two Aides - de - Camp , a Major of Madras cavalry , and two gentlemen of the Civil Service ; and , persuaded by Major Dobbin , C.B. , second in command of the — th , to retire to the supper - room , lassata nondum satiata recessit . Peggy O’Dowd is indeed the same as ever : kind in act and thought : impetuous in temper ; eager to command : a tyrant over her Michael : a dragon amongst all the ladies of the regiment : a mother to all the young men , whom she tends in their sickness , defends in all their scrapes , and with whom Lady Peggy is immensely popular . But the Subalterns ’ and Captains ’ ladies ( the Major is unmarried ) cabal against her a good deal . They say that Glorvina gives herself airs , and that Peggy herself is intolerably domineering . She interfered with a little congregation which Mrs. Kirk had got up , and laughed the young men away from her sermons , stating that a soldier ’s wife had no business to be a parson : that Mrs. Kirk would be much better mending her husband ’s clothes : and , if the regiment wanted sermons , that she had the finest in the world , those of her uncle , the Dean . She abruptly put a termination to a flirtation which Lieutenant Stubble of the regiment had commenced with the Surgeon ’s wife , threatening to come down upon Stubble for the money which he had borrowed from her ( for the young fellow was still of an extravagant turn ) unless he broke off at once and went to the Cape , on sick leave . On the other hand , she housed and sheltered Mrs. Posky , who fled from her bungalow one night , pursued by her infuriate husband , wielding his second brandy bottle , and actually carried Posky through the delirium tremens , and broke him of the habit of drinking , which had grown upon that officer , as all evil habits will grow upon men . In a word , in adversity she was the best of comforters , in good fortune the most troublesome of friends ; having a perfectly good opinion of herself always , and an indomitable resolution to have her own way . Among other points , she had made up her mind that Glorvina should marry our old friend Dobbin . Mrs. O’Dowd knew the Major ’s expectations and appreciated his good qualities , and the high character which he enjoyed in his profession . Glorvina , a very handsome , fresh - coloured black - haired , blue - eyed young lady , who could ride a horse , or play a sonata with any girl out of the County Cork , seemed to be the very person destined to insure Dobbin ’s happiness — much more than that poor good little weak - spur’ted Amelia , about whom he used to take on so.—“Look
225823	225829	224897	224897	him	1045	” Mrs. O’Dowd would say , “
225909	226617	225893	225893	she	1175	” But before she had come to such a resolution , and determined to subjugate Major Dobbin by her endearments , it must be owned that Glorvina had practised them a good deal elsewhere . She had had a season in Dublin , and who knows how many in Cork , Killarney , and Mallow ? She had flirted with all the marriageable officers whom the depôts of her country afforded , and all the bachelor squires who seemed eligible . She had been engaged to be married a half score times in Ireland , besides the clergyman at Bath who used her so ill . She had flirted all the way to Madras with the Captain and chief - mate of the Ramchunder East Indiaman , and had a season at the Presidency with her brother and Mrs. O’Dowd , who was staying there , while the Major of the regiment was in command at the station . Everybody admired her there : everybody danced with her : but no one proposed who was worth the marrying ; one or two exceedingly young subalterns sighed after her , and a beardless civilian or two ; but she rejected these as beneath her pretensions ; and other and younger virgins than Glorvina were married before her . There are women , and handsome women too , who have this fortune in life . They fall in love with the utmost generosity ; they ride and walk with half the Army - list , though they draw near to forty , and yet the Misses O’Grady are the Misses O’Grady still : Glorvina persisted that but for Lady O’Dowd ’s unlucky quarrel with the Judge ’s lady , she would have made a good match at Madras , where old Mr. Chutney , who was at the head of the civil service ( and who afterwards married Miss Dolby , a young lady only thirteen years of age , who had just arrived from school in Europe ) , was just at the point of proposing to her . Well , although Lady O’Dowd and Glorvina quarrelled a great number of times every day , and upon almost every conceivable subject — indeed , if Mick O’Dowd had not possessed the temper of an angel two such women constantly about his ears would have driven him out of his senses — yet they agreed between themselves on this point , that Glorvina should marry Major Dobbin , and were determined that the Major should have no rest until the arrangement was brought about . Undismayed by forty or fifty previous defeats , Glorvina laid siege to him . She sang Irish Melodies at him unceasingly . She asked him so frequently and pathetically , Will ye come to the bower ? that it is a wonder how any man of feeling could have resisted the invitation . She was never tired of inquiring , if Sorrow had his young days faded ; and was ready to listen and weep like Desdemona at the stories of his dangers and campaigns . It has been said that our honest and dear old friend used to perform on the flute in private : Glorvina insisted upon having duets with him , and Lady O’Dowd would rise and artlessly quit the room , when the young couple were so engaged . Glorvina forced the Major to ride with her of mornings . The whole cantonment saw them set out and return . She was constantly writing notes over to him at his house , borrowing his books , and scoring with her great pencil - marks such passages of sentiment or humour as awakened her sympathy . She borrowed his horses , his servants , his spoons , and palankin;—no wonder that public rumour assigned her to him , and that the Major ’s sisters in England should fancy they were about to have a sister - in - law . Dobbin , who was thus vigorously besieged , was in the meanwhile in a state of the most odious tranquillity . He used to laugh when the young fellows of the regiment joked him about Glorvina ’s manifest attentions to him . “
226620	226624	226625	226625	she	9427	” said he , “
226673	226806	226671	226671	Glorvina	1175	” And so he went on riding with her , and copying music and verses into her albums , and playing at chess with her very submissively ; for it is with these simple amusements that some officers in India are accustomed to while away their leisure moments ; while others of a less domestic turn hunt hogs , and shoot snipes , or gamble and smoke cheroots , and betake themselves to brandy - and - water . As for Sir Michael O’Dowd , though his lady and her sister both urged him to call upon the Major to explain himself , and not keep on torturing a poor innocent girl in that shameful way , the old soldier refused point - blank to have anything to do with the conspiracy . “
226819	226824	226825	226825	he	18559	” Sir Michael said ; “
226832	226844	226825	226825	he	18559	ye;”—or else he would turn the matter off jocularly , declaring that “
226864	226887	226859	226859	lave	9434	” Nay , he went farther , and in private communications with his Major , would caution and rally him — crying , “
226946	227362	227363	227363	Your	9441	” But the truth is , neither beauty nor fashion could conquer him . Our honest friend had but one idea of a woman in his head , and that one did not in the least resemble Miss Glorvina O’Dowd in pink satin . A gentle little woman in black , with large eyes and brown hair , seldom speaking save when spoken to , and then in a voice not the least resembling Miss Glorvina’s — a soft young mother tending an infant and beckoning the Major up with a smile to look at him — a rosy - cheeked lass coming singing into the room in Russell Square or hanging on George Osborne ’s arm , happy and loving — there was but this image that filled our honest Major ’s mind by day and by night , and reigned over it always . Very likely Amelia was not like the portrait the Major had formed of her : there was a figure in a book of fashions which his sisters had in England , and with which William had made away privately , pasting it into the lid of his desk , and fancying he saw some resemblance to Mrs. Osborne in the print , whereas I have seen it , and can vouch that it is but the picture of a high - waisted gown with an impossible doll ’s face simpering over it — and , perhaps , Mr. Dobbin ’s sentimental Amelia was no more like the real one than this absurd little print which he cherished . But what man in love , of us , is better informed?—or is he much happier when he sees and owns his delusion ? Dobbin was under this spell . He did not bother his friends and the public much about his feelings , or indeed lose his natural rest or appetite on account of them . His head has grizzled since we saw him last ; and a line or two of silver may be seen in the soft brown hair likewise . But his feelings are not in the least changed or oldened ; and his love remains as fresh as a man ’s recollections of boyhood are . We have said how the two Misses Dobbin and Amelia , the Major ’s correspondents in Europe , wrote him letters from England ; Mrs. Osborne congratulating him with great candour and cordiality upon his approaching nuptials with Miss O’Dowd . “
227371	227378	227363	227363	Your	9441	” Amelia wrote in her letter , “
227534	227838	227839	227840	O Amelia	632	” The letter , which has been before alluded to , went on in this strain , protesting throughout as to the extreme satisfaction of the writer . This letter , which arrived by the very same ship which brought out Lady O’Dowd ’s box of millinery from London ( and which you may be sure Dobbin opened before any one of the other packets which the mail brought him ) , put the receiver into such a state of mind that Glorvina , and her pink satin , and everything belonging to her , became perfectly odious to him . The Major cursed the talk of women ; and the sex in general . Everything annoyed him that day — the parade was insufferably hot and wearisome . Good heavens ! was a man of intellect to waste his life , day after day , inspecting cross - belts , and putting fools through their manœuvres ? The senseless chatter of the young men at mess was more than ever jarring . What cared he , a man on the high road to forty , to know how many snipes Lieutenant Smith had shot , or what were the performances of Ensign Brown ’s mare ? The jokes about the table filled him with shame . He was too old to listen to the banter of the assistant - surgeon and the slang of the youngsters , at which old O’Dowd , with his bald head and red face , laughed quite easily . The old man had listened to those jokes any time these thirty years — Dobbin himself had been fifteen years hearing them . And after the boisterous dulness of the messtable , the quarrels and scandal of the ladies of the regiment ! It was unbearable , shameful . “
227844	227848	227849	227849	you	632	” he thought , “
227904	228008	227899	227902	this flaunting Irish girl	9449	” Sick and sorry felt poor William : more than ever wretched and lonely . He would like to have done with life and its vanity altogether — so bootless and unsatisfactory the struggle , so cheerless and dreary the prospect seemed to him . He lay all that night sleepless , and yearning to go home . Amelia ’s letter had fallen as a blank upon him . No fidelity , no constant truth and passion , could move her into warmth . She would not see that he loved her . Tossing in his bed , he spoke out to her . “
228014	228018	228009	228010	Good God	655	” he said , “
228077	228528	228550	228550	he	9452	” The native servants lying outside his verandahs beheld with wonder the Major , so cold and quiet ordinarily , at present so passionately moved and cast down . Would she have pitied him had she seen him ? He read over and over all the letters which he ever had from her — letters of business relative to the little property which he had made her believe her husband had left to her — brief notes of invitation — every scrap of writing that she had ever sent to him — how cold , how kind , how hopeless , how selfish they were ! Had there been some kind gentle soul near at hand who could read and appreciate this silent generous heart , who knows but that the reign of Amelia might have been over , and that friend William ’s love might have flowed into a kinder channel ? But there was only Glorvina of the jetty ringlets with whom his intercourse was familiar , and this dashing young woman was not bent upon loving the Major , but rather on making the Major admire her — a most vain and hopeless task , too , at least considering the means that the poor girl possessed to carry it out . She curled her hair and showed her shoulders at him , as much as to say , did ye ever see such jet ringlets and such a complexion ? She grinned at him so that he might see that every tooth in her head was sound — and he never heeded all these charms . Very soon after the arrival of the box of millinery , and perhaps indeed in honour of it , Lady O’Dowd and the ladies of the King ’s Regiment gave a ball to the Company ’s Regiments and the civilians at the station . Glorvina sported the killing pink frock , and the Major , who attended the party and walked very ruefully up and down the rooms , never so much as perceived the pink garment . Glorvina danced past him in a fury with all the young subalterns of the station , and the Major was not in the least jealous of her performance , or angry because Captain Bangles of the Cavalry handed her to supper . It was not jealousy , or frocks or shoulders , that could move him , and Glorvina had nothing more . So these two were each exemplifying the Vanity of this life , and each longing for what he or she could not get . Glorvina cried with rage at the failure . She had set her mind on the Major “
228537	228543	228544	228544	He	9452	” she owned , sobbing . “
228555	228572	228550	228550	he	9452	” she would whimper to her sister - in - law when they were good friends ; “
228593	228788	228790	228790	William	1326	” Fat or thin , laughing or melancholy , on horseback or the music - stool , it was all the same to the Major . And the Colonel , puffing his pipe and listening to these complaints , would suggest that Glory should have some black frocks out in the next box from London , and told a mysterious story of a lady in Ireland who died of grief for the loss of her husband before she got ere a one . While the Major was going on in this tantalizing way , not proposing , and declining to fall in love , there came another ship from Europe bringing letters on board , and amongst them some more for the heartless man . These were home letters bearing an earlier post - mark than that of the former packets , and as Major Dobbin recognised among his the handwriting of his sister , who always crossed and recrossed her letters to her brother,—gathered together all the possible bad news which she could collect , abused him and read him lectures with sisterly frankness , and always left him miserable for the day after “
228791	228881	228882	228882	he	1326	” had achieved the perusal of one of her epistles — the truth must be told that dearest William did not hurry himself to break the seal of Miss Dobbin ’s letter , but waited for a particularly favourable day and mood for doing so . A fortnight before , he had written to scold her for telling those absurd stories to Mrs. Osborne , and had despatched a letter in reply to that lady , undeceiving her with respect to the reports concerning him , and assuring her that “
228894	229219	228882	228882	he	1326	” Two or three nights after the arrival of the second package of letters , the Major had passed the evening pretty cheerfully at Lady O’Dowd ’s house , where Glorvina thought that he listened with rather more attention than usual to the Meeting of the Wathers , the Minsthrel Boy , and one or two other specimens of song with which she favoured him ( the truth is , he was no more listening to Glorvina than to the howling of the jackals in the moonlight outside , and the delusion was hers as usual ) , and having played his game at chess with her , ( cribbage with the surgeon was Lady O’Dowd ’s favourite evening pastime , ) Major Dobbin took leave of the Colonel ’s family at his usual hour , and retired to his own house . There on his table , his sister ’s letter lay reproaching him . He took it up , ashamed rather of his negligence regarding it , and prepared himself for a disagreeable hour ’s communing with that crabbed - handed absent relative . … It may have been an hour after the Major ’s departure from the Colonel ’s house — Sir Michael was sleeping the sleep of the just ; Glorvina had arranged her black ringlets in the innumerable little bits of paper , in which it was her habit to confine them ; Lady O’Dowd , too , had gone to her bed in the nuptial chamber , on the ground - floor , and had tucked her musquito curtains round her fair form , when the guard at the gates of the Commanding - officer ’s compound , beheld Major Dobbin , in the moonlight , rushing towards the house with a swift step and a very agitated countenance , and he passed the sentinel and went up to the windows of the Colonel ’s bed - chamber . “
229224	229235	229222	229222	Colonel	9453	” said Dobbin , and kept up a great shouting . “
229240	229259	229238	229238	Meejor	1166	” said Glorvina of the curl - papers , putting out her head too , from her window . “
229269	229294	229295	229295	I	0	” said the Colonel , expecting there was a fire in the station , or that the route had come from head - quarters . “
229317	229321	229304	229304	I	0	” Dobbin said . “
229329	229339	229340	229340	I	0	” thought Glorvina , trembling with all the papillotes . “
229352	229392	229340	229340	I	0	” Dobbin continued ; and the Colonel getting up , came out to parley with him . In the postscript of Miss Dobbin ’s cross - letter , the Major had just come upon a paragraph , to the following effect:—“I
229634	230101	229631	229632	Ann Dobbin	1046	” OUR old friends the Crawleys ’ family house , in Great Gaunt Street , still bore over its front the hatchment which had been placed there as a token of mourning for Sir Pitt Crawley ’s demise , yet this heraldic emblem was in itself a very splendid and gaudy piece of furniture , and all the rest of the mansion became more brilliant than it had ever been during the late baronet ’s reign . The black outer coating of the bricks was removed , and they appeared with a cheerful , blushing face streaked with white : the old bronze lions of the knocker were gilt handsomely , the railings painted and the dismallest house in Great Gaunt Street became the smartest in the whole quarter , before the green leaves in Hampshire had replaced those yellowing ones which were on the trees in Queen ’s Crawley avenue when old Sir Pitt Crawley passed under them for the last time . A little woman , with a carriage to correspond , was perpetually seen about this mansion ; an elderly spinster , accompanied by a little boy , also might be remarked coming thither daily . It was Miss Briggs and little Rawdon , whose business it was to see to the inward renovation of Sir Pitt ’s house , to superintend the female band engaged in stitching the blinds and hangings , to poke and rummage in the drawers and cupboards crammed with the dirty relics and congregated trumperies of a couple of generations of Lady Crawleys , and to take inventories of the china , the glass , and other properties in the closets and store - rooms . Mrs. Rawdon Crawley was general - in - chief over these arrangements , with full orders from Sir Pitt to sell , barter , confiscate , or purchase furniture ; and she enjoyed herself not a little in an occupation which gave full scope to her taste and ingenuity . The renovation of the house was determined upon when Sir Pitt came to town in November to see his lawyers , and when he passed nearly a week in Curzon Street , under the roof of his affectionate brother and sister . He had put up at an hotel at first ; but , Becky , as soon as she heard of the Baronet ’s arrival , went off alone to greet him , and returned in an hour to Curzon Street with Sir Pitt in the carriage by her side . It was impossible sometimes to resist this artless little creature ’s hospitalities , so kindly were they pressed , so frankly and amiably offered . Becky seized Pitt ’s hand in a transport of gratitude when he agreed to come . “
230105	230126	230103	230103	you	9479	” she said , squeezing it , and looking into the Baronet ’s eyes , who blushed a good deal ; “
230134	230205	230132	230132	Rawdon	794	” She bustled up to Pitt ’s bedroom , leading on the servants , who were carrying his trunks thither . She came in herself laughing , with a coal - scuttle out of her own room . A fire was blazing already in Sir Pitt ’s apartment ( it was Miss Briggs ’s room , by the way , who was sent upstairs to sleep with the maid ) . “
230213	230282	230206	230206	I	0	” she said , with pleasure beaming in her glance . Indeed , she was really sincerely happy at having him for a guest . Becky made Rawdon dine out once or twice on business , while Pitt stayed with them , and the Baronet passed the happy evening alone with her and Briggs . She went downstairs to the kitchen and actually cooked little dishes for him . “
230290	230294	230295	230295	I	0	” she said ; “
230319	230320	230301	230301	I	0	” “
230329	230336	230325	230325	you	0	” said the Baronet , gallantly . “
230343	230344	230345	230347	A poor man	9481	” “
230351	230357	230345	230347	A poor man	9481	” Rebecca replied , gaily , “
230366	230377	230360	230360	herself	9482	” on which her brother - in - law vowed that “
230409	230904	230905	230905	I	0	” And Sir Pitt thought , with something like mortification , of Lady Jane at home , and of a certain pie which she had insisted on making , and serving to him at dinner — a most abominable pie . Besides the salmi , which was made of Lord Steyne ’s pheasants from his lordship ’s cottage of Stillbrook , Becky gave her brother - in - law a bottle of white wine , some that Rawdon had brought with him from France , and had picked up for nothing , the little story - teller said ; whereas the liquor was , in truth , some White Hermitage from the Marquis of Steyne ’s famous cellars , which brought fire into the Baronet ’s pallid cheeks and a glow into his feeble frame . Then when he had drunk up the bottle of petit vin blanc , she gave him her hand and took him up to the drawing - room , and made him snug on the sofa by the fire , and let him talk as she listened with the tenderest kindly interest , sitting by him , and hemming a shirt for her dear little boy . Whenever Mrs. Rawdon wished to be particularly humble and virtuous , this little shirt used to come out of her work - box . It had got to be too small for Rawdon long before it was finished . Well , Rebecca listened to Pitt , she talked to him , she sang to him , she coaxed him , and cuddled him , so that he found himself more and more glad every day to get back from the lawyer ’s at Gray ’s Inn , to the blazing fire in Curzon Street — a gladness in which the men of law likewise participated , for Pitt ’s harangues were of the longest — and so that when he went away he felt quite a pang at departing . How pretty she looked kissing her hand to him from the carriage and waving her handkerchief when he had taken his place in the mail ! She put the handkerchief to her eyes once . He pulled his sealskin cap over his , as the coach drove away , and , sinking back , he thought to himself how she respected him and how he deserved it , and how Rawdon was a foolish dull fellow who did n’t half appreciate his wife : and how mum and stupid his own wife was compared to that brilliant little Becky . Becky had hinted every one of these things herself , perhaps , but so delicately and gently , that you hardly knew when or where . And , before they parted , it was agreed that the house in London should be redecorated for the next season , and that the brothers ’ families should meet again in the country at Christmas . “
230918	230931	230907	230907	you	9486	” Rawdon said to his wife moodily when the Baronet was gone . “
230986	230987	230989	230989	him	9487	” “
230991	230995	230989	230989	him	9487	” said Becky , “
231032	232576	231026	231026	Pitt	697	” and she took from her bag and gave her husband a paper which his brother had handed over to her , on behalf of the little son and heir of the younger branch of the Crawleys . The truth is , she had tried personally the ground on which her husband expressed a wish that she should venture — tried it ever so delicately , and found it unsafe . Even at a hint about embarrassments , Sir Pitt Crawley was off and alarmed . And he began a long speech , explaining how straitened he himself was in money matters ; how the tenants would not pay ; how his father ’s affairs , and the expenses attendant upon the demise of the old gentleman , had involved him ; how he wanted to pay off incumbrances ; and how the bankers and agents were overdrawn ; and Pitt Crawley ended by making a compromise with his sister - in - law , and giving her a very small sum for the benefit of her little boy . Pitt knew how poor his brother and his brother ’s family must be . It could not have escaped the notice of such a cool and experienced old diplomatist , that Rawdon ’s family had nothing to live upon , and that houses and carriages are not to be kept for nothing . He knew very well that he was the proprietor or appropriator of the money , which , according to all proper calculation , ought to have fallen to his younger brother , and he had , we may be sure , some secret pangs of remorse within him , which warned him that he ought to perform some act of justice , or , let us say , compensation , towards these disappointed relations . A just , decent man , not without brains , who said his prayers , and knew his catechism , and did his duty outwardly through life , he could not be otherwise than aware that something was due to his brother at his hands , and that morally he was Rawdon ’s debtor . But , as one reads in the columns of the Times newspaper every now and then , queer announcements from the Chancellor of the Exchequer , acknowledging the receipt of £ 50 from A. B. , or £ 10 from W. T. , as conscience money , on account of taxes due by the said A. B. or W. T. , which payments the penitents beg the Right Honourable gentleman to acknowledge through the medium of the public press;—so is the Chancellor no doubt , and the reader likewise , always perfectly sure that the above - named A. B. and W. T. are only paying a very small instalment of what they really owe , and that the man who sends up a twenty - pound note has very likely hundreds or thousands more for which he ought to account . Such , at least , are my feelings , when I see A. B. or W. T. ’s insufficient acts of repentance . And I have no doubt that Pitt Crawley ’s contrition , or kindness if you will , towards his younger brother , by whom he had so much profited , was only a very small dividend upon the capital sum in which he was indebted to Rawdon . Not everybody is willing to pay even so much . To part with money is a sacrifice beyond almost all men endowed with a sense of order . There is scarcely any man alive who does not think himself meritorious for giving his neighbour five pounds . Thriftless gives , not from a beneficent pleasure in giving , but from a lazy delight in spending . He would not deny himself one enjoyment ; not his opera - stall , not his horse , not his dinner , not even the pleasure of giving Lazarus the five pounds . Thrifty , who is good , wise , just , and owes no man a penny , turns from a beggar , haggles with a hackney - coachman , or denies a poor relation , and I doubt which is the most selfish of the two . Money has only a different value in the eyes of each . So , in a word , Pitt Crawley thought he would do something for his brother , and then thought that he would think about it some other time . And with regard to Becky , she was not a woman who expected too much from the generosity of her neighbours and so was quite content with all that Pitt Crawley had done for her . She was acknowledged by the head of the family . If Pitt would not give her anything , he would get something for her some day . If she got no money from her brother - in - law , she got what was as good as money — credit . Raggles was made rather easy in his mind by the spectacle of the union between the brothers , by a small payment on the spot , and by the promise of a much larger sum speedily to be assigned to him . And Rebecca told Miss Briggs , whose Christmas dividend upon the little sum lent by her , Becky paid with an air of candid joy , and as if her exchequer was brimming over with gold — Rebecca , we say , told Miss Briggs , in strict confidence , that she had conferred with Sir Pitt , who was famous as a financier , on Briggs ’s special behalf , as to the most profitable investment of Miss B. ’s remaining capital ; that Sir Pitt , after much consideration , had thought of a most safe and advantageous way in which Briggs could lay out her money ; that , being especially interested in her as an attached friend of the late Miss Crawley , and of the whole family , and that long before he left town , he had recommended that she should be ready with the money at a moment ’s notice , so as to purchase at the most favourable opportunity the shares which Sir Pitt had in his eye . Poor Miss Briggs was very grateful for this mark of Sir Pitt ’s attention — it came so unsolicited , she said , for she never should have thought of removing the money from the funds — and the delicacy enhanced the kindness of the office ; and she promised to see her man of business immediately , and be ready with her little cash at the proper hour . And this worthy woman was so grateful for the kindness of Rebecca in the matter , and for that of her generous benefactor , the Colonel , that she went out and spent a great part of her year ’s dividend in the purchase of a black velvet coat for little Rawdon , who , by the way , was grown almost too big for black velvet now , and was of a size and age befitting him for the assumption of the virile jacket and pantaloons . He was a fine open - faced boy , with blue eyes and waving flaxen hair , sturdy in limb , but generous and soft in heart : fondly attaching himself to all who were good to him — to the pony — to Lord Southdown , who gave him the horse—(he used to blush and glow all over when he saw that kind young nobleman)—to the groom who had charge of the pony — to Molly , the cook , who crammed him with ghost stories at night , and with good things from the dinner — to Briggs , whom he plagued and laughed at — and to his father especially , whose attachment towards the lad was curious too to witness . Here , as he grew to be about eight years old , his attachments may be said to have ended . The beautiful mother - vision had faded away after a while . During near two years she had scarcely spoken to the child . She disliked him . He had the measles and the hooping - cough . He bored her . One day when he was standing at the landing - place , having crept down from the upper regions , attracted by the sound of his mother ’s voice , who was singing to Lord Steyne , the drawing - room door opening suddenly , discovered the little spy , who but a moment before had been rapt in delight , and listening to the music . His mother came out and struck him violently a couple of boxes on the ear . He heard a laugh from the Marquis in the inner room ( who was amused by this free and artless exhibition of Becky ’s temper ) , and fled down below to his friends of the kitchen , bursting in an agony of grief . “
232585	232589	231026	231026	Pitt	697	” little Rawdon gasped out—“only
232591	232613	231026	231026	Pitt	697	only”—sobs and tears wound up the sentence in a storm . It was the little boy ’s heart that was bleeding . “
232645	233179	232632	232632	she	9493	” He gasped out at various intervals these exclamations of rage and grief . The cook looked at the housemaid : the housemaid looked knowingly at the footman — the awful kitchen inquisition which sits in judgment in every house , and knows everything,—sate on Rebecca at that moment . After this incident , the mother ’s dislike increased to hatred : the consciousness that the child was in the house was a reproach and a pain to her . His very sight annoyed her . Fear , doubt , and resistance sprang up , too , in the boy ’s own bosom . They were separated from that day of the boxes on the ear . Lord Steyne also heartily disliked the boy . When they met by mischance , he made sarcastic bows or remarks to the child , or glared at him with savage - looking eyes . Rawdon used to stare him in the face , and double his little fists in return . He knew his enemy ; and this gentleman , of all who came to the house , was the one who angered him most . One day the footman found him squaring his fists at Lord Steyne ’s hat in the hall . The footman told the circumstance as a good joke to Lord Steyne ’s coachman ; that officer imparted it to Lord Steyne ’s gentleman , and to the servants ’ hall in general . And very soon afterwards , when Mrs. Rawdon Crawley made her appearance at Gaunt House , the porter who unbarred the gates , the servants of all uniforms in the hall , the functionaries in white waistcoats , who bawled out from landing to landing the names of Colonel and Mrs. Rawdon Crawley , knew about her , or fancied they did . The man who brought her refreshment and stood behind her chair , had talked her character over with the large gentleman in motley - coloured clothes at his side . Bon Dieu ! it is awful , that servants ’ inquisition ! You see a woman in a great party in a splendid saloon , surrounded by faithful admirers , distributing sparkling glances , dressed to perfection , curled , rouged , smiling and happy:—Discovery walks respectfully up to her , in the shape of a huge powdered man with large calves and a tray of ices — with Calumny ( which is as fatal as truth)—behind him , in the shape of the hulking fellow carrying the wafer - biscuits . Madam , your secret will be talked over by those men at their club at the public - house to - night . Jeames will tell Chawles his nations about you over their pipes and pewter beer - pots . Some people ought to have mutes for servants in Vanity Fair — mutes who could not write . If you are guilty , tremble . That fellow behind your chair may be a Janissary with a bow - string in his plush breeches pocket . If you are not guilty , have a care of appearances : which are as ruinous as guilt . “
233186	233249	233181	233181	Rebecca	630	” the Vehmgericht of the servants ’ hall had pronounced against her . And , I shame to say , she would not have got credit had they not believed her to be guilty . It was the sight of the Marquis of Steyne ’s carriage - lamps at her door , contemplated by Raggles , burning in the blackness of midnight , “
233255	233288	233181	233181	Rebecca	630	” as he afterwards said ; that even more than Rebecca ’s arts and coaxings . And so — guiltless very likely — she was writhing and pushing onward towards what they call “
233294	233434	233181	233181	Rebecca	630	” and the servants were pointing at her as lost and ruined . So you see Molly , the housemaid , of a morning , watching a spider in the door - post lay his thread and laboriously crawl up it , until , tired of the sport , she raises her broom and sweeps away the thread and the artificer . A day or two before Christmas , Becky , her husband and her son , made ready and went to pass the holidays at the seat of their ancestors at Queen ’s Crawley . Becky would have liked to leave the little brat behind , and would have done so but for Lady Jane ’s urgent invitations to the youngster ; and the symptoms of revolt and discontent which Rawdon manifested at her neglect of her son . “
233443	233456	233435	233435	He	9496	” the father said , in a tone of reproach to her , “
233508	233509	233498	233498	he	9496	” “
233523	233528	233515	233515	you	9498	” replied Mrs. Rawdon . “
233537	233564	233565	233565	she	9498	” answered the husband . Becky laughed : she was almost always good - humoured . That was when I was on my promotion , Goosey , ”
233568	233585	233565	233565	she	9498	“ Take Rawdon outside with you , and give him a cigar too if you like . ”
233899	233915	233917	233917	Rebecca	630	flags—“It ’s the old Turkey one that used to be in the Ladies ’ Gallery , ”
233928	234186	233925	233926	Lady Jane	805	” She and Sir Pitt performed the same salute with great gravity : but Rawdon having been smoking , hung back rather from his sister - in - law , whose two children came up to their cousin : and , while Matilda held out her hand and kissed him , Pitt Binkie Southdown , the son and heir , stood aloof rather , and examined him as a little dog does a big dog . Then the kind hostess conducted her guests to the snug apartments blazing with cheerful fires . Then the young ladies came and knocked at Mrs. Rawdon ’s door , under the pretence that they were desirous to be useful , but in reality to have the pleasure of inspecting the contents of her band and bonnet - boxes , and her dresses which , though black , were of the newest London fashion . And they told her how much the Hall was changed for the better , and how old Lady Southdown was gone , and how Pitt was taking his station in the county , as became a Crawley in fact . Then the great dinner - bell having rung , the family assembled at dinner , at which meal Rawdon Junior was placed by his aunt , the good - natured lady of the house : Sir Pitt being uncommonly attentive to his sister - in - law at his own right hand . Little Rawdon exhibited a fine appetite , and showed a gentleman - like behaviour . “
234193	234263	234187	234187	I	0	” he said to his aunt when he had completed his meal , at the conclusion of which , and after a decent grace by Sir Pitt , the youngest son and heir was introduced , and was perched on a high chair by the Baronet ’s side , while the daughter took possession of the place and the little wine - glass prepared for her near her mother . “
234270	234284	234264	234264	I	0	” said Rawdon Minor , looking up at his relation ’s kind face . “
234287	234294	234295	234295	I	0	” said the good Lady Jane . “
234306	234311	234295	234295	I	0	” replied Rawdon Minor , “
234317	234574	234315	234315	Briggs	644	” But Becky was so engaged with the Baronet , her host , pouring out a flood of compliments and delights and raptures , and admiring young Pitt Binkie , whom she declared to be the most beautiful , intelligent , noble - looking little creature , and so like his father , that she did not hear the remarks of her own flesh and blood at the other end of the broad shining table . As a guest , and it being the first night of his arrival , Rawdon the Second was allowed to sit up until the hour when tea being over , and a great gilt book being laid on the table before Sir Pitt , all the domestics of the family streamed in , and Sir Pitt read prayers . It was the first time the poor little boy had ever witnessed or heard of such a ceremonial . The house had been much improved even since the Baronet ’s brief reign , and was pronounced by Becky to be perfect , charming , delightful , when she surveyed it in his company . As for little Rawdon , who examined it with the children for his guides , it seemed to him a perfect palace of enchantment and wonder . There were long galleries , and ancient state bed - rooms , there were pictures and old China , and armour . There were the rooms in which grandpapa died , and by which the children walked with terrified looks . “
234579	234734	234577	234577	grandpapa	8483	” he asked ; and they told him how he used to be very old , and used to be wheeled about in a garden - chair , and they showed him the garden - chair one day rotting in the out - house in which it had lain since the old gentleman had been wheeled away yonder to the church , of which the spire was glittering over the park elms . The brothers had good occupation for several mornings in examining the improvements which had been effected by Sir Pitt ’s genius and economy . And as they walked or rode , and looked at them , they could talk without too much boring each other . And Pitt took care to tell Rawdon what a heavy outlay of money these improvements had occasioned : and that a man of landed and funded property was often very hard pressed for twenty pounds . “
234742	234755	234756	234756	I	0	” said Pitt , pointing to it humbly with the bamboo cane , “
234773	234774	234775	234775	I	0	” “
234785	235415	234775	234775	I	0	” Rawdon answered rather ruefully ; and they went in and looked at the restored lodge , where the family arms were just new scraped in stone ; and where old Mrs. Lock , for the first time these many long years , had tight doors , sound roofs , and whole windows . SIR PITT CRAWLEY had done more than repair fences and restore dilapidated lodges on the Queen ’s Crawley estate . Like a wise man he had set to work to rebuild the injured popularity of his house , and stop up the gaps and ruins in which his name had been left by his disreputable and thriftless old predecessor . He was elected for the borough speedily after his father ’s demise ; a magistrate , a member of parliament , a county magnate and representative of an ancient family , he made it his duty to show himself before the Hampshire public , subscribed handsomely to the county charities , called assiduously upon all the county folk , and laid himself out in a word to take that position in Hampshire , and in the Empire afterwards , to which he thought his prodigious talents justly entitled him . Lady Jane was instructed to be friendly with the Fuddlestones , and the Wapshots , and the other famous baronets , their neighbours . Their carriages might frequently be seen in the Queen ’s Crawley avenue now ; they dined pretty frequently at the Hall ( where the cookery was so good , that it was clear Lady Jane very seldom had a hand in it ) , and in return Pitt and his wife most energetically dined out in all sorts of weather , and at all sorts of distances . For though Pitt did not care for joviality , being a frigid man of poor health and appetite , yet he considered that to be hospitable and condescending was quite incumbent on his station , and every time that he got a headache from too long and after - dinner sitting , he felt that he was a martyr to duty . He talked about crops , corn - laws , politics , with the best country gentlemen . He ( who had been formerly inclined to be a sad freethinker on these points ) entered into poaching and game preserving with ardour . He did n’t hunt : he was n’t a hunting man ; he was a man of books and peaceful habits : but he thought that the breed of horses must be kept up in the country , and that the breed of foxes must therefore be looked to , and for his part , if his friend , Sir Huddlestone Fuddlestone , liked to draw his country , and meet as of old the F. hounds used to do at Queen ’s Crawley , he should be happy to see him there , and the gentlemen of the Fuddlestone hunt . And to Lady Southdown ’s dismay too he became more orthodox in his tendencies every day : gave up preaching in public and attending meeting - houses ; went stoutly to Church ; called on the Bishop , and all the Clergy at Winchester : and made no objection when the Venerable Archdeacon Trumper asked for a game of whist . What pangs must have been those of Lady Southdown , and what an utter cast - away she must have thought her son - in - law for permitting such a godless diversion ! and when , on the return of the family from an oratorio at Winchester , the Baronet announced to the young ladies that he should next year very probably take them to the “
235419	235459	234775	234775	I	0	” they worshipped him for his kindness . Lady Jane was only too obedient , and perhaps glad herself to go . The Dowager wrote off the direst descriptions of her daughter ’s worldly behaviour to the authoress of the “
235464	235632	235633	235633	You	9529	” at the Cape ; and her house in Brighton being about this time unoccupied , returned to that watering - place , her absence being not very much deplored by her children . We may suppose , too , that Rebecca , on paying a second visit to Queen ’s Crawley , did not feel particularly grieved at the absence of the lady of the medicine chest ; though she wrote a Christmas letter to her Ladyship , in which she respectfully recalled herself to Lady Southdown ’s recollection , spoke with gratitude of the delight which her Ladyship ’s conversation had given her on the former visit , dilated on the kindness with which her Ladyship had treated her in sickness , and declared that everything at Queen ’s Crawley reminded her of her absent friend . A great part of the altered demeanour and popularity of Sir Pitt Crawley might have been traced to the counsels of that astute little lady of Curzon Street . “
235647	235662	235638	235638	you	9529	” she said to him , while he had been her guest in London . “
235873	235880	235867	235867	I	0	” she added with a laugh . “
235906	235917	235919	235920	that woman	18999	” Pitt Crawley was amazed and enraptured with her speech . “
235924	235928	235919	235920	that woman	18999	” he said . “
236083	236612	236080	236081	Pitt Crawley	697	” Therefore it was that this roguish diplomatist had grown so hospitable ; that he was so civil to oratorios and hospitals ; so kind to Deans and Chapters ; so generous in giving and accepting dinners ; so uncommonly gracious to farmers on market - days ; and so much interested about county business ; and that the Christmas at the Hall was the gayest which had been known there for many a long day . On Christmas Day a great family gathering took place . All the Crawleys from the Rectory came to dine . Rebecca was as frank and fond of Mrs. Bute , as if the other had never been her enemy ; she was affectionately interested in the dear girls , and surprised at the progress which they had made in music since her time : and insisted upon encoring one of the duets out of the great song - books which Jim , grumbling , had been forced to bring under his arm from the Rectory . Mrs. Bute , perforce , was obliged to adopt a decent demeanour towards the little adventuress — of course being free to discourse with her daughters afterwards about the absurd respect with which Sir Pitt treated his sister - in - law . But Jim , who had sate next to her at dinner , declared she was a trump : and one and all of the Rector ’s family agreed that the little Rawdon was a fine boy . They respected a possible baronet in the boy , between whom and the title there was only the little sickly pale Pitt Binkie . The children were very good friends . Pitt Binkie was too little a dog for such a big dog as Rawdon to play with : and Matilda being only a girl , of course not fit companion for a young gentleman who was near eight years old , and going into jackets very soon . He took the command of this small party at once — the little girl and the little boy following him about with great reverence at such times as he condescended to sport with them . His happiness and pleasure in the country were extreme . The kitchen garden pleased him hugely , the flowers moderately , but the pigeons and the poultry , and the stables when he was allowed to visit them , were delightful objects to him . He resisted being kissed by the Misses Crawley : but he allowed Lady Jane sometimes to embrace him : and it was by her side that he liked to sit when , the signal to retire to the drawing - room being given , the ladies left the gentlemen to their claret — by her side rather than by his mother . For Rebecca seeing that tenderness was the fashion , called Rawdon to her one evening , and stooped down and kissed him in the presence of all the ladies . He looked her full in the face after the operation , trembling and turning very red , as his wo nt was when moved . “
236622	236794	236620	236620	Mamma	4352	” he said ; at which there was a general silence and consternation , and a by no means pleasant look in Becky ’s eyes . Rawdon was fond of his sister - in - law , for her regard for his son . Lady Jane and Becky did not get on quite so well at this visit as on occasion of the former one , when the Colonel ’s wife was bent upon pleasing . Those two speeches of the child struck rather a chill . Perhaps Sir Pitt was rather too attentive to her . But Rawdon , as became his age and size , was fonder of the society of the men than of the women ; and never wearied of accompanying his sire to the stables , whither the Colonel retired to smoke his cigar — Jim , the Rector ’s son , sometimes joining his cousin in that and other amusements . He and the Baronet ’s keeper were very close friends , their mutual taste for “
236796	236908	236613	236613	You	9551	” bringing them much together . On one day , Mr. James , the Colonel , and Horn , the keeper , went and shot pheasants , taking little Rawdon with them . On another most blissful morning , these four gentlemen partook of the amusement of rat - hunting in a barn , than which sport Rawdon as yet had never seen anything more noble . They stopped up the ends of certain drains in the barn , into the other openings of which ferrets were inserted ; and then stood silently aloof , with uplifted stakes in their hands , and an anxious little terrier ( Mr. James ’s celebrated “
236910	237529	236613	236613	You	9551	” Forceps , indeed , ) scarcely breathing from excitement , listening motionless on three legs , to the faint squeaking of the rats below . Desperately bold at last , the persecuted animals bolted above - ground : the terrier accounted for one , the keeper for another ; Rawdon , from flurry and excitement , missed his rat , but on the other hand he half - murdered a ferret . But the greatest day of all was that on which Sir Huddlestone Fuddlestone ’s hounds met upon the lawn at Queen ’s Crawley . That was a famous sight for little Rawdon . At half - past ten , Tom Moody , Sir Huddlestone Fuddlestone ’s huntsman , was seen trotting up the avenue , followed by the noble pack of hounds in a compact body — the rear being brought up by the two whips clad in stained scarlet frocks — light hard - featured lads on well - bred lean horses , possessing marvellous dexterity in casting the points of their long heavy whips at the thinnest part of any dog ’s skin who dares to straggle from the main body , or to take the slightest notice , or even so much as wink , at the hares and rabbits starting under their noses . Next comes boy Jack , Tom Moody ’s son , who weighs five stone , measures eight - and - forty inches , and will never be any bigger . He is perched on a large raw - boned hunter , half - covered by a capacious saddle . This animal is Sir Huddlestone Fuddlestone ’s favourite horse — the Nob . Other horses , ridden by other small boys , arrive from time to time , awaiting their masters , who will come cantering on anon . Tom Moody rides up to the door of the Hall , where he is welcomed by the butler , who offers him drink , which he declines . He and his pack then draw off into a sheltered corner of the lawn , where the dogs roll on the grass , and play or growl angrily at one another , ever and anon breaking out into furious fight speedily to be quelled by Tom ’s voice , unmatched at rating , or the snaky thongs of the whips . Many young gentlemen canter up on thoroughbred hacks , spatter - dashed to the knee , and enter the house to drink cherry - brandy and pay their respects to the ladies , or , more modest and sportsman - like , divest themselves of their mudboots , exchange their hacks for their hunters , and warm their blood by a preliminary gallop round the lawn . Then they collect round the pack in the corner , and talk with Tom Moody of past sport , and the merits of Sniveller and Diamond , and of the state of the country and of the wretched breed of foxes . Sir Huddlestone presently appears mounted on a clever cob , and rides up to the Hall , where he enters and does the civil thing by the ladies , after which , being a man of few words , he proceeds to business . The hounds are drawn up to the hall - door and little Rawdon descends amongst them , excited yet half alarmed by the caresses which they bestow upon him , at the thumps he receives from their waving tails , and at their canine bickerings , scarcely restrained by Tom Moody ’s tongue and lash . Meanwhile , Sir Huddlestone has hoisted himself unwieldily on the Nob : “
237539	237544	237537	237537	Tom	1504	” says the Baronet , “
237556	238536	237545	237546	Farmer Mangle	1508	” Tom blows his horn and trots off , followed by the pack , by the whips , by the young gents from Winchester , by the farmers of the neighbourhood , by the labourers of the parish on foot , with whom the day is a great holiday ; Sir Huddlestone bringing up the rear with Colonel Crawley , and the whole cortège disappears down the avenue . The Reverend Bute Crawley ( who has been too modest to appear at the public meet before his nephew ’s windows ) , and whom Tom Moody remembers forty years back a slender divine riding the wildest horses , jumping the widest brooks , and larking over the newest gates in the country,—his Reverence , we say , happens to trot out from the Rectory Lane on his powerful black horse , just as Sir Huddlestone passes ; he joins the worthy baronet . Hounds and horsemen disappear , and little Rawdon remains on the door - steps , wondering and happy . During the progress of this memorable holiday , little Rawdon , if he had got no special liking for his uncle , always awful and cold , and locked up in his study , plunged in justice - business and surrounded by bailiffs and farmers — has gained the good graces of his married and maiden aunts , of the two little folks of the Hall , and of Jim of the Rectory , whom Sir Pitt is encouraging to pay his addresses to one of the young ladies , with an understanding doubtless that he shall be presented to the living when it shall be vacated by his fox - hunting old sire . Jim has given up that sport himself , and confines himself to a little harmless duck or snipe - shooting , or a little quiet trifling with the rats during the Christmas holidays , after which he will return to the University , and try and not be plucked , once more . He has already eschewed green coats , red neckcloths , and other worldly ornaments , and is preparing himself for a change in his condition . In this cheap and thrifty was Sir Pitt tries to pay off his debt to his family . Also before this merry Christmas was over , the Baronet had screwed up courage enough to give his brother another draft on his bankers , and for no less a sum than a hundred pounds , an act which caused Sir Pitt cruel pangs at first , but which made him glow afterwards to think himself one of the most generous of men . Rawdon and his son went away with the utmost heaviness of heart . Becky and the ladies parted with some alacrity , however : and our friend returned to London to commence those avocations with which we find her occupied when this chapter begins . Under her care the Crawley House in Great Gaunt Street was quite rejuvenescent , and ready for the reception of Sir Pitt and his family , when the Baronet came to London to attend his duties in Parliament , and to assume that position in the country for which his vast genius fitted him . For the first session , this profound dissembler hid his projects and never opened his lips but to present a petition from Mudbury . But he attended assiduously in his place , and learned thoroughly the routine and business of the House . At home he gave himself up to the perusal of Blue Books , to the alarm and wonder of Lady Jane , who thought he was killing himself by late hours and intense application . And he made acquaintance with the ministers , and the chiefs of his party , determining to rank as one of them before many years were over . Lady Jane ’s sweetness and kindness had inspired Rebecca with such a contempt for her ladyship as the little woman found no small difficulty in concealing . That sort of goodness and simplicity which Lady Jane possessed , annoyed our friend Becky , and it was impossible for her at times not to show , or to let the other divine her scorn . Her presence , too , rendered Lady Jane uneasy . Her husband talked constantly with Becky . Signs of intelligence seemed to pass between them : and Pitt spoke with her on subjects on which he never thought of discoursing with Lady Jane . The latter did not understand them to be sure , but it was mortifying to remain silent ; still more mortifying to know that you had nothing to say , and hear that little audacious Mrs. Rawdon dashing on from subject to subject , with a word for every man , and a joke always pat ; and to sit in one ’s own house alone , by the fireside , and watching all the men round your rival . In the country , when Lady Jane was telling stories to the children , who clustered about her knees ( little Rawdon into the bargain , who was very fond of her)—and Becky came into the room , sneering with green scornful eyes , poor Lady Jane grew silent under those baleful glances . Her simple little fancies shrank away tremulously , as fairies in the story - books , before a superior bad angel . She could not go on , although Rebecca , with the smallest inflection of sarcasm in her voice , besought her to continue that charming story . And on her side gentle thoughts and simple pleasures were odious to Mrs. Becky ; they discorded with her ; she hated people for liking them ; she spurned children and children - lovers . “
238546	238563	238537	238537	I	0	” she would say , when caricaturing Lady Jane and her ways to my Lord Steyne . “
238574	239477	239478	239479	Mrs. S	1510	” his lordship replied with a bow and a grin , and a great jarring laugh afterwards . So these two ladies did not see much of each other except upon those occasions , when the younger brother ’s wife , having an object to gain from the other , frequented her . They my - loved and my - deared each other assiduously , but kept apart generally : whereas Sir Pitt , in the midst of his multiplied avocations , found daily time to see his sister - in - law . On the occasion of his first Speaker ’s dinner , Sir Pitt took the opportunity of appearing before his sister - in - law in his uniform — that old diplomatic suit which he had worn when attaché to the Pumpernickel legation . Becky complimented him upon that dress , and admired him almost as much as his own wife and children , to whom he displayed himself before he set out . She said that it was only the thoroughbred gentleman who could wear the Court suit with advantage : it was only your men of ancient race whom the culotte courte became . Pitt looked down with complacency at his legs , which had not , in truth , much more symmetry or swell than the lean Court sword which dangled by his side : looked down at his legs , and thought in his heart that he was killing . When he was gone , Mrs. Becky made a caricature of his figure , which she showed to Lord Steyne when he arrived . His lordship carried off the sketch , delighted with the accuracy of the resemblance . He had done Sir Pitt Crawley the honour to meet him at Mrs. Becky ’s house , and had been most gracious to the new Baronet and member . Pitt was struck too by the deference with which the great Peer treated his sister - in - law , by her ease and sprightliness in the conversation , and by the delight with which the other men of the party listened to her talk . Lord Steyne made no doubt but that the Baronet had only commenced his career in public life , and expected rather anxiously to hear him as an orator ; as they were neighbours ( for Great Gaunt Street leads into Gaunt Square , whereof Gaunt House , as everybody knows , forms one side ) my lord hoped that as soon as Lady Steyne arrived in London she would have the honour of making the acquaintance of Lady Crawley . He left a card upon his neighbour in the course of a day or two ; having never thought fit to notice his predecessor , though they had lived near each other for near a century past . In the midst of these intrigues and fine parties and wise and brilliant personages Rawdon felt himself more and more isolated every day . He was allowed to go to the club more : to dine abroad with bachelor friends : to come and go when he liked , without any questions being asked . And he and Rawdon the younger many a time would walk to Gaunt Street , and sit with the lady and the children there while Sir Pitt was closeted with Rebecca , on his way to the House , or on his return from it . The ex - Colonel would sit for hours in his brother ’s house very silent , and thinking and doing as little as possible . He was glad to be employed of an errand : to go and make inquiries about a horse or a servant : or to carve the roast mutton for the dinner of the children . He was beat and cowed into laziness and submission . Delilah had imprisoned him and cut his hair off , too . The bold and reckless young blood of ten years back was subjugated , and was turned into a torpid , submissive , middle - aged , stout gentleman . And poor Lady Jane was aware that Rebecca had captivated her husband : although she and Mrs. Rawdon mydeared and my - loved each other every day they met . OUR friends at Brompton were meanwhile passing their Christmas after their fashion , and in a manner by no means too cheerful . Out of the hundred pounds a year , which was about the amount of her income , the widow Osborne had been in the habit of giving up nearly three - fourths to her father and mother , for the expenses of herself and her little boy . With £ 120 more , supplied by Jos , this family of four people , attended by a single Irish servant who also did for Clapp and his wife , might manage to live in decent comfort through the year , and hold up their heads yet , and be able to give a friend a dish of tea still , after the storms and disappointments of their early life . Sedley still maintained his ascendency over the family of Mr. Clapp , his ex - clerk . Clapp remembered the time when , sitting on the edge of the chair , he tossed off a bumper to the health of “
239492	239550	239487	239488	Mr. Joseph	674	” at the merchant ’s rich table in Russell Square . Time magnified the splendour of those recollections in the honest clerk ’s bosom . Whenever he came up from the kitchen - parlour to the drawing - room , and partook of tea or gin - and - water with Mr. Sedley , he would say , “
239563	239653	239555	239555	you	9555	” and as gravely and reverentially drink the health of the ladies as he had done in the days of their utmost prosperity . He thought Miss ’ Melia ’s playing the divinest music ever performed , and her the finest lady . He never would sit down before Sedley at the club even , nor would he have that gentleman ’s character abused by any member of the society . He had seen the first men in London shaking hands with Mr. S — — ; he said , “
239680	239708	239674	239674	he	9555	” Clapp , with the best of characters and handwritings , had been able very soon after his master ’s disaster to find other employment for himself . “
239721	240367	239674	239674	he	9555	” he used to remark , and a member of the house from which old Sedley had seceded was very glad to make use of Mr. Clapp ’s services , and to reward them with a comfortable salary . In fine , all Sedley ’s wealthy friends had dropped off one by one , and this poor exdependent still remained faithfully attached to him . Out of the small residue of her income , which Amelia kept back for herself , the widow had need of all the thrift and care possible in order to enable her to keep her darling boy dressed in such a manner as became George Osborne ’s son , and to defray the expenses of the little school to which , after much misgiving and reluctance , and many secret pangs and fears on her own part , she had been induced to send the lad . She had sate up of nights conning lessons and spelling over crabbed grammars and geography books in order to teach them to Georgy . She had worked even at the Latin accidence , fondly hoping that she might be capable of instructing him in that language . To part with him all day : to send him out to the mercy of a schoolmaster ’s cane and his schoolfellows ’ roughness , was almost like weaning him over again , to that weak mother , so tremulous and full of sensibility . He , for his part , rushed off to school with the utmost happiness . He was longing for the change . That childish gladness wounded his mother , who was herself so grieved to part with him . She would rather have had him more sorry , she thought : and then was deeply repentant within herself , for daring to be so selfish as to wish her own son to be unhappy . Georgy made great progress in the school , which was kept by a friend of his mother ’s constant admirer , the Rev. Mr. Binny . He brought home numberless prizes and testimonials of ability . He told his mother countless stories every night about his school - companions : and what a fine fellow Lyons was , and what a sneak Sniffin was ; and how Steel ’s father actually supplied the meat for the establishment , whereas Golding ’s mother came in a carriage to fetch him every Saturday : and how Neat had straps to his trowsers — might he have straps?—and how Bull Major was so strong ( though only in Eutropius ) that it was believed he could lick the Usher , Mr. Ward , himself . So Amelia learned to know every one of the boys in that school as well as Georgy himself : and of nights she used to help him in his exercises and puzzle her little head over his lessons as eagerly as if she was herself going in the morning into the presence of the master . Once , after a certain combat with Master Smith , George came home to his mother with a black eye , and bragged prodigiously to his parent and his delighted old grandfather about his valour in the fight , in which , if the truth was known , he did not behave with particular heroism , and in which he decidedly had the worst . But Amelia has never forgiven that Smith to this day , though he is now a peaceful apothecary near Leicester Square . In these quiet labours and harmless cares the gentle widow ’s life was passing away , a silver hair or two marking the progress of time on her head , and a line deepening ever so little on her fair forehead . She used to smile at these marks of time . “
240372	240376	239674	239674	he	9555	” she asked , “
240384	240852	239674	239674	he	9555	” All she hoped for was to live to see her son great , famous , and glorious , as he deserved to be . She kept his copybooks , his drawings , and compositions , and showed them about in her little circle , as if they were miracles of genius . She confided some of these specimens to Miss Dobbin ; to show them to Miss Osborne , George ’s aunt , to show them to Mr. Osborne himself — to make that old man repent of his cruelty and ill - feeling towards him who was gone . All her husband ’s faults and foibles she had buried in the grave with him : she only remembered the lover , who had married her at all sacrifices ; the noble husband so brave and beautiful , in whose arms she had hung on the morning when he had gone away to fight , and die gloriously for his king . From heaven the hero must be smiling down upon that paragon of a boy whom he had left to comfort and console her . We have seen how one of George ’s grandfathers ( Mr. Osborne ) , in his easy - chair in Russell Square , daily grew more violent and moody , and how his daughter , with her fine carriage , and her fine horses , and her name on half the public charity - lists of the town , was a lonely , miserable , persecuted old maid . She thought again and again of the beautiful little boy , her brother ’s son , whom she had seen . She longed to be allowed to drive in the fine carriage to the house in which he lived ; and she used to look out day after day as she took her solitary drive in the Park , in hopes that she might see him . Her sister , the banker ’s lady , occasionally condescended to pay her old home and companion a visit in Russell Square . She brought a couple of sickly children attended by a prim nurse , and in a faint genteel giggling tone cackled to her sister about her fine acquaintance , and how her little Frederick was the image of Lord Claud Lollypop , and her sweet Maria had been noticed by the Baroness as they were driving in their donkey - chaise at Roehampton . She urged her to make her papa do something for the darlings . Frederick she had determined should go into the Guards ; and if they made an elder son of him ( and Mr. Bullock was positively ruining and pinching himself to death to buy land ) how was the darling girl to be provided for ? “
240859	240865	240853	240853	I	0	” Mrs. Bullock would say , “
240985	241192	240982	240982	Rowdy	1524	” After which kind of speeches , in which fashion and the main chance were blended together , and after a kiss , which was like the contact of an oyster — Mrs. Frederick Bullock would gather her starched nurslings , and simper back into her carriage . Every visit which this leader of ton paid to her family was more unlucky for her . Her father paid more money into Stumpy and Rowdy ’s . Her patronage became more and more insufferable . The poor widow in the little cottage at Brompton , guarding her treasure there , little knew how eagerly some people coveted it . On that night when Jane Osborne had told her father that she had seen his grandson , the old man had made her no reply : but he had shown no anger — and had bade her good - night on going himself to his room in rather a kindly voice . And he must have meditated on what she said , and have made some inquiries of the Dobbin family regarding her visit ; for a fortnight after it took place , he asked her where was her little French watch and chain she used to wear ? “
241202	241210	241193	241193	I	0	” she said in a great fright . “
241227	241366	241193	241193	I	0	” said the old gentleman , and lapsed again into silence . Of late the Misses Dobbin more than once repeated their entreaties to Amelia , to allow George to visit them . His aunt had shown her inclination ; perhaps his grandfather himself , they hinted , might be disposed to be reconciled to him . Surely , Amelia could not refuse such advantageous chances for the boy . Nor could she : but she acceded to their overtures with a very heavy and suspicious heart , was always uneasy during the child ’s absence from her , and welcomed him back as if he was rescued out of some danger . He brought back money and toys , at which the widow looked with alarm and jealousy : she asked him always if he had seen any gentleman—“Only
241433	241439	241442	241460	an old gentleman , with thick eye - brows and a broad hat , and large chain and seals	9578	” At last , he said “
241462	241481	241482	241482	He	9578	” He came one day as the coachman was lunging Georgy round the lawn on the gray pony . “
241516	241779	241511	241511	She	16187	” Such was George ’s report on that night . Then Amelia knew that the boy had seen his grandfather : and looked out feverishly for a proposal which she was sure would follow , and which came , in fact , in a few days afterwards . Mr. Osborne formally offered to take the boy , and make him heir to the fortune which he had intended that his father should inherit . He would make Mrs. George Osborne an allowance , such as to assure her a decent competency . If Mrs. George Osborne proposed to marry again , as Mr. O. heard was her intention , he would not withdraw that allowance . But it must be understood , that the child would live entirely with his grandfather in Russell Square , or at whatever other place Mr. O. should select ; and that he would be occasionally permitted to see Mrs. George Osborne at her own residence . This message was brought or read in a letter one day , when her mother was from home , and her father absent as usual in the City . She was never seen angry but twice or thrice in her life , and it was in one of these moods that Mr. Osborne ’s attorney had the fortune to behold her . She rose up trembling and flushing very much as soon as , after reading the letter , Mr. Poe handed it to her , and she tore the paper into a hundred fragments , which she trod on . “
241843	242830	241831	241831	she	15356	” said the lawyer who told the story . Her parents never remarked her agitation on that day , and she never told them of the interview . They had their own affairs to interest them , affairs which deeply interested this innocent and unconscious lady . The old gentleman , her father , was always dabbling in speculation . We have seen how the Wine Company and the Coal Company had failed him . But , prowling about the City always eagerly and restlessly still , he lighted upon some other scheme , of which he thought so well that he embarked in it in spite of the remonstrances of Mr. Clapp , to whom indeed he never dared to tell how far he had engaged himself in it . And as it was always Mr. Sedley ’s maxim not to talk about money matters before women , they had no inkling of the misfortunes that were in store for them until the unhappy old gentleman was forced to make gradual confessions . The bills of the little household , which had been settled weekly , first fell into arrear . The remittances had not arrived from India , Mr. Sedley told his wife with a disturbed face . As she had paid her bills very regularly hitherto , one or two of the tradesmen to whom the poor lady was obliged to go round asking for time were very angry at a delay to which they were perfectly used from more irregular customers . Emmy ’s contribution , paid over cheerfully without any questions , kept the little company in half rations however . And the first six months passed away pretty easily : old Sedley still keeping up with the notion that his shares must rise and that all would be well . No sixty pounds , however , came to help the household at the end of the half year ; and it fell deeper and deeper into trouble — Mrs. Sedley , who was growing infirm and was much shaken , remained silent or wept a great deal with Mrs. Clapp in the kitchen . The butcher was particularly surly : the grocer insolent : once or twice little Georgy had grumbled about the dinners : and Amelia , who still would have been satisfied with a slice of bread for her own dinner , could not but perceive that her son was neglected , and purchased little things out of her private purse to keep the boy in health . At last they told her , or told her such a garbled story as people in difficulties tell . One day , her own money having been received , and Amelia about to pay it over : she who had kept an account of the moneys expended by her , proposed to keep a certain portion back out of her dividend , having contracted engagements for a new suit for Georgy . Then it came out that Jos ’s remittances were not paid ; that the house was in difficulties , which Amelia ought to have seen before , her mother said , but she cared for nothing or nobody except Georgy . At this she passed all her money across the table , without a word , to her mother , and returned to her room to cry her eyes out . She had a great access of sensibility too that day , when obliged to go and countermand the clothes , the darling clothes on which she had set her heart for Christmas Day , and the cut and fashion of which she had arranged in many conversations with a small milliner , her friend . Hardest of all , she had to break the matter to Georgy , who made a loud outcry . Everybody had new clothes at Christmas . The others would laugh at him . He would have new clothes . She had promised them to him . The poor widow had only kisses to give him . She darned the old suit in tears . She cast about among her little ornaments to see if she could sell anything to procure the desired novelties . There was her India shawl that Dobbin had sent her . She remembered in former days going with her mother to a fine India shop on Ludgate Hill , where the ladies had all sorts of dealings and bargains in these articles . Her cheeks flushed and her eyes shone with pleasure as she thought of this resource , and she kissed away George to school in the morning , smiling brightly after him . The boy felt that there was good news in her look . Packing up her shawl in a handkerchief ( another of the gifts of the good Major ) , she hid them under her cloak , and walked flushed and eager all the way to Ludgate Hill , tripping along by the Park wall , and running over the crossing , so that many a man turned as she hurried by him , and looked after her rosy pretty face . She calculated how she should spend the proceeds of her shawl : how , besides the clothes , she would buy the books that he longed for , and pay his half - year ’s schooling ; and how she would buy a cloak for her father instead of that old great - coat which he wore . She was not mistaken as to the value of the Major ’s gift . It was a very fine and beautiful web : and the merchant made a very good bargain when he gave her twenty guineas for her shawl . She ran on amazed and flurried with her riches to Darton ’s shop in St. Paul ’s Churchyard , and there purchased the “
242835	242838	241831	241831	she	15356	” and the “
242842	242879	242880	242881	George Osborne	709	” Georgy longed for , and got into the coach there with her parcel , and went home exulting . And she pleased herself by writing in the fly - leaf in her neatest little hand , “
242891	242965	242887	242889	his affectionate mother	9585	” The books are extant to this day , with the fair delicate superscription . She was going from her own room with the books in her hand to place them on George ’s table , where he might find them on his return from school ; when in the passage , she and her mother met . The gilt bindings of the seven handsome little volumes caught the old lady ’s eye . “
242970	242974	242887	242889	his affectionate mother	9585	” she said . “
242980	242982	242887	242889	his affectionate mother	9585	” Amelia replied—“I
242992	242993	242984	242984	I	0	” “
242996	243004	242984	242984	I	0	” cried the elder lady , indignantly . “
243200	243233	243237	243237	mother	2356	” Hysteric sobs and cries ended Mrs. Sedley ’s speech — it echoed through every room in the small house , whereof the other female inmates heard every word of the colloquy . “
243239	243246	243237	243237	mother	2356	” cried poor Amelia in reply . “
243275	243825	243826	243827	The Prince	2726	everything”—and with quivering hands she took out her silver , and her sovereigns — her precious golden sovereigns , which she thrust into the hands of her mother , whence they overflowed and tumbled , rolling down the stairs . And then she went into her room , and sank down in despair and utter misery . She saw it all now . Her selfishness was sacrificing the boy . But for her he might have wealth , station , education , and his father ’s place , which the elder George had forfeited for her sake . She had but to speak the words , and her father was restored to competency : and the boy raised to fortune . O what a conviction it was to that tender and stricken heart ! ALL the world knows that Lord Steyne ’s town palace stands in Gaunt Square , out of which Great Gaunt Street leads , whither we first conducted Rebecca , in the time of the departed Sir Pitt Crawley . Peering over the railings and through the black trees into the garden of the Square , you see a few miserable governesses with wan - faced pupils wandering round and round it , and round the dreary grass - plot in the centre of which rises the statue of Lord Gaunt , who fought at Minden , in a three - tailed wig , and otherwise habited like a Roman Emperor . Gaunt House occupies nearly a side of the Square . The remaining three sides are composed of mansions that have passed away into dowagerism;—tall , dark houses , with window - frames of stone , or picked out of a lighter red . Little light seems to be behind those lean , comfortless casements now : and hospitality to have passed away from those doors as much as the laced lacqueys and link - boys of old times , who used to put out their torches in the blank iron extinguishers that still flank the lamps over the steps . Brass plates have penetrated into the square — Doctors , the Diddlesex Bank Western Branch — the English and European Reunion , & c.—it has a dreary look — nor is my Lord Steyne ’s palace less dreary . All I have ever seen of it is the vast wall in front , with the rustic columns at the great gate , through which an old porter peers sometimes with a fat and gloomy red face — and over the wall the garret and bed - room windows , and the chimneys , out of which there seldom comes any smoke now . For the present Lord Steyne lives at Naples , preferring the view of the Bay and Capri and Vesuvius , to the dreary aspect of the wall in Gaunt Square . A few score yards down New Gaunt Street , and leading into Gaunt Mews indeed , is a little modest back door , which you would not remark from that of any of the other stables . But many a little close carriage has stopped at that door , as my informant ( little Tom Eaves , who knows everything , and who showed me the place ) told me . “
243841	243848	243826	243827	The Prince	2726	” he had often told me ; “
243983	244773	244802	244803	Lord Steyne	1362	” but it forms no part of our scheme to tell what became of the remainder , for every shilling of which , and a great deal more , little Tom Eaves , who knows everybody ’s affairs , is ready to account . Besides his town palace , the Marquis had castles and palaces in various quarters of the three kingdoms , whereof the descriptions may be found in the road - books — Castle Strongbow , with its woods , on the Shannon shore ; Gaunt Castle , in Carmarthenshire , where Richard II . was taken prisoner — Gauntly Hall in Yorkshire , where I have been informed there were two hundred silver teapots for the breakfasts of the guests of the house , with everything to correspond in splendour ; and Stillbrook in Hampshire , which was my lord ’s farm , an humble place of residence , of which we all remember the wonderful furniture which was sold at my lord ’s demise by a late celebrated auctioneer . The Marchioness of Steyne was of the renowned and ancient family of the Caerlyons , Marquises of Camelot , who have preserved the old faith ever since the conversion of the venerable Druid , their first ancestor , and whose pedigree goes far beyond the date of the arrival of King Brute in these islands . Pendragon is the title of the eldest son of the house . The sons have been called Arthurs , Uthers , and Caradocs , from immemorial time . Their heads have fallen in many a local conspiracy . Elizabeth chopped off the head of the Arthur of her day , who had been Chamberlain to Philip and Mary , and carried letters between the Queen of Scots and her uncles the Guises . A cadet of the house was an officer of the great Duke , and distinguished in the famous Saint Bartholomew conspiracy . During the whole of Mary ’s confinement , the house of Camelot conspired in her behalf . It was as much injured by its charges in fitting out an armament against the Spaniards , during the time of the Armada , as by the fines and confiscations levied on it by Elizabeth for harbouring of priests , obstinate recusancy , and Popish misdoings . A recreànt of James ’s time was momentarily perverted from his religion by the arguments of that great theologian , and the fortunes of the family somewhat restored by his timely weakness . But the Earl of Camelot , of the reign of Charles , returned to the old creed of his family , and they continued to fight for it , and ruin themselves for it , as long as there was a Stuart left to head or to instigate a rebellion . Lady Mary Caerlyon was brought up at a Parisian convent ; the Dauphiness Marie Antoinette was her godmother . In the pride of her beauty she had been married — sold , it was said — to Lord Gaunt , then at Paris , who won vast sums from the lady ’s brother at some of Philip of Orleans ’s banquets . The Earl of Gaunt ’s famous duel with the Count de la Marche , of the Grey Musqueteers , was attributed by common report to the pretensions of that officer ( who had been a page , and remained a favourite of the Queen ) to the hand of the beautiful Lady Mary Caerlyon . She was married to Lord Gaunt while the Count lay ill of his wound , and came to dwell at Gaunt House , and to figure for a short time in the splendid Court of the Prince of Wales . Fox had toasted her . Morris and Sheridan had written songs about her . Malmesbury had made her his best bow ; Walpole had pronounced her charming ; Devonshire had been almost jealous of her ; but she was scared by the wild pleasures and gaieties of the society into which she was flung , and after she had borne a couple of sons , shrank away into a life of devout seclusion . No wonder that my Lord Steyne , who liked pleasure and cheerfulness , was not often seen after their marriage , by the side of this trembling , silent , superstitious , unhappy lady . The before - mentioned Tom Eaves ( who has no part in this history , except that he knew all the great folks in London and the stories and mysteries of each family ) , had further information regarding my Lady Steyne , which may or may not be true . “
244777	244783	244802	244803	Lord Steyne	1362	” Tom used to say , “
244846	244879	244881	244883	the reigning favourite	9619	” ( from every one of which ladies Tom Eaves — who would have sacrificed his wife for knowing them — was too glad to get a bow or a dinner ) , “
244952	244970	244950	244950	I	0	” ( the reader must bear in mind that it is always Tom Eaves who speaks ) , “
245154	245166	245147	245147	they	15565	” added Tom Eaves with a knowing wag of his head ; “
245195	245437	245184	245185	the Marquis	8006	” So , if Mr. Eaves ’s information be correct , it is very likely that this lady , in her high station , had to submit to many a private indignity , and to hide many secret griefs under a calm face . And let us , my brethren who have not our names in the Red Book , console ourselves by thinking comfortably how miserable our betters may be , and that Damocles , who sits on satin cushions , and is served on gold plate , has an awful sword hanging over his head in the shape of a bailiff , or an hereditary disease , or a family secret , which peeps out every now and then from the embroidered arras in a ghastly manner , and will be sure to drop one day or the other in the right place . In comparing , too , the poor man ’s situation with that of the great , there is ( always according to Mr. Eaves ) another source of comfort for the former . You who have little or no patrimony to bequeath or to inherit , may be on good terms with your father or your son , whereas the heir of a great prince , such as my Lord Steyne , must naturally be angry at being kept out of his kingdom , and eye the occupant of it with no very agreeable glances . “
245444	245452	245184	245185	the Marquis	8006	” this sardonic old Eaves would say , “
245609	245749	245600	245600	they	1560	“ Then again , as to the feeling of elder towards younger sons . My dear sir , you ought to know that every elder brother looks upon the cadets of the house as his natural enemies , who deprive him of so much ready money which ought to be his by right . I have often heard George Mac Turk , Lord Bajazet ’s eldest son , say that if he had his will when he came to the title , he would do what the sultans do , and clear the estate by chopping off all his younger brothers ’ heads at once ; and so the case is , more or less , with them all . I tell you they are all Turks in their hearts . Pooh ! sir , they know the world . ”

247138	247210	247100	247101	the crowd	15494	“ why not you ? I may shut you up in a prison some day like your son George . I may tap you on the head to - morrow , and away go pleasure and honours , feasts and beauty , friends , flatterers , French cooks , fine horses and houses — in exchange for a prison , a keeper , and a straw mattress like George Gaunt ’s . ”

247585	247653	247580	247581	the Baronet	15848	“ that we can not be wrong . The great rank and station of Lord Stere put him in a position to command people in our station in life . The Lord Lieutenant of a County , my dear , is a respectable man . Besides George Gaunt and I were intimate in early life : he was my junior when we were attachés at Pumpernickel together . ”

250092	250177	250089	250089	she	982	“ where do you suppose I got them?—all except the little clasp , which a dear friend of mine gave me long ago . I hired them , to be sure . I hired them at Mr. Polonius ’s , in Coventry Street . You do n’t suppose that all the diamonds which go to Court belong to the wearers ; like those beautiful stones which Lady Jane has , and which are much handsome than any which I have , I am certain . ”
250178	250184	250186	250187	Sir Pit	1581	“ They are family jewels , ”

You may go and dine with them , as you like your rubber . But I must n’t , and wo n’t ; and you will have the goodness to tell Smith to say I am not at home when either of them calls . ”

But you ’re only a gentlewoman , my poor dear child . You have only some of the best blood in England in your veins , and good principles and piety for your portion . I , myself , the wife of a Baronet ’s younger brother , too , never thought of such a thing as going to Court — nor would other people , if good Queen Charlotte had been alive . ”
251736	251742	251743	251743	she	630	“ Thank you , Monseigneur , ”
251746	251775	251743	251743	she	630	“ You see your ladies have been here . How good of you ! I could n’t come before — I was in the kitchen making a pudding . ”

251830	251890	251824	251824	he	2402	“ You silly little fibster ! I heard you in the room overhead , where I have no doubt you were putting a little rouge on ; you must give some of yours to my Lady Gaunt , whose complexion is quite preposterous ; and I heard the bed - room door open , and then you came downstairs . ”
251891	251907	251909	251910	Mrs. Radon	1585	“ Is it a crime to try and look my best when you come here ? ”

You poor little earthenware pipkin , you want to swim down the stream along with the great copper kettles . All women are alike . Everybody is striving for what is not worth the having ! Gad ! I dined with the King yesterday , and we had neck of mutton and turnips . A dinner of herbs is better than a stalled ox very often . You will go to Gaunt House . You give an old fellow no rest until you get there . It ’s not half so nice as here . You ’ll be bored there . I am . My wife is as gay as Lady Macbeth , and my daughters as cheerful as Regan and Goneril . I are n’t sleep in what they call my bed - room . The bed is like the baldaquin of St. Peter ’s , and the pictures frighten me . I have a little brass bed in a dressing - room : and a little hair mattress like an anchorite . I am an anchorite . Ho ! ho ! You ’ll be asked to dinner next week . And gare aux femmes , look out and hold your own ! How the women will bully you ! ”

252555	252566	252567	252568	the gentleman	2395	“ Ruined her?—then why do n’t you turn her out ? ”
252571	252576	252577	252577	Becky	630	“ Men do that , ”
252581	252636	252577	252577	Becky	630	“ Women are not so bad as you . Last year when we were reduced to our last guinea , she gave us everything . She shall never leave me , until we are ruined utterly ourselves , which does not seem far off , or until I can pay her the utmost farthing . ”

I have kept it a secret from everybody but you — and you forced it from me . Ah , what shall I do , Lord Stere ? for I am very , very unhappy ! ”
253130	253137	253138	253138	She	630	“ How she would take it ? ”
253141	253160	253138	253138	She	630	“ she would take a hundred and fifty pounds in small notes and the remainder in one note : ”
253246	253260	253261	253261	she	630	“ And I hope this will be a lesson to you , Spavin , ”
253264	253309	253261	253261	she	630	“ and that on the next Drawing - room day my brother , Sir Pit , will not be inconvenienced by being obliged to take four of us in his carriage to wait upon His Majesty , because my own carriage is not forthcoming . ”

253734	253842	253668	253668	he	1582	“ I wish you would , and stay there . You will find the bailiffs at Bare acres very pleasant company , and I shall be freed from lending money to your relations , and from your own damned tragedy airs . Who are you to give orders here ? You have no money . You ’ve got no brains . You were here to have children , and you have not had any . Gaunt ’s tired of you ; and George ’s wife is the only person in the family who does n’t wish you were dead . Gaunt would marry again if you were . ”
253843	253849	253723	253724	Lady Gaunt	1569	“ I wish I were , ”

My Lady Stere knows that appearances are sometimes against the best of women ; that lies are often told about the most innocent of them . Pray , Madam , shall I tell you some little anecdotes about my Lady Bare acres , your mamma ? ”
253954	253971	253972	253973	Lady Gaunt	1569	“ You may strike me if you like , sir , or hit any cruel blow , ”

254001	254183	253998	253998	he	10057	“ I am a gentleman , and never lay my hand upon a woman , save in the way of kindness . I only wish to correct little faults in your character . You women are too proud , and sadly lack humility , as Father Mole , I ’m sure , would tell my Lady Stere if he were here . You must n’t give yourselves airs : you must be meek and humble , my blessings . For all Lady Stere knows , this calumniated , simple , good - humoured Mrs. Crawly is quite innocent — even more innocent than herself . Her husband ’s character is not good , but it is as good as Bare acres ’ , who has played a little and not paid a great deal , who cheated you out of the only legacy you ever had , and left you a pauper on my hands . And Mrs. Crawly is not very well born ; but she is not worse than Fanny ’s illustrious ancestor , the first de la Jones . ”
254184	254196	254197	254198	Lady George	1616	“ The money which I brought into the family , sir , ”

In the meanwhile , ladies , be as proud and virtuous as you like abroad , but do n’t give me any airs . As for Mrs. Crawlers character , I sha n’t demean myself or that most spotless and perfectly irreproachable lady , by even hinting that it requires a defence . You will be pleased to receive her with the utmost cordiality , as you will receive all persons whom I present in this house . This house ? ”
254333	254373	254326	254326	He	10062	“ Who is the master of it ? and what is it ? This Temple of Virtue belongs to me . And if I invite all Newgate or all Bedlam here , by — — they shall be welcome . ”

280543	280549	280550	280550	Rawdon	1743	“ Give me your keys , ”
280708	280715	280716	280716	Rawdon	1743	“ Did he give you this ? ”
280719	280722	280716	280716	Rawdon	1743	“ Yes , ”
280726	280737	280738	280738	Rawdon	1743	“ I ’ll send it to him to - day , ”
280757	280814	280738	280738	Rawdon	1743	“ and I will pay Briggs , who was kind to the boy , and some of the debts . You will let me know where I shall send the rest to you . You might have spared me a hundred pounds , Becky , out of all this — I have always shared with you . ”
280815	280820	280822	280822	Becky	976	“ I am innocent , ”
281056	281066	281067	281067	she	976	“ Mon Dieu , Madame , what has happened ? ”
281494	281500	281484	281484	he	11414	“ Festivities at Gaunt House , ”
281868	281874	281875	281875	he	11414	“ Good gracious , Rawdon , ”
281883	281902	281875	281875	he	11414	“ what brings you here at this time of the morning ? Why ai n’t you at home ? ”
281903	281906	281908	281908	Rawdon	794	“ Home , ”
281915	281939	281940	281940	Pitt	697	“ Do n’t be frightened , Pitt . I ’m not drunk . Shut the door ; I want to speak to you . ”
281991	282001	282002	282003	the Colonel	2871	“ Pitt , it ’s all over with me , ”
282010	282015	282002	282003	the Colonel	2871	“ I ’m done . ”
282016	282026	282027	282028	the Baronet	15848	“ I always said it would come to this , ”
282044	282212	282027	282028	the Baronet	15848	“ I warned you a thousand times . I ca n’t help you any more . Every shilling of my money is tied up . Even the hundred pounds that Jane took you last night were promised to my lawyer to - morrow morning ; and the want of it will put me to great inconvenience . I do n’t mean to say that I wo n’t assist you ultimately . But as for paying your creditors in full , I might as well hope to pay the National Debt . It is madness , sheer madness , to think of such a thing . You must come to a compromise . It ’s a painful thing for the family ; but everybody does it . There was George Kitely , Lord Ragland ’s son , went through the Court last week , and was what they call white - washed , I believe . Lord Ragland would not pay a shilling for him , and — — ”
282213	282221	282222	282222	Rawdon	794	“ It ’s not money I want , ”
282226	282244	282222	282222	Rawdon	794	“ I ’m not come to you about myself . Never mind what happens to me — — ”
282245	282253	282255	282255	Pitt	697	“ What is the matter , then ? ”
282260	282266	282268	282268	Rawdon	794	“ It ’s the boy , ”
282275	282402	282268	282268	Rawdon	794	“ I want you to promise me that you will take charge of him when I ’m gone . That dear good wife of yours has always been good to him ; and he ’s fonder of her than he is of his … — Damn it . Look here , Pitt — you know that I was to have had Miss Crawley ’s money . I was n’t brought up like a younger brother : but was always encouraged to be extravagant and kep idle . But for this I might have been quite a different man . I did n’t do my duty with the regiment so bad . You know how I was thrown over about the money , and who got it . ”
282403	282431	282432	282433	Sir Pitt	697	“ After the sacrifices I have made , and the manner in which I have stood by you , I think this sort of reproach is useless , ”
282436	282447	282432	282433	Sir Pitt	697	“ Your marriage was your own doing , not mine . ”
282448	282454	282268	282268	Rawdon	794	“ That ’s over now , ”
282456	282461	282432	282433	Sir Pitt	697	Rawdon.—“That ’s over now . ”
282479	282487	282475	282476	his brother	2216	“ Good God ! is she dead ? ”
282501	282507	282508	282508	Rawdon	794	“ I wish I was , ”
282511	282535	282508	282508	Rawdon	794	“ If it was n’t for little Rawdon I ’d have cut my throat this morning — and that damned villain ’s too . ”
282576	282588	282589	282589	he	2871	“ It was a regular plan between that scoundrel and her , ”
282592	282653	282589	282589	he	2871	“ The bailiffs were put upon me : I was taken as I was going out of his house : when I wrote to her for money , she said she was ill in bed , and put me off to another day . And when I got home I found her in diamonds and sitting with that villain alone . ”
282711	282721	282722	282722	Rawdon	794	“ And as it may end fatally with me , ”
282729	282767	282722	282722	Rawdon	794	“ and as the boy has no mother , I must leave him to you and Jane , Pitt — only it will be a comfort to me if you will promise me to be his friend . ”
282796	282802	282804	282804	he	2871	“ Thank you , brother , ”
282806	282815	282804	282804	he	2871	“ I know I can trust your word . ”
282816	282824	282825	282826	the Baronet	15848	“ I will , upon my honour , ”
282875	282881	282882	282882	he	2871	“ Here ’s six hundred , ”
282883	282958	282960	282960	he	2871	said—“you did n’t know I was so rich . I want you to give the money to Briggs , who lent it to us — and who was kind to the boy — and I ’ve always felt ashamed of having taken the poor old woman ’s money . And here ’s some more — I’ve only kept back a few pounds — which Becky may as well have , to get on with . ”
283028	283032	283015	283015	Pitt	697	“ Not that , ”
283034	283048	283049	283049	He	2871	said—“I hoped to put a bullet into the man whom that belongs to . ”
284113	284125	284127	284129	the old warrior	11526	“ What ’s the row about , Crawly , my boy ? ”
284131	284147	284127	284129	the old warrior	11526	“ No more gambling business , hay , like that when we shot Captain Marker ? ”
284148	284157	284158	284158	Crawly	1743	“ It ’s about — about my wife , ”
284176	284186	284187	284187	he	15526	“ I always said she ’d throw you over , ”
284248	284260	284261	284262	the Captain	2862	“ Is there no way out of it , old boy ? ”
284269	284312	284261	284262	the Captain	2862	“ Is it only suspicion , you know , or — or what is it ? Any letters ? Ca n’t you keep it quiet ? Best not make any noise about a thing of that sort if you can help it . ”
284313	284323	284324	284325	the Captain	2862	“ Think of his only finding her out now , ”
284354	284365	284366	284366	Rawdon	1743	“ There ’s no way but one out of it , ”
284367	284422	284429	284429	Macmurdo	1756	replied—“and there ’s only a way out of it for one of us , Mac — do you understand ? I was put out of the way : arrested : I found ’em alone together . I told him he was a liar and a coward , and knocked him down and thrashed him . ”
284423	284428	284429	284429	Macmurdo	1756	“ Serve him right , ”
284432	284437	284429	284429	Macmurdo	1756	“ Who is it ? ”
284445	284464	284442	284443	Lord Steyne	1362	“ The deuce ! a Marquis ! they said he — that is , they said you — — ”
284465	284473	284476	284476	Rawdon	1743	“ What the devil do you mean ? ”
284478	284501	284476	284476	Rawdon	1743	“ do you mean that you ever heard a fellow doubt about my wife , and did n’t tell me , Mac ? ”
284502	284512	284513	284514	the other	15526	“ The world ’s very censorious , old boy , ”
284517	284536	284513	284514	the other	15526	“ What the deuce was the good of my telling you what any tom - fools talked about ? ”
284537	284545	284547	284547	Rawdon	1743	“ It was damned unfriendly , Mac , ”
284584	284591	284592	284592	he	1743	“ Hold up , old boy , ”
284595	284621	284592	284592	he	1743	“ great man or not , we ’ll put a bullet in him , damn him . As for women , they ’re all so . ”
284622	284635	284636	284636	Rawdon	1743	“ You do n’t know how fond I was of that one , ”
284642	284719	284720	284720	He	11537	“ Damme , I followed her like a footman . I gave up everything I had to her . I ’m a beggar because I would marry her . By Jove , Sir , I ’ve pawned my own watch in order to get her anything she fancied : and she — she ’s been making a purse for herself all the time , and grudged me a hundred pound to get me out of quod . ”
284759	284768	284769	284769	he	11537	“ She may be innocent , after all , ”
284772	284791	284769	284769	he	11537	“ She says so . Steyne has been a hundred times alone with her in the house before . ”
284792	284798	284799	284799	Rawdon	1743	“ It may be so , ”
284803	284812	284814	284814	he	1743	“ but this do n’t look very innocent ; ”
284834	284872	284814	284814	he	1743	“ This is what he gave her , Mac : and she kep it unknown to me : and with this money in the house , she refused to stand by me when I was locked up . ”
285187	285195	285197	285198	the man	3146	“ They wo n’t give ’em up , ”
285200	285252	285197	285198	the man	3146	“ there ’s a regular shinty in the house ; and everything at sixes and sevens . The landlord ’s come in and took possession . The servants was a drinkin ’ up in the drawing - room . They said — they said you had gone off with the plate , Colonel”—the
285257	285293	285385	285389	the good - natured Captain	3820	pause:—“One of the servants is off already . And Simpson , the man as was very noisy and drunk indeed , says nothing shall go out of the house until his wages is paid up . ”
285324	285337	285338	285338	Rawdon	1695	“ I ’m glad the little ’ un is n’t at home , ”
285345	285374	285338	285338	Rawdon	1695	“ You remember him , Mac , do n’t you , in the Riding School ? How he sat the kicker to be sure ! did n’t he ? ”
285375	285383	285385	285389	the good - natured Captain	3820	“ That he did , old boy , ”
285391	285442	285385	285389	the good - natured Captain	3820	“ Little Rawdon was then sitting , one of fifty gown boys , in the Chapel of Whitefriars School : thinking , not about the sermon , but about going home next Saturday , when his father would certainly tip him , and perhaps would take him to the play . ”
285443	285453	285462	285462	his	2261	“ He ’s a regular trump , that boy , ”
285465	285531	285532	285532	He	2261	“ I say , Mac , if anything goes wrong — if I drop — I should like you to — to go and see him , you know : and say that I was very fond of him , and that . And — dash it — old chap , give him these gold sleeve - buttons : it ’s all I ’ve got . ”
285570	285578	285579	285579	he	1756	“ Go down and order some breakfast , ”

Some devilled kidneys and a herring — let ’s say — And , Clay , lay out some dressing things for the Colonel : we were always pretty much of a size , Rawdon , my boy , and neither of us ride so light as we did when we first entered the corps . ”
286542	286554	286555	286556	the cook	2899	“ Have a little drop , do’ee now , Mrs. Raggles , ”
286573	286578	286555	286556	the cook	2899	“ Simpson ! Trotter ! ”
286589	286615	286555	286556	the cook	2899	“ How dare you stay here when you heard me call ? How dare you sit down in my presence ? Where ’s my maid ? ”
286671	286677	286678	286679	Mrs. Cook	1762	“ Your sofy , indeed ! ”
286682	286771	286678	286679	Mrs. Cook	1762	“ I ’m a settin ’ on Mrs. Raggles ’s sofy . Do n’t you stir , Mrs. Raggles , Mum . I ’m a settin ’ on Mr. and Mrs. Raggles ’s sofy , which they bought with honest money , and very dear it cost ’em , too . And I ’m thinkin ’ if I set here until I ’m paid my wages , I shall set a precious long time , Mrs. Raggles ; and set I will , too - ha ! ha ! ”
286794	286805	286807	286808	Mrs. Crawley	982	“ Trotter ! Simpson ! turn that drunken wretch out , ”
286810	286814	286816	286816	Trotter	925	“ I shawn’t , ”
286820	286841	286816	286816	Trotter	925	“ turn out yourself . Pay our selleries , and turn me out too . We ’ll go fast enough . ”

286858	286867	286853	286853	Becky	982	“ when Colonel Crawley comes home I ’ll — ”
286899	286908	286909	286910	Mr. Trotter	1763	“ He ai n’t a comin ’ back , ”
286913	287000	286909	286910	Mr. Trotter	1763	“ He sent for his things , and I would n’t let ’em go , although Mr. Raggles would : and I do n’t b’lieve he ’s no more a Colonel than I am . He ’s hoff : and I suppose you ’re a goin’ after him . You ’re no better than swindlers , both on you . Do n’t be a bullyin ’ me . I wo n’t stand it . Pay us our selleries , I say . Pay us our selleries . ”
287027	287031	287033	287033	Becky	982	“ Mr. Raggles , ”
287041	287055	287033	287033	Becky	982	“ you will not surely let me be insulted by that drunken man ? ”
287056	287066	287068	287068	Simpson	760	“ Hold your noise , Trotter ; do now , ”

287171	287234	287107	287107	Raggles	1351	“ Har you a goin’ to pay me ? You ’ve lived in this ’ ouse four year . You ’ve ’ ad my substance : my plate and linning . You ho me a milk and butter bill of two ’ undred pound , you must ’ ave noo laid hegs for your homlets , and cream for your spanil dog . ”

287286	287289	287290	287291	honest Raggles	1351	“ ha ! ha!”—and
287368	287377	287378	287378	she	982	“ You all seem to be against me , ”
287383	287516	287378	287378	she	982	“ What do you want ? I ca n’t pay you on Sunday . Come back to - morrow and I ’ll pay you everything . I thought Colonel Crawley had settled with you . He will to - morrow . I declare to you upon my honour that he left home this morning with fifteen hundred pounds in his pocket - book . He has left me nothing . Apply to him . Give me a bonnet and shawl and let me go out and find him . There was a difference between us this morning . You all seem to know it . I promise you upon my word that you shall all be paid . He has got a good appointment . Let me go out and find him . ”
287637	287649	287650	287650	she	982	“ Good Heavens ! was ever such ill luck as mine ? ”
287653	287670	287650	287650	she	982	“ to be so near , and to lose all . Is it all too late ? ”
287816	287822	287823	287823	she	982	“ Do not look so , ”
287826	287888	287823	287823	she	982	“ I am not guilty , Pitt , dear Pitt ; you were my friend once . Before God , I am not guilty . I seem so . Everything is against me . And O ! at such a moment ! just when all my hopes were about to be realized : just when happiness was in store for us . ”
287889	287902	287903	287904	Sir Pitt	697	“ Is this true , what I see in the paper then ? ”
287916	288029	287903	287904	Sir Pitt	697	“ It was true . Lord Steyne told me on Friday night , the night of that fatal ball . He has been promised an appointment any time these six months . Mr. Martyr , the Colonial Secretary , told him yesterday that it was made out . That unlucky arrest ensued ; that horrible meeting . I was only guilty of too much devotedness to Rawdon ’s service . I have received Lord Steyne alone a hundred times before . I confess I had money of which Rawdon knew nothing . Do n’t you know how careless he is of it , and could I dare to confide it to him ? ”
288117	288128	288129	288129	she	982	“ I looked for a peerage for you , Pitt , ”
288143	288230	288231	288231	she	982	“ We have talked about it . Your genius and Lord Steyne ’s interest made it more than probable , had not this dreadful calamity come to put an end to all our hopes . But , first , I own that it was my object to rescue my dear husband,—him whom I love in spite of all his ill usage and suspicions of me,—to remove him from the poverty and ruin which was impending over us . I saw Lord Steyne ’s partiality for me , ”
288239	288444	288231	288231	she	982	“ I own that I did everything in my power to make myself pleasing to him , and as far as an honest woman may , to secure his — his esteem . It was only on Friday morning that the news arrived of the death of the Governor of Coventry Island , and my Lord instantly secured the appointment for my dear husband . It was intended as a surprise for him,—he was to see it in the papers to - day . Even after that horrid arrest took place ( the expenses of which Lord Steyne generously said he would settle , so that I was in a manner prevented from coming to my husband ’s assistance ) , my Lord was laughing with me , and saying that my dearest Rawdon would be consoled when he read of his appointment in the paper , in that shocking spun — bailiff ’s house . And then — then he came home . His suspicions were excited,—the dreadful scene took place between my Lord and my cruel , cruel Rawdon — and , O my God , what will happen next ? Pitt , dear Pitt ! pity me , and reconcile us ! ”
288517	288531	288497	288497	she	805	“ I am surprised that woman has the audacity to enter this house , ”
288594	288610	288611	288612	Sir Pitt	697	“ How dare Mrs. Crawley to enter the house of — of an honest family ? ”
288640	288660	288661	288661	she	982	“ Tell her that she does not know all . Tell her that I am innocent , dear Pitt , ”
288665	288681	288682	288683	Sir Pitt	697	“ Upon my word , my love , I think you do Mrs. Crawley injustice , ”
288694	288703	288689	288689	Rebecca	982	“ Indeed I believe her to be — — ”
288704	288709	288712	288713	Lady Jane	805	“ To be what ? ”
288729	288841	288715	288715	her	805	“ To be a wicked woman — a heartless mother , a false wife ? She never loved her dear little boy , who used to fly here and tell me of her cruelty to him . She never came into a family but she strove to bring misery with her , and to weaken the most sacred affections with her wicked flattery and falsehood . She has deceived her husband , as she has deceived everybody ; her soul is black with vanity , worldliness , and all sorts of crime . I tremble when I touch her . I keep my children out of her sight . I — — ”
288842	288846	288848	288849	Sir Pitt	697	“ Lady Jane ! ”

You come home from a journey , and find — what?—my Lord Steyne supping at your house in Curzon Street with Mrs. Crawley . Is the circumstance strange or novel ? Has he not been a hundred times before in the same position ? Upon my honour and word as a gentleman , ”
291147	291189	291038	291039	Mr. Wenham	1646	“ I declare I think that your suspicions are monstrous and utterly unfounded , and that they injure an honourable gentleman who has proved his good will toward you by a thousand benefactions — and a most spotless and innocent lady . ”

291209	291225	291206	291207	Mr. Macmurdo	1756	“ I believe that Mrs. Crawley is an innocent as my wife , Mrs. Wenham , ”
291234	291292	291226	291227	Mr. Wenham	1646	“ I believe that , misled by an infernal jealousy , my friend here strikes a blow against not only an infirm and old man of high station , his constant friend and benefactor , but against his wife , his own dearest honour , his son ’s future reputation , and his own prospects in life . ”
291293	291301	291302	291303	Mr. Wenham	1646	“ I will tell you what happened , ”
291309	291496	291302	291303	Mr. Wenham	1646	“ I was sent for this morning by my Lord Steyne , and found him in a pitiable state , as , I need hardly inform Colonel Crawley , any man of age and infirmity would be after a personal conflict with a man of your strength . I say to your face ; it was a cruel advantage you took of that strength , Colonel Crawley . It was not only the body of my noble and excellent friend which was wounded — his heart , sir , was bleeding . A man whom he had loaded with benefits and regarded with affection , had subjected him to the foulest indignity . What was this very appointment , which appears in the journals of to - day , but a proof of his kindness to you ? When I saw his Lordship this morning I found him in a state pitiable indeed to see : and as anxious as you are to revenge the outrage committed upon him , by blood . You know he has given his proofs , I presume , Colonel Crawley ? ”
291497	291504	291506	291507	the Colonel	2871	“ He has plenty of pluck , ”
291509	291517	291506	291507	the Colonel	2871	“ Nobody ever said he had n’t . ”
291518	291546	291547	291547	he	2871	“ His first order to me was to write a letter of challenge , and to carry it to Colonel Crawley . One or other of us , ”
291550	291560	291547	291547	he	2871	“ must not survive the outrage of last night . ”
291564	291574	291575	291575	he	2871	“ You ’re coming to the point , Wenham , ”
291578	291593	291575	291575	he	2871	“ I tried my utmost to calm Lord Steyne . Good God ! sir , ”
291597	291618	291594	291594	I	0	“ how I regret that Mrs. Wenham and myself had not accepted Mrs. Crawley ’s invitation to sup with her ! ”
291619	291628	291629	291630	Captain Macmurdo	1754	“ She asked you to sup with her ? ”
291633	291776	291629	291630	Captain Macmurdo	1754	“ After the Opera . Here ’s the note of invitation — stop — no , this is another paper — I thought I had it , but it ’s of no consequence , and I pledge you my word to the fact . If we had come — and it was only one of Mrs. Wenham ’s headaches which prevented us — she suffers under them a good deal , especially in the spring — if we had come , and you had returned home , there would have been no quarrel , no insult , no suspicion — and so it is positively because my poor wife has a headache that you are to bring death down upon two men of honour , and plunge two of the most excellent and ancient families in the kingdom into disgrace and sorrow . ”
291845	292010	291826	291827	Mr. Wenham	1646	practised—“I sate for an hour or more by Lord Steyne ’s bedside , beseeching , imploring Lord Steyne to forego his intention of demanding a meeting . I pointed out to him that the circumstances were after all suspicious — they were suspicious . I acknowledge it,—any man in your position might have been taken in — I said that a man furious with jealousy is to all intents and purposes a madman , and should be as such regarded — that a duel between you must lead to the disgrace of all parties concerned — that a man of his Lordship ’s exalted station had no right in these days , when the most atrocious revolutionary principles , and the most dangerous levelling doctrines are preached among the vulgar , to create a public scandal ; and that , however innocent , the common people would insist that he was guilty . In fine , I implored him not to send the challenge . ”
292011	292023	292025	292025	Rawdon	794	“ I do n’t believe one word of the whole story , ”
292031	292068	292025	292025	Rawdon	794	“ I believe it a d — — lie , and that you ’re in it , Mr. Wenham . If the challenge do n’t come from him , by Jove it shall come from me . ”
292112	292263	292097	292098	That gentleman	2967	“ You put the affair into my hands , and you shall act as I think fit , by Jove , and not as you do . You have no right to insult Mr. Wenham with this sort of language ; and dammy , Mr. Wenham , you deserve an apology . And as for a challenge to Lord Steyne , you may get somebody else to carry it , I wo n’t . If my lord , after being thrashed , chooses to sit still , dammy let him . And as for the affair with — with Mrs. Crawley , my belief is , there ’s nothing proved at all : that your wife ’s innocent , as innocent as Mr. Wenham says she is : and at any rate , that you would be a d — fool not to take the place and hold your tongue . ”
292264	292276	292277	292278	Mr. Wenham	1646	“ Captain Macmurdo , you speak like a man of sense , ”
292283	292299	292277	292278	Mr. Wenham	1646	relieved—“I forget any words that Colonel Crawley has used in the irritation of the moment . ”
292300	292306	292307	292307	Rawdon	794	“ I thought you would , ”
292314	292323	292324	292325	the Captain	2862	“ Shut your mouth , you old stoopid , ”
292332	292347	292324	292325	the Captain	2862	“ Mr. Wenham ai n’t a fighting man ; and quite right , too . ”
292348	292356	292357	292359	the Steyne emissary	11734	“ This matter , in my belief , ”
292362	292407	292357	292359	the Steyne emissary	11734	“ ought to be buried in the most profound oblivion . A word concerning it should never pass these doors . I speak in the interest of my friend , as well as of Colonel Crawley , who persists in considering me his enemy . ”
292408	292421	292423	292424	Captain Macmurdo	1754	“ I suppose Lord Steyne wo n’t talk about it very much , ”
292426	292486	292423	292424	Captain Macmurdo	1754	“ and I do n’t see why our side should . The affair ai n’t a very pretty one , any way you take it ; and the less said about it the better . It ’s you are thrashed , and not us ; and if you are satisfied , why , I think , we should be . ”
292551	292563	292564	292564	he	1754	“ You do n’t stick at a trifle , Mr. Wenham , ”

You were but a girl , in white , with large ringlets ; you came down singing — do you remember?—and we went to Vauxhall . Since then I have thought of but one woman in the world , and that was you . I think there is no hour in the day has passed for twelve years that I have n’t thought of you . I came to tell you this before I went to India , but you did not care , and I had n’t the heart to speak . You did not care whether I stayed or went . ”

It was he who told me how good and generous you were , and who taught me to love you as a brother . Have you not been everything to me and my boy ? Our dearest , truest , kindest friend and protector ? Had you come a few months sooner perhaps you might have spared me that — that dreadful parting . O , it nearly killed me , William — but you did n’t come , though I wished and prayed for you to come , and they took him too away from me . Is n’t he a noble boy , William ?

The chaps call him ‘ Longtail ’ at school . I gave him the name ; ai n’t it capital ? But Dob reads Latin like English , and French and that ; and when we go out together he tells me stories about my Papa , and never about himself ; though I heard Colonel Buckler , at Grandpapa ’s , say that he was one of the bravest officers in the army , and had distinguished himself ever so much . Grandpapa was quite surprised , and said , ‘ That feller ! why , I did n’t think he could say Bo to a goose’—but I know he could , could n’t he , Mamma ? ”

I do n’t owe any man a shillin on the contrary , I lent my old college friend , Jack Lazarus , fifty pounds , for which my executors will not press him .

We know whom you saw at Paris , and what relations you found there . Yes , Madame may stare , but we do . How was it that no minister on the Continent would receive Madame ? She has offended somebody : who never forgives — whose rage redoubled when he saw you . He was like a madman last night when he came home . Madame de Belladonna made him a scene about you , and fired off in one of her furies . ”

I was the truest wife that ever lived , though I married my husband out of pique , because somebody else — but never mind that . I was true , and he trampled upon me , and deserted me . I was the fondest mother .

352401	352408	352409	352411	the young gentleman	2842	“ Hullo ! where ’s Dob ? ”
352421	352431	352432	352433	his mother	2493	“ Major Dobbin is dining out , I suppose , ”

352511	352518	352533	352533	she	982	said—“he is just like my — — ”
352644	352648	352650	352650	Georgy	2015	“ I say , ”
352652	352658	352659	352659	Becky	982	“ What do you say ? ”
352664	352680	352659	352659	Becky	982	“ You ’re the lady I saw in the mask at the Rouge et Noir . ”
352681	352689	352690	352690	Becky	982	“ Hush ! you little sly creature , ”
352701	352715	352690	352690	Becky	982	“ Your uncle was there , too , and mamma must n’t know . ”
352716	352725	352727	352729	the little fellow	12063	“ Oh no — not by no means , ”
352731	352741	352742	352742	Becky	982	“ You see we are quite good friends already , ”
353482	353492	353493	353493	he	1326	“ I — I beg your pardon , ma’am , ”
353496	353518	353493	353493	he	1326	“ but I am bound to tell you that it is not as your friend that I am come here now . ”
353519	353534	353535	353535	Jos	674	“ Pooh ! damn ; do n’t let us have this sort of thing ! ”
353550	353562	353563	353563	Amelia	632	“ I wonder what Major Dobbin has to say against Rebecca ? ”
353587	353600	353601	353601	Jos	674	“ I will not have this sort of thing in my house , ”
353605	353627	353601	353601	Jos	674	“ I say I will not have it : and Dobbin , I beg , sir , you ’ll stop it . ”
353650	353654	353655	353655	Rebecca	982	“ Dear friend ! ”
353661	353673	353655	353655	Rebecca	982	“ do hear what Major Dobbin has to say against me . ”

353708	353715	353716	353716	Amelia	632	“ We are only two women , ”
353719	353727	353716	353716	Amelia	632	“ You can speak now , sir . ”
353728	353742	353743	353744	the Major	18559	“ This manner towards me is one which scarcely becomes you , Amelia , ”
353748	353779	353743	353744	the Major	18559	“ nor I believe am I guilty of habitual harshness to women . It is not a pleasure to me to do the duty which I am come to do . ”
353780	353794	353796	353796	Amelia	632	“ Pray proceed with it quickly , if you please , Major Dobbin , ”
353826	353891	353815	353815	she	632	“ I came to say — and as you stay , Mrs. Crawley , I must say it in your presence — that I think you — you ought not to form a member of the family of my friends . A lady who is separated from her husband , who travels not under her own name , who frequents public gaming - tables — ”
353892	353901	353904	353904	Becky	982	“ It was to the ball I went , ”
353906	353920	353921	353921	Dobbin	1326	“ — is not a fit companion for Mrs. Osborne and her son , ”
353925	353964	353921	353921	Dobbin	1326	“ and I may add that there are people here who know you , and who profess to know that regarding your conduct , about which I do n’t even wish to speak before — before Mrs. Osborne . ”
353965	353980	353981	353981	Rebecca	982	“ Yours is a very modest and convenient sort of calumny , Major Dobbin , ”
353984	354184	353981	353981	Rebecca	982	“ You leave me under the weight of an accusation which , after all , is unsaid . What is it ? Is it unfaithfulness to my husband ? I scorn it , and defy anybody to prove it — I defy you , I say . My honour is as untouched as that of the bitterest enemy who ever maligned me . Is it of being poor , forsaken , wretched , that you accuse me ? Yes , I am guilty of those faults , and punished for them every day . Let me go , Emmy . It is only to suppose that I have not met you , and I am no worse to - day than I was yesterday . It is only to suppose that the night is over and the poor wanderer is on her way . Do n’t you remember the song we used to sing in old , dear old days ? I have been wandering ever since then — a poor castaway , scorned for being miserable , and insulted because I am alone . Let me go : my stay here interferes with the plans of this gentleman . ”
354185	354192	354194	354195	the Major	18559	“ Indeed it does , madam , ”
354197	354207	354194	354195	the Major	18559	“ If I have any authority in this house — ”
354208	354213	354216	354216	Amelia	632	“ Authority , none ! ”
354218	354257	354216	354216	Amelia	632	“ Rebecca , you stay with me . I wo n’t desert you , because you have been persecuted , or insult you , because — because Major Dobbin chooses to do so . Come away , dear . ”
354286	354296	354279	354279	he	1326	said—“Will you stay a moment and speak to me ? ”
354297	354308	354310	354310	Becky	982	“ He wishes to speak to you away from me , ”
354324	354340	354341	354341	Dobbin	1326	“ Upon my honour it is not about you that I am going to speak , ”
354344	354350	354341	354341	Dobbin	1326	“ Come back , Amelia , ”
354388	354398	354399	354400	the Major	18559	“ I was confused when I spoke just now , ”
354407	354415	354399	354400	the Major	18559	“ and I misused the word authority . ”
354416	354420	354422	354422	Amelia	632	“ You did , ”
354429	354439	354440	354440	Dobbin	1326	“ At least I have claims to be heard , ”
354443	354456	354457	354458	the woman	4022	“ It is generous to remind me of our obligations to you , ”
354461	354476	354477	354477	William	1326	“ The claims I mean , are those left me by George ’s father , ”
354480	354507	354509	354509	Amelia	632	“ Yes , and you insulted his memory . You did yesterday . You know you did . And I will never forgive you . Never ! ”
354525	354534	354535	354535	William	1326	“ You do n’t mean that , Amelia ? ”
354540	354634	354535	354535	William	1326	“ You do n’t mean that these words , uttered in a hurried moment , are to weigh against a whole life ’s devotion ? I think that George ’s memory has not been injured by the way in which I have dealt with it , and if we are come to bandying reproaches , I at least merit none from his widow and the mother of his son . Reflect , afterwards when — when you are at leisure , and your conscience will withdraw this accusation . It does even now , ”
354641	354650	354651	354651	he	1326	“ It is not that speech of yesterday , ”
354654	354901	354651	354651	he	1326	“ which moves you . That is but the pretext , Amelia , or I have loved you and watched you for fifteen years in vain . Have I not learned in that time to read all your feelings , and look into your thoughts ? I know what your heart is capable of : it can cling faithfully to a recollection , and cherish a fancy ; but it ca n’t feel such an attachment as mine deserves to mate with , and such as I would have won from a woman more generous than you . No , you are not worthy of the love which I have devoted to you . I knew all along that the prize I had set my life on was not worth the winning ; that I was a fool , with fond fancies , too , bartering away my all of truth and ardour against your little feeble remnant of love . I will bargain no more . I withdraw . I find no fault with you . You are very good - natured , and have done your best ; but you couldn’t — you could n’t reach up to the height of the attachment which I bore you , and which a loftier soul than yours might have been proud to share . Good - bye , Amelia ! I have watched your struggle . Let it end . We are both weary of it . ”
355010	355022	355023	355023	she	632	“ Am I to understand then,—that you are going — away,—William ? ”
355032	355038	355039	355039	he	1326	“ I went once before , ”
355042	355072	355039	355039	he	1326	“ and came back after twelve years . We were young then , Amelia . Good - bye . I have spent enough of my life at this play . ”
355130	355139	355140	355140	she	982	“ What a noble heart that man has , ”
355143	355153	355140	355140	she	982	“ and how shamefully that woman plays with it ! ”
355185	355188	355189	355189	she	982	“ Ah ! ”
355192	355223	355189	355189	she	982	“ if I could have had such a husband as that — a man with a heart and brains , too ! I would not have minded his large feet ; ”

They have been absent from England fourteen years , having been embarked the year after Waterloo , in which glorious conflict they took an active part , and having subsequently distinguished themselves in the Burmese war . The veteran colonel , Sir Michael O’Dowd , K.C.B. , with his lady and sister , landed here yesterday , with Captains Posky , Stubble , Macraw , Malony ; Lieutenants Smith , Jones , Thompson , F. Thomson ; Ensigns Hicks and Grady ; the band on the pier playing the national anthem , and the crowd loudly cheering the gallant veterans as they went into Wayte ’s hotel , where a sumptuous banquet was provided for the defenders of Old England . During the repast , which we need not say was served up in Wayte ’s best style , the cheering continued so enthusiastically that Lady O’Dowd and the Colonel came forward to the balcony and drank the healths of their fellow - countrymen in a bumper of Wayte ’s best claret . ”
359382	359460	359376	359376	William	1326	“ It was myself I deluded , and persisted in cajoling ; had she been worthy of the love I gave her , she would have returned it long ago . It was a fond mistake . Is n’t the whole course of life made up of such ? and suppose I had won her , should I not have been disenchanted the day after my victory ? Why pine , or be ashamed of my defeat ? ”
359481	359489	359490	359490	he	1326	“ I ’ll go into harness again , ”
359493	359626	359490	359490	he	1326	“ and do my duty in that state of life in which it has pleased Heaven to place me . I will see that the buttons of the recruits are properly bright , and that the sergeants make no mistakes in their accounts . I will dine at mess , and listen to the Scotch surgeon telling his stories . When I am old and broken , I will go on half - pay , and my old sisters shall scold me . I have ‘ geliebt und gelebet ’ as the girl in Wallenstein says . I am done.—Pay the bills and get me a cigar : find out what there is at the play to - night , Francis ; to - morrow we cross by the ‘ Batavier . ’ ”

I wo n’t have you harassed by them : and they will insult you if you stay . I tell you they are rascals ; men fit to send to the hulks . Never mind how I know them . I know everybody . Jos ca n’t protect you , he is too weak , and wants a protector himself . You are no more fit to live in the world than a baby in arms . You must marry , or you and your precious boy will go to ruin . You must have a husband , you fool ; and one of the best gentlemen I ever saw was offered you a hundred times , and you have rejected him , you silly , heartless , ungrateful little creature ! ”

Why , the man was weary of you , and would have jilted you , but that Dobbin forced him to keep his word . He owned it to me . He never cared for you . He used to sneer about you to me , time after time ; and made love to me the week after he married you . ”
