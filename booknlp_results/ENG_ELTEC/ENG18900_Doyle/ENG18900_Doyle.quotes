Your brain may , as you say , be roused and excited , but it is a pathological and morbid process , which involves increased tissue - change and may at last leave a permanent weakness . You know , too , what a black reaction comes upon you . Surely the game is hardly worth the candle . Why should you , for a mere passing pleasure , risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed ? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another , but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable . " He did not seem offended . On the contrary , he put his finger - tips together , and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair , like one who has a relish for conversation . '

I confess , too , that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings . More than once during the years that I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion 's quiet and didactic manner . I made no remark , however , but sat nursing my wounded leg . I had had a Jezail bullet through it some time before , and , though it did not prevent me from walking , it ached wearily at every change of the weather . '

1941	2057	1926	1926	I	0	' he remarked , chuckling at my surprise—'so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous ; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction . Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep . Just opposite the Wigmore Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth , which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering . The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found , as far as I know , nowhere else in the neighbourhood . So much is observation . The rest is deduction . '
2058	2069	1926	1926	I	0	' How , then , did you deduce the telegram ? '
2070	2150	1926	1926	I	0	' Why , of course I knew that you had not written a letter , since I sat opposite to you all morning . I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of postcards . What could you go into the post - office for , then , but to send a wire ? Eliminate all other factors , and the one which remains must be the truth . '

2213	2242	2210	2210	he	230	' it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine . I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me . '
2243	2320	2321	2321	I	0	' I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it . Now , I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession . Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner ? '
2425	2432	2433	2433	he	230	' There are hardly any data , '
2436	2453	2433	2433	he	230	' The watch has been recently cleaned , which robs me of my most suggestive facts . '
2454	2459	2460	2460	I	0	' You are right , '
2463	2473	2460	2460	I	0	' It was cleaned before being sent to me . '
2505	2517	2518	2518	he	230	' Though unsatisfactory , my research has not been entirely barren , '
2532	2557	2518	2518	he	230	' Subject to your correction , I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother , who inherited it from your father . '
2558	2574	2460	2460	I	0	' That you gather , no doubt , from the H. W. upon the back ? '
2575	2666	2518	2518	he	230	' Quite so . The W. suggests your own name . The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back , and the initials are as old as the watch : so it was made for the last generation . Jewellery usually descends to the eldest son , and he is most likely to have the same name as the father . Your father has , if I remember right , been dead many years . It has , therefore , been in the hands of your eldest brother . '
2667	2673	2675	2675	I.	232	' Right , so far , '
2676	2680	2675	2675	I.	232	' Anything else ? '
2681	2739	2740	2740	I	0	' He was a man of untidy habits — very untidy and careless . He was left with good prospects , but he threw away his chances , lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity , and finally , taking to drink , he died . That is all I can gather . '
2758	2767	2768	2768	I	0	' This is unworthy of you , Holmes , '
2771	2846	2768	2768	I	0	' I could not have believed that you would have descended to this . You have made inquiries into the history of my unhappy brother , and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way . You can not expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch ! It is unkind , and , to speak plainly , has a touch of charlatanism in it . '
2847	2852	2854	2854	he	234	' My dear doctor , '
2857	2909	2854	2854	he	234	' pray accept my apologies . Viewing the matter as an abstract problem , I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you . I assure you , however , that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch . '
2910	2935	2768	2768	I	0	' Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts ? They are absolutely correct in every particular . '
2936	2966	2768	2768	I	0	' Ah , that is good luck . I could only say what was the balance of probability . I did not at all expect to be so accurate . '
2967	2977	2768	2768	I	0	' But it was not mere guess - work ? '
2978	3144	3145	3145	I	0	' No , no : I never guess . It is a shocking habit — destructive to the logical faculty . What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend . For example , I began by stating that your brother was careless . When you observe the lower part of that watch - case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places , but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects , such as coins or keys , in the same pocket . Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty - guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man . Neither is it a very farfetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects . '
3156	3344	3151	3151	I	0	' It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England , when they take a watch , to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin - point upon the inside of the case . It is more handy than a label , as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed . There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case . Inference — that your brother was often at low water . Secondary inference — that he had occasional bursts of prosperity , or he could not have redeemed the pledge . Finally , I ask you to look at the inner plate , which contains the keyhole . Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole — marks where the key has slipped . What sober man 's key could have scored those grooves ? But you will never see a drunkard 's watch without them . He winds it at night , and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand . Where is the mystery in all this ? '
3345	3353	3354	3354	I	0	' It is as clear as daylight , '
3357	3392	3354	3354	I	0	' I regret the injustice which I did you . I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty . May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present ? '
3393	3502	3503	3503	I	0	' None . Hence the cocaine . I can not live without brain - work . What else is there to live for ? Stand at the window here . Was ever such a dreary , dismal , unprofitable world ? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the duncoloured houses . What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material ? What is the use of having powers , doctor , when one has no field upon which to exert them ? Crime is commonplace , existence is commonplace , and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth . '

3792	3802	3803	3803	she	116	' I have come to you , Mr. Holmes , '
3806	3835	3803	3803	she	116	' because you once enabled my employer , Mrs. Cecil Forrester , to unravel a little domestic complication . She was much impressed by your kindness and skill . '
3836	3841	3842	3842	he	108	' Mrs. Cecil Forrester , '
3846	3875	3842	3842	he	108	' I believe that I was of some slight service to her . The case , however , as I remember it , was a very simple one . '
3876	3916	3917	3917	Holmes	108	' She did not think so . But at least you can not say the same of mine . I can hardly imagine anything more strange , more utterly inexplicable , than the situation in which I find myself . '
3950	3955	3957	3957	he	108	' State your case , '
3975	3986	3987	3987	I	0	' You will , I am sure , excuse me , '
4011	4016	4017	4017	she	1322	' If your friend , '
4020	4037	4017	4017	she	1322	' would be good enough to stop , he might be of inestimable service to me . '
4044	4047	4048	4048	she	1322	' Briefly , '
4051	4135	4048	4048	she	1322	' the facts are these . My father was an officer in an Indian regiment , who sent me home when I was quite a child . My mother was dead , and I had no relative in England . I was placed , however , in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh , and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age . In the year 1878 my father , who was senior captain of his regiment , obtained twelve months '

Standing at the window , I watched her walking briskly down the street , until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd . '
5337	5361	5363	5363	she	287	' I exclaimed , turning to my companion . He had lit his pipe again , and was leaning back with drooping eyelids . '

5688	5920	5680	5680	I	0	' I sat in the window with the volume in my hand , but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer . My mind ran upon our late visitor — her smiles , the deep rich tones of her voice , the strange mystery which overhung her life . If she were seventeen at the time of her father 's disappearance she must be seven - and - twenty now — a sweet age , when youth has lost its self - consciousness and become a little sobered by experience . So I sat and mused , until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology . What was I , an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking account , that I should dare to think of such things ? She was a unit , a factor — nothing more . If my future were black , it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will - o'-the - wisps of the imagination . It was half - past five before Holmes returned . He was bright , eager , and in excellent spirits , a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression . '

6345	6457	6458	6459	Major Sholto	122	' I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick , but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket . It was clear that he thought that our night 's work might be a serious one . Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak , and her sensitive face was composed , but pale . She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking , yet her self - control was perfect , and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her .

6826	7204	6820	6820	I	0	' He leaned back in the cab , and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently . Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome , but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey . It was a September evening , and not yet seven o'clock , but the day had been a dreary one , and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city . Mud - coloured clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets . Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement . The yellow glare from the shop - windows streamed out into the steamy , vaporous air , and threw a murky , shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare . There was , to my mind , something eerie and ghost - like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light — sad faces and glad , haggard and merry . Like all human kind , they flitted from the gloom into the light , and so back into the gloom once more . I am not subject to impressions , but the dull , heavy evening , with the strange business upon which we were engaged , combined to make me nervous and depressed . I could see from Miss Morstan 's manner that she was suffering from the same feeling . Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences . He held his open notebook upon his knee , and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket - lantern . At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side - entrances . In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four - wheelers were rattling up , discharging their cargoes of shirt - fronted men and be - shawled , be - diamonded women . We had hardly reached the third pillar , which was our rendezvous , before a small , dark , brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us . '
7215	7219	7220	7220	I	0	' he asked . '
7233	7250	7251	7251	You	328	' said she . He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us . '
7258	7268	7256	7256	miss	332	' he said , with a certain dogged manner , '
7291	7292	7293	7293	I	0	' '
7301	7607	7293	7293	I	0	' she answered . He gave a shrill whistle , on which a street arab led across a four - wheeler and opened the door . The man who had addressed us mounted to the box , while we took our places inside . We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse , and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets . The situation was a curious one . We were driving to an unknown place , on an unknown errand . Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax — which was an inconceivable hypothesis — or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey . Miss Morstan 's demeanour was as resolute and collected as ever . I endeavoured to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan ; but , to tell the truth , I was myself so excited at our situation , and so curious as to our destination , that my stories were slightly involved . To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night , and how I fired a double - barrelled tiger cub at it . At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving ; but soon , what with our pace , the fog , and my own limited knowledge of London , I lost my bearings , and knew nothing , save that we seemed to be going a very long way . Sherlock Holmes was never at fault , however , and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by - streets . '
7611	7615	7293	7293	I	0	' said he . '
7661	7707	7653	7653	You	337	' We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames , with the lamps shining upon the broad , silent water ; but our cab dashed on , and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side . '
7711	7716	7653	7653	You	337	' said my companion . '
7747	7930	7734	7734	Our	336	' We had indeed reached a questionable and forbidding neighbourhood . Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public - houses at the corner . Then came rows of two - storied villas , each with a fronting of miniature garden , and then again interminable lines of new , staring brick buildings — the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country . At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace . None of the other houses were inhabited , and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbours , save for a single glimmer in the kitchen - window . On our knocking , however , the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant , clad in a yellow turban , white loose - fitting clothes , and a yellow sash . There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace doorway of a third - rate suburban dwelling - house . '
7936	7957	7734	7734	Our	336	' said he , and even as he spoke there came a high , piping voice from some inner room . '
7966	7970	7964	7964	khitmutgar	128	' it cried . '
7978	8171	8172	8173	Your servant	342	' We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage , ill - lit and worse furnished , until he came to a door upon the right , which he threw open . A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us , and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head , a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it , and a bald , shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain - peak from fir - trees . He writhed his hands together as he stood , and his features were in a perpetual jerk — now smiling , now scowling , but never for an instant in repose . Nature had given him a pendulous lip , and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth , which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face . In spite of his obtrusive baldness , he gave the impression of youth . In point of fact , he had just turned his thirtieth year . '
8178	8190	8175	8176	Miss Morstan	116	' he kept repeating , in a thin , high voice . '
8228	8391	8392	8394	Mr. Thaddeus Sholto	120	' We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us . In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass . The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls , looped back here and there to expose some richly - mounted painting or Oriental vase . The carpet was of amber and black , so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it , as into a bed of moss . Two great tiger - skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury , as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner . A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room . As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odour . '
8396	8407	8392	8394	Mr. Thaddeus Sholto	120	' said the little man , still jerking and smiling . '
8425	8426	8422	8423	these gentlemen	349	' '
8438	8439	8440	8441	A doctor	350	' '
8445	8452	8440	8441	A doctor	350	' cried he , much excited . '
8504	8543	8495	8495	I	0	' I listened to his heart , as requested , but was unable to find anything amiss , save , indeed , that he was in an ecstasy of fear , for he shivered from head to foot . '
8550	8554	8495	8495	I	0	' I said . '
8562	8563	8564	8564	You	332	' '
8573	8578	8570	8571	Miss Morstan	116	' he remarked airily . '
8629	8672	8673	8673	I	0	' I could have struck the man across the face , so hot was I at this callous and off - hand reference to so delicate a matter . Miss Morstan sat down , and her face grew white to the lips . '
8683	8687	8673	8673	I	0	' said she . '
8695	8699	8688	8688	I	0	' said he ; '

8938	8997	8930	8930	I	0	' He applied a taper to the great bowl , and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rosewater . We sat all three in a semicircle , with our heads advanced and our chins upon our hands , while the strange , jerky little fellow , with his high , shining head , puffed uneasily in the centre . '
9009	9013	9014	9014	I	0	' said he , '
9219	9220	9221	9221	You	116	' '
9229	9234	9221	9221	You	116	' said Miss Morstan , '
9270	9271	9281	9281	he	120	' '
9284	9357	9281	9281	he	120	' for we shall certainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew . We shall all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew . He is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me . I had quite high words with him last night . You can not imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry . '
9358	9378	9379	9379	I	0	' If we are to go to Norwood , it would perhaps be as well to start at once , '
9393	9399	9400	9400	he	120	' That would hardly do , '
9403	9478	9400	9400	he	120	' I do n't know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden way . No , I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other . In the first place , I must tell you that there are several points in the story of which I am myself ignorant . I can only lay the facts before you as far as I know them myself . '
9573	9667	9565	9565	Bartholomew	130	' I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of Captain Morstan . We read the details in the papers , and , knowing that he had been a friend of our father 's , we discussed the case freely in his presence . He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened . Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast , that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan . '
9825	9941	9957	9957	He	389	' Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him . He nearly fainted at the breakfast - table when he opened it , and from that day he sickened to his death . What was in the letter we could never discover , but I could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand . He had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen , but he now became rapidly worse , and towards the end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope , and that he wished to make a last communication to us . '
10016	10201	10212	10212	he	0	' " I have only one thing , " he said , " which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment . It is my treatment of poor Morstan 's orphan . The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure , half at least of which should have been hers . And yet I have made no use of it myself , so blind and foolish a thing is avarice . The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another . See that chaplet tipped with pearls beside the quinine - bottle . Even that I could not bear to part with , although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her . You , my sons , will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure . But send her nothing — not even the chaplet — until I am gone . After all , men have been as bad as this and have recovered . '
10396	10523	10380	10380	I	0	' " For a long time I sat half distracted , wondering what I should do . My first impulse was , of course , to call for assistance ; but I could not but recognise that there was every chance that I would be accused of his murder . His death at the moment of a quarrel , and the gash in his head , would be black against me . Again , an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure , which I was particularly anxious to keep secret . He had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone . There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know . '
10560	10567	10568	10568	he	138	' Do not fear , Sahib , '
10571	10594	10568	10568	he	138	' no one need know that you have killed him . Let us hide him away , and who is the wiser ? '
10595	10602	10604	10604	I.	0	' I did not kill him , '
10613	10621	10623	10623	he	138	' I heard it all , Sahib , '
10625	10657	10623	10623	he	138	' I heard you quarrel , and I heard the blow . But my lips are sealed . All are asleep in the house . Let us put him away together . '
10799	10943	10944	10944	We	401	' At this instant a horrible change came over his expression ; his eyes stared wildly , his jaw dropped , and he yelled , in a voice which I can never forget , " Keep him out ! For Christ 's sake keep him out ! " We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed . A face was looking in at us out of the darkness . We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass . It was a bearded , hairy face , with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence . My brother and I rushed towards the window , but the man was gone . When we returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat . '
11142	11324	11325	11326	My brother	387	' The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments . We had all sat absorbed , listening to his extraordinary narrative . At the short account of her father 's death Miss Morstan had turned deadly white , and for a moment I feared that she was about to faint . She rallied , however , on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured our for her from a Venetian carafe upon the side - table . Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes . As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life . Here at least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost . Mr. Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story had produced , and then continued between the puffs of his overgrown pipe . '
11330	11334	11328	11328	I	0	' said he , '
11528	11529	11498	11498	him	1326	' '
11536	11542	11498	11498	him	1326	' said our companion earnestly ; '
11550	11559	11498	11498	him	1326	' The little man waved his hand deprecatingly . '
11565	11569	11560	11560	We	414	' he said ; '
11749	11792	11727	11727	I	0	' Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased , and sat twitching on his luxurious settee . We all remained silent , with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business had taken . Holmes was the first to spring to his feet . '
11805	11809	11798	11798	sir	1321	' said he . '
11861	11941	11942	11942	My	0	' Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his hookah , and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs . This he buttoned tightly up , in spite of the extreme closeness of the night , and finished his attire by putting on a rabbitskin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears , so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face . '
11948	11961	11942	11942	My	0	' he remarked , as he led the way down the passage . '
11970	12015	11962	11962	I	0	' Our cab was awaiting us outside , and our programme was evidently prearranged , for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace . Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly , in a voice which rose high above the rattle of the wheels . '
12022	12026	12018	12020	a clever fellow	426	' said he . '
12240	12479	12224	12224	He	130	' At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open - eyed . Miss Morstan , could we secure her rights , would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England . Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news ; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul , and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me . I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation , and then sat downcast , with my head drooped , deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance . He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac , and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms , and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums , some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket . I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night . Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor - oil , while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative . However that may be , I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door . '
12489	12648	12482	12483	Miss Morstan	116	' said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto , as he handed her out . It was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our night 's adventures . We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us , and the night was fairly fine . A warm wind blew from the westward , and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky , with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts . It was clearenough to see for some distance , but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the sidelamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way . Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds , and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass . A single narrow iron - clamped door formed the only means of entrance . On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman - like rat - tat . '
12653	12661	12664	12664	I	0	' cried a gruff voice from within . '
12677	12726	12728	12728	you	0	' There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys . The door swung heavily back , and a short , deepchested man stood in the opening , with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling , distrustful eyes . '
12749	12750	12753	12753	McMurdo	141	' '

12779	12823	12774	12774	He	387	' his room to - day , Mr. Thaddeus , and I have no orders . You know very well that I must stick to regulations . I can let you in , but your friends they must just stop where they are . '
12842	12852	12853	12853	he	120	' This is too bad of you , McMurdo ! '
12856	12888	12853	12853	he	120	' If I guarantee them , that is enough for you . There is the young lady , too . She can not wait on the public road at this hour . '
12889	12896	12898	12899	the porter	439	' Very sorry , Mr. Thaddeus , '
12902	12908	12909	12909	yours	440	' Folk may be friends o '

12957	12963	12952	12952	you	440	' cried Sherlock Holmes genially . '
13000	13001	13003	13005	Mr. Sherlock Holmes	108	' '
13007	13014	13015	13015	God	143	' roared the prize - fighter . '

13185	13265	13180	13180	I	0	' Inside , a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house , square and prosaic , all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window . The vast size of the building , with its gloom and its deathly silence , struck a chill to the heart . Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease , and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand . '
13272	13276	13180	13180	I	0	' he said . '
13313	13314	13316	13316	he	130	' '

13492	13563	13566	13567	Mrs. Bernstone	144	' He held up the lantern , and his hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us . Miss Morstan seized my wrist , and we all stood , with thumping hearts , straining our ears . From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds — the shrill , broken whimpering of a frightened woman . '
13569	13573	13566	13567	Mrs. Bernstone	144	' said Sholto . '
13594	13629	13586	13586	I	0	' He hurried for the door , and knocked in his peculiar way . We could see a tall old woman admit him , and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him . '
13658	13858	13656	13656	sir	1321	' We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone . Our guide had left us the lantern . Holmes swung it slowly round , and peered keenly at the house , and at the great rubbish - heaps which cumbered the grounds . Miss Morstan and I stood together , and her hand was in mine . A wondrous subtle thing is love , for here were we two , who had never seen each other before that day , between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed , and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other . I have marvelled at it since , but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so , and , as she has often told me , there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection . So we stood hand - in - hand , like two children , and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us . '
13864	13871	13656	13656	sir	1321	' she said , looking round . '

13920	13924	13905	13906	the prospectors	467	' said Holmes . '
13959	13989	13935	13935	You	469	' At that moment the door of the house burst open , and Thaddeus Sholto came running out , with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes . '

14013	14048	14006	14006	My	0	' He was , indeed , half blubbering with fear , and his twitching , feeble face peeping out from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless , appealing expression of a terrified child . '

14070	14075	14076	14076	I	0	' pleaded Thaddeus Sholto . '
14086	14142	14076	14076	I	0	' We all followed him into the housekeeper 's room , which stood upon the left - hand side of the passage . The old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless , picking fingers , but the sight of Miss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her . '
14151	14160	14145	14145	your	130	' she cried , with an hysterical sob . '
14180	14214	14172	14172	I	0	' Our companion patted her thin , work - worn hand , and murmured some few words of kindly , womanly comfort which brought the colour back into the other 's bloodless cheeks . '
14227	14231	14218	14218	himself	473	' she explained . '
14318	14597	14308	14308	him	145	' Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way , for Thaddeus Sholto 's teeth were chattering in his head . So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs , for his knees were trembling under him . Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoanut - matting which served as a stair - carpet . He walked slowly from step to step , holding the lamp low , and shooting keen glances to right and left . Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper . The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length , with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left . Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way , while we kept close at his heels , with our long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor . The third door was that which we were seeking . Holmes knocked without receiving any answer , and then tried to turn the handle and force it open . It was locked on the inside , however , and by a broad and powerful bolt , as we could see when we set our lamp up against it . The key being turned , however , the hole was not entirely closed . Sherlock Holmes bent down to it , and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath . '
14607	14621	14605	14605	Watson	109	' said he , more moved than I had ever before seen him . '
14629	14800	14624	14624	you	109	' I stooped to the hole , and recoiled in horror . Moonlight was streaming into the room , and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance . Looking straight at me , and suspended , as it were , in the air , for all beneath was in shadow , there hung a face — the very face of our companion Thaddeus . There was the same high , shining head , the same circular bristle of red hair , the same bloodless countenance . The features were set , however , in a horrible smile , a fixed and unnatural grin , which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion . So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us . Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins . '
14805	14811	14624	14624	you	109	' I said to Holmes . '
14818	14819	14624	14624	you	109	' '
14826	15185	15186	15186	You	474	' he answered , and , springing against it , he put all his weight upon the lock . It creaked and groaned , but did not yield . Together we flung ourselves upon it once more , and this time it gave way with a sudden snap , and we found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto 's chamber . It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory . A double line of glass - stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door , and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners , test - tubes , and retorts . In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets . One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken , for a stream of dark - coloured liquid had trickled out from it , and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent , tar - like odour . A set of steps stood at one side of the room , in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster , and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through . At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together . By the table , in a wooden arm - chair , the master of the house was seated all in a heap , with his head sunk upon his left shoulder , and that ghastly , inscrutable smile upon his face . He was stiff and cold , and had clearly been dead many hours . It seemed to me that not only his features , but all his limbs , were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion . By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument — a brown , closegrained stick , with a stone head like a hammer , rudely lashed on with coarse twine . Beside it was a torn sheet of note - paper with some words scrawled upon it . Holmes glanced at it , and then handed it to me . '
15189	15216	15186	15186	You	474	' he said , with a significant raising of the eyebrows . In the light of the lantern I read , with a thrill of horror , '
15223	15224	15186	15186	You	474	' '
15236	15240	15226	15226	God	143	' I asked . '
15245	15255	15226	15226	God	143	' said he , stooping over the dead man . '
15265	15285	15226	15226	God	143	' He pointed to what looked like a long dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear . '
15292	15295	15226	15226	God	143	' said I. '
15316	15355	15226	15226	God	143	' I took it up between my finger and thumb . It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind . One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been . '
15365	15368	15226	15226	God	143	' said I. '
15376	15377	15226	15226	God	143	' '
15382	15386	15226	15226	God	143	' he answered , '
15406	15457	15392	15392	I	0	' We had almost forgotten our companion 's presence since we entered the chamber . He was still standing in the doorway , the very picture of terror , wringing his hands and moaning to himself . Suddenly , however , he broke out into a sharp , querulous cry . '
15463	15467	15468	15468	They	475	' he said . '
15523	15524	15512	15512	him	0	' '

15621	15637	15638	15638	You	482	' He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy . '
15648	15660	15638	15638	You	482	' said Holmes kindly , putting his hand upon his shoulder ; '
15695	15719	15687	15687	We	487	' The little man obeyed in a half - stupefied fashion , and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark . '
15724	15732	15722	15722	Watson	109	' said Holmes , rubbing his hands , '
15790	15791	15754	15754	I	0	' '
15794	15798	15754	15754	I	0	' I ejaculated . '
15801	15819	15754	15754	I	0	' said he , with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class . '
15871	15996	15997	15997	I	0	' He carried the lamp across to it , muttering his observations aloud the while , but addressing them to himself rather than to me . Window is snibbed on the inner side . Framework is solid . No hinges at the side . Let us open it . No water - pipe near . Roof quite out of reach . Yet a man has mounted by the window . It rained a little last night . Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill . And here is a circular muddy mark , and here again upon the floor , and here again by the table . See here , Watson ! This is really a very pretty demonstration . '
16009	16016	16018	16018	I.	0	' That is not a footmark , '
16019	16071	16018	16018	I.	0	' It is something much more valuable to us . It is the impression of a wooden stump . You see here on the sill is the boot - mark , a heavy boot with a broad metal heel , and beside it is the mark of the timber - toe . '
16072	16081	15997	15997	I	0	' It is the wooden - legged man . '
16082	16108	16109	16109	I	0	' Quite so . But there has been someone else — a very able and efficient ally . Could you scale that wall , doctor ? '
16162	16168	16169	16169	I	0	' It is absolutely impossible , '
16172	16294	16295	16295	he	492	' Without aid it is so . But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner , securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall . Then , I think , if you were an active man , you might swarm up , wooden leg and all . You would depart , of course , in the same fashion , and your ally would draw up the rope , untie it from the hook , shut the window , snib it on the inside , and get away in the way that he originally came . As a minor point , it may be noted , '
16302	16366	16295	16295	he	492	' that our wooden - legged friend , though a fair climber , was not a professional sailor . His hands were far from horny . My lens discloses more than one blood - mark , especially towards the end of the rope , from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand . '
16367	16374	16376	16376	I	0	' This is all very well , '
16378	16401	16376	16376	I	0	' but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever . How about this mysterious ally ? How came he into the room ? '
16402	16408	16410	16410	Holmes	108	' Yes , the ally ! '
16413	16470	16410	16410	Holmes	108	' There are features of interest about this ally . He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace . I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country — though parallel cases suggest themselves from India , and , if my memory serves me , from Senegambia . '
16471	16478	16479	16479	I	0	' How came he , then ? '
16482	16499	16479	16479	I	0	' The door is locked ; the window is inaccessible . Was it through the chimney ? '
16500	16508	16509	16509	he	108	' The grate is much too small , '
16512	16520	16509	16509	he	108	' I had already considered that possibility . '
16521	16526	16527	16527	I	0	' How , then ? '
16530	16538	16539	16539	he	108	' You will not apply my precept , '
16546	16620	16543	16543	his	108	' How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth ? We know that he did not come through the door , the window , or the chimney . We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room , as there is no concealment possible . Whence , then , did he come ? '
16621	16631	16632	16632	I	0	' He came through the hole in the roof ! '
16635	16681	16682	16682	He	108	' Of course he did . He must have done so . If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me , we shall now extend our researches to the room above — the secret room in which the treasure was found . '
16816	16824	16826	16827	Sherlock Holmes	108	' Here you are , you see , '
16837	16896	16897	16897	He	108	' This is a trapdoor which leads out on to the roof . I can press it back , and here is the roof itself , sloping at a gentle angle . This , then , is the way by which Number One entered . Let us see if we can find some other traces of his individuality ? '
16980	16981	16982	16982	Holmes	108	' '
16984	16992	16982	16982	Holmes	108	' I said , in a whisper , '
17001	17013	17014	17014	I	0	' He had recovered his self - possession in an instant . '
17021	17025	17014	17014	I	0	' he said , '

17143	17147	17132	17132	I	0	' I answered . '
17157	17168	17169	17169	I	0	' he said , in an off - hand way . '
17185	17317	17181	17181	I	0	' He whipped out his lens and a tape measure , and hurried about the room on his knees , measuring , comparing , examining , with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks , and his beady eyes gleaming and deep - set like those of a bird . So swift , silent , and furtive were his movements , like those of a trained bloodhound picking out a scent , that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law , instead of exerting them in its defence . As he hunted about , he kept muttering to himself , and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight . '
17324	17328	17181	17181	I	0	' said he . '

17488	17512	17481	17486	the accredited representatives of the law	509	' Heavy steps and the clamour of loud voices were audible from below , and the hall door shut with a loud crash . '

17734	17789	17827	17828	the regulars	515	' I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern . It was long , sharp , and black , with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it . The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife . '
17796	17800	17827	17828	the regulars	515	' he asked . '

17839	17922	17827	17828	the regulars	515	' As he spoke , the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage , and a very stout , portly man in a gray suit strode heavily into the room . He was red - faced , burly , and plethoric , with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches . He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform , and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto . '
17928	17939	17827	17828	the regulars	515	' he cried , in a muffled , husky voice . '
17967	17968	17969	17969	I	0	' '
17980	17985	17971	17971	you	505	' said Holmes quietly . '

18546	18554	18562	18562	Thaddeus	120	' said the fat detective , pompously . '
18626	18665	18777	18777	He	120	' With great activity , considering his bulk , he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret , and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap - door . '
18666	18672	18674	18674	Holmes	108	' He can find something , '
18680	18703	18674	18674	Holmes	108	' he has occasional glimmerings of reason . Il n'y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit ! '
18704	18708	18710	18711	Athelney Jones	112	' You see ! '
18719	18754	18710	18711	Athelney Jones	112	' facts are better than theories , after all . My view of the case is confirmed . There is a trap - door communicating with the roof , and it is partly open . '
18755	18763	18674	18674	Holmes	108	' It was I who opened it . '
18764	18776	18777	18777	He	120	' Oh , indeed ! You did notice it , then ? '
18786	18803	18777	18777	He	120	' Well , whoever noticed it , it shows how our gentleman got away . Inspector ! '
18804	18809	18674	18674	Holmes	108	' Yes , sir , '
18814	18864	18674	18674	Holmes	108	' Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way . — Mr. Sholto , it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you . I arrest you in the Queen 's name as being concerned in the death of your brother . '
18865	18876	18878	18881	the poor little man	540	' There , now ! Did n't I tell you ! '
18898	18909	18911	18911	Holmes	108	' Do n't trouble yourself about it , Mr. Sholto , '
18913	18927	18911	18911	Holmes	108	' I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge . '
18928	18944	18946	18947	the detective	543	' Do n't promise too much , Mr. Theorist , do n't promise too much ! '
18949	18961	18946	18947	the detective	543	' You may find it a harder matter than you think . '
18962	19118	18911	18911	Holmes	108	' Not only will I clear him , Mr. Jones , but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night . His name , I have every reason to believe , is Jonathan Small . He is a poorly - educated man , small , active , with his right leg off , and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side . His left boot has a coarse , square - toed sole , with an iron band round the heel . He is a middle - aged man , much sunburned , and has been a convict . These few indications may be of some assistance to you , coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand . The other man — '
19119	19126	19128	19129	Athelney Jones	112	' Ah ! the other man ? '
19156	19163	19170	19170	his	108	' Is a rather curious person , '
19173	19198	19199	19199	He	108	' I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them . A word with you , Watson . '
19210	19215	19216	19216	he	108	' This unexpected occurrence , '
19219	19235	19216	19216	he	108	' has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey . '
19236	19244	19245	19245	I	0	' I have just been thinking so , '
19248	19263	19245	19245	I	0	' it is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house . '
19264	19311	19216	19216	he	108	' No . You must escort her home . She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester , in Lower Camberwell , so it is not very far . I will wait for you here if you will drive out again . Or perhaps you are too tired ? '
19312	19388	19216	19216	he	108	' By no means . I do n't think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business . I have seen something of the rough side of life , but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to - night has shaken my nerve completely . I should like , however , to see the matter through with you , now that I have got so far . '
19389	19400	19401	19401	he	544	' Your presence will be of great service to me , '
19404	19526	19401	19401	he	544	' We shall work the case out independently , and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare's - nest which he may choose to construct . When you have dropped Miss Morstan , I wish you to go on to No . 3 , Pinchin Lane , down near the water 's edge at Lambeth . The third house on the right hand side is a bird - stuffer 's ; Sherman is the name . You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window . Knock old Sherman up , and tell him , with my compliments , that I want Toby at once . You will bring Toby back in the cab with you . '
19527	19534	19216	19216	he	108	' A dog , I suppose . '
19535	19567	19401	19401	he	544	' Yes , a queer mongrel , with a most amazing power of scent . I would rather have Toby 's help than that of the whole detective force of London . '
19568	19575	19577	19577	I.	545	' I shall bring him then , '
19578	19600	19577	19577	I.	545	' It is one now . I ought to be back before three , if I can get a fresh horse . '
19601	19605	19607	19607	Holmes	108	' And I , '
19609	19676	19607	19607	Holmes	108	' shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone , and from the Indian servant , who , Mr. Thaddeus tells me , sleeps in the next garret . Then I shall study the great Jones 's methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms . " Wir sind gewohnt dass die Menschen verhöhnen was sie nicht verstehen . " Goethe is always pithy . '

20623	20678	20619	20621	Mr. Sherlock Holmes	108	' I began ; but the words had a most magical effect , for the window instantly slammed down , and within a minute the door was unbarred and open . Mr. Sherman was a lanky , lean old man , with stooping shoulders , a stringy neck , and blue - tinted glasses . '

20874	21123	20863	20863	Toby	149	' He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him . In the uncertain , shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing , glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner . Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls , who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers . Toby proved to be an ugly , long - haired , lop - eared creature , half spaniel and half lurcher , brown and white in colour , with a very clumsy , waddling gait . It accepted , after some hesitation , a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me , and , having thus sealed an alliance , it followed me to the cab , and made no difficulties about accompanying me . It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge . The ex - prize - fighter McMurdo had , I found , been arrested as an accessory , and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station . Two constables guarded the narrow gate , but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective 's name . Holmes was standing on the doorstep , with his hands in his pockets , smoking his pipe . '

I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys , but he presently reappeared , and then vanished once more upon the opposite side . When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves . '
21679	21683	21675	21675	you	109	' he cried . '

21859	21930	21817	21817	him	603	' The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of coloured grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it .

21951	22007	21950	21950	I	0	'm delighted to have them , for the chances are that they are all he has . There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long . I would sooner face a Martini bullet , myself . Are you game for a six - mile trudge , Watson ? '

22438	22504	22378	22378	he	108	' I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval . My fears were soon appeased , however . Toby never hesitated or swerved , but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion . Clearly , the pungent smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents . '

We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half - rural villa - lined roads which lead to the metropolis . Now , however , we were beginning to come among continuous streets , where labourers and dockmen were already astir , and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door - steps . At the square - topped corner public - houses business was just beginning , and rough - looking men were emerging , rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet . Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed , but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right or to the left , but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent . We had traversed Streatham , Brixton , Camberwell , and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane , having borne away through the side streets to the east of the Oval . The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road , with the idea probably of escaping observation . They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side - street would serve their turn . At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street . Where the latter street turns into Knight 's Place , Toby ceased to advance , but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping , the very picture of canine indecision . Then he waddled round in circles , looking up to us from time to time , as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment . '
24426	24430	24431	24431	They	677	' growled Holmes . '
24446	24447	24449	24449	they	677	' '

24473	24757	24468	24468	He	680	' said my companion , in a tone of relief . He was indeed off , for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up his mind , and darted away with an energy and determination such as he had not yet shown . The scent appeared to be much hotter than before , for he had not even to put his nose on the ground , but tugged at his leash and tried to break into a run . I could see by the gleam in Holmes 's eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey . Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and Nelson 's large timber - yard , just past the White Eagle tavern . Here the dog , frantic with excitement , turned down through the side gate into the enclosure , where the sawyers were already at work . On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings , down an alley , round a passage , between two wood - piles , and finally , with a triumphant yelp , sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand - trolley on which it had been brought . With lolling tongue and blinking eyes , Toby stood upon the cask , looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation . The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid , and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creosote . Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other , and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter . '
24761	24765	24766	24766	Toby	149	' I asked . '

At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water 's edge , where there was a small wooden wharf . Toby led us to the very edge of this , and there stood whining , looking out on the dark current beyond . '
25090	25094	25084	25084	We	682	' said Holmes . '
25103	25168	25095	25095	They	687	' Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf . We took Toby round to each in turn , but , though he sniffed earnestly , he made no sign . Close to the rude landing - stage was a small brick house , with a wooden placard slung out through the second window . '

26792	27024	26777	26777	he	169	' It was between eight and nine o'clock now , and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night . I was limp and weary , befogged in mind and fatigued in body . I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on , nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem . As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went , I had heard little good of him , and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers . The treasure , however , was a different matter . That , or part of it , belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan . While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object . True , if I found it , it would probably put her for ever beyond my reach . Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that . If Holmes could work to find the criminals , I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure . A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully . When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Holmes pouring out the coffee . '

27638	27733	27633	27636	the Baker Street irregulars	783	' As he spoke , there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the stairs , a clatter of high voices , and in rushed a dozen dirty and ragged little street Arabs . There was some show of discipline among them , despite their tumultuous entry , for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces . One of their number , taller and older than the others , stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little scarecrow . '

27773	27904	27767	27767	Holmes	108	' In future they can report to you , Wiggins , and you to me . I can not have the house invaded in this way . However , it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions . I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the Aurora , owner Mordecai Smith , black with two red streaks , funnel black with a white band . She is down the river somewhere . I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith 's landing - stage opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back . You must divide it out among yourselves , and do both banks thoroughly . Let me know the moment you have news . Is that all clear ? '

In the meanwhile , we can do nothing but await results . We can not pick up the broken trail until we find either the Aurora or Mr. Mordecai Smith . '
28055	28074	27989	27989	he	108	' Toby could eat these scraps , I dare say . Are you going to bed , Holmes ? '
28075	28162	27989	27989	he	108	' No : I am not tired . I have a curious constitution . I never remember feeling tired by work , though idleness exhausts me completely . I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us . If ever man had an easy task , this of ours ought to be . Wooden - legged men are not so common , but the other man must , I should think , be absolutely unique . '
28163	28169	27986	27986	Holmes	108	' That other man again ! '
28170	28235	27989	27989	he	108	' I have no wish to make a mystery of him to you , anyway . But you must have formed your own opinion . Now , do consider the data . Diminutive footmarks , toes never fettered by boots , naked feet , stone - headed wooden mace , great agility , small poisoned darts . What do you make of all this ? '

28267	28386	28265	28265	he	788	' When first I saw signs of strange weapons , I was inclined to think so ; but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views . Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men , but none could have left such marks as that . The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet . The sandal - wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others , because the thong is commonly passed between . These little darts , too , could only be shot in one way . They are from a blow - pipe . Now , then , where are we to find our savage ? '

28411	28751	28395	28395	He	788	' This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published . It may be looked upon as the very latest authority . What have we here ? " Andaman Islands , situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra , in the Bay of Bengal . " Hum ! hum ! What 's all this ? Moist climate , coral reefs , sharks , Port Blair , convict barracks , Rutland Island , cottonwoods — Ah , here we are ! " The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth , though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa , the Digger Indians of America , and the Terra del Fuegians . The average height is rather below four feet , although many full - grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this . They are a fierce , morose , and intractable people , though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained . " Mark that , Watson . Now , then , listen to this . " They are naturally hideous , having large , misshapen heads , small fierce eyes , and distorted features . Their feet and hands , however , are remarkably small . So intractable and fierce are they , that all the efforts of the British officials have failed to win them over in any degree . They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews , braining the survivors with their stone - headed clubs , or shooting them with their poisoned arrows . These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast . " Nice , amiable people , Watson ! If this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices , this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn . I fancy that , even as it is , Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to have employed him . '
28752	28764	28893	28893	his	789	' But how came he to have so singular a companion ? '
28765	28844	28845	28845	He	789	' Ah , that is more than I can tell . Since , however , we had already determined that Small had come from the Andamans , it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him . No doubt we shall know all about it in time . Look here , Watson ; you look regularly done . Lie down there on the sofa , and see if I can put you to sleep . '
29004	29010	29011	29011	he	108	' You have slept soundly , '
29014	29024	29011	29011	he	108	' I feared that our talk would wake you . '
29025	29030	29031	29031	I	0	' I heard nothing , '
29034	29043	29011	29011	he	108	' Have you had fresh news , then ? '
29044	29099	29011	29011	he	108	' Unfortunately , no . I confess that I am surprised and disappointed . I expected something definite by this time . Wiggins has just been up to report . He says that no trace can be found of the launch . It is a provoking check , for every hour is of importance . '
29100	29121	29011	29011	he	108	' Can I do anything ? I am perfectly fresh now , and quite ready for another night 's outing . '
29122	29167	29011	29011	he	108	' No ; we can do nothing . We can only wait . If we go ourselves , the message might come in our absence , and delay be caused . You can do what you will , but I must remain on guard . '
29168	29190	29011	29011	he	108	' Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester . She asked me to , yesterday . '
29191	29197	29199	29199	Holmes	108	' On Mrs. Cecil Forrester ? '
29211	29229	29208	29208	his	108	' Well , of course on Miss Morstan too . They were anxious to hear what happened . '
29230	29239	29241	29241	Holmes	108	' I would not tell them too much , '
29243	29258	29241	29241	Holmes	108	' Women are never to be entirely trusted — not the best of them . '
29270	29281	29282	29282	I	0	' I shall be back in an hour or two , '
29285	29330	29282	29282	I	0	' All right ! Good luck ! But , I say , if you are crossing the river you may as well return Toby , for I do n't think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now . '
29450	29456	29458	29459	Mrs. Forrester	118	' It is a romance ! '
29461	29495	29458	29459	Mrs. Forrester	118	' An injured lady , half a million in treasure , a black cannibal , and a wooden - legged ruffian . They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl . '
29496	29506	29508	29509	Miss Morstan	116	' And two knight - errants to the rescue , '
29518	29564	29508	29509	Miss Morstan	116	' Why , Mary , your fortune depends upon the issue of this search . I do n't think that you are nearly excited enough . Just imagine what it must be to be so rich , and to have the world at your feet ! '
29614	29626	29627	29627	she	118	' It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious , '
29630	29665	29627	29627	she	118	' Nothing else is of any consequence ; but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honourably throughout . It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge . '
29716	29727	29728	29728	I	0	' I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out , '
29742	29762	29734	29734	she	117	' No , sir . He has gone to his room , sir . Do you know , sir , '
29771	29779	29764	29764	her	117	' I am afraid for his health ? '
29780	29787	29734	29734	she	117	' Why so , Mrs. Hudson ? '
29788	29934	29734	29734	she	117	' Well , he 's that strange , sir . After you was gone he walked and he walked , up and down , and up and down , until I was weary of the sound of his footstep . Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering , and every time the bell rang out he came on the stair - head , with " What is that , Mrs. Hudson ? " And now he has slammed off to his room , but I can hear him walking away the same as ever . I hope he 's not going to be ill , sir . I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine , but he turned on me , sir , with such a look that I do n't know how ever I got out of the room . '
29935	29952	29953	29953	I	0	' I do n't think that you have any cause to be uneasy , Mrs. Hudson , '
29956	29978	29953	29953	I	0	' I have seen him like this before . He has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless . '
30048	30058	30059	30059	I	0	' You are knocking yourself up , old man , '
30062	30072	30059	30059	I	0	' I heard you marching about in the night . '
30073	30081	30082	30082	he	800	' No , I could not sleep , '
30085	30192	30082	30082	he	800	' This infernal problem is consuming me . It is too much to be baulked by so petty an obstacle , when all else had been overcome . I know the men , the launch , everything ; and yet I can get no news . I have set other agencies at work , and used every means at my disposal . The whole river has been searched on either side , but there is no news , nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft . But there are objections to that . '
30193	30206	30059	30059	I	0	' Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent . '
30207	30231	30059	30059	I	0	' No , I think that may be dismissed . I had inquiries made , and there is a launch of that description . '
30232	30241	30082	30082	he	800	' Could it have gone up the river ? '
30242	30303	30059	30059	I	0	' I have considered that possibility too , and there is a search - party who will work up as far as Richmond . If no news comes to - day , I shall start off myself to - morrow , and go for the men rather than the boat . But surely , surely , we shall hear something . '
30527	30537	30539	30539	he	108	' I am off down the river , Watson , '
30541	30572	30539	30539	he	108	' I have been turning it over in my mind , and I can see only one way out of it . It is worth trying , at all events . '
30573	30583	30585	30585	I.	0	' Surely I can come with you , then ? '
30586	30664	30585	30585	I.	0	' No ; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative . I am loath to go , for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day , though Wiggins was despondent about it last night . I want you to open all notes and telegrams , and to act on your own judgment if any news should come . Can I rely upon you ? '
30665	30669	30539	30539	he	108	' Most certainly . '
30670	30728	30734	30734	him	806	' I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me , for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself . If I am in luck , however , I may not be gone so very long . I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back . '
30758	30767	30539	30539	he	108	' With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy , '
30771	30883	30539	30539	he	108	' we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed . Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter . He and the housekeeper , Mrs. Bernstone , were both released yesterday evening . It is believed , however , that the police have a clue as to the real culprits , and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones , of Scotland Yard , with all his well - known energy and sagacity . Further arrests may be expected at any moment . '
30884	30894	30896	30896	I.	0	' That is satisfactory so far as it goes , '
30897	30932	30896	30896	I.	0	' Friend Sholto is safe , at any rate . I wonder what the fresh clue may be , though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder . '
30962	31051	31055	31055	Holmes	108	' Lost .—Whereas Mordecai Smith , boatman , and his son Jim , left Smith 's Wharf at or about three o'clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch Aurora , black with two red stripes , funnel black with a white band , the sum of five pounds will be paid to anyone who can give information to Mrs. Smith , at Smith 's Wharf , or at 221 b , Baker Street , as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch Aurora . '
31439	31450	31452	31452	he	202	' Good - day , sir ; good - day , '
31454	31464	31452	31452	he	202	' Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out , I understand . '
31465	31498	31426	31426	His	202	' Yes , and I can not be sure when he will be back . But perhaps you would care to wait . Take that chair and try one of these cigars . '
31499	31511	31513	31513	he	202	' Thank you ; I do n't mind if I do , '
31524	31531	31513	31513	he	202	' And a whisky and soda ? '
31532	31571	31426	31426	His	202	' Well , half a glass . It is very hot for the time of year ; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me . You know my theory about this Norwood case ? '
31572	31580	31426	31426	His	202	' I remember that you expressed one . '
31581	31692	31513	31513	he	202	' Well , I have been obliged to reconsider it . I had my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto , sir , when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it . He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken . From the time that he left his brother 's room he was never out of sight of someone or other . So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap - doors . It 's a very dark case , and my professional credit is at stake . I should be very glad of a little assistance . '
31693	31700	31702	31702	I.	820	' We all need help sometimes , '
31703	31716	31718	31718	he	821	' Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man , sir , '
31727	31841	31718	31718	he	821	' He 's a man who is not to be beat . I have known that young man go into a good many cases , but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon . He is irregular in his methods , and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories , but , on the whole , I think he would have made a most promising officer , and I do n't care who knows it . I have had a wire from him this morning , by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business . Here is his message . '
31866	31874	31842	31842	He	821	' Go to Baker Street at once , '
31878	31918	31842	31842	He	821	' If I have not returned , wait for me . I am close on the track of the Sholto gang . You can come with us to - night if you want to be in at the finish . '
31919	31933	31935	31935	I.	0	' This sounds well . He has evidently picked up the scent again , '
31936	31947	31949	31949	Jones	112	' Ah , then he has been at fault too , '
31955	32008	31949	31949	Jones	112	' Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes . Of course this may prove to be a false alarm ; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip . But there is someone at the door . Perhaps this is he . '
32196	32204	32205	32205	I	0	' What is it , my man ? '
32221	32228	32230	32230	he	822	' Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here ? '
32232	32253	32230	32230	he	822	' No ; but I am acting for him . You can tell me any message you have for him . '
32254	32266	32268	32268	he	822	' It was to him himself I was to tell it , '
32270	32290	32268	32268	he	822	' But I tell you that I am acting for him . Was it about Mordecai Smith 's boat ? '

32450	32458	32460	32460	he	112	' Wait a bit , my friend , '
32462	32491	32460	32460	he	112	' You have important information , and you must not walk off . We shall keep you , whether you like or not , until our friend returns . '

I have never known him so brilliant . He spoke on a quick succession of subjects — on miracle plays , on mediæval pottery , on Stradivarius violins , on the Buddhism of Ceylon , and on the warships of the future — handling each as though he had made a special study of it . His bright humour marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days . Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation , and faced his dinner with the air of a bon vivant . For myself , I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task , and I caught something of Holmes 's gaiety . None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together . When the cloth was cleared , Holmes glanced at his watch , and filled up three glasses with port . '

33743	33795	33677	33677	I	0	' The small change was made , we stepped on board , and the ropes were cast off . Jones , Holmes , and I sat in the stern . There was one man at the rudder , one to tend the engines , and two burly police - inspectors forward . '
33802	33817	33800	33800	Jones	112	' To the Tower . Tell them to stop opposite to Jacobson 's Yard . '
33858	33871	33872	33872	he	108	' We ought to be able to catch anything on the river , '
33875	33891	33872	33872	he	108	' Well , hardly that . But there are not many launches to beat us . '
33892	33937	33872	33872	he	108	' We shall have to catch the Aurora , and she has a name for being a clipper . I will tell you how the land lies , Watson . You recollect how annoyed I was at being baulked by so small a thing ? '
33938	33941	33872	33872	he	108	' Yes . '
33942	34174	33872	33872	he	108	' Well , I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis . One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest . So it is . When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at , I came back to our problem of the Sholtos , and thought the whole matter out again . My boys had been up the river and down the river without result . The launch was not at any landingstage or wharf , nor had it returned . Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces , though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed . I knew that this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning , but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse . That is usually a product of higher education . I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time — as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge — he could hardly leave at a moment 's notice , but would need some little time , if it were only a day , to arrange his affairs . That was the balance of probability , at any rate . '
34175	34186	34188	34188	I	0	' It seems to me to be a little weak , '
34190	34210	34188	34188	I	0	' it is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition . '
34211	34462	33872	33872	he	108	' No , I hardly think so . This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it . But a second consideration struck me . Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion , however much he may have top coated him , would give rise to gossip , and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy . He was quite sharp enough to see that . They had started from their headquarters under cover of darkness , and he would wish to get back before it was broad light . Now , it was past three o'clock , according to Mrs. Smith , when they got the boat . It would be quite bright , and people would be about in an hour or so . Therefore , I argued , they did not go very far . They paid Smith well to hold his tongue , reserved his launch for the final escape , and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure - box . In a couple of nights , when they had time to see what view the papers took , and whether there was any suspicion , they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs , where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies . '
34463	34478	33872	33872	he	108	' But the launch ? They could not have taken that to their lodgings . '
34479	34652	34188	34188	I	0	' Quite so . I argued that the launch must be no great way off , in spite of its invisibility . I then put myself in the place of Small , and looked at it as a man of his capacity would . He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track . How , then , could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted ? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes . I could only think of one way of doing it . I might hand the launch over to some boat - builder or repairer , with directions to make a trifling change in her . She would then be removed to his shed or yard , and so be effectually concealed , while at the same time I could have her at a few hours '

35614	35618	35611	35612	the Aurora	728	' exclaimed Holmes , '
35658	35721	35722	35722	She	728	' She had slipped unseen through the yard - entrance and passed behind two or three small craft , so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her . Now she was flying down the stream , near in to the shore , going at a tremendous rate . Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head . '
35727	35731	35722	35722	She	728	' he said . '
35740	35741	35732	35732	I	0	' '
35747	35755	35732	35732	I	0	' cried Holmes , between his teeth . '
35779	35944	35949	35949	men	1412	' We were fairly after her now . The furnaces roared , and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked , like a great metallic heart . Her sharp , steep prow cut through the still river - water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us . With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing . One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long , flickering funnel of light in front of us . Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay , and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going . We flashed past barges , steamers , merchant - vessels , in and out , behind this one and round the other . Voices hailed us out of the darkness , but still the Aurora thundered on , and still we followed close upon her track . '
35955	35981	35949	35949	men	1412	' cried Holmes , looking down into the engine - room , while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager , aquiline face . '

35999	36010	35992	35992	I	0	' said Jones , with his eyes on the Aurora . '
36017	36020	35992	35992	I	0	' said I. '
36033	36725	36021	36021	We	926	' At that moment , however , as our evil fate would have it , a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us . It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision , and before we could round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards . She was still , however , well in view , and the murky , uncertain twilight was settling into a clear , starlit night . Our boilers were strained to their utmost , and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along . We had shot through the pool , past the West India Docks , down the long Deptford Reach , and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs . The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora . Jones turned our search light upon her , so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck . One man sat by the stern , with something black between his knees , over which he stooped . Beside him lay a dark mass , which looked like a Newfoundland dog . The boy held the tiller , while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith , stripped to the waist , and shovelling coals for dear life . They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them , but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it . At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them . At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty . I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my chequered career , but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad , flying manhunt down the Thames . Steadily we drew in upon them , yard by yard . In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery . The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck , and his arms were moving as though he were busy , while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us . Nearer we came and nearer . Jones yelled to them to stop . We were not more than four boat's - lengths behind them , both boats flying at a tremendous pace . It was a clear reach of the river , with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other . At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clenched fists at us , cursing the while in a high , cracked voice . He was a good - sized , powerful man , and as he stood poising himself with legs astride , I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side . At the sound of his strident , angry cries , there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck . It straightened itself into a little black man — the smallest I have even seen — with a great , misshapen head and a shock of tangled , dishevelled hair . Holmes had already drawn his revolver , and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage , distorted creature . He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket , which left only his face exposed ; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night . Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty . His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light , and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth , which grinned and chattered at us with half animal fury . '
36733	37285	36728	36728	he	928	' said Holmes quietly . We were within a boat's - length by this time , and almost within touch of our quarry . I can see the two of them now as they stood , the white man with his legs far apart , shrieking out curses , and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face , and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern . It was well that we had so clear a view of him . Even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short , round piece of wood , like a school - ruler , and clapped it to his lips . Our pistols rang out together . He whirled round , threw up his arms , and , with a kind of choking cough , fell sideways into the stream . I caught one glimpse of his venomous , menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters . At the same moment the wooden - legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down , so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank , while we shot past her stern , only clearing her by a few feet . We were round after her in an instant , but she was already nearly at the bank . It was a wild and desolate place , where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh - land , with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation . The launch , with a dull thud , ran up upon the mud - bank , with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water . The fugitive sprang out , but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil . In vain he struggled and writhed . Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards . He yelled in impotent rage , and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot ; but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank . When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out , and to drag him , like some evil fish , over our side . The two Smiths , father and son , sat sullenly in their launch , but came aboard meekly enough when commanded . The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern . A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck . This , there could be no question , was the same that had contained the ill - omened treasure of the Sholtos . There was no key , but it was of considerable weight , so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin . As we steamed slowly up - stream again , we flashed our search - light in every direction , but there was no sign of the Islander . Somewhere in the dark ooze at bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores . '
37289	37299	36728	36728	he	928	' said Holmes , pointing to the wooden hatchway . '
37309	37596	37300	37300	We	929	' There , sure enough , just behind where we had been standing , stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well . It must have whizzed between us at the instant we fired . Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion , but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night . Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain . He was a sunburned , reckless - eyed fellow , with a network of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features , which told of a hard , open - air life . There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose . His age may have been fifty or thereabouts , for his black , curly hair was thickly shot with gray . His face in repose was not an unpleasing one , though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him , as I had lately seen , a terrible expression when moved to anger . He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap , and his head sunk upon his breast , while he looked with his keen , twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his illdoings . It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance . Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humour in his eyes . '
37602	37610	37599	37600	Jonathan Small	124	' said Holmes , lighting a cigar , '

38363	38378	38361	38361	Holmes	108	' But I certainly did not know that the Aurora was such a clipper . '

A quarter of an hour 's drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester 's . The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor . Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening , she explained , and likely to be very late . Miss Morstan , however , was in the drawing - room ; so to the drawing - room I went , box in hand , leaving the obliging inspector in the cab . She was seated by the open window , dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material , with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist . The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair , playing over her sweet grave face , and tinting with a dull , metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair . One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair , and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy . At the sound of my footfall she sprang to her feet , however , and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks . '

Holmes 's new method of search , the discovery of the Aurora , the appearance of Athelney Jones , our expedition in the evening , and the wild chase down the Thames . She listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures . When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us , she turned so white that I feared that she was about to faint . '

39536	39579	39501	39501	I	0	' she said . There was no eagerness in her voice , however . It had struck her , doubtless , that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win . '
39585	39593	39501	39501	I	0	' she said , stooping over it . '

39665	39795	39660	39661	Mrs. Forrester	118	' There was in the front a thick and broad hasp , wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha . Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever . The hasp sprang open with a loud snap . With trembling fingers I flung back the lid . We both stood gazing in astonishment . The box was empty ! No wonder that it was heavy . The ironwork was two - thirds of an inch thick all round . It was massive , well made , and solid , like a chest constructed to carry things of great price , but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewellery lay within it . It was absolutely and completely empty . '
39801	39877	39660	39661	Mrs. Forrester	118	' said Miss Morstan calmly . As I listened to the words and realized what they meant , a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul . I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down , until now that it was finally removed . It was selfish , no doubt , disloyal , wrong , but I could realize nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us . '
39881	39900	39660	39661	Mrs. Forrester	118	' I ejaculated from my very heart . She looked at me with a quick , questioning smile . '

40164	40271	40158	40160	Mr. Athelney Jones	112	' His forecast proved to be correct , for the detective looked blank enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box . They had only just arrived , Holmes , the prisoner , and he , for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way . My companion lounged in his arm - chair with his usual listless expression , while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one . As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud . '

40909	40989	40990	40990	You	1004	' Small had dropped his mask of stoicism , and all this came out in a wild whirl of words , while his eyes blazed and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his hands . I could understand , as I saw the fury and the passion of the man , that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track . '
41000	41005	40990	40990	You	1004	' said Holmes quietly . '

41139	41299	41300	41300	I	0	' I am a Worcestershire man myself , born near Pershore . I dare say you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look . I have often thought of taking a look round there , but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family , and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me . They were all steady , chapel - going folk , small farmers , well known and respected over the country - side , while I was always a bit of a rover . At last , however , when I was about eighteen , I gave them no more trouble , for I got into a mess over a girl , and could only get out of it again by taking the Queen 's shilling and joining the 3rd Buffs , which was just starting for India . '
41484	41736	41471	41471	myself	0	' I was , as you can imagine , pretty down on my luck at this time , for I was a useless cripple , though not yet in my twentieth year . However , my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise . A man named Abel White , who had come out there as an indigo - planter , wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work . He happened to be a friend of our colonel 's , who had taken an interest in me since the accident . To make a long story short , the colonel recommended me strongly for the post , and , as the work was mostly to be done on horseback , my leg was no great obstacle , for I had enough knee left to keep a good grip on the saddle . What I had to do was to ride over the plantation , to keep an eye on the men as they worked , and to report the idlers . The pay was fair , I had comfortable quarters , and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo - planting . Mr. Abel White was a kind man , and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me , for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home . '
42248	42440	42210	42210	them	1041	' As it proved , however , there was no great safety there , either . The whole country was up like a swarm of bees . Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded . Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives . It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds ; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against , foot , horse , and gunners , were our own picked troops , whom we had taught and trained , handling our own weapons and blowing our own bugle - calls . At Agra there were the 3rd Bengal Fusiliers , some Sikhs , two troops of horse , and a battery of artillery . A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed , and this I joined , wooden leg and all . We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July , and we beat them back for a time , but our powder gave out , and we had to fall back upon the city . '
42518	42757	42468	42468	you	1048	' The city of Agra is a great place , swarming with fanatics and fierce devil - worshippers of all sorts . Our handful of men were lost among the narrow , winding streets . Our leader moved across the river , therefore , and took up his position in the old fort of Agra . I do n't know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort . It is a very queer place the queerest that ever I was in , and I have been in some rum corners , too . First of all it is enormous in size . I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres . There is a modern part , which took all our garrison , women , children , stores , and everything else , with plenty of room over . But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter , where nobody goes , and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes . It is all full of great deserted halls , and winding passages , and long corridors twisting in and out , so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it . For this reason it was seldom that anyone went into it , though now and again a party with torches might go exploring . '
43008	43208	43213	43213	my	0	' Well , I was pretty proud at having this small command given me , since I was a raw recruit , and a game - legged one at that . For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees . They were tall , fierce - looking chaps , Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name , both old fighting men , who had borne arms against us at Chilian Wallah . They could talk English pretty well , but I could get little out of them . They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo . For myself , I used to stand outside the gateway , looking down on the broad , winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city . The beating of drums , the rattle of tomtoms , and the yells and howls of the rebels , drunk with opium and with bang , were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbours across the stream . Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts , to make sure that all was well . '
43356	43581	43344	43344	he	954	' My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels , and that this was the beginning of an assault . If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall , and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore . Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself , but I give you my word that when I thought of that , though I felt the point of the knife at my throat , I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream , if it was my last one , which might alarm the main guard . The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts ; for , even as I braced myself to it , he whispered : " Do n't make a noise . The fort is safe enough . There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river . " There was the ring of truth in what he said , and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man . I could read it in the fellow 's brown eyes . I waited , therefore , in silence , to see what it was that they wanted from me . '
43723	43780	43791	43791	he	1083	' " How can I decide ? " said I. " You have not told me what you want of me . But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of the fort I will have no truck with it , so you can drive home your knife and welcome . " '
43878	43918	43928	43928	he	1087	' " But what is the treasure , then ? " I asked . " I am as ready to be rich as you can be , if you will but show me how it can be done . " '
43969	43990	43993	43994	my comrade	1090	' " I will swear it , " I answered , " provided that the fort is not endangered . " '
44020	44030	44054	44054	you	139	' " There are but three , " said I. '
44161	44455	44156	44156	I	0	' " There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth , though his lands are small . Much has come to him from his father , and more still he has set by himself , for he is of a low nature , and hoards his gold rather than spend it . When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger — with the Sepoy and with the Company 's Raj . Soon , however , it seemed to him that the white men 's day was come , for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow . Yet , being a careful man , he made such plans that , come what might , half at least of his treasure should be left to him . That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace , but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box , and sent it by a trusty servant , who , under the guise of a merchant , should take it to the fort at Agra , there to lie until the land is at peace . Thus , if the rebels won he would have his money , but if the Company conquered his jewels would be saved to him . Having thus divided his hoard , he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys , since they were strong upon his borders . By his doing this , mark you , Sahib , his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt . '
44598	44737	44745	44745	he	1112	' In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing ; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you , and you have been used to meeting death at every turn . Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me , but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it , and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it , and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne'er - do weel coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores . I had , therefore , already made up my mind . Abdullah Khan , however , thinking that I hesitated , pressed the matter more closely . '
44886	44899	44906	44906	he	1113	' " I am with you heart and soul , " said I. '
44950	44969	44974	44974	his	1113	' " Does you brother know , then , of what you will do ? " I asked . '
44996	45088	44974	44974	his	1113	' The rain was still falling steadily , for it was just the beginning of the wet season . Brown , heavy clouds were drifting across the sky , and it was hard to see more than a stonecast . A deep moat lay in front of our door , but the water was in places nearly dried up , and it could easily be crossed . It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death . '
45125	45135	45149	45149	Abdullah	126	' " Here they are ! " I exclaimed . '
45198	45255	45263	45263	I	0	' The light had flickered onwards , now stopping and now advancing , until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat . I let them scramble down the sloping bank , splash through the mire , and climb half - way up to the gate , before I challenged them . '
45270	45453	45263	45263	I	0	' " Friends , " came the answer . I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them . The first was an enormous Sikh , with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund . Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man . The other was a little fat , round fellow , with a great yellow turban , and a bundle in his hand , done up in a shawl . He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear , for his hands twitched as if he had the ague , and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes , like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole . It gave me the chills to think of killing him , but I thought of the treasure , and my heart set as hard as a flint within me . When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy , and came running up towards me . '
45529	45542	45549	45549	he	1132	' " What have you in the bundle ? " I asked . '
45610	45656	45667	45667	I.	1142	' I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man . The more I looked at his fat , frightened face , the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood . It was best to get it over . '
45713	46005	46006	46006	He	1146	' I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors . Suddenly it ceased , and I heard voices , and a scuffle , with the sound of blows . A moment later there came , to my horror , a rush of footsteps coming in my direction , with a loud breathing of a running man . I turned my lantern down the long straight passage , and there was the fat man , running like the wind , with a smear of blood across his face , and close at his heels , bounding like a tiger , the great black - bearded Sikh , with a knife flashing in his hand . I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant . He was gaining on the Sikh , and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet . My heart softened to him , but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter . I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past , and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit . Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him , and buried his knife twice in his side . The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle , but lay where he had fallen . I think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall . You see , gentlemen , that I am keeping my promise . I am telling you every word of the business just exactly as it happened , whether it is in my favour or not . '
46146	46156	46158	46158	he	108	' It was all very bad , no doubt , '
46160	46251	46158	46158	he	108	' I should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains . Besides , it was my life or his when once he was in the fort . If he had got out , the whole business would come to light , and I should have been court - martialled and shot as likely as not ; for people were not very lenient at a time like that . '
46252	46259	46261	46261	Holmes	108	' Go on with your story , '
46264	46387	46261	46261	Holmes	108	' Well , we carried him in , Abdullah , Akbar , and I. A fine weight he was , too , for all that he was so short . Mahomet Singh was left to guard the door . We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared . It was some distance off , where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall , the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces . The earth floor had sunk in at one place , making a natural grave , so we left Achmet the merchant there , having first covered him over with loose bricks . This done , we all went back to the treasure . '
46659	46889	46655	46655	I	0	' After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gateway to show them to Mahomet Singh . Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret . We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again , and then to divide it equally among ourselves . There was no use dividing it at present , for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion , and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them . We carried the box , therefore , into the same hall where we had buried the body , and there , under certain bricks in the best - preserved wall , we made a hollow and put our treasure . We made careful note of the place , and next day I drew four plans , one for each of us , and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom , for we had sworn that we should each always act for all , so that none might take advantage . That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken . '
47013	47330	47008	47011	the murderers of Achmet	1159	' It came about in this way . When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man . They are suspicious folk in the East , however : so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first ? This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight , and he followed him like his shadow . He went after him that night , and saw him pass through the doorway . Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort , and applied for admission there himself next day , but could find no trace of Achmet . This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides , who brought it to the ears of the commandant . A thorough search was quickly made , and the body was discovered . Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder — three of us because we had held the gate that night , and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man . Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial , for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India : so no one had any particular interest in them . The murder , however , was clearly made out , and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it . The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life , and I was condemned to death , though my sentence was aftewards commuted into the same as the others . '
47472	47712	47713	47714	The surgeon	2113	' At last it seemed to me to have come . I was changed from Agra to Madras , and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans . There are very few white convicts at this settlement , and , as I had behaved well from the first , I soon found myself a sort of privileged person . I was given a hut in Hope Town , which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet , and I was left pretty much to myself . It is a dreary , fever - stricken place , and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives , who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance . There was digging and ditching and yam - planting , and a dozen other things to be done , so we were busy enough all day ; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves . Among other things , I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon , and picked up a smattering of his knowledge . All the time I was on the look - out for a chance of escape ; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land , and there is little or no wind in those seas : so it was a terribly difficult job to get away . '
47887	48084	48087	48087	he	1177	' Well , there was one thing which very soon struck me , and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win . Mind , Idon't say there was anything unfair , but so it was . These prison - chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans , and they knew each other 's game to a point , while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow . Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men , and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play . Major Sholto was the hardest hit . He used to pay in notes and gold at first , but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums . He sometimes would win for a few deals , just to give him heart , and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever . All day he would wander about as black as thunder , and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him . '

48258	48279	48257	48257	I.	0	' " Well , Small , what is it ? " he asked , taking his cheroot from his lips . '
48361	48385	48351	48351	they	1188	' " Half a million , Small ? " he gasped , looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest . '
48433	48470	48472	48472	You	1321	' " To Government , Small , " he stammered , " to Government . " But he said it in a halting fashion , and I knew in my heart that I had got him . '
48496	48530	48493	48493	I	0	' " Well , well , you must not do anything rash , or that you might repent . Let me hear all about it , Small . Give me the facts . " '
48583	48621	48625	48625	he	1321	' " This is a very important matter , Small , " he said at last . " You must not say a word to anyone about it , and I shall see you again soon . " '
48647	48671	48672	48672	I	0	' " I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips , Small , " said he . '
48682	48704	48676	48676	I	0	' " It rings true , eh ? " said he . " It 's good enough to act upon ? " '
48709	48839	48705	48706	Captain Morstan	119	' " Look here , Small , " said the Major . " We have been talking it over , my friend here and I , and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a Government matter , after all , but is a private concern of your own , which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best . Now the question is , What price would you ask for it ? We might be inclined to take it up , and at least look into it , if we could agree as to terms . " He tried to speak in a cool , careless way , but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed . '
48922	48942	48954	48954	I.	0	' " Hum ! " said he . " A fifth share ! That is not very tempting . " '
48955	48976	48954	48954	I.	0	' " But how can we gain your freedom ? You know very well that you ask an impossibility . " '

49126	49164	49173	49174	the other	954	' " You see , Morstan , " said he , " Small is a man of his word . He does not flinch from his friends . I think we may very well trust him . " '
49193	49263	49173	49174	the other	954	' " Well , Small , " said the Major , " we must , I suppose , try and meet you . We must first , of course , test the truth of your story . Tell me where the box is hid , and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief - boat to inquire into the affair . " '
49304	49326	49291	49291	I	0	' " Nonsense ! " he broke in . " What have three black fellows to do with our agreement ? " '
49350	49586	49334	49334	I	0	' Well , the matter ended by a second meeting , at which Mahomet Singh , Abdullah Khan , and Dost Akbar were all present . We talked the matter over again , and at last we came to an arrangement . We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort , and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid . Major Sholto was to go to India to test our story . If he found the box he was to leave it there , to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage , which was to lie off Rutland Island , and to which we were to make our way , and finally to return to his duties . Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence , to meet us at Agra , and there we were to have a final division of the treasure , he taking the Major 's share as well as his own . All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter . I sat up all night with paper and ink , and by the morning I had the two charts all ready , signed with the sign of four — that is , of Abdullah , Akbar , Mahomet , and myself . '
49826	49995	49996	49996	Tonga	176	' Well , I have set my mind on many things in this life , and never one which I did not carry out . But it was weary years before my time came . I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine . One day when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict - gang in the woods . He was sick to death , and had gone to a lonely place to die . I took him in hand , though he was as venomous as a young snake , and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk . He took a kind of fancy to me then , and would hardly go back to his woods , but was always hanging about my hut . I learned a little of his lingo from him , and this made him all the fonder of me . '
50104	50240	50080	50080	I	0	' He was stanch and true , was little Tonga . No man ever had a more faithful mate . At the night named he had his boat at the wharf . As it chanced , however , there was one of the convict guard down there — a vile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me . I had always vowed vengeance , and now I had my chance . It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island . He stood on the bank with his back to me , and his carbine on his shoulder . I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with , but none could I see . '
50482	50699	50473	50473	they	1230	' Well , if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and I went through , you would not thank me , for I would have you here until the sun was shining . Here and there we drifted about the world , something always turning up to keep us from London . All the time , however , I never lost sight of my purpose . I would dream of Sholto at night . A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep . At last , however , some three or four years ago , we found ourselves in England . I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived , and I set to work to discover whether he had realized the treasure , or if he still had it . I made friends with someone who could help me — I name no names , for I do n't want to get anyone else in a hole — and I soon found that he still had the jewels . Then I tried to get at him in many ways ; but he was pretty sly , and had always two prize - fighters , besides his sons and his khitmutgar , on guard over him . '
50929	51295	51296	51296	I	0	' We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal . He would eat raw meat and dance his war - dance : so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day 's work . I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge , and for some years there was no news to hear , except that they were hunting for the treasure . At last , however , came what we had waited for so long . The treasure had been found . It was up at the top of the house , in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto 's chemical laboratory . I came at once and had a look at the place , but I could not see how , with my wooden leg , I was to make my way up to it . I learned , however , about a trap - door in the roof , and also about Mr. Sholto 's supper - hour . It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga . I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist . He could climb like a cat , and he soon made his way through the roof , but , as ill luck would have it , Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room , to his cost . Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him , for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock . Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope 's end and cursed him for a little bloodthirsty imp . I took the treasure box and let it down , and then slid down myself , having first left the sign of the four upon the table , to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them . Tonga then pulled up the rope , closed the window , and made off the way that he had come . '
