1063	1266	2780	2780	he	486	' I call them , " said the younger of the two spectators . " The gulls fascinate me always . They are beautiful to see and hear and paint . Swimming there , and wheeling between the seas in rough weather , or hanging almost motionless in midair with their heads turning first this way , then that , and their breasts pressed against the wind — why , they are perfect always , the little winged gods of the sea . " " Gods kissing carrion , " sneered the other . " Beautiful enough , no doubt , but their music holds no charm for me . Nothing is quite beautiful which has for its cause something ugly . Those echoing cries down there are the expression of a greedy struggle , no more . I hate your Newlyn gulls . They are ruined , like a thousand other wild things , by civilization . I see them scouring the fields and hopping after the plowman like upland crows . A Cornish seabird should fight its battle with the sea and find its home in the heart of the dizzy cliffs , sharing them with the samphire . But your '
1271	2741	2780	2780	he	486	' behave like gutter - fed ducks . " The first speaker laughed and both strolled upon their way . They were artists , but while Edmund Murdoch dwelt at Newlyn and lived by his profession , the older man , John Barron , was merely on a visit to the place . He had come down for change and with no particular intention to work . Barron was wealthy and wasted rare talents . He did not paint much , and the few who knew his pictures deplored the fact that no temporal inducement called upon him to handle his brush oftener . A few excused him on the plea of his health , which was at all times indifferent , but he never excused himself . It needed something far from the beaten track to inspire him , and inspiration was rare . But let a subject once grip him and the artist 's life centered and fastened upon it until his work was done . He sacrificed everything at such a time ; he slaved ; labor was to him as a debauch to the drunkard , and he wearied body and mind and counted his health nothing while the frenzy held him . Then , his picture finished , at the cost of the man 's whole store of nervous energy and skill , he would probably paint no more for many months . His subject was always some transcript from nature , wrought out with almost brutal vigor and disregard of everything but truth . His looks belied his work curiously . A small , slight man he was , with sloping shoulders and the consumptive build . But the breadth of his head above the ears showed brain , and his gray eyes spoke a strength of purpose upon which a hard , finely - modeled mouth set the seal . Once he had painted in the West Indies : a picture of two negresses bathing at Tobago . Behind them hung low tangles of cactus , melo - cactus and white - blossomed orchid ; while on the tawny rocks glimmered snowy cotton splashed with a crimson turban ; but the marvel of the work lay in the figures and the refraction of their brown limbs seen through crystal - clear water . The picture brought reputation to a man who cared nothing for it ; and Barron 's " Bathing Negresses " are only quoted here because they illustrate his method of work . He had painted from the sea in a boat moored fore and aft ; he had kept the two women shivering and whining in the water for two hours at a time . They could not indeed refuse the gold he offered for their services , but one never lived to enjoy the money , for her prolonged ablutions in the cause of art killed her a week after her work was done . John Barren was a lonely sybarite with a real love for Nature and absolutely primitive instincts with regard to his fellow - creatures . The Land 's End had disappointed him ; he had found Nature neither grand nor terrific there , but sleepy and tame as a cat after a full meal . Nor did he derive any pleasure from the society of his craft at Newlyn . He hated the clatter of art jargon , he flouted all schools , and pointed out what nobody doubts now : that the artists of the Cornish village in reality represented nothing but a community of fellow - workers , all actuated indeed by love of art , but each developing his own bent without thought for his neighbor 's theory . Barron indeed made some enemies before he had been in the place a week , and the greater lights liked him none the better for vehemently disclaiming the honor when they told him he was one of themselves . " The shape of a brush does not make men paint alike , " he said , " else we were all equal and should only differ in color . Some of you can no more paint with a square brush than you can with a knife . Some of you could not paint though your palettes were set with Nature 's own sunset colors . And others of you , if you had a rabbit 's scut at the end of a hop - pole and the gray mud from a rain puddle , would produce work worth considering . You are a community of painters — some clever , some hopeless — but you are not a school , and you may thank God for it . " John Barron was rough tonic , but the fearless little man generally found an audience at the end of the day in this studio or that . The truth of much that he said appealed to the lofty - minded and serious ; his dry cynicism , savage dislike of civilization , and frank affection for Nature , attracted others . He hit hard , but he never resented rough knocks in return , and no man had seen him out of temper with anything but mysticism and the art bred therefrom . Upon the whole , however , his materialism annoyed more than his wit amused . Upon the evening which followed his insult to the Newlyn gulls , Barron , with Edmund Murdoch and some other men , was talking in the studio of one Brady , known to fame as the " Wrecker , " from his love for the artistic representation of maritime disaster . Barron liked this man , for he was outspoken and held vigorous views , but the two quarreled freely . " Fate was a fool when she chucked her presents into the lap of a lazy beggar like you , " said Brady , addressing the visitor . " And thrice a fool , " he added , " to assort her gifts so ill . " " Fate is a knave , a mad thing playing at cat 's cradle with the threads of our wretched little lives , " answered John Barron , " she is a coward — a bully . She hits the hungry below the belt ; she heaps gold into the lap of the old man , but not till he has already dug his own grave to come at it ; she gives health to those who must needs waste all their splendid strength on work ; and wealth to worthless beings like myself who are always ailing and who never spend a pound with wisdom . Make no dark cryptic mystery of Fate when you paint her . She looks to me like a mischievous monkey poking sticks into an ant - hill . " " She 's a woman , " said Murdoch . " She 's three , " corrected Brady ; " what can you expect from three women rolled into one ? " " Away with her ! Waste no incense at her shrine . She 'll cut the thread no sooner because you turn your back on her . Fling overboard your mythologies , dead and alive , and kneel to Nature . A budding spike of wild hyacinth is worth all the gods put together . Go hand in hand with Nature , I say . Ask nothing from her ; walk humbly ; be well content if she lets you but turn the corner of one page none else have read . That 's how I live . My life is not a prayer exactly — " " I should say not , " interrupted Brady . " But a hymn of praise — a purely impersonal existence , lived all alone , like a man at a prison window . This carcass , with its shaky machinery and defective breathing apparatus , is the prison . I look out of the window till the walls crumble away — " " And then ? " asked one Paul Tarrant , a painter who prided himself on being a Christian as well . " Then , the spark which I call myself , goes back to Nature , as the cloud gives the raindrop back to the sea from whence the sun drew it . " " A lie , man ! " answered the other hotly . " Perhaps . It matters nothing . God — if there be a God — will not blame me for making a mistake . Meantime I live like the rook and the thrush . They never pray , they praise , they sing '
2745	2773	2780	2780	he	486	' and after it , as Nature taught them . " " A simple child of Nature — beautiful spectacle , " said Brady . " But I 'm
2892	2899	2888	2888	Barren	177	' Sacrifice all the world to mood '
3287	3303	3284	3284	your	487	' Shanters and aggressive neckties and knickerbockers and calves , would frighten the devil . I 'm
3350	3916	3349	3349	You	487	're all so certain . Probably I shall find myself beaten like the rest of you . But it 's worth trying . She 's a pretty thing . " " How will you paint her if you get the chance ? " " Do n't know yet . I should like to paint her in a wolf - skin with a thread of wolf 's teeth round her neck and a celt - headed spear in her hand . " " Art will be a loser by the pending repulse , " declared Brady . " And now , as my whisky - bottle 's empty and my lamp going out , you chaps can follow its example whenever you please . " So the men scattered into a starry night , and went , each his way , through the streets of the sleeping village . Edmund Murdoch 's studio stood high on Newlyn hill , and Barron had taken comfortable rooms in a little lodging - house close beside it . The men often enjoyed breakfast in each other 's company , but on the following morning , when Murdoch strolled over to see his friend , he found that his rooms were empty . Barron , in fact , was already nearly a mile from Newlyn , and , at the moment when the younger artist sought him , he stood upon a footpath which ran through plowed fields to the village of Paul . In the bottom of his mind ran a current of thought occupied with the problem of Joan Tregenza , but , superficially , he was concerned with the spring world in which he walked . He stood where Nature , like Artemis , appeared as a mother of many breasts . Brown and solemn in their undulations , they rose about and around him to the sky - line , where the land cut sharply against a pale blue heaven from which tinkled the music of larks . He watched a bird wind upward in a spiral to its song throne ; he noted the young wheat brushing the earth with a veil of green ; he dawdled where elms stood , their high tops thick with blossom ; and he delayed for full fifteen minutes to see the felling of one giant tree . A wedge - shaped cut had been made upon the side where the great elm was to fall , and , upon the other side , two men were sawing through the trunk . There was no sound but the steady hiss of steel teeth gnawing inch by inch to the wine - red heart of the tree . Sunshine glimmered on its leafy crown , and as yet distant branch and bough knew nothing of the midgets and Death below . Barron took pleasure in seeing the great god Change at work , but he mourned in that a masterpiece , on which Nature had bestowed half a century and more of love , must now vanish . " A pity , " he said , while the executioners rested a few moments from their labors , " a pity to cut down such a noble tree . " One woodman laughed , and the other — an old rustic , brown and bent — made answer : " I sez '
3921	3929	3349	3349	You	487	' Us doan't take no joy in thrawin '

4064	4385	4393	4393	Billy	188	' Mister Chirgwin . " Billy added two wedges to those already hammered into the saw - cut , then , with the sledge , he drove them home and finished his task . The sorrowful strokes rang hollow and mournful over the land , sadder to Barron 's ear than fall of earth - clod on coffin - lid . And , upon the sound , a responsive shiver and uneasy tremor ran through trunk and bough to topmost twig of the elm — a sudden sense , as it seemed , of awful evil and ruin undreamed of , but now imminent . Then the monster staggered and the midget struck his last blow and removed himself and his rheumatism . Whereupon began that magnificent descent . Slowly , with infinitely solemn sweep , the elm 's vast height swung away from its place , described a wide aerial arc , and so , with the jolting crash and rattle of close thunder , roared headlong to the earth , casting up a cloud of dust , plowing the grass with splintered limbs , then lying very still . From glorious tree to battered log it sank . No man ever saw more instant wreck and ruin fall lightning - like on a fair thing . The mass was crushed flat and shapeless by its own vast weight , and the larger boughs , which did not touch the earth , were snapped short off by the concussion of their fall . Billy Jago held his back and whined while Barron spoke , as much to himself as the woodman . " Dear God ! " he said , " to think that this glory of the hedge - row — this kingdom of song birds — should come to the making of pauper coffins and lodging - house furniture ! " " Squire must have money ; an '

5722	5835	5836	5836	Anna	193	' used to sich things . " " Let me try and find the ship , " he said , taking the glass , which he had put out of focus purposely . Then , while scanning the horizon where he had noted the smoke - trail , he spoke , his head turned from her . " Who 's Joe , if I may ask ? Your brother , I daresay ? " " No , sir ; Joe'm my sweetheart . " " There 's a big three - masted ship being taken down the Channel by a small steamer . " " Ah ! then I reckon that 's the '
5838	5839	5840	5840	Joe	192	' 'cause
5842	6228	6229	6229	Anna	193	' twas tolerable certain they 'd be in tow of a tug . " " You can see the smoke on the edge of the sea . Look below it . " He handed the glasses to her again and heard a little laugh of delight break from her lips . The surprise of the suddenly - magnified spectacle , visible only as a shadow to the naked eye , brought laughter ; and Barron , now that the girl 's attention was occupied , had leisure to look at her . She was more than a pretty cottage maid , and possessed some distinction and charm . There was a delicacy about her too — a sweet turn of lip , a purity of skin , a set of limb — which gave the lie to her rough speech . She was all Saxon to look at , with nothing of the Celt about her excepting her name and the old Cornish words upon her lips . Those he rejoiced in , for they showed that she still remained a free thing , primitive , innocent of School Boards , or like frost - biting influences . Barron took mental notes . Joan Tregenza was a careless young woman , it seemed . Her dress had a button or two missing in front , and a safety - pin had taken their place . Her drab skirt was frayed a little and patched in one corner with a square of another material . But the colors were well enough , from the artist 's point of view . He noted also that the girl 's stockings were darned and badly needed further attention , for above her right shoe - heel a white scrap of Joan was visible . Her hands were a little large , but well shaped ; her pose was free and fine , though the field - glasses spoiled the picture and the sun - bonnet hid the contour of her head . " So you walked out from Mouzle to see the last of Joe 's ship ? " he asked , quite seriously and with no light note in his voice . " From Newlyn . I ed'n a Mouzle maid , " she answered . " Is the '
6230	6266	5840	5840	Joe	192	' coming home again soon ? " " No , sir . Her 's bound for the Gulf of Californy , round t'other side the world , Joe sez . He reckons to be back agin '
6282	6418	6280	6280	Iss	194	' tis . " But there was no sentiment about the answer . Joan gazed without a shadow of emotion at the vanishing ship , and alluded to the duration of her sweetheart 's absence in a voice that never trembled . Then she gave the glass back to Barron with many thanks , and evidently wanted to be gone , but stopped awkwardly , not quite knowing how to depart . Meanwhile , showing no further cognizance of her , Barron took the glasses himself and looked at the distant ship . " A splendid vessel , " he said . " I expect you have a picture of her , have n't you ? " " No , " she answered , " but I 've got a lil ship Joe cut out o '
6421	6474	6475	6475	Anna	193	' painted butivul . Awnly that 's another vessel what Joe sailed in afore . " " I 'll tell you what I 'll do , " he said , " because you were good enough to explain all about the fishing - boats . I 'll make a tiny picture of the '
6476	6531	6475	6475	Anna	193	' and paint it and give it to you . " But the girl took fright instantly . " You'm a artist , then ? " she said , with alarm in her face and voice . He shook his head . " No , no . Do I look like an artist ? I 'm

6989	7059	6985	6985	Joe	192	' " he said to himself , " a happy title enough . " And meantime the girl had looked after him with wonder and some amusement in her eyes , had rubbed her chin reflectively — a habit caught from her father — and had then scampered off smiling to herself . " What a funny gent , " she thought , " never laughs nor nothin' . An '

7081	7178	6985	6985	Joe	192	' nough . " Joan Tregenza lived in a white cottage already mentioned : that standing just beyond Newlyn upon a road above the sea . The cot was larger than it appeared from the road and extended backward into an orchard of plum and apple - trees . The kitchen which opened into this garden was stone - paved , cool , comfortable , sweet at all times with the scent of wood smoke , and frequently not innocent of varied fishy odors . But Newlyn folk suck in a smell of fish with their mothers '
7181	7302	6985	6985	Joe	192	' Tis part of the atmosphere of home . When Joan returned from her visit to Gorse Point , she found a hard - faced woman , thin of figure , with untidy hair , wrinkled brow and sharp features , engaged about a pile of washing in the garden at the kitchen - door . Mrs. Tregenza heard the girl arrive , and spoke without lifting her little gray eyes from the clothes . Her voice was hard and high and discontented , like that of one who has long bawled into a deaf man 's ear and is weary of it . " Drabbit you ! Wheer you bin ? Allus trapsing out when you'm wanted ; allus caddlin '

" She approached him , and he showed her a pencil sketch now perched on the easel — a drawing considerably larger than that upon which he had been working when she arrived . " This is a rough idea of my picture . It is going to be much larger though , and I have sent all the way to London for a canvas on which to paint it . " '

I shall begin my big picture on Monday if the weather keeps kind . I shall paint here , in the open air . And I will bring your ship , too , if you care to take the trouble to come for it . " " Yes , an '
16142	16760	16059	16059	You	973	' e , sir . " " Not at all . I owe you thanks . Just think if I had gone home with that horrid blackthorn . " He turned to his work as though she were no longer present and the girl prepared to depart . " I 'll bid you good - arternoon now , sir , " she said timidly . He looked up with surprise . " Have n't you gone , Joan ? I thought you had started . Good - by until Monday . Remember , if it is cold or rainy I shall not be here . " The girl trotted off ; and when she had gone Barren drew her from memory in the center of his sketch . The golden glories of the gorse were destined to be no more than a frame for something fairer . John Barron made other preparations for his picture besides those detailed to Joan Tregenza . He designed a large canvas and proposed to paint it in the open air according to his custom . His health had improved , and the sustained splendor of the spring weather flattered hopes that , his model once won , the work he proposed would grow into an accomplished fact . There was no cottage where he might house his picture and materials within half a mile of Gorse Point , but a granite cow - byre rose considerably nearer , at a corner of an upland field . Wind - worn and lichen - stained it stood , situated not more than two hundred yards from the spot on which Barron 's picture was to be painted . A pathway to outlying farms cut the fields hard by the byre , and about it lay implements of husbandry — a chain harrow and a rusty plow . Black , tar - pitched double doors gave entrance to the shed , and light entered from a solitary window now roughly nailed up from the outside with boards . A padlock fastened the door , but , by wrenching down the covering of the window , Barron got sight of the interior . A smell of vermin and decay rose from the inner darkness ; then , as his eyes focused the gloom , he noted a dry , spacious chamber likely enough to answer his purpose . Brown litter of last year 's fern filled one corner , and in it was marked a lair as of some medium - sized beast ; elsewhere a few sacks with spades and picks and a small pile of potatoes appeared : the roots were all sprouting feebly from white eyes , as though they knew spring held the world , though neither sunshine warmed them nor soft earth aided their struggle for life . Here the man might well keep his canvas and other matters . Assuming that temporary possession of the shed was possible , his property would certainly be safe enough there ; for artists are respected in and about Newlyn , and their needs considered when possible . A farm , known as Middle Hemyll , showed gray chimneys above the fields , half a mile distant , and , after finding the shed , Barron proceeded thither to learn its ownership . The master of Middle Hemyll speedily enlightened him , and the visitor learned that not only did he speak to the possessor of the cow - byre , but that Farmer Ford was a keen supporter of art , and would be happy to rent his outhouse for a moderate consideration .

" Theer 's a many more rats here than I knawed seemin'ly , " he said , as he examined a sink in the stones of the floor , used for draining the stalls ; " they come up here for sartain , an '
17217	17347	17124	17124	they	989	' long the heydge to the mangel - wurzel mound , I lay . " Without , evidences of the vermin were clear enough . Long hardened tracks , patted down by many paws , ran this way and that ; and the main rat thoroughfare extended , as the farmer foretold , to a great mound where , stowed snugly in straw under earth , lay packed the remains of a mangel - wurzel crop . At one end the store had been opened and drawn upon for winter use ; but a goodly pile of the great tawny globes still remained , small lemon - colored leaves sprouting from them . Farmer Ford , however , viewed the treasure without satisfaction . " Us killed a power o '
17350	17372	17124	17124	they	989	' they blarsted roots last winter , " he said . " You 'd never think now as the frost could touch 'em
17380	17390	17124	17124	they	989	' to the wicked long winter . It got to 'em
17393	17397	17124	17124	they	989	' nough , an '

17539	18026	17524	17524	I	0	'em . " These things the farmer did , and presently departed , promising to revisit the spot ere long with some dogs and a ferret or two . So Barron was left master of the place . He found it dry , weather - proof and well suited to his requirements in every respect . The concerns which he had ordered from London would be with him by Saturday night if all went well , and he decided that they should be conveyed to the byre at an early hour on Monday morning . The next day was Sunday , and half a dozen men , with Barron and Murdoch among them , strolled into Brady 's great whitewashed studio to see and criticise his academy picture which was finished . Everybody declared that the artist had excelled himself in " The End of the Voyage . " It represented a sweep of the rocky coast by the Lizard , a wide gray sand , left naked by the tide , with the fringe of a heavy sea churning on it , and sea - fowl strutting here and there . In the foreground , half buried under tangles of brown weed torn from the rocks by past storms , lay a dead sailor , and a big herring - gull , with its head on one side and a world of inquiry in its yellow eyes , was looking at him . Tremendous vigor marked the work , and only a Brady could have come safely through the difficulties which had been surmounted in its creation . Everybody sang praises , and Barron nodded warm approval , but said nothing until challenged . " Now , find the faults , then tell me what 's good , " said the gigantic painter . He stood there , burly , hearty , physically splendid — the man of all others in that throng who might have been pointed to as the creator of the solemn gray picture before them . " Leave fault - finding to Fleet Street , " said Barron ; " let the press people tell you where you are wrong . I am no critic and I know what a mountain of hard work went to this . " " That 's all right , old man ; never mind the work — or me . Be impartial . " " Why should I ? To be impartial , as this world wags , is to be friendless . " " Good Lord ! d'you think I mind mauling ? There 's something wrong or you would n't be so deucedly evasive . Out with it ! " " Well , your sailor 's not dead . " Brady roared with laughter . " Man ! the poor devil 's been in the water a week ! " " Not he . '
18245	18770	18233	18233	his	176	're a brick ! I 'd sooner hear you praise those lumps of sea - spume , racing over the sand there , than see my picture on the line . " But sentiment was strange to John Barron 's impersonal nature , and he froze . " Another fault exists which probably nobody will tell you but me . Your seaweed 's great , and you knew it by heart before you painted it — that I 'll swear to , but your sleeper there would never lie in the line of it as you have him . Reflect : the sea must float the light weed after it could move him no more . He should be stogged in the sand nearer the sea . " Brady , however , contested this criticism , and so the talk wore on until the men separated . But the Irishman called on Barron after midday dinner and together they strolled through Newlyn toward the neighboring village . Chance brought them face to face with two persons more vital to the narrative than themselves , and , pausing to chronicle the event of the meeting , we may leave the artists and follow those whom they encountered . Gray Michael kept ashore on Sundays , and today , having come off the sea at dawn , was not again putting forth until next morning . He had attended meeting with his wife , his daughter and his son ; he had dined also , and was now walking over to Mousehole that he might bring some religious comfort to a sorely stricken Luke Gospeler — a young sheep but lately won to the fold and who now lay at the point of death . Joan accompanied him , and upon the way they met John Barron and his companion . The girl blushed hotly and then chilled with a great disappointment , for Barron 's eyes were on the sea ; he was talking as he passed by , and he apparently saw neither her nor her Sunday gown ; which circumstance was a sorrow to Joan . But in reality Barron missed nothing . He had shivered at her green dress and poor finery long before she reached him . Her garb ruffled his senses and left him wounded . " There goes your beauty , " laughed Brady ; " how would you like to paint her in that frock with those sinful blue flowers in her hat ? " " Nature must weep to see the bizarre carnival these people enjoy on the Seventh Day , " answered the other . " Their duns and drabs , their russets and tawny tones of red and orange , are of their environment , the proper skins for their bodies ; but to think of that girl brightening the eyes of a hundred louts by virtue of those fine feathers ! Dream of her in the Stone Age , clad in a petticoat torn from a wolf , with her straw - colored hair to her waist and a necklace of shells or wild beasts '

He and the old woman were Falmouth folks and had drifted Westerly upon the father 's death , until chance anchored them in Newlyn . Now the lad — a dissolute youth enough , until sudden illness had frightened him to religion — was dying of consumption , and dying fast , though as yet he knew it not . " '

" He read , with loud , slow voice , the fifty - fifth chapter of Isaiah , and that glorious clarion of great promise gave Michael the lie and drowned his own religious opinions as thunder drowns the croaking of marsh frogs ; but he knew it not . The brighter burned his own shining light , the blacker the shadows it threw upon the future of all sinners . As Tregenza finished and put down his Bible , the other spoke and quoted eagerly : " '

20262	20425	20243	20243	e	1050	'em — ? " The fisherman reflected . Vallack 's proposition did not strike him as particularly grotesque . He felt it was a natural question , and he only regretted that it had been put , because , though he had driven more than one young man to righteousness along the path of terror , in this present case the truth came too late save to add another horror to death . He believed in all sincerity that as surely as the young man before him presently died , so surely would he be damned , but he saw no particular object in stating the fact . Such intelligence might tell upon Vallack 's physical condition — a thing of all others to be avoided , for Gray Michael held that the sufferer 's only chance of a happy eternity was increased and lengthened opportunity in time . " It ed'n for me to sit in the Judgment Seat , Albert . '

The gorse will be nearly as large as life , and I 've been wondering ever so long what I shall put in the middle ; and whatever do you think I 've thought of ? " " I dunnaw . That white pony us saw , p'raps ? " " No ; something much prettier . How would it do , d'you think , if you stood here in front of the gorse , just to fill up the middle piece of the picture ? " " Oh , no , no ! My faither — " " You misunderstand , Joan . I do n't want a picture of you , you know ; I 'm

" He looked into her eyes with a steady , inquiring glance , and Joan experienced a new emotion . Joe had never looked like that ; nor yet her father . She felt a will stronger than her own was busy with her inclinations . Volition remained free , and yet she doubted whether under any circumstances could she refuse his petition . As it happened , however , she already liked the man . He was so respectful and polite . Moreover , she felt sad to hear that he suffered in health . He would not ask her to do wrong and she felt certain that she might trust him . A trembling wish and a longing to comply with his request already mastered her mind . " You'm sure — gospel truth — theer ed'n no harm in it ? " " Trust me . " In five minutes he had posed her as he wished and was drawing , while every word he spoke put Joan more at her ease . The spice of adventure and secrecy fired her and she felt the spirit of romance in her blood , though she knew no name for it . Here was a secret delight knocking at the gray threshold of every - day life — an adventure which might last for many days . Barron , to touch the woman in her if he could , harped upon her gown and the color of it , on her shoes and sun - bonnet — on everything but herself . Presently he reaped his reward . " Ban't you gwaine to paint my faace as well , Mister Jan. " " Yes , if I can . But your eyes are blue , and blue eyes are hard to paint well . Yours are so very blue , Joan . Did n't Joe ever tell you that ? " " No — that 's all fulishness . " " Nothing that 's true is foolish . Now I 'm

" Barren had heard of the votive offerings left by the faithful in past days at St. Madron 's shrine , but felt somewhat surprised to find the practice dated back to a time so recent as Joan 's infancy . He let her talk on , for the subject was evidently dear to the girl . " And what did the mothers give the saint ? " " Why , rags mostly . Just a rag tored off a petticoat , or some sich thing . They hanged 'em

23809	23816	23771	23777	Theer 's Robin o ' the Carn	3890	' the gal had a braave time '

23869	23882	23771	23777	Theer 's Robin o ' the Carn	3890	' corn in a barn up Drift . They was tiny fellers wi '
23885	23890	23891	23891	they	1139	' red faaces , an '
23908	23910	23904	23904	they	1139	' an '

23975	23993	23953	23953	you	1142	'cause that 's what us allus sez if a body sneezes . Then they all took fright an '
24008	24025	23953	23953	you	1142	'cause my awn gran'mother tawld it . But they ded'n leave the farm , though nobody seed 'em

24082	24242	23953	23953	you	1142	'm certain you would suit them well , Joan ; and they would be lucky to get you , I think ; but I hope they wo n't go and carry you off until I 've done with you , at any rate . " She laughed , and he bid her put down her hand from her eyes and rest . He had brought some oranges for her , but judged the friendship had gone far enough , and first decided not to produce them . Half an hour later , however , when the sitting was ended , he changed his mind . " Can you come to - morrow , Joan ? I am entirely in your hands , remember , and must consider your convenience always . In fact , I am your servant and shall wait your pleasure at all times . " Joan felt proud and rather important . " I 'll come at '
24361	24790	24794	24794	she	1149	'm sure . " He bowed gravely and took off his cap , then turned to his easel ; and she blushed with a lively pleasure . She had seen gentlemen take off their hats to ladies , but no man had ever paid her that respect until then , and it seemed good to her . She marched off with her picture and her orange , but did not eat the fruit until out of sight of Gorse Point . The man painting there already began to fill a space in Joan 's thoughts . He knew so much and yet was glad to learn from her . He never laughed or talked lightly . He put her in mind of her father for that reason , but then his heart was soft , and he loved Nature and beautiful things , and believed in fairies and spoke no ill of anybody . Joan speculated as to how these meetings could be kept a secret and came to the conclusion it would not be difficult to hide them . Then , reaching home , she hid her picture behind the pig - sty until opportunity offered for taking it indoors to her own bedroom unobserved . As for John Barren , he felt kindly enough toward his model . He could hold himself with an iron hand when he pleased , and proposed that the growing friendship should ripen into a fine work of art and no more . But what might go to the making of the picture could not be foretold . He would certainly allow nothing to check inspiration or stand between him and the very best he had power to achieve . No sacrifice could be too great for Art , and Barron , who was now awake and alive for an achievement , would , according to his rule , count nothing hard , nothing impossible that might add a grain of value to the work . His own skill and Joan 's beauty were brought in contact and he meant to do everything a man might do to make the result immortal . But the human instruments necessary to such work counted for nothing , and their personal prosperity and welfare would weigh no more with him than the future of the brushes which he might use , after he had done with them . Joan 's first announcement upon the following morning was a regret that the sitting must be short . " We'm mighty busy , come wan thing an '
24804	24811	24794	24794	she	1149	' my brother to buy his seafarin '
24827	24841	24794	24794	she	1149	' to dinner , which he ai n't done this long time ; an '
24861	24908	24951	24951	he'm	1153	' back from the islands a'ready . " " You shall stop just as short a time as you choose , Joan . It was very good of you to come at all under these circumstances , " declared the artist . " Us be fine an '

Her blue eyes were clouded , for she deemed that he had put an insult upon her budding womanhood . Barren showed no sign of his enjoyment , but explained as clearly as possible that she was looking at a thing wholly unfinished , indeed scarce begun . " You might as well grumble with me for not painting your fingers or your face , Joan . I told you I was a slow artist ; only be patient ; I 'm

27282	27479	27256	27256	I	0	' tis done . " Uncle Chirgwin sat by the fireside with a placid if bored expression on his round face . His hands were folded on his stomach ; his short legs were stuck out before him ; his head was quite bald , his color high , his gray eyes weak , though they had some laughter hidden in them . His double chin was shaved , but a very white bristle of stubbly whisker surrounded it and ascended to where all that remained of his hair stuck , like two patches of cotton wool , above his ears . The old man wore a suit of gray tweed and blinked benignly through a pair of spectacles . He had already heard enough of Mrs. Tregenza 's troubles to last some time , and turned with pleasure to Joan as she entered . So hearty indeed was the greeting and a kiss which accompanied it that his niece felt the displeasure which her uncle had recorded by post upon the occasion of her engagement to Mary Chirgwin 's former sweetheart existed no more . " My ivers ! a braave , bowerly maid you'm grawin '

" Fired by a word which she had heard from John Barron , that flowers became the house as well as the garden , Joan plucked an early sprig of pink ribe and the first buds of wall - flower before returning to the kitchen . These she put in a jug of water and planted boldly upon the dinner - table as Mrs. Tregenza brought out a pie . " Butivul , sure '

29476	29484	29455	29457	the old man	3536	' money . " " Ay , an '

29518	29756	29762	29762	he	1268	' Tis a nest - egg as he shall add to as he may . " Tom did not foresee this arrangement , and had something to say as he tramped off with his mother to town ; but though he could do more with her and get more out of her than anybody else in the world , money was a subject concerning which Mrs. Tregenza always had her way . She understood it and loved it and allowed no interference from anybody , Michael alone excepted . But he cared not much for money and was well content to let his wife hold the purse ; yet when he did occasionally demand an account , it was always forthcoming to the uttermost farthing , and he fully believed what other people told him that Thomasin could make a sixpenny - piece go further than any other woman in Newlyn . Mother and son presently departed ; while Mr. Chirgwin took off his coat , lighted his pipe , and walked with Joan round about the orchard . He foretold great things for the plums , now in full flower ; he poked the pigs with his stick and spoke encouragingly of their future also . Then he discussed Joan 's prospects and gladdened her heart by telling her the past must be let alone and need never be reverted to again . " Mary 's gettin '
29798	29812	29762	29762	he	1268	' nough good in , I allus says , let alone the doin' o '

Yet this is hardly to be called an east wind , so soft and balmy does it keep . " " Well , you seem to be the better for your work , at any rate . You 're

I tried holding my hand over my eyes yesterday to see how long I could do so without wearying myself . I found that three minutes was quite enough , but I have often kept you posed for five . " " It hurted my arm '
31921	31971	31826	31826	he	176	' elbow a lil bit at first , but I 've grawed used to it now . " " How ever shall I repay you , kind Joan , for all your trouble and your long walks and pretty stories ? " " I doan't need no pay . If '

32085	32181	32068	32068	you'm	1313	'm afraid I must be a poor substitute for Joe . " He noticed she had never mentioned her sweetheart since their early interviews , and wanted to ascertain of what nature was Joan 's affection for the sailor . He did not yet dream how faint a thing poor Joe had shrunk to be in Joan 's mind , or how the present episode in her life was dwarfing and dominating all others , present and past . Nor did the girl 's answer to his remark enlighten him . " In coorse you an '
32194	32206	32189	32189	You	1315	' be a gen'le - man ; Joe 's only a seafarin '
32210	32211	32212	32212	e	1316	' '
32216	32528	32529	32529	e	1317	' cept what he 's larned from faither . But Joe used to say a sight more'n what you do , for all that . " " I like to hear you talk , Joan ; perhaps Joe liked to hear himself talk . Most men do . But , you see , the things you have told me are pleasant to me and they were not to Joe , because he did n't believe in them . Do n't look at me , Joan ; look right away to the edge of the sea . " " You'm surprised like as I talks to ye , Mister Jan. Doan't ladies talk so free as what I do ? " " Other women talk , but they are very seldom in earnest like you are , Joan . They do n't believe half they say , they pretend and make believe ; they 've got to do so , poor things , because the world they live in is all built up on ancient foundations of great festering lies . The lies are carefully coated over and disinfected as much as possible and quite hidden out of sight , but everybody knows they are there — everybody knows the quaking foundations they tread upon . Civilization means universal civility , I suppose , Joan ; and to be civil to everybody argues a great power of telling lies . People call it tact . But I do n't like polite society myself , because my nose is sensitive and I smell the stinking basis through all the pretty paint . You and I , Joan , belong to Nature . She is not always civil , but you can trust her ; she is seldom polite , but she never says what is not true . " " You talk as though '
32535	32551	32533	32536	ladies an ' gen'lemen	4033	' gen'lemen , same as you be . " " I do n't , and I 'm
32557	32561	32562	32562	Joan	183	' a gentleman , '
32628	32655	32673	32674	Mister Jan	241	'm sick of them . If a man wishes to know what polite society is let him go into it as a very wealthy bachelor . I 'm
32657	32661	32662	32662	you	1323	' a gentleman , '
32682	32983	32681	32681	you	1323	're a lady . But I can try to be gentle and manly , which is better . You and I come from the same class , Joan ; from the people . The only difference is that my father happened to make a huge fortune in London . Guess what he sold ? " " I dunnaw . " " Fish — just plaice and flounders and herrings and so forth . He sold them by tens of thousands . Your father sells them too . But what d'you think was the difference ? Why , your father is an honest man ; mine was n't . The fishermen sold their fish , after they had had the trouble and danger of catching them , to my father ; and then my father sold them again to the public ; and the fishermen got too little and the public paid too much , and so — I'm a very rich man to - day — the son of a thief . " " Mister Jan ! " " Nobody ever called him a thief but me . He was a great star in this same polite society I speak of . He fed hundreds of fat people on the money that ought to have gone into the fishermen 's pockets ; and he died after eating too much salmon and cucumber at his own table . Poetic justice , you know . There are stained glass windows up to his memory in two churches and tons of good white marble were wasted when they made his grave . But he was a thief , just as surely as your father is an honest man ; so you have the advantage of me , Joan . I really doubt if I 'm
32998	33006	32995	32995	I	0	' e with anything , Mister Jan , 'cause
33012	33130	32995	32995	I	0	' true . " " Do n't be too sure — the son of a thief may have wrong ideas and lax principles . Many things not to be bought can easily be stolen . " Again he struck a sinister note , but this time on an ear wholly unable to appreciate or suspect it . Joan was occupied with Barron 's startling scraps of biography , and , as usual , when he began talking in a way she could not understand , turned to her own thoughts . This sudden alteration of his position she took literally . It struck her in a happy light . " If you'm not a gen'leman then you wouldn '
33133	33138	32995	32995	I	0	' pon me , would '
33216	33221	33222	33222	Barron	176	' Mister Jan , " '
33239	33244	33222	33222	Barron	176	'm a man and you 're
33628	33709	33605	33605	his	0	' that even , Mister Jan ? " He laughed and shook his head . " Not one , Joan — not anybody in all the world to think twice about me but you . " Her heart beat hard and her breath quickened , but she did not speak . Then Barron , putting down his brushes and beginning to load a pipe , that his next remark might not seem too serious , proceeded : " I call you '
33712	33838	33850	33850	He	1344	' Joan , because I know you are one . And I want you to think of me sometimes when I am gone , will you ? " He went on filling his pipe , and then , looking suddenly into her eyes , saw there a light that was strange — a light that he would have given his soul to put into paint — a light that Joe 's name never had kindled and never could . Joan wiped her hand across her mouth uneasily ; then she twisted her hands behind her back , like a schoolgirl standing in class , and made answer with her eyes on the ground . " Iss , I will , then , Mister Jan ; an '
36644	36661	36617	36617	she	272	' e another braave shell , so us will . Theer , theer , give over an '

37153	37338	37339	37339	e	1469	' . Well — well ! " The little bride advanced between her father and mother , while relations and friends marched two and two behind . A vision it was of age and youth , of bright spring flowers , of spotless cotton and black broadcloth . A matron or two marched in flaming colors ; a few fishermen wore their blue jerseys under their reefer jackets ; the smaller children were led by hand ; and the whole party numbered twelve all told . Mr. Penn looked up at the flags as he limped along , and a great delight broke out upon his face ; the bride 's mother beamed with satisfaction at a compliment not by any means expected , for the Penns were a humble folk ; and the bride blushed and stole a nervous peep at the display . Mr. Penn touched his hat to the party in the garden , and Mr. Trevennick , feeling the eye of the multitude upon him , loudly wished the wedding party well as it passed by . " Good speed to '
37341	37352	37368	37368	e	1469	' to the maid , Bill Penn . May she live '
37355	37367	37368	37368	e	1469	' be a credit to all parties consarned . " " Thank '

37402	37441	37368	37368	e	1469	' e. " So the party tramped on and ugly Sally looked after them with dim eyes ; but Mrs. Tregenza 's thin voice dried them . " A bad come - along o't for a gal to walk '

" But Taskes have bought flam - new furniture for his parlor , they sez , " declared the former speaker . " Of coorse . Still no honeymoon '
37723	37742	37764	37764	Sally	272	' shamed . " " Less shame , Mrs. Tregenza , than trapsing off to Truro or somewheers an '

He went further and declared the omission of such an institution to be unprincipled . He even said that had he known of this serious defect in the ceremonies he should certainly have abstained from lending the brightness of his bunting to them . Then he went to eye the flags from different points of view , while Sally , in a minority of one , turned to Joan . " And what do you say ? " she asked . " You'm '
37913	37916	37959	37960	Mrs. Tregenza	198	' quiet an '

Michael was due at home about ten o'clock or earlier , and Joan — having set out supper , made all ready , and ascertained that her stepmother had gone to sleep — walked out to the pierhead , there to wait for Mr. Tregenza and Tom . Under moonlight , the returning luggers crept homeward , like inky silhouettes on a background of dull silver . Every moment added to the forest of masts anchored at the moorings outside the harbor ; every minute another rowing - boat shot between the granite piers , slid silently into the darkness under shore , leaving moonlit rings widening out behind at each dip of the oars . Joan sat down under the lighthouse and waited in the stillness for her father 's boat . Yellow flashes , like fireflies , twinkled along through Newlyn , and above them the moon brought out square patches of silver - bright roof seen through a blue night . Now and then a bell rang in the harbor , and lights leaped here and there , mingling red snakes and streamers of fire with the white moonbeams where they lay on still water . Then Joan knew the fish were being sold by auction , and she grew anxious for her father 's return , fearing prices might have fallen before he arrived . Great periods of silence lay between the ringings of the bell , and at such times only faint laughter floated out from shore , or blocks chipped and rattled as a sail came down or a concertina squeaked fitfully where it was played on a Norwegian iceboat at the harbor quay . The tide ran high , and Joan watched the lights reflected in the harbor and wondered why the gold of them contrasted so ill with the silver from the moon . Presently two men came along to the pierhead . They smoked , looked at the sea , and did not notice her where she sat in shadow . One , the larger , wore knickerbockers , talked loudly , and looked a giant in the vague light ; the other was muffled up in a big ulster , and Joan would not have recognized Barron had he not spoken . But he answered his friend , and then the girl 's heart leaped to hear that quiet , unimpassioned voice . He spoke of matters which she did not understand , of pictures and light and all manner of puzzles set by Nature for the solution of art ; but though for the most part his remarks conveyed no meaning to her , yet he closed a sentence with words that made her happy , and warmed her heart and left a precious memory behind them . " Moonlight is a problem only less difficult than sunshine , " he said to his friend . " Where are you going to get that ? " and he pointed to the sea . " It 's been jolly well done all the same . " " Never . It is not to be done . You can suggest by a trick , but God defend us from tricks and sleight - of - hand in connection with the solemn business of painting pictures . Let us be true or nothing . " They walked away together , and Joan pondered over the last words . Truth seemed an eternal , abiding passion with John Barron , and the contemplation of this idea gave her considerable pleasure . She did not know that a man may be at once true to his art and a liar to his fellows . Presently her father returned with Tom , and the three walked home together . Gray Michael appeared quietly satisfied that his son was shaping well and showing courage and nerve . But he silenced the lad quickly enough when Tom began to talk with some gasconade concerning greet deeds done westward of the Scilly Islands . " '

" Then they all tramped home , and the boy enjoyed the glories of a late supper , though he was half asleep before he had finished it . By half - past five o'clock , Mr. Tregenza 's black lugger was off again in a gray dawn all tangled with gold on the eastern horizon . His mother had given Tom an early breakfast at half - past four , and the youngster , agape and dim - eyed at first , speedily brightened up , for he had a willing listener , in the candle - light and poured a tale of moving incidents into Thomasin 's proud but uneasy mind .

You see , men who paint pictures and love what is beautiful and dream about beautiful things and beautiful people see all sorts of visions sometimes . I have pictures in my head a thousand times more splendid than any I shall ever put upon canvas , because mere paint - brushes can not do much , even when they are in the cleverest hands ; but a man 's brain is not bound down by material , mechanical matters . My brain made a picture of you last night — a picture that came and looked at me on my fern bed — a picture so real , so alive that I could see it move and hear it laugh . You think that wonderful . It is n't really , because my brain has done nothing but think of you now for nearly six weeks . My eye studies you and stamps you upon my brain ; then , when night comes , and no man works , and the world is dark and silent , my brain sets off on its own account and raises up a magic vision just to show me what you really are — how different to this poor daub here . " " Lard , Mister Jan ! I never heard tell of sich a coorious thing as that . " " And the pretty dream - Joan can talk almost as well as you can ! Why , last night , while I was half awake and half asleep , she put her hand upon my shoulder and said kind things , but I dared not move or kiss her hand at first for fear she would vanish if I did . " Joan laughed . " That is a funny story , sure '

It seemed that you had come , Joan , it seemed that you had purposely come from your little cottage on the cliff through the darkness before dawn . Why ? To share my loneliness , to brighten my poor shadowy life . Dreams are funny things , are they not ? What d'you think you said ? " " Sure I dunnaw . " " Why , you said that you were not going to leave me any more ; that you believed in me and that you had come to me because it was bad for a man to live all alone in the world . You said that you felt alone too — without me . And it made me feel happy to hear you say that , though I knew , all the time , that it was not the real beautiful Joan who spoke to me . " Thereupon the girl asked a question which seemed to argue some sharpening of intelligence within her . " An '
40639	40675	40631	40631	he	0	' Twould be wrong to kiss any maiden , I reckon , onless you was tokened to her or she were your awn sister . " " But , as we look at life , we 're
40731	40775	40776	40776	you	0	' see me , " she said , changing the conversation with abruptness . " Yes , I did , " he answered , " sitting under the shadow of the lighthouse , waiting for Mr. Tregenza , I expect . " " An '
40782	40880	40885	40885	she	1525	' me ! " He flung down his brushes , turned away from the picture before he had touched it , and went and lay near the edge of the cliff . " Come here , Joan , and I will tell you why I did n't notice you , though I longed to do so . Come and sit down by me and I 'll explain why I seemed so rude . " She came slowly and sat down some distance from him , putting her elbows on her knees and looking away to sea . " '
40901	40903	40885	40885	she	1525	' me '
40909	40937	40885	40885	she	1525	'bout yourself . " " You must n't say that , Joan , or you 'll make me unhappy . Ashamed of you ! Is it likely I 'm
40953	40960	40885	40885	she	1525	'm frightened of losing you ; I 'm
41010	41155	41164	41164	you	0	'm very fond of my friend , and very proud of her , and as greedy as a miser over his gold . " Joan took a long breath before this tremendous assertion . He had told her in so many words that he was fond of her ; and he had mentioned it most casually as a point long since decided . Here was the question which she had asked herself so often answered once for all . Her heart leaped at tidings of great joy , and as she looked up into his face the man saw infinite wonder and delight in her own . Mind was adding beauty to flesh , and he , fast losing the artist 's instinct before another , thought she had never looked so lovely as then . " Oh , Mister Jan , you'm fond o '
41270	41305	41267	41267	Joan	183	'm not . A thing has come between me and my happiness , between me and my picture . I know not what to call it . Nature has sent it . " " Then '
41309	41346	41347	41347	e	1533	' proper , I s'pose ? " " I suppose so , but it stops work . It makes my hand shake and my heart throb fast and my brains grow hot . " " Ca n't '

41492	41585	41467	41467	he	0	' e ! I 'd never a thot — " She started from him , wild , alarmed , blushing hotly ; and he shook his head at her dismay and answered very calmly , very seriously : " It was not wrong , Joan , or I should not have done it . You heard me ask to whom I should pray for inspiration , and Nature told me I must seek it from you . And I have . " " You should n't never a done it . I trusted '
41600	41612	41598	41598	Nature	178	' Kiss her , and you will find what you want . '
41747	41844	41873	41873	she	1540	' tween us . You knaws it , Mr. Jan. " " It is right and proper and fair and beautiful , " he said quietly . " My heart sang when I kissed you , Joan , and so did yours . D'you know why ? Because we are two halves of a whole . Because the sunshine of your life would go out without me ; because my life , which never had any sunshine in it until now , has been full of sunshine since I knew Joan . " " I dunnaw . '
41853	41857	41873	41873	she	1540	' how I trusted '
41905	42713	41891	41891	She	1540	'm very sorry . I thought she had told you to love me , but I suppose I was wrong . Never mind this once . Forgive me , Joan . I 'll even fight Nature rather than make you angry with me . Let me finish my picture and go away . Come . I 've no business to waste your precious time , though you have been so kind and generous with it . Only I was tired and hopeless and you came like a drink of wine to me , Joan ; and I drank too much , I suppose . " He picked up his brushes , spoke in a sad minor key , and seemed crushed and weary . The flash died from his face and he looked older again . Joan , the mistress of the situation , found it wholly bitter . She was bewildered , for affairs had proceeded with such rapidity . He had declared frankly that he loved her , and yet had stopped there . To her ideas it was impossible that a man should say as much as that to a woman and no more . Love invariably meant ultimate union for life , Joan thought . She could not understand any other end to it . The man talked about Nature as a little child talks of its mother . He had deemed himself entirely in the right ; yet something — not Nature , she supposed — had told her that he was wrong . But who was she to judge him ? Who was she to say where his conduct erred ? He loved truth . It was not a lie to kiss a girl . He promised nothing . How could he promise anything or propose anything ? Was she not another man 's sweetheart ? That doubtless had been the reason why he had said no more than that he loved her . To love her could be no sin . Nature had told him to ; and God knew how she loved him now . But she could not make it up with him . A cold curtain seemed to have fallen between them . The old reserve which had only melted after many meetings , was upon him again . He stood , as it seemed , on the former pedestal . A strange , surging sensation filled her head — a sense of helpless fighting against a flood of unhappy affairs . All the new glory of life was suddenly tarnished through her own act , and she felt that things could never be the same again . She thought and thought . Then John Barron saw Joan 's blue eyes begin to wink ominously , the corners of her bonny mouth drag down and something bright twinkle over her cheek . He took no notice , and when he looked up again , she had moved away and was sitting on the grass crying bitterly with her hands over her face . The sun was bright , a lark sang overhead ; from adjacent inland fields came the jolt and clank of a plow with a man 's voice calling to his horses at the turns . The artist put down his palette and walked over to Joan . " My dear , my dear , " he said , " d'you know what 's making you so unhappy ? " She sobbed on and did not answer . " I can tell you , I think . You do n't quite know whether to believe me or not , Joan . That is very natural . Why should you believe me ? And yet if you knew — " She sat up , swallowed some of her tears , and smudged her face with her knuckles . He took a clean handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to her . It was cool and pleasant , and she went on crying a while , but tears which were comforting and different to the first stinging drops bred from a sudden , forlorn survey of life . He talked on , and his voice soothed her . He kept his distance , and presently , as her ruffled spirit grew calmer , his remarks assumed a brighter note . " Has my poor little Lady of the Gorse forgiven me at last ? She wo n't punish me any more , I know , and it is a very terrible punishment to see tears in her eyes . " Then she found her tongue again and words to answer him , together with fluttering sighs that told the tears were ended . " I dunnaw why for I cried , Mr. Jan , but I seemed '
42718	42730	42731	42731	I	0	'm a stupid fule of a maid , I reckon , an '
42733	42743	42731	42731	I	0	' tis auld - fashioned notions as I 've got 'bout
42748	42763	42764	42764	you	1541	' wrong . But , coorse , you knaws better'n what I can ; an '
42770	42781	42764	42764	you	1541	'cause you loves me — you've said it ; an'—an'—I love '
42789	42791	42792	42792	e	1542	' sure '
42824	44788	44790	44792	the piskey men	1545	're bound to love one another . She made us for that very reason ! " He knew that her mind was full of the tangles of life and that she wanted him to solve some of the riddles just then uppermost in her own existence . He felt that Joe was in her thoughts , and he easily divined her unuttered question as to why Nature had sent Joe before she had sent him . But , though answers and explanations of her troubles were not likely to be difficult , he had no wish to make them or to pursue the subject just then . Indeed , he bid Joan depart an hour before she need have done so . Her face was spoiled for that sitting , and matters had progressed up to the threshold of the barrier . Before that could be broken down , she must be made to feel that she was necessary to the happiness of his life ; as he already felt that she was necessary to the completion of his picture . She loved him very dearly , and he , though love was not possible to his nature , could feel the substitute . He had fairly stepped out of his impersonal shell into reality . Presently he would return to his shell again . For a moment a model had grown more to him than a picture ; and he told himself that he must obey Nature in order adequately to serve Art . He picked up the handkerchief he had lent Joan , looked at the dampness of the tear - stains , and then spread it in the sun to dry . While John Barren determined that a space of time extending over some days should now separate him from Joan , she , for her part , had scarce left Gorse Point after the conversation just chronicled when there came a great longing in her heart to return thither . As she walked home she viewed wearily the hours which lay between her and the following morning when she might go back to him and see his face again . Time promised to drag for the next day and night . Already she framed in her mind the things her mouth should say to - morrow ; and that almost before she was beyond sight of the man 's easel . Her fears had vanished with her tears . The future was entirely in his hand now , for she had accepted his teaching , endeavored to look at life with his eyes , made his God her own , so far as she had wit to gather what his God was . She accepted the situation with trust , and felt responsibility shifted on to " Mister Jan 's " shoulders with infinite relief . He was very wise and knew everything and loved the truth . It is desirable to harp and harp upon this ever - recurring thought : the artist 's grand love for truth ; because all channels of Joan 's mind flowed into this lake . His sincerity begat absolute trust . And , as John Barren and his words and thoughts filled the foreground of life for her , so , correspondingly , did the affairs of her home , with all the circumstances of existence in the old environment , peak and dwindle toward shadowy insignificance . Her father lost his majestic proportions ; the Luke Gospelers became mere objects for compassion ; the petty , temporal interests and concerns of the passing hour appeared mere worthless affairs for the occupation and waste of time . " Mister Jan " loved her , and she loved him , and what else mattered ? Past hours of unrest and wakefulness were forgotten ; her tears washed the dead anxieties clean away ; and the kiss which had caused them , though it scorched her lip when it fell there , was now set as a seal and a crowning glory to her life . He never kissed any other woman . That pledge of this rare man 's affection had been won by the magic of love , and Joan welcomed Nature gladly and called it God with a warm heart and thankful soul ; for Nature had brought about this miracle . Her former religion worked no wonders ; it had only conveyed terror to her and a comprehensive knowledge of hell . " Mister Jan " smiled at hell and she could laugh at her old fears . How was it possible to hesitate between two such creeds ? She did not do so , and , with final acceptation of the new , and secret rejection of the old , came a great peace to Joan 's heart with the whisper of many voices telling her that she had done rightly . So the storm gave place to periods of delicious calm and content only clouded by a longing to be back with the artist again . He loved her ; the voice of his love was the song of the spring weather , and the thrush echoed it and the early flowers wrote it on the hedgerows . God was everywhere to her open eyes . Everything that was beautiful , everything that was good , seemed to have been created for her delight during that homeward walk . She was mightily lifted up . Nature seemed so strong , so kind , such a guardian angel for a maiden . And the birds sang out that " Mister Jan " was Nature 's priest and could do no wrong ; and that to obey Nature was the highest good . From which reflection rose a hazy happiness — dim , beautiful and indefinable as the twinkling gold upon the sea under the throne of the sun . Joan dwelt on the memory of the day which was now over for her , and on the thought of morning hours which to - morrow would bring . But she looked no further ; and backward she did not gaze at all . No thought of Joe Noy dimmed her mental delight ; no shadowy cloud darkened the horizon then . All was bright , all perfect . Her mind seemed to be breaking its little case , as the butterfly bursts the chrysalis . Her life till then had been mere grub existence ; now she could fly and had seen the sun drawing the scent from flowers . Great ideas filled her soul ; new emotions awoke ; she was like a baby trying to utter the thing he has no word for ; her vocabulary broke down under the strain , and as she walked she gave thanks to Nature in a mere wordless song , like the lark , because she could not put her acknowledgment into language . But the great Mother , to whom Life is all in all , the living individual nothing , looked on at a world wakening from sleep and viewed the loves of the flowers and the loves of the birds and beasts and fishes with concern as keen as the love in the blue eyes of Joan upon her homeward way . Busy indeed at this vernal season was the mysterious Nurse of God 's little world . Her hands rested not from her labors . She worked strange wonders on the waste , by magic of a million breaking buds , by burying of the dead , by wafting of subtle pollen - life from blossom to blossom . And in cliffs above the green waters the nests of her wild - fowl were already lined with wool and feather ; neither were her samphires forgotten in their dizzy habitations ; and salt spray sprinkled her uncurling sea ferns in caves and crannies where they grew . She laughed at the porpoises rolling their fat sides into sunshine ; she brought the sea - otter where it should find fish for its young ; she led giant congers to drowned men ; she patted the sleek head of the sad - eyed seal . Elsewhere she showed the father - hawk a leveret crouching in his form ; she took young rabbits to the new spring grass ; the fox to the fowl , the fly to the spider , the blight to the bud . Her weakly nestlings fell from tree and cliff to die , but she beheld unmoved ; her weasel sucked the gray - bird 's egg , yet no hand was raised against the thief , no voice comforted the screaming agony of the mother . With the van of her legions she moved , and the suffering stragglers cried in vain , for her concerns were not with them . She did no right , she worked no evil ; she was not cruel , neither shall we call her kind . The servant of God was she , then as always , heedful of His utterances , obedient to His laws . Which laws , when man better divines , he shall learn thy secret too , Nurse of the world , but not sooner . Having already learned from experience that hard work quickens the flight of time , Joan , returning in happy mood to her home and with no trace of the past tears upon her cheeks , surprised Mrs. Tregenza by a display of most unusual energy and activity . She helped the butcher to get the pig into a low cart built expressly for the conveyance of such unwieldy animals ; she looked mournfully at her departing companion , knowing that the morrow had nothing for him but a knife , that he had eaten his last meal . And while Joan listened to the farewell grunts of the fattest pig which had ever adorned her father 's sty , Mrs. Tregenza counted the money and bit a piece here and there , and wondered if she could get the next young pig from Uncle Chirgwin for even a lower figure than the last . The day which had wrought such wonders for Joan 's inner life , and brought to her eyes a sort of tears unshed till then , ended at last , and for her a sleepless night followed upon it . Not until long past one o'clock in the morning did she lose consciousness , and then the thoughts of the day broke loose again in visions , taking upon themselves fantastic shapes and moving amid dream scenery of strange splendor . Now it was her turn to conjure brain pictures out of fevered thoughts , and she woke at last with a start in the dawn , to see a faint light painting the square of her bedroom window . Looking out , she found the world dimly visible , a darker shadow through the gloom where the fishing - boats were gathering in the bay , the lighthouse lamp still shining , stars twinkling overhead , absolute silence everywhere , and a cold bite about the air . The girl went back to bed again , but slept no more and anon arose , dressed , set about morning duties , and , much to Mrs. Tregenza 's astonishment , had the fire burning and breakfast ready by the time her stepmother appeared . " Aw jimmery ! " Thomasin exclaimed , as Joan came in from the outhouse to find her warming cold hands at the fire , " I could n't b'lieve my eyes at first an '

The lesson which he had set for Joan Tregenza 's learning taught John Barron something also . Eight - and - forty hours he stayed in Newlyn , and was astounded to find during that period what grip this girl had got upon his mind , how she had dragged him out of himself . His first thought was to escape all physical excitement and emotion by abandoning his picture almost upon the moment of its completion and abandoning his model too ; but various considerations cried out against such a course . To go was to escape no difficulty , but to fly from the spoils of victory . The fruit only wanted plucking , and , through pleasure , he believed that he would proceed to speedy , easy and triumphant completion of his picture . No lasting compunction colored the tenor of his thoughts . Once , indeed , upon the day when he returned to Gorse Point and saw Joan again , some shadow of regret for her swept through his brain ; but that and the issue of it will be detailed in their place . Time went heavily for him away from Joan . He roamed listlessly here and there and watched the weather - glass uneasily ; for this abstention from work was a deliberate challenge to Providence to change sunshine for rain and high temperature for low . Upon the third day therefore he returned at early morning to his picture in the shed . The greater part was finished , and the masses of gorse stood out strong , solid and complete with the slender brown figure before them . The face of it was very sweet , but to Barron it seemed as the face of a ghost , with no hot blood in its veins , no live interests in its eyes . " '

" Then it was that the shade of a compunction and the shadow of a regret touched John Barron ; and it cooled his hot blood for a brief moment , and he swore to himself he would try to paint her again as she was . He would fight Nature for once and try if pure intellect was strong enough to get the face he wanted on to the canvas without the gratification of his flesh and blood . In which determination glimmered something almost approaching to self - sacrifice in such a man . He did not answer Joan 's last remark , but rose and went to his picture , and she , thinking herself snubbed by his silence after her avowal , grew hot and uncomfortable . " The weather is going to change , sweetheart , " he said , allowing himself the luxury of affectionate words in the moment of his half - hearted struggle ; " the weather - glass creeps back slowly . We must not waste time . Come , Joan ; we are the children of Nature , but the slaves of Art . Let me try again . " But she , who had spoken in all innocence and with a child 's love , was pained that he should have taken no note of her speech . She was almost angry that he had power to conjure such words to her lips ; and yet the anger vanished from her mind quickly enough and her thoughts were all happy as she resumed her pose for him . The past few days had vastly deepened and widened her mental horizon ; and now Barron for the first time saw something of what he wanted in her eyes as she gazed away over the sea and did not look at him as usual . There , sure enough , was the soul that he knew slept somewhere , but had never seen until then . And the sight of it came as a shock and swept away his sophistries and ugly - woven ideas . Inclination had told him that Nature , through one channel only , would bring the mystery of hidden thought to Joan 's blue eyes , and he had felt well satisfied to believe it was so ; but now even the plea of Art could not excuse the thing which had grown within him of late , for experiences other than those he dreamed of had glorified the frank blue eyes and brought mind into them . Now it only remained for him to paint them if he could . Not wholly untroubled , but never much more beautiful than that morning , Joan gazed out upon the remote sea . Then the thoughtful mood passed , and she laughed and babbled again , and the new - born beauty departed from her eyes for a season , and the warm blood raced through her veins , and she was all happiness . Meanwhile nothing came of his painting and he was not sorry when she ended the ordeal . " The bwoats be comin '

49579	49616	49578	49578	I	0	'm almost afraid to let you go , Joan . " She looked at him curiously , waiting for his bidding , but he seemed moody , and said no more . " When be you comin '

" The south and west regions of distance blackened as they sat there on the cliff , and upon the sea separate heavy gusts of wind roughened up the hollows of the waves . Which effect seen from afar flickered weirdly like a sort of submarine lightning shivering white through dark water . Presently a cloud broke , showing a bank of paler gray behind , and misty silver arrows fell in broad bands of light upon the sea . They sped round , each upon the last , like the spokes of a gigantic wheel trundling over the world ; then the clouds huddled together again and the gleam of brightness died . " You'm wisht this marnin '

Then there came a harder breath of wind with a sob of sound in it , while already over the distant sea swept separate gray curtains of rain . " It 's coming , Joan ; the storm . It 's everywhere , in earth and air and water ; and in my blood . I am savage to - day , Joan , savage and thirsty . What will be the end of it ? " He spoke wildly , like the weather . She did not understand , but she felt his hand clinch tightly over hers , and , looking at the white thin fingers crooked round her wrist , they brought to her mind the twisted claws of a dead sea - gull she remembered to have found upon the beach . " What will be the end of it , Joan ? Ca n't you answer me ? " " Doan't '
51045	51057	51043	51043	you'm	241	' my hand . I s'pose as a sou'westerly gale be comin '

The rain will come and the clouds will melt , and we know , as sure as God 's in heaven , that we shall see sunshine and blue sky again . But what about our storm , Joan ; the storm of love that 's burst in my heart for you — what follows that ? " His question frightened her . She had asked herself the same and been well content to leave an answer to him . Here he was faced with a like problem and now invited her to solve it . " I dunnaw . I thot such love never comed to no end , Mister Jan. I thot '

Tregagle and his victim and the charm of the pure child that saved one from the other filled his thought and the event to which Fate was now relentlessly dragging him . He argued with himself a little ; then the rain came down and the wind leaped like a lion over the edge of the land , and the man 's blood boiled as he breathed ocean air . " Us'll be wetted proper . I 'll run for it , Mister Jan , an '
52037	52319	52320	52320	I	0	' e , I reckon . " " No , " he said , " I ca n't let you go , Joan . Look over there . Another flood is going to burst , I think . Follow me quickly , quickly . " The rain came slanting over the gorse in earnest , but Joan hesitated and hung back . Louder than the wind , louder than the cry of the birds , than the howling of Tregagle , than the calling of the cleeves , spoke something . And it said " Turn , on the wing of the storm ; fly before it , alone . Let this man walk in the teeth of the gale if he will ; but you , Joan Tregenza , follow the wind and set your face to the east , where the sole brightness now left in the sky is shining . " Sheets of gray swept over them ; the world was wet in an instant ; a little mist of water splashed up two inches high off the ground ; the gorse tossed and swayed its tough arms ; the sea and the struggling craft upon it vanished like a dream ; from the heart of the storm cried gulls , themselves invisible . " Come , Joan , we shall be drowned . " He had wrapped her in a part of the mackintosh , and laughed as he fastened them both into it and hugged her close to himself . But she broke away , greatly fearing , yet knowing not what she feared . " I reckon I 'd best run down fast . Indeed an '

He was thinking that if Joan had possessed a reasonable measure of intellect , a foundation for an education , he would have been satisfied to keep her about him during that probably limited number of years which must span his existence . But the gulf between them was too wide ; and , as for the present position , he considered that no harm had been done which time would not remedy . Joan was not sufficiently intelligent to suffer long or much . She would forget quickly . She was very young . Her sailor must return before the end of the year . Then he began to think of money , and then sneered at himself . But , after all , it was natural that he should follow step by step upon the beaten track of similar events . " Better not attempt originality , " he thought , " for the thing I have done is scarce capable of original treatment . I suppose the curtain always rings down on a check — either taken or spurned . " " So you think you can give them all up for poor me , Joan ? Your home , your father , brother , mother — all ? " " I 've gived up a sight more'n them , Jan. I 've gived '

No fellow - creature could ever share this cynic 's barrel with him . Presently Joan departed upon her long tramp home . She had gone to convey a message to one of Thomasin Tregenza 's friends at Paul . And when the girl left him , with a promise to come at all costs upon the next sunny morning , Barron began to think about money again . He found that the larger the imaginary figures , the smaller shadow of discomfort clouded his thoughts . So he decided upon an act of princely generosity , as the result of which resolve peace returned and an unruffled mind . For the musty conventionality of his conclusion , it merely served as a peg upon which to hang thoughts not necessary to set down here . Joan had only told her lover a part of what happened in her home when Thomasin broke her suspicions to Gray Michael . He had taken the matter very seriously indeed , delivered a stern homily and commanded his daughter to read the Book of Ecclesiasticus through thrice . " '

55898	56828	55841	55841	You	1788	' . " She lied as to particulars . She had no fear of her father now as a man , but hard words always hurt her , and superstition , though she was fast breaking from many forms of it under Barron 's tuition , still chained her soul in some directions . Did her father know even a shadow of the truth , some dire and blasting prediction would probably result from it , and though personally he was little to her now , as a mouthpiece of supernatural powers he might bring blighting words upon her ; for he walked with God . But Michael 's God was Joan 's no more . She had fled from that awful divinity to the more beautiful Creator of John Barron . He was kind and gentle , and she loved to hear His voice in the hum of the bees upon the gorse and see His face everywhere in the fair on - coming of spring . Nature , as she understood it now , chimed with the things her mother had taught Joan . She found room for all the old , pretty stories in this new creed . The dear saints fitted in with it , and their wonders and mysteries , and the comprehensive if vague knowledge that " God is Love . " She believed she understood the truth about religion at last ; and Nature smiled very sweetly at her and shared in the delight of the time . So she walked dreaming on toward the invisible door of her fool 's paradise , and never guessed how near it was or what Nature would look like from the other side . She still dwelt at the little home on the cliff , so unreal and shadowy now ; she built cloud castles ablaze with happiness ; she found falsehood not difficult , for her former absolute truthfulness deadened her stepmother 's suspicion . Certain lies told at home enabled her to keep faith with the artist ; and the weather also befriending him , three more sittings in speedy succession brought John Barron to the end of his labors . After Joan 's exhibition of jealousy he was careful to say little about his work and affect no further interest in it . He let her chatter concerning the future , told her of his big house in London , and presently took care to drop hints from time to time that the habitation was by no means as yet ready to receive his bride . She always spoke on the assumption that when the picture was done he would leave for London and take her with him . She already imagined herself creeping off to join him at the station , sitting beside him in the train , and then rolling away , past Marazion , into the great unfamiliar world which lay beyond . And he knew that no such thing would happen . He intended that Joan should become a pleasant memory , with the veil of distance and time over it to beautify what was already beautiful . He wanted to remember the music of her throbbing voice , and forget the words it used to utter . The living girl 's part was played and ended . Their lives had crossed at right angles and would never meet again . " Nature makes a glorious present to Art , and I am privileged to execute the deed of gift , " thought Barron ; " that is the position in an epigram . " He felt very grateful to Joan . He knew her arm must have ached often enough , but whether her heart would presently do so he hardly felt qualified to judge . The incidents of that stormy day might have been buried in time ten years , so faint was his recollection of them now . He remembered the matter with no greater concern than the image of the shivering negresses in the blue water at Tobago . And so the picture , called " Joe 's Ship , " was finished , and while it fell far short of what Barron had hoped , yet he knew his work was great and the best thing he had done . A packing case for the canvas was already ordered and he expected it upon the identical day that saw his farewell to Joan . Bit by bit he had broken to her that it was not his intention to take her with him , but that he must go to his house alone and order things in readiness . Then he would come back and fetch her . And she had accepted the position and felt wondrous sad at the first meeting with Barren after the completion of the picture . It seemed as though a great link was broken between them , and she realized now what folly her dislike of his work had been . " I wish I could take you right away with me , Joan , my little love ; but a bachelor 's house is a comfortless concern from a woman 's point of view . You will hear from me in a day or two . You must call at the post - office in Penzance for letters , because I shall not send them here . " " You 'll print out what you writes big , so 's I doan't miss nort , wo n't '

" As for the man , he sighed when Joan disappeared ; and the expiration of breath was short and sharp as the sound of a key in a lock . He had in truth turned the key upon a diary to be opened no more ; for the sweetness of the closed chapter was embalmed in memory , blazoned on canvas . Yet there was bitterness , too , of a sort in his sigh , and the result of this sunken twinge at his heart appeared when Brady , Tarrant and one or two other artists presently joined him . They saw their companion was perturbed , and found him plunged into a black , cynic fit more deeply than usual . He spared no subject , no individual , least of all himself . Paul Tarrant — a Christian painter , already mentioned — was the first to find fault with Barron 's picture . The rest had little but praise for it , and Brady , who grew madly enthusiastic , swore that " Joe 's Ship " was the finest bit of work that ever went out of Cornwall . But Tarrant cherished a private grievance , and , as his view of art and ethics made it possible for him , from his standpoint , to criticise the picture unfavorably in some respects , he did so . It happened that he had recently finished a curious work for the Academy : a painting called " The Good Shepherd . " It represented a young laboring man with a face of rare beauty but little power , plodding homeward under setting sunlight . Upon his arm he bore a lamb , and behind his head the sinking sun made a glorious nimbus . Barron had seen this work , admired some of the painting , but bluntly sneered at the false sentiment and vulgar parade of religious conviction which , as he conceived , animated the whole . And now , the other man , in whose heart those contemptuous words still rankled , found his turn had come . He had bitterly resented Barron 's sarcastic reference to those holy things which guided his life ; there was something of feminine nature in him too ; so he did not much regret the present opportunity . " And you , Tarrant ? This gives you scant pleasure — eh ? " asked Barron . " It is very wonderful painting , but there 's nothing under the paint that I can see . " " Nothing but the canvas — in so far at least as the spectator is concerned . Every work of art must have a secret history only known to its creator . " " What the divil d'you mean , Paul ? " asked Brady . " You know what I mean well enough , " answered the first speaker coldly . " My views are not unfamiliar to any of you . Here is a thing without a soul — to me . " " God ! you say that ! You can look at those eyes and say that ? " " I admire the painting , but cui bono ? Who is the better , the wiser ? There is nothing under the paint . " " You are one of those who turn shadows into crosses , clouds into angels . Is it not so ? " asked Barron smiling ; and the other fired at this allusion to his best known picture . " I am one of those who know that Art is the handmaid of God , " he answered hotly . " I happen to believe in Jesus Christ , and I conceive that no picture is worthy to be called great or worthy of any Christian 's painting unless it possess some qualities calculated to ennoble the mind of those who see . Art is the noblest labor man can employ time upon . The thing comes from God ; it is a talent only to be employed in the highest sense when devoted to His glory . " " Then what of heathen art ? You let your religion distort your view of Nature . You sacrifice truth to a dogma . Nature has no ethics . You profess to paint facts and paint them wrong . You are not a mystic ; that we could understand and criticise accordingly . You try to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds . You talk about truth and paint things not true . " " From your standpoint possibly . Yours is the truth of naturalism ; mine is the truth of Faith . " " If you are going to entrench yourself behind Faith , I have done , of course . Only , do n't go about saying , as you did just now , that Art is the noblest labor man can employ time upon . That 's bosh , pure and simple . There are some occupations not so noble , that is all . Art is a heathen and always will be , and you missionary - men , with a paint - brush in one hand and a Bible in the other , are even worse than certain objectionable literary celebrities , whose novels reek of the '
58503	58726	58738	58738	Tarrant	182	' and the Sermon on the Mount — the ridiculous and sublime in tasteless combination . You missionaries , I say , sap the primitive strength of Art ; you demoralize her . To dare to make Art pander to a passing creed is vile — worse than the spectacle of the Salvation Army trying to convert Buddhists . That I saw in India , and laughed . But we wo n't quarrel . You paint Faith 's jewelry ; I 'll amuse myself with Truth 's drabs and duns . The point of view is all . I depict pretty Joan Tregenza looking over the sea to catch a glimpse of her sweetheart 's outward - bound ship . I paint her just as I saw her . There was no occasion to leave out or put in . I reveled in a mere brutal transcript of Nature . You would have set her down by one of the old Cornish crosses praying to Christ to guard her man . And round her you would have wrought a world of idle significance . You would have twisted dogma into the flowers and grass - blades . The fact that the girl happened to be practically brainless and a Luke Gospeler would not have weighed with you a moment . " " I 'm
58742	58887	58738	58738	Tarrant	182	're a naturalist and a materialist . That ends it . There is no possibility of argument between us . " " Would the man who painted that gorse ca nt ? " burst out Brady . " Damn it all , Tarrant , if a chap can teach us to paint , perhaps he can teach us something else as well . Look at that gorse , I tell you . That 's the truth , won with many a wrestle and heartache , I 'll swear . You know as well as I do what went to get that , and yet you say there 's nothing behind the paint . That 's ca nt , if you like . And as to your religious spirit , what 's the good of preaching sermons in paint if the paint 's false ? We 're

59378	59682	59374	59374	Brady	180	're going to say next that faulty concerns like this particular world are the work of minor intelligences . What rot you can talk at times , old man ! " " Yet is it an honor to God Almighty that we attribute the contents of this poor pill of a planet to Him ? I think it would be an insult if you ask me . Out of respect to the Everlasting , I would rather suppose that the earth , being by chance a concern too small for His present purposes , He tosses it , as we toss a dog a bone , to some ingenious archangel with a theory . Then you enjoy the spectacle of that seraph about as busy over this notable world as a child with a mud pie . The winged one sets to work with a will . A little pinch of life ; develops under his skillful manipulation ; evolution takes its remorseless course through the wastes of Time until — behold ! the apotheosis of the ape at last . Picture that well - meaning but muddle - headed archangel 's dismay at such a conclusion ! All his theories and conceits — his splendid scheme of evolution and the rest — end in a mean but obstinate creature with conscious intelligence and an absolute contempt and disregard for Nature . This poor Frankenstein of a cherub watches the worm he has produced defy him and refuse absolutely to obey his most fundamental postulates or accept his axioms . The fittest survive no more ; these gregarious , new - born things presently form themselves into a pestilential society , they breed rubbish , they — " " By God ! stop it , John , " said Murdoch . " Now you 're
60241	62526	60230	60230	She	1853	' The white martyrdom of self - denial , the red martyrdom of blood — each is a thousand times recorded in the history of painting and will be a thousand times again . " So John Barren set forth , well content to believe that he would never again visit Cornwall , and Joan called at the Penzance post - office on the morning which followed his departure . Her geographical knowledge was scanty . Truro and Plymouth , in her belief , lay somewhere upon the edge of the world ; and she scarcely imagined that London could be much more remote . But no letter awaited her , and life grew to be terribly empty . For a week she struggled with herself to keep from the post - office , and then , nothing doubting that her patience would now be well rewarded , Joan marched off with confidence for the treasure . But only a greater disappointment than the last resulted ; and she went home very sorrowful , building up explanations of the silence , finding excuses for " Mister Jan. " The prefix to his name , which had dropped during their latter intimacy , returned to her mind now the man was gone : as " Mister Jan " it was that she thought about him and prayed for him . The days passed quickly , and when a fortnight stood between herself and the last glimpse of her lover , Joan began to grow very anxious . She wept through long nights now , and her father , finding the girl changed , guessed she had a secret and told his wife to find it out . But it was some time before Thomasin made any discovery , for Joan lied stoutly by day and prayed to God to pardon by night . She strove hard to follow the teaching of the artist , to find joy in flowers and leaves , in the spring music of birds , in the color of the sea . But now she dimly guessed that it was love of him which went so far to make all things beautiful , that it was the magic and wisdom of his words which had gilded the world with gold and thrown new light upon the old familiar objects of life . Nature 's organ was dumb now that the hands which played upon it so skillfully had passed far away . But she was loyal to her teacher ; she remembered many things which he had said and tried hard to feel as he felt , to put her hand in beautiful Mother Nature 's and walk with her and be at peace . Mister Jan would soon return ; the fortnight was already past ; each day as she rose she felt he might come to claim her before the evening . And , meanwhile , other concerns occupied her thoughts . The voice which spoke to her after she bid John Barren " good - by , " had since then similarly sounded on the ear of her heart . Alike at high noon and in the silence of the night watches it addressed her ; and the mystery of it , taken with her other sorrows , began to affect her physically . For the first time in her life the girl felt ill in body . Her appetite failed , dawn found her sick and weary ; her glass told her of a white , unhappy face , of eyes that were lighted from within and shone with strange thoughts . She was always listening now — listening for the new voice , that she might hear the word it uttered . Her physical illness she hid with some cunning and put a bright face upon life as far as she could do so before those of her home ; but the task grew daily more difficult . Then , with a period of greatly increased discomfort , Joan grew alarmed and turned to the kind God of " Mister Jan , " and made great , tearful praying for a return of strength . Her petition was apparently granted , for the girl enjoyed some improvement of health and spirit . Whereupon she became fired with a notable thought , and determined to seek her patron saint where still she suspected his power held sway : at the little brook which tinkles along beside the ruins of St. Madron 's chapel in a fair coomb below the Cornish moorlands . The precious water , as Joan remembered , had brought strength and health to her when a baby ; and now the girl longed to try its virtues again , and a great conviction grew upon her that the ancient saint never forgot his own little ones . Opportunity presently offered , and through the first misty gray of a morning in early April , she set out upon her long tramp from Newlyn through Madron to the ruined baptistery . St. Madron , or Padern , lived in the sixth century , somewhat earlier than Augustine . A Breton by birth , he labored chiefly in Wales , established a monastery on Brito - Celtic lines in Cardiganshire , and became its bishop when a see was established in that district . He traveled far , visited Mount 's Bay and established the church of Madron , still sacred to his name , while doubtless the brook and chapel hard by were associated with him from the same period . In Scawen 's time folk were wo nt to take their hurts thither on Corpus Christi evening , drink of the water , deposit an offering , and repose upon the chapel floor till dawn . Then , drinking again , they departed whole , if faith sufficiently mighty had supported them . Norden remarks of the water that " its fame was great for the supposed vertue of healinge , which St. Maderne had thereunto infused ; and maine votaries made anuale pilgrimages unto it … . " In connection with the custom of immersion here indicated , we find there obtained the equally venerable practice of hanging votive rags upon the thorn bushes round about the chapel . This conceit is ancient as Japan , and one not only in usage to this day among the Shintoists of that land , but likewise common throughout Northern Asia and , nearer home , in the Orkneys , in Scotland , in Ireland . Older far than Christianity are these customs ; the megalithic monuments of the pagan witness similar practices in remote corners of the earth ; rag - trees , burdened with the tattered offerings of the devout , yet stud the desert of Suez , and those who seek shall surely find some holy well or grave hard at hand in every case . To mark and examine the junction of these venerable fancies with Christian superstition is no part of our present purpose , but that ideas , pagan in their birth , have lent themselves with sufficient readiness to successive creeds and been knit into the dogmas of each in turn , is certain enough . Thus , through Cornwall , the imaginings of wizard and wonder - worker in hoary time come , centuries later , to be the glory and special power of a saint . Such fantastic lore was definitely interdicted in King Edgar 's reign , when " stone worshipings , divinations , well worshipings and necromances " were proclaimed things heathen , and unhallowed ; but with the advent of the Saint - Bishops from Wales , from Ireland , from Brittany , primitive superstitions were patched upon the new creed , and , to suit private purposes , the old giants of the Christian faith sanctified holy well and holy stone , posing by right divine as sure dispensers of the hidden virtue in stream and granite . But the roots of these fables burrow back to paganism . Hundreds of weakly infants were passed through Mên - an - tol — the stone with a hole or the " crick - stone"—in the names of saints ; and hundreds had already been handed through it centuries before under like appeal to pagan deities . Of Madron baptistery , now a picturesque ruin , it seems clear that until the Reformation regular worship and the service of baptism were therein celebrated . The place has mercifully escaped all restoration or renovation and stands at this moment open to the sky in the slow hand of Time . A brook runs babbling outside , but the holy well or colymbethra is now dry , though it might easily be filled again . This interesting portion of the chapel remains intact , and the entrance to it lies upon the level of the floor according to ancient custom , being so ordered that the adult to undergo baptism might step down into the water , and that not without dignity . Hither came Joan . Her patchwork of faith and Nature - worship was a live thing to her now , and she found no difficulty in reconciling the sweet saint - stories heard in childhood from her dead mother 's lips , with the beautiful and fair exposition of truth which " Mister Jan " found written large upon the world by Nature in spring - time . It was half - past four o'clock when she trudged through Madron to see the gray church and the little gray houses all sleeping under the gray sky . She plodded on up the hill past the gaunt workhouse which stands at the top of it ; and what had seemed soft , sweet repose among the cottage homes , felt like cold death beneath these ashy walls . To Joan , the workhouse was a word of shame unutterable . Those among whom she lived would hurl the word against enemies as a prophecy of the utmost degradation . She shivered as she passed , and was sad , knowing that a whole world of poverty , failure , sorrow , regret , was hidden away in that cold , still pile . But the hand of sleep lay softly there ; only a sick soul or two stirred , the paupers were the equal of princes till a hoarse bell brought them back out of blessed unconsciousness . Bars of light streaked the east , and Joan , only stopping at the hill crest to see dawn open silver eyes on the sea , hastened inland through silent , dewy fields . Presently a fence and wall cut civilization from the wild land of the coomb , and the girl proceeded where grass - grown cart - ruts wound among furze and heather and the silver coils of new - born bracken just beginning to peep up above the dead fern of last year . This hollow ran between undulations of fallow and meadow ; no harrow clinked as yet ; only the cows stood here and there above the dry patches on the dewy fields where their bodies had lain in sleep . She saw their soft eyes and smelled the savor of them . Presently the cart - ruts disappeared in fine grass all bediamonded , knobbed with heather , sprouting rusty - red , and sprinkled with tussocks of coarser grass , whereon green blades sprang up above the dead ones , where they struggled , matted and bleached and sere . Rabbits flashed here and there , the white under - side of their little scuts twinkling through the gorse ; and then the birds woke up ; a thrush sang low , sleepy notes from the heart of a whitethorn ; yellowhammers piped their mournful calls from the furze . On Joan 's left hand there now rose a clump of wind - worn beech - trees , their brown spikes breaking to green , even where dead red leaves still clung to the parent branches . Beneath them ran a hedge of earth above a deep pool or two , very clear and fringed with young rushes , upright and triumphant above the old dead ones . Everywhere Joan saw Life trampling and leaping , growing and laughing over the ruins of things that had lived and died . It saddened her a little . Did Nature forget so soon ? Then she told herself that kind Nature had loved them and gloried in them too ; and now she would presently bury all her dead children in beautiful graves of new green . The mosses and marsh were lovely and the clear pools full of living creatures . But these things were not saint - blessed and eternal . No spring fed these silent wells , no holy man of old had ever smiled upon them . A stepping - stone by a wall lay before her now ; this she crossed , heard the stream murmuring peace , and hastened , and presently stood beside it . Here were holy ground and water ; here were peace and a place to pray in . Blue forget - me - nots looked wondering up , seeing eyes as blue as their own , and she smiled at them and drank of the ripples that ran at their roots . Gray through the growing haze of green , a ruined wall showed close to the girl . The blackthorns '

" Then she said the Lord 's Prayer , because her mother had taught her that no human petition was ever heard unless accompanied by it . And it seemed as though the lark , winding upward with wide spiral to his song - throne in the sky and tinkling thin music on the morning wind , was her messenger : which thought was beautiful to Joan and made her heart glad . Never had she looked fairer . Her blue eyes were misty , but the magic of prayer , the glory of speaking straight to the Father of all , call Him what she might , had nobly fortified her sinking spirit . Peace brooded in her soul then , and faith warmed her blood . She was sure her prayer would be answered ; she was certain that her health and her loved one would both come back to her . And she stood by the altar and smiled at the golden morning , herself the fairest thing the sun shone upon . Having peeped shyly about her , Joan took off her clothes , placed them on the altar - stones , shook down her hair , and glided softly to the stream . At one point its waters caught the sunshine and babbled over white sand between many budding spikes of wild parsley and young fronds of fern . Naked and beautiful the girl stood , her bright hair glinting to her waist , all rippled with the first red gold of the morning , her body very white save where the sun and western wind had browned both arms and neck ; her form innocent as yet of the mystery hid for her in Time . Joan 's fair limbs spoke of blood not Cornish , of days far past when a race of giants swept up from behind the North Sea to tread a new earth and take wives of the little dark women of the land , abating the still prevalent nigrescence of the Celt with Saxon eyes and hair , adding their stature and their strength to races unborn . A sweet embodiment of all that was lovely and pure and fresh , she looked — a human incarnation of youth and springtime . There was a pool deeper than the general shallowness of the stream which served for Joan 's bath , and she entered there , where soft white sand made pleasant footing for her toes , where more forget - me - nots twinkled their turquoise about the margin , where shining gorse towered like a sentinel above . She suffered the holy water to flow over every inch of her body , and then , rubbing her white self red and glowing with the dead brake fern of last year and squeezing the water out of her hair , Joan quickly dressed again and prepared to depart . She was about to leave a fragment torn from her skirt hanging by the chapel , but changed her mind , and getting a splinter of granite , rough - edged , she began to chip away a tress of her own bright hair , sawing it off upon the stone table as best she could . Like a fallen star it presently glimmered in the thorn bush above St. Madron 's altar where she wound the little lock , presently to bring gold to the nests and joy to the heart of small feathered folk . Joan walked home with the warm blood racing in her veins , roses on her cheeks and the glory of hope in her eyes . Already she felt her prayers were being heard ; already she was thanking God for heeding her cry , and St Madron for the life - giving waters of his holy stream . Thee , where finches chattered and fluttered forward , breakfasting together in pleasant company , a shadow and a swift , strong wing flashed across Joan 's sight — and a hawk struck . The little people shrieked , a few gray feathers puffed here and there , and one spark of life was blown out that other sparks might shine the brighter . For presently Joan 's kind " Mother o '

64664	64950	64662	64662	I	0	' e'd have it ! I knawed as the kind , good — " Then she stopped and grew red , while the clerk looked at her curiously and then yawned . " What 's a draggle - tailed chit like her got to do with such a thing ? " he wondered , and then spoke to Joan : " Here you are ; and you must sign this paper — it 's a registered letter . " Joan , her hand shaking with excitement , printed her name where he directed , thanked the man with a smile that softened him , and then hastened away . The girl was faint with hunger and happiness before she reached home . She did not dare to open the letter just then , but took it from her pocket a dozen times before she reached Newlyn and feasted her eyes on her own name , very beautifully and legibly printed . He had written it ! His precious hand had held the pen and formed each letter . Deep , wordless thanks welled up in Joan 's heart , for God was not very far away , after all . He had heard her prayer already , and answered it within an hour . No doubt it was easy for Him to grant such a little prayer . It could be nothing much to God that one small creature should enjoy such happiness ; but what seemed wonderful was that He should have any time to listen at all , that He should have been able to turn from the mighty business of the great awakening world and give a thought to her . " Sure '

65084	65857	65058	65058	he	0	' of tu long . So be quick 's you can . " But this sauce did not spoil the girl 's enjoyment of her porridge and treacle . She ate heartily , and her happy humor seemed catching , at least so far as Tom was concerned . A bright color warmed Joan 's cheek ; the cloud that had dimmed her eyes was there no longer ; and more than once Mr. Tregenza looked at his wife inquiringly , for the tale she had been telling of Joan 's recent moods and disorder was at variance with her present spirits and appetite . After breakfast she went to her room while her father waited ; and then it was that Joan snatched a moment to open John Barron 's letter . There would be no time to read it then , she knew : that delicious task must take many hours of loving labor ; but she wanted to count the pages and see " Mister Jan 's " name at the end . She knew that crosses meant kisses , too . There might be crosses somewhere . So she opened the envelope in a fever of joyous excitement , being careful , however , not to tear a letter of the superscription . And from it there came a fat , folded pile of tissue paper . Joan knew it was money , and flung it on her bed and fumbled with sinking heart for something better . But there was nothing else — only ten pieces of tissue - paper . She remembered seeing her father with similar pieces ; and her mother saying there was nothing like Bank of England notes . But they had been crumpled and dirty , these were snowy white . Each had a hundred pounds marked upon it ; and Joan was aware that ten times a hundred is a thousand . But a thousand pounds possessed no more real meaning for her than a million of money does for the average man . She could not estimate its significance in the least or gauge its possibilities . Only she knew that she would far rather have had a few words from " Mister Jan " than all the money in the world . Mr. Tregenza 's voice below broke in upon the girl 's disappointment , and , hastily hiding the money under some linen in a little chest of drawers , where the picture of Joe 's ship was also concealed , she hurried to join her father . But the empty envelope , with her name printed on it , she put into her pocket that it might be near her . Joan did not for an instant gather what meaning lay under this great gift of money , and to her the absence of a letter was no more than a passing sorrow . She read nothing between the lines of this silence ; she only saw that he had not forgotten , and only thought that he perhaps imagined such vast sums of money would give her pleasure and make the waiting easier . What were banknotes to Joan ? What was life to her away from him ? She sighed , and fell back upon the thought of his wisdom and knowledge . He must be in the right to delay , because he was always in the right . A letter would presently come to explain why he had sent the money and to treat of his return . The girl felt that she had much to thank God for , after all . He had sent her the letter ; He had answered her prayer in His own way . It ill became her , she thought , to question more deeply . She must wait and be patient , however hard the waiting . So thinking , she joined her father . Tom was away up the village , Mrs. Tregenza found plenty to occupy her mind and body indoors ; Joan and Mr. Tregenza had the garden to themselves . He was silent until they reached the wicket , then , going through it , he led the way slowly up a hill which wound above the neighboring stone quarry ; and as he walked he addressed Joan . She , weary enough already , prayed that her parent intended going no further than the summit of the hill ; but when he spoke she forgot physical fatigue , for his manner was short and stern .

" Here Gray Michael paused and turned homeward , while Joan congratulated herself upon the fact that a conversation which promised to be difficult had ended so speedily and without misfortune . Then her father asked her another question . " An '

66830	67501	66789	66789	E	1927	' . " Joan remembered her morning bath and felt comforted by this last reflection . Had she not already found the magic result ? For a moment she thought of telling her father what she had done , but she changed her mind . Such faith as that would have brought nothing but wrath upon her . While Mr. Tregenza improved the hour and uttered various precepts for his daughter 's help and guidance , Thomasin was occupied at home with grave thoughts respecting Joan . She more than suspected the truth from signs of indisposition full of meaning to a mother ; but while duly mentioning the girl 's illness , Mrs. Tregenza did not dare to breathe the color of her own explanation . She prayed to God in all honesty to prove her wrong , but her lynx eyes waited to read the truth she feared . If things were really so with Joan , then they could not be hid from her eyes much longer ; and in the event of her suspicions proving correct , Mrs. Tregenza told herself , as a right Luke Gospeler , she must proclaim her horrid discovery and let the perdition of her husband 's daughter be generally made manifest . She knew so many were called , so few chosen . No girl had ever been more surely called than Joan : her father 's trumpet tongue had thundered the ways of righteousness into her ears from her birth ; but , after all , it began to look as though she was not chosen . The circumstance , of course , if proved , would rob her of every Luke Gospeler 's regard . No weak pandering with sentiment and sin was permitted in that fold . And Mrs. Tregenza had little pity herself for unfortunate or mistaken women . Let a girl lose her character and Thomasin usually refused to hear any plea of mercy from any source . Only once did she find extenuating circumstances : in a case where a ruined farmer 's daughter brought an action for breach of promise and won it , with heavy damages . But money acted in a peculiar way with this woman . It put her conscience and her judgment out of focus , softened the outlines of events , furnished excuses for unusual practices , gilded with a bright lining even the blackest cloud of wrongdoing . Where Mrs. Tregenza could see money she could see light . Money made her charitable , broad - minded , even tolerant . She knew she loved it , and was careful to keep the fact out of Gray Michael 's sight as far as possible . She held the purse , and he felt that it was in good hands , but cautioned her from time to time against the awful danger of letting a lust for this world 's wealth come between the soul and God . And now a course long indicated in Thomasin 's mind was being by her pursued . Having convinced herself that under the present circumstances any step to found or dispel her fears concerning Joan would be just and proper , she took the exceptional one of searching the girl 's little room while her stepdaughter was out with Michael . Even as Mr. Tregenza turned to go homeward again , his wife stood in the midst of Joan 's small sanctuary , and cast keen , inquiring eyes about her . She rarely visited the apartment , and had not been in it for six months . Now she came to set doubt at rest if possible , or confirm it . Her own secret opinion was that Joan had come to serious trouble with her superiors . In that case letters , presents or tokens had probably passed into her hands ; and , if such existed , in this room they would be . " God send as I 'm
67503	67507	66789	66789	E	1927	' a mistake an '
67511	68686	66789	66789	E	1927	' tall , " said Mrs. Tregenza to herself . And then she began her scrutiny . Thomasin saw that all things about Joan 's room were neat , spotless , and in order . For one brief moment a sense of disquiet at the action before her touched the woman 's heart and head ; but duty alike to her husband and her stepdaughter demanded the search in her opinion . Should there be nothing to find , so much the better ; if , on the other hand , matters affecting Joan 's temporal and eternal welfare were here hidden , then they could not be uncovered too quickly . She looked first through the girl 's little wooden trunk , the key of which was in the lock , but nothing save a childish treasure or two rewarded Mrs. Tregenza here . In a broken desk , which had belonged to her mother , Joan kept a few Christmas cards , and two silhouettes : one of Uncle Thomas , of Drift , one of Mary Chirgwin . Here were also some cooking recipes copied in her mother 's writing , an agate marble which Joan had found on Penzance beach , lavender tied up in a bag , and an odd toy that softened Thomasin 's heart not a little as she picked it up and looked at it . The thing brought back to her memory a time four years earlier . It was a small , grotesque figure on wires , built up of chestnuts and acorns with a hazel - nut for its head and black pins stuck in for the eyes . She remembered Tom making it and giving it to Joan on her birthday . Then the memory of Joan 's love for Tom from the time he was born came like a glow of sunshine into the mother 's heart , and for a moment she was minded to relinquish her unpleasant task upon the spot ; but she changed her intention again and proceeded . The box held little else save a parcel of old clothes tied up with rosemary in brown paper . These the woman surveyed curiously , and knew , without being told , that they had belonged to Joan 's mother . For some reason the spectacle killed sentiment and changed her mood . She shut down the box , and then , going to the chest of drawers , pulled out each compartment in turn . Nothing but Joan 's apparel and her few brooches and trinkets appeared here . The history of each and all was familiar to Mrs. Tregenza . But on reaching the bottom drawer of the chest , she found it locked and the key absent . To continue her search , however , was not difficult . Nothing separated the drawers , and by removing that above the last , the contents of the lowest lay at her mercy , It was full of linen for the most part , but hidden at the bottom , Thomasin made a discovery , and found certain matters which at once spoke of tremendous mystery , and , to her mind , indicated the nature of it . First she came upon the little picture of Joe 's ship in its rough gilded frame . This might be an innocent gift from some of the young men who had asked in the past to be allowed to paint Joan and received a curt negative from Gray Michael . But the other discovery meant more . Pushing her hand about the drawer she found a pile of paper , felt the crackle of it , and pulled it eagerly to the light . Then , and before she learned the grandeur of the sum , she was seized with a sudden palpitation and sat down on Joan 's bed . Her mouth grew full as a hungry man 's before a feast , her lips were wet , her hand shook as she opened and spread the notes . Then she counted them and sat gasping like a landed fish . Thomasin had never seen so much money before in her life . A thousand pounds ! Unlike Joan , to whom the sum conveyed no significance , Mrs. Tregenza could estimate it . Her mind reached that far , and the bank - notes , for her , lay just within the estimation of avarice . Every snowy fragment meant a hundred pounds — a hundred sovereigns — two hundred ten - shilling pieces . The first shock overpast , and long before she grew sufficiently calm to associate the treasure with its possessor , Mrs. Tregenza began spending in her mind 's eye . The points in house and garden , outhouse and sty , whereon money might be advantageously expended , rose up one after the other . Then she put aside eight hundred and fifty out of the grand total and pictured herself taking it to the bank . She thought of a nest - egg that would " goody " against the time Tom should grow into a man ; she saw herself among the neighbors , pointed at , whispered of as a woman with hundreds and hundreds of pounds put by ; she saw the rows of men sitting basking about in Newlyn , as their custom is when off the sea ; and she heard them drop words of admiration at the sight of her . Presently , however , this gilded vision vanished , and she began to connect the money with Joan . She solved the mystery then with a brutal directness which hit the mark in one direction ; as to the source of the money , but went wide of it in some measure upon the subject of the girl . Thomasin held briefly that her stepdaughter had fallen , and now , knowing her condition , had informed some man of it , with the result that from him came this unutterable gift . That the money made an enormous difference to Mrs. Tregenza 's mental attitude must be confessed . She found herself fashioning absolute excuses for Joan . Girls so often came to ill through no fault of their own . The man must at least have been a gentleman to pay for his pleasure in four figures . Four figures ! Here she stopped thinking in order to picture the vision of a unit followed by three ciphers . Then she marveled as to what manner of man he was who could send a girl like Joan a thousand pounds . She never heard of such a price for the value received . Her respect for Joan began to increase when she realized that the money was hers . Probably there was even more where that came from . " Anyway , " she reflected , " it ban't no use cryin '
68698	68707	66789	66789	E	1927	' a thousand pounds'll go long ways to softenin '
68723	68731	68711	68711	She	1930	' bide quiet theer till arter , an '

68844	69245	68758	68758	she	1930	'em ! " But her imagination centered upon Gray Michael now , and she almost forgot the banknotes for a moment . She thought of his agony and trembled for the result . He might strike Joan down and kill her . The man 's anger against evil - doers was always a terrific thing ; and he had no idea of the value of money . She hazarded guesses at the course he would pursue , and each idea was blacker than the last . Then Thomasin fell to wondering what Michael would be likely to do with the money . She sighed at this thought , and then she grew pale at the imaginary spectacle of her husband tearing the devil - sent notes to pieces and scattering them over the cliff to the sea . This horrible possibility stung her to another train of ideas . Might it be within her power to win Joan 's secret , share it , and keep it from the father ? Her pluck , however , gave way when she looked a little deeper into the future . She would have done most things in her power for a thousand pounds , but she would not have dared any treachery to Michael . The woman put the notes together and stroked them and listened to the rustle of them and rubbed her hard cheek with them . Then , looking from the little window of Joan 's garret , she saw the girl herself approaching with Mr. Tregenza . They were nearly home again , so Thomasin returned the money and the picture to their places in the chest of drawers , smoothed the bed , where she had been sitting for half an hour , and went downstairs still undetermined as to a course of action . Before dinner was eaten , however , she had decided that her husband must know the truth . Even her desire toward the money cooled before the prospect of treachery to him . Fear had something to do with this decision , but the woman 's own principles were strong . It is unlikely that in any case they would have broken down . She sent Joan on an errand to the village after the meal was ended ; and upon her departure addressed her husband hurriedly . " You said I was '
69251	69262	69265	69265	Michael	204	' so I was . I 've gotten bad news for '
69268	69276	69332	69332	she	756	' Joan . " " No more o '

69443	69550	69554	69554	she	1941	' , wummon ! " he said . " God knaws I wishes it weer so , " she answered , and went once more to Joan 's room . Gray Michael was walking up and down the kitchen when she returned , and Thomasin said nothing , but put money and picture upon the table . Her husband fought with himself a moment , as it appeared , then seemed to pray a while , standing still with his hand pressed over his eyes , and finally sat himself down beside the things which Thomasin had brought . " I 'd no choice but to tell '
69575	69594	69554	69554	she	1941	' tis Joe Noy 's ship . Us seed her off the islands , outward bound ! He might '

He was sitting back in his chair with a face that had grown gray even to the skin , with eyes that looked out at nothing . There was a moment 's silence save for the tall clock in the corner ; then Tregenza brushed beads of water off his forehead and dried his hand on his trousers . He raised his eyes to the roof and gripped his hands together on his chest and slowly spoke a text which his wife had heard upon his lips before , but only at times of deep concern or emotion . " '

He judged the dead mother by the daughter and visited the child 's sin upon the parent 's memory . Any conclusion more monstrous , more directly opposed to every natural instinct , can hardly be conceived , but the man had been strangling natural instincts for fifty years . Only pride of family remained . There were but few Tregenzas left and soon there would be none unless Tom carried on the name . Michael was the quintessence of the Tregenza spirit , the fruit of generations , the high - water mark . He stood on that giddy pinnacle which has religious mania for its precipice . To damn a dead woman was easier than to accept a wanton daughter . Better an unfaithful wife than that any soul born of Tregenza blood should be lost . So he washed his hands of both , thanking God , who had launched the truth into his mind at last ; and then he rose to his feet as Joan entered the room . She stood for a moment in the doorway with her blue eyes fixed in amazement upon the kitchen table . Then she grew very red to the roots of her hair and came forward . There was almost a joy in her mind that the long story of falsehood must end at last . She did not fear her father now and looked up into his face quite calmly as she approached the table . " These be mine , " she said . " Was it you , faither , as took 'em
71223	71236	71237	71237	I	0	' Twas me , Joan , " answered Mrs. Tregenza ; " an '

" Michael , Michael ! " cried his wife , rushing forward , " for God 's love , what be doin' of ? The money ban't damned ; the money 's honest ! " But Joan did more than speak . As the gift flamed quickly up , then sunk to gray ash , a tempest of passion carried her out of herself . She trembled in her limbs , grew deadly pale , and flew at her father like a tigress . No evil word had ever crossed her lips till then , though they had echoed in her ears often enough . But now they jumped to her tongue , and she cursed Gray Michael and tore the rest of the money out of his hand so quickly that his intention of burning it was frustrated . " It 's mine , it 's mine , blast you ! " she screamed like a fury , " what right have you to steal it ? It 's mine — gived me by wan whose shoe you ban't worthy to latch ! He 's shawed me what you be , an '

Having now firmly convinced herself that her condition would bring him gratification and draw them still nearer each to the other , Joan yearned unutterably for his presence . She puzzled her brains to know how she might communicate with him , how hasten his return . She remembered that he had once told her his surname , but she could not recollect it now . He had always been " Mister Jan " to her . She went down to her supper in the course of the evening , and the great matter in her mind was for a while put aside before a present necessity . Action , she found , would be immediately required of her . Her father , before going from the kitchen after she had fainted , directed Thomasin to bid her never see his face again . She must depart , according to his direction , on the following day ; for the thatched cottage upon the cliff could be her home no more . " Theer weern't no time for talkin '

" Joan went to bed abruptly on this remark , and lay awake thinking and wondering through a long night — thinking what she should say to Uncle Chirgwin , wondering when " Mister Jan " was coming back to her , and picturing his excitement at her intelligence . In the morning she packed her box , ate her breakfast , and then went into the village to find somebody who would carry her scanty luggage as far as Penzance . From there , an omnibus ran through Drift , past Mr. Chirgwin 's farmhouse door . Joan herself designed to walk , the distance by road from Newlyn being but trifling . It chanced that the girl met Billy Jago , he who in early spring had cut down an elm tree while John Barron watched . Him Joan knew , for he had worked on her uncle 's farm for many years . Mr. Jago , who could be relied upon to do simple offices , undertook the task readily enough and presently arrived with a wheelbarrow . He whined , as ever , about his physical sufferings , but drank a cup of tea with evident enjoyment , then fetched Joan 's box from her room and set off with it to meet the public vehicle . Her goods were to be left at Drift , and Joan herself started at an early hour , wishing to be at the farm before her property . She walked in the garden for the last time , marked the magic progress of spring , then took an unemotional leave of her stepmother . " There '
73985	74042	74071	74071	he	2033	' no call to leave no message as I can see , " said Joan , while she stood at the door . " He ban't my faither , he sez , so I 'll take it for truth . But I 'll ask you to kiss Tom for me . Us was allus good brother an '
74050	74067	74071	74071	he	2033	' I loves en dearly . " " Iss , I knaw . He 'll grizzle an '

74133	74140	74128	74128	you	2036	' God A'mighty to forgive me , 'cause

74184	76058	74128	74128	you	2036	' e. Maybe us'll see each other bimebye . " Joan held out her hand and Mrs. Tregenza shook it . Then she stood and watched her stepdaughter walk away into Newlyn . The day was cold and unpleasant , with high winds and driving mists . The village looked grayer than usual ; the boats were nearly all away ; the gulls fluttered in the harbor making their eternal music . Seaward , white horses flecked the leaden water ; a steamer hooted hoarsely , looming large under the low , sullen sky , as it came between the pierheads . Presently a scat of heavy rain on a squall of wind shut out the harbor for a time . Mrs. Tregenza waited until Joan had disappeared , then went back to her kitchen , closed the door , sat in Gray Michael 's great chair by the hearth , put her apron over her head and wept . But the exact reason for her tears she could not have explained , for she did not know it . Mingled emotions possessed her . Disappointment had something to do with this present grief ; sorrow for Joan was also responsible for it in a measure . That the girl should have asked her to kiss Tom was good , Thomasin thought , and the reflection moved her to further tears ; while that Joan was going to put her money into the keeping of a simple old fool like Uncle Chirgwin seemed a highly pathetic circumstance to Mrs. Tregenza . Indeed , the more she speculated upon it the sadder it appeared . Meanwhile Joan , leaving Newlyn and turning inland along the little lane which has St. Peter 's church and the Newlyn brook upon its right , escaped the wind and found herself walking through an emerald woodland world all wrapped in haze and rain . Past the smelting works , where purple smoke made wonderful color in rising against the young green , over the brook and under the avenue of great elms went Joan . Her heart ached this morning , and she thought of yesterday . It seemed as though a hundred years of experience had passed over her since she knelt by St. Madron 's stone altar . She told herself bitterly how much wiser she was to - day , and , so thinking strange thoughts , tramped forward over Buryas Bridge , and faced the winding hill beyond . Then came doubts . Perhaps after all St. Madron had answered her prayer . Else why the underlying joy that now fringed her sorrows with happiness ? Drift is a place well named , when seen , as then , gray through sad - colored curtains of rain on the bare hilltop . But the orchard lands of the coomb below were fair , and many primroses twinkled in the soaking green of the tall hedge - banks . Joan splashed along through the mud , and presently a lump rose in her throat , born of thoughts . It had seemed nothing to leave the nest on the cliff , and she held her head high and thanked God for a great deliverance . That was less than an hour ago ; yet here , on the last hill to Drift and within sight of the stone houses clustering at the summit , her head sank lower and lower , and it was not the rain which dimmed her eyes . She much doubted the value of further prayers now , yet every frantic hope and aspiration found its vent in a petition to her new God , as Joan mounted the hill . She prayed , because she could think of no other way to soothe her heart ; but her mind was very weary and sad — not at the spectacle of the future , for that she knew was going to be fair enough — but at the vision of the past , at the years ended forever , at the early pages of life closed and locked , to be opened again no more . A childhood , mostly quite happy , was over ; she would probably visit the house wherein she was born never again . But even in her sorrow , the girl wondered why she should be sad . Mr. Chirgwin 's farm fronted the highway , and its gray stone face was separated therefrom by a small and neat patch of garden . Below the house a gate opened into the farmyard , and Uncle Chirgwin 's land chiefly sloped away into the coomb behind , though certain fields upon the opposite side of the highroad also pertained to him . The farmhouse was time - stained , and the stone had taken some wealth of color where black and golden lichens fretted it . The slates of the roof shone with wet and reflected a streak of white light that now broke the clouds near the hidden sun . The drippings from the eaves had made a neat row of little regular holes among the crocuses in the garden . Tall jonquils also bent their heads there , heavy with water , and the white violets which stood in patches upon either side of the front door had each a raindrop glimmering within its cup . A japonica splashed one gray wall with crimson blossoms and young green leaves ; but , for the rest , this house - front was quite bare . Joan saw Mary Chirgwin 's neat hand in the snowy short blinds which crossed the upper windows ; and she knew that the geraniums behind the diamond panes of the parlor were her uncle 's care . They dwelt indoors , winter and summer , and their lanky , straggling limbs shut out much light . The visitor did not go to the front door , whither a narrow path , flanked with handsome masses of " Cornish diamonds , " or quartz crystals , directly led from the wicket , but entered at a larger gate which led into the farmyard . Here cattle - byres and shippons ranged snugly on three sides of an open space , their venerable slates yellow with lichens , their thatches green with moss . In the center of the yard a great manure heap made comfortable lying for pigs and poultry ; while the farmhouse stretched back upon the fourth side . Another gate opened beyond it , and led to the land upon the sloping hill and in the valley below . Joan passed a row of cream pans , shining like frosted silver in the mist , then turned from the bleak and dripping world . The kitchen door was open , and revealed a large , low chamber whose rafters were studded with orange - colored hams , whose fireplace was vast and black save for a small wood fire filling but a quarter of the hearth . Grocer 's almanacs brought brave color to the walls , sharing the same with a big dresser where the china made a play of reflected light from the windows . Above the lofty mantel - piece there hung an old fowling - piece , and a row of faded Daguerreotypes , into most of which damp had eaten dull yellow patches . The mantel - shelf carried some rough stoneware ornaments , an eight - day clock , a tobacco jar , and divers small utensils of polished tin . A big table covered with American cloth filled the center of the kitchen , a low settle crossed the alcove of the window , and a leather screen , of four folds and five feet high , surrounded Uncle Chirgwin 's own roomy armchair in the chimney - corner . Strips of cocoanut fiber lay upon the ground , but between them appeared the bare floor . It was paved with blue stone for the most part , though here and there a square of white broke the color ; and the white patches had worn lower than the rest under many generations of hobnailed boots . A faint odor of hams was in the air , and the slight , stuffy smell of feathers . A woman sat in the window as Joan entered . She had her back to the door , and not hearing the footfall , went on with her work , which was the plucking of a fowl . A cloth lay spread over the floor at her feet , and each moment the pile of feathers upon it increased as the plucker worked with rhythmic regularity and sang to herself the while . Mary Chirgwin was a dark , good - looking girl , with a face in which strong character appeared too prominently shadowed to leave room for absolute beauty . But her features were regular if swarthy ; her eyes were splendid , and her brow , from which black hair was smoothly and plainly parted away , rose broad and low . There was nothing to mark kinship between the cousins save that both held their heads finely and possessed something of the same distinction of carriage . Mary was eight - and - twenty , and , whatever might be thought about her face , there could be but one opinion upon her feminine splendor of figure . Her broad chest produced a strange speaking and singing voice — mellow as Joan 's , but far deeper in the notes . Mary gloried in congregational melodies , and those who had not before heard her efforts at church on Sundays would often mistake her voice for a man 's . She was dressed in print with a big apron overall ; and her sleeves , turned up to her elbows , showed a pair of fine arms , perfect as to shape , but brown of color as the woman 's face . Joan stood motionless , then her cousin looked round suddenly and started almost out of her chair at a sight so unexpected . But she composed herself again instantly , put down the semi - naked fowl and came forward . They had not seen each other since the time when Joe Noy flung over Mary for Joan ; and the latter , remembering this circumstance very well , had hoped she might escape from meeting her cousin until after some talk with Uncle Thomas . But Mary hid her emotion from Joan 's sight , and they shook hands and looked into one another 's faces , each noting marked changes there since the last occasion of their meeting . The elder spoke first , and went straight to the past . It was her nature to have every connection and concern of life upon a definite and clear understanding . She hated mystery , she disliked things hidden , she never allowed the relations between herself and any living being to stand otherwise than absolutely defined . " You'm come , Joan , at last , though '

76410	77026	77027	77027	e	2042	' tis right . " " A box ! Whatever is there in it , Joan ? " " All 's I 've gotten in the world — leastways nearly . Doan't ax me nothin' now . You 'll knaw as soon as need be . " Without waiting for more words Joan departed , hastened through the gate on the inner wall of the farmyard and walked along the steep hillside by a lane which wound muddily downward to the grasslands , under high hazel hedges . The new leaves dripped showers at every gust of the wind , then a gleam of wan sunlight brightened distant vistas of the way , while Joan heard the patter of a hundred hoofs in the mud , the bleat of lambs , the deeper answer of ewes , the barking of a shepherd 's dog . Soon the cavalcade came into view — a flock of sheep first , a black and white dog with a black and white pup , which was learning his business , next , and Uncle Chirgwin himself bringing up the rear . The first sunshine of the day seemed to have found him out . It shone over his round red face and twinkled in the dew on his white whiskers . He stumped along upon short , gaitered legs , but went not fast , and stayed at the steep shoulder of the hill that his lambs might have rest and time to suck . Mary Chirgwin meantime speculated on this sudden mystery of her cousin 's arrival . She spread the cloth for dinner , bid her maid lay another place for Joan and wondered much what manner of news she brought . There were changes in Joan 's face since she saw it last — not changes which might have been attributed to the possession of Joe Noy , but an alteration of expression betokening thought , a look of increased age , of experiences not wholly happy in their nature . And Joan had also marked the changes in Mary . These indications were clear enough and filled her with sorrow . A river of tears will leave its bed marked upon a woman 's face ; and Joan , who had never thought overmuch of her cousin 's sorrows until then , began to feel her heart fill and run over with sudden sympathy . She asked herself what life would look like for her if " Mister Jan " ; changed his mind now and never came back again . That was how Mary felt doubtless when Joe Noy left her . Already Joan grew zealous in thought for Mary . She would teach her something of that sweet wisdom which was to support her own burden in the future ; she would tell her about Nature — the " All - Mother " as " Mister Jan " called her once . And , concerning Joe Noy — might it be within the bounds of possibility , within the power of time to bring these two together again ? The thought was good to Joan , and wholly occupied her mind until the sight of Uncle Chirgwin with his sheep brought her back to the present moment and her own affairs . When Mr. Chirgwin caught sight of Joan his astonishment knew no bounds , and his first thought was that something must certainly be amiss . He stood in the roadway , a picture of surprise , and , for a moment , forgot both his sheep and lambs . " My stars , Joan ! Be it you really ? Whatever do '
77032	77061	77027	77027	e	2042	' pon such a day as this ? No evil news , I hope ? " " Uncle , " she answered , " go slow a bit an '
77089	77105	77086	77086	you	2043	'cause your sister was my mother ? " " Surely , surely , Joan ; an '

77672	77760	77764	77764	she	2068	' no faither nor mother but her . " The old man was snuffling , and a tear or two rolled down his red face , gathered the damp already there and fell . He groaned to himself , then brought forth a big , red pocket - handkerchief , and wept outright , while Joan stood silently regarding him . " I 'd rather a met death than this ; I 'd rather a knawn you was coffined . " " Oh , if I could awnly '
77777	77795	77797	77797	them	2070	' pon my tongue , but I caan't . They be hid down deep in me , an '

77904	77973	77900	77900	I	0	' that 's bitterness to me . " He took her by the hand and pressed it , then put his arm round her and kissed her . His white bristles hurt , but Joan rejoiced exceedingly , and now it was her turn to shed tears . " He 'll come back — he'm a true man , " she sobbed ; " theer ban't the likes o '
77980	78006	78007	78007	he	241	' if you knawed en , you 'd say no less . You'm the fust as have got to my heart since he went ; an '
78010	78047	77900	77900	I	0	' e if he knawed . " " Come along with me , Joan , " answered Uncle Chirgwin , straightening himself and applying his big handkerchief to her face . " God send the man'll be '

78169	78679	78680	78680	Joan	183	'bout en . " He tried hard to put a hopeful face upon the position and , himself as simple as a child , presently found Joan 's story not hopeless at all . He seemed indeed to catch some of her spirit as she proceeded and painted the manifold glories of " Mister Jan " in the best language at her command . To love Nature was no sin ; Mr. Chirgwin himself did so ; and as for the money , instead of reading the truth of it , he told himself very wisely that the giver of a sum so tremendous must at least be in earnest . The amount astounded him . Fired by Joan 's words , for as he played the ready listener her eloquence increased , he fell to thinking as she thought , and even speaking hopefully . The old farmer 's reflections merely echoed his own simple trust in men and had best not been uttered , for they raised Joan 's spirits to a futile height . But he caught the contagion from her and spoke with sanguine words of the future , and even prayed Joan that , if wealth and a noble position awaited her , she would endeavor to brighten the lives of the poor as became a good Cornish woman . This she solemnly promised , and they built castles in the air : two children together . His sheep driven to their new pasture , Uncle Chirgwin led the way home and listened as he walked to Joan 's story . She quite convinced him before he reached his kitchen door — partly because he was very well content to be convinced , partly because he could honestly imagine no man base enough to betray this particular blue - eyed child . Mr. Chirgwin 's extremely unworldly review of the position was balm to Joan . Her heart grew warm again , and the old man 's philosophy brightened her face , as the sun , now making a great clearness after rain , brightened the face of the land . But the recollection of Mary Chirgwin sobered her uncle not a little . How she would take this tremendous intelligence he failed to guess remotely . Opportunity to impart it occurred sooner than he expected , for Joan 's box had just arrived . During dinner the old man explained that his niece was to be a visitor at Drift for a term of uncertain duration ; and after the meal , when Joan disappeared to unpack her box and make tidy a little apple - room , which was now empty and at her service , Uncle Chirgwin had speech with Mary . He braced himself to the trying task , waited until the kitchen was empty of those among his servants who ate at his table , and then replied to the question which his niece promptly put . " What do this mean , Uncle Thomas ? What 's come o '
78686	78693	78699	78699	she	183	' pon us like this here wi '
78702	78725	78731	78731	you	2075	' ? " " Polly , " he answered , " your cousin Joan have seen sore trouble , in a manner o '
78727	78730	78731	78731	you	2075	' , an '
78746	78764	78765	78765	him	2077	'bout a thing like this She'm tokened to a gen'leman from Lunnon . " " What ! An '
78776	78787	78765	78765	him	2077	' you , Polly , she've thrawed en over . Listen '
78792	78797	78789	78789	you	2075	' Twas a match o '

78898	78977	78978	78978	he	2077	' e means the right thing . " But the woman 's mind had not followed these last facts . Her face was white to the lips ; her hands were shaking . She put her head down upon them as she sat by the fire , and a groan which no power could strangle broke from her deep bosom . She spoke , and regretted her words a moment later . " Oh , my God ! an '
78982	78988	78995	78995	theer	2079	' me for the likes o '

79221	79601	79219	79219	He	0	' preach no sermon at the time neither . " The old man prattled on , setting out the position in the most favorable light to Joan that seemed possible to him . But his listener was one no longer . She had forgotten her cousin and the present circumstances , for her thoughts were with a sailor at sea . One tremendous moment of savage joy gripped her heart , but the primitive passion perished in its birth - pang and left her cold and faint and ashamed . She wondered from what unknown , unsecured corner of her soul the vile thing came . It died on the instant , but the corpse fouled her thoughts and tainted them and made her feel faint again . The irony of chance burst like a storm on the woman , and mazes of tangled thoughts made her brain whirl in a chaos of bewilderment . She sat motionless , her face dark , and much mystery in her wonderful eyes , while Mr. Chirgwin , with shaking head and scriptural quotation and tears , babbled on , pleading for Joan with all his strength . Mary heard little of what he said . She was occupied with facts and asking herself her duty . From the storm in her mind arose a clear question at last , and she could not answer it . The point had appeared unimportant to anybody but Mary Chirgwin , but no question of conduct ever looked trivial to her . At least the doubt was definite and afforded mental occupation . She wondered now whether it was well or possible that she and Joan could live together under the same roof . Why such a problem had arisen she knew not ; but it stood in the path , a fact to be dealt with . Her heart told her that Joan and her uncle alike erred in the supposition that the girl 's seducer would ever return . She read the great gift of money as Thomasin had read it — rightly ; and the thought of living with Joan was at first horrible to her . Mr. Chirgwin talked and Mary reflected . Then she rose to leave the room . " '
79653	79658	79644	79644	he	1153	' Tis the thot o '

80132	80374	80422	80422	she	2095	' sactly — even a holy man like him . " She saw at once that it was not . Her custom had been to get the kind - hearted old clergyman of her parish church to soothe the doubts and perplexities which not seldom rose within her strenuous mind . And before this great , crushing problem , with the pretext of the one difficulty which had tumbled uppermost from the chaos and so been grasped as a reality , she had naturally turned to her guide and friend . But , as her uncle spoke , she saw that in truth this matter could not be laid naked before any man . Another 's hidden life was involved ; another 's secret must come out if all was told , and Mary 's sense of justice warned her that this could not be . She had taken her own mighty grief to the little parsonage at Sancreed , and a kindly counselor , who knew sorrow at first hand , helped her upon the road that henceforth looked so lonely and so long ; but this present trial , though it tore the old wounds open , must be borne alone . She saw as much , and turned and went upstairs again to her chamber . " Think of her kindly , " said Uncle Chirgwin as Mary left him without more words . " She'm so young an '
80377	80385	80422	80422	she	2095	' the gert world , Polly . An '

82218	82412	82418	82418	he	2148	'cause Mister Jan did say as Nature never lies — never . " So the child 's thoughts wandered on a day when she sat upon the bough and brought a shower of pale petals down with every movement . But as yet only the shadows of shadows clouded her thoughts when she thought about herself . It was the loneliness brought real care — the loneliness and the waiting . She spent time , too , in Uncle Chirgwin 's old walled garden . This place and its products went for little in the traffic of the farm , though every year its owner was wo nt to count upon certain few baskets of choice fruit as an addition to his income , and every year his hopes were blighted . For the walls whereon his peaches and nectarines grew had stood through generations , their red brick work was much fretted by time , and the interstices between the bricks made snug homes for a variety of insects . Joan once listened to her uncle upon this subject , and henceforth chose to make his scanty fruit her special care . " '

First they peeped like pearls from the dried frills of their blossoms ; then they expanded and cast off the encumbrance of dead petals and nestled against the red bricks that sucked up sunshine and held it for them when the sun had gone . She found the garden wall was a whole busy world , and , taught by her vanished master , she took interest in all that dwelt thereon .

She was quite positive that her cousin and her uncle were alike mistaken ; but she saw that , until the hard truth forced itself upon Joan , the girl would go her present way . It was not that Joan lacked goodness and sweetness , but , in Mary 's opinion , she took an obstinate and wrong - headed course upon the one vital subject of her own salvation . Mary fought with herself to love Joan , and the battle now was only hard when Joe Noy came within the scope of her thoughts . She banished him as much as she could , but it never grew easy , and the complex problems bred of reflections on this theme maddened her . For she had always loved him , and that affection , thrust away as deadly - sin , when he left her for another , could not be wholly strangled now . Time hung heavily and more heavily with Joan at Drift . A fortnight passed ; but the hope of the ignorant and trustful dies very hard and the faith which is bred of absolute love has a hundred lives . The girl walked into Penzance every second day , and hope blazed brightly on the road to the post - office , then sank a little deeper into the hidden places of her heart as she plodded empty - handed back to Drift . Slowly , and so gradually that she herself knew it not , her thoughts grew something less occupied with John Barren , something more concerned about herself . For the world was full of happy mothers now . One " Brindle"—a knot - cow of repute — dropped a fine bull - calf in a croft hard by the orchard , and Joan looked into " Brindle 's " solemn eyes after the event , and learned . She marveled to see the little brown calf stand on his shaking legs within an hour of his birth ; then his mother licked him lovingly , while Uncle Chirgwin himself drew off her " buzzy milk . " There was another mother in a disused pigsty . There Joan found a red and white tortoise - shell cat with four blind , squeaking atoms beside her , and as the cat rolled over and the atoms sucked life , Joan saw her shining eyes , afore - time so bright and hard , full of a new strange light , like the cloud that glimmers over the fires of an opal . The cat 's green orbs were full of mystery : of pain past , of joy present . So again Joan learned . But a black tragedy blotted out that little happy family in the pigsty , and Death , in the shape of Amos Bartlett , Mr. Chirgwin 's head man , fell upon them . Then the farmer learned that his niece could be angry . One morning Joan found the mother cat running wildly here and there , with a world of misery in its cry ; while a moment afterward she came upon the kittens in a duck pond . Mr. Bartlett was present and explained . " Them chets had to gaw , missy . '
83644	83657	83697	83697	she	2167	' it ban't wise to take no count of sayings like that . '
83664	83670	83697	83697	she	2167	' You 've heard tell o '
83729	83809	83697	83697	she	2167	' her heart , poor twoad ! " Mr. Bartlett was justly angry that Joan could dare to thus class his priceless red - headed twins with a litter of dead kittens , and he said more than was wise , ramming home a truth , and that coarsely . " Theer 's plenty more wheer them comed from , I lay . Nachur 's so free , you see — tu free like sometimes . Ban't no dearth o '

" Joan flung down a little bouquet of starry stitchworts she had gathered upon the way and turned very earnestly to Tom . " You be , you be a Nature 's cheel . Us all be , but awnly a few knaws it . " Tom laughed at this idea mightily . " Well , I 'll slip back long , Joan ; an '

" So Tom marched off , speculating as to what particular lie would best meet the case if cross - questioning awaited him on his return , and Joan watched the thickset little figure very lovingly until it was out of sight . June came . The wall - flowers were long plucked or dead , the last snows of apple - blossom had vanished away , and the fruit was setting well . The woodlice were already ruining the young nectarines . " They spiles 'em

Then Tom informed Uncle Chirgwin that his cart with a full load of oar - weed was waiting at the door . Whereupon the old man got his hat , loaded his pipe , wished Thomasin good - by , and drove sorrowfully away . Mrs. Tregenza had secretly inquired after Joan 's health and wealth . That the first was excellent , the second carefully put away in the lawyer 's hands , caused her satisfaction . She told Mr. Chirgwin to make Joan write out a will . " You never knaws , " she said . " God keep the gal , but they do die now an '
87049	87057	86913	86913	you	2246	' Tweer better she wrote about the money '

87194	87331	87153	87153	he	2250	' pon her — eh ? " Uncle Chirgwin promised that he would do so , and Mrs. Tregenza felt a weight off her mind which had distressed it for some while . She was thinking of Tom , of course . She knew that Joan loved him , and though the prospect of his ever coming by a penny of the money appeared slender , yet to think that he might be in a will , named for hundreds of pounds , was a shadowy sort of joy to her . That night Joan 's uncle told the girl of his afternoon 's work , and she expressed some sorrow that he should have thus exerted himself on her behalf . " Faither 's dirt beside the likes of you , " she said . " '

It was even in her mind to pray , to pray with her whole heart and soul ; but chaos had settled like a storm upon her beliefs . She did not know where to pray to now ; yet to - day Hope once more glimmered like a lighthouse lamp through the dreary darkness . So she turned her eyes to that radiance and waited for next Saturday to come . Then she set about grubbing up roots of hemp agrimony where they grew . She was almost happy and whistled gently to herself as she filled her little basket . That night Edmund Murdoch heard his cousin 's story and explained that " Mister Jan " was doubtless John Barron . " I 'm

Never a word of shotguns in all this drivel , of course . Cruelty and selfishness ! Qualities purely and solely human — qualities resulting from conscious intelligence alone . You and I are selfish , not the ape ; you and I are cruel , not the tiger . He at least learns Nature 's lessons and obeys her dictates ; we never do and never shall . A plague upon these fools with their theologic rubbish heaps . They would prostitute the very fonts of reason and make Nature 's eternal circle fit the little squares of their own faiths . Man ! I tell you that the root of human misery might be pulled out and destroyed to - morrow like the fang of a decayed tooth if only reason could kill these weeds of falsehood which choke civilization and strangle religion . But the world 's '

92223	92388	92041	92042	One genius	2407	' ( or pretend to it ) ; the world 's thinkers are mere shadows moving about in the background of active affairs . They only write and talk . Action is the sole way of chaining a nation 's mind . " Your churchman is active enough , hence the spread of that poison which keeps human reason stunted , impotent , anaemic . Take Liberty — the cursed ignis fatuus our dear poets have shrieked for , our preachers have prayed for , our patriots have perished for through all time . In pursuit of this rainbow - gold more blood and brains have been wasted than would have sufficed to make a nation . And yet a breath from Reason blows the thing to tatters , as an uprising wind annihilates a fog . Freedom is an attribute of the Eternal , and creation can not share it with him , any more than it can share his throne with him . '
92394	93008	92041	92042	One genius	2407	' ! A contradiction in terms . Banish this unutterable folly of freedom , and control the breeding of human flesh as we control the output of beef and of mutton . Then the face of the world will alter . Millions of money is annually spent in order that mindless humanity , congenital lunatics and madmen , may be fed and housed and kept alive . Their existences are to themselves less pleasurable than that of the beasts , they are a source of agony to those who have borne them ; but they live to old age and devour tons of good food , while wholesome intellects starve in the gutters of every big city . Banish this ca nt of freedom then , I tell you . The lightning in heaven is not free ; the stars are not free ; Nature herself is the created slave of the Great Will — and we prattle about liberty . Let the State look to it and practice these lessons Nature has taught and still preaches patiently to deaf ears . Let it be as penal to bring life into the world without permission from authority as it is to put life out of the world . Let the begetting of paupers be a crime ; let the health and happiness of the community rise higher than the satisfaction of individuals ; let the self - denial practiced by the reasonable few be made a legal necessity to the unreasonable many . Let the blighted , the malformed , the brainless go back to the earth from which they came . Let the world of humanity be cleansed and sweetened and purified as Nature cleanses and sweetens and purifies her own kingdom . She removes her failures ; we put ours under glass and treat them like hothouse flowers . That is called humanity ; it is the mad leading the mad … . But why waste your time ? Nature will have the last word ; Reason must win in the end ; a genius , at once thinker and doer , will come along some day and put the world right , at a happy moment when the din of theologists is out of its ears . We want a new practical religion ; for Christianity , distorted and twisted through the centuries into its present outworn , effete , ignoble shape , is a mere political force or a money - making machine , according to the genius of the country which professes it . The golden key of the founder , which is lost , may be found again , but I think it never will be . " [ Here the man elaborated his opinions . They were like himself : a medley — a farrago — wherein ascerbity , acuteness , and a mind naturally philosophic were stranded in the arid deserts of a pessimism bred partly from his own decaying physical circumstances and partly from recognition of his own wasted time . ] " I do not suppose that I shall paint any more . I had my Cornish picture brought from its packing - case and framed , and supported on a great easel at the foot of my bed while I was stricken down last month . Mistress Joan eyed me curiously from under her hand , and through the night - watches , while my man snored in the next chamber and I tossed with great unrest , the girl seemed to live and move and smile at me under the flicker of the night lamp . Everybody is pleased to say that '
93012	93239	93248	93249	JOHN BARRON	176	' seems good to them . I have it now in the studio , and contrasted it yesterday with my bathing negresses from Tobago . I think I like it better . It is difficult to read the soul in black faces , especially when the models are freezing to death as mine were . But there is something near to soul in this painted Joan — more I doubt than the living reality would be found to possess to - day . She was a good girl all the same , and I am gratified to hear she did not quite forget me . I have written to her at the address you mention . They pester me to send the picture somewhere , and to stop their importunities — especially the women — I have promised to let the thing go to the Institute in the autumn . I shall doubtless change my mind before the time comes . " My life slowly but surely dwindles to that mere battle with Death which your consumptive wages at the finish . I fancy Biskra will see my bones later in the year . The R.A. took not less than six months off my waning days this spring . Thank God they hung Brady as he deserved . Twenty good works I saw—'the rest is silence . '
93480	94276	93479	93479	I	0	'm dying . Yes , she shall close my eyes some day , if she likes . That 's a pleasant thought — for me . " So the letter to Murdoch was sent forth , but the letter to Joan , containing some poetic thoughts on Nature , a pathetic description of Barron 's enfeebled state , and an appeal to her to join him that they might part no more on this side the grave , was torn up . He laughed at the trouble he had taken to print it all , and pondered pleasantly on the picture which Murdoch had drawn of Joan ruling the kingdom of the meadowsweets , of her eager question concerning " Mister Jan. " " Strange , " he reflected , " that her mediocre intelligence should have clung to a man so outwardly mean as myself . If I thought that she had remembered half I said when I was with her , or had made a single attempt to practice the gospel I preached so finely — damned if I would n't have her back again to - morrow and be proud of her too . But it ca n't be . She was such an absolute fool . No , I much fear she only desires to find out what has become of the goose who laid the big golden egg . Or if she does n't , perhaps her God - fearing father and mother do . " Which opinion is not uninteresting , for it illustrates the usual failure of materialism to discover or gauge those mental possibilities which lie hidden within the humblest and worst equipped intelligences . John Barron was an able man in some respects , but his knowledge of Joan Tregenza had taught him nothing concerning her character and its latent powers of development . With summer , Nature , proceeding on her busy way , approached again the annual phenomena of seed - time and harvest . To Joan , as spring had brought with it a world of mothers , so the subsequent season filled Nature with babies ; and , in the light of all this newborn life , the mothers suffered a change . Now , sorrow - guided , did Joan begin to read under the face of things , " to get behind the sunset , " as Barren had said in his letter to Murdoch , to realize a little of the mystery hidden in green leaves and swelling fruits and ripening grain , to observe at least the presence of mystery though she could not translate more than an occasional manifestation thereof . She found much matter for wonder and for fear . Visible Nature had grown to be a smiling curtain behind which raged eternal struggles for life . Every leaf sheltered a tragedy , every bough was a battlefield . The awful frailty of all existence began to dawn upon Joan Tregenza , and the discovery left her helpless , lonely , longing for new gods . She knew not where to turn . Any brightness from any source had been welcome then . Disenchantment came with the second visit of the artist to the stream . There ; young Murdoch had met her and told her that " Mister Jan " was going to write her a letter . Upon which she had sung glad songs in a sunlit world and amazed Mary and Uncle Chirgwin alike by the exhibition of a sudden and profound happiness . But that longed - for letter never came ; weeks passed by ; the truth rolled up over her life at last ; and , as a world seen in a blaze of sunshine only dazzles us and conceals its facts under too much light , but reveals the same clear cut and distinct at dawn or early twilight , so now Joan 's eyes , obscured no more by the blinding promise of great joy , began to see her world as it was , her future as it would be . Strange thoughts came to her on an evening when she stood by the door of the kitchen at Drift , waiting for the cart to return from market . It was a cool , gray gloaming , wreathed in diaphanous mists born of past ram . These rendered every outline of tree and building vague and immense . Where Joan stood , the peace of the time was broken only by a gentle dripping from the leaves of a great laurel by the gate which led from the farmyard to the fields . Below it , moist ground was stamped with the trident impress of many fowls '

She drained the teapot into Joan 's cup , and then , from a bright mood for her , relapsed into cold silence . Uncle Chirgwin , however , prattled on about the concert until his elder niece finished her tea and went to bed . Then he put down his pipe , took a long pull at his drink , and began to talk hurriedly to Joan . " I bin an '

" Joan smiled at his enthusiasm on her behalf , then kissed him and went to bed ; while he , mixing up his prayers , his last pipe , and his final glass of spirits according to his custom , sat the fire out while he drank deeper and prayed harder than usual in the light of his triumph . " Polly couldn '
98004	98015	97843	97843	you	2508	' godliness , " he murmured to himself , " yet '
98027	98042	98043	98044	the Lard	200	' I have . I 've led her slap - bang into the hand o '
98047	98774	98043	98044	the Lard	200	' the rest be His business . No man 's done a better day 's work inside Cornwall to - day than what I have — that 's sure ! " Since her visit to the church at Newlyn , Joan had been in no place of worship save the chapel of the Luke Gospelers . What might be the nature of the service before her she did not know , nor did she care . But the girl kept her promise and drove in the market - cart to Sancreed with her uncle and cousin when Sunday came . The little church lay bowered in its grove of sycamores , and , around it , a golden - green concourse of quivering shadows cooled those who had walked or driven from Drift — an outlying portion of the parish — approached through lanes innocent of all shade . Mr. Chirgwin put up the horse and presently joined his nieces in church . Then Joan saw him under interesting and novel conditions . He wore glasses with gold rims ; he covered his bald head with a little velvet cap ; at the appointed time he took a wooden plate and carried it round for money . Mary found the old man 's places for him and sang in a way that fairly astounded Joan . The enormous satisfaction brought to herself by these vocal efforts was apparent . Her soul appeared mightily lifted up . She amused chance visitors to the church , but the regular congregation liked to hear Mary ; and Joan , seeing the comfort her cousin sucked from singing , wished she had heart to join . That , however , she wholly lacked . Moreover , the words were strange to her . The quiet service , brightened by music , dragged its slow length murmuringly along . The sermon , delivered by a visitor , was not of a sort to hold Joan , and , indeed , could hardly be expected to attract many in such a congregation . The preacher had lately been reading old Cornish history , and , overcome by the startling fact that the far west of England — Cornwall and Devon — were Christian long before Augustine saw Kent , dwelt upon the matter after a very instructive fashion in ears unlikely to benefit from such knowledge . That the Cornu - British bishops preached Christ while yet Sussex , Wessex , Hampshire , Berks and other districts worshiped Woden , Freya , the Queen of Heaven , the Thunder God , and other deities whose altars were set up after the Conquest , did not interest Joan for one or Mr. Chirgwin for another . But the girl woke up at the mention of Irish and Welsh and Breton saints . Pleasant to hear was the utterance of names which she had loved once but of late almost forgotten . They came back now , and , the service having turned her heart to softness , she welcomed them gladly as friends returned from afar . For the rest , the Litany it was which roused Joan to deepest interest and opened her mind to new impressions . Here was a prayer , gigantic in length , universal , all - embracing , catholic beyond the compass of anything her thoughts had heretofore conceived . From the Queen upon her throne to Joan herself , from the bishops , the princes and the Lords of the Council to Uncle Chirgwin and his fruits of the earth , that astounding petition ranged with equal vigor and earnestness . Nothing was too high , nothing was too low for it ; all the world was named , and the people cried for a hearing or for mercy between each supplication and each prayer . The overwhelming majesty of such praying impressed Joan much ; as , indeed , it impresses all who come adult thereto and do not associate it with their childhood , with weary hours dragging interminably out , with sleepy buzz of voices , with sore knees or a breaking back , with yearnings stifled , with devices for passing time , with the longed - for sunshine stealing inch by inch eastward on the church walls . " A power o '
98776	98806	98043	98044	the Lard	200	' in a small headpiece , " commented Uncle Chirgwin as he drove home with the girls sitting side by side on his left . " A braave ch'ice o '

98873	98885	98829	98830	a furriner	3700	' tis very well to listen to it as chance offers . '

98971	99215	98951	98951	she	2516	' lost . " After dinner , when Mary had gone to see a friend and the farm people were dawdling abroad till evening milking - time , Joan made her uncle read the service through again . This he did comfortably between the whiffs of his pipe , and Joan answered the responses , cooing them in her sweet voice as softly as the red and blue pigeons crooned on the roof outside . Drift was asleep under a hot blaze of afternoon sunshine . Sometimes a child 's keen voice in the road cut the drowsy silence and came to Joan 's ears where she sat , in the best parlor with Uncle Thomas ; sometimes slow wheels rumbled up the hill toward Buryan . Other sounds there were none . The old people slept within their cottages after the extra baked meats of Sunday 's dinner ; many of the young paired and walked where pathways ran over meadows and through yellowing wheat ; while others , more gregarious and unattached , had tramped away to Penzance to join the parade by the sea and meet their friends from the shops . Anon nailed boots stamped up the little pathway to Drift farmhouse , and Tom Tregenza appeared . To - day he entered fearlessly , for he came upon an errand from his father . He kissed Joan and shook hands with Uncle Thomas . Then he said : " '

The latter had regaled himself with a peep at " auld bull , " heard the terrific snorting of his nostrils and observed how he bellowed mightily at durance on such an afternoon . Tea being finished , the boy started homeward with a basket of fresh eggs and butter , a pound of cream and some early apples of a sort used for cider , but yet equal to the making of a pie . " As for the butter , '
100064	100105	100131	100131	Tom	199	' , " said Mary , " but you 'd best not to tell your faither that , else , so like 's not , he 'll pitch it into the sea . If us could send en a pound o '

" So Tom marched off , and Mary , returning to the house , heard of Joan 's letter . The old gusts of misery , sorrow , indignation , rose in her heart again then , but faintly , like the dying flutter of winds that have blown themselves out . She tried to find a way of bringing comfort to her cousin , but failed . Joan had retired and refused consolation . The glory of splendid summer hours passed away ; the long twilight sank to darkness ; the opal lights in the west at last died under the silver of the moon . And then , like a child weary with crying , Joan slept , while Mary , creeping a third time to see and speak with her , departed silently . But she did not sleep ; and her wakefulness was fortunate , for long after eleven o'clock came a noisy summons at the outer door . Looking from her room which faced the front of the house , the woman saw Tom with his full basket standing clearly defined below . The world of the weald and woods shimmered silvery in dew and moonlight . Infinite silence reigned . Then the boy 's small , indignant voice broke it . " You 'll have to let me in , I reckon . Blamed if I doan't think you was right 'bout
100542	100554	100596	100597	nothin' differ'nt	2540	' how be Joan ? " she began . " Wisht an '

Michael Tregenza was standing by the table . Upon it appeared the basket from Drift , stored with cream , butter , eggs and apples . Thomasin sat in the low chair by the fire with her apron over her face , and that was always a bad sign , as Tom knew . " What day be this , bwoy ? " began Michael . " The Lard 's , faither . " " Ay : the Lard 's awn day , though you 've forgot it seemin'ly . " " No I abbun , faither . " " Doan't '

101248	101254	101162	101163	Uncle Chirgwin	251	' . " " This marnin '

101319	101437	101448	101449	the boy	3680	' faither . " Tom departed , the lighter for his basket . He flung a stone at a hare , listened to the jarring of a night - hawk , and finally returned home about one o'clock . Both his parents were awaiting him , and the boy saw that his mother had been enduring some trouble on his behalf . " Mind , my son , hencefarrard that the Sabbath is the Lard thy God 's . You may have done others a good turn besides yourself this night . " " What did they say , Tom ? " asked his mother . " They was n't best pleased . They said a hard sayin '
101473	103106	101448	101449	the boy	3680	' , mind , the bwoat at the steps by half - past five to - morrer . " " Ay , ay , faither . " Then Tom vanished , his parents went to their rest , and the cottage on the cliff slept within the music of the sea , its thatch all silver - bright under a summer moon . To the superficial eye dead hopes leave ugly traces ; viewed more inquiringly the cryptic significance of them appears ; and that is often beautiful . Joan 's soul looked out of her blue eyes now . Seen thoughtfully her beauty was refined and exalted to an exquisite perfection ; but the unintelligent observer had simply pronounced her pale and thin . The event which first promised to destroy the new - spun gossamers of a religious faith and break them even on the day of their creation , in reality acted otherwise . For Joan , Joe 's letter was like a window opening upon a hopeless dawn ; and her helplessness before this spectacle of the future threw the girl upon religion — not as a sure rock in the storm of her life , but as a straw to the hand of the drowning . The world had nothing else left in it for her . She , to whom sunshine and happiness were the breath of life , she who had envied butterflies their joyous being , now stood before a future all uphill and gray , lonely and loveless . As yet but the dawn of affection for the unborn child lightened her mind . Thought upon that subject went hand in hand with fear of pain . And now , in her dark hours , Joan happily did not turn to feed upon her own heart , but fled from it . For distraction she read the four Gospels feverishly day by day , and she prayed long to the Lord of them by night . Mary helped her in an earnest , cheerless fashion , and before her cousin 's solicitude , Joan 's eyes opened to another thought : the old friendship between Mary and Joe Noy . It had wakened once , on her first arrival at Drift , then slept again till now . She was troubled to see the other woman 's indifference , and she formed plans to bring these two together again . The act of getting away from herself and thinking for others brought some comfort to her heart and seemed to rise indirectly out of her reading . The Christianity of Drift was old - fashioned , and reflected the Founder . No distractions rose between Joan and the story . She took it at first hand , escaping thus from those petty follies and fooleries which blight and fog the real issues today . She sucked her new faith pure . A noble rule of conduct lay before her ; she dimly discerned something of its force ; and unselfishness appeared in her , proving that she had read aright . As for the dogma , she opened her arms to that very readily because it was beautiful and promised so much . Faith 's votaries never turn critical eyes upon the foundations of her gorgeous fabric ; their sight is fixed aloft on the rainbow towers and pinnacles , upon the golden fanes . And yet this man - born structure of theology , with aisles and pillars fretting and crumbling under the hand of reason , needs such eternal propping , restoring and repairing , that priestly tinkers , masons , hod - carriers are solely occupied with it . They grapple and fight for the poor shadows of dogma by which they live , and , so engaged , the spirit and substance of religion is by them altogether lost . None of the Christian churches will ever be overcrowded with men who possess brain - power worthy the name . Mediocrity and ignorance may starve , but talent and any new nostrum to strangle reason and keep the rot from the fabric will always open their coffers . Joan truly found the dogma more grateful and comforting than anything else within her experience , and the apparition of a flesh and blood God , who had saved her with His own life 's blood before she was born , appeared too beautiful and sufficing to be less than true . Her eyes , shut so long , seemed opening at last . With errors that really signify nothing , she drew to herself great truths that matter much and are vital to all elevated conduct . She thought of other people and looked at them as one wakened from sleep . And , similarly , she looked at Nature . Even her vanished lover had not taught her all . There were truths below the formulae of his worship ; there were secrets deeper than his intellectual plummet had ever sounded . Without understanding it , Joan yet knew that a change had come to pass in material things . Sunshine on the deep sea hid more matters for wonder than John Barron had taught or known . Once only as yet had she caught a glimpse of Nature 's beating heart ; and that was upon the occasion of her visit to St. Madron 's chapel . She was lifted up then for a magic hour ; but the lurid end of that day looked clearer afterward than ever the dewy dawn of it . Nature had smiled mutely and dumbly at her sufferings for long months since then . But now added knowledge certainly grew , and from a matrix mightier than the love of Nature or of man , was Joan 's new life born . It embraced a new sight , new senses , ambitions , fears and hopes . Joan went to church at every opportunity . Faith seemed so easy , and soon so necessary . Secret prayer became a real thing to be approached with joy . To own to sins was as satisfactory as casting down a heavy burden at a journey 's end ; to confess them to God was to know that they were forgiven . There were not many clouds in her religious sky . As Mary 's religion was bounded by her own capabilities and set forth against a background of gloom , which never absolutely vanished save in moments of rare exaltation , so Joan 's newfound faith took upon itself an aspect of sunshine . Her clouds were made beautiful by the new light ; they did not darken it . Mary 's gray Cornish mind kept sentiment out of sight . She lived with clear eyes always focusing reality as it appeared to her . Heaven was indeed a pleasanter eternal fact than hell ; yet the place of torment existed on Bible authority ; and it was idle to suppose it existed for nothing . Grasping eternity as a truth , she occupied herself in strenuous preparation ; which preparation took the form of good works and personal self - denial . Joan belonged to an order of emotional creatures widely different . She loved the beautiful for its own sake , kept her face to the sun when it shone , shivered and shut up like a scarlet pimpernel if bad weather was abroad . And now a chastened sunshine , daily growing stronger , shot through the present clouds , painted beauty on their fringes , and lighted the darkness of their recesses so that even the secrets of suffering were fitfully revealed . Joan grasped at new thoughts , the outcome of her new road . Nature presently seemed of a nobler face , and certain immemorial achievements of man also flashed out in the side - light of the new convictions ; as objects , themselves inconsiderable , will suddenly develop unsuspected splendors from change of standpoint in the beholder . The magic of that Christianity , which Joan now received directly from her Bible , wrought and embroidered a new significance into many things . And it worked upon none as upon the old crosses , some perfect still , some ruined as to arm or shaft , some quite worn out and gnawed by time from their original semblance . These dotted her native land . Them she had always loved , but now they appeared marvelously transfigured , and the soul hid in their granite beamed through it . Supposing the true menhirs to be but ruined crosses also , Joan shed on them no scantier affection than upon the less venerable Brito - Celtic records of Christianity . Bid so to do , and prompted also by her inclination , the girl was wo nt to take walks of some length for her health 's sake ; and these had an object now . As her dead mother 's legends came back to her memory and knit Nature to her new Saviour , so the weather - beaten stones brought Him likewise nearer , marked the goal of precious daily pilgrimages , and filled a sad young life with friends . Returning from a visit to Tremathick cross , where it stands upon a little mound on the St. Just road , Joan heard a thin and well - known voice before she saw the speaker . It was Mrs. Tregenza , who had walked over to drink tea and satisfy herself on sundry points respecting her stepdaughter . " Oh , my Guy Faux , Polly ! " she said upon arriving , " I 'm
103125	103130	103116	103116	I	0	' wo n't fetch home '

" The man must face sorrer same as what us all have got to , Mrs. Tregenza . Some gets more , some gets less , as the sparks fly up'ard . Joe Noy 's got religion tu . " Mary spoke the last words with some bitterness , which she noted too late and set against herself for a sin . " Oh , my dear sawl , " said Mrs. Tregenza , looking round nervously , as though she feared the shadow of her husband might be listening . " Luke Gosp'ling 's a mighty uncomfortable business , though I lay Tregenza'd most kill me if he heard the word . '

" Joan entered at this point in the conversation and betrayed some slight emotion as her stepmother kissed her . It was nearly five months since they had met , and Mary now departed , leaving them to discuss Joan 's physical condition . " I be doin' clever , " said Joan , " never felt righter in body . " Mrs. Tregenza poured forth good advice , and after a lengthy conversation came to a secret ambition and broached it with caution . " I called to mind some baaby 's things — shoes , clouts , frocks an '

104781	106804	104699	104699	she	201	' to be ate . " Presently Mrs. Tregenza drove away and Joan went to her room to think . Magic effects had risen from the spectacle of the well - remembered face , from the sound of the sharp , high voice . A new sensation grew out of them for Joan . Home rose like a vision , with the sighing of the sea , the crying of the gulls , the musical rattle of blocks in the bay , the clink , clink of picks in the quarry , the occasional thunder of a blast . Many odors were with her : the smell of tar and twine and stores , the scent of drying fish . She saw the low cliffs all gemmed at this season with moon - flowers — the great white convolvulus which twinkled there . A red and purple fuchsia in the garden , had blossomed also . She could see the bees climbing into its drooping bells . She remembered their music , as it murmured drowsily from dead and gone summers , and sounded sweeter than the song of the bees at Drift . She heard the tinkle of a stream outside the cottage , where it ran under the hedge through a shute and emptied itself into a great half - barrel ; and then , turning her thoughts to the house , her own attic , with the view of St. Michael 's Mount and the bay , rose in thought , with every detail distinct , even to the glass scent - bottle on the mantel - piece , and the colored print of John Wesley being rescued in his childhood from a burning house . These and kindred memories made a live picture to Joan 's eyes . For the first time since she had left her home the girl found in her heart a desire to return to it . She awoke next morning with the old recollections increased and multiplied ; and the sensation bred from continued contemplation was the sensation of a loss . The significance of the ancient crosses in Joan Tregenza 's latest phase of mental growth becomes much finer after learning somewhat more concerning them than she could ever know . The ephemeral life of one unhappy woman viewed from these granite records of Brito - Celtic pagan and Christian faith , examined in its relation to these hoary splinters of stone , grows an object of some pathetic interest . Such memorials of the past as are here indicated , vary mightily in age . The Christian monuments are not older than the fifth century , but many have been proved palimpsests and rise on pagan foundations dating from a time far more ancient than their own . The relics are divided into two classes by antiquarians : Pillar Stones and Sculptured Crosses . The former occur throughout the Celtic divisions of Great Britain , and are sometimes marked with the Chi Rho monogram , or early rude cross form . In most cases these earlier erections indicated a grave , while the sculptured crosses either denoted boundaries of sanctuary , or were raised promiscuously where men and women passed or congregated , their object being to encourage devotion and lead human thoughts heavenward . The designs on these monuments are usually a bad imitation of Irish key patterns and spirals ; but many , in addition , show crucifixes in their midst , with pre - Norman figures depicting the Christ in a loose tunic or shirt , his head erect and his body alive , after the Byzantine fashion . The mediaeval mode of carving a corpse on the cross is of much later date and may not be observed before the twelfth century . More than three hundred of these sculptured crosses have been discovered within the confines of Cornwall . In churchyards and churchyard walls they stand ; they have even been discovered wrought into the fabric of the churches themselves ; the brown moor likewise knows them , for they stud its wildernesses and rise at the crossways of many lonely roads ; while elsewhere , villages hold them in their hearts , and the emblem rises daily before the sight of generation upon generation . In hedges they are also to be seen , and in fields ; many have been rescued from base uses ; and all have stood through the centuries as the sign and testimony of primitive Cornish faith , even as St. Piran 's white cross on a black ground , the first banner of Cornwall , bore aloft the same symbol in days when the present emblem , with its fifteen bezants and its motto , " One and All , " was not dimly dreamed of . These ancient crosses now rose like gray sentinels on the gray life of Joan Tregenza . At Drift she was happily placed among them , and many , not necessary to separately name , lay within the limit of her daily wanderings , and her superstitious nature , working with the new - born faith , wove precious mystery into them . Much she loved the more remote and lonely stones , for beside them , hidden from the world 's eye , she could pray . Those others about which circled human lives attracted her less frequently . To her the crosses were sentient creatures above the fret of Time , eternally watching human affairs . The dawn of art as shown in early religious sculpture generally amuses an ignorant mind , but , to Joan , the little shirted figures of her new Saviour , which opened blind eyes on the stones she loved , were matter for sorrow rather than amusement . They did by no means repel her , despite the superficial hideousness of them ; indeed , with a sort of intuition , Joan told herself that human hands had fashioned them somewhere in the dawn of the world when yet her Lord 's blood was newly shed , at a time before men had learned skill to make beautiful things . Once , beside the foot of the cross which stood in Sancreed [ Footnote : This fine sculptured cross has since these events been placed within the said churchyard , at the desire of Mr. A. G. Langdon , the greatest living authority on the subject of Cornish remains . ] churchyard wall , between two tree - trunks under a dome of leaves , the girl found growing a spotted persicaria , and the force of the discovery at such a spot was great to her . Familiar with the legend of the purple mark on every leaf of the plant , nothing doubting that it had aforetime grown at the foot of the true cross and there been splashed with the blood of her Master , Joan accepted the old story that henceforth the weed was granted this proud livery and badge of blood . And now , finding it here , the fable revived with added truth and conviction , the legend of the persicaria was as true to her as that other of the Lord 's resurrection from death . Thus her views of Nature suffered some approach to debasement in a new direction , but this degradation , so to call it , brought mighty comfort to her soul , daily rounded the ragged edges of life , woke merciful trust and belief in a promised life of bliss beyond the grave , and embroidered thereupon a patchwork , not unbeautiful , built of fairy folk - lore , saintly legend and venerable myth . Her credulous nature accepted right and left ; anything that harbored a promise or was lovely or wonderful in itself found acceptance ; and Joan read into the very pulses of the summer world the truth as she now understood it . Cornwall suddenly became a new Holy Land to the girl . Here the circumstances of life chimed with those recorded in the New Testament , and it was an easy mental achievement to transplant her Saviour from a historical environment into her own . She pictured Him as walking amid Uncle Chirgwin 's ripening corn ; she saw Him place His hands on the heads of the little children at cottage doors ; she imagined Him standing upon one of the stranded luggers in Newlyn harbor with the gulls floating round His head and the fishermen listening to his utterance . The growing mother instincts in Joan also developed about this season . They leaped from comparative quiescence into activity ; they may indeed be recorded as having arisen within her after a manner not less sudden than had the new faith itself , which was exhibited to you as blossoming with an abruptness almost violent , because it thus occurred . Now most channels of thought led Joan to her unborn infant , and there came at length an occasion upon which she prayed for the first time that her child might be justified in its existence . The petition was raised where , in the past , she had uttered one widely different : at the altar - stone in the ruined baptistery of Saint Madron . Thither on a day in early August , Joan traveled by short cuts over fields which brought the chapel within reach of Drift . The scene had changed from that of her former visit , and summer was keeping the promises of spring . Yellow stars of biting stone - crop covered the walls of the ruin ; the fruit of the blackthorn was growing purple , of the hawthorn , red ; the lesser dodder crept , like pink lacework , over furze and heather ; bright - eyed euphrasy and sweet wild thyme were murmured over by many bees ; at the altar 's foot grew brake fern and towering foxgloves ; while upon the sacred stone itself brambles laid their fruit , a few ripe blackberries shining from clusters of red and green . Seeding grasses and docks likewise nourished within the little chapel , and ragged robins and dandelions brought the best beauty they had . Among which matters , hid in loneliness , to the sound of that hymn of life which rises in a whisper from all earth at summer noon , Joan prayed for her baby that it might not be born in vain . Among the varied ambitions now manifested by Joan was one already hinted at — one which increased to the displacement of smaller interests : she much desired to see again her home , if but for the space of an hour . The days and weeks of an unusually smiling summer brought autumn , and with it the cutting of golden grain ; but the bustle and custom of harvest failed to draw Joan among her kind . Human life faded somewhat , even to the verge of unreality with her . Silence fell upon her , and a gravity of demeanor which was new to the beholders . Uncle Chirgwin and Mary were alike puzzled at this sign , and , misunderstanding the nature of the change , feared that the girl 's spiritual development must be meeting unseen opposition . Whims and moods were proper to her condition , so the farmer maintained ; but the fancy of eternally sequestering herself , the conceit of regarding as friends those ancient stones of the moor and crossroads , was beyond his power to appreciate . To Mary such conduct presented even greater elements of mystery . Yet the fact faced them , and the crosses came in time to be one of the few subjects which Joan cared to talk upon . Even then it was to her uncle alone she opened her heart concerning them : Mary never unlocked the inner nature of her cousin . " I got names o '

" Uncle Chirgwin 's old market - cart , with the gray horse and the squeaking wheel , rattled off to Newlyn some two hours later , and the ordeal , longed for at a distance , towered tremendous and less beautiful at nearer approach . When they started , Joan had hoped that her father might be at home ; as they neared Newlyn she felt a growing relief in the reflection that his presence ashore was exceedingly improbable . Her anxieties were forgotten for a few moments at sight of the well - known outlines of the hills above the village . Now arrish - mows — little thatched stacks some eight feet high — glimmered in the pale gilded stubbles of the fields ; the orchards gleamed with promise ; the foliage of the elms was at its darkest before the golden dawn of autumn . Well - remembered sights rose on Joan 's misty eyes with the music proper to them ; then came the smell of the sea and the jolting of the cart , going slowly over rough stones . Narrow , steep streets and sharp corners had to be traversed not only with caution but at a speed which easily placed Joan within the focus of many glances . Troubles and humiliation of a sort wholly unexpected burst suddenly upon her , bringing the girl 's mind rudely back from dreams born of the familiar scene . Newlyn women bobbed about their cottage doors with hum and stir , and every gossip 's mouth was full of news at this entry . Doors and windows filled with curious heads and bright eyes ; there was some laughter in the air ; fishermen got up with sidelong looks from the old masts or low walls whereon , during hours of leisure , they sat in rows and smoked . Joan , all aflame , prayed Uncle Chirgwin to hasten , which he did to the best of his power ; but their progress was of necessity slow , and local curiosity enjoyed full scope and play . Tears came to the girl 's eyes long before the village was traversed ; then , through a mist of them , she saw a hand stretched to meet her own and heard a voice which rang kindly on her ears . It was Sally Trevennick , who faced the spiteful laughter without flinching and said a few loud , friendly words , though indeed her well - meant support brought scant comfort with it for the victim . " Lard sakes ! Joan , doan't '

108711	108975	108978	108978	he	2633	' a good righteous man . " Joan 's thoughts meanwhile were mainly concerned with her surroundings , and when she had walked thrice about the garden , visited the pigs , peeped into the tool - house to smell the paint and twine , noted the ripening plums and a promising little crop of beets coming on in the field beyond , she went indoors . There a pair of Michael 's tall sea - boots stood in the chimney corner , with a small pair of Tom 's beside them ; the old , well - remembered crockery shone from the dresser ; geraniums and begonias filled the window ; on a basket at the right of the fireside stood a small blue plate with gold lettering upon it and a picture of Saltash Bridge in the middle . The legend ran — A present for a good girl . It was a gift from her father to Joan , on her tenth birthday . She picked it up , polished it , and asked for a piece of paper to wrap it in , designing to carry the trifle away with her . Every old nook and corner had been visited by the time that Uncle Chirgwin returned . Then all sat down to eat and drink , and the taste of the tea went still further to quicken Joan 's memory . Mrs. Tregenza gave them such information as suggested itself to her during the progress of the meal . She was chiefly concerned about her son . " Cruel '
108982	108990	108978	108978	he	2633	' nough , " she murmured . " '

109149	109184	109187	109187	he	2641	' so all 's said . " Uncle Chirgwin went to smoke a pipe and water his horse at this juncture ; but he returned within less than ten minutes . " It 's blowin '

She explained that she now wished to depart without seeing her father if possible . It was , however , too late to escape the meeting . Even as the twain bade Mrs. Tregenza a hasty farewell , heavy feet sounded on the cobbles at the cottage door and a moment later Tregenza entered . His oilskins were wet and shiny ; half a dozen herrings , threaded through the gills on a string , hung from his right hand . Michael Tregenza instantly observed Joan where she sat by the window , and , seeing her , stood still . The fish fell from his hand and dropped slithering in a heap on the stone floor . There was a silence so great that all could hear a patter of drops from the fisherman 's oilskins as the water rolled to the ground . At the same moment gusts of rising wind shook the casement and bleared the glass in it with rain . Joan , as she rose and stood near Mr. Chirgwin , heard her heart thump and felt the blood leap . Then she nerved herself , came a little forward , and spoke before her father had time to do so . He had now turned his gaze from her and was looking at the farmer . " Faither , " she said very gently , " faither dearie , forgive me . I begs it so hard ; '
109639	109657	109635	109635	I	0	' e , but you was sent off the waters that I might . I comed in tremblin '

" Then he answered , his words bursting out of his lips sharply , painfully at first , rolling as usual in his mighty chest voice afterward . The man twisted Scripture to his narrow purposes according to Luke Gospel usage . " '

110354	110448	110449	110450	the God	2658	' right ! " Hereupon Joan , not judging correctly of the black storm signs on her father 's face or the force of the voice , now grating into a shriek as passion tumbled to flood , prayed yet again for that pardon which her parent was powerless to grant . The boon denied grew precious in her eyes . She wept and importuned , falling on her knees to him . " God can do it , God can do it , faither . Please — please , for the sake o '
110563	110678	110558	110558	He	373	' ! " There was something horribly akin to genuine madness in the frenzy of this utterance . Mrs. Tregenza screamed ; Joan struggled to her feet in some terror and her head swam . She turned to get her hat from the dresser - ledge , and , as she did so , the little blue plate , tied up in paper beside it , fell and broke , like the last link of a snapping chain . Gray Michael was making a snorting in his nostrils and his head seemed to grow lower on his shoulders . Then Mr. Chirgwin found his opportunity and spoke . " I 've heard you , an '
110696	110732	110733	110733	e	2663	' you can mind or not as you please . " He flung his old hat upon the ground and walked without fear close beside the fisherman who towered above him . " God be with '

111786	111835	111780	111782	The Lard—'the Lard	200	' " he said , and stopped a moment . Then he slowly rose to his feet and with the old voice , though it shook and slurred somewhat upon his tongue , spoke that text which served him in all occasions of unusual stress and significance . " '
111860	111958	111848	111848	He	200	' ! " Then he sat again and long remained motionless with his face buried in his hands . Meantime the old horse dragged Uncle Chirgwin and his niece away along the level road to Mousehole . Joan was wrapped in a tarpaulin and they proceeded silently a while under cold rains , which swept up from a leaden south over the sea . The wind blew strong , tore green leaves from the hedges , and chimed with the thoughts of the man and his niece . " How did you come to speak so big an '
111966	111982	111987	111987	you	199	' say no more to en , for the lights rose up in my throat an '

112042	112187	112251	112251	maaster	2700	' e. This rain would go through a barn door . " At the steep hill rising from Mousehole to Paul , Uncle Chirgwin got out and walked , while the horse , with his shoulders to the collar , plodded forward . Then , down the road came the laboring man , Billy Jago , mentioned aforetime as one who had worked for Mr. Chirgwin in the past . He touched his hat to his old master and greeted him with respect and regard . For a moment the farmer also stopped . No false sentiment tied Billy 's tongue and he spoke of matters personal to those before him , having first mournfully described his own state of health . " But theer , us gaws down to the tomb to make way for the new born . I do say , an '
112206	112218	112251	112251	maaster	2700	' a wummon in the fam'ly way . Ban't nothin' to beat 'em

" The man rolled with loutish gait down the hill ; the darkness gathered ; the wind whistled through high hedges on the left ; farmer Chirgwin made sounds of encouragement to his horse , which moved onward ; and Joan thought with curious interest of those things that Billy Jago had said .

" By which I means , " he added , " that these new - fangled ways of approaching the A'mighty may go to branch and trunk an '
112485	112494	112387	112387	Joan	183	' evil , but they leaves the root o '

112674	112840	112848	112848	he	2707	' fore the year 's a month older . " With which hopeful prediction Uncle Chirgwin ended the discussion . That night the circular storm , which had died away at dark , turned upon itself and the wind moaned at window latches and down chimneys , prophesying autumn . Dawn broke on a drenched , gray world , but the storm had clean passed , and at noon the gray brightened to silver and burned to gold when the sun came out . The wind wore to the west , and on to northwest ; the weather settled down and days of a rare late summer pursued their even way . A fortnight passed , and the farmer 's belief that Gray Michael would communicate with his daughter began to waver . " Pharaoh 's a soft-'earted twoad to this wan , " he declared gloomily . " It do beat me to picksher sich a man . I 've piped to en hot an '

For a moment the page with its large printed characters danced before her eyes , then they steadied and she was able to read . Like a message from one long dead came the words ; and in truth , though the writer lived , he wrote upon the threshold of the grave . John Barren had put into force his project , which was , as may be remembered , to write to Joan when the end of his journey came in sight . The words were carefully chosen , for he remembered her sympathy with suffering and her extensive ignorance . He wrote in simple language , therefore , and dwelt on his own helpless condition , exaggerating it to some extent . " No . 6 Melbury Gardens , London . " My own dear love — What can I say to make you know what has kept me away from you ? There is but one word and that is my poor sick and suffering body . I wrote to you and tore up what I wrote , for I loved you too much to ask you to come and share my sad life . It was very , very awful to be away and know you were waiting and waiting for Jan ; yet I could not come , because Mother Nature was so hard . Then I went far away and hoped you had forgotten me . Doctors made me go to a place over the sea where tall palm trees grew up out of a dry yellow desert ; but my poor lungs were too sick to get well again and I came home to die . Yes , sweetheart , you will forgive me for all when you know poor lonely Jan will soon be gone . He can not live much longer , and he is so weak now that he has no more power to fight against the love of Joan . " For your own good , dear one , I made myself keep away and hid myself from you . Now the little life left to me cries out by night and by day for you . Joan , my own true love , I can not die until I have seen you again . Come to me , Joan , love , if you do not hate me . Come to me ; come ; and close my eyes and let poor Jan have the one face that he loves quite near him at the end . Even your picture has gone , for they came when I was away and took it and put it in a place with many others for people to see . And all men and women say it is the best picture . I shall be dead before they send it back to me . So now I have nothing but the thoughts of my Joan . Oh , come to me , my love , if you can . It will not be for long , and when Jan lies under the ground all that he has is yours . I have fought so hard to keep from you and from praying you to come to me , but I can fight no more . My home is named at the top of this letter . You have but to enter the train for London and stop in it until it gets to the end of its journey . My servant shall wait each day for your coming . I can write no more , I can only pray to the God we both love to bring you to me . And if you come or do not I shall have the same great true love for you . I will die alone rather than trouble you to come if you have forgotten me and not forgiven me for keeping silence . God bless you , my only love . JAN . " This feeble stuff rang like a clarion on the ear of the reader , for he who had written it knew how best to strike , how best to appeal with overwhelming force to Joan Tregenza . Her mind plunged straight into the struggle and the billows of the storm , sweeping aside lesser obstructions , were soon beating against the new - built ramparts of faith . The rush of thought which had coursed through her brains before reading the letter now made the task of deciding upon it easier . Indeed it can hardly be said that any real doubt from first to last assailed Joan 's decision . Faith did not crumble , but , at a second glance , appeared to her wholly compatible with obedience to this demand . There was an electric force in every word of the letter . It proved Mister Jan 's wondrous nobility of character , his unselfishness , his love . He had suffered , too , had longed eternally for her , had denied himself out of consideration for her future happiness , had struggled with his love , and only broken down and given way to it in the shadow of death . Grief shook Joan upon this thought , but joy was uppermost . The long months of weary suffering faded from her recollection as nocturnal mists vanish at the touch of the sun 's first fire . She had no power to analyze the position or reflect upon the various courses of action the man might have taken to spare her so much agony . She accepted his bald utterance word for word , as he knew she would . Every inclination and desire swept her toward him now . His cry of suffering , his love , his loneliness , her duty , as it stood blazoned upon her mind ten minutes after reading his letter ; the child to be born within two months — all these considerations united to establish Joan 's mind at this juncture . " Come to me ! " Those were the words echoing within her heart , and her soul cried upon Christ to shorten time that she might reach him the sooner . Before the world was next awake , she would be upon her way ; before another night fell , Mister Jan 's arms would be round her . The long , dreary nightmare had ended for her at last . Then came tears of bitter remorse , for she saw how his love had never left her , how he had been true as steel , while she , misled by appearances , had lost faith and lapsed into forgetfulness . A wild , unreasoning yearning superior to time and space and the service of railways got hold upon her . " Come to me , " " Come to me , " sounded in Joan 's ears in the live voice she had loved and lost and found again . An hour 's delay , a minute 's , a moment 's seemed a crime . Yet delay there must be , but the tension and terrific excitement of her whole being at this period demanded some immediate outlet in action . She wanted to talk to Uncle Chirgwin , and she desired instant information upon the subject of her journey . First she thought of seeking the farmer in the valley ; then it struck her , the hour being not later than eight o'clock , that by going into Penzance she might learn at what time the morning train departed to London . Out of doors it was inky black , very silent , very oppressive . Joan called Mary twice before departing , but received no answer . Indeed the house was empty , though she did not know it . Finally , thrusting the letter into her bosom , taking her hat and cloak from a nail in the kitchen and putting on a pair of walking shoes , the girl went abroad . Her present medley of thoughts begot a state of exceeding nervous excitation . For the letter touched the two poles of extreme happiness and utmost possible sorrow . " Mister Jan " was calling her to him indeed , but only calling her that she might see him die . Careless of her steps , soothed unconsciously by rapid motion , she walked from the farm , her mind full of joy and grief ; and the night , silent no longer for her , was full of a voice crying " Come to me , Joan , love , come ! " In the coomb beneath Drift , flashing as though red - hot from a theater of Cimmerian blackness , certain figures , flame - lighted , flickered hurriedly this way and that about a dark and monstrous pile which rose in their midst . From the adjacent hill , superstitious watchers might have supposed that they beheld some demoniac throng newly burst oat of the bowels of earth and to be presently re - engulfed ; but seen nearer , the toiling creatures , fighting with all their hearts and souls to save a haystack from flood , had merely excited human interest and commiseration . Farmer Chirgwin and his men were girt as to the legs in old - fashioned hay - bands ; some held torches while others toiled with ropes to anchor the giant rick against the gathering waters . There was no immediate fear , for the pile still stood a clear foot above the stream on a gentle undulation distant nearly two yards from the present boundary of the swollen river . But , on the landward side , another danger threatened , because in that quarter the meadow sank in a slight hollow which had now changed to a lake fed by a brisk rivulet from the main river . The great rick thus stood almost insulated , and much further uprising of the flood would place it in a position not to be approached by man without danger . Above the stack , distant about five - and - twenty yards , stood a couple of stout pollarded willows , and by these Uncle Chirgwin had decided to moor his hay , trusting that they might hold the great mass of it secure even though the threatened flood swept away its foundations . Nine figures worked amain , and to them approached a tenth , appearing from the darkness , skirting the lake and splashing through the streamlet which fed it . Mary Chirgwin it was who now arrived — a grotesque figure with her gown and petticoats fastened high and wearing on her legs a pair of her uncle 's leather gaiters . Mary had been up to the farm for more rope , but the clothesline was all that she could find , and this she now returned with . Already three ropes had been passed round the rick and made fast to the willows , but none among them was of great stoutness , nor had they been tied at an elevation best calculated to resist a possible strain . Amos Bartlett took the line from Mary and set to work with many assistants ; while the farmer himself , waving a torch and stumping hither and thither , now directed Bartlett , now encouraged two men who worked with all their might at the cutting of a trench from the lake in order that this dangerous body of water might be drained back to the main stream . The flame - light danced in many a flash and splash over the smooth surface of the face of the inland pond . Indeed it reflected like a glass at present , for no wind fretted it , neither did a drop of rain fall . Intense , watchful silence held that hour . The squash of men 's feet in the mud , the soft swirl of the water , the cry of voices alone disturbed the night . " God be praised ! I do think '
119404	119695	119696	119696	e	2864	' bating , " cried the farmer presently . He ran every few minutes to the water and examined a stake hammered into it a foot from the edge . It seemed , as far as might be judged by such fitful light and rough measurement , that the river had sunk an inch or two , but it was running in undulations , and what its muddy mass had lost in volume was gained in speed . The water chattered and hissed ; and Amos Bartlett , who next made a survey , declared that the flood had by no means waned , but rather risen . Then , the last ropes being disposed to the best advantage , all joined the laborers who were digging . Twenty minutes later , however , and before the trench was more than three parts finished , there came a tremendous change . Turning hastily to the river , Bartlett uttered a shout of alarm and called for light . He had approached the telltale stake , and suddenly , before he reached it , found his feet in the water . The river was rising with fierce rapidity at last , and five minutes later began to lick at the edge of the hay - rick , and churn along with a strange hidden force and devil in it . The pace increased with the volume , and told of some prodigious outburst on the moor . The uncanny silence of the swelling water as it slipped downward was a curious feature of it in this phase . Chirgwin and his men huddled together at the side of the rick ; then Bartlett held up his hand and spoke . " Hark '
119699	119702	119696	119696	e	2864	' Tis comin '
119910	119914	119963	119963	God	179	' Tis the callin '
119916	119930	119963	119963	God	179	' the cleeves , " said Uncle Chirgwin . " Nay , man , '

119945	119954	119963	119963	God	179	' ower the airth like a legion out o '

120016	120017	119963	119963	God	179	' '
120020	120087	119963	119963	God	179	' faster'n thot . " As Bartlett spoke , the voice of the tempest grew rapidly nearer , all mystery faded out of it and its murmuring changed to a hoarse rattle . Thunder growled a bass to the shriek of coming winds and a flash of distant lightning bridged the head of the coomb with a crooked snake of fire . " Us'd best to get '
120093	120117	119963	119963	God	179	' this , " shouted Bartlett . " All as men can do us have done . The hay 's in the hand o '
120129	120926	120121	120121	I	0	' that stack not for diamonds all the same . " A cry cut him short . Mary had turned and found the way to higher ground already cut off . The lake was rising under their eyes , and that in spite of the fact that the waters had already reached the trench cut for them , and now tumbled in a torrent back to the parent stream . Escape in this direction was clearly impossible . It only remained to wade through the head of the lake , and that without a moment 's delay . Mary herself , holding a torch , went first through water above her knees and the men hastily followed , Uncle Chirgwin coming last and being nearly carried off his short legs as he turned to view the rick . Once through the water , all were in safety , for the meadow sloped steeply upward . An increasing play of lightning made the torches useless , and they were dropped , while the party pressed close beneath an overhanging hedge which ran along the upper boundary of the meadow . From this vantage - ground they beheld a spectacle unexampled in the memory of any among them . Screaming like some incarnate and mad manifestation of all the elements massed in one , the hurricane launched itself upon that valley . As a wall the wind heralded the water , while forked lightnings , flaming above both , tore the black darkness into jagged rags and lighted a chaos of yellow foaming torrent which battled with livid front straight down the heart of the coomb . The swollen river was lost in the torrent of it ; and the hiss of the rain was drowned by its sound . So Nature 's full , hollowed hand ran over lightning - lighted to the organ music of the thunder ; but for these horror - stricken watchers the majestic phenomena sweeping before them held no splendor and prompted no admiration . They only saw ruin tearing at the roots of the land ; they only imagined drowned beasts floating before them belly upward , scattered hay hurried to the sea , wasted crops , a million tons of precious soil torn off the fields , orchards desolated , bridges and roads destroyed . For them misery stared out of the lightning and starvation rode upon the flood . The roar of water answering the thunder above it was to their ears Earth groaning against the rod , and right well they knew that the pale torrent was drowning those summer labors which represented money and food for the on - coming of the long winter months . They stared , silent and dumb , under the ram ; they knew that the kernel of near a year 's toil was riding away upon the livid torrent ; that the higher meadows , held absolutely safe , were half under water now ; that the flood tumbling under the blue fire most surely held sheep and cattle in its depths ; that tons of upland hay swam upon it ; that , like enough , dead men also turned and twisted there in a last mad journey to the sea . A passing belief that their labors might save the stack sprung up in the breast of one alone . Uncle Chirgwin trusted Providence and his hempen ropes and clothesline ; but it was a childish hope , and , gazing open - mouthed upon that swelling , hurtling cataract of roaring water , none shared it . An almost continuous mist of livid light crossed and recrossed , festooned and cut by its own crinkled sources , revealed the progress of the flood , and , heedless of themselves , Uncle Chirgwin and his men watched the fate of the stack , now rising very pale of hue above the water , seen through shining curtains of rain . First the torrent tumbled and rose about it , and then a sudden tremor and turning of the mass told that the rick floated . As it twisted the weak ropes , receiving the strain in turn , snapped one after another ; then the great stack moved solemnly forward , stuck fast , moved again , lost its center of gravity and foundered like a ship . Under the lightning they saw it heave upward upon one side , plunge forward against the torrent which had swept its base from beneath it , and vanish . The farmer heaved a bitter groan . " Dear God , that sich things can be in a Christian land , " he cried . " All gone , this year , an '

121129	121176	121087	121089	the man Bartlett	2879	' the airth 's to be burned , not drowned . " " Let a come when a will now , " gasped an aged man as the drenched party moved slowly away upward to the farm ; " our ears be tuned to the trump o '
121188	121205	121087	121089	the man Bartlett	2879	' horns blawed by all the angels in heaven — could sound awfuler than the tantarra o '

121846	122754	122787	122788	Mary Chirgwin	222	' lives . Yet the petty rivalry of split and riven creeds actuated not a few even at that time of peril , and while life was allowed sacred and no man turned a deaf ear to the cry of woman or child , with property the case was altered and sects lifted not a finger each to help the other in the saving of furniture and effects . Newlyn furnished but one theater of a desolation which covered wide regions . At Penzance , the Laregan River flooded all the lowlands as it swept with prodigious cataracts to the sea ; mighty lakes stretched between Penzance and Gulval ; the brooklets of Ponsandine and Coombe , swollen to torrents , bore crushing destruction upon the valleys through which they fell . Bleu Bridge with its ancient inscribed " long stone " was swept into the bed of the Ponsandine , and here , as in other low - lying lands , many tons of hay were torn from their foundations and set adrift . At Churchtown the rainfall precipitated off the slopes of Castle - an - dinas begot vast torrents which , upon their roaring way , tore the very heart out of steep and stony lanes , flooded farmyards , plowed up miles of hillside , leaped the wall of the cemetery below and spread twining yellow fingers among the graves . Three hundred tons of rain fell to the acre in the immediate tract of that terrific storm , and the world of misery , loss and suffering poured forth on the humble dwellers of the land only came to be estimated in its bitter magnitude during the course of the winter which followed . Ashore it was not immediately known whether any loss of human life had added crowning horror to the catastrophe , but evil news came quickly off the sea . Mourning fell upon Mousehole for the crews of two among its fisher fleet who were lost that night upon the way toward Plymouth waters to join the herring fishery ; and Newlyn heard the wail of a robbed mother . At Drift the farmhouse was found to hold a mystery soon after the day had broken . Joan Tregenza , whose condition rendered it impossible for her to actively assist at the struggle in the coomb , did not retire early on the previous night , as her family supposed , and Mary , entering her room at breakfast - time , found it empty . There was no sign of the girl and no indication of anything which could explain her absence . At the dawn of the day which followed upon the great storm , while yet the sea ran high and the gale died hard , many tumbling luggers , some maimed , began to dot the wind - torn waters of Mounts Bay . The tide was out , but within the shelter of the shore which rose between Newlyn and the course of the wind , the returning boats found safety at their accustomed anchorage ; and as one by one they made the little roads , as boat after boat came ashore from the fleet , tears , hysteric screams and deep - voiced thanks to the Almighty arose from the crowd of men and women massed at the extremity of Newlyn pier beneath the lighthouse . Cheers and many a shake of hand greeted every party as , weary - eyed and worn , it landed and climbed the slippery steps . From such moments even those still in the shadow of terrible fear plucked a little courage and brightened hopes . Then each of the returned fishermen , with his own clinging to him , set face homeward — a rejoicing stream of little separate processions , every one heralding a saved life . There crept thus inland wives smiling through the mist of dead tears , old mothers hobbling beside their bearded sons , young mothers pouring blessing on proud sailor boys , sweethearts , withered ancients , daughters , sons , little children . Sad beyond power of thought were the hearts of all as they had hastened to the pierhead at early morning light ; now the sorrowful still remained there , but those who came away rejoiced , for none returned without their treasures . Thomasin stood with many another care - stricken soul , but her fears grew greater as the delay increased ; for the Tregenza lugger was big and fast , yet many boats of less fame had already come home . All the fishermen told the same story . Bursting out of an ominous peace the storm had fallen suddenly upon them when westward of the Scilly Islands . One or two were believed to have made neighboring ports in the isles , but the fleet was driven before the gale and had experienced those grave hazards reserved for small vessels in a heavy sea . That all had weathered the night seemed a circumstance too happy to hope for , but Newlyn hearts rose high as boat after boat came back in safety . Then a dozen men hastened to Mrs. Tregenza with the good news that her husband 's vessel was in sight . " She've lost her mizzen by the looks on it , " said a fisherman , " an '

God a mercy ! Dead ! Then let me die tu ! " She gave vent to extravagant and savage grief after the manner of her kind . She would have torn her hair and thrown herself off the quay but for kindly hands which restrained . " God rot you , an '

She had yet to learn the cause ; she had yet to know that Michael had drifted beyond the reach of all further mental suffering whatsoever . No religious anxieties , no mundane trials , none of the million lesser carking troubles that fret the sane brain and stamp care on the face of conscious intelligence would plague him more . Henceforth he was dead to the changes and chances of human life . At midnight there came the awful waking . Thomasin slept at last and slumbered dream - tossed in a shadow - world of fantastic troubles . Then a sound roused her — the sound of a voice speaking loudly , breaking off to laugh , and speaking again . The voice she knew , but the laugh she had never heard . She started up and listened . It was her husband who had wakened her . " How do it go then ? Lard ! my memory be like a fishin '

Thomasin , her heart near standing still before this awful discovery , hesitated between stopping and flying from the room before he should discover her . But she felt no fear of the man himself , and bracing her nerves , struck a light . It showed Gray Michael sitting up and evidently under the impression he was at sea . He grasped the bed - head as a tiller and peered anxiously ahead . " Theer 's light shawin '

She forgot all her other troubles before this overwhelming tragedy . And the man driveled on in the dark , concerning himself for the most part with those interests which had occupied his life when he was a boy . Mary Chirgwin did not return to Newlyn after making inquiries at Penzance . There indeed she learned one fact which might prove important , but the possibilities to be read from it were various . Joan had been at the Penzance railway station , and chance made Mary question the identical porter who had studied the timetable for her cousin . " She was anxious 'bout

" He busied himself with the hurdle accordingly , and when two of the hands presently came down from Drift they found their burden ready for them . The old , silent man called Gaffer Polglaze found sufficient excitement in the tragedy to loosen a tongue which seldom wagged . He spat on his hands and rubbed them together before seizing his end of the hurdle . Then he spoke : " My stars ! to see maaster when he heard ! He rolled all about as if he was drunk . An '

" Mary Chirgwin met the mournful train , directed them to bring the body of Joan into the parlor where a place was prepared for it , and then turned to Bartlett . She was trembling and very pale for one of her complexion , but the woman 's self - command had not left her . " The auld man 's like wan daft , " she said hurriedly . " He must be doin' , so he rushed away to Newlyn to tell 'em
128697	128712	128694	128694	He	3111	' tall . You 'd best to go arter en now this minute . An '

128762	129044	129045	129045	you	3115	' Tis thrawed awver the poor faace of her . " Two minutes later Mr. Bartlett followed his master , but Uncle Chirgwin had taken a considerable start of him . The old man was terribly shocked to hear the news , for he had clung to a theory that Joan was long since in London . Dread and fear came over him . The thought of facing this particular corpse was more than he could contemplate with self - control . A great nervous terror mingled with his grief . He wished to avoid the return from the valley , and the first excuse for so doing which came to his mind he hurriedly acted upon . He declared it essential that the Tregenzas should be told instantly , and hastened away before Mary could argue with him . Only that morning they had heard of Gray Michael 's condition , but Uncle Chirgwin forgot it when the blasting news of his niece 's death fell upon him . He hurried snuffling and weeping along as fast as his legs would bear him , and not until he stood at their cottage door did he recollect the calamities which had overtaken the fisherman and those of his household . Uncle Chirgwin began to speak hastily the moment Mrs. Tregenza opened the door . He choked and gurgled over his news . " She'm dead — Joan . They 've found her in the brook as the waters went down . Drownded theer — the awnly sunshine as ever smiled at Drift . Oh , my good God!—'tis a miz - maze to drive us all out of our senses . An '

129416	129601	129602	129602	e	3134	' that . " The other laughed loudly , and burst into mindless profanity and obscenity . So the purest liver and most cleanly thinker has often cursed and uttered horrible imprecations and profanations under the knife , being chloroformed and unconscious the while . Uncle Chirgwin gazed and listened open mouthed . This spectacle of a shattered intellect came upon him as an absolutely new manifestation . Any novel experience is rare when a man has passed the age of seventy , and the farmer was profoundly agitated . Then a solemn fit fell upon Gray Michael , and as his visitor rose to depart he quoted from words long familiar to the speaker — weird utterances , and doubly weird from a madman 's mouth in Uncle Chirgwin 's opinion . Out of the wreck and ruin of quite youthful memories , Michael 's maimed mind had now passed to these later , strenuous days of his early religious existence , when he fought for his soul , and lived with the Bible in his hand . " Hark to me , will '
129609	129616	129617	129617	He	3135	' God echoed by His worm . '
129625	129640	129617	129617	He	3135	' he that forbeareth let en forbear , for they are a rebellious house . '

129867	130609	129617	129617	He	3135	' " He relapsed into absolute silence and sat with his eyes on the fire . Sometimes he shook , sometimes he nodded his head ; now he frowned , then grinned vacuously at the current of his thoughts . Mr. Chirgwin took his leave of Thomasin , prayed that she might be supported in her tribulation , and so departing met Amos Bartlett who was standing outside the cottage awaiting him . The man gave a forcible and blunt description of his morning 's work which brought many tears to Uncle Chirgwin 's eyes ; then , together , they walked to Penzance , there to chronicle the sudden death of Joan Tregenza and arrange for those necessary formalities which must precede her burial . The spectacle of Tregenza 's insanity , which to an educated observer had perhaps presented features of some scientific interest and appeared grotesque rather than tremendous , fell upon the ignorant soul of Uncle Chirgwin in a manner far different . The mystery of madness , the sublimity and horror of it , rise only to tragic heights in the untutored minds of such beholders as the farmer , for no mere scientific manifestation of mental disease is presented to their intelligence . Instead they stand face to face with the infinitely more terrific apparition of God speaking direct through the mouth of one among His chosen insane . In their estimation a madman 's utterance is pregnant , oracular , a subject worthy of most grave consideration and appraisement . And after Gray Michael 's mental downfall many humble folks , incited by the remarkable religious fame of his past life , begged permission to approach within sound of his voice at those moments when the desire for utterance was upon him . This , indeed , came to be a privilege not a little sought after . Mary Chirgwin would allow none but herself to perform the last offices of kindness for her cousin . In poor Joan 's pocket she found a wet , crumpled mass of paper which might have been dried and read without difficulty , but Mary lacked curiosity to approach the matter . She debated with herself as to how her duty stood in connection with the communication from John Barron , then took it in her hand , not without a sensation of much loathing , and burned it to ashes . The act produced considerable and unforeseen consequences . Her own mundane happiness was wholly dependent on the burning of the letter , and a man 's life likewise hung upon the incident ; but these results of her conduct were only brought to the woman 's understanding in the light of subsequent events . Then , and with just if superficial cause , she directly read God 's hand in the circumstance . Another discovery saddened Mary far more than that of the letter , which had caused her little surprise . Around Joan 's white body was a strange amulet — the glen - ader . She had sewed it upon flannel , then fastened the ends about herself , and so worn the snake skin at all seasons since the finding of it . The fact was nothing , the condition of mind which it indicated brought great grief to the discoverer . She judged that Joan was little better than heathen after all ; she greatly feared that the girl had perished but half - believing . Any soul which could thus cherish the slough of a serpent must most surely have been wandering afar out of the road of faith . The all - embracing credulity of Joan was , in fact , a phenomenon beyond Mary 's power to estimate or translate ; and her present discovery , therefore , caused her both pain and consternation . But as she had burned the letter , so she likewise destroyed all evidence of her cousin 's superstitious weakness ; and of neither one nor the other did she speak when the farmer returned to his home . He was sadly crushed and broken ; and the spectacle of his loved one , lying silent and peaceful , brought with it deep grief for him . Not until he had seen her and held her dead hand did he begin slowly to realize the truth . " Her mother do lie at Paul '

She spoke coldly and practically ; she fetched him a stiff dose of spirits and a mutton - chop freshly cooked . These things she made him drink and eat , and she spoke to the old man while he did so , larding the discussion of necessary details with expressions of hope for the dead . " Be strong , an '

" The coroner 's inquest found that Joan Tregenza had come by her death from drowning upon the night of the flood ; the tragedy filled an obscure paragraph or two in local journals ; Joan 's funeral was fixed for two days later , and Mrs. Tregenza decided that she would attend it . At a spot where fell the shadow of the church when the sun sank far westerly on summer days , they dug the grave in Sancreed churchyard . Round about it on slate slabs and upright stones appeared the names of Chirgwins not a few . Her maternal grandparents lay there , her uncle , Mary 's father , and many others . Some of the graves dated back for a hundred and more years . On the morning of the funeral , Uncle Thomas himself tied scraps of crape around the stems of his tall geraniums , according to an ancient custom ; and Mrs. Tregenza arrived at Drift in good time to join the few who mourned . Six men bore Joan 's oaken coffin to Sancreed , while there walked behind her , Uncle Chirgwin , Mary and Thomasin , Mr. Bartlett , his wife , Gaffer Polglaze , and two farm maidens . A few of the Drift folk and half a dozen young children came in the wake of the procession proper ; and that was all . The mourners and their dead proceeded along the high lanes to Sancreed , and conversation was general . Uncle Chirgwin tugged at his black gloves and snuffled , then snuffled and tugged again ; Mary walked on one side of him ; and Mrs. Tregenza , in new and heavy black bought for another , found the opportunity convenient for the display of varied grief , as she marched along on the farmer 's right hand . Her condition indeed became hysterical , and Mary only soothed her with difficulty . So the party crawled within sound of the minute bell and presently reached the church . The undertaker buzzed here and there issuing directions , an old clergyman met the dead at the lych - gate and walked before her up the aisle ; while those who had a right to attend the service , clustered in the pews to right and left of the trestles . Upon them lay Joan . The words of the service sounded with mournful reverberations through the chill echoes of an unwarmed and almost empty church ; and then the little sister , sleeping peacefully enough after her one short year of storm , was carried to the last abode of silence . Then followed an old man 's voice , sounding strangely thin in the open air , the straining of cords , the sweating and hard breathing and shuffling of men , the grating of oak on a grave - bottom , the updrawing of the ropes that had lowered the coffin . Genuine grief accompanied the obsequies of Joan Tregenza , and her uncle 's sorrow touched even men to visible grief and sympathy ; but there was no heart to break for the heart which had itself come so near to breaking , there was no mighty wellspring of love to be choked with tears for one who had herself loved so much . A feeling , hidden in some minds , expressed by others , latent in all , pervaded that throng ; and there was not one among those present , save Thomas Chirgwin , but felt that Providence , harsh till now , had dealt kindly by Joan in dealing death to her . Upon the flowerless , shiny coffin - lid a staring plate of white metal gleamed up at the world above like an eye and met the gaze of the mourners , as each in turn , with Mrs. Tregenza first , peered down into Joan 's grave before departing . After which all went away ; the children were shut out of the churchyard ; the old clergyman disappeared to the vestry ; a young florid man , with pale hair , tightened his leather belt , turned up his sleeves , watched a grand pair of biceps roll up as he crooked his elbows , then , taking a spade , set to work upon the wet mound he had dug from the earth the day before to clear those few square feet of space below . As he worked , he whistled , for his occupation held no more significance to him than an alternative employment : the breaking of stones by the highway side . He could see the black heads of the mourners bobbing away upon the road to Drift , and stopped to watch them for a moment . But soon he returned to his labor ; the earth rose foot by foot , and the strong young man stamped it down . Then it bulged and overflowed the full hole ; whereupon he patted and hammered it into the customary mound and slapped upon it sundry pieces of sodden turf with gaping gashes between their edges . The surplus soil he removed in a wheelbarrow , the boards he also took away , then raked over the earth - smeared , bruised grass about the grave and so made an end of his work . " Blamed if I ever filled wan quicker'n that , " he thought , with some satisfaction ; " I reckoned the rain must fall afore I 'd done , but it do hold off yet seemin'ly . " The man departed , gray twilight fell , and out from the gathering darkness , like a wound on the hand of Time , that new - made grave and its fringe of muddy grass stood forth , crude of color , raw , unsightly in the deepening monochrome of the gloaming . At Drift the important meal which follows a funeral was enjoyed with sober satisfaction by about fifteen persons . Cold fowls and a round of cold beef formed the main features of the repast ; Mary poured out tea for the women at her end of the table , while the men drank two or three bottles of grocer 's sherry among them . The undertaker and his assistants followed when the funeral assembly dispersed . Mrs. Tregenza was about to depart in the fly specially ordered to take her home when a lawyer , who was of the company , begged she would stay a little longer . " I learn that you are the deceased 's stepmother , madam , and as you stand related to the parties both now unhappily swept away by Providence — I mean Thomas Tregenza and Joan — it is sufficiently clear that you inherit directly the bequest left by the poor girl to her brother . I framed her little will myself ; failing her own child , her property went to Thomas Tregenza , his heirs and assigns — those were the words . The paper is here ; the sum mentioned lies at interest of three per cent . Let me know when convenient what you would wish to be done . " So the pile of money , at a cost terrible enough , had reached Mrs. Tregenza after all . She had been drinking brown sherry as well as tea , and was in a condition of renewed tears approaching to maudlin , when the announcement reached her . It steadied the woman . Then the thought that this wealth would have been her son 's made her weep again , until the fact that it was now her own became grasped in her mind . There is a sort of people who find money a reasonably good support in all human misfortune , and if Mrs. Tregenza did not entirely belong to that callous company , yet it is certain that this sudden afflux of gold was more likely to assuage her grief than most things . She presently retired , all tears and care ; but at intervals , when sorrow rested to regain its strength , the lawyer 's information recurred and the distractions of mind caused by the contemplation of a future brightened by this wealth soothed Thomasin 's nerves to an extent beyond the power of religion or any other force which could possibly have been brought to bear upon them . She felt that her own position must henceforth be exalted in Newlyn , for the effects of the combination of catastrophes led to that end . Her husband was the sole care she had left , and physicians foretold no great length of days for him . The lugger would be put up to auction , with the drift nets and all pertaining thereto . The cottage was already Tregenza property . Thomasin therefore looked through the overwhelming misery of the time , counted her moneys and felt comforted without knowing it . As for her insane husband , his very sufferings magnified him into a man of importance , and she enjoyed the reflected glory of being his keeper . People came from remote villages to listen to him , and it was held a privilege among the humbler sort to view the ruin of Michael Tregenza and hark to the chaotic ravings of a mind overthrown . A fortnight and four days after the funeral of Joan Tregenza there blew a southwest wind over Newlyn , from out a gray sky , dotted with watery blots of darker gray . No added light marked the western horizon at sunset , but the short , dull day simply fell headlong into night ; and with darkness came the rain . About five o'clock in the afternoon , when the flicker and shine of many lamps in little shop windows brightened the tortuous streets , a man clad in tarpaulins , and carrying a big canvas bag on his back , passed rapidly through the village . He had come that day from London upon the paying off of his vessel ; and while he left his two chests at the railway station , he made shift to bring his sea - bag along himself ; and that because he was bound for the white cottage on the cliff , and the bag held many precious foreign concerns for Joan Tregenza . It had been impossible to communicate with the sailor ; and he did not write from London to tell any of his return , that their pleasure and surprise on his appearance might be the more complete . Now a greater shock than that in his power to give waited the man himself . The sailor 's parents lived at Mousehole , but Michael 's cottage lay upon the way , and there he first designed to appear . Joe Noy was a very big man , loosely but strongly set together , a Celt to the backbone , hard , narrow of mind , but possessing rare determination . His tanned , clean - shaven face was broader at the jaw than the eyes , and a lowering heaviness of aspect , almost ape - like , resulted when his features remained in repose . The effect , however , vanished when he spoke or listened to the speech of another . That such a man had proved fickle in love was a thing difficult to credit to the mind familiar with his character . Solid , sober , simple , fearing God and lacking humor , the jilting of a woman was an offense of all others least likely to have been associated with him . Yet circumstances and some unsuspected secrets of disposition had brought about that event ; and now , as he hastened along , the vision of the dark woman he once loved at Drift did not for an instant cross his thoughts , for they were full of the fair girl he meant to marry at Newlyn . To her , at least , he had kept faithful enough ; she had been the guiding - star of his life for hard upon a year of absence ; not one morning , not one night , in fair weather or foul , had he omitted to pray God 's blessing upon her . A fatalism , which his Luke Gospel tenets did not modify , was strong in the sailor . He had seen death often enough in his business ; and his instincts told him , apart from all religious teaching , that those who died ripe for salvation were but few . Every man appeared to be an instrument in God 's hand , and human free - will represented a condition quite beyond the scope of his intelligence to estimate or even conceive . Had any justified in so doing asked of him his reasons for desertion of Mary Chirgwin , Noy would have explained that when inviting her to be his wife he took a wrong step in darkness ; that light had since suddenly shone upon him , as upon Saul , and that Mary , choosing rather to remain outside the sure fold of Luke Gospeldom , by so doing made it impossible for him to love her longer . He would have added that the match was doubtless foredoomed according to the arrangements of the Almighty . Now Joe came back to his own ; and his heart beat faster by several pulses , and his steps quickened and lengthened , as , through darkness and rain , he sighted the lamp - lighted cottage window of the Tregenzas . Thereupon he stopped a moment , brought his bag to the ground , mopped his forehead , then , raising the latch , strode straight into the kitchen without a knock of warning . For a moment he imagined the room , lighted only by a dull glow of firelight , to be empty ; but then , amid familiar objects , he noted one not familiar — a tall and roomy armchair . This stood beside the fireplace , and in it sat Gray Michael . " Why , so '
133602	133631	131162	131163	the idiot	3153	' nough ! " the traveler exclaimed , setting down his bag and coming forward with hand outstretched . " Here I be at last arter nine months o '

Then it struck him that the man 's wife and daughter could not be far off . What blasting catastrophe had robbed him of his mind the sailor knew not ; but once assured of the fact that Michael Tregenza was hopelessly insane , Noy lent no credit to any of his utterances , and of course failed to dimly guess at those facts upon which his ravings were based . Indeed he heard little after the first rambling outburst , for his own thoughts were busy with the problems of Tregenza 's fate . " Sit down , mariner . I sha n't sail till marnin '

But Michael 's mind had wandered off the subject again . " I seed en cast forth a net , same as us does for macker'l , but '
134876	134879	134867	134867	they	3181	' few of 'em

Then , approaching , she gasped her surprise and stood for a moment dumb , looking from her husband to the sailor , from the sailor back to her husband . The horror on Noy 's face frightened her ; indeed he was now strung to a pitch of frantic excitement . He saw that the woman was altogether clad in black , that her garments were new , that even her bonnet had a black flower in it ; and , despite his concern , he observed an appearance of prosperity about her , though her face belied it , for Mrs. Tregenza was very thin , and far grayer and older too than when he saw her last . He took the hand she stretched shaking toward him ; then a question burst from his lips . " For God 's sake speak an '

" His wife looked to see how Joe viewed this statement . A great local superstition was growing up round Gray Michael , and his wild utterances ( sometimes profanely fearful beyond the possibility of setting down ) were listened to greedily as inspirations and oracles . Mrs. Tregenza herself became presently imbued with something of this morbid and ignorant opinion . Her deep wounds time promised to heal at the first intention , and the significance now attributed to her insane husband grew to be a source of real satisfaction to her . She dispensed the honor of interviews with Michael as one distributes great gifts . The force of circumstances and the futility of fighting against fate impressed Thomasin mightily now , as Noy 's wild eyes asked the question his lips could not force themselves to frame . She sighed and bent her head and turned her eyes away from him , then spoke hurriedly : " I doan't knaw how to tell '

" He broke into laughter , and Joe Noy , saying a few hasty words to Thomasin , departed . He who less than an hour before had hastened hot - footed through the Newlyn streets , whose habitual stern expression had softened before the well - known sights and smells of the gray village , whose earnest soul was full of happiness under the rain of the night , now turned back upon his way and skulked through the darkness with a murderer 's heart in him . The clear spectacle of his revenge blinded lesser presentations and even distracted his sorrow . There was no space now vacant in Noy 's brain to hold the full extent of his loss ; and the fabric of happiness which for weary months on various seas he had been building up in imagination , and which a madman 's word had now sent spinning to chaos , yet remained curiously with him , as an impression stamped by steadfast gazing remains upon the eye . It recurred as of old : a joy ; and not till the former emotion of happiness had again and again reappeared to be blunted , as a dream , at waking , by the new knowledge , did truth sink into this man 's mind and become part of memory . Now he was dazed , as one who has run hard and well to a goal , and who , reaching it , finds his prize stolen . Under these circumstances , Joe Noy 's natural fatalism — an instinct beyond the power of any religion to destroy — appeared instant and strong . Chance had now fed these characteristics , and they grew gigantic in an hour . But the religious habit made him turn to his Maker in this pass , and the merely primitive passions , which were now breaking loose within him , he regarded as the direct voices of God . They proclaimed that solitary duty the world still held for him ; they marked out his road to the lurid end of it . Thus Noy 's own furious lust for revenge was easily and naturally elevated into a mandate from the Highest — into a message echoed and reiterated upon his ear by the multitudinous voices of that wild night . The rain whispered it on the roof - trees , the wind and sea thundered it ; out of elemental chaos the awful command came , as from primal lips which had spoken since creation to find at last the ultimate destination of their message within a human ear . To Noy , his purpose , not yet an hour old , seemed ancient as eternity , a fixed and deliberate impression which had been stamped upon his mind at a period far earlier than his life in time . For one end had he been created ; that by some sudden short cut he should hurry to its close a vile life , fill up God 's bitter curse upon this man , destroy the destroyer , and speed a black soul into the torment awaiting it . Irresolute and deep in thought as to his future actions , Joe Noy walked unconsciously forward . He felt unequal to returning to his home in Mousehole after what he had learned at Newlyn ; and he wandered back , therefore , toward Penzance . A glare of gas lamps splashed the wet surface of the parade with fire ; while below him , against the sea wall , a high tide spouted and roared . Now and again , after a heavy muffled thud of sea against stone , columns of glimmering , gray foam shot upward , like gigantic ghosts out of the water . For a moment they towered in the air , then , wind - driven , swept hissing across the black and shining surfaces of the deserted parade . Noy stood here a moment , and the cold wind cooled him , and the riot and agony of the sea boiling against the granite face of the breakwater chimed with the riot and agony of his mind , whose hopes were now rent in tatters , riven , splintered and disannulled by chance . He turned a moment where the Newlyn harbor light flashed across the darkness to him . From his standpoint he knew that a line drawn through that light must fall upon the cottage of the Tregenzas beyond it on the shore , and , fixing his eyes where the building lay hidden , he stretched out his hand and spoke aloud . " May God strike me blind and daft if ever I looks '
137930	138257	137093	137093	they	3234	' yonder cot again till the man be dead . " Then he turned , and was about to seek the station , with a vague purpose to go straight to London at the earliest opportunity , when a wiser thought arrested this determination . He must learn all that it was possible to learn concerning the last days of Joan . Mrs. Tregenza had explained her stepdaughter 's life at Drift . To Drift , therefore , the sailor determined to go ; and the stress upon his mind was such that even the prospect of conversation with Mary Chirgwin — a thing he had certainly shrunk from under other circumstances — caused him no uneasiness . Over the last road that Joan had ever walked , and under similar conditions of night and storm , he tramped up to Drift , entered through the side gate , and surprised Mr. Chirgwin and his niece at their supper . As before with the Tregenzas , so now again in company of Uncle Thomas and Mary , Joe Noy formed the third in a trio of curious significance . Though aware that the sailor was due from his voyage , this sudden apparition of him at such a time startled his former friends not a little . Mary indeed was unnerved in a manner foreign to her nature , and the candle - lighted kitchen whirled in her eyes as she felt her hand in his . Save for an ejaculation from the old man , which conveyed nothing beyond his astonishment , Noy was the first to speak ; and his earliest words relieved the minds of his listeners in one great particular ; he already knew the worst that had happened . " I be come from Newlyn , from the Tregenzas . Thomasin have tawld me of all that 's falled out ; but I could n't bide in my awful trouble wi'out comin '
138274	138286	138262	138262	I	0	'm punished ugly enough . You seed her last , dead an '

138401	138408	138394	138394	you	192	'cause you — you seed Joan arter '

Thus the sailor , Noy , wholly imbued with one idea , absolutely convinced that to this end it had pleased Providence to give him life , went forth into the world that he might seek and slay the seducer of Joan . After leaving Drift he returned to Penzance , lay there that night , and upon the following morning began a methodical visitation of the Newlyn studios . Five he called at and to five artists he stated something of his case in general terms ; but none of those who heard him were familiar with any of the facts , and none could offer him either information or assistance . Edmund Murdoch was not in Newlyn , Brady had gone to Brittany ; but at the seventh studio which he visited , Joe Noy substantiated some of his facts . Paul Tarrant chanced to be at home and at work when he called ; and the artist would have told Joe everything which he wished to learn , but that Noy was cautious and reserved , not guessing that he stood before one who knew his enemy and entertained no admiration for him . " Axing pardon for taking up any of your time , sir , " he began , " but theer'm a matter concerning a party in your business as painted a maiden here , by name o '
140432	140565	140406	140407	Joan Tregenza	183	' I thot , maybe , you 'd knaw who drawed it . " Tarrant had not heard of Joan 's death , and , indeed , possessed no information concerning her , save that Barron had prevailed upon the girl to sit for a portrait . The question , therefore , struck him as curious ; and one which he put in return , merely to satisfy his own curiosity , impressed Joe in a similar way . His suspicious nature took fright and Tarrant 's dark , bright eyes seemed to read his secret and search his soul . " Yes , a portrait of Joan Tregenza was painted here last spring , but not by a Newlyn man . How does that interest you ? " " Awnly sideways . '

141175	141676	141163	141163	he	192	' galleries and likewise learned what public annual exhibitions chanced to be at that time open . Whereupon , though the circumstance failed to quicken his pulse , he discovered that the extent of his labors would prove far greater than he at first imagined . He made careful lists of the places where pictures were to be seen , and the number quickly ran up to fifty , sixty , seventy exhibitions . That he would be able to visit all these Joe knew was impossible , but the fact caused him no disquiet . The picture he sought and the name of the man who painted it must be presented to him in due season . For him it only remained to toil systematically at the search and allow no clew to escape him . As for the issue , it was with the Lord . London swept and surged about Joe Noy unheeded . He cared for nothing but canvases and the places where they might be seen . Day by day he worked and went early to rest , weary and worn by occupation of a nature so foreign to his experience . Nightly his last act was to delete one or sometimes two of the exhibitions figured upon his lists . Thus a week passed by and he had visited ten galleries and seen upward of five thousand pictures . Not one painting or drawing of them all was missed or hurried over ; he compared each with its number in the catalogue , then studied it carefully to see if any hint or suggestion of Joan appeared in it . Her Christian name often met his scrutiny in titles , and those works thus designated he regarded with greater attention than any others ; but the week passed fruitlessly , and Joe , making a calculation at the termination of it , discovered that , at his present rate of progression , it would be possible to inspect no more than half of the galleries set down before his funds were exhausted . The knowledge quickened his ingenuity and he discovered a means by which future labors might be vastly modified and much time saved . He already knew that the man responsible for Joan 's destruction was called John ; his mind now quickened with the recollection of this important fact , and henceforth he did a thing which any man less unintelligent had done from the first : he scanned his catalogues without troubling about the pictures , and only concerned himself with those canvases whose painters had " John " for their Christian names . He thanked God on his knees that the idea should have entered his mind , for his labors were thereby enormously lightened . Notwithstanding , through ignorance of his subject , Joe wasted a great deal of time and money . Thus he visited the National Gallery , the Old Masters at the Academy and various dealers '
143570	143626	143630	143630	Joan	183	' tis Joan — my awn lil Joan , as I left her , as I seed her alive ! " He had reached the rail separating the pictures from the public . Here he stood and spoke again , now conscious that there were people round about him . " She'm dead — dead an '

143686	143704	143683	143683	Joe	192	' he means , " whispered somebody , and Noy heard him . " Iss fay , so '

143767	146155	143683	143683	Joe	192	' the airth outward bound . " A man from the turnstile came up here and inquired what was the matter . His voice and tone of authority brought the sailor back to the position he occupied ; he restrained himself , therefore , and spoke no more . Already Noy feared that his passion might have raised suspicions , and now , turning and picking up his catalogue , he made hasty departure before those present had opportunity to take much further notice of him . The man hurried off into the rattle of the busy thoroughfare , and in a moment he and his sorrows and his deadly purpose had vanished away . Meantime the curator of the gallery , a man of intelligence , improved the moment and addressed some apposite reflections to those spectators who still clustered around John Barron 's picture . " It is n't often we get such a sight as that . Many people have wondered why this great work was called as it is . The man who has gone explains it , and you have had a glimpse of the picture 's history — the inner history of it . The painting has made a great sensation ever since it was first exhibited , but never such a sensation as it made to - day . " " The beggar looked as though he meant mischief , " said somebody . " He knows the model is dead apparently , but there 's another mystery there too , for Mr. Barron himself is n't aware of the fact . He was here only the day before yesterday — a little pale shadow of a man , like a ghost in a fur coat . He came to see his picture and stopped ten minutes . Two gentlemen were with him , and I heard him say , in answer to one of them as he left the gallery , that he had quite recently endeavored to learn some particulars of Joan Tregenza , his model , but had failed to do so as yet . " The gratification of his desire and the fulfillment of his revenge , though steadfastly foreseen by Joe Noy from the moment when first he set foot in London and began his search , now for a moment overwhelmed him at the prospect of their extreme propinquity . Had anything been needed to strengthen his determination on the threshold of a meeting with Joan 's destroyer , it was the startling vision of Joan herself from which he had just departed . No event had brought the magnitude of his loss more cruelly to the core of his heart than the sudden splendid representation of what he had left behind him in her innocence and beauty ; and , for the same reason , nothing could have more thoroughly fortified his mind to the deed now lying in his immediate future . Noy 's first act was to turn again to the gallery with a purpose to inquire where John Barron might be found ; but he recollected that many picture catalogues contained the private addresses of the exhibitors , and accordingly consulted the list he had brought with him . There he found the name and also the house in which the owner of it dwelt — JOHN BARRON , No . 6 Melbury Gardens , S. W. Only hours now separated him from his goal , and it seemed strange to Noy that he should have thus come in sight of it so suddenly . But his wits cooled and with steady system he followed the path long marked out . He stood and looked in at a gunsmith 's window for ten minutes , then moved forward to another . At the shop - fronts of cutlers he also dawdled , but finally returned to the first establishment which had attracted him , entered , and , for the sum of two pounds , purchased a small , five - chambered revolver with a box of cartridges . He then went back to his lodging , and set to work to find the position of Melbury Gardens upon his map . This done the man marked his road to that region , outlining with a red chalk pencil the streets through which he would have to walk before reaching it . Throughout the afternoon he continued his preparations , acting very methodically , and setting his house in order with the deliberation of one who knows that he is going to die , but not immediately . Sometimes he rested from the labor of letter - writing to think and rehearse again the scene which was to close that day . A thousand times he had already done so ; a thousand times the imaginary interview had been the last thought in his waking brain ; but now the approach of reality swept away those unreal dialogues , dramatic entrances , exits and events of the great scene as he had pictured it . The present moment found Noy 's brain blank as to everything but the issue ; and he surprised himself by discovering that his mind now continually recurred to those events which would follow the climax , while yet the death of John Barron was unaccomplished . His active thoughts , under conditions of such excitation as the day had brought upon the top of his discovery , traveled with astounding speed , and it was not John Barron 's end but his own which filled the imagination of the sailor as he wrote . The shadow of the gallows was on the paper , though the event which was to bring this consummation still lay some hours deep in unrecorded time . But , for Noy , John Barron was as good as dead , and himself as good as under sentence of death . Grown quite calm , fixed in mind , and immovable as the black sea cliffs of his mother - land , he wrote steadily on until thought sped whirling forward to a new aspect of his future : the last . He saw himself in eternity , tossed to everlasting flames by his Maker , as a man tosses an empty match - box , after it has done its work , into the fire . He put down his pen and pictured it . The terrific force of that conviction can not fairly be set before the intelligence of average cultured people , because , whatever they profess to believe in their hearts , the truth is that , even with forty - nine Christians out of fifty , hell appears a mere vague conceit meaning nothing . They affirm that they believe in eternal torment ; they confess all humanity is ripe for it ; but their pulses are unquickened by the assertion or admission ; they do not believe in it . Nor can educated man so believe , for that way madness lies , and he who dwells long and closely upon this unutterable dogma , anon himself feels the first flickering of the undying flame . It scorches , not his body , but his brain , and a lunatic asylum presently shuts him from a sane world unless medical aid quickly brings healthy relief . But with primitive opinions , narrow beliefs and narrow intelligences , hell can be a live conceit enough . Among Luke Gospelers and kindred sects there shall be found such genuine fear and such trembling as the church called orthodox never knows ; and to Noy the tremendous spectacle of his everlasting punishment now made itself actively felt . A life beyond death — a life to be spent in one of two places and to endure eternally was to Joe as certain as the knowledge that he lived ; and that his destination must be determined by the work yet lying between him and death appeared equally sure . Further , that work must be performed . There was no loophole of escape from it , and had there been such he would have blocked it against himself resolutely . Moreover , as the will and desire to do the deed was an action as definite in the eye of Heaven as the accomplishment of the deed itself , he reckoned himself already damned . He had long since counted the whole cost , and now it only seemed more vast and awful than upon past surveys by reason of its nearer approach . Now he speculated curiously upon the meetings which must follow upon the world 's dissolution ; and wondered if those who kill do ever meet and hold converse in hell - fire with their victims . Then again he fell to writing , and presently completed letters to his father , his mother , to Mrs. Tregenza and to Mary Chirgwin . These he left in his apartment , and presently going out into the air , walked , with no particular aim , until darkness fell . Hunger now prompted him , and he ate a big meal at a restaurant and drank with his food a pint of ale . Physically fortified , he returned to his lodging , left upon the table in his solitary room the sum he would that night owe for the hire of the chamber , and , then , taking his letters , went out to return no more . A few clothes , a brush and comb and a small wooden trunk was all he left behind him . Joe Noy purchased four stamps for his letters and posted them . They were written as though the murder of John Barron had been already accomplished , and he thus completed and dispatched them before the event , because he imagined that , afterward , the power of communicating with his parents or friends would be denied him . That they might be spared the horror of learning the news through a public source he wrote it thus , and knew , as he did so , that to two of his correspondents the intelligence would come without the full force of a novelty . Thomasin Tregenza and Mary Chirgwin alike were familiar with his intention at the time of his departure , and to them he therefore wrote but briefly ; his parents , on the other hand , for all Joe knew to the contrary , might still be ignorant of the fact that he had come off his cruise . His letters to them were accordingly of great length ; and he set forth therein with the nervous lucidity of a meager vocabulary the nature of his wrongs and the action which he had taken under Heaven 's guidance to revenge them . He stated plainly in all four of his missives to Newlyn , Drift and Mousehole that the artist , John Barron , was shot dead by his hand and that he himself intended suffering the consequent punishment as became a brave man and the weapon of the Lord . These notes then he posted , and so went upon his way that he might fulfill to the letter his written words . Following the roads he had studied upon his map and committed to memory , Noy soon reached Melbury Gardens and presently stood opposite No , 6 and scanned it . The hour was then ten o'clock and lights were in some of the windows , but not many . Looking over the area railings , the sailor saw four servants — two men and two women — eating their supper . He noted , as a singular circumstance , that there were wineglasses upon the kitchen table and that they held red liquor and white . Noy 's design was simple enough . He meant to stand face to face with John Barron , to explain the nature of the events which had occurred , to tell him , what it was possible he might not know : that Joan was dead ; and then to inform him that his own days were numbered . Upon these words Joe designed to shoot the other down like a dog , and to make absolutely certain of his death by firing the entire contents of the revolver . He expected that a private interview would be vouchsafed to him if he desired it ; and his intention , after his victim should fall , was to blow the man 's brains out at close quarters before even those nearest at hand could prevent it . At half - past ten Noy felt that his weapon was in the left breast pocket of his coat ready for the drawing ; then ascended the steps which rose to the front door of John Barron 's dwelling and rang the bell . The man - servant whom he had seen through the area railings in the kitchen came to the door , and , much to Noy 's astonishment , accosted him before he had time to say that he wished to see the master of the house . " You 've come at last , then , " said the man . Joe regarded him with surprise , then spoke . " I want to see Mr. John Barron , please . " The other laughed , as if this was an admirable jest . " I suppose you do , though that 's a queer way to put it . You talk as though you had come to smoke a cigar along with him . " In growing amazement and suspicion , Noy listened to this most curious statement . Fears suddenly awoke that , by some mysterious circumstance , Barron had learned of his contemplated action and was prepared for it . He stopped , therefore , looked about him sharply to avoid any sudden surprise , and put a question to the footman . " You spoke as though I was wanted , " he said . " What do you mean by that ? " " Blessed if you 're
146159	146185	146302	146302	Iss	194	' un ! " answered the man . " Of course you was wanted , else you would n't be here , would you ? You 're
146208	146286	146298	146298	I	0	're the gentleman as everybody requires some time , though nobody ever sends for himself . " Failing to gather the other 's meaning , Noy only realized that John Barron expected some visitor and felt , therefore , the more determined to hasten his own actions . He saw the footman was endeavoring to be jocose , and therefore humored him , pretending at the same time to be the individual who was expected . " You 're
146315	146352	146302	146302	Iss	194	' I should like to see him — the guv'nor — at once if he 'll see me . " The footman chuckled again . " He 'll see you all right . He 's been wantin '
146368	146385	146302	146302	Iss	194	' adn't come . Always awful particular about his clothes , you know , so mind you 're
146391	146460	146461	146461	he	3362	'cause this overcoat will have to last him a long time . " Taking his cue from these words Noy , still ignorant of the truth , made answer : " Iss , I 'll measure en all right . Wheer is he to ? " " In the studio — there you are , right ahead . Knock at that baize door and then walk straight in , 'cause
147337	147339	147344	147344	he	0	' an '
147375	147449	147344	147344	he	0	' fore last — consumption — and he 's left money enough to build a brace of ironclads , they say , and never no will , and not a soul on God 's earth is there with any legal claim upon him . To tell the truth , we none of us never liked him . " " If you 'll shaw me the way out into the street , I 'll thank '
147887	147891	147862	147862	his	251	' nough , an '
147892	147913	147862	147862	his	251	' twill bide so till noon ; then , when the sun begins to slope , the cold will graw an '
147919	147999	147862	147862	his	251	' no harm done , thank God . " He spoke to his niece , who was in the room behind him ; and as he did so a circumstance of very unusual nature happened . Two persons reached the front door of the farm simultaneously , and a maid , answering the double knock , returned a moment later with two communications , both for Mary Chirgwin . " Postman , he brot this here , miss , an '
148409	148679	148694	148694	he	0	' fore anything else . Do n't let it bide a minute and doan't tell none you had it . " Curiosity was no part of Mary Chirgwin 's nature . Now she merely thanked Heaven which had led to the right letter and so enabled her unconsciously to obey Joe 's urgent command . Then she returned to the kitchen , placed his earlier communication in the heart of the fire and watched while it blackened , curled , blazed , and finally shuddered down into a red - hot ash . She determined to see him and walk with him , as he asked , if he returned with clean hands . While the letter which she had read neither proved nor disproved such a supposition , the woman yet felt a secret and sure conviction in her heart that Noy was coming back innocent at least of any desperate action . That he was in Cornwall again and a free man appeared to her proof sufficient that he had not committed violence . Mary allowed her anxiety to interfere with no duty . By three o'clock she was ready to set out , and , looking from her bedroom window as she tied on her hat , she saw Joe Noy approaching up the hill . A minute later she was at the door , and stood there waiting with her eyes upon him as he came up the path . Then she looked down , and to the man it seemed as though she was gazing at his right hand which held a stick . " '
