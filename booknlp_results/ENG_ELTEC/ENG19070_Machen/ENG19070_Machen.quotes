Indeed the living was much depreciated in value , and his own private means were reduced almost to vanishing point , and under such circumstances the great style loses many of its finer savors . He was very fond of Lucian , and cheered by his return , but in the evening he would be a sad man again , with his head resting on one hand , and eyes reproaching sorry fortune . Nobody called out "

She was a respectable person called Deacon , of middle age , and ordinary standards ; and , consequently , there was cold mutton on the table . There was a cake , but nothing of flour , baked in ovens , would rise at Miss Deacon 's evocation . Still , the meal was laid in the beloved "
3189	3782	2917	2918	Mr. Taylor	79	" with the view of hills and valleys and climbing woods from the open window , and the old furniture was still pleasant to see , and the old books in the shelves had many memories . One of the most respected of the armchairs had become weak in the castors and had to be artfully propped up , but Lucian found it very comfortable after the hard forms . When tea was over he went out and strolled in the garden and orchards , and looked over the stile down into the brake , where foxgloves and bracken and broom mingled with the hazel undergrowth , where he knew of secret glades and untracked recesses , deep in the woven green , the cabinets for many years of his lonely meditations . Every path about his home , every field and hedgerow had dear and friendly memories for him ; and the odor of the meadowsweet was better than the incense steaming in the sunshine . He loitered , and hung over the stile till the far - off woods began to turn purple , till the white mists were wreathing in the valley . Day after day , through all that August , morning and evening were wrapped in haze ; day after day the earth shimmered in the heat , and the air was strange , unfamiliar . As he wandered in the lanes and sauntered by the cool sweet verge of the woods , he saw and felt that nothing was common or accustomed , for the sunlight transfigured the meadows and changed all the form of the earth . Under the violent Provençal sun , the elms and beeches looked exotic trees , and in the early morning , when the mists were thick , the hills had put on an unearthly shape . The one adventure of the holidays was the visit to the Roman fort , to that fantastic hill about whose steep bastions and haggard oaks he had seen the flames of sunset writhing nearly three years before . Ever since that Saturday evening in January , the lonely valley had been a desirable place to him ; he had watched the green battlements in summer and winter weather , had seen the heaped mounds rising dimly amidst the drifting rain , had marked the violent height swim up from the ice - white mists of summer evenings , had watched the fairy bulwarks glimmer and vanish in hovering April twilight . In the hedge of the lane there was a gate on which he used to lean and look down south to where the hill surged up so suddenly , its summit defined on summer evenings not only by the rounded ramparts but by the ring of dense green foliage that marked the circle of oak trees . Higher up the lane , on the way he had come that Saturday afternoon , one could see the white walls of Morgan 's farm on the hillside to the north , and on the south there was the stile with the view of old Mrs. Gibbon 's cottage smoke ; but down in the hollow , looking over the gate , there was no hint of human work , except those green and antique battlements , on which the oaks stood in circle , guarding the inner wood . The ring of the fort drew him with stronger fascination during that hot August weather . Standing , or as his headmaster would have said , "
3784	5614	5625	5625	Lucian	73	" by the gate , and looking into that enclosed and secret valley , it seemed to his fancy as if there were a halo about the hill , an aureole that played like flame around it . One afternoon as he gazed from his station by the gate the sheer sides and the swelling bulwarks were more than ever things of enchantment ; the green oak ring stood out against the sky as still and bright as in a picture , and Lucian , in spite of his respect for the law of trespass , slid over the gate . The farmers and their men were busy on the uplands with the harvest , and the adventure was irresistible . At first he stole along by the brook in the shadow of the alders , where the grass and the flowers of wet meadows grew richly ; but as he drew nearer to the fort , and its height now rose sheer above him , he left all shelter , and began desperately to mount . There was not a breath of wind ; the sunlight shone down on the bare hillside ; the loud chirp of the grasshoppers was the only sound . It was a steep ascent and grew steeper as the valley sank away . He turned for a moment , and looked down towards the stream which now seemed to wind remote between the alders ; above the valley there were small dark figures moving in the cornfield , and now and again there came the faint echo of a high - pitched voice singing through the air as on a wire . He was wet with heat ; the sweat streamed off his face , and he could feel it trickling all over his body . But above him the green bastions rose defiant , and the dark ring of oaks promised coolness . He pressed on , and higher , and at last began to crawl up the vallum , on hands and knees , grasping the turf and here and there the roots that had burst through the red earth . And then he lay , panting with deep breaths , on the summit . Within the fort it was all dusky and cool and hollow ; it was as if one stood at the bottom of a great cup . Within , the wall seemed higher than without , and the ring of oaks curved up like a dark green vault . There were nettles growing thick and rank in the foss ; they looked different from the common nettles in the lanes , and Lucian , letting his hand touch a leaf by accident , felt the sting burn like fire . Beyond the ditch there was an undergrowth , a dense thicket of trees , stunted and old , crooked and withered by the winds into awkward and ugly forms ; beech and oak and hazel and ash and yew twisted and so shortened and deformed that each seemed , like the nettle , of no common kind . He began to fight his way through the ugly growth , stumbling and getting hard knocks from the rebound of twisted boughs . His foot struck once or twice against something harder than wood , and looking down he saw stones white with the leprosy of age , but still showing the work of the axe . And farther , the roots of the stunted trees gripped the foot - high relics of a wall ; and a round heap of fallen stones nourished rank , unknown herbs , that smelt poisonous . The earth was black and unctuous , and bubbling under the feet , left no track behind . From it , in the darkest places where the shadow was thickest , swelled the growth of an abominable fungus , making the still air sick with its corrupt odor , and he shuddered as he felt the horrible thing pulped beneath his feet . Then there was a gleam of sunlight , and as he thrust the last boughs apart , he stumbled into the open space in the heart of the camp . It was a lawn of sweet close turf in the center of the matted brake , of clean firm earth from which no shameful growth sprouted , and near the middle of the glade was a stump of a felled yew - tree , left untrimmed by the woodman . Lucian thought it must have been made for a seat ; a crooked bough through which a little sap still ran was a support for the back , and he sat down and rested after his toil . It was not really so comfortable a seat as one of the school forms , but the satisfaction was to find anything at all that would serve for a chair . He sat there , still panting after the climb and his struggle through the dank and jungle - like thicket , and he felt as if he were growing hotter and hotter ; the sting of the nettle was burning his hand , and the tingling fire seemed to spread all over his body . Suddenly , he knew that he was alone . Not merely solitary ; that he had often been amongst the woods and deep in the lanes ; but now it was a wholly different and a very strange sensation . He thought of the valley winding far below him , all its fields by the brook green and peaceful and still , without path or track . Then he had climbed the abrupt surge of the hill , and passing the green and swelling battlements , the ring of oaks , and the matted thicket , had come to the central space . And behind there were , he knew , many desolate fields , wild as common , untrodden , unvisited . He was utterly alone . He still grew hotter as he sat on the stump , and at last lay down at full length on the soft grass , and more at his ease felt the waves of heat pass over his body . And then he began to dream , to let his fancies stray over half - imagined , delicious things , indulging a virgin mind in its wanderings . The hot air seemed to beat upon him in palpable waves , and the nettle sting tingled and itched intolerably ; and he was alone upon the fairy hill , within the great mounds , within the ring of oaks , deep in the heart of the matted thicket . Slowly and timidly he began to untie his boots , fumbling with the laces , and glancing all the while on every side at the ugly misshapen trees that hedged the lawn . Not a branch was straight , not one was free , but all were interlaced and grew one about another ; and just above ground , where the cankered stems joined the protuberant roots , there were forms that imitated the human shape , and faces and twining limbs that amazed him . Green mosses were hair , and tresses were stark in grey lichen ; a twisted root swelled into a limb ; in the hollows of the rotted bark he saw the masks of men . His eyes were fixed and fascinated by the simulacra of the wood , and could not see his hands , and so at last , and suddenly , it seemed , he lay in the sunlight , beautiful with his olive skin , dark haired , dark eyed , the gleaming bodily vision of a strayed faun . Quick flames now quivered in the substance of his nerves , hints of mysteries , secrets of life passed trembling through his brain , unknown desires stung him . As he gazed across the turf and into the thicket , the sunshine seemed really to become green , and the contrast between the bright glow poured on the lawn and the black shadow of the brake made an odd flickering light , in which all the grotesque postures of stem and root began to stir ; the wood was alive . The turf beneath him heaved and sank as with the deep swell of the sea . He fell asleep , and lay still on the grass , in the midst of the thicket . He found out afterwards that he must have slept for nearly an hour . The shadows had changed when he awoke ; his senses came to him with a sudden shock , and he sat up and stared at his bare limbs in stupid amazement . He huddled on his clothes and laced his boots , wondering what folly had beset him . Then , while he stood indecisive , hesitating , his brain a whirl of puzzled thought , his body trembling , his hands shaking ; as with electric heat , sudden remembrance possessed him . A flaming blush shone red on his cheeks , and glowed and thrilled through his limbs . As he awoke , a brief and slight breeze had stirred in a nook of the matted boughs , and there was a glinting that might have been the flash of sudden sunlight across shadow , and the branches rustled and murmured for a moment , perhaps at the wind 's passage . He stretched out his hands , and cried to his visitant to return ; he entreated the dark eyes that had shone over him , and the scarlet lips that had kissed him . And then panic fear rushed into his heart , and he ran blindly , dashing through the wood . He climbed the vallum , and looked out , crouching , lest anybody should see him . Only the shadows were changed , and a breath of cooler air mounted from the brook ; the fields were still and peaceful , the black figures moved , far away , amidst the corn , and the faint echo of the high - pitched voices sang thin and distant on the evening wind . Across the stream , in the cleft on the hill , opposite to the fort , the blue wood smoke stole up a spiral pillar from the chimney of old Mrs. Gibbon 's cottage . He began to run full tilt down the steep surge of the hill , and never stopped till he was over the gate and in the lane again . As he looked back , down the valley to the south , and saw the violent ascent , the green swelling bulwarks , and the dark ring of oaks ; the sunlight seemed to play about the fort with an aureole of flame . "

5687	5710	5676	5676	I	0	" He muttered something about being rather tired , and sat down to his tea . It was not cold , for the "
5712	5874	5884	5884	Lucian	73	" had been put over the pot , but it was black and bitter strong , as his cousin expressed it . The draught was unpalatable , but it did him good , and the thought came with great consolation that he had only been asleep and dreaming queer , nightmarish dreams . He shook off all his fancies with resolution , and thought the loneliness of the camp , and the burning sunlight , and possibly the nettle sting , which still tingled most abominably , must have been the only factors in his farrago of impossible recollections . He remembered that when he had felt the sting , he had seized a nettle with thick folds of his handkerchief , and having twisted off a good length , and put it in his pocket to show his father . Mr. Taylor was almost interested when he came in from his evening stroll about the garden and saw the specimen . "

There was a boy named De Carti there ; he is staying with the Dixons . Mrs. Dixon whispered to me when we were going in to tea , ' He 's a second cousin of Lord De Carti 's , ' and she looked quite grave as if she were in church . "
7230	7243	7244	7244	he	1635	" Baron De Carti 's great - grandfather was a Dublin attorney , "
7247	7293	7429	7430	the bishop	376	" Which his name was Jeremiah M'Carthy . His prejudiced fellow - citizens called him the Unjust Steward , also the Bloody Attorney , and I believe that ' to hell with M'Carthy ' was quite a popular cry about the time of the Union . "

7709	7775	7834	7834	he	73	" so I thought he would enjoy a good wholesome tea for once in a way . But he is such an unsatisfactory boy , he would only have one slice of that nice plain cake , and I could n't get him to take more than two plums . They were really quite ripe too , and boys are usually so fond of fruit . "
7851	7854	8160	8160	he	73	" mooning , "
8152	8159	8160	8160	he	73	" Good afternoon , Master Lucian , "
8163	8215	8508	8516	tiles with raised initials and a date.â€”I.M. , 1684	1766	" Mr. Taylor pretty well , I suppose ? I be goin' to the house a minute ; the men in the fields are wantin ' some more cider . Would you come and taste a drop of cider , Master Lucian ? It 's very good , sir , indeed . "

8530	8534	8535	8535	Annie	75	" said Morgan . "

8579	8695	8709	8709	sir	1765	" came the voice from the dairy and presently the girl entered , wiping the jug she held . In his boyish way Lucian had been a good deal disturbed by Annie Morgan ; he could see her on Sundays from his seat in church , and her skin , curiously pale , her lips that seemed as though they were stained with some brilliant pigment , her black hair , and the quivering black eyes , gave him odd fancies which he had hardly shaped to himself . Annie had grown into a woman in three years , and he was still a boy . She came into the kitchen , curtsying and smiling . "

8725	8726	8750	8750	I	0	" "
8759	8817	8750	8750	I	0	" Lucian grinned and felt uncomfortable , and the girl set down the jug on the round table and brought a glass from the dresser . She bent close over him as she poured out the green oily cider , fragrant of the orchard ; her hand touched his shoulder for a moment , and she said , "
8825	8907	8912	8912	sir	1765	" very prettily . He looked up eagerly at her face ; the black eyes , a little oval in shape , were shining , and the lips smiled . Annie wore a plain dress of some black stuff , open at the throat ; her skin was beautiful . For a moment the ghost of a fancy hovered unsubstantial in his mind ; and then Annie curtsied as she handed him the cider , and replied to his thanks with , "
8914	8989	8992	8992	you	1765	" The drink was really good ; not thin , nor sweet , but round and full and generous , with a fine yellow flame twinkling through the green when one held it up to the light . It was like a stray sunbeam hovering on the grass in a deep orchard , and he swallowed the glassful with relish , and had some more , warmly commending it . Mr. Morgan was touched . "
9001	9005	9143	9143	I	0	" he said . "
9146	9194	9199	9201	a beautiful baby	540	" Lucian said he should like an apple very much , and the farmer went out by another door , and Annie stayed in the kitchen talking . She said Mrs. Trevor , her married sister , was coming to them soon to spend a few days . "
9203	9207	9271	9271	sir	1765	" said Annie , "
9273	9274	9282	9282	you	1765	" "
9284	9289	9290	9290	I	0	" said the boy . "
9299	9300	9323	9323	He	73	" "
9321	9322	9329	9329	I	0	" "
9333	9338	9508	9509	Master Lucian	73	" said the farmer . "
9364	9505	9508	9509	Master Lucian	73	" Lucian did not find the Blenheim Orange as good as the cider , but he ate it with all the appearance of relish , and put another , with thanks , in his pocket . He thanked the farmer again when he got up to go ; and Annie curtsied and smiled , and wished him good - day , and welcome , kindly . Lucian heard her saying to her father as he went out what a nice - mannered young gentleman he was getting , to be sure ; and he went on his way , thinking that Annie was really very pretty , and speculating as to whether he would have the courage to kiss her , if they met in a dark lane . He was quite sure she would only laugh , and say , "
9511	9869	10068	10068	she	91	" For many months he had occasional fits of recollection , both cold and hot ; but the bridge of time , gradually lengthening , made those dreadful and delicious images grow more and more indistinct , till at last they all passed into that wonderland which a youth looks back upon in amazement , not knowing why this used to be a symbol of terror or that of joy . At the end of each term he would come home and find his father a little more despondent , and harder to cheer even for a moment ; and the wall paper and the furniture grew more and more dingy and shabby . The two cats , loved and ancient beasts , that he remembered when he was quite a little boy , before he went to school , died miserably , one after the other . Old Polly , the pony , at last fell down in the stable from the weakness of old age , and had to be killed there ; the battered old trap ran no longer along the well - remembered lanes . There was long meadow grass on the lawn , and the trained fruit trees on the wall had got quite out of hand . At last , when Lucian was seventeen , his father was obliged to take him from school ; he could no longer afford the fees . This was the sorry ending of many hopes , and dreams of a double - first , a fellowship , distinction and glory that the poor parson had long entertained for his son , and the two moped together , in the shabby room , one on each side of the sulky fire , thinking of dead days and finished plans , and seeing a grey future in the years that advanced towards them . At one time there seemed some chance of a distant relative coming forward to Lucian 's assistance ; and indeed it was quite settled that he should go up to London with certain definite aims . Mr. Taylor told the good news to his acquaintancesâ€”his
10057	10067	10085	10085	he	490	" Are n't Mr. Taylor 's views very extreme ? "
10077	10084	10068	10068	she	91	" I am afraid they are , "
10088	10147	10068	10068	she	91	" I was quite grieved at the last Diocesan Conference at the way in which he spoke . The dear old bishop had given an address on Auricular Confession ; he was forced to do so , you know , after what had happened , and I must say that I never felt prouder of our beloved Church . "

Has Mr. Taylor forgotten the vows he took at his ordination ? But do n't you think , dear , I am right , and that he has been punished : ' The sins of the fathers ' ? "

10591	10728	10861	10862	his father	341	alchemistsâ€”all these were his delight . Such were his companions , with the hills and hanging woods , the brooks and lonely waterpools ; books , the thoughts of books , the stirrings of imagination , all fused into one phantasy by the magic of the outland country . He held himself aloof from the walls of the fort ; he was content to see the heaped mounds , the violent height with faerie bulwarks , from the gate in the lane , and to leave all within the ring of oaks in the mystery of his boyhood 's vision . He professed to laugh at himself and at his fancies of that hot August afternoon , when sleep came to him within the thicket , but in his heart of hearts there was something that never fadedâ€”something
10876	10886	10861	10862	his father	341	writeâ€”in the old days at Oxford , he added . "
10893	10898	10900	10900	I	0	" said the parson ; "
10915	11316	11346	11346	he	579	" So he pottered on ; reading everything , imitating what struck his fancy , attempting the effect of the classic meters in English verse , trying his hand at a masque , a Restoration comedy , forming impossible plans for books which rarely got beyond half a dozen lines on a sheet of paper ; beset with splendid fancies which refused to abide before the pen . But the vain joy of conception was not altogether vain , for it gave him some armor about his heart . The months went by , monotonous , and sometimes blotted with despair . He wrote and planned and filled the waste - paper basket with hopeless efforts . Now and then he sent verses or prose articles to magazines , in pathetic ignorance of the trade . He felt the immense difficulty of the career of literature without clearly understanding it ; the battle was happily in a mist , so that the host of the enemy , terribly arrayed , was to some extent hidden . Yet there was enough of difficulty to appall ; from following the intricate course of little nameless brooks , from hushed twilight woods , from the vision of the mountains , and the breath of the great wind , passing from deep to deep , he would come home filled with thoughts and emotions , mystic fancies which he yearned to translate into the written word . And the result of the effort seemed always to be bathos ! Wooden sentences , a portentous stilted style , obscurity , and awkwardness clogged the pen ; it seemed impossible to win the great secret of language ; the stars glittered only in the darkness , and vanished away in clearer light . The periods of despair were often long and heavy , the victories very few and trifling ; night after night he sat writing after his father had knocked out his last pipe , filling a page with difficulty in an hour , and usually forced to thrust the stuff away in despair , and go unhappily to bed , conscious that after all his labor he had done nothing . And these were moments when the accustomed vision of the land alarmed him , and the wild domed hills and darkling woods seemed symbols of some terrible secret in the inner life of that strangerâ€”himself

Harmless amusement , a gentle flow of domestic interest , a faithful reproduction of the open and manly life of the hunting field , pictures of innocent and healthy English girlhood such as Miss Sanders here affords us ; these are the topics that will always find a welcome in our homes , which remain bolted and barred against the abandoned artist and the scrofulous stylist .

14200	14274	14196	14196	he	73	Ritsonâ€”that old literary hand had by no means stolen his book wholesale , as he had expected . There were about two hundred pages in the pretty little volume , and of these about ninety were Lucian 's , dovetailed into a rather different scheme with skill that was nothing short of exquisite . And Mr. Ritson 's own work was often very good ; spoilt here and there for some tastes by the "
14276	14396	14199	14203	Mr. Ritsonâ€”that old literary hand	1850	" method , a somewhat materialistic way of taking an inventory of the holy country things ; but , for that very reason , contrasting to a great advantage with Lucian 's hints and dreams and note of haunting . And here and there Mr. Ritson had made little alterations in the style of the passages he had conveyed , and most of these alterations were amendments , as Lucian was obliged to confess , though he would have liked to argue one or two points with his collaborator and corrector . He lit his pipe and leant back comfortably in the hedge , thinking things over , weighing very coolly his experience of humanity , his contact with the "
14398	14506	14527	14528	Mr. Dixon	92	" of the countryside , the affair of the The Chorus in Green , and even some little incidents that had struck him as he was walking through the streets of Caermaen that evening . At the post - office , when he was inquiring for his parcel , he had heard two old women grumbling in the street ; it seemed , so far as he could make out , that both had been disappointed in much the same way . One was a Roman Catholic , hardened , and beyond the reach of conversion ; she had been advised to ask alms of the priests , "
14515	14526	14607	14608	Mr. Dixon	92	" The other old sinner was a Dissenter , and , "
14540	14606	14607	14608	Mr. Dixon	92	" Mrs. Dixon , assisted by Henrietta , was , it seemed , the lady high almoner , who dispensed these charities . As she said to Mrs. Colley , they would end by keeping all the beggars in the county , and they really could n't afford it . A large family was an expensive thing , and the girls must have new frocks . "
14627	14671	14607	14608	Mr. Dixon	92	" Lucian had heard of these sage counsels , and through it them as he listened to the bitter complaints of the gaunt , hungry old women . In the back street by which he passed out of the town he saw a large "
14673	14755	14760	14765	the Lord Bishop of the Diocese	655	" boy kicking a sick cat ; the poor creature had just strength enough to crawl under an outhouse door ; probably to die in torments . He did not find much satisfaction in thrashing the boy , but he did it with hearty good will . Further on , at the corner where the turnpike used to be , was a big notice , announcing a meeting at the school - room in aid of the missions to the Portuguese . "
14767	14814	14760	14765	the Lord Bishop of the Diocese	655	" was the imposing headline ; the Reverend Merivale Dixon , vicar of Caermaen , was to be in the chair , supported by Stanley Gervase , Esq . , J.P. , and by many of the clergy and gentry of the neighborhood . Senhor Diabo , "
14826	14832	14760	14765	the Lord Bishop of the Diocese	655	" would address the meeting . "
14844	14989	14760	14765	the Lord Bishop of the Diocese	655	" concluded the notice . So he lay well back in the shade of the hedge , and thought whether some sort of an article could not be made by vindicating the terrible Yahoos ; one might point out that they were in many respects a simple and unsophisticated race , whose faults were the result of their enslaved position , while such virtues as they had were all their own . They might be compared , he thought , much to their advantage , with more complex civilizations . There was no hint of anything like the Beit system of publishing in existence amongst them ; the great Yahoo nation would surely never feed and encourage a scabby Houyhnhnm , expelled for his foulness from the horse - community , and the witty dean , in all his minuteness , had said nothing of "
14991	15378	14760	14765	the Lord Bishop of the Diocese	655	" Yahoos . On reflection , however , he did not feel quite secure of this part of his defense ; he remembered that the leading brutes had favorites , who were employed in certain simple domestic offices about their masters , and it seemed doubtful whether the contemplated vindication would not break down on this point . He smiled queerly to himself as he thought of these comparisons , but his heart burned with a dull fury . Throwing back his unhappy memory , he recalled all the contempt and scorn he had suffered ; as a boy he had heard the masters murmuring their disdain of him and of his desire to learn other than ordinary school work . As a young man he had suffered the insolence of these wretched people about him ; their cackling laughter at his poverty jarred and grated in his ears ; he saw the acrid grin of some miserable idiot woman , some creature beneath the swine in intelligence and manners , merciless , as he went by with his eyes on the dust , in his ragged clothes . He and his father seemed to pass down an avenue of jeers and contempt , and contempt from such animals as these ! This putrid filth , molded into human shape , made only to fawn on the rich and beslaver them , thinking no foulness too foul if it were done in honor of those in power and authority ; and no refined cruelty of contempt too cruel if it were contempt of the poor and humble and oppressed ; it was to this obscene and ghastly throng that he was something to be pointed at . And these men and women spoke of sacred things , and knelt before the awful altar of God , before the altar of tremendous fire , surrounded as they professed by Angels and Archangels and all the Company of Heaven ; and in their very church they had one aisle for the rich and another for the poor . And the species was not peculiar to Caermaen ; the rich business men in London and the successful brother author were probably amusing themselves at the expense of the poor struggling creature they had injured and wounded ; just as the "
15380	15512	15513	15513	I	0	" boy had burst into a great laugh when the miserable sick cat cried out in bitter agony , and trailed its limbs slowly , as it crept away to die . Lucian looked into his own life and his own will ; he saw that in spite of his follies , and his want of success , he had not been consciously malignant , he had never deliberately aided in oppression , or looked on it with enjoyment and approval , and he felt that when he lay dead beneath the earth , eaten by swarming worms , he would be in a purer company than now , when he lived amongst human creatures . And he was to call this loathsome beast , all sting and filth , brother ! "
15522	15529	15513	15513	I	0	" he said in his heart , "
15537	15608	15513	15513	I	0	" Blood was in his eyes , and as he looked up the sky seemed of blood , and the earth burned with fire . The sun was sinking low on the mountain when he set out on the way again . Burrows , the doctor , coming home in his trap , met him a little lower on the road , and gave him a friendly good - night . "
15621	15626	15646	15646	You	0	" said the doctor . "
15666	17493	17497	17498	Master Lucian	73	" He thanked Dr. Burrows and said he would try the short cut , and Burrows span on homeward . He was a gruff and honest bachelor , and often felt very sorry for the lad , and wished he could help him . As he drove on , it suddenly occurred to him that Lucian had an awful look on his face , and he was sorry he had not asked him to jump in , and to come to supper . A hearty slice of beef , with strong ale , whisky and soda afterwards , a good pipe , and certain Rabelaisian tales which the doctor had treasured for many years , would have done the poor fellow a lot of good , he was certain . He half turned round on his seat , and looked to see if Lucian were still in sight , but he had passed the corner , and the doctor drove on , shivering a little ; the mists were beginning to rise from the wet banks of the river . Lucian trailed slowly along the road , keeping a look out for the stile the doctor had mentioned . It would be a little of an adventure , he thought , to find his way by an unknown track ; he knew the direction in which his home lay , and he imagined he would not have much difficulty in crossing from one stile to another . The path led him up a steep bare field , and when he was at the top , the town and the valley winding up to the north stretched before him . The river was stilled at the flood , and the yellow water , reflecting the sunset , glowed in its deep pools like dull brass . These burning pools , the level meadows fringed with shuddering reeds , the long dark sweep of the forest on the hill , were all clear and distinct , yet the light seemed to have clothed them with a new garment , even as voices from the streets of Caermaen sounded strangely , mounting up thin with the smoke . There beneath him lay the huddled cluster of Caermaen , the ragged and uneven roofs that marked the winding and sordid streets , here and there a pointed gable rising above its meaner fellows ; beyond he recognized the piled mounds that marked the circle of the amphitheatre , and the dark edge of trees that grew where the Roman wall whitened and waxed old beneath the frosts and rains of eighteen hundred years . Thin and strange , mingled together , the voices came up to him on the hill ; it was as if an outland race inhabited the ruined city and talked in a strange language of strange and terrible things . The sun had slid down the sky , and hung quivering over the huge dark dome of the mountain like a burnt sacrifice , and then suddenly vanished . In the afterglow the clouds began to writhe and turn scarlet , and shone so strangely reflected in the pools of the snake - like river , that one would have said the still waters stirred , the fleeting and changing of the clouds seeming to quicken the stream , as if it bubbled and sent up gouts of blood . But already about the town the darkness was forming ; fast , fast the shadows crept upon it from the forest , and from all sides banks and wreaths of curling mist were gathering , as if a ghostly leaguer were being built up against the city , and the strange race who lived in its streets . Suddenly there burst out from the stillness the clear and piercing music of the réveillé , calling , recalling , iterated , reiterated , and ending with one long high fierce shrill note with which the steep hills rang . Perhaps a boy in the school band was practicing on his bugle , but for Lucian it was magic . For him it was the note of the Roman trumpet , tuba mirum spargens sonum , filling all the hollow valley with its command , reverberated in dark places in the far forest , and resonant in the old graveyards without the walls . In his imagination he saw the earthen gates of the tombs broken open , and the serried legion swarming to the eagles . Century by century they passed by ; they rose , dripping , from the river bed , they rose from the level , their armor shone in the quiet orchard , they gathered in ranks and companies from the cemetery , and as the trumpet sounded , the hill fort above the town gave up its dead . By hundreds and thousands the ghostly battle surged about the standard , behind the quaking mist , ready to march against the moldering walls they had built so many years before . He turned sharply ; it was growing very dark , and he was afraid of missing his way . At first the path led him by the verge of a wood ; there was a noise of rustling and murmuring from the trees as if they were taking evil counsel together . A high hedge shut out the sight of the darkening valley , and he stumbled on mechanically , without taking much note of the turnings of the track , and when he came out from the wood shadow to the open country , he stood for a moment quite bewildered and uncertain . A dark wild twilight country lay before him , confused dim shapes of trees near at hand , and a hollow below his feet , and the further hills and woods were dimmer , and all the air was very still . Suddenly the darkness about him glowed ; a furnace fire had shot up on the mountain , and for a moment the little world of the woodside and the steep hill shone in a pale light , and he thought he saw his path beaten out in the turf before him . The great flame sank down to a red glint of fire , and it led him on down the ragged slope , his feet striking against ridges of ground , and falling from beneath him at a sudden dip . The bramble bushes shot out long prickly vines , amongst which he was entangled , and lower he was held back by wet bubbling earth . He had descended into a dark and shady valley , beset and tapestried with gloomy thickets ; the weird wood noises were the only sounds , strange , unutterable mutterings , dismal , inarticulate . He pushed on in what he hoped was the right direction , stumbling from stile to gate , peering through mist and shadow , and still vainly seeking for any known landmark . Presently another sound broke upon the grim air , the murmur of water poured over stones , gurgling against the old misshapen roots of trees , and running clear in a deep channel . He passed into the chill breath of the brook , and almost fancied he heard two voices speaking in its murmur ; there seemed a ceaseless utterance of words , an endless argument . With a mood of horror pressing on him , he listened to the noise of waters , and the wild fancy seized him that he was not deceived , that two unknown beings stood together there in the darkness and tried the balances of his life , and spoke his doom . The hour in the matted thicket rushed over the great bridge of years to his thought ; he had sinned against the earth , and the earth trembled and shook for vengeance . He stayed still for a moment , quivering with fear , and at last went on blindly , no longer caring for the path , if only he might escape from the toils of that dismal shuddering hollow . As he plunged through the hedges the bristling thorns tore his face and hands ; he fell amongst stinging - nettles and was pricked as he beat out his way amidst the gorse . He raced headlong , his head over his shoulder , through a windy wood , bare of undergrowth ; there lay about the ground moldering stumps , the relics of trees that had thundered to their fall , crashing and tearing to earth , long ago ; and from these remains there flowed out a pale thin radiance , filling the spaces of the sounding wood with a dream of light . He had lost all count of the track ; he felt he had fled for hours , climbing and descending , and yet not advancing ; it was as if he stood still and the shadows of the land went by , in a vision . But at last a hedge , high and straggling , rose before him , and as he broke through it , his feet slipped , and he fell headlong down a steep bank into a lane . He lay still , half - stunned , for a moment , and then rising unsteadily , he looked desperately into the darkness before him , uncertain and bewildered . In front it was black as a midnight cellar , and he turned about , and saw a glint in the distance , as if a candle were flickering in a farm - house window . He began to walk with trembling feet towards the light , when suddenly something pale started out from the shadows before him , and seemed to swim and float down the air . He was going down hill , and he hastened onwards , and he could see the bars of a stile framed dimly against the sky , and the figure still advanced with that gliding motion . Then , as the road declined to the valley , the landmark he had been seeking appeared . To his right there surged up in the darkness the darker summit of the Roman fort , and the streaming fire of the great full moon glowed through the bars of the wizard oaks , and made a halo shine about the hill . He was now quite close to the white appearance , and saw that it was only a woman walking swiftly down the lane ; the floating movement was an effect due to the somber air and the moon 's glamour . At the gate , where he had spent so many hours gazing at the fort , they walked foot to foot , and he saw it was Annie Morgan . "
17500	17505	17497	17498	Master Lucian	73	" said the girl , "
17515	17516	17520	17520	Annie	75	" "
17522	17545	17559	17559	sir	1765	" he answered , calling her by her name for the first time , and he saw that she smiled with pleasure . "
17555	17556	17588	17588	nobody	1639	" "
17595	17616	17588	17588	nobody	1639	" Then there were really people who helped one another ; kindness and pity were not mere myths , fictions of "
17619	17665	17588	17588	nobody	1639	" as useful as Doe and Roe , and as non - existent . The thought struck Lucian with a shock ; the evening 's passion and delirium , the wild walk and physical fatigue had almost shattered him in body and mind . He was "
17668	17695	17765	17766	a bounder	666	" decadent , and the rough rains and blustering winds of life , which a stronger man would have laughed at and enjoyed , were to him "
17704	17762	17775	17777	a shoddy lot	667	" After all , Messrs Beit , the publishers , were only sharp men of business , and these terrible Dixons and Gervases and Colleys merely the ordinary limited clergy and gentry of a quiet country town ; sturdier sense would have dismissed Dixon as an old humbug , Stanley Gervase , Esquire , J.P. , as a "
17768	17773	17775	17777	a shoddy lot	667	" and the ladies as "
17779	17847	17848	17848	I	0	" But he was walking slowly now in painful silence , his heavy , lagging feet striking against the loose stones . He was not thinking of the girl beside him ; only something seemed to swell and grow and swell within his heart ; it was all the torture of his days , weary hopes and weary disappointment , scorn rankling and throbbing , and the thought "
17863	17962	17997	17997	I	0	" He choked and gasped for breath , and felt involuntary muscles working in his face , and the impulses of a madman stirring him ; he himself was in truth the realization of the vision of Caermaen that night , a city with moldering walls beset by the ghostly legion . Life and the world and the laws of the sunlight had passed away , and the resurrection and kingdom of the dead began . The Celt assailed him , becoming from the weird wood he called the world , and his far - off ancestors , the "
17966	17996	18009	18009	you	0	" crept out of their caves , muttering charms and incantations in hissing inhuman speech ; he was beleaguered by desires that had slept in his race for ages . "
18022	18286	18313	18313	My	0	" He had stumbled against a great round stone and had nearly fallen . The woman 's hand sought his in the darkness ; as he felt the touch of the soft warm flesh he moaned , and a pang shot through his arm to his heart . He looked up and found he had only walked a few paces since Annie had spoken ; he had thought they had wandered for hours together . The moon was just mounting above the oaks , and the halo round the dark hill brightened . He stopped short , and keeping his hold of Annie 's hand , looked into her face . A hazy glory of moonlight shone around them and lit up their eyes . He had not greatly altered since his boyhood ; his face was pale olive in color , thin and oval ; marks of pain had gathered about the eyes , and his black hair was already stricken with grey . But the eager , curious gaze still remained , and what he saw before him lit up his sadness with a new fire . She stopped too , and did not offer to draw away , but looked back with all her heart . They were alike in many ways ; her skin was also of that olive color , but her face was sweet as a beautiful summer night , and her black eyes showed no dimness , and the smile on the scarlet lips was like a flame when it brightens a dark and lonely land . "
18304	18312	18313	18313	My	0	" It was Lucian who spoke next : "
18319	18443	18473	18473	they	674	" And their lips were together again , and their arms locked together , each holding the other fast . And then the poor lad let his head sink down on his sweetheart 's breast , and burst into a passion of weeping . The tears streamed down his face , and he shook with sobbing , in the happiest moment that he had ever lived . The woman bent over him and tried to comfort him , but his tears were his consolation and his triumph . Annie was whispering to him , her hand laid on his heart ; she was whispering beautiful , wonderful words , that soothed him as a song . He did not know what they meant . "
18476	18494	18519	18519	you	75	" She laughed , and said it was only nonsense that the nurses sang to the children . "
18510	18518	18682	18682	You	676	" he said , when they parted , "
18536	18681	18688	18688	you	676	" He fell down before her , embracing her knees , and adored , and she allowed him , and confirmed his worship . He followed slowly after her , passing the path which led to her home with a longing glance . Nobody saw any difference in Lucian when he reached the rectory . He came in with his usual dreamy indifference , and told how he had lost his way by trying the short cut . He said he had met Dr. Burrows on the road , and that he had recommended the path by the fields . Then , as dully as if he had been reading some story out of a newspaper , he gave his father the outlines of the Beit case , producing the pretty little book called The Chorus in Green . The parson listened in amazement . "
18693	18702	18766	18766	you	676	" he said . He was quite roused . "
18738	18764	18793	18793	they	677	" He closed the book without interest , and indeed he felt astonished at his father 's excitement . The incident seemed to him unimportant . "
18787	18788	18796	18796	I	0	" "
18811	18840	18796	18796	I	0	" The manuscript was duly produced , wrapped in brown paper , with Messrs Beit 's address label on it , and the post - office dated stamps . "
18851	18897	18905	18907	My poor fellow	678	" The parson , forgetting the sacerdotal office , and his good habit of grinning , swore at Messrs Beit and Mr. Ritson , calling them damned thieves , and then began to read the manuscript , and to compare it with the printed book . "
18909	18916	18992	18992	you	676	" he said after a while , "
18998	19155	19185	19185	You	682	" Lucian was mildly amused ; he could n't enter into his father 's feelings at all . He sat smoking in one of the old easy chairs , taking the rare relish of a hot grog with his pipe , and gazing out of his dreamy eyes at the violent old parson . He was pleased that his father liked his book , because he knew him to be a deep and sober scholar and a cool judge of good letters ; but he laughed to himself when he saw the magic of print . The parson had expressed no wish to read the manuscript when it came back in disgrace ; he had merely grinned , said something about boomerangs , and quoted Horace with relish . Whereas now , before the book in its neat case , lettered with another man 's name , his approbation of the writing and his disapproval of the "
19158	19184	19196	19196	you	682	" as he called them , were loudly expressed , and , though a good smoker , he blew and puffed vehemently at his pipe . "
19198	19203	19319	19319	he	0	" he said again . "
19310	19318	19319	19319	he	0	ideaâ€”the heart , as I call it , "
19326	19371	19564	19564	they	685	" It 's like having a box you ca n't open , though you know there 's something wonderful inside . But I do believe I 've a fine thing in my hands , and I mean to try my best to work it . "
19460	19517	19554	19554	They	685	faithâ€”that literary success is a matter of very little importance . He thought well of books , but only of printed books ; in manuscripts he put no faith , and the paulo - post - futurum tense he could not in any manner conjugate . He returned once more to the topic of palpable interest . "
19552	19553	19723	19723	I	0	" "
19732	19739	19752	19752	I	0	" Lucian went on , chuckling , "
19759	19760	19788	19788	you	578	" "
19791	19792	19788	19788	you	578	" "
19799	20447	20476	20476	You	699	" said Lucian , and he really thought so . He had sweeter things to dream of , and desired no communion of feeling with that madman who had left Caermaen some few hours before . He felt he had made a fool of himself , he was ashamed to think of the fatuity of which he had been guilty , such boiling hatred was not only wicked , but absurd . A man could do no good who put himself into a position of such violent antagonism against his fellow - creatures ; so Lucian rebuked his heart , saying that he was old enough to know better . But he remembered that he had sweeter things to dream of ; there was a secret ecstasy that he treasured and locked tight away , as a joy too exquisite even for thought till he was quite alone ; and then there was that scheme for a new book that he had laid down hopelessly some time ago ; it seemed to have arisen into life again within the last hour ; he understood that he had started on a false tack , he had taken the wrong aspect of his idea . Of course the thing could n't be written in that way ; it was like trying to read a page turned upside down ; and he saw those characters he had vainly sought suddenly disambushed , and a splendid inevitable sequence of events unrolled before him . It was a true resurrection ; the dry plot he had constructed revealed itself as a living thing , stirring and mysterious , and warm as life itself . The parson was smoking stolidly to all appearance , but in reality he was full of amazement at his own son , and now and again he slipped sly furtive glances towards the tranquil young man in the arm - chair by the empty hearth . In the first place , Mr. Taylor was genuinely impressed by what he had read of Lucian 's work ; he had so long been accustomed to look upon all effort as futile that success amazed him . In the abstract , of course , he was prepared to admit that some people did write well and got published and made money , just as other persons successfully backed an outsider at heavy odds ; but it had seemed as improbable that Lucian should show even the beginnings of achievement in one direction as in the other . Then the boy evidently cared so little about it ; he did not appear to be proud of being worth robbing , nor was he angry with the robbers . He sat back luxuriously in the disreputable old chair , drawing long slow wreaths of smoke , tasting his whisky from time to time , evidently well at ease with himself . The father saw him smile , and it suddenly dawned upon him that his son was very handsome ; he had such kind gentle eyes and a kind mouth , and his pale cheeks were flushed like a girl 's . Mr. Taylor felt moved . What a harmless young fellow Lucian had been ; no doubt a little queer and different from others , but wholly inoffensive and patient under disappointment . And Miss Deacon , her contribution to the evening 's discussion had been characteristic ; she had remarked , firstly , that writing was a very unsettling occupation , and secondly , that it was extremely foolish to entrust one 's property to people of whom one knew nothing . Father and son had smiled together at these observations , which were probably true enough . Mr. Taylor at last left Lucian along ; he shook hands with a good deal of respect , and said , almost deferentially : "
20486	20487	20476	20476	You	699	" "
20509	21003	21183	21184	his father	341	" ; and the young man laughed a gay sweet laugh that struck the father as a new note in his son 's life . He sat still a moment after his father had left the room . He cherished his chief treasure of thought in its secret place ; he would not enjoy it yet . He drew up a chair to the table at which he wrote or tried to write , and began taking pens and paper from the drawer . There was a great pile of ruled paper there ; all of it used , on one side , and signifying many hours of desperate scribbling , of heart - searching and rack of his brain ; an array of poor , eager lines written by a waning fire with waning hope ; all useless and abandoned . He took up the sheets cheerfully , and began in delicious idleness to look over these fruitless efforts . A page caught his attention ; he remembered how he wrote it while a November storm was dashing against the panes ; and there was another , with a queer blot in one corner ; he had got up from his chair and looked out , and all the earth was white fairyland , and the snowflakes whirled round and round in the wind . Then he saw the chapter begun of a night in March : a great gale blew that night and rooted up one of the ancient yews in the churchyard . He had heard the trees shrieking in the woods , and the long wail of the wind , and across the heaven a white moon fled awfully before the streaming clouds . And all these poor abandoned pages now seemed sweet , and past unhappiness was transmuted into happiness , and the nights of toil were holy . He turned over half a dozen leaves and began to sketch out the outlines of the new book on the unused pages ; running out a skeleton plan on one page , and dotting fancies , suggestions , hints on others . He wrote rapidly , overjoyed to find that loving phrases grew under his pen ; a particular scene he had imagined filled him with desire ; he gave his hand free course , and saw the written work glowing ; and action and all the heat of existence quickened and beat on the wet page . Happy fancies took shape in happier words , and when at last he leant back in his chair he felt the stir and rush of the story as if it had been some portion of his own life . He read over what he had done with a renewed pleasure in the nimble and flowing workmanship , and as he put the little pile of manuscript tenderly in the drawer he paused to enjoy the anticipation of tomorrow 's labor . And thenâ€”but
21167	21181	21183	21184	his father	341	" And you really do n't mean to do anything about those rascals ? "
21186	21223	21761	21762	Edward Dixon	96	" Rascals ? Which rascals ? Oh , you mean Beit . I had forgotten all about it . No ; I do n't think I shall trouble . They 're not worth powder and shot . "
21748	21759	21761	21762	Edward Dixon	96	" I always thought he was a beastly young ass , "
21764	21821	21865	21869	a very nice young fellowâ€”"clever	2092	" but I did n't think he 'd chuck away his chances like that . Said he could n't stand a bank ! I hope he 'll be able to stand bread and water . That 's all those littery fellows get , I believe , except Tennyson and Mark Twain and those sort of people . "

22517	22525	22533	22534	old Gervase	156	" how well poor Agatha had behaved . "
22526	22532	22533	22534	old Gervase	156	" Never mind , Gathy , "

22776	22823	22837	22838	Henrietta Dixon	134	" very sorry ; rough on you , Vaughan . Always thought those Patagonians were risky , but you would n't hear of it . Hope we shall see you before very long ; you and Mrs. Vaughan must come to tea some day after Christmas . "
22824	22835	22837	22838	Henrietta Dixon	134	" Of course we are all very sorry for them , "
22840	22910	22969	22969	she	776	" No , we have n't called on Mrs. Vaughan yet . They have no regular servant , you know ; only a woman in the morning . I hear old mother Vaughan , as Edward will call her , does nearly everything . And their house is absurdly small ; it 's little more than a cottage . One really ca n't call it a gentleman 's house . "
22958	22968	22969	22969	she	776	" he went out in such a funny way , "
22972	23022	23084	23085	Mrs. Gervase	158	" just like the dog when he 's had a whipping . Of course it 's sad , even if it is all his own fault , as everybody says , but he looked so ridiculous as he was going down the steps that I could n't help laughing . "
23075	23082	23084	23085	Mrs. Gervase	158	" Hush , dear , hush , "
23087	23150	23162	23163	Mrs. Dixon	91	" it 's all too shocking to be a laughing matter . Do n't you agree with me , Mrs. Dixon ? The sinful extravagance that went on at Pentre always frightened me . You remember that ball they gave last year ? Mr. Gervase assured me that the champagne must have cost at least a hundred and fifty shillings the dozen . "
23151	23160	23162	23163	Mrs. Dixon	91	" It 's dreadful , is n't it , "
23165	23186	23194	23194	Agatha	156	" when one thinks of how many poor people there are who would be thankful for a crust of bread ? "
23187	23193	23194	23194	Agatha	156	" Yes , Mrs. Dixon , "
23198	23329	23162	23163	Mrs. Dixon	91	" and you know how absurdly the Vaughans spoilt the cottagers . Oh , it was really wicked ; one would think Mr. Vaughan wished to make them above their station . Edith and I went for a walk one day nearly as far as Pentre , and we begged a glass of water of old Mrs. Jones who lives in that pretty cottage near the brook . She began praising the Vaughans in the most fulsome manner , and showed us some flannel things they had given her at Christmas . I assure you , my dear Mrs. Dixon , the flannel was the very best quality ; no lady could wish for better . It could n't have cost less than half - a - crown a yard . "
23330	23406	23422	23423	Miss Colley	164	" I know , my dear , I know . Mr. Dixon always said it could n't last . How often I have heard him say that the Vaughans were pauperizing all the common people about Pentre , and putting every one else in a most unpleasant position . Even from a worldly point of view it was very poor taste on their part . So different from the true charity that Paul speaks of . "
23407	23420	23422	23423	Miss Colley	164	" I only wish they had given away nothing worse than flannel , "
23433	23512	23527	23528	Mrs. Dixon	91	" But I assure you there was a perfect orgy , I can call it nothing else , every Christmas . Great joints of prime beef , and barrels of strong beer , and snuff and tobacco distributed wholesale ; as if the poor wanted to be encouraged in their disgusting habits . It was really impossible to go through the village for weeks after ; the whole place was poisoned with the fumes of horrid tobacco pipes . "
23513	23525	23527	23528	Mrs. Dixon	91	" Well , we see how that sort of thing ends , "
23534	23584	23654	23654	Barnes	82	" We had intended to call , but I really think it would be impossible after what Mrs. Gervase has told us . The idea of Mr. Vaughan trying to sponge on poor Mr. Gervase in that shabby way ! I think meanness of that kind is so hateful . "

But , my dear boy , there are only four lines , and who ever heard of notes shaped like that : you have made some square and some diamond - shape ? Why did n't you look in your poor mother 's old music ? It 's in the ottoman in the drawing - room . I could have shown you how to make the notes ; there are crotchets , you know , and quavers . "

29227	29325	29337	29337	Lucian	73	" Mrs. Dixon assured me you were staggering from one side of the street to the other . You quite frightened her , she said . Then she asked me if I recommended her to take one or two ounces of spirit at bedtime for the palpitation ; and of course I told her two would be better . I have my living to make here , you know . And upon my word , I think she wants it ; she 's always gurgling inside like waterworks . I wonder how old Dixon can stand it . "
29326	29335	29337	29337	Lucian	73	" I like ' ounces of spirit , ' "
29339	29372	29429	29429	Lucian	73	" That 's taking it medicinally , I suppose . I 've often heard of ladies who have to ' take it medicinally ' ; and that 's how it 's done ? "
29373	29428	29514	29515	the doctor	550	" That 's it . ' Dr Burrows wo n't listen to me ' : ' I tell him how I dislike the taste of spirits , but he says they are absolutely necessary for my constitution ' : ' my medical man insists on something at bedtime ' ; that 's the style . "
29499	29512	29514	29515	the doctor	550	" You come down to Caermaen pretty often , do n't you ? "
29517	29531	29456	29456	Their	942	" I 've seen you two or three times in the last fortnight . "
29532	29540	29596	29597	The doctor	550	" Yes , I enjoy the walk . "
29541	29595	29617	29618	Mrs. Gervase	158	" Well , look me up whenever you like , you know . I am often in just at this time , and a chat with a human being is n't bad , now and then . It 's a change for me ; I 'm often afraid I shall lose my patients . "
29633	29684	29729	29730	the doctor	550	" Ah , I see . Very amusing indeed . We had an old coachmen once who was very clever , I believe , at that sort of thing , but Mr. Gervase was obliged to send him away , the laughter of the other domestics was so very boisterous . "
29719	29727	29729	29730	the doctor	550	" You look a little pulled down , "
29738	29787	29821	29825	The " healthy " boy	1915	" No , you do n't want my medicine . Plenty of beef and beer will do you more good than drugs . I daresay it 's the hot weather that has thinned you a bit . Oh , you 'll be all right again in a month . "

30973	31048	31049	31049	She	982	" A little dog , please sir . A little terrier dog with white hair . Father gave me him a month ago , and said I might keep him . Someone did leave the garden gate open this afternoon , and he must ' a got away , sir , and I was so fond of him sir , he was so playful and loving , and I be afraid he be lost . "

31240	31603	33301	33302	Mrs. Dixon	91	" There were five steps that did go up to the first pace , and seven steps to the second pace , all of clene hewn ashler . And all above it was most curiously and gloriously wrought with thorowgh carved work ; in the highest place was the Holy Roode with Christ upon the Cross having Marie on the one syde and John on the other . And below were six splendent and glisteringe archaungels that bore up the roode , and beneath them in their stories were the most fair and noble images of the xii Apostles and of divers other Saints and Martirs . And in the lowest storie there was a marvelous imagerie of divers Beasts , such as oxen and horses and swine , and little dogs and peacocks , all done in the finest and most curious wise , so that they all seemed as they were caught in a Wood of Thorns , the which is their torment of this life . And here once in the year was a marvelous solemn service , when the parson of Caermaen came out with the singers and all the people , singing the psalm Benedicite omnia opera as they passed along the road in their procession . And when they stood at the roode the priest did there his service , making certain prayers for the beasts , and then he went up to the first pace and preached a sermon to the people , shewing them that as our lord Jhu dyed upon the Tree of his deare mercy for us , so we too owe mercy to the beasts his Creatures , for that they are all his poor lieges and silly servants . And that like as the Holy Aungells do their suit to him on high , and the Blessed xii Apostles and the Martirs , and all the Blissful Saints served him aforetime on earth and now praise him in heaven , so also do the beasts serve him , though they be in torment of life and below men . For their spirit goeth downward , as Holy Writ teacheth us . "

33661	33665	33606	33607	Mr. Dixon	92	" Very shocking . "
33666	33709	33606	33607	Mr. Dixon	92	" It has distressed the bishop . Martin is a hard - working man enough , and all that , but those sort of things ca n't be tolerated . The bishop told me that he had set his face against processions . "

34618	34633	34669	34671	Ben - Hur	204	" do n't you think he is rather silly ? He ca n't talk about anythingâ€”anything
34675	34766	34669	34671	Ben - Hur	204	" The vicar had not interrupted Lucian . The sun still beat upon the roses , and a little breeze bore the scent of them to his nostrils together with the smell of grapes and vine - leaves . He had become curious in sensation , and as he leant back upon the cushions covered with glistening yellow silk , he was trying to analyze a strange ingredient in the perfume of the air . He had penetrated far beyond the crude distinctions of modern times , beyond the rough : "
34774	34775	34669	34671	Ben - Hur	204	" "
34782	34818	34669	34671	Ben - Hur	204	" Modern perceptions of odor were , he knew , far below those of the savage in delicacy . The degraded black fellow of Australia could distinguish odors in a way that made the consumer of "
34820	35314	34669	34671	Ben - Hur	204	" stare in amazement , but the savage 's sensations were all strictly utilitarian . To Lucian as he sat in the cool porch , his feet on the marble , the air came laden with scents as subtly and wonderfully interwoven and contrasted as the harmonica of a great master . The stained marble of the pavement gave a cool reminiscence of the Italian mountain , the blood - red roses palpitating in the sunlight sent out an odor mystical as passion itself , and there was the hint of inebriation in the perfume of the trellised vines . Besides these , the girl 's desire and the unripe innocence of the boy were as distinct as benzoin and myrrh , both delicious and exquisite , and exhaled as freely as the scent of the roses . But there was another element that puzzled him , an aromatic suggestion of the forest . He understood it at last ; it was the vapor of the great red pines that grew beyond the garden ; their spicy needles were burning in the sun , and the smell was as fragrant as the fume of incense blown from far . The soft entreaty of the flute and the swelling rapture of the boy 's voice beat on the air together , and Lucian wondered whether there were in the nature of things any true distinction between the impressions of sound and scent and color . The violent blue of the sky , the song , and the odours seemed rather varied symbols of one mystery than distinct entities . He could almost imagine that the boy 's innocence was indeed a perfume , and that the palpitating roses had become a sonorous chant . In the curious silence which followed the last notes , when the boy and girl had passed under the purple ilex shadow , he fell into a reverie . The fancy that sensations are symbols and not realities hovered in his mind , and led him to speculate as to whether they could not actually be transmuted one into another . It was possible , he thought , that a whole continent of knowledge had been undiscovered ; the energies of men having been expended in unimportant and foolish directions . Modern ingenuity had been employed on such trifles as locomotive engines , electric cables , and cantilever bridges ; on elaborate devices for bringing uninteresting people nearer together ; the ancients had been almost as foolish , because they had mistaken the symbol for the thing signified . It was not the material banquet which really mattered , but the thought of it ; it was almost as futile to eat and take emetics and eat again as to invent telephones and high - pressure boilers . As for some other ancient methods of enjoying life , one might as well set oneself to improve calico printing at once . "
35322	35328	34669	34671	Ben - Hur	204	" said Lucian to himself , "
35339	35551	34669	34671	Ben - Hur	204	" He could imagine a man who was able to live in one sense while he pleased ; to whom , for example , every impression of touch , taste , hearing , or seeing should be translated into odor ; who at the desired kiss should be ravished with the scent of dark violets , to whom music should be the perfume of a rose - garden at dawn . When , now and again , he voluntarily resumed the experience of common life , it was that he might return with greater delight to the garden in the city of refuge . In the actual world the talk was of Nonconformists , the lodger franchise , and the Stock Exchange ; people were constantly reading newspapers , drinking Australian Burgundy , and doing other things equally absurd . They either looked shocked when the fine art of pleasure was mentioned , or confused it with going to musical comedies , drinking bad whisky , and keeping late hours in disreputable and vulgar company . He found to his amusement that the profligate were by many degrees duller than the pious , but that the most tedious of all were the persons who preached promiscuity , and called their system of "
35553	35555	34669	34671	Ben - Hur	204	" the "
35559	36932	34669	34671	Ben - Hur	204	" He went back to the city lovingly , because it was built and adorned for his love . As the metaphysicians insist on the consciousness of the ego as the implied basis of all thought , so he knew that it was she in whom he had found himself , and through whom and for whom all the true life existed . He felt that Annie had taught him the rare magic which had created the garden of Avallaunius . It was for her that he sought strange secrets and tried to penetrate the mysteries of sensation , for he could only give her wonderful thoughts and a wonderful life , and a poor body stained with the scars of his worship . It was with this object , that of making the offering of himself a worthy one , that he continually searched for new and exquisite experiences . He made lovers come before him and confess their secrets ; he pried into the inmost mysteries of innocence and shame , noting how passion and reluctance strive together for the mastery . In the amphitheatre he sometimes witnessed strange entertainments in which such tales as Daphnis and Chloe and The Golden Ass were performed before him . These shows were always given at nighttime ; a circle of torch - bearers surrounded the stage in the center , and above , all the tiers of seats were dark . He would look up at the soft blue of the summer sky , and at the vast dim mountain hovering like a cloud in the west , and then at the scene illumined by a flaring light , and contrasted with violent shadows . The subdued mutter of conversation in a strange language rising from bench after bench , swift hissing whispers of explanation , now and then a shout or a cry as the interest deepened , the restless tossing of the people as the end drew near , an arm lifted , a cloak thrown back , the sudden blaze of a torch lighting up purple or white or the gleam of gold in the black serried ranks ; these were impressions that seemed always amazing . And above , the dusky light of the stars , around , the sweet - scented meadows , and the twinkle of lamps from the still city , the cry of the sentries about the walls , the wash of the tide filling the river , and the salt savor of the sea . With such a scenic ornament he saw the tale of Apuleius represented , heard the names of Fotis and Byrrhaena and Lucius proclaimed , and the deep intonation of such sentences as Ecce Veneris hortator et armiger Liber advenit ultro . The tale went on through all its marvelous adventures , and Lucian left the amphitheatre and walked beside the river where he could hear indistinctly the noise of voices and the singing Latin , and note how the rumor of the stage mingled with the murmur of the shuddering reeds and the cool lapping of the tide . Then came the farewell of the cantor , the thunder of applause , the crash of cymbals , the calling of the flutes , and the surge of the wind in the great dark wood . At other times it was his chief pleasure to spend a whole day in a vineyard planted on the steep slope beyond the bridge . A grey stone seat had been placed beneath a shady laurel , and here he often sat without motion or gesture for many hours . Below him the tawny river swept round the town in a half circle ; he could see the swirl of the yellow water , its eddies and miniature whirlpools , as the tide poured up from the south . And beyond the river the strong circuit of the walls , and within , the city glittered like a charming piece of mosaic . He freed himself from the obtuse modern view of towns as places where human beings live and make money and rejoice or suffer , for from the standpoint of the moment such facts were wholly impertinent . He knew perfectly well that for his present purpose the tawny sheen and shimmer of the tide was the only fact of importance about the river , and so he regarded the city as a curious work in jewelry . Its radiant marble porticoes , the white walls of the villas , a dome of burning copper , the flash and scintillation of tiled roofs , the quiet red of brickwork , dark groves of ilex , and cypress , and laurel , glowing rose - gardens , and here and there the silver of a fountain , seemed arranged and contrasted with a wonderful art , and the town appeared a delicious ornament , every cube of color owing its place to the thought and inspiration of the artificer . Lucian , as he gazed from his arbour amongst the trellised vines , lost none of the subtle pleasures of the sight ; noting every nuance of color , he let his eyes dwell for a moment on the scarlet flash of poppies , and then on a glazed roof which in the glance of the sun seemed to spout white fire . A square of vines was like some rare green stone ; the grapes were massed so richly amongst the vivid leaves , that even from far off there was a sense of irregular flecks and stains of purple running through the green . The laurel garths were like cool jade ; the gardens , where red , yellow , blue and white gleamed together in a mist of heat , had the radiance of opal ; the river was a band of dull gold . On every side , as if to enhance the preciousness of the city , the woods hung dark on the hills ; above , the sky was violet , specked with minute feathery clouds , white as snowflakes . It reminded him of a beautiful bowl in his villa ; the ground was of that same brilliant blue , and the artist had fused into the work , when it was hot , particles of pure white glass . For Lucian this was a spectacle that enchanted many hours ; leaning on one hand , he would gaze at the city glowing in the sunlight till the purple shadows grew down the slopes and the long melodious trumpet sounded for the evening watch . Then , as he strolled beneath the trellises , he would see all the radiant facets glimmering out , and the city faded into haze , a white wall shining here and there , and the gardens veiled in a dim glow of color . On such an evening he would go home with the sense that he had truly lived a day , having received for many hours the most acute impressions of beautiful color . Often he spent the night in the cool court of his villa , lying amidst soft cushions heaped upon the marble bench . A lamp stood on the table at his elbow , its light making the water in the cistern twinkle . There was no sound in the court except the soft continual plashing of the fountain . Throughout these still hours he would meditate , and he became more than ever convinced that man could , if he pleased , become lord of his own sensations . This , surely , was the true meaning concealed under the beautiful symbolism of alchemy . Some years before he had read many of the wonderful alchemical books of the later Middle Ages , and had suspected that something other than the turning of lead into gold was intended . This impression was deepened when he looked into Lumen de Lumine by Vaughan , the brother of the Silurist , and he had long puzzled himself in the endeavor to find a reasonable interpretation of the hermetic mystery , and of the red powder , "
36940	37018	34669	34671	Ben - Hur	204	" And the solution shone out at last , bright and amazing , as he lay quiet in the court of Avallaunius . He knew that he himself had solved the riddle , that he held in his hand the powder of projection , the philosopher 's stone transmuting all it touched to fine gold ; the gold of exquisite impressions . He understood now something of the alchemical symbolism ; the crucible and the furnace , the "
37022	37025	37145	37145	Avallaunius	31	" and the "
37031	37139	37145	37145	Avallaunius	31	" had , he saw , a peculiar meaning . He understood , too , why the uninitiated were warned of the terror and danger through which they must pass ; and the vehemence with which the adepts disclaimed all desire for material riches no longer struck him as singular . The wise man does not endure the torture of the furnace in order that he may be able to compete with operators in pork and company promoters ; neither a steam yacht , nor a grouse - moor , nor three liveried footmen would add at all to his gratifications . Again Lucian said to himself : "
37157	37547	37145	37145	Avallaunius	31	" He saw the true gold into which the beggarly matter of existence may be transmuted by spagyric art ; a succession of delicious moments , all the rare flavors of life concentrated , purged of their lees , and preserved in a beautiful vessel . The moonlight fell green on the fountain and on the curious pavements , and in the long sweet silence of the night he lay still and felt that thought itself was an acute pleasure , to be expressed perhaps in terms of odor or color by the true artist . And he gave himself other and even stranger gratifications . Outside the city walls , between the baths and the amphitheatre , was a tavern , a place where wonderful people met to drink wonderful wine . There he saw priests of Mithras and Isis and of more occult rites from the East , men who wore robes of bright colours , and grotesque ornaments , symbolizing secret things . They spoke amongst themselves in a rich jargon of colored words , full of hidden meanings and the sense of matters unintelligible to the uninitiated , alluding to what was concealed beneath roses , and calling each other by strange names . And there were actors who gave the shows in the amphitheatre , officers of the legion who had served in wild places , singers , and dancing girls , and heroes of strange adventure . The walls of the tavern were covered with pictures painted in violent hues ; blues and reds and greens jarring against one another and lighting up the gloom of the place . The stone benches were always crowded , the sunlight came in through the door in a long bright beam , casting a dancing shadow of vine leaves on the further wall . There a painter had made a joyous figure of the young Bacchus driving the leopards before him with his ivy - staff , and the quivering shadow seemed a part of the picture . The room was cool and dark and cavernous , but the scent and heat of the summer gushed in through the open door . There was ever a full sound , with noise and vehemence , there , and the rolling music of the Latin tongue never ceased . "
37560	37564	37145	37145	Avallaunius	31	" cried one . "
37577	37578	37584	37585	the Owl	1140	" "
37589	37590	37597	37597	Saturn	213	" "
37601	38053	37597	37597	Saturn	213	" The boys who served brought the wine in dull red jars that struck a charming note against their white robes . They poured out the violet and purple and golden wine with calm sweet faces as if they were assisting in the mysteries , without any sign that they heard the strange words that flashed from side to side . The cups were all of glass ; some were of deep green , of the color of the sea near the land , flawed and specked with the bubbles of the furnace . Others were of brilliant scarlet , streaked with irregular bands of white , and having the appearance of white globules in the molded stem . There were cups of dark glowing blue , deeper and more shining than the blue of the sky , and running through the substance of the glass were veins of rich gamboge yellow , twining from the brim to the foot . Some cups were of a troubled and clotted red , with alternating blotches of dark and light , some were variegated with white and yellow stains , some wore a film of rainbow colours , some glittered , shot with gold threads through the clear crystal , some were as if sapphires hung suspended in running water , some sparkled with the glint of stars , some were black and golden like tortoiseshell . A strange feature was the constant and fluttering motion of hands and arms . Gesture made a constant commentary on speech ; white fingers , whiter arms , and sleeves of all colours , hovered restlessly , appeared and disappeared with an effect of threads crossing and re - crossing on the loom . And the odor of the place was both curious and memorable ; something of the damp cold breath of the cave meeting the hot blast of summer , the strangely mingled aromas of rare wines as they fell plashing and ringing into the cups , the drugged vapor of the East that the priests of Mithras and Isis bore from their steaming temples ; these were always strong and dominant . And the women were scented , sometimes with unctuous and overpowering perfumes , and to the artist the experiences of those present were hinted in subtle and delicate nuances of odor . They drank their wine and caressed all day in the tavern . The women threw their round white arms about their lover 's necks , they intoxicated them with the scent of their hair , the priests muttered their fantastic jargon of Theurgy . And through the sonorous clash of voices there always seemed the ring of the cry : "
38066	38187	37597	37597	Saturn	213	" Outside , the vine tendrils shook on the white walls glaring in the sunshine ; the breeze swept up from the yellow river , pungent with the salt sea savor . These tavern scenes were often the subject of Lucian 's meditation as he sat amongst the cushions on the marble seat . The rich sound of the voices impressed him above all things , and he saw that words have a far higher reason than the utilitarian office of imparting a man 's thought . The common notion that language and linked words are important only as a means of expression he found a little ridiculous ; as if electricity were to be studied solely with the view of "
38189	38367	37597	37597	Saturn	213	" to people , and all its other properties left unexplored , neglected . Language , he understood , was chiefly important for the beauty of its sounds , by its possession of words resonant , glorious to the ear , by its capacity , when exquisitely arranged , of suggesting wonderful and indefinable impressions , perhaps more ravishing and farther removed from the domain of strict thought than the impressions excited by music itself . Here lay hidden the secret of the sensuous art of literature ; it was the secret of suggestion , the art of causing delicious sensation by the use of words . In a way , therefore , literature was independent of thought ; the mere English listener , if he had an ear attuned , could recognize the beauty of a splendid Latin phrase . Here was the explanation of the magic of Lycidas . From the standpoint of the formal understanding it was an affected lament over some wholly uninteresting and unimportant Mr. King ; it was full of nonsense about "
38369	38371	38376	38376	muses	1144	" and "
38373	38375	37597	37597	Saturn	213	" and "
38377	38458	38376	38376	muses	1144	" and such stale stock of poetry ; the introduction of St Peter on a stage thronged with nymphs and river gods was blasphemous , absurd , and , in the worst taste ; there were touches of greasy Puritanism , the twang of the conventicle was only too apparent . And Lycidas was probably the most perfect piece of pure literature in existence ; because every word and phrase and line were sonorous , ringing and echoing with music . "
38461	38470	38376	38376	muses	1144	" he re - enunciated in his mind , "
38484	38669	38376	38376	muses	1144	" And yet there was something more ; besides the logical thought , which was often a hindrance , a troublesome though inseparable accident , besides the sensation , always a pleasure and a delight , besides these there were the indefinable inexpressible images which all fine literature summons to the mind . As the chemist in his experiments is sometimes astonished to find unknown , unexpected elements in the crucible or the receiver , as the world of material things is considered by some a thin veil of the immaterial universe , so he who reads wonderful prose or verse is conscious of suggestions that can not be put into words , which do not rise from the logical sense , which are rather parallel to than connected with the sensuous delight . The world so disclosed is rather the world of dreams , rather the world in which children sometimes live , instantly appearing , and instantly vanishing away , a world beyond all expression or analysis , neither of the intellect nor of the senses . He called these fancies of his "
38675	38704	38376	38376	muses	1144	" and was amused to think that a theory of letters should have risen from the eloquent noise that rang all day about the violet and golden wine . "
38713	39159	38376	38376	muses	1144	" said Lucian to himself . He could almost imagine the magic transmutation of the senses accomplished , the strong sunlight was an odor in his nostrils ; it poured down on the white marble and the palpitating roses like a flood . The sky was a glorious blue , making the heart joyous , and the eyes could rest in the dark green leaves and purple shadow of the ilex . The earth seemed to burn and leap beneath the sun , he fancied he could see the vine tendrils stir and quiver in the heat , and the faint fume of the scorching pine needles was blown across the gleaming garden to the seat beneath the porch . Wine was before him in a cup of carved amber ; a wine of the color of a dark rose , with a glint as of a star or of a jet of flame deep beneath the brim ; and the cup was twined about with a delicate wreath of ivy . He was often loath to turn away from the still contemplation of such things , from the mere joy of the violent sun , and the responsive earth . He loved his garden and the view of the tessellated city from the vineyard on the hill , the strange clamor of the tavern , and white Fotis appearing on the torch - lit stage . And there were shops in the town in which he delighted , the shops of the perfume makers , and jewelers , and dealers in curious ware . He loved to see all things made for ladies ' use , to touch the gossamer silks that were to touch their bodies , to finger the beads of amber and the gold chains which would stir above their hearts , to handle the carved hairpins and brooches , to smell odors which were already dedicated to love . But though these were sweet and delicious gratifications , he knew that there were more exquisite things of which he might be a spectator . He had seen the folly of regarding fine literature from the standpoint of the logical intellect , and he now began to question the wisdom of looking at life as if it were a moral representation . Literature , he knew , could not exist without some meaning , and considerations of right and wrong were to a certain extent inseparable from the conception of life , but to insist on ethics as the chief interest of the human pageant was surely absurd . One might as well read Lycidas for the sake of its denunciation of "

39173	39598	39607	39607	he	1149	" An artist entranced by a beautiful landscape did not greatly concern himself with the geological formation of the hills , nor did the lover of a wild sea inquire as to the chemical analysis of the water . Lucian saw a colored and complex life displayed before him , and he sat enraptured at the spectacle , not concerned to know whether actions were good or bad , but content if they were curious . In this spirit he made a singular study of corruption . Beneath his feet , as he sat in the garden porch , was a block of marble through which there ran a scarlet stain . It began with a faint line , thin as a hair , and grew as it advanced , sending out offshoots to right and left , and broadening to a pool of brilliant red . There were strange lives into which he looked that were like the block of marble ; women with grave sweet faces told him the astounding tale of their adventures , and how , they said , they had met the faun when they were little children . They told him how they had played and watched by the vines and the fountains , and dallied with the nymphs , and gazed at images reflected in the water pools , till the authentic face appeared from the wood . He heard others tell how they had loved the satyrs for many years before they knew their race ; and there were strange stories of those who had longed to speak but knew not the word of the enigma , and searched in all strange paths and ways before they found it . He heard the history of the woman who fell in love with her slave - boy , and tempted him for three years in vain . He heard the tale from the woman 's full red lips , and watched her face , full of the ineffable sadness of lust , as she described her curious stratagems in mellow phrases . She was drinking a sweet yellow wine from a gold cup as she spoke , and the odor in her hair and the aroma of the precious wine seemed to mingle with the soft strange words that flowed like an unguent from a carven jar . She told how she bought the boy in the market of an Asian city , and had him carried to her house in the grove of fig - trees . "

40115	40288	40104	40104	his	1780	" She poured out more of the topaz - colored wine in her cup , and Lucian saw it glitter as it rose to the brim and mirrored the gleam of the lamps . The tale went on , recounting a hundred strange devices . The woman told how she had tempted the boy by idleness and ease , giving him long hours of sleep , and allowing him to recline all day on soft cushions , that swelled about him , enclosing his body . She tried the experiment of curious odors : causing him to smell always about him the oil of roses , and burning in his presence rare gums from the East . He was allured by soft dresses , being clothed in silks that caressed the skin with the sense of a fondling touch . Three times a day they spread before him a delicious banquet , full of savor and odor and color ; three times a day they endeavored to intoxicate him with delicate wine . "
40292	40297	40359	40359	he	1172	" the lady continued , "
40370	40546	40555	40555	Lucian	73	" On another evening he heard the history of the man who dwelt alone , refusing all allurements , and was at last discovered to be the lover of a black statue . And there were tales of strange cruelties , of men taken by mountain robbers , and curiously maimed and disfigured , so that when they escaped and returned to the town , they were thought to be monsters and killed at their own doors . Lucian left no dark or secret nook of life unvisited ; he sat down , as he said , at the banquet , resolved to taste all the savors , and to leave no flagon unvisited . His relations grew seriously alarmed about him at this period . While he heard with some inner ear the suave and eloquent phrases of singular tales , and watched the lamp - light in amber and purple wine , his father saw a lean pale boy , with black eyes that burnt in hollows , and sad and sunken cheeks . "
40557	40562	40567	40567	you	1175	" said the parson ; "
40572	40660	40666	40667	Lucian Taylor	73	" He was looking feebly at the roast mutton and sipping a little water ; but he would not have eaten or drunk with more relish if the choicest meat and drink had been before him . His bones seemed , as Miss Deacon said , to be growing through his skin ; he had all the appearance of an ascetic whose body has been reduced to misery by long and grievous penance . People who chanced to see him could not help saying to one another : "
40670	40739	40758	40758	You	0	" They were of course quite unaware of the joy and luxury in which his real life was spent , and some of them began to pity him , and to speak to him kindly . It was too late for that . The friendly words had as much lost their meaning as the words of contempt . Edward Dixon hailed him cheerfully in the street one day : "
40753	40757	40805	40806	the pater	1178	" he said . "
40813	41042	41241	41241	he	153	" He gently declined and went on . Kindness and unkindness , pity and contempt had become for him mere phrases ; he could not have distinguished one from the other . Hebrew and Chinese , Hungarian and Pushtu would be pretty much alike to an agricultural laborer ; if he cared to listen he might detect some general differences in sound , but all four tongues would be equally devoid of significance . To Lucian , entranced in the garden of Avallaunius , it seemed very strange that he had once been so ignorant of all the exquisite meanings of life . Now , beneath the violet sky , looking through the brilliant trellis of the vines , he saw the picture ; before , he had gazed in sad astonishment at the squalid rag which was wrapped about it . And he was at last in the city of the unending murmuring streets , a part of the stirring shadow , of the amber - lighted gloom . It seemed a long time since he had knelt before his sweetheart in the lane , the moon - fire streaming upon them from the dark circle of the fort , the air and the light and his soul full of haunting , the touch of the unimaginable thrilling his heart ; and now he sat in a terrible "
41048	41153	41241	41241	he	153	" in a western suburb , confronted by a heap and litter of papers on the desk of a battered old bureau . He had put his breakfast - tray out on the landing , and was thinking of the morning 's work , and of some very dubious pages that he had blackened the night before . But when he had lit his disreputable briar , he remembered there was an unopened letter waiting for him on the table ; he had recognized the vague , staggering script of Miss Deacon , his cousin . There was not much news ; his father was "
41160	41200	41201	41201	I	0	" there had been a good deal of rain , the farmers expected to make a lot of cider , and so forth . But at the close of the letter Miss Deacon became useful for reproof and admonition . "
41208	41212	41634	41634	you	73	" she said , "
41640	41652	41634	41634	you	73	" Lucian pigeon - holed the letter solemnly in the receptacle lettered "
41655	41668	42802	42804	our corrupted Clergy	1148	" He felt that he ought to ask himself some serious questions : "
41704	42801	42802	42804	our corrupted Clergy	1148	" but he was eager to get to his work , a curious and intricate piece of analysis . So the battered bureau , the litter of papers , and the thick fume of his pipe , engulfed him and absorbed him for the rest of the morning . Outside were the dim October mists , the dreary and languid life of a side street , and beyond , on the main road , the hum and jangle of the gliding trains . But he heard none of the uneasy noises of the quarter , not even the shriek of the garden gates nor the yelp of the butcher on his round , for delight in his great task made him unconscious of the world outside . He had come by curious paths to this calm hermitage between Shepherd 's Bush and Acton Vale . The golden weeks of the summer passed on in their enchanted procession , and Annie had not returned , neither had she written . Lucian , on his side , sat apart , wondering why his longing for her were not sharper . As he though of his raptures he would smile faintly to himself , and wonder whether he had not lost the world and Annie with it . In the garden of Avallaunius his sense of external things had grown dim and indistinct ; the actual , material life seemed every day to become a show , a fleeting of shadows across a great white light . At last the news came that Annie Morgan had been married from her sister 's house to a young farmer , to whom it appeared , she had been long engaged , and Lucian was ashamed to find himself only conscious of amusement , mingled with gratitude . She had been the key that opened the shut palace , and he was now secure on the throne of ivory and gold . A few days after he had heard the news he repeated the adventure of his boyhood ; for the second time he scaled the steep hillside , and penetrated the matted brake . He expected violent disillusion , but his feeling was rather astonishment at the activity of boyish imagination . There was no terror nor amazement now in the green bulwarks , and the stunted undergrowth did not seem in any way extraordinary . Yet he did not laugh at the memory of his sensations , he was not angry at the cheat . Certainly it had been all illusion , all the heats and chills of boyhood , its thoughts of terror were without significance . But he recognized that the illusions of the child only differed from those of the man in that they were more picturesque ; belief in fairies and belief in the Stock Exchange as bestowers of happiness were equally vain , but the latter form of faith was ugly as well as inept . It was better , he knew , and wiser , to wish for a fairy coach than to cherish longings for a well - appointed brougham and liveried servants . He turned his back on the green walls and the dark oaks without any feeling of regret or resentment . After a little while he began to think of his adventures with pleasure ; the ladder by which he had mounted had disappeared , but he was safe on the height . By the chance fancy of a beautiful girl he had been redeemed from a world of misery and torture , the world of external things into which he had come a stranger , by which he had been tormented . He looked back at a kind of vision of himself seen as he was a year before , a pitiable creature burning and twisting on the hot coals of the pit , crying lamentably to the laughing bystanders for but one drop of cold water wherewith to cool his tongue . He confessed to himself , with some contempt , that he had been a social being , depending for his happiness on the goodwill of others ; he had tried hard to write , chiefly , it was true , from love of the art , but a little from a social motive . He had imagined that a written book and the praise of responsible journals would ensure him the respect of the county people . It was a quaint idea , and he saw the lamentable fallacies naked ; in the first place , a painstaking artist in words was not respected by the respectable ; secondly , books should not be written with the object of gaining the goodwill of the landed and commercial interests ; thirdly and chiefly , no man should in any way depend on another . From this utter darkness , from danger of madness , the ever dear and sweet Annie had rescued him . Very beautifully and fitly , as Lucian thought , she had done her work without any desire to benefit him , she had simply willed to gratify her own passion , and in doing this had handed to him the priceless secret . And he , on his side , had reversed the process ; merely to make himself a splendid offering for the acceptance of his sweetheart , he had cast aside the vain world , and had found the truth , which now remained with him , precious and enduring . And since the news of the marriage he found that his worship of her had by no means vanished ; rather in his heart was the eternal treasure of a happy love , untarnished and spotless ; it would be like a mirror of gold without alloy , bright and lustrous for ever . For Lucian , it was no defect in the woman that she was desirous and faithless ; he had not conceived an affection for certain moral or intellectual accidents , but for the very woman . Guided by the self - evident axiom that humanity is to be judged by literature , and not literature by humanity , he detected the analogy between Lycidas and Annie . Only the dullard would object to the nauseous ca nt of the one , or to the indiscretions of the other . A sober critic might say that the man who could generalize Herbert and Laud , Donne and Herrick , Sanderson and Juxon , Hammond and Lancelot Andrewes into "
42805	42868	42802	42804	our corrupted Clergy	1148	" must be either an imbecile or a scoundrel , or probably both . The judgment would be perfectly true , but as a criticism of Lycidas it would be a piece of folly . In the case of the woman one could imagine the attitude of the conventional lover ; of the chevalier who , with his tongue in his cheek , "
42872	42959	42802	42804	our corrupted Clergy	1148	" all women , and coming home early in the morning writes a leading article on St English Girl . Lucian , on the other hand , felt profoundly grateful to the delicious Annie , because she had at precisely the right moment voluntarily removed her image from his way . He confessed to himself that , latterly , he had a little dreaded her return as an interruption ; he had shivered at the thought that their relations would become what was so terribly called an "
42961	42963	42998	42998	segars	1202	" or "
42966	42997	42998	42998	segars	1202	" There would be all the threadbare and common stratagems , the vulgarity of secret assignations , and an atmosphere suggesting the period of Mr. Thomas Moore and Lord Byron and "
43000	43088	42998	42998	segars	1202	" Lucian had been afraid of all this ; he had feared lest love itself should destroy love . He considered that now , freed from the torment of the body , leaving untasted the green water that makes thirst more burning , he was perfectly initiated in the true knowledge of the splendid and glorious love . There seemed to him a monstrous paradox in the assertion that there could be no true love without a corporal presence of the beloved ; even the popular sayings of "
43096	43098	43600	43601	Cousin Edward	231	" and "
43103	43599	43600	43601	Cousin Edward	231	" witnessed to the contrary . He thought , sighing , and with compassion , of the manner in which men are continually led astray by the cheat of the senses . In order that the unborn might still be added to the born , nature had inspired men with the wild delusion that the bodily companionship of the lover and the beloved was desirable above all things , and so , by the false show of pleasure , the human race was chained to vanity , and doomed to an eternal thirst for the non - existent . Again and again he gave thanks for his own escape ; he had been set free from a life of vice and sin and folly , from all the dangers and illusions that are most dreaded by the wise . He laughed as he remembered what would be the common view of the situation . An ordinary lover would suffer all the sting of sorrow and contempt ; there would be grief for a lost mistress , and rage at her faithlessness , and hate in the heart ; one foolish passion driving on another , and driving the man to ruin . For what would be commonly called the real woman he now cared nothing ; if he had heard that she had died in her farm in Utter Gwent , he would have experienced only a passing sorrow , such as he might feel at the death of any one he had once known . But he did not think of the young farmer 's wife as the real Annie ; he did not think of the frost - bitten leaves in winter as the real rose . Indeed , the life of many reminded him of the flowers ; perhaps more especially of those flowers which to all appearance are for many years but dull and dusty clumps of green , and suddenly , in one night , burst into the flame of blossom , and fill all the misty lawns with odor ; till the morning . It was in that night that the flower lived , not through the long unprofitable years ; and , in like manner , many human lives , he thought , were born in the evening and dead before the coming of day . But he had preserved the precious flower in all its glory , not suffering it to wither in the hard light , but keeping it in a secret place , where it could never be destroyed . Truly now , and for the first time , he possessed Annie , as a man possesses the gold which he has dug from the rock and purged of its baseness . He was musing over these things when a piece of news , very strange and unexpected , arrived at the rectory . A distant , almost a mythical relative , known from childhood as "
43608	43927	43600	43601	Cousin Edward	231	" had died , and by some strange freak had left Lucian two thousand pounds . It was a pleasure to give his father five hundred pounds , and the rector on his side forgot for a couple of days to lean his head on his hand . From the rest of the capital , which was well invested , Lucian found he would derive something between sixty and seventy pounds a year , and his old desires for literature and a refuge in the murmuring streets returned to him . He longed to be free from the incantations that surrounded him in the country , to work and live in a new atmosphere ; and so , with many good wishes from his father , he came to the retreat in the waste places of London . He was in high spirits when he found the square , clean room , horribly furnished , in the by - street that branched from the main road , and advanced in an unlovely sweep to the mud pits and the desolation that was neither town nor country . On every side monotonous grey streets , each house the replica of its neighbor , to the east an unexplored wilderness , north and west and south the brickfields and market - gardens , everywhere the ruins of the country , the tracks where sweet lanes had been , gangrened stumps of trees , the relics of hedges , here and there an oak stripped of its bark , white and haggard and leprous , like a corpse . And the air seemed always grey , and the smoke from the brickfields was grey . At first he scarcely realized the quarter into which chance had led him . His only thought was of the great adventure of letters in which he proposed to engage , and his first glance round his "
43933	44133	43600	43601	Cousin Edward	231	" showed him that there was no piece of furniture suitable for his purpose . The table , like the rest of the suite , was of bird's - eye maple ; but the maker seemed to have penetrated the druidic secret of the rocking - stone , the thing was in a state of unstable equilibrium perpetually . For some days he wandered through the streets , inspecting the second - hand furniture shops , and at last , in a forlorn byway , found an old Japanese bureau , dishonored and forlorn , standing amongst rusty bedsteads , sorry china , and all the refuse of homes dead and desolate . The bureau pleased him in spite of its grime and grease and dirt . Inlaid mother - of - pearl , the gleam of lacquer dragons in red gold , and hints of curious design shone through the film of neglect and ill - usage , and when the woman of the shop showed him the drawers and well and pigeon - holes , he saw that it would be an apt instrument for his studies . The bureau was carried to his room and replaced the "
44137	44346	43600	43601	Cousin Edward	231	" table under the gas - jet . As Lucian arranged what papers he had accumulated : the sketches of hopeless experiments , shreds and tatters of stories begun but never completed , outlines of plots , two or three notebooks scribbled through and through with impressions of the abandoned hills , he felt a thrill of exaltation at the prospect of work to be accomplished , of a new world all open before him . He set out on the adventure with a fury of enthusiasm ; his last thought at night when all the maze of streets was empty and silent was of the problem , and his dreams ran on phrases , and when he awoke in the morning he was eager to get back to his desk . He immersed himself in a minute , almost a microscopic analysis of fine literature . It was no longer enough , as in the old days , to feel the charm and incantation of a line or a word ; he wished to penetrate the secret , to understand something of the wonderful suggestion , all apart from the sense , that seemed to him the differentia of literature , as distinguished from the long follies of "
44351	44352	43600	43601	Cousin Edward	231	" "
44356	46167	43600	43601	Cousin Edward	231	" and all the stuff that went to make the three - volume novel of commerce . He found himself curiously strengthened by the change from the hills to the streets . There could be no doubt , he thought , that living a lonely life , interested only in himself and his own thoughts , he had become in a measure inhuman . The form of external things , black depths in woods , pools in lonely places , those still valleys curtained by hills on every side , sounding always with the ripple of their brooks , had become to him an influence like that of a drug , giving a certain peculiar color and outline to his thoughts . And from early boyhood there had been another strange flavor in his life , the dream of the old Roman world , those curious impressions that he had gathered from the white walls of Caermaen , and from the looming bastions of the fort . It was in reality the subconscious fancies of many years that had rebuilt the golden city , and had shown him the vine - trellis and the marbles and the sunlight in the garden of Avallaunius . And the rapture of love had made it all so vivid and warm with life , that even now , when he let his pen drop , the rich noise of the tavern and the chant of the theatre sounded above the murmur of the streets . Looking back , it was as much a part of his life as his schooldays , and the tessellated pavements were as real as the square of faded carpet beneath his feet . But he felt that he had escaped . He could now survey those splendid and lovely visions from without , as if he read of opium dreams , and he no longer dreaded a weird suggestion that had once beset him , that his very soul was being molded into the hills , and passing into the black mirror of still waterpools . He had taken refuge in the streets , in the harbor of a modern suburb , from the vague , dreaded magic that had charmed his life . Whenever he felt inclined to listen to the old wood - whisper or to the singing of the fauns he bent more earnestly to his work , turning a deaf ear to the incantations . In the curious labor of the bureau he found refreshment that was continually renewed . He experienced again , and with a far more violent impulse , the enthusiasm that had attended the writing of his book a year or two before , and so , perhaps , passed from one drug to another . It was , indeed , with something of rapture that he imagined the great procession of years all to be devoted to the intimate analysis of words , to the construction of the sentence , as if it were a piece of jewelry or mosaic . Sometimes , in the pauses of the work , he would pace up and down his cell , looking out of the window now and again and gazing for an instant into the melancholy street . As the year advanced the days grew more and more misty , and he found himself the inhabitant of a little island wreathed about with the waves of a white and solemn sea . In the afternoon the fog would grow denser , shutting out not only sight but sound ; the shriek of the garden gates , the jangling of the tram - bell echoed as if from a far way . Then there were days of heavy incessant rain ; he could see a grey drifting sky and the drops plashing in the street , and the houses all dripping and saddened with wet . He cured himself of one great aversion . He was no longer nauseated at the sight of a story begun and left unfinished . Formerly , even when an idea rose in his mind bright and wonderful , he had always approached the paper with a feeling of sickness and dislike , remembering all the hopeless beginnings he had made . But now he understood that to begin a romance was almost a separate and special art , a thing apart from the story , to be practiced with sedulous care . Whenever an opening scene occurred to him he noted it roughly in a book , and he devoted many long winter evenings to the elaboration of these beginnings . Sometimes the first impression would yield only a paragraph or a sentence , and once or twice but a splendid and sonorous word , which seemed to Lucian all dim and rich with unsurmised adventure . But often he was able to write three or four vivid pages , studying above all things the hint and significance of the words and actions , striving to work into the lines the atmosphere of expectation and promise , and the murmur of wonderful events to come . In this one department of his task the labor seemed almost endless . He would finish a few pages and then rewrite them , using the same incident and nearly the same words , but altering that indefinite something which is scarcely so much style as manner , or atmosphere . He was astonished at the enormous change that was thus effected , and often , though he himself had done the work , he could scarcely describe in words how it was done . But it was clear that in this art of manner , or suggestion , lay all the chief secrets of literature , that by it all the great miracles were performed . Clearly it was not style , for style in itself was untranslatable , but it was that high theurgic magic that made the English Don Quixote , roughly traduced by some Jervas , perhaps the best of all English books . And it was the same element that made the journey of Roderick Random to London , so ostensibly a narrative of coarse jokes and common experiences and burlesque manners , told in no very choice diction , essentially a wonderful vision of the eighteenth century , carrying to one 's very nostrils the aroma of the Great North Road , iron - bound under black frost , darkened beneath shuddering woods , haunted by highwaymen , with an adventure waiting beyond every turn , and great old echoing inns in the midst of lonely winter lands . It was this magic that Lucian sought for his opening chapters ; he tried to find that quality that gives to words something beyond their sound and beyond their meaning , that in the first lines of a book should whisper things unintelligible but all significant . Often he worked for many hours without success , and the grim wet dawn once found him still searching for hieroglyphic sentences , for words mystical , symbolic . On the shelves , in the upper part of his bureau , he had placed the books which , however various as to matter , seemed to have a part in this curious quality of suggestion , and in that sphere which might almost be called supernatural . To these books he often had recourse , when further effort appeared altogether hopeless , and certain pages in Coleridge and Edgar Allan Poe had the power of holding him in a trance of delight , subject to emotions and impressions which he knew to transcend altogether the realm of the formal understanding . Such lines as : Bottomless vales and boundless floods , And chasms , and caves , and Titan woods , With forms that no man can discover For the dews that drip all over ; had for Lucian more than the potency of a drug , lulling him into a splendid waking - sleep , every word being a supreme incantation . And it was not only his mind that was charmed by such passages , for he felt at the same time a strange and delicious bodily languor that held him motionless , without the desire or power to stir from his seat . And there were certain phrases in Kubla Khan that had such a magic that he would sometimes wake up , as it were , to the consciousness that he had been lying on the bed or sitting in the chair by the bureau , repeating a single line over and over again for two or three hours . Yet he knew perfectly well that he had not been really asleep ; a little effort recalled a constant impression of the wall - paper , with its pink flowers on a buff ground , and of the muslin - curtained window , letting in the grey winter light . He had been some seven months in London when this odd experience first occurred to him . The day opened dreary and cold and clear , with a gusty and restless wind whirling round the corner of the street , and lifting the dead leaves and scraps of paper that littered the roadway into eddying mounting circles , as if a storm of black rain were to come . Lucian had sat late the night before , and rose in the morning feeling weary and listless and heavy - headed . While he dressed , his legs dragged him as with weights , and he staggered and nearly fell in bending down to the mat outside for his tea - tray . He lit the spirit lamp on the hearth with shaking , unsteady hands , and could scarcely pour out the tea when it was ready . A delicate cup of tea was one of his few luxuries ; he was fond of the strange flavor of the green leaf , and this morning he drank the straw - colored liquid eagerly , hoping it would disperse the cloud of languor . He tried his best to coerce himself into the sense of vigor and enjoyment with which he usually began the day , walking briskly up and down and arranging his papers in order . But he could not free himself from depression ; even as he opened the dear bureau a wave of melancholy came upon him , and he began to ask himself whether he were not pursuing a vain dream , searching for treasures that had no existence . He drew out his cousin 's letter and read it again , sadly enough . After all there was a good deal of truth in what she said ; he had "
46169	46313	46711	46712	a man	687	" his powers , he had no friends , no real education . He began to count up the months since he had come to London ; he had received his two thousand pounds in March , and in May he had said good - bye to the woods and to the dear and friendly paths . May , June , July , August , September , October , November , and half of December had gone by ; and what had he to show ? Nothing but the experiment , the attempt , futile scribblings which had no end nor shining purpose . There was nothing in his desk that he could produce as evidence of his capacity , no fragment even of accomplishment . It was a thought of intense bitterness , but it seemed as if the barbarians were in the rightâ€”a

I daresay the walk there would do you good . It is such a pity you smoke that horrid tobacco . I had a letter from Mrs. Dolly ( Jane Diggs , who married your cousin John Dolly ) the other day , and she said they would have been delighted to take you for only twenty - five shillings a week for the sake of the family if you had not been a smoker . She told me to ask you if you had ever seen a horse or a dog smoking tobacco . They are such nice , comfortable people , and the children would have been company for you . Johnnie , who used to be such a dear little fellow , has just gone into an office in the City , and seems to have excellent prospects .

50049	50624	56057	56058	His mother	340	lifeâ€”it raised him up in the morning to renew the struggle , it was the symbol which charmed him as he lay down at night . All through the hours of toil at the bureau he was enchanted , and when he went out and explored the unknown coasts , the one thought allured him , and was the colored glass between his eyes and the world . Then as he drew nearer home his steps would quicken , and the more weary and grey the walk , the more he rejoiced as he thought of his hermitage and of the curious difficulties that awaited him there . But when , suddenly and without warning , the faculty disappeared , when his mind seemed a hopeless waste from which nothing could arise , then he became subject to a misery so piteous that the barbarians themselves would have been sorry for him . He had known some foretaste of these bitter and inexpressible griefs in the old country days , but then he had immediately taken refuge in the hills , he had rushed to the dark woods as to an anodyne , letting his heart drink in all the wonder and magic of the wild land . Now in these days of January , in the suburban street , there was no such refuge . He had been working steadily for some weeks , well enough satisfied on the whole with the daily progress , glad to awake in the morning , and to read over what he had written on the night before . The new year opened with faint and heavy weather and a breathless silence in the air , but in a few days the great frost set in . Soon the streets began to suggest the appearance of a beleaguered city , the silence that had preceded the frost deepened , and the mist hung over the earth like a dense white smoke . Night after night the cold increased , and people seemed unwilling to go abroad , till even the main thoroughfares were empty and deserted , as if the inhabitants were lying close in hiding . It was at this dismal time that Lucian found himself reduced to impotence . There was a sudden break in his thought , and when he wrote on valiantly , hoping against hope , he only grew more aghast on the discovery of the imbecilities he had committed to paper . He ground his teeth together and persevered , sick at heart , feeling as if all the world were fallen from under his feet , driving his pen on mechanically , till he was overwhelmed . He saw the stuff he had done without veil or possible concealment , a lamentable and wretched sheaf of verbiage , worse , it seemed , than the efforts of his boyhood . He was not longer tautological , he avoided tautology with the infernal art of a leader - writer , filling his wind bags and mincing words as if he had been a trained journalist on the staff of the Daily Post . There seemed all the matter of an insufferable tragedy in these thoughts ; that his patient and enduring toil was in vain , that practice went for nothing , and that he had wasted the labor of Milton to accomplish the tenth - rate . Unhappily he could not "
50627	55256	56057	56058	His mother	340	" ; the longing , the fury for the work burnt within him like a burning fire ; he lifted up his eyes in despair . It was then , while he knew that no one could help him , that he languished for help , and then , though he was aware that no comfort was possible , he fervently wished to be comforted . The only friend he had was his father , and he knew that his father would not even understand his distress . For him , always , the printed book was the beginning and end of literature ; the agony of the maker , his despair and sickness , were as accursed as the pains of labor . He was ready to read and admire the work of the great Smith , but he did not wish to hear of the period when the great Smith had writhed and twisted like a scotched worm , only hoping to be put out of his misery , to go mad or die , to escape somehow from the bitter pains . And Lucian knew no one else . Now and then he read in the paper the fame of the great littérateurs ; the Gypsies were entertaining the Prince of Wales , the Jolly Beggars were dining with the Lord Mayor , the Old Mumpers were mingling amicably and gorgeously with the leading members of the Stock Exchange . He was so unfortunate as to know none of these gentlemen , but it hardly seemed likely that they could have done much for him in any case . Indeed , in his heart , he was certain that help and comfort from without were in the nature of things utterly impossible , his ruin and grief were within , and only his own assistance could avail . He tried to reassure himself , to believe that his torments were a proof of his vocation , that the facility of the novelist who stood six years deep in contracts to produce romances was a thing wholly undesirable , but all the while he longed for but a drop of that inexhaustible fluency which he professed to despise . He drove himself out from that dreary contemplation of the white paper and the idle pen . He went into the frozen and deserted streets , hoping that he might pluck the burning coal from his heart , but the fire was not quenched . As he walked furiously along the grim iron roads he fancied that those persons who passed him cheerfully on their way to friends and friendly hearths shrank from him into the mists as they went by . Lucian imagined that the fire of his torment and anguish must in some way glow visibly about him ; he moved , perhaps , in a nimbus that proclaimed the blackness and the flames within . He knew , of course , that in misery he had grown delirious , that the well - coated , smooth - hatted personages who loomed out of the fog upon him were in reality shuddering only with cold , but in spite of common sense he still conceived that he saw on their faces an evident horror and disgust , and something of the repugnance that one feels at the sight of a venomous snake , half - killed , trailing its bleeding vileness out of sight . By design Lucian tried to make for remote and desolate places , and yet when he had succeeded in touching on the open country , and knew that the icy shadow hovering through the mist was a field , he longed for some sound and murmur of life , and turned again to roads where pale lamps were glimmering , and the dancing flame of firelight shone across the frozen shrubs . And the sight of these homely fires , the thought of affection and consolation waiting by them , stung him the more sharply perhaps because of the contrast with his own chills and weariness and helpless sickness , and chiefly because he knew that he had long closed an everlasting door between his heart and such felicities . If those within had come out and had called him by his name to enter and be comforted , it would have been quite unavailing , since between them and him there was a great gulf fixed . Perhaps for the first time he realized that he had lost the art of humanity for ever . He had thought when he closed his ears to the wood whisper and changed the fauns ' singing for the murmur of the streets , the black pools for the shadows and amber light of London , that he had put off the old life , and had turned his soul to healthy activities , but the truth was that he had merely exchanged one drug for another . He could not be human , and he wondered whether there were some drop of the fairy blood in his body that made him foreign and a stranger in the world . He did not surrender to desolation without repeated struggles . He strove to allure himself to his desk by the promise of some easy task ; he would not attempt invention , but he had memoranda and rough jottings of ideas in his note - books , and he would merely amplify the suggestions ready to his hand . But it was hopeless , again and again it was hopeless . As he read over his notes , trusting that he would find some hint that might light up the dead fires , and kindle again that pure flame of enthusiasm , he found how desperately his fortune had fallen . He could see no light , no color in the lines he had scribbled with eager trembling fingers ; he remembered how splendid all these things had been when he wrote them down , but now they were meaningless , faded into grey . The few words he had dashed on to the paper , enraptured at the thought of the happy hours they promised , had become mere jargon , and when he understood the idea it seemed foolish , dull , unoriginal . He discovered something at last that appeared to have a grain of promise , and determined to do his best to put it into shape , but the first paragraph appalled him ; it might have been written by an unintelligent schoolboy . He tore the paper in pieces , and shut and locked his desk , heavy despair sinking like lead into his heart . For the rest of that day he lay motionless on the bed , smoking pipe after pipe in the hope of stupefying himself with tobacco fumes . The air in the room became blue and thick with smoke ; it was bitterly cold , and he wrapped himself up in his great - coat and drew the counterpane over him . The night came on and the window darkened , and at last he fell asleep . He renewed the effort at intervals , only to plunge deeper into misery . He felt the approaches of madness , and knew that his only hope was to walk till he was physically exhausted , so that he might come home almost fainting with fatigue , but ready to fall asleep the moment he got into bed . He passed the mornings in a kind of torpor , endeavoring to avoid thought , to occupy his mind with the pattern of the paper , with the advertisements at the end of a book , with the curious greyness of the light that glimmered through the mist into his room , with the muffled voices that rumbled now and then from the street . He tried to make out the design that had once colored the faded carpet on the floor , and wondered about the dead artist in Japan , the adorner of his bureau . He speculated as to what his thoughts had been as he inserted the rainbow mother - of - pearl and made that great flight of shining birds , dipping their wings as they rose from the reeds , or how he had conceived the lacquer dragons in red gold , and the fantastic houses in the garden of peach - trees . But sooner or later the oppression of his grief returned , the loud shriek and clang of the garden - gate , the warning bell of some passing bicyclist steering through the fog , the noise of his pipe falling to the floor , would suddenly awaken him to the sense of misery . He knew that it was time to go out ; he could not bear to sit still and suffer . Sometimes she cut a slice of bread and put it in his pocket , sometimes he trusted to the chance of finding a public - house , where he could have a sandwich and a glass of beer . He turned always from the main streets and lost himself in the intricate suburban byways , willing to be engulfed in the infinite whiteness of the mist . The roads had stiffened into iron ridges , the fences and trees were glittering with frost crystals , everything was of strange and altered aspect . Lucian walked on and on through the maze , now in a circle of shadowy villas , awful as the buried streets of Herculaneum , now in lanes dipping onto open country , that led him past great elm - trees whose white boughs were all still , and past the bitter lonely fields where the mist seemed to fade away into grey darkness . As he wandered along these unfamiliar and ghastly paths he became the more convinced of his utter remoteness from all humanity , he allowed that grotesque suggestion of there being something visibly amiss in his outward appearance to grow upon him , and often he looked with a horrible expectation into the faces of those who passed by , afraid lest his own senses gave him false intelligence , and that he had really assumed some frightful and revolting shape . It was curious that , partly by his own fault , and largely , no doubt , through the operation of mere coincidence , he was once or twice strongly confirmed in this fantastic delusion . He came one day into a lonely and unfrequented byway , a country lane falling into ruin , but still fringed with elms that had formed an avenue leading to the old manor - house . It was now the road of communication between two far outlying suburbs , and on these winter nights lay as black , dreary , and desolate as a mountain track . Soon after the frost began , a gentleman had been set upon in this lane as he picked his way between the corner where the bus had set him down , and his home where the fire was blazing , and his wife watched the clock . He was stumbling uncertainly through the gloom , growing a little nervous because the walk seemed so long , and peering anxiously for the lamp at the end of his street , when the two footpads rushed at him out of the fog . One caught him from behind , the other struck him with a heavy bludgeon , and as he lay senseless they robbed him of his watch and money , and vanished across the fields . The next morning all the suburb rang with the story ; the unfortunate merchant had been grievously hurt , and wives watched their husbands go out in the morning with sickening apprehension , not knowing what might happen at night . Lucian of course was ignorant of all these rumors , and struck into the gloomy by - road without caring where he was or whither the way would lead him . He had been driven out that day as with whips , another hopeless attempt to return to the work had agonised him , and existence seemed an intolerable pain . As he entered the deeper gloom , where the fog hung heavily , he began , half consciously , to gesticulate ; he felt convulsed with torment and shame , and it was a sorry relief to clench his nails into his palm and strike the air as he stumbled heavily along , bruising his feet against the frozen ruts and ridges . His impotence was hideous , he said to himself , and he cursed himself and his life , breaking out into a loud oath , and stamping on the ground . Suddenly he was shocked at a scream of terror , it seemed in his very ear , and looking up he saw for a moment a woman gazing at him out of the mist , her features distorted and stiff with fear . A momentary convulsion twitched her arms into the ugly mimicry of a beckoning gesture , and she turned and ran for dear life , howling like a beast . Lucian stood still in the road while the woman 's cries grew faint and died away . His heart was chilled within him as the significance of this strange incident became clear . He remembered nothing of his violent gestures ; he had not known at the time that he had sworn out loud , or that he was grinding his teeth with impotent rage . He only thought of that ringing scream , of the horrible fear on the white face that had looked upon him , of the woman 's headlong flight from his presence . He stood trembling and shuddering , and in a little while he was feeling his face , searching for some loathsome mark , for the stigmata of evil branding his forehead . He staggered homewards like a drunken man , and when he came into the Uxbridge Road some children saw him and called after him as he swayed and caught at the lamp - post . When he got to his room he sat down at first in the dark . He did not dare to light the gas . Everything in the room was indistinct , but he shut his eyes as he passed the dressing - table , and sat in a corner , his face turned to the wall . And when at last he gathered courage and the flame leapt hissing from the jet , he crept piteously towards the glass , and ducked his head , crouching miserably , and struggling with his terrors before he could look at his own image . To the best of his power he tried to deliver himself from these more grotesque fantasies ; he assured himself that there was nothing terrific in his countenance but sadness , that his face was like the face of other men . Yet he could not forget that reflection he had seen in the woman 's eyes , how the surest mirrors had shown him a horrible dread , her soul itself quailing and shuddering at an awful sight . Her scream rang and rang in his ears ; she had fled away from him as if he offered some fate darker than death . He looked again and again into the glass , tortured by a hideous uncertainty . His senses told him there was nothing amiss , yet he had had a proof , and yet , as he peered most earnestly , there was , it seemed , something strange and not altogether usual in the expression of the eyes . Perhaps it might be the unsteady flare of the gas , or perhaps a flaw in the cheap looking - glass , that gave some slight distortion to the image . He walked briskly up and down the room and tried to gaze steadily , indifferently , into his own face . He would not allow himself to be misguided by a word . When he had pronounced himself incapable of humanity , he had only meant that he could not enjoy the simple things of common life . A man was not necessarily monstrous , merely because he did not appreciate high tea , a quiet chat about the neighbors , and a happy noisy evening with the children . But with what message , then , did he appear charged that the woman 's mouth grew so stark ? Her hands had jerked up as if they had been pulled with frantic wires ; she seemed for the instant like a horrible puppet . Her scream was a thing from the nocturnal Sabbath . He lit a candle and held it close up to the glass so that his own face glared white at him , and the reflection of the room became an indistinct darkness . He saw nothing but the candle flame and his own shining eyes , and surely they were not as the eyes of common men . As he put down the light , a sudden suggestion entered his mind , and he drew a quick breath , amazed at the thought . He hardly knew whether to rejoice or to shudder . For the thought he conceived was this : that he had mistaken all the circumstances of the adventure , and had perhaps repulsed a sister who would have welcomed him to the Sabbath . He lay awake all night , turning from one dreary and frightful thought to the other , scarcely dozing for a few hours when the dawn came . He tried for a moment to argue with himself when he got up ; knowing that his true life was locked up in the bureau , he made a desperate attempt to drive the phantoms and hideous shapes from his mind . He was assured that his salvation was in the work , and he drew the key from his pocket , and made as if he would have opened the desk . But the nausea , the remembrances of repeated and utter failure , were too powerful . For many days he hung about the Manor Lane , half dreading , half desiring another meeting , and he swore he would not again mistake the cry of rapture , nor repulse the arms extended in a frenzy of delight . In those days he dreamed of some dark place where they might celebrate and make the marriage of the Sabbath , with such rites as he had dared to imagine . It was perhaps only the shock of a letter from his father that rescued him from these evident approaches to madness . Mr. Taylor wrote how they had missed him at Christmas , how the farmers had inquired after him , of the homely familiar things that recalled his boyhood , his mother 's voice , the friendly fireside , and the good old fashions that had nurtured him . He remembered that he had once been a boy , loving the cake and puddings and the radiant holly , and all the seventeenth - century mirth that lingered on in the ancient farmhouses . And there came to him the more holy memory of Mass on Christmas morning . How sweet the dark and frosty earth had smelt as he walked beside his mother down the winding lane , and from the stile near the church they had seen the world glimmering to the dawn , and the wandering lanthorns advancing across the fields . Then he had come into the church and seen it shining with candles and holly , and his father in pure vestments of white linen sang the longing music of the liturgy at the altar , and the people answered him , till the sun rose with the grave notes of the Paternoster , and a red beam stole through the chancel window . The worst horror left him as he recalled the memory of these dear and holy things . He cast away the frightful fancy that the scream he had heard was a shriek of joy , that the arms , rigidly jerked out , invited him to an embrace . Indeed , the thought that he had longed for such an obscene illusion , that he had gloated over the recollection of that stark mouth , filled him with disgust . He resolved that his senses were deceived , that he had neither seen nor heard , but had for a moment externalized his own slumbering and morbid dreams . It was perhaps necessary that he should be wretched , that his efforts should be discouraged , but he would not yield utterly to madness . Yet when he went abroad with such good resolutions , it was hard to resist an influence that seemed to come from without and within . He did not know it , but people were everywhere talking of the great frost , of the fog that lay heavy on London , making the streets dark and terrible , of strange birds that came fluttering about the windows in the silent squares . The Thames rolled out duskily , bearing down the jarring ice - blocks , and as one looked on the black water from the bridges it was like a river in a northern tale . To Lucian it all seemed mythical , of the same substance as his own fantastic thoughts . He rarely saw a newspaper , and did not follow from day to day the systematic readings of the thermometer , the reports of ice - fairs , of coaches driven across the river at Hampton , of the skating on the fens ; and hence the iron roads , the beleaguered silence and the heavy folds of mist appeared as amazing as a picture , significant , appalling . He could not look out and see a common suburban street foggy and dull , nor think of the inhabitants as at work or sitting cheerfully eating nuts about their fires ; he saw a vision of a grey road vanishing , of dim houses all empty and deserted , and the silence seemed eternal . And when he went out and passed through street after street , all void , by the vague shapes of houses that appeared for a moment and were then instantly swallowed up , it seemed to him as if he had strayed into a city that had suffered some inconceivable doom , that he alone wandered where myriads had once dwelt . It was a town as great as Babylon , terrible as Rome , marvelous as Lost Atlantis , set in the midst of a white wilderness surrounded by waste places . It was impossible to escape from it ; if he skulked between hedges , and crept away beyond the frozen pools , presently the serried stony lines confronted him like an army , and far and far they swept away into the night , as some fabled wall that guards an empire in the vast dim East . Or in that distorting medium of the mist , changing all things , he imagined that he trod an infinite desolate plain , abandoned from ages , but circled and encircled with dolmen and menhir that loomed out at him , gigantic , terrible . All London was one grey temple of an awful rite , ring within ring of wizard stones circled about some central place , every circle was an initiation , every initiation eternal loss . Or perhaps he was astray for ever in a land of grey rocks . He had seen the light of home , the flicker of the fire on the walls ; close at hand , it seemed , was the open door , and he had heard dear voices calling to him across the gloom , but he had just missed the path . The lamps vanished , the voices sounded thin and died away , and yet he knew that those within were waiting , that they could not bear to close the door , but waited , calling his name , while he had missed the way , and wandered in the pathless desert of the grey rocks . Fantastic , hideous , they beset him wherever he turned , piled up into strange shapes , pricked with sharp peaks , assuming the appearance of goblin towers , swelling into a vague dome like a fairy rath , huge and terrible . And as one dream faded into another , so these last fancies were perhaps the most tormenting and persistent ; the rocky avenues became the camp and fortalice of some half - human , malignant race who swarmed in hiding , ready to bear him away into the heart of their horrible hills . It was awful to think that all his goings were surrounded , that in the darkness he was watched and surveyed , that every step but led him deeper and deeper into the labyrinth . When , of an evening , he was secure in his room , the blind drawn down and the gas flaring , he made vigorous efforts toward sanity . It was not of his free will that he allowed terror to overmaster him , and he desired nothing better than a placid and harmless life , full of work and clear thinking . He knew that he deluded himself with imagination , that he had been walking through London suburbs and not through Pandemonium , and that if he could but unlock his bureau all those ugly forms would be resolved into the mist . But it was hard to say if he consoled himself effectually with such reflections , for the return to common sense meant also the return to the sharp pangs of defeat . It recalled him to the bitter theme of his own inefficiency , to the thought that he only desired one thing of life , and that this was denied him . He was willing to endure the austerities of a monk in a severe cloister , to suffer cold , to be hungry , to be lonely and friendless , to forbear all the consolation of friendly speech , and to be glad of all these things , if only he might be allowed to illuminate the manuscript in quietness . It seemed a hideous insufferable cruelty , that he should so fervently desire that which he could never gain . He was led back to the old conclusion ; he had lost the sense of humanity , he was wretched because he was an alien and a stranger amongst citizens . It seemed probable that the enthusiasm of literature , as he understood it , the fervent desire for the fine art , had in it something of the inhuman , and dissevered the enthusiast from his fellow - creatures . It was possible that the barbarian suspected as much , that by some slow process of rumination he had arrived at his fixed and inveterate impression , by no means a clear reasoned conviction ; the average Philistine , if pressed for the reasons of his dislike , would either become inarticulate , ejaculating "

55262	55285	56057	56058	His mother	340	" like an old - fashioned Scots Magazine , or else he would give some imaginary and absurd reason , alleging that all "
55288	55363	56057	56058	His mother	340	" were poor , that composers never cut their hair , that painters were rarely public - school men , that sculptors could n't ride straight to hounds to save their lives , but clearly these imbecilities were mere afterthoughts ; the average man hated the artist from a deep instinctive dread of all that was strange , uncanny , alien to his nature ; he gibbered , uttered his harsh , semi - bestial "
55366	56023	56057	56058	His mother	340	" and dismissed Keats to his gallipots from much the same motives as usually impelled the black savages to dismiss the white man on an even longer journey . Lucian was not especially interested in this hatred of the barbarian for the maker , except from this point , that it confirmed him in his belief that the love of art dissociated the man from the race . One touch of art made the whole world alien , but surely miseries of the civilized man cast amongst savages were not so much caused by dread of their ferocity as by the terror of his own thoughts ; he would perhaps in his last despair leave his retreat and go forth to perish at their hands , so that he might at least die in company , and hear the sound of speech before death . And Lucian felt most keenly that in his case there was a double curse ; he was as isolated as Keats , and as inarticulate as his reviewers . The consolation of the work had failed him , and he was suspended in the void between two worlds . It was no doubt the composite effect of his failures , his loneliness of soul , and solitude of life , that had made him invest those common streets with such grim and persistent terrors . He had perhaps yielded to a temptation without knowing that he had been tempted , and , in the manner of De Quincey , had chosen the subtle in exchange for the more tangible pains . Unconsciously , but still of free will , he had preferred the splendor and the gloom of a malignant vision before his corporal pains , before the hard reality of his own impotence . It was better to dwell in vague melancholy , to stray in the forsaken streets of a city doomed from ages , to wander amidst forlorn and desperate rocks than to awake to a gnawing and ignoble torment , to confess that a house of business would have been more suitable and more practical , that he had promised what he could never perform . Even as he struggled to beat back the phantasmagoria of the mist , and resolved that he would no longer make all the streets a stage of apparitions , he hardly realized what he had done , or that the ghosts he had called might depart and return again . He continued his long walks , always with the object of producing a physical weariness and exhaustion that would enable him to sleep of nights . But even when he saw the foggy and deserted avenues in their proper shape , and allowed his eyes to catch the pale glimmer of the lamps , and the dancing flame of the firelight , he could not rid himself of the impression that he stood afar off , that between those hearths and himself there was a great gulf fixed . As he paced down the footpath he could often see plainly across the frozen shrubs into the homely and cheerful rooms . Sometimes , late in the evening , he caught a passing glimpse of the family at tea , father , mother , and children laughing and talking together , well pleased with each other 's company . Sometimes a wife or a child was standing by the garden gate peering anxiously through the fog , and the sight of it all , all the little details , the hideous but comfortable armchairs turned ready to the fire , maroon - red curtains being drawn close to shut out the ugly night , the sudden blaze and illumination as the fire was poked up so that it might be cheerful for father ; these trivial and common things were acutely significant . They brought back to him the image of a dead boyâ€”himself

Romola , for example , had made the great host of the serious , the portentous , shout for joy , while the real book , The Cloister and the Hearth , was a comparative failure . He knew that he could write a Romola ; but he thought the art of counterfeiting half - crowns less detestable than this shabby trick of imitating literature . He had refused definitely to enter the atelier of the gentleman who pleased his clients by ingeniously simulating the grain of walnut ; and though he had seen the old oaken ambry kicked out contemptuously into the farmyard , serving perhaps the necessities of hens or pigs , he would not apprentice himself to the masters of veneer . He paced up and down the room , glancing now and again at his papers , and wondering if there were not hope for him . A great thing he could never do , but he had longed to do a true thing , to imagine sincere and genuine pages . He was stirred again to this fury for the work by the event of the evening before , by all that had passed through his mind since the melancholy dawn . The lurid picture of that fiery street , the flaming shops and flaming glances , all its wonders and horrors , lit by the naphtha flares and by the burning souls , had possessed him ; and the noises , the shriek and the whisper , the jangling rattle of the piano - organ , the long - continued scream of the butcher as he dabbled in the blood , the lewd litany of the singers , these seemed to be resolved into an infernal overture , loud with the expectation of lust and death . And how the spectacle was set in the cloud of dark night , a phantom play acted on that fiery stage , beneath those hideous brassy lamps , very slowly swinging in a violent blast . As all the medley of outrageous sights and sounds now fused themselves within his brain into one clear impression , it seemed that he had indeed witnessed and acted in a drama , that all the scene had been prepared and vested for him , and that the choric songs he had heard were but preludes to a greater act . For in that woman was the consummation and catastrophe of it all , and the whole stage waited for their meeting . He fancied that after this the voices and the lights died away , that the crowd sank swiftly into the darkness , and that the street was at once denuded of the great lamps and of all its awful scenic apparatus . Again , he thought , the same mystery would be represented before him ; suddenly on some dark and gloomy night , as he wandered lonely on a deserted road , the wind hurrying before him , suddenly a turn would bring him again upon the fiery stage , and the antique drama would be re - enacted . He would be drawn to the same place , to find that woman still standing there ; again he would watch the rose radiant and palpitating upon her cheek , the argent gleam in her brown eyes , the bronze curls gilding the white splendor of her neck . And for the second time she would freely offer herself . He could hear the wail of the singers swelling to a shriek , and see the dusky dancers whirling round in a faster frenzy , and the naphtha flares tinged with red , as the woman and he went away into the dark , into the cloistered court where every flower was a flame , whence he would never come out . His only escape was in the desk ; he might find salvation if he could again hide his heart in the heap and litter of papers , and again be rapt by the cadence of a phrase . He threw open his window and looked out on the dim world and the glimmering amber lights . He resolved that he would rise early in the morning , and seek once more for his true life in the work . But there was a strange thing . There was a little bottle on the mantelpiece , a bottle of dark blue glass , and he trembled and shuddered before it , as if it were a fetish . It was very dark in the room . He seemed by slow degrees to awake from a long and heavy torpor , from an utter forgetfulness , and as he raised his eyes he could scarcely discern the pale whiteness of the paper on the desk before him . He remembered something of a gloomy winter afternoon , of driving rain , of gusty wind : he had fallen asleep over his work , no doubt , and the night had come down . He lay back in his chair , wondering whether it were late ; his eyes were half closed , and he did not make the effort and rouse himself . He could hear the stormy noise of the wind , and the sound reminded him of the half - forgotten days . He thought of his boyhood , and the old rectory , and the great elms that surrounded it . There was something pleasant in the consciousness that he was still half dreaming ; he knew he could wake up whenever he pleased , but for the moment he amused himself by the pretence that he was a little boy again , tired with his rambles and the keen air of the hills . He remembered how he would sometimes wake up in the dark at midnight , and listen sleepily for a moment to the rush of the wind straining and crying amongst the trees , and hear it beat upon the walls , and then he would fall to dreams again , happy in his warm , snug bed . The wind grew louder , and the windows rattled . He half opened his eyes and shut them again , determined to cherish that sensation of long ago . He felt tired and heavy with sleep ; he imagined that he was exhausted by some effort ; he had , perhaps , been writing furiously without rest . He could not recollect at the instant what the work had been ; it would be delightful to read the pages when he had made up his mind to bestir himself . Surely that was the noise of boughs , swaying and grinding in the wind . He remembered one night at home when such a sound had roused him suddenly from a deep sweet sleep . There was a rushing and beating as of wings upon the air , and a heavy dreary noise , like thunder far away upon the mountain . He had got out of bed and looked from behind the blind to see what was abroad . He remembered the strange sight he had seen , and he pretended it would be just the same if he cared to look out now . There were clouds flying awfully from before the moon , and a pale light that made the familiar land look strange and terrible . The blast of wind came with a great shriek , and the trees tossed and bowed and quivered ; the wood was scourged and horrible , and the night air was ghastly with a confused tumult , and voices as of a host . A huge black cloud rolled across the heaven from the west and covered up the moon , and there came a torrent of bitter hissing rain . It was all a vivid picture to him as he sat in his chair , unwilling to wake . Even as he let his mind stray back to that night of the past years , the rain beat sharply on the window - panes , and though there were no trees in the grey suburban street , he heard distinctly the crash of boughs . He wandered vaguely from thought to thought , groping indistinctly amongst memories , like a man trying to cross from door to door in a darkened unfamiliar room . But , no doubt , if he were to look out , by some magic the whole scene would be displayed before him . He would not see the curve of monotonous two - storied houses , with here and there a white blind , a patch of light , and shadows appearing and vanishing , not the rain plashing in the muddy road , not the amber of the gas - lamp opposite , but the wild moonlight poured on the dearly loved country ; far away the dim circle of the hills and woods , and beneath him the tossing trees about the lawn , and the wood heaving under the fury of the wind . He smiled to himself , amidst his lazy meditations , to think how real it seemed , and yet it was all far away , the scenery of an old play long ended and forgotten . It was strange that after all these years of trouble and work and change he should be in any sense the same person as that little boy peeping out , half frightened , from the rectory window . It was as if looking in the glass one should see a stranger , and yet know that the image was a true reflection . The memory of the old home recalled his father and mother to him , and he wondered whether his mother would come if he were to cry out suddenly . One night , on just such a night as this , when a great storm blew from the mountain , a tree had fallen with a crash and a bough had struck the roof , and he awoke in a fright , calling for his mother . She had come and had comforted him , soothing him to sleep , and now he shut his eyes , seeing her face shining in the uncertain flickering candle light , as she bent over his bed . He could not think she had died ; the memory was but a part of the evil dreams that had come afterwards . He said to himself that he had fallen asleep and dreamed sorrow and agony , and he wished to forget all the things of trouble . He would return to happy days , to the beloved land , to the dear and friendly paths across the fields . There was the paper , white before him , and when he chose to stir , he would have the pleasure of reading his work . He could not quite recollect what he had been about , but he was somehow conscious that the had been successful and had brought some long labor to a worthy ending . Presently he would light the gas , and enjoy the satisfaction that only the work could give him , but for the time he preferred to linger in the darkness , and to think of himself as straying from stile to stile through the scented meadows , and listening to the bright brook that sang to the alders . It was winter now , for he heard the rain and the wind , and the swaying of the trees , but in those old days how sweet the summer had been . The great hawthorn bush in blossom , like a white cloud upon the earth , had appeared to him in twilight , he had lingered in the enclosed valley to hear the nightingale , a voice swelling out from the rich gloom , from the trees that grew around the well . The scent of the meadowsweet was blown to him across the bridge of years , and with it came the dream and the hope and the longing , and the afterglow red in the sky , and the marvel of the earth . There was a quiet walk that he knew so well ; one went up from a little green byroad , following an unnamed brooklet scarce a foot wide , but yet wandering like a river , gurgling over its pebbles , with its dwarf bushes shading the pouring water . One went through the meadow grass , and came to the larch wood that grew from hill to hill across the stream , and shone a brilliant tender green , and sent vague sweet spires to the flushing sky . Through the wood the path wound , turning and dipping , and beneath , the brown fallen needles of last year were soft and thick , and the resinous cones gave out their odor as the warm night advanced , and the shadows darkened . It was quite still ; but he stayed , and the faint song of the brooklet sounded like the echo of a river beyond the mountains . How strange it was to look into the wood , to see the tall straight stems rising , pillar - like , and then the dusk , uncertain , and then the blackness . So he came out from the larch wood , from the green cloud and the vague shadow , into the dearest of all hollows , shut in on one side by the larches and before him by high violent walls of turf , like the slopes of a fort , with a clear line dark against the twilight sky , and a weird thorn bush that grew large , mysterious , on the summit , beneath the gleam of the evening star . And he retraced his wanderings in those deep old lanes that began from the common road and went away towards the unknown , climbing steep hills , and piercing the woods of shadows , and dipping down into valleys that seemed virgin , unexplored , secret for the foot of man . He entered such a lane not knowing where it might bring him , hoping he had found the way to fairyland , to the woods beyond the world , to that vague territory that haunts all the dreams of a boy . He could not tell where he might be , for the high banks rose steep , and the great hedges made a green vault above . Marvelous ferns grew rich and thick in the dark red earth , fastening their roots about the roots of hazel and beech and maple , clustering like the carven capitals of a cathedral pillar . Down , like a dark shaft , the lane dipped to the well of the hills , and came amongst the limestone rocks . He climbed the bank at last , and looked out into a country that seemed for a moment the land he sought , a mysterious realm with unfamiliar hills and valleys and fair plains all golden , and white houses radiant in the sunset light . And he thought of the steep hillsides where the bracken was like a wood , and of bare places where the west wind sang over the golden gorse , of still circles in mid - lake , of the poisonous yew - tree in the middle of the wood , shedding its crimson cups on the dank earth . How he lingered by certain black waterpools hedged on every side by drooping wych - elms and black - stemmed alders , watching the faint waves widening to the banks as a leaf or a twig dropped from the trees . And the whole air and wonder of the ancient forest came back to him . He had found his way to the river valley , to the long lovely hollow between the hills , and went up and up beneath the leaves in the warm hush of midsummer , glancing back now and again through the green alleys , to the river winding in mystic esses beneath , passing hidden glens receiving the streams that rushed down the hillside , ice - cold from the rock , passing the immemorial tumulus , the graves where the legionaries waited for the trumpet , the grey farmhouses sending the blue wreaths of wood smoke into the still air . He went higher and higher , till at last he entered the long passage of the Roman road , and from this , the ridge and summit of the wood , he saw the waves of green swell and dip and sink towards the marshy level and the gleaming yellow sea . He looked on the surging forest , and thought of the strange deserted city moldering into a petty village on its verge , of its encircling walls melting into the turf , of vestiges of an older temple which the earth had buried utterly . It was winter now , for he heard the wail of the wind , and a sudden gust drove the rain against the panes , but he thought of the bee 's song in the clover , of the foxgloves in full blossom , of the wild roses , delicate , enchanting , swaying on a long stem above the hedge . He had been in strange places , he had known sorrow and desolation , and had grown grey and weary in the work of letters , but he lived again in the sweetness , in the clear bright air of early morning , when the sky was blue in June , and the mist rolled like a white sea in the valley . He laughed when he recollected that he had sometimes fancied himself unhappy in those days ; in those days when he could be glad because the sun shone , because the wind blew fresh on the mountain . On those bright days he had been glad , looking at the fleeting and passing of the clouds upon the hills , and had gone up higher to the broad dome of the mountain , feeling that joy went up before him . He remembered how , a boy , he had dreamed of love , of an adorable and ineffable mystery which transcended all longing and desire . The time had come when all the wonder of the earth seemed to prefigure this alone , when he found the symbol of the Beloved in hill and wood and stream , and every flower and every dark pool discoursed a pure ecstasy . It was the longing for longing , the love of love , that had come to him when he awoke one morning just before the dawn , and for the first time felt the sharp thrill of passion . He tried in vain to express to himself the exquisite joys of innocent desire . Even now , after troubled years , in spite of some dark cloud that overshadowed the background of his thought , the sweetness of the boy 's imagined pleasure came like a perfume into his reverie . It was no love of a woman but the desire of womanhood , the Eros of the unknown , that made the heart tremble . He hardly dreamed that such a love could ever be satisfied , that the thirst of beauty could be slaked . He shrank from all contact of actuality , not venturing so much as to imagine the inner place and sanctuary of the mysteries . It was enough for him to adore in the outer court , to know that within , in the sweet gloom , were the vision and the rapture , the altar and the sacrifice . He remembered , dimly , the passage of many heavy years since that time of hope and passion , but , perhaps , the vague shadow would pass away , and he could renew the boy 's thoughts , the unformed fancies that were part of the bright day , of the wild roses in the hedgerow . All other things should be laid aside , he would let them trouble him no more after this winter night . He saw now that from the first he had allowed his imagination to bewilder him , to create a fantastic world in which he suffered , molding innocent forms into terror and dismay . Vividly , he saw again the black circle of oaks , growing in a haggard ring upon the bastions of the Roman fort . The noise of the storm without grew louder , and he thought how the wind had come up the valley with the sound of a scream , how a great tree had ground its boughs together , shuddering before the violent blast . Clear and distinct , as if he were standing now in the lane , he saw the steep slopes surging from the valley , and the black crown of the oaks set against the flaming sky , against a blaze and glow of light as if great furnace doors were opened . He saw the fire , as it were , smitten about the bastions , about the heaped mounds that guarded the fort , and the crooked evil boughs seemed to writhe in the blast of flame that beat from heaven . Strangely with the sight of the burning fort mingled the impression of a dim white shape floating up the dusk of the lane towards him , and he saw across the valley of years a girl 's face , a momentary apparition that shone and vanished away . Then there was a memory of another day , of violent summer , of white farmhouse walls blazing in the sun , and a far call from the reapers in the cornfields . He had climbed the steep slope and penetrated the matted thicket and lay in the heat , alone on the soft short grass that grew within the fort . There was a cloud of madness , and confusion of broken dreams that had no meaning or clue but only an indefinable horror and defilement . He had fallen asleep as he gazed at the knotted fantastic boughs of the stunted brake about him , and when he woke he was ashamed , and fled away fearing that "
63794	63804	63793	63793	they	1501	" would pursue him . He did not know who "
63806	68539	69577	69577	Your	1502	" were , but it seemed as if a woman 's face watched him from between the matted boughs , and that she summoned to her side awful companions who had never grown old through all the ages . He looked up , it seemed , at a smiling face that bent over him , as he sat in the cool dark kitchen of the old farmhouse , and wondered why the sweetness of those red lips and the kindness of the eyes mingled with the nightmare in the fort , with the horrible Sabbath he had imagined as he lay sleeping on the hot soft turf . He had allowed these disturbed fancies , all this mad wreck of terror and shame that he had gathered in his mind , to trouble him for too long a time ; presently he would light up the room , and leave all the old darkness of his life behind him , and from henceforth he would walk in the day . He could still distinguish , though very vaguely , the pile of papers beside him , and he remembered , now , that he had finished a long task that afternoon , before he fell asleep . He could not trouble himself to recollect the exact nature of the work , but he was sure that he had done well ; in a few minutes , perhaps , he would strike a match , and read the title , and amuse himself with his own forgetfulness . But the sight of the papers lying there in order made him think of his beginnings , of those first unhappy efforts which were so impossible and so hopeless . He saw himself bending over the table in the old familiar room , desperately scribbling , and then laying down his pen dismayed at the sad results on the page . It was late at night , his father had been long in bed , and the house was still . The fire was almost out , with only a dim glow here and there amongst the cinders , and the room was growing chilly . He rose at last from his work and looked out on a dim earth and a dark and cloudy sky . Night after night he had labored on , persevering in his effort , even through the cold sickness of despair , when every line was doomed as it was made . Now , with the consciousness that he knew at least the conditions of literature , and that many years of thought and practice had given him some sense of language , he found these early struggles both pathetic and astonishing . He could not understand how he had persevered so stubbornly , how he had had the heart to begin a fresh page when so many folios of blotted , painful effort lay torn , derided , impossible in their utter failure . It seemed to him that it must have been a miracle or an infernal possession , a species of madness , that had driven him on , every day disappointed , and every day hopeful . And yet there was a joyous side to the illusion . In these dry days that he lived in , when he had bought , by a long experience and by countless hours of misery , a knowledge of his limitations , of the vast gulf that yawned between the conception and the work , it was pleasant to think of a time when all things were possible , when the most splendid design seemed an affair of a few weeks . Now he had come to a frank acknowledgment ; so far as he was concerned , he judged every book wholly impossible till the last line of it was written , and he had learnt patience , the art of sighing and putting the fine scheme away in the pigeon - hole of what could never be . But to think of those days ! Then one could plot out a book that should be more curious than Rabelais , and jot down the outlines of a romance to surpass Cervantes , and design renaissance tragedies and volumes of contes , and comedies of the Restoration ; everything was to be done , and the masterpiece was always the rainbow cup , a little way before him . He touched the manuscript on the desk , and the feeling of the pages seemed to restore all the papers that had been torn so long ago . It was the atmosphere of the silent room that returned , the light of the shaded candle falling on the abandoned leaves . This had been painfully excogitated while the snowstorm whirled about the lawn and filled the lanes , this was of the summer night , this of the harvest moon rising like a fire from the tithebarn on the hill . How well he remembered those half - dozen pages of which he had once been so proud ; he had thought out the sentences one evening , while he leaned on the foot - bridge and watched the brook swim across the road . Every word smelt of the meadowsweet that grew thick upon the banks ; now , as he recalled the cadence and the phrase that had seemed so charming , he saw again the ferns beneath the vaulted roots of the beech , and the green light of the glowworm in the hedge . And in the west the mountains swelled to a great dome , and on the dome was a mound , the memorial of some forgotten race , that grew dark and large against the red sky , when the sun set . He had lingered below it in the solitude , amongst the winds , at evening , far away from home ; and oh , the labor and the vain efforts to make the form of it and the awe of it in prose , to write the hush of the vast hill , and the sadness of the world below sinking into the night , and the mystery , the suggestion of the rounded hillock , huge against the magic sky . He had tried to sing in words the music that the brook sang , and the sound of the October wind rustling through the brown bracken on the hill . How many pages he had covered in the effort to show a white winter world , a sun without warmth in a grey - blue sky , all the fields , all the land white and shining , and one high summit where the dark pines towered , still in the still afternoon , in the pale violet air . To win the secret of words , to make a phrase that would murmur of summer and the bee , to summon the wind into a sentence , to conjure the odor of the night into the surge and fall and harmony of a line ; this was the tale of the long evenings , of the candle flame white upon the paper and the eager pen . He remembered that in some fantastic book he had seen a bar or two of music , and , beneath , the inscription that here was the musical expression of Westminster Abbey . His boyish effort seemed hardly less ambitious , and he no longer believed that language could present the melody and the awe and the loveliness of the earth . He had long known that he , at all events , would have to be content with a far approach , with a few broken notes that might suggest , perhaps , the magistral everlasting song of the hill and the streams . But in those far days the impossible was but a part of wonderland that lay before him , of the world beyond the wood and the mountain . All was to be conquered , all was to be achieved ; he had but to make the journey and he would find the golden world and the golden word , and hear those songs that the sirens sang . He touched the manuscript ; whatever it was , it was the result of painful labor and disappointment , not of the old flush of hope , but it came of weary days , of correction and re - correction . It might be good in its measure ; but afterwards he would write no more for a time . He would go back again to the happy world of masterpieces , to the dreams of great and perfect books , written in an ecstasy . Like a dark cloud from the sea came the memory of the attempt he had made , of the poor piteous history that had once embittered his life . He sighed and said alas , thinking of his folly , of the hours when he was shaken with futile , miserable rage . Some silly person in London had made his manuscript more saleable and had sold it without rendering an account of the profits , and for that he had been ready to curse humanity . Black , horrible , as the memory of a stormy day , the rage of his heart returned to his mind , and he covered his eyes , endeavoring to darken the picture of terror and hate that shone before him . He tried to drive it all out of his thought , it vexed him to remember these foolish trifles ; the trick of a publisher , the small pomposities and malignancies of the country folk , the cruelty of a village boy , had inflamed him almost to the pitch of madness . His heart had burnt with fury , and when he looked up the sky was blotched , and scarlet as if it rained blood . Indeed he had almost believed that blood had rained upon him , and cold blood from a sacrifice in heaven ; his face was wet and chill and dripping , and he had passed his hand across his forehead and looked at it . A red cloud had seemed to swell over the hill , and grow great , and come near to him ; he was but an ace removed from raging madness . It had almost come to that ; the drift and the breath of the scarlet cloud had well - nigh touched him . It was strange that he had been so deeply troubled by such little things , and strange how after all the years he could still recall the anguish and rage and hate that shook his soul as with a spiritual tempest . The memory of all that evening was wild and troubled ; he resolved that it should vex him no more , that now , for the last time , he would let himself be tormented by the past . In a few minutes he would rise to a new life , and forget all the storms that had gone over him . Curiously , every detail was distinct and clear in his brain . The figure of the doctor driving home , and the sound of the few words he had spoken came to him in the darkness , through the noise of the storm and the pattering of the rain . Then he stood upon the ridge of the hill and saw the smoke drifting up from the ragged roofs of Caermaen , in the evening calm ; he listened to the voices mounting thin and clear , in a weird tone , as if some outland folk were speaking in an unknown tongue of awful things . He saw the gathering darkness , the mystery of twilight changing the huddled squalid village into an unearthly city , into some dreadful Atlantis , inhabited by a ruined race . The mist falling fast , the gloom that seemed to issue from the black depths of the forest , to advance palpably towards the walls , were shaped before him ; and beneath , the river wound , snake - like , about the town , swimming to the flood and glowing in its still pools like molten brass . And as the water mirrored the afterglow and sent ripples and gouts of blood against the shuddering reeds , there came suddenly the piercing trumpet - call , the loud reiterated summons that rose and fell , that called and recalled , echoing through all the valley , crying to the dead as the last note rang . It summoned the legion from the river and the graves and the battlefield , the host floated up from the sea , the centuries swarmed about the eagles , the array was set for the last great battle , behind the leaguer of the mist . He could imagine himself still wandering through the dim unknown , terrible country , gazing affrighted at the hills and woods that seemed to have put on an unearthly shape , stumbling amongst the briars that caught his feet . He lost his way in a wild country , and the red light that blazed up from the furnace on the mountains only showed him a mysterious land , in which he strayed aghast , with the sense of doom weighing upon him . The dry mutter of the trees , the sound of an unseen brook , made him afraid as if the earth spoke of his sin , and presently he was fleeing through a desolate shadowy wood , where a pale light flowed from the moldering stumps , a dream of light that shed a ghostly radiance . And then again the dark summit of the Roman fort , the black sheer height rising above the valley , and the moonfire streaming around the ring of oaks , glowing about the green bastions that guarded the thicket and the inner place . The room in which he sat appeared the vision , the trouble of the wind and rain without was but illusion , the noise of the waves in the seashell . Passion and tears and adoration and the glories of the summer night returned , and the calm sweet face of the woman appeared , and he thrilled at the soft touch of her hand on his flesh . She shone as if she had floated down into the lane from the moon that swam between films of cloud above the black circle of the oaks . She led him away from all terror and despair and hate , and gave herself to him with rapture , showing him love , kissing his tears away , pillowing his cheek upon her breast . His lips dwelt on her lips , his mouth upon the breath of her mouth , her arms were strained about him , and oh ! she charmed him with her voice , with sweet kind words , as she offered her sacrifice . How her scented hair fell down , and floated over his eyes , and there was a marvelous fire called the moon , and her lips were aflame , and her eyes shone like a light on the hills . All beautiful womanhood had come to him in the lane . Love had touched him in the dusk and had flown away , but he had seen the splendor and the glory , and his eyes had seen the enchanted light . AVE ATQUE VALE The old words sounded in his ears like the ending of a chant , and he heard the music 's close . Once only in his weary hapless life , once the world had passed away , and he had known her , the dear , dear Annie , the symbol of all mystic womanhood . The heaviness of languor still oppressed him , holding him back amongst these old memories , so that he could not stir from his place . Oddly , there seemed something unaccustomed about the darkness of the room , as if the shadows he had summoned had changed the aspect of the walls . He was conscious that on this night he was not altogether himself ; fatigue , and the weariness of sleep , and the waking vision had perplexed him . He remembered how once or twice when he was a little boy startled by an uneasy dream , and had stared with a frightened gaze into nothingness , not knowing where he was , all trembling , and breathing quick , till he touched the rail of his bed , and the familiar outlines of the looking - glass and the chiffonier began to glimmer out of the gloom . So now he touched the pile of manuscript and the desk at which he had worked so many hours , and felt reassured , though he smiled at himself , and he felt the old childish dread , the longing to cry out for some one to bring a candle , and show him that he really was in his own room . He glanced up for an instant , expecting to see perhaps the glitter of the brass gas jet that was fixed on the wall , just beside his bureau , but it was too dark , and he could not rouse himself and make the effort that would drive the cloud and the muttering thoughts away . He leant back again , picturing the wet street without , the rain driving like fountain spray about the gas lamp , the shrilling of the wind on those waste places to the north . It was strange how in the brick and stucco desert where no trees were , he all the time imagined the noise of tossing boughs , the grinding of the boughs together . There was a great storm and tumult in this wilderness of London , and for the sound of the rain and the wind he could not hear the hum and jangle of the trams , and the jar and shriek of the garden gates as they opened and shut . But he could imagine his street , the rain - swept desolate curve of it , as it turned northward , and beyond the empty suburban roads , the twinkling villa windows , the ruined field , the broken lane , and then yet another suburb rising , a solitary gas - lamp glimmering at a corner , and the plane tree lashing its boughs , and driving great showers against the glass . It was wonderful to think of . For when these remote roads were ended one dipped down the hill into the open country , into the dim world beyond the glint of friendly fires . Tonight , how waste they were , these wet roads , edged with the red - brick houses , with shrubs whipped by the wind against one another , against the paling and the wall . There the wind swayed the great elms scattered on the sidewalk , the remnants of the old stately fields , and beneath each tree was a pool of wet , and a torment of raindrops fell with every gust . And one passed through the red avenues , perhaps by a little settlement of flickering shops , and passed the last sentinel wavering lamp , and the road became a ragged lane , and the storm screamed from hedge to hedge across the open fields . And then , beyond , one touched again upon a still remoter avant - garde of London , an island amidst the darkness , surrounded by its pale of twinkling , starry lights . He remembered his wanderings amongst these outposts of the town , and thought how desolate all their ways must be tonight . They were solitary in wet and wind , and only at long intervals some one pattered and hurried along them , bending his eyes down to escape the drift of rain . Within the villas , behind the close - drawn curtains , they drew about the fire , and wondered at the violence of the storm , listening for each great gust as it gathered far away , and rocked the trees , and at last rushed with a huge shock against their walls as if it were the coming of the sea . He thought of himself walking , as he had often walked , from lamp to lamp on such a night , treasuring his lonely thoughts , and weighing the hard task awaiting him in his room . Often in the evening , after a long day 's labor , he had thrown down his pen in utter listlessness , feeling that he could struggle no more with ideas and words , and he had gone out into driving rain and darkness , seeking the word of the enigma as he tramped on and on beneath these outer battlements of London . Or on some grey afternoon in March or November he had sickened of the dull monotony and the stagnant life that he saw from his window , and had taken his design with him to the lonely places , halting now and again by a gate , and pausing in the shelter of a hedge through which the austere wind shivered , while , perhaps , he dreamed of Sicily , or of sunlight on the Provençal olives . Often as he strayed solitary from street to field , and passed the Syrian fig tree imprisoned in Britain , nailed to an ungenial wall , the solution of the puzzle became evident , and he laughed and hurried home eager to make the page speak , to note the song he had heard on his way . Sometimes he had spent many hours treading this edge and brim of London , now lost amidst the dun fields , watching the bushes shaken by the wind , and now looking down from a height whence he could see the dim waves of the town , and a barbaric water tower rising from a hill , and the snuff - colored cloud of smoke that seemed blown up from the streets into the sky . There were certain ways and places that he had cherished ; he loved a great old common that stood on high ground , curtained about with ancient spacious houses of red brick , and their cedarn gardens . And there was on the road that led to this common a space of ragged uneven ground with a pool and a twisted oak , and here he had often stayed in autumn and looked across the mist and the valley at the great theatre of the sunset , where a red cloud like a charging knight shone and conquered a purple dragon shape , and golden lances glittered in a field of faerie green . Or sometimes , when the unending prospect of trim , monotonous , modern streets had wearied him , he had found an immense refreshment in the discovery of a forgotten hamlet , left in a hollow , while all new London pressed and surged on every side , threatening the rest of the red roofs with its vulgar growth . These little peaceful houses , huddled together beneath the shelter of trees , with their bulging leaded windows and uneven roofs , somehow brought back to him the sense of the country , and soothed him with the thought of the old farm - houses , white or grey , the homes of quiet lives , harbors where , perhaps , no tormenting thoughts ever broke in . For he had instinctively determined that there was neither rest nor health in all the arid waste of streets about him . It seemed as if in those dull rows of dwellings , in the prim new villas , red and white and staring , there must be a leaven working which transformed all to base vulgarity . Beneath the dull sad slates , behind the blistered doors , love turned to squalid intrigue , mirth to drunken clamor , and the mystery of life became a common thing ; religion was sought for in the greasy piety and flatulent oratory of the Independent chapel , the stuccoed nightmare of the Doric columns . Nothing fine , nothing rare , nothing exquisite , it seemed , could exist in the weltering suburban sea , in the habitations which had risen from the stench and slime of the brickfields . It was as if the sickening fumes that steamed from the burning bricks had been sublimed into the shape of houses , and those who lived in these grey places could also claim kinship with the putrid mud . Hence he had delighted in the few remains of the past that he could find still surviving on the suburb 's edge , in the grave old houses that stood apart from the road , in the moldering taverns of the eighteenth century , in the huddled hamlets that had preserved only the glow and the sunlight of all the years that had passed over them . It appeared to him that vulgarity and greasiness and squalor had come with a flood , that not only the good but also the evil in man 's heart had been made common and ugly , that a sordid scum was mingled with all the springs , of death as of life . It would be alike futile to search amongst these mean two - storied houses for a splendid sinner as for a splendid saint ; the very vices of these people smelt of cabbage water and a pothouse vomit . And so he had often fled away from the serried maze that encircled him , seeking for the old and worn and significant as an antiquary looks for the fragments of the Roman temple amidst the modern shops . In some way the gusts of wind and the beating rain of the night reminded him of an old house that had often attracted him with a strange indefinable curiosity . He had found it on a grim grey day in March , when he had gone out under a leaden - molded sky , cowering from a dry freezing wind that brought with it the gloom and the doom of far unhappy Siberian plains . More than ever that day the suburb had oppressed him ; insignificant , detestable , repulsive to body and mind , it was the only hell that a vulgar age could conceive or make , an inferno created not by Dante but by the jerry - builder . He had gone out to the north , and when he lifted up his eyes again he found that he had chanced to turn up by one of the little lanes that still strayed across the broken fields . He had never chosen this path before because the lane at its outlet was so wholly degraded and offensive , littered with rusty tins and broken crockery , and hedged in with a paling fashioned out of scraps of wire , rotting timber , and bending worn - out rails . But on this day , by happy chance , he had fled from the high road by the first opening that offered , and he no longer groped his way amongst obscene refuse , sickened by the bloated bodies of dead dogs , and fetid odors from unclean decay , but the malpassage had become a peaceful winding lane , with warm shelter beneath its banks from the dismal wind . For a mile he had walked quietly , and then a turn in the road showed him a little glen or hollow , watered by such a tiny rushing brooklet as his own woods knew , and beyond , alas , the glaring foreguard of a "
68542	69576	69577	69579	Your poor father	1503	" ; raw red villas , semi - detached , and then a row of lamentable shops . But as he was about to turn back , in the hope of finding some other outlet , his attention was charmed by a small house that stood back a little from the road on his right hand . There had been a white gate , but the paint had long faded to grey and black , and the wood crumbled under the touch , and only moss marked out the lines of the drive . The iron railing round the lawn had fallen , and the poor flower - beds were choked with grass and a faded growth of weeds . But here and there a rosebush lingered amidst suckers that had sprung grossly from the root , and on each side of the hall door were box trees , untrimmed , ragged , but still green . The slate roof was all stained and livid , blotched with the drippings of a great elm that stood at one corner of the neglected lawn , and marks of damp and decay were thick on the uneven walls , which had been washed yellow many years before . There was a porch of trellis work before the door , and Lucian had seen it rock in the wind , swaying as if every gust must drive it down . There were two windows on the ground floor , one on each side of the door , and two above , with a blind space where a central window had been blocked up . This poor and desolate house had fascinated him . Ancient and poor and fallen , disfigured by the slate roof and the yellow wash that had replaced the old mellow dipping tiles and the warm red walls , and disfigured again by spots and patches of decay ; it seemed as if its happy days were for ever ended . To Lucian it appealed with a sense of doom and horror ; the black streaks that crept upon the walls , and the green drift upon the roof , appeared not so much the work of foul weather and dripping boughs , as the outward signs of evil working and creeping in the lives of those within . The stage seemed to him decked for doom , painted with the symbols of tragedy ; and he wondered as he looked whether any one were so unhappy as to live there still . There were torn blinds in the windows , but he had asked himself who could be so brave as to sit in that room , darkened by the dreary box , and listen of winter nights to the rain upon the window , and the moaning of wind amongst the tossing boughs that beat against the roof . He could not imagine that any chamber in such a house was habitable . Here the dead had lain , through the white blind the thin light had filtered on the rigid mouth , and still the floor must be wet with tears and still that great rocking elm echoed the groaning and the sobs of those who watched . No doubt , the damp was rising , and the odor of the earth filled the house , and made such as entered draw back , foreseeing the hour of death . Often the thought of this strange old house had haunted him ; he had imagined the empty rooms where a heavy paper peeled from the walls and hung in dark strips ; and he could not believe that a light ever shone from those windows that stared black and glittering on the neglected lawn . But tonight the wet and the storm seemed curiously to bring the image of the place before him , and as the wind sounded he thought how unhappy those must be , if any there were , who sat in the musty chambers by a flickering light , and listened to the elm - tree moaning and beating and weeping on the walls . And tonight was Saturday night ; and there was about that phrase something that muttered of the condemned cell , of the agony of a doomed man . Ghastly to his eyes was the conception of any one sitting in that room to the right of the door behind the larger box tree , where the wall was cracked above the window and smeared with a black stain in an ugly shape . He knew how foolish it had been in the first place to trouble his mind with such conceits of a dreary cottage on the outskirts of London . And it was more foolish now to meditate these things , fantasies , feigned forms , the issue of a sad mood and a bleak day of spring . For soon , in a few moments , he was to rise to a new life . He was but reckoning up the account of his past , and when the light came he was to think no more of sorrow and heaviness , of real or imagined terrors . He had stayed too long in London , and he would once more taste the breath of the hills , and see the river winding in the long lovely valley ; ah ! he would go home . Something like a thrill , the thrill of fear , passed over him as he remembered that there was no home . It was in the winter , a year and a half after his arrival in town , that he had suffered the loss of his father . He lay for many days prostrate , overwhelmed with sorrow and with the thought that now indeed he was utterly alone in the world . Miss Deacon was to live with another cousin in Yorkshire ; the old home was at last ended and done . He felt sorry that he had not written more frequently to his father : there were things in his cousin 's letters that had made his heart sore . "

69655	70000	70033	70033	him	0	" It was not only his father that had died , but with him the last strong link was broken , and the past life , the days of his boyhood , grew faint as a dream . With his father his mother died again , and the long years died , the time of his innocence , the memory of affection . He was sorry that his letters had gone home so rarely ; it hurt him to imagine his father looking out when the post came in the morning , and forced to be sad because there was nothing . But he had never thought that his father valued the few lines that he wrote , and indeed it was often difficult to know what to say . It would have been useless to write of those agonizing nights when the pen seemed an awkward and outlandish instrument , when every effort ended in shameful defeat , or of the happier hours when at last wonder appeared and the line glowed , crowned and exalted . To poor Mr. Taylor such tales would have seemed but trivial histories of some Oriental game , like an odd story from a land where men have time for the infinitely little , and can seriously make a science of arranging blossoms in a jar , and discuss perfumes instead of politics . It would have been useless to write to the rectory of his only interest , and so he wrote seldom . And then he had been sorry because he could never write again and never see his home . He had wondered whether he would have gone down to the old place at Christmas , if his father had lived . It was curious how common things evoked the bitterest griefs , but his father 's anxiety that the plum - pudding should be good , and ready for him , had brought the tears into his eyes . He could hear him saying in a nervous voice that attempted to be cheerful : "
70037	70607	70033	70033	him	0	" No doubt poor Miss Deacon paled with rage at the suggestion that she should make Christmas pudding in July ; and returned a sharp answer ; but it was pathetic . The wind wailed , and the rain dashed and beat again and again upon the window . He imagined that all his thoughts of home , of the old rectory amongst the elms , had conjured into his mind the sound of the storm upon the trees , for , tonight , very clearly he heard the creaking of the boughs , the noise of boughs moaning and beating and weeping on the walls , and even a pattering of wet , on wet earth , as if there were a shrub near the window that shook off the raindrops , before the gust . That thrill , as it were a shudder of fear , passed over him again , and he knew not what had made him afraid . There were some dark shadow on his mind that saddened him ; it seemed as if a vague memory of terrible days hung like a cloud over his thought , but it was all indefinite , perhaps the last grim and ragged edge of the melancholy wrack that had swelled over his life and the bygone years . He shivered and tried to rouse himself and drive away the sense of dread and shame that seemed so real and so awful , and yet he could not grasp it . But the torpor of sleep , the burden of the work that he had ended a few hours before , still weighed down his limb and bound his thoughts . He could scarcely believe that he had been busy at his desk a little while ago , and that just before the winter day closed it and the rain began to fall he had laid down the pen with a sigh of relief , and had slept in his chair . It was rather as if he had slumbered deeply through a long and weary night , as if an awful vision of flame and darkness and the worm that dieth not had come to him sleeping . But he would dwell no more on the darkness ; he went back to the early days in London when he had said farewell to the hills and to the waterpools , and had set to work in this little room in the dingy street . How he had toiled and labored at the desk before him ! He had put away the old wild hopes of the masterpiece conceived and executed in a fury of inspiration , wrought out in one white heat of creative joy ; it was enough if by dint of long perseverance and singleness of desire he could at last , in pain and agony and despair , after failure and disappointment and effort constantly renewed , fashion something of which he need not be ashamed . He had put himself to school again , and had , with what patience he could command , ground his teeth into the rudiments , resolved that at last he would test out the heart of the mystery . They were good nights to remember , these ; he was glad to think of the little ugly room , with its silly wall - paper and its "
70611	70757	70820	70820	She	90	" furniture , lighted up , while he sat at the bureau and wrote on into the cold stillness of the London morning , when the flickering lamplight and the daystar shone together . It was an interminable labor , and he had always known it to be as hopeless as alchemy . The gold , the great and glowing masterpiece , would never shine amongst the dead ashes and smoking efforts of the crucible , but in the course of the life , in the interval between the failures , he might possibly discover curious things . These were the good nights that he could look back on without any fear or shame , when he had been happy and content on a diet of bread and tea and tobacco , and could hear of some imbecility passing into its hundredth thousand , and laugh cheerfullyâ€”if

73474	75131	75135	75135	Joe	263	thenâ€”but all the months afterwards seemed doubtful , there were only broken revelations of the laborious hours renewed , and the white nights when he had seen the moonlight fade and the gaslight grow wan at the approach of dawn . He listened . Surely that was the sound of rain falling on sodden ground , the heavy sound of great swollen drops driven down from wet leaves by the gust of wind , and then again the strain of boughs sang above the tumult of the air ; there was a doleful noise as if the storm shook the masts of a ship . He had only to get up and look out of the window and he would see the treeless empty street , and the rain starring the puddles under the gas - lamp , but he would wait a little while . He tried to think why , in spite of all his resolutions , a dark horror seemed to brood more and more over all his mind . How often he had sat and worked on just such nights as this , contented if the words were in accord though the wind might wail , though the air were black with rain . Even about the little book that he had made there seemed some taint , some shuddering memory that came to him across the gulf of forgetfulness . Somehow the remembrance of the offering to Venus , of the phrases that he had so lovingly invented , brought back again the dusky figures that danced in the orgy , beneath the brassy glittering lamps ; and again the naphtha flares showed the way to the sad house in the fields , and the red glare lit up the mildewed walls and the black hopeless windows . He gasped for breath , he seemed to inhale a heavy air that reeked of decay and rottenness , and the odor of the clay was in his nostrils . That unknown cloud that had darkened his thoughts grew blacker and engulfed him , despair was heavy upon him , his heart fainted with a horrible dread . In a moment , it seemed , a veil would be drawn away and certain awful things would appear . He strove to rise from his chair , to cry out , but he could not . Deep , deep the darkness closed upon him , and the storm sounded far away . The Roman fort surged up , terrific , and he saw the writhing boughs in a ring , and behind them a glow and heat of fire . There were hideous shapes that swarmed in the thicket of the oaks ; they called and beckoned to him , and rose into the air , into the flame that was smitten from heaven about the walls . And amongst them was the form of the beloved , but jets of flame issued from her breasts , and beside her was a horrible old woman , naked ; and they , too , summoned him to mount the hill . He heard Dr. Burrows whispering of the strange things that had been found in old Mrs. Gibbon 's cottage , obscene figures , and unknown contrivances . She was a witch , he said , and the mistress of witches . He fought against the nightmare , against the illusion that bewildered him . All his life , he thought , had been an evil dream , and for the common world he had fashioned an unreal red garment , that burned in his eyes . Truth and the dream were so mingled that now he could not divide one from the other . He had let Annie drink his soul beneath the hill , on the night when the moonfire shone , but he had not surely seen her exalted in the flame , the Queen of the Sabbath . Dimly he remembered Dr. Burrows coming to see him in London , but had he not imagined all the rest ? Again he found himself in the dusky lane , and Annie floated down to him from the moon above the hill . His head sank upon her breast again , but , alas , it was aflame . And he looked down , and he saw that his own flesh was aflame , and he knew that the fire could never be quenched . There was a heavy weight upon his head , his feet were nailed to the floor , and his arms bound tight beside him . He seemed to himself to rage and struggle with the strength of a madman ; but his hand only stirred and quivered a little as it lay upon the desk . Again he was astray in the mist ; wandering through the waste avenues of a city that had been ruined from ages . It had been splendid as Rome , terrible as Babylon , and for ever the darkness had covered it , and it lay desolate for ever in the accursed plain . And far and far the grey passages stretched into the night , into the icy fields , into the place of eternal gloom . Ring within ring the awful temple closed around him ; unending circles of vast stones , circle within circle , and every circle less throughout all ages . In the center was the sanctuary of the infernal rite , and he was borne thither as in the eddies of a whirlpool , to consummate his ruin , to celebrate the wedding of the Sabbath . He flung up his arms and beat the air , resisting with all his strength , with muscles that could throw down mountains ; and this time his little finger stirred for an instant , and his foot twitched upon the floor . Then suddenly a flaring street shone before him . There was darkness round about him , but it flamed with hissing jets of light and naphtha fires , and great glittering lamps swayed very slowly in a violent blast of air . A horrible music , and the exultation of discordant voices , swelled in his ears , and he saw an uncertain tossing crowd of dusky figures that circled and leapt before him . There was a noise like the chant of the lost , and then there appeared in the midst of the orgy , beneath a red flame , the figure of a woman . Her bronze hair and flushed cheeks were illuminate , and an argent light shone from her eyes , and with a smile that froze his heart her lips opened to speak to him . The tossing crowd faded away , falling into a gulf of darkness , and then she drew out from her hair pins of curious gold , and glowing brooches in enamel , and poured out jewels before him from a silver box , and then she stripped from her body her precious robes , and stood in the glowing mist of her hair , and held out her arms to him . But he raised his eyes and saw the mould and decay gaining on the walls of a dismal room , and a gloomy paper was dropping to the rotting floor . A vapor of the grave entered his nostrils , and he cried out with a loud scream ; but there was only an indistinct guttural murmur in his throat . And presently the woman fled away from him , and he pursued her . She fled away before him through midnight country , and he followed after her , chasing her from thicket to thicket , from valley to valley . And at last he captured her and won her with horrible caresses , and they went up to celebrate and make the marriage of the Sabbath . They were within the matted thicket , and they writhed in the flames , insatiable , for ever . They were tortured , and tortured one another , in the sight of thousands who gathered thick about them ; and their desire rose up like a black smoke . Without , the storm swelled to the roaring of an awful sea , the wind grew to a shrill long scream , the elm - tree was riven and split with the crash of a thunderclap . To Lucian the tumult and the shock came as a gentle murmur , as if a brake stirred before a sudden breeze in summer . And then a vast silence overwhelmed him . A few minutes later there was a shuffling of feet in the passage , and the door was softly opened . A woman came in , holding a light , and she peered curiously at the figure sitting quite still in the chair before the desk . The woman was half dressed , and she had let her splendid bronze hair flow down , her cheeks were flushed , and as she advanced into the shabby room , the lamp she carried cast quaking shadows on the moldering paper , patched with marks of rising damp , and hanging in strips from the wet , dripping wall . The blind had not been drawn , but no light or glimmer of light filtered through the window , for a great straggling box tree that beat the rain upon the panes shut out even the night . The woman came softly , and as she bent down over Lucian an argent gleam shone from her brown eyes , and the little curls upon her neck were like golden work upon marble . She put her hand to his heart , and looked up , and beckoned to some one who was waiting by the door . "
