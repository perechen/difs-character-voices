6150	6165	6119	6123	Many of the best people	1065	" said Mrs. Mackridge , with an air of crushing repartee , and drank . "

6271	6297	6298	6298	George	480	" This ended the first skirmish . A certain gloom of manner and a pause was considered due to the sacred memory of Sir Roderick . "
6300	6305	6298	6298	George	480	" said my mother , "
6312	6328	6298	6298	George	480	" Then , perhaps , Mrs. Booch would produce a favourite piece from her repertoire . "
6336	6348	6298	6298	George	480	" she would say , or if the season was decadent , "
6355	6518	6519	6519	They	1070	" It was an invaluable remark to her ; I do not know how she would have got along without it . My mother , who sat with her back to the window , would always consider it due to Mrs. Booch to turn about and regard the evening in the act of elongation or contraction , whichever phase it might be . A brisk discussion of how long we were to the longest or shortest day would ensue , and die away at last exhausted . Mrs. Mackridge , perhaps , would reopen . She had many intelligent habits ; among others she read the paper — The Morning Post . The other ladies would at times tackle that sheet , but only to read the births , marriages , and deaths on the front page . It was , of course , the old Morning Post that cost threepence , not the brisk coruscating young thing of to - day . "

6832	6836	6806	6807	Sir Roderick	375	Thing"—here she fixed me again—"and
6839	6842	6844	6846	a colonial governor	1082	Thing"—now I was released—"needed
6850	6863	6844	6846	a colonial governor	1082	" She became aware of my doubts again , and added predominantly , "
6877	6912	6844	6846	a colonial governor	1082	" I resolved that if ever I found this polypus of Tact growing up in my soul , I would tear it out by the roots , throw it forth and stamp on it . "
6920	6924	6844	6846	a colonial governor	1082	" said Rabbits , "
7002	7545	6993	6993	themselves	1086	" My mother said nothing in that discussion . The word colonies always upset her . She was afraid , I think , that if she turned her mind in that direction my errant father might suddenly and shockingly be discovered , no doubt conspicuously bigamic and altogether offensive and revolutionary . She did not want to rediscover my father at all . It is curious that when I was a little listening boy I had such an idea of our colonies that I jeered in my heart at Mrs. Mackridge 's colonial ascendancy . These brave emancipated sunburnt English of the open , I thought , suffer these aristocratic invaders as a quaint anachronism , but as for being gratified — ! I do n't jeer now . I 'm not so sure . It is a little difficult to explain why I did not come to do what was the natural thing for any one in my circumstances to do , and take my world for granted . A certain innate scepticism , I think , explains it and a certain inaptitude for sympathetic assimilation . My father , I believe , was a sceptic ; my mother was certainly a hard woman . I was an only child , and to this day I do not know whether my father is living or dead . He fled my mother 's virtues before my distincter memories began . He left no traces in his flight , and she , in her indignation , destroyed every vestige that she could of him . Never a photograph nor a scrap of his handwriting have I seen ; and it was , I know , only the accepted code of virtue and discretion that prevented her destroying her marriage certificate and me , and so making a clean sweep of her matrimonial humiliation . I suppose I must inherit something of the moral stupidity that would enable her to make a holocaust of every little personal thing she had of him . There must have been presents made by him as a lover , for example — books with kindly inscriptions , letters perhaps , a flattened flower , a ring , or such - like gage . She kept her wedding - ring , of course , but all the others she destroyed . She never told me his christian name or indeed spoke a word to me of him ; though at times I came near daring to ask her : add what I have of him — it is n't much — I got from his brother , my hero , my uncle Ponderevo . She wore her ring ; her marriage certificate she kept in a sealed envelope in the very bottom of her largest trunk , and me she sustained at a private school among the Kentish hills . You must not think I was always at Bladesover — even in my holidays . If at the time these came round , Lady Drew was vexed by recent Company , or for any other reason wished to take it out of my mother , then she used to ignore the customary reminder my mother gave her , and I "
7548	8019	6993	6993	themselves	1086	" at the school . But such occasions were rare , and I suppose that between ten and fourteen I averaged fifty days a year at Bladesover . Do n't imagine I deny that was a fine thing for me . Bladesover , in absorbing the whole countryside , had not altogether missed greatness . The Bladesover system has at least done one good thing for England , it has abolished the peasant habit of mind . If many of us still live and breathe pantry and housekeeper 's room , we are quit of the dream of living by economising parasitically on hens and pigs .... About that park there were some elements of a liberal education ; there was a great space of greensward not given over to manure and food grubbing ; there was mystery , there was matter for the imagination . It was still a park of deer . I saw something of the life of these dappled creatures , heard the belling of stags , came upon young fawns among the bracken , found bones , skulls , and antlers in lonely places . There were corners that gave a gleam of meaning to the word forest , glimpses of unstudied natural splendour . There was a slope of bluebells in the broken sunlight under the newly green beeches in the west wood that is now precious sapphire in my memory ; it was the first time that I knowingly met Beauty . And in the house there were books . The rubbish old Lady Drew read I never saw ; stuff of the Maria Monk type , I have since gathered , had a fascination for her ; but back in the past there had been a Drew of intellectual enterprise , Sir Cuthbert , the son of Sir Matthew who built the house ; and thrust away , neglected and despised , in an old room upstairs , were books and treasures of his that my mother let me rout among during a spell of wintry wet . Sitting under a dormer window on a shelf above great stores of tea and spices , I became familiar with much of Hogarth in a big portfolio , with Raphael , there was a great book of engravings from the stanzas of Raphael in the Vatican — and with most of the capitals of Europe as they had looked about 1780 , by means of several pig iron - moulded books of views . There was also a broad eighteenth century atlas with huge wandering maps that instructed me mightily . It had splendid adornments about each map title ; Holland showed a fisherman and his boat ; Russia a Cossack ; Japan , remarkable people attired in pagodas — I say it deliberately , "
8022	8110	6993	6993	themselves	1086	" There were Terrae Incognitae in every continent then , Poland , Sarmatia , lands since lost ; and many a voyage I made with a blunted pin about that large , incorrect and dignified world . The books in that little old closet had been banished , I suppose , from the saloon during the Victorian revival of good taste and emasculated orthodoxy , but my mother had no suspicion of their character . So I read and understood the good sound rhetoric of Tom Paine 's "
8115	8118	8113	8113	Man	1088	" and his "
8122	8205	8113	8113	Man	1088	" excellent books , once praised by bishops and since sedulously lied about . Gulliver was there unexpurgated , strong meat for a boy perhaps but not too strong I hold — I have never regretted that I escaped niceness in these affairs . The satire of Traldragdubh made my blood boil as it was meant to do , but I hated Swift for the Houyhnhnms and never quite liked a horse afterwards . Then I remember also a translation of Voltaire 's "
8208	8210	8113	8113	Man	1088	" and "
8213	8314	8113	8113	Man	1088	" and , vast book though it was , I really believe I read , in a muzzy sort of way of course , from end to end , and even with some reference now and then to the Atlas , Gibbon — in twelve volumes . These readings whetted my taste for more , and surreptitiously I raided the bookcases in the big saloon . I got through quite a number of books before my sacrilegious temerity was discovered by Ann , the old head - housemaid . I remember that among others I tried a translation of Plato 's "
8316	8336	6993	6993	themselves	1086	" then , and found extraordinarily little interest in it ; I was much too young for that ; but "

You watch your chance , wait for a tropical war breaking out , let 's say , and collar all the quinine . Where ARE they ? Must have quinine , you know . Eh ? Zzzz . "

26600	26908	26909	26909	You	1732	" The idea of cornering a drug struck upon my mind then as a sort of irresponsible monkey trick that no one would ever be permitted to do in reality . It was the sort of nonsense one would talk to make Ewart laugh and set him going on to still odder possibilities . I thought it was part of my uncle 's way of talking . But I 've learnt differently since . The whole trend of modern money - making is to foresee something that will presently be needed and put it out of reach , and then to haggle yourself wealthy . You buy up land upon which people will presently want to build houses , you secure rights that will bar vitally important developments , and so on , and so on . Of course the naive intelligence of a boy does not grasp the subtler developments of human inadequacy . He begins life with a disposition to believe in the wisdom of grown - up people , he does not realise how casual and disingenuous has been the development of law and custom , and he thinks that somewhere in the state there is a power as irresistible as a head master 's to check mischievous and foolish enterprises of every sort . I will confess that when my uncle talked of cornering quinine , I had a clear impression that any one who contrived to do that would pretty certainly go to jail . Now I know that any one who could really bring it off would be much more likely to go to the House of Lords ! My uncle ranged over the gilt labels of his bottles and drawers for a while , dreaming of corners in this and that . But at last he reverted to Wimblehurst again . "
26925	26930	26931	26931	he	1733	" Jee - rusalem ! "
26934	27142	26931	26931	he	1733	" Why did I plant myself here ? Everything 's done . The game 's over . Here 's Lord Eastry , and he 's got everything , except what his lawyers get , and before you get any more change this way you 'll have to dynamite him - and them . HE does n't want anything more to happen . Why should he ? Any chance ' ud be a loss to him . He wants everything to burble along and burble along and go on as it 's going for the next ten thousand years , Eastry after Eastry , one parson down another come , one grocer dead , get another ! Any one with any ideas better go away . They HAVE gone away ! Look at all these blessed people in this place ! Look at 'em ! All fast asleep , doing their business out of habit - in a sort of dream , Stuffed men would do just as well - just . They 've all shook down into their places . THEY do n't want anything to happen either . They 're all broken in . There you are ! Only what are they all alive for ? ... "
27152	27162	27148	27150	a clockwork chemist	1735	" He concluded as he often concluded these talks . "
27233	27926	27218	27218	YOU	1737	" So I remember my uncle in that first phase , young , but already a little fat , restless , fretful , garrulous , putting in my fermenting head all sorts of discrepant ideas . Certainly he was educational .... For me the years at Wimblehurst were years of pretty active growth . Most of my leisure and much of my time in the shop I spent in study . I speedily mastered the modicum of Latin necessary for my qualifying examinations , and - a little assisted by the Government Science and Art Department classes that were held in the Grammar School - went on with my mathematics . There were classes in physics , in chemistry , in mathematics and machine drawing , and I took up these subjects with considerable avidity . Exercise I got chiefly in the form of walks . There was some cricket in the summer and football in the winter sustained by young men 's clubs that levied a parasitic blackmail of the big people and the sitting member , but I was never very keen at these games . I did n't find any very close companions among the youths of Wimblehurst . They struck me , after my cockney schoolmates , as loutish and slow , servile and furtive , spiteful and mean . WE used to swagger , but these countrymen dragged their feet and hated an equal who did n't ; we talked loud , but you only got the real thoughts of Wimblehurst in a knowing undertone behind its hand . And even then they were n't much in the way of thoughts . No , I did n't like those young countrymen , and I 'm no believer in the English countryside under the Bladesover system as a breeding ground for honourable men . One hears a frightful lot of nonsense about the Rural Exodus and the degeneration wrought by town life upon our population . To my mind , the English townsman , even in the slums , is infinitely better spiritually , more courageous , more imaginative and cleaner , than his agricultural cousin . I 've seen them both when they did n't think they were being observed , and I know . There was something about my Wimblehurst companions that disgusted me . It 's hard to define . Heaven knows that at that cockney boarding - school at Goudhurst we were coarse enough ; the Wimblehurst youngsters had neither words nor courage for the sort of thing we used to do - for our bad language , for example ; but , on the other hand , they displayed a sort of sluggish , real lewdness , lewdness is the word - a baseness of attitude . Whatever we exiled urbans did at Goudhurst was touched with something , however coarse , of romantic imagination . We had read the Boys of England , and told each other stories . In the English countryside there are no books at all , no songs , no drama , no valiant sin even ; all these things have never come or they were taken away and hidden generations ago , and the imagination aborts and bestialises . That , I think , is where the real difference against the English rural man lies . It is because I know this that I do not share in the common repinings because our countryside is being depopulated , because our population is passing through the furnace of the towns . They starve , they suffer , no doubt , but they come out of it hardened , they come out of it with souls . Of an evening the Wimblehurst blade , shiny - faced from a wash and with some loud finery , a coloured waistcoat or a vivid tie , would betake himself to the Eastry Arms billiard - room , or to the bar parlour of some minor pub where nap could be played . One soon sickened of his slow knowingness , the cunning observation of his deadened eyes , his idea of a "
27930	28047	27218	27218	YOU	1737	" always , always told in undertones , poor dirty worm ! his shrewd , elaborate maneuvers for some petty advantage , a drink to the good or such - like deal . There rises before my eyes as I write , young Hopley Dodd , the son of the Wimblehurst auctioneer , the pride of Wimblehurst , its finest flower , with his fur waistcoat and his bulldog pipe , his riding breeches - he had no horse - and his gaiters , as he used to sit , leaning forward and watching the billiard - table from under the brim of his artfully tilted hat . A half - dozen phrases constituted his conversation : "
28051	28058	27218	27218	YOU	1737	" he used to say , and "
28062	28151	27218	27218	YOU	1737	" in a bass bleat . Moreover , he had a long slow whistle that was esteemed the very cream of humorous comment . Night after night he was there . Also you knew he would not understand that I could play billiards , and regarded every stroke I made as a fluke . For a beginner I did n't play so badly , I thought . I 'm not so sure now ; that was my opinion at the time . But young Dodd 's scepticism and the "
28154	28268	27218	27218	YOU	1737	" finally cured me of my disposition to frequent the Eastry Arms , and so these noises had their value in my world . I made no friends among the young men of the place at all , and though I was entering upon adolescence I have no love - affair to tell of here . Not that I was not waking up to that aspect of life in my middle teens I did , indeed , in various slightly informal ways scrape acquaintance with casual Wimblehurst girls ; with a little dressmaker 's apprentice I got upon shyly speaking terms , and a pupil teacher in the National School went further and was "
28271	28331	27218	27218	YOU	1737	" in connection with me but I was not by any means touched by any reality of passion for either of these young people ; love - love as yet came to me only in my dreams . I only kissed these girls once or twice . They rather disconcerted than developed those dreams . They were so clearly not "
28334	29003	27218	27218	YOU	1737	" I shall have much to say of love in this story , but I may break it to the reader now that it is my role to be a rather ineffectual lover . Desire I knew well enough - indeed , too well ; but love I have been shy of . In all my early enterprises in the war of the sexes , I was torn between the urgency of the body and a habit of romantic fantasy that wanted every phase of the adventure to be generous and beautiful . And I had a curiously haunting memory of Beatrice , of her kisses in the bracken and her kiss upon the wall , that somehow pitched the standard too high for Wimblehurst 's opportunities . I will not deny I did in a boyish way attempt a shy , rude adventure or so in love - making at Wimblehurst ; but through these various influences , I did n't bring things off to any extent at all . I left behind me no devastating memories , no splendid reputation . I came away at last , still inexperienced and a little thwarted , with only a natural growth of interest and desire in sexual things . If I fell in love with any one in Wimblehurst it was with my aunt . She treated me with a kindliness that was only half maternal - she petted my books , she knew about my certificates , she made fun of me in a way that stirred my heart to her . Quite unconsciously I grew fond of her .... My adolescent years at Wimblehurst were on the whole laborious , uneventful years that began in short jackets and left me in many ways nearly a man , years so uneventful that the Calculus of Variations is associated with one winter , and an examination in Physics for Science and Art department Honours marks an epoch . Many divergent impulses stirred within me , but the master impulse was a grave young disposition to work and learn and thereby in some not very clearly defined way get out of the Wimblehurst world into which I had fallen . I wrote with some frequency to Ewart , self - conscious , but , as I remember them , not intelligent letters , dated in Latin and with lapses into Latin quotation that roused Ewart to parody . There was something about me in those days more than a little priggish . But it was , to do myself justice , something more than the petty pride of learning . I had a very grave sense of discipline and preparation that I am not ashamed at all to remember . I was serious . More serious than I am at the present time . More serious , indeed , than any adult seems to be . I was capable then of efforts - of nobilities .... They are beyond me now . I do n't see why , at forty , I should n't confess I respect my own youth . I had dropped being a boy quite abruptly . I thought I was presently to go out into a larger and quite important world and do significant things there . I thought I was destined to do something definite to a world that had a definite purpose . I did not understand then , as I do now , that life was to consist largely in the world 's doing things to me . Young people never do seem to understand that aspect of things . And , as I say , among my educational influences my uncle , all unsuspected , played a leading part , and perhaps among other things gave my discontent with Wimblehurst , my desire to get away from that clean and picturesque emptiness , a form and expression that helped to emphasise it . In a way that definition made me patient . "
29011	29343	29005	29005	I	0	" I said , echoing him . I remember him now as talking , always talking , in those days . He talked to me of theology , he talked of politics , of the wonders of science and the marvels of art , of the passions and the affections , of the immortality of the soul and the peculiar actions of drugs ; but predominantly and constantly he talked of getting on , of enterprises , of inventions and great fortunes , of Rothschilds , silver kings , Vanderbilts , Goulds , flotations , realisations and the marvelous ways of Chance with men - in all localities , that is to say , that are not absolutely sunken to the level of Cold Mutton Fat . When I think of those early talks , I figure him always in one of three positions . Either we were in the dispensing lair behind a high barrier , he pounding up things in a mortar perhaps , and I rolling pill - stuff into long rolls and cutting it up with a sort of broad , fluted knife , or he stood looking out of the shop door against the case of sponges and spray - diffusers , while I surveyed him from behind the counter , or he leant against the little drawers behind the counter , and I hovered dusting in front . The thought of those early days brings back to my nostrils the faint smell of scent that was always in the air , marbled now with streaks of this drug and now of that , and to my eyes the rows of jejune glass bottles with gold labels , mirror - reflected , that stood behind him . My aunt , I remember , used sometimes to come into the shop in a state of aggressive sprightliness , a sort of connubial ragging expedition , and get much fun over the abbreviated Latinity of those gilt inscriptions .

I shall pay twenty shillings in the pound before I 've done - you mark my words , George,-twenty - five to you .... I got this situation within twenty - four hours - others offered . It 's an important firm - one of the best in London . I looked to that . I might have got four or five shillings a week more - elsewhere . Quarters I could name .

If I 'd have only kept back a little , I 'd have had it on U.P. next day , like a shot , and come out on the rise . There you are ! "

I was thinking of it this morning while I shaved . It 's not irreverent for me to say it , I hope - but God comes in on the off - chance , George . See ? Do n't you be too cocksure of anything , good or bad . That 's what I make out of it . I could have sworn . Well , do you think I - particular as I am - would have touched those Union Pacifics with trust money at all , if I had n't thought it a thoroughly good thing - good without spot or blemish ? ... And it was bad ! "

32705	32812	32701	32701	You	480	" And in the end I had to . I think the bankruptcy hit my aunt pretty hard . There was , so far as I can remember now , a complete cessation of all those cheerful outbreaks of elasticity , no more skylarking in the shop nor scampering about the house . But there was no fuss that I saw , and only little signs in her complexion of the fits of weeping that must have taken her . She did n't cry at the end , though to me her face with its strain of self - possession was more pathetic than any weeping . "
32814	32829	32701	32701	You	480	" she said to me as she came through the shop to the cab , "
32847	32915	32701	32701	You	480	" And she took me in her arms and kissed me and pressed me to her . Then she dived straight for the cab before I could answer her . My uncle followed , and he seemed to me a trifle too valiant and confident in his bearing for reality . He was unusually white in the face . He spoke to his successor at the counter . "

33054	33128	33037	33037	I	0	" It became clear to me as if for the first time , that I was really parting from my aunt Susan . I went out on to the pavement and saw her head craned forward , her wide - open blue eyes and her little face intent on the shop that had combined for her all the charms of a big doll 's house and a little home of her very own . "
33133	33171	33037	33037	I	0	" she said to it and to me . Our eyes met for a moment - perplexed . My uncle bustled out and gave a few totally unnecessary directions to the cabman and got in beside her . "

33183	33208	33037	33037	I	0	" said I ; and he woke up the horse with a flick of his whip . My aunt 's eyes surveyed me again . "
33231	33267	33225	33225	they	1829	" she said cheerfully . She stared at me for a second longer with eyes growing wider and brighter and a smile that had become fixed , glanced again at the bright little shop still saying "
33269	33521	33225	33225	they	1829	" with all the emphasis of its fascia , and then flopped back hastily out of sight of me into the recesses of the cab . Then it had gone from before me and I beheld Mr. Snape , the hairdresser , inside his store regarding its departure with a quiet satisfaction and exchanging smiles and significant headshakes with Mr. Marbel . I was left , I say , as part of the lock , stock , and barrel , at Wimblehurst with my new master , a Mr. Mantell ; who plays no part in the progress of this story except in so far as he effaced my uncle 's traces . So soon as the freshness of this new personality faded , I began to find Wimblehurst not only a dull but a lonely place , and to miss my aunt Susan immensely . The advertisements of the summer terms for Cough Linctus were removed ; the bottles of coloured water - red , green , and yellow - restored to their places ; the horse announcing veterinary medicine , which my uncle , sizzling all the while , had coloured in careful portraiture of a Goodwood favourite , rewhitened ; and I turned myself even more resolutely than before to Latin ( until the passing of my preliminary examination enabled me to drop that ) , and then to mathematics and science . There were classes in Electricity and Magnetism at the Grammar School . I took a little "
33523	34526	34527	34527	Lord	1831	" prize in that in my first year and a medal in my third ; and in Chemistry and Human Physiology and Sound , Light and Heat , I did well . There was also a lighter , more discursive subject called Physiography , in which one ranged among the sciences and encountered Geology as a process of evolution from Eozoon to Eastry House , and Astronomy as a record of celestial movements of the most austere and invariable integrity . I learnt out of badly - written , condensed little text - books , and with the minimum of experiment , but still I learnt . Only thirty years ago it was , and I remember I learnt of the electric light as an expensive , impracticable toy , the telephone as a curiosity , electric traction as a practical absurdity . There was no argon , no radium , no phagocytes - at least to my knowledge , and aluminium was a dear , infrequent metal . The fastest ships in the world went then at nineteen knots , and no one but a lunatic here and there ever thought it possible that men might fly . Many things have happened since then , but the last glance I had of Wimblehurst two years ago remarked no change whatever in its pleasant tranquillity . They had not even built any fresh houses - at least not actually in the town , though about the station there had been some building . But it was a good place to do work in , for all its quiescence . I was soon beyond the small requirements of the Pharmaceutical Society 's examination , and as they do not permit candidates to sit for that until one and twenty , I was presently filling up my time and preventing my studies becoming too desultory by making an attack upon the London University degree of Bachelor of Science , which impressed me then as a very splendid but almost impossible achievement . The degree in mathematics and chemistry appealed to me as particularly congenial - albeit giddily inaccessible . I set to work . I had presently to arrange a holiday and go to London to matriculate , and so it was I came upon my aunt and uncle again . In many ways that visit marked an epoch . It was my first impression of London at all . I was then nineteen , and by a conspiracy of chances my nearest approach to that human wilderness had been my brief visit to Chatham . Chatham too had been my largest town . So that I got London at last with an exceptional freshness of effect , as the sudden revelation of a whole unsuspected other side to life . I came to it on a dull and smoky day by the South Eastern Railway , and our train was half an hour late , stopping and going on and stopping again . I marked beyond Chiselhurst the growing multitude of villas , and so came stage by stage through multiplying houses and diminishing interspaces of market garden and dingy grass to regions of interlacing railway lines , big factories , gasometers and wide reeking swamps of dingy little homes , more of them and more and more . The number of these and their dinginess and poverty increased , and here rose a great public house and here a Board School and there a gaunt factory ; and away to the east there loomed for a time a queer , incongruous forest of masts and spars . The congestion of houses intensified and piled up presently into tenements ; I marveled more and more at this boundless world of dingy people ; whiffs of industrial smell , of leather , of brewing , drifted into the carriage ; the sky darkened , I rumbled thunderously over bridges , van - crowded streets , peered down on and crossed the Thames with an abrupt eclat of sound . I got an effect of tall warehouses , of grey water , barge crowded , of broad banks of indescribable mud , and then I was in Cannon Street Station - a monstrous dirty cavern with trains packed across its vast floor and more porters standing along the platform than I had ever been in my life before . I alighted with my portmanteau and struggled along , realising for the first time just how small and weak I could still upon occasion feel . In this world , I felt , an Honours medal in Electricity and magnetism counted for nothing at all . Afterwards I drove in a cab down a canon of rushing street between high warehouses , and peeped up astonished at the blackened greys of Saint Paul 's . The traffic of Cheapside - it was mostly in horse omnibuses in those days - seemed stupendous , its roar was stupendous ; I wondered where the money came from to employ so many cabs , what industry could support the endless jostling stream of silk - hatted , frock - coated , hurrying men . Down a turning I found the Temperance Hotel Mr. Mantell had recommended to me . The porter in a green uniform who took over my portmanteau , seemed , I thought , to despise me a good deal . Matriculation kept me for four full days and then came an afternoon to spare , and I sought out Tottenham Court Road through a perplexing network of various and crowded streets . But this London was vast ! it was endless ! it seemed the whole world had changed into packed frontages and hoardings and street spaces . I got there at last and made inquiries , and I found my uncle behind the counter of the pharmacy he managed , an establishment that did not impress me as doing a particularly high - class trade . "
34529	34538	34527	34527	Lord	1831	" he said at the sight of me , "
34546	34627	34539	34539	I	0	" He greeted me warmly . I had grown taller , and he , I thought , had grown shorter and smaller and rounder but otherwise he was unchanged . He struck me as being rather shabby , and the silk hat he produced and put on , when , after mysterious negotiations in the back premises he achieved his freedom to accompany me , was past its first youth ; but he was as buoyant and confident as ever . "
34636	34640	34539	34539	I	0	" he cried . "
34647	34648	34641	34641	I	0	" "
34655	34679	34641	34641	I	0	" said I , with a sudden regrettable politeness , and waived the topic of his trusteeship to ask after my aunt Susan . "
34688	34693	34680	34680	We	1832	" he said suddenly ; "
34709	34710	34699	34699	We	1832	" "
34717	34721	34713	34713	my	0	" I said , "
34728	34865	34722	34722	I	0	" ; and that made him ask me what I thought of it , and the rest of the talk was London , London , to the exclusion of all smaller topics . He took me up the Hampstead Road almost to the Cobden statue , plunged into some back streets to the left , and came at last to a blistered front door that responded to his latch - key , one of a long series of blistered front doors with fanlights and apartment cards above . We found ourselves in a drab - coloured passage that was not only narrow and dirty but desolatingly empty , and then he opened a door and revealed my aunt sitting at the window with a little sewing - machine on a bamboo occasional table before her , and "
34866	34923	34699	34699	We	1832	work"-a plum - coloured walking dress I judged at its most analytical stage - scattered over the rest of the apartment . At the first glance I judged my aunt was plumper than she had been , but her complexion was just as fresh and her China blue eye as bright as in the old days . "
34926	34932	34722	34722	I	0	" she said , did n't "
34935	34941	34722	34722	I	0	" on her . She still "
34943	34953	34722	34722	I	0	" my uncle , I was pleased to find . "
34967	35064	34965	34965	Gubbitt	470	" she said when he appeared , and she still looked with a practised eye for the facetious side of things . When she saw me behind him , she gave a little cry and stood up radiant . Then she became grave . I was surprised at my own emotion in seeing her . She held me at arm 's length for a moment , a hand on each shoulder , and looked at me with a sort of glad scrutiny . She seemed to hesitate , and then pecked little kiss off my cheek . "
35072	35943	35067	35068	a man	718	" she said , as she released me , and continued to look at me for a while . Their menage was one of a very common type in London . They occupied what is called the dining - room floor of a small house , and they had the use of a little inconvenient kitchen in the basement that had once been scullery . The two rooms , bedroom behind and living room in front , were separated by folding - doors that were never now thrown back , and indeed , in the presence of a visitor , not used at all . There was of course no bathroom or anything of that sort available , and there was no water supply except to the kitchen below . My aunt did all the domestic work , though she could have afforded to pay for help if the build of the place had not rendered that inconvenient to the pitch of impossibility . There was no sort of help available except that of indoor servants , for whom she had no accommodation . The furniture was their own ; it was partly secondhand , but on the whole it seemed cheerful to my eye , and my aunt 's bias for cheap , gay - figured muslin had found ample score . In many ways I should think it must have been an extremely inconvenient and cramped sort of home , but at the time I took it , as I was taking everything , as being there and in the nature of things . I did not see the oddness of solvent decent people living in a habitation so clearly neither designed nor adapted for their needs , so wasteful of labour and so devoid of beauty as this was , and it is only now as I describe this that I find myself thinking of the essential absurdity of an intelligent community living in such makeshift homes . It strikes me now as the next thing to wearing second - hand clothes . You see it was a natural growth , part of that system to which Bladesover , I hold , is the key . There are wide regions of London , miles of streets of houses , that appear to have been originally designed for prosperous - middle - class homes of the early Victorian type . There must have been a perfect fury of such building in the thirties , forties , and fifties . Street after street must have been rushed into being , Campden Town way , Pentonville way , Brompton way , West Kensington way in the Victoria region and all over the minor suburbs of the south side . I am doubtful if many of these houses had any long use as the residences of single families if from the very first almost their tenants did not makeshift and take lodgers and sublet . They were built with basements , in which their servants worked and lived - servants of a more submissive and troglodytic generation who did not mind stairs . The dining - room ( with folding doors ) was a little above the ground level , and in that the wholesome boiled and roast with damp boiled potatoes and then pie to follow , was consumed and the numerous family read and worked in the evening , and above was the drawing - room ( also with folding doors ) , where the infrequent callers were received . That was the vision at which those industrious builders aimed . Even while these houses were being run up , the threads upon the loom of fate were shaping to abolish altogether the type of household that would have fitted them . Means of transit were developing to carry the moderately prosperous middle - class families out of London , education and factory employment were whittling away at the supply of rough , hardworking , obedient girls who would stand the subterranean drudgery of these places , new classes of hard - up middle - class people such as my uncle , employees of various types , were coming into existence , for whom no homes were provided . None of these classes have ideas of what they ought to be , or fit in any legitimate way into the Bladesover theory that dominates our minds . It was nobody 's concern to see them housed under civilised conditions , and the beautiful laws of supply and demand had free play . They had to squeeze in . The landlords came out financially intact from their blundering enterprise . More and more these houses fell into the hands of married artisans , or struggling widows or old servants with savings , who became responsible for the quarterly rent and tried to sweat a living by sub - letting furnished or unfurnished apartments . I remember now that a poor grey - haired old woman who had an air of having been roused from a nap in the dust bin , came out into the area and looked up at us as we three went out from the front door to "
35946	36007	34965	34965	Gubbitt	470	" under my uncle 's direction . She was the sub - letting occupier ; she squeezed out a precarious living by taking the house whole and sub - letting it in detail and she made her food and got the shelter of an attic above and a basement below by the transaction . And if she did n't chance to "
36009	36190	34965	34965	Gubbitt	470	" steadily , out she went to pauperdom and some other poor , sordid old adventurer tried in her place .... It is a foolish community that can house whole classes , useful and helpful , honest and loyal classes , in such squalidly unsuitable dwellings . It is by no means the social economy it seems , to use up old women , savings and inexperience in order to meet the landlord 's demands . But any one who doubts this thing is going on right up to to - day need only spend an afternoon in hunting for lodgings in any of the regions of London I have named . But where has my story got to ? My uncle , I say , decided I must be shown London , and out we three went as soon as my aunt had got her hat on , to catch all that was left of the day . It pleased my uncle extremely to find I had never seen London before . He took possession of the metropolis forthwith . "
36195	36199	36193	36193	George	480	" he said , "
36309	36449	36455	36455	George	480	" I have a very confused memory of that afternoon 's inspection of London . My uncle took us to and fro showing us over his London , talking erratically , following a route of his own . Sometimes we were walking , sometimes we were on the tops of great staggering horse omnibuses in a heaving jumble of traffic , and at one point we had tea in an Aerated Bread Shop . But I remember very distinctly how we passed down Park Lane under an overcast sky , and how my uncle pointed out the house of this child of good fortune and that with succulent appreciation . I remember , too , that as he talked I would find my aunt watching my face as if to check the soundness of his talk by my expression . "
36457	36471	36455	36455	George	480	" she asked suddenly , over a bun in the tea - shop . "
36477	36502	36475	36475	aunt	1766	" I told her . She bit her bun extensively , and gesticulated with the remnant to indicate that she had more to say . "
36512	36523	36524	36524	You	480	" she said so soon as she could speak again . "
36531	36532	36524	36524	You	480	" "
36536	36550	36524	36524	You	480	" said my uncle , taking breath after a deep draught of tea . "
36558	36562	36552	36552	I	0	" I said . "
36578	36579	36566	36566	I	0	" "
36589	36593	36580	36580	We	1851	" she said . "
36599	36608	36609	36609	He	1852	" She jerked her head at my uncle . "
36647	36659	36660	36660	I	0	" She finished her bun and twiddled crumbs from her fingers . "
36668	36672	36660	36660	I	0	" she said . "
36696	36697	36698	36698	You	0	" "
36705	36716	36698	36698	You	0	" said my uncle , who had reddened a little . "
36725	36729	36723	36723	George	480	" she said . "
36763	36764	36765	36765	You	0	" "
36769	36780	36765	36765	You	0	" said my uncle , and hummed for a moment . "
36794	36811	36812	36812	He	1862	" she said , turning her eyes upon his profile with a sudden lapse to affection . "
36818	36819	36812	36812	He	1862	" "
36825	36830	36831	36831	you	0	" said my uncle , "
36836	36847	36849	36849	you	480	" and rapped with a shilling on the marble table . "
36863	36867	36851	36851	you	480	" she said , "
36883	36950	36881	36881	you	480	" And she held the split under his nose , and pulled a face of comical fierceness . My uncle smiled at these sallies at the time , but afterwards , when I went back with him to the Pharmacy - the low - class business grew brisker in the evening and they kept open late - he reverted to it in a low expository tone . "
37062	37063	37057	37057	I	0	" "
37067	37071	37073	37073	you	0	" I said , "

37135	37147	37148	37148	I	0	" He got up and closed the door into the shop . "
37154	37164	37148	37148	I	0	" he remarked , as he sat down again . "
37170	37186	37167	37167	you	480	" His face flushed slightly , he leant forward over the little table towards me . "
37189	37196	37197	37199	Tono - Bungay	352	" he said . I listened . "
37201	37224	37197	37199	Tono - Bungay	352	" said my uncle very slowly and distinctly . I thought he was asking me to hear some remote , strange noise . "
37231	37244	37225	37225	I	0	" I said reluctantly to his expectant face . He smiled undefeated . "
37248	37255	37256	37258	Tono - Bungay	352	" he said , and repeated , "
37260	37261	37256	37258	Tono - Bungay	352	" "
37266	37270	37256	37258	Tono - Bungay	352	" I said . "
37273	37277	37271	37271	Eh	1868	" said he . "
37283	37284	37225	37225	I	0	" "
37287	37296	37225	37225	I	0	" said my uncle , rejoicing and expanding . "
37315	37329	37330	37330	George	480	" He dug me violently in what he supposed to be my ribs . "
37332	37334	37330	37330	George	480	" he cried-"George
37346	37444	37330	37330	George	480	" And that was all I could get from him . That , I believe , was the very first time that the words Tono - Bungay ever heard on earth - unless my uncle indulged in monologues in his chamber - a highly probable thing . Its utterance certainly did not seem to me at the time to mark any sort of epoch , and had I been told this word was the Open Sesame to whatever pride and pleasure the grimy front of London hid from us that evening , I should have laughed aloud . "
37450	37485	37486	37486	I	0	" I said after a pause , and with a chill sense of effort ; and I opened the question of his trust . My uncle sighed , and leant back in his chair . "
37504	37508	37488	37488	I	0	" he said . "
37521	37723	37724	37724	I	0	" After I left my uncle that evening I gave way to a feeling of profound depression . My uncle and aunt seemed to me to be leading - I have already used the word too often , but I must use it again - DINGY lives . They seemed to be adrift in a limitless crowd of dingy people , wearing shabby clothes , living uncomfortably in shabby second - hand houses , going to and fro on pavements that had always a thin veneer of greasy , slippery mud , under grey skies that showed no gleam of hope of anything for them but dinginess until they died . It seemed absolutely clear to me that my mother 's little savings had been swallowed up and that my own prospect was all too certainly to drop into and be swallowed up myself sooner or later by this dingy London ocean . The London that was to be an adventurous escape from the slumber of Wimblehurst , had vanished from my dreams . I saw my uncle pointing to the houses in Park Lane and showing a frayed shirt - cuff as he did so . I heard my aunt : "
37738	38956	37734	37734	he	1872	" My feelings towards my uncle were extraordinarily mixed . I was intensely sorry not only for my aunt Susan but for him - for it seemed indisputable that as they were living then so they must go on - and at the same time I was angry with the garrulous vanity and illness that had elipped all my chance of independent study , and imprisoned her in those grey apartments . When I got back to Wimblehurst I allowed myself to write him a boyishly sarcastic and sincerely bitter letter . He never replied . Then , believing it to be the only way of escape for me , I set myself far more grimly and resolutely to my studies than I had ever done before . After a time I wrote to him in more moderate terms , and he answered me evasively . And then I tried to dismiss him from my mind and went on working . Yes , that first raid upon London under the moist and chilly depression of January had an immense effect upon me . It was for me an epoch - making disappointment . I had thought of London as a large , free , welcoming , adventurous place , and I saw it slovenly and harsh and irresponsive . I did not realise at all what human things might be found behind those grey frontages , what weakness that whole forbidding facade might presently confess . It is the constant error of youth to over - estimate the Will in things . I did not see that the dirt , the discouragement , the discomfort of London could be due simply to the fact that London was a witless old giantess of a town , too slack and stupid to keep herself clean and maintain a brave face to the word . No ! I suffered from the sort of illusion that burnt witches in the seventeenth century . I endued her grubby disorder with a sinister and magnificent quality of intention . And my uncle 's gestures and promises filled me with doubt and a sort of fear for him . He seemed to me a lost little creature , too silly to be silent , in a vast implacable condemnation . I was full of pity and a sort of tenderness for my aunt Susan , who was doomed to follow his erratic fortunes mocked by his grandiloquent promises . I was to learn better . But I worked with the terror of the grim underside of London in my soul during all my last year at Wimblehurst . I came to live in London , as I shall tell you , when I was nearly twenty - two . Wimblehurst dwindles in perspective , is now in this book a little place far off , Bladesover no more than a small pinkish speck of frontage among the distant Kentish hills ; the scene broadens out , becomes multitudinous and limitless , full of the sense of vast irrelevant movement . I do not remember my second coming to London as I do my first , for my early impressions , save that an October memory of softened amber sunshine stands out , amber sunshine falling on grey house fronts I know not where . That , and a sense of a large tranquillity . I could fill a book , I think , with a more or less imaginary account of how I came to apprehend London , how first in one aspect and then in another it grew in my mind . Each day my accumulating impressions were added to and qualified and brought into relationship with new ones ; they fused inseparably with others that were purely personal and accidental . I find myself with a certain comprehensive perception of London , complete indeed , incurably indistinct in places and yet in some way a whole that began with my first visit and is still being mellowed and enriched . London ! At first , no doubt , it was a chaos of streets and people and buildings and reasonless going to and fro . I do not remember that I ever struggled very steadily to understand it , or explored it with any but a personal and adventurous intention . Yet in time there has grown up in me a kind of theory of London ; I do think I see lines of an ordered structure out of which it has grown , detected a process that is something more than a confusion of casual accidents though indeed it may be no more than a process of disease . I said at the outset of my first book that I find in Bladesover the clue to all England . Well , I certainly imagine it is the clue to the structure of London . There have been no revolutions no deliberate restatements or abandonments of opinion in England since the days of the fine gentry , since 1688 or thereabouts , the days when Bladesover was built ; there have been changes , dissolving forest replacing forest , if you will ; but then it was that the broad lines of the English system set firmly . And as I have gone to and fro in London in certain regions constantly the thought has recurred this is Bladesover House , this answers to Bladesover House . The fine gentry may have gone ; they have indeed largely gone , I think ; rich merchants may have replaced them , financial adventurers or what not . That does not matter ; the shape is still Bladesover . I am most reminded of Bladesover and Eastry by all those regions round about the West End parks ; for example , estate parks , each more or less in relation to a palace or group of great houses . The roads and back ways of Mayfair and all about St. James 's again , albeit perhaps of a later growth in point of time , were of the very spirit and architectural texture of the Bladesover passages and yards ; they had the same smells , the space , the large cleanest and always going to and fro where one met unmistakable Olympians and even more unmistakable valets , butlers , footmen in mufti . There were moments when I seemed to glimpse down areas the white panelling , the very chintz of my mother 's room again . I could trace out now on a map what I would call the Great - House region ; passing south - westward into Belgravia , becoming diffused and sporadic westward , finding its last systematic outbreak round and about Regent 's Park . The Duke of Devonshire 's place in Piccadilly , in all its insolent ugliness , pleases me particularly ; it is the quintessence of the thing ; Apsley House is all in the manner of my theory , Park Lane has its quite typical mansions , and they run along the border of the Green Park and St. James 's . And I struck out a truth one day in Cromwell Road quite suddenly , as I looked over the Natural History Museum "
38960	38963	37734	37734	he	1872	" said I "
39027	39662	39010	39012	old Sir Cuthbert	381	" And diving into the Art Museum under this inspiration , I came to a little reading - room and found as I had inferred , old brown books ! It was really a good piece of social comparative anatomy I did that day ; all these museums and libraries that are dotted over London between Piccadilly and West Kensington , and indeed the museum and library movement throughout the world , sprang from the elegant leisure of the gentlemen of taste . Theirs were the first libraries , the first houses of culture ; by my rat - like raids into the Bladesover saloon I became , as it were , the last dwindled representative of such a man of letters as Swift . But now these things have escaped out of the Great House altogether , and taken on a strange independent life of their own . It is this idea of escaping parts from the seventeenth century system of Bladesover , of proliferating and overgrowing elements from the Estates , that to this day seems to me the best explanation , not simply of London , but of all England . England is a country of great Renascence landed gentlefolk who have been unconsciously outgrown and overgrown . The proper shops for Bladesover custom were still to be found in Regent Street and Bond Street in my early London days in those days they had been but lightly touched by the American 's profaning hand - and in Piccadilly . I found the doctor 's house of the country village or country town up and down Harley Street , multiplied but not otherwise different , and the family solicitor ( by the hundred ) further eastward in the abandoned houses of a previous generation of gentlepeople , and down in Westminster , behind Palladian fronts , the public offices sheltered in large Bladesoverish rooms and looked out on St. James 's Park . The Parliament Houses of lords and gentlemen , the parliament house that was horrified when merchants and brewers came thrusting into it a hundred years ago , stood out upon its terrace gathering the whole system together into a head . And the more I have paralleled these things with my Bladesover - Eastry model , the more evident it has become to me that the balance is not the same , and the more evident is the presence of great new forces , blind forces of invasion , of growth . The railway termini on the north side of London have been kept as remote as Eastry had kept the railway - station from Wimblehurst , they stop on the very outskirts of the estates , but from the south , the South Eastern railway had butted its great stupid rusty iron head of Charing Cross station , that great head that came smashing down in 1905 - clean across the river , between Somerset House and Whitehall . The south side had no protecting estate . Factory chimneys smoke right over against Westminster with an air of carelessly not having permission , and the whole effect of industrial London and of all London east of Temple Bar and of the huge dingy immensity of London port is to me of something disproportionately large , something morbidly expanded , without plan or intention , dark and sinister toward the clean clear social assurance of the West End . And south of this central London , south - east , south - west , far west , north - west , all round the northern hills , are similar disproportionate growths , endless streets of undistinguished houses , undistinguished industries , shabby families , second - rate shops , inexplicable people who in a once fashionable phrase do not "
39665	40736	39010	39012	old Sir Cuthbert	381	" All these aspects have suggested to my mind at times , do suggest to this day , the unorganised , abundant substance of some tumorous growth - process , a process which indeed bursts all the outlines of the affected carcass and protrudes such masses as ignoble comfortable Croydon , as tragic impoverished West Ham . To this day I ask myself will those masses ever become structural , will they indeed shape into anything new whatever , or is that cancerous image their true and ultimate diagnosis ? ... Moreover , together with this hypertrophy there is an immigration of elements that have never understood and never will understand the great tradition , wedges of foreign settlement embedded in the heart of this yeasty English expansion . One day I remember wandering eastward out of pure curiosity - it must have been in my early student days - and discovering a shabbily bright foreign quarter , shops displaying Hebrew placards and weird , unfamiliar commodities and a concourse of bright - eyed , eagle - nosed people talking some incomprehensible gibberish between the shops and the barrows . And soon I became quite familiar with the devious , vicious , dirtily - pleasant eroticism of Soho . I found those crowded streets a vast relief from the dull grey exterior of Brompton where I lodged and lived my daily life . In Soho , indeed , I got my first inkling of the factor of replacement that is so important in both the English and the American process . Even in the West End , in Mayfair and the square , about Pall Mall , Ewart was presently to remind me the face of the old aristocratic dignity was fairer than its substance ; here were actors and actresses , here money lenders and Jews , here bold financial adventurers , and I thought of my uncle 's frayed cuff as he pointed out this house in Park Lane and that . That was so and so 's who made a corner in borax , and that palace belonged to that hero among modern adventurers , Barmentrude , who used to be an I.D.B.,-an illicit diamond buyer that is to say . A city of Bladesovers , the capital of a kingdom of Bladesovers , all much shaken and many altogether in decay , parasitically occupied , insidiously replaced by alien , unsympathetic and irresponsible elements ; and with a ruling an adventitious and miscellaneous empire of a quarter of this daedal earth complex laws , intricate social necessities , disturbing insatiable suggestions , followed from this . Such was the world into which I had come , into which I had in some way to thrust myself and fit my problem , my temptations , my efforts , my patriotic instinct , all my moral instincts , my physical appetites , my dreams and my sanity . London ! I came up to it , young and without advisers , rather priggish , rather dangerously open - minded and very open - eyed , and with something - it is , I think , the common gift of imaginative youth , and I claim it unblushingly - fine in me , finer than the world and seeking fine responses . I did not want simply to live or simply to live happily or well ; I wanted to serve and do and make - with some nobility . It was in me . It is in half the youth of the world . I had come to London as a scholar . I had taken the Vincent Bradley scholarship of the Pharmaceutical Society , but I threw this up when I found that my work of the Science and Art Department in mathematics , physics and chemistry had given me one of the minor Technical Board Scholarships at the Consolidated Technical Schools at South Kensington . This latter was in mechanics and metallurgy ; and I hesitated between the two . The Vincent Bradley gave me L70 a year and quite the best start - off a pharmaceutical chemist could have ; the South Kensington thing was worth about twenty - two shillings a week , and the prospects it opened were vague . But it meant far more scientific work than the former , and I was still under the impulse of that great intellectual appetite that is part of the adolescence of men of my type . Moreover it seemed to lead towards engineering , in which I imagined - I imagine to this day - my particular use is to be found . I took its greater uncertainty as a fair risk . I came up very keen , not doubting that the really hard and steady industry that had carried me through Wimblehurst would go on still in the new surroundings . Only from the very first it did n't .... When I look back now at my Wimblehurst days , I still find myself surprised at the amount of steady grinding study , of strenuous self - discipline that I maintained throughout my apprenticeship . In many ways I think that time was the most honourable period in my life . I wish I could say with a certain mind that my motives in working so well were large and honourable too . To a certain extent they were so ; there was a fine sincere curiosity , a desire for the strength and power of scientific knowledge and a passion for intellectual exercise ; but I do not think those forces alone would have kept me at it so grimly and closely if Wimblehurst had not been so dull , so limited and so observant . Directly I came into the London atmosphere , tasting freedom , tasting irresponsibility and the pull of new forces altogether , my discipline fell from me like a garment . Wimblehurst to a youngster in my position offered no temptations worth counting , no interests to conflict with study , no vices - such vices as it offered were coarsely stripped of any imaginative glamourfull drunkenness , clumsy leering shameful lust , no social intercourse even to waste one 's time , and on the other hand it would minister greatly to the self - esteem of a conspicuously industrious student . One was marked as "
40739	41840	42370	42370	Jove	476	" one played up to the part , and one 's little accomplishment stood out finely in one 's private reckoning against the sunlit small ignorance of that agreeable place . One went with an intent rush across the market square , one took one 's exercise with as dramatic a sense of an ordered day as an Oxford don , one burnt the midnight oil quite consciously at the rare respectful , benighted passer - by . And one stood out finely in the local paper with one 's unapproachable yearly harvest of certificates . Thus I was not only a genuinely keen student , but also a little of a prig and poseur in those days - and the latter kept the former at it , as London made clear . Moreover Wimblehurst had given me no outlet in any other direction . But I did not realise all this when I came to London , did not perceive how the change of atmosphere began at once to warp and distribute my energies . In the first place I became invisible . If I idled for a day , no one except my fellow - students ( who evidently had no awe for me ) remarked it . No one saw my midnight taper ; no one pointed me out as I crossed the street as an astonishing intellectual phenomenon . In the next place I became inconsiderable . In Wimblehurst I felt I stood for Science ; nobody there seemed to have so much as I and to have it so fully and completely . In London I walked ignorant in an immensity , and it was clear that among my fellow - students from the midlands and the north I was ill - equipped and under - trained . With the utmost exertion I should only take a secondary position among them . And finally , in the third place , I was distracted by voluminous new interests ; London took hold of me , and Science , which had been the universe , shrank back to the dimensions of tiresome little formulae compacted in a book . I came to London in late September , and it was a very different London from that great greyly - overcast , smoke - stained house - wilderness of my first impressions . I reached it by Victoria and not by Cannon Street , and its centre was now in Exhibition Road . It shone , pale amber , blue - grey and tenderly spacious and fine under clear autumnal skies , a London of hugely handsome buildings and vistas and distances , a London of gardens and labyrinthine tall museums , of old trees and remote palaces and artificial waters . I lodged near by in West Brompton at a house in a little square . So London faced me the second time , making me forget altogether for a while the grey , drizzling city visage that had first looked upon me . I settled down and went to and fro to my lectures and laboratory ; in the beginning I worked hard , and only slowly did the curiosity that presently possessed me to know more of this huge urban province arise , the desire to find something beyond mechanism that I could serve , some use other than learning . With this was a growing sense of loneliness , a desire for adventure and intercourse . I found myself in the evenings poring over a map of London I had bought , instead of copying out lecture notes - and on Sundays I made explorations , taking omnibus rides east and west and north and south , and to enlarging and broadening the sense of great swarming hinterlands of humanity with whom I had no dealings , of whom I knew nothing .... The whole illimitable place teemed with suggestions of indefinite and sometimes outrageous possibility , of hidden but magnificent meanings . It was n't simply that I received a vast impression of space and multitude and opportunity ; intimate things also were suddenly dragged from neglected , veiled and darkened corners into an acute vividness of perception . Close at hand in the big art museum I came for the first time upon the beauty of nudity , which I had hitherto held to be a shameful secret , flaunted and gloried in ; I was made aware of beauty as not only permissible , but desirable and frequent and of a thousand hitherto unsuspected rich aspects of life . One night in a real rapture , I walked round the upper gallery of the Albert Hall and listened for the first time to great music ; I believe now that it was a rendering of Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony .... My apprehension of spaces and places was reinforced by a quickened apprehension of persons . A constant stream of people passed by me , eyes met and challenged mine and passed - more and more I wanted then to stay - if I went eastward towards Piccadilly , women who seemed then to my boyish inexperience softly splendid and alluring , murmured to me as they passed . Extraordinarily life unveiled . The very hoardings clamoured strangely at one 's senses and curiosities . One bought pamphlets and papers full of strange and daring ideas transcending one 's boldest ; in the parks one heard men discussing the very existence of God , denying the rights of property , debating a hundred things that one dared not think about in Wimblehurst . And after the ordinary overcast day , after dull mornings , came twilight , and London lit up and became a thing of white and yellow and red jewels of light and wonderful floods of golden illumination and stupendous and unfathomable shadows - and there were no longer any mean or shabby people - but a great mysterious movement of unaccountable beings .... Always I was coming on the queerest new aspects . Late one Saturday night I found myself one of a great slow - moving crowd between the blazing shops and the flaring barrows in the Harrow Road ; I got into conversation with two bold - eyed girls , bought them boxes of chocolate , made the acquaintance of father and mother and various younger brothers and sisters , sat in a public - house hilariously with them all , standing and being stood drinks , and left them in the small hours at the door of "
41843	42171	42370	42370	Jove	476	" never to see them again . And once I was accosted on the outskirts of a Salvation Army meeting in one of the parks by a silk - hatted young man of eager and serious discourse , who argued against scepticism with me , invited me home to tea into a clean and cheerful family of brothers and sisters and friends , and there I spent the evening singing hymns to the harmonium ( which reminded me of half - forgotten Chatham ) , and wishing all the sisters were not so obviously engaged .... Then on the remote hill of this boundless city - world I found Ewart . How well I remember the first morning , a bright Sunday morning in early October , when I raided in upon Ewart ! I found my old schoolfellow in bed in a room over an oil - shop in a back street at the foot of Highgate Hill . His landlady , a pleasant , dirty young woman with soft - brown eyes , brought down his message for me to come up ; and up I went . The room presented itself as ample and interesting in detail and shabby with a quite commendable shabbiness . I had an impression of brown walls - they were papered with brown paper - of a long shelf along one side of the room , with dusty plaster casts and a small cheap lay figure of a horse , of a table and something of grey wax partially covered with a cloth , and of scattered drawings . There was a gas stove in one corner , and some enameled ware that had been used for overnight cooking . The oilcloth on the floor was streaked with a peculiar white dust . Ewart himself was not in the first instance visible , but only a fourfold canvas screen at the end of the room from which shouts proceeded of "
42175	42215	42370	42370	Jove	476	" then his wiry black hair , very much rumpled , and a staring red - brown eye and his stump of a nose came round the edge of this at a height of about three feet from the ground "
42221	42225	42218	42219	old Ponderevo	435	" he said , "
42256	42368	42370	42370	Jove	476	" I walked round , wrung his hand , and we surveyed one another . He was lying on a small wooden fold - up bed , the scanty covering of which was supplemented by an overcoat and an elderly but still cheerful pair of check trousers , and he was wearing pajamas of a virulent pink and green . His neck seemed longer and more stringy than it had been even in our schooldays , and his upper lip had a wiry black moustache . The rest of his ruddy , knobby countenance , his erratic hair and his general hairy leanness had not even - to my perceptions grown . "
42372	42376	42370	42370	Jove	476	" he said , "
42394	42395	42389	42389	you	476	" "
42407	42408	42403	42403	you	435	" "
42418	42422	42423	42423	I	0	" He hesitated . "
42546	42588	42595	42595	Ponderevo	435	" He directed me in the service of his simple hospitality , and presently I came back to his bed and sat down and smiled at him there , smoking comfortably , with his hands under his head , surveying me . "
42627	42651	42625	42625	you	435	" I felt a pipe was becoming after all , and that lit , I gave him a favourable sketch of my career . "
42847	42858	42838	42838	you	435	" I finished and hesitated on some vague foolish lie , "
42861	42872	42874	42874	you	435	" I said , a little ashamed of the truth . "
42882	42883	42876	42876	I	0	" "
42898	42923	42845	42845	Ponderevo	435	" He sucked at his pipe for a space and stared at the plaster cast of a flayed hand that hung on the wall . "
43072	43073	43076	43076	her	1864	" "
43090	43091	43076	43076	her	1864	" "
43097	43101	43076	43076	her	1864	" said Ewart . "
43171	43187	43191	43191	she	1864	" He sat up in bed , to put this question with the greater earnestness . "
43247	43279	43241	43241	They	1897	" He had an air of having saved up these difficulties for me for some time . He sat with his chin almost touching his knees , sucking at his pipe . "
43286	43291	43241	43241	They	1897	" he went on , "
43337	43338	43332	43332	you	435	" "
43341	43345	43332	43332	you	435	" I began . "
43351	43352	43332	43332	you	435	" "
43448	43449	43482	43483	a grocer	1912	" "
43457	43461	43482	43483	a grocer	1912	" I said . "
43466	43467	43462	43462	We	1909	" "
43525	43526	43523	43523	you	1914	" "
43532	43533	43528	43528	you	1914	" "
43541	43542	43537	43537	you	1914	" "
43548	43552	43537	43537	you	1914	" I said . "
43587	43588	43582	43582	I	0	" "
43591	43595	43582	43582	I	0	" he mused . "
43619	43628	43635	43635	Ponderevo	435	" He hugged his knees for a space . "
43640	43645	43635	43635	Ponderevo	435	" He became animated . "
43654	43658	43659	43659	you	435	" he said , "
43761	44023	43749	43749	Cockroach	479	" So in the first five minutes of our talk , as I seem to remember it now , old Ewart struck the note that ran through all that morning 's intercourse .... To me it was a most memorable talk because it opened out quite new horizons of thought . I 'd been working rather close and out of touch with Ewart 's free gesticulating way . He was pessimistic that day and sceptical to the very root of things . He made me feel clearly , what I had not felt at all before , the general adventurousness of life , particularly of life at the stage we had reached , and also the absence of definite objects , of any concerted purpose in the lives that were going on all round us . He made me feel , too , how ready I was to take up commonplace assumptions . Just as I had always imagined that somewhere in social arrangements there was certainly a Head - Master who would intervene if one went too far , so I had always had a sort of implicit belief that in our England there were somewhere people who understood what we were all , as a nation , about . That crumpled into his pit of doubt and vanished . He brought out , sharply cut and certain , the immense effect of purposelessness in London that I was already indistinctly feeling . We found ourselves at last returning through Highgate Cemetery and Waterlow Park - and Ewart was talking . "
44029	44047	43749	43749	Cockroach	479	" he said , stopping and pointing to the great vale of London spreading wide and far . "
44077	44100	44101	44101	We	1919	" He swung his arms to the long slopes about us , tombs and headstones in long perspectives , in limitless rows . "
44146	44150	44152	44152	you	1922	" He paused . "
44259	44329	44251	44251	I	0	" That was the way of it , anyhow . I drank deep of talk that day ; we went into theology , into philosophy ; I had my first glimpse of socialism . I felt as though I had been silent in a silence since I and he had parted . At the thought of socialism Ewart 's moods changed for a time to a sort of energy . "
44350	44619	44342	44342	you	1927	" It was a good talk that rambled through all the universe . I thought I was giving my mind refreshment , but indeed it was dissipation . All sorts of ideas , even now , carry me back as it were to a fountain - head , to Waterlow Park and my resuscitated Ewart . There stretches away south of us long garden slopes and white gravestones and the wide expanse of London , and somewhere in the picture is a red old wall , sun - warmed , and a great blaze of Michaelmas daisies set off with late golden sunflowers and a drift of mottled , blood - red , fallen leaves . It was with me that day as though I had lifted my head suddenly out of dull and immediate things and looked at life altogether .... But it played the very devil with the copying up of my arrears of notes to which I had vowed the latter half of that day . After that reunion Ewart and I met much and talked much , and in our subsequent encounters his monologue was interrupted and I took my share . He had exercised me so greatly that I lay awake at nights thinking him over , and discoursed and answered him in my head as I went in the morning to the College . I am by nature a doer and only by the way a critic ; his philosophical assertion of the incalculable vagueness of life which fitted his natural indolence roused my more irritable and energetic nature to active protests . "
44626	44630	44342	44342	you	1927	" I said , "
44670	44708	44667	44667	you	1930	" Ewart gave me all my first conceptions of socialism ; in a little while I was an enthusiastic socialist and he was a passive resister to the practical exposition of the theories he had taught me . "
44715	44719	44720	44720	We	1932	" I said . "
44741	44821	44736	44736	People	920	" You must figure me a rather ill - dressed young man in a state of great earnestness , standing up in that shabby studio of his and saying these things , perhaps with some gesticulations , and Ewart with a clay - smudged face , dressed perhaps in a flannel shirt and trousers , with a pipe in his mouth , squatting philosophically at a table , working at some chunk of clay that never got beyond suggestion . "
44831	45031	44822	44822	I	0	" he said . It was only very slowly I came to gauge Ewart 's real position in the scheme of things , to understand how deliberate and complete was this detachment of his from the moral condemnation and responsibilities that played so fine a part in his talk . His was essentially the nature of an artistic appreciator ; he could find interest and beauty in endless aspects of things that I marked as evil , or at least as not negotiable ; and the impulse I had towards self - deception , to sustained and consistent self - devotion , disturbed and detached and pointless as it was at that time , he had indeed a sort of admiration for but no sympathy . Like many fantastic and ample talkers he was at bottom secretive , and he gave me a series of little shocks of discovery throughout our intercourse . The first of these came in the realisation that he quite seriously meant to do nothing in the world at all towards reforming the evils he laid bare in so easy and dexterous a manner . The next came in the sudden appearance of a person called "
45032	45083	45084	45085	Canary Sack	483	Milly"-I've forgotten her surname - whom I found in his room one evening , simply attired in a blue wrap - the rest of her costume behind the screen - smoking cigarettes and sharing a flagon of an amazingly cheap and self - assertive grocer 's wine Ewart affected , called "
45087	45088	45084	45085	Canary Sack	483	" "
45091	45100	45084	45085	Canary Sack	483	" said Ewart , as I came in . "
45132	45402	45403	45403	We	1939	" Milly was a woman of thirty , perhaps , with a broad , rather pretty face , a placid disposition , a bad accent and delightful blond hair that waved off her head with an irrepressible variety of charm ; and whenever Ewart spoke she beamed at him . Ewart was always sketching this hair of hers and embarking upon clay statuettes of her that were never finished . She was , I know now , a woman of the streets , whom Ewart had picked up in the most casual manner , and who had fallen in love with him , but my inexperience in those days was too great for me to place her then , and Ewart offered no elucidations . She came to him , he went to her , they took holidays together in the country when certainly she sustained her fair share of their expenditure . I suspect him now even of taking money from her . Odd old Ewart ! It was a relationship so alien to my orderly conceptions of honour , to what I could imagine any friend of mine doing , that I really hardly saw it with it there under my nose . But I see it and I think I understand it now .... Before I fully grasped the discursive manner in which Ewart was committed to his particular way in life , I did , I say , as the broad constructive ideas of socialism took hold of me , try to get him to work with me in some definite fashion as a socialist . "
45412	45416	45417	45417	They	1940	" I said . "
45422	45423	45417	45417	They	1940	" "
45433	45613	45417	45417	They	1940	" After some pains we discovered the office of the Fabian Society , lurking in a cellar in Clement 's Inn ; and we went and interviewed a rather discouraging secretary who stood astraddle in front of a fire and questioned us severely and seemed to doubt the integrity of our intentions profoundly . He advised us to attend the next open meeting in Clifford 's Inn and gave us the necessary data . We both contrived to get to the affair , and heard a discursive gritty paper on Trusts and one of the most inconclusive discussions you can imagine . Three - quarters of the speakers seemed under some jocular obsession which took the form of pretending to be conceited . It was a sort of family joke , and as strangers to the family we did not like it .... As we came out through the narrow passage from Clifford 's Inn to the Strand , Ewart suddenly pitched upon a wizened , spectacled little man in a vast felt hat and a large orange tie . "
45626	45641	45417	45417	They	1940	" he asked . The little man became at once defensive in his manner . "
45646	45650	45417	45417	They	1940	" he said ; "
45654	45655	45417	45417	They	1940	" "
45663	45675	45417	45417	They	1940	" The little man gave a nervous self - satisfied laugh . "
45684	45756	45676	45676	I	0	" he said . The little man dropped out of existence and we emerged upon the Strand . Ewart twisted his arm into a queerly eloquent gesture that gathered up all the tall facades of the banks , the business places , the projecting clock and towers of the Law Courts , the advertisements , the luminous signs , into one social immensity , into a capitalistic system gigantic and invincible . "
45765	45769	45775	45775	them	1942	" he said . "
45777	46081	45772	45772	you	1941	" Ewart , as the embodiment of talk , was certainly a leading factor in my conspicuous failure to go on studying . Social theory in its first crude form of Democratic Socialism gripped my intelligence more and more powerfully . I argued in the laboratory with the man who shared my bench until we quarreled and did not speak and also I fell in love . The ferment of sex had been creeping into my being like a slowly advancing tide through all my Wimblehurst days , the stimulus of London was like the rising of a wind out of the sea that brings the waves in fast and high . Ewart had his share in that . More and more acutely and unmistakably did my perception of beauty , form and sound , my desire for adventure , my desire for intercourse , converge on this central and commanding business of the individual life . I had to get me a mate . I began to fall in love faintly with girls I passed in the street , with women who sat before me in trains , with girl fellow - students , with ladies in passing carriages , with loiterers at the corners , with neat - handed waitresses in shops and tea - rooms , with pictures even of girls and women . On my rare visits to the theatre I always became exalted , and found the actresses and even the spectators about me mysterious , attractive , creatures of deep interest and desire . I had a stronger and stronger sense that among these glancing , passing multitudes there was somewhere one who was for me . And in spite of every antagonistic force in the world , there was something in my very marrow that insisted : "
46126	46713	45772	45772	you	1941	" It is odd that I ca n't remember when first I saw Marion , who became my wife - whom I was to make wretched , who was to make me wretched , who was to pluck that fine generalised possibility of love out of my early manhood and make it a personal conflict . I became aware of her as one of a number of interesting attractive figures that moved about in my world , that glanced back at my eyes , that flitted by with a kind of averted watchfulness . I would meet her coming through the Art Museum , which was my short cut to the Brompton Road , or see her sitting , reading as I thought , in one of the bays of the Education Library . But really , as I found out afterwards , she never read . She used to come there to eat a bun in quiet . She was a very gracefully - moving figure of a girl then , very plainly dressed , with dark brown hair I remember , in a knot low on her neck behind that confessed the pretty roundness of her head and harmonised with the admirable lines of ears and cheek , the grave serenity of mouth and brow . She stood out among the other girls very distinctly because they dressed more than she did , struck emphatic notes of colour , startled one by novelties in hats and bows and things . I 've always hated the rustle , the disconcerting colour boundaries , the smart unnatural angles of women 's clothes . Her plain black dress gave her a starkness .... I do remember , though , how one afternoon I discovered the peculiar appeal of her form for me . I had been restless with my work and had finally slipped out of the Laboratory and come over to the Art Museum to lounge among the pictures . I came upon her in an odd corner of the Sheepshanks gallery , intently copying something from a picture that hung high . I had just been in the gallery of casts from the antique , my mind was all alive with my newly awakened sense of line , and there she stood with face upturned , her body drooping forward from the hips just a little - memorably graceful - feminine . After that I know I sought to see her , felt a distinctive emotion at her presence , began to imagine things about her . I no longer thought of generalised womanhood or of this casual person or that . I thought of her . An accident brought us together . I found myself one Monday morning in an omnibus staggering westward from Victoria - I was returning from a Sunday I 'd spent at Wimblehurst in response to a unique freak of hospitality on the part of Mr. Mantell . She was the sole other inside passenger . And when the time came to pay her fare , she became an extremely scared , disconcerted and fumbling young woman ; she had left her purse at home . Luckily I had some money . She looked at me with startled , troubled brown eyes ; she permitted my proffered payment to the conductor with a certain ungraciousness that seemed a part of her shyness , and then as she rose to go , she thanked me with an obvious affectation of ease . "
46719	46733	46715	46715	you	1947	" she said in a pleasant soft voice ; and then less gracefully , "
46742	46900	46737	46737	you	1947	" I fancy I made polite noises . But just then I was n't disposed to be critical . I was full of the sense of her presence ; her arm was stretched out over me as she moved past me , the gracious slenderness of her body was near me . The words we used did n't seem very greatly to matter . I had vague ideas of getting out with her - and I did n't . That encounter , I have no doubt , exercised me enormously . I lay awake at night rehearsing it , and wondering about the next phase of our relationship . That took the form of the return of my twopence . I was in the Science Library , digging something out of the Encyclopedia Britannica , when she appeared beside me and placed on the open page an evidently premeditated thin envelope , bulgingly confessing the coins within . "
46909	46913	46907	46907	you	1948	" she said , "
46929	46935	46928	46928	Mr.-	1949	" I supplied my name . "
46939	46943	46928	46928	Mr.-	1949	" I said , "

46983	47170	46972	46972	I	0	" I plunged into autobiography and questionings , and so entangled her in a conversation that got a quality of intimacy through the fact that , out of deference to our fellow - readers , we were obliged to speak in undertones . And I have no doubt that in substance it was singularly banal . Indeed I have an impression that all our early conversations were incredibly banal . We met several times in a manner half - accidental , half furtive and wholly awkward . Mentally I did n't take hold of her . I never did take hold of her mentally . Her talk , I now know all too clearly , was shallow , pretentious , evasive . Only - even to this day - I do n't remember it as in any way vulgar . She was , I could see quite clearly , anxious to overstate or conceal her real social status , a little desirous to be taken for a student in the art school and a little ashamed that she was n't . She came to the museum to "
47174	47228	46972	46972	I	0	" and this , I gathered , had something to do with some way of partially earning her living that I was n't to inquire into . I told her things about myself , vain things that I felt might appeal to her , but that I learnt long afterwards made her think me "
47231	47257	46972	46972	I	0	" We talked of books , but there she was very much on her guard and secretive , and rather more freely of pictures . She "
47259	47609	46972	46972	I	0	" pictures . I think from the outset I appreciated and did not for a moment resent that hers was a commonplace mind , that she was the unconscious custodian of something that had gripped my most intimate instinct , that she embodied the hope of a possibility , was the careless proprietor of a physical quality that had turned my head like strong wine . I felt I had to stick to our acquaintance , flat as it was . Presently we should get through these irrelevant exterior things , and come to the reality of love beneath . I saw her in dreams released , as it were , from herself , beautiful , worshipful , glowing . And sometimes when we were together , we would come on silences through sheer lack of matter , and then my eyes would feast on her , and the silence seemed like the drawing back of a curtain - her superficial self . Odd , I confess . Odd , particularly , the enormous hold of certain things about her upon me , a certain slight rounded duskiness of skin , a certain perfection of modelling in her lips , her brow , a certain fine flow about the shoulders . She was n't indeed beautiful to many people - these things are beyond explaining . She had manifest defects of form and feature , and they did n't matter at all . Her complexion was bad , but I do n't think it would have mattered if it had been positively unwholesome . I had extraordinarily limited , extraordinarily painful , desires . I longed intolerably to kiss her lips . The affair was immensely serious and commanding to me . I do n't remember that in these earlier phases I had any thought of turning back at all . It was clear to me that she regarded me with an eye entirely more critical than I had for her , that she did n't like my scholarly untidiness , my want of even the most commonplace style . "
47618	47860	46972	46972	I	0	" she said , and sent me in pursuit of gentlemanly neckwear . I remember when she invited me a little abruptly one day to come to tea at her home on the following Sunday and meet her father and mother and aunt , that I immediately doubted whether my hitherto unsuspected best clothes would create the impression she desired me to make on her belongings . I put off the encounter until the Sunday after , to get myself in order . I had a morning coat made and I bought a silk hat , and had my reward in the first glance of admiration she ever gave me . I wonder how many of my sex are as preposterous . I was , you see , abandoning all my beliefs , my conventions unasked . I was forgetting myself immensely . And there was a conscious shame in it all . Never a word - did I breathe to Ewart - to any living soul of what was going on . Her father and mother and aunt struck me as the dismalest of people , and her home in Walham Green was chiefly notable for its black and amber tapestry carpets and curtains and table - cloths , and the age and irrelevance of its books , mostly books with faded gilt on the covers . The windows were fortified against the intrusive eye by cheap lace curtains and an "
47863	48112	46972	46972	I	0	" upon an unstable octagonal table . Several framed Art School drawings of Marion 's , bearing official South Kensington marks of approval , adorned the room , and there was a black and gilt piano with a hymn - book on the top of it . There were draped mirrors over all the mantels , and above the sideboard in the dining - room in which we sat at tea was a portrait of her father , villainously truthful after the manner of such works . I could n't see a trace of the beauty I found in her in either parent , yet she somehow contrived to be like them both . These people pretended in a way that reminded me of the Three Great Women in my mother 's room , but they had not nearly so much social knowledge and did not do it nearly so well . Also , I remarked , they did it with an eye on Marion . They had wanted to thank me , they said , for the kindness to their daughter in the matter of the ' bus fare , and so accounted for anything unusual in their invitation . They posed as simple gentlefolk , a little hostile to the rush and gadding - about of London , preferring a secluded and unpretentious quiet . When Marion got out the white table - cloth from the sideboard - drawer for tea , a card bearing the word "
48114	48278	48279	48279	I	0	" fell to the floor . I picked it up and gave it to her before I realised from her quickened colour that I should not have seen it ; that probably had been removed from the window in honour of my coming . Her father spoke once in a large remote way of he claims of business engagements , and it was only long afterwards I realised that he was a supernumerary clerk in the Walham Green Gas Works and otherwise a useful man at home . He was a large , loose , fattish man with unintelligent brown eyes magnified by spectacles ; he wore an ill - fitting frock - coat and a paper collar , and he showed me , as his great treasure and interest , a large Bible which he had grangerised with photographs of pictures . Also he cultivated the little garden - yard behind the house , and he had a small greenhouse with tomatoes . "
48287	48291	48281	48281	I	0	" he said . "
48317	48504	48305	48305	you	1957	" Both he and Marion 's mother treated her with a deference that struck me as the most natural thing in the world . Her own manner changed , became more authoritative and watchful , her shyness disappeared . She had taken a line of her own I gathered , draped the mirror , got the second - hand piano , and broken her parents in . Her mother must once have been a pretty woman ; she had regular features and Marion 's hair without its lustre , but she was thin and careworn . The aunt , Miss Ramboat , was a large , abnormally shy person very like her brother , and I do n't recall anything she said on this occasion . To begin with there was a good deal of tension , Marion was frightfully nervous and every one was under the necessity of behaving in a mysteriously unreal fashion until I plunged , became talkative and made a certain ease and interest . I told them of the schools , of my lodgings , of Wimblehurst and my apprenticeship days . "
48515	48520	48305	48305	you	1957	" Mr. Ramboat reflected ; "
48532	48544	48522	48522	I	0	" I was young enough to be led into what he called "
48551	48562	48563	48563	I	0	" which Marion truncated before our voices became unduly raised . "
48567	48571	48563	48563	I	0	" she said , "
48582	48816	48817	48817	I	0	" I remember Marion 's mother asked me what church I attended , and that I replied evasively . After tea there was music and we sang hymns . I doubted if I had a voice when this was proposed , but that was held to be a trivial objection , and I found sitting close beside the sweep of hair from Marion 's brow had many compensations . I discovered her mother sitting in the horsehair armchair and regarding us sentimentally . I went for a walk with Marion towards Putney Bridge , and then there was more singing and a supper of cold bacon and pie , after which Mr. Ramboat and I smoked . During that walk , I remember , she told me the import of her sketchings and copyings in the museum . A cousin of a friend of hers whom she spoke of as Smithie , had developed an original business in a sort of tea - gown garment which she called a Persian Robe , a plain sort of wrap with a gaily embroidered yoke , and Marion went there and worked in the busy times . In the times that were n't busy she designed novelties in yokes by an assiduous use of eyes and note - book in the museum , and went home and traced out the captured forms on the foundation material . "
48823	48827	48817	48817	I	0	" said Marion , "
48867	49157	48861	48861	Smithie	488	" I quite understood the workgirls were dreadfully common . I do n't remember that the Walham Green menage and the quality of these people , nor the light they threw on Marion , detracted in the slightest degree at that time from the intent resolve that held me to make her mine . I did n't like them . But I took them as part of the affair . Indeed , on the whole , I think they threw her up by an effect of contrast ; she was so obviously controlling them , so consciously superior to them . More and more of my time did I give to this passion that possessed me . I began to think chiefly of ways of pleasing Marion , of acts of devotion , of treats , of sumptuous presents for her , of appeals she would understand . If at times she was manifestly unintelligent , in her ignorance became indisputable , I told myself her simple instincts were worth all the education and intelligence in the world . And to this day I think I was n't really wrong about her . There was something extraordinarily fine about her , something simple and high , that flickered in and out of her ignorance and commonness and limitations like the tongue from the mouth of a snake .... One night I was privileged to meet her and bring her home from an entertainment at the Birkbeck Institute . We came back on the underground railway and we travelled first - class - that being the highest class available . We were alone in the carriage , and for the first time I ventured to put my arm about her . "
49162	49167	49158	49158	You	1961	" she said feebly . "
49172	49201	49168	49168	I	0	" I whispered suddenly with my heart beating wildly , drew her to me , drew all her beauty to me and kissed her cool and unresisting lips . "
49205	49214	49203	49203	me	0	" she said , struggling away from me , "
49218	49230	49203	49203	me	0	" and then , as the train ran into a station , "
49249	49305	49203	49203	me	0	" Then two other people got in with us and terminated my wooing for a time . When we found ourselves alone together , walking towards Battersea , she had decided to be offended . I parted from her unforgiven and terribly distressed . When we met again , she told me I must never say "
49307	49343	49203	49203	me	0	" again . I had dreamt that to kiss her lips was ultimate satisfaction . But it was indeed only the beginning of desires . I told her my one ambition was to marry her . "
49346	49350	49351	49351	you	1964	" she said , "
49367	49373	49351	49351	you	1964	" I stared at her . "
49378	49382	49383	49383	You	1964	" I said . "
49387	49391	49383	49383	You	1964	" she answered . "

49403	49456	49457	49457	I	0	" I insisted . I stood not a yard from the sweet lips I had kissed ; I stood within arm 's length of the inanimate beauty I desired to quicken , and I saw opening between us a gulf of years , toil , waiting , disappointments and an immense uncertainty . "
49461	49465	49457	49457	I	0	" I said . "
49472	49484	49468	49468	you	1964	" She looked me in the face with grave irresponsive eyes . "

49508	49572	49485	49485	I	0	" I can remember now my sense of frustration by her unresilient reply . I should have perceived then that for her my ardour had no quickening fire . But how was I to know ? I had let myself come to want her , my imagination endowed her with infinite possibilities . I wanted her and wanted her , stupidly and instinctively .... "
49575	49578	49485	49485	I	0	" I said "
49581	49582	49583	49583	One	696	" "
49589	49593	49583	49583	One	696	" she replied . "
49610	49848	49849	49851	an unmitigated rotter	1968	" Well , you begin to understand my breakdown now , I have been copious enough with these apologia . My work got more and more spiritless , my behaviour degenerated , my punctuality declined ; I was more and more outclassed in the steady grind by my fellow - students . Such supplies of moral energy as I still had at command shaped now in the direction of serving Marion rather than science . I fell away dreadfully , more and more I shirked and skulked ; the humped men from the north , the pale men with thin , clenched minds , the intent , hard - breathing students I found against me , fell at last from keen rivalry to moral contempt . Even a girl got above me upon one of the lists . Then indeed I made it a point of honour to show by my public disregard of every rule that I really did not even pretend to try . So one day I found myself sitting in a mood of considerable astonishment in Kensington Gardens , reacting on a recent heated interview with the school Registrar in which I had displayed more spirit than sense . I was astonished chiefly at my stupendous falling away from all the militant ideals of unflinching study I had brought up from Wimblehurst . I had displayed myself , as the Registrar put it , "
49853	49875	49849	49851	an unmitigated rotter	1968	" My failure to get marks in the written examination had only been equalled by the insufficiency of my practical work . "
49880	49886	49876	49876	I	0	" the Registrar had said , "
49898	50121	50122	50122	my	0	" It certainly was an interesting question . What was going to become of me ? It was clear there would be nothing for me in the schools as I had once dared to hope ; there seemed , indeed , scarcely anything in the world except an illpaid assistantship in some provincial organized Science School or grammar school . I knew that for that sort of work , without a degree or any qualification , one earned hardly a bare living and had little leisure to struggle up to anything better . If only I had even as little as fifty pounds I might hold out in London and take my B.Sc . degree , and quadruple my chances ! My bitterness against my uncle returned at the thought . After all , he had some of my money still , or ought to have . Why should n't I act within my rights , threaten to ' take proceedings ' ? I meditated for a space on the idea , and then returned to the Science Library and wrote him a very considerable and occasionally pungent letter . That letter to my uncle was the nadir of my failure . Its remarkable consequences , which ended my student days altogether , I will tell in the next chapter . I say "
50125	50788	50122	50122	my	0	" Yet there are times when I can even doubt whether that period was a failure at all , when I become defensively critical of those exacting courses I did not follow , the encyclopaedic process of scientific exhaustion from which I was distracted . My mind was not inactive , even if it fed on forbidden food . I did not learn what my professors and demonstrators had resolved I should learn , but I learnt many things . My mind learnt to swing wide and to swing by itself . After all , those other fellows who took high places in the College examinations and were the professor 's model boys have n't done so amazingly . Some are professors themselves , some technical experts ; not one can show things done such as I , following my own interest , have achieved . For I have built boats that smack across the water like whiplashes ; no one ever dreamt of such boats until I built them ; and I have surprised three secrets that are more than technical discoveries , in the unexpected hiding - places of Nature . I have come nearer flying than any man has done . Could I have done as much if I had had a turn for obeying those rather mediocre professors at the college who proposed to train my mind ? If I had been trained in research - that ridiculous contradiction in terms - should I have done more than produce additions to the existing store of little papers with blunted conclusions , of which there are already too many ? I see no sense in mock modesty upon this matter . Even by the standards of worldly success I am , by the side of my fellow - students , no failure . I had my F.R.S. by the time I was thirty - seven , and if I am not very wealthy poverty is as far from me as the Spanish Inquisition . Suppose I had stamped down on the head of my wandering curiosity , locked my imagination in a box just when it wanted to grow out to things , worked by so - and - so 's excellent method and so - and - so 's indications , where should I be now ? I may be all wrong in this . It may be I should be a far more efficient man than I am if I had cut off all those divergent expenditures of energy , plugged up my curiosity about society with more currently acceptable rubbish or other , abandoned Ewart , evaded Marion instead of pursuing her , concentrated . But I do n't believe it ! However , I certainly believed it completely and was filled with remorse on that afternoon when I sat dejectedly in Kensington Gardens and reviewed , in the light of the Registrar 's pertinent questions my first two years in London . Throughout my student days I had not seen my uncle . I refrained from going to him in spite of an occasional regret that in this way I estranged myself from my aunt Susan , and I maintained a sulky attitude of mind towards him . And I do n't think that once in all that time I gave a thought to that mystic word of his that was to alter all the world for us . Yet I had not altogether forgotten it . It was with a touch of memory , dim transient perplexity if no more - why did this thing seem in some way personal?-that I read a new inscription upon the hoardings : THE SECRET OF VIGOUR , TONO - BUNGAY . That was all . It was simple and yet in some way arresting . I found myself repeating the word after I had passed ; it roused one 's attention like the sound of distant guns . "

I will confess I felt a magic charm in our relative proportions as the two colossal , pale - blue - and - red liveried porters of Schafers ' held open the inner doors for us with a respectful salutation that in some manner they seemed to confine wholly to my uncle . Instead of being about four inches taller , I felt at least the same size as he , and very much slenderer . Still more respectful - waiters relieved him of the new hat and the dignified umbrella , and took his orders for our lunch . He gave them with a fine assurance . He nodded to several of the waiters .

52655	52784	52652	52652	you	480	" He reverted to the direction of our lunch . Presently he was leading the way to the lounge - sumptuous piece in red morocco and yellow glazed crockery , with incredible vistas of settees and sofas and things , and there I found myself grouped with him in two excessively upholstered chairs with an earthenware Moorish table between us bearing coffee and Benedictine , and I was tasting the delights of a tenpenny cigar . My uncle smoked a similar cigar in an habituated manner , and he looked energetic and knowing and luxurious and most unexpectedly a little bounder , round the end of it . It was just a trivial flaw upon our swagger , perhaps that we both were clear our cigars had to be "

I felt that we should strike an unbiased observer as a couple of very deep and wily and developing and repulsive persons . "

53080	53108	53034	53034	he	731	" said my uncle , shifting the venue from the region of honour to the region of courage . And then with a characteristic outburst of piety , "
53117	53196	53197	53197	He	2007	" And now , I suppose , you ask where do YOU come in ? Well , fact is I 've always believed in you , George . You 've got - it 's a sort of dismal grit . Bark your shins , rouse you , and you 'll go ! You 'd rush any position you had a mind to rush . I know a bit about character , George - trust me . You 've got- "
53218	53242	53197	53197	He	2007	" Wooosh ! Yes . You have ! The way you put away that Latin at Wimblehurst ; I 've never forgotten it . "

53468	53480	53432	53432	George	480	"-He made alluring expanding circles in the air with his hand . "
53483	53512	53432	53432	George	480	" His proposal , sinking to confidential undertones again , took more definite shape . I was to give all my time and energy to developing and organising . "

53537	53560	53531	53531	I	0	" And the telegram was no flourish ; I was to have three hundred a year . Three hundred a year . ( "

53592	53660	53587	53588	the vendor	2013	" ) Three hundred a year certain , anyhow ! It was an enormous income to me . For a moment I was altogether staggered . Could there be that much money in the whole concern ? I looked about me at the sumptuous furniture of Schafer 's Hotel . No doubt there were many such incomes . My head was spinning with unwonted Benedictine and Burgundy . "

53839	54107	53834	53834	I	0	" I seem to remember very quick changes of mind after that lunch . The muzzy exaltation of the unaccustomed stimulants gave way very rapidly to a model of pellucid and impartial clairvoyance which is one of my habitual mental states . It is intermittent ; it leaves me for weeks together , I know , but back it comes at last like justice on circuit , and calls up all my impression , all my illusions , all my willful and passionate proceedings . We came downstairs again into that inner room which pretended to be a scientific laboratory through its high glass lights , and indeed was a lurking place . My uncle pressed a cigarette on me , and I took it and stood before the empty fireplace while he propped his umbrella in the corner , deposited the new silk hat that was a little too big for him on the table , blew copiously and produced a second cigar . It came into my head that he had shrunken very much in size since the Wimblehurst days , that the cannon ball he had swallowed was rather more evident and shameless than it had been , his skin less fresh and the nose between his glasses , which still did n't quite fit , much redder . And just then he seemed much laxer in his muscles and not quite as alertly quick in his movements . But he evidently was n't aware of the degenerative nature of his changes as he sat there , looking suddenly quite little under my eyes . "
54112	54124	54110	54110	George	480	" he said , quite happily unconscious of my silent criticism , "

55005	55014	55015	55015	You	480	" My uncle suddenly rose to his feet . "
55189	55195	55187	55187	George	480	" And he smiled endearingly . "
55203	55799	55196	55196	I	0	" he said , ending the smile , and vanished into the outer room . I did n't succumb without a struggle to my uncle 's allurements . Indeed , I held out for a week while I contemplated life and my prospects . It was a crowded and muddled contemplation . It invaded even my sleep . My interview with the Registrar , my talk with my uncle , my abrupt discovery of the hopeless futility of my passion for Marion , had combined to bring me to sense of crisis . What was I going to do with life ? I remember certain phases of my indecisions very well . I remember going home from our talk . I went down Farringdon Street to the Embankment because I thought to go home by Holborn and Oxford Street would be too crowded for thinking .... That piece of Embankment from Blackfriars to Westminster still reminds me of that momentous hesitation . You know , from first to last , I saw the business with my eyes open , I saw its ethical and moral values quite clearly . Never for a moment do I remember myself faltering from my persuasion that the sale of Tono - Bungay was a thoroughly dishonest proceeding . The stuff was , I perceived , a mischievous trash , slightly stimulating , aromatic and attractive , likely to become a bad habit and train people in the habitual use of stronger tonics and insidiously dangerous to people with defective kidneys . It would cost about sevenpence the large bottle to make , including bottling , and we were to sell it at half a crown plus the cost of the patent medicine stamp . A thing that I will confess deterred me from the outset far more than the sense of dishonesty in this affair , was the supreme silliness of the whole concern . I still clung to the idea that the world of men was or should be a sane and just organisation , and the idea that I should set myself gravely , just at the fine springtime of my life , to developing a monstrous bottling and packing warehouse , bottling rubbish for the consumption of foolish , credulous and depressed people , had in it a touch of insanity . My early beliefs still clung to me . I felt assured that somewhere there must be a hitch in the fine prospect of ease and wealth under such conditions ; that somewhere , a little overgrown , perhaps , but still traceable , lay a neglected , wasted path of use and honour for me . My inclination to refuse the whole thing increased rather than diminished at first as I went along the Embankment . In my uncle 's presence there had been a sort of glamour that had prevented an outright refusal . It was a revival of affection for him I felt in his presence , I think , in part , and in part an instinctive feeling that I must consider him as my host . But much more was it a curious persuasion he had the knack of inspiring - a persuasion not so much of his integrity and capacity as of the reciprocal and yielding foolishness of the world . One felt that he was silly and wild , but in some way silly and wild after the fashion of the universe . After all , one must live somehow . I astonished him and myself by temporising . "
55802	55806	55196	55196	I	0	" said I , "
55813	55946	55807	55807	I	0	" And as I went along the embankment the first effect was all against my uncle . He shrank - for a little while he continued to shrink - in perspective until he was only a very small shabby little man in a dirty back street , sending off a few hundred bottles of rubbish to foolish buyers . The great buildings on the right of us , the Inns and the School Board place - as it was then - Somerset House , the big hotels , the great bridges , Westminster 's outlines ahead , had an effect of grey largeness that reduced him to the proportions of a busy black beetle in a crack in the floor . And then my eye caught the advertisements on the south side of "
55951	55953	55954	55954	Cracknell	498	" of "
55959	56318	56327	56330	a pill - vendor	2056	" very bright and prosperous signs , illuminated at night , and I realised how astonishingly they looked at home there , how evidently part they were in the whole thing . I saw a man come charging out of Palace Yard - the policeman touched his helmet to him - with a hat and a bearing astonishingly like my uncle 's . After all,-didn't Cracknell himself sit in the House ? Tono - Bungay shouted at me from a hoarding near Adelphi Terrace ; I saw it afar off near Carfax Street ; it cried out again upon me in Kensington High Street , and burst into a perfect clamour ; six or seven times I saw it as I drew near my diggings . It certainly had an air of being something more than a dream . Yes , I thought it over - thoroughly enough .... Trade rules the world . Wealth rather than trade ! The thing was true , and true too was my uncle 's proposition that the quickest way to get wealth is to sell the cheapest thing possible in the dearest bottle . He was frightfully right after all . Pecunnia non olet,-a Roman emperor said that . Perhaps my great heroes in Plutarch were no more than such men , fine now only because they are distant ; perhaps after all this Socialism to which I had been drawn was only a foolish dream , only the more foolish because all its promises were conditionally true . Morris and these others played with it wittingly ; it gave a zest , a touch of substance , to their aesthetic pleasures . Never would there be good faith enough to bring such things about . They knew it ; every one , except a few young fools , knew it . As I crossed the corner of St. James 's Park wrapped in thought , I dodged back just in time to escape a prancing pair of greys . A stout , common - looking woman , very magnificently dressed , regarded me from the carriage with a scornful eye . "
56322	56326	56327	56330	a pill - vendor	2056	" thought I , "
56334	56361	56327	56332	a pill - vendor 's wife	2057	" Running through all my thoughts , surging out like a refrain , was my uncle 's master - stroke , his admirable touch of praise : "
56386	56477	56383	56383	you	2058	" Ewart as a moral influence was unsatisfactory . I had made up my mind to put the whole thing before him , partly to see how he took it , and partly to hear how it sounded when it was said . I asked him to come and eat with me in an Italian place near Panton Street where one could get a curious , interesting , glutting sort of dinner for eighteen - pence . He came with a disconcerting black - eye that he would n't explain . "
56486	56490	56383	56383	you	2058	" he said , "

56514	56592	56506	56506	I	0	" I said . But as a matter of fact I did n't tell him . I threw out that I was doubtful whether I ought to go into trade , or stick to teaching in view of my deepening socialist proclivities ; and he , warming with the unaccustomed generosity of a sixteen - penny Chianti , ran on from that without any further inquiry as to my trouble . His utterances roved wide and loose . "
56602	56620	56600	56600	Ponderevo	480	" I remember him saying very impressively and punctuating with the nut - crackers as he spoke , "
56735	56740	56722	56722	Ponderevo	480	" He paused impressively . "
56744	56756	56722	56722	Ponderevo	480	" I cried , after a confused attempt to apprehend him . "
56787	56813	56779	56779	George	480	" ... He put down the nut - crackers out of my reach and lugged a greasy - looking note - book from his pocket . "

Talking of mustard , sir , I was at Clapham Junction the other day , and all the banks are overgrown with horse radish that 's got loose from a garden somewhere . You know what horseradish is - grows like wildfire - spreads - spreads . I stood at the end of the platform looking at the stuff and thinking about it . ' Like fame , ' I thought , ' rank and wild where it is n't wanted . Why do n't the really good things in life grow like horseradish ? ' I thought . My mind went off in a peculiar way it does from that to the idea that mustard costs a penny a tin - I bought some the other day for a ham I had . It came into my head that it would be ripping good business to use horseradish to adulterate mustard . I had a sort of idea that I could plunge into business on that , get rich and come back to my own proper monumental art again . And then I said , ' But why adulterate ? I do n't like the idea of adulteration . ' "

Her father came in and stood behind me against the wall , and her aunt appeared beside the sideboard and stood with arms , looking from speaker to speaker , a sternly gratified prophetess .

68823	68852	68853	68853	Ewart	481	" and set off for Highgate and Ewart . He was actually at work - on a bust of Millie , and seemed very glad for any interruption . "

68933	69044	68927	68927	I	0	" he remarked , to clear up ambiguity in my invitation . We got a jar of shandy - gaff , some food , and , on Ewart 's suggestion , two Japanese sunshades in Staines ; we demanded extra cushions at the boathouse and we spent an enormously soothing day in discourse and meditation , our boat moored in a shady place this side of Windsor . I seem to remember Ewart with a cushion forward , only his heels and sunshade and some black ends of hair showing , a voice and no more , against the shining , smoothly - streaming mirror of the trees and bushes .

69051	69059	69060	69060	You	2344	" was the burthen of the voice . "

69688	69870	69871	69871	He	2368	" Grundy , meanwhile , is in a state of complete whirlabout . Long lean knuckly hands pointing and gesticulating ! ' They 're still thinking of things - thinking of things ! It 's dreadful . They get it out of books . I ca n't imagine where they get it ! I must watch ! There 're people over there whispering ! Nobody ought to whisper!-There 's something suggestive in the mere act ! Then , pictures ! In the museum - things too dreadful for words . Why ca n't we have pure art - with the anatomy all wrong and pure and nice - and pure fiction pure poetry , instead of all this stuff with allusions - allusions ? ... Excuse me ! There 's something up behind that locked door ! The keyhole ! In the interests of public morality - yes , Sir , as a pure good man - I insist - I'LL look - it wo n't hurt me - I insist on looking my duty - M'm'm - the keyhole ! ' "
69883	69930	69879	69879	I	0	" That 's Grundy in one mood , Ponderevo . It is n't Mrs. Grundy . That 's one of the lies we tell about women . They 're too simple . Simple ! Woman ARE simple ! They take on just what men tell 'em . "
69937	69947	69948	69948	he	481	" Just exactly as it 's put to them , "
69959	70147	69948	69948	he	481	" Then you get old Grundy in another mood . Ever caught him nosing , Ponderevo ? Mad with the idea of mysterious , unknown , wicked , delicious things . Things that are n't respectable . Wow ! Things he must n't do ! ... Any one who knows about these things , knows there 's just as much mystery and deliciousness about Grundy 's forbidden things as there is about eating ham . Jolly nice if it 's a bright morning and you 're well and hungry and having breakfast in the open air . Jolly unattractive if you 're off colour . But Grundy 's covered it all up and hidden it and put mucky shades and covers over it until he 's forgotten it . Begins to fester round it in his mind . Has dreadful struggles - with himself about impure thoughts .... Then you set Grundy with hot ears,-curious in undertones . Grundy on the loose , Grundy in a hoarse whisper and with furtive eyes and convulsive movements - making things indecent . Evolving - in dense vapours - indecency ! "
70189	70226	70181	70182	We artists	2371	" And then he 's frantic with repentance . And wants to be cruel to fallen women and decent harmless sculptors of the simple nude - like me - and so back to his panic again . "
70227	70240	70241	70241	I	0	" Mrs. Grundy , I suppose , does n't know he sins , "
70244	70334	70241	70241	I	0	" No ? I 'm not so sure .... But , bless her heart she 's a woman .... She 's a woman . Then again you get Grundy with a large greasy smile - like an accident to a butter tub - all over his face , being Liberal Minded - Grundy in his Anti - Puritan moments , ' trying not to see Harm in it'-Grundy the friend of innocent pleasure . He makes you sick with the Harm he 's trying not to see in it ... "
70475	70494	70495	70495	He	2372	" Suddenly Ewart , with an almost Jack - in - the - box effect , sat up . "
70503	70510	70516	70516	he	2372	" he said , very solemnly . "
70526	70546	70516	70516	he	2372	" He regarded me for my opinion very earnestly , with his pipe in the corner of his mouth . "
70556	70563	70547	70547	You	480	" I said . I reflected . "
70569	70573	70547	70547	You	480	" I asked , "
70581	70604	70576	70576	you	481	" He wrinkled up his queer face , regarded the wait and made his pipe gurgle for a space , thinking deeply . "

71452	71497	71450	71450	Ewart	481	" by a special regulation . As one does organ - grinders . No difficulty about that . And you could forbid it - make it against the etiquette . No life is decent without etiquette .... And people obey etiquette sooner than laws ... "

71559	71632	71557	71557	Ewart	481	" Yes . I forgot . They must n't grow up inside .... They 'd turn out the boys when they were seven . The father must come with a little pony and a little gun and manly wear , and take the boy away . Then one could come afterwards to one 's mother 's balcony .... It must be fine to have a mother . The father and the son ... "

71649	71688	71644	71644	I	0	" but it 's a dream . Let 's come back to reality . What I want to know is , what are you going to do in Brompton , let us say , or Walham Green NOW ? "
71689	71695	71696	71696	he	481	" Oh ! damn it ! "
71699	71711	71713	71713	he	481	" Walham Green ! What a chap you are , Ponderevo ! "
71734	71742	71743	71743	he	481	" While I was talking just now , "
71747	71755	71743	71743	he	481	" I had a quite different idea . "

71760	71795	71743	71743	he	481	" For a masterpiece . A series . Like the busts of the Caesars . Only not heads , you know . We do n't see the people who do things to us nowadays ... "

71806	71850	71722	71722	He	481	" Hands - a series of hands ! The hands of the Twentieth Century . I 'll do it . Some day some one will discover it - go there - see what I have done , and what is meant by it . "
71851	71856	71743	71743	he	481	" See it where ? "
71857	71945	71722	71722	He	481	" On the tombs . Why not ? The Unknown Master of the Highgate Slope ! All the little , soft feminine hands , the nervous ugly males , the hands of the flops , and the hands of the snatchers ! And Grundy 's loose , lean , knuckly affair - Grundy the terror!-the little wrinkles and the thumb ! Only it ought to hold all the others together - in a slightly disturbing squeeze ....

74768	74825	74740	74740	her	485	" being myself . She allowed me to accumulate a store of ungracious and slovenly memories .... All our conceptions of life differed . I remember how we differed about furniture . We spent three or four days in Tottenham Court Road , and she chose the things she fancied with an inexorable resolution,-sweeping aside my suggestions with-"Oh
74833	75183	74827	74827	YOU	2524	" She pursued some limited , clearly seen and experienced ideal - that excluded all other possibilities . Over every mantel was a mirror that was draped , our sideboard was wonderfully good and splendid with beveled glass , we had lamps on long metal stalks and cozy corners and plants in grog - tubs . Smithie approved it all . There was n't a place where one could sit and read in the whole house . My books went upon shelves in the dining - room recess . And we had a piano though Marion 's playing was at an elementary level . You know , it was the cruelest luck for Marion that I , with my restlessness , my scepticism , my constantly developing ideas , had insisted on marriage with her . She had no faculty of growth or change ; she had taken her mould , she had set in the limited ideas of her peculiar class . She preserved her conception of what was right in drawing - room chairs and in marriage ceremonial and in every relation of life with a simple and luminous honesty and conviction , with an immense unimaginative inflexibility - as a tailor - bird builds its nest or a beaver makes its dam . Let me hasten over this history of disappointments and separation . I might tell of waxings and waning of love between us , but the whole was waning . Sometimes she would do things for me , make me a tie or a pair of slippers , and fill me with none the less gratitude because the things were absurd . She ran our home and our one servant with a hard , bright efficiency . She was inordinately proud of house and garden . Always , by her lights , she did her duty by me . Presently the rapid development of Tono - Bungay began to take me into the provinces , and I would be away sometimes for a week together . This she did not like ; it left her "
75186	75371	74827	74827	YOU	2524	" she said , but after a time she began to go to Smithie 's again and to develop an independence of me . At Smithie 's she was now a woman with a position ; she had money to spend . She would take Smithie to theatres and out to lunch and talk interminably of the business , and Smithie became a sort of permanent weekender with us . Also Marion got a spaniel and began to dabble with the minor arts , with poker - work and a Kodak and hyacinths in glasses . She called once on a neighbour . Her parents left Walham Green - her father severed his connection with the gas - works - and came to live in a small house I took for them near us , and they were much with us . Odd the littleness of the things that exasperate when the fountains of life are embittered ! My father - in - law was perpetually catching me in moody moments and urging me to take to gardening . He irritated me beyond measure . "
75377	75382	75372	75372	You	2525	" he would say . "
75417	75425	75415	75415	George	480	" Or in a torrent of exasperation , "
75457	75490	75447	75447	you	480	" And in the summer time he never came in without performing a sort of conjuring trick in the hall , and taking cucumbers and tomatoes from unexpected points of his person . "
75499	75705	75447	75447	you	480	" he 'd say in exemplary tones . He left a trail of vegetable produce in the most unusual places , on mantel boards , sideboards , the tops of pictures . Heavens ! how the sudden unexpected tomato could annoy me ! ... It did much to widen our estrangement that Marion and my aunt failed to make friends , became , by a sort of instinct , antagonistic . My aunt , to begin with , called rather frequently , for she was really anxious to know Marion . At first she would arrive like a whirlwind and pervade the house with an atmosphere of hello ! She dressed already with that cheerfully extravagant abandon that signalised her accession to fortune , and dressed her best for these visits . She wanted to play the mother to me , I fancy , to tell Marion occult secrets about the way I wore out my boots and how I never could think to put on thicker things in cold weather . But Marion received her with that defensive suspiciousness of the shy person , thinking only of the possible criticism of herself ; and my aunt , perceiving this , became nervous and slangy ... "
75712	75720	75706	75706	She	2528	" said Marion once , discussing her . "

75750	75853	75748	75748	she	2528	" The queer things my aunt said were nothing to the queer things she did n't say . I remember her in our drawing - room one day , and how she cocked her eye - it 's the only expression - at the India - rubber plant in a Doulton - ware pot which Marion had placed on the corner of the piano . She was on the very verge of speech . Then suddenly she caught my expression , and shrank up like a cat that has been discovered looking at the milk . Then a wicked impulse took her . "
75863	75877	75861	75861	George	480	" she insisted , looking me full in the eye . I smiled . "

75891	75929	75878	75878	You	2528	" as Marion came lowering into the room to welcome her . But I felt extraordinarily like a traitor - to the India - rubber plant , I suppose - for all that nothing had been said ... "
75937	75949	75930	75931	Your aunt	4606	" was Marion 's verdict , and , open - mindedly : "
75960	76388	75950	75950	I	0	" Several times we went to the house in Beckenham for lunch , and once or twice to dinner . My aunt did her peculiar best to be friends , but Marion was implacable . She was also , I know , intensely uncomfortable , and she adopted as her social method , an exhausting silence , replying compactly and without giving openings to anything that was said to her . The gaps between my aunt 's visits grew wider and wider . My married existence became at last like a narrow deep groove in the broad expanse of interests in which I was living . I went about the world ; I met a great number of varied personalities ; I read endless books in trains as I went to and fro . I developed social relationships at my uncle 's house that Marion did not share . The seeds of new ideas poured in upon me and grew in me . Those early and middle years of one 's third decade are , I suppose , for a man the years of greatest mental growth . They are restless years and full of vague enterprise . Each time I returned to Ealing , life there seemed more alien , narrow , and unattractive - and Marion less beautiful and more limited and difficult - until at last she was robbed of every particle of her magic . She gave me always a cooler welcome , I think , until she seemed entirely apathetic . I never asked myself then what heartaches she might hide or what her discontents might be . I would come home hoping nothing , expecting nothing . This was my fated life , and I had chosen it . I became more sensitive to the defects I had once disregarded altogether ; I began to associate her sallow complexion with her temperamental insufficiency , and the heavier lines of her mouth and nostril with her moods of discontent . We drifted apart ; wider and wider the gap opened . I tired of baby - talk and stereotyped little fondlings ; I tired of the latest intelligence from those wonderful workrooms , and showed it all too plainly ; we hardly spoke when we were alone together . The mere unreciprocated physical residue of my passion remained - an exasperation between us . No children came to save us . Marion had acquired at Smithie 's a disgust and dread of maternity . All that was the fruition and quintessence of the "
76390	77045	75930	75931	Your aunt	4606	" elements in life , a disgusting thing , a last indignity that overtook unwary women . I doubt indeed a little if children would have saved us ; we should have differed so fatally about their upbringing . Altogether , I remember my life with Marion as a long distress , now hard , now tender . It was in those days that I first became critical of my life and burdened with a sense of error and maladjustment . I would lie awake in the night , asking myself the purpose of things , reviewing my unsatisfying , ungainly home - life , my days spent in rascal enterprise and rubbish - selling , contrasting all I was being and doing with my adolescent ambitions , my Wimblehurst dreams . My circumstances had an air of finality , and I asked myself in vain why I had forced myself into them . The end of our intolerable situation came suddenly and unexpectedly , but in a way that I suppose was almost inevitable . My alienated affections wandered , and I was unfaithful to Marion . I wo n't pretend to extenuate the quality of my conduct . I was a young and fairly vigorous male ; all my appetite for love had been roused and whetted and none of it had been satisfied by my love affair and my marriage . I had pursued an elusive gleam of beauty to the disregard of all else , and it had failed me . It had faded when I had hoped it would grow brighter . I despaired of life and was embittered . And things happened as I am telling . I do n't draw any moral at all in the matter , and as for social remedies , I leave them to the social reformer . I 've got to a time of life when the only theories that interest me are generalisations about realities . To go to our inner office in Raggett Street I had to walk through a room in which the typists worked . They were the correspondence typists ; our books and invoicing had long since overflowed into the premises we had had the luck to secure on either side of us . I was , I must confess , always in a faintly cloudily - emotional way aware of that collection of for the most part round - shouldered femininity , but presently one of the girls detached herself from the others and got a real hold upon my attention . I appreciated her at first as a straight little back , a neater back than any of the others ; as a softly rounded neck with a smiling necklace of sham pearls ; as chestnut hair very neatly done - and as a side - long glance ; presently as a quickly turned face that looked for me . My eye would seek her as I went through on business things - I dictated some letters to her and so discovered she had pretty , soft - looking hands with pink nails . Once or twice , meeting casually , we looked one another for the flash of a second in the eyes . That was all . But it was enough in the mysterious free - masonry of sex to say essential things . We had a secret between us . One day I came into Raggett Street at lunch time and she was alone , sitting at her desk . She glanced up as I entered , and then became very still , with a downcast face and her hands clenched on the table . I walked right by her to the door of the inner office , stopped , came back and stood over her . We neither of us spoke for quite a perceptible time . I was trembling violently . "
77054	77170	77171	77171	We	2532	" I asked at last for the sake of speaking . She looked up at me without a word , with her face flushed and her eyes alight , and I bent down and kissed her lips . She leant back to put an arm about me , drew my face to her and kissed me again and again . I lifted her and held her in my arms . She gave a little smothered cry to feel herself so held . Never before had I known the quality of passionate kisses . Somebody became audible in the shop outside . We started back from one another with flushed faces and bright and burning eyes . "
77177	77185	77171	77171	We	2532	" I whispered with a confident intimacy . "
77193	77194	77188	77188	you	2533	" "
77202	77208	77188	77188	you	2533	" she answered as intimately . "
77217	77218	77188	77188	you	2533	" "
77225	77226	77188	77188	you	2533	" "
77234	77249	77250	77250	I	0	" The door from the shop opened , and she sat down very quickly . "
77254	77262	77188	77188	you	2533	" I said in a commonplace voice , "
77271	77620	77621	77621	You	2536	" I went into the inner office and routed out the paysheet in order to find her name - Effie Rink . And did no work at all that afternoon . I fretted about that dingy little den like a beast in a cage . When presently I went out , Effie was working with an extraordinary appearance of calm - and there was no look for me at all .... We met and had our talk that evening , a talk in whispers when there was none to overhear ; we came to an understanding . It was strangely unlike any dream of romance I had ever entertained . I came back after a week 's absence to my home again - a changed man . I had lived out my first rush of passion for Effie , had come to a contemplation of my position . I had gauged Effie 's place in the scheme of things , and parted from her for a time . She was back in her place at Raggett Street after a temporary indisposition . I did not feel in any way penitent or ashamed , I know , as I opened the little cast - iron gate that kept Marion 's front grader and Pampas Grass from the wandering dog . Indeed , if anything , I felt as if I had vindicated some right that had been in question . I came back to Marion with no sense of wrong - doing at all with , indeed , a new friendliness towards her . I do n't know how it may be proper to feel on such occasions ; that is how I felt . I followed her in our drawing - room , standing beside the tall lamp - stand that half filled the bay as though she had just turned from watching for me at the window . There was something in her pale face that arrested me . She looked as if she had not been sleeping . She did not come forward to greet me . "
77626	77630	77621	77621	You	2536	" she said . "
77637	77651	77632	77632	I	0	" She stood very still , a dusky figure against the bright window . "
77657	77661	77654	77654	you	2536	" she asked . "
77665	77676	77677	77677	I	0	" I said easily . She paused for a moment . "
77680	77699	77677	77677	I	0	" she said . I stared at her . It was the most amazing moment in any life .... "
77703	77709	77701	77701	Jove	476	" I said at last , "
77715	77716	77712	77712	you	0	" "
77725	77741	77719	77719	you	0	" I walked to the hearthrug and stood quite still there regarding this new situation . "
77747	77751	77742	77742	I	0	" she began . "
77760	77774	77754	77754	you	2536	" It seemed a long interval before either of us spoke another word . "
77780	77786	77787	77787	Smithie	488	" I asked at last . "
77796	77797	77791	77791	They	5397	" "
77803	77804	77807	77807	you	2536	" "
77810	77823	77807	77807	you	2536	" I felt a spasm of petulant annoyance at this unexpected catastrophe . "
77835	77849	77850	77850	You	2536	" I said .... Marion spoke in dry , broken fragments of sentences . "
77874	77875	77866	77867	all men	2541	" "
77900	77933	77954	77954	You	2536	" I became aware of some one moving about in the passage , and went and shut the door of the room , then I walked back to the hearthrug and turned . "
77940	77944	77954	77954	You	2536	" I said . "
77975	77984	77972	77972	you	2536	" She sat down in a draped armchair . "
77991	78000	77985	77985	I	0	" she said . I shrugged my shoulders . "
78004	78008	78001	78001	I	0	" she said , "
78014	78020	78009	78009	SHE	2543	" I had no answer . "
78026	78027	78009	78009	SHE	2543	" "
78181	78201	78169	78169	I	0	" She scrutinised my face , and pulled at the ball - fringe of the little table beside her . "
78207	78211	78169	78169	I	0	" she said . "
78223	78347	78212	78212	I	0	" We kept a long silence . I was only beginning to realise in the most superficial way the immense catastrophe that had happened between us . Enormous issues had rushed upon us . I felt unprepared and altogether inadequate . I was unreasonably angry . There came a rush of stupid expressions to my mind that my rising sense of the supreme importance of the moment saved me from saying . The gap of silence widened until it threatened to become the vast memorable margin of some one among a thousand trivial possibilities of speech that would vex our relations for ever . Our little general servant tapped at the door - Marion always liked the servant to tap - and appeared . "
78352	78364	78350	78350	M'm	534	" she said - and vanished , leaving the door open . "
78370	78377	78378	78378	I	0	" said I , and stopped . "
78382	78386	78378	78378	I	0	" I repeated , "
78396	78407	78378	78378	I	0	" We remained motionless and silent for a few seconds . "
78418	78502	78408	78408	Mother	444	" Marion remarked at last , and dropped the worried end of ball - fringe and stood up slowly .... And so , with this immense discussion of our changed relations hanging over us , we presently had tea with the unsuspecting Mrs. Ramboat and the spaniel . Mrs. Ramboat was too well trained in her position to remark upon our somber preoccupation . She kept a thin trickle of talk going , and told us , I remember , that Mr. Ramboat was "
78504	78509	78510	78510	They	2550	" about his cannas . "
78547	78974	78540	78540	he	2551	" The spaniel was a great bore , begging and doing small tricks first at one and then at the other of us . Neither of us used his name . You see we had called him Miggles , and made a sort of trio in the baby - talk of Mutney and Miggles and Ming . Then presently we resumed our monstrous , momentous dialogue . I ca n't now make out how long that dialogue went on . It spread itself , I know , in heavy fragments over either three days or four . I remember myself grouped with Marion , talking sitting on our bed in her room , talking standing in our dining - room , saving this thing or that . Twice we went for long walks . And we had a long evening alone together , with jaded nerves and hearts that fluctuated between a hard and dreary recognition of facts and , on my part at least , a strange unwonted tenderness ; because in some extraordinary way this crisis had destroyed our mutual apathy and made us feel one another again . It was a dialogue that had discrepant parts that fell into lumps of talk that failed to join on to their predecessors , that began again at a different level , higher or lower , that assumed new aspects in the intervals and assimilated new considerations . We discussed the fact that we two were no longer lovers ; never before had we faced that . It seems a strange thing to write , but as I look back , I see clearly that those several days were the time when Marion and I were closest together , looked for the first and last time faithfully and steadfastly into each other 's soul . For those days only , there were no pretences , I made no concessions to her nor she to me ; we concealed nothing , exaggerated nothing . We had done with pretending . We had it out plainly and soberly with each other . Mood followed mood and got its stark expression . Of course there was quarreling between us , bitter quarreling , and we said things to one another - long pent - up things that bruised and crushed and cut . But over it all in my memory now is an effect of deliberate confrontation , and the figure of Marion stands up , pale , melancholy , tear - stained , injured , implacable and dignified . "
78979	79000	78975	78975	You	2552	" she asked once , and jerked that doubt into my mind . I struggled with tangled ideas and emotions . "
79029	79030	79032	79032	you	2552	" "
79047	79048	79042	79042	you	2552	" "
79051	79055	79042	79042	you	2552	" I reflected . "
79063	79064	79058	79058	her	2553	" "
79074	79075	79070	79070	I	0	" "
79083	79084	79078	79078	you	2552	" "
79095	79096	79090	79090	you	2552	" "
79099	79112	79090	79090	you	2552	" I said with the exasperation of the situation growing upon me . "
79121	79272	79115	79115	you	2552	" As I look back upon all that time - across a gulf of fifteen active years - I find I see it with an understanding judgment . I see it as if it were the business of some one else - indeed of two other people - intimately known yet judged without passion . I see now that this shock , this sudden immense disillusionment , did in real fact bring out a mind and soul in Marion ; that for the first time she emerged from habits , timidities , imitations , phrases and a certain narrow will - impulse , and became a personality . Her ruling motive at first was , I think , an indignant and outraged pride . This situation must end . She asked me categorically to give up Effie , and I , full of fresh and glowing memories , absolutely refused . "
79280	79284	79278	79278	Marion	485	" I said . "
79293	79294	79278	79278	Marion	485	" "
79306	79310	79312	79312	we	2554	" she said . "
79314	79315	79312	79312	we	2554	" "
79319	79322	79312	79312	we	2554	" I deliberated "
79330	79331	79335	79335	we	2554	" "
79337	79338	79335	79335	we	2554	" "

79377	79393	79374	79374	you	485	" Slowly we worked our way from point to point , until at last the word "
79395	79400	79374	79374	you	485	" was before us . "
79413	79417	79418	79418	I	0	" said Marion . "
79426	79428	79429	79429	you	485	" I said-"if
79473	79507	79508	79508	We	2554	" We began to talk ourselves into a realisation of what our divergent futures might be . I came back on the evening of that day with my questions answered by a solicitor . "
79517	79521	79508	79508	We	2554	" I said , "
79729	79730	79721	79721	you	2557	" "
79744	79745	79721	79721	you	2557	" "

79817	79818	79813	79815	Both of us	2562	" "
79826	79837	79823	79823	you	2557	" I looked up at her wrung and bitter face . "
79844	79859	79861	79861	you	2557	" I lied , my voice near breaking with the pain of it all . "
79863	80026	79861	79861	you	2557	" The perplexing thing about life is the irresolvable complexity of reality , of things and relations alike . Nothing is simple . Every wrong done has a certain justice in it , and every good deed has dregs of evil . As for us , young still , and still without self - knowledge , resounded a hundred discordant notes in the harsh angle of that shock . We were furiously angry with each other , tender with each other , callously selfish , generously self - sacrificing . I remember Marion saying innumerable detached things that did n't hang together one with another , that contradicted one another , that were , nevertheless , all in their places profoundly true and sincere . I see them now as so many vain experiments in her effort to apprehend the crumpled confusions of our complex moral landslide . Some I found irritating beyond measure . I answered her - sometimes quite abominably . "
80030	80038	80101	80101	I	0	" she would say again and again , "
80046	80047	80048	80048	I	0	" "

80208	80235	80202	80202	you	0	" There were times when she seemed to regard our separation with absolute complacency , when she would plan all sorts of freedoms and characteristic interests . "
80245	80273	80236	80236	I	0	" she said . And once she said an ugly thing that I did indeed hate her for that I can not even now quite forgive her . "
80288	80357	80282	80282	She	4606	" Into my memory of these pains and stresses comes the figure of Smithie , full - charged with emotion , so breathless in the presence of the horrid villain of the piece that she could make no articulate sounds . She had long tearful confidences with Marion , I know , sympathetic close clingings . There were moments when only absolute speechlessness prevented her giving me a stupendous "
80360	80563	80282	80282	She	4606	to"-I could see it in her eye . The wrong things she would have said ! And I recall , too , Mrs. Ramboat 's slow awakening to something in , the air , the growing expression of solicitude in her eye , only her well - trained fear of Marion keeping her from speech . And at last through all this welter , like a thing fated and altogether beyond our control , parting came to Marion and me . I hardened my heart , or I could not have gone . For at the last it came to Marion that she was parting from me for ever . That overbore all other things , had turned our last hour to anguish . She forgot for a time the prospect of moving into a new house , she forgot the outrage on her proprietorship and pride . For the first time in her life she really showed strong emotions in regard to me , for the first time , perhaps , they really came to her . She began to weep slow , reluctant tears . I came into her room , and found her asprawl on the bed , weeping . "
80569	80573	80564	80564	I	0	" she cried . "

91303	91315	91276	91276	Minerals	564	" said my uncle softly , with his glasses very oblique . "

91547	91787	91531	91531	You	5447	" ... His blue eye smiled at me and scrutinised me . He smoked and was fragmentary for a time , fending off my questions ; then his story began to piece itself together . He conjured up a vision of this strange forgotten kink in the world 's littoral , of the long meandering channels that spread and divaricate and spend their burden of mud and silt within the thunderbelt of Atlantic surf , of the dense tangled vegetation that creeps into the shimmering water with root and sucker . He gave a sense of heat and a perpetual reek of vegetable decay , and told how at last comes a break among these things , an arena fringed with bone - white dead trees , a sight of the hard - blue sea line beyond the dazzling surf and a wide desolation of dirty shingle and mud , bleached and scarred .... A little way off among charred dead weeds stands the abandoned station,-abandoned because every man who stayed two months at that station stayed to die , eaten up mysteriously like a leper with its dismantled sheds and its decaying pier of wormrotten and oblique piles and planks , still insecurely possible . And in the midst , two clumsy heaps shaped like the backs of hogs , one small , one great , sticking out under a rib of rock that cuts the space across,-quap ! "
91792	91798	91531	91531	You	5447	" said Gordon - Nasmyth , "

91954	91964	91965	91965	They	2949	" We went into the particulars of that difficulty . "
91982	91988	91965	91965	They	2949	" said Gordon - Nasmyth ; "
91995	91996	91965	91965	They	2949	" "
92003	92468	91999	91999	you	5447	" said my uncle . I am inclined to think Gordon - Nasmyth imagined we would give him a cheque for six thousand pounds on the strength of his talk . It was very good talk , but we did n't do that . I stipulated for samples of his stuff for analysis , and he consented - reluctantly . I think , on the whole , he would rather I did n't examine samples . He made a motion pocketwards , that gave us an invincible persuasion that he had a sample upon him , and that at the last instant he decided not to produce it prematurely . There was evidently a curious strain of secretiveness in him . He did n't like to give us samples , and he would n't indicate within three hundred miles the position of this Mordet Island of his . He had it clear in his mind that he had a secret of immense value , and he had no idea at all of just how far he ought to go with business people . And so presently , to gain time for these hesitations of his , he began to talk of other things . He talked very well . He talked of the Dutch East Indies and of the Congo , of Portuguese East Africa and Paraguay , of Malays and rich Chinese merchants , Dyaks and negroes and the spread of the Mahometan world in Africa to - day . And all this time he was trying to judge if we were good enough to trust with his adventure . Our cosy inner office became a little place , and all our business cold and lifeless exploits beside his glimpses of strange minglings of men , of slayings unavenged and curious customs , of trade where no writs run , and the dark treacheries of eastern ports and uncharted channels . We had neither of us gone abroad except for a few vulgar raids on Paris ; our world was England , are the places of origin of half the raw material of the goods we sold had seemed to us as remote as fairyland or the forest of Arden . But Gordon - Nasmyth made it so real and intimate for us that afternoon - for me , at any rate - that it seemed like something seen and forgotten and now again remembered . And in the end he produced his sample , a little lump of muddy clay speckled with brownish grains , in a glass bottle wrapped about with lead and flannel - red flannel it was , I remember - a hue which is , I know , popularly supposed to double all the mystical efficacies of flannel . "
92477	92483	91999	91999	you	5447	" said Gordon - Nasmyth . "
92489	92566	91999	91999	you	5447	" I took the stuff to Thorold , and Thorold had the exquisite agony of discovering two new elements in what was then a confidential analysis . He has christened them and published since , but at the time Gordon - Nasmyth would n't hear for a moment of our publication of any facts at all ; indeed , he flew into a violent passion and abused me mercilessly even for showing the stuff to Thorold . "
92577	92880	92567	92567	I	0	" he said with the touching persuasion of the layman that a scientific man knows and practises at the sciences . I made some commercial inquiries , and there seemed even then much truth in Gordon - Nasmyth 's estimate of the value of the stuff . It was before the days of Capern 's discovery of the value of canadium and his use of it in the Capern filament , but the cerium and thorium alone were worth the money he extracted for the gas - mantles then in vogue . There were , however , doubts . Indeed , there were numerous doubts . What were the limits of the gas - mantle trade ? How much thorium , not to speak of cerium , could they take at a maximum . Suppose that quantity was high enough to justify our shipload , came doubts in another quarter . Were the heaps up to sample ? Were they as big as he said ? Was Gordon - Nasmyth - imaginative ? And if these values held , could we after all get the stuff ? It was n't ours . It was on forbidden ground . You see , there were doubts of every grade and class in the way of this adventure . We went some way , nevertheless , in the discussion of his project , though I think we tried his patience . Then suddenly he vanished from London , and I saw no more of him for a year and a half . My uncle said that was what he had expected , and when at last Gordon - Nasmyth reappeared and mentioned in an incidental way that he had been to Paraguay on private ( and we guessed passionate ) affairs , the business of the "
92882	93761	91999	91999	you	5447	" expedition had to be begun again at the beginning . My uncle was disposed to be altogether sceptical , but I was n't so decided . I think I was drawn by its picturesque aspects . But we neither of us dreamt of touching it seriously until Capern 's discovery . Nasmyth 's story had laid hold of my imagination like one small , intense picture of tropical sunshine hung on a wall of grey business affairs . I kept it going during Gordon - Nasmyth 's intermittent appearances in England . Every now and then he and I would meet and reinforce its effect . We would lunch in London , or he would cone to see my gliders at Crest Hill , and make new projects for getting at those heaps again now with me , now alone . At times they became a sort of fairy - story with us , an imaginative exercise . And there came Capern 's discovery of what he called the ideal filament and with it an altogether less problematical quality about the business side of quap . For the ideal filament needed five per cent . of canadium , and canadium was known to the world only as a newly separated constituent of a variety of the rare mineral rutile . But to Thorold it was better known as an element in a mysterious sample brought to him by me , and to me it was known as one of the elements in quap . I told my uncle , and we jumped on to the process at once . We found that Gordon - Nasmyth , still unaware of the altered value of the stuff , and still thinking of the experimental prices of radium and the rarity value of cerium , had got hold of a cousin named Pollack , made some extraordinary transaction about his life insurance policy , and was buying a brig . We put in , put down three thousand pounds , and forthwith the life insurance transaction and the Pollack side of this finance vanished into thin air , leaving Pollack , I regret to say , in the brig and in the secret - except so far as canadium and the filament went - as residuum . We discussed earnestly whether we should charter a steamer or go on with the brig , but we decided on the brig as a less conspicuous instrument for an enterprise that was after all , to put it plainly , stealing . But that was one of our last enterprises before our great crisis , and I will tell of it in its place . So it was quap came into our affairs , came in as a fairy - tale and became real . More and more real it grew until at last it was real , until at last I saw with my eyes the heaps my imagination had seen for so long , and felt between my fingers again that half - gritty , half soft texture of quap , like sanded moist - sugar mixed with clay in which there stirs something- One must feel it to understand . All sorts of things came to the Hardingham and offered themselves to my uncle . Gordon - Nasmyth stands but only because he played a part at last in the crisis of our fortunes . So much came to us that it seemed to me at times as though the whole world of human affairs was ready to prostitute itself to our real and imaginary millions . As I look back , I am still dazzled and incredulous to think of the quality of our opportunities . We did the most extraordinary things ; things that it seems absurd to me to leave to any casual man of wealth and enterprise who cares to do them . I had some amazing perceptions of just how modern thought and the supply of fact to the general mind may be controlled by money . Among other things that my uncle offered for , he tried very hard to buy the British Medical Journal and the Lancet , and run them on what he called modern lines , and when they resisted him he talked very vigorously for a time of organising a rival enterprise . That was a very magnificent idea indeed in its way ; it would have given a tremendous advantage in the handling of innumerable specialties and indeed I scarcely know how far it would not have put the medical profession in our grip . It still amazes me - I shall die amazed - that such a thing can be possible in the modern state . If my uncle failed to bring the thing off , some one else may succeed . But I doubt , even if he had got both these weeklies , whether his peculiar style would have suited them . The change of purpose would have shown . He would have found it difficult to keep up their dignity . He certainly did not keep up the dignity of the Sacred Grove , an important critical organ which he acquired one day - by saying "
93762	93770	92567	92567	I	0	snap"-for eight hundred pounds . He got it "
93775	93845	91999	91999	you	5447	barrel"-under one or other of which three aspects the editor was included . Even at that price it did n't pay . If you are a literary person you will remember the bright new cover he gave that representative organ of British intellectual culture , and how his sound business instincts jarred with the exalted pretensions of a vanishing age . One old wrapper I discovered the other day runs:- "

These are ideal conceptions of mine . As a matter of fact , nothing would be more entirely natural and representative of the relations of learning , thought and the economic situation in the world at the present time than this cover of the Sacred Grove - the quiet conservatism of the one element embedded in the aggressive brilliance of the other ; the contrasted notes of bold physiological experiment and extreme mental immobility . There comes back , too , among these Hardingham memories , an impression of a drizzling November day , and how we looked out of the windows upon a procession of the London unemployed . It was like looking down a well into some momentarily revealed nether world . Some thousands of needy ineffectual men had been raked together to trail their spiritless misery through the West Eire with an appeal that was also in its way a weak and insubstantial threat : "
94255	94298	91999	91999	you	5447	" There they were , half - phantom through the fog , a silent , foot - dragging , interminable , grey procession . They carried wet , dirty banners , they rattled boxes for pence ; these men who had not said "

And we stood high out of it all , as high as if we looked godlike from another world , standing in a room beautifully lit and furnished , skillfully warmed , filled with costly things . "

94418	94896	94415	94416	Edward Ponderevo	351	" But my uncle 's thoughts ran in a different channel , and he made that vision the test of a spirited but inconclusive harangue upon Tariff Reform . So far my history of my aunt and uncle has dealt chiefly with his industrial and financial exploits . But side by side with that history of inflation from the infinitesimal to the immense is another development , the change year by year from the shabby impecuniosity of the Camden Town lodging to the lavish munificence of the Crest Hill marble staircase and my aunt 's golden bed , the bed that was facsimiled from Fontainebleau . And the odd thing is that as I come to this nearer part of my story I find it much more difficult to tell than the clear little perspective memories of the earlier days . Impressions crowd upon one another and overlap one another ; I was presently to fall in love again , to be seized by a passion to which I still faintly respond , a passion that still clouds my mind . I came and went between Ealing and my aunt and uncle , and presently between Effie and clubland , and then between business and a life of research that became far more continuous , infinitely more consecutive and memorable than any of these other sets of experiences . I did n't witness a regular social progress therefore ; my aunt and uncle went up in the world , so far as I was concerned , as if they were displayed by an early cinematograph , with little jumps and flickers . As I recall this side of our life , the figure of my round - eyes , button - nosed , pink - and - white Aunt Susan tends always to the central position . We drove the car and sustained the car , she sat in it with a magnificent variety of headgear poised upon her delicate neck , and always with that faint ghost of a lisp no misspelling can render - commented on and illuminated the new aspects . I 've already sketched the little home behind the Wimblehurst chemist 's shop , the lodging near the Cobden statue , and the apartments in Gower Street . Thence my aunt and uncle went into a flat in Redgauntlet Mansions . There they lived when I married . It was a compact flat , with very little for a woman to do in it In those days my aunt , I think , used to find the time heavy upon her hands , and so she took to books and reading , and after a time even to going to lectures in the afternoon . I began to find unexpected books upon her table : sociological books , travels , Shaw 's plays . "
94899	94913	94415	94416	Edward Ponderevo	351	" I said , at the sight of some volume of the latter . "
94922	94926	94927	94927	Eh	2952	" she explained . "
94929	94930	94927	94927	Eh	2952	" "
95004	95024	94998	94998	You	480	" ... And I remember her coming in late one evening with a note - book in her hand . "
95031	95036	95029	95029	Susan	433	" said my uncle . "
95046	95056	95041	95041	I	0	" She sat down and took off her gloves . "
95064	95077	95078	95078	You	480	" she sighed , and then in a note of grave reproach : "
95095	95313	95314	95316	Pestilential old Splosher	577	" Presently they were setting ; up the house at Beckengham , and my aunt intermitted her intellectual activities . The house at Beckengham was something of an enterprise for them at that time , a reasonably large place by the standards of the early years of Tono - Bungay . It was a big , rather gaunt villa , with a conservatory and a shrubbery , a tennis - lawn , a quite considerable vegetable garden , and a small disused coach - house . I had some glimpses of the excitements of its inauguration , but not many because of the estrangement between my aunt and Marion . My aunt went into that house with considerable zest , and my uncle distinguished himself by the thoroughness with which he did the repainting and replumbing . He had all the drains up and most of the garden with them , and stood administrative on heaps - administrating whisky to the workmen . I found him there one day , most Napoleonic , on a little Elba of dirt , in an atmosphere that defies print . He also , I remember , chose what he considered cheerful contrasts of colours for the painting of the woodwork . This exasperated my aunt extremely - she called him a "
95317	95370	95371	95372	Martin Luther	581	" with an unusual note of earnestness - and he also enraged her into novelties of abuse by giving each bedroom the name of some favourite hero - Cliff , Napoleon , Caesar , and so forth - and having it painted on the door in gilt letters on a black label . "
95373	95393	95394	95395	Old Pondo	582	" was kept for me . Only her respect for domestic discipline , she said , prevented her retaliating with "
95396	95567	95717	95718	Old Trek	584	" on the housemaid 's cupboard . Also he went and ordered one of the completest sets of garden requisites I have ever seen - and had them all painted a hard clear blue . My aunt got herself large tins of a kindlier hued enamel and had everything secretly recoated , and this done , she found great joy in the garden and became an ardent rose grower and herbaceous borderer , leaving her Mind , indeed , to damp evenings and the winter months . When I think of her at Beckenham , I always think first of her as dressed in that blue cotton stuff she affected , with her arms in huge gauntleted gardening gloves , a trowel in one hand and a small but no doubt hardy and promising annual , limp and very young - looking and sheepish , in the other . Beckenham , in the persons of a vicar , a doctor 's wife , and a large proud lady called Hogberry , "
95569	95716	95717	95718	Old Trek	584	" on my uncle and aunt almost at once , so soon in fact as the lawn was down again , and afterwards my aunt made friends with a quiet gentlewoman next door , a propos of an overhanging cherry tree and the need of repairing the party fence . So she resumed her place in society from which she had fallen with the disaster of Wimblehurst . She made a partially facetious study of the etiquette of her position , had cards engraved and retaliated calls . And then she received a card for one of Mrs. Hogberry 's At Homes , gave an old garden party herself , participated in a bazaar and sale of work , and was really becoming quite cheerfully entangled in Beckenham society when she was suddenly taken up by the roots again by my uncle and transplanted to Chiselhurst . "
95722	95727	95720	95720	George	480	" she said compactly , "
95732	95746	95720	95720	George	480	" when I found her superintending the loading of two big furniture vans . "
95773	96316	95766	95766	you	480	" I look into the jumbled stores of the middle distance of memory , and Beckenham seems to me a quite transitory phase . But really they were there several years ; through nearly all my married life , in fact , and far longer than the year and odd months we lived together at Wimblehurst . But the Wimblehurst time with them is fuller in my memory by far then the Beckenham period . There comes back to me with a quite considerable amount of detail the effect of that garden party of my aunt 's and of a little social misbehaviour of which I was guilty on that occasion . It 's like a scrap from another life . It 's all set in what is for me a kind of cutaneous feeling , the feeling of rather ill - cut city clothes , frock coat and grey trousers , and of a high collar and tie worn in sunshine among flowers . I have still a quite vivid memory of the little trapezoidal lawn , of the gathering , and particularly of the hats and feathers of the gathering , of the parlour - maid and the blue tea - cups , and of the magnificent presence of Mrs. Hogberry and of her clear , resonant voice . It was a voice that would have gone with a garden party on a larger scale ; it went into adjacent premises ; it included the gardener who was far up the vegetable patch and technically out of play . The only other men were my aunt 's doctor , two of the clergy , amiable contrasted men , and Mrs. Hogberry 's imperfectly grown - up son , a youth just bursting into collar . The rest were women , except for a young girl or so in a state of speechless good behaviour . Marion also was there . Marion and I had arrived a little estranged , and I remember her as a silent presence , a shadow across all that sunlit emptiness of intercourse . We had embittered each other with one of those miserable little disputes that seemed so unavoidable between us . She had , with the help of Smithie , dressed rather elaborately for the occasion , and when she saw me prepared to accompany her in , I think it was a grey suit , she protested that silk hat and frock coat were imperative . I was recalcitrant , she quoted an illustrated paper showing a garden party with the King present , and finally I capitulated - but after my evil habit , resentfully .... Eh , dear ! those old quarrels , how pitiful they were , how trivial ! And how sorrowful they are to recall ! I think they grow more sorrowful as I grow older , and all the small passionate reasons for our mutual anger fade and fade out of memory . The impression that Beckenham company has left on my mind is one of a modest unreality ; they were all maintaining a front of unspecified social pretension , and evading the display of the economic facts of the case . Most of the husbands were "
96319	96458	95766	95766	you	480	" off stage , it would have been outrageous to ask what the business was - and the wives were giving their energies to produce , with the assistance of novels and the illustrated magazines , a moralised version of the afternoon life of the aristocratic class . They had n't the intellectual or moral enterprise of the upper - class woman , they had no political interests , they had no views about anything , and consequently they were , I remember , extremely difficult to talk to . They all sat about in the summer - house and in garden - chairs , and were very hatty and ruffley and sunshady . Three ladies and the curate played croquet with a general immense gravity , broken by occasional loud cries of feigned distress from the curate . "
96468	96503	95766	95766	you	480	" The dominant social fact that afternoon was Mrs. Hogberry ; she took up a certain position commanding the croquet and went on , as my aunt said to me in an incidental aside , "
96509	96564	95766	95766	you	480	" She talked of the way in which Beckenham society was getting mixed , and turned on to a touching letter she had recently received from her former nurse at Little Gossdean . Followed a loud account of Little Gossdean and how much she and her eight sisters had been looked up to there . "
96575	96579	96570	96573	a little Queen there	2957	" she said . "
96657	96784	96643	96644	Mr. Bugshoot	587	" ... Dim memories of Mrs. Mackridge floated through my mind as I listened to her .... I was whirled on this roundabout for a bit , and then had the fortune to fall off into a tete - a - tete with a lady whom my aunt introduced as Mrs. Mumble - but then she introduced everybody to me as Mumble that afternoon , either by way of humour or necessity . That must have been one of my earliest essays in the art of polite conversation , and I remember that I began by criticising the local railway service , and that at the third sentence or thereabouts Mrs. Mumble said in a distinctly bright and encouraging way that she feared I was a very "
96786	96799	96640	96640	I	0	" person . I wonder now what it was I said that was "
96802	96854	96640	96640	I	0	" I do n't know what happened to end that conversation , or if it had an end . I remember talking to one of the clergy for a time rather awkwardly , and being given a sort of topographical history of Beckenham , which he assured me time after time was "
96865	96900	96901	96901	George	480	" As though I had treated it as new and he meant to be very patient but very convincing . Then we hung up in a distinct pause , and my aunt rescued me . "
96903	96911	96901	96901	George	480	" she said in a confidential undertone , "
96919	96924	96925	96925	I	0	" And then audibly , "
96939	96940	96925	96925	I	0	" "
96952	96965	96949	96950	Mrs. Ponderevo	418	" said the clergyman , becoming fearfully expert and in his elements ; "
96970	97002	96949	96950	Mrs. Ponderevo	418	" I found we were near a rustic table , and that the housemaid was behind us in a suitable position to catch us on the rebound with the tea things . "
97005	97015	96949	96950	Mrs. Ponderevo	418	" repeated the clergyman to me , much amused ; "
97019	97040	96949	96950	Mrs. Ponderevo	418	" And I just saved him from the tray as he turned about . We handed tea for a while .... "
97045	97057	97063	97063	George	480	" said my aunt , flushed , but well in hand . "
97084	97100	97101	97101	They	2970	" She surveyed the gathering with a predominant blue eye and helped herself to tea . "
97107	97114	97115	97115	I	0	" she said in an undertone .... "
97121	97122	97118	97118	my	0	" "
97130	97135	97136	97137	That boy	4425	" I said encouragingly . "
97185	97234	97235	97235	I	0	" Happily she did n't . I got myself involved with the gentlewoman from next door , a pensive , languid - looking little woman with a low voice , and fell talking ; our topic , Cats and Dogs , and which it was we liked best . "
97239	97246	97235	97235	I	0	" said the pensive little woman , "
97262	97263	97172	97172	George	480	" "
97266	97275	97172	97172	George	480	" I found myself admitting with great enthusiasm , "

97305	97306	97360	97360	you	0	" "

97390	97417	97360	97360	you	0	" A long pause . The thing seemed to me to amount to a stale - mate . Fear came into my heart and much perplexity . "
97424	97435	97360	97360	you	0	" I said . I felt like a drowning man . "
97449	97450	97360	97360	you	0	" "
97455	97460	97360	97360	you	0	" she agreed gently . "

97484	97489	97471	97471	I	0	" I said helpfully . "
97492	97496	97471	97471	I	0	" she said , "
97503	97504	97505	97507	So few people	2972	" "
97511	97515	97505	97507	So few people	2972	" I said ; "
97521	97530	97505	97507	So few people	2972	" She sighed and said again very softly , "
97533	97576	97505	97507	So few people	2972	" ... There was another long pause . I looked at her and she was thinking dreamily . The drowning sensation returned , the fear and enfeeblement . I perceived by a sort of inspiration that her tea - cup was empty . "
97583	97819	97578	97578	me	0	" I said abruptly , and , that secured , made for the table by the summer - house . I had no intention then of deserting my aunt . But close at hand the big French window of the drawing - room yawned inviting and suggestive . I can feel all that temptation now , and particularly the provocation of my collar . In an instant I was lost . I would - Just for a moment ! I dashed in , put down the cup on the keys of the grand piano and fled upstairs , softly , swiftly , three steps at a time , to the sanctuary of my uncle 's study , his snuggery . I arrived there breathless , convinced there was no return for me . I was very glad and ashamed of myself , and desperate . By means of a penknife I contrived to break open his cabinet of cigars , drew a chair to the window , took off my coat , collar and tie , and remained smoking guiltily and rebelliously , and peeping through the blind at the assembly on the lawn until it was altogether gone .... The clergymen , I thought , were wonderful . A few such pictures of those early days at Beckenham stand out , and then I find myself among the Chiselhurst memories . The Chiselhurst mansion had "
97821	98000	98045	98045	he	592	" rather than a mere garden , and there was a gardener 's cottage and a little lodge at the gate . The ascendant movement was always far more in evidence there than at Beckenham . The velocity was increasing . One night picks itself out as typical , as , in its way , marking an epoch . I was there , I think , about some advertisement stuff , on some sort of business anyhow , and my uncle and aunt had come back in a fly from a dinner at the Runcorns . ( Even there he was nibbling at Runcorn with the idea of our great Amalgamation budding in his mind . ) I got down there , I suppose , about eleven . I found the two of them sitting in the study , my aunt on a chair - arm with a whimsical pensiveness on her face , regarding my uncle , and he , much extended and very rotund , in the low arm - chair drawn up to the fender . "
98006	98016	98017	98017	I	0	" said my uncle , after my first greetings . "
98028	98029	98025	98026	Oh Fay	591	" "

98201	98206	98207	98207	we	2973	" said my uncle , "

98279	98284	98285	98286	Old Bladder	593	" said my aunt . "

98299	98328	98290	98290	Nobody	1152	" said my uncle , glancing at his contours and suddenly sitting up . My aunt raised her eyebrows slightly , swung her foot , and said nothing . "
98442	98451	98452	98452	Runcorn	550	" I handed him the cigar - box . "
98459	98467	98468	98468	We	2973	" he said , truncating one lovingly . "
98481	98493	98474	98474	We	2973	" My aunt and I regarded him , full of apprehensions . "
98498	98520	98494	98494	I	0	" he said darkly to the cigar , deepening our dread . He pocketed his cigar - cutter and spoke again . "
98629	98630	98623	98623	YOU	2986	" "
98643	98648	98623	98623	YOU	2986	" said my aunt . "
98654	98670	98623	98623	YOU	2986	" She shrugged her shoulders . I had never seen my uncle so immensely serious . "
98679	98687	98623	98623	YOU	2986	" he went on to the fire . "
98729	98730	98721	98721	It	2988	" "
98733	98737	98721	98721	It	2988	" I said . "
98744	98745	98748	98748	George	480	" "
98750	98755	98748	98748	George	480	" said my aunt . "
98769	98770	98762	98762	I	0	" "
98812	98831	98803	98803	We	2990	" He mumbled his cigar and smoked for a space , leaning forward and looking into the fire . "
98836	98840	98803	98803	We	2990	" he asked , "
98885	98910	98803	98803	We	2990	" He was silent again , and the cigar crept up from the horizontal towards the zenith as the confidence of his mouth increased . "
98921	98929	98932	98932	Susan	433	" he said , becoming more cheerful . "
98962	98963	98938	98938	George	480	" "
98969	98973	98938	98938	George	480	" I said . "
99003	99004	99005	99005	We	2990	" "
99011	99016	99005	99005	We	2990	" said my aunt , "
99019	99020	99005	99005	We	2990	" "
99028	99033	99005	99005	We	2990	" said my uncle . "
99161	99162	99165	99165	you	480	" "
99172	99377	99165	99165	you	480	" he insisted . What I said I thought of it I do n't now recall . Only I have very distinctly the impression of meeting for a moment my aunt 's impenetrable eye . And anyhow he started in with his accustomed energy to rape the mysteries of the Costly Life , and become the calmest of its lords . On the whole , I think he did it - thoroughly . I have crowded memories , a little difficult to disentangle , of his experimental stages , his experimental proceedings . It 's hard at times to say which memory comes in front of which . I recall him as presenting on the whole a series of small surprises , as being again and again , unexpectedly , a little more self - confident , a little more polished , a little richer and finer , a little more aware of the positions and values of things and men . There was a time - it must have been very early - when I saw him deeply impressed by the splendours of the dining - room of the National Liberal Club . Heaven knows who our host was or what that particular little "
99379	99463	99165	99165	you	480	" was about now!-all that sticks is the impression of our straggling entry , a string of six or seven guests , and my uncle looking about him at the numerous bright red - shaded tables , at the exotics in great Majolica jars , at the shining ceramic columns and pilasters , at the impressive portraits of Liberal statesmen and heroes , and all that contributes to the ensemble of that palatial spectacle . He was betrayed into a whisper to me , "
99471	99684	99469	99469	George	480	" he said . That artless comment seems almost incredible as I set it down ; there came a time so speedily when not even the clubs of New York could have overawed my uncle , and when he could walk through the bowing magnificence of the Royal Grand Hotel to his chosen table in that aggressively exquisite gallery upon the river , with all the easy calm of one of earth 's legitimate kings . The two of them learnt the new game rapidly and well ; they experimented abroad , they experimented at home . At Chiselhurst , with the aid of a new , very costly , but highly instructive cook , they tried over everything they heard of that roused their curiosity and had any reputation for difficulty , from asparagus to plover 's eggs . They afterwards got a gardener who could wait at table - and he brought the soil home to one . Then there came a butler . I remember my aunt 's first dinner - gown very brightly , and how she stood before the fire in the drawing - room confessing once unsuspected pretty arms with all the courage she possessed , and looking over her shoulder at herself in a mirror . "
99688	99693	99469	99469	George	480	" she remarked reflectively , "
99703	99741	99469	99469	George	480	" ... I attempted , I think , some commonplace compliment . My uncle appeared at the door in a white waistcoat and with his hands in his trouser pockets ; he halted and surveyed her critically . "
99752	99756	99750	99750	Susan	433	" he remarked . "
99795	100083	100085	100085	their	3003	" ... They did a lot of week - ending at hotels , and sometimes I went down with them . We seemed to fall into a vast drifting crowd of social learners . I do n't know whether it is due simply to my changed circumstances , but it seems to me there have been immensely disproportionate developments of the hotel - frequenting and restaurant - using population during the last twenty years . It is not only , I think , that there are crowds of people who , like we were , are in the economically ascendant phase , but whole masses of the prosperous section of the population must be altering its habits , giving up high - tea for dinner and taking to evening dress , using the week - end hotels as a practise - ground for these new social arts . A swift and systematic conversion to gentility has been going on , I am convinced , throughout the whole commercial upper - middle class since I was twenty - one . Curiously mixed was the personal quality of the people one saw in these raids . There were conscientiously refined and low - voiced people reeking with proud bashfulness ; there were aggressively smart people using pet diminutives for each other loudly and seeking fresh occasions for brilliant rudeness ; there were awkward husbands and wives quarrelling furtively about their manners and ill at ease under the eye of the winter ; cheerfully amiable and often discrepant couples with a disposition to inconspicuous corners , and the jolly sort , affecting an unaffected ease ; plump happy ladies who laughed too loud , and gentlemen in evening dress who subsequently "
100088	100146	100085	100085	their	3003	" And nobody , you knew , was anybody , however expensively they dressed and whatever rooms they took . I look back now with a curious remoteness of spirit to those crowded dining - rooms with their dispersed tables and their inevitable red - shaded lights and the unsympathetic , unskillful waiters , and the choice of "
100153	100875	100085	100085	their	3003	" I 've not dined in that way , in that sort of place , now for five years - it must be quite five years , so specialised and narrow is my life becoming . My uncle 's earlier motor - car phases work in with these associations , and there stands out a little bright vignette of the hall of the Magnificent , Bexhill - on - Sea , and people dressed for dinner and sitting about amidst the scarlet furniture - satin and white - enameled woodwork until the gong should gather them ; and my aunt is there , very marvelously wrapped about in a dust cloak and a cage - like veil , and there are hotel porters and under - porters very alert , and an obsequious manager ; and the tall young lady in black from the office is surprised into admiration , and in the middle of the picture is my uncle , making his first appearance in that Esquimaux costume I have already mentioned , a short figure , compactly immense , hugely goggled , wearing a sort of brown rubber proboscis , and surmounted by a table - land of motoring cap . So it was we recognised our new needs as fresh invaders of the upper levels of the social system , and set ourselves quite consciously to the acquisition of Style and Savoir Faire . We became part of what is nowadays quite an important element in the confusion of our world , that multitude of economically ascendant people who are learning how to spend money . It is made up of financial people , the owners of the businesses that are eating up their competitors , inventors of new sources of wealth , such as ourselves ; it includes nearly all America as one sees it on the European stage . It is a various multitude having only this in common : they are all moving , and particularly their womankind are moving , from conditions in which means were insistently finite , things were few , and customs simple , towards a limitless expenditure and the sphere of attraction of Bond Street , Fifth Avenue , and Paris . Their general effect is one of progressive revolution , of limitless rope . They discover suddenly indulgences their moral code never foresaw and has no provision for , elaborations , ornaments , possessions beyond their wildest dreams . With an immense astonished zest they begin shopping begin a systematic adaptation to a new life crowded and brilliant with things shopped , with jewels , maids , butlers , coachmen , electric broughams , hired town and country houses . They plunge into it as one plunges into a career ; as a class , they talk , think , and dream possessions . Their literature , their Press , turns all on that ; immense illustrated weeklies of unsurpassed magnificence guide them in domestic architecture , in the art of owning a garden , in the achievement of the sumptuous in motor - cars , in an elaborate sporting equipment , in the purchase and control of their estates , in travel and stupendous hotels . Once they begin to move they go far and fast . Acquisition becomes the substance of their lives . They find a world organised to gratify that passion . In a brief year or so they are connoisseurs . They join in the plunder of the eighteenth century , buy rare old books , fine old pictures , good old furniture . Their first crude conception of dazzling suites of the newly perfect is replaced almost from the outset by a jackdaw dream of accumulating costly discrepant old things . I seem to remember my uncle taking to shopping quite suddenly . In the Beckenham days and in the early Chiselhurst days he was chiefly interested in getting money , and except for his onslaught on the Beckenham house , bothered very little about his personal surroundings and possessions . I forget now when the change came and he began to spend . Some accident must have revealed to him this new source of power , or some subtle shifting occurred in the tissues of his brain . He began to spend and "
100878	101121	100085	100085	their	3003	" So soon as he began to shop , he began to shop violently . He began buying pictures , and then , oddly enough , old clocks . For the Chiselhurst house he bought nearly a dozen grandfather clocks and three copper warming pans . After that he bought much furniture . Then he plunged into art patronage , and began to commission pictures and to make presents to churches and institutions . His buying increased with a regular acceleration . Its development was a part of the mental changes that came to him in the wild excitements of the last four years of his ascent . Towards the climax he was a furious spender ; he shopped with large unexpected purchases , he shopped like a mind seeking expression , he shopped to astonish and dismay ; shopped crescendo , shopped fortissimo , con molto espressione until the magnificent smash of Crest Hill eroded his shopping for ever . Always it was he who shopped . My aunt did not shine as a purchaser . It is a curious thing , due to I know not what fine strain in her composition , that my aunt never set any great store upon possessions . She plunged through that crowded bazaar of Vanity Fair during those feverish years , spending no doubt freely and largely , but spending with detachment and a touch of humorous contempt for the things , even the "
101123	101190	101204	101204	she	3006	" things , that money can buy . It came to me suddenly one afternoon just how detached she was , as I saw her going towards the Hardingham , sitting up , as she always did , rather stiffly in her electric brougham , regarding the glittering world with interested and ironically innocent blue eyes from under the brim of a hat that defied comment . "
101194	101198	100085	100085	their	3003	" I thought , "
101215	101281	101282	101282	George	480	" I 'd never thought . And I remember , too , an outburst of scornful description after she had lunched with a party of women at the Imperial Cosmic Club . She came round to my rooms on the chance of finding me there , and I gave her tea . She professed herself tired and cross , and flung herself into my chair .... "
101284	101288	101282	101282	George	480	" she cried , "
101300	101301	101295	101295	I	0	" "
101304	101311	101295	101295	I	0	" I asked . She nodded . "
101315	101316	101312	101313	Plutocratic ladies	3008	" "
101319	101320	101312	101313	Plutocratic ladies	3008	" "
101324	101325	101329	101331	a burst hareem	3009	" "
101356	101366	101347	101347	George	480	" I soothed her as well as I could . "
101374	101378	101372	101372	they	3008	" I said . "
101388	101401	101402	101402	They	3008	" she said , drinking tea ; and then in infinite disgust , "
101414	101492	101410	101410	they	3008	" I had a moment of doubt whether perhaps she had not been discovered in possession of unsuspected forgeries . I do n't know . After that my eyes were quickened , and I began to see for myself women running their hands over other women 's furs , scrutinising their lace , even demanding to handle jewelry , appraising , envying , testing . They have a kind of etiquette . The woman who feels says , "
101497	101498	101410	101410	they	3008	" "
101503	101510	101410	101410	they	3008	" The woman felt admits proudly : "
101518	101526	101515	101515	you	480	" or disavows pretension modestly and hastily , "
101532	101659	101515	101515	you	480	" In each other 's houses they peer at the pictures , handle the selvage of hangings , look at the bottoms of china .... I wonder if it IS the old pawnshop in the blood . I doubt if Lady Drew and the Olympians did that sort of thing , but here I may be only clinging to another of my former illusions about aristocracy and the State . Perhaps always possessions have been Booty , and never anywhere has there been such a thing as house and furnishings native and natural to the women and men who made use of them .... For me , at least , it marked an epoch in my uncle 's career when I learnt one day that he had "
101661	101716	101515	101515	you	480	" Lady Grove . I realised a fresh , wide , unpreluded step . He took me by surprise with the sudden change of scale from such portable possessions as jewels and motor - cars to a stretch of countryside . The transaction was Napoleonic ; he was told of the place ; he said "
101718	102146	101515	101515	you	480	" ; there were no preliminary desirings or searchings . Then he came home and said what he had done . Even my aunt was for a day or so measurably awestricken by this exploit in purchase , and we both went down with him to see the house in a mood near consternation . It struck us then as a very lordly place indeed . I remember the three of us standing on the terrace that looked westward , surveying the sky - reflecting windows of the house , and a feeling of unwarrantable intrusion comes back to me . Lady Grove , you know , is a very beautiful house indeed , a still and gracious place , whose age - long seclusion was only effectively broken with the toot of the coming of the motor - car . An old Catholic family had died out in it , century by century , and was now altogether dead . Portions of the fabric are thirteenth century , and its last architectural revision was Tudor ; within , it is for the most part dark and chilly , save for two or three favoured rooms and its tall - windowed , oak - galleried hall . Its terrace is its noblest feature ; a very wide , broad lawn it is , bordered by a low stone battlement , and there is a great cedar in one corner under whose level branches one looks out across the blue distances of the Weald , blue distances that are made extraordinarily Italian in quality by virtue of the dark masses of that single tree . It is a very high terrace ; southward one looks down upon the tops of wayfaring trees and spruces , and westward on a steep slope of beechwood , through which the road comes . One turns back to the still old house , and sees a grey and lichenous facade with a very finely arched entrance . It was warmed by the afternoon light and touched with the colour of a few neglected roses and a pyracanthus . It seemed to me that the most modern owner conceivable in this serene fine place was some bearded scholarly man in a black cassock , gentle - voiced and white - handed , or some very soft - robed , grey gentlewoman . And there was my uncle holding his goggles in a sealskin glove , wiping the glass with a pocket - handkerchief , and asking my aunt if Lady Grove was n't a "
102152	102160	102161	102165	The man who built this	3010	" My aunt made him no answer . "
102167	102171	102161	102165	The man who built this	3010	" I speculated , "
102179	102180	102161	102165	The man who built this	3010	" "
102189	102518	102522	102522	George	480	" said my uncle . We went inside . An old woman with very white hair was in charge of the place and cringed rather obviously to the new master . She evidently found him a very strange and frightful apparition indeed , and was dreadfully afraid of him . But if the surviving present bowed down to us , the past did not . We stood up to the dark , long portraits of the extinguished race - one was a Holbein - and looked them in their sidelong eyes . They looked back at us . We all , I know , felt the enigmatical quality in them . Even my uncle was momentarily embarrassed , I think , by that invincibly self - complacent expression . It was just as though , after all , he had not bought them up and replaced them altogether ; as though that , secretly , they knew better and could smile at him . The spirit of the place was akin to Bladesover , but touched with something older and remoter . That armour that stood about had once served in tilt - yards , if indeed it had not served in battle , and this family had sent its blood and treasure , time after time , upon the most romantic quest in history , to Palestine . Dreams , loyalties , place and honour , how utterly had it all evaporated , leaving , at last , the final expression of its spirit , these quaint painted smiles , these smiles of triumphant completion ! It had evaporated , indeed , long before the ultimate Durgan had died , and in his old age he had cumbered the place with Early Victorian cushions and carpets and tapestry table - cloths and invalid appliances of a type even more extinct , it seemed to us , than the crusades .... Yes , it was different from Bladesover . "
102524	102529	102522	102522	George	480	" said my uncle . "
102542	102561	102530	102530	They	3011	" One of the panelled rooms was half - filled with presses and a four - poster bed . "
102568	102681	102530	102530	They	3011	" said my uncle ; but it did not seem to me that so retiring a family as the Durgans , so old and completely exhausted a family as the Durgans , was likely to haunt anybody . What living thing now had any concern with their honour and judgments and good and evil deeds ? Ghosts and witchcraft were a later innovation - that fashion came from Scotland with the Stuarts . Afterwards , prying for epitaphs , we found a marble crusader with a broken nose , under a battered canopy of fretted stone , outside the restricted limits of the present Duffield church , and half buried in nettles . "
102684	102689	102690	102690	Eh	3013	" said my uncle . "
102722	102723	102724	102725	Old saved	3017	" "
102731	103491	102724	102725	Old saved	3017	" said my aunt , quoting one of the less successful advertisements of Tono - Bungay . But I do n't think my uncle heard her . It was by our captured crusader that the vicar found us . He came round the corner at us briskly , a little out of breath . He had an air of having been running after us since the first toot of our horn had warned the village of our presence . He was an Oxford man , clean - shaven , with a cadaverous complexion and a guardedly respectful manner , a cultivated intonation , and a general air of accommodation to the new order of things . These Oxford men are the Greeks of our plutocratic empire . He was a Tory in spirit , and what one may call an adapted Tory by stress of circumstances ; that is to say , he was no longer a legitimist ; he was prepared for the substitution of new lords for old . We were pill vendors he knew , and no doubt horribly vulgar in soul ; but then it might have been some polygamous Indian rajah , a great strain on a good man 's tact , or some Jew with an inherited expression of contempt . Anyhow , we were English , and neither Dissenters nor Socialists , and he was cheerfully prepared to do what he could to make gentlemen of both of us . He might have preferred Americans for some reasons ; they are not so obviously taken from one part of the social system and dumped down in another , and they are more teachable ; but in this world we can not always be choosers . So he was very bright and pleasant with us , showed us the church , gossiped informingly about our neighbours on the countryside - Tux , the banker ; Lord Boom , the magazine and newspaper proprietor ; Lord Carnaby , that great sportsman , and old Lady Osprey . And finally he took us by way of a village lane - three children bobbed convulsively with eyes of terror for my uncle - through a meticulous garden to a big , slovenly Vicarage with faded Victorian furniture and a faded Victorian wife , who gave us tea and introduced us to a confusing family dispersed among a lot of disintegrating basket chairs upon the edge of a well - used tennis lawn . These people interested me . They were a common type , no doubt , but they were new to me . There were two lank sons who had been playing singles at tennis , red - eared youths growing black moustaches , and dressed in conscientiously untidy tweeds and unbuttoned and ungirt Norfolk jackets . There were a number of ill - nourished - looking daughters , sensible and economical in their costume , the younger still with long , brown - stockinged legs , and the eldest present - there were , we discovered , one or two hidden away - displaying a large gold cross and other aggressive ecclesiastical symbols ; there were two or three fox - terriers , a retrieverish mongrel , and an old , bloody - eyed and very evil - smelling St. Bernard . There was a jackdaw . There was , moreover , an ambiguous , silent lady that my aunt subsequently decided must be a very deaf paying guest . Two or three other people had concealed themselves at our coming and left unfinished teas behind them . Rugs and cushions lay among the chairs , and two of the latter were , I noted , covered with Union Jacks . The vicar introduced us sketchily , and the faded Victorian wife regarded my aunt with a mixture of conventional scorn and abject respect , and talked to her in a languid , persistent voice about people in the neighbourhood whom my aunt could not possibly know . My aunt received these personalia cheerfully , with her blue eyes flitting from point to point , and coming back again and again to the pinched faces of the daughters and the cross upon the eldest 's breast . Encouraged by my aunt 's manner , the vicar 's wife grew patronising and kindly , and made it evident that she could do much to bridge the social gulf between ourselves and the people of family about us . I had just snatches of that conversation . "

103803	103935	103795	103795	he	3029	" The silent lady , unperturbed by these apparently exciting topics , scrutinised my aunt 's costume with a singular intensity , and was visibly moved when she unbuttoned her dust cloak and flung it wide . Meanwhile we men conversed , one of the more spirited daughters listened brightly , and the youths lay on the grass at our feet . My uncle offered them cigars , but they both declined,-out of bashfulness , it seemed to me , whereas the vicar , I think , accepted out of tact . When we were not looking at them directly , these young men would kick each other furtively . Under the influence of my uncle 's cigar , the vicar 's mind had soared beyond the limits of the district . "
103939	103943	103936	103937	This Socialism	3035	" he said , "
103949	103956	103936	103937	This Socialism	3035	" My uncle shook his head . "

104032	104109	104027	104027	I	0	" Milly , dear ! Oh ! she 's not here . Painters , too , they have . This Socialist , it seems to me , is part of the Unrest of the Age .... But , as you say , the spirit of the people is against it . In the country , at any rate . The people down here are too sturdily independent in their small way - and too sensible altogether . "
104111	104126	104127	104127	he	3041	" It 's a great thing for Duffield to have Lady Grove occupied again , "
104146	104187	104127	104127	he	3041	" People have always looked up to the house and considering all things , old Mr. Durgan really was extraordinarily good - extraordinarily good . You intend to give us a good deal of your time here , I hope . "
104188	104199	104201	104202	my uncle	731	" I mean to do my duty by the Parish , "
104204	104248	104201	104202	my uncle	731	" I 'm sincerely glad to hear it - sincerely . We 've missed - the house influence . An English village is n't complete - People get out of hand . Life grows dull . The young people drift away to London . "
104258	104269	104270	104270	he	731	" We shall look to you to liven things up , "
104288	104296	104297	104297	he	731	" What you think the place wants ? "
104308	104349	104300	104300	He	731	" I been thinking while you been talking - things one might do . Cricket - a good English game - sports . Build the chaps a pavilion perhaps . Then every village ought to have a miniature rifle range . "
104350	104355	104357	104358	the vicar	813	" Ye - ees , "
104360	104373	104357	104358	the vicar	813	" Provided , of course , there is n't a constant popping . "
104375	104381	104383	104384	my uncle	731	" Manage THAT all right , "
104386	104438	104383	104384	my uncle	731	" Thing'd be a sort of long shed . Paint it red . British colour . Then there 's a Union Jack for the church and the village school . Paint the school red , too , p'raps . Not enough colour about now . Too grey . Then a maypole . "
104439	104451	104453	104454	the vicar	813	" How far our people would take up that sort of thing- "
104456	104470	104472	104473	my uncle	731	" I 'm all for getting that good old English spirit back again , "
104475	104501	104472	104473	my uncle	731	" Merrymakings . Lads and lasses dancing on the village green . Harvest home . Fairings . Yule Log - all the rest of it . "

104626	104718	104623	104624	the vicar	813	" all the brisker girls go into service in or near London . The life of excitement attracts them . And no doubt the higher wages have something to do with it . And the liberty to wear finery . And generally - freedom from restraint . So that there might be a little difficulty perhaps to find a May Queen here just at present who was really young and er - pretty .... Of course I could n't think of any of my girls - or anything of that sort . "
104719	104727	104729	104730	my uncle	731	" We got to attract 'em back , "
104732	104825	104826	104827	The vicar	813	" That 's what I feel about it . We got to Buck - Up the country . The English country is a going concern still ; just as the Established Church - if you 'll excuse me saying it , is a going concern . Just as Oxford is - or Cambridge . Or any of those old , fine old things . Only it wants fresh capital , fresh idees and fresh methods . Light railways , f'rinstance - scientific use of drainage . Wire fencing machinery - all that . "

And who 'll have to scoot the butler ? Me ! Who 's got to forget all she ever knew and start again ? Me ! Who 's got to trek from Chiselhurst and be a great lady ? Me ! ... You old Bother !

113485	115051	113476	113476	I	0	" He bade me good morning and went his way , bowed and thoughtful .... He had kept the truth from his mind a long time , but that morning it had forced its way to him with an aspect that brooked no denial that this time it was not just changes that were coming in his world , but that all his world lay open and defenceless , conquered and surrendered , doomed so far as he could see , root and branch , scale and form alike , to change . For nearly all the time that my uncle was incubating and hatching Crest Hill I was busy in a little transverse valley between that great beginning and Lady Grove with more and more costly and ambitious experiments in aerial navigation . This work was indeed the main substance of my life through all the great time of the Tono - Bungay symphony . I have told already how I came to devote myself to this system of inquiries , how in a sort of disgust with the common adventure of life I took up the dropped ends of my college studies , taking them up again with a man 's resolution instead of a boy 's ambition . From the first I did well at this work . It - was , I think , largely a case of special aptitude , of a peculiar irrelevant vein of faculty running through my mind . It is one of those things men seem to have by chance , that has little or nothing to do with their general merit , and which it is ridiculous to be either conceited or modest about . I did get through a very big mass of work in those years , working for a time with a concentrated fierceness that left little of such energy or capacity as I possess unused . I worked out a series of problems connected with the stability of bodies pitching in the air and the internal movements of the wind , and I also revolutionised one leading part at last of the theory of explosive engines . These things are to be found in the Philosophical Transactions , the Mathematical Journal , and less frequently in one or two other such publications , and they need n't detain us here . Indeed , I doubt if I could write about them here . One acquires a sort of shorthand for one 's notes and mind in relation to such special work . I have never taught ; nor lectured , that is to say , I have never had to express my thoughts about mechanical things in ordinary everyday language , and I doubt very much if I could do so now without extreme tedium . My work was , to begin with , very largely theoretical . I was able to attack such early necessities of verification as arose with quite little models , using a turntable to get the motion through the air , and cane , whalebone and silk as building material . But a time came when incalculable factors crept in , factors of human capacity and factors of insufficient experimental knowledge , when one must needs guess and try . Then I had to enlarge the scale of my operations , and soon I had enlarged them very greatly . I set to work almost concurrently on the balance and stability of gliders and upon the steering of inflated bags , the latter a particularly expensive branch of work . I was no doubt moved by something of the same spirit of lavish expenditure that was running away with my uncle in these developments . Presently my establishment above Lady Grove had grown to a painted wood chalet big enough to accommodate six men , and in which I would sometimes live for three weeks together ; to a gasometer , to a motor - house , to three big corrugated - roofed sheds and lock - up houses , to a stage from which to start gliders , to a workshop and so forth . A rough road was made . We brought up gas from Cheaping and electricity from Woking , which place I found also afforded a friendly workshop for larger operations than I could manage . I had the luck also to find a man who seemed my heaven - sent second - in - command - Cothope his name was . He was a self - educated - man ; he had formerly been a sapper and he was one of the best and handiest working engineers alive . Without him I do not think I could have achieved half what I have done . At times he has been not so much my assistant as my collaborator , and has followed my fortunes to this day . Other men came and went as I needed them . I do not know how far it is possible to convey to any one who has not experienced it , the peculiar interest , the peculiar satisfaction that lies in a sustained research when one is not hampered by want of money . It is a different thing from any other sort of human effort . You are free from the exasperating conflict with your fellow - creatures altogether - at least so far as the essential work goes ; that for me is its peculiar merit . Scientific truth is the remotest of mistresses ; she hides in strange places , she is attained by tortuous and laborious roads , but SHE IS ALWAYS THERE ! Win to her and she will not fail you ; she is yours and mankind 's for ever . She is reality , the one reality I have found in this strange disorder of existence . She will not sulk with you nor misunderstand you nor cheat you of your reward upon some petty doubt . You can not change her by advertisement or clamour , nor stifle her in vulgarities . Things grow under your hands when you serve her , things that are permanent as nothing else is permanent in the whole life of man . That , I think , is the peculiar satisfaction of science and its enduring reward .... The taking up of experimental work produced a great change in my personal habits . I have told how already once in my life at Wimblehurst I had a period of discipline and continuous effort , and how , when I came to South Kensington , I became demoralised by the immense effect of London , by its innumerable imperative demands upon my attention and curiosity . And I parted with much of my personal pride when I gave up science for the development of Tono - Bungay . But my poverty kept me abstinent and my youthful romanticism kept me chaste until my married life was well under way . Then in all directions I relaxed . I did a large amount of work , but I never troubled to think whether it was my maximum nor whether the moods and indolences that came to me at times were avoidable things . With the coming of plenty I ate abundantly and foolishly , drank freely and followed my impulses more and more carelessly . I felt no reason why I should do anything else . Never at any point did I use myself to the edge of my capacity . The emotional crisis of my divorce did not produce any immediate change in these matters of personal discipline . I found some difficulty at first in concentrating my mind upon scientific work , it was so much more exacting than business , but I got over that difficulty by smoking . I became an inordinate cigar smoker ; it gave me moods of profound depression , but I treated these usually by the homeopathic method,-by lighting another cigar . I did n't realise at all how loose my moral and nervous fibre had become until I reached the practical side of my investigations and was face to face with the necessity of finding out just how it felt to use a glider and just what a man could do with one . I got into this relaxed habit of living in spite of very real tendencies in my nature towards discipline . I 've never been in love with self - indulgence . That philosophy of the loose lip and the lax paunch is one for which I 've always had an instinctive distrust . I like bare things , stripped things , plain , austere and continent things , fine lines and cold colours . But in these plethoric times when there is too much coarse stuff for everybody and the struggle for life takes the form of competitive advertisement and the effort to fill your neighbour 's eye , when there is no urgent demand either for personal courage , sound nerves or stark beauty , we find ourselves by accident . Always before these times the bulk of the people did not over - eat themselves , because they could n't , whether they wanted to do so or not , and all but a very few were kept "

Now , if only he pitch his standard low enough and keep free from pride , almost any one can achieve a sort of excess . You can go through contemporary life fudging and evading , indulging and slacking , never really hungry nor frightened nor passionately stirred , your highest moment a mere sentimental orgasm , and your first real contact with primary and elemental necessities , the sweat of your death - bed . So I think it was with my uncle ; so , very nearly , it was with me . But the glider brought me up smartly . I had to find out how these things went down the air , and the only way to find out is to go down with one . And for a time I would n't face it . There is something impersonal about a book , I suppose . At any rate I find myself able to write down here just the confession I 've never been able to make to any one face to face , the frightful trouble it was to me to bring myself to do what I suppose every other coloured boy in the West Indies could do without turning a hair , and that is to fling myself off for my first soar down the wind . The first trial was bound to be the worst ; it was an experiment I made with life , and the chance of death or injury was , I supposed , about equal to the chance of success . I believed that with a dawn - like lucidity . I had begun with a glider that I imagined was on the lines of the Wright brothers ' aeroplane , but I could not be sure . It might turn over . I might upset it . It might burrow its nose at the end and smash itself and me . The conditions of the flight necessitated alert attention ; it was n't a thing to be done by jumping off and shutting one 's eyes or getting angry or drunk to do it . One had to use one 's weight to balance . And when at last I did it it was horrible - for ten seconds . For ten seconds or so , as I swept down the air flattened on my infernal framework and with the wind in my eyes , the rush of the ground beneath me filled me with sick and helpless terror ; I felt as though some violent oscillatory current was throbbing in brain and back bone , and I groaned aloud . I set my teeth and groaned . It was a groan wrung out of me in spite of myself . My sensations of terror swooped to a climax . And then , you know , they ended ! Suddenly my terror was over and done with . I was soaring through the air right way up , steadily , and no mischance had happened . I felt intensely alive and my nerves were strung like a bow . I shifted a limb , swerved and shouted between fear and triumph as I recovered from the swerve and heeled the other way and steadied myself . I thought I was going to hit a rook that was flying athwart me,-it was queer with what projectile silence that jumped upon me out of nothingness , and I yelled helplessly , "
115650	116495	116506	116506	Ponderevo	351	" The bird doubled itself up like a partly inverted V , flapped , went up to the right abruptly and vanished from my circle of interest . Then I saw the shadow of my aeroplane keeping a fixed distance before me and very steady , and the turf as it seemed streaming out behind it . The turf!-it was n't after all streaming so impossibly fast . When I came gliding down to the safe spread of level green I had chosen , I was as cool and ready as a city clerk who drops off an omnibus in motion , and I had learnt much more than soaring . I tilted up her nose at the right moment , levelled again and grounded like a snowflake on a windless day . I lay flat for an instant and then knelt up and got on my feet atremble , but very satisfied with myself . Cothope was running down the hill to me . ... But from that day I went into training , and I kept myself in training for many months . I had delayed my experiments for very nearly six weeks on various excuses because of my dread of this first flight , because of the slackness of body and spirit that had come to me with the business life . The shame of that cowardice spurred me none the less because it was probably altogether my own secret . I felt that Cothope at any rate might suspect . Well,-he should n't suspect again . It is curious that I remember that shame and self accusation and its consequences far more distinctly than I recall the weeks of vacillation before I soared . For a time I went altogether without alcohol , I stopped smoking altogether and ate very sparingly , and every day I did something that called a little upon my nerves and muscles . I soared as frequently as I could . I substituted a motor - bicycle for the London train and took my chances in the southward traffic , and I even tried what thrills were to be got upon a horse . But they put me on made horses , and I conceived a perhaps unworthy contempt for the certitudes of equestrian exercise in comparison with the adventures of mechanism . Also I walked along the high wall at the back of Lady Grove garden , and at last brought myself to stride the gap where the gate comes . If I did n't altogether get rid of a certain giddy instinct by such exercises , at least I trained my will until it did n't matter . And soon I no longer dreaded flight , but was eager to go higher into the air , and I came to esteem soaring upon a glider , that even over the deepest dip in the ground had barely forty feet of fall beneath it , a mere mockery of what flight might be . I began to dream of the keener freshness in the air high above the beechwoods , and it was rather to satisfy that desire than as any legitimate development of my proper work that presently I turned a part of my energies and the bulk of my private income to the problem of the navigable balloon . I had gone far beyond that initial stage ; I had had two smashes and a broken rib which my aunt nursed with great energy , and was getting some reputation in the aeronautic world when , suddenly , as though she had never really left it , the Honourable Beatrice Normandy , dark - eyed , and with the old disorderly wave of the hair from her brow , came back into my life . She came riding down a grass path in the thickets below Lady Grove , perched up on a huge black horse , and the old Earl of Carnaby and Archie Garvell , her half - brother , were with her . My uncle had been bothering me about the Crest Hill hot - water pipes , and we were returning by a path transverse to theirs and came out upon them suddenly . Old Carnaby was trespassing on our ground , and so he hailed us in a friendly fashion and pulled up to talk to us . I did n't note Beatrice at all at first . I was interested in Lord Carnaby , that remarkable vestige of his own brilliant youth . I had heard of him , but never seen him . For a man of sixty - five who had sinned all the sins , so they said , and laid waste the most magnificent political debut of any man of his generation , he seemed to me to be looking remarkably fit and fresh . He was a lean little man with grey - blue eyes in his brown face , and his cracked voice was the worst thing in his effect . "
116508	116530	116506	116506	Ponderevo	351	" he cried ; and my uncle , who was sometimes a little too general and generous with titles , answered , "
116549	116550	116543	116543	you	3336	" "
116561	116565	116551	116551	You	3336	" said Carnaby . "
116575	116580	116567	116567	I	0	" said my uncle . "
116593	116594	116567	116567	I	0	" "
116599	116604	116567	116567	I	0	" said the earl . "
116631	116741	116618	116618	they	3341	" Then I discovered that the silent figure behind the earl was Beatrice . I 'd forgotten her sufficiently to think for a moment that she had n't changed at all since she had watched me from behind the skirts of Lady Drew . She was looking at me , and her dainty brow under her broad brimmed hat - she was wearing a grey hat and loose unbuttoned coat - was knit with perplexity , trying , I suppose , to remember where she had seen me before . Her shaded eyes met mine with that mute question .... It seemed incredible to me she did n't remember . "
116744	117037	116618	116618	they	3341	" said the earl and touched his horse . Garvell was patting the neck of his horse , which was inclined to fidget , and disregarding me . He nodded over his shoulder and followed . His movement seemed to release a train of memories in her . She glanced suddenly at him and then back at me with a flash of recognition that warmed instantly to a faint smile . She hesitated as if to speak to me , smiled broadly and understandingly and turned to follow the others . All three broke into a canter and she did not look back . I stood for a second or so at the crossing of the lanes , watching her recede , and then became aware that my uncle was already some paces off and talking over his shoulder in the belief that I was close behind . I turned about and strode to overtake him . My mind was full of Beatrice and this surprise . I remembered her simply as a Normandy . I 'd clean forgotten that Garvell was the son and she the step - daughter of our neighbour , Lady Osprey . Indeed , I 'd probably forgotten at that time that we had Lady Osprey as a neighbour . There was no reason at all for remembering it . It was amazing to find her in this Surrey countryside , when I 'd never thought of her as living anywhere in the world but at Bladesover Park , near forty miles and twenty years away . She was so alive - so unchanged ! The same quick warm blood was in her cheeks . It seemed only yesterday that we had kissed among the bracken stems .... "

117283	117344	117347	117347	Crikey	638	" What puzzled me more particularly was the queer trick of my memory that had never recalled anything vital of Beatrice whatever when I met Garvell again that had , indeed , recalled nothing except a boyish antagonism and our fight . Now when my senses were full of her , it seemed incredible that I could ever have forgotten .... "
117349	117363	117347	117347	Crikey	638	" said my aunt , reading a letter behind her coffee - machine . "
117372	117408	117366	117368	a young woman	3352	" We were breakfasting together in the big window bay at Lady Grove that looks upon the iris beds ; my uncle was in London . I sounded an interrogative note and decapitated an egg . "

123843	123853	123835	123835	He	634	" Very dangerous thing coming across us like that . "

124704	124747	124685	124685	She	409	" H'm . Difficult to say . But why do you ask ? Is the daughter of a courtesy Baron who died - of general disreputableness , I believe - before his father- ? I give it up . Does it matter ? "
124748	124766	124767	124767	She	409	" No . My mind is confused . I want to know if you will marry me . "

125015	125023	125012	125012	she	409	" How can I say anything now ? "

125148	125154	125155	125155	she	409	" Why did you talk ? "
125158	125164	125165	125165	She	409	" could n't you SEE ? "
125191	125199	125200	125200	she	409	" Why did you talk like that ? "
125209	125215	125200	125200	she	409	" To begin like that ! "
125216	125222	125223	125223	I	0	" But what is it ? "
125226	125236	125223	125223	I	0	" Is it some circumstance - my social position ? "
125237	125245	125246	125246	she	409	" Oh , DAMN your social position ! "
125291	125302	125303	125303	she	409	" You did n't ask me if I loved you , "
125306	125314	125316	125316	I.	0	" Oh , if it 's THAT ! "
125317	125323	125324	125324	she	409	" It 's not that , "
125327	125334	125335	125335	She	409	" But if you want to know- "
125338	125342	125343	125343	she	409	" I do , "
125352	125367	125346	125346	We	3517	" I do - with all my heart , if you want to know . "
125368	125375	125376	125376	I	0	" Then , why the devil- ? "
125418	125423	125425	125425	she	409	" Tristan and Isolde . "
125580	125588	125590	125590	I	0	" I 'll go back to bed , "
125592	125619	125590	125590	I	0	" if I may have a word with Miss Beatrice . I 've got something to say to her . That 's why I 'm dressing . "
125676	125679	125680	125680	she	409	" Well ? "
125683	125690	125691	125691	I	0	" All I want to say , "
125702	125740	125691	125691	I	0	" is that I ca n't take this as final . I want to see you and talk when I 'm better , and write . I ca n't do anything now . I ca n't argue . "
125753	125768	125741	125741	I	0	" I ca n't rest . You see ? I ca n't do anything . "
125779	125816	125769	125769	She	409	" I promise I will talk it all over with you again . When you are well . I promise I will meet you somewhere so that we can talk . You ca n't talk now . "
125838	125839	125840	125840	I	0	" "
125845	125882	125840	125840	I	0	" She looked round to see the door was closed , stood up and went to it . Then she crouched beside me and began whispering very softly and rapidly with her face close to me . "
125885	125889	125840	125840	I	0	" she said , "
126032	126033	126000	126000	you	5388	" "
126036	126040	126000	126000	you	5388	" I said , "
126044	126045	126000	126000	you	5388	" "
126096	126097	126092	126092	you	5388	" "

126115	126133	126134	126134	I	0	" She laid her head down beside mine for a moment and then she kissed my hand . "
126143	126201	126134	126134	I	0	" I said , and I shut my eyes . But I was only beginning to gauge the unaccountable elements in Beatrice . For a week after my return to Lady Grove I had no sign of her , and then she called with Lady Osprey and brought a huge bunch of perennial sunflowers and Michaelmas daisies , "
126212	126314	126315	126315	I	0	" said my aunt , with a relentless eye on me . I did n't get any talk alone with Beatrice then , and she took occasion to tell us she was going to London for some indefinite number of weeks . I could n't even pledge her to write to me , and when she did it was a brief , enigmatical , friendly letter with not a word of the reality between us . I wrote back a love letter - my first love letter - and she made no reply for eight days . Then came a scrawl : "
126331	127199	127200	127200	You	3536	" I think the reader would be amused if he could see the papers on my desk as I write all this , the mangled and disfigured pages , the experimental arrangements of notes , the sheets of suggestions balanced in constellations , the blottesque intellectual battlegrounds over which I have been fighting . I find this account of my relations to Beatrice quite the most difficult part of my story to write . I happen to be a very objective - minded person , I forget my moods , and this was so much an affair of moods . And even such moods and emotions as I recall are very difficult to convey . To me it is about as difficult as describing a taste or a scent . Then the objective story is made up of little things that are difficult to set in a proper order . And love in an hysterical passion , now high , now low , now exalted , and now intensely physical . No one has ever yet dared to tell a love story completely , its alternations , its comings and goings , its debased moments , its hate . The love stories we tell , tell only the net consequence , the ruling effect .... How can I rescue from the past now the mystical quality of Beatrice ; my intense longing for her ; the overwhelming , irrational , formless desire ? How can I explain how intimately that worship mingled with a high , impatient resolve to make her mine , to take her by strength and courage , to do my loving in a violent heroic manner ? And then the doubts , the puzzled arrest at the fact of her fluctuations , at her refusal to marry me , at the fact that even when at last she returned to Bedley Corner she seemed to evade me ? That exasperated me and perplexed me beyond measure . I felt that it was treachery . I thought of every conceivable explanation , and the most exalted and romantic confidence in her did not simply alternate , but mingled with the basest misgivings . And into the tangle of memories comes the figure of Carnaby , coming out slowly from the background to a position of significance , as an influence , as a predominant strand in the nets that kept us apart , as a rival . What were the forces that pulled her away from me when it was so clearly manifest she loved me ? Did she think of marrying him ? Had I invaded some long - planned scheme ? It was evident he did not like me , that in some way I spoilt the world for him . She returned to Bedley Corner , and for some weeks she was flitting about me , and never once could I have talk with her alone . When she came to my sheds Carnaby was always with her , jealously observant . ( Why the devil could n't she send him about his business ? ) The days slipped by and my anger gathered . All this mingles with the making of Lord Roberts B. I had resolved upon that one night as I lay awake at Bedley Corner ; I got it planned out before the bandages were off my face . I conceived this second navigable balloon in a grandiose manner . It was to be a second Lord Roberts A , only more so ; it was to be three times as big , large enough to carry three men , and it was to be an altogether triumphant vindication of my claims upon the air . The framework was to be hollow like a bird 's bones , airtight , and the air pumped in or out , and the weight of fuel I carried changed . I talked much and boasted to Cothope - whom I suspected of scepticisms about this new type - of what it would do , and it progressed - slowly . It progressed slowly because I was restless and uncertain . At times I would go away to London to snatch some chance of seeing Beatrice there , at times nothing but a day of gliding and hard and dangerous exercise would satisfy me . And now in the newspapers , in conversation , in everything about me , arose a new invader of my mental states . Something was happening to the great schemes of my uncle 's affairs ; people were beginning to doubt , to question . It was the first quiver of his tremendous insecurity , the first wobble of that gigantic credit top he had kept spinning so long . There were comings and goings , November and December slipped by . I had two unsatisfactory meetings with Beatrice , meetings that had no privacy - in which we said things of the sort that need atmosphere , baldly and furtively . I wrote to her several times and she wrote back notes that I would sometimes respond to altogether , sometimes condemn as insincere evasions . "
127225	127253	127254	127254	You	3536	" She wrote . I would talk aloud to these notes and wrangle over them in my workroom - while the plans of Lord Roberts B waited . "
127262	127267	127254	127254	You	3536	" I would say . "
127294	127333	127334	127334	You	3536	" And at last I could hold out no longer against these accumulating pressures . I took an arrogant , outrageous line that left her no loopholes ; I behaved as though we were living in a melodrama . "
127342	127346	127334	127334	You	3536	" I wrote , "
127365	127540	127355	127355	I	0	" We met in a ride in the upper plantations . It must have been early in January , for there was snow on the ground and on the branches of the trees . We walked to and fro for an hour or more , and from the first I pitched the key high in romance and made understandings impossible . It was our worst time together . I boasted like an actor , and she , I know not why , was tired and spiritless . Now I think over that talk in the light of all that has happened since , I can imagine how she came to me full of a human appeal I was too foolish to let her make . I do n't know . I confess I have never completely understood Beatrice . I confess I am still perplexed at many things she said and did . That afternoon , anyhow , I was impossible . I posed and scolded . I was - I said it - for "

127556	127633	127355	127355	I	0	" she said , but though I heard , I did not heed her . At last she gave way to me and talked no more . Instead she looked at me - as a thing beyond her controlling , but none the less interesting - much as she had looked at me from behind the skirts of Lady Drew in the Warren when we were children together . Once even I thought she smiled faintly . "
127638	127642	127355	127355	I	0	" I cried , "
127688	127717	127718	127718	I	0	" Here am I just grown a man at the sight of you . I have wanted something to fight for . Let me fight for you ! ... "
127753	127813	127814	127814	You	3537	" I said such things as that . I write them down here in all their resounding base pride . I said these empty and foolish things , and they are part of me . Why should I still cling to pride and be ashamed ? I shouted her down . I passed from such megalomania to petty accusations . "
127824	127828	127814	127814	You	3537	" I said . "
127831	127839	127814	127814	You	3537	" she cried , stung to speech . "
127842	127843	127814	127814	You	3537	" "
127966	128189	128190	128190	We	3547	" ... Her eyes asked mutely and asked in vain that I would cease to boast of the very qualities she admired in me . In the night I could not sleep for thinking of that talk and the vulgar things I had said in it . I could not understand the drift my mind had taken . I was acutely disgusted . And my unwonted doubts about myself spread from a merely personal discontent to our financial position . It was all very well to talk as I had done of wealth and power and peerages , but what did I know nowadays of my uncle 's position ? Suppose in the midst of such boasting and confidence there came some turn I did not suspect , some rottenness he had concealed from me ? I resolved I had been playing with aeronautics long enough ; that next morning I would go to him and have things clear between us . I caught an early train and went up to the Hardingham . I went up to the Hardingham through a dense London fog to see how things really stood . Before I had talked to my uncle for ten minutes I felt like a man who has just awakened in a bleak , inhospitable room out of a grandiose dream . "
128199	128204	128190	128190	We	3547	" said my uncle . "
128212	128318	128319	128319	I	0	" I remember that even at the sight of him I had a sense of impending calamity . He sat under the electric light with the shadow of his hair making bars down his face . He looked shrunken , and as though his skin had suddenly got loose and yellow . The decorations of the room seemed to have lost freshness , and outside the blinds were up - there was not so much fog as a dun darkness . One saw the dingy outlines of the chimneys opposite quite distinctly , and then a sky of such brown as only London can display . "

I 'd never heard a woman before in all my life who could talk of love , who could lay bare and develop and touch with imagination all that mass of fine emotion every woman , it may be , hides . She had read of love , she had thought of love , a thousand sweet lyrics had sounded through her brain and left fine fragments in her memory ; she poured it out , all of it , shamelessly , skilfully , for me . I can not give any sense of that talk , I can not even tell how much of the delight of it was the magic of her voice , the glow of her near presence . And always we walked swathed warmly through a chilly air , along dim , interminable greasy roads - with never a soul abroad it seemed to us , never a beast in the fields . "
133261	133265	133256	133256	people	920	" I said . "

We had been wandering for two hours in our strange irrational community of happiness , and all the world about us , and particularly Lady Osprey and her household , had been asleep - and dreaming of anything rather than Beatrice in the night and rain . She stood in the doorway , a muffled figure with eyes that glowed . "
133441	133445	133446	133446	I	0	" she whispered . "
133452	133464	133446	133446	I	0	" She hesitated . She touched the lapel of my coat . "
133470	133494	133465	133465	I	0	" she said , and lifted her face to mine . I held her to me and was atremble from top to toe . "
133498	133502	133465	133465	I	0	" I cried . "
133508	133531	133504	133504	I	0	" She slipped from my arms and paused , regarding me . For an instant the world seemed full of fantastic possibilities . "
133536	133967	133504	133504	I	0	" she said , and vanished and slammed the door upon me , leaving me alone like a man new fallen from fairyland in the black darkness of the night . That expedition to Mordet Island stands apart from all the rest of my life , detached , a piece by itself with an atmosphere of its own . It would , I suppose , make a book by itself - it has made a fairly voluminous official report - but so far as this novel of mine goes it is merely an episode , a contributory experience , and I mean to keep it at that . Vile weather , an impatient fretting against unbearable slowness and delay , sea - sickness , general discomfort and humiliating self - revelation are the master values of these memories . I was sick all through the journey out . I do n't know why . It was the only time I was ever sea - sick , and I have seen some pretty bad weather since I became a boat - builder . But that phantom smell of potatoes was peculiarly vile to me . Coming back on the brig we were all ill , every one of us , so soon as we got to sea , poisoned , I firmly believe , by quap . On the way out most of the others recovered in a few days , but the stuffiness below , the coarse food , the cramped dirty accommodation kept me , if not actually sea - sick , in a state of acute physical wretchedness the whole time . The ship abounded in cockroaches and more intimate vermin . I was cold all the time until after we passed Cape Verde , then I became steamily hot ; I had been too preoccupied with Beatrice and my keen desire to get the Maud Mary under way at once , to consider a proper wardrobe for myself , and in particular I lacked a coat . Heavens ! how I lacked that coat ! And , moreover , I was cooped up with two of the worst bores in Christendom , Pollack and the captain . Pollack , after conducting his illness in a style better adapted to the capacity of an opera house than a small compartment , suddenly got insupportably well and breezy , and produced a manly pipe in which he smoked a tobacco as blond as himself , and divided his time almost equally between smoking it and trying to clean it . "
133980	133993	133973	133973	you	3660	" he used to remark with a twist of paper in hand . "
134064	134071	134090	134090	Eh	3668	" At which I usually swore . "
134092	134100	134090	134090	Eh	3668	" He never tired of asking me to "
134122	134159	134160	134160	Captain	3669	" He would sit swaying with the rolling of the ship and suck at his pipe of blond tobacco and look with an inexpressibly sage but somnolent blue eye at the captain by the hour together . "
134165	134180	134181	134181	He	3669	" he would say over and over again as the outcome of these meditations . "
134201	134286	134192	134192	He	3669	" That did seem to be the captain 's ruling idea . But he also wanted to impress me with the notion that he was a gentleman of good family and to air a number of views adverse to the English , to English literature , to the English constitution , and the like . He had learnt the sea in the Roumanian navy , and English out of a book ; he would still at times pronounce the e 's at the end of "
134288	134290	134181	134181	He	3669	" and "
134292	134323	134192	134192	He	3669	" ; he was a naturalised Englishman , and he drove me into a reluctant and uncongenial patriotism by his everlasting carping at things English . Pollack would set himself to "
134328	134657	134192	134192	He	3669	" Heaven alone can tell how near I came to murder . Fifty - three days I had outward , cooped up with these two and a shy and profoundly depressed mate who read the Bible on Sundays and spent the rest of his leisure in lethargy , three and fifty days of life cooped up in a perpetual smell , in a persistent sick hunger that turned from the sight of food , in darkness , cold and wet , in a lightly ballasted ship that rolled and pitched and swayed . And all the time the sands in the hour - glass of my uncle 's fortunes were streaming out . Misery ! Amidst it all I remember only one thing brightly , one morning of sunshine in the Bay of Biscay and a vision of frothing waves , sapphire green , a bird following our wake and our masts rolling about the sky . Then wind and rain close in on us again . You must not imagine they were ordinary days , days , I mean , of an average length ; they were not so much days as long damp slabs of time that stretched each one to the horizon , and much of that length was night . One paraded the staggering deck in a borrowed sou'-wester hour after hour in the chilly , windy , splashing and spitting darkness , or sat in the cabin , bored and ill , and looked at the faces of those inseparable companions by the help of a lamp that gave smell rather than light . Then one would see going up , up , up , and then sinking down , down , down , Pollack , extinct pipe in mouth , humorously observant , bringing his mind slowly to the seventy - seventh decision that the captain was a Card , while the words flowed from the latter in a nimble incessant good . "
134708	134791	134793	134793	He	3677	" Eet is all middle - class , youra England . Everything you look at , middle - class . Respectable ! Everything good - eet is , you say , shocking . Madame Grundy ! Eet is all limited and computing and self - seeking . Dat is why your art is so limited , youra fiction , your philosophin , why you are all so inartistic . You want nothing but profit ! What will pay ! What would you ? "

143127	143343	143125	143125	George	480	" My return home to Lady Grove was a very different thing from what I had anticipated when I had got out to sea with my load of quap and fancied the Perfect - Filament was safe within my grasp . As I walked through the evening light along the downs , the summer stillness seemed like the stillness of something newly dead . There were no lurking workmen any more , no cyclists on the high road . Cessation was manifest everywhere . There had been , I learnt from my aunt , a touching and quite voluntary demonstration when the Crest Hill work had come to an end and the men had drawn their last pay ; they had cheered my uncle and hooted the contractors and Lord Boom . I can not now recall the manner in which my aunt and I greeted one another . I must have been very tired there , but whatever impression was made has gone out of my memory . But I recall very clearly how we sat at the little round table near the big window that gave on the terrace , and dined and talked . I remember her talking of my uncle . She asked after him , and whether he seemed well . "
143350	143354	143344	143344	I	0	" she said . "
143403	143425	143387	143387	he	3937	" There he is - I do n't know what he 's doing . He wo n't have me near him .... "
143568	144113	143548	143548	I	0	" The next day was one of those days of strong perception that stand out clear in one 's memory when the common course of days is blurred . I can recall now the awakening in the large familiar room that was always kept for me , and how I lay staring at its chintz - covered chairs , its spaced fine furniture , its glimpse of the cedars without , and thought that all this had to end . I have never been greedy for money , I have never wanted to be rich , but I felt now an immense sense of impending deprivation . I read the newspapers after breakfast - I and my aunt together - and then I walked up to see what Cothope had done in the matter of Lord Roberts B. Never before had I appreciated so acutely the ample brightness of the Lady Grove gardens , the dignity and wide peace of all about me . It was one of those warm mornings in late May that have won all the glory of summer without losing the gay delicacy of spring . The shrubbery was bright with laburnum and lilac , the beds swarmed with daffodils and narcissi and with lilies of the valley in the shade . I went along the well - kept paths among the rhododendra and through the private gate into the woods where the bluebells and common orchid were in profusion . Never before had I tasted so completely the fine sense of privilege and ownership . And all this has to end , I told myself , all this has to end . Neither my uncle nor I had made any provision for disaster ; all we had was in the game , and I had little doubt now of the completeness of our ruin . For the first time in my life since he had sent me that wonderful telegram of his I had to consider that common anxiety of mankind,-Employment . I had to come off my magic carpet and walk once more in the world . And suddenly I found myself at the cross drives where I had seen Beatrice for the first time after so many years . It is strange , but so far as I can recollect I had not thought of her once since I had landed at Plymouth . No doubt she had filled the background of my mind , but I do not remember one definite , clear thought . I had been intent on my uncle and the financial collapse . It came like a blow in the face now ; all that , too , had to end ! Suddenly I was filled with the thought of her and a great longing for her . What would she do when she realised our immense disaster ? What would she do ? How would she take it ? It filled me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell .... Should I perhaps presently happen upon her ? I went on through the plantations and out upon the downs , and thence I saw Cothope with a new glider of his own design soaring down wind to my old familiar "
144115	144131	143548	143548	I	0	" place . To judge by its long rhythm it was a very good glider . "
144137	144141	143548	143548	I	0	" thought I , "
144165	144174	144149	144149	I	0	" He was sincerely glad to see me . "
144182	144205	144149	144149	I	0	" he said . He had been there without wages for a month , a man forgotten in the rush of events . "
144281	144282	144285	144287	Lord Roberts B	353	" "
144289	144295	144285	144287	Lord Roberts B	353	" Cothope lifted his eyebrows . "
144302	144306	144285	144287	Lord Roberts B	353	" he said . "
144314	144315	144308	144308	he	353	" "
144318	144322	144308	144308	he	353	" I said , "

144393	144394	144388	144388	you	5447	" "
144399	144403	144404	144404	I	0	" I said . "
144434	144435	144430	144430	he	353	" "
144463	144476	144453	144453	He	353	" ... Cothope returned to Socialism as we went toward the sheds . "
144487	144491	144482	144483	a Socialist	1931	" he said , "
144571	144683	144684	144684	We	3957	" Lord Roberts B , even in his partially deflated condition in his shed , was a fine thing to stare up at . I stood side by side with Cothope regarding him , and it was borne in upon me more acutely than ever that all this had to end . I had a feeling just like the feeling of a boy who wants to do wrong , that I would use up the stuff while I had it before the creditors descended . I had a queer fancy , too , I remember , that if I could get into the air it would advertise my return to Beatrice . "
144689	144694	144684	144684	We	3957	" I said concisely . "
144700	144710	144684	144684	We	3957	" said Cothope , and added as an afterthought , "
144718	145169	144712	144712	they	3961	" ... I worked and interested myself with Cothope all the morning and for a time forgot my other troubles . But the thought of Beatrice flooded me slowly and steadily . It became an unintelligent sick longing to see her . I felt that I could not wait for the filling of Lord Roberts B , that I must hunt her up and see her soon . I got everything forward and lunched with Cothope , and then with the feeblest excuses left him in order to prowl down through the woods towards Bedley Corner . I became a prey to wretched hesitations and diffidence . Ought I to go near her now ? I asked myself , reviewing all the social abasements of my early years . At last , about five , I called at the Dower House . I was greeted by their Charlotte - with a forbidding eye and a cold astonishment . Both Beatrice and Lady Osprey were out . There came into my head some prowling dream of meeting her . I went along the lane towards Woking , the lane down which we had walked five months ago in the wind and rain . I mooned for a time in our former footsteps , then swore and turned back across the fields , and then conceived a distaste for Cothope and went Downward . At last I found myself looking down on the huge abandoned masses of the Crest Hill house . That gave my mind a twist into a new channel . My uncle came uppermost again . What a strange , melancholy emptiness of intention that stricken enterprise seemed in the even evening sunlight , what vulgar magnificence and crudity and utter absurdity ! It was as idiotic as the pyramids . I sat down on the stile , staring at it as though I had never seen that forest of scaffold poles , that waste of walls and bricks and plaster and shaped stones , that wilderness of broken soil and wheeling tracks and dumps before . It struck me suddenly as the compactest image and sample of all that passes for Progress , of all the advertisement - inflated spending , the aimless building up and pulling down , the enterprise and promise of my age . This was our fruit , this was what he had done , I and my uncle , in the fashion of our time . We were its leaders and exponents , we were the thing it most flourishingly produced . For this futility in its end , for an epoch of such futility , the solemn scroll of history had unfolded .... "
145173	145177	144712	144712	they	3961	" I cried , "
145183	145382	144712	144712	they	3961	" For this the armies drilled , for this the Law was administered and the prisons did their duty , for this the millions toiled and perished in suffering , in order that a few of us should build palaces we never finished , make billiard - rooms under ponds , run imbecile walls round irrational estates , scorch about the world in motor - cars , devise flying - machines , play golf and a dozen such foolish games of ball , crowd into chattering dinner parties , gamble and make our lives one vast , dismal spectacle of witless waste ! So it struck me then , and for a time I could think of no other interpretation . This was Life ! It came to me like a revelation , a revelation at once incredible and indisputable of the abysmal folly of our being . I was roused from such thoughts by the sound of footsteps behind me . I turned half hopeful - so foolish is a lover 's imagination , and stopped amazed . It was my uncle . His face was white - white as I had seen it in my dream . "
145385	145392	144712	144712	they	3961	" I said , and stared . "
145400	145401	145396	145396	you	3962	" "
145407	145411	145396	145396	you	3962	" he said .... "
145414	145415	144712	144712	they	3961	" "
145418	145574	144712	144712	they	3961	" I stared at him for a moment , and then got off the stile . We stood swaying and then came forward with a weak motion of his arms like a man who can not see distinctly , and caught at and leant upon the stile . For a moment we were absolutely still . He made a clumsy gesture towards the great futility below and choked . I discovered that his face was wet with tears , that his wet glasses blinded him . He put up his little fat hand and clawed them off clumsily , felt inefficiently for his pocket - handkerchief , and then , to my horror , as he clung to me , he began to weep aloud , this little , old worldworn swindler . It was n't just sobbing or shedding tears , it was crying as a child cries . It was oh ! terrible ! "
145579	145585	145586	145586	They	3963	" he blubbered at last . "
145600	145609	145610	145612	The Bloody bullies	3964	" He sought for utterance , and spluttered . "
145614	145618	145619	145621	The Bloody Bullies	3964	" he shouted . "
145623	145636	145619	145621	The Bloody Bullies	3964	" He ceased to weep . He became suddenly rapid and explanatory . "
145785	145791	145792	145792	I	0	" He broke down again . "
145841	145892	145893	145893	I	0	" They sprung things on me this morning , things I did n't expect . They rushed me ! I 'd got it all in my hands and then I was jumped . By Neal ! Neal I 've given city tips to ! Neal ! I 've helped Neal .... "

Kingdoms Caesar never knew .... Under entirely new management . "
151012	151133	150988	150988	He	731	" It was hard at times to tell when his sane talk ceased and his delirium began . The secret springs of his life , the vain imaginations were revealed . I sometimes think that all the life of man sprawls abed , careless and unkempt , until it must needs clothe and wash itself and come forth seemly in act and speech for the encounter with one 's fellow - men . I suspect that all things unspoken in our souls partake somewhat of the laxity of delirium and dementia . Certainly from those slimy , tormented lips above the bristling grey beard came nothing but dreams and disconnected fancies .... Sometimes he raved about Neal , threatened Neal . "
151140	151144	150988	150988	He	731	" he said . "

151224	151751	151220	151220	you're	480	" Towards the end it became evident our identity was discovered . I found the press , and especially Boom 's section of it , had made a sort of hue and cry for us , sent special commissioners to hunt for us , and though none of these emissaries reached us until my uncle was dead , one felt the forewash of that storm of energy . The thing got into the popular French press . People became curious in their manner towards us , and a number of fresh faces appeared about the weak little struggle that went on in the closeness behind the curtains of the bed . The young doctor insisted on consultations , and a motor - car came up from Biarritz , and suddenly odd people with questioning eyes began to poke in with inquiries and help . Though nothing was said , I could feel that we were no longer regarded as simple middle - class tourists ; about me , as I went , I perceived almost as though it trailed visibly , the prestige of Finance and a criminal notoriety . Local personages of a plump and prosperous quality appeared in the inn making inquiries , the Luzon priest became helpful , people watched our window , and stared at me as I went to and fro ; and then we had a raid from a little English clergyman and his amiable , capable wife in severely Anglican blacks , who swooped down upon us like virtuous but resolute vultures from the adjacent village of Saint Jean de Pollack . The clergyman was one of those odd types that oscillate between remote country towns in England and the conduct of English Church services on mutual terms in enterprising hotels abroad , a tremulous , obstinate little being with sporadic hairs upon his face , spectacles , a red button nose , and aged black raiment . He was evidently enormously impressed by my uncle 's monetary greatness , and by his own inkling of our identity , and he shone and brimmed over with tact and fussy helpfulness . He was eager to share the watching of the bedside with me , he proffered services with both hands , and as I was now getting into touch with affairs in London again , and trying to disentangle the gigantic details of the smash from the papers I had succeeded in getting from Biarritz , I accepted his offers pretty generously , and began the studies in modern finance that lay before me . I had got so out of touch with the old traditions of religion that I overlooked the manifest possibility of his attacking my poor , sinking vestiges of an uncle with theological solicitudes . My attention was called to that , however , very speedily by a polite but urgent quarrel between himself and the Basque landlady as to the necessity of her hanging a cheap crucifix in the shadow over the bed , where it might catch my uncle 's eye , where , indeed , I found it had caught his eye . "
151755	151759	151752	151753	Good Lord	673	" I cried ; "
151766	151830	151752	151753	Good Lord	673	" That night the little clergyman watched , and in the small hours he raised a false alarm that my uncle was dying , and made an extraordinary fuss . He raised the house . I shall never forget that scene , I think , which began with a tapping at my bedroom door just after I had fallen asleep , and his voice- "
151847	151916	151917	151918	Mr. Ponderevo	351	" The stuffy little room was crowded when I reached it , and lit by three flickering candles . I felt I was back in the eighteenth century . There lay my poor uncle amidst indescribably tumbled bedclothes , weary of life beyond measure , weary and rambling , and the little clergyman trying to hold his hand and his attention , and repeating over and over again : "
151933	151949	151954	151955	the doctor	958	" Only Believe ! ' Believe on me , and ye shall be saved ' ! "
152190	152194	152195	152195	he	4139	" I think , "

154108	154246	154247	154247	She	1458	" Who would have thought , when I used to darn your stockings at old Wimblehurst , that this would be the end of the story ? It seems far away now - that little shop , his and my first home . The glow of the bottles , the big coloured bottles ! Do you remember how the light shone on the mahogany drawers ? The little gilt letters ! Ol Amjig , and Snap ! I can remember it all - bright and shining - like a Dutch picture . Real ! And yesterday . And here we are in a dream . You a man - and me an old woman , George . And poor little Teddy , who used to rush about and talk - making that noise he did - Oh ! "
154286	154316	154268	154268	She	1458	" Just an hour in the old shop again - and him talking . Before things got done . Before they got hold of him . And fooled him . "
154329	154338	154339	154339	she	1458	" They did n't hurt him , George ? "
154350	154356	154357	154357	she	1458	" Here , I mean , "
154360	154363	154357	154357	she	1458	" No , "
154384	154399	154400	154400	She	1458	" I wonder , George , if they 'll let him talk in Heaven .... "
154404	154676	154400	154400	She	1458	" Oh ! George , dear , my heart aches , and I do n't know what I say and do . Give me your arm to lean on - it 's good to have you , dear , and lean upon you .... Yes , I know you care for me . That 's why I 'm talking . We 've always loved one another , and never said anything about it , and you understand , and I understand . But my heart 's torn to pieces by this , torn to rags , and things drop out I 've kept in it . It 's true he was n't a husband much for me at the last . But he was my child , George , he was my child and all my children , my silly child , and life has knocked him about for me , and I 've never had a say in the matter ; never a say ; it 's puffed him up and smashed him - like an old bag - under my eyes . I was clever enough to see it , and not clever enough to prevent it , and all I could do was to jeer . I 've had to make what I could of it . Like most people . Like most of us .... But it was n't fair , George . It was n't fair . Life and Death - great serious things - why could n't they leave him alone , and his lies and ways ? If WE could see the lightness of it- "
154685	154736	154680	154680	they	4196	" she repeated in a whisper as we went towards the inn . When I came back I found that my share in the escape and death of my uncle had made me for a time a notorious and even popular character . For two weeks I was kept in London "
154741	155202	155203	155203	YOU	4198	" as he would have said , and making things easy for my aunt , and I still marvel at the consideration with which the world treated me . For now it was open and manifest that I and my uncle were no more than specimens of a modern species of brigand , wasting the savings of the public out of the sheer wantonness of enterprise . I think that in a way , his death produced a reaction in my favour and my flight , of which some particulars now appeared stuck in the popular imagination . It seemed a more daring and difficult feat than it was , and I could n't very well write to the papers to sustain my private estimate . There can be little doubt that men infinitely prefer the appearance of dash and enterprise to simple honesty . No one believed I was not an arch plotter in his financing . Yet they favoured me . I even got permission from the trustee to occupy my chalet for a fortnight while I cleared up the mass of papers , calculations , notes of work , drawings and the like , that I left in disorder when I started on that impulsive raid upon the Mordet quap heaps . I was there alone . I got work for Cothope with the Ilchesters , for whom I now build these destroyers . They wanted him at once , and he was short of money , so I let him go and managed very philosophically by myself . But I found it hard to fix my attention on aeronautics , I had been away from the work for a full half - year and more , a half - year crowded with intense disconcerting things . For a time my brain refused these fine problems of balance and adjustment altogether ; it wanted to think about my uncle 's dropping jaw , my aunt 's reluctant tears , about dead negroes and pestilential swamps , about the evident realities of cruelty and pain , about life and death . Moreover , it was weary with the frightful pile of figures and documents at the Hardingham , a task to which this raid to Lady Grove was simply an interlude . And there was Beatrice . On the second morning , as I sat out upon the veranda recalling memories and striving in vain to attend to some too succinct pencil notes of Cothope 's , Beatrice rode up suddenly from behind the pavilion , and pulled rein and became still ; Beatrice , a little flushed from riding and sitting on a big black horse . I did not instantly rise . I stared at her . "
155205	155215	155216	155216	Me	0	" I said . She looked at me steadily . "
155218	155244	155216	155216	Me	0	" she said I did not trouble about any civilities . I stood up and asked point blank a question that came into my head . "

155441	155446	155451	155451	I	0	" she remarked irrelevantly , "
155456	155473	155451	155451	I	0	" She swung herself down into my arms , and stood beside me face to face . "
155478	155482	155451	155451	I	0	" she asked . "
155485	155509	155451	155451	I	0	" Her eyes flitted to the pavilion and back to me . We stood close together , extraordinarily intimate , and extraordinarily apart . "
155519	155523	155517	155517	yours	0	" she said , "
155529	155549	155525	155525	I	0	" She flung the bridle of her horse round the veranda post , and I helped her tie it . "
155560	155564	155551	155551	you	0	" she asked . "
155567	155571	155551	155551	you	0	" I said , "

155588	155629	155572	155572	I	0	" She walked before me into the living - room of the chalet , and I saw that she gripped her riding - whip very tightly in her hand . She looked about her for a moment,-and then at me . "
155634	155685	155686	155686	You	4203	" she remarked . Our eyes met in a conversation very different from the one upon our lips . A sombre glow surrounded us , drew us together ; an unwonted shyness kept us apart . She roused herself , after an instant 's pause , to examine my furniture . "
155751	155777	155734	155734	I	0	" She flitted to my colour prints and my little case of books . Then she went to the pianola . I watched her intently . "
155783	155787	155734	155734	I	0	" she said . "
155790	155794	155734	155734	I	0	" I asked . "
155800	155808	155810	155824	a musical gorilla with fingers all of one length . And a sort of soul	4208	" I roused myself from my preoccupation . "
155836	155837	155840	155840	you	0	" "
155843	155844	155845	155845	Beethoven	474	" "
155885	155897	155880	155880	Beethoven	474	" Silence again between us . She spoke with an effort . "
155902	155932	155880	155880	Beethoven	474	" She turned from me and explored the rack of music rolls , became interested and took a piece , the first part of the Kreutzer Sonata , hesitated . "
155935	155939	155880	155880	Beethoven	474	" she said , "
155942	155971	155972	155972	I	0	" She gave me Brahms ' Second Concerto , Op . 58 , and curled up on the sofa watching me as I set myself slowly to play .... "
155975	155983	155972	155972	I	0	" he said when I had done , "
156004	156016	156017	156017	I	0	" She came and stood over me , looking at me . "
156025	156041	156017	156017	I	0	" she said abruptly , and laughed uneasily and hovered at the pigeon - holes . "
156050	156158	156159	156159	Beatrice	409	" She chose more of Brahms . Then we came to the Kreutzer Sonata . It is queer how Tolstoy has loaded that with suggestions , debauched it , made it a scandalous and intimate symbol . When I had played the first part of that , she came up to the pianola and hesitated over me . I sat stiffly - waiting . Suddenly she seized my downcast head and kissed my hair . She caught at my face between her hands and kissed my lips . I put my arms about her and we kissed together . I sprang to my feet and clasped her . "
156161	156165	156166	156166	Beatrice	409	" I said . "
156168	156169	156166	156166	Beatrice	409	" "
156173	156186	156166	156166	Beatrice	409	" she whispered , nearly breathless , with her arms about me . "
156192	156332	156166	156166	Beatrice	409	" Love , like everything else in this immense process of social disorganisation in which we live , is a thing adrift , a fruitless thing broken away from its connexions . I tell of this love affair here because of its irrelevance , because it is so remarkable that it should mean nothing , and be nothing except itself . It glows in my memory like some bright casual flower starting up amidst the debris of a catastrophe . For nearly a fortnight we two met and made love together . Once more this mighty passion , that our aimless civilisation has fettered and maimed and sterilised and debased , gripped me and filled me with passionate delights and solemn joys - that were all , you know , futile and purposeless . Once more I had the persuasion "
156344	156686	156687	156687	We	4212	" We were both infinitely grave in such happiness as we had . I do not remember any laughter at all between us . Twelve days it lasted from that encounter in my chalet until our parting . Except at the end , they were days of supreme summer , and there was a waxing moon . We met recklessly day by day . We were so intent upon each other at first so intent upon expressing ourselves to each other , and getting at each other , that we troubled very little about the appearance of our relationship . We met almost openly .... We talked of ten thousand things , and of ourselves . We loved . We made love . There is no prose of mine that can tell of hours transfigured . The facts are nothing . Everything we touched , the meanest things , became glorious . How can I render bare tenderness and delight and mutual possession ? I sit here at my desk thinking of untellable things . I have come to know so much of love that I know now what love might be . We loved , scarred and stained ; we parted - basely and inevitably , but at least I met love . I remember as we sat in a Canadian canoe , in a reedy , bush - masked shallow we had discovered operating out of that pine - shaded Woking canal , how she fell talking of the things that happened to her before she met me again .... She told me things , and they so joined and welded together other things that lay disconnected in my memory , that it seemed to me I had always known what she told me . And yet indeed I had not known nor suspected it , save perhaps for a luminous , transitory suspicion ever and again . She made me see how life had shaped her . She told me of her girlhood after I had known her . "
156725	156729	156719	156719	I	0	" She paused . "
156735	156756	156731	156731	Carnaby	608	" I remained quite still . She spoke now with downcast eyes , and one finger just touching the water . "
156867	156871	156859	156859	I	0	" She stopped . "
156873	156885	156859	156859	I	0	knew?"-she asked , looking up , quite steadily . I nodded . "

156909	156916	156903	156903	I	0	" She looked at me quietly . "

157012	157026	157027	157027	I	0	" And suddenly she dropped her face upon her hands , and sobbed passionately- "
157033	157049	157030	157030	I	0	" she cried , and became still .... I dabbled my paddle in the water . "
157053	157057	157030	157030	I	0	" I said ; "
157072	157089	157091	157091	me	0	" She shook her head without looking up . We were still for a long time . "
157093	157111	157112	157112	I	0	" I whispered . She looked up , twined back a whisp of hair , and answered dispassionately- "
157177	157178	157168	157168	we	4225	" "
157181	157185	157168	157168	we	4225	" I asked . "

157229	157242	157195	157195	You	0	" said I. She looked at me gravely , with extended finger . "
157260	157264	157254	157254	you	0	" I hesitated . "
157274	157278	157268	157268	I	0	" she insisted . "
157414	157433	157406	157406	I	0	" She stopped at my gesture . I sat up , and the canoe rocked with my movement . "
157439	157443	157434	157434	I	0	" I said . "
157455	157456	157434	157434	I	0	" "

157504	157512	157490	157490	you	0	" I cried , disconcerted beyond measure , "
157535	157544	157526	157526	you	0	" She flung out her hands at me . "
157550	157554	157526	157526	you	0	" she cried . "
157673	157689	157666	157666	We	4240	" She suddenly knelt forward toward me , with a glowing darkness in her eyes . "
157696	157700	157666	157666	We	4240	" she cried . "
157719	157811	157813	157813	she	4242	" I 'm not afraid of that . I 'm not a bit afraid of that . I 'll die with you . Choose a death , and I 'll die with you - readily . Do listen to me ! I love you . I shall always love you . It 's because I love you that I wo n't go down to become a dirty familiar thing with you amidst the grime . I 've given all I can . I 've had all I can .... Tell me , "
157817	157879	157813	157813	she	4242	" have I been like the dusk to you , like the warm dusk ? Is there magic still ? Listen to the ripple of water from your paddle . Look at the warm evening light in the sky . Who cares if the canoe upsets ? Come nearer to me . Oh , my love ! come near ! So . "
158092	158096	158097	158097	I	0	" And now , "
158100	158106	158097	158097	I	0	" will you marry me ? "
158107	158110	158111	158111	she	409	" No , "
158114	158123	158111	158111	she	409	" I shall keep to my life here . "
158141	158149	158150	158150	I	0	" This world is a soft world , "
158153	158187	158150	158150	I	0	" in spite of my present disasters . I know now how to do things . If I had you to work for - in a year I could be a prosperous man . "
158188	158191	158192	158192	she	409	" No , "
158195	158209	158192	158192	she	409	" I will put it brutally , I shall go back to Carnaby . "
158210	158213	158150	158150	I	0	" But- ! "
158251	158255	158256	158256	she	409	" Look here , "
158259	158316	158256	158256	she	409	" I have been awake all night and every night . I have been thinking of this - every moment when we have not been together . I 'm not answering you on an impulse . I love you . I love you . I 'll say that over ten thousand times . But here we are- "
158317	158324	158325	158325	I	0	" The rest of life together , "
158328	158363	158325	158325	I	0	" It would n't be together . Now we are together . Now we have been together . We are full of memories I do not feel I can ever forget a single one . "
158364	158367	158256	158256	she	409	" Nor I. "
158368	158393	158394	158394	She	4246	" And I want to close it and leave it at that . You see , dear , what else is there to do ? "
158402	158489	158394	158394	She	4246	" All I know of love , all I have ever dreamt or learnt of love I have packed into these days for you . You think we might live together and go on loving . No ! For you I will have no vain repetitions . You have had the best and all of me . Would you have us , after this , meet again in London or Paris or somewhere , scuffle to some wretched dressmaker 's , meet in a cabinet particulier ? "
158490	158493	158494	158494	I	0	" No , "
158497	158538	158494	158494	I	0	" I want you to marry me . I want you to play the game of life with me as an honest woman should . Come and live with me . Be my wife and squaw . Bear me children . "
158564	158570	158571	158571	I	0	" My God ! Beatrice ! "
158574	158700	158571	158571	I	0	" but this is cowardice and folly ! Are you afraid of life ? You of all people ! What does it matter what has been or what we were ? Here we are with the world before us ! Start clean and new with me . We 'll fight it through ! I 'm not such a simple lover that I 'll not tell you plainly when you go wrong , and fight our difference out with you . It 's the one thing I want , the one thing I need - to have you , and more of you and more ! This love - making - it 's love - making . It 's just a part of us , an incident- "
158710	158715	158716	158716	she	4248	" It 's all , "
158719	158722	158723	158723	I	0	" All ! "
158726	158737	158723	158723	I	0	" I 'm wiser than you . Wiser beyond words . "
158750	158765	158766	158766	she	4248	" I would n't have you say anything - but what you 're saying , "
158769	158787	158766	158766	she	4248	" But it 's nonsense , dear . You know it 's nonsense as you say it . "
158805	158811	158812	158812	she	4248	" It 's no good , "
158817	158901	158812	158812	she	4248	" This little world has made us what we are . Do n't you see - don't you see what I am ? I can make love . I can make love and be loved , prettily . Dear , do n't blame me . I have given you all I have . If I had anything more - I have gone through it all over and over again - thought it out . This morning my head aches , my eyes ache . "
158952	159122	158948	158948	I	0	" I 'm spoilt by this rich idle way of living , until every habit is wrong , every taste wrong . The world is wrong . People can be ruined by wealth just as much as by poverty . Do you think I would n't face life with you if I could , if I was n't absolutely certain I should be down and dragging in the first half - mile of the journey ? Here I am - damned ! Damned ! But I wo n't damn you . You know what I am ! You know . You are too clear and simple not to know the truth . You try to romance and hector , but you know the truth . I am a little cad - sold and done . I'm- . My dear , you think I 've been misbehaving , but all these days I 've been on my best behaviour .... You do n't understand , because you 're a man . "
159144	159150	159140	159140	She	1864	" She walked on weeping . "
159159	159163	159151	159151	You	4254	" she said . "
159192	159205	159208	159208	you	4254	" She dashed the tears from her eyes and turned upon me . "
159211	159215	159208	159208	you	4254	" she challenged . "
159221	159232	159218	159218	you	4254	" We faced one another in silence for a moment . "
159235	159239	159240	159240	I	0	" I said , "
159243	159282	159240	159240	I	0	" For a long time we spoke never a word , but walked on together , slowly and sorrowfully , reluctant to turn about towards our parting . When at last we did , she broke silence again . "
159288	159292	159283	159283	I	0	" she said . "
159297	159301	159283	159283	I	0	" I said , "
159307	159308	159283	159283	I	0	" "
159312	159317	159283	159283	I	0	" she went on . "
159376	159393	159371	159371	my	0	" To this day I can not determine whether she said or whether I imagined she said "
159396	159476	159477	159477	Yours	4254	" Perhaps a half - conscious diagnosis flashed it on my brain . Perhaps I am the victim of some perverse imaginative freak of memory , some hinted possibility that scratched and seared . There the word stands in my memory , as if it were written in fire . We came to the door of Lady Osprey 's garden at last , and it was beginning to drizzle . She held out her hands and I took them . "
159479	159489	159477	159477	Yours	4254	" she said , in a weary unimpassioned voice ; "
159504	159505	159501	159501	you	4254	" "
159508	159512	159501	159501	you	4254	" I answered . "
159522	159523	159501	159501	you	4254	" "
159526	159527	159501	159501	you	4254	" "
159531	159563	159528	159528	You	4254	" she said . We looked at one another in silence , and her face full of fatigue and misery . What could I do ? What was there to do ? "
159566	159573	159528	159528	You	4254	" I said , and stopped . "
159578	159834	159501	159501	you	4254	" That should have been the last I saw of her , but , indeed , I was destined to see her once again . Two days after I was at Lady Grove , I forget altogether upon what errand , and as I walked back to the station believing her to be gone away she came upon me , and she was riding with Carnaby , just as I had seen them first . The encounter jumped upon us unprepared . She rode by , her eyes dark in her white face , and scarcely noticed me . She winced and grew stiff at the sight of me and bowed her head . But Carnaby , because he thought I was a broken and discomfited man , saluted me with an easy friendliness , and shouted some genial commonplace to me . They passed out of sight and left me by the roadside .... And then , indeed , I tasted the ultimate bitterness of life . For the first time I felt utter futility , and was wrung by emotion that begot no action , by shame and pity beyond words . I had parted from her dully and I had seen my uncle break and die with dry eyes and a steady mind , but this chance sight of my lost Beatrice brought me to tears . My face was wrung , and tears came pouring down my cheeks . All the magic she had for me had changed to wild sorrow . "
159838	159842	159501	159501	you	4254	" I cried , "
159848	160806	159501	159501	you	4254	" and turned my face after her and made appealing gestures to the beech trees and cursed at fate . I wanted to do preposterous things , to pursue her , to save her , to turn life back so that she might begin again . I wonder what would have happened had I overtaken them in pursuit , breathless with running , uttering incoherent words , weeping , expostulatory . I came near to doing that . There was nothing in earth or heaven to respect my curses or weeping . In the midst of it a man who had been trimming the opposite hedge appeared and stared at me . Abruptly , ridiculously , I dissembled before him and went on and caught my train .... But the pain I felt then I have felt a hundred times ; it is with me as I write . It haunts this book , I see , that is what haunts this book , from end to end . I have tried throughout all this story to tell things as they happened to me . In the beginning - the sheets are still here on the table , grimy and dogs - eared and old - looking - I said I wanted to tell MYSELF and the world in which I found myself , and I have done my best . But whether I have succeeded I can not imagine . All this writing is grey now and dead and trite and unmeaning to me ; some of it I know by heart . I am the last person to judge it . As I turn over the big pile of manuscript before me certain things become clearer to me , and particularly the immense inconsequences of my experiences . It is , I see now that I have it all before me , a story of activity and urgency and sterility . I have called it Tono - Bungay , but I had far better have called it Waste . I have told of childless Marion , of my childless aunt , of Beatrice wasted and wasteful and futile . What hope is there for a people whose women become fruitless ? I think of all the energy I have given to vain things . I think of my industrious scheming with my uncle , of Crest Hill 's vast cessation , of his resonant strenuous career . Ten thousand men have envied him and wished to live as he lived . It is all one spectacle of forces running to waste , of people who use and do not replace , the story of a country hectic with a wasting aimless fever of trade and money - making and pleasure - seeking . And now I build destroyers ! Other people may see this country in other terms ; this is how I have seen it . In some early chapter in this heap I compared all our present colour and abundance to October foliage before the frosts nip down the leaves . That I still feel was a good image . Perhaps I see wrongly . It may be I see decay all about me because I am , in a sense , decay . To others it may be a scene of achievement and construction radiant with hope . I , too , have a sort of hope , but it is a remote hope , a hope that finds no promise in this Empire or in any of the great things of our time . How they will look in history I do not know , how time and chance will prove them I can not guess ; that is how they have mirrored themselves on one contemporary mind . Concurrently with writing the last chapter of this book I have been much engaged by the affairs of a new destroyer we have completed . It has been an oddly complementary alternation of occupations . Three weeks or so ago this novel had to be put aside in order that I might give all my time day and night to the fitting and finishing of the engines . Last Thursday X 2 , for so we call her , was done and I took her down the Thames and went out nearly to Texel for a trial of speed . It is curious how at times one 's impressions will all fuse and run together into a sort of unity and become continuous with things that have hitherto been utterly alien and remote . That rush down the river became mysteriously connected with this book . As I passed down the Thames I seemed in a new and parallel manner to be passing all England in review . I saw it then as I had wanted my readers to see it . The thought came to me slowly as I picked my way through the Pool ; it stood out clear as I went dreaming into the night out upon the wide North Sea . It was n't so much thinking at the time as a sort of photographic thought that came and grew clear . X2 went ripping through the dirty oily water as scissors rip through canvas , and the front of my mind was all intent with getting her through under the bridges and in and out among the steam - boats and barges and rowing - boats and piers . I lived with my hands and eyes hard ahead . I thought nothing then of any appearances but obstacles , but for all that the back of my mind took the photographic memory of it complete and vivid .... "

160832	161013	161016	161016	you	4258	" We started in the late afternoon . We throbbed out of our yard above Hammersmith Bridge , fussed about for a moment , and headed down stream . We came at an easy rush down Craven Reach , past Fulham and Hurlingham , past the long stretches of muddy meadow And muddy suburb to Battersea and Chelsea , round the cape of tidy frontage that is Grosvenor Road and under Vauxhall Bridge , and Westminster opened before us . We cleared a string of coal barges and there on the left in the October sunshine stood the Parliament houses , and the flag was flying and Parliament was sitting . I saw it at the time unseeingly ; afterwards it came into my mind as the centre of the whole broad panoramic effect of that afternoon . The stiff square lace of Victorian Gothic with its Dutch clock of a tower came upon me suddenly and stared and whirled past in a slow half pirouette and became still , I know , behind me as if watching me recede . "
161024	161933	161016	161016	you	4258	" it seemed to say . Not I ! There in that great pile of Victorian architecture the landlords and the lawyers , the bishops , the railway men and the magnates of commerce go to and fro - in their incurable tradition of commercialised Bladesovery , of meretricious gentry and nobility sold for riches . I have been near enough to know . The Irish and the Labour - men run about among their feet , making a fuss , effecting little , they 've got no better plans that I can see . Respect it indeed ! There 's a certain paraphernalia of dignity , but whom does it deceive ? The King comes down in a gilt coach to open the show and wears long robes and a crown ; and there 's a display of stout and slender legs in white stockings and stout and slender legs in black stockings and artful old gentlemen in ermine . I was reminded of one congested afternoon I had spent with my aunt amidst a cluster of agitated women 's hats in the Royal Gallery of the House of Lords and how I saw the King going to open Parliament , and the Duke of Devonshire looking like a gorgeous pedlar and terribly bored with the cap of maintenance on a tray before him hung by slings from his shoulder . A wonderful spectacle ! It is quaint , no doubt , this England - it is even dignified in places - and full of mellow associations . That does not alter the quality of the realities these robes conceal . The realities are greedy trade , base profit - seeking , bold advertisement ; and kingship and chivalry , spite of this wearing of treasured robes , are as dead among it all as that crusader my uncle championed against the nettles outside the Duffield church . I have thought much of that bright afternoon 's panorama . To run down the Thames so is to run one 's hand over the pages in the book of England from end to end . One begins in Craven Reach and it is as if one were in the heart of old England . Behind us are Kew and Hampton Court with their memories of Kings and Cardinals , and one runs at first between Fulham 's episcopal garden parties and Hurlingham 's playground for the sporting instinct of our race . The whole effect is English . There is space , there are old trees and all the best qualities of the home - land in that upper reach . Putney , too , looks Anglican on a dwindling scale . And then for a stretch the newer developments slop over , one misses Bladesover and there come first squalid stretches of mean homes right and left and then the dingy industrialism of the south side , and on the north bank the polite long front of nice houses , artistic , literary , administrative people 's residences , that stretches from Cheyne Walk nearly to Westminster and hides a wilderness of slums . What a long slow crescendo that is , mile after mile , with the houses crowding closelier , the multiplying succession of church towers , the architectural moments , the successive bridges , until you come out into the second movement of the piece with Lambeth 's old palace under your quarter and the houses of Parliament on your bow ! Westminster Bridge is ahead of you then , and through it you flash , and in a moment the round - faced clock tower cranes up to peer at you again and New Scotland Yard squares at you , a fat beef - eater of a policeman disguised miraculously as a Bastille . For a stretch you have the essential London ; you have Charing Cross railway station , heart of the world , and the Embankment on the north side with its new hotels overshadowing its Georgian and Victorian architecture , and mud and great warehouses and factories , chimneys , shot towers , advertisements on the south . The northward skyline grows more intricate and pleasing , and more and more does one thank God for Wren . Somerset House is as picturesque as the civil war , one is reminded again of the original England , one feels in the fretted sky the quality of Restoration Lace . And then comes Astor 's strong box and the lawyers ' Inns . ( I had a passing memory of myself there , how once I had trudged along the Embankment westward , weighing my uncle 's offer of three hundred pounds a year .... ) Through that central essential London reach I drove , and X2 bored her nose under the foam regardless of it all like a black hound going through reeds - on what trail even I who made her can not tell . And in this reach , too , one first meets the seagulls and is reminded of the sea . Blackfriars one takes - just under these two bridges and just between them is the finest bridge moment in the world - and behold , soaring up , hanging in the sky over a rude tumult of warehouses , over a jostling competition of traders , irrelevantly beautiful and altogether remote , Saint Paul 's !

161946	162712	161016	161016	you	4258	" It is the very figure of whatever fineness the old Anglican culture achieved , detached , a more dignified and chastened Saint Peter 's , colder , greyer , but still ornate ; it has never been over thrown , never disavowed , only the tall warehouses and all the roar of traffic have forgotten it , every one has forgotten it ; the steamships , the barges , go heedlessly by regardless of it , intricacies of telephone wires and poles cut blackly into its thin mysteries , and presently , when in a moment the traffic permits you and you look round for it , it has dissolved like a cloud into the grey blues of the London sky . And then the traditional and ostensible England falls from you altogether . The third movement begins , the last great movement in the London symphony , in which the trim scheme of the old order is altogether dwarfed and swallowed up . Comes London Bridge , and the great warehouses tower up about you , waving stupendous cranes , the gulls circle and scream in your ears , large ships lie among their lighters , and one is in the port of the world . Again and again in this book I have written of England as a feudal scheme overtaken by fatty degeneration and stupendous accidents of hypertrophy . For the last time I must strike that note as the memory of the dear neat little sunlit ancient Tower of London lying away in a gap among the warehouses comes back to me , that little accumulation of buildings so provincially pleasant and dignified , overshadowed by the vulgarest , most typical exploit of modern England , the sham Gothic casings to the ironwork of the Tower Bridge . That Tower Bridge is the very balance and confirmation of Westminster 's dull pinnacles and tower . That sham Gothic bridge ; in the very gates of our mother of change , the Sea ! But after that one is in a world of accident and nature . For the third part of the panorama of London is beyond all law , order , and precedence ; it is the seaport and the sea . One goes down the widening reaches through a monstrous variety of shipping , great steamers , great sailing - ships , trailing the flags of all the world , a monstrous confusion of lighters , witches ' conferences of brown - sailed barges , wallowing tugs , a tumultuous crowding and jostling of cranes and spars , and wharves and stores , and assertive inscriptions . Huge vistas of dock open right and left of one , and here and there beyond and amidst it all are church towers , little patches of indescribably old - fashioned and worn - out houses , riverside pubs and the like , vestiges of townships that were long since torn to fragments and submerged in these new growths . And amidst it all no plan appears , no intention , no comprehensive desire . That is the very key of it all . Each day one feels that the pressure of commerce and traffic grew , grew insensibly monstrous , and first this man made a wharf and that erected a crane , and then this company set to work and then that , and so they jostled together to make this unassimilable enormity of traffic . Through it we dodged and drove eager for the high seas . I remember how I laughed aloud at the glimpse of the name of a London County Council steamboat that ran across me . Caxton it was called , and another was Pepys , and another was Shakespeare . They seemed so wildly out of place , splashing about in that confusion . One wanted to take them out and wipe them and put them back in some English gentleman 's library . Everything was alive about them , flashing , splashing , and passing , ships moving , tugs panting , hawsers taut , barges going down with men toiling at the sweeps , the water all a - swirl with the wash of shipping , scaling into millions of little wavelets , curling and frothing under the whip of the unceasing wind . Past it all we drove . And at Greenwich to the south , you know , there stands a fine stone frontage where all the victories are recorded in a Painted Hall , and beside it is the "
