394	507	381	381	I	0	' and he turned his face towards the square of grey sky framed by the window . There was hardly more pleasantness left in his life than in the dreary rain - washed garden outside . And yet his life had not been without its triumphs — as the world counts success . He had , when still young , married the woman he passionately loved , and work for her sake had seemed so easy that he had risen from poverty to competence , and from competence to wealth . Born in the poorest ranks of the workers in a crowded Stockport alley , he had started in life as a mill '
510	1080	381	381	I	0	' and he was ending it now a millowner , and master of many hands . He had himself been taught in no school but that of life ; but he did not attribute his own success to his education any more than he did the fatuous failure of some University men to their peculiar training ; so he had sent his sons to Cambridge , and had lived to see them leave their college well - grown and handsome , with not more than the average stock of prejudices and follies , and fit to be compared , not unfavourably , with any young men in the county . But by some fatality he had never tasted the full sweetness of any of the fruit his life - tree had borne him . His parents had died in want and misery at a time when he himself was too poor to help them . His wife , who had bravely shared his earlier struggles , did not live to share their reward . She patiently bore the trials of their early married life , but in the comfort that was to follow she had no part . She died , and left him almost broken - hearted . Her memory would always be the dearest thing in the world to him ; but a man 's warm , living , beating heart needs something more than a memory to lavish its love upon . This something more he found in her children . In them all his hopes had been centred ; for them all his efforts had been made . They were , individually , all that he had dreamed they might be , and they were both devoted to him ; and yet , as he lay on his deathbed , his mind was ill at ease about them . Did he exaggerate ? Was it weakness and illness , the beginning of the end , that had made him think , through these last few weeks , that there was growing up between these two beloved sons a coolness — a want of sympathy , an indisposition to run well in harness together — which might lead to sore trouble ? There certainly had been one or two slight quarrels between them which had been made up through his own intervention . How would it be , he wondered , when he was not there any more to smooth things over ? Somehow he did not feel that he cared to live any longer , even to keep peace between his boys . That must be done some other way . Truth to say , he was very tired of being alive . The October day faded , and presently the sick - room was lighted only by the red flickering glow of the fire , which threw strange fantastic shadows from the handsome commonplace furniture , and made the portraits on the walls seem to look out of their frames with quite new expressions . Old Ferrier lay looking at the pictures in a tremor of expectation that made the time seem very long indeed . At last his strained sense caught the faint click of the Brahma lock as it was opened by a key from without , and the bang of the front door as it was closed somewhat hurriedly from within . '
1085	1091	381	381	I	0	' he said at once . '
1098	1165	1096	1096	Letitia	108	' As she laid her hand on the door to open it , another hand grasped the handle on the other side , and a tall , broad - shouldered young fellow came in , with the glisten of rain still on his brown moustache , and on his great - coat , seeming to bring with him a breath of freshness and the night air .

1226	1242	1192	1192	father	301	' said the new - comer , stepping forward into the glow of the firelight . '
1247	1298	1192	1192	father	301	' said his father , without answering the question , and the young man lighted two in heavy silver candlesticks which stood on the dressing - table . As their pale light fell on the white face lying against the hardly whiter pillow , Dick 's eyes scrutinised it anxiously . '
1306	1323	1299	1299	You	106	' he said , sitting down by the bed , and taking his father 's hand . '

1391	1410	1373	1374	the other	305	' but what did the doctor say ? Aunt Letitia did n't seem to know anything about it . '
1411	1424	1426	1428	the old man	297	' He told me I should n't live to see another birthday , '
1471	1477	1453	1453	he	297	' Not see another birthday ! '
1482	1489	1490	1490	he	297	' Nonsense ! Why , father , '
1498	1515	1490	1490	he	297	' your birthday 's on Wednesday . How could he ? I 'll write to him . '
1516	1554	1490	1490	he	297	' My dear boy , I felt it before he told me . He only put into words what I 've known ever since I 've been lying here . There 's no getting over it . I 'm
1557	1598	1490	1490	he	297	' Dick did not speak . He pressed his father 's hand hard , and then , letting it fall , he walked over to the hearthrug , and stood with his hands behind him , looking into the fire . '

1633	1665	1625	1625	I	0	' he said , in very much lower tones than usual , as he sat down again by the bed . He kept his face in the shadow of the curtain . '

1779	1837	1763	1763	himself	107	' for God 's sake , do n't quarrel with him ! If you ever cared for me , keep friends with him . If you and he were n't friends , I could n't lie easy in my grave . And it 's been a long life — I should like to lie easy at last ! '

1934	1971	1920	1920	Roland	107	' The young man stood silently for a few moments . Then he bent down over his father and kissed his forehead twice . When he left the room he met a servant on the landing . '
1979	1980	1973	1974	Mr Roland	107	' '

2018	2176	2006	2007	Miss Ferrier	111	' He turned and went to his own room . A quarter of an hour later Roland stood outside his father 's door . He opened it gently , and entered , his slippered feet treading the floor of the sick - room as silently as a nurse 's . As he stood a moment in the dim light , eyes less keen and less expectant than those looking at him from the bed might have easily mistaken him for his brother . The slight difference in breadth of shoulder and depth of chest was concealed by the loose indoor jacket he wore . There was no trace about him of his wet and muddy walk , and he looked altogether a much fitter occupant for the easy - chair that stood at the sick man 's bedside than the stalwart , weather - stained , and unsympathetic - looking figure that had last sat in it . '
2186	2192	2006	2007	Miss Ferrier	111	' began the old man . '
2234	2235	2229	2229	you	112	' '
2243	2249	2251	2251	he	2894	' was all the answer . '

2313	2332	2309	2309	I	0	' said Roland in an altered tone , and with a look of new anxiety in his face . '
2348	2349	2339	2339	I	0	' '
2387	2398	2385	2385	Rowley	112	' he added , catching both his son 's arms ; '
2407	2475	2478	2478	father	301	' For a moment the young man had hardly seemed to realise what the words meant ; but now a long , anxious , eager look at his father 's face made the truth clear to him . An intense anguish came into his face , and throwing his arms round the other 's neck , he fell on his knees in a burst of passionate tears . '
2513	2543	2544	2544	Rowley	112	' The old man caressed him silently . There was a sort of pleasure in feeling oneself regretted with this passion of sorrow and longing . After a while . '
2546	2560	2561	2561	I	0	' said he , as the sobs grew less frequent and less violent , '
2562	2573	2544	2544	Rowley	112	'm going to ask you to do something for me . '
2574	2586	2561	2561	I	0	' Anything you like , father — the harder the better . '
2587	2613	2544	2544	Rowley	112	' It ought not to be very hard to you , my son . Promise me that you will always keep good friends with Dick . '
2614	2624	2544	2544	Rowley	112	' Yes — yes — I will , indeed . '
2673	2691	2693	2693	his	107	' Have me called at once if you are worse — or if I can do anything , '
2716	2720	2721	2723	the old man	297	' I want — '
2726	2740	2721	2723	the old man	297	' You want your beef tea , Richard , and here it is . '
2749	2759	2745	2745	he	297	' Is it too late to send for Gates ? '
2760	2777	2778	2779	Mr Gates	114	' Oh , no ; and it 's such a little way for him to come . '
2986	3030	2970	2970	he	114	' What , Mr Ferrier , still in bed ! Why , we thought old Gibson would have had you on your legs again in no time . I quite expected to see you driving over to the Wirksvale wakes to - morrow . '
3031	3052	3056	3056	I	0	' I shall never go behind any but the black horses again , Gates . It 's no use . I 'm
3064	3065	3056	3056	I	0	' '
3138	3372	3379	3380	Mr Ferrier	107	' In an eager , tremulous voice Ferrier begged the other to believe that his fate was sealed , and that whatever was done must be done quickly . Then he proceeded to explain the changes he wished to have made in the will . He told the lawyer , without any of that reserve which ordinarily characterised him , all his fears about his sons , and then unfolded the scheme by which he thought to bind the two together . He wished their worldly interests to be so strongly bound up in their relations to each other that a quarrel à outrance would mean ruin to both of them ; and to this end he proposed to leave the mill to them jointly , on condition that they worked it together , and both took an active part in the management of it . Should they dissolve partnership before twenty - one years , or should either retire with consent of the other , the personal property was not to be touched by either , and at end of ten years — if they were both alive and still separated — the whole was to go to the Manchester Infirmary . Mr Gates noted this extraordinary scheme down on the back of an old letter , and when Mr Ferrier had ended , read his notes through and shook his head . '
3400	3401	3402	3402	I	0	' '
3436	3437	3481	3482	Mr Gates	114	' '
3442	3454	3455	3455	I	0	' began Gates , his jolly face considerably graver than usual . '
3470	3480	3469	3469	I	0	'm deadly tired , and I want it over . '
3574	3587	3588	3588	he	114	' It is the only way it can be done , sir , '
3723	3728	3730	3731	old Richard	104	' That 's right , '
3789	3791	3786	3786	his	104	' I 'm
3797	3801	3802	3802	I	0	' he said ; '
3807	3843	3802	3802	I	0	' And sleep he did till the cold hour of the dawn , when there came a brief waking interval , before the longest , soundest sleep of all . He opened his eyes then . '
3849	3853	3802	3802	I	0	' he said ; '
3860	4044	3802	3802	I	0	' He called for them both , but it was Dick on whose broad breast the dying head rested . It was Dick who caught the last loving , whispered words , felt the last faint hand pressure , soothed the last pang , caught the last look . For when Aunt Letitia hurried to their rooms , it was Dick who opened his door before she reached it , and , fully dressed , sprang to his father 's bedside . Roland was in the sound sleep that often follows violent emotion , and it was hard to rouse him . He came in softly just as his brother laid gently down on the pillow the worn old face , at rest at last , and closed the kindly eyes that would never meet Roland 's any more . Never any more ! THE curtain had fallen on the last scene of the most popular play in London . The appreciative criticism of the pit and the tearful sympathy of the upper boxes were alike merging in one common thought , that of '
4050	4406	3802	3802	I	0	' The gallery was already empty . Its occupants were thirstier and more prompt of action than the loungers in the stalls and boxes . Ladies , a little flushed by the exertion of fighting their way through the ranks of their peers , were silently disputing for precedence in front of the looking - glasses in the cloak - rooms , while their cavaliers , already invested with overcoat and wrapper , were pacing the carpeted corridor outside with a very poor show of patience . The most impatient of them all was a stout , rubicund old gentleman in a dark coat , who trotted fretfully up and down , and now and then even ventured to peep in through the door at the chaos of silks and laces , raised shawls , and suspended bonnets , in some component part of which he evidently had an interest . His very manifest objection to being kept waiting made his fellow - sufferers glance at him with some amusement . A young man who had been going leisurely towards the outer door actually stopped and leaned against the wall while he rolled himself a cigarette , and from time to time glanced with a certain interest at him . He looked very handsome leaning there ; his light overcoat was open , and showed the gleam of some rather good diamonds in his shirt front . His pose was graceful — his face had less of boredom in it than is usually worn by young men who go to theatres alone . This , with his large dark eyes , Greek nose , and long drooping blonde moustache , gave him a rather striking appearance . He might have been a foreigner but for his want of skill in making cigarettes . The white hands seemed absolutely awkward in their manipulation . Just as his persevering efforts were crowned with success , and the cigarette was placed between his lips , a white muffled figure emerged from the tossing rainbow sea , and a little hand was slipped through the old gentleman 's arm . '
4417	4424	4415	4415	papa	361	' said a very sweet voice . '

4483	4515	4478	4478	I	0	' You may have been the first to go in , but there have been lots of ladies come out while I 've been waiting — dozens , I should say . '
4516	4525	4527	4528	the girl	367	' Could n't we walk back , papa ? '
4530	4552	4527	4528	the girl	367	' It 's a lovely night , and the streets are so interesting . It is n't far , is it ? '
4553	4592	4478	4478	I	0	' No , no — the idea ! Make haste , and we 'll get a cab right enough . Mamma will never let us have a trip together again if I take you back with a cold . '

5201	5224	5263	5263	he	0	' It had been a near shave ; but the old gentleman was unhurt , though considerably flustered , and immeasurably indignant . '
5230	5261	5263	5263	he	0	'm not hurt — no thanks to that fool of a driver ; such idiots ought to be hanged . But I ought to thank the gentleman who saved me . '

5286	5332	5265	5267	the young man	2891	' he said , in a singularly low , soft voice , speaking with a little catching of the breath . It was he who had leaned against the wall in the theatre . His hands were evidently good for something better than twisting tobacco . '

5649	5707	5645	5645	Morley	118	' he shouted to the cabman , and as they drove off he mechanically raised his hand to the place where his hat should have been . Have you ever seen a man do that when hat there was none ? The effect is peculiar — much like a rustic pulling a forelock when t'squire goes by . '
5717	5727	5708	5708	I	0	' said Mr Stanley as the hansom drove off . '

5763	5768	5748	5748	him	0	' Clare was more than '
5771	6031	5748	5748	him	0	' in fact , she knew per fectly well that this handsome stranger was not only staying at the hotel , but that he in his turn was quite aware of their presence there . Of her presence he could hardly be oblivious , since his eyes had been turned on her without much intermission all through dinner every evening since she had been in town . Before Clare went to her room that night she managed to possess herself of the slip of cardboard on which was engraved — Michael Litvinoff . What an uncommon name ! How strange that he of all people should have been the one to come forward at the critical moment . Yes , but not quite so strange as it seemed to Miss Stanley ; for Litvinoff had gone to the theatre for no other purpose than to be near her . It was not only to gaze at her fair face that he thus followed her ; but because he was determined to catch at any straw which might lead to an introduction , and the fates had favoured him , as they had often done before , in a degree beyond his wildest hopes . He was well contented to have lost his hat , and did not care much about his bruised foot . These were a cheap price to pay for admittance to the acquaintance of the girl who had occupied most of his thoughts during the few days that had passed since he had first seen her . '
6075	6092	6062	6062	he	124	' And Michael Litvinoff stretched out his slippered feet to the blazing fire in his bedroom . '
6116	6147	6108	6108	I	0	' He rose , walked with some difficulty to the chair , where he had flung his great - coat , and took the card from one of its pockets . '
6157	6158	6148	6150	Mr John Stanley	119	' '
6162	6172	6160	6160	Jove	125	' he said , sinking into his chair again . '
6187	6251	6185	6185	me	0	' He thrust his feet forward again to the warmth , and leaning back gazed long into the fire , but not quite so complacently as he had done before it had occurred to him to make that journey across the room to his great - coat . THE funeral was over , and Thornsett Mill was closed for the day . Fortunately the '
6254	6425	6160	6160	Jove	125	' was not closed , so that the majority of the hands did not find themselves without resources . Added to the subtle pleasure which so many derive from drinking small beer in a sanded kitchen furnished with oak benches , there was to - day the excitement of discussing a great event , for to the average mind of Thornsett the death and burial of old Richard Ferrier were great events indeed . And then there appears to be something inherent in the nature of a funeral which produces intense and continued thirst in all persons connected , however remotely , with the ceremony . So John Bolt , the landlord , had his hands pretty full , and the state of the till was so satisfactory that it was a really praiseworthy sacrifice to the decencies of society for him to persist in not shortening by one fraction of an inch the respectfully long face which he had put on in the morning as appropriate to the occasion .

9703	9750	9684	9684	he	119	' A turn for languages is like the taste for tea , one of our national characteristics . I suppose the ordinary tongue finds such a difficulty in twisting itself round Russian , that if it can do that it can do anything . Allow me ! '

9837	9852	9824	9825	Miss Stanley	122	' said Litvinoff , rising and making for the piano . Clare followed him . '
9860	9864	9855	9855	I	0	' she said . '
9878	9918	9866	9866	you	361	' Clare sang it . Her voice was not particularly powerful , but she made the most of it , such as it was , and sang with enough expression to make it pleasant to listen to her . After '
9922	9937	9938	9939	Bonnie Doon	144	' came one or two plaintive Scotch airs , and before she was well through '
9941	9989	9938	9939	Bonnie Doon	144	' the accompaniment of her father 's heavy breathing made her aware that her audience was reduced by one - half . The most appreciative half remained , and , when the last notes of the regretful melody had died out , preferred a request for Schubert 's '
9992	10008	9938	9939	Bonnie Doon	144	' This happened to be her favourite song , and she sang it con amore . '
10015	10023	9938	9939	Bonnie Doon	144	' he said when she had finished , '
10041	10049	9938	9939	Bonnie Doon	144	' Clare looked up at him brightly . '

10153	10170	10195	10195	I	0	' The Count 's bold eyes fixed themselves on her with a new interest in them . '
10175	10187	10195	10195	I	0	' he returned with a little backward wave of his hand . '

10288	10302	10277	10277	You	0	' said Clare , a little surprised at the earnestness of his tone . '
10341	10342	10339	10339	you	0	' '
10367	10372	10373	10373	I	0	' Count Litvinoff bowed . '
10402	10428	10429	10429	I	0	' he added , with a complete change of manner , which made any return on her part to the subject of his exile impossible . '
10441	10447	10429	10429	I	0	' she answered , rising . '

10515	10580	10485	10485	you	0	' He took her place at the piano , and , in a low voice , sang a Hungarian air , wild and melancholy , with a despairing minor refrain . While her thanks were being spoken his fingers strayed over the keys , and , almost insensibly as it seemed , fell into a few chords that suggested the air of the Marseillaise . '
10614	10883	10608	10608	I	0	' Without a word he obeyed her , and launched into the famous battle song of Liberty . His singing of the other song had been a whisper , but in this he gave his voice full play , and sang it with a fire , a fervour , a splendid earnestness and enthusiasm , that made the air vibrate , and thrilled Clare through and through with an utterly new emotion . She understood now how this song had been able to stir men to such deeds as she had read of — had nerved ragged , half - starved , untrained battalions to scatter like chaff the veteran armies of Europe . She understood it all as she listened to the mingled pathos , defiance , confidence of victory , vengeance and passionate patriotism , which Rouget de Lisle alone of all men has been able to concentrate and to embody in one immortal song , in every note of which breathes the very soul of Liberty . As the last note was struck and Litvinoff turned round from the piano , he almost smiled at the contrasts in the picture before him — a girl leaning forward , her face lighted up with sympathetic fire , and her eyes glowing with sympathetic enthusiasm , and an old gentleman standing on the hearthrug , very red in the face , very wide awake , and unutterably astonished . The girl was certainly very lovely , and if the exile thought so , as he glanced somewhat deprecatingly at the old gentleman , who shall blame him ? '
10887	10891	10608	10608	I	0	' said Clare . '
10898	10903	10608	10608	I	0	' said her father ; '
10919	10933	10934	10934	I	0	' This reduced the situation to the absurd — and they all laughed . '
10979	11013	10973	10973	I	0	' he added , as a tap at the door punctuated his remark . But the waiter , whatever his feelings may have been , gave them no expression . He merely announced — '
11018	11022	11014	11016	Mr Roland Ferrier	107	' and disappeared . '
11024	11035	11037	11038	Mr Stanley	119	'm very glad to see you , my dear boy , '
11045	11062	11041	11041	Roland	107	' though it 's about the last thing I expected . Mr Litvinoff — Mr Ferrier . '
11073	11082	11084	11084	he	107	' We 've come to London on business , '
11086	11095	11084	11084	he	107	' We ? Then where is your brother ? '
11099	11102	11104	11104	Roland	107	' Well , '
11106	11223	11104	11104	Roland	107	' it is rather absurd , but I ca n't tell you where he is ; he 's lost , stolen , or strayed . We came up together , dined together , and started to come here together . We were walking through a not particularly choice neighbourhood between here and St Pancras , when I suddenly missed him . I waited and looked about for something like a quarter of an hour , but as it was n't the sort of street where men are garrotted , and as he 's about able to take care of himself , I thought I 'd better come on . I expect he 'll be here presently . '

12050	12056	12089	12089	he	2891	' And where is home ? '
12057	12064	11934	11934	she	367	' Not a long way off . '

12251	12263	12209	12209	she	583	' Because — because — Do n't ask me anything else ; '

He thought gloomily of the time , not so very long ago either , when her face had been the brightest as well as the fairest in Thornsett village , and his heart was sore with indignant protest against him who had so changed her face , her life , her surroundings . He looked at her tired thin face , still so pretty , in spite of the grief that had aged and the want that had pinched it , and found it hard to believe that this was indeed the Alice with whom he had raced through the pastures at Firth Vale — the Alice who had taken the place in his boyish heart of a very dear little sister . Ah , if she had only been his sister really , then their friendship would not have grown less and less during his school and college days , and his protection would have saved her , perhaps , from this . These foster - relationships are uncomfortable things . They inflict the sufferings of a real blood tie , and give none of the rights which might mitigate or avert such suffering . '

13315	13891	13293	13294	the other	305	' DICK did not feel inclined to go to Morley 's after this rencontre , so he turned back towards his hotel . The problem was not actually solved , certainly ; but he was disposed to take all that had passed as a confirmation of his worst suspicions — so much so , that he felt he could not meet his brother just then , as if nothing had happened . He took two or three turns up and down that festive promenade , the Euston Road , thinking indignantly that his position ought to have been Roland 's , and Roland 's his — that he was suffering for his brother 's misdeeds , while his brother was enjoying bright glances from eyes that would hardly look so kindly on him could their owner have known how Dick was spending the evening . For the first time , too , he saw , though only dimly , a few of the difficulties that would lie in his way . It would be harder than ever to keep on any sort of terms with his brother now that he could no longer respect him , and to respect a man who had brought misery into a family which he was bound by every law of honour to protect was not possible to Dick . As his rival he had almost hated Roland ; as the man who had ruined Alice Hatfield he both hated and despised him , and he knew well enough that between partners in business these sort of feelings do not lead to commercial success . He did not care to follow out all the train of thought that this suggested ; but the remembrance of his father 's strange will was very present with him as he went to bed . In the morning things looked different . It is a way things have . Colours seen by candle lightWill not look the same by day . After all , was it proved ? When he came to think over what the girl had said there seemed to be nothing positively conclusive in it all . It was a strange contradiction — he had been very eager to trace the matter out — to prove to himself that Roland was utterly unworthy to win Clare Stanley ; and yet now he felt that he would give a good deal to believe that Roland had not done this thing . And this was not only because of the grave pecuniary dilemma in which he must involve himself by any quarrel with Roland . Perhaps it was partly because blood is , after all , thicker than water . It did not seem to Dick that his knowledge was much increased by his conversation with Alice . The blackest point was still that mysterious holiday trip , taken at such an unusual time , and about which his brother had been so strangely reticent . And that might be accounted for in plenty of other ways . Alice 's disappearance at that particular time was very likely only a rather queer coincidence . Dick had thought all this , and more , before he had finished dressing , and he was ready to meet his brother at breakfast with a manner a shade more cordial than usual — the reaction perhaps from his recent suspicions . Roland was in particularly high spirits . '
13900	13904	13894	13894	you	596	' he asked . '
13919	13920	13910	13910	I	0	' '
13928	13947	13924	13924	you	596	' It seemed that Roland 's uneasiness had been shown by his not turning in till about two . '

14210	14220	14202	14202	Dick	106	' Is he tame cat about the Stanleys already . '
14221	14260	14178	14178	I	0	' Why , he 'd never been there before ; what a fellow you are ! I 've asked him to come and have dinner with us to - night . I want you to see him . I 'm

14304	14312	14302	14302	Dick	106	' said Roland , a little huffily ; '
14322	14505	14313	14313	you	106	' This smote Dick with some compunction , and he resolved not to dislike this soi - disant count until he had cause to do so , which cause he did not doubt that their first meeting would furnish forth abundantly . But he was wrong . Litvinoff came , and Dick found his prejudices melting away . The count seemed a standing proof of the correctness of the parallels which have been drawn between Russian and English character . He was English in his frankness , his modesty , his off - hand way of telling his own adventures without making himself the hero of his stories . Before the evening was over Dick began to realise that Nihilists were not quite so black as they are sometimes painted , and that there are other countries besides England where progressive measures are desirable . The brothers were both interested , and tried very hard to get more particulars of Nihilist doctrines , but as they grew more curious Litvinoff became more reticent . As he rose to go he said , — '
14547	14604	14546	14546	you	616	're not too strict Sabbatarians , by - the - way — you might come down to a Radical club in Soho . I am going to speak there at eight on Sunday evening . I shall be very glad if you 'll come ; but do n't come if you think it will bore you . '
14605	14612	14614	14614	Dick	106	' I shall like it awfully , '
14616	14627	14614	14614	Dick	106	' You 'll go , wo n't you , Roland ? '
14628	14634	14546	14546	you	616	' Of course I will . '
14635	14642	14644	14644	Litvinoff	143	' We might have dinner together , '
14646	14659	14644	14644	Litvinoff	143	' Come down to Morley 's ; we 'll dine at six . '

It is not quite so easy , but still possible , to sit for two hours on a narrow seat , evidently made by someone who knew he would never have to sit on it , and to keep awake ( in the old pews this was not imperative ) , while a preacher , whom one does not care for , talks , in language one does not understand , on subjects in which one takes not the slightest interest . And then , as a compensation , one has the heavy early dinner and the afternoon sleep , in itself almost a religious exercise . Perhaps one 's ungodly neighbours curse the day they were born as they hear one , after tea , playing long - drawn hymn tunes on a harmonium , till the bells begin to go for evening '
15858	15897	15961	15961	himself'—to	659	' ; then one 's wife goes to put on her bonnet ( which has been lying in state all day on the best bed , covered with a white handkerchief ) , and one goes to one 's '

16194	16228	16191	16191	he	121	' I can always speak better to a full room . Perhaps the physical heat does something to grease one 's tongue ; and then , again , in a large audience , you 're

16305	16339	16303	16303	Roland	107	' There is a freemasonry among the soldiers of Liberty which holds good all over the world , and we who serve her are pledged to carry her light into the darkest corners . '
16626	16644	16615	16616	the chairman	698	' one who had suffered and worked for years for the cause he was about to advocate . '
16987	16990	17013	17013	he	121	' Shame ! '
17017	17018	17013	17013	he	121	' '
17022	17313	17013	17013	he	121	' as the lawful punishment of criminals — punishment inflicted by the only power that has the right to execute vengeance , the outraged spirit of man — he seemed to lose for a moment the sympathy of some of his hearers , and certainly of the Ferriers , who like most Englishmen , believed in the efficacy of Parliamentary reforms , and also forgot , like most Englishmen , that these patent remedies for all the ills of life are hardly applicable to nations that have no parliament . With the ready apprehension of a true orator , Litvinoff saw the slight shade of coldness as it passed over some of the upturned faces before him , and , with a consummate skill that was the result either of long practice or oratorical genius , he changed , without seeming to change , the argumentative and defensive attitude for one of stern and glowing denunciation . His voice rang through the room now like a trumpet - call . A very little of this sort of thing was sufficient to rouse the men before him to stormy approbation , and Richard whispered to his brother that if any Russian dignitary were to come in just then , while the speaker was in the full tide of his invective , he would have very much the sort of reception that was given to the Austrian woman - flogging general some years ago by the stalwart draymen of Messrs Barclay & Perkins . Apparently satisfied with the applause of his audience , in which he seemed to delight and revel , Litvinoff turned from the present and the past , and invited his hearers to look with him into the future , '
17323	17327	17013	17013	he	121	' he said ; '
17339	17355	17013	17013	he	121	' Then were done into rhetorical English the concluding pages of that famous Russian pamphlet , '

18070	18139	18066	18066	he	121	' Yes ; it was that unhappy pamphlet which deprived me of the chance of serving my country on the scene of action , and which lost me a life I valued above my own — that of a fellow - countryman of the audience which I have the pleasure of addressing to - night — my secretary and friend , whom I loved more than a brother . '
18247	18251	18252	18252	he	121	' Excuse me , '
18255	18315	18252	18252	he	121	' I am désolé ; but I shall be unable to stay longer . You will be able , doubtless , to pilot yourselves back to civilisation , and will pardon my abrupt departure . I have just seen someone going out of the door whom I 've been trying to catch for the last three months , and I 'm
18320	18351	18252	18252	he	121	' And he was off . As he passed a small knot of youths outside the door they looked after him , and one of them said with a laugh , '
18374	18409	18371	18372	the ladies	767	' The discerning youth was right . He was after that girl — but though he followed her and watched her into the house where she lived , he did not speak to her . '
18421	18432	18434	18434	I	0	' he said to himself , as he turned westwards , '
18444	18672	18434	18434	I	0	' Even discussions on political economy , and historical revelations by those who helped to make the history , must come to an end at last , and the Ferriers came away , after Dick had received a pressing invitation from the chairman to address the club , and to choose his own subject , and Roland , who had suddenly conceived a passion for foreigners of a revolutionary character , had made an appointment with his Communist acquaintance for an evening in the week . As they passed down the street , two men standing under a lamp looked at them with interest . One was the man who had put the questions regarding the pamphlet . The other was a foreigner too , though he was clean in his attire and had not a scrubby chin , but a long , light silky beard . He wore the slouch hat so much affected by the High Church Clergy , and which is popularly supposed to mark any non - clerical wearer as a man of revolutionary views . He was tall , and pale , and thin , and had very deeply - set hollow eyes , which he kept fixed on the retreating millowners till they turned the corner and went out of sight . Then he said , in a Hungarian dialect , — '
18703	18704	18683	18683	his	770	' '
18709	18714	18716	18716	he	770	' growled the other , '

18767	18772	18761	18761	he	770	' said the other . '
18774	18818	18761	18761	he	770	'm not so sure ; at anyrate , he uses his tongue , which is a good one , in our cause . Speeches like that are good . A man who can speak so is not to be sneered at , and I 'm

18961	18965	18954	18955	Mr Ferrier	107	' Clare Stanley . '
18978	19431	18969	18972	your interesting Russian friend	783	' Miss Stanley smiled to herself rather wickedly as she folded this note . She had noticed that her interest in the Russian acquaintance did not seem to enhance theirs , and she thought to herself that whatever the dinner might be at which those three assisted , it certainly would not be dull for her . In Derbyshire , where her amusements were very limited , she would have thought twice before permitting herself to risk offending the masters of Thornsett , but here that risk only seemed to offer a new form of amusement . But experimenting on the feelings of these gentlemen was an entertainment which was somehow not quite so enthralling as it had been , and she now longed , not for a fresh world to conquer — here was one ready to her hand — but for the power to conquer it . She would have given something to be able to believe that she had anything like the same power over this hero of romance , whom fate had thrown in her way , as she had over the excellent but commonplace admirers with whom she had amused herself for the last year . Litvinoff had distinctly told her that the goddess of his idolatry , the one mistress of his heart , was Liberty , and though this statement was modified in her mind by her recollection of certain glances cast at herself , she yet believed in it enough to feel a not unnatural desire to enter into competition with that goddess . Her classical studies taught her that women had competed successfully with such rivals , and she was not morbidly self - distrustful , especially when a looking - glass was near her . With the letter in her hand she glanced at the mirror over the mantelpiece , and the fair vision of dark - brown lashes , gold - brown waving hair , delicate oval face , and well - shaped if rather large mouth , might have reassured her had she felt any doubts of her own attractions . But the glance she cast at herself over her shoulder was one of saucy triumph , and the smile with which she sealed her letter one of conscious power . Would she have been gratified if she could have seen the effect of her note ? It was not at all with the sort of expression you would expect to see on the face of a man who had just received a dinner invitation transmitted through the lady of his heart from that lady 's papa , that Richard Ferrier passed the note over to his brother next morning . '

Ah , well ! so shall I be very soon , unless something very unexpected turns up . I 'll go now , and earn an easy conscience for this evening . '

21939	21990	21915	21915	I	0	' he added , as he came out from his dusty retirement , and carefully removed all traces of the same from his clothes . When he found himself once more in the chill , foggy , outside air , he looked up and down the court , and smiled . '

22912	22974	22904	22904	Jenny	172	' Miss Jenny Fludger , a muscular young woman , with her hair in a long beaded net , responded to the call , and lent her help in carrying Alice back to her room . Then the unsympathetic hands of the two women undressed the girl and laid her in her bed . Then they looked meaningly at each other . '
22990	22995	22982	22982	I	0	' said the mother . '

Alice showing no signs of being affected by the application of these generally efficacious remedies , Mrs Fludger decided that this was a case of '
23087	23125	22904	22904	Jenny	172	' quite beyond her experience , and feeling the responsibility too much to be borne alone , she despatched her third son in quest of a doctor , regardless of Miss Jenny 's opinion that the lodger was '
23128	23199	22904	22904	Jenny	172	' Joe Fludger was not particularly pleased at being sent . He was busy just then shaking up a mangy kitten and a recently - acquired guinea - pig in a box , with a view of getting them to fight , which they showed no signs of doing , and he did not care to relinquish this enthralling pastime until he had compassed his end . He put his two '
23201	23320	23321	23321	She	882	' into one pocket , hoping that that position would urge them to fulfil their destiny and have it out , and as he met several friends , and felt it incumbent on him to exhibit his treasures to each of them , it was some time before he carried out his instructions , and brought medical science , as represented by Dr Moore , to 15 Spray 's Buildings . But even when the doctor did at last stand by her bedside , Alice was still insensible . He raised her eyelids , felt her pulse , asked one or two brief questions , and then stood holding her hand till she sighed , and moved slightly . '
23326	23330	23321	23321	She	882	' he said . '
23337	23372	23334	23334	I	0	' he added , glancing at the hand he held , on which shone no golden circle , not even the brass substitute which takes its place occasionally , when times are very hard . '
23380	23416	23334	23334	I	0	' said Miss Jenny with a toss of the net , which drew down upon her a glance of disapproval from the old doctor , and a sharp recommendation from her mother to go downstairs . '
23431	23454	23334	23334	I	0	' Miss Fludger withdrew with a gesture expressive of a sovereign contempt for faints in general , and this collapse in particular . '

23479	23509	23470	23470	she	882	' He , being an observant man , glanced as he spoke at the roughened forefinger of her left hand , and then round the bare , dreary attic . '

24690	24696	24668	24668	she	844	' said Alice , hurriedly ; '
24719	24731	24732	24732	I	0	' Mrs Fludger rubbed her hands together in a little embarrassment . '
24738	24792	24737	24737	you	367	're in the right to go , and I hope you 'll get on all right , and not let your trouble play upon your mind too much ; but as for the money , never mind . It 's only a couple of days , and I do n't grudge that . An '
24827	24837	24814	24814	God	110	' Which Alice , listening sadly , interpreted to mean '
24841	25064	24814	24814	God	110	' And so it happened that her worldly goods were taken away on a hand - barrow , she herself walking beside it — whither Mrs Fludger was careful not to inquire ; and Dr Moore , coming at noon , received the comforting intelligence that the girl had gone home to her people ; for Mrs Fludger , like so many others , thought that her advice once given could not fail to be taken . IT was a bright , perfectly clear , moonlight night , one of those nights in which there seems to be no atmosphere , in which the smallest architectural details of every building show with even a greater distinctness than in mid - sunshine . The great full moon and the vast unfathomable expanse overhead seemed to have cast a spell of their own peace over even London 's unpeaceful heart . The streets were empty , for the night had worn itself away to the only hour at which they are really deserted . The clocks had just expressed their different views on the subject of two A.M. The night was so clear that Alice Hatfield , though her eyes were smarting and aching , thought she could see the hands on the big clock of St Paul 's as she came on to Blackfriars '
25580	25586	25587	25587	she	134	' I will go out , '
25747	25779	25743	25743	she	134	' Bridge she was too tired to go any further . And as she stood and looked at the river gleaming in the moonlight , the question came into her mind . '
25796	25985	25794	25794	she	951	' A spasm of madness caught her . What an easy way out of all her troubles ; what an obvious solution of all her difficulties ! She walked straight before her , stooping to pass under the protecting pole in the middle of the road , falling once over a block of stone and cutting her hands , she thought . She climbed the tomb - like stones , and in a moment was on her hands and knees partly on the parapet and partly on some stones that leaned against it . She looked over without changing her attitude for quite a minute . It made her giddy to look down . She could not stand up , as she had pictured herself doing when that madness first came upon her . She could drop over , though , and she would . Courage ! In another minute it would all be over . She had made a movement to turn her feet towards the water , when her shoulders were caught by two hands , and she was lifted bodily back on to the bridge . '
25990	26012	25986	25986	You	952	' said the owner of the hands , which gave her a little shake before they loosened their hold of her . '
26042	26068	26071	26071	I	0	' Alice 's face was in her hands . She had sunk down against the stones on which she had climbed before . She shivered . '
26076	26100	26071	26071	I	0	' she said , almost in a whisper , without taking her hands away . The madness had died out of her completely . '
26162	26340	26386	26386	He	0	' he said , sententiously , but whether he meant the river , the coffee , or the fire , he did not explain . He helped her to rise , took her by the elbow in a sort of amateur - constable way , and led her over and round the snares and pitfalls which lay between them and that red eye which had seemed to watch them . It was a sort of openwork iron pot , full of hot coals , and a species of shelter was contrived round it by means of a judicious arrangement of paving stones and tarpaulin . When he had made her sit down on an inverted basket placed in the warmest corner by the fire , she glanced at him for the first time . He was a big , burly , black - bearded man ; he had a kindly expression , and merry eyes , with a sort of cast in one of them which made it difficult to be sure which way he was looking . '
26344	26362	26367	26367	I	0	' he asked , with one eye on her and the other apparently on the pole star . '
26368	26385	26386	26386	He	0	'm warm enough . I had to hurry up so to catch you , young woman . '
26403	26416	26386	26386	He	0	' How did you catch me ? Where did you come from ? '
26417	26467	26468	26468	he	0	' Where did I come from ? Why , from here . Directly I saw you cross the road I knew what was up . I never would let anyone go into that ditch if I could help it . It ought to belong to the Commissioners of Sewers , '
26481	26484	26474	26474	his	0	' Government . '
26485	26490	26491	26491	he	0	' The question is , '
26495	26509	26491	26491	he	0	' where did you come from , and what did you come for ? '
26510	26520	26521	26521	she	956	' I 've come from Gray 's Inn Road , '
26524	26577	26521	26521	she	956	' How lucky , now . I live that way . I shall be able to see you home in an hour or two , when my mate comes to take his turn . You 'll just have time to get warm . Here , drink this coffee . Had any tea ? '
26583	26587	26578	26578	She	956	' Any dinner ? '
26588	26591	26491	26491	he	0	' No . '
26592	26605	26491	26491	he	0	' Nor any breakfast neither , I 'll back . I suppose you 're
26621	26667	26580	26580	her	956	' with a backward jerk of his thumb towards what seemed to be his pet aversion . He was a man whose occupation caused him to pass a good deal of his time on bridges , and he knew the river and the smells thereof . '
26670	26674	26675	26675	I	0	' said Alice , '
26676	26684	26491	26491	he	0	'm not very hard up , and I 'm
26727	26728	26491	26491	he	0	' '
26734	26802	26491	26491	he	0	' was his answer , and soon Alice began to feel a returning sense of physical comfort steal through her , as she sat resting by the cheering fire , drinking the hot coffee from a tin mug , with a slice of bread and cheese on her knee , while her companion kept up a constant ripple of somewhat inconsequent talk , which was his notion of '
26805	27053	26491	26491	he	0	' for his guest . She took her part in the dialogue with an ease which surprised herself . It seems very strange that people should not be more affected than they generally are by having been face to face with death . The fact is , that it is so impossible to realise subjectively what death is , that people feel less awestruck at having been so near it than they do at having been within an ace of having their leg broken , or of being marked with small - pox . Perhaps this is why so many men sleep sound sleeps and eat hearty breakfasts just before execution . It was a long time since anyone had thought it worth while to talk so much to Alice , and she felt so interested , and withal so comfortable , that it never occurred to her that this interlude of warmth and companionship must soon be over , and that then she would have to face the desolate streets and that cheerless room . Of seeking again the chill refuge from which her new acquaintance had saved her she certainly never thought . That madness was over . Her black - bearded preserver was in the midst of an economic dissertation of a somewhat confused character on the reasons of hard times and bad wages , when a black shadow falling on a moonlit slab of stone close by them made them both look up . '
27064	27069	27060	27062	Mr Peter Hitch	176	' said the pavior . '
27072	27111	27112	27115	The new - comer	959	're out again , sir ? Chilly night , ai n't it ? Come and have a warm . This young woman 's had a warm , and she feels better for it , I 'll be bound . '
27131	27136	27137	27137	he	959	' It is cold , '
27146	27161	27137	27137	he	959	' You are the lucky one , Mr Toomey , with your warm fire . '
27278	27321	27270	27270	he	960	' Forgive me , but I feel as if you were a sort of acquaintance already . I sat just behind you at a lecture in Soho last night . I am not mistaken — you were there , were n't you ? '
27399	27406	27396	27396	she	134	' Yes ; I was there . '
27407	27411	27396	27396	she	134	' Why , I 'm

27494	27540	27541	27541	I	0	' he explained , seeing the other 's look of surprise , and embellishing his speech by sundry winks , to which his visual peculiarities imparted an unusually enigmatical character . The two men stepped a few paces away , and then Toomey said , — '
27547	27570	27573	27573	he	0	'm in rather a tight place , and perhaps you can tell me a way out of it . That there young woman '
27578	27729	27575	27575	his	0	' would have been down somewhere off Greenwich by this time if it had n't been for me — the tide was just on the turn . I stopped her going over , and now I feel responsible , like . I did think of taking her home to the missus , but my Mary Jane , though she have the kindest heart , has a sharp tongue , and I do n't know quite how she might take it , nor what she might say in the first surprise , like , before she could be got to listen to reason , and that pore young thing 's in trouble enough , I know , without being jawed at , and I ca n't abide jaw myself neither . And yet I do n't like to lose sight of her just yet , and what am I to do ? '

27748	27763	27740	27741	the other	305	' You can trust her to me , friend Toomey , can you not ? '
27764	27774	27776	27776	Toomey	177	' I 'd trust you with anything , sir , '
27799	27820	27821	27821	She	134	' I am going home now , and as I go I will see you to your house . Come . '

28906	29099	28900	28904	that shindy on the stairs	992	' Miss Stanley was lying on the sofa in the sitting - room at Morley 's Hotel , reading the novel that had taken the last season by storm , and pushed everything else out of sight on the bookstalls . But even the thrilling interest of this work did not keep her from falling fast asleep in the middle of the fourth chapter ; and she passed the next half hour in a dreamland more pleasant than Morley 's Hotel ; for that hostelry , especially when her father was , as usual , in the City , seemed to her to be deadly dull . She had just come back to the world of solid furniture and characterless window curtains ; her first waking thought was that some tea would be worth anything to her just then — except the trouble of getting up to ring for it — and she wished dreamily that waiters could know by intuition when they were wanted . It almost seemed as if they did , for a tap came at the door , and she had to stop her reflections to say , — '

29332	29344	29323	29323	she	889	' What can you mean ? Surely you have n't quarrelled ? '
29345	29376	29377	29377	Clare	139	' I suppose we have quarrelled . At anyrate , my brother told me half an hour ago never to speak to him again on this side of the grave . '

29722	29752	29679	29679	he	107	' said Clare in quite an awestruck tone — all that her father had told her about old Mr Ferrier 's will coming into her mind with a rush . '

29840	29888	29831	29831	you	0	' she said rather haughtily . She had no motive for that little speech , save a natural love for fair play , but he read in it a desire to champion his brother against his attack , and he was goaded to the point of indiscretion . '
29894	29899	29831	29831	you	0	' he answered bitterly , '
29935	29948	29949	29949	I	0	' he went on , seeing that she was about to speak . '

30070	30076	30066	30066	I	0	' she said , indignantly . '
30087	30094	30084	30084	my	0	' said Richard with equal fire , '
30139	30193	30121	30121	He	3376	' Miss Stanley looked at him coldly and contemptuously . He stood silent a moment , and in that moment felt the utter falseness of the step he had taken . She turned slightly away from him , and he knew that there were no more words to be said on either side . '
30198	30202	30121	30121	He	3376	' he said ; '
30215	30216	30203	30203	I	0	' '
30220	30271	30203	30203	I	0	' she said , without moving ; and he went out . Now , indeed , everything was over . Clare , left to herself , sank down again in her low chair , and knitted her brows in annoyed meditation . Quarrels , separations , and crushing impertinent people with '
30274	30391	30395	30395	he	1011	' were all very well in novels , but in real life it was much nicer to have things go smoothly . She could not quite foresee all the complications that this quarrel might lead to , but she knew that it would make a great difference at Firth Vale . Aspinshaw would be duller than ever . Would Roland come this evening ? Could what Dick had said be true ? If it was , she thought , he had no right to say it to her ; and it was mean of him to say it to anyone behind his brother 's back . Count Litvinoff would be sure to come , at anyrate . '
30400	30549	30395	30395	he	1011	' she said to herself . When a woman is bored , or tired , or vexed , or perplexed , or worried , after a quarrel , or before a journey , there is one resource to which she always flies . Miss Stanley rang for tea . The waiter who announced Mr Ferrier had quite settled in his own mind that in so doing he was ushering in one of the chief characters in a love scene , but when he caught sight of the young man 's face as he came from Miss Stanley 's presence , he decided that the scene in which Mr Ferrier had just played his part , had not had much love - sweetness about it , at anyrate . Count Litvinoff , coming up the stairs a moment afterwards , met Dick going down , and thought so too . '
30555	30560	30552	30553	Mr Ferrier	107	' he said genially ; '
30574	30575	30571	30571	I	0	' '
30580	30587	30571	30571	I	0	' said Dick , shaking hands ; '
30596	30609	30588	30588	I	0	' Litvinoff 's face fell , and he looked quite naturally grieved . '
30613	30617	30618	30618	I	0	' he said . '
30621	30631	30618	30618	I	0	' said Richard , after a minute 's pause , '
30675	30676	30665	30665	I	0	' '
30700	30723	30691	30691	I	0	' The Court of St Petersburg had evidently missed a good diplomatist in Count Michael Litvinoff . The lie was admirably told . '
30726	30730	30691	30691	I	0	' said Richard , '
30752	30753	30741	30741	I	0	' '
30758	30775	30755	30755	I	0	' said Litvinoff , leaning on the banisters and idly swinging his eyeglass by the guard , '
30787	30788	30789	30789	You	1014	' '
30818	30819	30802	30802	I	0	' '
30836	30837	30834	30834	he	2894	' '
30847	30848	30842	30842	him	2894	' '
30854	30874	30842	30842	him	2894	' observed Litvinoff , when , having watched the other out of sight , he turned towards his room . '
30926	31178	30918	30918	he	2894	' He did turn up , in such a state of depression as to promise to be a thorough wet blanket on all the fires of social gaiety . In fact , none of the little party which assembled round Mr Stanley 's dinner - table were in a state of mind to make them what is called good company . Roland was thoroughly unhinged by the events of the afternoon , which to him had been so utterly unexpected , and were so completely unexplained . It needed a determined effort on his part to listen to Mr Stanley 's commonplaces instead of thinking out some means of compassing a reconciliation with his brother . He felt sure that their quarrel hinged on a mistake , but what that mistake was , or what its subject was , he was at a loss to conjecture . Clare was listless and distraite . She was intensely annoyed by the remembrance of that little episode with Richard , and , though she told herself that she did not believe a word he had said , she found it hard to forget it and to treat Roland as usual . She had not had a chance of telling her father anything about Richard , for Litvinoff had been punctual , and Mr Stanley had come back from the City late , and cross as well as late ; and the old gentleman 's continued references to the absentee , and his regrets for the '
31181	31483	31484	31486	the gentle Roland	107	' which had prevented him from being present , made matters several degrees more uncomfortable than they would otherwise have been . Litvinoff had his own reasons for not feeling very joyous on this occasion , but he had not had three years of wandering in exile among all sorts and conditions of men for nothing , and he was able to put his own personal feelings on one side , and to do what was exacted by the proprieties . No one could have told from his manner that he had a care in the world . More than this , he succeeded after a while in inspiring the others with some of his own powers of self - repression ; and though they did not perhaps feel more festive , they made a successful effort to seem so , in order to be not out of harmony with what seemed to them to be his gaiety and light - heartedness . During the earlier part of the evening he devoted himself entirely to Mr Stanley , a real act of self - abnegation in any young man , when Mr Stanley 's daughter was in the room . But Mr Stanley was interested in the financial condition of United States railways , and Count Litvinoff — odd thing in an exile — knew absolutely everything that was to be known about the financial condition of United States railways , and , what was better , he had a friend who knew even more than that , and whose knowledge was quite at Mr Stanley 's service . If during the long conference on these entrancing topics he cast occasional glances across the room to where Clare and young Ferrier sat talking , they were certainly not envious ones , for '
31487	31513	31484	31486	the gentle Roland	107	' did not seem to be having a good time of it . Litvinoff took pity on him presently , and came to the rescue . '
31524	31562	31484	31486	the gentle Roland	107	' he asked , when the subject of the financial condition of the United States railways was exhausted for the time being , and his host showed decided symptoms of a desire to descant on the beauties of '
31570	31572	31484	31486	the gentle Roland	107	' and '
31578	31618	31619	31620	Penny Napoleon	181	' etc . Miss Stanley felt that singing to three people would be better than talking to one , and in the intervals between the songs that followed she and Litvinoff seemed to conspire to keep the conversation general . '
31622	31691	31619	31620	Penny Napoleon	181	' so often a refuge of the bored and the uncongenial , helped the long evening to its end , and though the last state of it was better than the first , everyone was glad to say good - night to everyone else . The two young men , by the way , did not say good - night to each other when they left the Stanleys . '
31698	31794	31795	31795	Your	1026	' said Litvinoff , precisely as he had done on the last occasion of their meeting there . And Roland , nothing loth to defer the moment of being alone again with his own perplexities , consented . But even in the Count 's comfortable little sitting - room his perplexities pursued him , and in more objectionable shape , too . For the first words his companion uttered , after he had supplied his guest with one of his special cigars and a tumbler of something unexceptionable , with lemon , hot , were — '
31800	31811	31619	31620	Penny Napoleon	181	're taking an interest in my movements , Mr Ferrier . '
31812	31818	31619	31620	Penny Napoleon	181	' How do you mean ? '
31819	31928	31929	31929	You	1028	' I had the felicity to meet him to - day , and he asked me — rather bluntly , perhaps — if I had been this afternoon in some street , the name of which escapes me at the moment — Morford Street , was it ? I told him no , and begged to know the reason of his question . He then said he wished to verify ( I think those were his exact words ) a statement of yours . I asked him , did you take an interest in my movements ? He then said , in a manner tant soit peu abrupt , '
31935	31949	31950	31950	Roland	107	' and vanished into the Ewigkeit . Voilà , I have asked you . '
31997	32001	32002	32002	he	121	' Look here , '
32006	32093	32002	32002	he	121	' according to the laws of etiquette and all that sort of thing , I have known you far too short a time to think of talking to you about my relations with my brother , but I am horribly perplexed about him ; and since he has let you know that there is something wrong between us , I may as well tell you all I know about it . I need hardly say that all I say to you is said in strict confidence . '
32098	32169	32170	32170	He	3057	' For some time we have not been upon the very best of terms ; but that 's neither here nor there . There was nothing seriously wrong between us . This morning , without any apparent cause , he made a kind of veiled accusation against me , which I could not understand , and even went so far as to tell me I ought not to go near — '
32192	32196	32197	32197	he	121	' Miss Stanley , '
32200	32205	32207	32208	the other	305	' Ah , so ? '
32219	32277	32207	32208	the other	305	' We had a sharp word ; but I should not have thought much more of it if it had n't been for what came later . This afternoon I was going to see a man you introduced me to the other night , Lenoir , who , I thought , I remembered lived in Porson Street . '
32278	32291	32293	32293	Litvinoff	121	' Ah , yes , it was Porson Street your brother named , '
32295	32341	32293	32293	Litvinoff	121	' As I was looking about for him I fancied I caught sight of you , but it was foggy , and when I followed the man into a house , it turned out not to be you . At least , I suppose not . '
32342	32352	32207	32208	the other	305	' No , no ; it certainly was not I. '
32353	32437	32207	32208	the other	305	' Well , as I was looking about , bewildered , on a staircase , I met my brother , who , I suppose , had followed me . He asked me what I wanted there . I told him . He said I was a scoundrel and a liar . Of course , I could n't stand that , so I let out at him , and came away — and there the matter stands . What do you make of it ? '
32438	32442	32444	32445	the other	305	' Excuse me , '
32447	32453	32444	32445	the other	305	' does your brother drink ? '
32454	32469	32207	32208	the other	305	' Certainly not ; he 's one of the most temperate men I know . '
32470	32488	32207	32208	the other	305	' Could he have done it because — But ah , no , that is quite impossible . '
32489	32495	32207	32208	the other	305	' I beg your pardon ? '
32496	32506	32508	32508	Litvinoff	121	' Is your brother in love with Miss Stanley ? '
32514	32526	32508	32508	Litvinoff	121	' I think he is . What made you think so ? '
32527	32539	32570	32570	him	107	' It was coming from her presence that I met him . '
32540	32554	32556	32556	Roland	107	' By God ! That may account for her manner to - night , '
32583	32634	32578	32578	he	107	' No , no , that is quite impossible ; dismiss that from your mind . He would never be so base as to traduce you to her . Besides , where is the motive , unless he fears you ? Is there perhaps some other lady in the case ? '
32635	32638	32659	32659	his	1034	' No . '
32639	32653	32659	32659	his	1034	' He told you you were not worthy to go near Miss Stanley , '
32666	32674	32659	32659	his	1034	' That can only mean one thing . '
32675	32707	32709	32709	he	1036	' It may mean that he is mad , or — by Jove!—it may mean one other thing . But of that other thing I am as innocent as you are . '
32723	32745	32718	32718	he	1036	' Perhaps it will arrange itself . Quarrels about ladies often adjust themselves — or rather the lady usually adjusts them . '
32746	32749	32751	32751	Roland	107	' This , '
32753	32794	32751	32751	Roland	107	' is more serious than most quarrels for both of us , and more serious than I can tell you ; but I think I 've troubled you enough with our family affairs . I 'll say good - night . '
32822	32879	32817	32817	he	121	' If it is any comfort to you , your brother did not seem to have prospered in his suit . He looked distressed , and , fancied , remorseful . Good - night . Ah , what a lovely night . The fog has quite cleared up . How lucky for you . Au revoir ! '
32929	33019	33025	33026	the millowner	1038	' So said the Count when he returned to his room , and he accordingly acted on his convictions . But both whisky and tobacco seemed to fail of the effect expected of them . He sat looking broodingly at the fire for a moment or two ; then he got up , paced the length of the room , and , turning sharply , stamped his foot on the ground , muttered a curse or two , and flung his hands out with a vigorous gesture of annoyance . '
33158	33168	33154	33154	Pardieu	184	' he added , with something like a laugh ; '
33207	33219	33204	33205	young man	842	' and he glanced mockingly at his reflection over the mantelpiece ; '
33263	33271	33252	33253	the Yankees	1050	' He finished his glass of grog . '

33424	33435	33437	33438	her father	391	' What will you do with yourself all the time ? '
33440	33448	33437	33438	her father	391	' You ca n't be always reading . '
33449	33470	33437	33438	her father	391	' I 'll run over to the National Gallery , I think , and spend an hour or two there . '

33483	33495	33437	33438	her father	391	' It 's no good going to a picture gallery once . '
33496	33526	33437	33438	her father	391	' I do n't know that it 's any good , my dear , but it 's quite enough for me . However , please yourself — please yourself . '

33677	33829	33609	33609	he	119	' With which she smoothed his hair , arranged his tie , kissed him on both cheeks , and watched him out of sight from the window . Then she went and wrapped herself in a good deal of brown fur , and walked quickly across the square to the hideous casket in which the nation cherishes its gems of art . She was wandering from one picture to another in a desultory sort of way , and thinking , it must be confessed , more of her own affairs than of the paintings , when she almost ran against Count Litvinoff , who was standing , his hat off and his hands behind him , in rapt contemplation of the Martyrdom of Saint Somebody . He turned and bowed , with an air of pleased surprise . She had never seen him look so little English — so very foreign . '
33837	33841	33650	33650	she	1062	' he said ; '
33848	33849	33842	33843	your father	2900	' '
33852	33856	33842	33843	your father	2900	' said Clare . '

33943	34000	33938	33938	you	0	' Then the conversation was all picture for a while , and at last they sat down on one of the few seats provided by the munificence of a thoughtful Administration for such lovers of art as care to stay in the Gallery long enough to get tired . They were silent for a little while . '
34009	34014	34006	34007	Miss Stanley	122	' he said presently . '
34023	34032	34033	34033	she	122	'm very well . Do I look ill ? '
34046	34054	34055	34055	he	0	' Ah , no ; you look — '

34090	34115	34065	34065	he	0	' Because I fancied last night that you were in some kind of pain , and I have been uneasy ever since about it . '

34216	34228	34229	34229	He	107	' questioned Clare , who was beginning to feel rather uncomfortable . '

34326	34361	34323	34323	you	0	' The question was put so innocently , and the Count ap peared so really perplexed , that Miss Stanley stifled the evasive answer that first occurred to her , and said simply , — '

34594	34628	34581	34581	you	0	' She had felt intensely annoyed at the turn the conversation had taken , but since it had taken this turn , she was determined to learn as much from it as possible . '
34660	34678	34656	34656	his	107	' He said this with a delicate air of chivalrously making the best of a bad cause . '
34686	34713	34656	34656	his	107	' said Clare , feeling that she was skating on very thin ice , and not quite knowing how to get back to the bank again , '

34731	34732	34726	34726	you	0	' '
34735	34749	34726	34726	you	0	' she went on , forgetting how little she had told her companion , '
34778	34801	34812	34812	he	130	' Litvinoff 's eyes gave one little flash at the admission contained in this speech , but he said quite quietly , — '

34900	34980	34981	34981	Their	1088	' He looked about as little like a ruined man as it was possible to be . His dress was perfect , though it had a certain foreign air that was not to be traced to that too great prominence of shirt collar and prodigality of cuff , that shininess of hat and boot , that exuberant floridity of necktie , which are the signet of the flâneur of the boulevards . Above all , his nails were unexceptionable . '
34989	35009	34981	34981	Their	1088	' said Miss Stanley , bluntly , glad to get away from the subject of Roland 's possible lâches , '

35077	35106	35067	35067	he	107	' Clare stroked her muff with her kid - gloved hand , and wondered whether the late Mr Ferrier had thought they were likely to quarrel about her . '

35134	35162	35130	35130	I	0	' she said chillingly , and she turned and walked out . He followed her humbly . When they had passed down the steps he said , — '
35218	35242	35203	35203	I	0	' There was a suspicion of irony in his voice , and she did not answer , only quickened her pace a little . '
35246	35268	35203	35203	I	0	' he said , in a tone low , and one more earnest than any she had yet heard him use . '
35304	35325	35326	35326	I	0	' She turned and looked right into his eyes , and in them read nothing but perfect honesty and sincerity . '
35336	35340	35333	35334	Count Litvinoff	121	' she said . '
35349	35433	35333	35334	Count Litvinoff	121	' but all the ice was gone from her voice , and he at once plunged into a diatribe against the carelessness of omnibus drivers . He said good - bye to her outside the hotel . At the top of the steps she turned and looked after him , and was not a little vexed with herself for having done so , for he was looking after her with an expression in his eyes which said , to her at least , — '
35471	35475	35468	35469	Clare Stanley	139	' A FAIR MORNING 'S
36272	36488	36522	36523	the Lord	1124	' thought decided the course his action should take . By half - past eight o'clock he had knocked at the door of 15 Spray 's Buildings , and had been directed to the room of Mrs Fludger . That lady was surrounded by the family linen — some just as it had been discarded by the family , some in the wash - tub , and some hanging on lines slung across the room at a convenient height for dabbing itself wetly in the faces of possible visitors . The room appeared to be furnished chastely and simply with the tub and lines before mentioned , and nothing else whatever ; for the remainder of the furniture had been heaped in one corner , in order that the washing might not be impeded , and was not noticeable at the first glance . Mrs Fludger had her arms bared for toil . She wore a dress with no appreciable waist and no distinctive colour . A woollen shawl wound her figure in its embrace , a black bonnet of no particular shape , and of antique appearance , was on the extreme back of her head , where it was supported , by no visible agency , in defiance of the laws of gravitation . '
36496	36511	36522	36523	the Lord	1124	' she began , in answer to Petrovitch 's tap at the open door , '
36575	36588	36569	36569	you	1121	' teach him the ten commanders if you wants to Bible read ? '
36589	36599	36604	36604	she	1121	' But I do n't want to Bible read , '
36618	36622	36610	36610	her	1121	' soaping in , '
36630	36642	36604	36604	she	1121	' I only wish to ask you of a Mrs Litvinoff ? '
36643	36650	36569	36569	you	1121	' Do n't know the name . '
36651	36670	36569	36569	you	1121	' Perhaps I mistake the name ; I ask of the young woman who left here yesterday morning . '
36671	36676	36604	36604	she	1121	' Oh , her ! '
36681	36719	36604	36604	she	1121	' bless you , her name ai n't nothing like that ; no more nor yours nor mine . Her name 's Hatfield ; and she ai n't a missus neither , without she was married yesterday . '
36720	36737	36739	36739	he	1126	' I hope she did no wrong here , that you are not angry with her , '
36756	36759	36761	36762	Mrs Fludger	171	' No , '
36768	36770	36761	36762	Mrs Fludger	171	' I 'm

36856	36875	36842	36842	you	1126	' said Mrs Fludger , with an impatient intonation , dipping a blue - bag into a pail , '
36933	36953	36925	36925	You	1126	' andsome for her among you all . Why , only yesterday two young swells was a'most a - comin '

37059	37081	37082	37082	She	3334	' He spoke so gravely that Mrs Fludger seemed impressed . She lowered her voice a little as she answered , — '

37159	37191	37192	37192	Petrovitch	179	're curious you 'd better ask him , for he 's more time for jaw than me , not having got nine children and a husband as is always in liquor . '
37227	37233	37234	37234	he	179	' Thank you very much , '
37237	37242	37234	37234	he	179	' good - bye , '

37346	37363	37343	37343	she	171	' if I 've been a bit short , you must set it down to the washin '
37373	37424	37343	37343	she	171	' my head that you was one of the religious sort . And I hope the young woman wo n't come to no hurt , and I will say as you look more the sort to do her good than them young sparks as come here yesterday , with their cussin '
37428	37435	37343	37343	she	171	' , and yellow kid gloves . '
37535	37558	37531	37531	he	179	' Excuse me ; but may I ask what interest you have in this poor girl ? Are you a City missionary ? '
37564	37603	37531	37531	he	179	' Not I ; but there must be something very devout in my appearance . Evidently extremes meet in me . I encountered a hostile reception at Spray 's Buildings through being taken for a Bible - reader . '
37604	37621	37531	37531	he	179	' Ah , well , I ca n't wonder ; they do make themselves disliked . They 're
37651	37689	37645	37645	your	305	' For answer the other told him frankly enough all that had passed the night before , adding that before he made any effort on her behalf he wished to verify her story as far as possible . '
37703	37704	37691	37692	the landlady	844	' '
37715	37723	37709	37710	Mrs Fludger	171	' said Petrovitch , shrugging his shoulders . '
37748	37749	37743	37743	she	844	' '
37755	37760	37743	37743	she	844	' said Dr Moore , '

37809	37814	37806	37806	I	0	' said Petrovitch thoughtfully , '

37915	37929	37930	37930	he	0	're right . I have seen a great many of these sad cases , '
37936	37947	37930	37930	he	0	' but very , very few of the others . We 're
37983	38040	37930	37930	he	0	' The doctor was pleased with his visitor , whose face and figure were not quite like those that usually faced him in his drug - scented surgery , and when the interview ended it was he who offered the hand - shake . As Petrovitch came out of the door he glanced at his watch . '
38047	38059	37930	37930	he	0	' he thought , and he did not think in English . '
38074	38202	37930	37930	he	0	' If this man had no connection with the Bible reading and City missionary fraternity , he had at least one thing to which they lay claim — the faith which moves mountains ; but it was faith in humanity , and faith in himself . He only knew one woman who combined the strength of character and the kindness of heart necessary for his purpose , and of her it had been said only the night before , by the one who ought to have known her best , that she had a sharp tongue . Mr Toomey had not adhered strictly to truth in telling Alice that he lived up in the direction of Gray 's Inn Road , vaguely . His household gods were enshrined '
38207	38286	37930	37930	he	0	' and thither Petrovitch now betook himself . Mrs Toomey welcomed him in an off - hand manner , which showed that she at least did not suspect him of being a Bible - reader . She asked him in , and he passed up the narrow passage where two Toomeys of tender years were playing at houses with a profusion of oyster - shells . A third of still smaller size was in the mother 's arms . '
38293	38305	38287	38287	Toomey	191	' she said , as she set a chair for Petrovitch , '
38310	38338	38307	38307	I	0	're not . He told me he saw you on the bridge in the beginning of the morning . What have you done with that poor thing ? '
38339	38343	38386	38387	Mrs Toomey	191	' Nothing yet . '
38344	38352	38386	38387	Mrs Toomey	191	' What are you going to do ? '
38353	38365	38366	38366	he	1165	' That 's just what I want you to tell me , '
38460	38473	38475	38475	he	1165	' This is the great privilege of those who do their duty , '
38477	38490	38475	38475	he	1165	' to be able to help those who have not done it . '
38491	38498	38500	38501	Mrs Toomey	191	' That 's all very well , '
38503	38521	38500	38501	Mrs Toomey	191	' but what 's to become of example if the good and the bad gets treated alike ? '
38522	38553	38475	38475	he	1165	' It is n't that ; what I want is to give the bad — who is not so very bad in this case — a chance of being better . '
38603	38609	38598	38598	he	1165	' What will people say ? '
38610	38615	38598	38598	he	1165	' As far as I 'm
38659	38660	38647	38648	No one	494	' '
38669	38686	38647	38648	No one	494	' asked Mrs Toomey , patting the baby , who was choking himself with his fist . '
38729	38730	38731	38731	I	0	' '
38732	38738	38740	38741	Mrs Toomey	191	'm no hand at arguing , '
38745	38809	38740	38741	Mrs Toomey	191	' but I know you 've some sense , sir , and I do n't think you 'd press a thing like this without there was some rhyme or reason in it ; but the most I can say is , me and Toomey'll talk it over ; but the truth is , I 've never had nothing to say to that sort o '
38823	38860	38907	38907	her	1184	' day . And even if my man agrees , I wo n't promise about it until I 've seen the young woman , for what 's the good of Providence giving us common sense if we 're

38945	38971	38972	38972	I	0	' And as he bade her good - bye he did feel quite sure that he had not spent that half - hour in vain . '
38998	39238	39239	39240	The Children	1187	' But when he reached Mrs Litvinoff 's room he found her out . There was no answer to his repeated knocks , so at last , as the key was in the door , he opened it , almost fearing to find her in another of those fainting fits . But the room was empty . He hesitated a moment , and then entered . It wanted a few minutes to noon ; he would wait till the appointed time , and while he waited he wondered , as he had been wondering all the morning , why she had taken this name of Litvinoff . Was it simply because Litvinoff had been the first name that had come into her head , or for some deeper or more important reason ? The room was very neat , and did not offer much entertainment to the eye or employment to the mind ; but there were four or five books on the mantelpiece , and he was drawn towards them by a natural attraction . It was one of his habits always to take up a book , if one was within reach . They were very nicely bound , he noticed , except two small volumes at the end of the row , in which he smiled rather sadly to recognise a Bible and Prayer Book . He ran over the titles — one or two novels , '

39249	39257	39246	39247	Mrs Hemans	194	' and , strange accompaniment , Swinburne 's '
39262	39278	39246	39247	Mrs Hemans	194	' He took it out and opened it . On the first page was written , '
39285	39323	39283	39283	Litvinoff	180	' He stood looking at it fixedly — so absorbed that he did not hear Alice 's foot on the stairs , nor notice the rustle of her dress in the room , till she said , — '
39355	39405	39346	39346	I	0	' She was a little out of breath with running upstairs , and a little flushed , too . He now saw that she was prettier than he had thought , but he also saw more plainly the hollows in her cheeks and the dark circles round her eyes . '
39412	39428	39406	39406	I	0	' he began at once , turning to her with the book in his hand . '
39456	39477	39478	39478	I	0	' She turned her head and looked towards the window in silence for a moment . Then she said , — '
39514	39545	39548	39548	you	0	' It was said slowly and with evident effort . She threw her bonnet on the table , leaned her elbows on the window - ledge , and looked out . '
39552	39572	39548	39548	you	0	' she asked , after a minute , without looking round . He took a chair , and said , '

39840	40562	40563	40563	You	1200	' It was characteristic of the man who spoke that he should be able to make an appeal which would move this girl , who had not known him twenty - four hours , to tell him all that she had felt it to be impossible to tell her foster - brother , Richard Ferrier . For she did tell him . The substance of her story was this : She had been staying with an aunt who kept a small hotel in Liverpool , when she had met Litvinoff , and had seen a great deal of him . He had seemed to her to be different from all the other men she had ever seen , and though she could not help being pleased by his admiration , she had felt that the difference in their station was such that she could not properly fill the position of his wife . His grave and respectful manner and the perfect deference with which he always treated her had made it impossible for her to suppose that his wish was other than to make her his wife . So , though all her inclinations would have kept her in Liverpool , she had , after a severe struggle with herself , shortened her visit , and returned to Derbyshire without bidding him good - bye . He had followed her , and one evening when she was walking alone she had met him . Of course , there had been explanations . He had implored her not to send him away — to let him be always as happy as he had been that month at Liverpool . He met her objections as to the difference in their position by telling her that he was an outcast and an exile , and had no position . Would she not make his hard life a little easier to him ? At every word he said she felt her resolutions melting away ; but her parents , would they ever consent to her marriage with one who held such opinions as his ? Then he had told her gravely and tenderly that he was at war with society and with most of its conventions , and that for him to marry in the ordinary sense of the word would be to compromise and deny every principle on which his life was founded . The true marriage , he had maintained , was fidelity , and mutual love was more binding than could be a ceremony in which one of the performers did not believe . He loved her he had said , far too dearly to wish to deceive her in the smallest degree about his sentiments , and so he felt bound to tell her that to him a legal marriage would be for ever impossible . In spite of that , would she not be noble enough to trust her life entirely to him , and be his wife ? This had been so completely unexpected as to be a great shock to her , and she had felt at once that , however she might decide , it would be out of the question to tell or ask her parents about it . Her choice lay between them and her lover . We know how she chose . Of her time of happiness she said very little , but her hearer gathered that , though Litvinoff had left her much alone , she had had no reason to doubt that he still cared for her . But the influence of her early training , though it had sunk into abeyance in the hour of strong temptation , had slowly and surely reasserted itself as the months went by . She had striven still to believe that she was acting rightly , but at last it became impossible to her to persuade herself that she had any right to be a law unto herself . So at last she had left her lover , with no farewell but a letter , in which she had tried to tell him how it was . She had felt a pleasure in the hardness of the life that followed — had vaguely felt it to be in some sort an expiation of her wickedness . '

40998	41053	41054	41054	I	0	' Alice knocked at Mrs Toomey 's door about three o'clock that afternoon . Mrs Toomey , her baby in her arms , and an air of reserving judgment about her , showed the room she had to let , which was convenient and exquisitely clean . Alice followed her into the parlour afterwards . '
41063	41068	41054	41054	I	0	' she began confusedly , '
41079	41085	41086	41086	I	0	' The other interrupted her . '

41555	41569	41535	41535	you	1223	' He opened the little crocodile - skin trifle and looked into it . '
41675	41774	41888	41889	Johann Hirsch	222	' He sighed a little , but brightened as his eye fell on the chair which Roland had occupied two nights before . His voice took up the song again as he returned his belongings to something like order . He had just made his sitting - room presentable again when the waiter appeared , and offered , with an air of virtuous and respectful protest , a folded piece of paper , which had been white once , but since that time had apparently sojourned in the pockets of one who carried his meals about with him . '
41780	41789	41888	41889	Johann Hirsch	222	' said Litvinoff , as he took it . '
41799	41800	41888	41889	Johann Hirsch	222	' '
41807	41812	41814	41821	a man who appears to be a foreigner	1231	' said the waiter , '

41840	41887	41888	41889	Johann Hirsch	222	' While his order was being obeyed , Litvinoff looked at the paper again . It was not a letter or a bill , after all ; but seemed intended to answer the purpose of a visiting card , for all that was written on it was '
41891	41995	41888	41889	Johann Hirsch	222	' Litvinoff was not altogether unaccustomed to being called upon by foreign gentlemen with bold and original views on the subject of visiting - cards . He never refused to see any of these visitors , and always sent them away charmed with the beauty of his sentiments and the liberality of his intentions , and occasionally with something more substantial . As the waiter closed the door and retreated with a glance of politely veiled contempt , the man whom he had shown in came forward , and Litvinoff recognised in him at once the person who had been so interested in the '
41998	42013	42014	42014	I	0	' on Sunday evening . He offered the visitor his hand with sunny cordiality . '

42071	42079	42061	42063	the Herr Count	197	' he replied , in that language ; '

42216	42236	42237	42237	I	0	' asked Litvinoff , a shade more interested than if it had been the exiled husband who needed relief . '
42244	42248	42237	42237	I	0	' said Hirsch ; '

42463	42509	42442	42442	he	1252	' A very slight change passed over the Count 's face , and yet there seemed nothing in that speech to stir up uneasiness . The expression was so transient that it escaped the sharp eyes that watched him from under Hirsch 's shaggy eyebrows . '
42520	42549	42442	42442	he	1252	' He rose and unlocked a despatch box and took out a cheque - book . As he took up a pen and sat down he asked , — '

42731	42770	42710	42710	I	0	' said Hirsch , rising as the other held out the cheque , and glancing at the two figures on it , before folding it very small and concealing it in an inner part of his nondescript garments . '

43303	43358	43281	43282	Mr Ferrier	107	' he turned into the coffee - room to wait , still uncertain as to which brother he should see . It was Richard who came down to him after a few minutes — Richard , whose face , ulster , and soft hat all seemed to be of the same shade of drab . '
43365	43369	43281	43282	Mr Ferrier	107	' he said ; '

43706	43733	43691	43691	he	0	' so utterly , so palpably disinterested , that I hope I may without offence say to you what I intended to say to Mr Roland . '
43734	43759	43691	43691	he	0	' I do n't see that anything could be said to my brother without offence that could not equally well be said to me . '
43760	43795	43691	43691	he	0	' This , then , is what I would ask . Is there anything I can do to effect a reconciliation between you and your brother , and prevent this breach from growing wider ? '
43796	43808	43809	43809	Richard	130	' I had never told you that there was any breach , '
43813	43816	43817	43817	he	130	' No , '
43820	43831	43817	43817	he	130	' but all others have not your powers of reticence . '
43832	43843	43691	43691	he	0	' I presume my brother has been confiding in you . '
43844	43882	43884	43884	Litvinoff	121	' Your brother told me — what perhaps his pride forbade him to tell you — that you had accused him of something of which he assured me he was as innocent as — as I am , '
43956	43977	43942	43942	he	121	' If my brother wishes to disprove any charges I may bring , he 'd better disprove them to me . '
43978	44008	43942	43942	he	121	' But are you quite sure that you were not mistaken ? May not your feelings on another matter have predisposed you to believe without evidence enough in this ? '
44009	44016	44018	44018	Richard	130	' I quite fail to understand , '
44022	44043	44018	44018	Richard	130	' Is it not possible that you may have thought of him less as your brother than as your rival ? '
44044	44067	44068	44068	Richard	130	' If you have anything more to say that needs saying , I shall be glad if you will say it plainly . '
44072	44089	44068	44068	Richard	130	' Plainly , then — you also are a suitor for the hand of Miss Stanley ? '
44117	44130	44114	44114	he	130	' May I ask who gave you that piece of false information ? '
44131	44137	44139	44139	Litvinoff	121	' Certainly you may ask , '
44157	44170	44145	44146	Other people	381	' You may ask , but I — I must not reply . '
44171	44217	44238	44238	Litvinoff	121	' It is lucky that I do n't need your answer . There 's only one person who would have told you such a lie , and for the future you 'd better keep your interference for him , as he seems to like it . '
44218	44236	44238	44238	Litvinoff	121	' And you , perhaps you 'd better keep your insolence for those who 'll stand it , '
44246	44286	44238	44238	Litvinoff	121	' Perhaps our next meeting may be in a country where it is customary to avenge insults in some other way than what you call , I think , a rough - and - tumble fight . Au revoir ! '
44287	44314	44316	44316	Richard	130	' You do n't seem to find other countries very anxious to have you , since you have had to run away from one at least , '

THERE are people , we are told , on whom the rapid action of railway travelling acts as a soothing influence ; but to the majority of us , when suffering from any loss or grief , a long train journey is simply maddening . The rattling of the windows , the vibration of the carriage , the banging of doors and shouting of porters at the stations , the prolonged and ear - piercing shriek of the whistle , occurring at such moments as to convince the thinking mind that it is not let off with any good intention or to serve any useful purpose , but simply to gratify the torturing instinct of the engine - driver at the expense of the passengers '

50630	51046	50619	50619	He	297	' He stooped and kissed the stone , almost as though it had been the face of him who lay beneath it . THE train which brought Count Litvinoff from London was punctual to the minute , but the trap which was to take him to Thornsett Edge was not , and he was lounging discontentedly among his rugs and luggage at the melancholy little station of Firth Vale . When Roland had left London , some weeks before , he had parted from Litvinoff with the understanding that he was to spend Christmas with him at Thornsett Edge . Young Ferrier had felt that the Count would be a thousand times better company than his own thoughts , and he preferred asking him to inviting any of his college friends , from whom Richard 's absence would provoke comment , and to whom it would have to be explained . For Richard had gone away , leaving no address save that of a solicitor in London , and he had written to the trustees , and steps were being taken for closing the mill . Roland would rather have been anywhere than near the property he was so soon to lose , but Gates urged him to stay at Thornsett till the New Year , and with Count Litvinoff as his guest he hoped to keep ghosts of old times at bay as successfully in his old home as he could hope to do anywhere else . And Litvinoff had accepted the invitation with fervour , for the Stanleys were back at Aspinshaw . The day he had pitched on for his journey was a bitterly cold one in the middle of December , and the waiting - room at Firth Vale had no big fires , soft carpets , and luxurious lounges . It had nothing but a bench , a table , a Bible , a Prayer - book , and a large stone jug of cold water . Litvinoff was got up quite after the English manner , in a light , long travelling ulster with a hood , and a tourist hat of the same stuff ; but in spite of his precautions against weather he was very cold , and not a little cross at his prolonged waiting . He was just debating whether it would not be better to walk , and trust his traps to the mercy of chance , when the station shivered and shuddered as the '
51048	51149	51210	51210	your	0	' came slowly and heavily in . As it stopped , a stout woman , of about forty - five , with the usual number of blue bandboxes , bundles in handkerchiefs , and brown baskets disposed about her person , came hurrying down the stone steps , accompanied by a hard - featured , grizzled man some years older . Litvinoff watched their descent with a smile , but as they reached the bottom step his face grew suddenly serious . He turned sharply , and , passing into the little waiting - room , became deeply absorbed in the '
51152	51207	51208	51208	I	0	' which hung opposite the door , until the train had glided out of the station . He saw without turning his head that only the woman had gone . The man remained on the platform , gazing after the retreating line of carriages till he started and turned round at Litvinoff 's voice . '

52281	52303	52258	52258	he	135	' said Roland , laughing—'it 's very good as things go — but he has some reason for hating his betters . '
52304	52318	52258	52258	he	135	' Some reason besides the two pounds a week , do you mean ? '
52319	52412	52413	52413	Litvinoff	121	' Yes ; his daughter , an awfully pretty , nice girl , made a fool of herself — but I 'll tell you about that some other time . Shall we go this way ? It is a little longer , but it leads round by Aspinshaw , and I want to call there to ask after Mrs Stanley ; she has a cold . Old Stanley will be delighted to see you ; he 's always talking about you . I do n't know how he stands your revolutionary ideas . '
52416	52457	52413	52413	Litvinoff	121	' I never air them to him . I never talk revolution unless there is some chance of making a convert ; but some things are too impossible , and Mr Stanley as a revolutionist is not to be conceived . '
52458	52520	52258	52258	he	135	' Miss Stanley seems to be quite a convert , however , although she always had a leaning that way . But I do n't think the conversion is a star in your crown . She lays the credit of it to some man — I forget his name — whom she heard in town . I suppose you know him ? '
52521	52569	52258	52258	he	135	' Ah , yes ; I remember Miss Stanley took me down splendidly one morning by saying that now she understood our views , thanks to this man Petrovitch . And I , who had been vainly flattering myself that I had made them intelligible to her ! '
52570	52576	52578	52578	Roland	107	' By George , yes ! '
52583	52607	52578	52578	Roland	107	' That was rather a facer . But then she did n't hear you at the Agora . Is this Petrovitch a gentleman ? '
52608	52660	52258	52258	he	135	' Upon my word , I do n't know . It seems he knows me , but somehow or other we never seem to meet . It is not impossible that I may have known him under some other name . I must ask Miss Stanley to describe him to me . '
52661	52675	52677	52677	Roland	107	' Oh , she 'll do that with a great deal of pleasure , '
52679	52698	52677	52677	Roland	107	' it 's her great topic at present . That 's Aspinshaw , over there to the right . '
52769	52816	52817	52819	La belle Clare	218	' garden . As the two young men walked up the private road they heard from the rear of the house a confused barking of dogs , and above the noise a girl 's clear voice , raised in vain endeavour to still the joyful tumult . '
52821	52842	52817	52819	La belle Clare	218	' Litvinoff spoke softly , raising his hat as though he saw her , and quickening his pace a little . '
52850	52854	52817	52819	La belle Clare	218	' said Roland ; '
52867	52868	52817	52819	La belle Clare	218	' '
52873	52900	52817	52819	La belle Clare	218	' said Litvinoff , and they turned into the stable - yard , passing down by the laurel hedge that alone divided it from the garden . '
52908	53551	52902	52902	God	110	' cried the Count , suddenly stopping ; and then both men sprang through the hedge . No time to go round now , for there had been the sharp report of a gun , a woman 's shriek , and a heavy fall . IT was Sunday afternoon . The rather festive look of Petrovitch 's room , in which he now sat alone , was not , however , due to any desire to specialise the day . He had simply made his home as cheerful as possible because he was about to entertain guests . His table was spread with a snowy cloth , and with the preparations for a tea of a distinctly convivial character . There was jam , and more than one kind of cake ; and the room was further brightened by bunches of chrysanthemums . Chairs were drawn round the fire in an inviting - looking circle . The least cheerful object in the room was the owner of it , who sat in his usual chair between the fire and the writing - table . He looked pale and weary , for the frosty weather had strongly renewed the pain in a wound in his breast — an old wound , and a wound that had just missed being a deadly one . Contrary to his usual custom , he was neither reading nor writing . The pipe he had been smoking had gone out , and his thoughts were far back in the past , among the memories which had re - awakened with that aching in his breast . His thoughts went further back than the date of that wound,—went back to the days before he had lost friends , home , and country . He saw again in fancy the brilliant gaiety of the winters in St Petersburg , he heard again the exquisite music of the concerts and the opera,—the balls where Majesty itself had deigned to be present , with anxious brow and uneasy , restless eyes . His memory dwelt longest on a certain torchlight fête on the Neva , when the ice had been a yard thick , and when the élite had been shut off from the common herd by walls made of blocks of solid ice , between which fir trees were planted ; when coloured lamps and Chinese lanterns had thrown indescribable magic over the crowd of bright military uniforms and the exquisite toilettes of lovely women who had never in all their lives been troubled by any thought of what their dresses cost . And even at this distance he could not think without half a pang of a certain fair - faced girl , with golden hair , who , in her sapphire velvet and swansdown , had been the star of that fête to his boyish eyes . And she had been kind to him on this the last evening he had spent near her before his new faiths and duties had separated him from her for ever . That was the first loss his creed had cost him . He wondered what would be the last — life itself perhaps . Then he fell to thinking how these beliefs of his had grown up . How the reading of a certain book — an English book — had done for his mind what a successful operation for cataract does for one nearly blind — had shown him the facts of life , no longer half hidden in a mist of falsity , but in all their naked truth and ugliness . How for a time he had closed his eyes again and had tried hard to live on in the life of luxury , beauty , love , and ( now he knew ) selfishness which had been his by '
53556	53761	52902	52902	God	110	' He remembered the night when , belated miles from his home , and overtaken by a snowstorm , he had sought refuge in a peasant 's hut , how he had talked to his hosts , how one visit had led to many , and how what he had learned from these miserable serfs had forbidden him to forget or to set aside the teaching of the great author whose book had first set him thinking . He remembered that time , perhaps the happiest in his life , when he first began to write — when the ideas which had so long been seething in his brain had found literary expression . He remembered the joy with which he had corrected his first proof , the pride with which he read his first article in a magazine . So thoroughly back in the old time was he that he had stretched out his hand towards this very magazine , which stood bound on a bookshelf , when a heavy foot sounded on the stairs , and a moment after a knock at the door heralded the entrance of Mr Toomey , whom Petrovitch came forward to greet with an almost courtly welcome . '
53766	53770	52902	52902	God	110	' he said ; '
53784	53785	53790	53790	her	1532	' '
53809	53812	53790	53790	her	1532	' yours . '
53813	53831	53790	53790	her	1532	' Of mine ? I do not happen to possess a young woman , my good Toomey . '
53832	53885	53790	53790	her	1532	' I suppose you and me and my Mary Jane possesses about equal shares of her , then , for I saved her from keeping company with the dead cats and dogs , and you sent her to our place , and now my missus is let in for looking arter her . '
53886	53899	53790	53790	her	1532	' Come to the fire . I hope it 's nothing serious . '
53900	53931	53790	53790	her	1532	' I do n't rightly know . My missus told me I should be better out of the way , and I sent the doctor in as I came by . '
53932	53938	53940	53940	Petrovitch	179	' I am very sorry , '
53942	53965	53940	53940	Petrovitch	179	' but I am sure poor Mrs Litvinoff could not be in better hands than those of your good , kind wife . '

54000	54016	53994	53994	Toomey	177	' And do you really like reading — those sort of books , I mean , '
54021	54024	53994	53994	Toomey	177	' Logic , '
54032	54062	53994	53994	Toomey	177	' I like doing better than reading , but one must read much to be able to do little in the line of work I am on at present . '
54063	54069	54071	54071	Toomey	177	' Your line of work , '
54079	54142	54071	54071	Toomey	177	' is a thing as I never can get to understand . How it 's done , I mean . Now , paving is straightforward . When you 've got a paving - stone you know what it is you 've got , and how far it 'll go , but words is such shifty things , and how you manage to make 'em
54151	54162	53994	53994	Toomey	177	'em mean what you mean is what gets over me . '
54163	54192	53994	53994	Toomey	177	' Perhaps I do n't always make them mean what I mean . Judging by the way people misunderstand what I say — ah ! here is Hirsch , '
54198	54209	53994	53994	Toomey	177	' and Pewtress too . How are you ? Now we 're
54216	54217	54218	54218	He	221	' '
54224	54581	54218	54218	He	221	' said Pewtress , the stone - mason with the intellectual forehead , who had been at Mrs Quaid 's at the last meeting of the Cleon . Mr Hirsch seemed to be in more genial mood than he had been in any of those brief conversations which we hitherto had occasion to report . He had shaved himself — he even appeared to have combed his hair — and he shook hands with Toomey quite warmly and cordially . The host had gone half - way down the stairs to meet his fourth guest — a lame boy , whose crutches made it not easy for him to mount to the height of Petrovitch 's nest . He now returned with him on his arm — and after a general introduction of him to the others they all sat down to tea . Eustace Vernon was a lad of about eighteen , with a pale , highbred - looking face — a rather shy but pleasant manner . He was an enthusiastic admirer of Petrovitch , and since his first acquaintance with the Socialist had made a point of being present at all the meetings on social subjects that he could get to hear of , and could find time to attend . For even the wild enthusiasm of the revolutionary in his teens will not go the length of working a Buddhist miracle and enabling the youthful devotee to be at more than one meeting at the same time . Petrovitch was amused and a little touched by the lad 's undisguised homage — and knowing himself to be responsible for the inflammation of the young man 's mind , felt bound to keep watch lest he should get into trouble before his newly - kindled fire had had time to burn itself down into steadiness . As the meal went on it was noticeable that Vernon 's love of liberty was not inconsistent with a child - like devotion to strawberry jam . Petrovitch might have kept a school of instruction for the benefit of those who are always making such desperate efforts to '
54632	54637	54639	54639	Petrovitch	179	' I had hoped , '
54646	54674	54639	54639	Petrovitch	179	' to have had a lady here to pour tea out for you , but fate has been unpropitious ; Mrs Toomey was not able to come . '
54675	54680	54682	54682	Hirsch	222	' I regret her , '
54684	54700	54682	54682	Hirsch	222	' It always does me much pleasure to meet our good friend 's good wife . '
54713	54721	54723	54723	he	179	' She would have liked to come , '
54773	54809	54759	54759	Vernon	223	' She would have liked to come , but the young woman as lodges with us — that Mrs Let - em - off — is ill , and the missus would n't leave her . '
54810	54829	54741	54742	the Austrian	3564	' Ah , Mrs Litvinoff , it is you mean . I willed to ask you of her . '
54830	54836	54838	54838	Vernon	223	' I beg your pardon , '
54858	54878	54741	54742	the Austrian	3564	' Is that any relation of Count Litvinoff ? I know him . Splendid fellow , is n't he ? '
54879	54891	54893	54893	Toomey	191	' I do n't think as she 's a blessed countess , '
54908	54911	54913	54913	Petrovitch	179	' Oh , '
54915	54941	54913	54913	Petrovitch	179	' there are more Litvinoffs than one . It is not an uncommon name . I myself know more than one family of that name . '
54942	54950	54952	54952	Vernon	223	' Of course you know the Count , '
54958	54995	54952	54952	Vernon	223	' What wonderful adventures he has had . He seems to be a man of splendid character . It must have cost him something to give up his social position and go in for the Revolution . '
54996	55015	54913	54913	Petrovitch	179	' So far as I know Michael Litvinoff , he has never done more than his clear duty . '
55016	55026	55028	55028	Hirsch	222	' What does he do for the Revolution now ? '
55030	55055	55056	55056	Vernon	223	' Well , he does all that any one can do in England . There 's not much else to be done besides talking . '
55071	55080	55082	55082	Hirsch	222	' Oh , yes ; he 'll talk , '
55095	55104	55106	55106	Petrovitch	179	' You are quite right , Mr Vernon , '
55108	55166	55106	55106	Petrovitch	179	' He talks , and talks well ; and , as you say , there is here no other means of helping the cause . And where you have such freedom of speech as in England a man 's tongue is his best weapon , and ought , under existing circumstances , to be his only one . '
55167	55172	55174	55174	Hirsch—'have	226	' The great reforms , '

55225	55241	55242	55242	I	0	' said Pewtress , who spoke with some deliberation , and chose his words carefully . '

55274	55283	55246	55256	most of the foreigners I have had the pleasure of meeting	1545	' said Petrovitch , rising from the table . '

55320	55330	55246	55256	most of the foreigners I have had the pleasure of meeting	1545	' cried Vernon enthusiastically , as they all rose ; '

55368	55389	55345	55345	I	0	' said Hirsch , who seemed to have grown grumpier and grumpier ever since Litvinoff 's name had been introduced , '
55417	55418	55407	55408	Mr Vernon	221	' '
55428	55439	55420	55421	Mr Vernon	221	' said Pewtress , as they gathered round the fire . '
55465	55466	55467	55467	I	0	' '
55491	55514	55482	55482	I	0	' said Petrovitch , handing round a box of thick , short Russian cigarettes , to which his friends all helped themselves ; '
55536	55537	55538	55538	You	1549	' '
55549	55560	55538	55538	You	1549	' said Vernon , fixing his large eyes on Petrovitch ; '
55567	55568	55538	55538	You	1549	' '
55609	55610	55602	55602	Toomey	191	' '
55616	55638	55602	55602	Toomey	191	' said Toomey , picking up a hot coal in his fingers and lighting his cigarette therefrom as his host began . '
55827	55828	55896	55896	your	1555	' '
55836	55866	55896	55896	your	1555	' said the stone - mason , more as an excuse for escaping a moment from the martyrdom of the unaccustomed cigarette than by way of saying anything original . '
55879	55883	55896	55896	your	1555	' Petrovitch replied ; '
55893	55894	55896	55896	your	1555	' '
55899	55909	55896	55896	your	1555	' struck in Vernon , impatient of the interruption . '
55987	55988	55990	55990	you	1555	' '
56002	56007	55990	55990	you	1555	' cried Vernon admiringly . '
56013	56024	55990	55990	you	1555	' Petrovitch went on , ignoring the boy 's compliment . '
56164	56165	56161	56162	the concealers	1570	' '
56177	56195	56175	56175	sir	318	' said Toomey , surreptitiously abandoning his cigarette in favour of the more familiar but slightly stronger smelling '

56209	56210	56203	56203	they	1560	' '
56219	56223	56225	56225	they	1560	' answered Petrovitch ; '

57014	57015	57084	57086	the two sentries	1604	' '
57024	57045	57084	57086	the two sentries	1604	' asked Pewtress , in the perfectly unexcited and matter - of - fact tone of a School Board inspector . '
57048	57056	57084	57086	the two sentries	1604	' said Petrovitch , laughing a little , '
57226	57227	57196	57200	a surprised and indignant gentleman	1616	' '
57239	57245	57235	57237	Mr Peter Hitch	176	' inquired the interested Toomey . '
57275	57276	57277	57283	The gentleman who went for the doctor	1620	' '
57295	57300	57301	57301	He	1620	' put in Vernon . '
57307	57311	57301	57301	He	1620	' said Petrovitch , '

57518	57523	57515	57516	Mr Hearse	231	' said Toomey curiously ; '

57535	57537	57515	57516	Mr Hearse	231	' You 're
57549	57570	57571	57571	I	0	' This Petrovitch spoke with a certain emphasis , and with his eyes not on Toomey , but on Hirsch . '
57582	57586	57571	57571	I	0	' said Vernon , '
57601	57602	57590	57590	you	0	' '
57611	57615	57590	57590	you	0	' returned Petrovitch , '
57635	57649	57627	57627	I	0	' Then as the boy coloured and looked embarrassed , he added kindly , '
57704	57788	57789	57789	My	0	' The Austrian was beginning to protest that nothing had ever happened to him , when a rustle of silk on the stairs outside silenced him , and the men all looked at each other inquiringly in the moment that elapsed before the door was opened and disclosed the velvet bonnet and abundant flounces of Mrs Quaid . Mr Quaid was there , too , but he did not take the eye or captivate the attention . That was Mrs Quaid 's department . '
57838	57872	57889	57889	Petrovitch	179	're all among friends . And you wo n't think me quite an old marplot if I stay for a few moments , for I really have something special to say to you . '
57873	57887	57889	57889	Petrovitch	179	' It 's very good of you to honour me with a call , '
57899	57999	57889	57889	Petrovitch	179	' We have been to see some friends at Regent 's Park , and we are going on to dine with the Pagets—(you know the Pagets , Mr Petrovitch ? No ! Ah , I must introduce you ; they are such sweet people , quite devoted to our side)—and so we thought we would call as we passed to ask you if you will come and dine with us on Tuesday . You 'll excuse an informal invitation , I know . I thought if we came ourselves to ask you we should be more likely to succeed . '
58000	58006	58008	58008	Petrovitch	179	' You are very kind , '
58022	58096	58008	58008	Petrovitch	179	' I had hoped to have had your fellow - countryman , Count Litvinoff , there to meet you ; but I hear he has just gone to Derbyshire ; so unfortunate . I suppose he has gone to stay with the Stanleys . He saved Mr Stanley 's life , you know — Mr Stanley — perhaps you remember his daughter , the sweet girl who sat next you at our house . '
58123	58127	58129	58130	Mrs Quaid	201	' You know , '
58143	58183	58138	58138	she	201	' my daughter Cora thinks that there will be a match there before long . I do so hope that dear interesting Count has not lost all his property . From what I hear he is very well off . '
58184	58194	58196	58197	Mr Quaid	233	' Gentlemen of your opinions ought not to marry , '
58219	58225	58209	58209	He	233	' Mrs Quaid 's husband , '
58230	58233	58235	58235	Petrovitch	179	' Why ? '
58239	58249	58235	58235	Petrovitch	179	' Because your lives are so constantly in danger . '
58250	58259	58262	58262	Hirsch	222	' There 's not much danger in Derbyshire , '
58272	58277	58279	58280	Mrs Quaid	201	' Ah , well , '
58282	58330	58279	58280	Mrs Quaid	201	' I do hope , if anything does come of it , that he will settle down quietly in England . There is so much that wants doing here . We want good , brave workers to strive to bridge over the terrible gulf between the classes . '
58340	58383	58235	58235	Petrovitch	179	' gulf'—which he had quite lost sight of under the influence of Petrovitch 's tact — felt a painfully renewed consciousness of his boots , his hands , and his Sunday clothes . Vernon , who knew Mrs Quaid , and delighted to '
58385	58720	58279	58280	Mrs Quaid	201	' her , would not for the world have missed such an opportunity of amusing himself and his friends . By a skilful question or two he led the lady on to her favourite subject — that of education . She could discuss this question with eloquence , and at any length ; but no matter how her discussions began , they always ended by placing her and her hearers in a difficulty . She was quite clear that before we could educate our children we must be educated ourselves , which , on the face of it , seemed reasonable ; but , then , who was there to educate us ? To that question no answer could ever be found ; and in the meantime , what was to become of the rising generation ? She had nearly reached this point when her husband , who had been present before when she trotted round this circle of argument , and for whom the repetition of the performance had no charms , brought the conversation back to the world of possibilities by renewing the invitation for Tuesday , which Petrovitch , after a little hesitation , accepted . When the gros grain silk had swept down the uncarpeted stairs , and Petrovitch had accompanied it to the front door and received the last nod of farewell from the imposing plume in the velvet bonnet , he returned to his room , to find the spirits of his friends visibly higher , except those of Vernon , who felt that he had been done out of the cream of his proposed joke . The evening slipped by pleasantly enough , but there were no more adventures told , nor was Count Litvinoff mentioned again , until one by one all the guests had departed except Hirsch . He stayed on , smoking in silence , and his host , equally silent , sat on the opposite side of the fire , regarding it fixedly . '
58723	58736	58279	58280	Mrs Quaid	201	' said Hirsch , at last turning his eyes towards the other , '
58793	58794	58789	58789	you	1648	' '
58797	58802	58789	58789	you	1648	' said Petrovitch slowly . '
58811	58815	58817	58818	Count Litvinoff	121	' THANK God ! '
59023	59030	59031	59031	he	107	' Take her in , Litvinoff , '
59038	59044	59031	59031	he	107	' make her go in . '
59045	59059	59061	59061	Litvinoff	121	' Come in , Miss Stanley ; you can do no good here , '
59077	59082	59083	59083	she	218	' Let me alone , '
59086	59099	59072	59072	She	218	' How dare you interfere ? Let me go to my father . '
59100	59133	59072	59072	She	218	' Miss Stanley , be reasonable . You can do much more good in the house . Do n't you know we must bring your father in?—and your mother must be told . '
59231	59235	59236	59236	she	218	' Go in , '
59241	59255	59236	59236	she	218	' and send for Doctor Bailey . Thomas can go on Red Robin . '
59267	59270	59236	59236	she	218	' Come , '
59301	59306	59307	59307	she	218	' Oh , Thomas — '
59314	59358	59311	59311	Litvinoff	121	' Saddle Red Robin , and ride for Doctor Bailey — ride fast for your life ! Now , Miss Stanley , for Heaven 's sake do n't give way ; keep up . They may want linen for bandages , and brandy . '
59396	59400	59401	59401	he	121	' Sit down , '
59421	59439	59401	59401	he	121	' Drink , and then you will be able , perhaps , to be of some use . '
59501	59509	59510	59510	she	218	' I will go to my father , '
59523	59532	59510	59510	she	218	' Twenty of you shall not stop me ! '
59543	59599	59533	59533	Litvinoff	121	' Wait , wait ; they are getting him to his bed . You would only be in the way . Trust me , Miss Stanley . I would not keep you from him if you could be of any use to him . You may be of real service by - and - by . '
59600	59604	59605	59605	she	218	' Very well , '
59608	59655	59605	59605	she	218	' I will do what you tell me . But , oh , tell me all you know ; tell me where he 's hurt ; did you see ? Will it be dangerous ? For pity 's sake tell me what you saw , whether — '
59722	59737	59710	59710	she	218	' Do n't tell me — don't tell me anything — let me go ! '
59754	59759	59761	59761	Roland	107	' He 's dead , '
59763	59793	59761	59761	Roland	107	' I know . I knew that directly I put my hand on him . I have had my hand on a man shot dead before to - day . '
59868	59886	59865	59865	he	107	' Good God , Litvinoff , what a terrible thing ! What a frightful blow for them ! '
59887	59893	59857	59857	Roland	107	' Does Mrs Stanley know ? '
59894	59897	59865	59865	he	107	' Yes . '
59898	59907	59865	59865	he	107	' How soon can the doctor be here ? '
59908	59927	59857	59857	Roland	107	' In half - an - hour ; but he 'll be no good when he does come . '
59928	59953	59954	59954	Roland	107	' Not for him , but Miss Stanley may need him . Her face as she passed out of the door was not reassuring . '
59958	59966	59967	59967	he	107	' What a horrible world it is ! '
59994	60002	59992	59992	him	107	' It never rains but it pours . '
60014	60021	60023	60024	the other	305	' It is a horrible world , '
60026	60046	60023	60024	the other	305	' but reflecting on that truth will not aid anyone just now . Is there nothing we can do ? '
60047	60064	59992	59992	him	107	' Not that I know of , but we wo n't go till the doctor comes . '
60065	60105	60106	60106	Roland	107	' Certainly not ; and in the meantime let me suggest that a little of this brandy would not be amiss , if you do n't want him to find a patient in you . You look uncommonly shaky . '
60115	60128	60106	60106	Roland	107	' Miss Stanley 's mother seems to have her wits about her ? '
60129	60154	59992	59992	him	107	' Yes , Mrs Stanley 's a sensible woman — but she 's not Miss Stanley 's mother . Mr Stanley was married twice . '
60155	60162	60106	60106	Roland	107	' There are no other children ? '
60163	60166	60106	60106	Roland	107	' No . '
60167	60171	60173	60173	Litvinoff	121	' Poor woman , '
60196	60206	60209	60209	Litvinoff	121	' He seems to have been a rich man , '
60216	60245	60247	60247	Roland	107	' Yes , he had more than he knew what to do with . It seems hard that he should have had to leave it all so suddenly , '

60364	60509	60510	60511	Mrs Stanley	216	' Roland did not answer . There are moments when moral reflections are particularly hateful . The doctor arrived sooner than they had hoped , the man - servant having met him about half - way between Aspinshaw and his own house , but of course he could only confirm what they all knew . The whole contents of the gun had lodged in the lungs , and death must have been instantaneous . He asked the two young men a good many questions as to the manner of the accident , but of course they had not seen it , and were unable to throw any light on the cause of the disaster . He must have been carrying the gun full - cock , and the concussion , when he brought the butt down on the ground , must have started it . '

Roland Ferrier and Michael Litvinoff walked home almost in silence , consumed a dinner enlivened by Miss Letitia 's comments on the events of the day , and , when she had retired in tears , passed one of the most melancholy evenings in the recollection of either . Roland did his best to perform the difficult part of genial host to the guest who had been introduced to Thornsett under such inauspicious circumstances ; but he was a young man who had not that within him which enables men to resist the influence of the immediately surrounding circumstances , and his attempt was a dead failure . Litvinoff could , perhaps , have succeeded with a desperate effort in raising the cloud of gloom that hung over them both , but it did not seem to him that the game was quite worth the candle , and he let it alone . Under the circumstances there could be no shooting , and none of such social entertainments as would certainly otherwise have enlivened his visit , and the prospect of his first Christmas in an English country - house looked very bleak . '
60788	60822	60782	60782	one	504	' he said aloud to himself , when , the long evening over , he reached his bedroom , and sank down into an easy - chair before the brightly - burning fire . '

61186	61284	61185	61185	I	0	'm not afraid of that , anyhow , nor of anything that may come after . I 've got memories enough to make a hell of my own here , and death would be the end of them , at any rate , not the beginning . And yet one must live , I suppose , though I do n't feel so sure of that to - night . Poor little girl — dear little girl ! I wish you were the heiress of Aspinshaw .

62071	62125	62054	62055	the Count	3057	' is just about two pounds a week . Now the other day you said that two pounds a week was " not so bad " for a man with a family ; and , with all your misfortunes , you are not what you English people call " a family man . " '
62126	62142	62054	62055	the Count	3057	' But then you must remember how differently those sort of people are brought up . '

62169	62199	62054	62055	the Count	3057	' No . What do they care about music or art or poetry or travelling ? Fortunately for them they have n't the tastes that run away with money . '

62431	62446	62417	62417	She	367	' Litvinoff mentally endorsed this statement to the full . Aloud he said , — '

62638	62674	62635	62635	Roland	107	' more likely some fool of a counter - jumper or clerk . You know I looked upon her quite as my sister , and I was very fond of her , and all that . '

62987	63241	63245	63245	man	473	' That evening John Hatfield was sitting on the oak settle by his hearth , his wife with her knitting in the substantial rocking - chair opposite . The interior was cosy and bright enough . A high wooden screen protected the inmates from any cold air that might else have come through the door , which opened straight from the house - place into the street . A short red curtain hung in front of the long low window , that was nearly as wide as the room itself . There was a chintz flounce to the chimney - piece , and a bright round table , on three legs , in the middle of the room . There was a good deal of shining brass about , and a few pieces of old china . Mrs Hatfield , a small fair woman , with grey , short - sighted eyes , had more lines in her face than her years should have traced there . But the poor age much more rapidly than the rich . Significant reflection . And every trouble leaves its signet on our faces , and Mrs Hatfield 's trouble had been a heavy one , and its traces were easily discernible . So thought Count Litvinoff , as he tapped at the door and entered John Hatfield 's house , and the thought was not a pleasant one . Derbyshire was certainly not the place to come to for pleasant thoughts , or pleasant incidents either . '
63247	63271	63245	63245	man	473	' said Hatfield , leaning forward to discern the features of his visitor in the comparative gloom by the door where he stood . '

64122	64168	64119	64119	he	1783	' for calling on you on Sunday afternoon , which , I believe , is not the rule in England ; but I heard that you were leaving Aspinshaw to - morrow , and I could not run the risk of not seeing you again . '

64350	64372	64239	64239	Litvinoff	121	' Ah , yes , I had forgotten that . What a horrible thing ! What are they going to do ? '

70939	70954	70926	70926	Litvinoff	121	' he said , and at the same moment a voice outside cried , — '
70963	70976	70926	70926	Litvinoff	121	' Old Clayton 's voice sounded thin and shrill above the uproar . '
71001	71021	71022	71022	They	1128	' The men seemed to hesitate a minute , and then to obey , reluctantly moving towards the gate . '
71034	71077	71022	71022	They	1128	' said the Count ; but even as he spoke a big stone , thrown by some strong hand , came crashing through the window , and rolled , muddy and grey , on to the edge of the soft fur hearthrug . '
71080	71085	71086	71086	I	0	' cried Roland furiously , '
71097	71139	71089	71093	the fellow who did that	1985	' He made a dash for the door , but Litvinoff caught him by the shoulders , and there was a struggle , silent and brief , which ended in Roland 's standing still , and looking at the other savagely . '
71150	71155	71156	71156	they	1128	' shouted the Count ; '
71163	71210	71211	71211	Roland	107	' worth of damage now , but they 'll perhaps add murder to it if you go outside . Do be reasonable , Ferrier . There , they 've gone now ; and if you went out you could n't identify the man who did it . '

71233	71237	71217	71217	himself	107	' he said ; '
71252	71442	71239	71239	I	0	' It was perhaps as well for Roland 's self - esteem and peace of mind that he did not hear the strictures that were passed upon him by the men as they returned towards the village . Hope deferred maketh the heart sick , but when a new - born hope is killed , and killed cruelly and suddenly , there comes sometimes something more terrible than heart - sickness and more dangerous . The moon had flung aside the slight mist which had covered her face earlier in the evening , and now shone full on the valley , towards which the crowd were making their way . As they turned the corner which brought them in sight of the mill whose doors none of them were to pass again , a burst of curses and oaths broke from the men and fell on the still air , violating and outraging the peace and beauty of the night . At this moment Hatfield and Murdoch , walking together from the village to meet them , came up and were promptly informed of the result of the interview . '
71449	71454	71447	71447	lads	455	' said old Murdoch . '
71465	71485	71462	71462	Ah	1987	' Then looking down at the mill he pointed towards it , and went on in a loud voice , '

71762	71813	71721	71721	he	3994	' house became every moment more and more popular , and the crowd had actually faced round and begun that swaying movement which in an undisciplined body always , for a moment or two , precedes a start , when Hatfield spoke out at the top of his voice , — '
71817	71821	71721	71721	he	3994	' he said . '

72002	72181	71954	71958	a voice from the rear	2002	' This suggestion , probably because its adoption was a trifle less dangerous than wrecking a house , some of whose inmates were young men — possibly young men with firearms — was received with almost unanimous applause . In less time than it takes to tell , a hundred pieces of the rock of which the Derbyshire walls are built had begun to rattle on the roof and smash the windows of the mill below , and two or three pairs of strong arms had torn away a huge boulder of grey stone which , held in its place by creepers and earth , overhung the descent , and had set it rolling down the steep decline . It bounded on to the slated roof of the mill , and with a great crash went right through it , leaving a large black gap . Then the men set up a yell that made the country round ring again . When it had died away old Murdoch , who was beside himself with excitement , shouted out , '

73723	73732	73720	73720	he	121	' this is a gift from the gods ! '

76523	76662	76518	76518	he	2163	' You may remember that what impressed you most in my fellow - countryman Petrovitch 's address was the self - abnegation which ran all through it . My countryman was right . Self - abnegation is the note of the Revolution ! On the first day of this new year you honoured me by asking me what good you could do . I tell you now . You can save many of these men from prison , and their wives from harder fare than the prison 's , by humbling your pride and asking what will not be refused . Forgive me if I speak plainly , but it is not for my own sake I would ask you to do anything now . It is for these men , and for the sake of the cause . '

The two girls were sitting very snugly in Miss Quaid 's special sanctum , where were enshrined her girlish treasures , her books , and the accessories of the art in which she hoped some day to rival Rosa Bonheur . Having had a picture admitted to the Academy the season before , she was more hopeful and consequently more industrious than ever . But on this afternoon she had not been painting . She had been sitting looking at her friend and thinking what a pretty picture she made with her sweet serious face and sombre crape draperies ; but even the contemplation of one 's prettiest friend will become fatiguing at last , when talking is one 's very greatest pleasure . So Cora broke silence with the remark we have reported , and the silence she broke had been a very long one . '

78351	78364	78365	78365	Clare	253	' Oh no , she would n't read it for the world . '
78381	78387	78388	78388	Cora	236	' One would have thought , '
78392	78455	78388	78388	Cora	236	' that " God and the State " would have been something very religious — something like Mr Gladstone , you know . A man ought n't to call his book by a title that has nothing to say to the book itself . It 's so misleading . Clare , I rather wonder Count Litvinoff should lend you such dreadful books . '

78715	78751	78712	78712	I	0	'm not advanced enough , but it does n't seem to me to be anything like so clearly written , nor so forcible . It seems wonderful that the same man should have written both . '
78752	78788	78803	78803	her	139	' Perhaps it was written since he has been in exile , and he was wretched and out of sorts . By the way , he does n't seem wretched now . Now , Clare , '
78818	78871	78803	78803	her	139	' I think it is only due to our ancient friendship — which , you remember , was founded on the noble principle , halves and no secrets , that you should confide in me . What are you going to do with him ? How are you going to serve him ? '
78872	78906	78712	78712	I	0	' Well , dear , would it be best to grill him or to serve him on toast with caviare ? How would it look on the menu ? Nihiliste à la Révolution . '
78907	78976	78803	78803	her	139	' Count Litvinoff à la married man would be more humane , perhaps . I wonder how it feels to be adored by a lover who has passionate eyes and a long blond moustache , who has had no end of adventures , has as many lives as a cat , and seems to be rolling in gold , judging by the bouquets he brings to — mamma . '
78977	78986	78988	78988	Clare	139	' If you are very anxious to know , '
79000	79019	78988	78988	Clare	139	' you had better try to attract him ; I do n't fancy you would find it difficult . '
79020	79050	78803	78803	her	139	' You do n't seem to have found it so . Really and truly , Clare ; do you mean to be a countess ? Shall you refuse him ? '
79051	79068	78803	78803	her	139	' He has never asked me but one thing , and that I did not refuse . '
79069	79084	78988	78988	Clare	139	' What a teasing girl you are ! Does that mean anything or nothing ? '
79085	79092	78803	78803	her	139	' Whichever you like , sweetheart . '
79093	79133	78803	78803	her	139	' Well , he deserves a better fate than to be allowed to singe his wings at the flame of your prettiness . You always were a flirt , Clare ; and I am afraid you have not improved . '
79134	79144	79145	79145	Clare	139	' I do n't think I have ever flirted , '
79152	79208	79145	79145	Clare	139	' but I know I have been foolish enough to wish people to like me and to be interested in me . But you do n't know how contemptible all that sort of thing seems to me now . Fancy caring about the opinion of people when you do n't care about the people themselves . '
79209	79234	78803	78803	her	139	' Well , any one can see he 's over head and ears in love with you — you nice , pretty little woman . '
79235	79240	79241	79241	Clare	139	' I hope not , '
79244	79257	79241	79241	Clare	139	' for I am not in the least in love with him . '
79258	79286	78803	78803	her	139	' Then do n't you think it 's a little too bad of you to encourage him as you do — reading his books and all that ? '
79287	79371	79378	79378	her	2214	' I do n't know what " all that " may be , but as for the books he lends me , they do n't borrow their interest from him . Every book I read seems to draw up a curtain and let new light into my mind . You ca n't imagine how different everything is to me since I began to read and to try to think . All that I have learned lately is like a new religion to me . '
79390	79437	79383	79383	her	2214	' And I read all I can because I want to understand well enough to teach other people what I feel to be true . And oh , Cora ! I do so want to do something to help the poor and show them their position . '
79438	79487	78803	78803	her	139	' Yes ; I quite agree with you that they ought to know their position and keep in it . The Catechism tells us that , you know . I should think you might employ half a dozen curates . Papa says there are lots out of work . '
79488	79537	79545	79545	Cora	236	' I do n't think curates are quite what are wanted . There are curates enough and to spare . Besides , " The millions suffer still and grieve , And what can helpers heal , With old world cures they half believeFor woes they wholly feel ? " '
79538	79543	79545	79545	Cora	236	' That sounds dreadful , '
79547	79559	79545	79545	Cora	236	' Why , you used to be so fond of it ! '
79560	79589	79545	79545	Cora	236	' Yes ; but I did n't think it meant anything so wicked as that ; and , what 's more , I do n't believe it does . '
79590	79659	79545	79545	Cora	236	' I have n't changed the words , Cora . I did not say they meant anything more than they have always meant . But , you see , too , do n't you , what a ghastly mockery it is to send religious teaching to people who never had a good dinner in their lives ? What a frightful system it is that allows all these horrors ! '
79660	79705	79545	79545	Cora	236	' But , my dearest Clare , even if it is horrible , I do n't see what you can do to alter it . Why , papa was saying only the other night that the social order was never so strong as now . '

80684	81294	80678	80678	I	0	' At eight o'clock that evening Petrovitch stood in the softly - lighted hall of Marlborough Villa . He felt more interested in the coming evening than he generally was on such occasions . Hirsch , who was with him , was very much surprised to find himself within the portals of one of those middle - class establishments against which he had always inveighed so bitterly . But Mrs Quaid 's manner had overborne his determinations with its resistless flow of gush , and he had accepted her invitation from sheer inability to edge in a word of refusal . He had been in a state of mingled remorse and terror ever since , and only Petrovitch 's strong representations to the effect that men who set themselves against Society should at least not fall below Society in the matter of keeping their word , had induced him to face the dreadful ordeal of meeting half - a - dozen well - dressed Social Reformers in a large and luxurious drawing - room . It would be impossible for any human being to be quite as glad to see any other human being as Mrs Quaid appeared to be to see her two new friends . They came in together , and while Hirsch looked round on the handsome furniture with a savagely appraising glance , prompted equally by his Jewish blood and his Socialistic convictions , Petrovitch , having seen that Clare was present , delivered himself an unresisting prey to his hostess , knowing that to even her eloquence an end must come , and knowing , too , that sooner or later he would find himself beside the girl whom his paper on Socialism had seemed to impress so much , the first time he had ever been in that room . He had been in that room more than once since but never without seeing a very vivid vision of the fair face , shining eyes , and red lips , slightly parted in the interest of listening , the girlish figure bent forward the better to catch every word of his . It was not only the flattery of her undisguised interest in him which had painted for him this memory - picture , and had given him a constantly - recurring desire to see the original again . He was pretty well skilled by this time in reading the faces of his fellow - creatures , and when all the thanks and congratulations of the Cleon 's visitors were ringing in his ears , he had known perfectly well that the only heart he had touched , the only mind that had followed his reasoning , and the only soul that understood him , were those of the dark - eyed girl at his side . And the look those dark eyes had given him when he said good - night , had haunted him ever since . From the seat of honour on the sofa beside Mrs Quaid , Petrovitch looked , perhaps rather longingly , towards the other end of the room , where Hirsch and Vernon were talking to the two girls . It was unworthy weakness , perhaps , in a Friend of Humanity , but he could not help straining his ears to try to catch what they were saying , and wondering what subject they could be discussing to bring such interest into Clare 's face . This effort interfered somewhat with the lucidity of his replies , until Mr Quaid , who had hardly spoken before , brought him up short with the question , — '
81305	81321	81297	81297	you	2246	' and the Socialist , with an imperceptible shrug of the shoulders and a sort of '
81330	81530	81531	81531	I	0	' feeling , gave up trying to do two things at once , and plunged heart and soul into explanations , knowing quite well neither of his hearers would understand them . If there is any truth in the old adage his ears should have burned , for the group at the end of the room were discussing nothing less than himself . An enthusiastic remark from Vernon and sympathetic rejoinders from Clare and Cora had sufficed to mitigate in the Austrian that sense of being trapped by the enemy with which he had entered the room , for he saw that these young people had , at anyrate , one thing in common with him — a great respect for and interest in his Russian friend . And knowing this , his tongue was loosed ; and his love of his friend overcoming in some degree the difficulties presented to him by the English language , he began to tell tale after tale of Petrovitch 's kindness , bravery , self - sacrifice , and nobility . His knowledge of English had improved in the last four months , and his hearers found it easy to understand him . '
81540	81546	81535	81535	him	2247	' he said at last ; '
81567	81568	81569	81569	I	0	' '
81578	81584	81572	81572	him	2247	' chimed in young Vernon ; '

81632	81644	81621	81621	you	0	' said Hirsch , with some return to his normal grumpiness . '
81653	81658	81621	81621	you	0	' put in Clare ; '
81685	81686	81695	81696	Count Litvinoff	121	' '
81689	81694	81695	81696	Count Litvinoff	121	' said Miss Quaid . '
81734	81739	81725	81726	Count Litvinoff	121	' Hirsch smiled sardonically . '
81795	82010	82011	82013	The poor woman	2258	' It was on your Christian festival of Christmas — in a Russian town , no matter to name it — there was a chase , and all the townspeople turned out of their doors for the pleasure - excitement of seeing it . The chased ? Only a poor woman , on her way from Moscow to the Austrian frontier . Her crime ? She was a Jewess . For this , men and boys , with savage dogs , with sticks , with stones , with all that their devilish brutality told them to use against her , hunted her down , shouting , deriding , exulting . And she fled from them , but slowly , for she was not young . And those who took no part in the bloody pursuing looked on , smiling , many of them , and those who smiled not , with interest ; men who were well born , and had not the ignorant superstition for whose sake we can pardon any crime to the poor . Those who hunted her were men who knew not their right hand from their left — thanks to their priests — and those who looked on approving were men of your world—"cultured , " how you say ? '
82072	82283	82284	82284	He	2262	' She looked around ; no way of escape . The driver of the tarantass raised his whip . He , too , would taste the pleasures of cruelty . She threw her arms up , and called upon Jehovah , whom she worshipped . Before the lash could fall , from within the tarantass sprang a young man , and snatched from the driver 's hand the whip . To let it fall on her with more force ? Not so . To sweep it full across the faces of the foremost in the crowd . He caught the despised Jewess in his arms , and lifted her into his carriage . The crowd — cowards as well as bullies — drew back . He sprang upon the seat beside the driver , seized the reins , turned the horses , and to them , too , used the whip — so well , that he carried away from that Russian town the saved life of a woman . He took her to a place of safety , and when she was strong enough sent her to join her son in Vienna . She was my mother . She owed her salvation from a death shameful and agonising to — '
82310	82326	82306	82306	he	2262	' Such is my friend . Your Count Litvinoff — would he so have acted ? '
82338	82373	82374	82374	Hirsch	222	' Indeed he would . Only a little while ago he risked his life , not to save life , but to save working men from injuring their own cause , by wild violence . '
82384	82387	82388	82388	he	222	' Possibly , '
82391	82407	82388	82388	he	222	' it may be I misjudge him , but for me he is too brilliant . '
82521	82524	82531	82532	Mrs Quaid	201	' General Post '
82762	82780	82781	82781	she	139	' I find you have not yet converted Mrs Quaid to all your views , Mr Petrovitch , '
82784	82798	82781	82781	she	139	' I fear you have not been making good use of your time . '
82843	82852	82853	82853	Clare	139	' I might almost have said our views , '
82876	82896	82853	82853	Clare	139	' for I have been thinking a great deal of all you said last time I met you here . '
82897	82903	82904	82904	he	179	' I knew you would , '
82908	82948	82904	82904	he	179	' And I have been reading a little too . I have borrowed some books of Count Litvinoff — one or two of his own . You know Count Litvinoff ? You have read his books , of course ? '
82949	82956	82957	82957	he	179	' Yes , I know them , '
82960	82988	82957	82957	he	179	' The writer is happy if he has shown your eyes the truth — more happy , I fear , than you will be in seeing it . '
82989	83080	82904	82904	he	179	' Oh , I do n't know that it has made me unhappy , quite . I am perplexed and bewildered ; but , however that may be , I do n't owe it to Count Litvinoff , but to you ; and that is why I am going to ask you to help me to see my way a little more clearly . I did ask Count Litvinoff what he thought — but — at any rate , I want to know what you think I ought to do . '
83081	83110	82957	82957	he	179	' I do not know that in your position you can do much except spread the light by telling the truth to every one who will receive it . '
83111	83156	83157	83157	His	2278	' But I think I can do more . Do you know , I am very rich ? I have — oh , ever so much a year , and it is all my own now , to do just what I like with . '
83185	83222	83173	83174	the two	2933	' The money was made by other people 's losses . I know that , and I feel that the money is not my own . The question is , how can I best use it ? '
83223	83239	83157	83157	His	2278	' You asked Count Litvinoff this ? May I in turn ask how he answered ? '
83240	83247	83248	83248	Clare	139	' He thought — he said — '
83258	83308	83309	83309	men	466	' she finished . Clare started at a sudden angry light that came into the eyes of the man beside her . She felt she had been indiscreet and even guilty . For she remembered how Litvinoff had followed his refusal of counsel by telling her how that there were '
83350	83373	83374	83374	You	2284	' Suppose Petrovitch were one of these men ! Clare did not wait for him to speak , but answered the look . '
83380	83384	83385	83385	I	0	' she said . '
83419	83420	83404	83404	you	2284	' '
83432	83444	83404	83404	you	2284	' Petrovitch answered , passing his hand over his long beard . '
83466	83522	83452	83452	You	2284	' The question was asked earnestly , and not impertinently , and Clare felt no inclination to resent it . There was a short silence between them , and it was manifest to them that Mrs Quaid was holding the Philistines enthralled by her views on education . Miss Stanley answered slowly and softly , — '
83577	83644	83571	83571	me	0	' Then she told of the part he had played in the unfortunate scene at the mill , and his conduct lost nothing in the telling . Insensibly led on by Petrovitch 's well - managed prompting in monosyllables she went on to what had come after , and how she had been made the means of changing Roland Ferrier 's determination to prosecute and punish the '
83647	83648	83571	83571	me	0	' '
83651	83660	83571	83571	me	0	' said Petrovitch , when she had finished , '

83759	83764	83753	83753	I	0	' she said impulsively . '
83768	83850	83863	83863	he	0	'm young and foolish , and that I shall be changeable . You think I have taken up these beliefs without enough thought or understanding . If I could only tell you ... how altered everything seems , what a splendid new light seems to be breaking over everything . Do you think , what you said just now , that knowing the truth could make me unhappy ? Oh no . It is knowledge without action that makes me sad . '
83851	83862	83863	83863	he	0	' No , no ; that is not my thought , '
83880	83935	83863	83863	he	0	' Think a little longer . Whatever action you take will not lose strength because it is well thought , well considered . If you ever ask me again , I promise you I will not hesitate a moment to answer ; but I would rather the answer came from you than from me . '
83936	83952	83863	83863	he	0	' That 's one of your leading principles , is n't it ? Independent thought . '
83953	83978	83863	83863	he	0	' Yes . How can people ever hope to act rightly , if they will persist in delegating other people to think for them ? '
83979	84008	83863	83863	he	0	' But ordinary people ca n't thoroughly think out all subjects . One is obliged to take a great many of one 's opinions at second - hand . '
84009	84089	83863	83863	he	0	' Well , but neither can one act in all directions — and where one has to act one should think first . As for taking opinions at second - hand , that is a thing you should never dare to do . If you are not able to think for yourself , you should have no opinions . Your English Clifford has told you that if you have no time to think you have no time to believe . '
84090	84131	83863	83863	he	0	' I am sure you are right . But I am sure , too , that to think for one 's self means in most circles social ostracism ; and it wants very strong convictions to make one face that . '
84132	84136	84138	84139	the Socialist	3756	' Social ostracism , '
84152	84168	84138	84139	the Socialist	3756	' social ostracism , and by whom imposed ? Look at the people around you . '
84176	84392	84173	84174	Mrs Quaid	201	' See how small are their aims , how trivial their interests , how great their love of ease , how small their love of truth ; see what narrow minds they have , what blinded eyes ; see all the good that would be in them crushed out by the very conventionalities which they uphold . How can we think it of any value , the opinion of such as these ? Or if their condemnation should pain us , what a little thing is such a pain compared with the lifelong con sciousness of having , from the fear of it , crushed out the spark of truth in our own souls ? What a little thing compared with eternal truth is even life itself ! We come out of the darkness , and into that darkness must return . Is it not better , seeing the little time that is ours , to know that we at least have listened to the wail of agony that ever goes up to the deaf heavens?—that we have done what we could in our little day to help forward a better time for those who shall come after us , than to know that we have had the good opinion of " respectable people " ? '
84393	84406	84408	84408	Clare	139	' If one could only hope that one could help it forward ! '
84410	84517	84518	84518	He	2295	' Hope ? We know it . These things will be . It is a question of the little sooner or the little later . There is no standing still . He that is not with us is against us . But we shall triumph in the end . We know that all this misery , all this sin , all this selfishness , all this stupidity even , are the direct result of the social milieu . It is this knowledge that makes us the deadly enemies of the Capitalist system , and that is why we are hated by those who profit by it . '
84567	84616	84559	84559	he	2295	' If I have not given you advice , I have at least given you a sermon . You see I already look upon you as one of us , or I should not have dared to outrage conventionalities by speaking in earnest in a drawing - room . '
84617	84625	84627	84628	Mrs Quaid	201	' Oh , my dear Mr Petrovitch , '
84651	84701	84636	84636	her	201	' you are really too severe ! I hope all of us , at anyrate , always speak in earnest , though of course , some of us are more earnest than others . That delightful Count Litvinoff , now — so devoted , and yet so cheerful ; I 'm
84712	84713	84636	84636	her	201	' '
84722	84749	84718	84720	a universal favourite	2298	' answered Petrovitch , who had risen on his hostess 's approach , and now stood with his hand on the back of Clare 's chair . '
84770	84821	84822	84822	I	0	' She glanced almost imperceptibly at Clare . Petrovitch noted the glance , and he fancied that Clare noted it too , and that it called up a faint blush into her face . But Mrs Quaid 's drawing - room was discreetly lighted , and perhaps he was mistaken . '
84828	84835	84822	84822	I	0	' the good lady went on , '
84876	84893	84904	84904	herself	2305	' Petrovitch bowed . As Hirsch and Petrovitch went away together , the Austrian said , — '
84917	84918	84904	84904	herself	2305	' '
84924	84929	84904	84904	herself	2305	' the other answered , '
84940	84941	84904	84904	herself	2305	' '
84944	85070	84904	84904	herself	2305	' grunted Hirsch ; and the two men fell to smoking silently . IT took Richard Ferrier just three months to decide what course his future life should take . He was too old for the Army or Civil Service . The Church was equally out of the question , for a reason equally potent . Need we say that his first idea had been to earn his living by literature ? In these days of extended education and cheap stationery , it always is the very first idea of any one whose ordinary source of income is suddenly cut short . Richard had always felt at college that he had a decided faculty for writing ; but an uninterrupted stream of returned MS . , '
85075	85566	85570	85570	Ah'm	2308	' by all sorts and conditions of editors , convinced him in less than three months that , if writing indeed were his vocation , it was one that he must forego until he could pay for the publishing of his own works , which was not exactly the view he had in wishing to adopt it . He had no interest in the law , and he knew well enough that he had not talent to enable him to dispense with interest . Besides , his leanings had never been that way . The medical profession inspired him with far more interest . His favourite study had always been biology . He had enough money to live on sparingly till the necessary four years should have expired , and it seemed to him better to adopt a profession than to go in for trade in any form or shape . He had had enough of trade . He made a round of visits among special chums of his own , and during the time so occupied had thought long and seriously about his future , and , of all the ideas that came to him , that of being a doctor was the one with most attractions and fewest drawbacks . So early in March he entered himself as a student at Guy 's , determined to throw himself heart and soul into his new career , and to let the dead past be . No return to the conditions of that past seemed possible to him , and , though he determined to think of it as little as he could , there were some things about it that haunted him disturbingly . But he hoped , among new friends and with new ambitions , to forget successfully . A man has his life to live , and life is not over at twenty - five , even when one has lost father , fortune , and heart 's desire . One windy , wild , bright March morning he was walking up to the hospital as usual from his lodgings in Kennington . He looked as cheerful as the morning itself as he strode along with an oak stick in his hand , and under his arm two or three shiny black note - books with red edges . Opposite St Thomas 's Street he paused to watch for a favourable moment in which to effect a crossing ; and before he had time to plunge into the chaos of vans , omnibuses , cabs , carriages , trucks , barrows and blasphemy , the touch of a hand on his arm made him turn sharply round . It was his foster - mother , with a basket on her arm , her attire several shades shabbier than he had been used to see it , and her worn face lighted up with pleasure at meeting him . '
85580	85594	85595	85595	I	0	' she said earnestly , as he turned and shook her hand heartily . '
85606	85625	85595	85595	I	0	' shoulders like these , and I know'd it was thee or Rowley the minute Ah seed thee . '

87639	87647	87598	87598	he	130	'm so sorry , Mr Richard ; I 'm
87671	87713	87668	87669	Mr Ferrier	130	' The men bowed — Petrovitch with easy courtesy , and Ferrier with a frigid reserve which would only allow him to raise his hat about an eighth of an inch — and as they did so the train steamed in . '
87721	87725	87714	87714	You	2357	' said Petrovitch ; '

87859	87893	87857	87857	sir	318	' said the guard , slamming the door with one hand and putting his whistle to his lips with the other , as the train gave a lurch and began to move off . '
87900	87945	87897	87898	Mrs Litvinoff	180	' said Petrovitch , bringing a startled look and a vivid blush into Alice 's face , and giving Richard the biggest surprise of his life . His blank astonishment was too evident for Petrovitch to ignore it . He looked at Richard inquiringly . '
87955	87967	87950	87950	I	0	' stammered Ferrier , as soon as he could find words . '
87978	87979	87968	87968	You	318	' '
87985	88002	87983	87983	sir	318	' answered the other , with a rather angry flash of his deep - set eyes . '

88024	88042	88012	88012	you	318	' said Richard , very slowly . He sat down on the wooden seat without another word . '
88052	88091	88050	88050	sir	318	' said Petrovitch , making for the incline which leads off the platform . Before he had made three paces young Ferrier had pulled himself together , and had overtaken him and laid a hand on his arm . '

88151	88285	88142	88142	I	0	' answered the Russian , less stiffly . No more was said till they got outside the station . It was not easy for Richard to know how to begin . He did not know how much this man knew of Alice , and he felt it would be unfair to tell her story , as far as he knew it , to one who seemed to know her only as a married woman . But , on the other hand , how much did he himself know of her story ? He walked along beside Petrovitch for at least ten minutes before he could make up his mind how to begin . At length the other half - stopped and looked at him in a way that compelled speech of some kind . '
88374	88375	88376	88376	You	2376	' '
88388	88392	88376	88376	You	2376	' said Petrovitch . '
88395	88431	88376	88376	You	2376	' said Richard , finding it desperately hard to break through his English reserve , and yet feeling that he could not in common fairness expect to get any information from one who called himself a '
88433	88447	88469	88469	they	466	' of Alice 's without showing good reasons for asking for such information . '
88481	88504	88505	88507	that young woman	1316	' he said , stopping , and finding his powers of diplomacy absolutely failing him , falling back on the naked truth , '
88556	88557	88553	88554	Roland Ferrier	107	' '
88568	88576	88553	88554	Roland Ferrier	107	' said Petrovitch , speaking very deliberately , '

88600	88604	88586	88586	her	1316	' said Richard , '

88652	88675	88638	88638	It	2388	' Richard had just said that he felt greatly relieved . If that statement was true , his looks certainly belied him . '

88992	89064	89066	89066	he	2397	' Petrovitch bowed ; young Ferrier did the same , and they parted — Petrovitch turned across the bridge , while Richard retraced his steps towards the station . He made his way to the telegraph office , and sent off this message:—'Richard Ferrier , Guy 's Hospital , London , to Gates , The Hollies , Firth Vale.—Please wire me my brother 's address at once if you know it . '
89624	89701	89703	89703	he	130	' answering telegram came it was a wet blanket on Richard 's longing to make his confession and talk things over with Roland — for it ran thus:—'Robert Gates , The Hollies , Firth Vale , to Richard Ferrier , Guy 's Hospital.—Don't know his address — he is expected here in a few days . Has left Chelsea , and is making visits on his way here . Glad you want him . Letter follows . '

90288	90397	90399	90399	you	2427	' It seemed that when her husband had met her at Dartford Station , she , pleased with having met Richard , had told him of the rencontre . That he had closely questioned her , and when at last he had learned every word that had passed between them , he had turned suddenly on her , and told her that this was the first time he had ever even thought of such a thing being possible as that Roland had been the cause of Alice 's ruin , and that now he did know he would not lose a day in facing him with the accusation .

90495	90501	90503	90503	Richard	130	' This is devilish pleasant ! '
90521	90569	90518	90518	he	130	' It appeared he had started off with but a pound , or little more , in his pocket , intending to walk the greater part of the way , and only telling her that she would n't hear of him until she saw him back again . '
90582	90586	90573	90573	you	2432	' he asked . '
90594	90606	90573	90573	you	2432	' she said , wringing her hands and beginning to weep . '

90665	90679	90649	90649	I	0	' She caught hold of his hand , and began to thank him . '
90687	90691	90649	90649	I	0	' he said ; '
90801	91255	91773	91773	I	0	' He caught the three o'clock train to Firth Vale , having managed , by a very hurried farewell , to escape the torrent of questions Mrs Hatfield would have liked to pour out . He felt that , all things considered , the less he said about the matter the better . He had been wrong too often , and too much . THERE was rejoicing in the house of Robert Gates , as over a prodigal returned , when Richard Ferrier avowed that he had been mistaken all through in his quarrel with his brother , and that he was now only anxious to acknowledge his error , and to do his best to set things going again on the old footing . But he had some days to wait before he could make his confession . Thornsett Edge had remained unoccupied , for there was some difficulty in letting a furnished house near a deserted village . People did not seem to care about the vicinity of all those empty shells of homes . So Roland had decided to occupy it again , and he was coming down there to get things ready for his aunt 's reception , and was making a few visits to old friends on his way . He had written down to the old couple in charge to have the place ready , as he might come down any day . Two days passed and he had not come , and Richard was getting tired of the constant inquiries and congratulations which assailed him at The Hollies . He thought he would go home , and be there to welcome Roland when he arrived . So he sent over his portmanteau , and took up his quarters in his old room at Thornsett Edge . He was in a very tender and remorseful frame of mind in those days . He wandered all over the old house , full filled of memories of the time when he and his brother played together there as children ; of the time when , later , they thrashed each other as schoolboys , with right good will . There were haunting thoughts of the dissension that had grown up between them , and of the shadow that the knowledge of it had cast upon their father 's deathbed . The necessity which he felt himself to be under of keeping a sharp look - out for John Hatfield , fortunately served as a kind of antidote to the rush of memories and associations which came over Richard , now that he was once again in his home . He walked down to the village to seek out the few '
91257	91329	91773	91773	I	0	' who had clung like rooks to their old haunts , and there he saw sad sights and heard sad stories enough to have driven him mad had he not known that it would soon be in his power to set things in some degree right again . He resolved , and felt sure of Roland 's co - operation in his scheme , to seek out as many of the old '
91331	91746	91773	91773	I	0	' as could be got word of , and to give each of them enough to get a home together again . Of course he thought often of Miss Stanley ; but the past months of unusual action and changed surroundings had altered his feeling for her , which was fortunate for him , since he had falsely accused his own brother to her — a meanness which he knew it to be quite impossible for such a woman as Clare ever to forget or forgive . He thought of her now without any of the old passion , as he might have thought of one who had died long before , or of one whom he had loved in some other life . This did not prevent him from feeling furiously jealous of Litvinoff , to whom he seemed to have transferred all the anger that had burned in him against his brother , intensified by a galling consciousness of the complete success which Litvinoff had achieved in his attempt to deceive and mislead him . There should be a reckoning for that , Richard thought . He felt glad he had always mistrusted the man . It showed that his judgment was worth something sometimes , and this pleased his self - love . On the third day came a telegram from Matlock , which said that Roland would be at home that evening . Richard roamed about the house in restless impatience all day . How should they meet ? He should not dare to go to the door to greet his brother lest he should imagine that it was a renewal of hostilities , not a welcome home , that was intended . Richard had no eye for dramatic effects , nor any leaning thereto , but he charged the old people to say nothing of his presence , and to leave him to announce himself to his brother when he should think well . His brother would have done exactly the same thing from absolutely opposite motives . So when Roland walked up to his home in the teeth of the wild March wind the only welcome that met him was that of the old woman in charge , and this seemed to him to be so inconsequently effusive , and the good lady herself seemed so unreasonably radiant , that he was quite flattered . It was pleasant to him to be appreciated and admired , even by a '

91757	91766	91767	91767	she	2437	' the dining - room , Mr Roland , '

91802	92126	92127	92127	I	0	' Mrs Brock 's son had worked in the mill — a fact which made the anticipated reconciliation peculiarly interesting to her . Richard from his ambush in his own room heard the greeting , heard the well - known voice giving orders about rugs and hat - boxes in the well - known tones . Then he heard doors open and close . After a while a savoury smell from the hot supper that was being carried in rose to his altitude . The dining - room door was opened , and shut several times . At last it was closed with a more decided touch , and in the noise of its closing was a settled sound as of a door that did not mean to open again just yet . Richard knew that the supper had been cleared away , and that Roland was most likely assisting digestion with tobacco and grog . This would be the time , he decided , to put in an appearance and to get through his proposed reconciliation . He went softly downstairs , and paused a moment with his hand on the dining - room door . The house was very still . As he stood there he heard a cinder fall from the fire in the dining - room , and the great hall clock at the foot of the stairs ticked louder than usual , as it seemed . He turned the handle and went in . Roland was sitting in the big arm - chair by the fire where their father had been used to sit . As the door opened he looked up with a sort of displeased curiosity to see who it was that had the assurance to enter unannounced . When he saw who it was he gave a start , and the expression of his face changed to something deeper and sterner . He got up . '
92132	92136	92130	92130	Gates	266	' he said , '
92177	92178	92167	92167	I	0	' '
92186	92205	92179	92179	I	0	' began Richard , his hand still on the lock — when his brother interrupted him with , — '
92232	92260	92216	92216	you	266	' His tone was so icily cold that the other found it hard to go on as he had intended . He did his best , however . '
92302	92345	92295	92295	you	266	' He held out his hand . At this point in the scene Dick had fancied that his brother would clasp his hand with reciprocating affection , and all would be forgiven and forgotten . But the other actor evidently intended a different '
92347	92385	92293	92293	I	0	' of the part assigned him . He made no movement to meet the outstretched hand . On the contrary , he put his hands in his pockets with a too expressive gesture , and was silent . '
92390	92412	92293	92293	I	0	' said Dick , who , knowing himself to have been in the wrong , displayed a patience which surprised himself ; '

92427	92433	92293	92293	I	0	' said the other slowly , '
92484	92509	92483	92483	I	0	'm not inclined to lay myself open to any more experiences of this kind . You might be " deceived and misled " again . '
92532	92539	92540	92540	he	130	' And as for the money , '
92544	92559	92540	92540	he	130	' I dare say I can do as well without it as with it . '

92638	92672	92635	92635	his	107	' but this appeal was not lost . He made an effort to overcome the resentment and bitterness that filled him , and after a moment held out his hand , saying , — '
92698	92764	92765	92765	I	0	' And this was the reconciliation that Richard had had his heart full of for the last three or four days . It was piteously unlike his dreams of it . When they had shaken hands , Dick sat down . There was a silence — a very awkward silence . Roland passed the whisky along the table , and the other mechanically helped himself . '

97446	97448	97437	97437	Roland	107	' I 'm

97469	98210	97467	97467	Clare	139	' He murmured her name over and over again , more and more faintly . Roland put the water to his lips again , but it was too late . He had drunk of the Nepenthe of Death . THE Clare Stanley who studied Bakounin and quoted Matthew Arnold was a very different girl from the Clare Stanley who had in the autumn entertained the reprehensible idea of bringing to her feet the interesting stranger at Morley 's Hotel . In looking back on that time , which she did with hot cheeks and uncomfortable self - condemnation , it really seemed to her that she had changed into another being — development , when it is rapid , being always bewildering . It would be interesting to know with what emotions the rose remembers being a green bud . Pleasanter ones perhaps than those of the woman whose new earnest sense of the intense seriousness of life leads her to look back — not with indulgent eyes — on the follies of her unawakened girlhood . The story of the sleeping beauty is an allegory with a very real meaning . Every woman 's mind has its time of slumber , when the creed of the day is truth and the convention of the day is morality . The fairy prince 's awakening kiss may come in the pages of a book , in the words of a speaker , through love , through suffering , through sorrow , through a thousand things glad or sad , and to some it never comes , and that is the saddest thing of all . Clare had slept , and now was well awake , and it was no word of Count Litvinoff 's that had broken the slumbrous spell . Sometimes she almost wished it had been , for she could not conceal from herself the fact that she had succeeded in doing what she had desired to do , and that Count Litvinoff was at her feet . The position became him , certainly , but she felt a perverse objection to being placed on a pedestal , and a new conviction that she would rather look up to a lover than down at one . And yet why should she look down on him ? He was cleverer than she , with a larger knowledge of life — had done incomparably more for the cause she had espoused . He was brave , handsome , and , to some extent , a martyr , and he loved her , or she thought so , which came to the same thing . Verily , a man with all these qualifications was hardly the sort of lover for a girl under the twenties to look down upon . But could she help looking down on him , for was he not at her feet ? And that was not the place , she thought , for a man who had drawn the sword in such a war as she and he had entered upon . What right had a man who had taken up arms in that cause to lay them down , even at her feet ? No , no . Her lover , if she had one , must be at her side — not there . This reaction to the Count 's detriment had set in on New Year 's Day , when he had told her that he held no cause sacred enough to give her even inconvenience for the sake of it , and the tide was still ebbing . Litvinoff appeared quite unconscious of that fact though , for he continued to call on Mrs Quaid with a persistence which quite justified all Cora 's animadversions . Miss Quaid 's penetration was at fault , but the Count 's was not . He was perfectly conscious of the change in her state of mind , and knew that his chance of being master of the Stanley money - bags was far less than he had thought shortly after their late master 's death . Suspense was the one thing Count Litvinoff could not bear — at least , he could bear it when the balance of probabilities was in his favour ; but when the chances did not seem to be on his side — no . He knew perfectly well that it is hardly '
98212	98236	97451	97452	old man	2443	' to ask a girl to marry one three months after her father 's death ; but he was not an enthusiastic devotee of '
98239	98300	98301	98301	He	2598	' He habitually posed as a despiser of conventions , and this attitude very often stood him in good stead , even with people who preferred the stereotyped rôles of life for themselves . Avowed unconventionality serves as a splendid excuse for doing all sorts of pleasant things which conventional people dare n't do ; hence perhaps its growing popularity . '
98331	98376	98301	98301	He	2598	' The lines ran in Count Litvinoff 's head persistently one spring morning while he sat at his late breakfast . As he despatched his last mouthful of grilled sardine and looked round for the marmalade , the servant came in with a letter . '
98395	98405	98386	98386	I	0	' he said to himself as he took it . '
98416	98433	98434	98434	I	0	' He tore it open . It was not a bill . It ran thus : — '

When I do swallow my principles they go down whole , like oysters ; and if Miss Stanley does n't care to add the title of " countess " to her other endowments , some one will be glad to take that and me , even with nothing a year to keep state upon . '
98763	98766	98767	98767	he	0	' Yes , '
98774	98840	98841	98841	he	0	' I 'll have a shot for it now , as I 've gone so far , and I 'll shoot as straight and as steady as I can . As for the other matter — well , Aspinshaw and the fruits thereof would not be a bad drug for inconvenient memories . I wonder if this is one of my good - looking days ? '

99084	99108	99070	99070	he	0	' but when the servant told me you were alone in the library , I could not resist the temptation of coming in . '
99109	99119	99120	99120	she	122	' I do n't at all mind being interrupted , '
99151	99174	99139	99149	a man who , having come in , meant to stay	2610	' I was just looking through two of your books . One of them , indeed , I almost know by heart . '
99175	99189	99139	99149	a man who , having come in , meant to stay	2610	' And that is?'—carelessly , as one who is sure of the answer — '
99196	99214	99139	99149	a man who , having come in , meant to stay	2610	' Somehow Count Litvinoff did not look delighted . Perhaps he wanted to talk about something else . '
99219	99224	99139	99149	a man who , having come in , meant to stay	2610	' she went on , '

99257	99282	99248	99248	I	0	' Then , as a faint change in her face showed him that he had made a false move , he hastened to add , '

99330	99334	99480	99480	You	2614	' she said . '
99362	99479	99480	99480	You	2614	' Then she looked at him , at his handsome , insouciant face , at the half - cynical droop of his mouth , at the look in his eyes — the sort of look an old cardinal who knew the Church and the world might turn on an enthusiastic young monk — and she felt a sudden regret for that heart - warm speech of hers . What had she in common with this perfectly - dressed , orchid - button - holed young man ? Why should she expect him to understand her ? And yet had he not written " The Prophetic Vision " ? She went on , smiling a little , — '
99519	99520	99512	99512	I	0	' '
99531	99532	99533	99533	They	2616	' '

99595	99610	99592	99592	you	2614	' he said , in a very low voice , and went on hurriedly : '

99829	99838	99841	99842	a worker	2628	' she asked , not looking at him . '
99849	99859	99846	99847	a martyr	4380	' he answered , rising and standing near her ; '

99884	99893	99879	99879	I	0	' she was beginning when he interrupted her . '
99899	99903	99879	99879	I	0	' he said . '
100034	100098	100099	100099	You	2614	' His voice was low with the passion which for the moment thrilling through him made him quite believe his own words . Clare had listened silently , her eyes cast down , and her nervous fingers diligently tearing an envelope into little bits , and when he had ended she still did not speak , but her breath came and went quickly . '
100101	100117	100099	100099	You	2614	' he was beginning again , when she stretched out her hand to silence him . '
100122	100126	100099	100099	You	2614	' she said ; '
100139	100140	100133	100133	I	0	' '
100148	100149	100145	100145	you	0	' '

100205	100214	100188	100188	I	0	' she said , with very real distress . '
100226	100227	100228	100228	You	0	' '
100236	100251	100228	100228	You	0	' he asked , as earnestly as though his happiness hung on her answer . '
100254	100259	100228	100228	You	0	' she said steadily , '
100273	100274	100266	100266	I	0	' '
100283	100287	100266	100266	I	0	' he said . '
100327	100340	100323	100323	I	0	' It was true — but Clare hated him for saying it . '
100349	100525	100341	100341	I	0	' she said slowly . Several things both bitter and true rose to his lips . He did not give them voice , however . He had never in his life said an unkind thing to a woman . It occurred to him that he was accepting his defeat rather easily , and he looked at her to measure the chances for and against the possible success of another appeal . But in her face was a decision against which he knew there could be no appeal . He felt angry with her for refusing him — angry and unreasonably surprised ; and then , in one of the flashes of light that made it so hard for him to understand himself , he saw that if she was to blame for refusing his love , he was ten thousand times more to blame for having sought hers , and this truth brought others with it . His real feeling , he knew , was not anger but relief . He made a step forward . '
100530	100534	100526	100526	You	2631	' he said . '
100578	100579	100580	100581	A traitor	2632	' '
100587	100596	100580	100581	A traitor	2632	' she said , holding out her hand . '
100599	100603	100580	100581	A traitor	2632	' he said , '
100630	100689	100580	100581	A traitor	2632	' And the door shut behind him , and Clare was left standing in the middle of the room with her eyes widely opened , and her hand still outstretched . She stood there till she heard the front door closed , and then sank into a chair . She did n't want to go on making notes about '
100693	101341	101342	101342	I	0	' any more . The interview had not been a pleasant one , and it was not pleasant to think over . One of the least pleasant things in this world is a granted wish , granted after it has ceased to be wished . And Clare could not forget that she had desired to win this man 's admiration , at least . She could not forget that he had saved her father 's life — that he had been the first to speak to her of many things once unknown or unconsidered , but now a part of her very life — and she could not forget that when she had first thought of the possibility of his asking her to marry him she had not meant to refuse him . There had been much about him to attract her , and if she had never met Petrovitch she might have given Litvinoff , even now , a different answer . But in Petrovitch she found all the qualities that had fascinated her in Litvinoff , and all on a larger scale , and with a finer development . Litvinoff now seemed to her like a dissolving view of Petrovitch seen through the wrong end of a telescope . He lacked the definiteness of outline , the depth of tone , the intense reality of the other man . Perhaps he seemed more brilliant and dashing ; but Hirsch 's story had shown what Petrovitch was . Added to all this was one significant fact . She had admired in Litvinoff one quality or another , and had desired to attract him . To Petrovitch she herself had been attracted , not by any specific quality or qualities , but by himself — by the man as he was — and this attraction grew stronger with each meeting . A fortnight had now passed since the second time she had seen him , and somehow or other she had seen him very often in that time . She knew well enough that neither Litvinoff nor Petrovitch had come to Marlborough Villa to see its mistress . And she had been sufficiently certain about the Count 's motives for his visit , but could she be certain about the motive which brought the elder man there so constantly ? Of any effort to make him care for her she was not guilty . In her new frame of mind she would have felt any such attempt to be degrading , alike to herself and to him . And though she knew he came to see her , she could not be sure why he came . Was his evident interest in her only the interest of an apostle in a convert ? A certain humility had sprung up in her , along with many other flowers of the heart , and she did not admit to herself that there was a chance of his interest being of another nature . Only , she thought , it would be the highest honour in the world and the deepest happiness to be the woman whom he loved . Not the less because she knew well enough that the woman he loved would hold the second place in his heart , and that he would not wish to hold the first place in hers . That , for both of them , must be filled by the goddess whom Litvinoff had once said he worshipped , and whom he had abjured and abandoned for her sake . She thought of this without a single thrill of gratified pride . Miss Stanley sat silent for half an hour , and in that time got through more thinking than we could record if we wrote steadily for half a year . At the end of that time Miss Quaid came home . '
101350	101360	101344	101345	Count Litvinoff	121	' she said , when she entered the study . '
101378	101379	101371	101373	a Countess Litvinoff	238	' '
101382	101402	101371	101373	a Countess Litvinoff	238	' said Clare , rising and shaking off her reverie ; I shall never be anything to Count Litvinoff . '
101633	101636	101647	101647	Litvinoff	121	' natural man '
101710	101720	101721	101721	he	121	' I am not consistent enough for a villain , '
101726	101887	101721	101721	he	121	' I have failed in that part , and now I will go in for my natural rôle of a fool , and I 've a sort of idea that I shall get on better . And the first thing to be done is to find my little one . Fool as I am , I 've generally been able to do anything I 've really set my mind on . The reason I 've failed in my " deep - laid schemes " has been that I did n't always care whether I won or not . I can be in the same mind about this matter , however , for a long enough time to achieve what I want . As for principles , they bore me . If it had n't been for my principles I should n't have got into half this trouble . What shall I do with myself till my mysterious friend turns up ? '
101968	101973	101974	101974	he	2649	' A fourpenny luncheon , '
101979	101990	101974	101974	he	2649	' is the first step in the path of virtue . '
102110	102113	102114	102114	he	2649	' Alas ! '
102119	102150	102114	102114	he	2649	' how sadly simple and easy it is to sign one 's name on this nice smooth coloured paper . I suppose it 's best to check these off — bankers '
102157	102218	102114	102114	he	2649	' A most unfounded statement , born of ignorance of business , and a desire to seem to himself as one who understood it . Suddenly he started , and singled out the cheque he had given to Hirsch in the autumn . It bore on it , as endorsement , in a bold , free handwriting , the name , '
102222	102223	102114	102114	he	2649	' '
102226	102230	102231	102234	a namesake of mine	2657	' he said ; '
102252	102276	102240	102244	This apostle of our cause	2658	' He walked to the mantelpiece , and taking thence the letter he had received in the morning , he compared the writing . '
102284	102293	102240	102244	This apostle of our cause	2658	' he said , returning to his seat . '
102333	102373	102321	102321	We	2659	' He went on steadily with his self - imposed task of comparing each cheque with the entry in the book . He had half done them when a ring at the front door bell made him look up . '
102382	102494	102378	102378	Petrovitch	179	' he said to himself . It was Petrovitch , though perhaps those who had seen most of him in the last few months would have failed to recognise him . He looked at least ten years younger . The handsome long light beard was gone , and he was close shaved save for a heavy drooping blond moustache . As Count Litvinoff heard his visitor 's steps upon the stairs he settled himself back in his chair , with an assumption of a business air , much like that of a very young lawyer about to receive a new client . There was a sharp rap at the room door . '
102498	102584	102378	102378	Petrovitch	179	' he said . The door opened . He sprang to his feet , stood one moment clutching at the table before him , his eyes wide with something that seemed almost terror , and his whole frame rigid with astonishment . Then his expression changed to one of deepest love and delight . There was a crash of furniture , as he flung the little writing - table from him , and it fell shattered against the opposite wall . With a hysterical cry of '
102598	102690	102692	102694	a fellow it	2662	' he sprang across the room , threw his arms round the other 's neck , and fell sobbing on his breast . BEFORE the echo of that cry had died away , the man who had uttered it swayed sideways , his face grew deadly white , the clasp of his arms loosened , and only the sudden firm grip of the other saved him from falling . Petrovitch laid him on the sofa . Then he passed into the adjoining bedroom , and came back with a wet sponge . '
102697	102717	102692	102694	a fellow it	2662	' he said to himself , as he applied it to the hands and face of the insensible man . '
102731	102775	102776	102776	Litvinoff	121	' But he looked very kindly on the pale face as he administered his remedies . In a little while the eyes opened , and the younger man struggled into a sitting position , and looked into the face that bent over him . '
102784	102827	102780	102780	you	121	' he said in a low voice , and covered his face with his hands . The joy of seeing once more the man he had loved seemed to be swallowed up in the shame of meeting the man he had wronged . '
102836	102840	102834	102834	I	0	' said Petrovitch ; '
102896	102897	102900	102900	you	0	' '

102941	102945	102932	102932	you	179	' he groaned . '
102993	102994	102978	102978	I	0	' '
103006	103015	102997	102997	you	179	' said Petrovitch , looking at him curiously . '

103085	103096	103076	103076	You	179	' with a sudden , quick doubt in his voice . '

103109	103115	103076	103076	You	179	' he went on eagerly , '
103162	103167	103153	103153	I	0	' he ended bitterly . '
103174	103207	103168	103168	I	0	' Petrovitch answered ; and with a sudden thrill of pity for the despair , the remorse , the longing , and the wretchedness in the other 's face , he added , '
103251	103349	103232	103232	You	179	' Petrovitch knew well enough that when the heart 's cords are stretched almost unbearably by the strain of an intense emotion , it sometimes stems as though they could only be saved from giving way altogether by the direction of the mind to some utterly trivial detail of everyday life . Many a woman 's heart has been saved from breaking by the necessity of getting the children 's dinner , and many a tragedy has been averted by the chief actor 's having to take in the afternoon 's milk . Petrovitch repeated the question , '
103357	103444	103232	103232	You	179	' The other rose mechanically , went to a cupboard , and brought out a plated kettle and spirit - lamp , a small china tea set , and a plate of lemons , with a silver knife . He put these appliances on the table in an unmethodical , untidy sort of way , and was proceeding to light the spirit - lamp , when Petrovitch , who had been watching him with a smile , took the match - box out of his hand . '
103462	103503	103454	103454	you	179	' He lighted the lamp , and with a few deft touches put the rest of the tea - things in order , as the other , leaving the matter in his hands , strode up and down the room . '
103516	103522	103452	103452	I	0	' he said at length ; '
103534	103535	103452	103452	I	0	' '
103567	103647	103798	103799	The other	305	'm there you may guess it wo n't matter to me who bears my name . I shall not wish to use it . But while I am here I wish to be Petrovitch . Indeed , you can serve me best by letting it be as widely known as possible that Count Litvinoff is — well , where you are and not where I am , and after all it 's nobody 's business but yours and mine . '
103648	103659	103798	103799	The other	305	' Does no one else know of it at all ? '
103660	103673	103798	103799	The other	305	' Only two men in St Petersburg , and one in London . '
103674	103679	103798	103799	The other	305	' And he is ? '
103680	103691	103798	103799	The other	305	' Hirsch , whom you 've seen , I think . '
103692	103704	103798	103799	The other	305	' Why the devil did n't he tell every one then ? '
103705	103725	103798	103799	The other	305	' Because I asked him not to , and he considers himself under some sort of obligation to me . '
103726	103742	103798	103799	The other	305	' Like everyone else you come across . But how came he to know it ? '
103743	103797	103798	103799	The other	305	' He had to be told when I came here . There was certain work I had to do ; I can tell you about it another time , and he was the only man who could put me in the way of it . Now Count Litvinoff , the tea is ready . '
103805	103809	103810	103810	he	305	' Curse it ! '
103814	103852	103810	103810	he	305	' Call me a villain or a forger , or any other pretty name you like ; I can stand that , but not your lips calling me by your name . It 's a cruel revenge . '
103853	103903	103798	103799	The other	305	' Ah , we owe too much to our enemies for there to be any thought of revenge between friends , and I must teach myself to call you that . Besides , what is there to revenge ? You have only used the name I did not need . '
103904	103923	103798	103799	The other	305	' No , I forged your name as well as stole it . You do n't know all . '
103924	104003	103798	103799	The other	305	' Yes , I do , or pretty nearly all . As far as your taking my name goes , that has done no harm ; rather good ; and as for the money , that would have gone to you . You know , if I had had the giving of it , it would have gone to you . And I know you would never have touched it if you had not thought I was dead . '
104004	104035	103798	103799	The other	305	' I wish I had never left you , though I did think it , and at the mercy of those curs . If only I had died by you ! '
104036	104065	103798	103799	The other	305	' You know well enough our rule is that none should be sacrificed without reason . Why should you have given those hounds two lives instead of one ? '
104066	104111	103798	103799	The other	305	' I wish I had died that night under the orange trees at Monte Carlo . You did yourself a bad turn when you saved my life . I have done no good with it . I have only weighted myself with unpardonable sins . '
104112	104120	104121	104121	Petrovitch	179	' As far as I am concerned , '
104124	104186	104187	104187	He	179	' if there is anything to forgive , it is freely forgiven — freely and fully ; and now let us shake hands after your English fashion , and of forgiveness let us talk no more . We are friends , and between such it is no question of pardon . And there are many other things we must speak of . '
104210	104223	104225	104225	Petrovitch	179	' Let me give you some fresh tea — that is cold , '
104233	104249	104225	104225	Petrovitch	179	' do n't you want to hear what happened to me after I was killed ? '
104250	104262	103798	103799	The other	305	' I can hardly realise yet that you are not killed . '
104263	104421	104442	104442	he	2671	' Well , I 'll tell you about it . The officer of that troop added medicine to his other accomplishments , besides which he was a distant relation of my mother 's , and he insisted on seeing whether I could not be conjured back to life . I believe I gave them a good deal of trouble , but I seem to be a die - hard . My capture was kept very quiet , thanks to my family name , for the Government did n't care about having it known that the head of the Litvinoffs had tried to atone for the crimes of his family by taking the side of the people . My wound was a bad one , and even now troubles me sometimes . I used sometimes almost to wish it had settled me . Fancy being in prison , and a Russian prison , with a wound like that . '
104422	104430	104432	104433	answer Petrovitch	179	' But how did you get away ? '
104485	104489	104490	104490	he	2671	' And now , '
104498	104508	104490	104490	he	2671	' tell me how it fared with the Secretary . '
104509	104517	104519	104529	the man who had borne the Litvinoff name for three years	2675	' I hate to think of it , '
104546	104582	104588	104588	he	2671	' Whenever I think of that night , I see nothing but your face — dead , as I thought — turned up from the snow in the hateful dawn . Oh , my friend ! '
104604	104938	104601	104601	he	2671	' I tried all I knew to revive you , but you were as cold as ice , and your heart did not beat . I stayed by you a long , long time . It did not occur to me to leave you , but at last , in a flash , I realised that you were gone — that I was there in the snow alone . And then I thought of escape . I said good - bye to your body . I felt as if your self was far away somewhere , and then I sprang up and dashed off in the direction we had been taking . It was broad daylight then , but I saw nothing of the soldiers , though I knew afterwards they must have found you , because when we sent , your body was gone . I must have kept pretty straight , for I came to a house at last , and I went straight up to it . I thought it must be Teliaboff 's , and if it was n't I felt I did n't much care . I went right in , asked for the master of the house , and when he came to me I told him all . It was Teliaboff . He was very good to me , and kept me there nearly a fortnight . We could hear nothing of you — nothing at all . By the way , it was he who first , unconsciously , gave me the idea of personating you , for when I entered his house on that horrible morning he greeted me by your name . I undeceived him at once , but the idea took root and bore fruit later . He was kindness itself , and his little daughter — she was only twelve , I think — took a fancy to me . I believe that child 's companionship saved me from going mad . '
105299	105300	105291	105291	you	2678	' '
105306	105311	105303	105303	you	2678	' Petrovitch asked gravely . '
105321	105322	105291	105291	you	2678	' '
105325	105331	105291	105291	you	2678	' was the brief reply . '
105334	105335	105339	105339	his	277	' '
105357	105358	105349	105349	I	0	' '
105365	105369	105349	105349	I	0	' gasped Litvinoff . '
105383	105384	105385	105385	My	0	' '
105388	105395	105385	105385	My	0	' cried Litvinoff , springing up . '
105436	105437	105438	105438	We	466	' '
105443	105448	105438	105438	We	466	' Petrovitch said quietly . '
105511	105535	105556	105556	you	2688	' The two men sat silent for a little while , but Litvinoff 's eyes still blazed with excitement . Petrovitch smoked quietly . '
105540	105554	105556	105556	you	2688	' Litvinoff asked presently , turning from the other subject with evident effort , '
105567	105568	105556	105556	you	2688	' '
105581	105609	105569	105569	I	0	' answered Petrovitch , who did not choose to tell his friend that he had waited to see with what grace the Prophet 's Mantle was worn . '
105647	105648	105645	105645	Litvinoff	121	' '
105659	105680	105652	105652	you	2688	' was the very natural question . Petrovitch hesitated , but only for a moment . Then he said , — '
105712	105713	105706	105706	I	0	' '
105719	105720	105706	105706	I	0	' '
105735	105754	105706	105706	I	0	' Petrovitch spoke slowly and distinctly . Litvinoff leaned forward in his chair and looked at him amazedly . '
105758	105770	105706	105706	I	0	' he said , leaning back with a sort of sigh , '
105777	105778	105771	105771	you	2688	' '
105788	105789	105779	105779	I	0	' '
105799	105806	105779	105779	I	0	' Litvinoff added , correcting himself , '
105813	105820	105821	105821	I	0	' Petrovitch 's eyes flashed angrily . '
105884	105885	105886	105886	You	2688	' '
105901	105923	105895	105895	I	0	' he said , walking over to the bookcase , and standing so that his face was not to be seen . '
106000	106042	105999	105999	I	0	'm thankful to say , and I mean to find my wife'—there was no hesitation in his voice this time—'and legalise her position with bell , book , and candle , and any other rites that may seem to her desirable . '
106043	106048	106050	106050	Petrovitch	179	' Regardless of principles ? '
106058	106062	106050	106050	Petrovitch	179	' Damn principles ! '
106074	106099	106050	106050	Petrovitch	179	' I would have sacrificed them for a woman I merely admired , and they sha'n't stand between me and the woman I love . '
106100	106109	106050	106050	Petrovitch	179	' How do you propose to find her ? '
106110	106125	106126	106126	he	121	' I have n't the slightest idea . Do you know where she is ? '
106130	106146	106126	106126	he	121	' Do you remember giving £ 10 to a man named Hirsch in the autumn ? '
106153	106157	106126	106126	he	121	' I do ? '
106163	106170	106171	106171	Litvinoff	121	' That was for your wife ! '
106177	106181	106182	106182	he	121	' Go on ! '
106211	106243	106204	106204	Petrovitch	179	' Bridge , he leaned forward breathing heavily , then rose suddenly , and , crossing to a couch , flung himself , face downwards , on it . Petrovitch paused . '
106253	106297	106204	106204	Petrovitch	179	' said an impatient , stifled voice from the couch . So Petrovitch resumed . When the tale was told , Litvinoff rose . He was very pale , his lips trembled a little , and his dark eyes were shining and wet . '
106389	106400	106378	106378	I	0	' Petrovitch rose and laid his hand on his shoulder . '
106408	106412	106413	106413	She	2698	' he said . '
106468	106469	106472	106472	you	179	' '
106480	106513	106514	106514	You	179	' Litvinoff answered , frowning and a little stiffly , and then was silent a moment . Then he said suddenly , flinging himself into his chair with the frown quite gone , '
106515	106655	106472	106472	you	179	're right — you always are , and there is much to be said . I wish to God there could be some way of wiping out the past , or rather of atoning for it . Do you know , it seems to me that I shall have a chance of seeing my way to doing something worth doing now you have come back . I could almost swear at this moment that I believed as heartily as ever in liberty , humanity , progress , and all the other things you taught me to swear by , but in my soul I know it is you I believe in — always have believed in — I 've never believed in anything but you for more than three months at a time . Peculiar , is n't it ? '
106656	106665	106667	106667	Petrovitch	179	' You have n't altered in the least , '
106670	106755	106667	106667	Petrovitch	179	' You were never sure of your beliefs except when you were fighting for them . You should be back in Russia . Persecution is a splendid antidote to religious doubt . Men like you ought not to live in England . There is too much freedom in the air and it does n't agree with you . You get to think there is nothing worth fighting for here . There is , though , and some Englishmen are beginning to find it out . '
106756	106764	106765	106765	Litvinoff	121	' You are going back to Russia ? '
106770	106773	106765	106765	Litvinoff	121	' Yes . '
106774	106781	106782	106782	he	121	' Let me come with you , '
106787	106794	106782	106782	he	121	' Give your Secretary another chance . '
106795	106834	106765	106765	Litvinoff	121	' Ah , my days of quiet writing are over now . The battle grows hot . I do n't want a Secretary , I want a comrade in arms . Will you go to Servia for me ? '
106835	106846	106667	106667	Petrovitch	179	' I 'll go to hell , if you like , '
106852	106873	106667	106667	Petrovitch	179	' The two will soon be synonymous , if all I hear is correct . But what about your wife ? '
106874	106884	106885	106885	Litvinoff	121	' It used to be one of your principles , '
106898	106944	106885	106885	Litvinoff	121	' that if a man believes in anything enough to place himself in danger for it , he should not hesitate to risk all he holds precious for the same end ; and my wife is not a coward , she would go with me . '
106945	106950	106952	106952	Petrovitch	179	' Poor little woman , '
106954	107014	106952	106952	Petrovitch	179	' but that was and is one of my principles . If you go to Servia under my name I shall have a far better chance of getting back to St Petersburg under someone else 's . And the risk to your wife is of the slightest , for it is a peaceful errand I will send you on . '
107015	107021	106885	106885	Litvinoff	121	' I hate peaceful errands . '
107022	107085	106885	106885	Litvinoff	121	' I dare say there 'll be a little excitement thrown in — but do n't rush into danger . There is no need there , and it can do no good . I know hard fighting is the easiest ; but our business is to do the thing which has to be done , be it peace or be it war . '
107086	107089	107091	107091	Litvinoff	121	' Ah ! '
107096	107149	107091	107091	Litvinoff	121	' to act up to that ideal is easy enough for men like you , but you must remember that such men as you are as far above the rest of us as the Christian martyrs are above the average church - goer . You are the Saints of the New Religion . '
107150	107164	107166	107166	Petrovitch	179	' Do n't you think we 'd better go and have some dinner ? '
107170	107175	107166	107166	Petrovitch	179	' MY LITTLE GIRL . '
107332	107462	107502	107502	Petrovitch	179	' Count Michael Litvinoff left London for Dover this morning , en route for Belgrade . He was accompanied by Countess Litvinoff , an English lady to whom he was secretly married some time ago . Count Litvinoff , so well known to many of our readers through his " Social Enigma , " his " Hopes and Fears for Liberty , " and his many revolutionary brochures , has never been a familiar figure in London society , his literary labours having compelled him to live in strict retirement . It will be remembered that he was the hero of an adventure on the Russian frontier some years ago , was wounded , captured , and sent to a Russian prison , from which he escaped to England . '
107508	107532	107502	107502	Petrovitch	179	' I 'll see to your debts — and what is gone is gone . Do n't let us waste words over that . '
107633	107648	107649	107649	Petrovitch	179	' We meet in St Petersburg , then , as soon as may be , '
107652	107662	107649	107649	Petrovitch	179	' I shall not see you again till then . '
107663	107694	107704	107705	the other	305	' I hope by that time I shall have done something to prove to you that you have indeed brought me back to the ranks of duty and the Revolution . '
107695	107702	107704	107705	the other	305	' I do n't need proof , '
107876	107883	107884	107884	he	121	' And this is the man , '
107890	107917	107918	107918	he	121	' who walked behind her for half - an - hour last autumn , and never spoke to her ! No , not the same man , '
107925	107935	107918	107918	he	121	' I am purged of a crime since then . '
107975	107979	107980	107980	he	121	' I suppose , '
107985	108045	107980	107980	he	121	' you will be the balm the child will choose to ease her sorrow — and you will bring comfort to her , as you have to thousands of others . I do n't grudge them their comfort , but I do grudge you your influence . However , you wo n't keep it much longer . Tant mieux . '
108157	108163	108144	108144	He	121	' Is Mrs Litvinoff in ? '
108226	108238	108239	108239	he	121	' The air will brighten your wits , mon petit chou , '
108337	108343	108344	108344	she	2724	' Oh , Mrs Litvinoff ? '
108348	108373	108344	108344	she	2724	' she is out ; she has gone to Orpington for some butter for me , sir , and she wo n't be long . '
108374	108378	108449	108450	The woman	3264	' How long ? '
108379	108384	108320	108324	the lady of the house	2733	' Perhaps an hour . '
108385	108390	108344	108344	she	2724	' Is she alone ? '
108391	108396	108449	108450	The woman	3264	' Yes , sir . '
108397	108419	108449	108450	The woman	3264	' If you 'll be kind enough to tell me the way , I think I 'll go and meet her . '
108420	108439	108344	108344	she	2724	' And who shall I say called if you should miss her , and she comes back first ? '
108440	108445	108447	108447	Litvinoff	180	' Say her husband , '
108478	108482	108484	108485	Mrs Bowen	279	' My stars ! '
108495	108511	108512	108512	she	279	' he 's a real gentleman , and no mistake . Poor little Mrs Litvinoff , '
108525	108543	108512	108512	she	279	' I hope they 'll make it up and live happy ever after , that I do ! '

109318	109347	109300	109300	she	134	' It 's no use , I can not come back . You have not come here to ask me back . Do , do leave me alone ! '

109361	109420	109421	109421	he	2882	' do you think I could leave you now I have found you ? I have come to ask you to come back to me . I have come to ask you to marry me . You will not send me away . I can not do without my little one any longer . You love me still ? '
109464	109468	109469	109469	she	2748	' You know , '
109472	109476	109469	109469	she	2748	' you know . '
109634	109656	109622	109622	Wives	2755	' past . As it is , Alice will follow him to the world 's end , believing in him unquestioningly . '
109777	109807	109774	109775	Alice Litvinoff	283	' In the same envelope was a letter from Alice 's husband , and it did not begin in the same way as hers . It ran thus , — '
110044	110072	110041	110042	Armand Percival	276	' In signing that name I feel as though I were writing with my left hand , it is so awkward to me after all these years . '
110907	110916	110917	110917	she	139	' How could I have been so absurd ? '
110920	110935	110917	110917	she	139	' Do you know for the moment I really thought it was Count Litvinoff . '
110936	110979	110885	110885	she	139	' I do n't wonder at your not quite recognising me . You see I had to sacrifice my beard . I am going back to Russia next week . Disguise will be de rigeur , and beards and disguises are incompatible . '
110980	110988	110989	110989	she	139	' Going back to Russia next week ? '
110993	111005	110989	110989	she	139	' and I had so much to say — to ask — '

111031	111129	111023	111023	she	139	' more than ever , for now I have made up my mind . I am quite certain that my money ought to go — not to simply alleviating the miseries that wring one 's heart , but to helping to overthrow the system that causes them . I have felt it a strong temptation to help first the individual sorrows that I know of ; but I know that the right thing to do is to help not those , but the revolution that will render them impossible . I am right , am I not ? '
111130	111133	111134	111134	he	179	' Yes , '
111158	111162	111180	111180	her	139	' talk over . '
111163	111170	111171	111171	she	139	' But now you are going , '
111193	111235	111171	111171	she	139	' and I shall have no one to tell me what to do . Why need you go ? Is there nothing for you to do here ? Is Russia so dear that it pushes all other claims out of sight ? '
111236	111289	111180	111180	her	139	' It is not that I am a patriot . I love Russia , I love my people , but I love England and her people too . But better than either do I love Liberty , and I must be where her enemies are strongest , where the battle is hottest . '
111290	111296	111297	111297	she	2797	' If that is so , '
111307	111322	111297	111297	she	2797	' everyone who loves Liberty best should be in front of the battle too ? '
111323	111335	111336	111336	he	2798	' I think so ; but each must think for himself , '
111369	111408	111409	111409	She	236	' Oh , how do you do , Mr Petrovitch . I did not know you were here . Clare , such a terrible thing has happened , dear ; mamma has just seen it in the paper . '
111421	111428	111409	111409	She	236	' Shocking accident at Firth Vale . '
111457	111566	111567	111567	Clare	139	' The brother of the deceased , Mr Richard Ferrier , states that his brother went out for a stroll on the previous night in his usual spirits . There is no clue to any explanation of the catastrophe , save that the man Hatfield was formerly employed in this mill , and had been heard to say that he considered himself personally aggrieved at the closing of it . He was supposed to be in the south of England , and it is rumoured that he secretly returned to wreak vengeance on the young masters of the mill for the part they had taken in closing it . '
111628	111635	111636	111636	she	139	' Poor fellow ! poor Dick ! '
111639	111698	111636	111636	she	139	' but , oh , Cora ! poor Mrs Hatfield ! How will she bear it ? Oh ! how cruel life is to some people . First her daughter , and now her husband , and she is alone in some strange place , where no one can get to her to help her to bear it ! '
111699	111712	111714	111714	Petrovitch	179	' How could you help her if you knew where she was ? '
111716	111733	111734	111734	she	2800	' I could tell her myself . I have had grief to bear — I know , '
111737	111756	111757	111757	She	2800	' I would save her from hearing it from some careless stranger . I could go to her — '
111783	111794	111796	111796	Petrovitch	179	' I happen to know where this Mrs Hatfield is , '
111800	111822	111796	111796	Petrovitch	179	' and I agree with you , Miss Stanley , that it would be right for you to go to her . '
111844	111850	111851	111851	she	139	' I will go now , '
111854	111864	111851	111851	she	139	' if you will tell me where she is . '
111865	111878	111880	111880	Petrovitch	179	' I will take you to her now , if you like , '
111890	111901	111902	111902	she	236	' We had better speak to mamma , I think , '
111905	111915	111902	111902	she	236	' perhaps we can come with you , Clare . '
111987	111993	111994	111994	she	139	' I am quite ready , '
111997	112032	111994	111994	she	139	' Mrs Quaid and Cora can not come . They have some people coming to lunch , and I am not sorry , for poor Mrs Hatfield ought not to be bothered by strangers . '
112033	112038	112039	112039	he	179	' Come , then , '
112071	112079	112081	112081	Clare	139	' How did you know her address ? '
112088	112095	112096	112096	he	179	' Ah ! that involves explanations , '
112099	112128	112096	112096	he	179	' to begin with , I must tell you that I met Count Litvinoff two days ago . It was from him I had Mrs Hatfield 's address . '
112129	112141	112054	112054	he	179	' I remember he and poor Hatfield used to be friends . '
112142	112173	112228	112228	Her	139	' He gave me the address for a special reason and for a special purpose . He has married Alice Hatfield , and he wished to let her people know . '
112174	112190	112238	112238	she	139	' Alice Hatfield ! But — how long ago ? How did he know her ? '
112191	112219	112054	112054	he	179	' He married her yesterday , and they have gone to Servia together . Miss Stanley , it was with Count Litvinoff that Alice left her home . '
112242	112267	112238	112238	she	139	' But he acted as though he believed Roland had taken her away . Oh , how could he have been so base and — '
112268	112274	112275	112275	Petrovitch	179	' Do not judge him , '
112278	112305	112275	112275	Petrovitch	179	' no one knows how he may have been tempted , and he has repented and atoned for his fault in as far as he could . '
112306	112318	112320	112320	Clare	139	' There are some things that can not be atoned for , '
112326	112347	112320	112320	Clare	139	' If it had not been for him this tragedy would never have happened . Oh , when I think — '
112353	112386	112348	112348	She	139	' When you think that he would have married you , owing all to Alice Hatfield , you can find no words to speak of his baseness . Is it not so ? '
112402	112406	112407	112407	he	179	' Years ago , '
112410	112454	112407	112407	he	179	' he and I were friends , and I love him still . He has told me much that has happened since last autumn . And I say , judge no man 's actions , for of his temptations you can not judge . '
112479	112487	112488	112488	Clare	139	' I wish you would tell me — '
112502	112513	112514	112514	he	2807	' There is much I would wish to tell you , '
112517	112583	112514	112514	he	2807	' but not to - day , when you are going on an errand of kindness and mercy . You do not want to talk now , you want to think ; and besides , I want to see you again . Will you write to me to - night , and tell me when and where I can see you alone to - morrow . '
112584	112592	112593	112593	she	139	' Yes , if you wish it , '
112596	112633	112593	112593	she	139	' I had so much to ask you ; and just now it seems as though I could think of nothing but that man , lying dead far north , and his poor wife here alone . '
112634	112676	112677	112677	Clare	139	' Then it is a promise . We are comrades , since we serve in the same ranks ; and between comrades a special farewell is necessary . Now , we will not talk , since you do not desire it . '
112846	112854	112855	112855	she	2808	' It is the Lord 's will , '
112876	112881	112872	112872	she	2808	' Thank God for a '

114368	114469	114470	114470	He	0	' You will think me ungenerous in leaving you without any advice on the subject you desire to be advised on . You shall hear from me before long . Perhaps when I am further from you I shall be better able to write you the sort of letter you will care to have from me . For those who love Liberty , life is made up of renunciations , but no renunciation could be so difficult , so bitter , as is to me the renouncing of this least faint ghost of a chance of winning you .

114807	114835	114804	114804	she	4425	' because I had to come into the City on money affairs ; and for the other , I have not asked you to do the impossible . '
