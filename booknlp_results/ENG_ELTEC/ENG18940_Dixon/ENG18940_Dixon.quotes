1111	1428	1110	1110	undertakers	317	' men , and Mary and her young brother Jimmie , who had arrived from Winchester , sat with a few old friends in the dining - room , waiting for the signal to go . There was the shuffling of men 's feet , as they staggered down the narrow London staircase with their heavy burden , and then someone had made the girl swallow some sal volatile , and she was pushed gently into the first mourning carriage , along with her brother . They had made the boy drink some of the sal volatile too , and they both felt strangely elated and highly strung . There were only those two now , and Mary felt warmly drawn to Jimmie , as they sat side by side in their new black clothes , the two chief personages in the ceremony of to - day . She even pretended not to hear when , some gutter urchins making complicated cartwheels as their contribution to the imposing procession , Jimmie , boy - like , gave way to a furtive giggle . The drive to Highgate seemed interminable , but at last , when the long procession crept slowly up the hill , it was in a kind of stupor that the girl saw and heard what happened . There was , she remembered afterwards , a long line of people , habited in black , awaiting them in silence inside the cemetery gate ; a tolling bell , neighing horses , and a penetrating scent of early lilac . Sunlight on the paths , on the shining marble tombs , on the humble little mounds covered in plush - like grass ; then a moving mass of black , a yawning hole , the creaking of ropes , and the mellifluous voice of the eminent professor , speaking his oration over some upturned clay . ‘

1584	1598	1483	1483	her	5	’ continued the orator , in his measured , lecture - room tones , ‘
1665	2019	2099	2100	isolated men	325	’ The sun was warm overhead , the scent of the pink may was strong in the nostrils ; a joyous twittering in an adjacent bush told of mating birds , of new life in the nests , of Nature rioting in an insolent triumph . The orator paused for an instant , coughed , and felt in his breast pocket for his notes . He was anxious , above all things , that the reporters should not print a garbled version of his speech . Round the open grave pressed the devotees of science , the followers of the religion of humanity ; grey - skinned , anxious - looking men and women , with lined foreheads and hair prematurely tinged with grey ; large heads with bulging foreheads , thin throats and sloping shoulders ; the women with nervous , overworked worked faces , the men with the pathetic , unrestful features of those who are sustained in a life of self - denial by their ethical sense alone . The ceremony of to - day was a great moral demonstration . All classes who think were represented . Side by side stood a white - haired Radical Countess in simple half - mourning and the spare form of a Socialist working woman , with red , ungloved wrists and an inspired look on her worn face . There , with her mother , Lady Jane , was Alison Ives . Lady Jane , who was impressionable , was already exhibiting a pocket - handkerchief , and not far off , Mary caught for one instant the brown , wistful eyes of Vincent Hemming . The sun grew hotter and hotter overhead . One or two of the mourners began putting up umbrellas . The perfume of pink hawthorn became almost oppressive ; an early butterfly hovered over a baby 's grave planted with sweet - smelling flowers . A light breeze fluttered a laburnum - bush which hung over a neighbouring marble tomb , a large , opulent , marble tomb , on which was cut in glittering gilt letters : ‘
2028	2095	2099	2100	isolated men	325	’ And everywhere there was the whiteness of graves . In ridges , in waves , in mounds , they stuck , tooth - like , from the fecund earth . They shone , in gleaming , distant lines , up to the ridge of the hill ; they crowded in serried battalions , down to the cemetery gates . The speaker was concluding his speech . ‘
2102	2123	2099	2100	isolated men	325	’ he said , raising his voice so that all who were on the edge of the crowd should hear , ‘
2235	2453	2454	2454	Jim	130	’ In the silence which followed there was heard one long , sweet , penetrating bird - call . One of the chief mourners , the boy Jimmie , was sobbing loudly when the professor 's voice stopped , and with something gripping at her throat , the sister led him away . She reproached herself with having brought him ; the young , she thought , should not know what sorrow is . The two spare , black - clad figures stepped aside up the hill . Out yonder , at their feet , the dun - colour of the buildings lost in the murkiness of the horizon line , London was spread out . Here and there a dome , a spire loomed out of the dim bluish - grey panorama . A warm haze hung over the great city ; here and there a faint fringe of tree - tops told of a placid park ; now and again the shrill whistle of an engine , blown northward by the wind , spoke of the bustle of journeys , of the turmoil of railway - stations , of partings , of arrivals , of the change and travail of human life , of the strangers who come , of the failures who must go . ‘
2456	2469	2454	2454	Jim	130	’ said the girl suddenly , taking the boy by the arm , ‘
2475	2488	2454	2454	Jim	130	're going to make it listen to us , you and I. We 're
2509	2510	2454	2454	Jim	130	’ ‘
2517	2539	2454	2454	Jim	130	’ said the boy , turning up a pretty , sensitive face , and a pink nose all smeared with tears . ‘
2544	3710	3711	3711	father	1669	’ The black crowd yonder was swaying , separating , and disintegrating itself into separate sable dots which were now seen descending the paths to the cemetery - gate . And slowly , they too stepped down the gravel path . They came home to a house that was empty and orderly again ; a house in which his door stood open , the pale light of a spring afternoon filling the desolate room . The blinds were pulled up , and downstairs , in the kitchen , the servants had begun to talk and laugh . Towards dusk , Jimmie got engrossed in a new book of adventures , but the girl , restless still , wandered about the house in her black gown looking at everything with strange eyes . Something terrible , unforeseen had happened which altered her whole life . Towards the boy poring over the picture - book she felt much of a mother 's feelings ; it behoved her to look after him now that his father was gone . How long the time seemed — would the interminable day never end ? There must be lots for her to do . And casting about in her mind , she remembered that this was the day on which she always gave out the groceries from her store cupboard ; there was the seamstress to pay , too , who was altering a black dress for her up - stairs . So Mary dragged herself down to the kitchens and presently to the top of the house . It would be nice of her , she thought , to go in and speak to the woman who was sewing alone . It was sad for a young woman to be alone . The pale , pinkish light of a spring evening fell on a drab - complexioned girl , whose fat hand moved , as she sewed , with the regularity of a machine . Now the needle was thrust in the fold of black stuff , and the light fell on her ill - cut nails ; now the hand was aloft , in the semi- obscurity ; it was all tame , monotonous and regular as a clock . She was a docile , humble , uncomplaining creature , who suggested inevitably some patient domestic animal . Her features , rubbed out and effaced with generations of servility , spoke of the small mendacities of the women of the lower classes , of the women who live on ministering to the caprices of the well - to - do . To - day it would seem she had assumed an appropriately dolorous expression . It sometimes soothed Mary to stitch . Taking up a strip of black merino , she began to hem . The seamstress 's hand continued to move with docile regularity , and , as Mary looked at her , she was curiously reminded of many women she had seen : ladies , mothers of large families , who sat and sewed with just such an expression of unquestioning resignation . The clicking sound of the needle , the swish of the drawn - out thread , the heavy breathing of the work - woman , all added to the impression . Yes , they too were content to exist subserviently , depending always on someone else , using the old feminine stratagems , the well - worn feminine subterfuges , to gain their end . The woman who sews is eternally the same . The light began to fail now ; very soon it would be dark . Mary threw down her work with an impatient gesture , and , in the grey twilight , an immense pity seized her for the patient figure bending , near the window , over her foolish strips of flounces , the figure of the woman at her monotonous toil . THE life of Mary Erle , like that of many another woman in the end of the nineteenth century , had been more or less in the nature of an experiment . Born too late for the simple days of the fifties , when all it behoved a young girl to do was to mind her account - book , read her Tennyson , show a proper enthusiasm for fancy - work stitches , and finally , with many blushes , accept the hand of the first young man who desired to pay taxes and to fulfil the duties of a loyal British subject ( and the young man , it must be remembered , in the middle of this century , actually did both ) , Mary was yet too soon for the time when parents begin to take their responsibilities seriously , and when the girl is sometimes as carefully prepared , as thoroughly equipped , as her brother for the fight of life . A garden full of flowers , a house full of books , scraps of travel : these things were her education . Out of the years she could pick scenes and figures which typified her bringing - up . There was the plain , self - contained , and not too clean baby . A child who was always grubbing in a garden , for it lived then in a house in St. John 's Wood ; a child who was devoted to animals and insects , who was on intimate terms with the many - legged wood - lice , which curled themselves up with all haste into complete balls when she touched them ; a child for whom snails and black - beetles had no terrors , and who had much to say to the green , hairy caterpillars which hung about the pear tree . There was a huge , fluffy , black cat , too , which represented , perhaps , the child 's primitive idea of a deity ; for , though she adored it , the adoration was leavened with a wholesome awe , a feeling which was not unconnected with certain unmerited chastisements in the shape of scratches on her fat , bare legs . More often , to be sure , the black cat was amiable , and even allowed itself to be carried up to bed , with its hind legs straying out helplessly from under the child 's arm , to be presently concealed with all haste and caution under the white sheets and blankets , from whence its sharp - pointed ears and wide black cheeks arose with the most exquisitely mirth - provoking effect . With what inscrutable amber eyes did the black cat gaze for hours into hers ! how it imposed on her babyish imagination with its self - contained , majestic manners , its air of detachment from the vain shows of the world ! The man with the kind smile , whom the child called ‘
3713	3733	3711	3711	father	1669	’ used to laugh at her adoration , tell her she was a little Egyptian , and called the cat ‘
3736	3761	3762	3762	you	333	’ She thought it a funny name , and not being altogether sure the black cat would approve of it , generally addressed it as ‘
3764	5612	3762	3762	you	333	’ And the cat would sit on long summer afternoons on the grass under the pear tree , or on foggy autumn days on a stool by the fireside , with paws neatly tucked away , its neck - ruff fluffed out , purring benignly in response to her confidences . Indeed , in looking back , the first tragedy of the child 's life was the death of the black cat . It lay , one sultry July day , under a laurel bush in the garden , with glazed eyes which gave no signs of life . All morning and all afternoon the child sat there and fanned the flies away , until her idol was stiff , and then a hole was hastily dug , and the black cat was thrust out of sight . And never any more , in the warm summer afternoons , did a soft , furry thing go sailing , tail in air , over the close - cropped lawn ; nor , on winter evenings , was a rhythmical purring to be heard hard by the tall fender which guarded the nursery fire . It was the first great void ; the first heartache had come . A strange , indolent child , whose little hands were usually thrust beneath her pinafore when anyone spoke to her ; for surely she could not be always washing herself , and to be on really intimate terms with insects and things , one can not , like grown - up people , be always thinking of one 's nails . She usually , too , concealed a small piece of putty about her person — an unpardonable sin , this , in the eyes of mother and nurse — for putty is useful in a thousand ways , and is , besides , so thrillingly delicious to feel surreptitiously in the recesses of one 's pocket . At this time the child held the whole race of dolls in high scorn . They were a foolish , over - dressed , uninteresting tribe , with manifestly absurd cheeks and eye - lashes , and with a simper which was as artificial as that of the ladies in chignons and flounces who came to call at the house of an afternoon . She , on her part , was all for the violent delights of miniature guns and real gunpowder , the toilsome construction of fleets of wooden boats with the aid of a blunt knife and a plank of wood ; fleets which were set a - sail , with flying pennants , on the cistern hard by the kitchen . There were boy neighbours who aided and abetted her in these delights , and great naval battles would come off between the Dutch and English fleets in the kitchen cistern , in which sometimes Van Tromp , and sometimes Blake , emerged victorious . The child , perhaps , did not take her patriotism seriously , as the boys did ; she was content to be Van Tromp , since they insisted on being Blake and Monk . All that was of vital importance was that a fight of some sort should come off . The mother sank early out of ken . First they said that she was poorly , and had gone to Italy , and then they said that she was very ill , and afterwards that she was in heaven ; so that for a long time the child used to think vaguely , as she sat in the summer - house with pursed - up lips and knitted brows , notching and slicing at her ships , that Italy and heaven were perhaps the same place . Nurse said that her mummy was an angel now ; but , in all the picture - books , angels had long , smooth hair , wore a kind of night - gown , and had enormous , folding wings . The child could not picture her mother looking like that ; she always remembered her in many flounces , with a headache ; and certainly , no , certainly , mummy never had any wings out of her back . The child could recollect that , some little time before her mother went to Italy , they took her upstairs one day and showed her a baby , with a red , crinkled face , lying in an over - trimmed cradle . She did not care for babies , she would rather have had a nice , new , fluffy kitten to replace the old black cat ; but when they told her it was a little brother , of course that altered matters . She was sorry her brother should be so small , so fretful , and so red in the face ; she would rather have had him the same size as herself , so that he could have been Van Tromp for once , and she the victorious Blake ; but still , any sort or size of brother was better than none . Although , in a year or so , the baby developed into something suspiciously like a doll , with his fat , pink cheeks , his round , china - blue eyes , his dump of a nose , and his entire absence of chin , still , he was far more entertaining than that simpering and foolish tribe . Baby Jim 's pink toes could kick ; his little fist , with the creases of fat at the wrist , could hit out ; there were warlike possibilities in him . In a word , Baby Jim was alive . At ten years old the girl began to have strange fits of vanity . There were little shoes and frocks which she held in high favour , and others which nothing would induce her to put on . To wear a pinafore , now , was a bitter humiliation , and about this period she had the most definite theories about the dressing of hair . The discussion on coiffures usually took place in her bath , when a small , slippery person covered in soap - suds was to be heard arguing with her nurse — an argument which was not unusually enforced by physical violence — on the superior attractions of crimped to curled locks . At ten years old — she was of opinion — a person was grown up , or at least as old as any one need be . Why , big , tall men , with long beards and spectacles , who came to see her father , would bend down and ask her gravely if she would be their little wife ? The child had been to more than one wedding , and she was aware that a wife was a person who began by wearing a beautiful white satin train , with white flowers and a veil ; a person who was as imposing as that angel which nurse said her mother had become , although she had not , of course , any wings . The child was not sure whether she would best like to be a bride or an angel . The latter , it was true , had the additional attraction of a golden halo ; but she thought , probably , that matters might be compromised , and that she could be a wife and have a halo , too . The scene shifts now , for they had moved to another quarter of London , and the change made a vast difference in the child 's tastes and habits . There was no cropped lawn now , where the pear tree made long shadows on summer afternoons , where she had a personal interest in a plot of ground of her own , and at least a bowing acquaintance with a whole host of fussy bumble - bees , gay yellow butterflies , furry caterpillars , and lazy snails . There was no summer - house in which ship - building could be carried on , and no convenient cistern in which to sail one 's fleet . The firing off of toy guns was erased from the list of possible amusements . The house was a tall one , in a street in town , and rural delights were represented by a square yard at the back , which was haunted by stray , attenuated cats , and in which grew a solitary , stunted sycamore . But , on the other hand , there was the new fascination of book - shelves , which ran all over the new house , so that the child had but to mount a chair and reach out a small hand , and , lo ! romance and battles , laughter and tears , were all to be enjoyed at her will . She had only to pick out her volume . It was a revelation in the possibilities of life . Looking back now , it must be owned that she led an odd life . The man with the kind smile was fond of his little daughter , but he was always at work , either at experiments in his laboratory or bending over his desk in the study . Nothing happened in the way of experience as it does to other children . One night her father took her to the theatre for the first time . A famous actress , an old friend , was giving Antony and Cleopatra , and they went first behind the scenes . They walked across a bare , lofty , cavern - like place , with dusty wooden boards , which sloped upwards , and the child was lifted up to peep through a little hole in a red velvet curtain , and through it she saw a large horse - shoe with quantities of people chattering as they waited . There was a great deal of tawdry gilt , and many gas chandeliers , and the people , especially at the top of the horseshoe , stamped with their feet and whistled . She did not care much for the play , when they presently took their places in a box close to the stage . There was a stout lady in long amber draperies , who kept throwing her arms round a tired - looking man with a brown face and a suit of gilt armour . The child was more amused when , between the acts , they went behind the scenes again to see the famous actress in her dressing - room . Unfortunately , the stout lady looked fatter than ever when seen close , but there were so many amusing things about — a wig with long plaits , several serpent bracelets , a diadem , and a beautiful golden girdle set with emeralds as big as pheasants '

9170	9965	9161	9161	his	308	’ And so it was , indeed . The next morning , when the servant went up to call him , the professor had been dead some hours . The doctors spoke of a clot of blood in the brain , of over - work , and over - strain . And in the tall , darkened house in Harley Street , the child who had played , the girl who had danced , died too . AS sometimes happens with busy people in London , the Erles had hundreds of acquaintances and but few intimate friends . A friendship is costly , in point of time , and Mary found , when one chapter of her life was done that spring morning , that there were two people only that she must imperatively see : a man and a woman — Vincent Hemming and Alison Ives . How their features stood out among the crowd of vague faces , which belonged to that other life ! Alison Ives especially , who always looked like a Reynolds , with her handsome , clever face , her superb air , and her huge hats tied under the chin . With that grave sweetness which endears to us the Siddons in the National Gallery , she yet had the look of a thinker , modernised by a slightly bored expression , and a little distinguished way which at once made other women in her vicinity look dowdy or vulgar . Her clothes always seemed to suit her , as its feathers do a bird . There are women who look like an édition de luxe of a poor book ; Alison Ives suggested that of a classic . It had been her habit for a couple of years past to sit at the feet of Professor Erle ; she constantly announced , indeed , that he was the only man she wanted to marry , only that he was firm , and would not permit it . Besides , it was no good trying to compete with her mother , Lady Jane , who was sixty - five — and irresistible . Women of sixty - five , she said , were nowadays the only people who inspired a great passion . She supposed her turn would come — a quarter of a century hence . But , all the same , the daughter was much admired in the world ; but the world , as understood by her mother , Lady Jane , by no means entirely satisfied this eminently modern young woman . It was whispered that she had serious views , though it was certain that she was pretty enough to please a Prime Minister , and clever enough to entertain a guardsman , if she found herself next to either at dinner . Alison did not mind which , she said ; in fact , after a long day in the East - end , when she was tired , she rather preferred the guardsman , who would be content to talk of polo ponies , whereas , when a young woman is put next to a Premier , it behoves her to look , at any rate , very brilliant indeed . Though she never smoked , was ignorant of billiard cues and guns , and hated playing the man , Alison had been heard to murmur something like an oath . It was a habit which she had picked up in Paris , when she was working in a sculptor 's studio ; and she always declared that dame and sapristi , being in a foreign tongue , were notoriously less efficacious , and by inference more pardonable , than swearing in the vernacular . For the rest , with the best heart in the world , she had a somewhat caustic tongue , could interpret Chopin like an artist , and always had her hair exquisitely dressed . What attracted people at once was her womanliness , her lack of snobbishness , her real desire to be in sympathy with her own sex . Like all exceptional people , she had her moods , and sometimes for months together she was heard of only as forming one of a party in this or that great country house , while at other times she would come to town and study fitfully , or devote herself to the task of helping young girls . Once , in the middle of the season , she took a lodging in a by - street in the Mile End Road , but she only stayed seven weeks , and , when she appeared again , the expression on her face was sadder than before . ‘
9978	9993	9969	9969	one	1802	’ she said , when Mary asked her why she had left so soon . ‘
10090	10124	10133	10133	her	497	’ Alison kept her word . This spring had found her ensconced in a workman 's flat in the Mayfair district , with one small servant , whom she had befriended in Whitechapel . ‘
10135	10148	10149	10151	All we women	498	’ explained Alison , laughing . She hated to be thought philanthropic . ‘
10313	10359	10312	10312	I	0	'm going to get our cook at Ives Court to teach me how to broil a mutton - chop , though , I daresay , she 's too grand for that ; and I shall go and watch the laundry - maid at her work . ’
10360	10368	10369	10369	Mary	124	‘ And your hands , you lunatic ? ’
10373	10383	10369	10369	Mary	124	‘ I think I see you with red knuckles . ’
10384	10387	10389	10389	Alison	128	‘ Oh , ’
10393	10431	10369	10369	Mary	124	‘ I shall tell that little manicure just out of Bond Street to come twice a week . There 's that new stuff , “ Eau des Orchidées ” ; it 's wonderful . Do n't imagine I 'm
10462	10731	10732	10733	No woman	508	’ This was the young woman who was shown into the study by Elizabeth one morning a few days after the funeral at Highgate . Mary was bending over a desk , busy with her father 's proofs , when she came in . The elder girl 's beautiful brown eyes were suspiciously shiny ; it had evidently cost her an effort to come into the study which she knew so well . The two girls wrung each other 's hands silently . But after the first kiss , in which she said everything that she dared not put in words , Alison , with her ready tact , began talking business at once . The younger girl announced her plans frankly . There was just enough money for her to live meagrely , quietly on for the next few years , while she tried her luck at art . Mary had always meant to paint some day , when her time should be at her own disposal . To paint was a long - cherished ambition , mused over on drowsy afternoons in the reading - room of the British Museum , nursed during the days when she had remained bending over a desk in her father 's study , patiently inscribing what the professor dictated as he walked up and down the little room . As for Jimmie , he was to remain at Winchester , and , if he could succeed in winning a scholarship , was to go to Oxford , as the father had wished . By living carefully this could be managed . ‘
10741	10749	10732	10733	No woman	508	’ said Alison , after a pause , ‘

11552	11563	11497	11499	Evelina 's baby	545	'm trying to cultivate a sense of humour in Evelina . ’
11564	11574	11576	11576	Mary	124	‘ It will be difficult , wo n't it ? ’
11585	11822	11576	11576	Mary	124	‘ Never mind . It 's what women ought to cultivate above all other things , especially the poorer classes . With a keen sense of the ridiculous , they would never fall in love at all ; and as to improvident marriages , they simply would n't exist . If you could see the baby 's father!—a pudding - faced boy , who helps in a tiny cheesemonger 's shop down there . She “ walked out ” with him for two years . He is now nearly nineteen . It is all very well to smile , but it is terrible — for the woman . In the evening , when she has done her work , she lights the lamp in my little sitting - room ( everything thing is quite simple , you know ; only I 've got a few books , and the tiny Corot from my den at Ives Court , and the Rossetti drawings ) , and then I read aloud while she knits . I read comic things — Dickens , Mark Twain , and so on ; and when the poor girl laughs , I feel that I have scored . She is n't much more than a child , you know , and she has such a good heart . I think she likes to talk to me : she tells me her little story . ’
11823	11827	11829	11829	Mary	124	‘ A story , ’
11831	11839	11829	11829	Mary	124	‘ she has a story , then ? ’
11840	11850	11852	11852	Alison	128	‘ Oh ! a common one enough down there , ’
11854	11972	11852	11852	Alison	128	‘ She drifted into the East - end from Essex , about three years ago , and became a drudge - of - all - work in a family of ten , in the Mile End Road . Her master was pleased to make love to her when his wife and the eight children had gone for the day to South - end ; Evelina ran out of the house , leaving her box behind , and never dared to go back . Mary , these London idylls are not pretty . She is , however , beginning to show a faint sense of the ridiculous . I believe I shall make a sensible person of Evelina . ’
12060	12117	12027	12027	She	128	‘ By the by , did I tell you the adventure I had on my visit to the Blaythewaites ? My dear , it was only by the intervention of Providence that I did n't have to dine the first night in my tailor - gown . Of course , I went down third - class — ’
12118	12133	12135	12135	Mary	124	‘ That 's because you are saving for Evelina 's baby , I suppose , ’
12137	12141	12144	12144	Alison	128	‘ And so , ’
12153	12228	12144	12144	Alison	128	‘ the footman never thought of looking for me there . They all drove off without me , and my basket trunk , with my favourite white gown in it , got taken off with some other people to another place about five miles off . However , it was got back in time , and when I told my little story at dinner to Sir Horace , he was immensely amused , though I 'm

12268	12287	12266	12266	Evelina	154	’ said Mary , laughing . Alison was already at the door , tying on her hat firmly . ‘
12296	12303	12290	12290	I	0	’ she said , flushing up . ‘

12556	12557	12503	12503	Reichemberg	162	’ ‘
12574	12968	12568	12568	I	0	’ cried Mary down the passage . In another instant she was gone , and the house seemed blank and empty again . But trying not to think of her sorrow , Mary went steadily on with the proofs . MR . VINCENT HEMMING was looked upon by the professor , by Jimmie , by the servants , and indeed by everyone except Mary herself , as her especial property . He was , in fact , one of the few intimate visitors who came when he liked to the Harley Street house . He had become part of her grown - up life , having first appeared about a year after that Sunday night parting , when the world had seemed very empty indeed . His little air of deference was eminently attractive to a young girl , who fancied that she had done for ever with emotion . As for Jimmie , he adored Vincent , though Jimmie generally adored new acquaintances — for the space of about six weeks . Hemming 's father had been a politician of some note , who had twice held office , and Vincent had pre - eminently the manners of one burdened with state secrets . His little reserves , a certain air of caution , of discretion , all belonged to those early experiences when his father was alive . To be sure , he had charming , rather old - fashioned manners , affected the speech of the mid - century , and was carried away by few of the modern crazes or fads . A well - shaped forehead — of the showily intellectual type — wavy hair , already threaded with grey , a short , pointed beard , and eyes of an innocent , penetrating brown , made up a personality which appealed at once to dowagers and young girls . At table he looked very well , although his shoulders were inclined to slope slightly , but when he stood up you saw that he had not the eminently British habit of planting himself firmly , squarely , and self - assertively on his feet . For the rest , he had a small property which brought him in about three hundred a year , and though already grey , was still spoken of by his elders as a ‘
12973	13122	12568	12568	I	0	’ Though a Conservative , he believed in the higher education , even the enfranchisement of women . It was a subject on which he was persuasively eloquent . It was quite pretty , ladies always thought , to hear him talk of his dreams , his sacrifices , and an occasional article which he succeeded in getting inserted on his favourite subject in the Fortnightly or the Contemporary was laboriously written in studied English , and with a persuasive pen . He had a great deal to say on the future of the race , and on the necessity of maintaining a high ethical standard , and he always waxed exceedingly wroth over the literary excesses of MM . Zola and de Goncourt , and thanked heaven , so to speak , that those eminent pioneers of Realism did not belong to the Anglo - Saxon family . ‘
13127	13142	12568	12568	I	0	’ he announced one day , when he was calling on Lady Jane Ives , ‘
13168	13169	13472	13472	you	566	’ ‘
13172	13178	13472	13472	you	566	’ said Alison , dryly , ‘
13207	13454	13455	13457	My poor child	566	’ But Lady Jane , who had knocked about the most depraved society in Europe for half a century , and who clung with amiable tenacity to her illusions , always agreed with Mr. Hemming . Lady Jane , who was a judge of such things , said that he was one of the few modern young men whom she could endure in her drawing - room for more than twenty minutes . A day or two after Alison 's visit , Mr. Vincent Hemming appeared , looking charmingly correct and sympathetic , in a black - and - white spotted tie and a band round his hat . He had gauged to a nicety his degree of intimacy with the great man who was gone . It was a day when outlines were clearly cut , and colours glaring ; everything looked crisp , hard , decided , inevitable . The rooms wore the unsettled , desolate look of a house that is soon to be empty . One or two favourite pictures had already been lifted down from off the wall , leaving a patch of clean paper visible ; one bookcase was already a dark void , the volumes were piled on the floor ready to be packed . Most of the library was to be sold , and Mary now stood on a ladder , running a regretful eye along the next case of beloved volumes , when Vincent Hemming came in . ‘
13459	13468	13455	13457	My poor child	566	’ he said , in his sympathetic voice , ‘
13479	13480	13472	13472	you	566	’ ‘
13487	13504	13481	13481	I	0	’ said Mary , getting down from the ladder , and putting out a dusty hand . ‘
13544	13545	13538	13538	Jimmie	130	’ ‘
13553	13585	13548	13548	you	566	’ he asked , after a little pause , during which his eye had travelled round the dismantled walls , and the cavernous shelves of the once cosy drawing - room . ‘
13598	13602	13603	13603	I	0	’ she explained ; ‘
13620	13621	13623	13623	yourself	566	’ ‘
13629	13630	13623	13623	yourself	566	’ ‘
13639	13678	13631	13631	I	0	’ she answered , knocking two volumes together in a determined manner to get the dust from the edges . Her mouth had got those little obstinate tucks at the corners now , which he knew so well . ‘
13715	13716	13696	13696	She	165	’ ‘
13730	13804	13722	13722	you	0	’ he was relieved , distinctly relieved , when Mary announced her intention of adopting art as a profession . Painting , especially in watercolours , he considered an eminently lady - like occupation ; it was , indeed , associated in his imagination with certain drawings of Welsh mountains and torrents , executed by his mother with the prim technique of the forties , which now adorned his chambers in the Temple . ‘
13815	13848	13813	13813	you	0	’ said Vincent , as his eye wandered round the room again . The tone of his voice was vague : he was evidently considering something which took up all his attention . ‘
13856	13862	13813	13813	you	0	’ she said , simply . ‘
13925	13926	13912	13912	He	581	’ ‘
13937	13941	13930	13931	Professor Erle	123	’ replied Vincent , ‘
13952	14102	14103	14103	I	0	’ There was a long silence , during which all that this loss meant to each of these two passed through their minds . They had moved to the window now , through which a light breeze fluttered in . The tall , brownish - grey houses were spruced up for the season with clean blinds and boxes of daisies and spiraea . A couple of blonde girls in pink cotton made a gay splash of colour against the grey - toned street as they walked buoyantly along . A hansom was drawing up at the pale - green door yonder , and out of it sprang a young man in a glossy hat , a gardenia , and patent - leather boots . Just opposite some workmen were stretching a red - and - white awning for an evening party . The outward aspect of affairs was unchanged . ‘
14106	14125	14103	14103	I	0	’ said Mary , gazing at the striped awning , which the men had now succeeded in propping , ‘
14153	14165	14150	14151	Mr. Hemming	129	’ she added , with one of her comic little frowns , ‘
14203	14204	14205	14205	You	0	’ ‘
14224	14225	14216	14216	you	0	’ ‘
14238	14239	14216	14216	you	0	’ ‘
14259	14275	14216	14216	you	0	’ replied Vincent , smiling a little fatuously . Mary turned from the window abruptly . ‘
14284	14296	14216	14216	you	0	’ she said , with a brusqueness which she sometimes affected . ‘
14302	14318	14216	14216	you	0	’ she continued , mounting the steps , and beginning to hand down the volumes . ‘
14358	14359	14360	14360	My	0	’ ‘
14377	14389	14364	14364	you	0	’ said Vincent Hemming , in his old - fashioned way . ‘
14418	14588	14589	14589	Mary	124	’ Some colour had come into the girl 's cheeks as she sat on the top of the ladder and dropped the books into his arms , covering him , as she did so , with a light cloud of dust ; but she looked pathetically delicate in her close - fitting , sombre gown , which threw up the pallor of her throat , the mauvish tinge of her lips , the dark rings round her eyes . Vincent Hemming , whatever he had meant to do when he entered the dismantled drawing - room , was fairly carried away by the spectacle of Mary 's childish face and busy , nervous little hands re - arranging her destiny in her own decided fashion . It touched him , and , at the same time , irritated him , producing the feeling that , as a man , he was bound to interfere . One step nearer now , and the course of a lifetime would be changed . ‘
14594	14616	14589	14589	Mary	124	’ he said suddenly , in an imploring tone , while they were both startled by the emotion in his voice , ‘
14629	14694	14618	14618	you	124	’ The girl turned to look at him . His penetrating brown eyes were actually suffused with tears ; a nerve was ticking visibly in his forehead . It all seemed far - off , improbable , impossible . Vincent Hemming , her old friend , had turned into this imploring , visibly - suffering man . Mary burst into an hysterical little laugh . ‘
14709	14717	14706	14706	you	0	're only saying that because you think I 'm
14734	14739	14732	14732	you	0	’ she asked hurriedly . ‘
14750	14788	14742	14742	we	592	’ she added , seeing that he was still silent . He had flipped the dust from his face and coat with easy tact , and stood , smiling up at her , close by her side . ‘
14794	14859	14789	14789	I	0	’ continued the girl , doubtfully , slowly twisting one of the buttons of his frock coat . She had come down several steps of the ladder , so that her eyes were on a level with his . The nerve no longer ticked in his forehead ; the muscles of his mouth relaxed ; there was already something of triumph in his look . ‘
14866	14873	14864	14864	dear	594	’ she said , very gravely . ‘
14894	14895	14887	14887	you	594	’ ‘
14905	15179	14899	14899	I	0	’ said a changed , thick voice in her ear , and in the next instant two arms encircled her , and two lips were crushed against hers . For the first minute a consciousness of sorrow overwhelmed her . For good , for evil , the girl knew that she was giving herself up to this man , whom a minute ago she had looked upon with the cool eye and discriminating judgment of mere friendship . All the tragic potentialities of a woman 's life , the uncertainties and sorrows of her who gives her happiness into another 's keeping , flashed before her .... Why , why must it be ? Only a minute ago , and she had been ready to face the world alone , to be herself , to express herself , to work out her own destiny . And now it was all changed . Something held her against her will . This man — a minute ago her friend , and now , in this infinitesimal atom of time , her lover , who stood before her with red , flushed face , and looked with longing eyes into hers : this man had already communicated his trouble to her . His hands , which held her two wrists as they stood there gazing at each other , felt like links of iron . In that one supreme moment , Mary Erle tasted for the first time , in all its intensity , the helplessness of woman , the inborn feeling of subjection to a stronger will , inherited through generations of submissive feminine intelligences . ‘
15190	15194	15186	15186	I	0	’ she said . ‘
15231	15244	15221	15221	I	0	’ she protested , drawing herself away , with her fine smile . ‘
15260	15261	15258	15258	father	1669	’ ‘
15277	15281	15262	15262	I	0	’ said Vincent . ‘
15335	15336	15331	15331	I	0	’ ‘
15343	15362	15337	15337	You're	0	’ she asked , blankly . Already the inexorable chain which nature forges bound her to this man . ‘
15459	15509	15510	15510	I	0	’ he added , with a touch of his old - fashioned manner . He was sitting down on the sofa now , and looked already his quiet , well - bred , rather deferential self again . An hour later Vincent got up , reluctantly , to go . ‘
15526	15530	15531	15531	My	0	’ he explained , ‘
15543	15550	15542	15542	I	0	'm thinking of starting quite soon . ’
15551	15555	15557	15557	Mary	124	‘ Are you ? ’
15715	15718	15719	15719	he	129	‘ Dear , ’
15722	15724	15719	15719	he	129	‘ I 'm
15742	15891	15719	15719	he	129	’ When he had gone , she stooped about again among the rows of books , sorting them mechanically , without thinking much what she was doing . Little clouds of dust rose in the twilight room . The tall , grim houses shut out all that remained of a daffodil - tinted sky . Tired and unstrung , the girl threw herself on to the sofa where she and Vincent Hemming had sat , and presently , to her surprise , she was conscious that two large , salt tears were coursing their way down her dusty cheeks . THE Central London School of Art , though backed by all the majesty of State support , was , at the first blush , a somewhat disillusionising place to the youthful aspirant for fame . To the over - nice , to be sure , it lacked an art ‘
15894	16308	15719	15719	he	129	’ except such a material one as is generated by ancient paint - tubes , oily rags , furtively - munched sandwiches , and the presence of a preponderance of people to whom the daily tub is possibly not of vital importance . Outwardly , the Art School was only No . 55 , in a dreary by - street near Portland Road ; a small thoroughfare of sinister aspect , in which the houses seemed to be frowning at each other 's dubious appearance . The white blinds — now grey with age and dirt — seemed always drawn ; no one ever seemed to emerge from those faded , bespattered front doors . It was a dreary , mysterious street , of which , when Mary thought of it , she invariably saw the two ends swallowed up in a blurred , yellowish fog . Inside , this temple of the fine arts consisted of one long room with a glass roof , divided , towards one end , by a serge curtain of bronze green . The walls were tinted a dingy - olive colour , throwing up the plaster Laocoon , the torso of the Theseus , the Apollo Belvedere , with its slightly supercilious air , the frowning Moses of Michael Angelo , and the simpering Clytie , with startling distinctness . A small écorché stood on a shelf , and all around , looking like the frozen remains of some monster operating - theatre , were eerie - looking arms , legs , feet , and hands cut off above the wrist . Here , too , were the candidates for the Royal Academy , all laboriously stippling their drawings of the Laocoon with twists of bread and stumps ; a process in which they had been engaged for some six months past ; while in the other division of the room was posed a child dressed like an Italian contadina , surrounded by easels on every side . It was the afternoon on which the model sat . Painting from the life was carried on at the Central London School of Art on but two afternoons a week , being looked upon as a kind of frivolous extra which should not be allowed to occupy the mind of the serious student to the detriment of the stippled Laocoon . It was a raw December day , but inside the fumes of a charcoal stove made the students '
16394	16752	16775	16775	she	617	' wings , a trimming understood to be dear to the female artist the wide world over . And though perhaps their hair left , like their speech , something to be desired , on the whole the girls were less objectionable than the boy - students , whose linen was not irreproachable , and who used to disappear in groups of five or six during the sitting , to return to their places presently , bringing with them a suspicious odour of bitter beer and inexpensive tobacco . An English art school has none of the boisterous , contagious hilarity of a French atelier . Decent silence reigned , broken only by the hoarse , repressed chuckles of a couple of boys as they exchanged a whispered witticism , or the rare , high - pitched , but almost inaudible titter of a student with ringlets as she bent over her easel . Mary Erle , with her neat hair and her well made black dress , looked like a little princess as she sat , with a slight frown and tight - shut lips , among the outer ring of easels . She wore the same expression as of old , in the summerhouse in St. John 's Wood , when she sat alone notching and slicing at her wooden fleet . And indeed , the girl was as much alone now , in this studio full of human beings , as in the silence of the leafy garden . Vincent had gone on his travels — had been gone , indeed , for nearly six months , and all that she had to remind her of that unexpected demonstration of affection in the Harley Street drawing - room was a crumpled letter with an Indian post - mark which she carried about in her pocket . Yes , she was alone , for had she spoken to the boys , she was sure they would have tried to be jocose ; and she dreaded the confidences of the young ladies , some of whom had prosperous flirtations , carried on in neighbouring pastry - cooks '
16764	16766	16775	16775	she	617	‘ advanced ’
16907	16913	16925	16925	himself	173	‘ artist and a gentleman . ’
17032	17046	17047	17048	Mr. Jackson	173	‘ I 'd advise you to look sharp and begin , Miss Erle , ’
17069	17086	17047	17048	Mr. Jackson	173	‘ That serpent'll take you every day of six weeks , let alone the figure . They 're
17137	17138	17127	17127	you	637	’ ‘
17149	17150	17143	17143	I	0	’ ‘
17168	17180	17159	17160	Miss Erle	126	’ suggested Mr. Jackson , who was good - nature itself . ‘
17202	17217	17189	17189	You	637	’ continued the young man , his small , pale eyes twinkling with vivacity ; ‘
17235	17242	17227	17227	I	0	’ he added with sudden candour . ‘
17256	17539	17245	17245	I	0	’ There were two or three girls , besides herself , who were competing for the Academy , and several men , one of whom was verging on fifty years of age , and whose hair and unkempt beard were already turned grey . A legend current in the school related that this person had been competing for the Royal Academy Schools ever since he was eighteen years old . There was Miss Simpkins , a strapping young woman with a large , vague face , which somehow suggested a muffin , and who carried a small edition of Modern Painters about in a leather hand - bag , together with a pocket - comb , a hand - mirror , some ham sandwiches , and a selection of different kinds of chalk , and who had many confidences to impart to a pale girl with red ringlets , whom Mary remembered as the daughter of a confectioner in St. John 's Wood , a girl who affected peacock - blue velveteen , and was understood to be intermittently in love with Mr. Jackson . On the December day in question the glass door opened , and a small , pale man , wearing a frock coat and a narrow black necktie , and having the appearance and manner of an attorney 's head clerk , stood bending over the first easel . Mr. Sanderson , the headmaster , was a person who rarely committed himself to a definite opinion , and especially to an adverse one . He wished , above all things , to be well with the students , so that his usual criticism took the form of : — ‘
17621	17661	17618	17619	Miss Simpkins	174	’ And Miss Simpkins , a lady whose devotion to the doctrines of Mr. Ruskin was perhaps more remarkable than her artistic skill , settled her amber necklace and continued to paint . At the next easel was heard , ‘
17723	17955	17720	17721	Miss Erle	126	’ At the Central London , it will be seen , everything worked smoothly . The advent of the headmaster was the signal for general amenities . Every daub , every ill - drawn head , and every smeared , smooth drapery received its meed of praise . There were no tears , such as water the upward path of the student in a Parisian atelier ; there were no ambitions , no heart - burnings , no rivalries . No one at the Central London had ever been known to have a theory to express , or if he had , it remained locked in his own breast . It had already begun to dawn upon Mary that the whole thing was a foolish pretence at work . Slipping from her seat , she dropped back to the easel on which still stood her drawing of the Laocoon , a drawing which was beginning to assume , as it was destined to do , the appearance of a dotted engraving . She was standing , somewhat desponding and disheartened , before this thing which had cost her so much toil , and on the success of which so much depended , when the door burst open , and there appeared a radiant vision of velvet and sables , and of an audacious hat which only Alison Ives in one of her ‘
17957	17963	17720	17721	Miss Erle	126	’ fits could have invented . ‘
17968	17986	17720	17721	Miss Erle	126	’ cried that young lady , descending on Mary , and forcibly removing her drawing - board ; ‘
18019	18035	17720	17721	Miss Erle	126	're driving straight back . Mother 's out there in the carriage . Come on . ’
18036	18041	18043	18043	Mary	124	‘ I ca n't , ’
18045	18054	17720	17721	Miss Erle	126	‘ I told you I could n't . I 'm
18078	18079	18145	18145	mother	1804	’ ‘
18082	18104	18145	18145	mother	1804	’ said Alison , as she found the girl 's hat and cloak , and bundled her unceremoniously into the carriage ; ‘
18112	18113	18145	18145	mother	1804	’ ‘
18136	18142	18131	18131	Mary	124	’ put in Lady Jane . ‘
18147	18151	18145	18145	mother	1804	’ said Alison . ‘
18180	18190	18191	18191	You	650	’ shouted Alison as they rattled over the stones . ‘
18217	18226	18245	18245	they	653	’ continued the girl , with a smile , ‘
18252	18253	18245	18245	they	653	’ ‘
18262	18577	18245	18245	they	653	’ said Mary with a sigh . A place where they disapproved of the Laocoon as an exercise in art seemed to her to open out a vista of delightful possibilities . LADY JANE IVES was always to be found in Portman Square at five , but to - day she had sent out cards , so that an hour later the lofty , gaunt rooms , with their faded crimson carpets , their flowery chintzes and their many mirrors , were dotted with little groups . Lady Jane disliked new fashions in her house , and the general effect , in an over - luxurious age , was somewhat cheerless . The stiff , hard Guardis on the walls , in which tin gondoliers were propelling iron gondolas on a leaden lagoon , with a background of grey zinc palaces , were but faintly visible by the tentative light of the circle of candles in the quivering lustre chandelier . Between the starched lace curtains stood monster Chinese vases , swollen like vases seen in an uneasy dream . The buhl cabinets had chilly marble tops ; the rosewood tables held vast photograph albums . Lady Jane had arranged the rooms on her marriage some forty years ago , and it had not occurred to her to change them . Parliament had just opened ; so that people were back in town . Here and there a man 's black coat was visible . There was a subdued murmur of talk . People were slipping out quietly under cover of someone else 's arrival , dropping the perfunctory smile which they had exhibited for ten minutes under the lustre chandelier , as they made their way quickly out into the portico , where a small army of grooms , with faces as drab and unemotional as their overcoats , hung about the steps . ‘
18590	18622	18578	18578	I	0	’ drawled a pretty woman to Lady Jane , as she stood , in the swaggering attitude which she affected on entering a drawing - room , just at the door . ‘
18633	18638	18626	18626	you	542	’ declared her hostess ; ‘
18650	18683	18626	18626	you	542	’ Alison , assisted by Mary , was pouring out tea in the gaunt back drawing - room . It was noticeable that most of the men had collected round the table . ‘
18705	18710	18684	18684	I	0	’ announced Lady Jane . ‘
18735	18736	18728	18729	Lady Blaythewaite	160	’ ‘
18746	18862	18728	18729	Lady Blaythewaite	160	’ sighed a sentimental attaché of vague Slav nationality , who was famous for turning compliments out of the most unlikely materials . And Mary Erle , in her black clothes , sat on one side and looked at the little comedy with impartial eyes . It seemed so long since she had been in society ; she supposed she was out of touch with the world . Vanity Fair , since she had left it for so many months , seemed curiously foolish . Close to her , the pretty woman , who stood sipping her tea amid an admiring circle of black coats , had already got on one of her favourite topics . ‘
18878	18905	18728	18729	Lady Blaythewaite	160	’ she announced in a penetrating voice , and with the air of one who is accustomed to have her least brilliant observations received with attention ; ‘
18925	18931	18941	18941	he	664	'm off on the 31st . ’
18948	18953	18941	18941	he	664	‘ All very well , ’
19004	19011	19012	19012	he	664	‘ all very well for ladies , ’
19016	19055	19012	19012	he	664	‘ but how on earth is a feller to go away in December if he wants to get any huntin'—what ? Why , the Duchess said the other night when I told her I was n't goin' — — ’
19109	19111	19128	19132	The exquisitely clean young man	668	‘ Plumpton ’
19173	19189	19190	19190	he	668	‘ I do n't remember the name of the piece , do n't you know , ’
19193	19257	19190	19190	he	668	‘ but we saw it the night before last at the Criterion — I think it must have been the Criterion , because we dined in the restaurant first — and the feller I liked awfully , do n't you know , was the one who played the feller who kicks out the Johnnie in the third act . Awfully good , what ? ’
19258	19276	19278	19280	the pretty woman	2159	‘ Oh , yes . Awfully good — wasn't he ? We all thought him a dear , ’
19294	19298	19292	19292	she	2159	‘ intellectual conversation . ’
19299	19313	19315	19316	Lady Jane	131	‘ What have you done with that charming Mr. Hemming , my dear ? ’
19348	19432	19344	19344	she	131	‘ You 've sent him off to India , you naughty child , and he may die of the cholera or heat - apoplexy , and then you 'll be sorry . Poor fellow , he looked so terribly cut - up . He came to see me just before he went . His father was an old flame of mine . But the men were more enterprising when I was young . They did n't take “ no ” for an answer . ’
19433	19440	19442	19442	Mary	124	‘ But , dear Lady Jane , ’
19444	19456	19442	19442	Mary	124	‘ I did n't give “ no ” for an answer . ’
19560	19569	19571	19572	Lady Jane	131	‘ Ah ! there is my dear doctor , ’
19577	19583	19584	19584	she	131	‘ How good of you , ’
19596	19608	19584	19584	she	131	‘ to find time to come and see an old woman . ’
19953	19958	19959	19959	she	128	‘ By the by , ’
19986	20024	19959	19959	she	128	‘ I want you particularly to know Mary Erle — Professor Erle 's daughter . Of course you 've met her , but I want you to know her . She 's one of my few friends . ’
20037	20045	20046	20046	she	128	‘ Here 's Mr. Bosanquet - Barry , ’
20065	20082	20046	20046	she	128	‘ one of mother 's young friends . He 's the new editor of the Comet . ’
20083	20087	20089	20089	Mary	124	‘ The editor , ’
20120	20135	20110	20110	his	178	‘ The editor of the Comet ? Why , he looks a mere boy . ’
20137	20181	20188	20188	Mary	124	’ My dear , he 's seven - and - twenty . Besides , that 's the new idea in journalism . You pluck your editor nice and hot from Oxford — someone who has none of the old hackneyed Fleet Street ideas . ’
20182	20186	20188	20188	Mary	124	‘ This one , ’
20191	20204	20188	20188	Mary	124	‘ does n't look as if he had any ideas at all . ’
20205	20263	20188	20188	Mary	124	‘ Oh I but then he 's devoted to the Primrose League — and mother . He goes to her Happy Afternoons . I hear that all the smart set are in love with him — if that 's any recommendation . Mary , you must be introduced . You 'll have to know these people if you 're
20270	20365	20267	20268	an artist	378	’ On closer inspection Mr. Bosanquet - Barry turned out to have a somewhat spurious air of youth . The effect of extreme juvenility was produced by his fair skin , his dazzlingly white teeth , and his piercingly blue eyes . He entertained Mary , as he got her a cup of tea , with a spirited account of a visit to a minor music - hall , which he and a pale - faced boy with tired eyelids and an exaggerated button - hole had arranged the night before for Lady Blaythewaite . ‘
20372	20380	20267	20268	an artist	378	’ said Mr. Bosanquet - Barry confidentially , ‘

20453	20458	20460	20460	Mary	124	‘ How very unpleasant , ’
20481	20484	20464	20464	she	124	‘ Oh , ’
20500	20536	20486	20489	Mr. Bosanquet - Barry	179	‘ I do n't believe she minded — I should n't wonder if she rather liked it . At any rate , she should n't wear such outrageous clothes . I wonder Sir Horace — — ’
20537	20546	20548	20552	the pale - faced boy	704	‘ Oh , Sir Horace does n't care , ’
20571	20573	20565	20565	he	704	‘ Beaufy ’
20575	20592	20599	20599	his	704	‘ Sir Horace does n't care , he do n't pay for them , you know . ’

20668	20670	20665	20665	Alison	128	‘ I 'm
20735	20740	20732	20733	Dr. Strange	178	’ continued the girl . ‘
20743	20750	20732	20733	Dr. Strange	178	’ he answered with a smile , ‘
20795	20796	20797	20797	I	0	’ ‘
20801	20805	20797	20797	I	0	’ laughed Alison , ‘

20831	20848	20863	20865	an interesting woman	716	’ put in the pretty woman , emerging suddenly from a flirtation with the sentimental Slav , ‘
20857	20858	20863	20865	an interesting woman	716	’ ‘
20871	20905	20866	20867	Lady Blaythewaite	160	’ whispered Mr. Beaufort Flower into the ear of a solemn man with a heavy jaw , who was well - connected , and who was understood to write essays in Addisonian English . ‘
20908	20923	20866	20867	Lady Blaythewaite	160	’ ejaculated the solemn man , with a thoughtful glance at the pretty woman . ‘
20931	20948	20866	20867	Lady Blaythewaite	160	’ chat- tered the other , gazing at her with weary , half - closed eyes , ‘
20952	20958	20866	20867	Lady Blaythewaite	160	're generally so shockingly censorious . ‘
20968	20975	20965	20965	I	0	’ rejoined the solemn man deliberately , ‘
20984	20985	20965	20965	I	0	’ ‘
20989	21003	20965	20965	I	0	’ exclaimed the pretty woman , who had heard part of the answer , ‘
21034	21089	21027	21027	you	720	’ And sweeping away among her rustling silk petticoats the complimentary Slav , Lady Blaythewaite 's tiny head and wide shoulders were seen descending the staircase . There was a pause . Most of the people were leaving . From the open hall door came the click of closing carriage - doors , the word ‘
21091	21120	21027	21027	you	720	’ pronounced in the official voice of the unemotional grooms , and the sound of departing wheels . Dr. Dunlop Strange was bending towards Alison , talking earnestly . ‘

21174	21199	21151	21151	His	181	‘ So nice and old - fashioned , are n't they ? Should you say early Victorian now , or late William the Fourth ? ’
21270	21274	21275	21275	he	181	‘ Good gracious ! ’
21287	21302	21275	21275	he	181	‘ How pert ! I do n't believe she 's a débutante after all . ’
21455	21459	21448	21448	he	308	‘ little girl . ’
21629	21634	21682	21682	she	124	‘ Search the Scriptures ; ’
21823	21891	22015	22015	I	0	‘ The old three hundred sixty - fiveDull days to every year aliveOld toil , old care , old worthless treasures , Old gnawing sorrows , swindling pleasures , The cards were shuffled to and fro , The hands may vary somewhat so , The dirty pack 's the same we knowPlayed with long thousand years ago;Played with and lost with still by Man — Fate marked them '
21897	22012	22015	22015	I	0	’ Ah , she could afford to be pessimistic in those days ! As Mary took off her hat and threw her cloak on the narrow bed , hastening her toilet for the evening because of the bitter cold of the room , she repeated these lines softly to herself ; oddly enough , they evoked an image of that pretty bygone bedroom , of a tent - bed with gay draperies , a fire blazing against a background of Dutch tiles , on which blue ships in full sail were scudding over stiff curly waves , of soft mats of white fur on which it was a joy to tread with bare feet . ‘
22025	22295	22298	22298	her	747	’ thought the girl , as she went into the other room . The fire was nearly out , but two gas - burners , which had been lighted by the maid - of - all - work , and left on at full tap , had already loaded the air with the fumes of gas . It was now a quarter past six ; she could not ask for tea , although her throat burned and her head ached . No , she must wait for dinner , her modest little dinner , which was served , with variations as to punctuality , about seven o'clock . Mary threw herself on to the hard sofa , and her eyes travelled round the room . The furniture was old , shabby , and pretentious . She had an idea that there were cheap Landseer engravings on the wall , but Mary had made up her mind never to look at the pictures ; otherwise , she said , she would have had to change her lodgings at once , and that she did not wish to do , as the landlady was an old servant of theirs , and would look after her better than a stranger . After all , the place would do well enough as a makeshift . It was best , she thought , not to accept invitations from friends , but to begin to live her own life . On days like to - day , when she was weary and disheartened , Mary found it necessary to repeat this phrase in her mind : ‘
22302	22335	22298	22298	her	747	’ For it was all dispiriting enough . Art and artists , as exemplified in the Central London , were but doubtfully alluring ; Mary wondered if anywhere else she might find the ‘
22337	22924	22015	22015	I	0	’ atmosphere of which she had read so much . But anyhow her Academy drawing was done ; it had gone in with a dozen others , and to - morrow she would know if she had succeeded . She lay like a log on the hard sofa , while the gilt clock with the hovering cupid slowly ticked out three - quarters of an hour . On the mantel - piece a long photograph of Alison , in an evening gown , exhibiting a good deal of a fine arm and shoulder , was supported by a large one of Vincent Hemming , with his grave expression , and wearing an orchid in his button - hole . At last came dinner , heralded by an odour of boiled potatoes and frizzling meat . But the girl was too tired to eat the badly - cooked food ; she pushed away the steak , which was tough and hard , and tried to drink some of the small bottle of stout , which was flat , with a strange flavour . Mary rebuked herself for these fantasies of the appetite ; it behoved a young woman who wished to make her way in the world and compete with men to indulge in no such over - niceties . But a very feminine backache overcame her , and presently the maid - of - all - work , in creaking boots , removed with much clattering the dishes , and Mary was left alone with the firelight for a companion . The photographs of her two friends looked down on her from the mantelpiece ; Alison , with her capable expression and her distinguished air ; Vincent Hemming , with his showily intellectual forehead , his weak mouth , and the slight frown which he sometimes affected . What a long time it seemed since they had said good - bye , first on that long summer day which they had spent at Haslemere , and finally at Tilbury , when the great P. and 0 . steamer had been swallowed up in the greyness of the wide river and tearful sky . Yes , a long time ; but he had grown more to her in his absence than he had ever been , even at the last , for Mary was of the order of women who idealise the absent . Oddly enough , Vincent , pacing the deck of the Sutlej in his flapping ulster and his soft felt hat ( he was not one of those people who look their best in travelling costume ) , had seemed more of a stranger than the man whose letters , arriving by the Indian mail , lay beside her plate every Monday morning . She remembered with a smile how fussy he had been about his luggage , and how humiliated she had felt when , man - like , Vincent Hemming had insisted on a last embrace , and , drawing her into his cabin , had shut the door in the face of the steward . She had dwelt a great deal on those last moments . He had seemed so passionately attached to her ; the whole affair , though it had been obliged to remain vague , had become a solemn fact in her existence . A letter from Vincent had arrived that morning ; Mary felt in her pocket for the thin , crackling envelope bearing the post - mark ‘
22927	22980	22015	22015	I	0	’ It was a peculiarity of Hemming 's that one , and sometimes two , pages of his letters were indited in a flowing hand , while the rest of the paper was covered with uncertain upright hieroglyphics , which took all the reader 's patience and good - will to decipher . ‘
22984	23223	23224	23224	Mary	124	’ ( it began)—‘My delightful roamings have been brought to a standstill in this ancient and historic spot , one so eminently suited to the special studies which I desire , in furtherance of my scheme , to make . You will , I am sure , be delighted to hear that on all hands I have had every civility and courtesy extended to me from officials of every class , and that my father 's name alone has been a sufficient introduction for me , in those circles in which it is most desirable for the purpose I have in hand to move . You will also , my dear Mary , be rejoiced to hear that my health has vastly improved since my departure from England ; the fact alone that I anticipate with pleasure the advent of breakfast will give you a fair idea of my improved state of health , and I think I may say that , considering the somewhat trying nature of the climatic conditions , my appearance has wonderfully improved . But enough of my- self . I need not say that I am delighted to hear that you are bravely and earnestly attacking those art studies which , with due application , will ensure you fame , and possibly wealth , and which will , my dearest girl , be no mean factor in our ( possible ) future happiness . ’
23259	23262	23227	23227	she	124	‘ Had I ’
23268	23415	23227	23227	she	124	‘ no dreams , no aspirations for the amelioration of the English race — were I , in short , a man to whom personal happiness is paramount — I might have spoken more decisively in relation to a possible future together before I left England . But I am paying you no mean compliment , my dear Mary , when I tell you that I have every confidence that in you , as in myself , questions of vast importance rise superior to mere selfish considerations , and that in you , above all women , I have a sympathetic sharer alike of my ambitions , dreams , and hopes . It is above all in studying the marvellous system of government of a vast aggregation of human beings of divers nationalities , of such widely - differing ethical standards as this great Indian Empire — ’
24136	24184	24441	24442	the Dorothys	194	' the mounds of golden oranges , crimson apples , and scarlet tomatoes flamed with startling assurance against the blurred , brownish - grey of the houses , the pavement , the very atmosphere . She was curiously alive , now , to effects of colour , to ‘
24186	24304	24305	24305	I	0	’ ; everywhere the girl saw a possible picture . If she had passed , Mary made up her mind she would telegraph to Vincent . It would be an extravagance , but it would make him so happy . Mary pictured her lover reading that charming message from over the seas , as he sat in an Indian verandah in a white flannel suit , with a hazy background of punkahs and date palms . Afterwards , when she thought of that day , she remembered that the hall of the art school was full of students , all talking at once . At the sight of the girl 's expectant face someone called out goodnaturedly , ‘
24309	24316	24308	24308	you	775	're in , Miss Erle . I 'm
24340	24422	24427	24427	She	775	’ Mary slid into the little room without a word . Yes , there was the list of successful probationers , written in Mr. Sanderson 's careful hand on a slip of notepaper , and pinned up with a brass drawing pin over the mantelpiece . Her eye ran hastily along the list—‘Simpkins , Dorothy Muriel ; Smith , Mary Gwendo]en ; Walsh , Joseph Frederick ; Billington , George Francis ; Thomson , Pamela Evelyn ; Beadle , Reginald Forsyth . ’
24690	24698	24671	24671	he	173	‘ by the skin of its teeth . ’

25100	25160	25092	25092	you	801	’ Mary laughed . There was not much doubt about the fact that Mr. Perry Jackson was destined to get on . He had an astonishing facility in painting ; in the summer time he worked at vast canvases , out of doors , in the country , painting with large square brushes , in the approved modern manner . ‘
25169	25234	25163	25163	I	0	’ said Perry , detaining the girl with a look as she stood putting her painting things together . There was something of despair in the way in which Mary was folding up her easel , and arranging her chalks and paint - brushes in the long tin box , and with his quick sympathy the young man wished to assuage her sickening disappointment . ‘
25239	25269	25281	25281	he	802	’ he continued , pulling from a cardboard portfolio an Indian - ink drawing of a beautiful young woman in a ball - dress reading a love - letter . ‘

25662	25666	25657	25657	I	0	’ said Mary . ‘
25813	25856	25795	25795	she	816	' thought I , here 's “ High Art . ” There 's nothing good enough for this chap but Rossetti , and Burne - Jones , and Watts . And in the drawing - room it was just the same — — ’
25857	25868	25870	25870	Mary	124	‘ But did n't you know then whom it was ? ’
25874	25882	25870	25870	Mary	124	‘ No , blessed if I did ! ’
25887	25956	25884	25885	Mr. Jackson	173	‘ And so this Mr. Somervail comes in . “ Oh , good evening , ” says he , without any more ceremony than that . “ Have you brought the rough sketches for my story ? ” “ No , ” I said , “ I have n't , ” I said , just imitating his off - hand manner , “ because you would n't have understood 'em
25962	25963	25967	25967	you	173	’ ‘
25970	25974	25967	25967	you	173	’ said Mary , ‘
25989	25990	25991	25991	Nary	206	’ ‘
26038	26039	26028	26030	a precious fool	819	’ ‘
26044	26068	26028	26030	a precious fool	819	’ said Mary , who remembered the great art critic at dinner - parties , exhibiting his culture , with a modest air , ‘
26078	26083	26084	26084	I	0	’ Perry looked uneasy . ‘
26087	26093	26084	26084	I	0	’ he suggested , genially , ‘
26124	26230	26114	26114	he	207	’ At that instant a tumult of voices behind the curtain made further conversation impossible . A girl 's shrill scream was suddenly audible , and then , the next second , the heavy crash of a falling plaster cast rent the momentary silence . Shouts , exclamations , and inextinguishable laughter , mingled with the sound of scurrying feet , followed . An untoward gaiety was evidently illumining the usual routine of the school . As Mary , gathering up her things , passed through into the large studio , a boy 's raucous voice raised the joyous , but somewhat incongruous refrain : — ‘
26247	26333	26241	26243	The pore girl	822	’ — a quotation which may or may not have had reference to the now triumphant probationer , Miss Simpkins , who , with heightened colour and agitated mien , was bending over the many fragments of the shattered Laocoon , which lay strewn about the floor . The rest of the day , it would seem , was to be devoted to celebrating the admittance of Messrs. Walsh , Billington , and Beadle to the Royal Academy Schools , for , scared at Miss Simpkins '

26500	26528	26487	26487	he	826	‘ I do n't care a rap for your blooming Academy . Come on , you fellows . I 'll show you who 's the best man ! ’
26883	26888	26892	26892	she	124	‘ fetch the public . ’
27149	27156	27171	27174	the office - boy	857	‘ Editor 's Room — Private . ’
27304	27313	27315	27316	the editor	2182	‘ Professor Erle 's daughter , I believe ? ’
27329	27332	27315	27316	the editor	2182	‘ Yes . ’
27333	27356	27315	27316	the editor	2182	‘ Ah ! We were able to make use of your story , though it was not quite up to the mark . ’
27357	27359	27315	27316	the editor	2182	‘ I 'm
27362	27366	27315	27316	the editor	2182	’ began Mary . ‘
27373	27384	27315	27316	the editor	2182	’ went on the editor , without noticing the interruption , ‘
27436	27684	27706	27707	Miss Erle	126	’ And with not a suspicion of the ambiguity of his compliment , the editor rummaged in his desk for some missing object . Mary 's heart fell . Was her story as bad as all that , she wondered ? She was aware that , from a literary point of view , such praise was worse than blame . In the pause which followed she had leisure to look round furtively . And so this was the office of a big weekly newspaper ? The walls , once painted a kind of pea - green , were dim with soot , and adorned only with a map of London on a roller ; on the floor was stretched a grimy , threadbare carpet . A bluish gas - fire hissed in a narrow , black mantelpiece , and through the encrusted grime of the window - panes appeared the tall brick houses of the opposite side of the Strand . A long procession of omnibuses rattled by continually , and she could see the tops of the hats of those who sat on the outside . The sole furniture of the room consisted of a bureau with pigeon - holes , and three chairs , covered in cracked maroon - coloured leather , whose legs partook of that especial curliness which was in high fashion in 1860 . Meanwhile the editor had found his cheque - book , and , tearing out a leaf , wrote : ‘
27702	27703	27706	27707	Miss Erle	126	’ ‘
27721	27769	27770	27771	A gentleman	2106	’ Mary took the cheque with a heightened colour and a beating heart . It was the first money she had ever earned . This was the beginning . A tinkling of the electric bell was heard , and the office - boy put in his head . ‘
27778	27779	27770	27771	A gentleman	2106	’ ‘
27783	27784	27785	27785	Drorings	208	’ ‘
27789	27790	27787	27787	sir	1673	’ ‘
27795	27799	27787	27787	sir	1673	’ Mary rose . ‘
27807	27868	27804	27805	Miss Erle	126	’ A long , shambling youth , whose face seemed swollen with the toothache , shuffled in , carrying a portfolio of sketches . Not a word passed . It was a strange little scene . The shambling youth stood nervously twisting his shabby pot - hat in his fingers as the editor rapidly ran his eye over the drawings . ‘
27871	27889	27804	27805	Miss Erle	126	’ he said , re - tying the strings and handing back the portfolio over the desk . ‘
27901	27920	27804	27805	Miss Erle	126	’ and he waved his pen towards the door . In another instant the aspiring artist was gone . ‘
27926	27934	27804	27805	Miss Erle	126	‘ muttered the large , melancholy man . ‘
27941	27942	27804	27805	Miss Erle	126	’ ‘
27946	27957	27943	27944	Poor boy	528	’ said Mary , who had seen his disappointed face . ‘
27960	27967	27804	27805	Miss Erle	126	’ rejoined the editor , frowning ; ‘
27983	28008	28009	28009	We	874	’ and apparently with an eye to that section of it which had sat at the feet of Professor Erle , he added abruptly , ‘
28025	28026	28022	28023	Miss Erle	126	’ ‘
28032	28036	28030	28030	you	878	’ said Mary , ‘
28044	28498	28499	28500	The editor	2182	’ and , treading on air , she made her way out , followed by the now admiring glance of the office - boy , who was not accustomed to see people detained in the editorial sanctum so long . The girl was inordinately proud of her cheque for two guineas . How much better , after all , than stippling eternally at the Discobolus — for it was the Discobolus this time , with which she was to try her fate at the Academy schools — in the dubious atmosphere of the art school . The story had taken four days to write . There were three hundred and sixty - five days in a year , so that by writing a story or an article every four days she could earn something like two hundred a year ! And what lots of papers there were ! Fleet Street was full of them . They lurked up alleys and in quaint little squares at the back . Here they were : The Daily Telegraph , The Observer , The Graphic , The Illustrated London News . Why should she not walk in and demand some work to do ? The idea was fearfully alluring . She passed a poster of Illustrations , with the name of her story in bright blue print , and Mary stood still and read it over and over again with a quickened pulse , until she was pushed aside by the tide of human beings eddying along the street . But at present , she recollected , she had to find The Fan . After many inquiries , Mary found that the office was located in a huge building in one of the queer little squares out of Fleet Street , and that it was only one of many magazines and newspapers published by the same firm . It proved to be a little world in itself , this vast bee - hive , for the printing , publishing , and editing of some dozen magazines and journals were all conducted on the premises . There was a deafening whirr of machinery which reminded the girl vaguely of international exhibitions , and at every turn she saw an editor 's room , with the name of the journal printed in fat , assertive black type . She was wafted down long corridors of frosted glass — frosted glass , it seemed to Mary , was inseparably connected with journalism — until she was shown into a small room containing a bare , mahogany table , three chairs , and a framed lithograph of a young person in pink muslin , ogling the spectator over a diaphanous fan . ‘
28502	28518	28519	28520	the editor	2182	’ said the man in a kind of commissionaire 's uniform , who accompanied her , ‘
28532	28656	28528	28528	you	881	’ And Mary waited . In the next room she could hear , in a muffled way , the voices of that functionary and his visitor . The business , it would seem , on which they were engaged was of a somewhat hilarious nature , for frequent guffaws of laughter reached her , and there was an unmistakable odour of cigarettes . Ten minutes , fifteen minutes , twenty minutes went slowly by . The murmur of voices , the baritone laughter in the next room , continued to be audible . At last , when Mary had finally made up her mind to go , the door was flung open , and a young man with a high colour stumbled out . ‘
28676	28694	28669	28669	you	881	’ and , bestowing on Mary a prolonged stare , he disappeared down the long glass corridor . ‘
28701	28800	28696	28696	you	881	’ said a rather affected voice , and Mary , walking into the editorial sanctum , found herself opposite a well - dressed , supercilious - looking young man of thirty , a man who curiously resembled all the young men whom she used to see in the Park on fine mornings . Something like a blush darkened his smooth cheeks as Mary entered , and the editor of The Fan raised a pious prayer to the gods that this apparently inexperienced girl had not heard the conversation which had been going on for the last twenty minutes . ‘
28809	28836	28801	28801	I	0	’ he said lamely , glancing for the first time at the card and letter , which had been waiting at his elbow on the table , ‘
28862	28863	28849	28849	He	884	’ ‘
28868	28875	28864	28864	I	0	’ replied Mary a little stiffly , ‘
28882	28883	28864	28864	I	0	’ ‘
28894	28920	28864	28864	I	0	're frightfully “ rushed”—especially just now , at the middle of the month . We come out , you see , on the 23d . I 'm

28974	28977	28979	28979	Mary	124	‘ Indeed ? ’
29047	29051	29053	29053	Mary	124	‘ I came , ’
29055	29074	29053	29053	Mary	124	‘ to ask — to ask if you thought there was anything I could do for The Fan . ’
29109	29145	29080	29080	his	889	‘ The fact is , we are inundated with stuff which is n't any good to us . We are refusing stuff every day . What we want would n't be in your line , I 'm

29197	29301	29347	29347	his	2182	' papers have got : “ Mrs. Townley Tompkins gave a most successful ball at her beautiful house in Lancaster Gate , or any of those God - forsaken places . Lady Jane Ives , Lady Blaythewaite — those are the sort of people . Really smart , do n't you know , and the vieile souche as well . Now , I should have liked a smartly written account of Lady Jane Ives 's party the other night . Of course , I knew lots of people there , but they have n't got the cacoëthes scribendi , do n't you know ? ’
29302	29318	29320	29320	Mary	124	‘ I think I could do you that , if you thought it interesting enough , ’
29322	29330	29320	29320	Mary	124	‘ as I happened to be there . ’
29331	29338	29340	29341	the editor	2182	‘ Oh , you were there ? ’
29366	29413	29363	29363	he	2182	‘ It 's possible we might arrange something ; in fact , we might begin something this month . We might manage an article for the next number — something smart , you know , and just a wee bit malicious . We 'll call the thing ‘
29418	29448	29363	29363	he	2182	’ and that 'll give plenty of scope . Do n't be afraid , Miss Erle . Any gossip that has n't got into the papers , you know . ’
29449	29463	29466	29467	the editor	2182	‘ Lady Jane Ives , now , must be a very interesting acquaintance , ’
29473	29497	29498	29498	he	2182	‘ quite one of the women of the day . I wonder if you could get her to be interviewed for The Fan ? ’
29504	29510	29512	29512	Mary	124	‘ I 'll ask her , ’
29516	29533	29512	29512	Mary	124	‘ But I ought to tell you that I am not going out much this season . ’
29534	29542	29544	29545	the editor	2182	‘ Oh ! that do n't matter , ’
29548	29572	29544	29545	the editor	2182	‘ What we want is somebody who really knows the set . Little bits of gossip , do n't you know , that the ‘
29575	29589	29512	29512	Mary	124	’ ca n't possibly get hold of . Do you care to try ? ’
29590	29596	29512	29512	Mary	124	‘ I think I will . ’
29597	29649	29512	29512	Mary	124	‘ We can do with three columns a month . The firm pays a guinea a column . When may I have the pleasure of seeing your first article ? It would appear next month if you let us have it by the 20th . Thanks awfully . Good - day . ’
29752	29755	29757	29757	Alison	128	‘ SAPRISTI ! ’
29759	29781	29757	29757	Alison	128	‘ he 's come back , you say ? I think I shall insist on the marriage coming off at once . ’
29782	29789	29791	29791	Mary	124	‘ No , you wo n't , ’
29795	29810	29791	29791	Mary	124	‘ because we 've got to earn enough between us to set up house . ’

29857	29898	29899	29899	Alison	128	’ It was a sultry day at the end of July , and the two girls sat in the dingy lodgings in Bulstrode Street . Vincent Hemming had telegraphed from Liverpool ; he was to be in London that afternoon . ‘

30191	30227	30228	30228	You	542	’ murmured Mary , getting up and pushing the window wide open . There was a long silence , during which a large bumble - bee swayed in and buzzed ponderously round the little room . ‘
30232	30239	30162	30162	she	154	’ said Alison , jumping up , ‘
30266	30267	30162	30162	she	154	’ ‘

30335	30352	30162	30162	she	154	'm going to take a lot of poor girls over the National Gallery at three o'clock . ’
30353	30374	30334	30334	I	0	‘ Oh , I ca n't . It 's too far . And he might come while I was out . ’
30375	30379	30381	30381	Alison	128	‘ And considering , ’
30383	30407	30381	30381	Alison	128	‘ that you intend spending the rest of your natural existence with Mr. Hemming , that would be nothing short of a calamity . ’
30408	30428	30430	30430	Mary	124	‘ You are an unsympathetic demon , and you can be off to your East - end young women , ’
30433	30436	30438	30438	Alison	128	‘ Pooh , ’
30441	30464	30465	30465	she	128	‘ I shall stay till the last moment , and give you the benefit of my mature advice . It 's wonderful , ’
30483	30528	30465	30465	she	128	‘ how kind I am to young people . I believe I 've been making a mistake all this time . I ought to have been the mother of six boys — for Heaven forbid that I should bring another woman into the world . ’
30529	30540	30542	30542	Mary	124	‘ You would have been bored to death with them , ’
30544	30577	30578	30578	she	128	‘ Nonsense , depend upon it , I should have been a pattern parent . All we people make the mistake of doing everything more or less badly . Here are you , ’
30602	30632	30578	30578	she	128	‘ reading a ninepenny translation of Epictetus , when I 'll be bound you ca n't make a pudding properly without it “ catching”—or whatever the cook calls it . ’
30633	30652	30654	30654	Mary	124	‘ I know I ca n't ; but it 's eccentric — to say the least of it , ’
30656	30671	30654	30654	Mary	124	‘ for a young woman like you to want to make puddings at all . ’
30672	30680	30682	30682	Alison	128	‘ I suppose it is an affectation , ’
30695	30743	30682	30682	Alison	128	‘ but it 's so much more amusing than going to balls . Oh , those old club hacks who go out to exercise their livers , and the boys who dance till they stream with perspiration , because they want to make acquaintances — in society . ’
30744	30758	30760	30760	Mary	124	‘ It 's doubtfully alluring — the London ball of to - day , ’
30762	30767	30760	30760	Mary	124	‘ but why go ? ’
30768	30773	30775	30775	Alison	128	‘ I do n't , ’
30777	30796	30775	30775	Alison	128	‘ it 's what I remember out of the dim past . Well , good - bye , I 'm
30840	30857	30817	30817	Your	912	’ After she had gone , she put her head in at the door to say — ‘
30909	31342	31344	31348	that tawdry - looking girl	914	’ When the street door had finally closed , Mary felt horribly restless . After much inward debate , she put on her hat and went out . Secretly , she would have liked to go to Euston to meet her lover , but he had said nothing about it , and she thought it best to wait . So she walked to the Regent 's Park , and there , in the trim flower - garden , where the avenue of chestnuts was making long shadows on the neatly - swept paths , Mary sat down and waited . It was high midsummer now ; there was a velvety smoothness on the trim lawns , the green light filtered through a canopy of broad chestnut leaves , and the beds were odorous with heliotrope , purple with pansies , and aglow with geraniums . Half past four ! Now perhaps the train was thundering into Euston Station . Vincent Hemming was getting out of his compartment , collecting his manifold baggage , hailing a cab . London was the richer for one important person ; London contained her lover ! The people who haunt the parks on fine afternoons were there as usual , but to - day they seized her imagination . There was a young woman with restless eyes and a hard mouth , keeping a rendezvous with a lover who had not yet appeared ; a nurse or two with a swarm of children from the surrounding Georgian terraces , racing and squealing and looking like white rabbits with their pink noses and creamy boots , while , erect and military , the figure of a park - keeper in his gilt buttons and his peaked cap gave an official air to the trim paths . Yes , he was driving now to his chambers in the Temple ; passing , actually rolling on London streets , in a London cab , not so very far from where she sat . It seemed incredible , and yet it was true . The only drawback to her happiness was Jimmie , for her brother was back for the holidays , and being as yet unaware of the understanding between them , he would be sure to insist on being there when Vincent came . Mary could not picture the scene with a third person . Over yonder was the girl with the hard mouth , still pacing up and down alone . Mary felt drawn towards her ; she would like to have gone up and said something kind . ‘
31355	31364	31344	31348	that tawdry - looking girl	914	’ thought Mary , as she passed her , ‘
31385	31521	31522	31523	Poor girl	918	’ Everything , to - day , seemed imprinted on her brain ; the delicate arrangement of mauves and lilacs in the distant flower - beds ; the foolish faces of the nurses bent over a penny novelette as they pushed forward their perambulators ; but above all , the figure of the girl with the hard mouth , who was still looking from right to left , for some one who did not appear . She had sat down on a green bench opposite , her shabby boots stuck hopelessly out . Her hair was untidy ; in her hat was a dirty pink - bow ; her dark stuff gown was frayed at the edge . The woman in her was dead ; she was past the stage of caring about her appearance . ‘
31525	31529	31522	31523	Poor girl	918	’ thought Mary , ‘
31562	31913	31916	31916	dear	594	’ No , he had not come , and there was something in her blank eyes — eyes which seemed to look into an abyss , which suggested the thought that in all human probability he never would . By - and - by the nurses began to put by their tatting and gather their chattering , swooping broods together . Perambulators were pushed forward on the creaking gravel , and little white boots and gaiters were seen trotting in the direction of the shining , columned terraces . A clock on a neighbouring church struck five . And now , suddenly , Mary began to hurry . It was five o'clock ! If the express had been punctual , Vincent might be at his chambers by this . Supposing he came , and she were out ? Her heart thumping at the thought , she walked rapidly through the gates . She wanted to buy some flowers , too ; lots of flowers , to disguise the terrible ugliness of those lodgings . At a florist 's she bought an armful of roses , peonies , and tiger - lilies ; and then she almost ran home to Bulstrode Street . There were the flowers to arrange , and she would like to change her gown . Vincent did n't like black , she remembered ; she would wear the little grey dress she had just had made , and fasten some roses in her belt . At home , in the drawing - room , the interior in which she was so soon to receive her lover was not enticing . The tea - cups — common thick - lipped earthenware — were laid out on a battered tin tray ; a small glass jug contained a bluish white fluid , and a moulded glass basin was half filled with dubious looking lumps of sugar . And to complete the picture , Jimmie had apparently taken a seat for the afternoon at the table , and only raised his head from a novel to clamour for his tea . ‘
31920	31967	31968	31968	I	0	’ said Mary , hastily filling all the available bowls and vases with flowers . What could she do with the boy ? she wondered , as she ran into her bedroom , put on the grey gown , and pinned some roses at her waist . ‘
31973	31982	31968	31968	I	0	’ said Jimmie , banging at the door , ‘

32006	32022	31997	31998	old Hemming	129	’ said Mary faintly , still pondering what she could do with her young brother . ‘
32031	32134	32135	32135	Jimmie	185	’ It was past six now ; he probably would come after dinner . That would be very nice — they would have a beautiful long evening . The rooms , too , did not look quite so dreadful at night . She had brought a small copper lamp , with a rose - coloured shade , in expectation of Vincent 's arrival , so that those dreadful milky glass gas - globes would not have to be lighted . And then she had an idea . It was an extravagance which she would not have permitted herself , but then — — ‘
32137	32182	32135	32135	Jimmie	185	’ she called out , as she stood at the looking - glass , her hands trembling as she tried to fasten the over - blown roses at her waist , while one by one the petals fell away and left a bare stalk . ‘

32234	32278	32228	32229	Smith major	926	’ She opened a drawer and took out her purse . There were ten shillings left out of her last cheque . Four shillings had been spent on flowers , but there was enough still to send the two boys to the theatre . ‘

32532	32660	32661	32661	I	0	’ And then a hunt began for the missing money . Presently it was found , and Jimmie had gone for the evening . It was very hot ; stuffy with the damp , vitiated air of a London night verging on August . Few people passed . Bulstrode Street is a quiet thoroughfare . Once , about eight o'clock , cab - wheels were audible , and then Mary shrank into the farthest corner of the room , clasping her little hands tight , and listening for the sound of the door - bell and that well - known step on the stair . But neither came . The cab drove on , having emptied its fare two doors off . It was nine o'clock now . ‘
32669	32674	32661	32661	I	0	’ thought the girl . ‘
32748	32958	32961	32961	I	0	’ Half - past nine now . Still he might come . He would have dined at his club , in all probability , and he would come on , after exchanging gossip with the men he would meet . Mary lighted the copper lamp now , and placed the pink shade over it . How pretty the flowers looked ! Only the roses at her belt were faded . Going into the next room , she pinned in a fresh bunch . A quarter to ten ? He would hardly come now ; he always had a nice eye to the proprieties . But his cab might have broken down ; he might have been detained at the club . The march up and down the room continued . Mary never knew how much she walked that night . The long , empty hours seemed interminable . But at last , in the still , sultry air , she could hear Big Ben strike eleven . Oh , eleven ! Then it was all over ; she might as well take off the pretty grey dress , unpin the bunch of roses . At half - past eleven Jimmie returned , full of the delights of the play . ‘
32972	33017	32971	32971	I	0	'm so jolly hungry , darling ! Ca n't you get me something to eat ? It was sweet and dear of you to send me to the theatre . But , I say , where 's old Hemming ? Has n't he been ? ’
33018	33027	33029	33029	Mary	124	‘ I have n't seen anything of him , ’

33267	33279	33281	33281	Mary	124	‘ And did you have a good passage across the Atlantic ? ’
33362	33396	33351	33351	She	124	‘ Fairly good . Yes . I may say it was a tolerably agreeable experience . There were some pleasant people on board . And I was not troubled with sea - sickness . ’

Violet was their only child , and Elijah Higgins took occasion , one night when the smoking - room was empty , save for a select party of San Franciscans who were playing poker and emitting fantastic oaths in the midst of a cloud of smoke in a distant corner , to mention that he was prepared to settle a considerable fortune on his daughter if she chose a husband of whom he approved . Yes , old Higgins was inclined to be friendly . He had offered to be president of his committee should he think of standing for Northborough ; he had talked of heading a subscription to defray Vincent 's election expenses . He thought , on the whole , he should accept their invitation to run up north and look around him at his future constituents . One could n't put things in motion too soon , he told himself , as he crossed Trafalgar Square , and stepped down Northumberland Avenue to the Métropole . Miss Violet had had a headache , the night before , at the theatre ; it would only be civil to go and ask how she was . He had an idea they expected him , and so , it appeared , they did . They not only expected him , but they expected him to stop to dinner . The next day Mary received a note from Vincent , to the effect that he was running up north on parliamentary business , but that he hoped to see her very soon . The postscript was typical of the man : ‘
36427	36900	36983	36983	she	1019	’ A month later , Vincent was still at Northborough , and Mary , whose drawing for the Academy had again been refused , was working , all through the dog - days , at her new profession of journalist . IT was a bright October morning , and the light of mid - day fell searchingly on the pictures in their garish new frames . Scotch mountain streams , eastern bazaars , young ladies reading love - letters , fishermen mending nets , ran promiscuously up the walls to the very cornice , or modestly hung on a level with the boots of the spectator . Everywhere was the obvious , the threadbare , the banal ; everywhere there was a frank appeal to the Philistinism of the picture - buying public . It was press day at the galleries of the Society of United Artists — the Benighted Artists , as they were called at a certain club consecrated to the fine arts — so that , for once , there was a sprinkling of people moving about the polished parquet floor . Indeed , in a distant room there was even a small crowd ; but that , it appeared , was due to the fact that a buffet , spread with a York ham , a magnificent display of bath buns , and several decanters of fiery - looking sherry , presided over by a young lady with arch manners and pendant ear - rings , had been provided to seduce the austere journalist . Sounds of hilarity , as well as whiffs of tobacco smoke , frequently penetrated to the large room where Mary Erle was taking notes . Shaggy - looking men , with wide - awake hats and Inverness capes of dubious freshness , strolled in twos out of the luncheon room , lit a cigar , took a seat on the red velvet divan in the middle of the room , making incongruous figures enough as they rested under the fronds of a giant palm , and fell to talking Fleet Street , until one or the other , producing a watch , hastily rose and shuffled downstairs . These curious proceedings on the part of a certain portion of the press aroused some astonishment in Mary . The scene was as new to her as the work ; for she had only taken the art critic 's place on the Comet during the temporary illness of that functionary . So she walked slowly , conscientiously round the room , stopping at every picture that she could possibly mention in her article , and stopping , too , before pictures which an editorial hint had advised her she would have to mention whether she liked them or no . Yonder was a yellow and blue ‘

She must find , of course , some phrase which might encourage the fair artist to go on painting editors '

39202	39276	39067	39067	I	0	’ with its delicate golden fingers . One by one the pressmen and the lady journalists had slipped away . The odour of tobacco was evaporating . Even the buffet was deserted , save for one elderly gentleman , who , as he stood talking to the presiding nymph as she washed up the glasses , leaned heavily with one elbow on the table and regarded the empty decanters with a fixed smile . ‘
39278	39288	39290	39290	Jimmie	185	'S the deuce of a wet day , dearest , ’
39303	39310	39290	39290	Jimmie	185	‘ Must you really go out ? ’
39311	39333	39335	39336	the girl	1681	‘ Yes , dear . Do n't bother . I must go directly I have done this article on Perry Jackson , ’
39372	39392	39335	39336	the girl	1681	‘ But you really do n't look the thing , darling . By the by , does Sarah know I 'm
39402	39487	39335	39336	the girl	1681	’ added Jimmie , with his newly - acquired drawl . He had shot up into a curiously pretty and precocious boy . It was characteristic of him that he addressed his sister with as much politeness as any of his numerous loves . Everybody agreed that Jimmie Erle was a delightful boy . Laudatory adjectives abounded when his name was mentioned . Just now , lounging in his cricketing blazer against the mantelpiece , he looked the picture of airy and irresponsible youth . ‘
39497	39515	39335	39336	the girl	1681	’ said Mary , laughing , blotting her MSS . , and thrusting it in an envelope , ‘
39532	39536	39649	39649	I	0	‘ Dear , you 're
39542	39543	39649	39649	I	0	’ ‘
39567	39568	39555	39555	I	0	’ ‘
39575	39648	39555	39555	I	0	’ said Jimmie vaguely . But Mary had gone into her bedroom now , and was rapidly doing up her hair , and putting on a waterproof . As she left the room there was a brief vision of her brother helping himself to a third serve of marmalade . The morning paper was at his elbow , and there was even a surreptitious box of cigarettes on the chimney - piece . ‘
39652	39668	39555	39555	I	0	’ said Mary to herself as she clattered down the staircase in her flapping waterproof , ‘
39690	40516	39678	39678	He	130	’ In the underground railway it was at any rate dry , and Mary could rest her back , tired with bending over a desk since nine o'clock . For a long time she had felt wretchedly weak . The strain of writing was intense ; there were whole mornings which she spent staring at a sheet of white paper on her desk . The only ideas she had , came at night , when she ought to have been asleep , and after hours of insomnia she would get up and go to her desk with every nerve in her body quivering . Mary told herself severely as the train rattled on its way to Kensington that she could not afford to break down now . She wanted so much to retain her position on the Fan ; if she gave it up for a month there would be a dozen women ready to snatch it from her . Then , too , she was getting on with her three - volume novel , which was to appear in Illustrations , and there was the Perry Jackson article for the same paper , over which she had taken a deal of trouble , and to finish which she was on her way to the new Associate 's house . And she smiled as she thought how amused Vincent would be to hear that she had met Perry Jackson again , and to learn that she had been chosen to write an article on The Time of Roses , and the beautiful house and studio in which the artist was now installed . And with the clarity of mental vision which is one of the first signs of ripened powers , Mary contrasted the two men : Perry with his ridiculous manners , his good heart , his stubborn determination to get on , and his curiously keen knowledge of the public ; Vincent with his smooth , charming phrases , his good looks , his vacillating nature . It was pouring rain as Mary stepped out of Kensington High Street Station . A heavy , pinkish sky lowered overhead , and the trees of Holland House took on a strange metallic hue in the changing stormy light . The end of the road was swallowed up in mist and rain , and on the streaming pavement , which reflected everything like a mirror , she could see a vision of her own umbrella hurrying along through the storm . By the time she rang the bell of Mr. Perry Jackson 's imposing house her feet were soaked through . The door was opened by an elderly person in a bonnet profusely trimmed with lilies of the valley , a lady whose dark stuff gown and bibulous eye contrasted strangely enough with the spacious white hall , with its Persian tiles , its soft , flame - coloured carpets , and its delicate , turquoise - tinted embroideries . Mr. Jackson was at home , and the lilies of the valley , with a confidential , if somewhat mysterious , air , shuffled along the discreet , silent passages , and after a tentative knock at the door , ushered Mary into the studio . The subject of her article was at work on a large canvas when she was shown in . In the vast studio , with its vista of polished boards , its golden ceiling , and its tapestry - hung walls , the artist made a somewhat insignificant figure , as he stood on a step - ladder and reached up to put in a piece of background . The gorgeous colouring of the great silent room accentuated the paleness of his features . With his profile outlined against an alcove of golden mosaics , he looked more than ever like a grown - up London street - boy , who had found his way , by mistake , into some oriental palace fashioned by superhuman hands . The wan , veiled light of a rainy day crept through the great north window , and on a small outer studio of glass — destined for out - of - door effects — the rain pattered monotonously . Palms and azaleas in giant pots repeated the enchanting note of green which was visible through the glass walls of the outer studio . The huge canvas at which he was at work represented a convent garden in the grey crepuscule of a summer evening . The pale , pensive faces of young nuns , faces of unnatural loveliness , with haunting eyes and flower - like mouths , shadowed by wide blue headdresses , were seen bending over beds of white lilies , while here and there a transparent hand was stretched to gather the passionless , immaculate flowers . This picture , destined for next year 's Academy , was to be called ‘
40522	40565	39678	39678	He	130	’ Mary was startled when she looked at it . Only a short time ago she had suggested the subject to him . He must have set to work at once , leaving everything else . The picture was already blocked in . ‘
40577	40672	40568	40568	I	0	’ cried Perry , blushing crimson . Mary observed , with some annoyance , that he had lately taken to blushing at her advent . It was ridiculous , for they had to see each other so often about the article that they had become like old friends . And she always thought of him , moreover , as the Perry Jackson of the Central London School of Art — a little man with a shock head , and whose parents , moreover , sold cheap dining - room suites in the Hampstead Road . ‘
40688	40705	40568	40568	I	0	’ said Mary , sinking into the nearest chair and surveying her damp boots with solicitude . ‘
40724	40730	40731	40731	I	0	’ said Perry , indignantly . ‘
40732	40754	40731	40731	I	0	'm blessed if you 'd know they were roses . Why , they might be — artichokes — or anything else . ’
40755	40765	40767	40767	Mary	124	‘ Well , we ca n't help that now , ’
40770	40810	40812	40812	Mary	124	‘ What I want to - day are just the last touches for my article — something to make the thing literary , with a meaning , you see . I should be glad to know , for instance , ’
40823	40830	40812	40812	Mary	124	‘ if you have a Message ? ’
40831	40836	40838	40838	Perry	173	‘ What 's that ? ’
40853	40858	40860	40860	Mary	124	‘ I have never , ’
40864	40900	40901	40901	she	124	‘ been quite able to ascertain . But nowadays most people — writers , painters , and so on — are supposed to have a Message to deliver to their contemporaries . And I thought , ’
40925	40963	40964	40964	Perry	173	‘ I thought perhaps you meant to insist , in your art , on the cult of beauty , the pagan love of form , the delight , so to speak , in a physically perfect existence ? ’
40968	40971	40972	40972	he	173	‘ Well , ’
40979	41010	41016	41016	he	173	‘ I never thought about it like that . But you can put it in that way if you like . I do n't mind what you say about me ; ’
41019	41032	41016	41016	he	173	‘ All I want to do is to make the thing pay . ’
41033	41045	41047	41047	Mary	124	‘ But , dear Mr. Jackson , it evidently does pay , ’
41051	41073	41047	41047	Mary	124	‘ here you are , “ arrived , ” with poor Mr. Madder 's beautiful house and studio all to yourself . ’
41074	41077	41079	41079	Perry	173	‘ Yes , ’
41093	41105	41106	41106	he	173	‘ all to myself . There was a lady here yesterday , ’
41113	41144	41106	41106	he	173	‘ who came to interview me for an evening paper , and what do you think she asked me ? If I was married — or going to get married . ’
41145	41150	41152	41152	Mary	124	‘ And are you ? ’
41283	41290	41291	41291	she	124	‘ I really ought to go , ’
41298	41310	41291	41291	she	124	‘ your room is much too gorgeous for a damp journalist . ’
41521	41535	41537	41537	Perry	173	‘ Is — is — there any one else that you care for ? ’
41546	41549	41550	41550	she	124	‘ Yes , ’
41597	41611	41613	41613	Perry	173	‘ Then you 'll speak about that process - block to the editor ? ’
41628	41661	41662	41662	she	124	‘ Oh , yes , of course . No doubt it can be touched up as you suggest . And that about your ideal in art will make the article much stronger , ’
42018	42034	42036	42036	Alison	128	‘ All mother 's “ boys ” will be here before the evening 's over , ’
42040	42052	42036	42036	Alison	128	‘ I do n't know whether our brains will hold out . ’
42127	42143	42145	42145	Alison	128	‘ Dr. Strange , you 've got to personally conduct us over the Whitechapel Hospital , ’
42156	42177	42145	42145	Alison	128	‘ Miss Erle wants to write something about a hospital , and you can explain the medical details to her . ’
42178	42184	42186	42187	the doctor	693	‘ When will you come ? ’
42190	42198	42200	42200	Alison	128	‘ Oh , arrange it with Mary , ’
42204	42218	42219	42222	one of the unemployed	1119	‘ these young women who write are always so busy . At present I 'm

42288	42293	42294	42295	My dear	542	’ ejaculated Lady Jane . ‘

42343	42391	42335	42337	the old woman	1123	‘ It 's because I go with the times . And as for that child Mary , I ca n't refuse her anything . You see Alison and I both wanted to marry her poor dear father . He was the most delightful creature that ever lived . ’
42505	42516	42518	42518	Beaufy	181	‘ Why are you looking so pretty to - night ? ’
42536	42542	42544	42544	Mary	124	‘ I never look pretty , ’
42547	42559	42560	42560	he	181	‘ No ? That 's true . I 've seen you , ’
42566	42583	42560	42560	he	181	‘ look positively ugly . And other times , you know , you become radiantly lovely . ’
42626	42659	42620	42620	he	181	‘ Tell me who 's here , you shocking creature . You know I ca n't see . And what are you young men there for except to tell us the news ? ’
42660	42729	42730	42730	he	1127	‘ Oh , yes . Everybody 's here . Lots of people have come up to town on purpose . No end of smart people in the stalls . And who do you think is down there in the omnibus box ? Lady Blaythewaite , of all people . C'est crâne , hein ? Three days before she has to appear in the divorce court . They say , ’
42744	42770	42734	42734	his	1127	‘ they say it will be a cause célèbre . She brings the case , of course , but she wo n't get it . They 're

42805	42828	42785	42787	that old woman	1129	’ said Lady Jane , as she surveyed the coming heroine of the divorce court exhaustively with her tortoise - shell lorgnette . ‘
42832	42840	42785	42787	that old woman	1129	’ she continued in an approving tone : ‘
42912	42913	42904	42905	Her daughter	1134	’ ‘
42930	42952	42917	42917	she	1130	’ murmured Mr. Bosanquet - Barry , and then he added , showing all his dazzling teeth in a fatuous smile : ‘
42975	42976	42970	42970	she	234	’ ‘
42987	43001	42980	42980	you	1137	’ replied Lady Jane , in her well - bred , indifferent tone . ‘
43009	43010	43003	43003	you	1137	’ ‘
43030	43031	43026	43026	she	1130	’ ‘
43034	43045	43046	43046	she	1130	’ put in Mr. Flower , in his waspish voice , ‘
43064	43065	43066	43066	My	0	’ ‘
43095	43096	43085	43093	those curious - looking persons in the next box	1141	’ ‘
43106	43116	43085	43093	those curious - looking persons in the next box	1141	’ cried that young gentleman , with some animation . ‘
43118	43156	43085	43093	those curious - looking persons in the next box	1141	're my discovery . There 's a man — a political man — in the stalls who knows . It 's the mayor of Northborough , the mayoress of Northborough , and the heiress - apparent . They 're
43199	43215	43198	43198	I	0	'm sure he wears his chains of office under his clothes . Look at the mayoress '
43290	43385	43278	43279	Lady Blay	234	’ And so these were the Higginses ; Vincent 's friends , whom he had picked up in America , and who had got him returned to parliament . Mary gave one swift , comprehensive glance at the daughter , taking in her under - bred face , with its beady eyes and fretful mouth , her over - trimmed clothes and her uneasy attitude , and remembering Hemming 's fastidious tastes , she decided , with a little throb of feminine exultation , that she had nothing to dread from Miss Violet Higgins . ‘
43395	43414	43387	43387	anybody	639	’ asked the girl in a relieved voice , in which there was even a note of happiness . ‘
43423	43424	43387	43387	anybody	639	’ ‘
43458	43471	43485	43485	Realism	236	're so adorably untrue to life , do n't you know?’opined Beaufy . ‘
43503	43504	43495	43495	I	0	’ ‘
43513	44058	44059	44060	My husband	1151	’ said Alison , turning suddenly round . Dr. Dunlop Strange had caught sight of Lady Blaythewaite in the box opposite , and his eyes seemed riveted on her exquisite face . Somehow the fact annoyed her ; Alison did not like Lady Blaythewaite . The curtain drew up on the second act , revealing a rose - clambered cottage and a sundial . The play proceeded after the manner of love - stories which are enacted to lime - light . Two sets of lovers — one arch , one sentimental — wandered through a wicket - gate in rotation , though during the scene between the arch lovers — in which a watering - pot and some artificial geraniums played a prominent part — it was noticeable that some of the habitual theatre - goers began a mumbled conversation . It was unmistakable , however , that the interest of the dress - circle was aroused when a rising moon illuminated the embrace of the sentimental lovers , during which the ominous figure of an adventuress was seen hovering behind a hedge . The critics , however , began to yawn , and several cheery conversations were started in private boxes , notably in that of Lady Blaythewaite , whose white shoulders were detached with startling distinctness against a phalanx of black coats . The door of the Higgins 's box down below opened , and there was visible the figure of a youngish man against the pale gold of the corridor . Mary could not see his face , which was black against the light ; but in another instant the new - comer , after shaking hands all round , had slipped into the chair behind the younger lady , and his face was now illuminated by the glare of the footlights . Miss Higgins began to fan herself violently with a jerky movement , and fidgeted about in her chair . Mary 's eyes were riveted on the face of the new arrival . Just where she sat he could not see her . It was Vincent Hemming . Then she turned her eyes away — as if ashamed — and kept them fixed upon the stage . The sentimental lovers were now swearing eternal fidelity .... Were they the real puppets , Mary wondered , or she , and Vincent , and Miss Higgins , and the Blaythewaites , each pulled this way and that by their passions , their ambitions , their desires ? Vincent was in town , and she had heard nothing from him ! True , she had not had many letters of late , but then he had been , of course , immersed in his election business . She had not expected to hear . And yet , why should he spend his first night in town with these people ? Vincent , too , must have got the box ; it was evidently his party , for the mayor of a provincial town , however many times a millionaire , is not on the lists for first - nights at fashionable theatres in London . On the stage Mary was conscious that the adventuress was advancing to the footlights murmuring the words ‘
44062	44141	44059	44059	My	0	’ and that the curtain was falling on the second act . She sat with her eyes fixed on her lap . Every nerve in her body was drawn at full tension . It was a relief when the canvas door opened , and one or two men came in . She leaned back in her chair , saying anything , so as not to have to think . Beaufy had slipped again into the chair behind her . ‘
44153	44157	44144	44144	you	1152	’ he began . ‘
44215	44216	44218	44218	he	129	’ ‘
44220	44258	44218	44218	he	129	’ said Mary , and she was astonished to find how natural her voice sounded . After all , she told herself , she knew how it would be on the day of his return from America . ‘
44373	44384	44365	44365	she	1159	’ he concluded in his most malicious and triumphant tone . ‘
44387	44556	44365	44365	she	1159	’ said Mary , raising her eyelids , and letting them drop again with a tired gesture . Fortunately no one in the box had heard but herself . Both Lady Jane and Alison were talking to new arrivals . She made an effort — an effort which completely prostrated her next day — to look smiling , calm , imperturbable . Why , the very fabric of society was based on that acquiescent feminine smile . She , like other women before her , must learn her fate with the eyes of the world fixed curiously upon her .... If she could only creep away somewhere , hide her face , not see the hideous comedy going on in the box down there , not have to look at the yellow footlights , watch the foolish , inane , unreal comedy on the stage . But she could not leave the theatre without making a scene , having explanations . The curtain rose on the last act . ‘
44565	44682	44562	44563	Miss Higgins	217	’ she said to herself deliberately , as the arch pair of lovers entered , quarrelling , in a pretty drawing - room set . She tried to realise this new calamity ; to understand what it meant to her , as the comic young gentleman on the stage essayed to appease the arch young lady 's wrath by tying an errant shoe - lace . Vincent and Miss Higgins .... Vincent and Miss Higgins : living together , always together ; husband and wife in all the long , long years to come.—'For better , for worse , for richer , for poorer , in sickness and in health , till death did them part . ’
44757	44765	44767	44767	Alison	128	‘ Dear , you look dreadfully white , ’
44800	44802	44786	44788	Mr. Beaufort Flower	180	‘ I 'm
44805	44825	44767	44767	Alison	128	're tired . The play bored one horribly , did n't it ? And the theatre 's so hot — ’
44826	44828	44767	44767	Alison	128	‘ I 'm
44832	44837	44767	44767	Alison	128	’ said Mary heroically . ‘
44842	45010	44767	44767	Alison	128	’ People spoke to her as she went downstairs and along the corridor , and she answered them with pale , mauvish lips . Such a charming , pretty piece , was n't it ? Quite an idyll , and so wholesome , after this disgusting talk about heredity , and so on .... It was quite a relief , they said , to get a thoroughly English piece with a happy ending . And in the pushing crowd at the door her lover almost brushed her elbow as he passed her unwittingly with the Lancashire heiress . The girl , Mary could see , wore the triumphant expression of the underbred young woman who has secured a desirable husband . Mary hardly dared look at Vincent , though every fibre in her body yearned towards him ; but as he passed out , with Miss Higgins leaning heavily on his arm , she had a brief vision of a harassed , sheepish , and uneasy face . ‘
45017	45069	44767	44767	Alison	128	’ she thought , with a pang . IN the professional solemnity of the consulting - room , the large , bland face of Dr. Danby looked grave . Tapping his stethoscope , with which he had just made an examination of Mary , he looked her straight in the eyes . ‘
45128	45136	45119	45119	I	0	’ he added thoughtfully , pronouncing the word ‘
45138	45155	45119	45119	I	0	’ with a certain unction , as an attribute which applied mostly to charming young women . ‘
45166	45171	45119	45119	I	0	’ he went on , ‘
45204	45211	45212	45212	You	1170	’ continued the doctor , frowning . ‘
45270	45280	45266	45268	A mere girl	1173	’ repeated the great man , shaking his head . ‘
45297	45302	45303	45303	You	0	’ said Mary drily . ‘
45316	45317	45309	45309	I	0	’ ‘
45330	45350	45324	45324	you	1170	’ And then he added briskly , taking out a sheet of paper and beginning to write a prescription , ‘
45385	45391	45321	45321	dear	594	’ he muttered to himself , ‘
45410	45495	45554	45555	the doctor	693	’ There was a silence . Mary said nothing , but observed , with much interest , a sparrow which was conveying to a nest in the drain - pipe a crust of bread which the servants had thrown out in the yard . Since Vincent 's letter — a long , characteristic letter , speaking of new duties , and obligations , of personal sacrifices for the cause which he had so much at heart , and of his dread of dragging her down ‘
45538	45552	45554	45555	the doctor	693	‘ Arsenic , iron , and strychnine , with something for the nerves , ’
45559	45580	45554	45555	the doctor	693	‘ and the Volnay I told you of before . There should be a complete change of scene and ideas . ’
45581	45593	45595	45595	Mary	124	‘ I 'll try the tonic and the burgundy , please , ’
45603	45636	45637	45637	she	124	‘ I can not leave London now ; and I do n't see any prospect of doing so . And — and — it is n't exactly serious , dear Dr. Danby ? ’
45656	45661	45662	45662	he	693	‘ My dear child , ’

45796	45853	45652	45652	her	124	’ repeated themselves in her brain , as she made her way towards the Strand , where she had an appointment with the editor of Illustrations .

45867	45932	45652	45652	her	124	’ shouted a newsboy in her ear , at Charing - cross ; and looking down she read , in blue or red letters , spattered and stained with London mud , the posters of the evening newspapers:—‘The Great Divorce Case . Cross - examination of the Plaintiff , Unabridged Report . Ladies ordered out of Court . Sketches of the Co - respondents . ’
46129	46131	46115	46118	A small gaping crowd	1194	‘ Run 'em
46135	46304	46115	46118	A small gaping crowd	1194	’ said a raucous voice on the fringe of the crowd ; and , indeed , a policeman 's helmet was now seen bearing down towards the group . Mary hurried on . Further on there were sordid little eating - houses displaying a joint of raw meat , a cauliflower , and a plate of oysters ; and dark narrow passages — the entrance to theatres — ornamented with coloured posters of the latest three - act farce . Inexpressibly dreary were the pictures which invited one within : representations of elderly ladies in black silk , falling backwards into hip - baths : monster heads of comedians , with flaxen wigs and brick - red complexions , displaying all their teeth in a frightful grin ; full - length posters of girls with knowing smiles and abnormally developed limbs ; while further on , outside a music - hall , was the picture of a raffish - looking dwarf , who was described with engaging optimism as ‘

47062	47069	47071	47071	Mary	124	‘ Oh , as to breezy , ’
47078	47113	47071	47071	Mary	124	‘ I never somehow feel like that . I do n't know how it is , but I ca n't help seeing things as they are , and the truth is so supremely attractive . ’

47131	47168	47128	47129	the editor	2182	‘ Now take this chapter back and reconsider it . This young man , now — he is n't a principal character in the story — couldn't you make him her cousin — or her brother ? ’

47184	47209	47178	47178	Mary	124	‘ but I did like that chapter . I took so much trouble over it . It was a little bit of real observation . ’
47210	47254	47128	47129	the editor	2182	‘ That 's right . And if you do n't mind my saying so , there are n't quite enough love scenes between the hero and the heroine . The public like love - scenes , and besides , they illustrate so well . ’

47352	47367	47348	47349	Perry Jackson	173	’ said Mary to herself , as she stepped out into the windy Strand . ‘
47381	47429	47369	47369	he	173	’ The banal , the pretty - pretty , the obvious ! This was what she was to write — if she wanted to make any money , to keep her head above water . And the kindly words of the doctor reiterated themselves in her brain : ‘
47455	47677	47348	47349	Perry Jackson	173	’ And then , with a kind of obstinate courage , she thought of what she should do to get better . She would try and eat more meat ; she would order some burgundy at the stores ; she would try and get more out in the open air ; and there was the tonic — the arsenic and strychnine — which sometimes , for a week or two , seemed to give her a fresh lease of life . She must take some of that prescription to - night , for to - morrow she had to go all the way to the Whitechapel Hospital to do a scene for her book . It would be tiring , very tiring , but it had all been arranged with Alison and Dr. Strange . The outlines of the long narrow street were growing vague in the twilight . The omnibuses , loaded inside and out , loomed in dark masses against the pink western sky . The aspect of the crowd had changed . Hardly any women were to be seen , and the newsboys , bawling their loudest , were thrusting their wares in the faces of busy lawyers hurrying from the Courts . With the passing hours , events , it would seem , had waxed more exciting . ‘
47691	47699	47369	47369	he	173	' Orris Blaythewaite in the box ! Revoltin '
47707	48270	47690	47690	Sir	1673	’ shouted the newsboys . And beneath the cold , unheeding , scudding clouds , the world which writes , and buys , and sells the news of the evening was pushing , hurrying , and jostling elbows up and down the wind - swept Strand . THE vast , mud - coloured building loomed out of the fog as the doctor 's coachman drew up , with a jerk , under the portico . Against the dark lining of the carriage the fine drawing of a man 's profile was visible by the light of a portable lamp . There were irritable folds at the corners of the mouth , a restless look in the keen eyes , as they travelled over the page he was reading . Dr. Dunlop Strange only folded up the medical paper he had been studying as he went up the steps of the Whitechapel Hospital . It was his habit to allow himself no time for vagrant thoughts , so that even to - day , when he was to meet Alison and take her over the hospital along with Mary Erle , even to - day his mind ran on professional matters . Inside the large bare hall , where a marble statue of the Queen loomed chillily out of the vague half - light , Alison and Mary , the latter carrying a leather note - book , were already awaiting him . Dunlop Strange looked at Alison , taking in every detail of her radiant personality with his swift professional glance . In the after years he always preferred to think of her as he saw her that instant , standing by the white marble statue of the Queen , for never again did she look at him with the same clear , cordial eyes . The doctor and Alison met as people meet who are more than interested in each other . For some time past she had known that he was devoted to her , and the girl had almost made up her mind , if he asked her , she would accept him . It was a busy , sensible life , that of a doctor 's wife , she told herself ; and , after all , in her world , one had to marry some day or other . One could n't permit one 's self the luxury of being an old maid , unless one had an income of over £ 5,000 a year . But there was no particular hurry , she said , when well - meaning friends bothered her about it . They were both of a certain age . They both had their own occupations , their own hobbies . The doctor never took his eyes from her face . To have this woman for his wife would be the crowning act of a brilliantly successful career . He only hesitated to speak until he had received the baronetcy which was in store for him . Not that Alison herself would care ; she had none of the usual small feminine ambitions ; but the doctor was quite aware that it would influence Lady Jane , who had made up her mind that Alison , when she married , should only make , if she could help it , what she called a ‘
48274	48461	47690	47690	Sir	1673	’ They went up a stone staircase , to which a somewhat false air of cheerfulness was imparted by a grass - green painted dado , surmounted by a bright lavender - toned wall , passing a large window giving out on a grimy back garden , a garden whose sodden grass plot was closed in by high , brown brick walls , and over which hung a heavy , fog - laden sky , etched with sooty branches . On the first landing there was a closed door , and outside , an empty stretcher , beside which two hospital porters were waiting . Suddenly the door was pushed ajar , and for an instant there was a vision of anxious , inquisitive faces , lit up by a glare of gas ; of a nurse 's back , bending forward , and of a surgeon 's face , blowing spray on to something that was invisible . Over all an intense silence , broken only by the hoarse whispers of the porters with the stretcher , wondering how long they would have to wait . ‘
48473	48481	48468	48471	many students in there	1217	’ said Alison in her practical voice . ‘
48517	48522	48498	48498	We	1220	’ Upstairs , in the ‘
48526	48649	48498	48498	We	1220	’ the fifty red - quilted beds effaced themselves in the gloom of the winter afternoon . There was a vague odour of medicine , overpowered by that of patent disinfectants . All the beds were alike ; there were blue - and - white checked curtains and vallance , a rope by which the patient could pull herself into a sitting posture , a cupboard with food and medicines inside , and a cardboard overhead , on which the number , age , disease , and diet of the patient were all duly inscribed . Yes , the little beds , thought Mary , were curiously alike , and yet on every mattress a different form of pain was being endured . ‘
48657	48686	48468	48471	many students in there	1217	’ said the doctor in a brief undertone , as the two girls passed down the room . A screen was placed round one of the narrow bedsteads . ‘
48692	48696	48468	48471	many students in there	1217	’ whispered Mary . ‘
48700	48706	48468	48471	many students in there	1217	’ answered the doctor gravely . ‘
48732	48733	48740	48740	they	1217	’ ‘
48749	48750	48753	48753	they	1217	’ ‘
48762	49053	48753	48753	they	1217	’ At intervals down the long room , with its shining white boards , blazed large fires , lighting up , here and there , the bland , unemotional features of a nurse , under her smooth hair and white cap — the sexless features of a woman who has learnt to witness suffering without a sign . Yet they brightened the room , these girls , in their lilac cotton gowns and ample aprons , with their practical faces , and their strong , helpful hands , suggesting an out - of - doors where people were healthy and happy , a place where no one was agonising . On hearing that Dr. Strange was taking visitors round , Sister Charlotte , the superintendent of the ward , emerged from her private room and hurried forward . The Sister was a long - nosed woman of thirty - five , with small , bright eyes and a cordial manner . The doctor introduced the three ladies to each other , and Sister Charlotte talked , moving forward all the time , with a professional look on her bright face . They stopped , now , at every bed . Mary asked questions in an undertone , and Dunlop Strange , whose hospital manner was proverbial , addressed each sick woman in the same tone he would have employed to a duchess . His way with women was one of the things for which he was justly famous . And in this manner the little procession moved somewhat slowly along . They had come to the end of one line of beds , and were now about to turn up the other side of the room . Sister Charlotte stopped . ‘
49063	49068	49061	49061	doctor	1175	’ she said briskly . ‘
49084	49090	49081	49082	Poor creature	1229	’ she whispered to Alison , ‘
49169	49205	49162	49162	she	1229	’ All four stepped up to the foot of the narrow bed . The patient 's back was turned to them . She was only a shapeless lump , breathing heavily under the red coverlet . ‘
49213	49223	49162	49162	she	1229	’ said Alison , in a faintly disgusted tone . ‘
49252	49385	49227	49227	they	1225	’ But the irony of actualities has little to do with any mere human volition . There are things written by the great penman we call destiny , which no man 's remorse can erase and no woman 's tears wash out . Number Twenty - seven tossed over and lay on her back , and the course of two lives was altered . Number Twenty - seven lay on her back , her vicious face , with its hard mouth and the brownish - pink flush on each cheek - bone , looking sharply emaciated against the whiteness of the pillow . Her fringe , reaching nearly to her eye - brows , was faded and lank ; the mouth , with its singularly hard lines , was swollen and livid . ‘
49390	49394	49388	49388	Alison	128	’ whispered Mary , ‘
49424	49601	49602	49602	Lord	1237	’ Dr. Dunlop Strange bent forward with his searching , professional glance , for he was famous at diagnosis . He put his hand on her wrist , and their eyes met . Good God ! Could it be ? His heart absolutely stood still . Was this horrible wreck the girl he had taken such a fancy to only half a dozen years ago — the girl who had been so fond of him , but who had grown so bad - tempered and suspicious , that he had been obliged to break off all relations with her ? And , merciful God ! could it be that this woman — the unsightly corpse , as it were , of his dead pleasure — was going to speak ; was about to spoil the happiness of his whole future life ? In all his forty - five years Dr. Dunlop Strange had never known such an odious moment . But Number Twenty - seven only laughed — an unmirthful , coarse , and empty laugh . ‘
49608	49666	49667	49668	Poor creature	1229	’ she muttered , staring the doctor straight in the eyes . Then she tossed over . It was a curious scene . The doctor drew a long breath ; he had grown visibly paler before he spoke . The nurse stared . Alison 's eyes were fixed on the bed - quilt . Mary looked perplexed . ‘
49678	49695	49670	49670	She	1239	’ he said at last , in a voice which he tried hard to make natural . ‘
49704	49758	49670	49670	She	1239	’ he added in a lower tone . And then , taking down the card hung over the bed , on which the patient 's age , disease , and diet , as well as the physician 's name in charge of the case were written , he continued in his sympathetic voice — ‘
49789	49945	49781	49781	Sister	244	’ Alison roused herself , bent over the patient , saying something kind , and passed on in a kind of dream . Not an incident of the strange scene had escaped her . She felt a curious kind of nausea ; perhaps it was the air of the ward . It sounded far off , the chat and the talk round the other beds , as they passed up the ward , and she was conscious only of an irresistible desire to go back and speak to that poor outcast on the hospital mattress . They passed to another girl — the battered leavings of the vice of a great city — and further on a sallow , bright - eyed young woman sitting up in bed , whom , Sister Charlotte whispered , they must make haste to cure and discharge , as in a month or two she would become a mother . ‘
49952	49956	49949	49950	a mother	1751	’ thought Alison , ‘
49982	50070	50071	50071	I	0	’ The face of Number Twenty - seven became an obtrusion . She must go back and hear her story ; perhaps she could help her , save her , send her out to a farm she knew of at the Cape , where even such as she might begin a new life . People often got well at the Cape when they were far gone in consumption . The doctor and Mary were a little way in front as Alison detained the Sister for a moment . ‘
50078	50090	50071	50071	I	0	’ she said , trying to make her voice sound indifferent , ‘
50136	50137	50143	50144	a Londoner	785	’ ‘
50155	50156	50157	50157	I	0	’ ‘
50160	50164	50143	50144	a Londoner	785	’ said Alison , ‘
50191	50192	50182	50182	you	244	’ ‘
50203	50433	50196	50196	me	0	’ said Dr. Dunlop Strange , in his decided way , as they stepped out into the grey mud , the orange gas - lights , and the shuffling crowd of the Whitechapel Road . But there was not much conversation as the carriage rolled westward through the deepening gloom . Mary and the doctor talked spasmodically . Alison hardly spoke . IT was three minutes to eight . Round the marble mantelpiece in the great empty - looking drawing - room in Portman Square , a small circle of guests were gathered . Lady Jane was talking . She had been a wit and a beauty in her youth , and , with the garrulity of old age , she liked to talk of her triumphs ; of her flirtation with Bulwer Lytton , whose waistcoats and whose romances were just then turning the heads of all the women ; of the occasion when she snatched a celebrity from Lady Palmerston , and above all , of d'Orsay , who , up to the last , had continued to scintillate at her dinner - parties . To - night she was discussing a famous statesman 's cautious affairs of the heart with a little old man , whose parchment face had wrinkled and whose hair had whitened in the service of his country at various minor European courts . ‘
50466	50484	50485	50485	He	1250	’ The wrinkled old man had a senile chuckle , which not infrequently turned into a cough . ‘
50528	50529	50504	50506	the other woman	1254	’ ‘
50538	50539	50535	50535	her	1254	’ ‘
50549	50588	50610	50610	she	0	’ whispered Beaufy Flower to Lady Blaythewaite , who , in her rôle of pretty woman , was standing in her favourite swaggering attitude on the hearth - rug , a radiant vision of pink and white flesh . ‘
50597	50598	50599	50599	I	0	’ ‘
50605	50609	50610	50610	she	0	're talking about , ’
50617	50633	50610	50610	she	0	‘ Does one ever meet these people anywhere — at dinner , or at Sandown ? ’
50634	50638	50613	50613	her	0	‘ Oh , they 're
50642	50654	50610	50610	she	0	’ he sniggered , patting the Parma violets in his coat . ‘
50668	50712	50659	50659	you	1250	’ announced her ladyship in her rather high voice . She was vaguely afraid of the boy 's malicious tongue , but she tolerated him about her because she was more afraid of the spiteful things he would say if she did n't . ‘
50728	50744	50719	50720	Lady Jane	131	’ he continued with a little wriggle which disposed of the pretty woman 's snub . ‘
50777	50778	50781	50781	I	0	’ ‘
50791	50922	50785	50785	They	1260	’ replied the lady , with a complacent survey of her Paris frock and her somewhat obvious charms in the huge gilt mirror . It was two months now since the great divorce case ; it was considered dull to talk about it any more . The whole affair had remained nebulous . Neither side had been able to obtain a verdict , but most people took the lady 's part . Sir Horace was old , ugly , and vicious ; she was young , pretty , and in a notably tolerant set . The husband had gone away in his steam yacht to investigate the South Sea Islands , and meanwhile Lady Blaythewaite made a point of being seen everywhere , especially at houses which she would have voted ‘
50924	51065	50785	50785	They	1260	’ a year ago . The guests were arriving quickly now . Mr. Bosanquet - Barry , very boyish - looking and important , with something to tell Lady Jane which had to be told in a distant corner , while his hostess tapped him several times playfully with a small carved ivory fan ; the Irish Viceroy , over on important business ; a well - known beauty without her husband , who was annoyed when she found she was not the last , as she had wished to make an effective entry ; Mary , looking somewhat pale and worn ; a young A.D.C. from India , with a crooked line of sunburn across his forehead , and a naïve enthusiasm for the two London beauties ; and the Attorney - General , famous for his good stories . ‘
51072	51100	51068	51070	my own child	1261	’ complained Lady Jane to the Viceroy , who had more than once advanced to offer his arm , under the impression that dinner had been announced , ‘
51138	51139	51140	51141	Young ladies	1267	’ ‘
51143	51156	51140	51141	Young ladies	1267	’ said the Viceroy , frowning , for he was very hungry , ‘
51165	51166	51162	51162	themselves	1267	’ ‘
51193	51198	51199	51199	I	0	’ complained Lady Jane . ‘
51265	51273	51258	51263	the woman who cares for society	1272	’ Just then Alison slipped in quietly . ‘
51284	51304	51305	51305	I	0	’ she said , in a tired little voice , as she kissed Lady Jane on each plump cheek . ‘
51306	51320	51258	51263	the woman who cares for society	1272	'm dead tired . I only got home from the hospital at seven . ’
51321	51325	51305	51305	I	0	‘ Well , you 're
51330	51335	51305	51305	I	0	’ said her mother . ‘
51353	51354	51346	51346	he	178	’ ‘
51358	51367	51355	51356	Dr. Strange	178	’ said Alison , her face growing white . ‘
51389	51390	51392	51392	he	178	’ ‘
51428	51756	51423	51423	we	1274	’ said Lady Jane , ringing the bell . The long procession began to move slowly to the dining - room . Alison went down alone . She ate her soup in silence , thankful for the empty chair beside her . Oh , if only something would keep him away to - night . She could not bear it . She was tired , her head ached , her throat felt dry ; she must have caught a chill . A fine drizzle had been falling when she left the Whitechapel Hospital , and nowhere was there a cab to be seen . The long journey home in an omnibus , an omnibus for which she had waited a long time at a corner , had thoroughly tired and chilled her . The conventional voices of the men , the foolish , fixed smiles of the women all around , struck her to - night as more than usually puerile . How endless seemed the long procession of fishes and meats , of hocks and clarets!—what a foolish superabundance of food ! At one moment she made up her mind she would get up and slip out of the room . The commonplace voice of Lady Blaythewaite , making the somewhat bald statement that she intended to start for Monte Carlo on the 28th of the following month , bored and irritated her . On her right hand two people were passionately discussing the way in which red mullet should be cooked . The lady , it would seem , was all for papilottes , whereas the gentleman could not endure them without being stuffed and served with port - wine sauce . It was the only moment of the dinner at which the conversation on her right hand had approached any sort of enthusiasm . The wrinkled diplomat , who sat on her mother 's left hand , was resuscitating some details of Lola Montez in '

51963	51987	51956	51956	I	0	’ said the doctor to the obsequious butler , who regarded him already as the son - in - law of the house . ‘
51989	51994	51996	51997	Lady Jane	131	're a wicked man , ’
52002	52022	51996	51997	Lady Jane	131	‘ Why did n't you come before ? My cook wo n't forgive you , even if I do . ’
52397	52402	52403	52403	he	178	‘ You look tired , ’
52412	52422	52403	52403	he	178	‘ What have you been doing to - day ? ’
52423	52450	52451	52451	she	128	‘ I ? Oh , I have been at the Whitechapel Hospital . I have been there several times since that day we went with you , ’
52455	52488	52451	52451	she	128	‘ I wish to Heaven you would not run any such risk ! We doctors are hardened , you know , but there is always the fear of infection for delicate women . ’
52489	52494	52496	52496	Alison	128	‘ I did not , ’
52498	52513	52496	52496	Alison	128	‘ go near the fever ward . I went to see — Sister Charlotte . ’

52650	52657	52645	52646	the favourite	1302	‘ Miss Gwendolen dolen’—who had just been ‘
52660	52671	52645	52646	the favourite	1302	’ and some foreign admirer , who , it appeared , ‘
52673	52679	52641	52642	the doctor	693	’ Lady Blaythewaite on to various ‘
52683	52766	52645	52646	the favourite	1302	’ On his other side an animated discussion on the subject of liqueurs was in hand , in which Miss Ives was politely pretending to take an interest . The merits of Kirsch , of Benedictine , of Elixir de Spa , were contended for with some spirit and success , while Lady Blaythewaite , joining in , declared herself entirely in favour of green Chartreuse . The subject was beginning to show signs of wear when the doctor turned to Alison — ‘
52799	52800	52801	52801	I	0	’ ‘
52807	52812	52801	52801	I	0	’ replied Alison quietly , ‘

52836	52846	52814	52814	she	244	’ said Strange , with a somewhat uneasy smile , ‘

52874	52875	52859	52859	I	0	’ ‘
52878	52929	52859	52859	I	0	’ sighed Strange , frowning slightly , as he reached out his hand to the glass of Château Lafite which the butler had just poured carefully out , holding the bottle in its wicker cage like a very treasure , lest one drop of the dregs should reach the glass . ‘
52954	52991	52992	52992	My	0	’ Alison looked at him , and there was a royal scorn in her glance . What , he was going to brazen it out , then ; to pretend that she was nothing to him ? ‘
52996	53005	52992	52992	My	0	’ she said , very slowly and softly , ‘
53028	53029	53009	53010	Mr. Lecky	259	’ ‘
53035	53047	53009	53010	Mr. Lecky	259	’ murmured Strange , with a slight movement of the shoulders , ‘

53065	53076	53052	53052	I	0	’ said Alison , in her quiet , serious voice , ‘

Properly trained and protected , she might have been well , happy , and a tolerably useful member of society . Think of it ! That woman was younger than I am . If I had only known her earlier , who knows ? I might have been her friend ; I might have saved her from — ’
53208	53211	53213	53214	the doctor	693	‘ Possibly , ’
53218	53222	53213	53214	the doctor	693	‘ but meanwhile — ’
53223	53236	53213	53214	the doctor	693	‘ Meanwhile the girl has succumbed . She died to - day . ’
53322	53328	53329	53329	he	178	‘ My dear Miss Ives , ’
53341	53369	53329	53329	he	178	‘ pray , do n't judge hastily . You have probably only heard half her story . Do you , now , really know anything about her ? ’
53370	53373	53375	53375	Alison	128	‘ Yes , ’
53402	53404	53393	53393	she	128	‘ I 'm
53413	53417	53393	53393	she	128	’ she added ; ‘
53472	53481	53470	53470	you	178	’ she added with a shade of irony , ‘
53491	53533	53534	53534	I	0	’ They were standing up now , for the ladies , gathering up their fans and gloves , were about to leave the room . He looked at her humbly , imploringly , but the beautiful candid eyes were quite hard . ‘
53557	53768	53549	53549	you	178	’ Nothing more was said . He sat down again when she was gone , staring blankly at the fruit - strewn plates and half - drained glasses , at the tall flower - stands and flickering candles . Her crumpled napkin fell across his knee , and , as it fell , he saw , with a shudder , a vision of a stiff , silent figure in the hospital mortuary . He could hear the rustle of silk dresses , and the sound of feminine voices as the ladies trailed upstairs . And he knew as he heard them go that it was all over . Yes , it was all over , for she , at any rate , was not one of those girls who have infinite complaisances for a possible husband . A man drew up his chair , asked for a light , and began to talk of a bit of scandal that was then enjoying high favour at the clubs . Strange stared at him with haggard eyes , got up , made some excuse , and left the house . TWO or three days after the dinner in Portman Square , as Mary was trying to impart an air of reality to her ‘
53770	53808	53809	53811	Dear little girl	1324	’ article in The Fan — a task at which she was busy on three mornings of every month — a pencil note was brought from Alison , dated , to her surprise , from Portman Square . ‘
53813	53817	53809	53811	Dear little girl	1324	’ it said , ‘
53819	53835	53870	53870	you	1324	'm down with an awful cold — bronchitis , I think . The doctor says I 'm
53926	53927	53929	53930	the man	1927	’ ‘
53932	53963	53929	53930	the man	1927	’ said Mary to the stolid maid - of - all - work , who was waiting , with pendant red hands and slightly open mouth , at the door , ‘
53974	54117	53965	53965	I	0	’ There were still another dozen lines to write . The thing must be neatly turned , made acidulous and sparkling . It took some fifteen minutes of writing and scratching out . Then mechanically she ran her eye once again over the lines , tied up the sheets of MSS . , and directed it to the editor before she left the house . Mary found the bride all dressed and ready when she reached the flat . Always a silent girl , who accepted things as they came , Evelina seemed to - day paralysed with the excitement of her position . In silence they drove in a four - wheel cab to Portman Square . Lady Jane , with an uneasy look on her plump , worldly face , was issuing from Alison 's bedroom when they got upstairs . ‘
54206	54221	54201	54201	Mary	124	’ she added , as she rustled down the stairs in her ample garments , ‘
54229	54252	54253	54253	Alison	128	're near my room , to bring down my bottle of lavender - salts — the strong ones with the gold top . ’
54398	54403	54405	54405	Mary	124	‘ Here she is ! ’
54506	54513	54515	54515	Alison	128	‘ Kiss me , my dear , ’
54517	54531	54515	54515	Alison	128	‘ I hope you are going to be very , very happy . I 'm

54549	54554	54546	54547	Miss Alison	128	’ cried the girl , ‘
54556	54583	54515	54515	Alison	128	'm so sorry you're — you're not well . Joe and me , we 'd both like to put the wedding off till you could come — ’
54584	54593	54595	54595	Alison	128	‘ Do n't wait for that , Evelina , ’
54604	54630	54595	54595	Alison	128	‘ you must n't wait for that . Mary , you 'll go with her to the church , and see that the wedding breakfast — ’
54631	54656	54515	54515	Alison	128	‘ Yes , yes , dear , Do n't tire yourself thinking about it all . How did you catch this dreadful — cold ? ’
54657	54692	54595	54595	Alison	128	‘ Waiting for an omnibus in the Mile End Road . You know — that night of the dinner here . I had been to the hospital . I must have caught a chill . ’

54762	54809	54815	54815	she	0	’ And a few minutes later the pink cheeks , the second - hand wedding - dress , and the creaking boots were being conveyed in a four - wheeled cab towards matrimonial respectability . Alison wanted to hear all about it when Mary got back . ‘
54818	54824	54825	54825	She	0	’ asked the sick woman . ‘
54835	54839	54825	54825	She	0	’ said Mary . ‘

55023	55063	55072	55072	Alison	128	'm afraid , after all the pains you 've taken , you have n't developed in her a sense of humour . Otherwise she would n't have insisted on being married in a second - hand white silk dress . ’
55064	55070	55072	55072	Alison	128	‘ You do n't understand , ’
55074	55096	55072	55072	Alison	128	‘ I think that it shows a certain vague hankering after the ideal — a sort of élan towards the unattainable . ’
55097	55112	55072	55072	Alison	128	‘ Nonsense ! she ought to have been married in a good stout waterproof . ’
55113	55120	55072	55072	Alison	128	‘ Well , thank goodness , we 're

55162	55167	55169	55169	Alison	128	're an unsympathetic beast , ’
55177	55195	55169	55169	Alison	128	‘ I should n't have laughed . I know these people so much better than you do . ’
55236	55240	55273	55275	the sick girl	1355	‘ Little Mary ! ’
55249	55254	55273	55275	the sick girl	1355	‘ Yes , dear ? ’

55368	55373	55278	55278	her	1355	’ said Mary slowly , ‘
55406	55407	55426	55426	you	1360	’ ‘
55418	55424	55426	55426	you	1360	’ said Alison , regretfully . ‘
55441	55442	55432	55439	that poor girl , Number Twenty - seven	1362	’ ‘
55455	55459	55450	55450	you	1360	’ faltered Mary . ‘

55522	55523	55520	55520	Alison	128	’ ‘
55529	55535	55526	55527	that girl	1368	’ muttered the sick woman , ‘
55549	55550	55542	55542	He	178	’ ‘
55559	55563	55553	55553	Alison	128	’ Alison nodded . ‘
55638	55639	55615	55617	a respectable girl	1372	’ ‘

55681	55694	55678	55678	I	0	’ she added , while the anxious look deepened on her forehead , ‘
55709	55714	55705	55705	You	0	’ she said excitedly , ‘
55725	55726	55716	55716	them	1375	’ ‘
55735	55748	55716	55716	them	1375	’ But the thing seemed to have taken possession of her mind . ‘
55757	55762	55751	55751	you	0	’ she asked presently . ‘
55775	55776	55767	55767	her	1368	’ ‘
55826	55827	55823	55823	Vincent	129	’ ‘

55885	55894	55895	55895	She	1368	’ replied Mary , gazing into the firelight . ‘
55903	55908	55909	55909	she	1368	’ said Alison presently , ‘
55950	56054	56055	56055	I	0	’ The winter dusk fell early in the spacious bed - room . There was a terrible tension in the air . The very atmosphere seemed charged with feminine emotion , as the two girls , exaggerating , as over - refined women will , the importance of ethical standards of conduct in the great teeming universe , talked on and on in the gathering gloom . It was dark when Lady Jane returned , bringing with her large , pink cheeks , her parted hair , her rustling silk clothes , an air at once motherly and mundane into the sick room . ‘
56069	56080	56055	56055	I	0	’ she announced in her rather loud but cheery voice . ‘
56098	56105	56092	56092	Dunlop	178	’ she added with a sigh , ‘
56132	56234	56122	56122	I	0	’ But the great man , when he finally arrived , preserved an impenetrable mask in the presence of Alison , of her mother , and of Mary . A prolonged consultation with the other doctor resulted in frequent doses of brandy or port wine being ordered , and an admission , just at the hall - door , that the case was serious . Mary went down to the dining - room when the bell rang , leaving Alison 's old nurse at the bedside side . Lady Jane 's one idea was that Dunlop Strange should be called in . ‘
56242	56262	56236	56236	she	0	’ she reiterated for the fifth time , shaking her head tragically when the butler offered her a savoury , ‘
56315	56316	56302	56302	they	1389	’ ‘
56321	56325	56302	56302	they	1389	’ urged Mary , ‘
56348	56359	56302	56302	they	1389	’ She had made up her mind to say nothing about ‘
56365	56523	56302	56302	they	1389	’ and her sordid little tragedy . Lady Jane was kind and charming , but she had retained the prejudices of ladies who were young in the fifties . In all probability she would only call the dead girl some old - fashioned hard names . Certainly she would never comprehend her daughter 's extremely modern sympathy for this woman who had drawn her last breath in a hospital ward . It was settled that Mary should remain all night at the bedside . There were a dozen things to think of : food , stimulants , medicines , blisters . She ran over carefully in her mind all that she would have to do during the night . Lady Jane said she would lie down in the next room but with the door open , to listen . Towards ten o'clock , the sick girl sat up , saying she could breathe easier in that position . ‘
56532	56548	56549	56549	Mary	124	’ she muttered , clenching her fingers as they lay on the counter - pane . ‘
56551	56571	56572	56572	she	0	’ she continued , while the irritable anxious look deepened on her face for she had to stop—‘I feel , ’
56577	56584	56572	56572	she	0	‘ as if I were choking . ’
56585	56588	56590	56592	the other girl	901	‘ Dear , ’
56594	56602	56590	56592	the other girl	901	‘ why do n't you lie down ? ’
56603	56647	56572	56572	she	0	‘ I can't — I ca n't breathe if I do . Mary , do you think I shall be ill long ? I 've always hated being ill . There is the personal degradation — one looks odious , one is odious . ’
56648	56663	56665	56665	Mary	124	‘ Dear , you will be all right again in a day or two , ’
56667	56676	56677	56677	she	124	‘ Oh ! I do n't mean that , ’
56683	56695	56696	56696	she	124	‘ It does n't matter ; nothing matters , nothing matters , ’
56733	56744	56746	56748	the great man	2710	‘ How long has the patient been in that position ? ’
56763	56782	56784	56785	the girl	1681	‘ She 's been lying like that all the time — when she is n't sitting up coughing , ’
56787	56811	56784	56785	the girl	1681	‘ Ah ! We must keep up the patient 's strength in every way . It 's very serious now , Miss Erle . ’
56825	56837	56839	56840	Lady Jane	229	‘ I WILL not , while I have health and strength , ’
56857	56875	56876	56876	she	229	‘ consent to have my child nursed by a hireling . It is a mother 's duty , ’
57042	57045	57047	57048	the mother	1816	‘ No , ’
57050	57067	57047	57048	the mother	1816	‘ not while I have health and strength . I shall go to her myself immediately . ’
57149	57152	57153	57153	she	128	‘ Mary , ’
57160	57175	57153	57153	she	128	‘ my feet look so odd . They are swelling — I wonder why ? ’
57193	57198	57199	57199	she	128	‘ Funny it looks , ’
57202	57264	57199	57199	she	128	‘ What 's his name ? the French sculptor — you know — modelled my foot once . It would be horrid’—she stared vacantly at the little swollen foot , while Mary bent down and rearranged the bed - clothes—‘to have great fat feet like that . Mary , do you think they will get slim again when I am well ? ’
57265	57275	57286	57287	The doctors	1896	‘ My darling , of course , of course . ’
57288	57321	57286	57287	The doctors	1896	' visit brought small comfort . Both bent with anxious faces over the bed . Little could be done but to administer strong restoratives . The two physicians feared some cerebral complication . ‘
57326	57332	57199	57199	she	128	’ they asked Lady Jane , ‘
57339	57340	57286	57287	The doctors	1896	’ ‘
57351	57356	57347	57347	My	0	’ replied the mother , ‘
57380	57410	57375	57375	I	0	’ she announced , with all an old woman 's fatuity . The two doctors glanced at each other and said nothing . Mary detained the elder man downstairs . ‘
57416	57420	57412	57412	me	0	’ she said . ‘
57471	57567	57462	57462	you	1408	’ Mary stood still for a minute , leaning against the passage wall , as the two doctors closed the door softly . She heard the two carriages roll away — rolling away to other sick rooms , to pronounce , perhaps , another sentence of death before they reached home . It was nothing to them , she remembered ; nothing , nothing , nothing . People died every day . Every day people were born . Some had to go , these men of science would say , to make way for others . ‘
57579	57595	57462	57462	you	1408	’ whispered Lady Jane an hour later , as they both stood at the bedside . ‘
57626	57649	57617	57617	I	0	’ she added feverishly , patting her eyes with a lace handkerchief . Mary looked at the slight figure in the bed . ‘
57654	57659	57650	57652	Dear Lady Jane	229	’ she said softly , ‘
57675	57865	57660	57660	I	0	’ It struck her as curiously odd that she should be saying this to the woman near her — this woman that she always pictured at dinner - parties and drums , tapping people with her fan , carrying her bare shoulders and her little stories from drawing - room to drawing - room in the eternal monotony of good society . With a thing so poignant , so human , so pitiful as death , it seemed impossible that this charming lady could ever be associated . The mother broke down completely , and had to be led away . Towards four o'clock someone knocked at the door , bringing up letters for Mary . They had been sent round from the lodgings in Bulstrode Street . There were several letters : one from Jimmie , one from her bootmaker , and one she saw , with a curious tight feeling at her heart , was from Vincent , and bore a Northborough post - mark . Going to the window , she bent forward in the failing light and broke the seal . Northborough , Dec. 3rd . ‘MY

60251	60407	60248	60250	Lady Jane Ives	131	' in Portman Square . The drawing - room was already spread with shining satin trains , and heavy with the odour of slightly faded hothouse flowers , before the hostess herself appeared , for Lady Jane was presenting a niece , and had been late in getting away from the palace . One or two men , vaguely bored , strayed about with uncertain feet among the yards of satin and brocade which covered the floor ; and the women , in their nodding plumes and foolish trains , seemed conscious of their wrinkled throats and faded skins , as they stood , with a somewhat forced smile , receiving the usual compliments . But very soon Lady Jane appeared , swimming into the room with her large smile , and her ruby velvet train , and having behind her a young girl in white , with puffy pink cheeks and an alarmed air . ‘
60413	60427	60248	60250	Lady Jane Ives	131	’ she announced to every one , in her rapid , genial manner . ‘
60461	60521	60522	60522	I	0	’ And Mr. Beaufort Flower , with a huge white button - hole which accentuated the dingy yellow of his skin , and with several tell - tale wrinkles at the corners of his eyes , murmured to Mr. Bosanquet - Barry as he gazed with half - closed lids at the new candidate for society 's favours ; — ‘
60561	60595	60548	60548	one	1802	’ he tittered , turning to where Lady Blaythewaite 's creamy white shoulders were illuminated by the full glare from the window , the sunlight sparkling on the diamond tiara round her forehead . ‘
60606	60617	60599	60599	her	267	’ said Mr. Bosanquet - Barry , with rising interest , ‘
60640	60641	60646	60646	she	267	’ ‘
60650	60659	60646	60646	she	267	’ whispered Beaufy , in his acidulous voice , ‘
60691	60759	60681	60683	Poor Lady Blay	234	’ The room was nearly full when Mary came up the stairs . A stout lady in green , whose extremities looked extraordinarily large in their white coverings , thrust a bouquet of spiked flowers in her eye as she reached the landing , and then stared , with all the impertinence of a certain kind of British matron , when the girl stepped back , annoyed . ‘
60766	60775	60681	60683	Poor Lady Blay	234	’ said a shrill voice at the door , ‘
60790	60803	60787	60787	I	0	’ continued Mr. Beaufort Flower , who entertained a good deal himself , ‘
60836	60837	60866	60867	Lady Blaythewaite	160	’ ‘
60842	60857	60866	60867	Lady Blaythewaite	160	’ said Mary , who never troubled herself to laugh at his small witticisms . ‘
60876	60902	60866	60867	Lady Blaythewaite	160	’ He always made a point of praising other women when he talked to ladies , in the pleasing hope that it would annoy them . ‘
60932	60937	60938	60938	she	1514	’ he chattered on , ‘
60966	61055	60957	60957	she	1514	’ And he disappeared with a delighted little wriggle in the crowd , and a few minutes later Mary saw him pouring his sub - acid compliments into Lady Blaythewaite 's ear . There was some attempt at animation in the rooms now . There were crowds of ladies as well as those who had been to Court , and a hired pianist , making tinkling sounds on a somewhat worn piano , was endeavouring to impart a false air of gaiety to the affair . The words , ‘
61059	61060	61061	61062	the Princess	1516	’ ‘
61064	61065	61061	61062	the Princess	1516	’ ‘
61069	61070	61061	61062	the Princess	1516	’ ‘
61074	61076	61061	61062	the Princess	1516	’ and ‘
61080	61249	61061	61062	the Princess	1516	’ were bandied about the room . Some one related a story that a Colonial lady of much wealth had been turned away because she had worn tan - coloured gloves , and an ancient legend even found listeners that a young girl had fallen over her train while backing from the Royal presence . A woman with pronounced Jewish features , who wore a smart bonnet and a French frock , explained at some length to an indifferent group what had happened when she had been presented last year . And , as she stood talking to Mr. Bosanquet - Barry , who had , as usual , his air of not wishing to be detained , the lady whom Mary remembered in the old days as a player on the harp , had placed a piece of music on the piano , and was singing in an elderly , threadbare voice , and an accent which left much to be desired , something which sounded like — ‘
61257	61542	61061	61062	the Princess	1516	’ lifting her eyebrows , standing on tip - toe , and slightly wriggling her shoulders as the song proceeded . Mary looked round the room . It all seemed foolish enough ; the women with their naked , yellow shoulders , their torn veils and faded flowers , the men slipping in and out in their neat frock coats , murmuring scandal of the very people whose hands they had just pressed . She could not bear the house since Alison 's death . The rooms seemed noisy and yet empty without her . It was the same outwardly , for here were the usual crowd , chattering , smiling , whispering , as they passed in and out . And only she , Mary , seemed to remember . Lady Jane , to be sure , had been immersed in grief for some months after the death , but the next season she had reappeared in mauve and black , and had resumed her round of drums and dinners . All that had happened five years ago . This was the second niece that she had successfully launched in society ; the first had made an excellent match , and Lady Jane only hoped , in confidence to all her intimate friends , that Victoria would not think of marrying quite so soon , for it was charming , she said — it made her feel quite young again — to have a girl to take out . She never , she complained , had been able to make her poor darling Alison take a proper interest in society ; only an eccentric , intermittent one . And people naturally dislike that . ‘
61548	61589	61590	61592	Dear Sir Dunlop	268	’ urged the lady at the piano , but her voice , not being very strong , was inaudible at the end of the song , a termination which was received thankfully , with a decent little murmur of applause . ‘
61594	61608	61590	61592	Dear Sir Dunlop	268	’ cried Lady Jane in her deep , genial tones at the door , ‘
61659	62005	62006	62006	I	0	’ And the face of the fashionable doctor , smooth , smug , successful , was seen here and there chatting in the crowd . If the mouth was still hard , the smile was more insinuating than ever . A voluptuous feminine atmosphere surrounded him as he moved about , as pretty women bent forward to whisper , meeting his eyes with an intimate look , or laying detaining , half - caressing fingers on his arm . All of these charming ladies had been , were now , or would be , his patients . His reputation had grown apace in the last five years ; no one could have the megrims in Belgravia or Mayfair without consulting Sir Dunlop Strange . Reports of his approaching marriage were constantly circulated , but at present , it would seem , there was a barrier in the way ; for he was understood to be devoted to Lady Blaythewaite . And indeed , as he neared the window where she was still standing , the circle of black coats which surrounded her dissolved , and they stood practically alone , looking out on the square . The lady slowly turned her handsome , prominent eyes upon him , and , with a long gaze which took in every detail of her radiant health and beauty , he slipped his nervous , sinewy fingers round her wrist in the shadow of the curtain . Mary was standing near the door , trying to get a breath of air , when the pale , town - bred face of Perry Jackson was seen ascending the stair , but she instinctively stepped aside , not knowing whether he would care to speak to her . She heard Lady Jane overwhelm him with pretty phrases , for she was proud of the portrait he had painted of her that year , and adored a new celebrity ; but Perry Jackson did not come near Mary , and it was with a somewhat forced smile that he returned her greeting . ‘
62014	62046	62009	62012	my kind little friend	1521	’ she said to herself with a certain bitterness . And then , as Vincent Hemming appeared in the crowd , she said to herself with the inconsistency of a woman , ‘
62066	62296	62009	62012	my kind little friend	1521	’ The face of Vincent Hemming was that of an irritated , disappointed man . He was , however , as perfectly dressed , as elaborately suave as of old , as he stopped to speak to several dowagers on his way upstairs . It was always half a pleasure , half a pain to her to meet him , and there were times when she felt that the acquiescent feminine smile was a little forced as she talked to him at some crowded party , or called on his wife at Queen 's Gate . Hemming had made but a brief appearance in the House of Commons , for he had been unseated almost immediately — his agents , it would seem , not having been discreet in the matter of beer ; and he had had no opportunity of entering the House since . Meanwhile , Mrs. Vincent Hemming had not made herself popular in London society , and her husband had always a somewhat uneasy air when she was in the same room . Lady Jane Ives , for one , openly snubbed her , and Vincent had arrived at that stage in an unsuccessful marriage when a husband is not offended at being asked out to dinner without his wife . To any other woman but Mary the thing would have been a personal triumph . ‘
62308	62315	62301	62302	Mr. Hemming	129	’ whispered Lady Jane to Mary ; ‘
62369	62515	62516	62516	You	1530	’ And in a few minutes Mary found herself talking , in a conventional voice , of the rain and the fine weather , of politics and the park , with the man who had once been so much to her . Sometimes , indeed , as he took her down to supper , or handed her a cup of tea , with his little formal manner , she wondered how , in those past years , he had been able to make her suffer so . But Mary was beginning to understand that women love most of all the men who have done them an irreparable wrong . His face looked grey and tired , and it was with a visible effort that he found phrases suitable to be overheard by the nodding plumes , the bare shoulders , and the limp nosegays around . ‘
62524	62542	62516	62516	You	1530	’ she said suddenly , in her old sweet manner . For a moment Mary had forgotten . ‘
62559	62581	62556	62556	I	0	’ he said , avoiding her eyes . Then he added , after a pause , looking straight at the carpet , ‘
62597	62627	62630	62630	I	0	’ She said nothing ; there was nothing she could say . But he looked miserable , and all her tender , womanly little heart rushed out to him . ‘
62638	62677	62630	62630	I	0	’ he said suddenly , offering her his arm , and turning with an abrupt movement towards the door . Downstairs , there was the usual struggle for a cup , a sugar - basin , a spoon . ‘
62690	62707	62688	62688	Mary	124	’ he said , in his voice which meant so much more than the mere words . ‘
62727	62737	62721	62721	I	0	’ said Mary , with a comical little frown . ‘
62739	62758	62760	62760	Hemming	129	'm so sorry , and you do n't like sugar either . How could I have forgotten it ? ’
62770	62774	62775	62775	he	129	‘ But Mary , ’
62787	62829	62775	62775	he	129	‘ why wo n't you read me some of your work ? I used not to be a bad critic , though I do little enough myself now . Why ca n't we see each other , sometimes , like that ? ’
62858	62862	62863	62863	she	0	‘ Of course , ’
62905	62922	62893	62893	her	1533	‘ I suppose you can come and be victimised by manuscripts — if you want to . ’
62923	62928	62993	62993	he	129	‘ When , Mary ? ’
62929	62932	62933	62933	she	0	‘ Oh , ’
62937	62958	62933	62933	she	0	‘ not to - morrow . I 've got to go to the Strand . But the day after — ? ’
62959	62971	62973	62973	Hemming	129	‘ Are n't you well ? Let me look at you , ’
62986	62992	62993	62993	he	129	‘ Come into the light , ’
63000	63009	62993	62993	he	129	‘ I ca n't have you getting ill . ’
63127	63131	63123	63123	she	271	‘ splendid fun . ’
63154	63156	63152	63152	he	179	‘ smart ’
63182	63192	63194	63195	Vincent Hemming	129	‘ The day after to - morrow , Mary ? ’
63262	63266	63222	63222	he	179	‘ To the Bachelors '
63269	63398	63222	63222	he	179	’ Mary stood silent for a moment , gazing at the stone steps . After all , why should she not see Vincent — her old friend , her father 's friend ? She felt nervous and unstrung ; it would be very sweet to have him there , to talk to him in a sensible way . She wanted to ask his advice about Jimmie , for her young brother , who had duly got his exhibition at Magdalen , had done little more during his stay at Oxford than entangle himself with , and finally marry , a scout 's daughter . Living by herself in lodgings , she never saw any one ; there seemed to be no one now whose advice she could ask . ‘
63403	63498	63499	63501	Mr. Vincent Hemming	129	’ she said suddenly , in a high , clear tone , and , as she went down the steps and hurried across the square , she was startled herself by the note of exultation in her voice . ALTHOUGH she had been thinking of Hemming for hours , the sharp , agitated pull of the bell startled Mary as she sat sorting papers at her desk in the little room , a third room , crowded with bookshelves , which she had been able to add to her domain during the last year . ‘
63503	63531	63499	63501	Mr. Vincent Hemming	129	’ said the servant opening the door . He shook hands , without a word . Mary knew instinctively that something was wrong , before he spoke . ‘
63541	63717	63539	63539	Sarah	227	’ she said , and , until the girl brought in the cups and saucers , they sat exchanging commonplaces a little awkwardly . There was a tight feeling in Mary 's throat as she looked at Hemming 's drawn face and averted eyes . And yet it was good to have him there , all to herself , sitting opposite to her , sipping his tea , on the deep sofa near the window , his brown eyes looking black against the light . He got up presently , moving restlessly about the little room , examining with curious eyes the place which was Mary 's home . He stopped in front of the old - fashioned writing - table , on which blotting - paper , foolscap , and worn - out pens were scattered . A great odorous bunch of waxen pinkish lilac stood in a jug on the table . On the shelf above the pigeon - holes there was a full - length , slightly - faded photograph of himself . ‘
63725	63755	63758	63758	Mary	124	’ he muttered , absently , sitting down in the swing chair , and leaning his elbow , with a tired gesture , on the ink - stained desk . ‘
63776	63777	63768	63768	You	1544	’ ‘
63798	63820	63783	63783	I	0	’ she added , taking a wooden panel from under a pile of papers and holding it a little way off . ‘
63848	63849	63850	63850	I	0	’ ‘
63853	63955	63850	63850	I	0	’ he said , gravely . And then something tightened at her heart as she stood near him , holding out the sketch . It was the very scene she had so often pictured when she lived here waiting for him to come back . Here was the room , lined with book - shelves ; the desk , with Vincent half - turned round , while she held her smudgy little painting up for him to see . Only the years had passed away , and he was another woman 's husband , the father of another woman 's child .... ‘
63959	63988	63956	63956	I	0	’ he repeated , softly , taking the little nervous hand that hung close to him , and looking at it intently as he held it in his . ‘
63999	64005	63990	63990	Mary	124	’ he said , suddenly . ‘
64017	64018	63990	63990	Mary	124	’ ‘
64026	64030	64031	64031	she	124	'm all right , ’
64040	64057	64031	64031	she	124	‘ I 've been worried about Jimmie . And I've — I've been working rather hard — ’
64058	64069	64070	64070	he	1548	‘ You ca n't stand it , you never could , ’
64073	64097	64099	64099	Hemming	129	‘ In the old days you used “ to get away — you used to travel with your father . ” Good Lord ! ’
64118	64129	64109	64109	he	1548	‘ you 'll be killing yourself , and for what ? ’
64130	64134	64136	64136	Mary	124	‘ One works , ’
64140	64146	64109	64109	he	1548	‘ because one must . I 'm
64157	64180	64181	64181	Heaven	156	’ Hemming got up and strode up and down the room , his mouth working nervously at the corners as he answered — ‘
64201	64214	64192	64192	you	124	’ he blurted out suddenly , his face turning a dark red , ‘
64226	64227	64192	64192	you	124	’ ‘
64239	64255	64257	64257	I	0	’ she said slowly , her eyes fixed on the empty teacup in her hand , ‘
64263	64264	64265	64266	My wife	1552	’ ‘
64268	64273	64265	64266	My wife	1552	’ he said derisively . ‘
64318	64358	64315	64315	I	0	'm a failure . I have n't done what she married me for ; she has spent her money for nothing . Mary , the egotism of a vulgar woman is something that you can not even conceive of . ’
64359	64372	64374	64374	Mary	124	‘ Do n't talk like that , do n't , do n't , ’
64376	64390	64391	64391	she	124	‘ Oh , Vincent , I — it does n't matter about me , ’
64394	64405	64406	64406	She	124	‘ but I ca n't bear to see you unhappy . ’
64466	64473	64474	64474	she	124	‘ My poor , poor dear , ’
64484	64510	64511	64511	she	124	‘ it will come all right by and by . You will try , wo n't you , to be — nicer — to her ? ’
64517	64538	64511	64511	she	124	‘ It must be so easy for husband and wife to make it up . And there is the child — ’
64539	64543	64544	64544	he	1556	‘ The child , ’
64548	64589	64544	64544	he	1556	‘ A thing three years old . And she is jealous if I even look at the baby . Mary , her jealousy is infernal . I ca n't live with her , I ca n't , I ca n't . ’
64770	64775	64776	64776	she	1978	‘ Vin — cent , ’
64869	64949	64950	64950	he	1562	‘ Mary , my own little girl ! Why wo n't you look at me ? Turn up your face . Let me see your eyes . You belonged to me once , Mary . Look at me , dearest , say you have n't forgotten me altogether ? Dear heart , how good it is ! No , do n't move , do n't move , for God 's sake . Give me my little bit of happiness , ’

65011	65020	65026	65026	You	1562	're not hurting anyone — but me ! You 're
65027	65038	65026	65026	You	1562	're doing your best to make me a miserable woman . ’
65147	65150	65151	65151	she	124	‘ Vincent , ’
65160	65212	65151	65151	she	124	‘ try and be brave , for — for both our sakes . We — we ca n't help it now . It 's all done with long ago — for you and me . Do n't forget that . Do n't torture me , for God 's sake , dear . ’
65213	65219	65220	65220	he	129	‘ Understand me , Mary , ’

65312	65359	65299	65299	he	129	‘ come with me . If you wish it , I 'll give up everything ; my position , my political career , my — my child . Wo n't you — can't you be to me what she has never been , my real wife ? ’
65360	65365	65367	65367	Mary	124	‘ Your real wife ! ’

65549	65561	65542	65542	he	2048	‘ in some little place where English people do n't go — ’
65562	65574	65575	65575	she	124	‘ Ah — some place where English people do n't go ! ’
65605	65608	65609	65609	he	2048	‘ Mary , ’
65613	65737	65738	65738	he	1571	‘ my little girl ! Dare to be yourself . Come to me , let us begin a new life , a real life , dear . You are above the prejudices of our false civilisation , you are capable of being a true woman , of giving up something for the man you love . In a little while I might be free , and then we could be married . Mary , Mary , do n't you really care for me enough for that ? Think of it , think of what we are missing ? It would not be a selfish life we would lead , Mary . We would work together . You would inspire me to noble things , ’
65749	65788	65738	65738	he	1571	‘ Other women — great women — have been strong enough , single - hearted enough , to do as much for the men they loved . Dear heart , think of the years we might spend together . ’
65965	65968	65969	65969	she	124	‘ Vincent , ’
65977	66097	66098	66098	she	1577	‘ I ca n't do it . I ca n't , I can't — not even for you ! It is not that I mind what people would say — that 's nothing . It is n't that I do n't love you . I — I — why , I have always loved you . But it 's the other woman — your wife . I ca n't , I wo n't , deliberately injure another woman . Think how she would suffer ! Oh , the torture of women 's lives — the helplessness , the impotence , the emptiness ! And , Vincent , she is the mother of your child . Your child , dear , ’
66106	66141	66142	66142	she	1577	‘ I could not bear that she should grow up and hate me . All we modern women mean to help each other now . We have a bad enough time as it is , ’
66150	66220	66142	66142	she	1577	‘ surely we need n't make it worse by our own deliberate acts ! We often talked it all over , Alison and I. You do n't know the good she did in her life , the help , the sympathy she gave . You will go away a little , Vincent , and then you will go back . You will go back — to your little daughter ? ’
66295	66300	66301	66301	he	1578	‘ Tell Miss Erle , ’
66311	66323	66301	66301	he	1578	‘ that I am waiting — to say good - bye . ’
66324	66341	66342	66342	She	1577	‘ Miss Mary went out nearly an hour ago , sir . Did n't you know ? ’
66619	67479	66618	66618	sweethearts	1597	' feet on the gravel path ; the delicate aroma of newly - cut grass . All around her were simple human joys . But they were not for her . She had left all that behind her in that little room in Bulstrode Street , where sat the one man in the world that she cared for — the one man now who cared for her . There was no one else ; there never could be any one else . But it behoved her henceforward to be sensible — to be strong for both of them . She must never see him again , must , above all , try and think of Vincent as she used to do , before that afternoon in Harley Street — how many years ago now?—when he had first made love to her , and asked her to wait for him . How it spoiled everything — this eternal question of sex ! It was almost impossible for a woman to see a man as he really is . And , in pursuance of the plan of being sensible , she went deliberately over Hemming 's faults . They were obvious enough . He was weak , vacillating ; his phrases were absurd . His ambitions , after all , were but vulgar ones , and he had not the will - power to carry out even his most cherished plans . He was all that , and yet he was the only man in the world that she loved — the only man in the world now who desired her as a woman . And yet she must walk on , get as far away from him as possible . Here , at the North Gate , the slim young poplars detached themselves tremblingly against the pinkish sky , while in front of her stretched the long , white Avenue Road , with its substantial , scrupulously - kept houses , holding themselves aloof in their leafy gardens . She would walk on until she came to Hampstead . Up there , there was space , distance ; one 's horizon opened out . Over the garden walls swayed the waxen , pinkish lilac . The scent struck her like a blow ; that room where they had been together had been filled with the same penetrating , sensuous odour . Pink lilac and foliage made artificial - looking by the yellow light of a gas - lamp — how they always reminded her of Paris : of Paris , where they might have been on their way by now . But she was walking alone , steeling her heart against him , in a road in a London suburb . On each side was the prosperous , orderly , contented life of the middle - class , with its placid domesticity , its unemotional joys . From the open window of a long drawing - room came the sound of a young girl 's thread - like voice . Upstairs , in the nursery , the lights were already lowered . The white street was deserted . But suddenly , from one of the open gateways , appeared a pair of sleek chestnuts . The carriage passed out , and , as Mary stood waiting at the curb , a man and a woman 's smiling faces were photographed on her brain . A prosperous , middle - aged couple , going out to a placid evening 's amusement . Then silence again . The girl pushed on , past endless rows of houses , trim , smug dwellings , every one of which represented the Family — that special product of civilisation for which she , as an individual , was to be sacrificed .... On and on , until at last , through a dark , leafy lane , she emerged on the open heath . The after - glow of a crimson sunset still hung in the west . The Surrey Hills were faintly blue , and the heath , with its broken ridges topped with gorse and bracken , swept in superb lines at her feet . The air was very still . Over yonder a mysterious hand had hung a silver sickle in the pale twilight sky . Mary sank tired on to a seat . But presently two vague figures approached in the growing darkness — the figures of a girl and a young man , working people both , who sat awkwardly down at the other end of the bench , and talked in jerky , constrained whispers . The girl 's eyes were bent demurely on her lap , but once , when Mary turned her head in their direction , she could see that the young man 's eyes were devouring the face of his shabby little companion with a passionate glance . Something tightened at Mary 's throat . Why to - night , of all nights , must she be reminded of what she was giving up ? She got up , and began to walk rapidly homewards . ‘
67492	67496	67486	67486	I	0	’ she thought . ‘
67504	67516	67486	67486	I	0	’ With some trepidation she rang the bell of her lodgings . ‘
67523	67527	67519	67520	Mr. Hemming	129	’ she asked . ‘
67540	67541	67535	67535	you	1600	’ ‘
67565	68190	68191	68191	You	1601	’ Mary went straight into the little study and shut the door . Outwardly nothing was changed . The air was full of his presence . There were the tea - cups out of which they had drunk ; the chair at the writing - table was still half swung round , just as Vincent Hemming had left it . It was here , just at the mantelpiece , that he had taken her into his arms and said all those mad things . She went deliberately over the scene , repeating in her mind everything he had said . On the sofa the cushions were still tumbled where he had sat and sobbed . Ah , for once , she had made him suffer . She flung herself down , clenching her fists , with her face against the silken cushions . Her other self revolted against the injustice of human laws . The woman within her cried aloud in the darkness . What had she done that she was always to be sacrificed ? Why was she to miss the best that life has to offer ? She lay there a long time , miserable , stricken , helpless . Then , going into her bedroom she began to take off her dress mechanically and to unloosen her hair . Half - dressed as she was , she flung herself on the bed ; she was tired and footsore with her long walk . For an hour she fell into a fitful sleep . The night was warm , but she could hear the flapping of the window - blind , swaying in a light breeze . Mary lay there a long time , every nerve in her body quivering . How long , how long the night was ! Would it never end , never be daylight , when she could get up and work again ? To work was to forget . If only she could keep strong and not worry too much . She got up presently , weary with lying awake , and lit a couple of candles on the dressing - table . The flapping - blind got on her nerves . She had forgotten to wind up her watch , but , from the curious hush in the air , Mary thought it must be nearing dawn . Then she began to pace the room mechanically . Would the night never end ? In the mirror on the dressing - table she caught sight of herself as she passed . Her fair hair was floating in a kind of halo round her head ; her bare arms and shoulders emerged from the whiteness of her bodice . How the eyes looked at her — hauntingly , appealingly — from out of a pathetic little face . She slipped into the chair at the table , and leaning her face on her hands , looked gravely at the mirror . For a long time now she had had a strange sense of dual individuality . When she looked in the glass a woman looked back at her with reproachful , haunting eyes . And to - night the woman looked at her appealingly . By the soft candle - light the face was curiously young . The cheeks were delicately thin , but the lips were those of a girl of eighteen ; in the fluffy , fair head the few grey hairs were lost among the pale gold . There was the line of her throat , her beautiful white shoulders , the delicate modelling of her satiny arms . And , as she looked , the woman in the glass softened with a triumphant smile . ‘
68211	68216	68207	68207	He	1602	’ smiled the woman . ‘
68420	68482	68419	68419	lovers	1612	' glances , and the laughter of little children . But for me , for me it will all be dark . Yet we do have the present moment ; let us keep it and hold it . We are alive now . We love each other . Give him to me ! Only a few short years am I here , ’
68488	68578	68419	68419	lovers	1612	‘ I , and such as I , tearing our little hands in the search for gold , shaking them at the heavens with impotent vengeance . Give him to me , give him to me ! The inexorable years — the years which fade and blight — will pass over us , and then our “ folly ” will be forgotten . Why , people in the next generation will shrug their shoulders and say , “ After all , they were only human . ” And I , ’
68586	68592	68419	68419	lovers	1612	‘ I shall have lived . ’
68664	68674	68675	68675	they	1615	‘ Who am I ? Why am I here ? ’
68678	68732	68734	68738	the woman in the glass	3269	‘ To live is to suffer ; why do you let me live ? Must I go on looking back at you until my eyes are faded , my lashes are grey , until I have run through the gamut of mental and physical pain ? I am a living , suffering entity , ’
68740	68834	68734	68738	the woman in the glass	3269	‘ in a world of artificial laws ; of laws made for man 's convenience and pleasure , not for mine . Have I one thing for which I have longed ? Have I a human love , have I the hope of immortality , have I even tasted the intoxication of achievement ? Human life is but a moment in the æons of time , and yet one little human lifetime contains an eternity of suffering . Why , since you take joy from me , why do you let me live ? ’
68934	68949	68950	68950	she	273	‘ To strive , to seek , to find , and not to yield , ’
68993	69031	69033	69033	Mary	273	‘ It may be that the gulfs will wash us down , It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles; .... but something ere I end — Some work of noble note may yet be done , ’

69390	69405	69387	69387	she	273	‘ I wonder if love - letters burn better than other kinds of paper ? ’
69442	69448	69449	69449	she	273	‘ It is poetic justice , ’
69453	69474	69449	69449	she	273	‘ and then — I must keep nothing that will remind me of him — nothing — nothing — nothing . ’
69766	69771	69772	69772	she	273	‘ A mere episode , ’
