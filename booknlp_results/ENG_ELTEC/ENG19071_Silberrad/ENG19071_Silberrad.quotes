110	115	108	108	they	163	" one of us . "
163	172	146	149	the eldest Miss Polkington	58	" lunch was always so late on Sunday . "
898	901	886	886	she	60	" eagle , "
955	962	963	963	she	60	" At twelve to - morrow ? "
971	983	963	963	she	60	" Is that when he is coming to see your father ? "
999	1015	963	963	she	60	" I suppose he must see father about it ? We could n't arrange something ? "
1016	1020	1021	1022	Mrs. Polkington	60	" Certainly not , "
1027	1111	1021	1022	Mrs. Polkington	60	" it is not for me to give or refuse consent to your marriage . Of course , Mr. Frazer knows your father does not have good health , or trouble himself to mix much in society here — it is not likely that an old military man should , but in a case like this he would expect to be called upon ; it would have shown a great lack of breeding on Mr. Frazer 's part had he suggested anything different . "
1131	1171	1124	1124	Julia	58	" Twelve is rather an awkward time . A quarter of an hour with father , five minutes — no , ten — with you , half an hour with Violet , altogether brings it very near lunch time . "
1172	1187	1188	1189	Mrs. Polkington	60	" Mr. Frazer will , of course , lunch with us to - morrow , "
1239	1244	1245	1246	Mrs. Polkington	60	" The cold beef , "
1254	1297	1245	1246	Mrs. Polkington	60	" can be hashed ; that and a small boned loin of mutton will do , he would naturally expect to be treated as one of the family ; fortunately the apple tart has not been cut — with a little cream — "
1298	1311	1312	1312	Julia	58	" I thought we were to have the tart to - night , "
1349	1356	1357	1357	she	60	" We ca n't , then , "
1410	1419	1420	1420	she	60	" Is he in the dining - room ? "
1423	1433	1420	1420	she	60	" I hope you lighted the heater , Mary . "
1453	1464	1440	1441	Mrs. Polkington	60	" How tiresome that your father is not back yet ! "
1479	1488	1476	1476	Julia	58	" Are you going down to Mr. Gillat ? "
1493	1508	1510	1510	he	216	" There really is no necessity ; he is perfectly happy with the paper . "
1984	1992	1993	1993	he	66	" Father not in , I hear , "
1996	1999	2000	2000	Julia	58	" No , "
2003	2010	2000	2000	Julia	58	" What a smell there is ! "
2016	2025	2026	2026	he	66	" There 's something gone wrong with Bouquet , "
2035	2038	2085	2085	she	58	" Bouquet Heater "
2064	2066	2000	2000	Julia	58	" Bouquet "
2077	2084	2085	2085	she	58	" I should think there is , "
2111	2121	2122	2122	Johnny	57	" I 'm afraid your father 's having larks , "
2128	2138	2139	2139	Julia	58	" It 's rather a pity if he is , "
2142	2156	2122	2122	Johnny	57	" he has got to see some one on business to - morrow . "
2157	2160	2122	2122	Johnny	57	" Who ? "
2161	2173	2122	2122	Johnny	57	" Mr. Frazer , a clergyman who wants to marry Violet . "
2179	2184	2185	2185	he	66	" Dear , dear ! "
2188	2193	2185	2185	he	66	" No ? Really ? "
2210	2225	2206	2206	he	66	" A wonderful woman ! I always had a great respect for your mother . "
2240	2248	2249	2249	he	66	" And when is it to be ? "
2252	2283	2249	2249	he	66	" Violet says a year 's time ; they could not afford to marry sooner and do it properly , but it will have to be sooner all the same . "
2284	2294	2295	2296	Mr. Gillat	66	" A year is not a very long time , "
2299	2318	2295	2296	Mr. Gillat	66	" they go fast , years ; one almost loses count of them , they go so fast . "
2319	2324	2325	2325	Julia	58	" I dare say , "
2328	2352	2325	2325	Julia	58	" but Violet will have to get married without waiting for the year to pass . We ca n't afford a long engagement . "
2381	2388	2389	2389	she	58	" The sooner Violet is married , "
2392	2524	2389	2389	she	58	" the sooner we can reduce some of the expenses ; we are living beyond our income now — not a great deal , perhaps , still a bit ; Violet 's going would save enough , I believe ; we could catch up then . That is one reason , but the chief is that a long engagement is expensive ; you see , we should have to have meals different , and fires different , and all manner of extras if Mr. Frazer came in and out constantly . We should have to live altogether in a more expensive style ; we might manage it for three months , or six if we were driven to it , but for a year — it is out of the question . "
2525	2528	2529	2530	Mr. Gillat	66	" But , "
2533	2552	2529	2530	Mr. Gillat	66	" if they ca n't afford it ? You said he could not ; he is a curate . "
2553	2619	2620	2621	Mr. Gillat	66	" He must get a living , or a chaplaincy , or something ; or rather , I expect we must get it for him . Oh , no , we have no Church influence , and we do n't know any bishops ; but one can always rake up influence , and get to know people , if one is not too particular how . "
2745	2769	2735	2735	He	66	" I dare say something will be done — I hope it may ; your mother 's a wonderful woman , a wonderful — "
2787	2792	2793	2793	she	58	" That 's father , "
2811	2816	2817	2817	he	66	" Ah — h'm , "
2840	2848	2849	2849	Julia	58	" Come down - stairs , father , "
2852	2858	2849	2849	Julia	58	" Come along , Johnny . "
2921	2924	2925	2925	he	210	" Gillat , "
2933	2940	2925	2925	he	210	" I am a ruined man . "
2941	2944	2945	2946	Mr. Gillat	66	" No ? "
2954	2958	2959	2959	He	210	" Dear me ! "
2998	3008	3009	3009	he	210	" You should n't do it , you know , "
3016	3022	3009	3009	he	210	" you really should n't . "
3023	3027	3028	3029	the Captain	172	" Do it ! "
3032	3036	3028	3029	the Captain	172	" Do what ? "
3052	3059	3060	3060	she	58	" Have five whiskeys and sodas , "
3084	3090	3091	3091	he	210	" And what is five ? "
3096	3103	3104	3104	she	58	" Three too many for you , "
3107	3118	3119	3119	he	210	" Do you mean to insinuate that I am intoxicated ? "
3122	3125	3126	3126	he	210	" Johnny , "
3133	3143	3126	3126	he	210	" my own daughter insinuates that I am intoxicated . "
3144	3147	3148	3148	Julia	58	" No , "
3151	3181	3148	3148	Julia	58	" I do n't ; I say it does not agree with you , and it doesn't — you know you ought not to take more than two glasses . "
3182	3190	3191	3192	Captain Polkington	59	" Is that your opinion , Gillat ? "
3195	3217	3191	3192	Captain Polkington	59	" Is that what you meant ? That I — I should confine myself to two glasses of whiskey and water ? "
3218	3227	3228	3228	Johnny	57	" I was n't thinking of the whiskey , "
3232	3238	3228	3228	Johnny	57	" it was the gees . "
3897	3904	3905	3905	he	57	" We might have a game , "
3924	3938	3905	3905	he	57	" I have nothing in the world that I can call my own , "
3956	3963	3964	3964	he	66	" We might play for paper , "
4214	4221	4222	4222	she	58	" He has been doing something , "
4492	4496	4488	4489	Mr. Gillat	66	" Very true , "
4498	4505	4518	4518	his	210	" Ah , yes , yes , "
4544	4547	4548	4548	he	59	" Gillat , "
4551	4566	4548	4548	he	59	" if you have finished , we may as well go down - stairs . "
4644	4652	4653	4654	her father	210	" Do you want anything , Julia ? "
4663	4678	4653	4654	her father	210	" I 'm busy to - night — I wish you would go away . "
4702	4710	4711	4711	she	58	" I want to talk to you , "
4718	4759	4711	4711	she	58	" You had much better tell me about it , you will be found out , you know ; mother would have guessed there was something wrong to - day if she had not been so busy with Mr. Frazer . "
4760	4766	4767	4768	the Captain	172	" Found out in what ? "
4771	4795	4796	4796	He	172	" I should like to know of what you accuse me — you , my own daughter — this is much , indeed . "
4819	4828	4829	4829	she	58	" You would do better to tell me , "
4832	4849	4829	4829	she	58	" I might be able to help you — Johnny , wo n't you sit down ? "
4896	4904	4905	4905	Julia	58	" It is money , of course , "
4909	4922	4905	4905	Julia	58	" I suppose you lost at the races yesterday — how much ? "
4936	4940	4941	4941	Julia	58	" How much ? "
4949	4955	4956	4957	that gentleman	329	" It was rather much , "
4965	4974	4975	4975	she	58	" How could he have much to lose ? "
4978	4986	4991	4991	she	58	" You could n't , you know , "
4995	5003	4961	4961	Julia	58	father—"unless you borrowed — did you borrow ? "
5004	5009	5010	5010	he	59	" Yes , yes , "
5016	5040	5010	5010	he	59	" I borrowed — that was it ; of course I was going to pay back — I am going to pay back . "
5041	5048	5058	5059	the Captain	172	" From whom did you borrow ? "
5063	5085	5058	5059	the Captain	172	" The cheque — it came a day early — I merely meant to make use of it for the day — "
5086	5090	5091	5091	Julia	58	" The cheque ! "
5098	5129	5091	5091	Julia	58	" The cheque from Slade & Slade that mother was speaking of this morning . Our cheque , the money we have to live on for the next three months ? "
5130	5134	5135	5136	her father	210	" My cheque , "
5146	5176	5135	5136	her father	210	" made out to me — my income that I have a perfect right to spend as I like ; I used my own money for my own purposes . "
5421	5425	5426	5426	he	57	" We thought , "
5442	5465	5426	5426	he	57	" We hoped , that is , we thought perhaps we might raise a trifle , it would n't be much help — "
5485	5494	5495	5495	he	59	" We shall have to manage on credit , "
5498	5508	5495	5495	he	59	" we can get credit for this three months . "
5509	5514	5515	5515	Julia	58	" We ca n't , "
5519	5550	5515	5515	Julia	58	" the greater part of that money was to have paid outstanding bills ; we ca n't live on credit , because we have n't got any to live on . "
5551	5556	5557	5558	her father	210	" That 's nonsense , "
5561	5574	5557	5558	her father	210	" it can be done with care and economy , and retrenchments . "
5587	5592	5593	5593	he	57	" Yes , yes , "
5596	5636	5593	5593	he	57	" one can always retrench ; it is really marvellous how little one can do with , in fact one is better for it ; I feel a different man for having to retrench . Your mother 's a wonderful woman"—he
5649	5682	5686	5686	he	57	tart—"I suppose , though , she would want to make a good appearance just now , with the engagement , Mr. Frazer in and out . It is very unfortunate , very . "
5744	5751	5752	5752	he	57	" They would fetch a trifle , "
5762	5765	5766	5766	Julia	58	" Those ? "
5771	5774	5766	5766	Julia	58	" Yes , "
5779	5845	5775	5776	Mr. Gillat	66	" not a great deal , of course , but it would be a help — it might pay the butcher 's bill . It 's a great thing to have the butcher 's bill paid ; I 've heard my landlady say so ; it gives a standing with the other tradespeople , and that 's what you want — she often says so . "
5846	5857	5858	5858	Julia	58	" You mean you think of selling them for us ? "
5897	5907	5908	5908	she	58	" You wo n't do anything of the kind , "
5911	5915	5908	5908	she	58	" Why not ? "
5916	5928	5890	5890	she	58	" Because we wo n't have it . Pack them up . "
5929	5934	5935	5935	Johnny	57	" Oh , but , "
5938	5972	5935	5935	Johnny	57	" it would be a little help , it would indeed ; they would fetch something , the glasses are good ones , though a bit old - fashioned , and the watch — "
5973	5985	5987	5987	Julia	58	" I do n't care , I wo n't have it , "
6010	6022	6008	6008	herself	58	" Is it that you think I ca n't spare them ? "
6029	6037	6038	6038	he	57	" I can — what an idea , "
6041	6066	6038	6038	he	57	" What do I want with field - glasses , now ? And as to a watch , my time 's nothing to me ! "
6067	6075	6076	6076	Julia	58	" No , I dare say not , "
6093	6098	6099	6099	she	58	" Take it away , "
6102	6112	6099	6099	she	58	" and do n't try to sell a thing . "
6153	6161	6162	6162	he	57	" Why may I not sell anything ? "
6165	6175	6176	6176	she	58	" Because we have not quite come to that , "
6188	6215	6216	6216	she	58	" We have come pretty low , I know , with our dodges and our shifts , but we have n't quite come to depriving you . Johnny"—and
6241	6269	6216	6216	she	58	Gillat—"it 's very good of you to offer ; I 'm grateful to you ; I 'm awfully glad you did it ; you made me ashamed . "
6313	6318	6319	6319	she	58	" Good - bye , "
6327	6340	6319	6319	she	58	" and do n't you let me catch you selling those things . "
6341	6353	6354	6354	he	57	" Oh , I say ! But how will you manage ? "
6357	6382	6319	6319	she	58	" Somehow ; I have got several ideas already ; I 'm better at this sort of game than you are , you know . "
6399	6402	6403	6403	he	59	" Father , "
6406	6433	6403	6403	he	59	" would you mind telling me if you have borrowed any other money ? It would be much simpler if we knew just how we stood . "
6448	6452	6453	6453	he	172	" Your mother , "
6460	6507	6453	6453	he	172	" is such an unreasonable woman ; if she were like you — if she saw things sensibly . But she wo n't , she 'll make a fuss ; she will entirely overlook the fact that it is my own money that I have lost . "
6508	6515	6516	6516	Julia	58	" I am afraid she will , "
6519	6535	6516	6516	Julia	58	" Will you tell me if you lost any one else 's money as well ? "
6536	6542	6543	6544	the Captain	172	" Oh , a trifle , "
6547	6573	6543	6544	the Captain	172	" nothing to speak of yesterday ; I have borrowed a little now and again , at cards and so on ; a trifling accommodation . "
6574	6578	6516	6516	Julia	58	" From whom ? "
6579	6584	6585	6585	Julia	58	" Rawson - Clew . "
6713	6716	6707	6707	he	75	" no . "
7317	7322	7313	7313	she	58	" No , miss , "
7327	7337	7313	7313	she	58	" it 's another gentleman to see the master . "
7338	7341	7342	7342	Julia	58	" Who ? "
7351	7357	7342	7342	Julia	58	" Mr. Rawson - Clew . "
7358	7367	7368	7368	Mary	67	" I do n't know who he is , "
7372	7421	7368	7368	Mary	67	" I 've never set eyes on him before , but he 's a grand sort of gentleman ; I hardly liked to put him in the dining - room , only missis 's orders was ' Mr. Gillat or any gentleman to see the master there . ' "
7451	7459	7460	7460	Mary	67	" I hope I 've done right , "
7463	7467	7460	7460	Mary	67	" Quite right , "
7617	7634	7608	7609	the Captain	172	" The money , sir , the money that your cousin lent — accommodation between gentlemen — "
7646	7689	7690	7690	Julia	58	" Do you take me for an adventurer , a sharper ? I am a soldier , sir , a soldier and a gentleman — at least , I was — I mean I was a soldier , I am a gentleman — "
7736	7739	7740	7740	she	58	" Father , "
7743	7749	7740	7740	she	58	" is anything the matter ? "
7831	7844	7845	7845	she	58	" Is it about the money Mr. Rawson - Clew lent you ? "
8034	8043	8029	8029	she	58	" Have you come to collect the debt ? "
8049	8053	8054	8054	he	393	" Certainly not , "
8058	8062	8054	8054	he	393	" the money — "
8074	8085	8086	8086	he	393	" He thinks I am an adventurer , a sharper , "
8099	8124	8086	8086	he	393	" his intention seems to be a warning not to try to get anything more out of his cousin — something of that sort . "
8133	8140	8141	8141	she	58	" You were going to say , "
8149	8158	8141	8141	she	58	" something about the money , I think ? "
8159	8162	8163	8163	he	393	" No , "
8170	8188	8189	8189	He	393	" I only meant to suggest that this is perhaps rather an unpleasant subject for a lady . "
8207	8212	8213	8213	she	58	" It is unpleasant , "
8216	8247	8213	8213	she	58	" for that reason had we not better get it over quickly ? You have not come to collect the debt , you have come , then , for what ? "
8248	8284	8286	8286	he	393	" To make one or two things plain to Captain Polkington . I believe I have succeeded ; if so , he will no doubt tell you anything you wish to know . Good afternoon , "
8303	8314	8315	8315	she	58	" You do think my father an adventurer , then ? "
8318	8404	8315	8315	she	58	" You think him a sharper and your cousin a gull , and you came to warn him that if he tried to get anything more in future it was you with whom he would have to deal . And the money — you were going to say the money was not what you came for because you never expected to see it again ? But you are wrong there ; you shall see it ; it will be repaid , every penny of it . "
8416	8428	8429	8429	he	75	" I am sorry for any misunderstanding there may have been , "
8432	8445	8447	8447	he	75	" I trust you will trouble yourself no farther in the matter , "
8521	8527	8528	8528	she	58	" He thought us dirt , "
8547	8601	8542	8542	she	58	" And we are pretty much what he thought us ! Father sponged the money , and I decided to myself that the re paying did not much matter . We are , as we looked to him , two grubby little people of doubtful honesty , in a grubby room with Bouquet , "
8879	8885	8869	8869	She	58	" What are you doing ? "
8901	8927	8928	8928	He	59	" Do n't you know it is valuable ? I must keep it ; he ca n't go back on it if he wants to . "
8941	8952	8953	8953	he	59	" I can look the world in the face again , "
8960	8992	8953	8953	he	59	" I am free , free and cleared ; that debt would have hung like a millstone around my neck , but I am free of it ; it is cancelled . "
8993	8996	8997	8997	Julia	58	" Free ! "
9044	9050	9051	9051	she	58	" Your debt is discharged , "
9055	9087	9051	9051	she	58	" but mine is not ; it has been shifted , not cancelled ; it lies with me and Mr. Rawson - Clew now , and it shall be paid somehow . "
9105	9108	9109	9109	he	59	" What ? "
9130	9141	9142	9142	he	59	" It was very heedless of you to tear it , "
9145	9165	9142	9142	he	59	" but fortunately there is no damage done ; it is perfectly valid , all that can be required . "
9220	9223	9211	9211	she	60	they—"you all , "
9224	9230	9211	9211	she	60	" you , at least , "
9231	9238	9211	9211	she	60	" you , my oldest friend , "
9286	9294	9251	9251	She	60	" And the worst of it is , "
9300	9415	9296	9297	Mrs. Polkington	60	" she may have to be away some time . There really seems no one else to go , and one could not leave the poor dear alone at this dull time of the year ; and , after all , Bath is not very far off ; some of Richard 's people live there , too . I should not be surprised if the young people contrive to see a good deal of each other in spite of everything . Indeed , had I not thought so , I think I should have insisted on Chèrie 's going instead of Violet , although she would have had to give up her winter abroad . "
9454	9461	9462	9463	Mrs. Polkington	60	" You do agree with me ? "
9485	9576	9462	9463	Mrs. Polkington	60	" You do think it wrong to allow Chèrie to refuse this invitation for Violet 's sake ? I am very glad you think so . I had quite a difficulty in persuading her ; but , as I told her , it was not a chance she was likely to have again . So she is going , and Violet will have to spend her winter in Bath . Julia ? Oh , Julia was not asked in either case ; she will be staying at home with me . "
10676	10683	10684	10684	he	79	" It was a novelty then , "
10687	10793	10684	10684	he	79	" some novelties are worth a great deal . There 's one I know of now I could do some good business with if I could get hold of it . But I ca n't ; the old fool that 's got it wo n't sell it for any price , and he ca n't half work it himself . It 's a blue daffodil — Narcissus Triandrus Azureum he calls it ; or rather , to give it its full title , Narcissus Triandrus Azureum Vrouw Van Heigen ; so called , I believe , in honour of his wife , or his mother . "
10813	10820	10821	10821	she	58	" Is he a bulb grower ? "
10833	10836	10821	10821	she	58	" Yes , "
10840	10892	10837	10837	Cross	79	" a Dutch bulb grower ; that 's why he wo n't make the profit he might ; he comes of generations of growers , and they venerate their bulbs . He has cranky notions of how things ought to be done , and no other way will do for him . "
10893	10914	10821	10821	she	58	" How did he get a blue daffodil ? Do you think it is real ? It seems very unusual . "
10915	10985	10821	10821	she	58	" It is unusual ; that 's where the value comes in ; but it 's real fast enough , though I do n't believe he grew the first , as he says , in his own garden . It 's my opinion that one of his collectors sent him the first bulb ; he has collectors all over the world , you know , looking for new things . "
10986	10996	10997	10997	Julia	58	" What is he going to do with it ? "
11000	11099	10997	10997	Julia	58	" He is multiplying it at present ; at first he had only one , now , of course , he has a few more ; when he has got enough he will hybridise . You do n't know what that is . Cross - breed with it ; use the blue with the old yellow daffodil as parents to new varieties . That 's ticklish work ; growers ca n't afford to do it till they have a fair number of the new sort ; but , of course , they occasionally get something good that way . "
11126	11137	11138	11138	she	58	" Will he never sell any of his blue bulbs ? "
11141	11149	11138	11138	she	58	" Oh , yes , in time , "
11153	11166	11150	11150	Cross	79	" but not while they are worth anything much to the growers . "
11167	11187	10997	10997	Julia	58	" What are they worth ? I mean , what would it be worth if there was only one ? "
11188	11207	11150	11150	Cross	79	" I do n't know ; I dare say I could get £ 400 for the single bulb . "
11208	11233	11150	11150	Cross	79	" But if there were more they would not be worth so much ? If there were five , what would they be worth ? "
11234	11266	10997	10997	Julia	58	" Pretty well as much , very likely £ 300 for one bulb . Van Heigen would give a written guarantee with it not to sell another bulb to another grower . "
11267	11276	11277	11277	Julia	58	" But he could keep the others himself ? "
11280	11295	11296	11296	she	58	" That would be eating his cake and having it too . Tell me , "
11314	11328	11329	11329	Cross	79	" if there were ten bulbs , what could you get for one . "
11336	11345	11346	11346	he	79	" A hundred pounds , I dare say , "
11349	11464	11346	11346	he	79	" but I shall never have the chance . The trade will never touch those blue daffodils while they are worth having . When the old man does begin to sell them — when they are worth very little to the growers — he will sell to collectors , cranky old connoisseurs , from choice . That 's what I mean when I say he does n't understand business as business ; he would rather sell his precious blue daffodils where they were what he calls ' appreciated . ' He would sooner they went for a moderate price to people who would worship them , than make an enormous profit out of them . "
11465	11473	11474	11474	Julia	58	" But the connoisseurs could sell them , "
11477	11502	11474	11474	Julia	58	" If I were a connoisseur and bought one when they were for sale , I could sell it to you if I liked . "
11503	11511	11512	11512	Cross	79	" Yes , but you would n't , "
11515	11562	11512	11512	Cross	79	" if you were a connoisseur you would not dream of parting with your bulb . You would n't have the slightest wish to make a hundred per cent . on your purchase , or two or three hundred either . Also I should n't buy . "
11563	11567	11474	11474	Julia	58	" Why not ? "
11568	11583	11512	11512	Cross	79	" I could n't afford to have my name mixed up with the business . "
11590	11604	11605	11605	she	58	" You could afford that the business should be done without your name ? "
11611	11632	11608	11608	He	79	" I could introduce the seller , did such an impossible person exist , to some one who could buy . "
11657	11665	11666	11666	she	58	" For a consideration , of course , "
11669	11678	11666	11666	she	58	" Something would naturally stick to my fingers , "
12103	12114	12115	12115	She	58	" It is so much more original to go there . "
12490	12493	12494	12494	she	58	" Johnny , "
12507	12517	12494	12494	she	58	" I am going to pay for my ticket . "
12568	12579	12565	12565	she	58	" Then I wo n't let you come with me ; "
12609	12614	12615	12615	she	58	" Oh , no , "
12618	12633	12615	12615	she	58	" mother and the girls think it is a good thing I am going . "
12634	12643	12644	12644	Johnny	57	" Your father and I will miss you , "
12648	12651	12644	12644	Johnny	57	" You ? "
12652	12760	12615	12615	she	58	" Yes ; I 'll miss you very much — we both shall ; we shall sit down - stairs , each side of the fire - place , and think how you used to come there sometimes . And when I wait in the dining - room when your father 's not at home , I 'll remember how you used to come down there and chat . We had many a chat , did n't we?—you and me , and Bouquet burning between us — there was nobody could trim Bouquet like you . But perhaps you 'll be back before winter comes round again ? "
12761	12772	12775	12775	Julia	58	" I do n't know when I shall be back , "
12853	12867	12868	12869	Mr. Gillat	66	" It wo n't be at all the same at No . 27 , "
12873	12928	12868	12869	Mr. Gillat	66	" Your mother — she 's a wonderful woman , a wonderful woman , and Miss Violet 's a fine girl , so 's the other , handsome both of them ; but they 're in the drawing - room , you know , and you — you used to come down - stairs . "
13116	13158	13159	13159	Johnny	57	" She shall haf one cabin to herself , a bed clean . Yes , yes ; there is no passenger but one , a Holland gentleman ; he will not speak with the miss , he is friend of captain . "
13216	13220	13221	13221	he	57	" A keepsake , "
13273	13277	13269	13270	some one	3318	" Look out , "
13283	13287	13269	13270	some one	3318	" Hold up , "
13332	13337	13338	13338	he	57	" Good - bye , "
13341	13346	13347	13347	she	58	" Good - bye , "
13350	13357	13347	13347	she	58	" Oh , do be careful ! "
14133	14143	14144	14146	the old lady	553	" There goes Vrouw Van Heigen 's English miss , "
14157	14172	14144	14146	the old lady	553	" She has been marketing , I see ; she seems a good housewife . "
14173	14180	14181	14181	Denah	61	" She walks in the road , "
14185	14205	14181	14181	Denah	61	" It is so conspicuous , I could not do it ; besides , one might be run over . "
14206	14215	14216	14217	her sister	556	" The English always walk in the road , "
14220	14241	14216	14217	her sister	556	" they think everything will get out of their way , and they do not at all mind being conspicuous . "
14242	14249	14250	14250	Denah	61	" The English miss should mind , "
14253	14278	14250	14250	Denah	61	" for she is not pretty ; no one looks at her to admire ; besides she is poor and has to work hard . "
14279	14284	14285	14286	her mother	195	" Yes , yes , "
14290	14362	14285	14286	her mother	195	" she is a fine worker . Vrouw Van Heigen is full of her praises ; such a cook — she has twenty new dishes , and everything is done quickly , one can not tell how ; it is like having a magician in the house , so she says . Ah , there is Herr Van de Greutz 's Marthe going into the apothecary 's . I wonder now — "
14421	14429	14430	14430	she	195	" I will help you with these , "
14433	14440	14430	14430	she	195	" then we can go out . "
14450	14464	14465	14465	she	195	" It is strange how much Vrouw Van Heigen thinks of that girl , "
14468	14513	14465	14465	she	195	" She has been there but one month and already there is no one like her . She does not keep her in her place very well ; were she a daughter more could not be said . I wonder how Mijnheer likes it . "
14514	14522	14523	14523	Anna	61	" It was Mijnheer who engaged her , "
14526	14602	14523	14523	Anna	61	" It is not likely that he regrets . I hear that she has written some English letters for him since one of the clerks has been ill . My father says she can cook like a Frenchwoman , and that is something . As for Joost , it is surely of little importance to him , he is too quiet to say anything to her ; she talks little ; she must be shy . "
14641	14809	14638	14638	she	61	" That girl has no accomplishments ; she is as old - fashioned as our Aunt Barje , a huisvrouw , no more . It is strange , for the English women make fun of us for this , and pretend that they are educated and advanced above us ; she is not , she can do nothing but speak a few languages ; she can not sing nor play , she has read no science , she can not draw , nor model in wax , nor make paper flowers , nor do bead work ; she could not even crochet till I showed her how . I wonder if she has made any progress with the pattern I gave her . Shall we go and see by and by ? I might set her right if she is in a difficulty , and we could at the same time inquire after Mevrouw 's throat ; she had a weakness , I noticed , on Tuesday . "
15058	15063	15064	15064	she	86	" Julia , Julia , "
15067	15077	15064	15064	she	86	" bring lemonade , bring glasses and the lemonade . "
15539	15542	15544	15544	Denah	61	" Why , "
15546	15571	15572	15572	Julia	58	" I have done already almost half a metre of the piece I began at the same time . Is it difficult for you ? "
15600	15604	15605	15605	Anna	61	" For yourself ? "
15608	15615	15605	15605	Anna	61	" Do you make your dresses ? "
15616	15622	15623	15623	Julia	58	" This is for Mevrouw , "
15626	15634	15623	15623	Julia	58	" but I can make my own . "
16075	16080	16068	16068	she	576	" we must see . "
16863	16869	16860	16860	he	90	" Now we will pray , "
17607	17619	17620	17620	he	90	" Each little seed will be a bulb by and by , "
17623	17671	17620	17620	he	90	" but not yet . When we cut the root first , we set it in the ground and these begin to grow and become in time as you see them now . Afterwards they grow bigger and bigger till their parent can no longer contain them . "
17672	17684	17685	17685	Julia	58	" Does it take long for them to grow full size ? "
17688	17700	17701	17701	Mijnheer	90	" It takes five years to grow the finest hyacinth bulbs , "
17704	17898	17701	17701	Mijnheer	90	" but inferior ones are more quick . And when the bulb is grown , there is one bloom — fine , magnificent , a truss of flowers — after that it deteriorates , it is , one may say , over . Ah , but it is magnificent while it is there ! There is no flower like the hyacinth ; had I my way , I would grow nothing else , but people will not have them now . They must have novelties . ' Give us narcissus , ' they say ; ' they are so graceful'—I do not see the grace—'Or iris'—well , some are fine , I allow , but they do not last in bloom as do hyacinths . The mourn iris of Persia is very beautiful ; we have not one flowering yet , but we shall have by and by . I will show you then ; you will think it very handsome . When it blooms I go to it in the morning and dust the sand from the petals . I feel that I can reverence that flower ; it is most beautiful . "
17899	17905	17906	17906	Julia	58	" Is it very scarce ? "
17909	17912	17906	17906	Julia	58	" Somewhat , "
17916	17960	17961	17961	He	90	" but we have things that are more so , we have many novelties so called . Ah , but we have one novelty that is a true one , it is a wonder , it has no price , it is priceless ! "
17971	17995	17961	17961	He	90	" It is the greatest rarity that has ever been reared in Holland , a miracle , in fact — a blue daffodil ! "
18139	18152	18153	18155	the old man	441	" Would you like to know the name which it will immortalise ? "
18160	18171	18153	18155	the old man	441	" It is called Narcissus Triandrus Azurem Vrouw Van Heigen . "
18172	18184	18185	18185	Julia	58	" You named it in honour of Mevrouw , I suppose ? "
18188	18196	18185	18185	Julia	58	" I did not ; Joost did . "
18197	18201	18202	18202	she	58	" Mijnheer Joost ? "
18205	18208	18209	18210	the father	608	" Yes , "
18213	18345	18209	18210	the father	608	" It is his , not mine ; to him belongs the honour . It is he who has produced this marvel . How ? That is a secret ; perhaps even I could not tell you if I would ; Nature is wonderful in her ways ; we can only help her , we can not create . Yes , yes , it is Joost who has done this . He seemed to you a retiring youth ? Yet he is the most envied and most honoured man of our profession . I would sooner — there are many men in Holland who would sooner — have produced this flower than have a thousand pounds . And he is my son — you may well believe that I am proud . "
18757	18769	18754	18754	he	90	" You would perhaps prefer I did not walk with you ? "
18770	18775	18776	18776	she	415	" Oh , no , "
18783	18800	18776	18776	she	415	" I shall be pleased , if you are going the same way , that is . "
18808	18817	18818	18818	he	90	" You are sure you do not mind ? "
18821	18830	18818	18818	he	90	" It is a little conspicuous for you . "
18842	18852	18853	18853	she	415	" I am afraid I am conspicuous , anyhow , "
18966	18971	18972	18972	she	415	" Pray , Mijnheer , "
19010	19031	18981	18981	her	415	" will you not walk the other side of the way ? Then you will not be conspicuous at all . "
19032	19039	19040	19040	he	90	" I do not mind it , "
19206	19220	19221	19221	she	58	" I think this is the most beautiful town I was ever in , "
19229	19235	19236	19236	he	684	" Do you like it ? "
19239	19257	19236	19236	he	684	" It must be quite unlike what you are used to , all of it must be . "
19258	19262	19263	19263	she	58	" It is , "
19266	19284	19263	19263	she	58	" all of it , as you say — the place , the ways , the people . "
19285	19309	19310	19310	She	58	" And you like it ? You do not think it — you do not think us what you call slow , stupid ? "
19339	19342	19343	19343	she	58	" No , "
19346	19402	19343	19343	she	58	" I admire it all very much , it is sincere , no one appears other than he is , or aims at being or seeming more . Your house is the same back and front , and you , none of you have a wrong side , the whole life is solid right through . "
19425	19434	19435	19435	he	684	" I fear I do not understand you , "
19438	19453	19435	19435	he	684	" it is difficult when we do not know each other 's language perfectly . "
19454	19461	19462	19462	Julia	58	" We know it very well , "
19465	19492	19462	19462	Julia	58	" as well as possible . If we were born in the same place , in the same house , we should not understand it better . "
19508	19515	19516	19516	he	684	" You think I am stupid ? "
19558	19638	19552	19552	he	684	" Often I wonder what you think of , you have such great , shining eyes , they eat up everything ; they see everything and through everything , I think . They sweep round the room , or the persons or the place , and gather all — may I say it?—like some fine net — to me it seems they draw all things into your brain , and there you weave them and weave them into thoughts . "
19715	19724	19725	19725	she	58	" You seem to think me very clever , "
19728	19732	19733	19733	he	90	" Of course , "
19737	19742	19733	19733	he	90	" you are clever . "
19743	19750	19751	19751	she	58	" No , I am not , "
19754	19826	19751	19751	she	58	" ask your mother ; ask Denah Snieder ; they do not think me clever . What can I do , except cook ? Oh , yes , and speak a few foreign language as you can yourself ? I can not paint , or draw , or sing ; I do not understand music ; why , when you play Bach , I wish to go out of the room . "
19827	19832	19833	19833	he	90	" That is true , "
19836	19842	19833	19833	he	90	" I have felt it . "
19876	19885	19886	19886	she	58	" It is absurd to call me clever , "
19889	19924	19886	19886	she	58	" I have little learning and no accomplishments . I can not even get on with the crochet work Denah showed me , and I do not know how to make flowers of paper . "
19925	19935	19936	19936	he	90	" But why should one make flowers of paper ? "
19944	19952	19936	19936	he	90	" They are not at all beautiful . "
19953	19959	19960	19960	she	58	" Denah makes them beautifully , "
20009	20033	20001	20001	Joost	90	" I think sometimes you must make fun of us ; do you not sometimes in your heart laugh just a little bit ? "
20034	20041	20042	20042	she	58	" I laugh at everything sometimes , "
20045	20160	20042	20042	she	58	" myself most of all . Do you never laugh at yourself ? I expect not ; you are very serious . I will tell you what it is like : a little goblin comes out of your head and stands in front of you ; the goblin is you , a sort of you ; the other part , the part people know , sits opposite , and the goblin laughs at it because it sees how ridiculous the other is , how grotesque and how futile . My goblin came out into my room last night and laughed and laughed ; you would almost have heard him if you had been there . "
21433	21439	21440	21440	Denah	61	" Ah , the wood ! "
21448	21462	21440	21440	Denah	61	" The beautiful wood ! Miss Julia , do you not love it ? "
21475	21505	21469	21469	Denah	61	" You can not love it as I do ; I think I am a child of Nature , nothing would please me more than always to live here . "
21506	21517	21518	21518	Julia	58	" You would have to go into the town sometimes , "
21521	21536	21518	21518	Julia	58	" to buy gloves ; the ones you have would not last for ever . "
21576	21583	21569	21573	one of the little girls	767	" Music — I hear music ! "
21588	21591	21585	21586	the ladies	769	" Delicious ! "
21595	21599	21585	21586	the ladies	769	" How beautiful ! "
21611	21625	21626	21626	Julia	58	" Music in the wood ! Ah , exquisite ! two beauties together ! "
21862	21873	21874	21874	Anna	61	" Do they have such picnics as this in England ? "
21887	21895	21896	21896	Julia	58	" I have never been to one , "
21933	21936	21938	21939	Vrouw Snieder	84	" Ah ! "
21941	21957	21958	21958	Julia	58	" then it is all the more of a pleasure and a novelty to you . "
22283	22296	22297	22297	she	58	" Shall we not go back to where the music is playing ? "
22339	22344	22345	22345	they	783	" There is Mevrouw , "
22348	22373	22345	22345	they	783	" She is calling us . The carriage is ready , too ; oh , do you think it is already time to go ? "
22426	22438	22439	22439	Denah	61	" Good - bye , beautiful wood , good - bye ! "
22449	22463	22439	22439	Denah	61	" Oh , if one could but remain here till the moon rose ! "
22464	22471	22472	22473	her mother	195	" It would be very damp , "
22476	22482	22472	22473	her mother	195	" The dew would fall . "
22533	22549	22530	22530	Anna	61	" An Englishman ! Look , look , Miss Julia , a compatriot of yours ! "
22621	22628	22629	22629	Anna	61	" He walks like an Englishman , "
22632	22642	22629	22629	Anna	61	" as if all the world belonged to him . "
22643	22649	22650	22650	Denah	61	" And looks like one , "
22653	22672	22650	22650	Denah	61	" he has no moustache , and wears a glass in his eye , look , Miss Julia . "
22770	22777	22778	22778	Anna	61	" Is he not an Englishman ? "
22781	22784	22785	22785	she	61	" Yes , "
22788	22798	22785	22785	she	61	" one could not mistake him for anything else . "
22799	22812	22813	22813	Anna	61	" I wonder if he recognised you as a country - woman , "
22947	22954	22943	22943	she	61	" Miss Julia knows that Englishman . "
22968	22974	22975	22975	she	61	" Did she tell you ? "
22978	22981	22982	22982	Denah	61	" No , "
22988	23012	22982	22982	Denah	61	" she would not tell any one , she wishes it concealed ; she thinks it is so , but I saw it . "
23039	23047	23048	23048	she	61	" Why should she wish it concealed ? "
23051	23058	23048	23048	she	61	" I do not know why , "
23062	23100	23059	23059	Denah	61	" that remains to be seen . As for how I know it , I saw it in her face ; when she looked at him her lips became set , and her eyes — she looked — "
23113	23163	23101	23101	She	61	" She looked as if she would bite with annoyance that he should be here . The expression was gone in a moment ; she spoke with an ease and naturalness that was astonishing , even disgusting ; but it had been there . I do not trust her . "
23199	23202	23185	23185	she	61	" fancy . "
23203	23210	23211	23211	she	61	" You read too many romances , "
23214	23269	23211	23211	she	61	" your head is full of such things . I do not believe Miss Julia knew the Englishman , she would not have hidden from us her knowledge if she did ; it is not so easy to hide one 's feelings in the flash of an eye , besides there was no reason . Also"—this
23272	23312	23321	23321	she	61	afterthought—"he was a man of good family ; you could see at a glance that he was of the aristocracy , while she is a paid companion to Vrouw Van Heigen ; she could never before have met him . "
23326	23331	23321	23321	she	61	" I mistrust her . "
24288	24295	24296	24296	She	58	" Will you not catch cold ? "
24305	24328	24302	24302	he	77	" What are you doing ? Thinking ? Weaving in your head all that you have seen and heard to - day ? "
24329	24332	24333	24333	she	58	" No , "
24336	24343	24333	24333	she	58	" I was thinking about courage . "
24344	24347	24348	24348	he	77	" Courage ? "
24353	24398	24399	24399	Joost	77	" Yes , it is very different in different places ; some people are afraid to tell the truth , so they lie ; and some are afraid to be dishonest , so they are honest ; I believe it depends partly on fashion . "
24408	24417	24418	24418	he	77	" Such things can not depend on fashion , "
24422	24429	24430	24430	Julia	58	" I am not so sure , "
24433	24571	24430	24430	Julia	58	" lots of things you would not expect depend on it . I know people who sometimes go without the food they want so that they can buy expensive cakes to show off when their acquaintances come to tea — that 's silly , is n't it ? Then I know other people who blush if a pair of breeches , or something equally inoffensive , are mentioned ; that seems equally silly . One lot of people is ashamed to be seen eating bread - and - cheese suppers , another lot is ashamed to be seen walking off the side - walk , and with no gloves on . One would hardly expect in , yet I almost believe these silly little things somehow make a difference to what the people think right and wrong . "
24588	24594	24595	24595	he	77	" Are you making fun ? "
24598	24622	24595	24595	he	77	" I do not know when you are making fun ; I think you must be now . Are you speaking of us ? "
24623	24635	24636	24636	Julia	58	" I never felt less like making fun in my life , "
24660	24665	24666	24666	he	77	" I am sorry , "
24669	24709	24666	24666	he	77	" you are unhappy , and I have intruded upon you ; will you forgive me ? You are thinking of your home , no doubt ; you have not had a letter from England for a long time . "
24720	24728	24729	24729	she	58	" I did not expect a letter , "
24732	24764	24729	24729	she	58	" my eldest sister was married last week , there would be no time to write to me till everything was over ; most likely I shall hear to - morrow . "
24765	24771	24772	24772	he	77	" Is your sister married ? "
24775	24785	24772	24772	he	77	" and you were not able to be present ? "
24786	24797	24798	24798	Julia	58	" It is too far to go home from here , "
24804	24812	24798	24798	Julia	58	" Were you going to the barns ? "
24813	24816	24817	24817	he	77	" Yes , "
24842	24848	24838	24838	he	77	" Will you come too ? "
24984	24990	24991	24991	Julia	58	" I like these barns , "
24997	25011	24991	24991	Julia	58	" they are so big and quiet and orderly , somehow so respectable . "
25012	25015	25016	25016	he	77	" Respectable ! "
25029	25039	25021	25021	he	77	" Is that what you like ? The respectable ? "
25040	25053	25021	25021	he	77	" Yes , in its place ; and its place is here . "
25054	25060	25091	25091	she	58	" You think us respectable ? "
25061	25080	25081	25081	She	58	" Well , are you not ? I think you are the most respectable people in the world . "
25094	25105	25106	25106	she	58	" You are going here , too , I suppose ? "
25109	25116	25117	25117	he	77	" I will just look round , "
25161	25180	25158	25158	he	77	" It is a rat , you must not be afraid ; it will not run this way . "
25181	25187	25188	25188	Julia	58	" I am not afraid , "
25193	25203	25158	25158	he	77	" Do you think I am afraid of rats ? "
25204	25209	25158	25158	he	77	" Girls often are . "
25210	25217	25223	25223	her	58	" Well , I am not , "
25231	25242	25243	25243	he	77	" Would you be afraid to come out here alone ? "
25247	25250	25251	25251	she	58	" No , "
25254	25275	25251	25251	she	58	" any night that you like I will come here alone , go through the barns and fasten the doors . "
25276	25290	25291	25291	he	77	" I do not believe there are many girls who would do that , "
25327	25373	25324	25324	he	77	" I think girls are usually brought up with too much protection ; I mean girls of our class , they are too much shielded ; one has them for the house only ; if they were flowers I would call them stove - plants . "
25377	25387	25388	25388	she	58	" You believe in the emancipation of women then ? "
25391	25412	25388	25388	she	58	" you would rather a woman could take care of herself , and not be afraid , than be womanly ? "
25413	25416	25417	25417	he	77	" No , "
25420	25433	25417	25417	he	77	" I would like them to be both , as you are . "
25459	25462	25463	25463	she	58	" I ? "
25466	25504	25463	25463	she	58	" you seem to think me a paragon — clever , brave , womanly . Do you know what I really am ? I am bad ; by a long way the wickedest person you have known . "
25791	25799	25801	25801	Mijnheer	90	" You have good news from home ? "
25803	25809	25801	25801	Mijnheer	90	" your parents are well ? "
25810	25817	25818	25818	Julia	58	" Quite well , thank you , "
25848	25952	25953	25953	Julia	58	" It is , of course , as your mother says , less expensive , but at such a time who would spare expense — if it were the fashion ? I assure you I had literally nothing to eat at the time , or afterwards ; your mother thinking it advisable as soon as we were alone , to put away the cakes for future visitors . At such a time , when a man 's feelings are nearly touched , he needs support ; I did not have it , and I can not say that I have felt myself since . "
26027	26034	26035	26035	she	58	" Everything went off very well , "
26066	26070	26071	26071	he	90	" Did it ? "
26074	26093	26094	26094	Julia	58	" I am very glad . They must have missed you much , and thought often of you . "
26101	26167	26097	26097	Chèrie	64	" I must say I think it is a pity you were not here ; it is important to have some one with a head in the background ; mother and I had to be the fore , so of course we could not do it ; if you had been here several things would have gone better , and some waste have been saved . "
27079	27082	27077	27077	Julia	58	" damned fool "
27141	27146	27136	27138	the peasant women	890	" Are you hurt ? "
27168	27171	27172	27172	she	58	" No , "
27209	27214	27215	27215	she	58	" My good women , "
27234	27290	27215	27215	she	58	" there is nothing the matter , there is no reason why you should stand there and look at me ; I assure you no one has been hurt , and no one is going to be ; you had much better go on your way , as I shall do . Good - afternoon . "
27397	27401	27416	27417	the waggoner	896	" mad English . "
27760	27768	27769	27769	he	804	" I hope you are not hurt , "
27781	27784	27785	27785	she	58	" No , "
27788	27793	27785	27785	she	58	" thanks to you — "
27882	27887	27888	27888	he	804	" It 's nothing , "
27891	27935	27888	27888	he	804	" I am glad to have had the opportunity , especially since it also gives me the opportunity of offering you some apology for an unfortunate misunderstanding which arose when last I saw you . You must feel that it needs an apology . "
27986	27992	27993	27993	she	58	" Please do not apologise , "
27996	28006	27993	27993	she	58	" there is no need , I quite understand . "
28007	28016	28017	28019	Rawson - Clew	75	" I was labouring under a false impression , "
28025	28029	28030	28030	she	58	" I know , "
28033	28057	28030	28030	she	58	" but it is cleared up now ; no one who spoke with my father could possibly imagine he lived by his wits . "
28107	28113	28114	28114	he	75	" Here is your basket , "
28117	28125	28114	28114	he	75	" I think it is clean now . "
28188	28193	28194	28194	he	75	" You are hurt , "
28197	28229	28194	28194	he	75	" No , I 'm not , nothing to speak of ; it only hurts me when I move that arm ; I will carry the basket with the other hand . "
28230	28238	28239	28239	She	58	" How far have you to go ? "
28248	28258	28259	28259	he	75	" You had better go straight home at once , "
28262	28269	28270	28270	she	58	" I ca n't do that , "
28306	28319	28320	28320	she	58	" My shoulder does not hurt if I do not move it , "
28323	28334	28320	28320	she	58	" I can carry the basket with the other hand . "
28335	28347	28348	28348	he	75	" Perhaps you will allow me to carry it for you ? "
28351	28359	28348	28348	he	75	" I am going the same way . "
28360	28366	28367	28367	she	58	" No , thank you , "
28370	28403	28404	28404	She	58	" Thanks very much for the offer , but there is n't any need ; I can manage quite well . I expect you will want to go faster than I do . "
28432	28440	28441	28441	she	58	" Oh , there 's the brandy , "
28444	28452	28441	28441	she	58	" I must n't go without that . "
28475	28481	28482	28482	he	75	" I will carry this , "
28485	28514	28482	28482	he	75	" if our pace does not agree , if you would prefer to walk more slowly , I will wait for you at the beginning of the village . "
28761	28769	28770	28770	she	58	" I am afraid you are right , "
28773	28805	28770	28770	she	58	" there is a great deal of it gone ; still , that is not without advantage — I shall be sent to take some more in a day or two . "
28806	28811	28812	28812	he	75	" You wish that ? "
28815	28818	28819	28819	she	58	" Yes , "
28822	28837	28819	28819	she	58	" I find the exercise beneficial ; I have had too much pudding lately . "
28850	28856	28857	28857	she	58	" It is very wholesome , "
28860	28912	28857	28857	she	58	" but a bit stodgy ; I think it is too really good to be taken in such large quantities by any one like me . It is unbelievably good , it makes one perfectly ashamed of oneself ; and unbelievably narrow , it makes one long for bed - time . "
28945	28954	28955	28955	she	58	" Did you think I meant actual pudding ? "
28958	28988	28955	28955	she	58	" I did n't ; I meant just the whole life here ; if you knew the people well , the real middle class ones , you would understand . "
28989	29000	29001	29001	he	75	" I think I can understand without knowing them well , "
29004	29028	29001	29001	he	75	" I fancy there is a good deal of pudding about ; in fact , I myself am feeling its rather oppressive influence . "
29029	29037	29038	29038	Julia	58	" The town is paved with it , "
29041	29071	29038	29038	Julia	58	" I thought so this afternoon . I also thought , though it is Tuesday , it was just like a spring Sunday ; every day is like that . "
29083	29088	29089	29089	Julia	58	" So do I , "
29092	29141	29089	29089	Julia	58	" but in moderation ; you ca n't do your washing on Sunday , nor your harvesting in spring . An endless succession of spring Sundays is very awkward when you have got — well , week - day work to do , do n't you think so ? "
29163	29172	29173	29173	he	75	" Are you living with a Dutch family ? "
29179	29183	29184	29184	she	58	" As companion , "
29187	29194	29184	29184	she	58	" sort of superior general servant . "
29195	29223	29228	29228	he	75	" Indeed ? Then it must have been you I saw yesterday ; I thought so at the time ; you were driving with some Dutch ladies . "
29235	29243	29244	29244	she	58	" We went for an excursion yesterday , "
29247	29254	29244	29244	she	58	" they called it a picnic . "
29502	29511	29512	29512	he	75	" You must find Dutch conventionality rather trying , "
29517	29526	29527	29527	she	58	" I am not used to it yet , "
29530	29545	29527	29527	she	58	" when I am it will be no worse than the conventionality at home . "
29564	29567	29568	29568	he	75	" Surely , "
29571	29584	29568	29568	he	75	" you have not found these absurd rules and restrictions in England ? "
29585	29668	29562	29562	Bohemian	102	" Not the same ones ; we study appearances one way , and they do another ; but it comes to the same thing , so far as I am concerned . One day I hope to be able to give it up and retire ; when I do I shall wear corduroy breeches and if I happen to be in the kitchen eating onions when people come to see me , I shall call them in and offer them a share . "
29669	29679	29680	29680	he	75	" Rather an uncomfortable ambition , is n't that ? "
29683	29730	29680	29680	he	75	" I am afraid you will have to wait some time for its fulfilment , especially the corduroy . I doubt if you will achieve that this side the grave , though you might perhaps make a provision in your will to be buried in it . "
29736	29774	29731	29731	Julia	58	" You think my family would object ? They would ; but , you see , I should be retiring from them as well as from the world , the corduroy might be part of my bulwarks . "
29775	29802	29680	29680	he	75	" I do n't think you could afford it even for that ; do you think women ever can afford that kind of disregard for appearances ? "
29803	29808	29809	29809	she	58	" Plain ones can , "
29812	29858	29809	29809	she	58	" it is the only compensation they have for being plain ; not much , certainly , seeing what they lose , but they have it . When you can never look more than indifferent , it does not matter how much less you look . "
29859	29867	29680	29680	he	75	" That is a rather unusual idea , "
29871	29882	29680	29680	he	75	" it appears sound in theory , but in practice — "
29883	29887	29888	29888	she	58	" Sounder still , "
29895	29907	29908	29908	he	918	" I 'm afraid you wo n't make many converts here , "
29911	29947	29908	29908	he	918	" where nearly every woman is plain , and according to your experience , every one , men and women too , think a great deal of looks ; at all events , correct ones . "
29948	29954	29680	29680	he	75	" They do do that , "
29958	30014	29908	29908	he	918	" they just worship propriety and the correct , and have the greatest notion of the importance of their neighbours ' eyes . It is a perfect treat to be out alone , and not have to regard them — this is the first time I have been out alone since I have been here . "
30015	30030	29908	29908	he	918	" Rather hard ; I thought every one had — er — time off . "
30031	30036	30037	30037	she	58	" An evening out ? "
30040	30120	30037	30037	she	58	" I believe the number of evenings out is regulated by the number of applications for the post when vacant ; cooks could get more evenings than housemaids , and nursery governesses might naturally expect a minus number , if that were possible . There would be lots of applications for my post , so I ca n't expect many evenings ; however , I have thought of a plan by which I can get out again and again ! "
30121	30127	30128	30128	he	919	" What will you do ? "
30131	30212	30128	30128	he	919	" I shall get Denah — she is one of the girls who went for the excursion — to come and teach Mevrouw a new crochet pattern after dinner of a day . It will take ages , Mevrouw learns very slowly , and Denah will know better than to hurry matters ; she admires Mijnheer Joost , the Van Heigens ' son , and she will be only too delighted to have an excuse to come to the house . "
30213	30239	30240	30240	Julia	58	" And if she is there you will have a little leisure ? Some one always has to be on duty ? Is that it ? "
30244	30250	30251	30251	she	58	" If she is there , "
30254	30312	30251	30251	she	58	" she will want me out of the way , and I am not satisfactorily out of the way when I am anywhere on the premises . Not that Mijnheer Joost talks to me when I am there , or would talk to her if I were not ; she just mistrusts every unmarried female by instinct . "
30313	30326	30327	30329	Rawson - Clew	75	" A girl 's instinct in such matters is not always wrong , "
30348	30360	30361	30361	she	58	" I should not think of interfering in such an affair , "
30364	30477	30361	30361	she	58	" why , it would be the most suitable thing in the world , as suitable as it is for my handsome and able sister to marry the ambitious and able nephew of a bishop ; they are the two halves that make one whole . Denah and Joost would live a perfectly ideal pudding life ; he with his flowers — that is his work , you know ; he cares for nothing besides , really — and she with her housekeeping . He with a little music for relaxation , she with her neighbours and accomplishments ; it would be as neat and complete and suitable as anything could be . "
30478	30500	30344	30344	he	75	" And that commends it to you ? I should have imagined that what was incongruous and odd pleased you better . "
30501	30507	30361	30361	she	58	" I like that too , "
30514	30566	30508	30508	she	920	" though best when the people concerned do n't see the incongruity ; but I do n't really care either way , whether things are incongruous or suitable , I enjoy both , and should never interfere so long as they do n't upset my concerns and the end in view . "
30628	30637	30638	30638	he	921	" Have you usually an end in view ? "
30641	30646	30647	30647	she	920	" Have not you ? "
30662	30670	30647	30647	she	920	" eating up what they looked at . "
30671	30675	30676	30676	she	920	" Of course , "
30683	30755	30676	30676	she	920	" it is quite natural , and very possible , that you are here for no purpose , and I am here for no purpose too ; you might quite well have come to this little town for amusement , and I have come for the money I might earn as a companion . Or you might have drifted here by accident , as I might , without any special reason — "
30784	30790	30791	30791	she	920	" I will take it , "
30794	30809	30791	30791	she	920	" I have a very short distance to go ; thank you so much . "
30810	30821	30822	30822	he	927	" Let me carry it the rest of the way , "
30825	30852	30822	30822	he	927	" I am going through the village ; we may as well go the rest of the way together , I want you to tell me — "
30876	30886	30887	30887	she	920	" I could not think of troubling you further , "
30890	30894	30895	30895	She	920	" Thank you . "
30922	30927	30920	30920	she	920	" good - evening , "
32578	32589	32590	32590	she	58	" I shall have to go round by the road , "
32607	32621	32622	32622	he	75	" I am rather surprised that you came out at all this evening , "
32625	32643	32622	32622	he	75	" I should have thought your careful friends would have been afraid of colds and wet feet . "
32644	32650	32651	32651	Julia	58	" Vrouw Van Heigen was , "
32654	32685	32651	32651	Julia	58	" but Denah and I were not . It is the last opportunity we shall have for a little while ; Joost goes to Germany on business to - morrow . "
32691	32698	32699	32699	he	75	" Which means , I suppose , "
32702	32728	32699	32699	he	75	" that she will neglect the crochet work , and you will have to superintend it ? Not very congenial to you , is it ? "
32729	32733	32734	32734	she	58	" Good discipline , "
32738	32766	32734	32734	she	58	" And for that reason to be welcomed ? Really you deserve to succeed in whatever it is you are attempting ; you do not neglect details . "
32767	32773	32774	32774	she	58	" Details are often important , "
32777	32801	32774	32774	she	58	" stopping at home and doing crochet work while Joost is in Germany , for instance , may help me a good deal . "
33032	33041	33029	33029	she	58	" You go here , do you not ? "
33042	33045	33046	33046	he	75	" Yes , "
33049	33056	33046	33046	he	75	" to Herr Van de Greutz . "
33057	33068	33069	33069	Julia	58	" The cousin tells me he is a great chemist , "
33072	33076	33069	33069	Julia	58	" He is , "
33082	33105	33106	33106	He	75	" and one much absorbed in his work ; it is impossible to see him even on business except in the evening . "
33115	33127	33128	33128	he	75	" You have not much further to go , have you ? "
33131	33152	33128	33128	he	75	" Will you ex cuse me carrying your basket further ? I am afraid I am rather behind my time . "
33190	33201	33202	33202	she	58	" You are afraid of what will be said next , "
35055	35065	35066	35066	he	90	" I have been to take home Miss Denah , "
35069	35095	35066	35066	he	90	" I saw you a long way off , and thought perhaps I might escort you ; but you are angry ; I am sorry . "
35104	35110	35111	35111	she	58	" I am not angry , "
35121	35127	35111	35111	she	58	" I was only thinking . "
35128	35140	35115	35115	she	58	" Of something unpleasant , then , that makes you angry ? "
35141	35205	35111	35111	she	58	" No ; of something that must have been enjoyable . I was thinking how , in the French Revolution , the women of the people must have enjoyed throwing mud at the women of the aristocrats ; how they must have liked scratching the paint and the skin from their faces , and tearing their hair down , and their clothes off . "
35211	35219	35220	35220	he	90	" Do you call that not unpleasant ? "
35223	35239	35220	35220	he	90	" It is the most grievous , the most pitiable thing in all the world . "
35240	35247	35248	35248	Julia	58	" For the aristocrats , yes , "
35251	35269	35248	35248	Julia	58	" but for the others ? Can you not imagine how they must have revelled in it ? "
35301	35406	35297	35297	she	58	" Do you know why the women of the people did it ? It was not only because the others had food and they had not ; I think it was more because the aristocrats had a thousand other things that they had not , and could never have — feelings , instincts , pleasures , traditions — which they could not have had or enjoyed even if they had been put in palaces and dressed like queens . It was the fact that they could never , never rise to them , that helped to make them so furious to pull all down . "
35422	35448	35418	35418	Joost	90	" You can not enjoy to think of such things ; it is horrible and pitiable to remember that human creatures became so like beasts . "
35454	35485	35487	35487	she	58	" Pitiable , yes ; perhaps you are right . After all , we are pitiful creatures , and , under the thin veneer , like enough to the beasts . "
35520	35533	35534	35534	he	90	" Why do you always speak to me of bulbs and plants ? "
35537	35548	35513	35513	she	58	" Do you think I am interested in nothing else ? "
35549	35552	35553	35553	she	58	" No , "
35556	35612	35553	35553	she	58	" I speak of them because I am interested . Do you not believe me ? It is quite true ; you yourself have said that I should make a good florist ; already I have learnt a great deal , although I have not been here long , and knew nothing before I came . "
35613	35618	35619	35619	he	90	" That is so , "
35622	35687	35619	35619	he	90	" you are very clever . Nevertheless , I do not think , if you were alone now , you would be thinking of plants . You were not when I met you ; it was the Revolution , or , perhaps , human nature — you called it the Revolution in a parable , as you often do when you speak your thoughts . "
35688	35697	35698	35698	Julia	58	" Why do you trouble about my thoughts ? "
35703	35712	35698	35698	Julia	58	" How do you know what I think ? "
35713	35719	35720	35720	he	90	" Perhaps I do n't , "
35723	35740	35720	35720	he	90	" only sometimes it seems to me your voice tells me though your words do not . "
35741	35745	35698	35698	Julia	58	" My voice ? "
35746	35908	35698	35698	Julia	58	" Yes ; it is full of notes like a violin , and speaks more than words . I suppose all voices have many notes really , but people do not often use them ; they use only a few . You use many ; that is why I like to listen to you when you talk to my parents , or any one . It is like a master playing on an instrument ; you make simple words mean much , more than I understand sometimes ; you can caress and you can laugh with your voice ; I have heard you do it when I have not been able to understand what you caress , or at what you laugh , any more than an ignorant person can understand what the violin says , although he may enjoy to hear it . To - night you do not caress or laugh ; there is something black in your thoughts . "
35909	35919	35920	35920	Julia	58	" That is human nature , as you say , "
35931	35950	35920	35920	Julia	58	" Human nature is a hateful , ugly thing ; there is no use in thinking about it . "
35951	35957	35958	35958	Joost	90	" It has certainly fallen , "
35961	35987	35958	35958	Joost	90	" but I have sometimes thought perhaps , if it were not so , it would be a little — a very little — monotonous . "
35988	35996	35997	35997	Julia	58	" You would not find it dull , "
36001	36040	35997	35997	Julia	58	" I believe you would not have got on very well in the Garden of Eden , except that , since all the herbs grew after their own kind , there would be no opportunity to hybridise them . "
36091	36098	36099	36099	he	90	" If we were not fallen , "
36102	36136	36099	36099	he	90	" we should have no opportunity to rise . That , indeed , would be a loss ; is it not the struggle which makes the grand and fine characters which we admire ? "
36137	36144	36145	36145	Julia	58	" I do n't admire them , "
36148	36164	36165	36165	He	90	" I admire the people who are born good , because they are a miracle . "
36185	36193	36194	36194	he	90	" I can not agree with you , "
36205	36400	36194	36194	he	90	" Rather , I admire those who have fought temptation , who are strong , who know and understand and have conquered ; they inspire me to try and follow . What inspiration is there in the other ? Consider Miss Denah , for an example ; she has perhaps never wanted to do more wrong than to take her mother 's prunes , but is there inspiration in her ? She is as soft and as kind as a feather pillow , and as inspiring . But you — you told me once you were bad ; I did not believe you ; I did not understand , but now I know your meaning . You have it in your power to be bad or to be good ; you know which is which , for you have seen badness , and know it as men who live see it . You have fought with it and conquered ; you have struggled , you do struggle , you have strength in you . That is why you are like a lantern that is sometimes bright and sometimes dim , but always a beacon . "
36401	36409	36410	36410	Julia	58	" I am nothing of the sort , "
36440	36451	36452	36452	she	58	" You do not know what you are talking about , "
36455	36487	36452	36452	she	58	" hardly in my life have I asked myself if a thing is right or wrong — do you understand me ? Right and wrong are not things I think about . "
36488	36494	36495	36495	he	1069	" It is quite likely , "
36500	36583	36495	36495	he	1069	" different persons have different names for the same things , as you have once said ; one calls it ' honourable ' and ' dishonourable , ' and another ' right ' and ' wrong , ' and another ' wise ' and ' unwise . ' But it is always the same thing ; it means to choose the more difficult path that leads to the greater end , and leave the other way to the lesser and smaller souls . "
37509	37513	37514	37514	Mevrouw	85	" Dear me , "
37519	37529	37530	37530	Julia	58	" how bad the rain must be for Joost ! "
37568	37576	37577	37578	his wife	168	" It is bad for every one , "
37581	37616	37577	37578	his wife	168	" but worse of all for you . You should be in bed . Indeed , it is not fit that you should be up ; the house is like a cellar this evening . "
37654	37657	37658	37658	he	90	" Pooh ! "
37661	37740	37658	37658	he	90	" Make myself an invalid with Joost away ! Will you go and nurse my nose , and put plasters on my chest ? Go to bed now , do you say ? No , no , my dear , I will sit here ; I am comfortable enough ; I read my paper , I smoke my cigar ; by and by , I go out to see that my barns are all safe for the night . "
38156	38171	38172	38172	He	1104	" I will lock up for you , Mijnheer ; give me the keys . "
39810	39813	39839	39839	he	1150	" county . "
40913	40917	40918	40918	she	103	" Have you ? "
40922	40930	40918	40918	she	103	" What is it ? Show me . "
41001	41021	41022	41022	she	103	" Do you not prefer mine ; really and truly , would you not rather it had been yours ? "
41063	41066	41067	41067	he	90	" No , "
41070	41083	41067	41067	he	90	" she preferred the photograph ; she chose it of the two . "
41671	41683	41684	41684	he	75	" How has the crochet progressed this week under your care ? "
41689	41695	41696	41696	she	58	" It has not progressed , "
41699	41715	41696	41696	she	58	" there are enough mistakes in it now to occupy Denah for a long time . "
41827	41838	41839	41839	she	58	" There is something I should like to ask you , "
41843	41846	41847	41847	he	75	" Yes ? "
41850	41861	41847	41847	he	75	" Is it much trouble to you to be honest ? "
41882	41885	41886	41886	he	75	" That , "
41889	41927	41886	41886	he	75	" I expect rather depends on what you mean by honest . I imagine you do n't refer to lying and stealing , and that sort of thing , since nobody finds it difficult to avoid them . "
41928	41934	41935	41935	she	58	" They are not gentlemanly ? "
41938	41953	41954	41954	he	75	" I do n't know that I ever looked at it in that way , "
41957	41985	41954	41954	he	75	" or , indeed , any way . One does not think about those sort of things ; one does not do them , that 's all . "
42010	42019	42020	42020	she	58	" In the matter of half - truths , "
42023	42028	42020	42020	she	58	" how about them ? "
42029	42042	42043	42043	he	75	" I do n't think I have given that subject consideration either , "
42049	42079	42043	42043	he	75	" there does not seem any need at my age . One does things , or one does not ; abstractions do n't appeal to most men after thirty . "
42084	42090	42091	42091	she	58	" It looks to me , "
42094	42141	42091	42091	she	58	" as if you take your morality , like your dinner , as a matter of course ; it 's always there ; you do n't have to bother after it ; you do n't really know how it comes , or what it is worth . "
42177	42183	42184	42184	he	75	" Possibly you are right , "
42191	42215	42184	42184	he	75	" How do you take yours ? Let us consider yours ; I am sure it would be a great deal more interesting . "
42216	42225	42226	42226	she	58	" There would be more variety in it , "
42230	42240	42241	42241	he	75	" What is your opinion about half - truths ? "
42250	42268	42269	42269	she	58	" ' Half a truth , however small , Is better than no truth at all , ' "
42272	42413	42269	42269	she	58	" That is so ; it is better , safer to deal with — to explain away if it is found out , to deceive with if it is not . But it is not half so easy as the whole truth ; that is the easiest thing in the world ; it takes no ingenuity , no brains , no courage , no acting , no feeling the pulse of your people , no bolstering up or watching or remembering . If I wanted to teach the beauty of truth , I would set my pupils to do a little artistic white lying on their own account , to make things look four times as good as they really were , and not to forget to make them square together , that would teach them the advantage of truth . "
42414	42420	42421	42423	Rawson - Clew	75	" Do you think so ? "
42426	42450	42421	42423	Rawson - Clew	75	" It is not the usual opinion ; fools and cowards are generally supposed to be the great dealers in deceit and subterfuge . "
42451	42455	42456	42456	Julia	58	" May be , "
42459	42558	42456	42456	Julia	58	" but I do n't happen to have come across that sort much ; the other I have , and I am just about sick of it — I am sick of pretending and shamming and double - dealing , of saying one thing and implying another , and meaning another still — you do n't know what it feels like , you have never had to do it ; you would n't , of course ; very likely you could n't , even . I am weary of it ; I am weary of the whole thing . "
42585	42590	42591	42591	he	75	" What is it ? "
42595	42609	42591	42591	he	75	" What has gone wrong to - night ? Too much pudding again ? "
42610	42613	42614	42614	she	58	" No , "
42626	42650	42614	42614	she	58	" too much humbug , too much self . I have seen a great deal of myself lately , and it 's hateful . "
42651	42659	42591	42591	he	75	" I can not agree with you . "
42660	42670	42591	42591	he	75	" Do you like having a lot of yourself ? "
42671	42678	42614	42614	she	58	" No ; I like yourself . "
42696	42708	42692	42692	she	58	" I do n't ; I know what it really is . "
42709	42715	42591	42591	he	75	" And I do not ? "
42716	42719	42720	42720	she	58	" No , "
42747	42788	42744	42744	she	58	" I will tell you , though . You remember my father ? You may have politely forgotten him , or smoothed out your recollections of him — remember him now ; he is just about what you thought him . "
42789	42792	42744	42744	she	58	" Indeed ? "
42811	42828	42829	42829	he	75	" Your shoe is unfastened ; may I tie it for you ? The question is , "
42840	42870	42829	42829	he	75	" what did I think of your father ? I 'm sure I do n't know , and I hardly think you are in a position to , either . "
42965	42976	42977	42977	she	58	" I know perfectly well what you thought my father , "
42980	43013	42977	42977	she	58	" if you have forgotten , I will remind you . You did not think him an adventurer , I know ; of course , you saw he had not brains enough . "
43042	43054	43055	43055	he	75	" You began by saying you would tell me about yourself , "
43058	43065	43055	43055	he	75	" will you not go on ? "
43066	43075	43076	43076	she	1193	" I have more brains than my father , "
43079	43085	43076	43076	she	1193	" and no more principles . "
43086	43249	43055	43055	he	75	" Ergo — you succeed where he falls short ; in fact , you are an adventuress — is that it ? My dear child , you neither are , nor ever could be ; believe me , I really do know , though , as you have indicated , my morality is rather mechanical and my experience much as other men 's . You see , I , too , have graduated in the study of humanity in the university of cosmopolis ; I do n't think my degree is as high as yours , and I certainly did not take it so young , but I believe I know an adventuress when I see one . You will never do in that walk of life ; I do n't mean to insinuate that you have n't brains enough , or that you would ever lose your head ; it is n't that you would lose , it 's your heart . "
43250	43255	43256	43256	Julia	58	" I have n't ; "
43260	43276	43256	43256	Julia	58	" I have not lost my heart ; that has nothing to do with it . "
43277	43286	43287	43289	Rawson - Clew	75	" I did not say that you had , "
43293	43329	43287	43289	Rawson - Clew	75	" of course not , you have not lost it , and could not easily . I did not mean that ; I only meant that it would interfere with your success as an adventuress . "
43330	43335	43336	43336	Julia	58	" It would not , "
43339	43382	43385	43385	he	75	" I do n't care about people a bit ; it is n't that , it is simply that I am sick of deception , that is why I am telling you the truth . And as for the other thing — the daffodil"—she
43390	43407	43287	43289	Rawson - Clew	75	it—"I could n't take it from any one so silly , so childish , so trusting . "
43408	43413	43414	43416	Rawson - Clew	75	" Of course not , "
43419	43523	43414	43416	Rawson - Clew	75	" I do n't know what the daffodil thing is , nor from whom you could not take it — please do n't tell me ; I never take the slightest interest in other people 's business , it bores me . But , you see , you bear out what I say ; you are of those strong who are merciful ; you would make no success as an adventuress . Besides , your tastes are too simple ; I have some recollections of your mentioning corduroy — er — trousers and a diet of onions as the height of your ambition . "
43531	43539	43540	43540	she	58	" That is only when I retire , "
43543	43556	43540	43540	she	58	" I have n't retired yet ; until I do I am — "
43557	43566	43567	43569	Rawson - Clew	75	" The incarnation of the seven deadly sins ? "
43581	43597	43578	43578	his	75	" No doubt of it ; I expect that is what makes you good company . "
43950	43959	43960	43960	Julia	58	" Does the office have a holiday too ? "
43966	43971	43972	43972	he	90	" These young fellows , "
43975	44063	43972	43972	he	90	" are all for holidays ; they are not like their fathers . Now it is always ' I must ride on my wheel ; I must row in my boat ; I must play my piano ; let us put the work away as soon as we can , and forget it . ' It was not so in my young days ; then we worked , or we slept ; playing was for children . There were some great men of business in those days . "
44078	44094	44074	44074	she	58	" It is a real holiday , then , like a bank holiday in England ? "
44095	44102	44103	44103	he	1200	" A real holiday , yes , "
44107	44127	44128	44128	He	1200	" a holiday for you too , if you like . Would you like a real English bank holiday ? "
44134	44138	44139	44139	he	1200	" See here , "
44142	44171	44139	44139	he	1200	" here is an English miss who would like an English holiday ; when the workmen have theirs she shall have hers too , is it not so ? "
44177	44186	44187	44187	she	58	" But what will you do with it ? "
44190	44196	44197	44197	Julia	58	" I should go out , "
44200	44212	44197	44197	Julia	58	" if it is fine I should go out all day . "
44213	44218	44219	44219	Mijnheer	90	" To the fair ? "
44222	44236	44219	44219	Mijnheer	90	" You would not like that alone ; it would be very rough . "
44237	44246	44247	44247	Julia	58	" I should go out into the country , "
44250	44260	44247	44247	Julia	58	" I should make an excursion all by myself . "
44305	44313	44314	44314	he	90	" You shall do as you like , "
44317	44361	44314	44314	he	90	" even though it is not to go to the fair and eat pooferchjes . It is only once in a year one can eat pooferchjes , or three times rather ; they are to be had on each of the three days . "
44362	44367	44368	44368	Julia	58	" What are they ? "
44371	44379	44314	44314	he	90	" I have never heard of them . "
44380	44386	44387	44389	the old man	441	" Never heard of them , "
44392	44493	44387	44389	the old man	441	" They do not have them , I suppose , on an English bank holiday ? Then certainly you must have them here ; we will go and eat them on the first day of the fair , when everything is nice and clean , and there are not too many people about . I will find a nice quiet place , and we will go and eat them together , after tea , before there are great crowds . Will you come with me ? I shall be taking my young lady to the fair like a gay dog . "
44505	44511	44512	44512	she	58	" I shall be delighted , "
46436	46448	46412	46412	Joost	90	" Ta - ra - ra - boom - de - a. "
46778	46789	46790	46790	Julia	58	" We shall have to come back here for lunch , "
46813	46888	46810	46810	she	58	" It does n't matter , we are not going anywhere particular ; we may just as well wander one way as another . When we get to the top this time we will explore to the right , and when we get there again after lunch , we will go to the left ; do n't you think that is the best way ? This is to be a holiday , you know . "
46889	46900	46901	46903	Rawson - Clew	75	" Is a real holiday like a dog 's wanderings ? "
46906	46916	46901	46903	Rawson - Clew	75	" bounded by no purpose except dinner when hungry ? "
46927	46930	46931	46931	she	58	" Though , "
46934	46988	46931	46931	she	58	" dogs always seem to have some end in view , or perhaps a dozen ends , for though they tear off after an imaginary interest as if there was nothing else in the world , they get tired of it , or else start another , and forget all about the first . "
46989	47002	47003	47005	Rawson - Clew	75	" That must also be part of the essence of a holiday , "
47008	47086	47003	47005	Rawson - Clew	75	" at least , one would judge it to be so ; boys and dogs , the only things in nature who really understand the art of holiday - making , chase wild geese , and otherwise do nothing of any account , with an inexhaustible energy , and a purposeful determination wonderful to behold . Also , they forget that there is such a thing as to - morrow , so that must be important too . "
47087	47094	47095	47095	Julia	58	" I ca n't do that , "
47098	47109	47110	47110	he	75	" You might try when you get to the top , "
47113	47133	47110	47110	he	75	" I will try then ; I do n't think I could do anything requiring an effort just now . "
47531	47537	47538	47538	she	58	" Is n't it good ? "
47543	47558	47538	47538	she	58	" Did you know there was so much room — so much room anywhere ? "
47642	47654	47655	47655	she	58	" I expect it does not seem very much to you , "
47658	47667	47655	47655	she	58	" you have seen such a great deal . "
47668	47681	47682	47682	he	75	" I do not remember to have seen anything quite like this , "
47685	47702	47682	47682	he	75	" and if I had , what then ? One does not get tired of things . "
47709	47713	47714	47714	she	58	" I wonder , "
47717	47742	47714	47714	she	58	" if one would ? If one would get weary of it , and want to go back to the other kind of life ? "
47791	47794	47795	47795	he	75	" Remember , "
47798	47810	47795	47795	he	75	" you are to - day to emulate dogs and boys . "
47814	47821	47822	47822	she	58	" How am I to begin ? "
47825	47830	47822	47822	she	58	" How will you ? "
47831	47837	47838	47838	he	75	" I shall sit down , "
47841	47869	47838	47838	he	75	" I feel I could be inconsequent much better if I sat down to it ; that is no doubt because I am past my first youth . "
47870	47873	47874	47874	she	58	" No , "
47886	47958	47874	47874	she	58	" it is because your folly - muscles are stiff from want of use ; you have played lots of things , I expect — it is part of your necessary equipment to be able to do so , but I doubt if you have ever played the fool systematically . I do n't believe you have ever done , and certainly never enjoyed anything inconsequent or foolish in your life . "
47959	47967	47838	47838	he	75	" If you were to ask me , "
47971	47996	47968	47968	he	1296	" I should hardly say you excelled in that direction either . How many inconsequent and foolish things have you done in your life ? "
47997	48046	47874	47874	she	58	" Some , and I should like to do some more . If I were alone now , do you know what I should do ? You see that deep hollow of sparkling white sand ? I should take off my clothes and lie there in the sun . "
48059	48067	48068	48068	he	1296	" Do not let me prevent you , "
48096	48104	48105	48105	he	1296	" But why put them on again ? "
48108	48120	48121	48121	she	58	" Because I have n't retired from the world , yet , "
48124	48136	48121	48121	she	58	" and so I ca n't do quite all I like . "
48137	48169	48086	48086	He	1296	" When you do retire , will this ideal summer costume also be included in the programme ? Your taste in dress grows simpler ; quite ancient British , in fact . "
48170	48195	48196	48196	she	58	" The ancient Britons wore paint , and probably had fashions in it ; I do n't think of imitating them . Tell me , "
48210	48228	48196	48196	she	58	" did you ever really do anything foolish in your life ? I should like to know . "
49126	49135	49136	49136	he	75	" I am going back to England soon , "
49143	49150	49151	49151	she	58	" Is your work here finished ? "
49154	49161	49162	49162	he	75	" It is at an end , "
49165	49172	49162	49162	he	75	" that is the same thing . "
49193	49202	49203	49203	she	58	" You mean it can not be done , "
49218	49223	49224	49224	he	75	" May I smoke ? "
49227	49239	49224	49224	he	75	" there are a good many gnats and mosquitoes about here . "
49257	49267	49249	49249	he	75	" Do you believe things can not be done ? "
49268	49271	49272	49272	she	58	" Yes , "
49275	49291	49272	49272	she	58	" I know that sometimes they can not ; I have proved it to myself . "
49292	49313	49249	49249	he	75	" You have not , then , much opinion of the people who do not know when they are beaten ? "
49314	49322	49323	49323	she	58	" I do n't think I have , "
49326	49415	49323	49323	she	58	" you can not help knowing when you are beaten if you really are — that is , unless you are a fool . Of course , if you are only beaten in one round , or one effort , that is another thing ; you can get up and try again . But if you are really and truly beaten , by yourself , or circumstances , or something — well , there 's an end ; there is nothing but to get up and go on . "
49416	49441	49504	49505	sug gested	110	" Just so ; in that case , as you say , there is not much going to be done , except going home . "
49445	49454	49455	49455	she	58	" But I ca n't even do that , "
49458	49480	49455	49455	she	58	" I am beaten , but I have got to stay here all the same , having nowhere exactly to go . "
49497	49502	49503	49503	he	1336	" But , perhaps , "
49507	49524	49503	49503	he	1336	" if you stay , you may find a back way to your object after all . "
49530	49561	49525	49525	She	58	" It is the back way I tried . No , there is no way ; it is blocked . I know , because it is myself that blocks it . "
49562	49567	49568	49568	he	1336	" In that case , "
49571	49619	49568	49568	he	1336	" I 'm afraid I must agree with you ; there is no way ; oneself is about the most insurmountable block of all . I might have known that you were hardly likely to make any mistake as to whether you were really beaten or not . "
49620	49636	49637	49637	she	58	" I should not think it was a mistake you were likely to make either , "
49640	49664	49665	49665	She	58	" You think not ? Well , I had no chance this time ; the fact has been made pretty obvious to me . "
49686	49690	49691	49691	she	58	" I suppose , "
49698	49718	49691	49691	she	58	" there is not a back way — a door , or window , even , to your object ? "
49719	49765	49766	49766	Julia	58	" Unfortunately , no . There are no windows at the back ; and as to the door — like you , it was that which I tried , with the result that recently — yesterday , in fact — I was metaphorically shown out . "
50078	50085	50075	50075	she	58	" It is hateful to fail . "
50086	50117	50075	50075	she	58	" It is ignominious , certainly ; one does not wish to blazon it from the housetops ; still , doubtless like your crochet work , it is good discipline . "
50118	50121	50122	50122	Julia	58	" Maybe , "
50129	50177	50075	50075	she	58	" Yours seems a simple failure , mine is a compound one . If it is ignominious , as you say , to fail , it would have been equally ignominious in another way if I had succeeded . I could not have been satisfied either way . "
50178	50184	50075	50075	she	58	" That sounds very complicated , "
50190	50203	50185	50187	Rawson - Clew	75	" but then , I imagine you are a complicated young person . "
50204	50210	50075	50075	she	58	" And you are not . "
50211	50217	50218	50218	he	75	" Not young , certainly , "
50225	50229	50230	50230	she	58	" Nor complicated , "
50233	50288	50230	50230	she	58	" you are built on straight lines ; there are given things you can do and ca n't do , would do and would not do , and might do in an emer gency . It is a fine kind of person to be , but it is not the kind which surprises itself . "
50307	50313	50314	50314	he	75	" How old are you ? "
50317	50426	50314	50314	he	75	" Twenty ? Almost twenty - one , is it ? And until you were sixteen you knocked about a bit ? Sixteen is too young to come much across the natural man — not the artful dodging man , or the man of civilisation , but the natural , primitive man , own blood relation to Adam and the king of the Cannibal Islands . You may meet him by and by , and if you do he may surprise you ; he is full of surprises — he rather surprises himself , that is , if his local habitat is ordinarily an educated , decent person . "
50427	50436	50437	50437	Julia	58	" You have not got a natural man , "
50454	50525	50441	50441	she	58	" Have I not ? Quite likely ; certainly , he has never bothered me , but I should not like to count on him . Since we have got to personalities , may I say that you have got a natural woman , and plenty of her ; also a marked taste for the works of the machine , in preference to the face usually presented to the company ? "
50526	50783	50793	50793	she	1344	" The works are the only interesting part ; I do n't care for the drawing - room side of things ; they are cultivated , but they are too much on the skin . I would much rather be a stoker , or an engineer , than sit on deck all day and talk about Florentine art , and the Handel Festival , and Egyptology , and the gospel of Tolstoy , and play cricket and quoits , and dance a little , and sing a little , and flirt a little , ever so nicely . Oh , there are lots of girls who can do all those things , and do them equally well ; I know a few who can , well off , well - bred girls — you must know a great many . They are clever to begin with , and they are taught that way ; it is a perfect treat to meet them and watch them , but I never want to imitate them , even if I could — and there is no danger of that . I would rather be in the engine - room , with my coat off , a bit greasy and very profane , and doing something . There would be more flesh and blood there , even if it were a bit grubby ; I believe I 'm more at home with people who can do — well , what 's necessary , even if it is not exactly nice . "
50888	50897	50898	50898	he	75	" The people in the engine - room , "
50901	50922	50898	50898	he	75	" would certainly be more useful in an emergency ; still , life is not made up entirely of emergencies . "
50923	50926	50927	50927	Julia	58	" No , "
50930	50973	50927	50927	Julia	58	" and in between times such people are better not on show — I know that ; that is why I do not care for the drawing - room side of things , I do n't know enough to shine in them . "
50974	50985	50986	50986	he	75	" Do you think it is a matter of knowledge ? "
50989	51070	50986	50986	he	75	" or inclination ? If it comes to knowledge I should say you had a rather remarkable stock of an unusual sort , and at first hand . That may not be what is required for a complete drawing - room success , though I am not sure that it is not more interesting — say for an excursion — than a flitting glance at the subjects you mention , and about eighteen or twenty more that you did not . "
51155	51161	51162	51162	she	58	" How late is it ! "
51165	51205	51206	51206	She	58	" We ought to have started half - an - hour ago ; it will take me two hours , and more , to get home from here , even if I go by the tram in the town . "
51218	51227	51228	51228	he	75	" Shall I take your flowers for you ? "
51231	51269	51228	51228	he	75	" They seem rather inclined to tumble about ; do n't you think they would be safer in my pocket ? As you say you are going to dry them , it wo n't matter crushing them . "
51298	51304	51305	51305	Julia	58	" It is much colder , "
51308	51349	51305	51305	Julia	58	" and the sun is all gone ; I suppose the clouds have been coming gradually , but I did not notice before . If it is going to rain , we shall get decidedly wet before we get back . "
51350	51356	51357	51357	he	75	" I am afraid so , "
51360	51366	51367	51367	She	58	" you have no coat . "
51479	51484	51485	51485	Julia	58	" A sea fog , "
51488	51497	51485	51485	Julia	58	" I wonder how far it is coming . "
51972	51977	51978	51978	he	75	" I am afraid , "
51981	51998	51978	51978	he	75	" we had better do what is recommended when the clouds come down on the mountains . "
51999	52004	52005	52005	Julia	58	" And that is ? "
52008	52017	52018	52018	She	58	" Sit down and wait till they shift . "
52107	52119	52120	52122	Rawson - Clew	75	" We will go a little way in among the trees , "
52125	52153	52120	52122	Rawson - Clew	75	" it is more sheltered , and we shall be able to find the way quite as easily from one place as another when the fog lifts . "
52190	52196	52197	52197	he	75	" How cold you are ! "
52200	52206	52197	52197	he	75	" You have nothing on . "
52207	52215	52216	52216	she	58	" Oh , yes , I have , "
52220	52232	52233	52233	He	75	" I did not avail myself of your permission this morning . "
52251	52259	52260	52260	she	58	" That wo n't do at all , "
52263	52289	52260	52260	she	58	" now you have nothing on , and that is much more improper ; women may sit in their shirt sleeves , men may not . "
52290	52296	52297	52297	he	75	" Do n't be absurd ! "
52301	52309	52297	52297	he	75	" you are to keep that on , "
52329	52338	52339	52339	she	58	" You are shutting all the damp in , "
52348	52381	52339	52339	she	58	" and that is very unwholesome . I sha n't get warm ; I have n't any warmth to start with ; you are wasting what you have got to no purpose . "
52540	52552	52553	52555	Rawson - Clew	75	" Do you suppose this fog will be in the town ? "
52562	52565	52566	52566	she	58	" No , "
52569	52588	52566	52566	she	58	" I should think not ; from what I have heard , I think it is very unlikely . "
52589	52603	52553	52555	Rawson - Clew	75	" Then the Van Heigens wo n't know what has become of you ? "
52604	52677	52678	52680	Rawson - Clew	75	" Not a bit in the world ; they do n't even know where I was going to - day . I did not tell them ; I am afraid they will be rather uneasy about me , but perhaps not so very much , they know by this time I can take care of myself ; besides , I shall be home before bed - time , if the fog lifts . "
53662	53667	53668	53668	Julia	58	" There 's Denah , "
53769	53772	53773	53773	Julia	58	" Hulloah ? "
53882	53889	53890	53890	Julia	58	" She 'll take a tram , "
53900	53920	53890	53890	Julia	58	" she is too careful to waste her money even to spite any one of whom she is jealous . "
53959	53964	53965	53965	she	58	" Do n't come , "
53968	53979	53965	53965	she	58	" I do n't want you . Good - bye . "
53984	53990	53991	53991	he	75	" I certainly am coming , "
54112	54116	54117	54117	she	58	" Look here , "
54120	54199	54117	54117	she	58	" there is not any need for you to come , I can do better without you , I can indeed . I have got to explain things , of course , but , as I told you before , I have had some practice at dodging and explaining . I shall reach the Van Heigens ' before Denah , so I shall get the first hearing , that 's all I want , I can explain beautifully . "
54200	54208	54209	54211	Rawson - Clew	75	" You can not explain me away , "
54214	54252	54209	54211	Rawson - Clew	75	" I know I was not to have figured in the original account , that is obvious , but it is equally obvious that I must figure in this one . I prefer to give it myself . "
54253	54264	54265	54265	Julia	58	" Oh , but that wo n't do at all ! "
54268	54326	54265	54265	Julia	58	" Please leave it to me , it would be nothing to me , I am used to tight places , and it would be an insufferable annoyance to you . I really do n't want you to suffer for your kindness to me — you have no idea what absurd and ridiculous things they will say . "
54347	54352	54353	54353	he	75	" My dear child , "
54356	54387	54353	54353	he	75	" in spite of the sheltered life with which you credit me , I assure you I have a very clear idea of the kind of things they will say . "
54388	54399	54400	54400	Julia	58	" Then for goodness sake , leave it to me , "
54407	54435	54400	54400	Julia	58	" I can do it a great deal better than you can ; I 'm not honest , and you are , and that 's a handicap . "
54436	54441	54353	54353	he	75	" In these cases , "
54448	54490	54442	54444	Rawson - Clew	75	" honesty requires the consideration of the lady first and truth afterwards — a long way after . Let me know what you want told and I will tell it — with evidence — I suppose you are equal to evidence ? "
54499	54508	54509	54509	she	58	" I do wish you would not come , "
54566	54569	54570	54570	she	729	" Ach ! "
54580	54589	54570	54570	she	729	" G - r - r - r ! "
54718	54728	54729	54729	she	58	" Denah saved her money and won her move , "
54732	54756	54729	54729	she	58	" it serves me right . I under - rated her — this is what always comes of under - rating the enemy . "
54757	54768	54769	54771	Rawson - Clew	75	" Do you mean she knew where these people are ? "
54774	54787	54769	54771	Rawson - Clew	75	" That is about it , she knew and I did not . "
54788	54796	54729	54729	she	58	" What are you going to do ? "
54797	54809	54810	54810	He	75	" Wait till they come back , there is nothing else . "
54831	54839	54840	54840	she	58	" You can not wait with me , "
54843	54861	54840	54840	she	58	" it is one thing to bring me home , quite another to wait with me here . "
54877	54881	54882	54882	he	75	" Thank you , "
54885	54902	54882	54882	he	75	" I prefer to wait ; I consider I am conducting this now , not you . "
54928	54939	54940	54940	she	58	" Oh , well , if you prefer to wait , "
54943	54954	54940	54940	she	58	" but I 'm afraid you must do it alone . "
55312	55315	55309	55309	They	1461	" ja , "
56227	56230	56218	56218	he	75	" holiday , "
57558	57573	57574	57574	she	58	" You pretended you did not know him the day we went the excursion , "
57578	57631	57574	57574	she	58	" I saw you ; I knew you were not to be trusted then . Why did you pretend , and how do you know him ? He is a man of family ; he has the air of it , very distinguished , and you are nothing at all , nobody — "
57632	57635	57637	57637	Mijnheer	90	" Hush ! "
57639	57699	57637	57637	Mijnheer	90	" that is not the point ; it is of no importance who the man may be , he is a man , that is enough ; and she was out with him — alone — a whole day and night ; it is certainly very bad indeed ; shocking , if it is true — is it true ? "
57709	57712	57706	57706	she	58	" Yes . "
57912	57917	57918	57918	she	58	" I am sorry , "
57921	57980	57918	57918	she	58	" I am sorry you should all have to think so ill of me , and that I should deserve it . You have been very kind to me while I have been here , and made my service easy ; I am ashamed to have deceived you and behaved in such a way as you must condemn . "
58080	58083	58084	58084	she	84	" Mijnheer , "
58098	58220	58221	58221	she	1568	" Mijnheer , you are a very good man , Mevrouw is a virtuous woman , and Vrouw Snieder also , all of you . I have often admired your goodness ; when you were least conscious of it it preached to me , making me ashamed of my wickedness . But now that you , in your goodness , have taken to preaching to me yourselves , I am no longer ashamed , for it is clear that your goodness dares to do a thing that no man 's wickedness would ; it turns the foolish and indiscreet into sinners and sinners into devils ; it makes the way of wrong - doing very easy . You are so good , "
58230	58326	58221	58221	she	1568	" perhaps you do not know wickedness when you see it ; you can not distinguish between sin and sin ; you are like those who would hang a man for stealing bread as soon as for killing a child . What ! Are you indignant , Mevrouw , at such a charge ? Are you not turning out , with no character and no chance — a good enough imitation of hanging — a girl who has been no more than foolish , just the same as if she had committed the greatest sin ? "
58402	58405	58406	58406	she	58	" Yes , "
58409	58448	58406	58406	she	58	" it is a shame to speak of such things , as you observe ; do not let us speak of them any more . Perhaps Mijnheer you would like to pay me , then I can go . "
58472	58479	58480	58480	he	90	" But can you go now ? "
58483	58497	58480	58480	he	90	" Nothing is arranged ; you had better wait a day or two . "
58498	58501	58502	58502	Julia	58	" No , "
58505	58530	58502	58502	Julia	58	" I think not ; it would be well to get the thing over and done with ; you would rather and so would I. "
58546	58550	58551	58551	she	58	" Thank you , "
58554	58574	58575	58575	she	58	" now I will set the table for coffee drinking . You will stay , of course , Mevrouw , "
58582	58607	58575	58575	she	58	Snieder—"and Miss Denah , that will be two extra — Mijnheer Joost will be in , Denah ; you can tell him about it . "
58618	58623	58613	58614	Vrouw Snieder	84	" You — You — "
58624	58638	58639	58639	Julia	58	" Oh , I will not sit down with you , of course , "
58643	58661	58639	58639	Julia	58	" I will take my coffee in the little room ; is it not so , Mevrouw ? "
58872	58875	58876	58876	she	58	" Denah , "
58894	58960	58876	58876	she	58	" I will give you a piece of advice ; take care how you tell Joost about my wickedness ; you want to be ever so clever to abuse another girl to a man ; it is one of the most difficult things in the world — and you are not very clever , you know , not even clever enough to take my advice . "
59049	59056	59039	59039	him	90	" I wo n't believe it ! "
59238	59248	59249	59249	she	58	" Would you prefer that I went at once ? "
59252	59284	59249	59249	she	58	" or that I waited till after dinner ? I will stay till six if you wish it , or I will go now without waiting to attend to the dinner . "
59383	59390	59391	59391	she	58	" Put it on the table , "
59444	59449	59450	59450	she	58	" Who brought it ? "
59513	59523	59487	59487	she	58	" Dear Miss Polkington , ( it ran ) , "
59636	59641	59642	59646	H. F. Rawson - Clew	74	" Very sincerely yours , "
59648	59688	59642	59646	H. F. Rawson - Clew	74	" So Julia read , and sat down suddenly on the flour barrel . She turned to the beginning of the letter and read it through again , and when she looked up her eyes were shining with admiration . "
59693	59702	59703	59703	I	0	" she said aloud , but in English , "
59738	59797	59798	59798	You	1595	" The maidservant started at her curiously ; she could not understand a word , but she saw that the letter gave pleasure , for which she was glad ; she liked Julia , and was very sorry she was going in disgrace ; she herself had occasional lapses from rectitude and so consequently had a fellow feeling . "
59804	59808	59798	59798	You	1595	" she asked . "
59812	59816	59798	59798	You	1595	" Julia said ; "
59834	59851	59826	59826	I	0	" Julia put it in her pocket after another glance , purring to herself in English , "
59860	59864	59826	59826	I	0	" she said ; "
59879	60010	60018	60018	she	1597	" and she laughed softly . There is no doubt about it , if Julia had got to receive a death sentence she would have liked it to be well given ; it is quite possible , had she lived at the time , she would have been one of those who objected to the indignity of riding in the tumbrils quite as much as to the guillotine at the end of the ride . She finished the preparations for dinner , got her pots and pans all nicely simmering and her oven at the right heat ; then , giving some necessary directions , she left the servant to watch the cooking and went up to her own room . There she at once proceeded to answer the letter — "
60022	60062	60018	60018	she	1597	" I am as glad as anything that you have done it ; I never for a moment thought of it myself , though I ought , for it is just like you ; thank you ever so much . "
60079	60101	60102	60102	Yours	75	" Here she turned over his letter to see how he had signed himself and , seeing , signed in imitation — "
60106	60110	60102	60102	Yours	75	" Julia Polkington . "
60111	60119	60120	60120	she	1597	" I wonder what his name is ? "
60123	60142	60143	60143	She	1597	" H. F.—H.—Henry , Horace — I should n't think he had a name people called him by . "
60276	60321	60271	60271	she	1597	" Of course this means no . I am sorry we ca n't go on with the excursion , but we ca n't , you know . The holiday is over ; this is ' to - morrow , ' so good - bye . "
60435	60445	60446	60446	she	1597	" Do you want to hear what happened yesterday ? "
60457	60481	60446	60446	she	1597	" I expect Denah has told you all , perhaps a little more than all , still , enough of it was true . "
60482	60490	60491	60491	he	90	" I want to speak to you , "
60646	60652	60640	60640	she	58	" he who is down , "
60682	60685	60686	60686	she	58	" Well ? "
60709	60880	60705	60705	she	58	" I really do n't think there is anything to say ; I did wrong yesterday , not quite as much wrong as your mother and Denah think , still wrong — what my own people would have disapproved , at least if it were found out ; that 's the biggest crime on their list — and what I knew your peo ple would condemn utterly . I am afraid I have no excuse to offer ; I knew what I was doing , and I did it with my eyes open . I did not see any harm in it myself but I knew other people would , so I meant to say nothing . I had deceived your parents before , and I meant to keep on doing it . You know I had walked with that man lots of times before yesterday ; all the time your mother thought me so good to visit your cousin I really enjoyed doing it because I walked with him . "
60881	60887	60705	60705	she	58	" Do you love him ? "
60897	60901	60902	60902	Julia	58	" Love him ? "
60907	61004	60902	60902	Julia	58	" no , of course not . That is where the difference comes in , I believe ; you all seem to think there is nothing but love and love - making and kissing and cuddling . I have just liked talking to him and I suppose he liked talking to me , as you might some friend , or Denah some girl she knew . We never thought about love and all that ; we could n't , you know ; he belongs to a different lot from what I do . Do you understand ? "
61005	61011	61012	61012	he	1607	" Yes , I understand , "
61030	61083	61022	61022	his	1607	" I understand that it is you who are right and we who are wrong — you who know good and evil and can choose , we who suspect and think and hint , believing ill when there is none . Rather than send you away , we should ask your forgiveness ! "
61084	61093	61094	61094	Julia	58	" You should do nothing of the kind , "
61103	61161	61094	61094	Julia	58	" I may not have been wrong in quite the way your parents think , but I was wrong all the same . I am not good , believe me ; I am not as you are . Look at me , I am bad inwardly , and really I am what you would condemn and despise . "
61228	61236	61237	61237	he	1610	" You are to me a beacon — "
61261	61268	61269	61269	she	58	" I am not a beacon , "
61272	61310	61269	61269	she	58	" before you take me for a guiding light you had better hear something about me . Do you know why I came here ? I will tell you — it was to get your blue daffodil ! "
61352	61389	61347	61347	she	58	" I heard of it in England , that it was worth a lot of money — and I wanted money — so I came here ; I meant to get a bulb and sell it . "
61390	61395	61396	61396	he	1610	" You meant to ? "
61400	61409	61396	61396	he	1610	" but you haven't — you could n't ? "
61410	61421	61347	61347	she	58	" I could , six times over if I liked . "
61422	61428	61347	61347	she	58	" But you have not . "
61429	61474	61396	61396	he	1610	" No . I was a fool , and you were — Oh , I ca n't explain ; you would never understand , and it does not matter . The thing that matters is that I came here to get your blue daffodil . "
61475	61484	61485	61485	he	1610	" You must have needed money very greatly , "
61494	61540	61485	61485	he	1610	" I did , I wanted it desperately , but that does not matter either — I came here to steal ; I go away because I am found out to have deceived and to have behaved improperly — I want you to understand that . "
61541	61547	61548	61548	he	1610	" I do not understand , "
61551	61568	61548	61548	he	1610	" I understand nothing but that you are you , and — and I love you . "
61569	61574	61575	61575	she	1610	" You do n't ! "
61581	61627	61575	61575	she	1610	" You do not , and you can not ! You think you love what you think I am . But I am not that ; it is all quite different ; when you , know , when you realise , you will see it . "
61628	61633	61634	61634	he	1610	" I realise now , "
61637	61648	61634	61634	he	1610	" it is still the light , only sometimes dim . "
61649	61652	61653	61653	she	1610	" Dim ! "
61656	61662	61653	61653	she	1610	" it has gone out ! "
61663	61702	61703	61703	He	1610	" And if it has , what then ? If you are all you say you are , and all they say you are , and many worse things besides , what then ? It makes no difference . "
61739	61752	61753	61753	she	1610	" Oh , what have I done ! What have I done ! "
61772	61780	61781	61781	he	1610	" I will take care of you , "
61784	61795	61781	61781	he	1610	" Will you not let me take care of you ? "
61829	61834	61835	61835	she	1610	" You can not , "
61839	61862	61835	61835	she	1610	" you could n't possibly do it . Do n't you see that it is impossible ? Your parents , the people — "
61863	61870	61871	61871	he	1610	" That is of no importance , "
61874	61904	61835	61835	she	1610	" my parents would very soon see you in your true light , and for the rest — what does it matter ? If you will marry me I — "
61905	61994	61835	61835	she	1610	" But Joost , I ca n't ! Do n't you feel yourself that I ca n't ? We are not only of two nations — that is nothing — but we are almost of two races ; we are night and day , oil and water , black and white . It would never do ; we should be on the outskirts of each other 's lives , you would never know mine , and though I might know yours , I could never really enter in . "
61995	62000	62001	62001	he	1612	" That is nothing , "
62004	62009	62001	62001	he	1612	" if you love . "
62010	62015	62016	62016	she	1613	" It is everything , "
62019	62036	62016	62016	she	1613	" if two people do not talk the same language , soul language , I mean . "
62037	62132	62133	62133	He	1612	" They will learn it if they love — but you do not ? Is it that , tell me . Ah , yes , you do , a little , little bit ! Only a little , so that you hardly know it , but it is enough — if you have the least to give that would do ; I would do all the rest ; I would love you ; I would stand between you and the whole world ; in time it would come , in time you would care ! "
62202	62207	62208	62208	she	1613	" I can not , "
62213	62219	62208	62208	she	1613	" I can never care . "
62262	62268	62269	62269	she	1613	" I am so sorry ! "
62272	62320	62269	62269	she	1613	" I am so sorry . Oh , why is everything so hard ! Joost , dear Joost , you must not mind ; I am not half good enough for you ; I 'm not , indeed . Please forget me and — let me go . "
62686	62699	62670	62670	himself	90	" I could not do it , I could not do it ! "
62919	62926	62927	62927	Julia	58	" Good - bye , Mevrouw , "
62945	62950	62951	62951	Julia	58	" And , oh , "
62961	62994	62951	62951	Julia	58	" do n't forget that last lot of peach - brandy we made , it was not properly tied down ; you ought to look at the covers some time this week . "
62995	63000	63002	63004	the old lady	553	" Ah , yes , "
63009	63036	63002	63004	the old lady	553	" thank you , thank you , I 'll see to it ; it will never do to have that go ; such fine peaches too . "
63125	63132	63133	63133	he	90	" I will tell the man , "
63136	63157	63133	63133	he	90	" I will go after him too and shut the gate ; it grows late for it to be open . "
63276	63281	63282	63282	he	90	" Do not weep , "
63285	63293	63282	63282	he	90	" you must not weep for me . "
63294	63300	63301	63301	she	58	" I am so sorry , "
63304	63309	63301	63301	she	58	" so dreadfully sorry ! "
63310	63317	63318	63318	he	90	" But you must not be , "
63322	63328	63318	63318	he	90	" there is no need . "
63329	63374	63282	63282	he	90	" There is every need ; you have been so kind to me , so good ; you have almost taught me — though you do n't know it — some goodness too , and in return I have brought you nothing but sadness . "
63375	63382	63383	63383	he	90	" Ah , yes , sadness , "
63386	63446	63383	63383	he	90	" but gladness too , and the gladness is more than the sadness . Would you not sooner know the fine even though you can not attain to it , than be content with the little all your life ? I would , and it is that which you have given me . It is I who give nothing — "
63469	63475	63476	63476	he	90	" Will you take this ? "
63484	63521	63476	63476	he	90	" It is , perhaps , not much to some , but I would like you to have it ; it seems fitting ; I think I owe it to you , and you to it . "
63522	63529	63530	63530	she	58	" Oh , yes , yes , "
63651	63659	63613	63613	she	58	" Narcissus Triandrus Azureum Vrouw Van Heigen . "
63709	63718	63613	63613	she	58	beginning—"I am so glad you have done it , "
63724	63735	63613	63613	she	58	postscript—"this is to - morrow , so good - bye . "
63826	63829	63823	63823	she	415	" capitally , "
63881	63883	63895	63895	she	415	" capital "
64304	64309	64310	64310	he	90	" She has gone ? "
64353	64371	64342	64342	she	553	" Where has she gone ? Perhaps you would be kind enough to give me her address ? "
64372	64377	64378	64378	she	58	" I can not , "
64384	64398	64378	64378	she	58	" I have not it . I do not know where she is . "
64404	64408	64409	64409	he	90	" But surely , "
64412	64422	64409	64409	he	90	" you are mistaken ? She was here yesterday . "
64423	64460	64464	64464	she	58	" Yes , yes ; I know . But she is not here now ; she went last night in haste . I will tell you about it . You are a friend ? Come in . "
64732	64747	64729	64729	Mijnheer	90	" You are , I suppose , a friend of Miss Polkington 's father ? "
64761	64768	64769	64769	Mijnheer	90	" I am acquainted with him . "
64772	64777	64778	64778	he	75	" Yes , yes , "
64783	64829	64778	64778	he	75	" it is very sad , and much to be regretted . I can not but give to you , and through you to her father , very bad news of Miss Polkington . She is not what we thought her ; she has disgraced — "
64852	64857	64858	64858	he	75	" My dear sir , "
64861	64889	64858	64858	he	75	" please spare yourself the trouble of these details ; I am the man with whom Miss Polkington had the misfortune to be lost on the Dunes . "
64948	64953	64954	64954	he	75	" Then , sir , "
64961	64976	64954	64954	he	75	" I am glad indeed that I can not tell you where she is . "
65028	65040	65041	65041	he	75	" I am sorry you should think so badly of me , "
65044	65092	65041	65041	he	75	" I can only assure you that it is without reason . You do not believe me ? I suppose it is quite useless for me to say that my sole motive in seeking Miss Polkington is a desire to prevent her from coming to any harm ? "
65093	65111	65112	65112	Mijnheer	90	" She will , I should think , come to less harm without you than with you , "
65141	65149	65150	65150	he	75	" I hope you may be right , "
65153	65201	65150	65150	he	75	" but I am afraid she will be in difficulties . She had little money , and no friends in Holland , and was , I have reason to believe , on such terms with her family that it would not suit her to return to England . "
65202	65213	65116	65118	Rawson - Clew	75	" Ah , but she must have gone to England ! "
65219	65241	65214	65216	Vrouw Van Heigen	86	" She went away in a carriage as one does when one goes to the station to start on a journey . "
65242	65250	65251	65251	Mijnheer	90	" She received letters from her family , "
65255	65331	65251	65251	Mijnheer	90	" not frequently , but occasionally ; there was not , I think , any quarrel or disagreement . She must certainly have set out to return home last night . If not , and if she had nowhere to go , why should she leave as she did yesterday ? We did not say ' go ! ' we were content that she should remain several days , until her arrangements could be made . "
65332	65341	65342	65344	Rawson - Clew	75	" She might not have cared for that , "
65347	65375	65342	65344	Rawson - Clew	75	" if you insinuated to her the sort of things you did to me ; women do not like that , as a rule , you know . "
65752	65755	65750	65750	Julia	58	" capital arrangement "
65942	65951	65952	65952	she	1701	" Miss Julia Polkington was not at home , "
65975	65987	65988	65988	she	1701	" There is no talk of her coming home , sir , "
65991	66006	65988	65988	she	1701	" she is abroad , I think ; she has been gone some time . "
66007	66011	66012	66013	The girl	415	" Since when ? "
66018	66028	66029	66029	she	1701	" In the spring , I think , sir , "
66032	66042	66029	66029	she	1701	" she has not been here all the summer . "
66072	66078	66079	66079	he	75	" Is Captain Polkington in ? "
66261	66270	66271	66271	he	75	" When do you expect Captain Polkington home ? "
66274	66287	66271	66271	he	75	" Not for a month or more , I believe , sir , "
66292	66300	66271	66271	he	75	" he is in London just now . "
66681	66685	66686	66686	she	1727	" Cap'ain Polkington ? "
66698	66726	66686	66686	she	1727	" I do n't know whether he 's in or not ; you 'd better go up and see ; one of 'em 's there , anyhow . "
66741	66746	66747	66747	she	1727	" Up - stairs , "
66750	66757	66747	66747	she	1727	" second door you come to . "
66983	66988	66976	66976	she	58	" one of them . "
67094	67102	67103	67103	he	57	" I was looking for Captain Polkington , "
67106	67115	67103	67103	he	57	" I was told he was probably here . "
67116	67119	67124	67124	his	66	" Ah ! "
67131	67166	67124	67124	his	66	" Of course , of course ! Captain Polkington 's out just now , but he 'll be in soon . Come in , wo n't you ; come in and wait for him . "
67177	67185	67186	67186	he	66	" Try that , wo n't you ? "
67189	67226	67186	67186	he	66	" It 's really comfortable — not that one , that 's a little weak in the legs ; it ought to be put away ; it 's deceptive to people who do n't know it . "
67256	67262	67263	67263	he	66	" My name 's Gillat , "
67267	67277	67263	67263	he	66	" Captain Polkington is an old friend of mine . "
67278	67282	67283	67285	Rawson - Clew	75	" Mr. Gillat ? "
67353	67356	67357	67359	Rawson - Clew	75	" Perhaps , "
67362	67389	67390	67390	He	66	" you can tell me what I want to know — it is about Miss Julia Polkington . I met her in Holland during the summer . "
67437	67442	67443	67443	he	66	" Ah , yes , "
67446	67460	67443	67443	he	66	" Julia is in Holland ; she has been there a long time . "
67461	67467	67468	67470	Rawson - Clew	75	" Is she there still ? "
67473	67481	67468	67470	Rawson - Clew	75	" Can you give me her address ? "
67482	67485	67486	67486	Johnny	57	" Well , "
67490	67500	67486	67486	Johnny	57	" not exactly . But she is abroad somewhere , "
67522	67531	67532	67534	Rawson - Clew	75	" You do n't know where she is ? "
67537	67551	67532	67534	Rawson - Clew	75	" Does her father ? I suppose he does — some one must . "
67552	67555	67556	67556	Johnny	57	" No , "
67559	67601	67556	67556	Johnny	57	" No ; I 'm afraid not . Certainly her father does not , nor her mother — none of us know ; but , as you say , somebody must know — the people she is with , for instance . "
67610	67615	67616	67616	he	75	" Do you mean , "
67619	67641	67616	67616	he	75	" that her family are content to know nothing of her whereabouts ? Have they taken no steps to find her ? "
67642	67648	67649	67649	Johnny	57	" Well , you see , "
67653	67754	67649	67649	Johnny	57	" there are n't any steps to take . They do n't want to find her ; she is quite well and happy , no doubt , and she will come back when she is ready . Mrs. Polkington — do you know Mrs. Polkington ? A wonderful woman ! She is very busy just now , she is shining . Miss Chèrie is quite a belle . They really have not — have not accommodation for Julia ; it is not , of course , that they do n't want her — they have not exactly room for her . "
67755	67766	67767	67769	Rawson - Clew	75	" But surely they want to know where she is ? "
67772	67779	67780	67780	Johnny	57	" No , they do n't , "
67784	67812	67780	67780	Johnny	57	" They know she is all right ; she told them so , and told them she did not want to be found . They are satisfied — "
67833	67842	67843	67843	he	57	" Family emotions and sentiments , you know , "
67851	67869	67871	67871	he	57	" are not every one 's strong point ; the social , or the religious , or — "
67877	67889	67843	67843	he	57	" or the national may stand first , and why not ? "
67890	67895	67896	67898	Rawson - Clew	75	" Are you satisfied ? "
67902	67912	67913	67913	Johnny	57	" I 'd sooner be able to see her , "
67916	67953	67913	67913	Johnny	57	" I 'm fond of her ; yes , she 's been very kind and good ; I miss seeing her . But , of course , she has her way to make in the world . "
67954	67983	67843	67843	he	57	" But are you satisfied that she should make it thus ? That she should leave the Dutch family she was with and disappear , leaving no address ? "
67984	67987	67988	67988	Johnny	57	" Sir , "
67993	68018	67988	67988	Johnny	57	" I am quite satisfied , and if any one says that he is not , I would be pleased to talk to him . "
68045	68051	68052	68052	he	75	" You must forgive me , "
68055	68088	68052	68052	he	75	" I am very fond of that little girl ; and I thought — but I had no business to think ; I 'm an old fool , to think you meant — "
68089	68094	68095	68097	Rawson - Clew	75	" I only meant , "
68105	68127	68095	68097	Rawson - Clew	75	" that I was afraid she might be in difficulties . She may be in trouble about money , or something . "
68128	68133	68134	68134	Johnny	57	" Oh , no , "
68138	68197	68198	68198	He	57	" she has a fine head for money matters . I have sometimes thought , since she has been gone , that she has the best head in the family ! She 's all right — quite right ; there 's no need to be uneasy about her . I 'll show you the letter she wrote me . "
68212	68219	68220	68220	he	57	" There , you read that , "
68404	68416	68417	68417	she	58	" If you and father get into any very great muddle , "
68420	68462	68417	68417	she	58	" you must let me know . Put an advertisement — one word , ' Johnny , ' will do — in a paper ; I shall understand , and , if I can , I will try to do something . "
68534	68538	68539	68539	he	75	" Thank you , "
68542	68584	68539	68539	he	75	" evidently , as you say , she does not wish to be found , and it would seem she has got some sort of employment , although I am afraid it can not be of an easy or pleasant sort . "
70421	70429	70440	70440	she	1800	" Thanks so much for cutting them , "
70446	70475	70440	70440	she	1800	" I really think they are my favourite flower ; the scent is so delicious — quite the nicest flower of all , do n't you think so ? "
70476	70482	70483	70485	Rawson - Clew	75	" I 'm not sure , "
70499	70512	70494	70494	he	75	" I 'm not sure I do n't sometimes prefer wild thyme . "
71788	71793	71794	71796	Van de Greutz	88	" This is it , "
71799	71865	71794	71796	Van de Greutz	88	" a small quantity only , you see , but the authorities have a ridiculous objection to one 's keeping any large one of explosive . Of course , I have more , in a stone house in my garden ; it is perhaps safer so , seeing its nature , and the fact that one is always liable to small accidents in a laboratory . "
71959	71968	71969	71971	Van de Greutz	88	" The formula I would give for it ? "
72067	72071	72065	72065	herself	58	" quarter pint . "
72109	72111	72065	72065	herself	58	" A. "
72460	72462	72448	72448	she	58	" A "
72557	72569	72570	72570	she	58	" I 'll give him time to put the explosive back , "
72714	72718	72696	72696	they	1831	" More Schiedam ! "
72734	72743	72719	72722	Herr Van de Greutz	88	" Why did you bring an empty bottle ? "
72744	72751	72752	72752	Julia	58	" I am sorry , Mijnheer , "
72755	72769	72770	72770	She	58	" there was not much , I know ; I have brought more . "
72873	72882	72883	72883	she	58	" Shall I take the cups , Mijnheer ? "
72886	72889	72865	72865	She	58	" Yes , "
72900	72917	72890	72892	Van de Greutz	88	" and go to the devil . As I was saying , it is very unstable . "
73009	73014	73015	73017	Van de Greutz	88	" You clumsy fool ! "
73020	73058	73015	73017	Van de Greutz	88	" Get out of here , and do n't let me see your face , or hear your trampling ass - hoofs again ! Do you hear me , I wo n't have you in here again ! "
73065	73071	73072	73072	he	1832	" Have you hurt yourself ? "
73075	73082	73083	73083	Julia	58	" No , Mijnheer , nothing , "
73086	73096	73083	73083	Julia	58	" only a little — my knees and elbows . "
73198	73204	73205	73205	he	1832	" I treated it with — "
73377	73381	73347	73347	She	58	" ass - hoofs "
73390	73398	73404	73404	herself	58	" What a thief I should make , "
73406	73429	73430	73430	She	58	" I believe I could do as well as Grimm 's ' Master Thief , ' who stole the parson and clerk . "
73527	73536	73537	73537	she	58	" He could not have got the stuff , "
73540	73541	73543	73545	Rawson - Clew	75	defiantly—"he "
73562	73589	73559	73559	she	58	" Because he would not get it this way ; he is not rogue enough ; while as for me — I am a born rogue . "
74323	74329	74320	74321	old Marthe	89	" showing the cloven hoof . "
75600	75603	75604	75604	he	66	" Julia ! "
75616	75624	75604	75604	he	66	" Dear , dear , dear me ! "
75625	75628	75629	75629	Julia	58	" Yes , "
75632	75645	75647	75647	she	58	" it really is I. I 'm back again , you see ; "
75655	75660	75661	75661	Johnny	57	" Bless my soul ! "
75664	75674	75661	75661	Johnny	57	" bless my soul ! You 're home again ! "
75675	75718	75719	75720	Mr. Gillat	66	" On my way home ; I ca n't get to Marbridge to - night very comfortably , and I wanted to see you , so here I am . I have arranged with your landlady to let me have a room . "
75745	75752	75753	75753	he	66	" Wo n't you sit down ? "
76155	76165	76166	76166	she	58	" I have left my luggage at the station , "
76169	76228	76166	76166	she	58	" I got out what I wanted in the waiting - room and brought it along in a parcel . I think I 'll take it to my room now , if you do n't mind , and wash my face and get rid of my hat — it is very heavy . I sha n't be long . "
76279	76288	76289	76289	she	58	" You need not order supper , Johnny , "
76292	76299	76289	76289	she	58	" I 've seen about that . "
76309	76314	76315	76315	he	57	" Oh , but , "
76318	76366	76315	76315	he	57	" you should n't do that ; you must n't do that . I 'll tell Mrs. Horn we wo n't have it ; I 'll make it all right with her ; I was just going out to get a — a pork pie for myself . "
76418	76423	76424	76424	Julia	58	" A pork pie ? "
76427	76522	76424	76424	Julia	58	" You have no business to eat such things in the evening at your time of life . I tell you I have settled supper ; we had much better have what I have got . I could not bring you a present home from Holland ; I left in a hurry , so I have bought supper instead . It is my present to you — and myself — I have selected just what I thought I could eat best ; one has fancies , you know , after one has been seasick . "
76716	76719	76720	76720	Julia	58	" Johnny ! "
76723	76736	76720	76720	Julia	58	" what extravagance ! It 's quite a warm night , too ! "
76741	76759	76760	76760	he	57	" I thought you 'd be cold after your journey ; you look quite pale and pinched , "
76763	76771	76760	76760	he	57	" seasickness does leave one feeling chilly . "
76781	76790	76791	76791	she	58	" It is nice to have a fire , "
76803	76838	76839	76839	She	58	" I do n't need it a bit , but I do n't know anything I should have enjoyed more ; why , I have n't seen a real fire since I left England ! "
77142	77149	77150	77150	Julia	58	" Now tell me about things , "
77208	77217	77218	77218	she	58	" I suppose father has been to town ? "
77238	77244	77218	77218	she	58	" When did he go ? "
77245	77257	77258	77258	Johnny	57	" He has not been gone much more than a week , "
77261	77289	77258	77258	Johnny	57	" think of that now ! If he 'd stayed only a fortnight more he 'd have been here to - night ; it is a pity ! "
77290	77300	77301	77301	Julia	58	" I do n't think it is at all , "
77305	77313	77301	77301	Julia	58	" the pity is he ever came . "
77322	77327	77328	77328	he	57	" Well , well , "
77331	77365	77328	77328	he	57	" your mother wished it ; she knows what she is about ; she is a wonderful woman , a wonderful woman . I did what you told me , I really did . "
77389	77450	77451	77451	Julia	58	" I went down to Marbridge a week before your father was supposed to be coming to town ; I warned him very likely I should have to go away , just as you said — and the very day I went to Marbridge he came to town , the very day — a week earlier than was talked of . "
77505	77509	77510	77510	she	58	" What happened ? "
77513	77523	77510	77510	she	58	" Did mother send you back to town again ? "
77524	77531	77532	77533	Mr. Gillat	66	" She did not send me , "
77536	77616	77532	77533	Mr. Gillat	66	" but , of course , I had to go , as she said ; there was your father all alone here ; it would be very dull for him ; I could n't leave him . Besides , he is not — not a strong man , it would be better — she would feel more easy if she thought he had his old friend with him , to see he did n't get into — you know . "
77617	77621	77622	77622	Julia	58	" I know , "
77625	77640	77622	77622	Julia	58	" mother told you all this , then she paid your fare back again . "
77641	77647	77648	77649	Mr. Gillat	66	" Not paid my fare , "
77652	77680	77648	77649	Mr. Gillat	66	" a lady could not offer to do such a thing ; do you think I would ever have allowed it ? I could n't you know . "
77769	77772	77773	77773	she	58	" Well , "
77776	77803	77773	77773	she	58	" then you came back to town and looked after father to the best of your abilities ? I suppose you could not do much good ? "
77816	77820	77821	77821	he	57	" You see , "
77825	77839	77821	77821	he	57	" it was very dull for him ; of course he wanted amusement . "
77840	77859	77773	77773	she	58	" And of course he had it , though he could not afford it , and you paid ? "
77860	77878	77821	77821	he	57	" Not to any great extent ; oh , dear no , not to any great extent . "
77879	77909	77773	77773	she	58	" No , because you had not got ' any great extent ' to spend ; what you had , limited the amount , I suppose , nothing else . "
77915	77919	77920	77920	he	66	" Your father , "
77934	77951	77920	77920	he	66	" your father never had a very strong head , he — you know — he — "
77952	77958	77959	77959	Julia	58	" Has taken to drink ? "
77963	77972	77959	77959	Julia	58	" As well as gambling he drinks now ? "
77973	77978	77979	77979	Johnny	57	" Oh , no , "
77983	78137	77979	77979	Johnny	57	" not exactly , that is — he does take more than he used , more than is good for him sometimes ; not much is good for him , you know — he does take more , it is no good pretending he does not . But it was very dull for him ; it did not suit him being here , I think ; he used to get so low in spirits , what with his losses and feeling he was not wanted at home . He thinks a great deal of your mother , and he could not but feel that she does not think much of him to send him away like that ; it hurt him , although , as he said to me more than once , no doubt he deserved it . It preyed on his mind ; he seemed to want something to cheer him . "
78191	78196	78188	78188	she	168	" for his health . "
78216	78225	78214	78214	he	210	" made such a sinner of his conscience , "
78322	78331	78332	78332	she	58	" Why did he go home last week ? "
78338	78345	78347	78347	Johnny	57	" He thought it his duty , "
78352	78383	78384	78385	Mr. Gillat	66	" No , Mrs. Polkington did not send for him , she did not know he was coming ; he decided for himself , he felt it would be better . "
78497	78504	78505	78505	he	57	" Do n't worry about it , "
78510	78547	78548	78548	Julia	58	" things'll look up , they will ; when he 's back at Marbridge with your mother he 'll be all right . She always had a great influence over him , she had , indeed . "
78550	78553	78548	78548	Julia	58	" Yes . "
78587	78595	78596	78596	he	57	" What an old fool I am ! "
78599	78640	78596	78596	he	57	" There 's something I ought to have told you the moment you came in , and I 've clean forgotten it until now ; it 's good news , too ! There is a lawyer wants to see you . "
78641	78645	78646	78646	Julia	58	" What about ? "
78662	78666	78667	78667	Johnny	57	" A legacy , "
78697	78701	78689	78689	she	58	" How much ? "
78702	78712	78713	78714	Mr. Gillat	66	" Not a great deal , I 'm afraid , "
78720	78747	78713	78714	Mr. Gillat	66	" still , a little 's a help , you know ; it may be a great help ; you remember your father 's Aunt Jane ? "
78803	78813	78816	78816	she	128	" one of my husband 's people in Norfolk ; "
78996	79008	79009	79009	Julia	58	" I had better go to his office to - morrow , "
79012	79021	79009	79009	Julia	58	" I suppose you know where it is ? "
79070	79085	79086	79086	Julia	58	" I suppose no other benefactor came inquiring for me while I was away ? "
79110	79113	79090	79090	she	58	" No , "
79119	79150	79114	79115	Mr. Gillat	66	" I 'm afraid not ; no one else asked for you . At least , some one did ; a Mr. Rawson - Clew came here for your address . "
79151	79156	79157	79157	Julia	58	" Did he though ? "
79160	79173	79157	79157	Julia	58	" Did he , indeed ? What did he want it for ? "
79174	79182	79114	79115	Mr. Gillat	66	" Well , I do n't know , "
79189	79229	79183	79183	Johnny	57	" I do n't know that he gave any reason exactly ; he said he had met you in Holland . I thought he was a friend of yours , he seemed to know a good deal about you . "
79230	79236	79237	79237	Julia	58	" He was a friend , "
79240	79258	79237	79237	Julia	58	" that was quite right . And so he came for my address . When was this ? "
79269	79277	79266	79266	Julia	58	" Why did he come to you ? "
79293	79303	79304	79304	he	66	" But he really came to see your father , "
79307	79313	79314	79314	Julia	58	" Did he see him ? "
79317	79340	79341	79341	Johnny	57	" No , he was out . To tell the truth , I do n't believe your father ever knew he came , "
79344	79384	79341	79341	Johnny	57	" I meant to tell him , of course , but he was late home that day , and when he came he was — was — well , you know , he couldn't — it did n't seem — "
79385	79388	79390	79390	Julia	58	" Yes , "
79397	79430	79390	79390	Julia	58	" he was drunk and could not understand , and afterwards you forgot it ; it does not matter ; indeed , it is better so ; I am glad of it . "
79462	79468	79469	79469	he	66	" He gave me this , "
79472	79502	79469	79469	he	66	" and told me to let him know if I heard from you , if you were in any trouble , or anything — if I thought you were . "
79509	79518	79519	79519	she	58	" You had better give it to me , "
79522	79536	79538	79538	she	58	" I 'll let him know all that is necessary . Thank you ; "
80253	80261	80262	80262	she	58	" It is more than I thought , "
80273	80378	80262	80262	she	58	" Fifty pounds a year , a small house — not much more than a cottage — and a garden and field ; that 's about what it comes to . The house is not worth much ; it is in an unget - at - able part of Norfolk , in the sandy district towards the sea — the man spoke as if I knew where that was , but I don't — and the garden and field are not fertile . I do n't suppose one could let the place , but one could live in it , if one wanted to . "
80379	80384	80385	80385	Johnny	57	" Yes , yes , "
80388	80412	80385	80385	Johnny	57	" of course ; you will have your own estate to retire to ; quite an heiress — your mother will be pleased . "
80475	80489	80490	80490	Julia	58	" Why do you think Great - aunt Jane let it to me ? "
80493	80608	80490	80490	Julia	58	" Because I went out to work ! It seems that father and we three girls are the nearest relations she had , and though we knew nothing about her , she made inquiries about us from time to time . When she heard I had gone abroad as companion or lady - help , she said she should leave all she had to me because I was the only one who even tried to do any honest work . You know that is not really strictly fair , because I did not altogether go with the idea of doing honest work ; although , certainly , when I got there I did it . "
80842	80852	80889	80889	I	0	" and if you make a fuss about it , "
80864	80888	80889	80889	I	0	" I shall trim ' Bouquet ' to stink next time you come to Marbridge , and not come and sit with you . "
81394	81398	81384	81384	they	3439	" quick work , "
81400	81405	81384	81384	they	3439	" like those Polkingtons . "
81656	81658	81654	81654	she	64	" Yes "
81663	81674	81654	81654	she	64	" Do n't you think you 'd better marry me ? "
81736	81757	81758	81758	she	60	" It is no use pretending that I should not have been more pleased if he had been better connected , "
81773	81783	81758	81758	she	60	" I share your opinion , dear Mrs. — — "
81792	81876	81758	81758	she	60	" about the value of birth ; but one ca n't have everything ; he is a most able man , and really charming . It is such a good thing that he is so much older than Chèrie ; I always felt she needed an older man to guide and care for her — he is positively devoted to her ; you know , the devotion of a man of that age is such a different thing from a boy 's affection . "
81923	82055	81916	81917	Mr. Polkington	133	" No , he is going , and going almost directly ; that is my one hardship ; I have got to lose Chèrie at once , for he positively will not go without her . Of course , it would be a thousand pities for him to throw it up , such an opening ; so very much better than he would ever have here , but it is hard to lose my child — she seems a child to me still — almost before I have realised that she is grown up . Their passages are taken already ; they will be married by license almost directly ; there even wo n't be time to get a trousseau , only the merest necessaries before the luggage has to go . "
82830	82845	82846	82846	she	58	" I 'm not coming back to it , no , I 'm not , "
82852	82864	82846	82846	she	58	" the corduroy and onions would be a great deal better . "
82878	82884	82885	82885	she	64	" What did you say ? "
82892	82895	82896	82896	she	58	" Nothing , "
82899	82913	82896	82896	she	58	" only that I am not coming back to this sort of life . "
82914	82918	82919	82919	Chèrie	64	" To Marbridge ? "
82922	83010	83011	83011	Julia	58	" or to the house ? If it is the house you mean , you need not trouble about that ; there is n't much chance of your being able to go on living here ; you will have to move into something less expensive . I am sure Uncle William will insist on it . There is more room than you will want here after I am gone , and as for appearance and society , there wo n't be much object in keeping that up . "
83014	83031	83032	83032	she	58	" You do n't think I am a sufficiently marketable commodity to be worth much outlay ? "
83035	83068	83032	83032	she	58	" You are quite right ; besides , it is just that which I mean ; I have come to the conclusion that I do n't admire the way we live here . "
83069	83074	83075	83075	Chèrie	64	" So have I , "
83078	83115	83075	83075	Chèrie	64	" no one in their senses would ; but it was the best we could do in the circumstances and before you grumble at it you had better be sure you do n't get something worse . "
83132	83172	83126	83126	Chèrie	64	" Oh , of course you have got £ 50 a year , I know , but you ca n't live on that ; besides , I expect Uncle William will want you to do something else with it . "
83173	83181	83182	83182	Julia	58	" I shall do what I please , "
83637	83646	83647	83647	he	137	" You will have to leave this house , "
83650	83771	83772	83772	he	137	" sell what you can of its contents and pay all that is possible of your debts . You wo n't be able to pay many with that ; the rest I shall have to arrange about , I suppose . Oh , not pay ; do n't think that for a moment ; I 've paid a deal more than I ought for you long ago . I mean to see the people and arrange that you pay by degrees ; you will have to devote most of your income to that for a time . What will you live on in the meanwhile ? This legacy — it is you who have got it , is n't it ? "
83779	83830	83831	83831	he	137	" I thought so . Fortunately the money is not in any way tied up , you can get at the principal . Well , the best thing to be done is to buy a good boarding - house . You could make a boarding - house pay , Caroline , "
83838	83858	83831	83831	he	137	" if you tried ; your social gifts would be some use there — you will have to try . "
83870	83881	83867	83867	Violet	101	" It would be rather degrading , would n't it ? "
83882	83894	83895	83896	her uncle	2085	" Not so degrading as being sued at the county court , "
84003	84013	84014	84014	he	172	" And what part have I in this scheme ? "
84035	84044	84045	84045	he	172	" Well , I really do n't know , "
84050	84060	84045	84045	he	172	" of course you would live in the house . "
84061	84077	84078	84079	The banker	2090	" A burden on my wife and daughter ! Idle , useless , not wanted ! "
84235	84244	84225	84225	Julia	58	" What part have I in this scheme ? "
84245	84252	84253	84253	he	172	" You will help your mother , "
84256	84304	84253	84253	he	172	" and of course the concern will be nominally yours ; that is to say , you will put your money in it , invest it in that instead of railways or whatever it is now in . I shall see that the thing is properly secured . "
84332	84336	84328	84328	Julia	58	" I see , "
84386	84400	84401	84401	he	172	" It is of no use for you to get any nonsensical ideas , "
84404	84465	84401	84401	he	172	" about what you will do and wo n't do ; this is the only thing you can do ; you have got to make a living , and you have got to pay your debts ; beggars ca n't be choosers . The fact is , you have all lived on charity so long that you have got demoralised . "
84469	84472	84473	84473	she	101	" Really , "
84478	84499	84473	84473	she	101	" though you have helped us once or twice , I do n't think you have the right to insult — "
84959	84976	84979	84979	herself	58	" I might save it in time ; I could do without this — and this , "
85237	85241	85242	85242	she	58	" Uncle William , "
85245	85264	85242	85242	she	58	" I have been thinking over your plan , and I do n't think I quite like it . "
85265	85271	85272	85273	her uncle	2085	" I dare say not , "
85276	85302	85272	85273	her uncle	2085	" I can believe it ; but that 's neither here nor there , as I said last night , beggars ca n't be choosers . "
85343	85354	85355	85355	she	58	" Perhaps I had better say just what I mean , "
85359	85368	85355	85355	she	58	" I am not going to do it . "
85369	85374	85375	85376	Mr. Ponsonby	137	" Not going to ? "
85380	85423	85375	85376	Mr. Ponsonby	137	" Do n't talk nonsense ; you have got to , there 's nothing else open to you ; I 'm not going to keep you all , feed , clothe and house you , and pay your debts into the bargain ! "
85424	85427	85429	85429	Julia	58	" No , "
85431	85444	85429	85429	Julia	58	" no , naturally not ; I did not think of that . "
85445	85454	85455	85456	her uncle	2085	" What did you think of , then ? "
85491	85516	85474	85474	her	58	" What do you object to ? I suppose you do n't like the idea of paying debts ; none of you seem to . "
85517	85520	85521	85521	Julia	58	" No , "
85524	85549	85521	85521	Julia	58	" it is n't that ; of course the debts must be paid in the way you say , it is the only way . "
85550	85558	85559	85560	the banker	2090	" I am glad you think so , "
85564	85602	85559	85560	the banker	2090	" though I may as well tell you , young lady , that it would still be done even without your approval . What is it you do n't like , spending your money for other people ? "
85608	85617	85618	85618	she	58	" We may as well call it that , "
85621	85632	85618	85618	she	58	" I do n't like the boarding - house investment . "
85633	85653	85521	85521	Julia	58	" What do you like ? Seeing your parents go to the poorhouse ? That 's what will happen . "
85654	85752	85618	85618	she	58	" No , they can come and live with me . I have got a large cottage , a garden , a field , and £ 50 a year . If we keep pigs and poultry , and grow things in the garden we can live in the cottage on the £ 50 a year till the debts are all paid off ; after that , of course , we should have enough to be pretty comfortable . We need not keep a servant there , or regard appearances or humbug — it would be very cheap . "
85753	85757	85758	85759	her uncle	2085	" And nasty , "
85783	85789	85790	85790	he	2085	" You are talking nonsense , "
85793	85862	85790	85790	he	2085	" absurd , childish nonsense ; you do n't know anything about it ; you have no idea what life in a cottage means ; the drudgery of cooking and scrubbing and so on ; the doing without society and the things you are used to ; as for pigs and gardening , why , you do n't know how to dig a hole or grow a cabbage ! "
85957	85973	85974	85974	he	2085	" I suppose the utter selfishness of this idea of yours has not struck you , "
85979	86006	85974	85974	he	2085	" You may think you would like this kind of life , though you would n't if you tried it , but how about your mother ? "
86007	86014	86015	86015	Julia	58	" She wo n't like it , "
86018	86081	86015	86015	Julia	58	" but then , on the other hand , there is father . I suppose you know he has taken to drink lately and at all times gambled as much as he could . What do you think would become of him in a boarding - house in some fashionable place , with nothing to do , and any amount of opportunity ? "
86105	86131	86100	86100	his	137	" What will become of your mother keeping pigs and poultry and living in an isolated cottage ? It would be social extinction for her . "
86132	86144	86145	86146	Mr. Ponsonby	137	" The boarding - house would be moral extinction for father . "
86150	86156	86157	86157	he	137	" I suppose you think , "
86161	86211	86157	86157	he	137	" that you have reduced it to this — the sacrifice of one parent or the other . You have no business to think about such things ; but if you had , to which do you owe the most duty ? Who has done the most for you ? "
86212	86215	86216	86216	Julia	58	" Well , "
86220	86351	86216	86216	Julia	58	" I 'm not sure I am considering duty only ; people who do n't pay their debts are not always great at duty , you know . Perhaps it is really inclination with me . Father is fonder of me than mother is ; I have never been much of a social success . Mother did not find me such good material to work upon , so naturally she rather dropped me for the ones who were good material . I admire mother the more , but I am sorrier for father , because he ca n't take care of himself , and has no consolation left ; it serves him right , of course , but it must be very uncomfortable all the same . Do you see ? "
86352	86359	86360	86361	her uncle	2085	" No , I do n't , "
86365	86393	86394	86394	He	2085	" I am old - fashioned enough to think sons and daughters ought to do their duty to their parents , not analyse them in this way . "
86422	86434	86435	86435	she	58	" I should like to do my duty to them both , "
86438	86589	86435	86435	she	58	" and I believe I will do it best by going to the cottage . Father would get to be a great nuisance to mother at the boarding - house after a time , almost as bad as the pigs and poultry at the cottage . Also , if we had the boarding - house , father 's moral extinction would be complete , but if we lived at the cottage mother 's social one would not ; she could go and stay with Violet and other people the worst part of the time , while we were shortest of money . Besides all that , there are two other things ; I like the cottage best myself , and I believe it to be the best — I know the sort of living life we should live at a boarding - house — and then there is Johnny Gillat . "
86620	86625	86626	86626	he	137	" You like it ! "
86629	86678	86626	86626	he	137	" yes , now we have come to the truth ; the person you are considering is yourself ; I knew that all along ; you need not have troubled to wrap it up in all these grand reasons — consideration for your father , and so on ! "
86679	86690	86691	86691	Julia	58	" Oh , but think how much better it sounded ! "
86719	86749	86706	86706	he	137	" You are utterly selfish and ingrain lazy , that 's what you are ; you do n't want to do a stroke of honest work for any one . "
86750	86758	86759	86759	Julia	58	" Dishonest work is where I shine , "
86763	86777	86761	86761	him	137	" Oh , not scoundrelly dishonesty , company promoting , and so on , "
86802	86830	86761	86761	him	137	" I mean real dishonest work ; with a little practice I would make such a thief as you do not meet every day in the week . "
86831	86838	86839	86840	her uncle	2085	" I can quite believe it , "
86844	86898	86839	86840	her uncle	2085	" lazy people generally do take to lying and stealing and , as I say , lazy is what you are . Sooner than work for your living , you go and pig in a cottage , because you think that way you can do nothing all day ; lead an idle life . "
86899	86902	86903	86903	Julia	58	" Yes , "
86907	86950	86903	86903	Julia	58	" I think that must be my reason — a nice comfortable idle life with the pigs and poultry , and garden , and cooking , and scrubbing , and two incompetent old men . I really think you must be right . "
87901	87910	87911	87911	she	58	" You ought to be ashamed of yourself , "
87923	87995	87911	87911	she	58	" I am positively ashamed to think you belong to us . It will be nice to meet Norfolk people at the Palace or somewhere , who have seen you tending your pigs and doing your washing . It is such an unusual name ; I can quite fancy some one being introduced to mother and thinking it odd that her name should be the same as some dirty cottage people . "
87996	87999	88000	88000	Julia	58	" Well , "
88003	88060	88000	88000	Julia	58	" why not change it ? Such a trifle as a name surely need not stand in our way ; we have got over worse things than that . Mother can be something else , or I can ; mother had better do it ; father will forget who he is if I make a change . "
88061	88067	88068	88068	Violet	101	" Do n't be absurd , "
88071	88110	88068	88068	Violet	101	" I only wish you could change it though ; I never want to write to you as Julia Polkington in case some servant were to notice the address ; one never knows how these things come out . "
88111	88118	88119	88120	her sister	556	" Do n't write as that , "
88124	88143	88119	88120	her sister	556	" address me as ' Julia Snooks ' or anything else you like ; I am not particular . "
88195	88203	88192	88192	Julia	58	" That is what I am myself . "
88270	88282	88283	88283	she	60	" Why not choose something simple , like ' Gray ' ? "
88286	88289	88290	88290	Julia	58	" Because , "
88293	88301	88290	88290	Julia	58	" that is what I am not . "
89010	89014	89015	89015	She	443	" at home . "
89174	89178	89160	89160	She	443	" middle - class "
89598	89603	89604	89604	he	393	" As a wife ? "
89607	89644	89604	89604	he	393	" I should not think of her . If I wanted , as I certainly do not , the privilege of paying that kind of woman 's bills , I should not bother to marry her . "
89685	89689	89679	89681	Rawson - Clew	75	" Think so ? "
89801	89809	89812	89812	he	75	" Herr Van de Greutz 's Explosive . "
89816	89848	89849	89849	Hullo	146	" For a moment Rawson - Clew held the bottle , staring at it in blank astonishment ; so tense was his attitude that it caught the other man 's attention . "
89851	89855	89856	89857	some one	3318	" he said , "
89864	89871	89856	89857	some one	3318	" Rawson - Clew roused himself . "
89874	90008	89856	89857	some one	3318	" he answered shortly . He put the bottle back in the box after he had felt in the packing and found nothing , then he fastened it up with more care than was perhaps necessary . He looked at the address on the lid , but it told him nothing more than it had at first ; neither that nor the name of the post - office from which it was sent gave any clue to the sender . And yet he felt as if Julia were at his elbow with that mute sympathy in her eyes which had been there when they talked of failure in the wood on the Dunes . He rose , and taking the box , went towards the door ; the other man watched him curiously . "
90021	90025	90009	90009	One	3325	" he said . "
90035	90044	90031	90031	I	0	" Rawson - Clew looked back to answer ; "
90052	91654	90048	90050	a good comrade	2227	" Then he went home . When he was alone in his chambers and secure from interruption , he opened the box again and took out all the packing , carefully sorting it . But he found nothing , no scrap of paper , no clue of any sort ; he took off the linen rag that fastened in the bottle stopper , but that betrayed nothing either ; and yet he thought of Julia . She was the only person who could know about the explosive . It had never been actually spoken of last summer , but the chances were she knew . She was the only person who could have known or who could have got it . It was like her , so like that he was as sure as if her name were in the box that she was the sender . How she had got the stuff he could not think , he knew the difficulties in the way ; but she had done it somehow , and now she had sent it to him , without name for fear of embarrassing him , without clue , with no desire for thanks — loyal , generous , able little comrade ! He looked up again ; he felt as if she were bodily present ; the whole thing , astounding as he had found it at first , was somehow so characteristic of her . And because of her presence he suddenly wished he had not been to that evening 's entertainment and sat close by his cousin 's wife and heard the things she said , and answered the things she looked . He felt as if he were not clean , as if he had no right to entertain even the ghost of the good comrade . Rawson - Clew was not self - conscious ; it never occurred to him to think if he appeared ridiculous , whether he was alone or in company . He took off his dress coat and flung it aside with a feeling of disgust ; its sleeve had brushed that woman 's bare arm ; he could almost fancy that a suggestion of the scent she used clung to it . He put it out of sight and fetched some other garment before he came back to the thing which had recalled Julia . And yet the girl was no lily - child with the dew of dawn upon her ; he did not for one instant think she was ; probably , had she been , she would not have been the good comrade . The facts of life were not strange to her , she knew them , good and bad ; was not above laughing at what was funny even if it was somewhat coarse , but she had no taste for lascivious wallowing no matter under what name disguised . A man could be at home with her , he could speak the truth to her ; but he would not make a point of taking her into the society of that woman , any more than he would invite a friend to look at the sink , unless there was some purpose to serve . Rawson - Clew took up the bottle and looked at it , and looked at the address card on the lid , all over again ; and there grew in his mind the conviction that he been a remarkable and particular fool . Not because he had taken that holiday on the Dunes , nor yet because he had failed to get the explosive and Julia had succeeded — he be lieved that a man might have average intelligence and yet fail there , for he thought she had more than average . But because he had failed to recognise a fact that had been existent all the time — the need he had for the good comrade . Why had he a better liking for his work than of old ? Because it was such as she would have liked , could have done well , every now and then he fancied her there . Why did he find new pleasure in the hours he spent reading Renaissance Italian , old memoirs , the ripe wisdom of the late Tudors and early Stuarts ? Because he found her in the pages , saw her laugh sometimes , heard her contradict at others ; felt her , invisible and not always recognised , at his elbow . He looked round ; why should not the presence be fact instead of fancy ? He would go to Mr. Gillat and find her whereabouts ; if Julia was in England , as she probably was , seeing that the box was posted in London , the old man would know where she was . He would go to Berwick Street — he looked at the clock — no , not now ; it was too late , or rather too early ; he would have to wait till the morning was a good deal older . Unfortunately the carrying out of the plan did not prove very successful . Berwick Street he found , and No . 31 he found , but not Mr. Gillat ; he was gone and had left no address . Mrs. Horn did not seem troubled by the omission ; he had paid everything before he went away , and he practically never had any letters to be sent on ; why , she asked , should she bother after his address ? Rawson - Clew could not tell her why she should , nor did he give any reason why he himself should . He went away and , reversing the order of his previous search , went to Marbridge . But failure awaited him there , too . When he came to the Polkingtons ' house he found it empty , the blinds down , the steps uncleaned , and bills announcing that it was to let in the windows . He stood and looked at it in the grey afternoon , and for a moment he was conscious of a feeling of desolation and disappointment which was almost absurd . He turned away and began to make inquiries about the family . He soon learnt all that was commonly known . They had been gone from East Street some little time now ; they must have left before the box containing the explosive was posted . Julia had sent it to Aunt Jane 's lawyer , before she set out for the cottage , asking him to dispatch it at a given date , and he had fulfilled her request , thinking it a wedding present and the date specified one near the impending ceremony . This , of course , Rawson - Clew did not find out ; he found out several things about the Polkingtons though , their debts and difficulties , their sale and the break up of the family . He also found out that the youngest Miss Polkington was married and the second , and now only remaining one , had come home before the break up . As to where the family were now , that was not quite so clear ; Mrs. Polkington was with one of her married daughters ; her address was easily obtainable and apparently considered all that any one could require , and quite sufficient to cover the rest of the family . Captain Polkington — nobody thought much about him — when they did , it was generally concluded he was with his wife . As for Julia , she must have got a situation of some sort — unless , which was unlikely , she was with her parents . Rawson - Clew took Mrs. Polkington 's address — it was all he could get — and determined to write to her . It did occur to him to write to Julia at her sister 's house and request that his letter was forwarded ; but he did not do so ; he was not at all sure she would answer ; he wanted to see her face to face this time . He wrote to Mrs. Polkington and asked her for Julia 's address , introducing himself as a friend met in Holland , and explaining his reason , vaguely to be connected with that time . When Mrs. Polkington received the letter she thought it over a little ; then she showed it to Violet , and they discussed it together . At the outset they made a mistake ; they only knew of one person of the name of Rawson - Clew — the Captain 's young acquaintance ; he had certainly gone away from Marbridge last spring and so in point of time could have met Julia in Holland , only it was not likely that he had , or that he had become friendly with her . At least so Violet said ; Mrs. Polkington , who knew what remarkable things herself and family could do in the way of getting to know people , was inclined to think differently . On one point , however , they were agreed ; it would be very unpleasant to have to tell one in the position of Mr. Rawson - Clew about Julia 's present proceedings . Giving the address would be giving the information , or something like it — one would have to explain—"Miss
91665	91666	90048	90050	a good comrade	2227	" "
91673	91679	91667	91667	We	2229	" Violet said with decision . "
91691	91706	91683	91683	I	0	" Mrs. Polkington suggested . But Violet did not think that would do either . "
91712	91716	91707	91707	Julia	58	" she said ; "
91738	91745	91746	91746	I	0	" Mrs. Polkington did know it . "
91752	91766	91748	91748	you	2230	" she said , with the air of one convinced against her will ; "
91828	91844	91845	91845	I	0	Marbridge"—she never forgot that his circle there did not think her good enough to know . "
91993	92142	91983	91983	you	2241	" So she kept on that side , which , being , interpreted meant leaving Rawson - Clew 's information much where it was before . She wrote very nicely , somewhat involved , not at all baldly ; but reduced to plain terms her letter came to this — she was not going to tell Julia 's address or anything about her . So Rawson - Clew read it , and very angry he was . And the worst of all was that on the same night that he received this letter , he also received orders to go at once to Constantinople . He had no time for anything and no choice but to go and leave the search . But during his journey across Europe an idea came to him with the suddenness of an inspiration . He knew what Julia had done — she had "
92145	92396	91983	91983	you	2241	" even as she had said she hoped to on the first day they walked together . She had retired somewhere from shams and hypocrisy , from society and her family ; possibly even she had adopted the corduroy and onions part of the ambition ; if so , that would ex plain her mother 's refusal , based on some kind of pride , to give her address . She had retired , and she had taken Johnny Gillat with her , and her own people had washed their hands of her ! He knew now what to look for when he should come back . He might not be back for two months or even three , but when he did come he would be able to find Julia and talk to her about the explosive — and other things . It may be here said that the wonderful explosive did not do what was expected of it , either in England or Holland , for it was found to decompose on keeping . It did everything else that was boasted of it , but no one succeeded in keeping it more than fifteen months , an irremediate defect in an explosive for military purposes . This , of course , was not discovered at first , and the honour and glory of obtaining the specimen was considerable , if only there had been some one to take it . Rawson - Clew did not consider himself the person .
93220	93222	93173	93173	her	58	" Bouquet "
93395	93411	93392	93392	she	58	" How cubby it looks ! Why , you have got the tea all ready , and"—sniffing
93413	93424	93392	93392	she	58	air—"I believe you are making toast ; that is nice ! "
93454	93469	93470	93470	she	58	" It will give you good time to finish the toast while it boils , "
93473	93490	93470	93470	she	58	" toast ought not to be hurried , you know ; yours will be just right . "
94066	94076	94077	94077	he	172	" You will have a great deal to carry , "
94080	94083	94084	94084	Julia	58	" Yes , "
94087	94094	94084	94084	Julia	58	" but I shall manage it . "
94095	94107	94108	94109	her father	210	" It is not fit for you to go about alone , "
94135	94173	94131	94131	she	58	" It would take you and Johnny too long to walk into the town ; we ca n't afford to spend too long on the way , and we ca n't afford a cart to take us . "
94215	94227	94228	94228	he	172	" It is a strange , a humiliating condition of things , "
94234	94250	94228	94228	he	172	" when a father has to ask his daughter 's permission to go into town . "
94268	94273	94274	94274	he	172	" Ah , but , "
94277	94303	94274	94274	he	172	" gentlemen always have to ask ladies ' permission before they can accompany them anywhere — especially when it is the lady of the house . "
95880	95888	95889	95889	she	58	" I suppose father would not come ? "
95906	95911	95912	95912	Johnny	57	" Oh , no , "
95915	95944	95912	95912	Johnny	57	" it was not that ; I 'm sure he would have come if he had been in when I started , but he was not back then . "
95945	95949	95950	95950	Julia	58	" Not back ? "
95953	95961	95950	95950	Julia	58	" Why , where has he gone ? "
95962	95965	95966	95966	Johnny	57	" Well , "
95970	96019	95966	95966	Johnny	57	" he said he was going to get fir - cones , but I 'm not sure , I did n't see him go across the heath . Still , I dare say he went — he took a basket , so I think he must have gone . "
96030	96043	96044	96044	she	58	" There is not anywhere much about here where he can go , "
96067	96089	96044	96044	she	58	" There is only the one road , and that goes to Halgrave , and there is nowhere for him there . "
96090	96097	96098	96098	Johnny	57	" No , oh , no , "
96101	96108	96098	96098	Johnny	57	" there really is nowhere there . "
96109	96119	96120	96120	Julia	58	" There is the ' Dog and Pheasant , ' "
96125	96137	96120	96120	Julia	58	" but he would not get anything he cared about there . "
96138	96141	96142	96143	Mr. Gillat	66	" No , "
96147	96250	96142	96143	Mr. Gillat	66	" besides he would not go there , he would not sit in a small country public house and — er — and — sit there — and so on — he would not think of going to such a place . It is one thing when you are out in the country for a day 's fishing or something , to have a glass of ale and a piece of bread and cheese at an inn , but the other is quite different ; he would n't do that — oh , no . To sit in a little bar and — "
96251	96254	96255	96255	Julia	58	" Booze , "
96260	96294	96255	96255	Julia	58	" Johnny , you are always a wonder to me ; how you have contrived to live so long and yet to keep your belief in man unspotted from the world beats me . "
96303	96310	96311	96311	he	57	" Well , but your father — "
96314	96321	96322	96322	Julia	58	" My father is a man , "
96325	96441	96322	96322	Julia	58	" and I would not undertake to say a man would not do anything — on occasions — or a woman either , for the matter of that . There is a beast in most men , and an archangel in lots , and a snob , and a prig , and a dormant hero , and an embryo poet . There are great possibilities in men ; you have to watch and see which is coming out top and back that , and then half the time you are wrong . Of course , at father 's age , possibilities are getting over ; one or two things have come top and stay there . "
96463	96466	96467	96467	he	66	" Look , "
96476	96514	96467	96467	he	66	" he must have gone after fir - cones ; you see the basket has gone ; he took it with him ; I am sure he would not have taken it to the ' Dog . ' "
96515	96524	96525	96525	Julia	58	" I believe their whisky is very bad , "
96542	96558	96525	96525	Julia	58	" I 'll give him another hour before I set out to look for him . "
96620	96625	96626	96626	he	210	" Dog and Pheasant , "
96931	96944	96945	96945	he	172	" Am I to be dependent for the rest of my days ? "
96959	96970	96971	96971	he	172	" Am I to be dictated to at every turn ? "
96979	96982	96983	96983	she	58	" No , "
96986	96999	96983	96983	she	58	" I do n't think there will be any need for that . "
97026	97055	97009	97009	he	59	" Are my goings out and comings in to be limited by my daughter ? Am I to ask her permission before I accept hospitality or make friends ? "
97056	97059	97061	97061	Julia	58	" Friends ? "
97063	97084	97061	97061	Julia	58	" Then it was not ' The Dog and Pheasant ' you went to , yesterday ? I thought not . "
97085	97091	97092	97093	her father	210	" Then you thought wrong , "
97097	97103	97092	97093	her father	210	" I did go there . "
97104	97109	97110	97110	Julia	58	" To begin with , "
97113	97129	97110	97110	Julia	58	" but you came across some one , and went on — is that it ? "
97200	97204	97196	97203	some one at the " Dog and Pheasant	4193	" Dog and Pheasant "
97266	97276	97258	97258	Julia	58	" Perhaps you had better not go there again . "
97277	97286	97287	97288	Captain Polkington	59	" I shall certainly go when I choose , "
97291	97308	97287	97288	Captain Polkington	59	" I should like to know what is to prevent me and why I should not ? "
97314	97324	97325	97325	she	58	" Shall we say because it is too far ? "
97556	97560	97520	97520	she	58	" Dog and Pheasant "
99639	99653	99636	99636	he	172	" I wonder if you think you do any good by this nonsense ? "
99679	99685	99686	99686	he	57	" There must be teachers , "
99698	99706	99686	99686	he	57	" and there are n't many about . "
99707	99714	99715	99716	the Captain	172	" You are a fine teacher ! "
99733	99738	99739	99739	he	66	" I was wild , "
99742	99762	99739	99739	he	66	" yes , I was , I do n't think — but then the rector said — and Julia — "
99784	99873	99776	99776	he	172	" I should never have expected it of you ; if any one had told me that you , one of us , would take to this sort of thing , I would not have believed it . I mean , if they had told me in the old days , before things were changed and broken up , when we were still alive and things moved at a pace — when a man knew if he were alive or dead and whether it was night or morning . "
99874	99879	99880	99880	Johnny	57	" Yes , yes , "
99897	99911	99888	99888	he	57	" things were different then ; we did n't think of it then . "
99912	99919	99920	99921	the Captain	172	" Teaching in the Sunday school ? "
99924	99951	99920	99921	the Captain	172	" Not quite ! And if we had , we should n't have thought of coming to it even when we had got old and foolish . "
99966	99975	99976	99976	he	57	" There was n't a Sunday school there , "
99979	99986	99976	99976	he	57	" You remember the hill station ? "
99995	100027	99989	99989	Julia	58	" Father , I believe we might have a dish of turnip tops if you would get them . Johnny , you will be late if you do n't start soon . "
100176	100183	100184	100184	she	58	" Who is that , Johnny ? "
100209	100215	100216	100216	he	77	" I do n't know , "
100219	100224	100216	100216	he	77	" a young man . "
100241	100251	100252	100252	she	58	" Put the meat where it will keep hot , "
100257	100279	100252	100252	she	58	" I expect it 's some one who thinks the last people live here still ; fortunately there is enough dinner . "
100296	100299	100300	100300	she	58	" Joost ! "
100303	100313	100314	100314	She	58	" Why , Joost , is it really you ? "
100336	100343	100344	100344	he	77	" Good - morning , miss , "
100355	100374	100344	100344	he	77	" I hope I see you well . I do not inconvenience you — you are perhaps engaged ? "
100375	100379	100380	100380	Julia	58	" Come in , "
100383	100391	100380	100380	Julia	58	" I am glad to see you ! "
100410	100416	100417	100417	he	77	" You are not occupied ? "
100420	100427	100417	100417	he	77	" I do not disturb you ? "
100428	100438	100439	100439	Julia	58	" Yes , occupied in dishing up the dinner , "
100442	100459	100460	100460	she	58	" which is just the best of all times for you to have come . Johnny ! "
100463	100470	100460	100460	she	58	" Johnny , Joost is here . "
100494	100507	100508	100508	Julia	58	" This is Mr. Gillat , a very old friend of mine , "
100522	100532	100512	100512	Joost	77	" I hope that you are well , sir . "
100945	100948	100949	100949	she	58	" Now , "
100954	100966	100949	100949	she	58	" let us come out and talk and look at things . "
101036	101040	101041	101041	she	58	" Come along , "
101067	101073	101041	101041	she	58	" Come and see it . "
101089	101097	101098	101098	she	58	" The blue daffodil , of course , "
101105	101112	101113	101113	he	90	" You have got it here ? "
101116	101123	101113	101113	he	90	" You have not sold it ? "
101124	101128	101098	101098	she	58	" Certainly not . "
101129	101135	101136	101136	he	90	" But why — why ? "
101143	101172	101136	101136	he	90	" You wanted money , it was for that you wanted the bulb , to sell ; you told me so . Do you not want money now ? "
101173	101178	101179	101179	Julia	58	" Oh , yes , "
101182	101194	101179	101179	Julia	58	" but that is an incurable disease hereditary in our family . "
101195	101201	101202	101202	he	90	" You do want money ? "
101206	101226	101227	101227	Julia	58	" This inheritance is small , not enough ? Why , then , did you not sell the bulb ? "
101232	101239	101240	101240	she	58	" I could not very well , "
101243	101267	101240	101240	she	58	" But why not ? You thought to do so at one time ; your intention was to sell it if you had — "
101268	101317	101318	101318	Joost	90	" Stolen it ? Yes , that is quite true , and it would not have mattered then . If I had stolen it I might as well have sold it ; one dishonourable act feels lonely without another ; it generally begets another to keep itself company . "
101324	101328	101329	101329	he	90	" But why , "
101341	101378	101379	101379	Julia	58	" why did you not sell it ? It was for that I gave it to you , to do with as you pleased ; I knew you would do only what was right and necessary . "
101413	101448	101409	101409	she	58	" That was one reason why I could not sell it . You expected me to do right , so I was obliged to do it ; faith begets righteousness as dishonour begets dishonour . "
101449	101456	101457	101457	he	90	" I do not quite understand , "
101466	101469	101470	101470	she	58	" No , "
101473	101544	101470	101470	she	58	" we always found it difficult to make things quite plain , it is no use trying now . Come and see the daffodil , you will understand that , at all events , and better than I do . It is not quite fully out yet , but very nearly , and — please do n't be disappointed — it is not a real true blue daffodil at all . "
101715	101718	101719	101719	he	90	" Ah ! "
101723	101732	101719	101719	he	90	" ah , it is beautiful , wonderful ! "
101837	101844	101845	101845	Julia	58	" Is it what you wished ? "
101864	101871	101872	101872	he	90	" I did not wish it , "
101875	101913	101872	101872	he	90	" because I did not foresee it . No one could foresee that it would come , though it always might . It is a novelty , an accident of nature perhaps , but beautiful , wonderful ! "
101914	101921	101922	101922	Julia	58	" Is it a real novelty ? "
101925	101948	101872	101872	he	90	" Just as much as your first blue daffodil was ? Oh , I am glad ! Then you have two now . "
101949	101952	101953	101953	Joost	90	" I ? "
101958	101976	101953	101953	Joost	90	" No , not I ; this is yours , not mine ; you have grown it . "
101977	101982	101983	101983	Julia	58	" That 's nothing , "
101987	102019	101983	101983	Julia	58	" you gave me the bulb ; it is really your bulb ; I only just put it into the ground , I have had nothing to do with the novelty . "
102219	102227	102192	102192	she	58	" Medes and Persians which alter not , "
102241	102246	102251	102251	he	90	" It is yours , "
102266	102280	102251	102251	he	90	" the great honour is yours , and I am glad of it . "
102323	102333	102334	102334	she	58	" What am I to do with the honour ? "
102337	102357	102334	102334	she	58	" I do not know , that is one reason why it is absurd for me to have it . "
102358	102365	102366	102366	he	90	" You must name your flower , "
102370	102389	102366	102366	he	90	" and then you must exhibit it . Fortunately you are in time for the show in London . "
102390	102399	102400	102400	Julia	58	" But I ca n't go to London , "
102403	102428	102400	102400	Julia	58	" it is out of the question for me to leave home even if I could afford the fare , which I can not . "
102443	102454	102455	102455	he	90	" I can take the daffodil to London with me , "
102458	102485	102455	102455	he	90	" It must be lifted — you have a flower pot , then it must be tied with care , and it will travel quite safely . "
102486	102489	102490	102490	Julia	58	" But , "
102493	102551	102490	102490	Julia	58	" if it is exhibited with my name , and you say my name as the grower must appear , your father will hear of it and then he will know that you gave me a bulb — it can not be exhibited . I do not care about a certificate of merit or whatever one gets . "
102552	102558	102559	102559	Joost	90	" It must be exhibited , "
102562	102585	102559	102559	Joost	90	" as to my father , he knows already , I have told him ; that does not stand in the way . "
102635	102645	102646	102646	he	90	" Now you must call your flower a name , "
102649	102658	102646	102646	he	90	" as I called mine Vrouw Van Heigen . "
102659	102667	102668	102668	Julia	58	" I will call it after you , "
102678	102704	102672	102672	Joost	90	" That will not do ; the blue daffodil is already a Van Heigen ; there can not be another , it will make confusion . "
102705	102723	102731	102731	he	90	" Well , I 'll call it the honest man , then ; that will be you . "
102737	102742	102745	102745	he	90	" Why not name it after"—he
102750	102754	102745	102745	he	90	" your father , "
102763	102771	102760	102760	he	90	to—"some one of whom you are fond . "
102775	102782	102783	102783	she	58	" I like the honest man , "
102786	102823	102783	102783	she	58	" but as you say it is not suitable , the blue daffodil is really the honest one , this is too mixed — I shall call it after Johnny ; I am fond of him . "
102861	102864	102865	102865	he	90	" Johnny ? "
102868	102902	102865	102865	he	90	" yes , but it is not very pretty ; it does not suggest a beautiful flower . Why not call it after the heroine of some book or a friend or comrade ? Perhaps"—Joost
102905	102915	102865	102865	he	90	human—"he with whom you went walking on the Dunes . "
102916	102919	102920	102920	Julia	58	" Him ? "
102923	103052	102920	102920	Julia	58	" I never thought of that . He was a friend certainly , and a good comrade ; he tried hard to get me out of that scrape ; he would have stood by me if I had let him — the same as you did — you were both comrades to me then . I tell you what , shall I call it ' The Good Comrade ? ' Then it would be after you both and Johnny too ; Johnny would certainly stand by me through thick and thin , share his last crust with me , or father , give me the whole of it . Yes , we will call the daffodil ' The Good Comrade , ' and it shall have three godfathers . "
103124	103127	103128	103128	Julia	58	" Johnny , "
103140	103182	103128	103128	Julia	58	" you are not to tell father how valuable this is . He will find out quite soon enough ; people are sure to bother me to sell it after it has been exhibited , and I am not going to . "
103183	103186	103187	103187	Johnny	57	" No , "
103190	103198	103187	103187	Johnny	57	" of course not , naturally not . "
103256	103265	103268	103271	Miss Snooks of White	147	" Narcissus Triandrus Striatum , The Good Comrade , "
103622	103631	103632	103632	she	152	" It was grown at Halgrave , too , "
103635	103651	103632	103632	she	152	" that is not so very far from your part of Norfolk , is it ? "
103652	103658	103609	103609	she	152	" Fifteen or twenty miles , "
103664	103672	103673	103673	she	152	" Is it so much as that ? "
103676	103698	103673	103673	she	152	" I thought it was nearer ; of course , then , you ca n't tell me anything about the grower . "
103731	103737	103673	103673	she	152	" his part of Norfolk . "
103762	103765	103745	103746	Miss Farham	152	" Blue ? "
103841	103847	103848	103848	he	75	" What is the name ? "
103888	103895	103896	103896	she	152	" ' The Good Comrade , ' "
103908	103916	103917	103917	she	152	" Rather quaint , is it not ? "
103921	103972	103917	103917	she	152	" Easier to remember , too , than some obscure grand duchess , or the name of the grower or his wife after whom new flowers are usually called . The blue daffodil , you know , is called after one of the grower 's relatives — Vrouw Van Heigen . "
103977	103980	103982	103982	he	75	" Yes , "
104084	104089	104142	104143	Miss Farham	152	" The Good Comrade . "
104123	104136	104137	104139	Rawson - Clew	75	" What is the name of the grower of this new flower ? "
104147	104150	104151	104151	he	75	" Snooks , "
104447	104456	104457	104457	Johnny	57	" It sounds like a motor - car , "
104468	104477	104478	104478	Julia	58	" Then it must have lost its way , "
104492	104495	104490	104490	Johnny	57	" Yes . "
104569	104577	104578	104579	the Captain	172	" It certainly is coming this way , "
104582	104594	104578	104579	the Captain	172	" I will go and explain the mistake to the people . "
104896	104899	104900	104900	she	58	" Why ! "
104903	104914	104900	104900	she	58	" I had no idea you were anywhere near here . "
104915	104926	104927	104927	he	172	" I had no idea that you were until recently , "
104960	104967	104968	104968	she	58	" Have you lost your way ? "
104971	104977	104968	104968	she	58	" Not to - day . "
104978	104986	105000	105000	He	172	" Where were you trying to go ? "
104987	104992	104968	104968	she	58	" White 's Cottage . "
104993	104996	104997	104997	she	58	" Oh ! "
105025	105034	105035	105035	she	58	" How did you know I was here ? "
105038	105057	105058	105058	He	172	" There are not many people who could have told you . I have retired , you know . "
105080	105086	105087	105087	he	172	" I observe the retirement , "
105090	105095	105087	105087	he	172	" but the corduroy ? "
105096	105106	105107	105107	she	58	" I am wearing out my old clothes first , "
105118	105127	105112	105112	Johnny	57	" Had n't I better water the plants ? "
105144	105151	105152	105152	he	66	" Julia had n't I better — "
105161	105167	105158	105159	the visitor	374	" Ah , Mr. Gillat , "
105173	105198	105168	105170	Rawson - Clew	75	" How are you ? I am glad to see you again ; last time I called at Berwick Street you were not there . "
105206	105212	105213	105213	he	66	" Glad to see you , "
105217	105224	105213	105213	he	66	" very glad , very glad , indeed"—he
105518	105530	105531	105531	Julia	58	" You had better take your boots off here , Johnny , "
105534	105544	105545	105545	She	58	" you have got lots of mud on them . "
105589	105596	105597	105597	he	75	" Are not your stockings wet ? "
105600	105603	105604	105604	she	58	" No , "
105607	105612	105604	105604	she	58	" not a bit . "
105613	105625	105654	105654	Johnny	57	" Are you quite sure ? I think they must be . "
105626	105638	105639	105639	She	58	" No , they are not ; are they , Johnny ? "
105684	105692	105693	105693	she	58	" I was right , you see , "
105696	105702	105693	105693	she	58	" they are quite dry . "
106041	106046	106047	106047	she	58	" Where is father ? "
106059	106066	106067	106067	he	57	" He is up - stairs , "
106074	106100	106067	106067	he	57	" he does not feel well , he says , not the thing ; he 'll have tea up there ; I 'll take it . "
106110	106120	106121	106121	she	58	" He does not feel equal to facing you , "
106124	106129	106130	106130	Johnny	57	" Yes , yes , "
106133	106145	106130	106130	Johnny	57	" that 's it ; that 's what he says — I mean"—suddenly
106150	106159	106130	106130	Johnny	57	saying—"he does not feel equal to facing strangers . "
106160	106170	106171	106171	Julia	58	" Mr. Rawson - Clew is not a stranger , "
106195	106199	106200	106200	she	58	" How odd , "
106209	106236	106200	106200	she	58	" that father should have forgotten you , just as you told me you had forgotten him and all about the time when you saw him . "
106237	106254	106255	106257	Rawson - Clew	75	" I expect he regarded the matter as trivial and unimportant , just as I did , "
106260	106316	106255	106257	Rawson - Clew	75	" though if I told you I had forgotten all about it I made a mistake ; I can hardly say that ; I remember some details quite plainly ; for instance , your position — you stood between your father and me — very much as you did between me and the Van Heigens . "
106317	106322	106323	106323	Julia	58	" I did not ! "
106338	106353	106323	106323	Julia	58	" I did n't stand between you and the Van Heigens . I mean — "
106354	106358	106359	106361	Rawson - Clew	75	" Allow me ! "
106378	106383	106384	106384	Johnny	57	" Dear , dear ! "
106425	106430	106431	106431	he	57	" Such a mess , "
106434	106453	106431	106431	he	57	" and such a waste . Is the cup ready ? Shall I take it up - stairs ? "
106454	106460	106461	106461	Julia	58	" No , thank you , "
106464	106470	106461	106461	Julia	58	" I will take it . "
106886	106895	106896	106896	he	75	" Mr. Gillat , your plants want watering , "
106903	106910	106896	106896	he	75	" They do , they do , "
106914	106925	106911	106911	Johnny	57	" I will have to do them by and by . "
106926	106936	106896	106896	he	75	" Do them now , it is getting late . "
106937	106941	106942	106943	Mr. Gillat	66	" It is , "
106946	106962	106942	106943	Mr. Gillat	66	" we were late with tea , but there 's the drying of the cups . "
106963	106969	106970	106970	Johnny	57	" I will do that . "
107048	107051	107052	107052	she	58	" Well , "
107071	107078	107052	107052	she	58	" what is it you want ? "
107079	107087	107088	107088	he	75	" I want to know several things , "
107095	107108	107088	107088	he	75	" Principally why you called your daffodil ' The Good Comrade ? ' "
107109	107113	107114	107114	she	58	" The daffodil ! "
107136	107139	107140	107142	Rawson - Clew	75	" Yes , "
107145	107157	107140	107142	Rawson - Clew	75	" why did you call it ' The Good Comrade ? ' "
107193	107201	107202	107202	she	58	" I called it after three friends , "
107205	107226	107202	107202	she	58	" who were good comrades to me — you , Johnny and Joost Van Heigen . Why do you ask ? "
107227	107249	107308	107308	she	58	" Because I wondered if it was a case of telepathy ; I also named something ' The Good Comrade . ' "
107250	107253	107254	107254	she	58	" You ? "
107257	107268	107202	107202	she	58	" What did you name ? Was it a dog ? "
107269	107300	107301	107301	Julia	58	" No , a bottle — small , wide - necked , stopper fastened with a piece of torn handkerchief , about two - thirds full of a white powder ! "
107340	107347	107348	107348	she	58	" Why did you name it ? "
107351	107364	107348	107348	she	58	" It is rather odd to do so , is n't it ? "
107365	107378	107379	107379	Julia	58	" I named it after the person who gave it to me . "
107417	107427	107428	107428	he	2614	" Perhaps I did not exactly name my bottle , "
107434	107477	107428	107428	he	2614	" but it stood for the person to me . It was a sort of physical manifestation — rather a grotesque one , perhaps — of a spiritual presence which had not really left me since a certain sunny morning last year . "
107478	107484	107485	107485	Julia	58	" That is very interesting , "
107512	107517	107518	107520	Rawson - Clew	75	" It was interesting , "
107523	107558	107518	107520	Rawson - Clew	75	" but not quite satisfying , at least not to the natural man . He is not content with a manifestation any more than with a spiritual presence ; he wants a corporal fact . "
107620	107627	107628	107628	she	58	" I do n't quite understand , "
107747	107753	107754	107754	he	2614	" Do you not understand , "
107757	107804	107754	107754	he	2614	" It is quite simple ; I have put it to you before , too — not in the same words , but it comes to the same — the plain terms used then were — will you do me the honour of becoming my wife ? "
107828	107845	107824	107824	she	58	" Did you not get my letter , the one I wrote in Holland about that ? "
107846	107890	107739	107741	Rawson - Clew	75	" The one when you told me of your arrangements ? By the way you did not mention that you were going to Van de Greutz 's for the explosive , yes , I got that , but it was scarcely an answer . "
107891	107901	108031	108031	his	2617	" I explained that it meant ' no . ' "
107902	107919	107824	107824	she	58	" In a postscript ; you can not answer a proposal of marriage in a postscript . "
107939	107944	107945	107945	she	58	" Ca n't I ? "
107948	108013	107945	107945	she	58	" Then I will answer it now — no . It was good of you to offer , generous and honourable , but , of course , I should not accept . I mean , I could not even if there had been any need , and , as you see , there was not a particle of need then , still less now . "
108014	108020	108021	108021	he	2617	" No need , no , "
108034	108126	108031	108031	his	2617	" it is not a case of necessity or anything of the sort . Put all that nonsense of justice and honour and gratitude out of the question , you know that it does not come in . I own it did weigh somewhat then , but now — now I want the good comrade ; I do n't deserve her , or a tithe of what she has done for me , but I ca n't do without her — herself , the corporal fact — don't you know that ? "
108127	108130	108131	108131	Julia	58	" No , "
108142	108155	108131	108131	Julia	58	" You do n't know it ? Then I 'll tell you . "
108165	108170	108171	108171	she	58	" Please do n't , "
108174	108197	108171	108171	she	58	" You can not really want me because you do not really know me . Oh , no , you do not ! "
108198	108223	108161	108161	she	58	" I think I do ; I know enough to begin with ; the rest of the ignorance you can remedy at your leisure . "
108224	108230	108231	108231	she	58	" My leisure is now , "
108234	108418	108231	108231	she	58	" I will tell you several things , I will tell you how I got the explosive . I went as a cook and stole like a thief — you could have got it as easily as I if you would have stooped as readily as I did . You admire that ? Perhaps so , now , but you would not if you had seen it being done . That is the sort of thing I do , and I will tell you the sort of thing I like . The day I came home from Holland I did what I liked — as soon as I reached London I went to Johnny Gillat , my dear old friend , who I love better than any one else in the world , and we had a supper of steak and onions in a back bedroom , and we enjoyed it — you see what my tastes are ? Afterwards I heard how father had taken to drink and mother had got into debt — you see what a nice family we are ? "
108427	108435	108436	108436	he	75	" I knew something like this before , "
108439	108458	108436	108436	he	75	" the details are nothing ; I do not see what it has to do with the matter . "
108459	108467	108468	108468	she	2618	" It ought to have a lot , "
108471	108516	108468	108468	she	2618	" But even if you do know it and a good deal more and realise it too , which is a different thing , there is still the other side . I do n't know you , I do n't even know your name . "
108541	108547	108556	108556	she	2618	" H. F. Rawson - Clew "
108551	108555	108556	108556	she	2618	" You see , "
108560	108626	108556	108556	she	2618	" it is a mistake for people who do n't know each other very well to marry , they would always be getting unpleasant surprises afterwards . Besides , it would be so uncomfortable ; it must be pretty bad to live at close quarters with some one you were — who you did n't know very well , with whom you minded about things . "
108726	108730	108731	108731	he	75	" Tell me , "
108743	108752	108731	108731	he	75	" is that how you feel about me ? "
108775	108784	108785	108785	she	2618	" We belong to different lots of people , "
108799	108828	108785	108785	she	2618	" I have got my life here , working in my garden and so on ; and you have got yours a long way off among greater things . "
108829	108836	108837	108837	he	59	" You have not answered me , "
108840	108851	108852	108852	He	59	" Tell me — am I the man you described ? "
108902	108906	108907	108907	she	2618	" Do n't ! "
108927	108931	108932	108932	he	59	" Thank you , "
108935	108940	108932	108932	he	59	" I am answered . "
109473	109478	109479	109479	one	3325	" Oh , why , "
109484	109503	109479	109479	one	3325	" why is not father dead ? If he were dead — if only he had been dead ! "
109731	109735	109736	109736	she	58	" Go away ! "
109739	109747	109736	109736	she	58	" go away ! Do you hear ? "
109787	109790	109791	109791	he	74	" Julia , "
109794	109798	109791	109791	he	74	" Go away ! "
109804	109812	109791	109791	he	74	" Why did you send me away ? "
109813	109820	109791	109791	he	74	" Because I wanted you gone . "
109821	109833	109791	109791	he	74	" Because Captain Polkington is not dead ? Is that it ? "
109834	109848	109849	109849	He	74	" You are a dishonourable eavesdropper ! No , it was n't that . "
109872	109895	109849	109849	He	74	" Do you know it strikes me that you are not strictly honest either , at least not strictly truthful just now . "
109922	109928	109929	109929	she	58	" Will you please go , "
109967	109982	109983	109983	he	74	" If it were not for Captain Polkington would you have sent me away ? "
109986	109993	109994	109994	she	58	" Y — e — s , "
110002	110012	110013	110013	She	58	" Oh , go ! Please , please go ! "
110059	110066	110067	110067	he	74	" No , you would n't , "
110073	110080	110067	110067	he	74	" you would have married me . "
110081	110098	110099	110099	she	58	" I might have said I would , but I should n't really have done it , "
110105	110145	110067	110067	he	74	" I should n't when it came to the point . You had better let me go , I am spoiling your coat , my face is all wet — and I do n't know where my handkerchief is . "
110146	110179	110067	110067	he	74	" Take mine , you will find it somewhere . Tell me , why would you not have married me when it came to the point ? Because your courage failed you ? "
110185	110193	110067	110067	he	74	" I ca n't find that handkerchief . "
110194	110247	110067	110067	he	74	" You have not tried . Are you afraid to try ? Are you afraid of me ? Is that why you would not have married me — you would have been afraid to live at close quarters with me ? Do you still think you do n't know me well enough ? "
110248	110256	110067	110067	he	74	" I do n't know your name . "
110274	110281	110282	110282	he	2657	" Hubert Farquhar Rawson - Clew , "
110286	110289	110282	110282	he	2657	" Now — "
110326	110340	110341	110341	she	58	" I do n't think it matters much what I should have done , "
110344	110373	110341	110341	she	58	" or why , either . Father is not dead ; you ought to know better than to talk about such a thing ; it is bad taste . "
110374	110418	110312	110313	sud denly	156	" Does that matter in the simple life ? I thought when you retired you were going to dispense with falsity and pretences , and say and do honestly what you honestly thought , when it did not hurt other people 's feelings . "
110419	110424	110425	110425	she	58	" So I do , "
110428	110461	110425	110425	she	58	" that is why , when I thought I was alone just now , I asked out loud how it was that father was still alive . Since then I have seen . "
110462	110468	110312	110313	sud denly	156	" What have you seen ? "
110469	110539	110540	110540	He	2658	" That it is to prevent me from making a great muddle of things . If he had been dead I dare say I should have married you — I may as well confess it since you know — and we both should have repented it ever afterwards . As it is , if I were free to - morrow , I would know better than to do it . "
110551	110561	110562	110562	he	2658	" We should have had to talk things over , "
110565	110576	110577	110577	she	58	" No , talking would n't have been any good , "
110580	110589	110577	110577	she	58	" there is a great distance between us . "
110603	110609	110610	110610	he	2658	" That is rather remediable , "
110613	110623	110624	110624	she	58	" Do you think I am not in earnest ? "
110627	110682	110624	110624	she	58	" I am . There is a real barrier ; besides all these things I have mentioned there is something else that cuts me off . I have a debt to pay you and until it is paid , if I were your own cousin , I could not stand on the same platform . "
110683	110687	110688	110688	he	2658	" A debt ? "
110795	110799	110800	110800	he	2658	" What debt ? "
110826	110831	110832	110832	she	58	" You have forgotten ? "
110835	110860	110832	110832	she	58	" I thought you had ; that only shows the distance more plainly ; you have one standard for yourself and another for me . "
110861	110878	110880	110880	she	58	" Tell me what it is and let us see if we can not compound it . "
110885	110892	110893	110893	she	58	" It ca n't be compounded , "
110896	110905	110880	110880	she	58	" you will know when I pay it . "
110906	110913	110832	110832	she	58	" And when will that be ? "
110914	110974	110880	110880	she	58	" Ten years , twenty perhaps , I do n't know . I thought once or twice before I could pay it — with the blue daffodil once , and once when I first got the cottage and things — I thought , to be sure , I could do it ; it seemed a Heaven - sent way . But"—with
110981	111036	110893	110893	she	58	derision—"Heaven knows better than to send those sort of easy ways to the Polkingtons ; they are ill - conditioned beasts who only behave when they are properly laden by fate , and not often then . Now you know all about it , so wo n't you say good - bye and go ? "
111037	111068	110832	110832	she	58	" I do n't know about it and , what is more , I do n't care . I am not going to let this unknown trifle , this scruple — "
111093	111096	111097	111097	Johnny	57	" Yes , "
111101	111122	111097	111097	Johnny	57	" he came to see me in town , you know — or rather you , but you were out — "
111123	111130	111143	111143	his	172	" He came to see me ? He"—there
111184	111189	111190	111190	Julia	58	" There is father , "
111233	111238	111239	111239	he	172	" Good - bye , "
111242	111247	111239	111239	he	172	" for the present . "
111248	111255	111256	111256	she	58	" Good - bye for always , "
111392	111397	111398	111398	he	172	" Good - bye , "
111401	111413	111398	111398	he	172	" good - bye for the present , brave little comrade . "
111650	111654	111646	111647	the visitor	374	were—"your new daffodil . "
111892	111920	111888	111889	the man	820	" Have n't I had the pleasure of seeing you somewhere before , Miss Snooks ? Your face seems familiar though I ca n't exactly locate it . "
111921	111927	111928	111928	Julia	58	" We met at Marbridge , "
111931	111943	111888	111889	the man	820	" at a dance , a year and a half ago . "
111944	111968	111969	111970	Captain Polkington	59	" At Marbridge ? Oh , of course ! Funny I should n't have remembered when I heard your name the other day ! "
112100	112108	112109	112109	he	172	" I remember all about you now , "
112113	112129	112109	112109	he	172	" you danced with me several times and asked me about the Van Heigens ' blue daffodil"—he
112141	112153	112154	112154	he	172	" You were not in the line then , I suppose ? "
112157	112169	112170	112170	she	58	" No , I knew nothing about flower growing or selling , "
112173	112191	112170	112170	she	58	" What you told me of the value of the blue daffodil was a revelation to me . "
112197	112207	112208	112208	he	172	" But one you 'll try to profit by , "
112436	112448	112449	112449	he	79	" Well , if you wo n't , you wo n't , "
112458	112545	112449	112449	he	79	" I think you are making a mistake ; in fact , if you were n't a lady I should say you were acting rather like a fool ; but , of course , you must please yourself . If you think better of it you can always write to me . Just name the price , a reasonable price , that 's all you need do . We understand one another , and we can do business without any fuss — you have my address ? "
112594	112600	112601	112601	he	79	" What did he want ? "
112613	112617	112618	112618	she	58	" The bulb , "
112621	112629	112618	112618	she	58	" And you would not sell it ? "
112630	112633	112634	112634	She	58	" No . "
112650	112659	112660	112660	he	79	" I ca n't understand you , Julia , "
112677	112844	112845	112845	Julia	58	" You seem to have so little sense of honour — women so seldom have — but I should have thought that you would have had a lesson on the necessity , the obligation of paying debts . When you come to think of the efforts we are making to pay those debts , how I am straining every nerve , giving almost the whole of my income , doing without everything but the barest necessaries , without some things that are necessaries in my state of health , what your mother is doing , how she has given up her home , her husband , to live almost on charity in her son - in - law 's house . When you think of all that , I say , and of what your sisters have done , it does seem strange that you should grudge this bulb , simply and solely because it was given you by some people for whom you care nothing . "
112863	112869	112870	112870	she	58	" It does seem strange , "
112873	112930	112870	112870	she	58	" but there is one comfort , the worst of the debts will be cleared off by the end of the year . Uncle William knows that and has arranged for it in his own mind ; I really think it would be almost a pity to disturb the business plans of any one so exact . "
112931	112935	112936	112937	the Captain	172	" Are we , "
112941	112990	112936	112937	the Captain	172	" to pinch and save to the end of the year ? Am I to do without the few comforts that might make life tolerable ? Am I to work like a farm labourer and live like one till then , because you choose to keep this bulb ? "
113019	113029	113015	113015	she	58	" I am sorry you find it so trying . "
113030	113033	113043	113043	he	210	" Trying ! "
113053	113063	113064	113064	he	210	" After all , it does not much matter , "
113073	113202	113064	113064	he	210	" I sha n't be here , in any one 's way , much longer ; there is not the least chance that I shall live till the end of the year , and when I am gone you can do what you please , what you must , with your bulb . I own I should like to see you a little more comfortable and better off now . I hate to have you doing servant 's work and going shabby as you have to . I should like you to be decently dressed , taking your proper place in society , but if you think it right to go on as you are and to keep your bulb , of course I have nothing to say . "
115302	115317	115318	115318	he	59	" You will never be able to tell which is which of these things , "
115331	115345	115323	115323	Johnny	57	" I 've named them , do n't you see ' Tulips ? ' "
115346	115379	115290	115290	he	59	" But you do n't say what sort of tulips , which are red and which yellow . Nor what sort of narcissus , which are daffodils and which the bunchy things . "
115380	115383	115384	115385	Mr. Gillat	66	" No , "
115388	115417	115384	115385	Mr. Gillat	66	" no , they got mixed in the digging up ; I forgot , and put them all in the barrow together ; that 's how it happened . "
115418	115425	115426	115427	the Captain	172	" What ? The whole lot ? "
115430	115442	115426	115427	the Captain	172	" The streaked daffodil and all ? What did Julia say ? "
115443	115451	115452	115452	Johnny	57	" She said it did not matter , "
115456	115473	115452	115452	Johnny	57	" they 'll be all the more surprise to us when they come up next year . "
115474	115487	115426	115427	the Captain	172	" She did n't mind , not even about the streaked daffodil ? "
115488	115496	115497	115498	Mr. Gillat	66	" Oh , that was not there , "
115514	115522	115523	115523	He	66	" We have got that by itself . "
115556	115561	115562	115562	Johnny	57	" That 's it , "
115572	115628	115562	115562	Johnny	57	" And that end one is the red tulip with the black middle ; it is supposed to be very good ; and that other is the double blue hyacinth from down by the gate ; we are going to try it in a pot in the house next year and have it bloom early . "
115640	115651	115652	115652	he	59	" Did you put these here , or did she ? "
115655	115659	115660	115660	Johnny	57	" She did , "
115663	115700	115660	115660	Johnny	57	" She cleans them much better than I do , and we knew they were choice ones , the best one of each kind , so she cleaned them ; but I made the wire cover . "
115776	115779	115780	115780	he	66	" What ? "
115791	115826	115780	115780	he	66	" Oh , all right , you need not have waked me to tell me that , it really is of no importance to me if you like to walk in the blazing sun . "
115898	115901	115902	115902	he	59	" Why , "
115905	115912	115902	115902	he	59	" I must have dropped asleep ! "
115923	115932	115933	115933	he	59	" Let me put these away for you , "
115937	115959	115933	115933	he	59	" it is a great deal too hot for you to be walking in the sun and carrying all these things . "
115960	115964	115965	115965	Julia	58	" Thank you , "
115968	115995	115965	115965	Julia	58	" that 's all right . Perhaps you would not mind getting the tea , though ; if you would do that I should be glad . "
116256	116262	116253	116253	Cross	79	" name a reasonable price , "
116555	116558	116559	116559	I	0	" Sir , "
116616	116620	116621	116622	Alexander Cross	79	" Yours faithfully , "
116624	116625	116621	116622	Alexander Cross	79	" "
116680	116683	116685	116686	the Captain	172	" A. C. "
116870	116881	116882	116882	he	172	" The man can have no idea of my position , "
118629	118638	118639	118639	he	2837	" Not used to it , you know , "
118648	118674	118639	118639	he	2837	" been rusticating out of the way so long . Better come out and get a breath of air , it 'll pull you together . "
119613	119627	119645	119646	The other	338	" I shall get one of them woolly neck things , I shall , "
119631	119644	119645	119646	The other	338	" they 're quite as nice as fur and not so dear . "
119651	119659	119660	119660	she	2885	" Do n't care about them myself , "
119663	119674	119660	119660	she	2885	" I must say I like a bit of sable . "
119675	119685	119686	119687	her companion	684	" Ca n't get it under two and eleven , "
119690	119739	119686	119687	her companion	684	" and those things are only a shilling three . Look at that pink one there ; it looks quite as good as feathers any day . I 'm not so gone on sable myself ; you ca n't have it pink , and pink 's my colour . "
119815	119831	119836	119836	He	441	" Ostrich wool boas in all colours , price , one shilling and three farthings , "
119906	119910	119918	119920	the servant girl	1587	brain—"one shilling and three farthings"—that
119922	119926	119927	119927	He	441	" shilling three . "
120124	120134	120115	120117	the other passenger	2900	" They did n't oughter let him out alone ! "
120927	120936	120945	120945	he	2930	" Thief , and daughter of a thief ; "
121037	121043	121048	121048	them	2934	" Two grubby little people , "
121061	121074	121075	121075	She	58	" But you do n't know ; you have not our temptations . "
121095	121233	121234	121234	Her	2938	" You have never wanted money as I wanted it , or wanted things as father wanted them . Oh , you would despise the things he wanted — so do I ; they are miserable and mean and sordid ; you could n't want whisky and comfort as he wanted them , but you ca n't think how he did ! He would have justified it to himself too ; you would n't , could n't do that , while we — we could justify the devil if we tried . It is not right , any the more for that , I know it is not ; it is dishonest and disgraceful , I know that as well as you ; but I know how it came about and you — you can never understand ! "
121786	121812	121761	121761	she	2938	" Joost , if you have ever cared for me , take back the daffodil ; take it back and do n't ask me why . "
121868	121871	121872	121872	he	57	" Why , "
121875	121882	121872	121872	he	57	" it 's in the shed ! "
121883	121890	121891	121891	Julia	58	" No , it is not , "
121894	121934	121891	121891	Julia	58	" and it never was . The one you think it is one of the large double pale ones ; I told you at the time we put them away , but you have got mixed , I expect . "
121935	121943	121944	121945	Mr. Gillat	66	" Ah , yes , of course , "
121948	121959	121944	121945	Mr. Gillat	66	" I remember now ; of course , I remember . "
122010	122013	122014	122014	he	59	" Julia , "
122022	122037	122014	122014	he	59	" that man Cross thought it was the streaked daffodil that I , that — "
122048	122051	122044	122044	Julia	58	" Well ? "
122052	122066	122068	122068	Julia	58	" I pledged by word of honour that it was the true one . "
122071	122074	122068	122068	Julia	58	" Well ? "
122075	122082	122083	122084	the Captain	172	" What is to be done ? "
122109	122163	122104	122104	He	172	" What on earth have you sold it for ? Nothing would induce you to do so before when I asked you to ; now , all at once you have taken a freak and parted with it without any consideration whatever . I never saw anything like women , so utterly irrational ! "
122164	122171	122172	122172	Julia	58	" I have not sold it , "
122176	122182	122172	122172	Julia	58	" only sent it away . "
122183	122206	122207	122207	Julia	58	" What for ? It is perfectly absurd ! I suppose you can get it back ? You must get it back . "
122209	122213	122215	122215	her	58	" What for ? "
122223	122228	122229	122229	he	172	" There is Cross , "
122232	122283	122229	122229	he	172	" I told him that was the daffodil , and it is not . Something must be done ; we ca n't cheat him ; we must send him the daffodil , or else refund the five pounds . We should have to do that — and we ca n't . "
122284	122287	122288	122288	Julia	58	" No , "
122292	122301	122288	122288	Julia	58	" and we would not if we could . "
122302	122311	122312	122313	her father	210	" But what are you going to do ? "
122316	122319	122312	122313	her father	210	" Nothing . "
122320	122340	122341	122341	Julia	58	" Nothing ! But I pledged my word ! You do n't understand , I am in honour bound . "
122374	122384	122385	122386	the Captain	172	" Cross paid five pounds for the streaked daffodil , "
122403	122439	122394	122394	he	172	" and if he does not have the true bulb he must have the money back ; otherwise he will , with justice , say he has been cheated , for I guaranteed the thing . "
122440	122449	122450	122450	Julia	58	" He paid five pounds for a speculation , "
122453	122516	122450	122450	Julia	58	" your guarantee was nothing , and though he may have asked for it , it was just a form and did not count one way or the other . He knew there was a chance that you had come by the true bulb somehow and so had it to sell ; he risked five pounds on that — and lost it . "
122522	122531	122532	122532	he	59	" He paid five pounds for the bulb , "
122535	122546	122532	122532	he	59	" he said it was worth no more to him . "
122547	122560	122561	122561	Julia	58	" Very likely not , if he could get it for that , "
122564	122584	122561	122561	Julia	58	" but if he could have been sure of it , it would have been worth two hundred pounds . "
122585	122589	122590	122591	Captain Polkington	59	" Two hundred ! "
122601	122606	122607	122607	she	58	" With my guarantee , "
122610	122652	122607	122607	she	58	" You had not got that ; I suppose you let him see it when you wrote first so he knew that , though you might have the real bulb , you were not in a position to sell it well . "
122663	122687	122659	122659	he	172	" You think he thought I had not come by it honestly , that I had no right in my daughter 's affairs ? "
122688	122699	122700	122700	Julia	58	" I do n't see it matters what he thought , "
122708	122756	122700	122700	Julia	58	" He risked his money , and lost it , knowing very well what he did ; he does not mind doing business in that way ; I do n't admire it myself , but I guessed he would do it when I first made his acquaintance . "
122757	122761	122762	122763	the Captain	172	" You — — "
122766	122780	122762	122763	the Captain	172	" I have nothing to do with it , and shall have nothing . "
122781	122801	122802	122802	Julia	58	" But the money must be paid ; it is a debt of honour ; I must clear myself . "
122807	122815	122802	122802	Julia	58	" You do not wish me cleared ? "
122821	122831	122832	122832	she	58	" Paying the five pounds would not clear you , "
122835	122889	122832	122832	she	58	" neither that nor anything else . No , I am not going to pay it ; I do n't feel any obligation in the matter . If Mr. Cross goes in for those sort of dealings he must put up with the consequence , and I am afraid you must , too . "

133582	133645	133579	133579	he	3247	" it is just the same now as if it had been early .

134422	134427	134386	134386	he	66	" Not very soon , "
134448	134452	134453	134453	he	57	" Dear me ! "

134776	134787	134788	134788	he	57	" You could n't go on living with me here , "
134791	134820	134788	134788	he	57	" I mean , I could n't go on living with you ; it would n't be the thing , you know ; you must think of that . "
134836	134888	134831	134831	he	57	" I shall go back to town , to Mrs. Horn ; I shall like it — at least when I get used to it . It is quite time I went back to town ; a man ought not to stay too long in the country ; he gets rusty . "
134889	134898	134899	134899	Julia	58	" You wo n't go back to town , "
134902	134965	134899	134899	Julia	58	" you will never do that . You will stay here in the cottage , and Mrs. Gray from next door to the shop will come and live here as your housekeeper ; I am going to arrange it with her . She will come and she will bring her little grand - daughter and you will keep on living here always . "
134987	134990	134991	134991	he	57	" No , "

135017	135065	135014	135014	Julia	58	" you should always speak the truth — you do anything else so badly ! I do n't mind if you like my plan or not , you will have to put up with it to help me ; some one must take care of the cottage . "
135066	135075	135076	135077	Mr. Gillat	66	" But you will want to come yourself , "
135080	135088	135076	135077	Mr. Gillat	66	" Never , unless you are here . "

135728	135755	135725	135725	she	58	" I can do quite well . Thank you for trying to get it ; all the same I am not sure I want it back . "
135756	135786	135692	135692	he	230	" Do you not ? Then I am quite sure that I do not , indeed , I rather fancy I already have the real ' Good Comrade . ' "
