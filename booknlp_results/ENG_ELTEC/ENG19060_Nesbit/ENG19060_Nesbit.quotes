1929	1998	1999	1999	Jane	134	“ Well , then . We all know the reason we ’re staying here is because Nurse could n’t leave her house on account of the poor learned gentleman on the top‐floor . And there was no one else Father could entrust to take care of us — and you know it ’s taken a lot of money , Mother ’s going to Madeira to be made well . ”

And I thought we must get Nurse to see how quite old we are , and let us go out by ourselves , or else we shall never have any sort of a time at all . And I vote we see everything there is , and let ’s begin by asking Nurse to give us some bits of bread and we ’ll go to St James ’s Park . There are ducks there , I know , we can feed them . Only we must make Nurse let us go by ourselves . ”

3251	3263	3265	3265	Jane	134	“ I do n’t suppose old Nurse would mind very much , ”
3267	3288	3265	3265	Jane	134	“ Rabbits are most awfully tame sometimes . I expect it would know her voice and follow her all about . ”

3304	3309	3302	3302	Cyril	131	“ now a snake — ”
3310	3321	3265	3265	Jane	134	“ There are n’t any snakes , said Robert hastily , “
3337	3338	3333	3333	I	0	” “
3344	3348	3333	3333	I	0	” said Anthea , “
3370	3371	3372	3372	Father	137	” “
3384	3388	3392	3392	he	137	” said Robert . “
3415	3419	3392	3392	he	137	” said Anthea . “
3429	3430	3420	3420	I	0	” “
3440	3447	3420	3420	I	0	” said Jane with a shudder , “
3452	3565	3392	3392	he	137	” They stood there on the pavement , a cause of some inconvenience to the passers‐by , and thus beguiled the time with conversation . Cyril was leaning his elbow on the top of a hutch that had seemed empty when they had inspected the whole edifice of hutches one by one , and he was trying to reawaken the interest of a hedgehog that had curled itself into a ball earlier in the interview , when a small , soft voice just below his elbow said , quietly , plainly and quite unmistakably — not in any squeak or whine that had to be translated — but in downright common English — “
3575	3594	3392	3392	he	137	” Cyril started as though he had been pinched , and jumped a yard away from the hutch . “
3603	3614	3392	3392	he	137	” said the voice , rather louder but still softly ; “
3635	3726	3626	3626	I	0	” Cyril mechanically obeyed . He knelt on one knee on the dry , hot dusty pavement , peered into the darkness of the hutch and found himself face to face with — the Psammead ! It seemed much thinner than when he had last seen it . It was dusty and dirty , and its fur was untidy and ragged . It had hunched itself up into a miserable lump , and its long snail ’s eyes were drawn in quite tight so that they hardly showed at all . “
3729	3750	3751	3751	I	0	” said the Psammead , in a voice that sounded as though it would begin to cry in a minute , “
3890	3913	3923	3923	I	0	” It sniffed , and shot out its long snail ’s eyes expressly to drop a tear well away from its fur . “
3935	3955	3923	3923	I	0	” Cyril tied his bootlace into a hard knot , stood up and addressed the others in firm tones — “
3959	3963	3964	3964	I	0	” he said , “
3976	3989	3970	3970	I	0	” an appeal which in this family was never made in vain . “
4016	4027	4013	4013	I	0	” He stood in front of it to prevent mistakes . “
4095	4167	4068	4068	It	402	” The others responded nobly . They looked at the white rat till they quite stared him out of countenance , so that he went and sat up on his hind legs in a far corner and hid his eyes with his front paws , and pretended he was washing his face . Cyril stooped again , busying himself with the other bootlace and listened for the Psammead ’s further instructions . “
4171	4176	4068	4068	It	402	” said the Psammead , “
4285	4286	4278	4278	you	325	” “
4306	4312	4295	4295	I	0	” said the bewildered Cyril . “
4321	4332	4316	4319	a silly little idiot	407	” said the Sand Fairy in trembling but affectionate tones , “
4353	4415	4349	4349	I	0	” Cyril , pointing a stiff and unmeaning finger at the white rat , so as to pretend that its charms alone employed his tongue , explained matters to the others , while the Psammead hunched itself , and bunched itself , and did its very best to make itself look uninteresting . Then the four children filed into the shop . “
4426	4430	4419	4419	you	325	” asked Cyril . “
4433	4438	4419	4419	you	325	” was the answer . “
4443	4444	4447	4448	five bob	408	” “
4455	4456	4447	4448	five bob	408	” “
4461	4462	4447	4448	five bob	408	” “
4466	4467	4447	4448	five bob	408	” “
4471	4472	4447	4448	five bob	408	” “
4479	4513	4447	4448	five bob	408	” said the greasy owner of all this caged life with a sudden ferocity which made the whole party back hurriedly on to the wainscoting of hutches with which the shop was lined . “
4598	4599	4595	4595	you	325	” “
4606	4626	4595	4595	you	325	” said the wretched Cyril , feeling how foolishly yet well‐meaningly he had carried out the Psammead ’s instructions . “
4650	4661	4635	4635	you	325	” The shopman only saw in this a new insult . “
4667	4671	4705	4705	you	325	” said he ; “
4683	4684	4680	4680	you	325	” “
4693	4702	4705	4705	you	325	” said Jane , losing her head altogether , “
4715	4716	4707	4707	he	414	” “
4724	4773	4721	4721	e	415	” sneered the merchant . Then he scratched his ear suspiciously , for he was a sharp business man , and he knew the ring of truth when he heard it . His hand was bandaged , and three minutes before he would have been glad to sell the “
4777	4784	4788	4788	e	415	” for ten shillings . Now — “
4795	4799	4788	4788	e	415	” he said , “
4866	4906	4908	4908	them	419	” The children looked at each other — twenty‐three shillings and fivepence was all they had in the world , and it would have been merely three and fivepence , but for the sovereign which Father had given to them “
4909	4913	4914	4914	We	420	” at parting . “
4922	4933	4914	4914	We	420	” said Cyril , rattling the money in his pocket . “
4942	4972	4914	4914	We	420	” said the dealer , for he did not believe that Cyril had so much money . There was a miserable pause . Then Anthea remembered , and said — “
4983	4984	4975	4975	I	0	” “
4995	5003	5004	5004	I	0	” said the man with bitter politeness ; “
5014	5041	5010	5010	I	0	” Anthea ’s hand was on the counter , something seemed to slide under it . She lifted it . There lay five bright half sovereigns . “
5051	5055	5010	5010	I	0	” she said ; “
5074	5094	5071	5071	I	0	” The dealer looked hard at the money , but he made haste to put it in his pocket . “
5104	5118	5098	5098	you	422	” he said , shrugging his shoulders . He scratched his ear again . “
5121	5125	5098	5098	you	422	” he said , “
5147	5184	5126	5126	I	0	” He slowly led the way out to the hutch — opened the door gingerly , and made a sudden fierce grab at the Psammead , which the Psammead acknowledged in one last long lingering bite . “
5191	5207	5126	5126	I	0	” said the shopman , squeezing the Psammead so tight that he nearly choked it . “
5219	5232	5126	5126	I	0	” The man ’s eyes opened as Anthea held out her arms . “
5246	5293	5236	5236	me	0	” he said , and the Psammead made a leap from his dirty horny hands , and Anthea caught it in hers , which were not very clean , certainly , but at any rate were soft and pink , and held it kindly and closely . “
5304	5308	5295	5295	you	422	” Cyril said , “
5317	5330	5331	5331	I	0	” and indeed two errand boys and a policeman had already collected . “
5349	5402	5343	5343	we	425	” said the man grudgingly . So the whole party went into the shop , and the shopman ’s eyes nearly came out of his head when , having given Anthea the largest paper‐bag he could find , he saw her hold it open , and the Psammead carefully creep into it . “
5405	5409	5343	5343	we	425	” he said , “
5427	5428	5423	5424	the brute	427	” “
5431	5436	5437	5437	he	427	” said Cyril affably , “
5445	5446	5437	5437	he	427	” “
5454	5459	5460	5460	you	422	” the man rejoined , “
5474	5483	5472	5472	Owever	147	” he added , as the children disappeared , “
5513	5575	5472	5472	Owever	147	” The children trembling in agitation and excitement , carried home the Psammead , trembling in its paper‐bag . When they got it home , Anthea nursed it , and stroked it , and would have cried over it , if she had n’t remembered how it hated to be wet . When it recovered enough to speak , it said — “
5594	5721	5722	5722	You	430	” They got the sand , and they put it and the Psammead in the round bath together , and it rubbed itself , and rolled itself , and shook itself and scraped itself , and scratched itself , and preened itself , till it felt clean and comfy , and then it scrabbled a hasty hole in the sand , and went to sleep in it . The children hid the bath under the girls ’ bed , and had supper . Old Nurse had got them a lovely supper of bread and butter and fried onions . She was full of kind and delicate thoughts . When Anthea woke the next morning , the Psammead was snuggling down between her shoulder and Jane ’s . “
5728	5732	5722	5722	You	430	” it said . “
5808	5809	5802	5802	we	435	” “
5817	5821	5812	5812	you	0	” asked Anthea . “
5831	5835	5824	5824	I	0	” it said ; “
5861	5888	5859	5859	children	437	” With these words it clambered down by the bedclothes and scrambled back into the bath , where they heard it scratching itself out of sight . “
5891	5895	5859	5859	children	437	” said Anthea , “
5912	5913	5905	5905	We	435	” “
5916	5927	5905	5905	We	435	” said Jane , beginning to put on her stockings . “
5952	5953	5905	5905	We	435	” “
5962	5966	5905	5905	We	435	” said Anthea . “
5983	6233	6234	6234	You	438	” LONG ago — that is to say last summer — the children , finding themselves embarrassed by some wish which the Psammead had granted them , and which the servants had not received in a proper spirit , had wished that the servants might not notice the gifts which the Psammead gave . And when they parted from the Psammead their last wish had been that they should meet it again . Therefore they had met it ( and it was jolly lucky for the Psammead , as Robert pointed out ) . Now , of course , you see that the Psammead ’s , being where it was , was the consequence of one of their wishes , and therefore was a Psammead‐wish , and as such could not be noticed by the servants . And it was soon plain that in the Psammead ’s opinion old Nurse was still a servant , although she had now a house of her own , for she never noticed the Psammead at all . And that was as well , for she would never have consented to allow the girls to keep an animal and a bath of sand under their bed . When breakfast had been cleared away — it was a very nice breakfast with hot rolls to it , a luxury quite out of the common way — Anthea went and dragged out the bath , and woke the Psammead . It stretched and shook itself . “
6243	6247	6248	6248	you	438	” it said , “
6258	6259	6248	6248	you	438	” “
6267	6271	6260	6260	We	439	” said Anthea . “
6279	6280	6276	6276	you	438	” “
6285	6303	6274	6274	you	438	” said the Psammead , sitting back on the sand and shooting out its long eyes suddenly , “
6331	6332	6325	6325	I	0	” “
6337	6341	6325	6325	I	0	” Anthea pleaded , “
6376	6448	6373	6374	a dear	441	” She knelt before the sand‐bath and held out her arms . The Psammead must have remembered how glad it had been to jump into those same little arms , only the day before , for it gave a little grudging grunt , and jumped once more . Anthea wrapped it in her pinafore and carried it downstairs . It was welcomed in a thrilling silence . At last Anthea said , “
6452	6453	6373	6374	a dear	441	” “
6459	6474	6373	6374	a dear	441	” asked the Psammead , shooting its eyes out and turning them slowly round . “
6483	6487	6373	6374	a dear	441	” said Robert . “
6495	6500	6489	6489	I	0	” said the Psammead . “
6504	6509	6373	6374	a dear	441	” said Anthea kindly ; “
6550	6561	6533	6533	I	0	” It looked keenly at her , and she blushed . “
6567	6572	6533	6533	I	0	” it said sharply . “
6598	6599	6600	6600	I	0	” “
6606	6610	6602	6602	you	0	” said Jane . “
6629	6630	6625	6625	she	133	” “
6636	6641	6631	6631	I	0	” said the Psammead , “
6703	6704	6707	6707	you	0	” “
6710	6719	6707	6707	you	0	” Anthea was beginning but it interrupted her . “
6727	6731	6733	6733	I	0	” it said ; “
6798	6799	6793	6793	I	0	” “
6803	6807	6800	6800	I	0	” said Cyril , “
6816	6817	6800	6800	I	0	” “
6820	6825	6800	6800	I	0	” said the Psammead , “
6898	6899	6892	6892	I	0	” “
6904	6908	6892	6892	I	0	” said Anthea . “
6944	6967	6942	6942	we	449	” The others all said yes — and fidgetted in their chairs . Robert spoke the wishes of all when he said — “
6976	6989	6971	6971	you	0	” So it sat up on the green‐covered table and went on . “
6996	7000	6991	6991	you	0	” it said , “
7038	7039	7052	7052	You	0	” “
7043	7047	7052	7052	You	0	” Jane repeated . “
7062	7075	7057	7057	I	0	” Jane yawned ; the mention of bed made her feel sleepy . “
7079	7088	7089	7089	I	0	” said the Psammead , in offended tones . “
7216	7217	7213	7213	your	457	” “
7229	7234	7213	7213	your	457	” said Cyril regretfully ; “
7277	7296	7297	7297	I	0	” Merely from habit , the Sand‐fairy began to blow itself out , but it stopped short suddenly . “
7300	7304	7297	7297	I	0	” it said ; “
7314	7315	7305	7305	I	0	” “
7322	7326	7329	7329	we	459	” said Cyril , “
7352	7353	7349	7349	she	305	” “
7357	7362	7349	7349	she	305	” said the Psammead . “
7388	7389	7396	7400	the man in the shop	464	” “
7402	7406	7396	7400	the man in the shop	464	” said Robert . “
7410	7415	7396	7400	the man in the shop	464	” said the creature , “
7449	7450	7452	7452	you	457	” “
7460	7464	7452	7452	you	457	” said Jane ; “
7511	7518	7509	7509	Mother	138	” And Jane began to cry . “
7523	7529	7530	7530	you	457	” said the Psammead hastily ; “
7561	7562	7552	7552	you	457	” “
7570	7571	7552	7552	you	457	” “
7578	7583	7552	7552	you	457	” said the creature ; “
7694	7722	7723	7723	I	0	” The children looked at each other and then at the Psammead . Then Cyril coughed awkwardly and took sudden courage to say what everyone was thinking . “
7732	7736	7726	7726	you	472	” he said ; “
7829	7830	7831	7831	I	0	” “
7852	7858	7834	7834	you	472	” said the Psammead crossly . “
7942	7943	7960	7960	You	472	” “
7949	7953	7960	7960	You	472	” said Anthea , “
8005	8010	7998	7998	I	0	” she went on , “
8050	8051	8052	8052	I	0	” “
8060	8065	8052	8052	I	0	” said the Psammead ; “
8081	8082	8078	8078	your	472	” “
8088	8096	8078	8078	your	472	” said everybody ; and Jane added , “
8120	8121	8115	8115	you	472	” “
8125	8130	8115	8115	you	472	” said the Psammead ; “
8139	8193	8134	8134	you	472	” So everybody got its hat . The Psammead was put into a flat bass‐bag that had come from Farringdon Market with two pounds of filleted plaice in it . Now it contained about three pounds and a quarter of solid Psammead , and the children took it in turns to carry it . “
8204	8240	8134	8134	you	472	” Robert said , and the girls sighed . The Psammead poked a wary eye out of the top of the basket every now and then , and told the children which turnings to take . “
8248	8252	8245	8245	you	472	” asked Robert . “
8262	8269	8253	8253	I	0	” And the Psammead said sharply , “
8279	8451	8272	8272	I	0	” At last they came to the shop . It had all sorts and kinds of things in the window — concertinas , and silk handkerchiefs , china vases and tea‐cups , blue Japanese jars , pipes , swords , pistols , lace collars , silver spoons tied up in half‐dozens , and wedding‐rings in a red lacquered basin . There were officers ’ epaulets and doctors ’ lancets . There were tea‐caddies inlaid with red turtle‐shell and brass curly‐wurlies , plates of different kinds of money , and stacks of different kinds of plates . There was a beautiful picture of a little girl washing a dog , which Jane liked very much . And in the middle of the window there was a dirty silver tray full of mother‐of‐pearl card counters , old seals , paste buckles , snuff‐boxes , and all sorts of little dingy odds and ends . The Psammead put its head quite out of the fish‐basket to look in the window , when Cyril said — “
8462	8507	8272	8272	I	0	” And then its long snail ’s eyes saw something that made them stretch out so much that they were as long and thin as new slate‐pencils . Its fur bristled thickly , and its voice was quite hoarse with excitement as it whispered — “
8541	8542	8538	8538	you	472	” “
8552	8556	8538	8538	you	472	” asked Cyril . “
8570	8571	8538	8538	you	472	” “
8578	8583	8538	8538	you	472	” said the Psammead . “
8628	8634	8621	8621	you	472	” it said to Anthea . “
8641	8776	8777	8777	I	0	” So the others flattened their noses against the shop window , and presently a large , dirty , short‐fingered hand with a very big diamond ring came stretching through the green half‐ curtains at the back of the shop window and took away the tray . They could not see what was happening in the interview between Anthea and the Diamond Ring , and it seemed to them that she had had time — if she had had money — to buy everything in the shop before the moment came when she stood before them , her face wreathed in grins , as Cyril said later , and in her hand the charm . It was something like this — and it was made of a red , smooth , softly shiny stone . “
8782	8799	8777	8777	I	0	” Anthea whispered , just opening her hand to give the others a glimpse of it . “
8820	8994	8806	8806	We	479	” So home they went . The parlour in Fitzroy Street was a very flat background to magic happenings . Down in the country among the flowers and green fields anything had seemed — and indeed had been — possible . But it was hard to believe that anything really wonderful could happen so near the Tottenham Court Road . But the Psammead was there — and it in itself was wonderful . And it could talk — and it had shown them where a charm could be bought that would make the owner of it perfectly happy . So the four children hurried home , taking very long steps , with their chins stuck out , and their mouths shut very tight indeed . They went so fast that the Psammead was quite shaken about in its fish‐bag , but it did not say anything — perhaps for fear of attracting public notice . They got home at last , very hot indeed , and set the Psammead on the green tablecloth . “
8998	9032	8806	8806	We	479	” said Cyril . But the Psammead had to have a plate of sand fetched for it , for it was quite faint . When it had refreshed itself a little it said — “
9042	9074	9037	9037	me	0	” and Anthea laid it on the green table‐cover . The Psammead shot out his long eyes to look at it , then it turned them reproachfully on Anthea and said — “
9084	9091	9037	9037	me	0	” This was indeed a blow . “
9098	9114	9037	9037	me	0	” said Anthea , with timid firmness . She knew it was not her fault . “
9121	9126	9037	9037	me	0	” said the Psammead , “
9138	9139	9037	9037	me	0	” “
9144	9150	9037	9037	me	0	good?”—“Won’t it work without the other bit?”—“It
9154	9160	9162	9164	silly little idiots	482	”—“Oh , bother , bother , bother!”—“Don’t
9166	9185	9162	9164	silly little idiots	482	” said everyone and the Psammead altogether . Then there was a wretched silence . Cyril broke it — “
9191	9192	9162	9164	silly little idiots	482	” “
9209	9214	9215	9215	I	0	” said the Psammead . “
9255	9353	9378	9379	the man	2282	” So Cyril went to the shop . And the Psammead to sand . And the other three went to dinner , which was now ready . And old Nurse was very cross that Cyril was not ready too . The three were watching at the windows when Cyril returned , and even before he was near enough for them to see his face there was something about the slouch of his shoulders and set of his knickerbockers and the way he dragged his boots along that showed but too plainly that his errand had been vain . “
9356	9369	9378	9379	the man	2282	” they all said , hoping against hope on the front‐door step . “
9373	9377	9378	9379	the man	2282	” Cyril answered ; “
9458	9522	9441	9441	He	2282	” It was plain that Cyril was not pleased . The unlikeliness of anything really interesting happening in that parlour lay like a weight of lead on everyone ’s spirits . Cyril had his dinner , and just as he was swallowing the last mouthful of apple‐pudding there was a scratch at the door . Anthea opened it and in walked the Psammead . “
9525	9536	9441	9441	He	2282	” it said , when it had heard the news , “
9570	9571	9561	9561	You	491	” “
9574	9580	9561	9561	You	491	” was the general reply . “
9588	9589	9582	9582	we	492	” “
9592	9597	9582	9582	we	492	” said the Psammead , “
9647	9762	9636	9636	I	0	” As the children settled themselves on the floor — it was far more comfortable than the chairs , as well as more polite to the Psammead , who was stroking its whiskers on the hearth‐rug — a sudden cold pain caught at Anthea ’s heart . Father — Mother — the darling Lamb — all far away . Then a warm , comfortable feeling flowed through her . The Psammead was here , and at least half a charm , and there were to be adventures . ( If you do n’t know what a cold pain is , I am glad for your sakes , and I hope you never may . ) “
9765	9771	9636	9636	I	0	” said the Psammead cheerily , “
9850	9851	9838	9838	I	0	” “
9860	9865	9838	9838	I	0	” said every one . “
9870	9875	9838	9838	I	0	” said the Psammead . “
9927	9934	9936	9937	their mothers	496	” it broke off to say , “
9962	9972	10005	10005	people	280	” ) Robert yawned . The Psammead went on . “
10026	10027	10016	10016	you	491	” “
10030	10039	10016	10016	you	491	” said the children , quite without enthusiasm . “
10049	10050	10016	10016	you	491	” “
10055	10059	10016	10016	you	491	” said Cyril . “
10063	10064	10065	10065	I	0	” “
10074	10084	10065	10065	I	0	” said Jane , but not with much interest . “
10095	10096	10065	10065	I	0	” “
10102	10106	10098	10098	you	500	” said Robert . “
10112	10118	10109	10109	I	0	” retorted the Psammead tartly , “
10128	10129	10125	10125	you	491	” “
10139	10143	10125	10125	you	491	” said Cyril . “
10148	10152	10125	10125	you	491	” Anthea ventured , “
10182	10192	10175	10175	its	502	” She appealed to the Psammead . It nodded . “
10195	10199	10175	10175	its	502	” it said ; “
10218	10228	10175	10175	its	502	” This seemed a brilliant prospect till Robert asked — “
10236	10245	10246	10246	I	0	” The Psammead shook its head and answered , “
10254	10255	10257	10257	you	0	” “
10259	10260	10257	10257	you	0	” “
10263	10264	10257	10257	you	0	” “
10267	10271	10257	10257	you	0	” said Robert , “
10300	10301	10296	10296	Father	137	” “
10306	10312	10313	10313	you	491	” said the Psammead briskly ; “
10336	10337	10296	10296	Father	137	” “
10341	10389	10296	10296	Father	137	” Jane questioned . Jane ’s question did not mean that she thought it could n’t , for in spite of the parlour furniture the feeling of magic was growing deeper and thicker , and seemed to fill the room like a dream of a scented fog . “
10401	10402	10397	10397	you	491	” “
10406	10416	10397	10397	you	491	” Every one was rather hurt at the question . “
10469	10485	10450	10450	you	491	” There was a silence . The red charm was passed from hand to hand . “
10493	10499	10450	10450	you	491	” said Cyril at last . “
10502	10507	10450	10450	you	491	” said the Psammead ; “
10512	10513	10450	10450	you	491	” “
10518	10522	10450	10450	you	491	” said Cyril , “
10539	10548	10549	10549	I	0	” This was what was on the charm — “
10556	10561	10549	10549	I	0	” said the Psammead ; “
10579	10580	10575	10576	A priest	504	” “
10588	10592	10593	10593	we	505	” said Anthea ; “
10631	10640	10628	10628	I	0	” The Psammead stamped a furry foot angrily . “
10649	10653	10643	10643	I	0	” it said ; “
10696	10697	10680	10694	no wise man in your Babylon who can pronounce the names of the Great Ones	509	” “
10706	10710	10680	10694	no wise man in your Babylon who can pronounce the names of the Great Ones	509	” said Anthea , “
10764	10765	10755	10755	He	512	” “
10769	10774	10755	10755	He	512	” said the Psammead , “
10851	10881	10840	10840	I	0	” So the four children hastily washed their hands and brushed their hair — this was Anthea ’s idea — and went up to knock at the door of the “
10886	10889	10840	10840	I	0	” and to “
10901	11058	10840	10840	I	0	” THE learned gentleman had let his dinner get quite cold . It was mutton chop , and as it lay on the plate it looked like a brown island in the middle of a frozen pond , because the grease of the gravy had become cold , and consequently white . It looked very nasty , and it was the first thing the children saw when , after knocking three times and receiving no reply , one of them ventured to turn the handle and softly to open the door . The chop was on the end of a long table that ran down one side of the room . The table had images on it and queer‐shaped stones , and books . And there were glass cases fixed against the wall behind , with little strange things in them . The cases were rather like the ones you see in jewellers ’ shops . The “
11062	11287	10840	10840	I	0	” was sitting at a table in the window , looking at something very small which he held in a pair of fine pincers . He had a round spy‐glass sort of thing in one eye — which reminded the children of watchmakers , and also of the long snail ’s eyes of the Psammead . The gentleman was very long and thin , and his long , thin boots stuck out under the other side of his table . He did not hear the door open , and the children stood hesitating . At last Robert gave the door a push , and they all started back , for in the middle of the wall that the door had hidden was a mummy‐case — very , very , very big — painted in red and yellow and green and black , and the face of it seemed to look at them quite angrily . You know what a mummy‐case is like , of course ? If you do n’t you had better go to the British Museum at once and find out . Anyway , it is not at all the sort of thing that you expect to meet in a top‐floor front in Bloomsbury , looking as though it would like to know what business you had there . So everyone said , “
11290	11316	10840	10840	I	0	” rather loud , and their boots clattered as they stumbled back . The learned gentleman took the glass out of his eye and said — “
11322	11343	11317	11317	I	0	” in a very soft , quiet pleasant voice — the voice of a gentleman who has been to Oxford . “
11351	11356	11346	11346	us	518	” said Cyril politely . “
11364	11365	11357	11357	We	518	” “
11369	11386	11387	11387	I	0	” said the gentleman , rising — with the most distinguished courtesy , Anthea told herself . “
11412	11431	11432	11432	He	0	” He cleared a chair , and stood smiling and looking kindly through his large , round spectacles . “
11438	11442	11444	11444	he	0	” whispered Robert , “
11457	11458	11444	11444	he	0	” “
11461	11465	11444	11444	he	0	” said Anthea , “
11481	11482	11473	11473	You	517	” “
11491	11496	11483	11483	We	518	” said Cyril politely , “
11575	11576	11568	11568	you	517	” “
11581	11586	11568	11568	you	517	” said the gentleman ; “
11591	11592	11593	11593	He	520	” “
11603	11694	11593	11593	He	520	” said Robert , as the gentleman cleared three more chairs . He put the things off them carefully on the floor . The first chair had things like bricks that tiny , tiny birds ’ feet have walked over when the bricks were soft , only the marks were in regular lines . The second chair had round things on it like very large , fat , long , pale beads . And the last chair had a pile of dusty papers on it . The children sat down . “
11704	11708	11697	11697	you	517	” said Cyril , “
11747	11748	11717	11717	we	518	” “
11768	11774	11717	11717	we	518	” said the gentleman politely . “
11777	11782	11717	11717	we	518	” said Cyril blushing , “
11804	11830	11796	11796	I	0	” The gentleman took off his spectacles and laughed . His laugh sounded rusty , Cyril thought , as though it was n’t often used . “
11834	11838	11796	11796	I	0	” he said . “
11917	11918	11910	11910	I	0	” “
11933	11939	11922	11922	we	525	” said the truthful Anthea . “
11955	11956	11946	11946	we	525	” “
11966	11970	11963	11963	I	0	” Robert interjected , “
11998	11999	11963	11963	I	0	” “
12009	12013	12014	12014	I	0	” said Anthea . “
12024	12033	12017	12017	I	0	” said the gentleman , with gentle nervousness . “
12041	12045	12046	12046	We	525	” said Cyril . “
12181	12202	12161	12161	you	517	” The gentleman had put on his spectacles again and was looking at Cyril through them . He now said : “
12206	12213	12161	12161	you	517	” more than once , adding , “
12220	12221	12222	12222	I	0	” “
12228	12232	12222	12222	I	0	” said Cyril . “
12243	12265	12239	12239	I	0	” Some faint memory of a far‐off childhood must have come to the learned gentleman just then , for he smiled . “
12269	12273	12239	12239	I	0	” he said . “
12310	12311	12302	12302	you	517	” “
12320	12328	12312	12312	We	525	” said Cyril ; and Anthea said , “
12334	12374	12312	12312	We	525	” and held it out . With politeness , but without interest , the gentleman took it . But after the first glance all his body suddenly stiffened , as a pointer ’s does when he sees a partridge . “
12378	12448	12312	12312	We	525	” he said in quite a changed voice , and carried the charm to the window . He looked at it ; he turned it over . He fixed his spy‐glass in his eye and looked again . No one said anything . Only Robert made a shuffling noise with his feet till Anthea nudged him to shut up . At last the learned gentleman drew a long breath . “
12455	12459	12451	12451	you	517	” he asked . “
12485	12489	12490	12490	We	525	” said Cyril . “
12496	12500	12490	12490	We	525	” added Jane . “
12537	12538	12533	12533	I	0	” “
12541	12545	12533	12533	I	0	” said Cyril , “
12559	12560	12553	12553	we	525	” “
12567	12573	12553	12553	we	525	” said the gentleman impressively ; “
12597	12598	12586	12586	I	0	” “
12602	12603	12604	12604	I	0	” “
12625	12626	12615	12615	you	517	” “
12630	12634	12635	12635	we	525	” said Cyril , “
12656	12657	12648	12648	We	525	” “
12672	12677	12660	12660	you	517	” said the gentleman ; “
12689	12690	12679	12679	I	0	” “
12696	12701	12691	12691	They	530	” said Anthea earnestly . “
12736	12737	12731	12731	you	517	” “
12745	12746	12740	12740	I	0	” “
12753	12754	12748	12748	you	517	” “
12758	12763	12748	12748	you	517	” said the gentleman , “
12769	12770	12765	12767	Ur Hekau Setcheh	152	” “
12775	12779	12771	12773	Ur Hekau Setcheh	152	” repeated Cyril . “
12797	12798	12783	12783	I	0	” “
12803	12808	12783	12783	I	0	” said the gentleman . “
12827	12830	12812	12812	me	0	” They said “
12833	12918	12919	12919	I	0	” in all the different polite ways they could think of , and filed out of the door and down the stairs . Anthea was last . Half‐way down to the first landing she turned and ran up again . The door was still open , and the learned gentleman and the mummy‐case were standing opposite to each other , and both looked as though they had stood like that for years . The gentleman started when Anthea put her hand on his arm . “
12934	12938	12921	12921	you	0	” she said , “
13022	13060	13062	13062	you	0	” She glanced at the mummy‐case ; it certainly did not look as though it would ever think of reminding people of their meals . The learned gentleman looked at her for a moment before he said — “
13087	13097	13078	13078	anyone	283	” He sighed , and looked at the chop . “
13103	13107	13078	13078	anyone	283	” said Anthea . “
13110	13114	13078	13078	anyone	283	” he said , “
13128	13704	13078	13078	anyone	283	” As he ate it he sighed more than once . Perhaps because the chop was nasty , perhaps because he longed for the charm which the children did not want to sell , perhaps because it was so long since anyone cared whether he ate his chops or forgot them . Anthea caught the others at the stair‐foot . They woke the Psammead , and it taught them exactly how to use the word of power , and to make the charm speak . I am not going to tell you how this is done , because you might try to do it . And for you any such trying would be almost sure to end in disappointment . Because in the first place it is a thousand million to one against your ever getting hold of the right sort of charm , and if you did , there would be hardly any chance at all of your finding a learned gentleman clever enough and kind enough to read the word for you . The children and the Psammead crouched in a circle on the floor — in the girls ’ bedroom , because in the parlour they might have been interrupted by old Nurse ’s coming in to lay the cloth for tea — and the charm was put in the middle of the circle . The sun shone splendidly outside , and the room was very light . Through the open window came the hum and rattle of London , and in the street below they could hear the voice of the milkman . When all was ready , the Psammead signed to Anthea to say the word . And she said it . Instantly the whole light of all the world seemed to go out . The room was dark . The world outside was dark — darker than the darkest night that ever was . And all the sounds went out too , so that there was a silence deeper than any silence you have ever even dreamed of imagining . It was like being suddenly deaf and blind , only darker and quieter even than that . But before the children had got over the sudden shock of it enough to be frightened , a faint , beautiful light began to show in the middle of the circle , and at the same moment a faint , beautiful voice began to speak . The light was too small for one to see anything by , and the voice was too small for you to hear what it said . You could just see the light and just hear the voice . But the light grew stronger . It was greeny , like glow‐worms ’ lamps , and it grew and grew till it was as though thousands and thousands of glow‐worms were signalling to their winged sweethearts from the middle of the circle . And the voice grew , not so much in loudness as in sweetness ( though it grew louder , too ) , till it was so sweet that you wanted to cry with pleasure just at the sound of it . It was like nightingales , and the sea , and the fiddle , and the voice of your mother when you have been a long time away , and she meets you at the door when you get home . And the voice said — “
13715	13918	13078	13078	anyone	283	” I can not tell you what language the voice used . I only know that everyone present understood it perfectly . If you come to think of it , there must be some language that everyone could understand , if we only knew what it was . Nor can I tell you how the charm spoke , nor whether it was the charm that spoke , or some presence in the charm . The children could not have told you either . Indeed , they could not look at the charm while it was speaking , because the light was too bright . They looked instead at the green radiance on the faded Kidderminster carpet at the edge of the circle . They all felt very quiet , and not inclined to ask questions or fidget with their feet . For this was not like the things that had happened in the country when the Psammead had given them their wishes . That had been funny somehow , and this was not . It was something like Arabian Nights magic , and something like being in church . No one cared to speak . It was Cyril who said at last — “
13933	13934	13078	13078	anyone	283	” “
13944	13950	13078	13078	anyone	283	” said the beautiful voice , “
13992	13993	13996	13996	I	0	” “
13999	14009	13996	13996	I	0	” murmured Robert , and a blank silence fell . “
14016	14022	13996	13996	I	0	” said Cyril at last ; “
14047	14048	13996	13996	I	0	” “
14055	14060	14050	14050	you	540	” said the voice , “
14074	14075	14076	14076	I	0	” “
14081	14085	14076	14076	I	0	” said Cyril . “
14094	14099	14089	14089	you	540	” said the voice . “
14107	14116	14100	14100	I	0	” said Cyril . The Psammead whispered crossly , “
14162	14163	14164	14164	I	0	” “
14167	14171	14164	14164	I	0	” said Cyril . “
14178	14183	14174	14174	you	540	” said the Psammead , “
14229	14230	14226	14226	you	540	” “
14238	14242	14234	14234	I	0	” said Anthea ; “
14251	14252	14246	14246	I	0	” “
14302	14303	14306	14306	we	542	” “
14314	14319	14306	14306	we	542	” asked Cyril obediently . “
14324	14329	14306	14306	we	542	” said the voice . “
14336	14337	14338	14338	I	0	” “
14369	14370	14363	14363	You	540	” “
14378	14380	14363	14363	You	540	” asked Anthea—“I
14391	14397	14363	14363	You	540	” The beautiful voice answered — “
14704	14830	14832	14832	you	565	” This is what the voice said . I think it must have meant Napoleon by the small man , the conqueror . Because I know I have been told that he took an army to Egypt , and that afterwards a lot of wise people went grubbing in the sand , and fished up all sorts of wonderful things , older than you would think possible . And of these I believe this charm to have been one , and the most wonderful one of all . Everyone listened : and everyone tried to think . It is not easy to do this clearly when you have been listening to the kind of talk I have told you about . At last Robert said — “
14873	14874	14832	14832	you	565	” “
14880	14884	14887	14887	you	565	” said Cyril . “
14916	14926	14927	14927	You	565	” He appealed to the Psammead , who said — “
14940	14941	14936	14936	you	565	” “
14944	14948	14950	14950	you	565	” said Anthea , “
14971	14972	14950	14950	you	565	” “
14975	14980	14950	14950	you	565	” said the voice . “
15048	15049	15031	15031	his	571	” “
15056	15060	15031	15031	his	571	” said Robert . “
15067	15074	15062	15062	you	565	” the beautiful voice went on , “
15108	15109	15062	15062	you	565	” “
15113	15119	15062	15062	you	565	” A bell rang loudly . “
15123	15127	15062	15062	you	565	” exclaimed Robert , “
15157	15158	15154	15154	your	565	” “
15170	15283	15168	15168	you	565	” added Anthea politely . The beautiful light faded slowly . The great darkness and silence came and these suddenly changed to the dazzlement of day and the great soft , rustling sound of London , that is like some vast beast turning over in its sleep . The children rubbed their eyes , the Psammead ran quickly to its sandy bath , and the others went down to tea . And until the cups were actually filled tea seemed less real than the beautiful voice and the greeny light . After tea Anthea persuaded the others to allow her to hang the charm round her neck with a piece of string . “
15294	15298	15305	15305	you	565	” she said : “
15332	15346	15399	15399	you	565	” NEXT morning Anthea got old Nurse to allow her to take up the “
15351	15374	15375	15375	You	565	” breakfast . He did not recognize her at first , but when he did he was vaguely pleased to see her . “
15386	15390	15377	15377	I	0	” she said ; “
15404	15405	15391	15391	I	0	” “
15410	15414	15416	15416	you	0	” said he ; “
15424	15425	15416	15416	you	0	” “
15440	15444	15416	15416	you	0	” said Anthea . “
15514	15530	15531	15531	I	0	” The learned gentleman rubbed his hair with both hands and looked anxiously at Anthea . “
15544	15548	15531	15531	I	0	” he said . “
15566	15567	15568	15568	I	0	” “
15574	15578	15568	15568	I	0	” she said . “
15637	15655	15657	15657	you	0	” The learned gentleman smiled feebly and then frowned — not a cross‐frown , but a puzzle‐frown . “
15659	15663	15657	15657	you	0	” he said , “
15686	15687	15688	15688	I	0	” “
15691	15695	15688	15688	I	0	” she said ; “
15708	15750	15698	15698	I	0	” He had not had many adventures with children in them , and he wondered whether all children were like these . He spent quite five minutes in wondering before he settled down to the fifty‐second chapter of his great book on “
15761	15865	15755	15759	the Priests of Amen Rā	576	” It is no use to pretend that the children did not feel a good deal of agitation at the thought of going through the charm into the Past . That idea , that perhaps they might stay in the Past and never get back again , was anything but pleasing . Yet no one would have dared to suggest that the charm should not be used ; and though each was in its heart very frightened indeed , they would all have joined in jeering at the cowardice of any one of them who should have uttered the timid but natural suggestion , “
15871	16018	16019	16019	You	577	” It seemed necessary to make arrangements for being out all day , for there was no reason to suppose that the sound of the dinner‐bell would be able to reach back into the Past , and it seemed unwise to excite old Nurse ’s curiosity when nothing they could say — not even the truth — could in any way satisfy it . They were all very proud to think how well they had understood what the charm and the Psammead had said about Time and Space and things like that , and they were perfectly certain that it would be quite impossible to make old Nurse understand a single word of it . So they merely asked her to let them take their dinner out into Regent ’s Park — and this , with the implied cold mutton and tomatoes , was readily granted . “
16033	16043	16030	16030	you	577	” said old Nurse , giving Cyril a shilling . “
16083	16280	16281	16281	We	578	” So Cyril took the shilling , and they all started off . They went round by the Tottenham Court Road to buy a piece of waterproof sheeting to put over the Psammead in case it should be raining in the Past when they got there . For it is almost certain death to a Psammead to get wet . The sun was shining very brightly , and even London looked pretty . Women were selling roses from big baskets‐full , and Anthea bought four roses , one each , for herself and the others . They were red roses and smelt of summer — the kind of roses you always want so desperately at about Christmas‐time when you can only get mistletoe , which is pale right through to its very scent , and holly which pricks your nose if you try to smell it . So now everyone had a rose in its buttonhole , and soon everyone was sitting on the grass in Regent ’s Park under trees whose leaves would have been clean , clear green in the country , but here were dusty and yellowish , and brown at the edges . “
16290	16294	16281	16281	We	578	” said Anthea , “
16333	16334	16331	16331	Pussy	155	” “
16345	16349	16337	16337	I	0	” said Jane . “
16359	16363	16350	16350	You	580	” said Anthea . “
16367	16378	16350	16350	You	580	” she added , remembering the beast ’s queer temper , “
16385	16395	16396	16396	I	0	” The Psammead , however , was unexpectedly amiable . “
16401	16405	16396	16396	I	0	” it said , “
16426	16600	16419	16419	I	0	” Jane with trembling hands took the Psammead and its fish‐basket under one arm . The charm ’s long string was hung round her neck . Then they all stood up . Jane held out the charm at arm ’s length , and Cyril solemnly pronounced the word of power . As he spoke it the charm grew tall and broad , and he saw that Jane was just holding on to the edge of a great red arch of very curious shape . The opening of the arch was small , but Cyril saw that he could go through it . All round and beyond the arch were the faded trees and trampled grass of Regent ’s Park , where the little ragged children were playing Ring o ’ Roses . But through the opening of it shone a blaze of blue and yellow and red . Cyril drew a long breath and stiffened his legs so that the others should not see that his knees were trembling and almost knocking together . “
16604	16880	16419	16419	I	0	” he said , and , stepping up through the arch , disappeared . Then followed Anthea . Robert , coming next , held fast , at Anthea ’s suggestion , to the sleeve of Jane , who was thus dragged safely through the arch . And as soon as they were on the other side of the arch there was no more arch at all and no more Regent ’s Park either , only the charm in Jane ’s hand , and it was its proper size again . They were now in a light so bright that they winked and blinked and rubbed their eyes . During this dazzling interval Anthea felt for the charm and pushed it inside Jane ’s frock , so that it might be quite safe . When their eyes got used to the new wonderful light the children looked around them . The sky was very , very blue , and it sparkled and glittered and dazzled like the sea at home when the sun shines on it . They were standing on a little clearing in a thick , low forest ; there were trees and shrubs and a close , thorny , tangly undergrowth . In front of them stretched a bank of strange black mud , then came the browny‐yellowy shining ribbon of a river . Then more dry , caked mud and more greeny‐browny jungle . The only things that told that human people had been there were the clearing , a path that led to it , and an odd arrangement of cut reeds in the river . They looked at each other . “
16883	16887	16419	16419	I	0	” said Robert , “
16895	16915	16419	16419	I	0	” It was . The air was hotter than they could have imagined , even in London in August . “
16924	16928	16916	16916	I	0	” said Cyril . “
16950	16951	16936	16936	I	0	” “
16957	16968	16936	16936	I	0	” said the Psammead , looking out of the fish‐bag . “
16974	16986	16987	16987	I	0	” said Robert , who had once taken a geography prize . “
16994	17030	16987	16987	I	0	” Cyril objected . His prize had been for natural history . The Psammead reached out a hairy arm from its basket and pointed to a heap of mud at the edge of the water . “
17037	17069	17033	17033	you	583	” it said ; and as it spoke the heap of mud slid into the river just as a slab of badly mixed mortar will slip from a bricklayer ’s trowel . “
17072	17091	17033	17033	you	583	” said everybody . There was a crashing among the reeds on the other side of the water . “
17098	17126	17033	17033	you	583	” said the Psammead , as a great beast like an enormous slaty‐blue slug showed itself against the black bank on the far side of the stream . “
17132	17136	16987	16987	I	0	” said Cyril ; “
17154	17155	17156	17156	I	0	” “
17171	17216	17156	17156	I	0	” said Jane . And now there was a crackling of reeds and twigs behind them . This was horrible . Of course it might be another hippopotamus , or a crocodile , or a lion — or , in fact , almost anything . “
17226	17231	17224	17224	Jane	134	” said Robert hastily . “
17260	17261	17262	17262	I	0	” “
17273	17275	17262	17262	I	0	” said Jane—“a
17282	17292	17262	17262	I	0	” They had all turned to face the danger . “
17300	17311	17262	17262	I	0	” said the Psammead in its friendly , informal way ; “
17323	17679	17320	17321	a human	589	” It was . It was a girl — of about Anthea ’s age . Her hair was short and fair , and though her skin was tanned by the sun , you could see that it would have been fair too if it had had a chance . She had every chance of being tanned , for she had no clothes to speak of , and the four English children , carefully dressed in frocks , hats , shoes , stockings , coats , collars , and all the rest of it , envied her more than any words of theirs or of mine could possibly say . There was no doubt that hers was the right costume for that climate . She carried a pot on her head , of red and black earthenware . She did not see the children , who shrank back against the edge of the jungle , and she went forward to the brink of the river to fill her pitcher . As she went she made a strange sort of droning , humming , melancholy noise all on two notes . Anthea could not help thinking that perhaps the girl thought this noise was singing . The girl filled the pitcher and set it down by the river brink . Then she waded into the water and stooped over the circle of cut reeds . She pulled half a dozen fine fish out of the water within the reeds , killing each as she took it out , and threading it on a long osier that she carried . Then she knotted the osier , hung it on her arm , picked up the pitcher , and turned to come back . And as she turned she saw the four children . The white dresses of Jane and Anthea stood out like snow against the dark forest background . She screamed and the pitcher fell , and the water was spilled out over the hard mud surface and over the fish , which had fallen too . Then the water slowly trickled away into the deep cracks . “
17685	17689	17690	17690	we	590	” Anthea cried , “
17696	17697	17690	17690	we	590	” “
17702	17907	17700	17700	you	591	” said the girl . Now , once for all , I am not going to be bothered to tell you how it was that the girl could understand Anthea and Anthea could understand the girl . You , at any rate , would not understand me , if I tried to explain it , any more than you can understand about time and space being only forms of thought . You may think what you like . Perhaps the children had found out the universal language which everyone can understand , and which wise men so far have not found . You will have noticed long ago that they were singularly lucky children , and they may have had this piece of luck as well as others . Or it may have been that ... but why pursue the question further ? The fact remains that in all their adventures the muddle‐headed inventions which we call foreign languages never bothered them in the least . They could always understand and be under‐ stood . If you can explain this , please do . I daresay I could understand your explanation , though you could never understand mine . So when the girl said , “
17912	17922	17923	17923	We	593	” everyone understood at once , and Anthea replied — “
17945	17967	17938	17938	you	592	” Jane put her face right into the Psammead ’s basket , and burrowed her mouth into its fur to whisper — “
17982	17989	17979	17979	they	595	” The Psammead shrugged its fur . “
18004	18010	17993	17993	your	592	” it said rather crossly . “
18031	18090	18023	18023	you	592	” it said . The strange girl was trembling with fright . Anthea had a bangle on her arm . It was a sevenpenny‐halfpenny trumpery brass thing that pretended to be silver ; it had a glass heart of turquoise blue hanging from it , and it was the gift of the maid‐of‐all‐work at the Fitzroy Street house . “
18093	18097	18023	18023	you	592	” said Anthea , “
18128	18156	18122	18122	you	592	” The girl held out her hand . Anthea slid the bangle over it , and the girl ’s face lighted up with the joy of possession . “
18159	18169	18122	18122	you	592	” she said , looking lovingly at the bangle ; “
18179	18206	18122	18122	you	592	” She picked up her fish and pitcher and led the way up the narrow path by which she had come , and the others followed . “
18212	18221	18122	18122	you	592	” said Cyril , trying to be brave . “
18224	18238	18122	18122	you	592	” said Robert , also assuming a boldness he was far from feeling , “
18263	18399	18427	18427	you	592	” The belt of thick , growing acacia trees and shrubs — mostly prickly and unpleasant‐looking — seemed about half a mile across . The path was narrow and the wood dark . At last , ahead , daylight shone through the boughs and leaves . The whole party suddenly came out of the wood ’s shadow into the glare of the sunlight that shone on a great stretch of yellow sand , dotted with heaps of grey rocks where spiky cactus plants showed gaudy crimson and pink flowers among their shabby , sand‐peppered leaves . Away to the right was something that looked like a grey‐brown hedge , and from beyond it blue smoke went up to the bluer sky . And over all the sun shone till you could hardly bear your clothes . “
18406	18412	18413	18413	I	0	” said the girl pointing . “
18418	18425	18413	18413	I	0	” whispered Jane into the basket , “
18434	18467	18427	18427	you	592	” The Psammead ought to have been touched by this proof of confidence . Perhaps , however , it looked upon it as a proof of doubt , for it merely snarled — “
18481	18482	18474	18474	I	0	” “
18485	18489	18490	18491	dear Jane	134	” whispered Anthea , “
18522	18523	18536	18537	the Psammead	136	” “
18526	18535	18536	18537	the Psammead	136	” said Cyril , in a low voice , “
18563	18599	18536	18537	the Psammead	136	” This Jane at last consented to do . As they got nearer to the browny fence they saw that it was a great hedge about eight feet high , made of piled‐up thorn bushes . “
18605	18609	18536	18537	the Psammead	136	” asked Cyril . “
18618	18623	18624	18624	I	0	” said the girl . “
18633	18637	18624	18624	I	0	” said he . “
18651	18840	18841	18841	They	598	” There was an opening in the hedge , and they followed the girl through it . A little way further on was another hedge , not so high , also of dry thorn bushes , very prickly and spiteful‐looking , and within this was a sort of village of huts . There were no gardens and no roads . Just huts built of wood and twigs and clay , and roofed with great palm‐leaves , dumped down anywhere . The doors of these houses were very low , like the doors of dog‐kennels . The ground between them was not paths or streets , but just yellow sand trampled very hard and smooth . In the middle of the village there was a hedge that enclosed what seemed to be a piece of ground about as big as their own garden in Camden Town . No sooner were the children well within the inner thorn hedge than dozens of men and women and children came crowding round from behind and inside the huts . The girl stood protectingly in front of the four children , and said — “
18867	18933	18855	18855	I	0	” She held out her arm with the Lowther Arcade bangle on it . The children from London , where nothing now surprises anyone , had never before seen so many people look so astonished . They crowded round the children , touching their clothes , their shoes , the buttons on the boys ’ jackets , and the coral of the girls ’ necklaces . “
18938	18942	18855	18855	I	0	” whispered Anthea . “
18946	18987	18988	18988	we	601	” said Cyril , with some dim remembrance of a dreadful day when he had had to wait in an outer office while his father interviewed a solicitor , and there had been nothing to read but the Daily Telegraph — “
19025	19030	19019	19019	we	601	” he added hastily . “
19077	19250	19019	19019	we	601	” Cyril ’s speech did n’t keep the crowd from pressing round and looking as eagerly as ever at the clothing of the children . Anthea had an idea that these people had never seen woven stuff before , and she saw how wonderful and strange it must seem to people who had never had any clothes but the skins of beasts . The sewing , too , of modern clothes seemed to astonish them very much . They must have been able to sew themselves , by the way , for men who seemed to be the chiefs wore knickerbockers of goat‐skin or deer‐skin , fastened round the waist with twisted strips of hide . And the women wore long skimpy skirts of animals ’ skins . The people were not very tall , their hair was fair , and men and women both had it short . Their eyes were blue , and that seemed odd in Egypt . Most of them were tattooed like sailors , only more roughly . “
19259	19290	19019	19019	we	601	” they kept asking touching the children ’s clothes curiously . Anthea hastily took off Jane ’s frilly lace collar and handed it to the woman who seemed most friendly . “
19294	19298	19019	19019	we	601	” she said , “
19316	19531	19532	19532	I	0	” She spoke in the tone of authority which she had always found successful when she had not time to coax her baby brother to do as he was told . The tone was just as successful now . The children were left together and the crowd retreated . It paused a dozen yards away to look at the lace collar and to go on talking as hard as it could . The children will never know what those people said , though they knew well enough that they , the four strangers , were the subject of the talk . They tried to comfort themselves by remembering the girl ’s promise of friendliness , but of course the thought of the charm was more comfortable than anything else . They sat down on the sand in the shadow of the hedged‐round place in the middle of the village , and now for the first time they were able to look about them and to see something more than a crowd of eager , curious faces . They here noticed that the women wore necklaces made of beads of different coloured stone , and from these hung pendants of odd , strange shapes , and some of them had bracelets of ivory and flint . “
19535	19539	19532	19532	I	0	” said Robert , “
19552	19553	19556	19556	they	610	” “
19563	19567	19556	19556	they	610	” said Cyril . “
19650	19674	19619	19620	the girl	2486	” Anthea beckoned to the girl , who was standing a little way off looking wistfully at them , and she came gladly . “
19687	19691	19619	19620	the girl	2486	” said Cyril . “
19696	19701	19619	19620	the girl	2486	” said the girl ; “
19717	19718	19741	19741	you	0	” “
19726	19727	19721	19721	you	0	” “
19730	19735	19721	19721	you	0	” said the girl , “
19744	19755	19741	19741	you	0	” It was the first word she had not understood . “
19763	19767	19741	19741	you	0	” asked Cyril . “
19771	20186	19741	19741	you	0	” said the girl , opening her eyes wide . I wish I had time to tell you of that talk . The English children wanted to hear all about this new place , but they also wanted to tell of their own country . It was like when you come back from your holidays and you want to hear and to tell everything at the same time . As the talk went on there were more and more words that the girl could not understand , and the children soon gave up the attempt to explain to her what their own country was like , when they began to see how very few of the things they had always thought they could not do without were really at all necessary to life . The girl showed them how the huts were made — indeed , as one was being made that very day she took them to look at it . The way of building was very different from ours . The men stuck long pieces of wood into a piece of ground the size of the hut they wanted to make . These were about eight inches apart ; then they put in another row about eight inches away from the first , and then a third row still further out . Then all the space between was filled up with small branches and twigs , and then daubed over with black mud worked with the feet till it was soft and sticky like putty . The girl told them how the men went hunting with flint spears and arrows , and how they made boats with reeds and clay . Then she explained the reed thing in the river that she had taken the fish out of . It was a fish‐trap — just a ring of reeds set up in the water with only one little opening in it , and in this opening , just below the water , were stuck reeds slanting the way of the river ’s flow , so that the fish , when they had swum sillily in , sillily could n’t get out again . She showed them the clay pots and jars and platters , some of them ornamented with black and red patterns , and the most wonderful things made of flint and different sorts of stone , beads , and ornaments , and tools and weapons of all sorts and kinds . “
20192	20197	20199	20199	you	618	” said Cyril patronizingly , “
20210	20211	20199	20199	you	618	” “
20218	20223	20212	20212	I	0	” said the girl . “
20232	20236	20212	20212	I	0	” whispered Jane . “
20278	20279	20267	20267	You	618	” “
20289	20305	20267	20267	You	618	” asked Anthea , struck by a sudden thought , and pointing to the fence . “
20313	20321	20322	20323	No one	344	” said the girl in a whisper . “
20353	20354	20350	20351	the headsmen	623	” “
20360	20370	20357	20357	you	618	” said Cyril , looking at her very hard . “
20382	20396	20371	20371	I	0	” said Anthea taking off a bead‐ring which had already been much admired . “
20399	20410	20371	20371	I	0	” said the girl , catching eagerly at the ring . “
20487	20488	20490	20490	you	618	” “
20494	20502	20490	20490	you	618	” asked Anthea . The girl nodded . “
20509	20528	20490	20490	you	618	” asked Jane , rashly producing the charm . The girl ’s face turned a sickly greenish white . “
20535	20539	20540	20540	You	618	” she whispered . “
20585	20586	20580	20580	you	618	” “
20592	20596	20597	20597	they	623	” said Cyril . “
20632	20666	20630	20630	me	0	” He turned to the girl , but before he had time to speak the question there was a loud shout , and a man bounded in through the opening in the thorn‐hedge . “
20673	20677	20667	20668	Many foes	628	” he cried . “
20683	20699	20667	20668	Many foes	628	” His breath only served for that , and he lay panting on the ground . “
20708	20712	20667	20668	Many foes	628	” said Jane . “
20724	20755	20756	20756	You	134	” She held up the charm . Fortunately all the strange , fair people were too busy to notice her . She held up the charm . And nothing happened . “
20765	20779	20756	20756	You	134	” said Anthea . Jane hastily said it — and still nothing happened . “
20790	20794	20787	20787	you	134	” said Robert . “
20800	20841	20787	20787	you	134	” said Jane , dancing about in her agony of terror . Nobody knew . So they opened the fish‐bag to ask the Psammead . And the bag had only a waterproof sheet in it . The Psammead was gone . “
20853	20877	20787	20787	you	134	” whispered the girl . Cyril shrugged his shoulders , and tried to look as brave as he knew he ought to feel . “
20884	20888	20882	20882	Pussy	155	” he said . “
20907	21243	20787	20787	you	134	” HERE was a horrible position ! Four English children , whose proper date was A.D. 1905 , and whose proper address was London , set down in Egypt in the year 6000 B.C. , with no means whatever of getting back into their own time and place . They could not find the East , and the sun was of no use at the moment , because some officious person had once explained to Cyril that the sun did not really set in the West at all — nor rise in the East either , for the matter of that . The Psammead had crept out of the bass‐bag when they were not looking and had basely deserted them . An enemy was approaching . There would be a fight . People get killed in fights , and the idea of taking part in a fight was one that did not smile to the children . The man who had brought the news of the enemy still lay panting on the sand . His tongue was hanging out , long and red , like a dog ’s . The people of the village were hur‐ riedly filling the gaps in the fence with thorn‐bushes from the heap that seemed to have been piled there ready for just such a need . They lifted the clustering thorns with long poles — much as men at home , nowadays , lift hay with a fork . Jane bit her lip and tried to decide not to cry . Robert felt in his pocket for a toy pistol and loaded it with a pink paper cap . It was his only weapon . Cyril tightened his belt two holes . And Anthea absently took the drooping red roses from the buttonholes of the others , bit the ends of the stalks , and set them in a pot of water that stood in the shadow by a hut door . She was always rather silly about flowers . “
21247	21251	20787	20787	you	134	” she said . “
21288	21302	21281	21281	I	0	” Jane succeeded in deciding not to cry — at any rate yet . “
21309	21313	21281	21281	I	0	” Robert asked . “
21316	21321	21281	21281	I	0	” Cyril answered promptly , “
21352	21398	21399	21399	I	0	” The runner had risen to his knees and was sitting back on his heels . Now he stood up and spoke . He began by some respectful remarks addressed to the heads of the village . His speech got more interesting when he said — “
21616	21617	21603	21603	I	0	” “
21623	21635	21620	21620	your	646	” said the headman , turning suddenly and angrily on Cyril , “
21643	21644	21636	21636	you	646	” “
21649	21654	21636	21636	you	646	” said Cyril indignantly . “
21679	21685	21676	21676	they	2543	” he asked the runner . “
21688	21693	21676	21676	they	2543	” was the answer . “
21731	21739	21709	21711	these strange children	652	” A murmur ran through the crowd . “
21744	21749	21709	21711	these strange children	652	” said Cyril again . “
21766	21799	21756	21756	We	639	” The headman seemed impressed by the fact that Cyril knew that there were sacred things to be guarded . He stood a moment gazing at the children . Then he said — “
21819	21948	21949	21949	They	656	” The crowd dispersed , and nine men , wearing antelope‐skins , grouped themselves in front of the opening in the hedge in the middle of the village . And presently , one by one , the men brought all sorts of things — hippopotamus flesh , ostrich‐feathers , the fruit of the date palms , red chalk , green chalk , fish from the river , and ibex from the mountains ; and the headman received these gifts . There was another hedge inside the first , about a yard from it , so that there was a lane inside between the hedges . And every now and then one of the headmen would disappear along this lane with full hands and come back with hands empty . “
21957	21961	21949	21949	They	656	” said Anthea . “
21969	22062	21949	21949	They	656	” The pockets of the party , hastily explored , yielded a piece of pink tape , a bit of sealing‐ wax , and part of the Waterbury watch that Robert had not been able to help taking to pieces at Christmas and had never had time to rearrange . Most boys have a watch in this condition . They presented their offerings , and Anthea added the red roses . The headman who took the things looked at them with awe , especially at the red roses and the Waterbury‐watch fragment . “
22072	22076	22077	22077	I	0	” he said . “
22112	22117	22088	22089	Our maiden	657	” The children shuddered . “
22127	22128	22122	22122	you	0	” “
22140	22144	22133	22133	I	0	” Robert said . “
22159	22167	22155	22155	You	0	” He held out the toy pistol . “
22204	22205	22183	22183	I	0	” “
22228	22234	22223	22223	I	0	” asked the man cautiously . “
22245	22249	22240	22240	you	0	” said Robert . “
22254	22263	22240	22240	you	0	” He looked at the pistol and said — “
22272	22277	22279	22279	thy	0	within”—he pointed to the hedged‐in space—“speak
22288	22346	22347	22348	The voice	2425	” He pulled the trigger , and the cap went off . The noise was loud , for it was a two‐shilling pistol , and the caps were excellent . Every man , woman , and child in the village fell on its face on the sand . The headman who had accepted the test rose first . “
22352	22356	22347	22348	The voice	2425	” he said . “
22367	22431	22347	22348	The voice	2425	” So now the four children were led in through the opening of the hedge and round the lane till they came to an opening in the inner hedge , and they went through an opening in that , and so passed into another lane . The thing was built something like this , and all the hedges were of brushwood and thorns : “
22441	22477	22347	22348	The voice	2425	” whispered Anthea . The lanes were all open to the sky , but the little hut in the middle of the maze was round‐roofed , and a curtain of skins hung over the doorway . “
22483	22488	22479	22479	you	663	” said their guide , “
22498	22506	22347	22348	The voice	2425	” He himself passed it and disappeared . “
22511	22515	22347	22348	The voice	2425	” whispered Cyril , “
22531	22532	22347	22348	The voice	2425	” “
22547	22551	22347	22348	The voice	2425	” said Anthea . “
22643	22958	22959	22960	My father	624	” They went out and told the headman that they would protect the treasure when the fighting began . And now they looked about them and were able to see exactly how a first‐class worker in flint flakes and notches an arrow‐head or the edge of an axe — an advantage which no other person now alive has ever enjoyed . The boys found the weapons most interesting . The arrow‐heads were not on arrows such as you shoot from a bow , but on javelins , for throwing from the hand . The chief weapon was a stone fastened to a rather short stick something like the things gentlemen used to carry about and call life‐preservers in the days of the garrotters . Then there were long things like spears or lances , with flint heads to them , and there were flint knives — horribly sharp — and flint battle‐axes . Everyone in the village was so busy that the place was like an ant‐heap when you have walked into it by accident . The women were busy and even the children . Quite suddenly all the air seemed to glow and grow red — it was like the sudden opening of a furnace door , such as you may see at Woolwich Arsenal if you ever have the luck to be taken there — and then almost as suddenly it was as though the furnace doors had been shut . For the sun had set , and it was night . The sun had that abrupt way of setting in Egypt eight thousand years ago , and I believe it has never been able to break itself of the habit , and sets in exactly the same manner to the present day . The girl brought the skins of wild deer and led the children to a heap of dry sedge . “
22970	23071	23072	23072	I	0	” she said , and it really seemed a good idea . You may think that in the midst of all these dangers the children would not have been able to sleep — but somehow , though they were rather frightened now and then , the feeling was growing in them — deep down and almost hidden away , but still growing — that the Psammead was to be trusted , and that they were really and truly safe . This did not prevent their being quite as much frightened as they could bear to be without being perfectly miserable . “
23081	23085	23072	23072	I	0	” said Robert . “
23144	23149	23212	23214	the strange men	682	” he added soothingly . “
23153	23206	23212	23214	the strange men	682	” And they all fell asleep . They were awakened by long , loud , terrible sounds that seemed to come from everywhere at once — horrible threatening shouts and shrieks and howls that sounded , as Cyril said later , like the voices of men thirsting for their enemies ’ blood . “
23216	23229	23212	23214	the strange men	682	” said the girl , coming to them trembling through the dark . “
23274	23586	23256	23256	they	682	” she said indignantly . All night the terrible noise went on , but when the sun rose , as abruptly as he had set , the sound suddenly ceased . The children had hardly time to be glad of this before a shower of javelins came hurtling over the great thorn‐hedge , and everyone sheltered behind the huts . But next moment another shower of weapons came from the opposite side , and the crowd rushed to other shelter . Cyril pulled out a javelin that had stuck in the roof of the hut beside him . Its head was of brightly burnished copper . Then the sound of shouting arose again and the crackle of dried thorns . The enemy was breaking down the hedge . All the villagers swarmed to the point whence the crackling and the shouting came ; they hurled stones over the hedges , and short arrows with flint heads . The children had never before seen men with the fighting light in their eyes . It was very strange and terrible , and gave you a queer thick feeling in your throat ; it was quite different from the pictures of fights in the illustrated papers at home . It seemed that the shower of stones had driven back the besiegers . The besieged drew breath , but at that moment the shouting and the crackling arose on the opposite side of the village and the crowd hastened to defend that point , and so the fight swayed to and fro across the village , for the besieged had not the sense to divide their forces as their enemies had done . Cyril noticed that every now and then certain of the fighting‐men would enter the maze , and come out with brighter faces , a braver aspect , and a more upright carriage . “
23596	23600	23589	23589	they	686	” he said . “
23612	23709	23603	23604	the Psammead	136	” They crept through the maze , and watching they saw that Cyril was right . A headman was standing in front of the skin curtain , and as the warriors came before him he murmured a word they could not hear , and touched their foreheads with something that they could not see . And this something he held in his hands . And through his fingers they saw the gleam of a red stone that they knew . The fight raged across the thorn‐hedge outside . Suddenly there was a loud and bitter cry . “
23723	23732	23733	23733	He	690	” The headman disappeared behind the deer‐skin curtain . “
23740	23744	23733	23733	He	690	” said Anthea . “
23756	23790	23752	23752	you	136	” Suddenly there was a shriek from inside the hut , and the headman staggered out white with fear and fled out through the maze . The children were as white as he . “
23801	23805	23808	23808	Psammead	136	” moaned Anthea . “
23818	23854	23816	23816	you	136	” And the sound of the fight sank breathlessly , and swelled fiercely all around . It was like the rising and falling of the waves of the sea . Anthea shuddered and said again , “
23861	23862	23816	23816	you	136	” “
23865	23921	23816	23816	you	136	” said a brisk voice , and the curtain of skins was lifted at one corner by a furry hand , and out peeped the bat ’s ears and snail ’s eyes of the Psammead . Anthea caught it in her arms and a sigh of desperate relief was breathed by each of the four . “
23929	23949	23816	23816	you	136	” Anthea said , and she spoke hurriedly , for the noise of wild fighting drew nearer and nearer . “
23955	23960	23816	23816	you	136	” said the Psammead , “
23964	23974	23816	23816	you	136	” The inside of the hut was pitch dark . “
23981	24001	23975	23975	I	0	” said Cyril , and struck it . The floor of the hut was of soft , loose sand . “
24008	24013	23816	23816	you	136	” said the Psammead ; “
24086	24151	24075	24075	you	692	” The hut was hung with skins . Heaped in the middle were the offerings that had been given the night before , Anthea ’s roses fading on the top of the heap . At one side of the hut stood a large square stone block , and on it an oblong box of earthenware with strange figures of men and beasts on it . “
24158	24172	24075	24075	you	692	” asked Cyril , as the Psammead pointed a skinny finger at it . “
24179	24184	24173	24173	You	692	” said the Psammead . “
24207	24208	24198	24198	I	0	” “
24215	24219	24213	24213	Robert	132	” said Anthea . “
24230	24231	24213	24213	Robert	132	” “
24242	24243	24213	24213	Robert	132	” “
24249	24250	24245	24245	someone	331	” “
24259	24277	24253	24253	they	331	” said the Psammead impatiently , getting into its bass‐bag and wrapping itself in its waterproof sheet . “
24295	24299	24279	24279	we	697	” said Jane . “
24306	24311	24301	24301	you	692	” the Psammead said . “
24327	24392	24279	24279	we	697	” It pointed to the great stone . And still the shouting and the clash of stone on metal sounded nearer and nearer . The children could hear that the headmen had surrounded the hut to protect their treasure as long as might be from the enemy . But none dared to come in after the Psammead ’s sudden fierce biting of the headman . “
24397	24404	24395	24395	Jane	134	” said Cyril , very quickly . “
24434	24549	24423	24423	you	692	” He made a step forward , but at that instant a great crackling overhead ended in a blaze of sunlight . The roof had been broken in at one side , and great slabs of it were being lifted off by two spears . As the children trembled and winked in the new light , large dark hands tore down the wall , and a dark face , with a blobby fat nose , looked over the gap . Even at that awful moment Anthea had time to think that it was very like the face of Mr Jacob Absalom , who had sold them the charm in the shop near Charing Cross . “
24555	24563	24631	24631	Jane	134	” cried a harsh , strange voice ; “
24589	24628	24629	24629	Jane	134	” He glared fiercely at the children , and the whites of his eyes were very white indeed . He had a wet , red copper knife in his teeth . There was not a moment to lose . “
24635	24716	24720	24720	Jane	134	” cried every one passionately . Jane with trembling hands held up the charm towards the East , and Cyril spoke the word of power . The Amulet grew to a great arch . Out beyond it was the glaring Egyptian sky , the broken wall , the cruel , dark , big‐nosed face with the red , wet knife in its gleaming teeth . Within the arch was the dull , faint , greeny‐brown of London grass and trees . “
24722	24850	24720	24720	Jane	134	” Cyril cried , and he dashed through the arch , dragging Anthea and the Psammead after him . Robert followed , clutching Jane . And in the ears of each , as they passed through the arch of the charm , the sound and fury of battle died out suddenly and utterly , and they heard only the low , dull , discontented hum of vast London , and the peeking and patting of the sparrows on the gravel and the voices of the ragged baby children playing Ring‐o’‐Roses on the yellow trampled grass . And the charm was a little charm again in Jane ’s hand , and there was the basket with their dinner and the bath‐buns lying just where they had left it . “
24854	24863	24720	24720	Jane	134	” said Cyril , drawing a long breath ; “
24871	24872	24720	24720	Jane	134	” “
24881	24903	24720	24720	Jane	134	” said the Psammead . They all lay still , breathing in the safe , quiet air of Regent ’s Park . “
24912	24917	24904	24904	We	703	” said Anthea presently . “
24947	24948	24940	24940	We	703	” “
24956	24963	24964	24964	I	0	” said Cyril , feeling one ; “
24972	25002	25007	25007	I	0	” They were not hungry , curiously enough . They picked up the dinner‐basket and the Psammead‐basket , and went straight home . Old Nurse met them with amazement . “
25010	25014	25007	25007	I	0	” she said . “
25028	25069	25020	25020	You	706	” The children took this to be bitter irony , which means saying the exact opposite of what you mean in order to make yourself disagreeable ; as when you happen to have a dirty face , and someone says , “
25077	25078	25079	25079	We	703	” “
25084	25093	25079	25079	We	703	” began Anthea , but old Nurse said — “
25130	25196	25122	25122	I	0	” When she had gone to attend to the potatoes the children looked at each other . Could it be that old Nurse had so changed that she no longer cared that they should have been away from home for twenty‐four hours — all night in fact — without any explanation whatever ? But the Psammead put its head out of its basket and said — “
25228	25229	25204	25204	you	707	” “
25235	25239	25204	25204	you	707	” asked Jane . “
25280	25281	25204	25204	you	707	” “
25292	25293	25204	25204	you	707	” “
25303	25308	25204	25204	you	707	” said the Psammead . “
25319	25386	25204	25204	you	707	” That evening Anthea carried up a steak for the learned gentleman ’s dinner . She persuaded Beatrice , the maid‐of‐all‐work , who had given her the bangle with the blue stone , to let her do it . And she stayed and talked to him , by special invitation , while he ate the dinner . She told him the whole adventure , beginning with — “
25400	25406	25391	25391	ourselves	708	” and ending up with , “
25435	25470	25471	25471	You	710	” She did not tell anything about the charm or the Psammead , because that was forbidden , but the story was quite wonderful enough even as it was to entrance the learned gentleman . “
25479	25483	25473	25477	a most unusual little girl	711	” he said . “
25491	25492	25493	25494	No one	344	” “
25496	25500	25473	25477	a most unusual little girl	711	” said Anthea , “
25505	25506	25473	25477	a most unusual little girl	711	” “
25509	25542	25543	25543	I	0	” he said slowly , as one who recalls and pronounces a long‐forgotten word . He sat long after she had left him . At last he roused himself with a start . “
25550	25554	25543	25543	I	0	” he said ; “
25618	25857	25610	25610	I	0	” He finished his bread conscientiously , and actually went for a mile walk before he went back to his work . JANE was singing to her doll , rocking it to and fro in the house which she had made for herself and it . The roof of the house was the dining‐table , and the walls were tablecloths and antimacassars hanging all round , and kept in their places by books laid on their top ends at the table edge . The others were tasting the fearful joys of domestic toboganning . You know how it is done — with the largest and best tea‐tray and the surface of the stair carpet . It is best to do it on the days when the stair rods are being cleaned , and the carpet is only held by the nails at the top . Of course , it is one of the five or six thoroughly tip‐top games that grown‐up people are so unjust to — and old Nurse , though a brick in many respects , was quite enough of a standard grown‐up to put her foot down on the toboganning long before any of the performers had had half enough of it . The tea‐ tray was taken away , and the baffled party entered the sitting‐room , in exactly the mood not to be pleased if they could help it . So Cyril said , “
25863	25868	25610	25610	I	0	” And Robert added , “
25875	25892	25873	25873	Jane	134	” Even Anthea , who was almost always kind , advised Jane to try another song . “
25901	26091	26092	26092	I	0	” said she . It was a wet day , so none of the plans for seeing all the sights of London that can be seen for nothing , could be carried out . Everyone had been thinking all the morning about the wonderful adventures of the day before , when Jane had held up the charm and it had turned into an arch , through which they had walked straight out of the present time and the Regent ’s Park into the land of Egypt eight thousand years ago . The memory of yesterday ’s happenings was still extremely fresh and frightening , so that everyone hoped that no one would suggest another excursion into the past , for it seemed to all that yesterday ’s adventures were quite enough to last for at least a week . Yet each felt a little anxious that the others should not think it was afraid , and presently Cyril , who really was not a coward , began to see that it would not be at all nice if he should have to think himself one . So he said — “
26113	26114	26104	26104	We	715	” “
26122	26156	26104	26104	We	715	” said Robert . Jane obediently wriggled to the front of her house and sat there . She felt for the charm , to make sure that it was still round her neck . “
26162	26187	26188	26188	We	715	” said Cyril , saying much more than he meant because he thought Robert ’s tone had been rude — as indeed it had . “
26221	26222	26223	26223	I	0	” “
26232	26247	26223	26223	I	0	” said Robert ; but he added , with a fine air of chivalry , “
26260	26261	26253	26254	the girls	311	” “
26269	26274	26266	26266	I	0	” said Anthea hurriedly . “
26286	26287	26288	26288	I	0	” “
26292	26297	26288	26288	I	0	” said Jane heavily ; “
26319	26320	26315	26315	I	0	” “
26330	26334	26315	26315	I	0	” said Cyril ; “
26342	26343	26344	26344	I	0	” “
26360	26383	26344	26344	I	0	” Seeing Jane so frightened , made the others feel quite brave . They said they were certain they ought to go . “
26394	26410	26411	26411	I	0	” Anthea added , a little primly . Jane stood up . She was desperate . “
26415	26419	26411	26411	I	0	” she cried ; “
26470	26500	26501	26502	No one	344	” You can imagine how furious everyone was with Jane for feeling what each of them had felt all the morning . In each breast the same thought arose , “
26510	26538	26501	26502	No one	344	” And they at once began to show Jane how angry they all felt that all the fault was hers . This made them feel quite brave . “
26561	26565	26549	26554	all the dogs in our town	727	” sang Robert . “
26578	26599	26549	26554	all the dogs in our town	727	” Cyril spoke in a cold displeasure that was worse than Robert ’s cruel quotation , and even Anthea said , “
26612	26644	26609	26610	a girl	2478	” which of course , was the most cutting thing of all . Jane picked up her doll and faced the others with what is sometimes called the courage of despair . “
26650	26654	26645	26645	I	0	” she said ; “
26711	26814	26706	26706	I	0	” With these awful words she went out and banged the door . Then the others would not look at each other , and they did not feel so brave as they had done . Cyril took up a book , but it was not interesting to read . Robert kicked a chair‐leg absently . His feet were always eloquent in moments of emotion . Anthea stood pleating the end of the table‐cloth into folds — she seemed earnestly anxious to get all the pleats the same size . The sound of Jane ’s sobs had died away . Suddenly Anthea said , “
26832	26833	26834	26834	She	733	” “
26839	26848	26834	26834	She	733	” said Robert , kicking the chair suddenly . “
26863	26875	26852	26852	Cyril	131	“ we began , you know . At least you did . ”
26883	26898	26900	26900	Robert	132	“ I ’m not going to say I ’m sorry if you mean that , ”
26916	26923	26925	26925	Anthea	133	“ Oh , do let ’s , ”
26927	26964	26925	26925	Anthea	133	“ we ’re three to one , and Mother does so hate it if we row . Come on . I ’ll say I ’m sorry first , though I did n’t say anything , hardly . ”
26965	26975	26977	26977	Cyril	131	“ All right , let ’s get it over , ”
26983	26989	26977	26977	Cyril	131	“Hi — you — Pussy ! ”
27076	27094	27062	27062	her	134	“ I say , Pussy , let it be pax ! We ’re sorry if you are — ”
27127	27140	27141	27141	she	133	“ I ’m sorry if I was a pig , Pussy dear , ”
27142	27231	27124	27124	her	133	said—“especially because in my really and truly inside mind I ’ve been feeling a little as if I ’d rather not go into the Past again either . But then , do think . If we do n’t go we sha n’t get the Amulet , and oh , Pussy , think if we could only get Father and Mother and The Lamb safe back ! We must go , but we ’ll wait a day or two if you like and then perhaps you ’ll feel braver . ”
27232	27244	27246	27246	Robert	132	“ Raw meat makes you brave , however cowardly you are , ”
27257	27304	27124	27124	her	133	“ and cranberries — that ’s what Tartars eat , and they ’re so brave it ’s simply awful . I suppose cranberries are only for Christmas time , but I ’ll ask old Nurse to let you have your chop very raw if you like . ”
27305	27315	27317	27317	Jane	134	“ I think I could be brave without that , ”
27325	27330	27317	27317	Jane	134	“ I ’ll try . ”
27349	27353	27354	27354	he	2353	“ Excuse me , ”
27367	27393	27354	27354	he	2353	“ but was I mistaken in thinking that I caught a familiar word just now ? Were you not singing some old ballad of Babylon ? ”
27394	27397	27399	27399	Robert	132	“ No , ”
27401	27427	27399	27399	Robert	132	“ at least Jane was singing ‘ How many miles , ’ but I should n’t have thought you could have heard the words for — ”
27433	27438	27428	27428	He	2353	“ for the sniffing , ”
27447	27456	27458	27460	the learned gentleman	2353	“ I did not hear all the words , ”
27462	27472	27458	27460	the learned gentleman	2353	“ I wonder would you recite them to me ? ”
27479	27485	27486	27488	the learned gentleman	2353	“ I wish one could , ”
27494	27499	27501	27501	Jane	134	“ Ca n’t you ? ”
27503	27508	27509	27509	he	2353	“ Babylon has fallen , ”
27515	27561	27509	27509	he	2353	“ You know it was once a great and beautiful city , and the centre of learning and Art , and now it is only ruins , and so covered up with earth that people are not even agreed as to where it once stood . ”
27595	27599	27600	27600	Cyril	131	“ I say , ”
27604	27627	27600	27600	Cyril	131	“ You know that charm we showed you , and you told us how to say the name that ’s on it ? ”
27628	27631	27570	27570	his	2353	“ Yes ! ”
27632	27645	27600	27600	Cyril	131	“ Well , do you think that charm was ever in Babylon ? ”
27646	27652	27653	27655	the learned gentleman	2353	“ It ’s quite possible , ”
27658	27766	27653	27655	the learned gentleman	2353	“ such charms have been found in very early Egyptian tombs , yet their origin has not been accurately determined as Egyptian . They may have been brought from Asia . Or , supposing the charm to have been fashioned in Egypt , it might very well have been carried to Babylon by some friendly embassy , or brought back by the Babylonish army from some Egyptian campaign as part of the spoils of war . The inscription may be much later than the charm . Oh yes ! it is a pleasant fancy , that that splendid specimen of yours was once used amid Babylonish surroundings . ”
27781	27797	27777	27777	Jane	134	“ Were the Babylon people savages , were they always fighting and throwing things about ? ”
27816	27827	27829	27831	the learned gentleman	2353	“ The Babylonians were certainly more gentle than the Assyrians , ”
27833	27850	27851	27851	he	2353	“ And they were not savages by any means . A very high level of culture , ”
27861	27898	27851	27851	he	2353	“ I mean that they made beautiful statues and jewellery , and built splendid palaces . And they were very learned‐ they had glorious libraries and high towers for the purpose of astrological and astronomical observation . ”
27899	27902	27904	27904	Robert	132	“ Er ? ”
27906	27915	27917	27919	the learned gentleman	2353	“ I mean for — star‐gazing and fortune‐telling , ”
27921	27931	27917	27919	the learned gentleman	2353	“ and there were temples and beautiful hanging gardens — ”
27932	27942	27944	27944	Jane	134	“ I ’ll go to Babylon if you like , ”
27953	27956	27948	27949	the others	325	“ Done ! ”
27967	27970	27972	27974	the learned gentleman	2353	“ Ah , ”
27980	27994	27972	27974	the learned gentleman	2353	“ one can go so far in dreams , when one is young . ”
28007	28020	28021	28021	he	2353	“ I hope you ’ll have a — a — jolly game , ”
28031	28045	28047	28047	Cyril	131	“ He said ‘ jolly ’ as if it was a foreign language , ”
28049	28075	28047	28047	Cyril	131	“ Come on , let ’s get the Psammead and go now . I think Babylon seems a most frightfully jolly place to go to . ”
28119	28126	28106	28106	it	751	“ The sand is good thereabouts , ”
28141	28169	28138	28138	Cyril	131	“ We want to go to Babylon to look for the part of you that was lost . Will you please let us go there through you ? ”
28170	28178	28180	28180	Jane	134	“ Please put us down just outside , ”
28183	28198	28180	28180	Jane	134	“ and then if we do n’t like it we need n’t go inside . ”
28199	28206	28208	28209	the Psammead	136	“ Do n’t be all day , ”
28228	28235	28236	28236	she	133	“ Ur — hekau — setcheh ! ”
28446	28453	28455	28455	Anthea	133	“ Oh , how perfectly lovely ! ”
28457	28487	28455	28455	Anthea	133	“ Why , it ’s like home exactly — I mean England — only everything ’s bluer , and whiter , and greener , and the flowers are bigger . ”
28509	28522	28524	28524	Anthea	133	“ I ’m certain there ’s nothing to be frightened of here , ”
28526	28532	28534	28534	Jane	134	“ I do n’t know , ”
28536	28589	28534	28534	Jane	134	“ I suppose the fruit‐trees go on just the same even when people are killing each other . I did n’t half like what the learned gentleman said about the hanging gardens . I suppose they have gardens on purpose to hang people in . I do hope this is n’t one . ”
28590	28597	28599	28599	Cyril	131	“ Of course it is n’t , ”
28601	28634	28599	28599	Cyril	131	“ The hanging gardens are just gardens hung up — I think on chains between houses , do n’t you know , like trays . Come on ; let ’s get somewhere . ”
28762	28776	28778	28778	Anthea	133	“ It ’s like between the squares in ‘ Through the Looking‐glass , ’ ”
28805	28810	28812	28812	Cyril	131	“ These are vines , ”
28815	28839	28812	28812	Cyril	131	“ and I know this is a vineyard . I should n’t wonder if there was a wine‐press inside that place over there . ”
29074	29085	29087	29087	Cyril	131	“ Those feathery things along by the water are palms , ”
29090	29099	29100	29100	Robert	132	“ Oh , yes ; you know everything , ”
29103	29124	29100	29100	Robert	132	“ What ’s all that grey‐green stuff you see away over there , where it ’s all flat and sandy ? ”
29125	29129	29131	29131	Cyril	131	“ All right , ”
29134	29160	29131	29131	Cyril	131	“ I do n’t want to tell you anything . I only thought you ’d like to know a palm‐tree when you saw it again . ”
29161	29164	29166	29166	Anthea	133	“ Look ! ”
29168	29175	29166	29166	Anthea	133	“ they ’re opening the gates . ”
29221	29232	29234	29234	Jane	134	“ I do n’t like the sound of those gates , ”
29236	29250	29234	29234	Jane	134	“ Fancy being inside when they shut . You ’d never get out . ”
29251	29265	29266	29267	the Psammead	400	“ You ’ve got an arch of your own to go out by , ”
29279	29307	29266	29267	the Psammead	400	“ Do n’t behave so like a girl . If I were you I should just march right into the town and ask to see the king . ”
29390	29393	29395	29395	Cyril	131	“ Courage , ”
29397	29413	29395	29395	Cyril	131	“ Step out . It ’s no use trying to sneak past . Be bold ! ”
29422	29427	29430	29430	its	795	“ The British Grenadiers , ”
29463	29468	29469	29469	they	797	“ Who goes there ? ”
29524	29531	29533	29533	Cyril	131	“ We come from very far , ”
29536	29554	29533	29533	Cyril	131	“ From the Empire where the sun never sets , and we want to see your King . ”
29555	29562	29564	29564	Anthea	133	“ If it ’s quite convenient , ”
29566	29578	29580	29581	the gatekeeper	800	“ The King ( may he live for ever ! ) , ”
29583	29605	29580	29581	the gatekeeper	800	“ is gone to fetch home his fourteenth wife . Where on earth have you come from not to know that ? ”
29606	29611	29613	29613	Anthea	133	“ The Queen then , ”
29632	29636	29638	29639	the gatekeeper	800	“ The Queen , ”
29641	29658	29638	29639	the gatekeeper	800	“ ( may she live for ever ! ) gives audience today three hours after sun‐rising . ”
29659	29674	29676	29676	Cyril	131	“ But what are we to do till the end of the three hours ? ”
29720	29730	29731	29731	he	800	“ Let them go in and look about them , ”
29734	29754	29755	29755	He	800	“ I ’ll wager my best sword they ’ve never seen anything to come near our little — village . ”
29771	29775	29776	29777	The gatekeeper	800	“ herring pond . ”
29780	29789	29798	29798	his	809	“ They ’re only children , after all , ”
29801	29857	29798	29798	his	809	“ Let me off for a few minutes , Captain , and I ’ll take them to my place and see if my good woman ca n’t fit them up in something a little less outlandish than their present rig . Then they can have a look round without being mobbed . May I go ? ”
29858	29866	29868	29869	the Captain	810	“ Oh yes , if you like , ”
29871	29879	29868	29869	the Captain	810	“ but do n’t be all day . ”
30022	30025	30026	30026	he	2647	“ Here , ”
30029	30077	30026	30026	he	2647	“ just lend these children a mantle each , so that they can go about and see the place till the Queen ’s audience begins . You leave that wool for a bit , and show them round if you like . I must be off now . ”
30330	30355	30326	30327	the woman	613	“ It ’s nearly time now . We ought to be getting on towards the palace . It ’s as well to be early . ”
30605	30637	30592	30593	the Psammead	136	“ I ca n’t be bothered with queens . I ’ll go home with this lady . I ’m sure she ’ll get me some sand if you ask her to . ”
30638	30646	30648	30648	Jane	134	“ Oh ! do n’t leave us , ”
30669	30677	30679	30680	the Psammead	136	“ Do n’t be a little muff , ”
30684	30726	30679	30680	the Psammead	136	“ It ’s not a bit of good your having a charm . You never use it . If you want me you ’ve only got to say the name of power and ask the charm to bring me to you . ”
30727	30735	30737	30737	Jane	134	“ I ’d rather go with you , ”
30786	30794	30795	30795	Jane	134	“ You need n’t gawp like that , ”
30799	30834	30795	30795	Jane	134	“ I ’m not going to be bothered with queens any more than it is . And I know , wherever it is , it ’ll take jolly good care that it ’s safe . ”
30835	30841	30843	30844	every one	2347	“ She ’s right there , ”
30873	30903	30865	30865	She	134	“ You ’ll take me home with you , wo n’t you ? And let me play with your little girls till the others have done with the Queen . ”
30904	30912	30914	30915	the woman	613	“ Surely I will , little heart ! ”
30985	30999	30972	30972	Anthea	133	“ Let ’s ask the porter to take care of our Babylonian overcoats . ”
31033	31041	31043	31043	Cyril	131	“ We want to see the Queen , ”
31045	31058	31043	31043	Cyril	131	“ we come from the far Empire where the sun never sets ! ”
31187	31206	31233	31234	the woman	613	“ Three children from the land where the sun never sets ! Let them draw hither without fear . ”
31221	31230	31210	31210	they	278	“ Oh , Queen , live for ever ! ”
31263	31302	31258	31258	Anthea	133	“ Do n’t be frightened , I really am so glad you came ! The land where the sun never sets ! I am delighted to see you ! I was getting quite too dreadfully bored for anything ! ”
31318	31352	31308	31308	Cyril	131	“ Bobs , do n’t say anything to Panther . It ’s no use upsetting her , but we did n’t ask for Jane ’s address , and the Psammead ’s with her . ”
31353	31356	31358	31358	Robert	132	“ Well , ”
31360	31376	31358	31358	Robert	132	“ the charm can bring them to us at any moment . It said so . ”
31377	31382	31384	31384	Cyril	131	“ Oh , yes , ”
31390	31415	31384	31384	Cyril	131	“ We ’re all right , of course . So we are ! Oh , yes ! If we ’d only got the charm . ”
31424	31427	31421	31421	he	132	“ Crikey ! ”
31446	31460	31438	31438	Cyril	131	“ Jane ’s got the charm round her neck , you silly cuckoo . ”
31461	31464	31465	31465	Robert	132	“ Crikey ! ”
31496	31503	31504	31504	she	382	“ Just make yourselves comfortable there , ”
31507	31560	31504	31504	she	382	“ I ’m simply dying to talk to you , and to hear all about your wonderful country and how you got here , and everything , but I have to do justice every morning . Such a bore , is n’t it ? Do you do justice in your own country ? ”
31561	31567	31471	31472	THE Queen	382	“ No , said Cyril ; “
31589	31590	31504	31504	she	382	” “
31595	31600	31504	31504	she	382	” said the Queen , “
31639	31640	31641	31641	We	884	” “
31658	31662	31654	31654	Jane	134	” said Anthea , “
31673	31674	31654	31654	Jane	134	” “
31679	31684	31688	31688	Jane	134	” asked the Queen , “
31690	31691	31692	31692	Jane	134	” “
31715	31716	31717	31717	I	0	” “
31724	31729	31717	31717	I	0	” said the Queen . “
31734	31735	31731	31731	you	0	” “
31746	31750	31740	31740	We	884	” said Anthea . “
31755	31760	31740	31740	We	884	” said the Queen . “
31774	31775	31776	31776	We	884	” “
31783	31788	31776	31776	We	884	” said Robert hastily . “
31803	31804	31797	31797	We	884	” “
31870	31982	31860	31860	I	0	” The Queen settled herself on her throne and made a signal to her attendants . The children , whispering together among the cushions on the steps of the throne , decided that she was very beautiful and very kind , but perhaps just the least bit flighty . The first person who came to ask for justice was a woman whose brother had taken the money the father had left for her . The brother said it was the uncle who had the money . There was a good deal of talk and the children were growing rather bored , when the Queen suddenly clapped her hands , and said — “
32001	32002	31860	31860	I	0	” “
32010	32017	32005	32005	they	615	” Cyril could not help interrupting . “
32027	32032	32005	32005	they	615	” said the Queen . “
32039	32040	32005	32005	they	615	” “
32045	32050	32005	32005	they	615	” said the Queen ; “
32068	32111	32063	32063	you	897	” Then came a woman , in tears , with a torn veil and real ashes on her head — at least Anthea thought so , but it may have been only road‐dust . She complained that her husband was in prison . “
32115	32120	32121	32121	They	615	” said the Queen . “
32132	32137	32121	32121	They	615	” said the woman , “
32157	32158	32163	32163	he	898	” “
32171	32176	32163	32163	he	898	” said the Queen . “
32181	32187	32163	32163	he	898	” said the woman simply , “
32197	32198	32189	32189	they	615	” “
32204	32211	32200	32201	the man	2282	” said the Queen , smiling . “
32215	32230	32200	32201	the man	2282	” The next case was that of a boy who had stolen a fox . “
32236	32377	32200	32201	the man	2282	” whispered Robert . But the Queen ruled that nobody could have any possible reason for owning a fox , and still less for stealing one . And she did not believe that there were any foxes in Babylon ; she , at any rate , had never seen one . So the boy was released . The people came to the Queen about all sorts of family quarrels and neighbourly misunderstandings — from a fight between brothers over the division of an inheritance , to the dishonest and unfriendly conduct of a woman who had borrowed a cooking‐pot at the last New Year ’s festival , and not returned it yet . And the Queen decided everything , very , very decidedly indeed . At last she clapped her hands quite suddenly and with extreme loudness , and said — “
32385	32390	32378	32379	The audience	903	” Every one said , “
32398	32421	32378	32379	The audience	903	” and went out . And the children were left alone in the justice‐hall with the Queen of Babylon and her ladies . “
32424	32436	32378	32379	The audience	903	” said the Queen , with a long sigh of relief . “
32478	32592	32467	32467	we	907	” She led them through long , narrow corridors whose walls they somehow felt , were very , very thick , into a sort of garden courtyard . There were thick shrubs closely planted , and roses were trained over trellises , and made a pleasant shade — needed , indeed , for already the sun was as hot as it is in England in August at the seaside . Slaves spread cushions on a low , marble terrace , and a big man with a smooth face served cool drink in cups of gold studded with beryls . He drank a little from the Queen ’s cup before handing it to her . “
32600	32643	32467	32467	we	907	” whispered Robert , who had been carefully taught never to drink out of one of the nice , shiny , metal cups that are chained to the London drinking fountains without first rinsing it out thoroughly . The Queen overheard him . “
32648	32652	32467	32467	we	907	” said she . “
32677	32719	32467	32467	we	907	” The word made the children feel rather creepy ; but Ritti‐Marduk had tasted all the cups , so they felt pretty safe . The drink was delicious — very cold , and tasting like lemonade and partly like penny ices . “
32723	32759	32467	32467	we	907	” said the Queen . And all the Court ladies , in their beautiful , many‐folded , many‐coloured , fringed dresses , filed out slowly , and the children were left alone with the Queen . “
32762	32766	32467	32467	we	907	” she said , “
32773	32780	32781	32781	You	912	” They looked at each other . “
32785	32789	32781	32781	You	912	” said Cyril . “
32794	32798	32792	32792	Anthea	133	” said Robert . “
32805	32809	32803	32803	Cyril	131	” said Anthea . “
32829	32983	32803	32803	Cyril	131	” Cyril muttered that it was all very well , and so it was . For when he had told the tale of the Phœnix and the Carpet to the Ranee , it had been only the truth — and all the truth that he had to tell . But now it was not easy to tell a convincing story without mentioning the Amulet — which , of course , it would n’t have done to mention — and without owning that they were really living in London , about two thousand five hundred years later than the time they were talking in . Cyril took refuge in the tale of the Psammead and its wonderful power of making wishes come true . The children had never been able to tell anyone before , and Cyril was surprised to find that the spell which kept them silent in London did not work here . “
32997	33003	32994	32994	I	0	” he said to himself . “
33009	33014	33015	33015	We	914	” said the Queen . “
33044	33063	32994	32994	I	0	” Anthea explained that they did not know ; also why it was that they did not know . “
33071	33090	33091	33091	Ritti‐Marduk	163	” said the Queen , and every one breathed a deep sigh of relief as she said it . “
33109	33110	33111	33112	Might he”—Anthea	167	” “
33112	33116	33117	33117	he	163	he”—Anthea ’s voice was tremulous—“might
33136	33137	33117	33117	he	163	” “
33159	33170	33145	33145	He	163	” said the Queen heartily , and clapped her hands . “
33177	33207	33172	33172	I	0	” asked Cyril , pulling out a red‐backed penny account‐book , and feeling in his pockets for a stump of pencil that he knew was in one of them . “
33218	33219	33212	33212	I	0	” “
33230	33258	33222	33222	I	0	” said Cyril , finding the pencil and licking its point . He even had to bite the wood a little , for it was very blunt . “
33267	33272	33264	33265	clever boy	920	” said the Queen . “
33281	33323	33275	33275	me	0	” Cyril wrote on a leaf of the book — it was of rough , woolly paper , with hairs that stuck out and would have got in his pen if he had been using one , and ruled for accounts . “
33333	33337	33275	33275	me	0	” he wrote , “
33369	33370	33354	33355	The Queen	160	” “
33382	33387	33354	33355	The Queen	160	” said the Queen . “
33393	33394	33390	33390	you	0	” “
33400	33405	33390	33390	you	0	” replied Cyril cautiously , “
33439	33474	33432	33432	she	921	” Ritti‐Marduk , who had come in and had stood waiting while Cyril wrote , his Babylonish eyes nearly starting out of his Babylonish head , now took the letter , with some reluctance . “
33488	33493	33498	33500	most great lady	922	” he timidly asked . “
33502	33503	33498	33500	most great lady	922	” “
33506	33512	33498	33500	most great lady	922	” said Robert , unexpectedly , “
33557	33562	33563	33563	I	0	” he ended abruptly . “
33569	33576	33563	33563	I	0	” said Ritti‐Marduk , bending timorously . “
33587	33591	33583	33583	she	921	” said Robert , “
33608	33662	33598	33598	You	0	” Ritti‐Marduk went , seeming only partly satisfied ; and then the Queen began to admire the penny account‐book and the bit of pencil in so marked and significant a way that Cyril felt he could not do less than press them upon her as a gift . She ruffled the leaves delightedly . “
33668	33672	33598	33598	You	0	” she said . “
33691	33699	33688	33688	you	0	” her voice sank to a whisper , “
33712	33713	33688	33688	you	0	” “
33716	33754	33688	33688	you	0	” said Cyril , and hastily wrote the names of Alfred the Great , Shakespeare , Nelson , Gordon , Lord Beaconsfield , Mr. Rudyard Kipling , and Mr. Sherlock Holmes , while the Queen watched him with “
33758	33780	33688	33688	you	0	” as Anthea said afterwards . She took the book and hid it reverently among the bright folds of her gown . “
33792	33796	33781	33781	You	0	” she said . “
33813	33814	33815	33815	I	0	” “
33821	33825	33815	33815	I	0	” said Cyril . “
33867	33868	33857	33858	Dr. Parker	177	” “
33872	33884	33857	33858	Dr. Parker	177	” said the Queen , putting her hands to her ears . “
33960	33961	33958	33958	you	0	” “
33964	33968	33958	33958	you	0	” said Anthea . “
33982	33983	33977	33978	the King	2789	” “
33997	34003	33988	33988	you	0	” said the Queen gently . “
34009	34013	34004	34004	I	0	” Anthea hastened to say—“the
34050	34056	34057	34057	She	935	” The Queen looked bewildered . “
34060	34064	34057	34057	She	935	” explained Robert , “
34090	34091	34076	34078	Henry the Eighth	179	” “
34096	34102	34103	34104	a king	940	” said the Queen scornfully , “
34127	34128	34116	34117	No one	344	” “
34137	34141	34116	34117	No one	344	” asked Anthea . “
34172	34173	34166	34166	They	943	” “
34177	34183	34166	34166	They	943	” said Anthea , gasping . “
34190	34196	34169	34170	the wives	945	” the Queen went on , “
34391	34392	34381	34381	we	948	” “
34398	34414	34381	34381	we	948	” said Anthea , who wanted to get to the princess part of the story . “
34419	34424	34381	34381	we	948	” said the Queen , “
34493	34494	34470	34470	he	953	” “
34499	34503	34470	34470	he	953	” said Cyril . “
34674	34856	34664	34664	I	0	” She led them into a dark , cool hall , with many cushions on the floor . On these they sat , and low tables were brought — beautiful tables of smooth , blue stone mounted in gold . On these , golden trays were placed ; but there were no knives , or forks , or spoons . The children expected the Queen to call for them ; but no . She just ate with her fingers , and as the first dish was a great tray of boiled corn , and meat and raisins all mixed up together , and melted fat poured all over the tray , it was found difficult to follow her example with anything like what we are used to think of as good table manners . There were stewed quinces afterwards , and dates in syrup , and thick yellowy cream . It was the kind of dinner you hardly ever get in Fitzroy Street . After dinner everybody went to sleep , even the children . The Queen awoke with a start . “
34860	34864	34664	34664	I	0	” she cried , “
34891	34892	34882	34882	I	0	” “
34906	34910	34911	34911	I	0	” Anthea asked . “
34921	34926	34917	34917	I	0	” said the Queen . “
34957	34965	34953	34953	I	0	” Ritti‐Marduk came in a moment later . “
34969	34973	34953	34953	I	0	” he said , “
35035	35125	35129	35129	she	968	” He bowed and withdrew . The horror of this threefold loss — Jane , the Psammead , and the Amulet — gave the children something to talk about while the Queen was dressing . I shall not report their conversation ; it was very gloomy . Every one repeated himself several times , and the discussion ended in each of them blaming the other two for having let Jane go . You know the sort of talk it was , do n’t you ? At last Cyril said — “
35173	35421	35437	35437	girl	978	” They did enjoy the banquet . They had a beautiful bath , which was delicious , were heavily oiled all over , including their hair , and that was most unpleasant . Then they dressed again and were presented to the King , who was most affable . The banquet was long ; there were all sorts of nice things to eat , and everybody seemed to eat and drink a good deal . Every one lay on cushions and couches , ladies on one side and gentlemen on the other ; and after the eating was done each lady went and sat by some gentleman , who seemed to be her sweetheart or her husband , for they were very affectionate to each other . The Court dresses had gold threads woven in them , very bright and beautiful . The middle of the room was left clear , and different people came and did amusing things . There were conjurers and jugglers and snake‐charmers , which last Anthea did not like at all . When it got dark torches were lighted . Cedar splinters dipped in oil blazed in copper dishes set high on poles . Then there was a dancer , who hardly danced at all , only just struck attitudes . She had hardly any clothes , and was not at all pretty . The children were rather bored by her , but every one else was delighted , including the King . “
35428	35432	35437	35437	girl	978	” he cried , “
35445	35446	35440	35440	you	977	” “
35451	35456	35440	35440	you	977	” said the dancer ; “
35471	35496	35497	35497	I	0	” And the King was so pleased with this modest and sensible reply that he gave her the gold collar off his own neck . “
35500	35512	35497	35497	I	0	” said Cyril , awed by the magnificence of the gift . “
35518	35523	35527	35527	his	2789	” whispered the Queen , “
35565	35566	35557	35557	you	0	” “
35572	35685	35557	35557	you	0	” said Anthea quickly . The minstrels had been playing off and on all the time , and their music reminded Anthea of the band she and the others had once had on the fifth of November — with penny horns , a tin whistle , a tea‐tray , the tongs , a policeman ’s rattle , and a toy drum . They had enjoyed this band very much at the time . But it was quite different when some one else was making the same kind of music . Anthea understood now that Father had not been really heartless and unreasonable when he had told them to stop that infuriating din . “
35691	35696	35557	35557	you	0	” Cyril was asking . “
35701	35705	35557	35557	you	0	” suggested Anthea . “
35729	35753	35709	35709	I	0	” Jane , the alto , was missing , and Robert , unlike the mother of the lady in the song , never could “
35758	35786	35709	35709	I	0	” but the song , even so , was sufficiently unlike anything any of them had ever heard to rouse the Babylonian Court to the wildest enthusiasm . “
35791	35796	35798	35798	my	0	” cried the King ; “
35812	35854	35855	35857	Men of Harlech	984	” So they sang : Shouts of applause greeted the ending of the verse , and the King would not be satisfied till they had sung all their part‐songs ( they only knew three ) twice over , and ended up with “
35858	35883	35855	35857	Men of Harlech	984	” in unison . Then the King stood up in his royal robes with his high , narrow crown on his head and shouted — “
35905	35906	35907	35907	We	987	” “
35921	35924	35917	35918	the dancer	2934	” whispered Anthea “
35933	35937	35917	35918	the dancer	2934	” said Robert . “
35950	35985	35942	35942	I	0	” said Anthea . But Robert , who was excited by the music , and the flaring torches , and the applause and the opportunity , spoke up before the others could stop him . “
36002	36011	35999	36000	UR‐HEKAU SETCHEH	181	” he said , adding as an afterthought , “
36019	36091	35942	35942	I	0	” As he spoke the great name those in the pillared hall fell on their faces , and lay still . All but the Queen who crouched amid her cushions with her head in her hands , and the King , who stood upright , perfectly still , like the statue of a king in stone . It was only for a moment though . Then his great voice thundered out — “
36097	36132	36133	36136	Impious and sacrilegious wretches	990	” Instantly , from nowhere as it seemed , sprang eight soldiers in bright armour inlaid with gold , and tunics of red and white . Very splendid they were , and very alarming . “
36138	36143	35942	35942	I	0	” shouted the King . “
36179	36222	36166	36166	they	989	” A wall of scarlet and white and steel and gold closed up round the children and hurried them away among the many pillars of the great hall . As they went they heard the voices of the courtiers loud in horror . “
36230	36237	36223	36223	You	993	” said Cyril with extreme bitterness . “
36252	36316	36245	36245	It	994	” said Anthea desperately . They could not see where they were going , because the guard surrounded them so closely , but the ground under their feet , smooth marble at first , grew rougher like stone , then it was loose earth and sand , and they felt the night air . Then there was more stone , and steps down . “
36336	36539	36542	36542	your	997	” said Cyril . And they were . At least it was not below a moat , but below the river Euphrates , which was just as bad if not worse . In a most unpleasant place it was . Dark , very , very damp , and with an odd , musty smell rather like the shells of oysters . There was a torch — that is to say , a copper basket on a high stick with oiled wood burning in it . By its light the children saw that the walls were green , and that trickles of water ran down them and dripped from the roof . There were things on the floor that looked like newts , and in the dark corners creepy , shiny things moved sluggishly , uneasily , horribly . Robert ’s heart sank right into those really reliable boots of his . Anthea and Cyril each had a private struggle with that inside disagreeableness which is part of all of us , and which is sometimes called the Old Adam — and both were victors . Neither of them said to Robert ( and both tried hard not even to think it ) , “
36545	36554	36542	36542	your	997	” Anthea had the additional temptation to add , “
36560	36567	36555	36555	I	0	” And she resisted it successfully . “
36574	36585	36555	36555	I	0	” said the captain of the guard to the gaoler . “
36614	36615	36608	36608	He	2789	” “
36620	36625	36616	36618	Poor little kids	1000	” said the gaoler . “
36630	36635	36616	36618	Poor little kids	1000	” said the captain . “
36664	36709	36710	36710	Courage	182	” The soldiers tramped heavily off in their white and red and steel and gold . The gaoler , with a bunch of big keys in his hand , stood looking pityingly at the children . He shook his head twice and went out . “
36712	36716	36710	36710	Courage	182	” said Anthea . “
36771	36772	36847	36848	old man	1004	” “
36775	36785	36847	36848	old man	1004	” said Cyril bitterly . And Robert suddenly said — “
36818	36841	36815	36815	I	0	” What he had forgotten was that his father was three thousand miles and five thousand or more years away from him . “
36850	36900	36847	36848	old man	1004	” said Cyril ; and Anthea got hold of Robert ’s hand and squeezed it . Then the gaoler came back with a platter of hard , flat cakes made of coarse grain , very different from the cream‐and‐juicy‐date feasts of the palace ; also a pitcher of water . “
36903	36907	36847	36848	old man	1004	” he said . “
36920	36925	36916	36916	You	1004	” said Anthea feverishly . “
36930	36945	36916	36916	You	1004	” said the gaoler , pointing to a heap of straw in a corner ; “
36951	36952	36966	36966	they	1005	” “
36959	36963	36966	36966	they	1005	” said Anthea , “
36972	36973	36966	36966	they	1005	” “
36983	36989	36974	36974	They	1005	” said the gaoler grimly , “
37024	37025	37007	37007	they	1005	” “
37029	37063	37007	37007	they	1005	” said three trembling voices , which their owners strove in vain to render firm . Then he went out , and the three were left alone in the damp , dim vault . “
37073	37083	37064	37064	I	0	” said Cyril , looking at the flickering brazier . “
37105	37109	37090	37090	you	0	” suggested Anthea . “
37121	37137	37117	37117	we	1006	” So they tried . But the blank silence of the damp dungeon remained unchanged . “
37146	37151	37142	37143	the Queen	382	” asked Cyril suddenly . “
37168	37169	37161	37166	the slave of the great names	1011	” “
37174	37178	37161	37166	the slave of the great names	1011	” said Robert , “
37199	37230	37245	37245	Nisroch	174	” Then Anthea pulled herself together . All her muscles tightened , and the muscles of her mind and soul , if you can call them that , tightened too . “
37234	37242	37245	37245	Nisroch	174	” she cried in a fervent voice . “
37258	37376	37245	37245	Nisroch	174	” There was a waiting silence . Then a cold , blue light awoke in the corner where the straw was — and in the light they saw coming towards them a strange and terrible figure . I wo n’t try to describe it , because Mr. Millar will draw it for you , exactly as it was , and exactly as the old Babylonians carved it on their stones , so that you can see it in our own British Museum at this day . I will just say that it had eagle ’s wings and an eagle ’s head and the body of a man . It came towards them , strong and unspeakably horrible . “
37382	37390	37245	37245	Nisroch	174	” cried Anthea ; but Cyril cried , “
37395	37413	37439	37441	the Great Ones	188	” The creature hesitated , then bowed low before them on the damp floor of the dungeon . “
37416	37435	37439	37441	the Great Ones	188	” it said , in a harsh , grating voice like large rusty keys being turned in locks . “
37459	37460	37451	37451	you	1016	” “
37467	37471	37461	37461	We	1018	” said Robert . “
37476	37480	37481	37481	we	1018	” cried Anthea ; “
37489	37592	37486	37486	Jane	134	” Nisroch raised his great arm and pointed at the wall of the dungeon . And , as he pointed , the wall disappeared , and instead of the damp , green , rocky surface , there shone and glowed a room with rich hangings of red silk embroidered with golden water‐lilies , with cushioned couches and great mirrors of polished steel ; and in it was the Queen , and before her , on a red pillow , sat the Psammead , its fur hunched up in an irritated , discontented way . On a blue‐covered couch lay Jane fast asleep . “
37598	37602	37486	37486	Jane	134	” said Nisroch . “
37623	37624	37608	37613	the Servant of the great Name	1020	” “
37631	37635	37608	37613	the Servant of the great Name	1020	” said Cyril . “
37646	37647	37648	37648	You	1022	” “
37653	37667	37648	37648	You	1022	” cried Anthea , not in the least knowing what she was saying . “
37680	37704	37671	37671	you	1022	” She caught the hand of the creature , and it was cold and hard in hers , like a hand of stone . “
37708	37716	37671	37671	you	1022	” said Nisroch . And they went . “
37723	37733	37671	37671	you	1022	” said the Queen as they stood before her . “
37807	37808	37796	37796	he	163	” “
37818	37822	37824	37824	Jane	134	” said Anthea , “
37832	37844	37830	37830	her	134	” She shook Jane with energy , and Jane slowly awoke . “
37854	37859	37830	37830	her	134	” said the Queen , “
37911	37912	37906	37906	me	0	” “
37919	37942	37906	37906	me	0	” said Anthea with desperate earnestness . She thought she knew enough of what the Babylonians were like when they were roused . “
37969	37970	37971	37971	Nisroch	174	” “
37973	37978	37971	37971	Nisroch	174	” echoed the Queen . “
37984	37992	37971	37971	Nisroch	174	” Jane sat up , blinking stupidly . “
38002	38021	37971	37971	Nisroch	174	” cried Cyril , catching up the Psammead , which mechanically bit him , but only very slightly . “
38027	38031	38033	38033	me	0	” asked Jane . “
38035	38040	38033	38033	me	0	” said the Queen . “
38043	38044	38045	38046	Ur‐Hekau Setcheh	181	” “
38048	38072	38073	38073	Jane	134	” said Jane sleepily , and held up the charm . And there they all were in the dining‐room at 300 Fitzroy Street . “
38075	38084	37971	37971	Nisroch	174	” cried Cyril with great presence of mind , “
38097	38101	37971	37971	Nisroch	174	” Jane went . “
38105	38123	37971	37971	Nisroch	174	” he said quickly , as the sound of her boots grew less loud on the stairs , “
38153	38154	37971	37971	Nisroch	174	” “
38157	38177	37971	37971	Nisroch	174	” said Cyril ; but Anthea felt that she could not have said a word to save her life . “
38190	38201	38180	38180	you	1037	” asked Jane , returning with the plate of sand . “
38218	38219	38212	38212	I	0	” “
38224	38229	38212	38212	I	0	” said Cyril carelessly . “
38260	38261	38248	38248	Mother	138	” “
38270	38313	38248	38248	Mother	138	” said Cyril to Jane , when he and the others had told her all about the Queen ’s talk and the banquet , and the variety entertainment , carefully stopping short before the beginning of the dungeon part of the story . “
38321	38325	38327	38327	you	0	” said Jane , “
38337	38338	38339	38339	We	1035	” “
38347	38351	38339	38339	We	1035	” said Cyril ; “
38398	38399	38395	38395	your	0	” “
38402	38406	38395	38395	your	0	” said Jane , “
38421	38422	38418	38418	his	1041	” “
38425	38429	38423	38423	Ritti‐Marduk	163	” said Cyril . “
38432	38436	38437	38437	Ritti‐Marduk	163	” said Jane , “
38539	38554	38530	38530	you	0	” The Psammead , roused from its sound sleep , told the same story . “
38557	38561	38530	38530	you	0	” it added , “
38590	38610	38575	38575	I	0	” The children did not know the meaning of rudimentary , but it sounded a rude , insulting word . “
38621	38626	38611	38611	I	0	” said Cyril sulkily . “
38631	38639	38656	38656	she	1046	” said the Psammead with withering irony , “
38677	38678	38656	38656	she	1046	” “
38685	38689	38682	38682	your	0	” said Robert , “
38710	38711	38691	38691	you	0	” “
38726	38731	38739	38739	she	1046	” rejoined the Sand‐fairy . “
38801	38802	38788	38788	She	1046	” “
38805	38815	38788	38788	She	1046	” said Cyril , with a sigh of resignation , “
38892	38893	38886	38886	You	1050	” “
38904	38910	38886	38886	You	1050	” asked the Psammead morosely . “
38929	38954	38921	38921	I	0	” And then everybody remembered with pain that the bass bag had , in the hurry of departure from Babylon , not been remembered . “
38963	38968	38969	38969	You	1050	” said Robert hastily . “
38986	38987	38969	38969	You	1050	” “
38990	38998	39000	39000	you	1050	” said the Psammead very crossly indeed , “
39043	39232	39000	39000	you	1050	” And it went then and there to sand , which , as you know , meant to bed . The boys went to St James ’s Park to feed the ducks , but they went alone . Anthea and Jane sat sewing all the afternoon . They cut off half a yard from each of their best green Liberty sashes . A towel cut in two formed a lining ; and they sat and sewed and sewed and sewed . What they were making was a bag for the Psammead . Each worked at a half of the bag . Jane ’s half had four‐leaved shamrocks embroidered on it . They were the only things she could do ( because she had been taught how at school , and , fortunately , some of the silk she had been taught with was left over ) . And even so , Anthea had to draw the pattern for her . Anthea ’s side of the bag had letters on it — worked hastily but affectionately in chain stitch . They were something like this : She would have put “
39236	39319	39000	39000	you	1050	” but she made the letters too big , so there was no room . The bag was made into a bag with old Nurse ’s sewing machine , and the strings of it were Anthea ’s and Jane ’s best red hair ribbons . At tea‐time , when the boys had come home with a most unfavourable report of the St James ’s Park ducks , Anthea ventured to awaken the Psammead , and to show it its new travelling bag . “
39322	39338	39000	39000	you	1050	” it said , sniffing a little contemptuously , yet at the same time affectionately , “
39345	39383	39000	39000	you	1050	” The Psammead seemed to pick up very easily the kind of things that people said nowadays . For a creature that had in its time associated with Megatheriums and Pterodactyls , its quickness was really wonderful . “
39391	39395	39000	39000	you	1050	” it said , “
39422	39423	39413	39413	you	1052	” “
39436	39444	39445	39445	I	0	” said Cyril . But Jane said — “
39510	39541	39503	39503	she	1054	” The others exchanged looks of silent rejoicing at the thought of their cleverness in having concealed from Jane the terrors they had suffered in the dungeon below the Euphrates . “
39548	39553	39503	39503	she	1054	” Jane went on , “
39588	39589	39578	39578	Moses	193	” “
39597	39602	39590	39590	I	0	” said Anthea shuddering . “
39636	39725	39629	39629	I	0	” There was a good deal of discussion , but it all ended in everybody ’s agreeing to Jane ’s idea . And next morning directly after breakfast ( which was kippers , and very nice ) the Psammead was invited to get into his travelling carriage . The moment after it had done so , with stiff , furry reluctance , like that of a cat when you want to nurse it , and its ideas are not the same as yours , old Nurse came in . “
39730	39734	39728	39728	chickies	1060	” she said , “
39741	39742	39736	39736	you	1060	” “
39750	39754	39747	39747	Nurse	142	” said Anthea ; “
39775	39776	39762	39762	We	1059	” “
39779	39784	39762	39762	We	1059	” said old Nurse , “
39805	39853	39796	39796	your	1060	” She cleared away the kipper bones and the tea‐things , and when she had swept up the crumbs and removed the cloth , the Amulet was held up and the order given — just as Duchesses ( and other people ) give it to their coachmen . “
39859	39873	39796	39796	your	1060	” said Anthea , when Cyril had uttered the wonderful Name of Power . “
39879	39919	39875	39875	Moses	193	” added Jane . And there , in the dingy Fitzroy Street dining‐room , the Amulet grew big , and it was an arch , and through it they saw a blue , blue sky and a running river . “
39924	39940	39875	39875	Moses	193	” said Cyril , and pulled down Jane ’s hand with the Amulet in it . “
39948	39952	39875	39875	Moses	193	” he said . “
39980	39981	39960	39960	We	1062	” “
39988	40002	39960	39960	We	1062	” asked Jane impatiently , trying to get her hand away from Cyril . “
40012	40145	40006	40009	the Queen of Babylon	2869	” said Cyril . And then every one saw it . For some days life flowed in a very slow , dusty , uneventful stream . The children could never go out all at once , because they never knew when the King of Babylon would go out lion hunting and leave his Queen free to pay them that surprise visit to which she was , without doubt , eagerly looking forward . So they took it in turns , two and two , to go out and to stay in . The stay‐at‐homes would have been much duller than they were but for the new interest taken in them by the learned gentleman . He called Anthea in one day to show her a beautiful necklace of purple and gold beads . “
40152	40156	40146	40146	I	0	” she said , “
40159	40160	40146	40146	I	0	” “
40168	40169	40170	40170	I	0	” “
40182	40187	40177	40177	I	0	” said Anthea cautiously . “
40192	40198	40177	40177	I	0	” said the learned gentleman , “
40219	40245	40246	40246	I	0	” The other three were all out that day . The boys had been going to the Zoo , and Jane had said so plaintively , “
40260	40293	40249	40249	I	0	” that Anthea had told her to run along then . And she had run , catching the boys before that part of the road where Fitzroy Street suddenly becomes Fitzroy Square . “
40302	40306	40294	40294	I	0	” said Anthea . “
40328	40329	40307	40307	I	0	” “
40337	40367	40307	40307	I	0	” said he . So she sat down and told . And he asked her a lot of questions , and she answered them as well as she could . “
40372	40378	40379	40379	One	346	” he said at last . “
40421	40434	40437	40437	you	0	” He suddenly put a cold , thin hand on her forehead . “
40443	40447	40437	40437	you	0	” said she . “
40457	40462	40448	40448	I	0	” he went on . “
40514	40515	40492	40492	you	0	” “
40521	40526	40527	40527	I	0	” said Anthea reassuringly . “
40542	40596	40639	40639	November	194	” It was not quite so simple when Anthea , having heard the others come in , went down , and before she had had time to ask how they had liked the Zoo , heard a noise outside , compared to which the wild beasts ’ noises were gentle as singing birds . “
40600	40604	40639	40639	November	194	” cried Anthea , “
40609	40627	40631	40632	a guy	1069	” The loud hum of many voices came through the open window . Words could be distinguished . “
40634	40635	40631	40632	a guy	1069	” “
40659	40660	40649	40651	a ballet lady	1071	” “
40675	40685	40671	40671	I	0	” Then came a clear voice that they knew . “
40690	40694	40697	40697	she	1071	” it said . “
40702	40708	40697	40697	she	1071	” cried a dozen voices . “
40714	40765	40766	40766	Jimminy	196	” one voice replied . The children rushed to the door . A crowd was on the road and pavement . In the middle of the crowd , plainly to be seen from the top of the steps , were the beautiful face and bright veil of the Babylonian Queen . “
40768	40778	40780	40780	she	1071	” cried Robert , and ran down the steps , “
40783	40784	40780	40780	she	1071	” “
40787	40791	40796	40797	the lady	1074	” he cried , “
40812	40813	40800	40800	She	1071	” “
40821	40863	40800	40800	She	1071	” snorted a fat woman with marrows on a hand‐cart . All the same the crowd made way a little . The Queen met Robert on the pavement , and Cyril joined them , the Psammead bag still on his arm . “
40866	40870	40800	40800	She	1071	” he whispered ; “
40881	40882	40873	40874	the Psammead	136	” “
40899	40903	40883	40883	I	0	” said Robert ; “
40913	40914	40909	40909	my	0	” “
40917	40922	40909	40909	my	0	” said the Queen . “
40949	41024	40942	40942	they	1080	” The Psammead blew itself out till the bag was a very tight fit for it ; and suddenly every man , woman , and child in that crowd felt that it had not enough clothes on . For , of course , the Queen ’s idea of proper dress was the dress that had been proper for the working‐classes three thousand years ago in Babylon — and there was not much of it . “
41028	41034	40942	40942	they	1080	” said the marrow‐selling woman , “
41045	41056	40942	40942	they	1080	” and she wheeled her cart away very quickly indeed . “
41071	41079	41057	41058	Some one	376	” said a man who sold bootlaces . “
41087	41095	41084	41084	you	1083	” said the man next to him . “
41109	41110	41111	41111	I	0	” “
41124	41129	41118	41118	I	0	” said the bootlace‐seller . “
41151	41196	41118	41118	I	0	” The crowd was all talking at once , and getting rather angry . But no one seemed to think of blaming the Queen . Anthea bounded down the steps and pulled her up ; the others followed , and the door was shut . “
41205	41209	41118	41118	I	0	” they heard . “
41218	41252	41215	41215	I	0	” And the crowd , coming slowly to the same mind , dispersed , followed by another crowd of persons who were not dressed in what the Queen thought was the proper way . “
41261	41270	41253	41253	We	1086	” said Anthea in the tones of despair . “
41281	41293	41275	41275	you	0	” The Queen leaned against the arm of the horse‐hair sofa . “
41306	41310	41311	41311	Our	1086	” she questioned . “
41319	41323	41311	41311	Our	1086	” said Cyril . “
41335	41343	41331	41331	I	0	” she remarked in an injured tone , “
41406	41407	41402	41402	you	0	” “
41416	41420	41402	41402	you	0	” said Robert . “
41455	41456	41457	41457	You	0	” “
41465	41470	41457	41457	You	0	” she said loftily . “
41477	41481	41475	41475	you	0	” said Cyril . “
41492	41493	41485	41486	a king	940	” “
41503	41504	41457	41457	You	0	” “
41517	41518	41457	41457	You	0	” “
41524	41530	41457	41457	You	0	” said the Queen disparagingly . “
41542	41547	41538	41538	your	0	” The girls shuddered . “
41555	41562	41552	41552	yours	0	” the Queen went on pleasantly , “
41584	41585	41581	41581	I	0	” “
41591	41595	41587	41587	you	0	” asked Jane . “
41615	41664	41611	41611	you	0	” I really am not going to explain again how it was that the children could understand other languages than their own so thoroughly , and talk them , too , so that it felt and sounded ( to them ) just as though they were talking English . “
41667	41672	41611	41611	you	0	” said Cyril bluntly , “
41695	41696	41685	41685	you	0	” “
41706	41716	41699	41699	I	0	” said the Queen , arranging her starry veil . “
41740	41741	41738	41738	Queen	2827	” “
41747	41753	41738	41738	Queen	2827	” said Anthea in haste ; “
41777	41812	41758	41758	we	1107	” she added kindly , because she remembered how nice the Queen had been to them in Babylon , even if she had been a little deceitful in the matter of Jane and Psammead . “
41818	41823	41758	41758	we	1107	” said Cyril hopefully ; “
41843	41844	41845	41845	I	0	” “
41848	41853	41845	41845	I	0	” said Anthea suddenly . “
41874	41929	41866	41866	her	138	” The blue silk , lace‐trimmed cloak did indeed hide some of the Queen ’s startling splendours , but the hat fitted very badly . It had pink roses in it ; and there was something about the coat or the hat or the Queen , that made her look somehow not very respectable . “
41935	41944	41866	41866	her	138	” said Anthea , when Cyril whispered this . “
41974	41975	41963	41963	she	138	” “
41980	41984	41963	41963	she	138	” said Robert . “
42024	42066	42014	42014	they	680	” The blue silk coat and the pink‐rosed hat attracted almost as much attention as the royal costume had done ; and the children were uncommonly glad to get out of the noisy streets into the grey quiet of the Museum . “
42075	42109	42014	42014	they	680	” said a man at the counter . The party had no umbrellas , and the only parcel was the bag containing the Psammead , which the Queen had insisted should be brought . “
42118	42124	42128	42128	you	0	” said the Psammead softly , “
42132	42133	42128	42128	you	0	” “
42141	42158	42134	42134	I	0	” said Anthea hastily , and went to sit on the seat near the drinking fountain . “
42168	42174	42175	42175	I	0	” said the creature crossly ; “
42180	42291	42175	42175	I	0	” Anthea obediently moved to another seat and waited . Indeed she waited , and waited , and waited , and waited , and waited . The Psammead dropped into an uneasy slumber . Anthea had long ceased to watch the swing‐door that always let out the wrong person , and she was herself almost asleep , and still the others did not come back . It was quite a start when Anthea suddenly realized that they had come back , and that they were not alone . Behind them was quite a crowd of men in uniform , and several gentlemen were there . Every one seemed very angry . “
42295	42304	42175	42175	I	0	” said the nicest of the angry gentlemen . “
42324	42325	42175	42175	I	0	” “
42341	42347	42338	42339	the police	680	” said the nastiest gentleman . “
42358	42380	42349	42349	we	1117	” added the nice one , who was really very nice indeed , and seemed to be over all the others . “
42391	42422	42382	42382	I	0	” asked Robert . The nicest gentleman nodded , and the officials stood round the Queen , the others forming a sort of guard while Robert crossed over to Anthea . “
42429	42439	42382	42382	I	0	” he replied to Anthea ’s glance of inquiry . “
42516	42517	42523	42524	a whacker	1124	” “
42526	42527	42523	42524	a whacker	1124	” “
42589	42590	42580	42580	you	1115	” “
42595	42606	42580	42580	you	1115	” said Anthea , and went up to the Queen . “
42611	42615	42616	42621	the learned gentleman in our house	1129	” she said ; “
42639	42644	42645	42645	You	1115	” The Queen nodded . “
42648	42654	42655	42655	she	1119	” said the nastiest gentleman , “
42660	42661	42655	42655	she	1119	” “
42670	42675	42667	42667	I	0	” said Anthea bashfully . “
42680	42686	42667	42667	I	0	” said the nice gentleman , “
42714	42787	42788	42788	I	0	” Anthea took the Queen ’s hand and gently pulled her away . The other children followed , and the black crowd of angry gentlemen stood on the steps watching them . It was when the little party of disgraced children , with the Queen who had disgraced them , had reached the middle of the courtyard that her eyes fell on the bag where the Psammead was . She stopped short . “
42791	42800	42788	42788	I	0	” she said , very loud and clear , “
42832	42833	42838	42840	a tiresome woman	1138	” “
42842	43111	42836	42836	you	0	” said the Psammead in its bag , but it puffed itself out . Next moment there was a crash . The glass swing doors and all their framework were smashed suddenly and completely . The crowd of angry gentlemen sprang aside when they saw what had done this . But the nastiest of them was not quick enough , and he was roughly pushed out of the way by an enormous stone bull that was floating steadily through the door . It came and stood beside the Queen in the middle of the courtyard . It was followed by more stone images , by great slabs of carved stone , bricks , helmets , tools , weapons , fetters , wine‐jars , bowls , bottles , vases , jugs , saucers , seals , and the round long things , something like rolling pins with marks on them like the print of little bird‐feet , necklaces , collars , rings , armlets , earrings — heaps and heaps and heaps of things , far more than anyone had time to count , or even to see distinctly . All the angry gentlemen had abruptly sat down on the Museum steps except the nice one . He stood with his hands in his pockets just as though he was quite used to seeing great stone bulls and all sorts of small Babylonish objects float out into the Museum yard . But he sent a man to close the big iron gates . A journalist , who was just leaving the museum , spoke to Robert as he passed . “
43117	43121	43123	43123	she	1139	” he said . “
43127	43128	43123	43123	she	1139	” “
43131	43168	43123	43123	she	1139	” said Robert recklessly . The journalist passed through the gates just before they were shut . He rushed off to Fleet Street , and his paper got out a new edition within half an hour . “
43174	43182	43123	43123	she	1139	“ IMPERTINENT MIRACLE AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM . ”
43258	43267	43236	43239	the Baby‐ lonian Queen	1144	“ I wish we were in your house . ”
43282	43286	43277	43278	The Psammead	136	“ Look here , ”
43290	43335	43277	43278	The Psammead	136	“ they ’ll come after you , and they ’ll find me . There ’ll be a National Cage built for me at Westminster , and I shall have to work at politics . Why would n’t you leave the things in their places ? ”
43336	43347	43349	43350	the Queen	382	“ What a temper you have , have n’t you ? ”
43353	43371	43349	43350	the Queen	382	“ I wish all the things were back in their places . Will that do for you ? ”
43382	43392	43372	43373	The Psammead	136	“ I ca n’t refuse to give your wishes , ”
43396	43413	43372	43373	The Psammead	136	“ but I can Bite . And I will if this goes on . Now then . ”
43414	43420	43422	43422	Anthea	133	“ Ah , do n’t , ”
43429	43453	43422	43422	Anthea	133	“ it ’s dreadful for us too . Do n’t you desert us . Perhaps she ’ll wish herself at home again soon . ”
43454	43458	43460	43461	the Psammead	136	“ Not she , ”
43467	43475	43477	43478	the Queen	382	“ Take me to see your City , ”
43487	43516	43480	43481	The children	278	“ If we had some money we could take her about in a cab . People would n’t notice her so much then . But we have n’t . ”
43517	43521	43523	43524	the Queen	382	“ Sell this , ”
43533	43543	43545	43545	Cyril	131	“ They ’d only think we ’d stolen it , ”
43548	43555	43545	43545	Cyril	131	“ and put us in prison . ”
43556	43568	43570	43571	the Queen	382	“ All roads lead to prison with you , it seems , ”
43573	43578	43580	43580	Anthea	133	“ The learned gentleman ! ”
43594	43598	43599	43599	she	133	“ Look here , ”
43602	43611	43599	43599	she	133	“ will you buy this for a pound ? ”
43612	43615	43616	43616	he	1152	“ Oh ! ”
43633	43640	43642	43642	Anthea	133	“ It ’s my very own , ”
43644	43653	43642	43642	Anthea	133	“ it was given to me to sell . ”
43654	43662	43664	43666	the learned gentleman	2353	“ I ’ll lend you a pound , ”
43668	43692	43664	43666	the learned gentleman	2353	“ with pleasure ; and I ’ll take care of the ring for you . Who did you say gave it to you ? ”
43693	43698	43700	43700	Anthea	133	“ We call her , ”
43703	43709	43700	43700	Anthea	133	“ the Queen of Babylon . ”
43710	43716	43717	43717	he	1152	“ Is it a game ? ”
43721	43742	43744	43744	Anthea	133	“ It ’ll be a pretty game if I do n’t get the money to pay for cabs for her , ”
43746	43751	43752	43752	he	1152	“ I sometimes think , ”
43756	43766	43752	43752	he	1152	“ that I am becoming insane , or that — ”
43767	43788	43825	43825	he	1152	“ Or that I am ; but I ’m not , and you ’re not , and she ’s not . ”
43789	43801	43802	43802	he	1152	“ Does she say that she ’s the Queen of Babylon ? ”
43806	43809	43811	43811	Anthea	133	“ Yes , ”
43814	43824	43825	43825	he	1152	“ This thought‐transference is more far‐reaching than I imagined , ”
43828	43862	43825	43825	he	1152	“ I suppose I have unconsciously influenced her , too . I never thought my Babylonish studies would bear fruit like this . Horrible ! There are more things in heaven and earth — ”
43863	43866	43868	43868	Anthea	133	“ Yes , ”
43870	43888	43889	43889	He	1152	“ heaps more . And the pound is the thing I want more than anything on earth . ”
43898	43902	43903	43903	he	1152	“ This thought‐transference ! ”
43906	43945	43903	43903	he	1152	“ It ’s undoubtedly a Babylonian ring — or it seems so to me . But perhaps I have hypnotised myself . I will see a doctor the moment I have corrected the last proofs of my book . ”
43946	43951	43953	43953	Anthea	133	“ Yes , do ! ”
43955	43963	43953	43953	Anthea	133	“ and thank you so very much . ”
44031	44049	44050	44050	she	133	“ But how badly you keep your slaves . How wretched and poor and neglected they seem , ”
44063	44073	44075	44075	Jane	134	“ They are n’t slaves ; they ’re working‐people , ”
44077	44133	44075	44075	Jane	134	“ Of course they ’re working‐people . That ’s what slaves are . Do n’t you tell me . Do you suppose I do n’t know a slave ’s face when I see it ? Why do n’t their masters see that they ’re better fed and better clothed ? Tell me in three words . ”
44164	44179	44181	44182	the Queen	382	“ You ’ll have a revolt of your slaves if you ’re not careful , ”
44184	44189	44191	44191	Cyril	131	“ Oh , no , ”
44193	44219	44191	44191	Cyril	131	“ you see they have votes — that makes them safe not to revolt . It makes all the difference . Father told me so . ”
44220	44226	44228	44229	the Queen	382	“ What is this vote ? ”
44231	44244	44228	44229	the Queen	382	“ Is it a charm ? What do they do with it ? ”
44245	44251	44253	44255	the harassed Cyril	131	“ I do n’t know , ”
44257	44277	44253	44255	the harassed Cyril	131	“ it ’s just a vote , that ’s all ! They do n’t do anything particular with it . ”
44278	44282	44284	44285	the Queen	382	“ I see , ”
44287	44317	44284	44285	the Queen	382	“ a sort of plaything . Well , I wish that all these slaves may have in their hands this moment their full of their favourite meat and drink . ”
44449	44458	44460	44461	the Queen	382	“ Makes a difference , does n’t it ? ”
44463	44474	44476	44476	Jane	134	“ That ’s the best wish you ’ve had yet , ”
44489	44501	44502	44502	he	1183	“ I ai n’t agoin ’ to drive you no further , ”
44505	44510	44502	44502	he	1183	“ Out you gets . ”
44517	44523	44524	44524	he	1183	“ I wants my tea , ”
44564	44571	44572	44572	he	1183	“ You pay me my fare , ”
44589	44596	44598	44598	Cyril	131	“ We ’ll take another cab , ”
44602	44614	44598	44598	Cyril	131	“ Give me change for a sovereign , if you please . ”
44672	44676	44678	44678	Robert	132	“ Come on , ”
44716	44723	44725	44728	the Queen of Babylon	2869	“ How ugly their clothes are , ”
44730	44771	44725	44728	the Queen of Babylon	2869	“ They ’d be rather fine men , some of them , if they were dressed decently , especially the ones with the beautiful long , curved noses . I wish they were dressed like the Babylonians of my court . ”
44844	44848	44849	44855	a youth who had always been fair‐haired	1198	“ I say , ”
44860	44882	44849	44855	a youth who had always been fair‐haired	1198	“ it ’s only fancy of course — something wrong with my eyes — but you chaps do look so rum . ”
44883	44886	44888	44889	his friend	1199	“ Rum , ”
44891	44932	44888	44889	his friend	1199	“ Look at you . You in a sash ! My hat ! And your hair ’s gone black and you ’ve got a beard . It ’s my belief we ’ve been poisoned . You do look a jackape . ”
44933	44968	44849	44855	a youth who had always been fair‐haired	1198	“ Old Levinstein do n’t look so bad . But how was it done — that ’s what I want to know . How was it done ? Is it conjuring , or what ? ”
44969	44981	44983	44984	old Levinstein	201	“ I think it is chust a ver ’ bad tream , ”
44989	45019	44983	44984	old Levinstein	201	“ all along Bishopsgate I haf seen the gommon people have their hants full of food — goot food . Oh yes , without doubt a very bad tream ! ”
45020	45029	45031	45032	the clerk	1201	“ Then I ’m dreaming too , sir , ”
45045	45058	45031	45032	the clerk	1201	“ I see my feet in beastly sandals as plain as plain . ”
45059	45066	45068	45070	old Mr Levinstein	202	“ All that goot food wasted , ”
45080	45134	45135	45135	I	0	” The Members of the Stock Exchange are said to be at all times a noisy lot . But the noise they made now to express their disgust at the costumes of ancient Babylon , was far louder than their ordinary row . One had to shout before one could hear oneself speak . “
45139	45171	45172	45172	I	0	” said the clerk who thought it was conjuring — he was quite close to the children and they trembled , because they knew that whatever he wished would come true . “
45182	45200	45260	45260	they	680	” And , of course , instantly they did know , and they pressed round the Queen . “
45222	45235	45219	45220	the police	680	” two or three voices shouted at once . The Queen recoiled . “
45240	45244	45245	45245	they	680	” she asked . “
45263	45264	45265	45265	They	680	” “
45272	45277	45265	45265	They	680	” said Cyril briefly . “
45296	45297	45287	45287	I	0	” “
45305	45347	45298	45298	I	0	” cried the Queen . The exhausted Psammead was panting and trembling , but the Queen ’s guards in red and green garments , and brass and iron gear , choked Throgmorton Street , and bared weapons flashed round the Queen . “
45352	45358	45348	45348	I	0	” said a Mr Rosenbaum ; “
45367	45368	45348	45348	I	0	” “
45378	45383	45376	45376	Rosy	205	” said his partner . “
45409	45459	45403	45403	I	0	” The members of the Stock Exchange had edged carefully away from the gleaming blades , the mailed figures , the hard , cruel Eastern faces . But Throgmorton Street is narrow , and the crowd was too thick for them to get away as quickly as they wished . “
45463	45468	45403	45403	I	0	” cried the Queen . “
45473	45478	45403	45403	I	0	” The guards obeyed . “
45485	45498	45403	45403	I	0	” cried Mr Levinstein , cowering in a doorway behind his clerk . “
45503	45508	45403	45403	I	0	” said the clerk . “
45578	45748	45568	45568	I	0	” And , of course , instantly it was ! The entire Stock Exchange rubbed its eyes and went back to close , to over , and either side of seven‐eights , and Trunks , and Kaffirs , and Steel Common , and Contangoes , and Backwardations , Double Options , and all the interesting subjects concerning which they talk in the Street without ceasing . No one said a word about it to anyone else . I think I have explained before that business men do not like it to be known that they have been dreaming in business hours . Especially mad dreams including such dreadful things as hungry people getting dinners , and the destruction of the Stock Exchange . The children were in the dining‐room at 300 , Fitzroy Street , pale and trembling . The Psammead crawled out of the embroidered bag , and lay flat on the table , its leg stretched out , looking more like a dead hare than anything else . “
45755	45764	45568	45568	I	0	” said Anthea , drawing a deep breath . “
45774	45779	45772	45772	she	1213	” asked Jane tremulously . “
45782	45786	45772	45772	she	1213	” said Cyril . “
45817	45818	45842	45842	Panther	162	” “
45827	45831	45842	45842	Panther	162	” said Robert . “
45855	45856	45842	45842	Panther	162	” “
45862	45881	45859	45859	your	1216	” said Anthea politely , following the sound of her knock into the presence of the learned gentleman , “
45899	45900	45892	45892	you	1216	” “
45903	45915	45892	45892	you	1216	” said he , looking kindly at her through his spectacles . “
45991	45995	45996	45996	I	0	” He sighed . “
46005	46374	45996	45996	I	0	” he said smiling . He was really learning to smile quite nicely . Anthea could not be too thankful that the Psammead was not there to grant his wish . YOU will understand that the adventure of the Babylonian queen in London was the only one that had occupied any time at all . But the children ’s time was very fully taken up by talking over all the wonderful things seen and done in the Past , where , by the power of the Amulet , they seemed to spend hours and hours , only to find when they got back to London that the whole thing had been briefer than a lightning flash . They talked of the Past at their meals , in their walks , in the dining‐room , in the first‐floor drawing‐room , but most of all on the stairs . It was an old house ; it had once been a fashionable one , and was a fine one still . The banister rails of the stairs were excellent for sliding down , and in the corners of the landings were big alcoves that had once held graceful statues , and now quite often held the graceful forms of Cyril , Robert , Anthea , and Jane . One day Cyril and Robert in tight white underclothing had spent a pleasant hour in reproducing the attitudes of statues seen either in the British Museum , or in Father ’s big photograph book . But the show ended abruptly because Robert wanted to be the Venus of Milo , and for this purpose pulled at the sheet which served for drapery at the very moment when Cyril , looking really quite like the Discobolos — with a gold and white saucer for the disc — was standing on one foot , and under that one foot was the sheet . Of course the Discobolos and his disc and the would‐be Venus came down together , and every one was a good deal hurt , especially the saucer , which would never be the same again , however neatly one might join its uneven bits with seccotine or the white of an egg . “
46381	46395	46377	46377	you	1220	” said Cyril , holding his head where a large lump was rising . “
46400	46421	46422	46422	I	0	” said Robert bitterly . His thumb had caught in the banisters and bent itself back almost to breaking point . “
46432	46436	46430	46430	Squirrel	215	” said Anthea ; “
46484	46485	46477	46477	I	0	” “
46489	46557	46477	46477	I	0	” said Robert disagreeably . But he went . When he came back Cyril ’s head had been bandaged by his sisters , and he had been brought to the state of mind where he was able reluctantly to admit that he supposed Robert had n’t done it on purpose . Robert replying with equal suavity , Anthea hastened to lead the talk away from the accident . “
46571	46575	46560	46560	you	161	” she said . “
46578	46583	46584	46584	I	0	” said Jane promptly . “
46592	46593	46595	46595	me	0	” “
46600	46604	46595	46595	me	0	” said Cyril . “
46620	46642	46595	46595	me	0	” It was indeed , hot , even on the second landing , which was the coolest place in the house . “
46651	46652	46653	46653	I	0	” “
46686	46690	46691	46691	I	0	” said Robert . “
46694	46698	46691	46691	I	0	” said Jane , “
46723	46783	46709	46709	It	1224	” The Psammead was brought up in its green silk embroidered bag , but before it could be asked anything the door of the learned gentleman ’s room opened and the voice of the visitor who had been lunching with him was heard on the stairs . He seemed to be speaking with the door handle in his hand . “
46792	46796	46786	46787	a doctor	3135	” he said ; “
46819	46820	46821	46821	I	0	” “
46828	46834	46835	46835	I	0	” said the learned gentleman . “
46868	46869	46870	46870	I	0	” “
46875	46884	46870	46870	I	0	” said the voice of the learned gentleman . “
46892	46926	46927	46927	Hullo	216	” The door was banged , and the visitor came smiling down the stairs — a stout , prosperous , big man . The children had to get up to let him pass . “
46931	46950	46927	46927	Hullo	216	” he said , glancing at the bandages on the head of Cyril and the hand of Robert , “
46956	46957	46927	46927	Hullo	216	” “
46963	46967	46968	46968	I	0	” said Cyril . “
46991	46992	46993	46993	You	0	” “
47002	47007	46993	46993	You	0	” said Jane soothingly . “
47010	47015	46993	46993	You	0	” said the visitor , “
47041	47042	47033	47033	You	0	” “
47046	47051	47033	47033	You	0	” said Cyril doubtfully . “
47058	47069	47077	47077	he	1236	” asked Anthea , made anxious by a sudden thought . “
47084	47085	47077	47077	he	1236	” “
47102	47103	47099	47099	him	1236	” “
47201	47233	47234	47234	I	0	” He went down the stairs three at a time , and Jane remarked that he was a nice man , and she thought he had little girls of his own . “
47244	47259	47234	47234	I	0	” she added pensively . The three elder ones exchanged glances . Cyril nodded . “
47269	47273	47292	47292	he	2353	” he said . “
47287	47291	47292	47292	he	2353	” said Anthea ; “
47312	47313	47292	47292	he	2353	” “
47322	47326	47292	47292	he	2353	” asked Jane . “
47330	47335	47292	47292	he	2353	” said Cyril shortly . “
47345	47346	47347	47347	I	0	” “
47354	47358	47347	47347	I	0	” said Robert , “
47377	47389	47371	47371	I	0	” he added , forestalling the question on Jane ’s lips , “
47417	47418	47419	47419	He	2353	” “
47444	47511	47436	47436	he	2353	” said Anthea . This was how it was that the learned gentleman , permitting himself a few moments of relaxation in his chair , after the fatigue of listening to opinions ( about Atlantis and many other things ) with which he did not at all agree , opened his eyes to find his four young friends standing in front of him in a row . “
47516	47520	47513	47513	you	1243	” said Anthea , “
47526	47527	47513	47513	you	1243	” “
47544	47549	47513	47513	you	1243	” he told himself ; “
47567	47573	47575	47575	you	1243	” So he said aloud : “
47591	47592	47580	47580	I	0	” “
47600	47604	47513	47513	you	1243	” said Cyril ; “
47631	47632	47575	47575	you	1243	” “
47636	47677	47575	47575	you	1243	” said the learned gentleman , now quite certain that he was dreaming . Anthea held out her soft , pink hand . He took it . She pulled him gently to his feet . Jane held up the Amulet . “
47683	47695	47696	47696	You	1243	” said Cyril , and Jane said the Name of Power . “
47699	47703	47696	47697	You owl	1245	” said Robert , “
47716	47717	47718	47718	I	0	” “
47727	48084	47723	47723	I	0	” said the Psammead , kicking and struggling in its bag . But already the Amulet had grown to a great arch . Cyril pushed the learned gentleman , as undoubtedly the first‐born , through the arch — not into water , but on to a wooden floor , out of doors . The others followed . The Amulet grew smaller again , and there they all were , standing on the deck of a ship whose sailors were busy making her fast with chains to rings on a white quay‐side . The rings and the chains were of a metal that shone red‐yellow like gold . Every one on the ship seemed too busy at first to notice the group of newcomers from Fitzroy Street . Those who seemed to be officers were shouting orders to the men . They stood and looked across the wide quay to the town that rose beyond it . What they saw was the most beautiful sight any of them had ever seen — or ever dreamed of . The blue sea sparkled in soft sunlight ; little white‐capped waves broke softly against the marble breakwaters that guarded the shipping of a great city from the wildness of winter winds and seas . The quay was of marble , white and sparkling with a veining bright as gold . The city was of marble , red and white . The greater buildings that seemed to be temples and palaces were roofed with what looked like gold and silver , but most of the roofs were of copper that glowed golden‐red on the houses on the hills among which the city stood , and shaded into marvellous tints of green and blue and purple where they had been touched by the salt sea spray and the fumes of the dyeing and smelting works of the lower town . Broad and magnificent flights of marble stairs led up from the quay to a sort of terrace that seemed to run along for miles , and beyond rose the town built on a hill . The learned gentleman drew a long breath . “
48087	48091	47723	47723	I	0	” he said , “
48094	48095	48096	48096	I	0	” “
48104	48108	48109	48109	He	217	” said Robert . “
48112	48120	48109	48109	He	217	” said Anthea , with gentle politeness , “
48137	48138	48133	48135	Mr De Something	218	” “
48149	48154	48147	48147	Jimmy	219	” he said timidly . “
48184	48185	48189	48189	Jimmy	219	” “
48191	48212	48189	48189	Jimmy	219	” said Anthea with an effort . It seemed such a cheek to be saying Jimmy to a grown‐up man . “
48217	48272	48213	48213	Jimmy	219	” she added , with no effort at all . Jimmy smiled and looked pleased . But now the ship was made fast , and the Captain had time to notice other things . He came towards them , and he was dressed in the best of all possible dresses for the seafaring life . “
48279	48285	48275	48275	you	217	” he asked rather fiercely . “
48295	48296	48287	48287	you	217	” “
48303	48307	48308	48308	I	0	” said Cyril . “
48332	48338	48339	48339	I	0	” he went on explanatorily . “
48342	48355	48339	48339	I	0	” said the Captain ; no one had expected that he would . “
48381	48389	48390	48391	your slave	1256	” he pointed to the learned gentleman , “
48396	48397	48390	48391	your slave	1256	” “
48402	48406	48407	48407	he	1257	” said Anthea ; “
48463	48464	48454	48455	his friend	1199	” “
48467	48476	48454	48455	his friend	1199	” asked the Captain , fingering a rope , “
48481	48482	48454	48455	his friend	1199	” “
48491	48501	48454	48455	his friend	1199	” she added hastily , remembering the Babylonian writing , “
48505	48523	48454	48455	his friend	1199	” Some sudden impulse of confidence made Jane pluck the Amulet from the neck of her frock . “
48527	48567	48454	48455	his friend	1199	” she said . The Captain looked at it curiously , but , the other three were relieved to notice , without any of that overwhelming interest which the mere name of it had roused in Egypt and Babylon . “
48575	48579	48625	48627	Ji — jimmy	220	” he said ; “
48609	48610	48611	48611	Ji	220	” “
48615	48624	48611	48611	Ji	220	” said Anthea hesitatingly . The Captain repeated , “
48633	48637	48630	48630	you	220	” he added . “
48647	48648	48640	48640	I	0	” “
48652	48656	48640	48640	I	0	” said Robert , “
48663	48664	48658	48659	your King	2792	” “
48670	48675	48665	48666	Our Kings	1270	” said the Captain , “
48706	48707	48683	48683	Poseidon	221	” “
48714	48718	48683	48683	Poseidon	221	” said Robert , “
48737	48738	48720	48720	I	0	” “
48744	48749	48720	48720	I	0	” said the Captain ; “
48766	48767	48760	48760	you	1275	” “
48774	48783	48833	48833	Jimmy	219	” said an old sailor who stood near ; “
48795	48796	48831	48831	him	1277	” “
48800	48827	48831	48831	him	1277	” said the Captain . There was a rather anxious pause ; then the Captain stepped on to the quay , and the others followed him . “
48835	48842	48833	48833	Jimmy	219	” said Anthea as they went ; “
48857	48858	48833	48833	Jimmy	219	” “
48863	48868	48833	48833	Jimmy	219	” he said earnestly . “
48888	48933	48885	48885	he	1277	” No one else could think of anything to say , so that it was in complete silence that they followed the Captain up the marble steps and through the streets of the town . There were streets and shops and houses and markets . “
48940	48944	48885	48885	he	1277	” whispered Jane , “
48951	48952	48885	48885	he	1277	” “
48973	48979	48958	48960	the ten Kings	1279	” Anthea whispered to Cyril . “
48982	48986	48958	48960	the ten Kings	1279	” he said , “
48992	49067	48958	48960	the ten Kings	1279	” There were no horses or chariots in the street , but there were handcarts and low trolleys running on thick log‐wheels , and porters carrying packets on their heads , and a good many of the people were riding on what looked like elephants , only the great beasts were hairy , and they had not that mild expression we are accustomed to meet on the faces of the elephants at the Zoo . “
49070	49112	48958	48960	the ten Kings	1279	” murmured the learned gentleman , and stumbled over a loose stone . The people in the streets kept crowding round them as they went along , but the Captain always dispersed the crowd before it grew uncomfortably thick by saying — “
49129	49183	49119	49121	their High Priest	1282	” And then the people would draw back with a low murmur that sounded like a suppressed cheer . Many of the buildings were covered with gold , but the gold on the bigger buildings was of a different colour , and they had sorts of steeples of burnished silver rising above them . “
49191	49195	49119	49121	their High Priest	1282	” asked Jane . “
49206	49211	49119	49121	their High Priest	1282	” answered the Captain , “
49226	49244	49119	49121	their High Priest	1282	” The learned gentleman , now very pale , stumbled along in a dazed way , repeating : “
49249	49250	49119	49121	their High Priest	1282	” “
49256	49260	49119	49121	their High Priest	1282	” said Anthea ; “
49293	49294	49283	49283	We	1287	” “
49301	49306	49283	49283	We	1287	” he pleaded fervently ; “
49318	49319	49320	49322	The High Ji	220	” “
49333	49347	49324	49324	jimmy	219	” said the Captain , noticing the blundering walk of the learned gentleman ; “
49366	49629	49630	49630	You	1292	” He stopped at the gate of a great enclosure . It seemed to be a sort of park , for trees showed high above its brazen wall . The party waited , and almost at once the Captain came back with one of the hairy elephants and begged them to mount . This they did . It was a glorious ride . The elephant at the Zoo — to ride on him is also glorious , but he goes such a very little way , and then he goes back again , which is always dull . But this great hairy beast went on and on and on along streets and through squares and gardens . It was a glorious city ; almost everything was built of marble , red , or white , or black . Every now and then the party crossed a bridge . It was not till they had climbed to the hill which is the centre of the town that they saw that the whole city was divided into twenty circles , alternately land and water , and over each of the water circles were the bridges by which they had come . And now they were in a great square . A vast building filled up one side of it ; it was overlaid with gold , and had a dome of silver . The rest of the buildings round the square were of oricalchum . And it looked more splendid than you can possibly imagine , standing up bold and shining in the sunlight . “
49636	49652	49630	49630	You	1292	” said the Captain , as the hairy elephant went clumsily down on his knees . “
49700	49712	49687	49687	Poseidon	221	” The children had never before bathed in baths of gold . “
49718	49724	49687	49687	Poseidon	221	” said Cyril , splashing . “
49745	49749	49808	49808	you	219	” said Robert . “
49755	49779	49808	49808	you	219	” The bathing hall had several great pools sunk below the level of the floor ; one went down to them by steps . “
49782	49805	49780	49780	Jimmy	219	” said Anthea timidly , when , very clean and boiled‐looking , they all met in the flowery courtyard of the Public , “
49834	49835	49828	49828	you	219	” “
49846	49850	49852	49852	I	0	” said he , “
49866	49871	49863	49864	my dear	533	” he added awkwardly ; “
49892	49893	49895	49895	me	0	” “
49897	49902	49895	49895	me	0	” said the Captain . “
49913	49933	49934	49934	Ginger	223	” He pushed through a little crowd of boys who were playing with dried chestnuts fastened to a string . “
49936	49940	49941	49941	they	1306	” remarked Robert , “
49955	50021	49941	49941	they	1306	” They could see now that three walls surrounded the island on which they were . The outermost wall was of brass , the Captain told them ; the next , which looked like silver , was covered with tin ; and the innermost one was of oricalchum . And right in the middle was a wall of gold , with golden towers and gates . “
50028	50033	50026	50026	Poseidon	221	” said the Captain . “
50050	50079	50043	50043	I	0	” He told them what they ought to say , and the five people from Fitzroy Street took hands and went forward . The golden gates slowly opened . “
50088	50098	50082	50086	the children of the Sun	1310	” said Cyril , as he had been told , “
50124	50125	50114	50114	We	1309	” “
50131	50146	50114	50114	We	1309	” asked a white‐robed man who stood in the doorway with his arms extended . “
50151	50179	50147	50149	Ji — jimmy	220	” replied Cyril , and he hesitated as Anthea had done . It really did seem to be taking a great liberty with so learned a gentleman . “
50201	50206	50187	50188	your Kings	1315	” he whispered anxiously . “
50209	50215	50187	50188	your Kings	1315	” said the learned gentleman . “
50237	50238	50232	50232	they	1315	” “
50247	50251	50239	50242	The Queen of Babylon	2869	” said Cyril ; “
50259	50260	50239	50242	The Queen of Babylon	2869	” “
50267	50288	50239	50242	The Queen of Babylon	2869	” said the learned gentleman . The white‐robed priest had been joined by others , and all were bowing low . “
50291	50295	50239	50242	The Queen of Babylon	2869	” he said , “
50310	50381	50382	50384	The ten Kings	1279	” In an inner courtyard stood the Temple — all of silver , with gold pinnacles and doors , and twenty enormous statues in bright gold of men and women . Also an immense pillar of the other precious yellow metal . They went through the doors , and the priest led them up a stair into a gallery from which they could look down on to the glorious place . “
50401	50637	50639	50639	him	1320	” said the priest , and fell face downward on the floor outside the gallery . The children looked down . The roof was of ivory adorned with the three precious metals , and the walls were lined with the favourite oricalchum . At the far end of the Temple was a statue‐group , the like of which no one living has ever seen . It was of gold , and the head of the chief figure reached to the roof . That figure was Poseidon , the Father of the City . He stood in a great chariot drawn by six enormous horses , and round about it were a hundred mermaids riding on dolphins . Ten men , splendidly dressed and armed only with sticks and ropes , were trying to capture one of some fifteen bulls who ran this way and that about the floor of the Temple . The children held their breath , for the bulls looked dangerous , and the great horned heads were swinging more and more wildly . Anthea did not like looking at the bulls . She looked about the gallery , and noticed that another staircase led up from it to a still higher story ; also that a door led out into the open air , where there seemed to be a balcony . So that when a shout went up and Robert whispered , “
50641	50695	50639	50639	him	1320	” and she looked down and saw the herd of bulls being driven out of the Temple by whips , and the ten Kings following , one of them spurring with his stick a black bull that writhed and fought in the grip of a lasso , she answered the boy ’s agitated , “
50704	50707	50697	50697	we	1321	” with — “
50718	50732	50733	50733	I	0	” So they crowded out . But very soon the girls crept back . “
50739	50783	50733	50733	I	0	” Jane said . So she and Anthea went and talked to the priest , who was no longer lying on his face , but sitting on the top step mopping his forehead with his robe , for it was a hot day . “
50790	50794	50733	50733	I	0	” he said ; “
50903	50904	50879	50879	his	1326	” “
50910	50915	50919	50920	the Lemmings	224	” asked Jane kindly . “
50922	50923	50919	50920	the Lemmings	224	” “
50930	50931	50932	50932	They	224	” “
51018	51019	51011	51011	they	224	” “
51027	51041	51022	51022	you	0	” asked the Psammead , suddenly putting its head out of its bag . “
51044	51049	51022	51022	you	0	” said the priest . “
51077	51082	51088	51089	The prospect	1339	you”—it turned to Anthea ; “
51097	51115	51088	51089	The prospect	1339	” The girls obediently went to find their brothers , who were leaning on the balcony railings . “
51122	51126	51118	51120	the learned gentleman	2353	” asked Anthea . “
51133	51144	51128	51128	he	2353	” said the priest , who had come with them . “
51155	51219	51152	51153	the Kings	225	” The ten Kings were no longer alone . The learned gentleman — no one had noticed how he got there — stood with them on the steps of an altar , on which lay the dead body of the black bull . All the rest of the courtyard was thick with people , seemingly of all classes , and all were shouting , “
51226	51227	51152	51153	the Kings	225	” “
51231	51247	51152	51153	the Kings	225	” said the most kingly of the Kings , he who had lassoed the bull . “
51263	51264	51265	51265	I	0	” “
51271	51276	51265	51265	I	0	” whined the Psammead . “
51284	51289	51290	51290	Jimmy	219	” said Anthea firmly . “
51292	51296	51297	51297	Jimmy	219	” she called , “
51299	51346	51297	51297	Jimmy	219	” and waved to him . He heard her , and began to come towards her through the crowd . They could see from the balcony the sea‐captain edging his way out from among the people . And his face was dead white , like paper . “
51351	51451	51297	51297	Jimmy	219	” he cried in a loud and terrible voice . And above his voice came another voice , louder , more terrible — the voice of the sea . The girls looked seaward . Across the smooth distance of the sea something huge and black rolled towards the town . It was a wave , but a wave a hundred feet in height , a wave that looked like a mountain — a wave rising higher and higher till suddenly it seemed to break in two — one half of it rushed out to sea again ; the other — “
51454	51458	51290	51290	Jimmy	219	” cried Anthea , “
51466	51467	51290	51290	Jimmy	219	” “
51478	51593	51594	51594	I	0	” said Robert but his voice trembled . They hid their eyes for a moment . They could not bear to look down , for the wave had broken on the face of the town , sweeping over the quays and docks , overwhelming the great storehouses and factories , tearing gigantic stones from forts and bridges , and using them as battering rams against the temples . Great ships were swept over the roofs of the houses and dashed down half‐way up the hill among ruined gardens and broken buildings . The water ground brown fishing‐boats to powder on the golden roofs of Palaces . Then the wave swept back towards the sea . “
51600	51606	51594	51594	I	0	” cried the Psammead fiercely . “
51613	51645	51646	51646	I	0	” said Jane , and the boys were ready — but the learned gentleman had not come . Then suddenly they heard him dash up to the inner gallery , crying — “
51655	51720	51646	51646	I	0	” He rushed up the higher flight . The others followed him . They found themselves in a sort of turret — roofed , but open to the air at the sides . The learned gentleman was leaning on the parapet , and as they rejoined him the vast wave rushed back on the town . This time it rose higher — destroyed more . “
51724	51729	51805	51805	Jimmy	219	” cried the Psammead ; “
51748	51757	51805	51805	Jimmy	219	” It pointed with a claw that trembled . “
51762	51771	51805	51805	Jimmy	219	” cried Jane , holding up the Amulet . “
51781	51787	51772	51772	I	0	” cried the learned gentleman . “
51798	51802	51788	51788	You	1353	” said Cyril . “
51807	51811	51805	51805	Jimmy	219	” appealed Anthea . “
51820	51821	51812	51812	I	0	” “
51835	51840	51841	51841	I	0	” said the Psammead . “
51850	51990	51841	51841	I	0	” said the learned gentleman obstinately . The hills around were black with people fleeing from the villages to the mountains . And even as they fled thin smoke broke from the great white peak , and then a faint flash of flame . Then the volcano began to throw up its mysterious fiery inside parts . The earth trembled ; ashes and sulphur showered down ; a rain of fine pumice‐stone fell like snow on all the dry land . The elephants from the forest rushed up towards the peaks ; great lizards thirty yards long broke from the mountain pools and rushed down towards the sea . The snows melted and rushed down , first in avalanches , then in roaring torrents . Great rocks cast up by the volcano fell splashing in the sea miles away . “
51997	52001	51841	51841	I	0	” cried Anthea . “
52008	52009	51841	51841	I	0	” “
52016	52022	51841	51841	I	0	” gasped the learned gentleman . “
52028	52077	51841	51841	I	0	” cried the Psammead suddenly . The place where they stood was now crowded with men and women , and the children were strained tight against the parapet . The turret rocked and swayed ; the wave had reached the golden wall . Jane held up the Amulet . “
52080	52085	51841	51841	I	0	” cried the Psammead , “
52090	52168	51841	51841	I	0	” And as Jane said it the Psammead leaped from its bag and bit the hand of the learned gentleman . At the same moment the boys pushed him through the arch and all followed him . He turned to look back , and through the arch he saw nothing but a waste of waters , with above it the peak of the terrible mountain with fire raging from it . He staggered back to his chair . “
52174	52178	51841	51841	I	0	” he gasped . “
52198	52199	52192	52192	I	0	” “
52206	52211	52200	52200	You	1356	” said Anthea gently ; “
52218	52243	52213	52213	me	0	” The hand was indeed bleeding rather badly . The Psammead had crept back to its bag . All the children were very white . “
52247	52254	52256	52256	I	0	” said the Psammead later on , “
52281	52282	52266	52266	I	0	” “
52291	52297	52283	52283	We	1360	” said Anthea later still . “
52343	52344	52336	52336	I	0	” “
52350	52362	52345	52345	I	0	” said Anthea , and her voice was still rather shaky . “
52368	52369	52370	52370	You	1356	” “
52375	52382	52370	52370	You	1356	” said the Psammead very sulkily . “
52402	52403	52383	52383	I	0	” “
52420	52428	52430	52430	he	1363	” said Cyril very much later indeed . “
52432	52437	52430	52430	he	1363	” said Robert sleepily . “
52467	52609	52454	52454	he	226	” Robert was quite right on both points . The learned gentleman did . And he never did . A GREAT City swept away by the sea , a beautiful country devastated by an active volcano — these are not the sort of things you see every day of the week . And when you do see them , no matter how many other wonders you may have seen in your time , such sights are rather apt to take your breath away . Atlantis had certainly this effect on the breaths of Cyril , Robert , Anthea , and Jane . They remained in a breathless state for some days . The learned gentleman seemed as breathless as anyone ; he spent a good deal of what little breath he had in telling Anthea about a wonderful dream he had . “
52615	52619	52610	52610	You	1365	” he said , “
52629	52692	52454	52454	he	226	” But Anthea could believe it , she said , quite easily . He had ceased to talk about thought‐transference . He had now seen too many wonders to believe that . In consequence of their breathless condition none of the children suggested any new excursions through the Amulet . Robert voiced the mood of the others when he said that they were “
52695	53033	52454	52454	he	226	” with Amulet for a bit . They undoubtedly were . As for the Psammead , it went to sand and stayed there , worn out by the terror of the flood and the violent exercise it had had to take in obedience to the inconsiderate wishes of the learned gentleman and the Babylonian queen . The children let it sleep . The danger of taking it about among strange people who might at any moment utter undesirable wishes was becoming more and more plain . And there are pleasant things to be done in London without any aid from Amulets or Psammeads . You can , for instance visit the Tower of London , the Houses of Parliament , the National Gallery , the Zoological Gardens , the various Parks , the Museums at South Kensington , Madame Tussaud ’s Exhibition of Waxworks , or the Botanical Gardens at Kew . You can go to Kew by a river steamer — and this is the way that the children would have gone if they had gone at all . Only they never did , because it was when they were discussing the arrangements for the journey , and what they should take with them to eat and how much of it , and what the whole thing would cost , that the adventure of the Little Black Girl began to happen . The children were sitting on a seat in St. James ’s Park . They had been watching the pelican repulsing with careful dignity the advances of the seagulls who are always so anxious to play games with it . The pelican thinks , very properly , that it has n’t the figure for games , so it spends most of its time pretending that that is not the reason why it wo n’t play . The breathlessness caused by Atlantis was wearing off a little . Cyril , who always wanted to understand all about everything , was turning things over in his mind . “
53043	53057	53038	53038	I	0	” he answered when Robert asked him what he was so grumpy about . “
53070	53071	53058	53058	I	0	” “
53086	53090	53078	53078	I	0	” said Jane . “
53096	53101	53091	53091	Nobody	2255	” retorted Cyril mildly , “
53123	53124	53125	53125	I	0	” “
53133	53142	53125	53125	I	0	” said Robert ; and the girls laughed . “
53147	53151	53125	53125	I	0	” said Cyril , “
53158	53159	53162	53162	he	1370	” “
53167	53171	53162	53162	he	1370	” said Anthea . “
53185	53190	53177	53177	Squirrel	215	” said Robert kindly . “
53196	53200	53162	53162	he	1370	” said Cyril , “
53207	53208	53205	53205	Kew	82	” “
53217	53222	53205	53205	Kew	82	” said Anthea hastily , “
53248	53268	53269	53269	they	1373	” All disagreeableness was swept away in a pleasant tide of recollections , and ’ Do you remember ... ? ”
53272	53278	53269	53269	they	1373	“ Have you forgotten ... ? ”
53279	53283	53285	53285	Cyril	131	“ My hat ! ”
53297	53304	53285	53285	Cyril	131	“ we have had some times . ”
53305	53310	53312	53312	Robert	132	“ We have that , ”
53314	53323	53325	53325	Jane	134	“ Do n’t let ’s have any more , ”
53328	53337	53338	53338	Cyril	131	“ That ’s what I was thinking about , ”
53456	53461	53463	53463	Anthea	133	“ Oh , dear ! ”
53468	53474	53475	53475	She	133	“ Whatever is the matter ? ”
53492	53498	53500	53502	the little girl	1381	“ You leave me be , ”
53504	53513	53500	53502	the little girl	1381	“ I ai n’t doing nothing to you . ”
53514	53520	53521	53521	Anthea	133	“ But what is it ? ”
53524	53532	53521	53521	Anthea	133	“ Has some one been hurting you ? ”
53533	53540	53542	53544	the little girl	1381	“ What ’s that to you ? ”
53547	53553	53542	53544	the little girl	1381	“ You ’re all right . ”
53554	53558	53560	53560	Robert	132	“ Come away , ”
53568	53578	53560	53560	Robert	132	“ She ’s a nasty , rude little kid . ”
53579	53584	53586	53586	Anthea	133	“ Oh , no , ”
53588	53599	53600	53600	she	133	“ She ’s only dreadfully unhappy . What is it ? ”
53604	53612	53613	53614	the child	1384	“ Oh , you ’re all right , ”
53617	53627	53613	53614	the child	1384	“ you ai n’t agoin ’ to the Union . ”
53628	53636	53638	53638	Anthea	133	“ Ca n’t we take you home ? ”
53644	53651	53641	53641	Jane	134	“ Where does your mother live ? ”
53652	53666	53668	53670	the little girl	1381	“ She do n’t live nowheres — she ’s dead — so now ! ”
53747	53763	53764	53764	she	133	“ Oh , do n’t cry so , dear , do n’t , do n’t ! ”
53780	53801	53764	53764	she	133	“ Tell Anthea all about it ; Anthea’ll help you . There , there , dear , do n’t cry . ”
53845	53850	53851	53851	she	133	“ It ’s horrible ! ”
53858	53974	53851	53851	she	133	“ her father was a carpenter and he was a steady man , and never touched a drop except on a Saturday , and he came up to London for work , and there was n’t any , and then he died ; and her name is Imogen , and she ’s nine come next November . And now her mother ’s dead , and she ’s to stay tonight with Mrs Shrobsall — that ’s a landlady that ’s been kind — and tomorrow the Relieving Officer is coming for her , and she ’s going into the Union ; that means the Workhouse . It ’s too terrible . What can we do ? ”
53975	53983	53985	53985	Jane	134	“ Let ’s ask the learned gentleman , ”
54131	54140	54141	54141	Cyril	131	“ It really does seem rather rough luck , ”
54144	54182	54141	54141	Cyril	131	“ because I ’ve often heard about rich people who wanted children most awfully — though I know I never should — but they do . There must be somebody who ’d be glad to have her . ”
54183	54191	54192	54192	Robert	132	“ Gipsies are awfully fond of children , ”
54196	54209	54192	54192	Robert	132	“ They ’re always stealing them . Perhaps they ’d have her . ”
54210	54220	54221	54221	Jane	134	“ She ’s quite a nice little girl really , ”
54224	54251	54221	54221	Jane	134	“ she was only rude at first because we looked jolly and happy , and she was n’t . You understand that , do n’t you ? ”
54252	54255	54257	54257	he	132	“ Yes , ”
54268	54290	54291	54291	He	132	“ I understand that very well . As you say , there must be some home where she would be welcome . ”
54376	54381	54383	54385	the black child	1404	“ What is it ? ”
54387	54399	54383	54385	the black child	1404	“ Is it a cat or a organ‐monkey , or what ? ”
54409	54428	54404	54406	the learned gentleman	2353	“ Yes , I wish we could find a home where they would be glad to have her , ”
54472	54480	54481	54481	she	133	“ At least let ’s keep together , ”
54484	54491	54481	54481	she	133	“ All hold hands — quick ! ”
54541	54547	54549	54551	the learned gentleman	2353	“ Is it a game ? ”
54813	54820	54808	54810	the learned gentleman	2353	“ Another dream , dear me ! ”
54847	54852	54844	54844	she	232	“ Oh , my ! ”
54862	54867	54868	54868	Cyril	131	“ Where are we ? ”
54873	54877	54879	54880	the Psammead	136	“ In Britain , ”
54882	54886	54888	54888	Anthea	133	“ But when ? ”
54891	54904	54906	54907	the Psammead	136	“ About the year fifty‐five before the year you reckon time from , ”
54910	54920	54921	54921	it	136	“ Is there anything else you want to know ? ”
54950	54963	54921	54921	it	136	“ I ’ve been here before — it ’s very little changed . ”
54964	54971	54973	54973	Anthea	133	“ Yes , but why here ? ”
54975	54980	54981	54982	the Psammead	400	“ Your inconsiderate friend , ”
54985	55054	54981	54982	the Psammead	400	“ wished to find some home where they would be glad to have that unattractive and immature female human being whom you have picked up — gracious knows how . In Megatherium days properly brought‐up children did n’t talk to shabby strangers in parks . Your thoughtless friend wanted a place where some one would be glad to have this undesirable stranger . And now here you are ! ”
55055	55061	55063	55063	Anthea	133	“ I see we are , ”
55076	55084	55063	55063	Anthea	133	“ But why here ? Why now ? ”
55085	55105	55107	55108	the Psammead	136	“ You do n’t suppose anyone would want a child like that in your times — in your towns ? ”
55113	55140	55107	55108	the Psammead	136	“ You ’ve got your country into such a mess that there ’s no room for half your children — and no one to want them . ”
55141	55151	55153	55153	Anthea	133	“ That ’s not our doing , you know , ”
55156	55167	55169	55170	the Psammead	136	“ And bringing me here without any waterproof or anything , ”
55175	55188	55169	55170	the Psammead	136	“ when every one knows how damp and foggy Ancient Britain was . ”
55189	55196	55198	55198	Robert	132	“ Here , take my coat , ”
55232	55235	55236	55236	she	133	“ There , ”
55240	55267	55236	55236	she	133	“ Now if it does begin to look like rain , I can cover you up in a minute . Now what are we to do ? ”
55292	55308	55285	55285	Imogen	232	“ Ca n’t the organ monkey talk neither ! I thought it was only parrots ! ”
55309	55312	55314	55315	the Psammead	136	“ Do ? ”
55317	55326	55314	55315	the Psammead	136	“ I do n’t care what you do ! ”
55349	55356	55358	55360	the learned gentleman	2353	“ It ’s only a dream , ”
55363	55378	55358	55360	the learned gentleman	2353	“ something is sure to happen if we can prevent ourselves from waking up . ”
55406	55413	55415	55415	Cyril	131	“ Let ’s go and see , ”
55417	55424	55426	55428	the learned gentleman	2353	“ It ’s only a dream , ”
55436	55460	55430	55430	Jane	134	“ if you do n’t go with the tide of a dream — if you resist — you wake up , you know . ”
55531	55540	55542	55542	Anthea	133	“ It ’s like the old Egyptian town , ”
55669	55681	55683	55683	Anthea	133	“ None of those little girls is her own little girl , ”
55696	55699	55700	55700	she	1448	“ Look , ”
55703	55763	55700	55700	she	1448	“ that one there — she ’s precious like mother ; mother ’s ’ air was somethink lovely , when she ’ ad time to comb it out . Mother would n’t never a‐beat me if she ’d lived ’ ere — I do n’t suppose there ’s e’er a public nearer than Epping , do you , Miss ? ”
55811	55814	55815	55815	she	1451	“ Imogen ! ”
55829	55831	55815	55815	she	1451	word—“Imogen ! ”
55856	55866	55868	55868	Imogen‐from‐London	234	“ Oh , it is mother — it is ! ”
55907	55913	55915	55916	the woman	613	“ It is my Imogen ! ”
55918	55961	55915	55916	the woman	613	“ Oh it is ! And she was n’t eaten by wolves . She ’s come back to me . Tell me , my darling , how did you escape ? Where have you been ? Who has fed and clothed you ? ”
55962	55969	55971	55971	Imogen	232	“ I do n’t know nothink , ”
55973	55977	55979	55983	the women who crowded round	1460	“ Poor child ! ”
55985	55996	55979	55983	the women who crowded round	1460	“ the terror of the wolves has turned her brain . ”
55997	56003	56005	56007	the fair‐haired woman	1461	“ But you know me ? ”
56023	56037	56010	56010	Imogen	232	“ Oh , yes , mother , I know you right ’ nough . ”
56038	56048	56049	56051	the learned gentleman	2353	“ What is it ? What do they say ? ”
56055	56067	56069	56070	the Psammead	136	“ You wished to come where some one wanted the child , ”
56072	56081	56069	56070	the Psammead	136	“ The child says this is her mother . ”
56082	56087	56010	56010	Imogen	232	“ And the mother ? ”
56088	56093	56095	56096	the Psammead	136	“ You can see , ”
56098	56110	56095	56096	the Psammead	136	“ But is she really ? Her child , I mean ? ”
56111	56115	56117	56118	the Psammead	136	“ Who knows ? ”
56120	56138	56117	56118	the Psammead	136	“ but each one fills the empty place in the other ’s heart . It is enough . ”
56139	56142	56144	56146	the learned gentleman	2353	“ Oh , ”
56148	56165	56144	56146	the learned gentleman	2353	“ this is a good dream . I wish the child might stay in the dream . ”
56192	56203	56205	56207	the learned gentleman	2353	“ If only all the children that no one wants , ”
56219	56224	56225	56225	she	613	“ Welcome , all ! ”
56228	56289	56225	56225	she	613	“ I am the Queen , and my child tells me that you have befriended her ; and this I well believe , looking on your faces . Your garb is strange , but faces I can read . The child is bewitched , I see that well , but in this she speaks truth . Is it not so ? ”
56379	56391	56393	56395	the learned gentleman	2353	“ I think you children have some wonderful influence on me , ”
56397	56408	56393	56395	the learned gentleman	2353	“ I never dreamed such dreams before I knew you . ”
56440	56443	56444	56444	he	131	“ Well , ”
56447	56475	56444	56444	he	131	“ we ’ve made it all right for Imogen , and had a jolly good time . I vote we get home again before the fighting begins . ”
56476	56480	56482	56482	Jane	134	“ What fighting ? ”
56485	56495	56497	56499	her kind brother	1478	“ Why , Julius Cæsar , you little goat , ”
56501	56522	56444	56444	he	131	“ Do n’t you see that if this is the year fifty‐five , Julius Cæsar may happen at any moment . ”
56523	56530	56532	56532	Robert	132	“ I thought you liked Cæsar , ”
56534	56554	56532	56532	Robert	132	“ So I do — in the history . But that ’s different from being killed by his soldiers . ”
56555	56567	56569	56569	Anthea	133	“ If we saw Cæsar we might persuade him not to , ”
56571	56576	56569	56569	Anthea	133	“ You persuade Cæsar , ”
56592	56603	56580	56582	The learned gentleman	2353	“ I only wish we could see Cæsar some time . ”
56838	56841	56842	56842	he	236	“ Back ! ”
56852	56862	56842	56842	he	236	“ Since when has Cæsar feared children and students ? ”
56915	56924	56912	56912	he	236	“ It is a dream , O Cæsar . ”
56925	56929	56931	56931	Cæsar	236	“ A dream ? ”
56933	56939	56931	56931	Cæsar	236	“ What is a dream ? ”
56940	56943	56945	56947	the learned gentleman	2353	“ This , ”
56949	56953	56955	56955	Cyril	131	“ Not it , ”
56957	56975	56955	56955	Cyril	131	“ it ’s a sort of magic . We come out of another time and another place . ”
56976	56990	56992	56992	Anthea	133	“ And we want to ask you not to trouble about conquering Britain , ”
56994	57007	56992	56992	Anthea	133	“ it ’s a poor little place , not worth bothering about . ”
57008	57014	56955	56955	Cyril	131	“ Are you from Britain ? ”
57019	57057	57015	57016	the General	2343	“ Your clothes are uncouth , but well woven , and your hair is short as the hair of Roman citizens , not long like the hair of barbarians , yet such I deem you to be . ”
57058	57063	57065	57065	Jane	134	“ We ’re not , ”
57070	57125	57065	57065	Jane	134	“ we ’re not barbarians at all . We come from the country where the sun never sets , and we ’ve read about you in books ; and our country ’s full of fine things — St Paul ’s , and the Tower of London , and Madame Tussaud ’s Exhibition , and — ”
57132	57138	57140	57140	Robert	132	“ Do n’t talk nonsense , ”
57172	57209	57168	57168	he	236	“ You three elder children may go where you will within the camp . Few children are privileged to see the camp of Cæsar . The student and the smaller girl‐child will remain here with me . ”
57342	57350	57352	57353	the General	2343	“ And do they fight with swords ? ”
57355	57364	57352	57353	the General	2343	“ Yes , swords and guns and cannons . ”
57373	57378	57380	57380	Jane	134	“ You fire them , ”
57382	57394	57380	57380	Jane	134	“ and they go bang , and people fall down dead . ”
57395	57402	57403	57403	Jane	134	“ But what are guns like ? ”
57410	57421	57422	57422	she	134	“ But Robert has a toy one in his pocket , ”
57471	57480	57482	57482	Cæsar	236	“ I shall cause guns to be made , ”
57484	57529	57482	57482	Cæsar	236	“ and you will be detained till I know whether you have spoken the truth . I had just decided that Britain was not worth the bother of invading . But what you tell me decides me that it is very much worth while . ”
57530	57537	57539	57539	Anthea	133	“ But it ’s all nonsense , ”
57541	57634	57539	57539	Anthea	133	“ Britain is just a savage sort of island — all fogs and trees and big rivers . But the people are kind . We know a little girl there named Imogen . And it ’s no use your making guns because you ca n’t fire them without gunpowder , and that wo n’t be invented for hundreds of years , and we do n’t know how to make it , and we ca n’t tell you . Do go straight home , dear Cæsar , and let poor little Britain alone . ”
57635	57642	57644	57644	Cæsar	236	“ But this other girl‐child says — ”
57646	57661	57644	57644	Cæsar	236	“ All Jane ’s been telling you is what it ’s going to be , ”
57665	57674	57662	57662	Anthea	133	“ hundreds and hundreds of years from now . ”
57675	57685	57687	57687	Cæsar	236	“ The little one is a prophetess , eh ? ”
57694	57705	57687	57687	Cæsar	236	“ Rather young for the business , is n’t she ? ”
57706	57717	57719	57719	Cyril	131	“ You can call her a prophetess if you like , ”
57721	57729	57719	57719	Cyril	131	“ but what Anthea says is true . ”
57730	57733	57735	57735	Cæsar	236	“ Anthea ? ”
57737	57744	57735	57735	Cæsar	236	“ That ’s a Greek name . ”
57745	57749	57751	57751	Cyril	131	“ Very likely , ”
57755	57783	57751	57751	Cyril	131	“ I say , I do wish you ’d give up this idea of conquering Britain . It ’s not worth while , really it is n’t ! ”
57784	57789	57791	57791	Cæsar	236	“ On the contrary , ”
57793	57824	57791	57791	Cæsar	236	“ what you ’ve told me has decided me to go , if it ’s only to find out what Britain is really like . Guards , detain these children . ”
57825	57828	57830	57830	Robert	132	“ Quick , ”
57832	57847	57830	57830	Robert	132	“ before the guards begin detaining . We had enough of that in Babylon . ”
57968	57971	57973	57973	Cæsar	236	“ Marcus , ”
57975	58091	57973	57973	Cæsar	236	“ I have dreamed a very wonderful dream . Some of it I forget , but I remember enough to decide what was not before determined . Tomorrow the ships that have been brought round from the Ligeris shall be provisioned . We shall sail for this three‐cornered island . First , we will take but two legions . This , if what we have heard be true , should suffice . But if my dream be true , then a hundred legions will not suffice . For the dream I dreamed was the most wonderful that ever tormented the brain even of Cæsar . And Cæsar has dreamed some strange things in his time . ”
58092	58115	58117	58117	Robert	132	“ And if you had n’t told Cæsar all that about how things are now , he ’d never have invaded Britain , ”
58127	58132	58134	58134	Anthea	133	“ Oh , nonsense , ”
58139	58149	58134	58134	Anthea	133	“ it was all settled hundreds of years ago . ”
58150	58156	58158	58158	Cyril	131	“ I do n’t know , ”
58160	58186	58158	58158	Cyril	131	“ Jam , please . This about time being only a thingummy of thought is very confusIng . If everything happens at the same time — ”
58187	58192	58194	58194	Anthea	133	“ It ca n’t ! ”
58197	58210	58194	58194	Anthea	133	“ the present ’s the present and the past ’s the past . ”
58211	58215	58217	58217	Cyril	131	“ Not always , ”
58219	58235	58236	58236	he	132	“ When we were in the Past the present was the future . Now then ! ”
58247	58259	58261	58261	Robert	132	“ I should have liked to see more of the camp , ”
58263	58285	58287	58287	Anthea	133	“ Yes , we did n’t get much for our money — but Imogen is happy , that ’s one thing , ”
58289	58321	58287	58287	Anthea	133	“ We left her happy in the Past . I ’ve often seen about people being happy in the Past , in poetry books . I see what it means now . ”
58322	58330	58332	58333	the Psammead	136	“ It ’s not a bad idea , ”
58350	58357	58332	58333	the Psammead	136	“ being left in the Past . ”
58448	58451	58452	58452	he	131	“ Hullo ! ”
58459	58478	58452	58452	he	131	“ what ’s up now ? Dinner’ll be cold before you ’ve got enough salt‐water for a bath . ”
58479	58483	58485	58485	Anthea	133	“ Go away , ”
58488	58497	58485	58485	Anthea	133	“ I hate you ! I hate everybody ! ”
58504	58510	58512	58512	Cyril	131	“ I did n’t know , ”
58515	58522	58524	58524	Anthea	133	“ Nobody ever does know anything , ”
58526	58553	58554	58554	Cyril	131	“ I did n’t know you were waxy . I thought you ’d just hurt your fingers with the tap again like you did last week , ”
58558	58563	58554	58554	Cyril	131	“ Oh — fingers ! ”
58570	58578	58579	58579	he	131	“ Here , drop it , Panther , ”
58583	58594	58579	58579	he	131	“ You have n’t been having a row or anything ? ”
58595	58598	58599	58599	she	133	“ No , ”
58602	58624	58599	58599	she	133	“ Wash your horrid hands , for goodness ’ sake , if that ’s what you came for , or go . ”
58665	58671	58672	58672	he	131	“ Dry up , do , ”
58717	58720	58721	58721	he	131	“ There ! ”
58738	58745	58721	58721	he	131	“ Now , what ’s up ? ”
58746	58753	58711	58711	his	131	“ Promise you wo n’t laugh ? ”
58754	58762	58764	58764	Cyril	131	“ I do n’t feel laughish myself , ”
58768	58773	58775	58775	Anthea	133	“ Well , then , ”
58784	58789	58775	58775	Anthea	133	“ it ’s Mother . ”
58790	58798	58800	58800	Cyril	131	“ What ’s the matter with Mother ? ”
58808	58819	58800	58800	Cyril	131	“ she was all right in her letter this morning . ”
58820	58829	58847	58847	his	131	“ Yes ; but I want her so . ”
58830	58838	58840	58840	Cyril	131	“ You ’re not the only one , ”
58854	58859	58861	58861	Anthea	133	“ Oh , yes , ”
58863	58957	58958	58958	Cyril	131	“ I know . We all want her all the time . But I want her now most dreadfully , awfully much . I never wanted anything so much . That Imogen child — the way the ancient British Queen cuddled her up ! And Imogen was n’t me , and the Queen was n’t Mother . And then her letter this morning ! And about The Lamb liking the salt bathing ! And she bathed him in this very bath the night before she went away — oh , oh , oh ! ”
58965	58969	58970	58970	he	131	“ Cheer up , ”
58973	59049	58970	58970	he	131	“ You know my inside thinking that I was doing ? Well , that was partly about Mother . We ’ll soon get her back . If you ’ll chuck it , like a sensible kid , and wash your face , I ’ll tell you about it . That ’s right . You let me get to the tap . Ca n’t you stop crying ? Shall I put the door‐key down your back ? ”
59050	59056	59058	59058	Anthea	133	“ That ’s for noses , ”
59060	59073	59058	59058	Anthea	133	“ and I ’m not a kid any more than you are , ”
59108	59112	59114	59114	Cyril	131	“ Look here , ”
59133	59201	59114	59114	Cyril	131	“ I ’ve been thinking . We ’ve only just played with the Amulet so far . We ’ve got to work it now — work it for all it ’s worth . And it is n’t only Mother either . There ’s Father out there all among the fighting . I do n’t howl about it , but I think — Oh , bother the soap ! ”
59235	59239	59240	59240	she	133	“ There now , ”
59244	59254	59240	59240	she	133	“ now I shall have to wash my face . ”
59255	59265	59267	59267	Cyril	131	“ You ’d have had to do that anyway , ”
59271	59283	59267	59267	Cyril	131	“ Now , my idea ’s this . You know missionaries ? ”
59284	59287	59289	59289	Anthea	133	“ Yes , ”
59299	59367	59289	59289	Anthea	133	“ Well , they always take the savages beads and brandy , and stays , and hats , and braces , and really useful things — things the savages have n’t got , and never heard about . And the savages love them for their kind generousness , and give them pearls , and shells , and ivory , and cassowaries . And that ’s the way — ”
59368	59373	59375	59375	Anthea	133	“ Wait a sec , ”
59379	59392	59375	59375	Anthea	133	“ I ca n’t hear what you ’re saying . Shells and — ”
59393	59473	59289	59289	Anthea	133	“ Shells , and things like that . The great thing is to get people to love you by being generous . And that ’s what we ’ve got to do . Next time we go into the Past we ’ll regularly fit out the expedition . You remember how the Babylonian Queen froze on to that pocket‐book ? Well , we ’ll take things like that . And offer them in exchange for a sight of the Amulet . ”
59474	59484	59289	59289	Anthea	133	“ A sight of it is not much good . ”
59485	59524	59375	59375	Anthea	133	“ No , silly . But , do n’t you see , when we ’ve seen it we shall know where it is , and we can go and take it in the night when everybody is asleep . ”
59525	59535	59537	59537	Anthea	133	“ It would n’t be stealing , would it ? ”
59540	59564	59537	59537	Anthea	133	“ because it will be such an awfully long time ago when we do it . Oh , there ’s that bell again . ”
59661	59672	59673	59673	it	136	“ I ’m not allowed to play in this game , ”
59676	59740	59673	59673	it	136	“ Of course I could find out in a minute where the thing was , only I may n’t . But I may go so far as to own that your idea of taking things with you is n’t a bad one . And I should n’t show them all at once . Take small things and conceal them craftily about your persons . ”
59881	59894	59895	59895	he	132	“ I do n’t suppose they ever saw a self‐fitting paraffin one , ”
59958	59967	59969	59969	Robert	132	“ We ca n’t take all this rubbish , ”
59975	59984	59969	59969	Robert	132	“ We must just each choose one thing . ”
60021	60044	60018	60018	Cyril	131	“ Look here , let ’s each be blindfolded and reach out , and the first thing you touch you stick to . ”
60070	60076	60077	60077	she	134	“ It ’s not much , ”
60080	60090	60077	60077	she	134	“ I do n’t believe Ancient Egyptians wore ties . ”
60091	60095	60097	60097	Anthea	133	“ Never mind , ”
60099	60175	60097	60097	Anthea	133	“ I believe it ’s luckier not to really choose . In the stories it ’s always the thing the wood‐cutter ’s son picks up in the forest , and almost throws away because he thinks it ’s no good , that turns out to be the magic thing in the end ; or else some one ’s lost it , and he is rewarded with the hand of the King ’s daughter in marriage . ”
60176	60189	60191	60191	Cyril	131	“ I do n’t want any hands in marriage , thank you . ”
60194	60199	60201	60201	Robert	132	“ Nor yet me , ”
60203	60220	60201	60201	Robert	132	“ It ’s always the end of the adventures when it comes to the marriage hands . ”
60221	60226	60228	60228	Anthea	133	“ Are we ready ? ”
60230	60244	60246	60246	Jane	134	“ It is Egypt we ’re going to , is n’t it?—nice Egypt ? ”
60248	60267	60268	60268	she	134	“ I wo n’t go anywhere I do n’t know about — like that dreadful big‐wavy burning‐mountain city , ”
60280	60284	60286	60286	Cyril	131	“ I say , ”
60289	60343	60286	60286	Cyril	131	“ I ’m rather sick of kings . And people notice you so in palaces . Besides the Amulet ’s sure to be in a Temple . Let ’s just go among the common people , and try to work ourselves up by degrees . We might get taken on as Temple assistants . ”
60344	60348	60350	60350	Anthea	133	“ Like beadles , ”
60352	60367	60350	60350	Anthea	133	“ or vergers . They must have splendid chances of stealing the Temple treasures . ”
60368	60371	60373	60375	the general rejoinder	1543	“ Righto ! ”
60633	60639	60649	60666	a tall , coppery‐coloured man who had climbed into a chariot that had been stopped by the crowd	1563	“ Comrades and fellow workers , ”
60688	60758	60682	60683	the man	2282	“ Comrades and fellow workers , how long are we to endure the tyranny of our masters , who live in idleness and luxury on the fruit of our toil ? They only give us a bare subsistence wage , and they live on the fat of the land . We labour all our lives to keep them in wanton luxury . Let us make an end of it ! ”
60766	60775	60777	60778	a voice	1569	“ How are you going to do it ? ”
60780	60785	60787	60787	another	1570	“ You look out , ”
60789	60798	60787	60787	another	1570	“ or you ’ll get yourself into trouble . ”
60799	60810	60812	60812	Robert	132	“ I ’ve heard almost every single word of that , ”
60814	60821	60812	60812	Robert	132	“ in Hyde Park last Sunday ! ”
60822	60840	60841	60842	the speaker	1571	“ Let us strike for more bread and onions and beer , and a longer mid‐day rest , ”
60846	60898	60841	60842	the speaker	1571	“ You are tired , you are hungry , you are thirsty . You are poor , your wives and children are pining for food . The barns of the rich are full to bursting with the corn we want , the corn our labour has grown . To the granaries ! ”
60899	60904	60907	60908	the crowd	2541	“ To the granaries ! ”
60919	60946	60911	60912	another voice	1573	“ To Pharaoh ! To the King ! Let ’s present a petition to the King ! He will listen to the voice of the oppressed ! ”
61109	61116	61091	61091	They	1584	“ What ’s the trouble now ? ”
61146	61156	61157	61158	the man	2282	“ Oh , the working‐men — discontented as usual , ”
61161	61186	61188	61189	the date‐seller	1591	“ Listen to them . Anyone would think it mattered whether they had a little more or less to eat . Dregs of society ! ”
61191	61194	61196	61197	the lady	1074	“ Scum ! ”
61199	61209	61211	61211	Robert	132	“ And I ’ve heard that before , too , ”
61268	61271	61281	61282	another voice	1573	“ Guards ! ”
61272	61279	61281	61282	another voice	1573	“ The Guards ! The Guards ! ”
61294	61302	61288	61288	workmen	1596	“ The Guards ! Pharaoh ’s Guards ! ”
61382	61389	61391	61393	the crimped‐linen‐dressed lady	1604	“ So that riot ’s over , ”
61395	61423	61391	61393	the crimped‐linen‐dressed lady	1604	“ that ’s a blessing ! And did you notice the Captain of the Guard ? What a very handsome man he was , to be sure ! ”
61466	61474	61476	61476	Cyril	131	“ We ’re well out of that , ”
61478	61481	61483	61483	Anthea	133	“ Yes , ”
61485	61514	61483	61483	Anthea	133	“ but I do wish the poor men had n’t been driven back before they could get to the King . He might have done something for them . ”
61515	61529	61531	61531	Jane	134	“ Not if he was the one in the Bible he would n’t , ”
61533	61540	61531	61531	Jane	134	“ He had a hard heart . ”
61541	61550	61551	61551	Anthea	133	“ Ah , that was the Moses one , ”
61554	61585	61551	61551	Anthea	133	“ The Joseph one was quite different . I should like to see Pharaoh ’s house . I wonder whether it ’s like the Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace . ”
61586	61601	61603	61603	Cyril	131	“ I thought we decided to try to get taken on in a Temple , ”
61608	61650	61651	61651	Robert	132	“ Yes , but we ’ve got to know some one first . Could n’t we make friends with a Temple doorkeeper — we might give him the padlock or something . I wonder which are temples and which are palaces , ”
61687	61699	61651	61651	Robert	132	“ Did you wish to seek out the Temple of Amen‐Rā ? ”
61707	61720	61651	61651	Robert	132	“ or the Temple of Mut , or the Temple of Khonsu ? ”
61831	61839	61841	61841	Cyril	131	“ It does n’t matter which Temple , ”
61844	61850	61852	61854	the young man	1524	“ Tell me your mission , ”
61856	61874	61852	61854	the young man	1524	“ I am a divine father of the Temple of Amen‐Rā and perhaps I can help you . ”
61875	61878	61880	61880	Cyril	131	“ Well , ”
61882	61897	61880	61880	Cyril	131	“ we ’ve come from the great Empire on which the sun never sets . ”
61898	61913	61915	61916	the priest	3339	“ I thought somehow that you ’d come from some odd , out‐of‐the‐way spot , ”
61920	61944	61946	61946	Robert	132	“ And we ’ve seen a good many palaces . We thought we should like to see a Temple , for a change , ”
61957	61966	61968	61969	the priest	3339	“ Have you brought gifts to the Temple ? ”
61972	61979	61981	61981	Cyril	131	“ We have got some gifts , ”
61986	62017	61981	61981	Cyril	131	“ You see there ’s magic mixed up in it . So we ca n’t tell you everything . But we do n’t want to give our gifts for nothing . ”
62018	62026	62028	62029	the priest	3339	“ Beware how you insult the god , ”
62032	62075	62028	62029	the priest	3339	“ I also can do magic . I can make a waxen image of you , and I can say words which , as the wax image melts before the fire , will make you dwindle away and at last perish miserably . ”
62076	62079	62081	62081	Cyril	131	“ Pooh ! ”
62084	62095	62081	62081	Cyril	131	“ that ’s nothing . I can make fire itself ! ”
62096	62108	62110	62111	the priest	3339	“ I should jolly well like to see you do it , ”
62114	62120	62122	62122	Cyril	131	“ Well , you shall , ”
62124	62134	62122	62122	Cyril	131	“ nothing easier . Just stand close round me . ”
62135	62148	62149	62150	The priest	3339	“ Do you need no preparation — no fasting , no incantations ? ”
62156	62163	62165	62165	Cyril	131	“ The incantation ’s quite short , ”
62171	62210	62165	62165	Cyril	131	“ and as for fasting , it ’s not needed in my sort of magic . Union Jack , Printing Press , Gunpowder , Rule Britannia ! Come , Fire , at the end of this little stick ! ”
62270	62273	62274	62274	he	131	“ See ? ”
62281	62290	62274	62274	he	131	“ Here , take it into your hand . ”
62291	62297	62299	62300	the priest	3339	“ No , thank you , ”
62305	62312	62299	62300	the priest	3339	“ Can you do that again ? ”
62313	62316	62274	62274	he	131	“ Yes . ”
62317	62354	62355	62355	he	131	“ Then come with me to the great double house of Pharaoh . He loves good magic , and he will raise you to honour and glory . There ’s no need of secrets between initiates , ”
62360	62429	62355	62355	he	131	“ The fact is , I am out of favour at present owing to a little matter of failure of prophecy . I told him a beautiful princess would be sent to him from Syria , and , lo ! a woman thirty years old arrived . But she was a beautiful woman not so long ago . Time is only a mode of thought , you know . ”
62438	62448	62450	62450	Cyril	131	“ So you know that too , do you ? ”
62452	62467	62469	62470	the priest	3339	“ It is part of the mystery of all magic , is it not ? ”
62472	62545	62469	62470	the priest	3339	“ Now if I bring you to Pharaoh the little unpleasantness I spoke of will be forgotten . And I will ask Pharaoh , the Great House , Son of the Sun , and Lord of the South and North , to decree that you shall lodge in the Temple . Then you can have a good look round , and teach me your magic . And I will teach you mine . ”
62651	62673	62675	62675	Cyril	131	“ The poor Egyptians have n’t improved so very much in their building since the first time we came to Egypt , ”
62743	62746	62747	62748	the priest	3339	“ Amulets , ”
62751	62759	62747	62748	the priest	3339	“ to keep off the evil eye . ”
62760	62773	62774	62774	Robert	132	“ I do n’t think much of your ‘ nice Egypt , ’ ”
62779	62789	62774	62774	Robert	132	“ it ’s simply not a patch on Babylon . ”
62790	62801	62802	62802	Jane	134	“ Ah , you wait till you see the palace , ”
62960	62972	62974	62975	the priest	3339	“ The guard‐chamber , the store‐houses , the Queen ’s house , ”
63005	63010	63011	63011	he	3339	“ We are fortunate , ”
63017	63069	63011	63011	he	3339	“ Pharaoh is even now in the Court of Honour . Now , do n’t forget to be overcome with respect and admiration . It wo n’t do any harm if you fall flat on your faces . And whatever you do , do n’t speak until you ’re spoken to . ”
63070	63081	63083	63083	Robert	132	“ There used to be that rule in our country , ”
63085	63094	63083	63083	Robert	132	“ when my father was a little boy . ”
63331	63335	63340	63340	Pharaoh	239	“ Raise them , ”
63342	63350	63340	63340	Pharaoh	239	“ that they may speak to me . ”
63361	63367	63368	63368	Pharaoh	239	“ Who are these strangers ? ”
63376	63399	63368	63368	Pharaoh	239	“ And what do you mean , Rekh‐marā , by daring to come into my presence while your innocence is not established ? ”
63400	63406	63408	63410	the young priest	1674	“ Oh , great King , ”
63412	63514	63408	63410	the young priest	1674	“ you are the very image of Rā , and the likeness of his son Horus in every respect . You know the thoughts of the hearts of the gods and of men , and you have divined that these strangers are the children of the children of the vile and conquered Kings of the Empire where the sun never sets . They know a magic not known to the Egyptians . And they come with gifts in their hands as tribute to Pharaoh , in whose heart is the wisdom of the gods , and on his lips their truth . ”
63515	63522	63524	63524	Pharaoh	239	“ That is all very well , ”
63526	63533	63524	63524	Pharaoh	239	“ but where are the gifts ? ”
63584	63594	63595	63595	Cyril	131	“ But it ’s not tribute all the same , ”
63598	63605	63595	63595	Cyril	131	“ England does n’t pay tribute ! ”
63627	63637	63638	63638	he	239	“ Deliver them to the Keeper of the Treasury , ”
63652	63674	63649	63649	he	239	“ A small tribute , truly , but strange , and not without worth . And the magic , O Rekh‐marā ? ”
63675	63684	63686	63686	Rekh‐marā	243	“ These unworthy sons of a conquered nation ... ”
63688	63694	63695	63695	Cyril	131	“ Nothing of the kind ! ”
63699	63723	63695	63695	Cyril	131	“ ... of a vile and conquered nation , can make fire to spring from dry wood — in the sight of all . ”
63724	63736	63738	63738	Pharaoh	239	“ I should jolly well like to see them do it , ”
63757	63762	63764	63765	the King	2789	“ Do more magic , ”
63771	63780	63782	63782	Anthea	133	“ He can not do any more magic , ”
63793	63830	63782	63782	Anthea	133	“ because of the voice of the free people who are shouting for bread and onions and beer and a long mid‐day rest . If the people had what they wanted , he could do more . ”
63831	63836	63838	63838	Pharaoh	239	“ A rude‐spoken girl , ”
63840	63849	63850	63850	he	239	“ But give the dogs what they want , ”
63858	63877	63850	63850	he	239	“ Let them have their rest and their extra rations . There are plenty of slaves to work . ”
63884	63894	63895	63895	Rekh‐marā	243	“ You will be the idol of the people , ”
63899	63910	63895	63895	Rekh‐marā	243	“ the Temple of Amen will not contain their offerings . ”
63959	63976	63978	63978	Rekh‐marā	243	“ Oh , greatest of all , before whom sun and moon and stars bow down , ”
63981	63992	63978	63978	Rekh‐marā	243	“ am I pardoned ? Is my innocence made plain ? ”
63993	64005	64007	64007	Pharaoh	239	“ As plain as it ever will be , I daresay , ”
64010	64024	64025	64026	The priest	3339	“ Get along with you . You are pardoned . Go in peace . ”
64032	64036	64038	64039	the King	2789	“ And what , ”
64042	64057	64038	64039	the King	2789	“ is it that moves in that sack ? Show me , oh strangers . ”
64069	64073	64075	64075	Pharaoh	239	“ Seize it , ”
64078	64097	64075	64075	Pharaoh	239	“ A very curious monkey . It will be a nice little novelty for my wild beast collection . ”
64133	64140	64142	64142	Anthea	133	“ Oh , do be careful ! ”
64144	64158	64159	64159	She	133	“ At least keep it dry ! Keep it in its sacred house ! ”
64166	64173	64175	64175	Robert	132	“ It ’s a magic creature , ”
64177	64183	64175	64175	Robert	132	“ it ’s simply priceless ! ”
64184	64194	64196	64196	Jane	134	“ You ’ve no right to take it away , ”
64199	64215	64196	64196	Jane	134	“ It ’s a shame , a barefaced robbery , that ’s what it is ! ”
64226	64237	64238	64238	he	239	“ Take the sacred house of the beast from them , ”
64241	64271	64238	64238	he	239	“ and imprison all . To‐night after supper it may be our pleasure to see more magic . Guard them well , and do not torture them — yet ! ”
64272	64277	64279	64279	Jane	134	“ Oh , dear ! ”
64287	64304	64279	64279	Jane	134	“ I knew exactly what it would be ! Oh , I wish you had n’t ! ”
64305	64311	64313	64313	Cyril	131	“ Shut up , silly , ”
64315	64340	64313	64313	Cyril	131	“ You know you would come to Egypt . It was your own idea entirely . Shut up . It ’ll be all right . ”
64341	64351	64353	64353	Jane	134	“ I thought we should play ball with queens , ”
64355	64373	64353	64353	Jane	134	“ and have no end of larks ! And now everything ’s going to be perfectly horrid ! ”
64445	64454	64455	64455	she	134	“ Now we can get home all right , ”
64458	64464	64466	64466	Anthea	133	“ And leave the Psammead ? ”
64469	64480	64482	64482	Cyril	131	“ Wait a sec . I ’ve got an idea , ”
64512	64517	64518	64518	he	131	“ Stop that row , ”
64522	64525	64518	64518	he	131	“ or — ”
64526	64530	64531	64531	Cyril	131	“ Look here , ”
64534	64580	64531	64531	Cyril	131	“ it ’s very dull for you is n’t it ? Just doing nothing but guard us . Would n’t you like to see some magic ? We ’re not too proud to do it for you . Would n’t you like to see it ? ”
64581	64590	64592	64593	the guard	2960	“ I do n’t mind if I do , ”
64595	64617	64592	64593	the guard	2960	“ Well then , you get us that monkey of ours that was taken away , and we ’ll show you . ”
64618	64631	64633	64634	the soldier	1694	“ How do I know you ’re not making game of me ? ”
64636	64665	64633	64634	the soldier	1694	“ Should n’t wonder if you only wanted to get the creature so as to set it on me . I daresay its teeth and claws are poisonous . ”
64666	64672	64674	64674	Robert	132	“ Well , look here , ”
64676	64724	64674	64674	Robert	132	“ You see we ’ve got nothing with us ? You just shut the door , and open it again in five minutes , and we ’ll have got a magic — oh , I do n’t know — a magic flower in a pot for you . ”
64725	64736	64738	64739	the soldier	1694	“ If you can do that you can do anything , ”
64806	64809	64811	64812	the soldier	1694	“ Well ! ”
64818	64824	64811	64812	the soldier	1694	“ I really am — ! ”
64825	64842	64844	64844	Anthea	133	“ We can do much more wonderful things than that — oh , ever so much , ”
64847	64862	64844	64844	Anthea	133	“ if we only have our monkey . And here ’s twopence for yourself . ”
64870	64875	64876	64876	he	1694	“ What ’s this ? ”
64985	64989	64991	64991	Anthea	133	“ I say , ”
64999	65031	64991	64991	Anthea	133	“ I suppose it ’ll be all right about those workmen ? The King wo n’t go back on what he said about them just because he ’s angry with us ? ”
65032	65037	65039	65040	the soldier	1694	“ Oh , no , ”
65042	65062	65039	65040	the soldier	1694	“ you see , he ’s rather afraid of magic . He ’ll keep to his word right enough . ”
65063	65070	65072	65072	Robert	132	“ Then that ’s all right , ”
65081	65109	65075	65075	Anthea	133	“ Ah , do get us the monkey , and then you ’ll see some lovely magic . Do — there ’s a nice , kind soldier . ”
65110	65144	65145	65145	he	132	“ I do n’t know where they ’ve put your precious monkey , but if I can get another chap to take on my duty here I ’ll see what I can do , ”
65153	65158	65160	65160	Robert	132	“ Do you mean , ”
65162	65179	65160	65160	Robert	132	“ that we ’re going off without even trying for the other half of the Amulet ? ”
65180	65188	65190	65190	Anthea	133	“ I really think we ’d better , ”
65193	65250	65190	65190	Anthea	133	“ Of course the other half of the Amulet ’s here somewhere or our half would n’t have brought us here . I do wish we could find it . It is a pity we do n’t know any real magic . Then we could find out . I do wonder where it is — exactly . ”
65390	65398	65386	65386	Pharaoh	239	“ Do n’t torture them — yet . ”
65399	65408	65410	65410	Cyril	131	“ If the worst comes to the worst , ”
65412	65464	65410	65410	Cyril	131	“ we must just bunk , and leave the Psammead . I believe it can take care of itself well enough . They wo n’t kill it or hurt it when they find it can speak and give wishes . They ’ll build it a temple , I should n’t wonder . ”
65465	65475	65477	65477	Anthea	133	“ I could n’t bear to go without it , ”
65479	65512	65477	65477	Anthea	133	“ and Pharaoh said ‘ After supper , ’ that wo n’t be just yet . And the soldier was curious . I ’m sure we ’re all right for the present . ”
65532	65541	65543	65543	Jane	134	“ Suppose he has n’t got the Psammead ? ”
65583	65590	65592	65593	the soldier	1694	“ Here ’s its fancy overcoat , ”
65607	65610	65612	65612	Cyril	131	“ Now , ”
65614	65633	65612	65612	Cyril	131	“ what would you like us to do ? Anything you ’d like us to get for you ? ”
65634	65641	65643	65644	the soldier	1694	“ Any little trick you like , ”
65646	65667	65668	65668	he	131	“ If you can get a strange flower blooming in an earthenware vase you can get anything , I suppose , ”
65671	65699	65668	65668	he	131	“ I just wish I ’d got two men ’s loads of jewels from the King ’s treasury . That ’s what I ’ve always wished for . ”
65703	65705	65767	65768	the soldier	1694	“ wish ”
65738	65744	65746	65746	Cyril	131	“ Any other little trick ? ”
65749	65757	65746	65746	Cyril	131	“ Shall we become invisible ? Vanish ? ”
65758	65765	65767	65768	the soldier	1694	“ Yes , if you like , ”
65770	65781	65782	65782	He	1694	“ but not through the door , you do n’t . ”
65795	65800	65746	65746	Cyril	131	“ No ! no ! ”
65839	65848	65849	65849	he	1694	“ That ’s magic , if you like , ”
65949	65956	65958	65958	Cyril	131	“ Some one ’s holding her , ”
65960	65966	65958	65958	Cyril	131	“ We must go back . ”
66007	66017	66018	66018	Jane	134	“ Oh , I do wish you had n’t ! ”
66022	66061	66018	66018	Jane	134	“ It was so interesting . The priest had come in and he was kicking the soldier , and telling him he ’d done it now , and they must take the jewels and flee for their lives . ”
66062	66067	66116	66116	Jane	134	“ And did they ? ”
66068	66077	66079	66079	Jane	134	“ I do n’t know . You interfered , ”
66082	66094	66079	66079	Jane	134	“ I should have liked to see the last of it . ”
66113	66115	66116	66116	Jane	134	“ it ”
66127	66143	66144	66144	I	0	“ LOOK here , said Cyril , sitting on the dining‐table and swinging his legs ; “
66150	66151	66144	66144	I	0	” “
66155	66197	66144	66144	I	0	” was the not unnatural rejoinder of the others . Cyril was making a boat with a penknife and a piece of wood , and the girls were making warm frocks for their dolls , for the weather was growing chilly . “
66285	66286	66292	66292	I	0	” “
66295	66299	66292	66292	I	0	” interrupted Robert ; “
66316	66317	66389	66390	Master Cyril	131	” “
66323	66330	66389	66390	Master Cyril	131	” said Cyril in mysterious accents . “
66335	66365	66389	66390	Master Cyril	131	” Old Nurse had come in with the tray of knives , forks , and glasses , and was getting the tablecloth and table‐napkins out of the chiffonier drawer . “
66378	66379	66381	66384	a nice interesting handful	1731	” “
66392	66397	66389	66390	Master Cyril	131	” said old Nurse , “
66425	66426	66427	66427	I	0	” “
66432	66438	66427	66427	I	0	” said Cyril quite untruly ; “
66447	66448	66449	66449	You	1728	” “
66456	66461	66462	66462	Slave	1732	” said old Nurse . “
66480	66481	66462	66462	Slave	1732	” “
66489	66493	66484	66484	you	1728	” said Anthea . “
66510	66515	66501	66501	you	1728	” said Nurse shortly . “
66523	66527	66528	66528	We	1734	” inquired Robert . “
66547	66548	66528	66528	We	1734	” “
66551	66570	66528	66528	We	1734	” said old Nurse , going round the table and putting the knives and forks in their places ; “
66647	66655	66629	66629	his	246	” She ended with a trembling voice . “
66661	66684	66658	66658	you	247	” cried Anthea , and she and Jane instantly hugged her . When she had gone out of the room Anthea said — “
66728	66729	66766	66766	I	0	” “
66734	66738	66766	66766	I	0	” said Robert . “
66775	66779	66768	66768	we	1738	” explained Anthea . “
66809	66814	66807	66807	him	131	” she added hastily , “
66831	67178	66827	66827	you	1738	” The others would have been ashamed not to agree , so they did . It was not till quite near the end of dinner — mutton fritters and blackberry and apple pie — that out of the earnest talk of the four came an idea that pleased everybody and would , they hoped , please Nurse . Cyril and Robert went out with the taste of apple still in their mouths and the purple of blackberries on their lips — and , in the case of Robert , on the wristband as well — and bought a big sheet of cardboard at the stationers . Then at the plumber ’s shop , that has tubes and pipes and taps and gas‐fittings in the window , they bought a pane of glass the same size as the cardboard . The man cut it with a very interesting tool that had a bit of diamond at the end , and he gave them , out of his own free generousness , a large piece of putty and a small piece of glue . While they were out the girls had floated four photographs of the four children off their cards in hot water . These were now stuck in a row along the top of the cardboard . Cyril put the glue to melt in a jampot , and put the jampot in a saucepan and saucepan on the fire , while Robert painted a wreath of poppies round the photographs . He painted rather well and very quickly , and poppies are easy to do if you ’ve once been shown how . Then Anthea drew some printed letters and Jane coloured them . The words were : And when the painting was dry they all signed their names at the bottom and put the glass on , and glued brown paper round the edge and over the back , and put two loops of tape to hang it up by . Of course every one saw when too late that there were not enough letters in “
67181	67185	66827	66827	you	1738	” so the missing “
67187	67211	66827	66827	you	1738	” was put in . It was impossible , of course , to do the whole thing over again for just one letter . “
67214	67229	66827	66827	you	1738	” said Anthea , placing it carefully , face up , under the sofa . “
67247	67248	67242	67242	Squirrel	215	” “
67253	67271	67242	67242	Squirrel	215	” said Cyril in a great hurry , rubbing at his gluey hands with his pocket handkerchief . “
67280	67287	67273	67273	I	0	” There was a long pause . “
67290	67296	67273	67273	I	0	” said Robert at last , “
67306	67307	67301	67301	you	0	” “
67313	67322	67301	67301	you	0	” said Cyril , and again stopped short . “
67326	67330	67301	67301	you	0	” asked Jane . “
67344	67365	67333	67333	I	0	” said Cyril sharply . So no one said any more , and with wrinkled frowns he arranged his ideas . “
67369	67373	67375	67375	I	0	” he said , “
67408	67409	67402	67402	we	1741	” “
67412	67416	67402	67402	we	1741	” said Robert . “
67425	67426	67421	67421	we	1741	” “
67435	67436	67438	67438	we	1741	” “
67442	67446	67438	67438	we	1741	” said Jane . “
67481	67482	67483	67483	I	0	” “
67486	67495	67496	67496	I	0	” said Robert , but he did n’t . “
67500	67510	67515	67515	Squirrel	215	” said Anthea , who did , very nearly . “
67521	67522	67515	67515	Squirrel	215	” “
67525	67533	67515	67515	Squirrel	215	” said Cyril , very slowly indeed , “
67547	67548	67534	67534	we	1741	” “
67558	67562	67550	67550	we	1741	” said Jane . “
67565	67569	67550	67550	we	1741	” said Anthea . “
67576	67593	67534	67534	we	1741	” said Cyril , driven to greater clearness by the blank faces of the other three , “
67634	67635	67636	67636	I	0	” “
67639	67655	67636	67636	I	0	” said Robert , and this time he did , and I hope you do . “
67658	67662	67636	67636	I	0	” said Anthea . “
67672	67673	67665	67665	Squirrel	215	” “
67682	67686	67665	67665	Squirrel	215	” inquired Robert . “
67691	67695	67665	67665	Squirrel	215	” said Cyril , “
67710	67711	67665	67665	Squirrel	215	” “
67722	67726	67727	67727	You	215	” urged Jane . “
67753	67754	67742	67742	I	0	” “
67758	67762	67742	67742	I	0	” said Anthea , “
67777	67792	67793	67793	We	1741	” When every one was clean and dressed , the charm was held up . “
67810	67897	67793	67793	We	1741	” said Cyril , and Jane said the word of Power . They walked through the big arch of the charm straight into the British Museum . They knew it at once , and there , right in front of them , under a glass case , was the Amulet — their own half of it , as well as the other half they had never been able to find — and the two were joined by a pin of red stone that formed a hinge . “
67902	67906	67793	67793	We	1741	” cried Robert . “
67911	67912	67793	67793	We	1741	” “
67915	67922	67793	67793	We	1741	” said Cyril , very gloomily , “
67935	67936	67928	67928	we	1741	” “
67939	67984	67928	67928	we	1741	” said Robert , remembering how impossible the Queen of Babylon had found it to get anything out of the glass cases in the Museum — except by Psammead magic , and then she had n’t been able to take anything away with her ; “
67999	68000	68004	68004	we	1741	” “
68006	68011	68013	68013	you	1741	” interrupted Cyril bitterly , “
68020	68021	68013	68013	you	1741	” “
68024	68028	68013	68013	you	1741	” said Robert , “
68042	68050	68035	68035	I	0	” Nor did any of the others ! “
68057	68061	68055	68055	we	1741	” said Jane . “
68069	68076	68064	68064	I	0	” Cyril ’s tone was impatient , “
68113	68114	68115	68115	I	0	” “
68125	68143	68115	68115	I	0	” said Anthea ; the Museum looks just the same , only lighter and brighter , somehow . ”
68144	68155	68157	68157	Robert	132	“ Let ’s go back and try the Past again , ”
68159	68172	68174	68174	Anthea	133	“ Perhaps the Museum people could tell us how we got it , ”
68220	68233	68235	68235	Jane	134	“ Oh , they ’ve got a new uniform , how pretty ! ”
68255	68260	68252	68252	It	1752	“ From the collection of—. ”
68302	68309	68311	68311	Cyril	131	“ That ’s not much good , ”
68313	68317	68311	68311	Cyril	131	“ thank you . ”
68318	68328	68330	68334	the kind man in blue	1754	“ How is it you ’re not at school ? ”
68336	68344	68330	68334	the kind man in blue	1754	“ Not expelled for long I hope ? ”
68345	68353	68355	68355	Cyril	131	“ We ’re not expelled at all , ”
68359	68374	68376	68377	the man	2282	“ Well , I should n’t do it again , if I were you , ”
68406	68415	68417	68417	Cyril	131	“ Thank you for showing us the label , ”
68628	68636	68638	68638	Anthea	133	“ It ’s like a lovely picture , ”
68693	68703	68705	68705	Jane	134	“ I expect they light those in the evening , ”
68707	68717	68705	68705	Jane	134	“ I do wish we lived in the future ! ”
68837	68841	68843	68843	Anthea	133	“ I know , ”
68846	68858	68843	68843	Anthea	133	“ They ’re not worried ; that ’s what it is . ”
69012	69018	69004	69004	Anthea	133	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
69019	69026	69028	69029	the boy	2860	“ I ’m expelled from school , ”
69046	69057	69004	69004	Anthea	133	“ Do you mind telling us what you ’d done ? ”
69058	69076	69078	69079	the child	1384	“ I — I tore up a sheet of paper and threw it about in the playground , ”
69091	69105	69106	69106	he	1384	“ You wo n’t talk to me any more now you know that , ”
69112	69117	69119	69119	Anthea	133	“ Was that all ? ”
69121	69127	69129	69130	the child	1384	“ It ’s about enough , ”
69132	69142	69129	69130	the child	1384	“ and I ’m expelled for the whole day ! ”
69143	69150	69152	69152	Anthea	133	“ I do n’t quite understand , ”
69169	69178	69179	69179	he	2860	“ Why , whoever on earth are you ? ”
69182	69191	69193	69193	Anthea	133	“ We ’re strangers from a far country , ”
69195	69212	69193	69193	Anthea	133	“ In our country it ’s not a crime to leave a bit of paper about . ”
69213	69218	69220	69221	the child	1384	“ It is here , ”
69223	69244	69220	69221	the child	1384	“ If grown‐ups do it they ’re fined . When we do it we ’re expelled for the whole day . ”
69245	69250	69252	69252	Robert	132	“ Well , but , ”
69254	69263	69252	69252	Robert	132	“ that just means a day ’s holiday . ”
69264	69274	69276	69278	the little boy	1795	“ You must come from a long way off , ”
69280	69323	69276	69278	the little boy	1795	“ A holiday ’s when you all have play and treats and jolliness , all of you together . On your expelled days no one’ll speak to you . Every one sees you ’re an Expelleder or you ’d be in school . ”
69324	69330	69220	69221	the child	1384	“ Suppose you were ill ? ”
69331	69400	69220	69221	the child	1384	“ Nobody is — hardly . If they are , of course they wear the badge , and every one is kind to you . I know a boy that stole his sister ’s illness badge and wore it when he was expelled for a day . He got expelled for a week for that . It must be awful not to go to school for a week . ”
69401	69409	69411	69411	Robert	132	“ Do you like school , then ? ”
69414	69459	69411	69411	Robert	132	“ Of course I do . It ’s the loveliest place there is . I chose railways for my special subject this year , there are such splendid models and things , and now I shall be all behind because of that torn‐up paper . ”
69460	69467	69469	69469	Cyril	131	“ You choose your own subject ? ”
69471	69489	69469	69469	Cyril	131	“ Yes , of course . Where did you come from ? Do n’t you know anything ? ”
69490	69493	69495	69495	Jane	134	“ No , ”
69498	69506	69495	69495	Jane	134	“ so you ’d better tell us . ”
69507	69569	69469	69469	Cyril	131	“ Well , on Midsummer Day school breaks up and everything ’s decorated with flowers , and you choose your special subject for next year . Of course you have to stick to it for a year at least . Then there are all your other subjects , of course , reading , and painting , and the rules of Citizenship . ”
69570	69574	69576	69576	Anthea	133	“ Good gracious ! ”
69578	69582	69584	69585	the child	1384	“ Look here , ”
69590	69616	69584	69585	the child	1384	“ it ’s nearly four . The expelledness only lasts till then . Come home with me . Mother will tell you all about everything . ”
69617	69628	69630	69630	Anthea	133	“ Will your mother like you taking home strange children ? ”
69632	69638	69640	69641	the child	1384	“ I do n’t understand , ”
69660	69664	69640	69641	the child	1384	“ Come on . ”
69950	69957	69959	69959	Cyril	131	“ What ever ’s this for?—lunatics ? ”
69967	69979	69980	69980	she	1074	“ No ! It ’s for the children , of course , ”
69983	69999	69980	69980	she	1074	“ Do n’t tell me that in your country there are no children ’s rooms . ”
70000	70005	70007	70007	Anthea	133	“ There are nurseries , ”
70010	70024	70007	70007	Anthea	133	“ but the furniture ’s all cornery and hard , like other rooms . ”
70025	70029	70031	70032	the lady	1074	“ How shocking ! ”
70034	70079	70031	70032	the lady	1074	“ you must be very much behind the times in your country ! Why , the children are more than half of the people ; it ’s not much to have one room where they can have a good time and not hurt themselves . ”
70080	70087	70089	70089	Anthea	133	“ But there ’s no fireplace , ”
70091	70098	70100	70101	the lady	1074	“ Hot‐air pipes , of course , ”
70103	70122	70100	70101	the lady	1074	“ Why , how could you have a fire in a nursery ? A child might get burned . ”
70123	70128	70130	70130	Robert	132	“ In our country , ”
70133	70150	70151	70151	he	132	“ more than three thousand children are burned to death every year . Father told me , ”
70163	70173	70151	70151	he	132	“ once when I ’d been playing with fire . ”
70180	70190	70191	70191	she	1074	“ What a frightful place you must live in ! ”
70194	70203	70191	70191	she	1074	“ What ’s all the furniture padded for ? ”
70212	70242	70243	70243	Robert	132	“ Why , you could n’t have little tots of two or three running about in rooms where the things were hard and sharp ! They might hurt themselves . ”
70264	70279	70281	70281	Anthea	133	“ But does every one have rooms like this , poor people and all ? ”
70283	70299	70301	70302	the lady	1074	“ There ’s a room like this wherever there ’s a child , of course , ”
70304	70346	70301	70302	the lady	1074	“ How refreshingly ignorant you are!—no , I do n’t mean ignorant , my dear . Of course , you ’re awfully well up in Ancient History . But I see you have n’t done your Duties of Citizenship Course yet . ”
70347	70356	70358	70358	Anthea	133	“ But beggars , and people like that ? ”
70359	70370	70301	70302	the lady	1074	“ and tramps and people who have n’t any homes ? ”
70371	70379	70381	70382	the lady	1074	“ People who have n’t any homes ? ”
70384	70396	70381	70382	the lady	1074	“ I really do n’t understand what you ’re talking about . ”
70397	70406	70408	70408	Cyril	131	“ It ’s all different in our country , ”
70411	70464	70408	70408	Cyril	131	“ and I have read it used to be different in London . Usedn’t people to have no homes and beg because they were hungry ? And was n’t London very black and dirty once upon a time ? And the Thames all muddy and filthy ? And narrow streets , and — ”
70465	70475	70477	70478	the lady	1074	“ You must have been reading very old‐fashioned books , ”
70480	70514	70477	70478	the lady	1074	“ Why , all that was in the dark ages ! My husband can tell you more about it than I can . He took Ancient History as one of his special subjects . ”
70515	70524	70526	70526	Anthea	133	“ I have n’t seen any working people , ”
70528	70537	70539	70540	the lady	1074	“ Why , we ’re all working people , ”
70542	70551	70539	70540	the lady	1074	“ at least my husband ’s a carpenter . ”
70552	70556	70558	70558	Anthea	133	“ Good gracious ! ”
70560	70567	70558	70558	Anthea	133	“ but you ’re a lady ! ”
70568	70571	70573	70574	the lady	1074	“ Ah , ”
70576	70662	70573	70574	the lady	1074	“ that quaint old word ! Well , my husband will enjoy a talk with you . In the dark ages every one was allowed to have a smoky chimney , and those nasty horses all over the streets , and all sorts of rubbish thrown into the Thames . And , of course , the sufferings of the people will hardly bear thinking of . It ’s very learned of you to know it all . Did you make Ancient History your special subject ? ”
70663	70667	70669	70669	Cyril	131	“ Not exactly , ”
70674	70684	70669	70669	Cyril	131	“ What is the Duties of Citizenship Course about ? ”
70685	70772	70573	70574	the lady	1074	“ Do n’t you really know ? Are n’t you pretending — just for fun ? Really not ? Well , that course teaches you how to be a good citizen , what you must do and what you may n’t do , so as to do your full share of the work of making your town a beautiful and happy place for people to live in . There ’s a quite simple little thing they teach the tiny children . How does it go ... ? “
70778	70782	70783	70783	I	0	” said Jane . “
70788	70789	70669	70669	Cyril	131	” “
70800	70805	70669	70669	Cyril	131	” said the lady ; “
70818	70843	70856	70856	Robert	132	“ And ‘ things to eat ’ reminds me — are you hungry ? Wells , run and get a tray of nice things . ”
70844	70854	70856	70856	Robert	132	“ Why do you call him ‘ Wells ’ ? ”
70864	70958	70856	70856	Robert	132	“ It ’s after the great reformer — surely you ’ve heard of him ? He lived in the dark ages , and he saw that what you ought to do is to find out what you want and then try to get it . Up to then people had always tried to tinker up what they ’d got . We ’ve got a great many of the things he thought of . Then ‘ Wells ’ means springs of clear water . It ’s a nice name , do n’t you think ? ”
70978	70983	70985	70986	the lady	1074	“ Now , Wells , ”
70988	71002	70985	70986	the lady	1074	“ run off or you ’ll be late and not meet your Daddy . ”
71015	71019	71021	71021	Anthea	133	“ Look here , ”
71024	71049	71050	71051	The lady	1074	“ would you like to come to our country , and see what it ’s like ? It would n’t take you a minute . ”
71065	71072	71074	71083	the lady , enchanted with the beautiful , growing arch	1834	“ What a splendid conjuring trick ! ”
71085	71089	71091	71091	Anthea	133	“ Go through , ”
71118	71126	71127	71127	she	1074	“ Oh , what a horrible trick ! ”
71130	71140	71127	71127	she	1074	“ What a hateful , dark , ugly place ! ”
71204	71216	71217	71217	she	1074	“ Oh , look at their faces , their horrible faces ! ”
71220	71229	71217	71217	she	1074	“ What ’s the matter with them all ? ”
71230	71240	71242	71242	Robert	132	“ They ’re poor people , that ’s all , ”
71244	71313	71242	71242	Robert	132	“ But it ’s not all ! They ’re ill , they ’re unhappy , they ’re wicked ! Oh , do stop it , there ’s dear children . It ’s very , very clever . Some sort of magic‐lantern trick , I suppose , like I ’ve read of . But do stop it . Oh ! their poor , tired , miserable , wicked faces ! ”
71390	71397	71399	71399	Anthea	133	“ I ’m glad we went , ”
71406	71420	71422	71422	Robert	132	“ I ’ll never throw paper about again as long as I live , ”
71424	71432	71434	71434	Jane	134	“ Mother always told us not to , ”
71436	71452	71454	71454	Cyril	131	“ I would like to take up the Duties of Citizenship for a special subject , ”
71456	71476	71454	71454	Cyril	131	“ I wonder if Father could put me through it . I shall ask him when he comes home . ”
71477	71491	71493	71493	Anthea	133	“ If we ’d found the Amulet , Father could be home now , ”
71495	71502	71493	71493	Anthea	133	“ and Mother and The Lamb . ”
71503	71512	71514	71514	Jane	134	“ Let ’s go into the future again , ”
71517	71532	71514	71514	Jane	134	“ Perhaps we could remember if it was n’t such an awful way off . ”
71542	71556	71539	71539	they	1846	“ The future , where the Amulet is , not so far away . ”
71646	71651	71652	71652	he	2353	“ Dreams , dreams ! ”
71655	71663	71652	71652	he	2353	“ old age is full of them ! ”
71664	71675	71677	71677	Robert	132	“ You ’ve been in dreams with us before now , ”
71679	71685	71677	71677	Robert	132	“ do n’t you remember ? ”
71686	71692	71694	71694	he	2353	“ I do , indeed , ”
71719	71733	71677	71677	Robert	132	“ the most wonderful dreams I ever had , had you in them . ”
71734	71737	71739	71739	Cyril	131	“ Where , ”
71741	71751	71739	71739	Cyril	131	“ did you get that thing in your hand ? ”
71752	71761	71762	71762	he	2353	“ If you were n’t just a dream , ”
71777	71778	71771	71771	you	131	” “
71786	71791	71771	71771	you	131	” Cyril asked eagerly . “
71801	71805	71794	71794	you	131	” he said , “
71850	71851	71845	71845	you	131	” “
71855	71872	71845	71845	you	131	” said Anthea . The learned gentleman pointed to a frame with four photographs in it . “
71877	71903	71874	71874	you	131	” he said . The children saw four grown‐up people ’s portraits — two ladies , two gentlemen — and looked on them with loathing . “
71911	71915	71874	71874	you	131	” whispered Jane . “
71920	71921	71874	71874	you	131	” “
71939	71947	71936	71936	I	0	” Anthea with some insight whispered back . “
71975	71987	71936	71936	I	0	” The learned gentleman was looking at them with wistful kindness . “
71997	72006	71991	71991	me	0	” he said . There was a pause . “
72017	72022	72023	72023	You	131	” Cyril asked suddenly . “
72053	72054	72046	72046	I	0	” “
72058	72064	72056	72056	you	0	” said Cyril , earnestly ; “
72072	72073	72068	72068	you	0	” “
72081	72091	72074	72074	You	131	” said Anthea , looking out of the window , “
72098	72099	72128	72128	you	131	” “
72102	72106	72128	72128	you	131	” said he , “
72152	72157	72149	72149	you	131	” his voice dropped , “
72201	72202	72193	72193	you	131	” “
72207	72211	72193	72193	you	131	” said Robert . “

72526	72537	72521	72521	I	0	” said Anthea , and kissed him . He started . “
72546	72555	72601	72601	you	131	” he said , and his voice trembled . “
72563	72568	72601	72601	you	131	” said Anthea softly , “
72591	72592	72589	72589	Jimmy	219	” “
72595	72599	72589	72589	Jimmy	219	” said he , “
72644	72645	72637	72637	you	131	” “
72651	72655	72646	72646	We	1866	” said Robert . “
72669	72670	72657	72657	you	131	” “
72675	72680	72657	72657	you	131	” he said reproachfully . “
72711	72712	72713	72714	Old Nurse	142	” “
72717	72721	72713	72714	Old Nurse	142	” said Anthea . “
72726	72727	72713	72714	Old Nurse	142	” “
72746	72758	72713	72714	Old Nurse	142	” Jane held up the Amulet in a hand that twittered . “
72761	72765	72713	72714	Old Nurse	142	” she cried , “
72794	72795	72713	72714	Old Nurse	142	” “
72806	72812	72813	72813	It	1871	” pleaded the learned gentleman . “
72816	72826	72813	72813	It	1871	” said Anthea firmly , and kissed him again . “
72834	72838	72813	72813	It	1871	” said Robert , “
72853	72854	72841	72841	I	0	” “
72858	72909	72841	72841	I	0	” cried Jane , stamping in her agony of impatience . And they went . Old Nurse brought in tea almost as soon as they were back in Fitzroy Street . As she came in with the tray , the girls rushed at her and nearly upset her and it . “
72914	72918	72841	72841	I	0	” cried Jane , “
72924	72929	72841	72841	I	0	” and Anthea cried , “
72942	72943	72944	72944	Lord	1875	” “
72949	72953	72944	72944	Lord	1875	” said Nurse , “
72977	72978	72965	72965	Heaven	249	” “
72985	73009	73010	73010	I	0	” She put the tray down and hugged the girls in turn . The boys thumped her on the back with heartfelt affection . “
73022	73026	73010	73010	I	0	” she said . “
73066	73075	73061	73061	I	0	” The yellow light illuminated four pale faces . “
73082	73087	73076	73076	We	1878	” Anthea went on , “
73109	73123	73107	73107	Squirrel	215	” The glazed testimonial was dragged out from under the sofa and displayed . “
73131	73135	73107	73107	Squirrel	215	” said Cyril , “
73139	73140	73107	73107	Squirrel	215	” “
73145	73150	73107	73107	Squirrel	215	” cried old Nurse . “
73207	73231	73193	73193	I	0	” She hugged them all , one after the other . And the boys did not mind it , somehow , that day . “
73245	73258	73193	73193	I	0	” Anthea woke the Psammead with laborious gentleness to put the question . “
73303	73304	73193	73193	I	0	” “
73312	73317	73320	73320	you	131	” said the Psammead , “

73340	73344	73320	73320	you	131	” Anthea persisted , “
73352	73353	73320	73320	you	131	” “
73367	73375	73363	73365	my good child	1133	” said the Psammead , rather crossly , “
73405	73459	73395	73395	You	131	” It went to sand again at once . Anthea crept down in her nightgown to give one last kiss to old Nurse , and one last look at the beautiful testimonial hanging , by its tapes , its glue now firmly set , in glazed glory on the wall of the kitchen . “
73467	73472	73463	73463	your	131	” said old Nurse , “
73482	73483	73545	73545	I	0	” “

73548	73605	73606	73606	Sepia	251	” said Jane , sucking her brush . They were all painting . Nurse in the flush of grateful emotion , excited by Robert ’s border of poppies , had presented each of the four with a shilling paint‐box , and had supplemented the gift with a pile of old copies of the Illustrated London News . “
73608	73613	73606	73606	Sepia	251	” said Cyril instructively , “
73621	73622	73606	73606	Sepia	251	” “
73640	73644	73606	73606	Sepia	251	” said Robert . “

73658	73663	73606	73606	Sepia	251	” said Jane dreamily . “

73706	73712	73694	73694	I	0	” said Anthea , shuddering . “
73725	73729	73694	73694	I	0	” said Jane ; “

73745	73749	73737	73737	I	0	” said Anthea . “
73773	73777	73737	73737	I	0	” said Robert ; “
73812	73813	73816	73816	you	1882	” “
73819	73823	73816	73816	you	1882	” asked Cyril . “
73828	73840	73824	73824	I	0	” said Robert , with the meek pride of superior knowledge . “
73843	73847	73816	73816	you	1882	” asked Cyril . “
73851	73860	73816	73816	you	1882	” said Robert , still more proudly meek . “
73871	73878	73861	73861	You	131	” said Cyril , naturally annoyed , “
73900	73901	73884	73884	Father	137	” “
73909	73922	73884	73884	Father	137	” said Robert , in what was really a rather annoying tone , “
73935	73936	73884	73884	Father	137	” “
73943	73953	73884	73884	Father	137	” said Jane , dreamily sucking her brush again . “
73960	73966	73954	73954	I	0	” said Cyril to Robert . “
73972	73976	73970	73970	yourself	131	” suggested Robert . “
73996	73997	73986	73986	I	0	” “
74000	74009	73986	73986	I	0	” cried Anthea , jumping up very quickly , “
74031	74085	74023	74023	I	0	” Cyril and Robert agreed that this was an idea . Jane consented to stop painting because , as she said , Chinese white , though certainly sweet , gives you a queer feeling in the back of the throat if you paint with it too long . The Amulet was held up . “
74090	74094	74023	74023	I	0	” said Jane , “
74108	74375	74105	74105	you	1884	” Then she said the word . Next moment every one felt a queer rocking and swaying — something like what you feel when you go out in a fishing boat . And that was not wonderful , when you come to think of it , for it was in a boat that they found themselves . A queer boat , with high bulwarks pierced with holes for oars to go through . There was a high seat for the steersman , and the prow was shaped like the head of some great animal with big , staring eyes . The boat rode at anchor in a bay , and the bay was very smooth . The crew were dark , wiry fellows with black beards and hair . They had no clothes except a tunic from waist to knee , and round caps with knobs on the top . They were very busy , and what they were doing was so interesting to the children that at first they did not even wonder where the Amulet had brought them . And the crew seemed too busy to notice the children . They were fastening rush baskets to a long rope with a great piece of cork at the end , and in each basket they put mussels or little frogs . Then they cast out the rope , the baskets sank , but the cork floated . And all about on the blue water were other boats and all the crews of all the boats were busy with ropes and baskets and frogs and mussels . “
74381	74432	74378	74378	you	1885	” Jane suddenly asked a man who had rather more clothes than the others , and seemed to be a sort of captain or overseer . He started and stared at her , but he had seen too many strange lands to be very much surprised at these queerly‐dressed stowaways . “
74440	74445	74378	74378	you	1885	” he said shortly . “
74452	74453	74448	74448	you	1885	” “
74459	74475	74448	74448	you	1885	” said Robert carelessly . The Captain fingered an Amulet that hung round his neck . “
74481	74485	74448	74448	you	1885	” asked Cyril . “
74491	74512	74448	74448	you	1885	” said the man . Then he drew back and spoke in a low voice to one of the sailors . “
74523	74527	74514	74514	we	1888	” said Cyril . “
74536	74540	74529	74529	we	1888	” said Jane . “
74559	74563	74550	74550	I	0	” said Anthea . “
74571	74575	74576	74576	We	1888	” said Robert . “
74600	74601	74595	74595	them	1890	” “
74608	74648	74595	74595	them	1890	” cried Anthea suddenly . On the bare breast of one of the sailors gleamed something red . It was the exact counterpart of their precious half‐Amulet . A silence , full of emotion , was broken by Jane . “
74655	74659	74595	74595	them	1890	” she said . “
74670	74671	74595	74595	them	1890	” “
74679	74683	74684	74684	he	1892	” said Cyril ; “
74689	74702	74684	74684	he	1892	” He did — yet not so strong as the other sailors . “
74707	74712	74713	74713	I	0	” said Anthea musingly , “
74724	74725	74719	74720	that man	431	” “
74734	74738	74726	74726	He	431	” said Robert , “
74751	74859	74745	74745	he	431	” At that moment that sailor looked up . His eyes met Robert’s — and Robert and the others had no longer any doubt as to where they had seen him before . It was Rekh‐marā , the priest who had led them to the palace of Pharaoh — and whom Jane had looked back at through the arch , when he was counselling Pharaoh ’s guard to take the jewels and fly for his life . Nobody was quite pleased , and nobody quite knew why . Jane voiced the feelings of all when she said , fingering their Amulet through the folds of her frock , “
74872	74895	74745	74745	he	431	” For the moment nothing worse happened than an offer of food — figs and cucumbers it was , and very pleasant . “
74899	74904	74745	74745	he	431	” said the Captain , “
74950	74951	74943	74943	He	1901	” “
74957	74961	74943	74943	He	1901	” Jane whispered , “
74977	74994	74969	74969	I	0	” But the boys wanted to stay and see the lines taken up in the morning . “
75003	75007	75015	75015	I	0	” said Cyril , “
75020	75025	75015	75015	I	0	” So they stayed . “
75032	75075	75015	75015	I	0	” said the Captain , who was evidently trying to be civil . He pointed to a great island rock , that rose steeply from the sea , crowned with huge walls and towers . There was another city on the mainland . “
75084	75089	75015	75015	I	0	” said the Captain ; “
75104	75105	75093	75095	the great merchants	1908	” “
75110	75115	75093	75095	the great merchants	1908	” Cyril cried suddenly ; “
75122	75152	75153	75155	Insolent young barbarian	1912	” A ship in full sail was passing swiftly through the fishing fleet . The Captain ’s face changed . He frowned , and his eyes blazed with fury . “
75157	75161	75153	75155	Insolent young barbarian	1912	” he cried . “
75218	75219	75211	75211	Her	1915	” “
75228	75233	75223	75223	we	1918	” said Anthea hastily . “
75260	75261	75252	75255	her dear little husband	1922	” “
75271	75281	75262	75262	I	0	” growled the Captain , but he stopped scowling . “
75288	75293	75267	75267	her	1915	” he went on . “
75345	75346	75370	75374	barbarians from the outer darkness	1927	” “
75350	75354	75370	75374	barbarians from the outer darkness	1927	” said Robert . “
75365	75366	75367	75367	You	1913	” “
75376	75382	75367	75367	You	1913	” said the Captain scornfully . “
75410	75411	75408	75408	princes	1931	” “
75419	75426	75414	75416	the rich merchants	1932	” asked Jane , with interest , “
75431	75432	75433	75433	They	1932	” “
75443	75448	75441	75441	princes	1931	” scowled the skipper . “
75473	75478	75464	75464	We	1918	” said Anthea cordially . “
75487	75492	75485	75485	you	1913	” growled the man . “
75518	75636	75504	75504	you	1913	” He went away , and every one felt snubbed and uncomfortable . And all the time the long , narrow eyes of the Egyptian were watching , watching . They felt as though he was watching them through the darkness , when they lay down to sleep on a pile of cloaks . Next morning the baskets were drawn up full of what looked like whelk shells . The children were rather in the way , but they made themselves as small as they could . While the skipper was at the other end of the boat they did ask one question of a sailor , whose face was a little less unkind than the others . “
75639	75643	75504	75504	you	1913	” he answered , “
75693	75694	75504	75504	you	1913	” “
75699	75791	75504	75504	you	1913	” shouted the skipper . And the man held it . The laden boat was rowed slowly round the end of the island , and was made fast in one of the two great harbours that lay inside a long breakwater . The harbour was full of all sorts of ships , so that Cyril and Robert enjoyed themselves much more than their sisters . The breakwater and the quays were heaped with bales and baskets , and crowded with slaves and sailors . Farther along some men were practising diving . “
75797	75810	75811	75811	I	0	” said Robert , as a naked brown body cleft the water . “
75816	75821	75811	75811	I	0	” said the skipper . “
75871	75872	75873	75873	I	0	” “
75877	75958	75873	75873	I	0	” said Robert , and put away a wild desire to explain to the Captain the English system of waterworks , pipes , taps , and the intricacies of the plumbers ’ trade . As they neared the quay the skipper made a hasty toilet . He did his hair , combed his beard , put on a garment like a jersey with short sleeves , an embroidered belt , a necklace of beads , and a big signet ring . “
75961	75965	75966	75966	I	0	” said he , “
75976	75977	75995	75996	the skipper	3928	” “
75981	75986	75995	75996	the skipper	3928	” said Jane cautiously . “
75998	76010	75995	75996	the skipper	3928	“ the man I told you of , who loves barbarians . ”
76025	76035	76036	76036	he	243	“ I have known these children in another land , ”
76039	76111	76036	76036	he	243	“ You know my powers of magic . It was my magic that brought these barbarians to your boat . And you know how they will profit you . I read your thoughts . Let me come with you and see the end of them , and then I will work the spell I promised you in return for the little experience you have so kindly given me on your boat . ”
76122	76129	76130	76130	he	3928	“ So it was your doing , ”
76133	76145	76130	76130	he	3928	“ I might have guessed it . Well , come on . ”
76162	76190	76159	76159	Robert	132	“ Nonsense — as long as he ’s with us we ’ve got some chance of the Amulet . We can always fly if anything goes wrong . ”
76401	76405	76386	76387	the Egyptian	1304	“ Trust me . ”
76406	76412	76414	76414	Anthea	133	“ I wish we could , ”
76416	76420	76422	76423	the Egyptian	1304	“ You feel , ”
76425	76438	76422	76423	the Egyptian	1304	“ that I want your Amulet . That makes you distrust me . ”
76439	76442	76444	76444	Cyril	131	“ Yes , ”
76447	76463	76444	76444	Cyril	131	“ But you also , you want my Amulet , and I am trusting you . ”
76464	76471	76473	76473	Robert	132	“ There ’s something in that , ”
76475	76485	76487	76488	the Priest	3339	“ We have the two halves of the Amulet , ”
76490	76538	76487	76488	the Priest	3339	“ but not yet the pin that joined them . Our only chance of getting that is to remain together . Once part these two halves and they may never be found in the same time and place . Be wise . Our interests are the same . ”
76636	76671	76633	76633	he	1964	“ My brother Pheles has just come back from Tarshish . He ’s at his garden house — unless he ’s hunting wild boar in the marshes . He gets frightfully bored on shore . ”
76672	76675	76677	76678	the skipper	3928	“ Ah , ”
76680	76721	76633	76633	he	1964	“ he ’s a true‐born Phœnician . ‘ Tyre , Tyre for ever ! Oh , Tyre rules the waves ! ’ as the old song says . I ’ll go at once , and show him my young barbarians . ”
76722	76726	76728	76729	the dye‐master	1964	“ I should , ”
76731	76762	76728	76729	the dye‐master	1964	“ They are very rum , are n’t they ? What frightful clothes , and what a lot of them ! Observe the covering of their feet . Hideous indeed . ”
77014	77021	77023	77023	Robert	132	“ Why is this like Rosherville ? ”
77031	77043	77023	77023	Robert	132	“ Because it ’s the place to spend a happy day . ”
77044	77062	77064	77064	Cyril	131	“ It ’s jolly decent of the skipper to have brought us to such a ripping place , ”
77066	77071	77073	77073	Anthea	133	“ Do you know , ”
77075	77098	77073	77073	Anthea	133	“ this feels more real than anything else we ’ve seen ? It ’s like a holiday in the country at home . ”
77138	77148	77150	77150	Jane	134	“ I should like to spend a week here , ”
77152	77159	77150	77150	Jane	134	“ and donkey ride every day . ”
77209	77212	77213	77213	he	1993	“ Yes , ”
77216	77239	77213	77213	he	1993	“ my steward will pay you the price . But I shall not pay at that high rate for the Egyptian dog . ”
77245	77248	77250	77251	the Egyptian	1304	“ This , ”
77253	77261	77250	77251	the Egyptian	1304	“ is a pretty kettle of fish . ”
77262	77266	77269	77270	the children	278	“ What is ? ”
77274	77279	77281	77281	Rekh‐marā	243	“ Our present position , ”
77283	77288	77289	77289	he	243	“ Our seafaring friend , ”
77292	77300	77289	77289	he	243	“ has sold us all for slaves ! ”
77324	77327	77321	77321	His	256	“ stay , ”
77446	77455	77456	77456	she	2009	“ To distract my mind from my sorrows , ”
77459	77467	77469	77469	Jane	134	“ I do like being a slave , ”
77515	77524	77544	77545	the whisperer	2011	“ Be quiet , or all is lost . ”
77530	77542	77544	77545	the whisperer	2011	“ It ’s me , Rekh‐marā , the Priest of Amen , ”
77547	77591	77544	77545	the whisperer	2011	“ The man who brought us has gone to sea again , and he has taken my Amulet from me by force , and I know no magic to get it back . Is there magic for that in the Amulet you bear ? ”
77600	77607	77609	77609	Cyril	131	“ We can go after him , ”
77614	77634	77609	77609	Cyril	131	“ but he might take ours as well ; or he might be angry with us for following him . ”
77635	77642	77644	77645	the Egyptian	1304	“ I ’ll see to that , ”
77650	77656	77644	77645	the Egyptian	1304	“ Hide your Amulet well . ”
77762	77765	77766	77766	he	254	“ Well ! ”
77769	77776	77766	77766	he	254	“ well , I never did ! ”
77777	77780	77782	77783	the Egyptian	1304	“ Master , ”
77798	77815	77782	77783	the Egyptian	1304	“ we are here by the magic of the sacred Amulet that hangs round your neck . ”
77816	77821	77823	77823	Pheles	254	“ I never did ! ”
77825	77830	77823	77823	Pheles	254	“ Well , well ! ”
77831	77840	77842	77842	Robert	132	“ What port is the ship bound for ? ”
77853	77859	77850	77850	Pheles	254	“ Are you a navigator ? ”
77869	77872	77874	77874	Pheles	254	“ Then , ”
77876	77927	77928	77928	He	254	“ I do n’t mind telling you that we ’re bound for the Tin Isles . Tyre alone knows where the Tin Isles are . It is a splendid secret we keep from all the world . It is as great a thing to us as your magic to you . ”
77956	77966	77968	77968	Jane	134	“ The King sent you , did n’t he ? ”
77970	77973	77975	77975	Pheles	254	“ Yes , ”
77977	78004	78005	78005	He	254	“ he bade me set sail with half a score brave gentlemen and this crew . You shall go with us , and see many wonders . ”
78011	78020	78022	78022	Robert	132	“ What are we going to do now ? ”
78046	78056	78058	78058	Rekh‐marā	243	“ Wait till he lands in the Tin Isles , ”
78060	78088	78089	78089	he	243	“ then we can get the barbarians to help us . We will attack him by night and tear the sacred Amulet from his accursed heathen neck , ”
78096	78106	78108	78108	Jane	134	“ When shall we get to the Tin Isles ? ”
78110	78122	78124	78125	the Egyptian	1304	“ Oh — six months , perhaps , or a year , ”
78128	78134	78136	78136	Jane	134	“ A year of this ? ”
78165	78212	78161	78161	Robert	132	“ Look here , we can shorten that year . Jane , out with the Amulet ! Wish that we were where the Amulet will be when the ship is twenty miles from the Tin Island . That ’ll give us time to mature our plans . ”
78320	78323	78324	78324	he	254	“ Ha ! ”
78327	78359	78324	78324	he	254	“ the charm has brought you back ! I have prayed to it daily these nine months — and now you are here ? Have you no magic that can help ? ”
78360	78366	78368	78369	the Egyptian	1304	“ What is your need ? ”
78372	78447	78368	78369	the Egyptian	1304	“ I need a great wave that shall whelm away the foreign ship that follows us . A month ago it lay in wait for us , by the pillars of the gods , and it follows , follows , to find out the secret of Tyre — the place of the Tin Islands . If I could steer by night I could escape them yet , but tonight there will be no stars . ”
78448	78457	78459	78460	the Egyptian	1304	“ My magic will not serve you here , ”
78466	78487	78463	78463	Robert	132	“ My magic will not bring up great waves , but I can show you how to steer without stars . ”
78551	78559	78560	78560	Robert	132	“ I will give it to you , ”
78563	78573	78560	78560	Robert	132	“ in return for that charm about your neck . ”
78597	78601	78602	78603	the Priest	3339	“ Be comforted , ”
78606	78612	78602	78603	the Priest	3339	“ our time will come . ”
78667	78674	78654	78659	the look‐out man at the stern	2040	“ She is close upon us ! ”
78675	78679	78681	78681	Pheles	254	“ And we , ”
78683	78690	78681	78681	Pheles	254	“ are close to the harbour . ”
78714	78720	78721	78721	he	2040	“ Good friends and gentlemen , ”
78724	78796	78721	78721	he	2040	“ who are bound with me in this brave venture by our King ’s command , the false , foreign ship is close on our heels . If we land , they land , and only the gods know whether they might not beat us in fight , and themselves survive to carry back the tale of Tyre ’s secret island to enrich their own miserable land . Shall this be ? ”
78797	78800	78802	78806	the half‐dozen men near him	2042	“ Never ! ”
78837	78844	78845	78845	he	2040	“ Give me back my Amulet , ”
78886	78896	78897	78897	he	254	“ This is no time for charms and mummeries , ”
78900	78993	78897	78897	he	254	“ We ’ve lived like men , and we ’ll die like gentlemen for the honour and glory of Tyre , our splendid city . ‘ Tyre , Tyre for ever ! It ’s Tyre that rules the waves . ’ I steer her straight for the Dragon rocks , and we go down for our city , as brave men should . The creeping cowards who follow shall go down as slaves — and slaves they shall be to us — when we live again . Tyre , Tyre for ever ! ”
79008	79014	79016	79016	Anthea	133	“ Quick , the Amulet , ”
79105	79120	79124	79125	the doomed	2052	“ Tyre , Tyre for ever ! It ’s Tyre that rules the waves ! ”
79204	79218	79220	79220	Anthea	133	“ And so we ’ve lost the other half of the Amulet again , ”
79232	79237	79239	79240	the Psammead	136	“ Nonsense , pooh ! ”
79242	79269	79239	79240	the Psammead	136	“ that was n’t the other half . It was the same half that you ’ve got — the one that was n’t crushed and lost . ”
79270	79279	79281	79281	Anthea	133	“ But how could it be the same ? ”
79284	79324	79281	79281	Anthea	133	“ Well , not exactly , of course . The one you ’ve got is a good many years older , but at any rate it ’s not the other one . What did you say when you wished ? ”
79325	79329	79331	79331	Jane	134	“ I forget , ”
79333	79338	79340	79341	the Psammead	136	“ I do n’t , ”
79343	79365	79340	79341	the Psammead	136	“ You said , ‘ Take us where you are’—and it did , so you see it was the same half . ”
79366	79370	79372	79372	Anthea	133	“ I see , ”
79374	79381	79372	79372	Anthea	133	“ But you mark my words , ”
79387	79397	79382	79383	the Psammead	136	“ you ’ll have trouble with that Priest yet . ”
79398	79406	79408	79408	Anthea	133	“ Why , he was quite friendly , ”
79410	79423	79408	79408	Anthea	133	“ All the same you ’d better beware of the Reverend Rekh‐marā . ”
79424	79434	79436	79436	Cyril	131	“ Oh , I ’m sick of the Amulet , ”
79438	79445	79436	79436	Cyril	131	“ we shall never get it . ”
79446	79452	79454	79454	Robert	132	“ Oh yes we shall , ”
79456	79464	79454	79454	Robert	132	“ Do n’t you remember December 3rd ? ”
79465	79468	79470	79470	Cyril	131	“ Jinks ! ”
79472	79478	79470	79470	Cyril	131	“ I ’d forgotten that . ”
79479	79486	79488	79488	Jane	134	“ I do n’t believe it , ”
79490	79500	79488	79488	Jane	134	“ and I do n’t feel at all well . ”
79501	79507	79509	79510	the Psammead	136	“ If I were you , ”
79512	79548	79509	79510	the Psammead	136	“ I should not go out into the Past again till that date . You ’ll find it safer not to go where you ’re likely to meet that Egyptian any more just at present . ”
79549	79559	79561	79561	Anthea	133	“ Of course we ’ll do as you say , ”
79564	79578	79561	79561	Anthea	133	“ though there ’s something about his face that I really do like . ”
79579	79594	79596	79597	the Psammead	400	“ Still , you do n’t want to run after him , I suppose , ”
79599	79612	79596	79597	the Psammead	400	“ You wait till the 3rd , and then see what happens . ”
79874	79878	79871	79871	they	2068	“ devil in the dark”—and
79986	80043	79979	79980	the lecturer	2074	“ And I hope every boy in this room has in his heart the seeds of courage and heroism and self‐sacrifice , and I wish that every one of you may grow up to be noble and brave and unselfish , worthy citizens of this great Empire for whom our soldiers have freely given their lives . ”

80318	80372	80302	80303	old Nurse	142	“ not so very far down on the left from the Circus . There ’s big pillars outside , something like Carter ’s seed place in Holborn , as used to be Day and Martin ’s blacking when I was a gell . And something like Euston Station , only not so big . ”
80373	80379	80381	80381	everybody	2317	“ Yes , I know , ”
80444	80454	80455	80455	she	2088	“ I do n’t know , I ’m sure , ”
80462	80470	80455	80455	she	2088	“ I always shop at the Stores . ”
80564	80575	80577	80577	Cyril	131	“ If only the Babylonians could have seen this conjuring , ”
80579	80594	80577	80577	Cyril	131	“ It takes the shine out of their old conjurer , does n’t it ? ”
80595	80598	80600	80600	Anthea	133	“ Hush ! ”
80786	80792	80793	80793	he	265	“ A jolly good trick , ”
80798	80820	80793	80793	he	265	“ and worked under my own eyes , in my own hall . I ’ll find out how that ’s done . ”
80860	80865	80867	80868	Mr Devant	265	“ Ladies and gentlemen , ”
80875	80913	80914	80914	He	265	“ this is a trick I have never before performed . The empty seat , third from the end , second row , gallery — you will now find occupied by an Ancient Egyptian , warranted genuine . ”
80986	80997	80998	80998	Rekh‐marā	243	“ it was that sudden it made her flesh creep . ”
81010	81017	81018	81018	he	243	“ Come out of this crowd , ”
81023	81031	81018	81018	he	243	“ I must talk with you apart . ”
81032	81037	81038	81038	Jane	134	“ Oh , no , ”
81041	81056	81038	81038	Jane	134	“ I did so want to see the Mascot Moth , and the Ventriloquist . ”
81057	81064	81066	81066	Robert	132	“ How did you get here ? ”
81071	81082	81084	81084	Rekh‐marā	243	“ How did you get to Egypt and to Tyre ? ”
81086	81095	81084	81084	Rekh‐marā	243	“ Come , let us leave this crowd . ”
81096	81107	81108	81108	Robert	132	“ There ’s no help for it , I suppose , ”
81118	81121	81123	81128	a man in the row behind	2110	“ Confederates ! ”
81130	81146	81123	81128	a man in the row behind	2110	“ Now they go round to the back and take part in the next scene . ”
81147	81153	81155	81155	Robert	132	“ I wish we did , ”
81157	81161	81163	81163	Cyril	131	“ Confederate yourself ! ”
81344	81348	81350	81350	Cyril	131	“ Come on , ”
81353	81373	81350	81350	Cyril	131	“ He wo n’t begin till we ’re all here . And shut the door , ca n’t you ? ”
81383	81391	81379	81380	the Egyptian	1304	“ My interests and yours are one . ”
81392	81396	81398	81398	Cyril	131	“ Very interesting , ”
81400	81428	81398	81398	Cyril	131	“ and it ’ll be a jolly sight more interesting if you keep following us about in a decent country with no more clothes on than that ! ”
81429	81432	81434	81435	the Priest	3339	“ Peace , ”
81437	81449	81434	81435	the Priest	3339	“ What is this country ? and what is this time ? ”
81450	81456	81458	81458	Anthea	133	“ The country ’s England , ”
81460	81474	81458	81458	Anthea	133	“ and the time ’s about six thousand years later than your time . ”
81475	81481	81483	81484	the Priest	3339	“ The Amulet , then , ”
81489	81506	81483	81484	the Priest	3339	“ gives the power to move to and fro in time as well as in space ? ”
81507	81513	81515	81515	Cyril	131	“ That ’s about it , ”
81518	81536	81515	81515	Cyril	131	“ Look here , it ’ll be tea‐time directly . What are we to do with you ? ”
81537	81549	81551	81551	Rekh‐marā	243	“ You have one‐half of the Amulet , I the other , ”
81553	81566	81551	81551	Rekh‐marā	243	“ All that is now needed is the pin to join them . ”
81567	81574	81576	81576	Robert	132	“ Do n’t you think it , ”
81578	81595	81576	81576	Robert	132	“ The half you ’ve got is the same half as the one we ’ve got . ”
81596	81622	81624	81625	the Priest	3339	“ But the same thing can not be in the same place and the same time , and yet be not one , but twain , ”
81627	81635	81636	81636	He	3339	“ See , here is my half . ”
81644	81649	81650	81650	Jane	134	“ Where is yours ? ”
81835	81839	81841	81841	Rekh‐marā	243	“ Black magic ! ”
81945	81949	81951	81951	Robert	132	“ I thought , ”
81963	81988	81951	81951	Robert	132	“ he ’d have a try for Ours , so I got the ropes out of the box‐room , so as to be ready . ”
82001	82006	82008	82008	Rekh‐marā	243	“ Loosen these bonds ! ”
82012	82025	82008	82008	Rekh‐marā	243	“ before I blast you with the seven secret curses of Amen‐Rā ! ”
82026	82037	82038	82038	Robert	132	“ We should n’t be likely to loose them after , ”
82041	82048	82050	82050	Anthea	133	“ Oh , do n’t quarrel ! ”
82053	82072	82073	82073	she	133	“ Look here , he has just as much right to the thing as we have . This , ”
82085	82103	82073	82073	she	133	“ this has got his in it as well as being ours . Let ’s go shares . ”
82104	82109	82111	82112	the Priest	3339	“ Let me go ! ”
82116	82122	82124	82124	Robert	132	“ Now , look here , ”
82126	82170	82124	82124	Robert	132	“ if you make a row we can just open that window and call the police — the guards , you know — and tell them you ’ve been trying to rob us . Now will you shut up and listen to reason ? ”
82171	82176	82178	82178	Rekh‐marā	243	“ I suppose so , ”
82231	82235	82236	82236	she	133	“ Look here , ”
82244	82302	82236	82236	she	133	“ we want to be friends . We want to help you . Let ’s make a treaty . Let ’s join together to get the Amulet — the whole one , I mean . And then it shall belong to you as much as to us , and we shall all get our hearts ’ desire . ”
82303	82307	82309	82310	the Priest	3339	“ Fair words , ”
82312	82317	82236	82236	she	133	“ grow no onions . ”
82318	82328	82329	82329	Jane	134	“ We say , ‘ Butter no parsnips , ’ ”
82333	82360	82329	82329	Jane	134	“ But do n’t you see we want to be fair ? Only we want to bind you in the chains of honour and upright dealing . ”
82361	82369	82371	82371	Robert	132	“ Will you deal fairly by us ? ”
82373	82377	82379	82380	the Priest	3339	“ I will , ”
82382	82417	82379	82380	the Priest	3339	“ By the sacred , secret name that is written under the Altar of Amen‐Rā , I will deal fairly by you . Will you , too , take the oath of honourable partnership ? ”
82418	82421	82423	82423	Anthea	133	“ No , ”
82434	82497	82498	82498	She	133	“ We do n’t swear in England , except in police‐courts , where the guards are , you know , and you do n’t want to go there . But when we say we ’ll do a thing — it ’s the same as an oath to us — we do it . You trust us , and we ’ll trust you . ”
82529	82532	82533	82533	he	2144	“ Now , ”
82536	82575	82533	82533	he	2144	“ I am stronger than you and my oath is void . I have sworn by nothing , and my oath is nothing likewise . For there is no secret , sacred name under the altar of Amen‐Rā . ”
82576	82583	82592	82593	Every one	2347	“ Oh , yes there is ! ”
82615	82634	82601	82601	Cyril	131	“ You do n’t know everything , though you are a Divine Father of the Temple of Amen , ”
82650	82671	82601	82601	Cyril	131	“ There is a secret , sacred name beneath the altar of Amen‐Rā . Shall I call on that name ? ”
82672	82677	82679	82680	the Priest	3339	“ No , no ! ”
82684	82687	82689	82689	Jane	134	“ No , ”
82693	82703	82689	82689	Jane	134	“ Do n’t let ’s have any calling names . ”
82704	82707	82709	82709	Rekh‐marā	243	“ Besides , ”
82722	82738	82709	82709	Rekh‐marā	243	“ I was only going to say that though there is n’t any name under — ”
82739	82743	82745	82746	the Psammead	136	“ There is , ”
82749	82787	82745	82746	the Psammead	136	“ Well , even if there was n’t , I will be bound by the wordless oath of your strangely upright land , and having said that I will be your friend — I will be it . ”
82788	82795	82797	82798	the Psammead	136	“ Then that ’s all right , ”
82800	82831	82797	82798	the Psammead	136	“ and there ’s the tea‐bell . What are you going to do with your distinguished partner ? He ca n’t go down to tea like that , you know . ”
82832	82846	82848	82848	Anthea	133	“ You see we ca n’t do anything till the 3rd of December , ”
82850	82871	82848	82848	Anthea	133	“ that ’s when we are to find the whole charm . What can we do with Rekh‐marā till then ? ”
82872	82875	82877	82877	Cyril	131	“ Box‐room , ”
82880	82893	82877	82877	Cyril	131	“ and smuggle up his meals . It will be rather fun . ”
82894	82904	82906	82906	Robert	132	“ Like a fleeing Cavalier concealed from exasperated Roundheads , ”
82908	82911	82906	82906	Robert	132	“ Yes . ”
83084	83088	83058	83058	Rekh‐marā	243	“ Good riddance ! ”
83176	83184	83186	83186	Cyril	131	“ The best thing we can do , ”
83188	83208	83186	83186	Cyril	131	“ is to go through the half Amulet straight away , get the whole Amulet , and come back . ”
83209	83215	83216	83216	Anthea	133	“ I do n’t know , ”
83219	83242	83216	83216	Anthea	133	“ Would that be quite fair ? Perhaps he is n’t really a base deceiver . Perhaps something ’s happened to him . ”
83243	83246	83248	83248	Cyril	131	“ Happened ? ”
83250	83260	83248	83248	Cyril	131	“ not it ! Besides , what could happen ? ”
83261	83267	83269	83269	Anthea	133	“ I do n’t know , ”
83271	83303	83269	83269	Anthea	133	“ Perhaps burglars came in the night , and accidentally killed him , and took away the — all that was mortal of him , you know — to avoid discovery . ”
83304	83308	83310	83310	Cyril	131	“ Or perhaps , ”
83312	83340	83341	83341	he	131	“ they hid the — all that was mortal , in one of those big trunks in the box‐room . Shall we go back and look ? ? ”
83345	83350	83341	83341	he	131	“ No , no ! ”
83354	83368	83351	83351	Jane	134	“ Let ’s go and tell the Psammead and see what it says . ”
83369	83372	83374	83374	Anthea	133	“ No , ”
83376	83419	83374	83374	Anthea	133	“ let ’s ask the learned gentleman . If anything has happened to Rekh‐marā a gentleman ’s advice would be more useful than a Psammead ’s . And the learned gentleman’ll only think it ’s a dream , like he always does . ”
83429	83432	83351	83351	Jane	134	“ Come in ”
83458	83461	83463	83465	the learned gentleman	2353	“ Hush ! ”
83469	83496	83463	83465	the learned gentleman	2353	“ please , hush ! or the dream will go . I am learning ... Oh , what have I not learned in the last hour ! ”
83497	83503	83505	83506	the Priest	3339	“ In the grey dawn , ”
83508	83536	83505	83506	the Priest	3339	“ I left my hiding‐place , and finding myself among these treasures from my own country , I remained . I feel more at home here somehow . ”
83537	83547	83549	83551	the learned gentleman	2353	“ Of course I know it ’s a dream , ”
83554	83570	83549	83551	the learned gentleman	2353	“ but , oh , ye gods ! what a dream ! By Jove ! ... ”
83571	83578	83580	83581	the Priest	3339	“ Call not upon the gods , ”
83583	83596	83597	83597	he	3339	“ lest ye raise greater ones than ye can control . Already , ”
83603	83622	83597	83597	he	3339	“ he and I are as brothers , and his welfare is dear to me as my own . ”
83623	83629	83630	83632	the learned gentleman	2353	“ He has told me , ”
83646	83652	83653	83653	he	3339	“ Have you told him , ”
83658	83664	83653	83653	he	3339	“ all about the Amulet ? ”
83665	83668	83670	83670	Rekh‐marā	243	“ No , ”
83672	83692	83670	83670	Rekh‐marā	243	“ Then tell him now . He is very learned . Perhaps he can tell us what to do . ”
83753	83757	83759	83759	Anthea	133	“ Dear Jimmy , ”
83762	83779	83759	83759	Anthea	133	“ do n’t worry about it . We are sure to find it today , somehow . ”
83780	83783	83785	83785	Rekh‐marā	243	“ Yes , ”
83787	83796	83785	83785	Rekh‐marā	243	“ and perhaps , with it , Death . ”
83797	83808	83810	83810	Robert	132	“ It ’s to bring us our hearts ’ desire , ”
83812	83816	83818	83819	the Priest	3339	“ Who knows , ”

84716	84721	84613	84613	she	133	spoke—“and here they are ! ”
84796	84800	84802	84803	old Nurse	305	“ Mercy me ! ”
84805	84835	84802	84803	old Nurse	305	“ I declare if it ’s not too bad of you , Miss Jane . I shall have a nice to‐do getting things straight for your Pa and Ma . ”

85323	85344	85321	85321	Anthea	133	“ and we ’ve got our hearts ’ desire . Father and Mother and The Lamb are coming home today . ”
85345	85351	85353	85353	Rekh‐marā	243	“ But what about me ? ”
85355	85363	85364	85364	Anthea	133	“ What is your heart ’s desire ? ”
85367	85373	85375	85376	the Priest	3339	“ Great and deep learning , ”
85384	85483	85375	85376	the Priest	3339	“ A learning greater and deeper than that of any man of my land and my time . But learning too great is useless . If I go back to my own land and my own age , who will believe my tales of what I have seen in the future ? Let me stay here , be the great knower of all that has been , in that our time , so living to me , so old to you , about which your learned men speculate unceasingly , and often , he tells me , vainly . ”
85484	85490	85492	85493	the Psammead	136	“ If I were you , ”
85495	85557	85492	85493	the Psammead	136	“ I should ask the Amulet about that . It ’s a dangerous thing , trying to live in a time that ’s not your own . You ca n’t breathe an air that ’s thousands of centuries ahead of your lungs without feeling the effects of it , sooner or later . Prepare the mystic circle and consult the Amulet . ”
85558	85565	85567	85569	the learned gentleman	2353	“ Oh , what a dream ! ”
85571	85602	85567	85569	the learned gentleman	2353	“ Dear children , if you love me — and I think you do , in dreams and out of them — prepare the mystic circle and consult the Amulet ! ”
85659	85664	85665	85665	Jane	134	“ Ur Hekau Setcheh , ”
85818	85822	85824	85825	the voice	2425	“ I speak , ”
85827	85836	85824	85825	the voice	2425	“ What is it that you would hear ? ”
85849	85858	85860	85860	Robert	132	“ What are we to do about Rekh‐marā ? ”
85865	85880	85860	85860	Robert	132	“ Shall he go back through the Amulet to his own time , or — ”
85881	85891	85893	85897	the beautiful , terrible voice	2211	“ No one can pass through the Amulet now , ”
85899	85938	85893	85897	the beautiful , terrible voice	2211	“ to any land or any time . Only when it was imperfect could such things be . But men may pass through the perfect charm to the perfect union , which is not of time or space . ”
85939	85947	85949	85949	Anthea	133	“ Would you be so very kind , ”
85952	85984	85949	85949	Anthea	133	“ as to speak so that we can understand you ? The Psammead said something about Rekh‐marā not being able to live here , and if he ca n’t get back — ”
86001	86017	86019	86023	the voice of glorious sweetness	2212	“ Nobody can continue to live in a land and in a time not appointed , ”
86025	86075	86019	86023	the voice of glorious sweetness	2212	“ But a soul may live , if in that other time and land there be found a soul so akin to it as to offer it refuge , in the body of that land and time , that thus they two may be one soul in one body . ”
86119	86124	86125	86125	she	133	“ Oh , but , ”
86136	86184	86125	86125	she	133	“ dear Jimmy ’s soul is n’t at all like Rekh‐marā ’s . I ’m certain it is n’t . I do n’t want to be rude , but it is n’t , you know . Dear Jimmy ’s soul is as good as gold , and — ”
86185	86202	86204	86205	the voice	2425	“ Nothing that is not good can pass beneath the double arch of my perfect Amulet , ”
86207	86232	86204	86205	the voice	2425	“ If both are willing , say the word of Power , and let the two souls become one for ever and ever more . ”
86233	86237	86239	86239	Jane	134	“ Shall I ? ”
86241	86244	86204	86205	the voice	2425	“ Yes . ”
86245	86248	86254	86256	the Egyptian Priest	2101	“ Yes . ”

86345	86353	86343	86343	Jane	134	“ what he was a priest of . ”
86354	86357	86359	86359	Anthea	133	“ Hush ! ”
86409	86412	86414	86414	Rekh‐marā	243	“ Come ! ”
86421	86424	86431	86431	he	2353	“ Come ! ”
86617	86624	86626	86626	Robert	132	“ Oh , the horrid thing ! ”
86654	86657	86659	86660	the Psammead	136	“ That , ”
86662	86672	86659	86660	the Psammead	136	“ was the evil in the soul of Rekh‐marā . ”
86679	86686	86688	86688	Jane	134	“ Then Rekh‐marā ’s him now ? ”
86692	86700	86702	86703	the Psammead	136	“ All that was good in Rekh‐marā , ”
86705	86717	86719	86719	Anthea	133	“ He ought to have his heart ’s desire , too , ”
86728	86734	86736	86737	the Psammead	136	“ His heart ’s desire , ”
86739	86766	86736	86737	the Psammead	136	“ is the perfect Amulet you hold in your hand . Yes — and has been ever since he first saw the broken half of it . ”
86767	86773	86775	86775	Anthea	133	“ We ’ve got ours , ”
86778	86781	86783	86784	the Psammead	136	“ Yes , ”
86795	86880	86783	86784	the Psammead	136	it—“your parents are coming home . And what ’s to become of me ? I shall be found out , and made a show of , and degraded in every possible way . I know they ’ll make me go into Parliament — hateful place — all mud and no sand . That beautiful Baalbec temple in the desert ! Plenty of good sand there , and no politics ! I wish I were there , safe in the Past — that I do . ”
86881	86887	86889	86891	the learned gentleman	2353	“ I wish you were , ”
86934	86937	86939	86939	Anthea	133	“ Well , ”
86945	86964	86939	86939	Anthea	133	“ I suppose it ’s happy . The only thing it ever did really care for was sand . ”
86965	86970	86972	86974	the learned gentleman	2353	“ My dear children , ”
86976	86991	86972	86974	the learned gentleman	2353	“ I must have fallen asleep . I ’ve had the most extraordinary dream . ”
86992	87001	87003	87003	Cyril	131	“ I hope it was a nice one , ”
87007	87023	87003	87003	Cyril	131	“ Yes .... I feel a new man after it . Absolutely a new man . ”
87041	87046	87048	87048	Robert	132	“ It ’s them ! ”
87058	87061	87063	87063	Anthea	133	“ Here ! ”
87081	87115	87116	87116	She	133	“ Here — it ’s yours — your very own — a present from us , because you ’re Rekh‐marā as well as ... I mean , because you ’re such a dear . ”
87169	87173	87175	87177	the learned gentleman	2353	“ Bless me ! ”
87182	87232	87175	87177	the learned gentleman	2353	“ bless me ! What a treasure ! The dear children ! It must be their affection that has given me these luminous aperçus . I seem to see so many things now — things I never saw before ! The dear children ! The dear , dear children ! ”
