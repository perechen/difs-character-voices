2929	2981	2919	2921	the stout individual	338	“ never mind the villains just now , but help me to convey this poor young gentleman to my house , where proper assistance can be rendered him . He still breathes ; but he has received a terrible blow on the head . I hope his skull ai n’t broken . ”

3036	3087	3033	3034	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ I was certain somethin’ dreadful was goin’ on . It was fortunate I was n’t gone to bed ; and still more fortunate you happened to be comin ’ up at the time . But we must n’t stand chatterin ’ here . Bring the poor young gentleman along . ”

4962	4982	4984	4985	the Sandman	247	“ So we ’ve had all this trouble for nuffin ’ , and nearly got shot into the bargain , ”
4998	5008	4984	4985	the Sandman	247	“ I vish I ’d never undertaken the job . ”
5009	5023	5025	5026	the Tinker	246	“ Do n’t let ’s give it up in sich an ‘ urry , ”
5028	5044	5025	5026	the Tinker	246	“ summat may be made on it yet . Let ’s look over them papers . ”
5045	5051	5053	5054	the Sandman	247	“ Look ’em over yourself , ”
5062	5092	5053	5054	the Sandman	247	“ I ’ve done wi ’ ’em . Here , lazy - bones , bring two glasses o ’ rum - and - water — stiff , d’ye hear ? ”
5157	5163	5165	5172	the Sandman , who had lighted a cutty	430	“ Wot ’s the matter ? ”
5180	5188	5165	5172	the Sandman , who had lighted a cutty	430	“ Wot ’s the row , eh ? ”
5189	5196	5198	5199	the Tinker	246	“ Vy , this is it , ”
5207	5238	5198	5199	the Tinker	246	“ there ’s secrets contained in this here pocket - book as’ll be worth a hundred pound and better to us . We ha’n’t had our trouble for nuffin ’ . ”
5239	5245	5247	5248	the Sandman	247	“ Glad to hear it ! ”
5255	5264	5247	5248	the Sandman	247	“ Wot kind o ’ secrets are they ? ”
5265	5272	5274	5275	the Tinker	246	“ Vy , hangin ’ secrets , ”
5281	5297	5274	5275	the Tinker	246	“ He seems to be a terrible chap , and to have committed murder wholesale . ”
5298	5301	5303	5304	the Sandman	247	“ Wholesale ! ”
5313	5335	5303	5304	the Sandman	247	“ That sounds awful . But what a precious donkey he must be to register his crimes i ’ that way . ”
5336	5351	5353	5354	the Tinker	80	“ He did n’t expect the pocket - book to fall into our hands , ”
5356	5361	5363	5364	the Sandman	247	“ Werry likely not , ”
5366	5414	5363	5364	the Sandman	247	“ but somebody else might see it . I repeat , he must be a fool . S’pose we wos to make a entry of everythin ’ we does . Wot a nice balance there ’d be agin us ven our accounts comed to be wound up ! ”
5415	5423	5425	5426	the Tinker	246	“ Ourn is a different bus’ness altogether , ”
5428	5448	5425	5426	the Tinker	246	“ This seems a werry mysterious sort o ’ person . Wot age should you take him to be ? ”
5449	5459	5461	5462	the Sandman	247	“ Vy , five - an’-twenty at the outside , ”
5464	5475	5477	5478	the Tinker	80	“ Five - an’-sixty ‘ ud be nearer the mark , ”
5480	5490	5477	5478	the Tinker	80	“ There ’s dates as far back as that . ”
5491	5497	5499	5500	the Sandman	247	“ Five - an’-sixty devils ! ”
5502	5515	5529	5530	the other	244	“ there must be some mistake i ’ the reckonin ’ there . ”
5516	5527	5529	5530	the other	244	“ No , it ’s all clear an ’ reg’lar , ”
5532	5565	5529	5530	the other	244	“ and that does n’t seem to be the end of it neither . I looked over the papers twice , and one , dated 1780 , refers to some other dokiments . ”
5566	5576	5578	5579	the Sandman	247	“ They must relate to his granddad , then , ”
5581	5591	5578	5579	the Sandman	247	“ it ’s impossible they can refer to him . ”
5592	5604	5606	5607	the Tinker	80	“ But I tell ‘ ee they do refer to him , ”
5618	5667	5606	5607	the Tinker	80	“ at least , if his own word ’s to be taken . Anyhow , these papers is waluable to us . If no one else believes in ’em , it ’s clear he believes in ’em hisself , and will be glad to buy ’em from us . ”
5668	5684	5686	5687	the Sandman	81	“ That ’s a view o ’ the case worthy of an Old Bailey lawyer , ”
5689	5697	5686	5687	the Sandman	81	“ Wot ’s the gemman ’s name ? ”
5698	5708	5710	5711	the Tinker	80	“ The name on the card is Auriol Darcy , ”
5713	5717	5719	5720	the Sandman	247	“ Any address ? ”
5728	5734	5736	5737	the Sandman	247	“ That ’s unlucky agin , ”
5739	5749	5736	5737	the Sandman	247	“ Ai n’t there no sort o ’ clue ? ”
5750	5759	5761	5762	the Tinker	80	“ None votiver , as I can perceive , ”
5764	5778	5780	5781	the Sandman	247	“ Vy , zounds , then , ve’re jist vere ve started from , ”
5783	5818	5780	5781	the Sandman	247	“ But it do n’t matter . There ’s not much chance o ’ makin ’ a bargin vith him . The crack o ’ the skull I gave him has done his bus’ness . ”
5819	5827	5829	5830	the Tinker	80	“ Nuffin ’ o ’ the kind , ”
5832	5842	5829	5830	the Tinker	80	“ He alvays recovers from every kind of accident . ”
5843	5847	5849	5850	the Sandman	247	“ Alvays recovers ! ”
5855	5863	5870	5871	the Tinker	80	“ Wot a constitootion he must have ! ”
5864	5868	5870	5871	the Tinker	80	“ Surprisin ’ ! ”
5873	5908	5870	5871	the Tinker	80	“ he never suffers from injuries — at least , not much ; never grows old ; and never expects to die ; for he mentions wot he intends doin’ a hundred years hence . ”
5909	5919	5921	5922	the Sandman	81	“ Oh , he ’s a lu - nattic ! ”
5924	5975	5921	5922	the Sandman	81	“ a downright lu - nattic ; and that accounts for his wisitin ’ that ’ ere ruined house , and a - fancyin ’ he heerd some one talk to him . He ’s mad , depend upon it . That is , if I ai n’t cured him . ”
5976	5984	5986	5987	the Tinker	80	“ I ’m of a different opinion , ”
5989	5995	5997	5998	Mr. Ginger	92	“ And so am I , ”
6014	6026	6028	6029	the Sandman	247	“ Vy , vot can you know about it , Ginger ? ”
6038	6044	6046	6046	Ginger	92	“ I only know this , ”
6048	6075	6046	6046	Ginger	92	“ that you ’ve got a good case , and if you ’ll let me into it , I ’ll engage to make summat of it . ”
6076	6083	6085	6086	the Sandman	247	“ Vell , I ’m agreeable , ”
6088	6094	6096	6097	the Tinker	246	“ And so am I , ”
6099	6118	6096	6097	the Tinker	246	“ Not that I pays much regard to wot you ’ve bin a readin ’ in his papers , ”
6122	6155	6096	6097	the Tinker	246	“ the gemman ’s evidently half - cracked , if he ai n’t cracked altogether — but he ’s jist the person to work upon . He fancies hisself immortal — eh ? ”
6156	6160	6162	6163	the Tinker	80	“ Exactly so , ”
6165	6179	6181	6181	Ginger	92	“ And he also fancies he ’s committed a lot o ’ murders ? ”
6183	6188	6190	6191	the Tinker	80	“ A desperate lot , ”
6193	6207	6209	6209	Ginger	92	“ Then he ’ll be glad to buy those papers at any price , ”
6211	6240	6209	6209	Ginger	92	“ Ve’ll deal vith him in regard to the pocket - book , as I deals vith regard to a dog — ask a price for its restitootion . ”
6241	6249	6251	6252	the Sandman	81	“ We must find him out first , ”
6254	6262	6264	6264	Ginger	92	“ There ’s no difficulty in that , ”
6266	6288	6264	6264	Ginger	92	“ You must be constantly on the look - out . You ’re sure to meet him some time or other . ”
6289	6294	6296	6297	the Sandman	81	“ That ’s true , ”
6299	6325	6296	6297	the Sandman	81	“ and there ’s no fear of his knowin ’ us , for the werry moment he looked round I knocked him on the head . ”
6326	6330	6332	6333	the Tinker	246	“ Arter all , ”
6335	6377	6332	6333	the Tinker	246	“ there ’s no branch o ’ the perfession so safe as yours , Ginger . The law is favourable to you , and the beaks is afeerd to touch you . I think I shall turn dog - fancier myself . ”
6378	6385	6387	6387	Ginger	92	“ It ’s a good business , ”
6389	6639	6387	6387	Ginger	92	“ but it requires a hedication . As I wos sayin ’ , we gets a high price sometimes for restorin ’ a favourite , especially ven ve’ve a soft - hearted lady to deal vith . There ’s some vimen as fond o ’ dogs as o ’ their own childer , and ven ve gets one o ’ their precious pets , ve makes ’em ransom it as the brigands you see at the Adelphi or the Surrey sarves their prisoners , threatenin ’ to send first an ear , and then a paw , or a tail , and so on . I ’ll tell you wot happened t’other day . There wos a lady — a Miss Vite — as was desperate fond of her dog . It wos a ugly warmint , but no matter for that — the creater had gained her heart . Vell , she lost it ; and , somehow or other , I found it . She vos in great trouble , and a friend o ’ mine calls to say she can have the dog agin , but she must pay eight pound for it . She thinks this dear , and a friend o ’ her own adwises her to wait , sayin ’ better terms will be offered ; so I sends vord by my friend that if she do n’t come down at once the poor animal ’s throat vill be cut that werry night . ”
6640	6643	6645	6646	the others	450	“ Ha!—ha!—ha ! ”
6648	6663	6665	6665	Ginger	92	“ Vell , she sent four pound , and I put up with it , ”
6667	6749	6776	6777	the Tinker	246	“ but about a month arterwards she loses her favourite agin , and , strange to say , I finds it . The same game is played over agin , and she comes down with another four pound . But she takes care this time that I sha n’t repeat the trick ; for no sooner does she obtain persession of her favourite than she embarks in the steamer for France , in the hope of keeping her dog safe there . ”
6750	6774	6776	6777	the Tinker	246	“ Oh ! Miss Bailey , unfortinate Miss Bailey!—Fol - de - riddle - tol - ol - lol — unfortinate Miss Bailey ! ”
6779	6793	6795	6796	the Sandman	247	“ But there ’s dog - fanciers in France , ai n’t there ? ”
6798	6807	6809	6809	Ginger	92	“ Lor ’ bless ‘ ee , yes , ”
6811	6919	6809	6809	Ginger	92	“ there ’s as many fanciers i ’ France as here . Vy , ve drives a smartish trade wi ’ them through them foreign steamers . There ’s scarcely a steamer as leaves the port o ’ London but takes out a cargo o ’ dogs . Ve sells ’em to the stewards , stokers , and sailors — cheap — and no questins asked . They goes to Ostend , Antverp , Rotterdam , Hamburg , and sometimes to Havre . There ’s a Mounseer Coqquilu as comes over to buy dogs , and ve takes ’em to him at a house near Billinsgit market . ”
6920	6933	6935	6936	the Sandman	247	“ Then you ’re alvays sure o ’ a ready market somehow , ”
6938	6941	6943	6943	Ginger	92	“ Sartin , ”
6945	7086	6943	6943	Ginger	92	“ cos the law ’s so kind to us . Vy , bless you , a perliceman ca n’t detain us , even if he knows ve’ve a stolen dog in our persession , and ve svears it ’s our own ; and yet he ’d stop you in a minnit if he seed you with a suspicious - lookin ’ bundle under your arm . Now , jist to show you the difference atwixt the two perfessions:—I steals a dog — walue , maybe , fifty pound , or p’raps more . Even if I ’m catched i ’ the fact I may get fined twenty pound , or have six months ’ imprisonment ; vile , if you steals an old fogle , walue three fardens , you ’ll get seven years abroad , to a dead certainty . ”
7087	7094	7096	7097	the Sandman	81	“ That seems hard on us , ”
7100	7106	7108	7108	Ginger	92	“ It ’s the law ! ”
7111	7246	7108	7108	Ginger	92	“ Now , ve generally escapes by payin ’ the fine , ‘ cos our pals goes and steals more dogs to raise the money . Ve alvays stands by each other . There ’s a reg’lar horganisation among us ; so ve can alvays bring vitnesses to svear vot ve likes , and ve so puzzles the beaks , that the case gets dismissed , and the constable says , ‘ Vich party shall I give the dog to , your vorship ? ’ Upon vich , the beak replies , a - shakin ’ of his vise noddle , ‘ Give it to the person in whose persession it was found . I have nuffin ’ more to do vith it . ’ In course the dog is delivered up to us . ”
7247	7257	7259	7260	the Tinker	246	“ The law seems made for dog - fanciers , ”
7262	7270	7259	7260	the Tinker	246	“ Wot d’ye think o ’ this ? ”

Vell , the moment I spies it , I unties my apron , whips up the dog , and covers it up in a trice . Vell , the lady sees me , an ’ gives me in charge to a perliceman . But that si’nifies nuffin ’ . I brings six vitnesses to svear the dog vos mine , and I actually had it since it vos a blind little puppy ; and , wot ’s more , I brings its mother , and that settles the pint . So in course I ’m discharged ; the dog is given up to me ; and the lady goes avay lamentin ’ . I then plays the amiable , an ’ offers to sell it her for twenty guineas , seein ’ as how she had taken a fancy to it ; but she von’t bite . So if I do n’t sell it next week , I shall send it to Mounseer Coqquilu . The only vay you can go wrong is to steal a dog wi ’ a collar on , for if you do , you may get seven years ’ transportation for a bit o ’ leather and a brass plate vorth a shillin ’ , vile the animal , though vorth a hundred pound , ca n’t hurt you .

7661	7682	7684	7685	the Tinker	246	“ And you ’re always sure o ’ gettin ’ a dog , if you vants it , I s’pose ? ”
7687	7690	7692	7692	Ginger	92	“ Alvays , ”

7792	7806	7808	7809	the Tinker	246	“ And do respectable parties ever buy dogs knowin ’ they ’re stolen ? ”
7811	7818	7820	7820	Ginger	92	“ Ay , to be sure , ”
7822	7907	7820	7820	Ginger	92	“ sometimes first - rate nobs .

8003	8007	8009	8009	Ginger	92	“ Perfectly so , ”
8011	8042	8009	8009	Ginger	92	“ Nothin’ can touch us till dogs is declared by statute to be property , and stealin ’ ’em a misdemeanour . And that wo n’t occur in my time . ”

8318	8321	8323	8323	Ginger	92	“ Pshaw ! ”
8325	8350	8323	8323	Ginger	92	“ I thought you too knowin ’ a cove , Tinker , to be gulled by such an old vife ’s story as that . ”
8351	8364	8366	8367	the Tinker	246	“ Let ’s have the old fellow in and talk to him , ”
8369	8376	8377	8377	he	246	“ Here , lazy - bones , ”

9187	9194	9196	9197	the dwarf	479	“ Well , let ’s see , ”
9199	9204	9196	9197	the dwarf	479	“ What is it ? ”
9205	9215	9217	9218	the Tinker	246	“ Vy , it ’s relative to your age , ”
9220	9226	9217	9218	the Tinker	246	“ Ven wos you born ? ”
9227	9239	9241	9242	Old Parr	90	“ It ’s so long ago , I ca n’t recollect , ”
9246	9258	9260	9261	the Tinker	246	“ You must ha ’ seen some changes in your time ? ”
9277	9287	9289	9290	Old Parr	90	“ I rayther think I have — a few , ”
9300	9479	9289	9290	Old Parr	90	“ I ’ve seen this great city of London pulled down , and built up again — if that ’s anything . I ’ve seen it grow , and grow , till it has reached its present size . You ’ll scarcely believe me , when I tell you , that I recollect this Rookery of ours — this foul vagabond neighbourhood — an open country field , with hedges round it , and trees . And a lovely spot it was . Broad Saint Giles ’s , at the time I speak of , was a little country village , consisting of a few straggling houses standing by the roadside , and there was n’t a single habitation between it and Convent Garden ( for so the present market was once called ) ; while that garden , which was fenced round with pales , like a park , extended from Saint Martin ’s Lane to Drury House , a great mansion situated on the easterly side of Drury Lane , amid a grove of beautiful timber . ”
9480	9484	9486	9486	Ginger	92	“ My eyes ! ”
9493	9502	9486	9486	Ginger	92	“ the place must be preciously transmogrified indeed ! ”
9503	9532	9534	9535	Old Parr	90	“ If I were to describe the changes that have taken place in London since I ’ve known it , I might go on talking for a month , ”
9537	9614	9640	9641	the Tinker	246	“ The whole aspect of the place is altered . The Thames itself is unlike the Thames of old . Its waters were once as clear and bright above London Bridge as they are now at Kew or Richmond ; and its banks , from Whitefriars to Scotland Yard , were edged with gardens . And then the thousand gay wherries and gilded barges that covered its bosom — all are gone — all are gone ! ”
9615	9638	9640	9641	the Tinker	246	“ Those must ha ’ been nice times for the jolly young vatermen vich at Black friars wos used for to ply , ”
9643	9656	9640	9641	the Tinker	246	“ but the steamers has put their noses out o ’ joint . ”
9657	9660	9662	9663	Old Parr	90	“ True , ”
9665	9801	9662	9663	Old Parr	90	“ and I , for one , am sorry for it . Remembering , as I do , what the river used to be when enlightened by gay craft and merry company , I ca n’t help wishing its waters less muddy , and those ugly coal - barges , lighters , and steamers away . London is a mighty city , wonderful to behold and examine , inexhaustible in its wealth and power ; but in point of beauty it is not to be compared with the city of Queen Bess ’s days . You should have seen the Strand then — a line of noblemen ’s houses — and as to Lombard Street and Gracechurch Street , with their wealthy goldsmiths ’ shops — but I do n’t like to think of ’em . ”
9802	9814	9816	9817	the Tinker	246	“ Vell , I ’m content vith Lunnun as it is , ”
9819	9837	9816	9817	the Tinker	246	“ ‘ specially as there ai n’t much chance o ’ the ould city bein ’ rewived . ”
9838	9842	9844	9845	the dwarf	479	“ Not much , ”
9861	9882	9884	9884	Ginger	92	“ I s’pose , my wenerable , you ’ve seen the king as bequeathed his name to these pretty creaters , ”
9909	9915	9917	9918	the dwarf—“often	1593	“ What ! old Rowley ? ”
9918	9953	9917	9918	the dwarf—“often	1593	dwarf—“often . I was page to his favourite mistress , the Duchess of Cleveland , and I have seen him a hundred times with a pack of dogs of that description at his heels . ”
9954	9966	9968	9968	Ginger	92	“ Old Rowley wos a king arter my own ‘ art , ”
9979	10006	9968	9968	Ginger	92	“ He loved the femi - nine specious as well as the ca - nine specious . Can you tell us anythin ’ more about him ? ”
10007	10011	10013	10014	Old Parr	90	“ Not now , ”
10016	10147	10013	10014	Old Parr	90	“ I ’ve seen so much , and heard so much , that my brain is quite addled . My memory sometimes deserts me altogether , and my past life appears like a dream . Imagine what my feelings must be , to walk through streets , still called by the old names , but in other respects wholly changed . Oh ! if you could but have a glimpse of Old London , you would not be able to endure the modern city . The very atmosphere was different from that which we now breathe , charged with the smoke of myriads of sea - coal fires ; and the old picturesque houses had a charm about them , which the present habitations , however commodious , altogether want . ”
10148	10171	10173	10173	Ginger	92	“ You talk like one o ’ them smart chaps they calls , and werry properly , penny - a - liars , ”
10175	10190	10173	10173	Ginger	92	“ But you make me long to ha ’ lived i ’ those times . ”
10191	10220	10222	10223	Old Parr	90	“ If you had lived in them , you would have belonged to Paris Garden , or the bull - baiting and bear - baiting houses in Southwark , ”
10225	10278	10222	10223	Old Parr	90	“ I ’ve seen fellows just like you at each of those places . Strange , though times and fashions change , men continue the same . I often meet a face that I can remember in James the First ’s time . But the old places are gone — clean gone ! ”
10279	10306	10308	10308	Ginger	92	“ Accordin ’ to your own showin ’ , my wenerable friend , you must ha ’ lived uppards o ’ two hundred and seventy year , ”
10315	10334	10308	10308	Ginger	92	“ Now , doorin ’ all that time , have you never felt inclined to kick the bucket ? ”
10335	10340	10342	10343	Old Parr	90	“ Not the least , ”
10345	10368	10342	10343	Old Parr	90	“ My bodily health has been excellent . But , as I have just said , my intellects are a little impaired . ”
10369	10378	10380	10380	Ginger	92	“ Not a little , I should think , ”
10385	10426	10380	10380	Ginger	92	“ I do n’t know vether you ’re a deceivin ’ of us or yourself , my wenerable ; but von thing ’s quite clear — you ca n’t have lived all that time . It ’s not in nater . ”
10427	10437	10439	10440	Old Parr	90	“ Very well , then — I have n’t , ”
10468	10500	10502	10502	Ginger	92	“ You ’ve seen some picters o ’ Old Lunnon , and they ’ve haanted you in your dreams , till you ’ve begun to fancy you lived in those times , ”
10504	10508	10510	10511	Old Parr—“very	109	“ Very likely , ”
10511	10514	10522	10522	his	90	Parr—“very likely . ”
10534	10539	10540	10540	he	90	“ How comes it , ”
10551	10579	10522	10522	his	90	neckcloth,—“how comes it , if you ’ve lived so long , that you ai n’t higher up in the stirrups — better off , as folks say ? ”
10613	10632	10634	10635	Old Parr	90	“ If you wo n’t believe what I tell you , it ’s useless to give an answer , ”
10640	10650	10652	10653	the Tinker	246	“ Oh yes , I believe you , deputy , ”
10655	10662	10652	10653	the Tinker	246	“ and so does the Sandman . ”
10663	10668	10670	10671	the dwarf	479	“ Well , then , ”
10673	10727	10670	10671	the dwarf	479	“ I ’ll tell you how it comes to pass . Fate has been against me . I ’ve had plenty of chances , but I never could get on . I ’ve been in a hundred different walks of life , but they always led down hill . It ’s my destiny . ”
10728	10733	10735	10736	the Tinker—“werry	111	“ That ’s hard , ”
10736	10749	10750	10750	he	90	Tinker—“werry hard . But how d’ye account for livin ’ so long ? ”
10761	10770	10772	10773	the dwarf	479	“ I ’ve already given you an explanation , ”
10775	10794	10796	10797	the Tinker	80	“ Av , but it ’s a cur’ous story , and I vants my friends to hear it , ”
10804	10819	10821	10822	the dwarf	479	“ Well then , to oblige you , I ’ll go through it again , ”
10824	10875	10821	10822	the dwarf	479	“ You must know I was for some time servant to Doctor Lamb , an old alchemist , who lived during the reign of good Queen Bess , and who used to pass all his time in trying to find out the secret of changing lead and copper into gold . ”
10876	10891	10893	10893	Ginger	92	“ I ’ve known several indiwiduals as has found out that secret , wenerable , ”
10895	10907	10893	10893	Ginger	92	“ And ve calls ’em smashers , nowadays — not halchemists . ”
10908	10922	10924	10925	Old Parr	90	“ Doctor Lamb ’s object was actually to turn base metal into gold , ”
10934	11174	10821	10822	the dwarf	479	“ But his chief aim was to produce the elixir of long life . Night and day he worked at the operation;—night and day I laboured with him , until at last we were both brought to the verge of the grave in our search after immortality . One night — I remember it well,—it was the last night of the sixteenth century,—a young man , severely wounded , was brought to my master ’s dwelling on London Bridge . I helped to convey him to the laboratory , where I left him with the doctor , who was busy with his experiments . My curiosity being aroused , I listened at the door , and though I could not distinguish much that passed inside , I heard sufficient to convince me that Doctor Lamb had made the grand discovery , and succeeded in distilling the elixir . Having learnt this , I went down - stairs , wondering what would next ensue . Half - an - hour elapsed , and while the bells were ringing in the new year joyfully , the young man whom I had assisted to carry up - stairs , and whom I supposed at death ’s door , marched down as firmly as if nothing had happened , passed by me , and disappeared , before I could shake off my astonishment . I saw at once he had drunk the elixir . ”
11175	11178	11180	11181	the Tinker	246	“ Ah!—ah ! ”
11200	11208	11210	11211	the dwarf	479	“ As soon as he was gone , ”
11213	11646	11210	11211	the dwarf	479	“ I flew to the laboratory , and there , extended on the floor , I found the dead body of Doctor Lamb . I debated with myself what to do — whether to pursue his murderer , for such I accounted the young man ; but , on reflection , I thought the course useless . I next looked round to see whether the precious elixir was gone . On the table stood a phial , from which a strong spirituous odour exhaled ; but it was empty . I then turned my attention to a receiver , connected by a worm with an alembic on the furnace . On examining it , I found it contained a small quantity of a bright transparent liquid , which , poured forth into a glass , emitted precisely the same odour as the phial . Persuaded this must be the draught of immortality , I raised it to my lips ; but apprehension lest it might be poison stayed my hand . Reassured , however , by the thought of the young man ’s miraculous recovery , I quaffed the potion . It was as if I had swallowed fire , and at first I thought all was over with me . I shrieked out ; but there was no one to heed my cries , unless it were my dead master , and two or three skeletons with which the walls were garnished . And these , in truth , did seem to hear me ; for the dead corpse opened its glassy orbs , and eyed me reproachfully ; the skeletons shook their fleshless arms and gibbered ; and the various strange objects , with which the chamber was filled , seemed to deride and menace me . The terror occasioned by these fantasies , combined with the potency of the draught , took away my senses . When I recovered , I found all tranquil . Doctor Lamb was lying stark and stiff at my feet , with an expression of reproach on his fixed countenance ; and the skeletons were hanging quietly in their places . Convinced that I was proof against death , I went forth . But a curse went with me ! From that day to this I have lived , but it has been in such poverty and distress , that I had better far have died . Besides , I am constantly haunted by visions of my old master . He seems to hold converse with me — to lead me into strange places . ”
11647	11655	11657	11658	the Tinker	246	“ Exactly the case with the t’other , ”
11663	11687	11688	11688	he	246	“ Have you ever , in the coorse o ’ your long life , met the young man as drank the ‘ lixir ? ”
11694	11697	11688	11688	he	246	“ Never . ”
11698	11707	11720	11721	Old Parr	90	“ Do you happen to rekilect his name ? ”
11708	11718	11720	11721	Old Parr	90	“ No ; it has quite escaped my memory , ”
11723	11734	11736	11737	the Tinker	80	“ Should you rekilect it , if you heerd it ? ”
11739	11744	11746	11747	the dwarf	479	“ Perhaps I might , ”
11749	11756	11746	11747	the dwarf	479	“ but I ca n’t say . ”
11757	11763	11765	11766	the other	244	“ Wos it Auriol Darcy ? ”
11768	11774	11776	11777	Old Parr	90	“ That was the name , ”
11785	11810	11776	11777	Old Parr	90	“ I heard Doctor Lamb call him so . But how , in the name of wonder , do you come to know it ? ”
11811	11819	11821	11822	the Tinker	246	“ Ve’ve got summat , at last , ”
11834	11846	11848	11849	the dwarf	479	“ How do you come to know it , I say ? ”
11855	11859	11861	11862	the Tinker	246	“ Never mind , ”
11869	11903	11861	11862	the Tinker	246	“ you see I does know some cur’ous matters as veil as you , my old file . Yo’ll be good evidence , in case ve vishes to prove the fact agin him . ”
11904	11910	11912	11913	the dwarf	479	“ Prove what?—and against whom ? ”
11915	11925	11912	11913	the dwarf	479	“ One more questin , and I ’ve done , ”
11930	11948	11912	11913	the dwarf	479	“ Should you know this young man agin , in case you chanced to come across him ? ”
11949	11955	11957	11958	Old Parr	90	“ No doubt of it , ”
11960	11970	11957	11958	Old Parr	90	“ his figure often flits before me in dreams . ”
11971	11979	11981	11982	the Tinker	246	“ Shall ve let him into it ? ”
11992	11997	11999	12000	the Sandman	247	“ Ay — ay , ”
12002	12008	12010	12010	Ginger	92	“ Better vait a bit , ”
12017	12023	12010	12010	Ginger	92	“ There ’s no hurry . ”
12024	12033	12035	12036	the Tinker	80	“ No ; ve must decide at vonce , ”
12038	12044	12045	12045	he	80	“ Jist examine them papers , ”
12057	12067	12068	12069	The dwarf	479	“ and favour us vith your opinion on ’em . ”
12260	12270	12272	12272	Ginger	92	“ My eyes ! here ’s a pretty go ! ”
12293	12339	12272	12272	Ginger	92	“ Vy , curse it ! if the wenerable ai n’t a - taken the pocket - book with him ! It ’s my opinion the devil has flown avay with the old feller . His time wos nearer at ‘ and than he expected . ”
12340	12361	12363	12364	the Tinker	80	“ Devil or not , I ’ll have him back agin , or at all events the pocket - book ! ”
12631	12641	12643	12644	the landlord	490	“ What the devil can have become of him ? ”
12652	12660	12662	12663	the Tinker	246	“ Ay , that ’s the questin ! ”
12665	12698	12662	12663	the Tinker	246	“ I begin to be of Ginger ’s opinion , that the devil himself must have flown avay vith him . No von else could ha ’ taken a fancy to him . ”
12699	12710	12712	12713	the Sandman	247	“ I only saw a hand and a black cloak , ”
12715	12726	12728	12729	the waiter	410	“ I thought I seed a pair o ’ hoofs , ”
12731	12748	12749	12749	he	410	“ and I ’m quite sure I seed a pair o ’ great glitterin ’ eyes , ”
12762	12769	12771	12772	the landlord	490	“ It ’s a strange affair , ”
12775	12831	12771	12772	the landlord	490	“ It ’s certain that no one has entered the house wearing a cloak such as you describe ; nor could any of the lodgers , to my knowledge , get out of their rooms . It was Old Parr ’s business , as you know , to lock ’em up carefully for the night . ”
12832	12842	12844	12845	the Tinker	246	“ Vell , all ’s over vith him now , ”
12847	12859	12844	12845	the Tinker	246	“ and vith our affair , too , I ’m afeerd . ”
12860	12868	12870	12870	Ginger	92	“ Do n’t say die jist yet , ”
12872	12961	12870	12870	Ginger	92	“ The wenerable ’s gone , to be sure ; and the only thing he has left behind him , barrin ’ his topcoat , is this here bit o ’ paper vich dropped out o ’ the pocket - book as he wos a - takin ’ flight , and vich I picked from the floor . It may be o ’ some use to us . But come , let ’s go down - stairs . There ’s no good in stayin ’ here any longer . ”
13966	13971	13972	13972	he	93	“ You look agitated , ”
13980	13985	13972	13972	he	93	“ What has happened ? ”
13986	13990	13991	13991	she	114	“ Not much , ”
14001	14015	13991	13991	she	114	“ But I have been somewhat alarmed by the person near the gate . ”
14016	14019	14021	14021	Auriol	93	“ Indeed ! ”
14026	14036	14021	14021	Auriol	93	“ Where is he ? I see no one . ”
14037	14050	14052	14052	Ebba	114	“ Not a tall man , wrapped in a long black cloak ? ”
14058	14061	14063	14063	Auriol	93	“ Ha ! ”
14065	14071	14063	14063	Auriol	93	“ Has he been here ? ”
14072	14082	14083	14083	she	114	“ Then you know the person I allude to ? ”
14086	14095	14096	14096	he	93	“ I know some one answering his description , ”
14104	14118	14120	14120	Ebba	114	“ Once beheld , the man I mean is not to be forgotten , ”
14122	14153	14120	14120	Ebba	114	“ He has a countenance such as I never saw before . If I could believe in the ‘ evil eye , ’ I should be sure he possessed it . ”
14154	14165	14167	14167	Auriol	93	“ ’ Tis he , there can be no doubt , ”
14174	14183	14185	14185	Ebba	114	“ Who and what is he , then ? ”
14187	14195	14197	14197	Auriol	93	“ He is a messenger of ill , ”
14199	14208	14197	14197	Auriol	93	“ and I am thankful he is gone . ”
14209	14217	14218	14218	she	114	“ Are you quite sure of it ? ”
14239	14257	14258	14258	she	114	“ And so , after exciting my curiosity in this manner , you will not satisfy it ? ”
14261	14266	14268	14268	Auriol	93	“ I can not , ”
14273	14291	14292	14292	she	114	“ Nay , then , since you are so ungracious , I shall go and prepare breakfast , ”
14295	14305	14292	14292	she	114	“ My father must be down by this time . ”
14306	14309	14311	14311	Auriol	93	“ Stay ! ”
14326	14336	14311	14311	Auriol	93	“ I wish to have a word with you . ”
14374	14377	14379	14379	Auriol	93	“ Ebba , ”
14383	14397	14379	14379	Auriol	93	“ I am about to leave your father ’s house to - day . ”
14398	14403	14404	14404	she	114	“ Why so soon ? ”
14413	14421	14404	14404	she	114	“ You are not entirely recovered yet . ”
14422	14429	14430	14430	he	93	“ I dare not stay longer , ”
14433	14437	14439	14439	Ebba	114	“ Dare not ! ”
14472	14479	14481	14481	Ebba	114	“ If you must really go , ”
14491	14500	14481	14481	Ebba	114	“ I hope we shall see you again ? ”
14501	14505	14507	14507	Auriol	93	“ Most assuredly , ”
14509	14536	14507	14507	Auriol	93	“ I owe your worthy father a deep debt of gratitude — a debt which , I fear , I shall never be able to repay . ”
14537	14549	14550	14550	she	114	“ My father is more than repaid in saving your life , ”
14553	14569	14550	14550	she	114	“ I am sure he will be sorry to learn you are going so soon . ”
14570	14578	14580	14580	Auriol	93	“ I have been here a week , ”
14582	14598	14580	14580	Auriol	93	“ If I remained longer , I might not be able to go at all . ”
14635	14669	14550	14550	she	114	“ I say , Ned , I ’m a - thinkin ’ our master’ll soon have a son - in - law . There ’s pretty plain signs on it at yonder door . ”
14670	14677	14679	14679	Ned	116	“ So there be , John , ”
14684	14704	14679	14679	Ned	116	“ He ’s a good - lookin ’ young feller that . I wish ve could hear their discoorse . ”
14705	14713	14715	14715	John	117	“ No , that ai n’t fair , ”
14732	14744	14746	14746	Ebba	114	“ I would not for the world ask a disagreeable question , ”
14753	14776	14746	14746	Ebba	114	“ but since you are about to quit us , I must confess I should like to know something of your history . ”
14777	14789	14791	14791	Auriol	93	“ Forgive me if I decline to comply with your desire , ”
14793	14845	14791	14791	Auriol	93	“ You would not believe me , were I to relate my history . But this I may say , that it is stranger and wilder than any you ever heard . The prisoner in his cell is not restrained by more terrible fetters than those which bind me to silence . ”
14859	14865	14867	14867	Auriol	93	“ You think me mad , ”
14869	14990	14867	14867	Auriol	93	“ would I were so ! But I shall never lose the clear perception of my woes . Hear me , Ebba ! Fate has brought me into this house . I have seen you , and experienced your gentle ministry ; and it is impossible , so circumstanced , to be blind to your attractions . I have only been too sensible to them — but I will not dwell on that theme , nor run the risk of exciting a passion which must destroy you . I will ask you to hate me — to regard me as a monster whom you ought to shun rather than as a being for whom you should entertain the slightest sympathy . ”
14991	15002	15004	15006	the terrified girl	614	“ You have some motive in saying this to me , ”
15008	15016	15018	15018	Auriol	93	“ My motive is to warn you , ”
15020	15033	15018	15018	Auriol	93	“ If you love me , you are lost — utterly lost ! ”
15061	15077	15078	15078	he	93	“ A terrible fatality attaches to me , in which you must have no share , ”
15086	15098	15099	15099	she	614	“ Would you had never come to my father ’s house ! ”
15108	15117	15119	15119	Auriol	93	“ Is it , then , too late ? ”
15122	15133	15134	15134	she	614	“ It is — if to love you be fatal , ”
15137	15140	15142	15142	Auriol	93	“ Ha ! ”
15152	15186	15142	15142	Auriol	93	“ Recall your words — Ebba — recall them — but no , once uttered — it is impossible . You are bound to me for ever . I must fulfil my destiny . ”
15232	15241	15243	15243	Ebba	114	“ That is the man who frightened me ! ”
15245	15253	15243	15243	Ebba	114	“ It is the person I supposed ! ”
15257	15275	15255	15255	Auriol	93	“ I must speak to him . Leave me , Ebba . I will join you presently . ”
15295	15304	15306	15308	the tall man	619	“ I have sought you for some days , ”
15317	15327	15306	15308	the tall man	619	“ You have not kept your appointment with me . ”
15328	15333	15288	15288	he	93	“ I could not , ”
15335	15341	15306	15308	the tall man	619	Auriol—“an accident has befallen me . ”
15342	15347	15349	15350	the other	244	“ I know it , ”
15352	15388	15349	15350	the other	244	“ I am aware you were assailed by ruffians in the ruined house over the way . But you are recovered now , and can go forth . You ought to have communicated with me . ”
15389	15398	15400	15400	Auriol	93	“ It was my intention to do so , ”
15402	15412	15414	15415	the stranger	599	“ Our meeting can not be delayed much longer , ”
15417	15455	15414	15415	the stranger	599	“ I will give you three more days . On the evening of the last day , at the hour of seven , I shall look for you at the foot of the statue in Hyde Park . ”
15456	15462	15464	15464	Auriol	93	“ I will be there , ”
15466	15475	15477	15478	the stranger	599	“ That girl must be the next victim , ”
15485	15488	15490	15490	Auriol	93	“ Peace ! ”
15492	15510	15512	15513	the stranger	599	“ Nay , I need not remind you of the tenure by which you maintain your power , ”
15515	15525	15512	15513	the stranger	599	“ But I will not trouble you further now . ”
15539	15550	15552	15552	Auriol	93	“ Fate has once more involved me in its net , ”
15555	15575	15552	15552	Auriol	93	“ But I will save Ebba , whatever it may cost me . I will see her no more . ”
15741	15754	15755	15755	he	93	“ I would plunge into them , if I could find repose , ”
15758	15820	15755	15755	he	93	“ But it would avail nothing . I should only add to my sufferings . No ; I must continue to endure the weight of a life burdened by crime and remorse , till I can find out the means of freeing myself from it . Once I dreaded this unknown danger , but now I seek for it in vain . ”
16192	16223	16188	16188	he	93	“ Why , it is my poor murdered grandfather ’s attendant , Flapdragon ! But no ! no!—he must be dead ages ago ! Yet the resemblance is singularly striking ! ”
16364	16370	16372	16372	Auriol	93	“ It must be Flapdragon ! ”
16374	16381	16383	16384	the dwarf	479	“ Ah ! who calls me ? ”
16386	16389	16391	16391	Auriol	93	“ I ! ”
16393	16400	16391	16391	Auriol	93	“ Do you not recollect me ? ”
16401	16406	16408	16409	the dwarf	479	“ To be sure ! ”
16416	16421	16423	16423	he	479	“ you are — — ”
16426	16438	16440	16441	a bystander	652	“ You have been thrown into the water , Master Flapdragon ? ”
16452	16456	16458	16461	the little old man	469	“ I have , ”
16463	16475	16477	16477	another	655	“ By your governor — that is , by this person ? ”
16484	16490	16492	16493	the dwarf	479	“ By him — no , ”
16495	16507	16492	16493	the dwarf	479	“ I have not seen that gentleman for nearly three centuries . ”
16508	16516	16518	16525	the man who had given him the brandy	657	“ Three centuries , my little patriarch ? ”
16527	16537	16518	16525	the man who had given him the brandy	657	“ That ’s a long time . Think again . ”
16538	16546	16548	16549	the dwarf	479	“ It ’s perfectly true , nevertheless , ”
16551	16562	16564	16566	the first speaker	659	“ His wits have been washed away by the water , ”
16568	16576	16564	16566	the first speaker	659	“ Give him a drop more brandy . ”
16577	16584	16586	16587	the dwarf	479	“ Not a bit of it , ”
16589	16606	16607	16607	he	659	“ my senses were never clearer than at this moment . At last we have met , ”
16613	16632	16607	16607	he	659	“ and I hope we shall not speedily part again . We hold life by the same tie . ”
16633	16647	16649	16649	Auriol	93	“ How came you in the desperate condition in which I found you ? ”
16652	16674	16676	16677	the dwarf	479	“ I was thrown into the canal with a stone to my neck , like a dog about to be drowned , ”
16679	16695	16676	16677	the dwarf	479	“ But , as you are aware , I ’m not so easily disposed of . ”
16703	16711	16713	16713	Auriol	93	“ By whom was the attempt made ? ”
16715	16725	16727	16728	the dwarf	479	“ I do n’t know the villain ’s name , ”
16730	16751	16727	16728	the dwarf	479	“ but he ’s a very tall , dark man , and is generally wrapped in a long black cloak . ”
16752	16755	16757	16757	Auriol	93	“ Ha ! ”
16759	16765	16757	16757	Auriol	93	“ When was it done ? ”
16766	16775	16777	16778	the dwarf	479	“ Some nights ago , I should fancy , ”
16780	16803	16777	16778	the dwarf	479	“ for I ’ve been a terrible long time under water . I have only just managed to shake off the stone . ”
16817	16827	16829	16830	the dwarf	479	“ You may laugh , but it ’s true ! ”
16833	16841	16843	16843	Auriol	93	“ We must speak of this anon , ”
16845	16855	16856	16856	he	93	“ Will you convey him to the nearest tavern ? ”
16875	16880	16882	16883	the man	1669	“ Willingly , sir , ”
16885	16905	16882	16883	the man	1669	“ I ’ll take him to the Life Guardsman , near the barracks — that ’s the nearest public . ”
16906	16916	16918	16918	Auriol	93	“ I ’ll join him there in an hour , ”
17141	17148	17149	17149	he	93	“ Our meeting must be brief , ”
17152	17161	17149	17149	he	93	“ Are you prepared to fulfil the compact ? ”
17162	17168	17170	17170	Auriol	93	“ What do you require ? ”
17172	17183	17185	17186	the other	244	“ Possession of the girl I saw three days ago , ”
17188	17203	17185	17186	the other	244	“ the iron - merchant ’s daughter , Ebba . She must be mine . ”
17204	17207	17209	17209	Auriol	93	“ Never ! ”
17210	17212	17185	17186	the other	244	firmly—“never ! ”
17213	17224	17226	17227	the stranger	599	“ Beware how you tempt me to exert my power , ”
17229	17238	17226	17227	the stranger	599	“ she must be mine — or — — ”
17239	17244	17246	17246	Auriol	93	“ I defy you ! ”
17248	17254	17246	17246	Auriol	93	“ I will never consent . ”
17255	17258	17226	17227	the stranger	599	“ Fool ! ”
17277	17293	17302	17302	he	93	“ Bring her to me ere the week be out , or dread my vengeance ! ”
17481	17542	17471	17471	his	686	“ What ! Mr. Darcy , is it you ? Why , we thought we had lost you , sir ! What took you off so suddenly ? We have been expecting you these four days , and were now walking about to try and find you . My daughter has been terribly uneasy . Have n’t you , Ebba ? ”
17559	17581	17583	17583	Auriol	93	“ It was my intention to call , and give you an explanation of my strange conduct , to - day , ”
17585	17601	17583	17583	Auriol	93	“ I hope you received my letter , stating that my sudden departure was unavoidable . ”
17602	17623	17625	17626	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ To be sure ; and I also received the valuable snuffbox you were so good as to send me , ”
17628	17641	17625	17626	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ But you neglected to tell me how to acknowledge the gift . ”
17642	17653	17655	17655	Auriol	93	“ I could not give an address at the moment , ”
17657	17675	17655	17655	Auriol	93	“ Well , I am glad to find you have got the use of your arm again , ”
17682	17711	17655	17655	Auriol	93	“ but I ca n’t say you look so well as when you left us . You seem paler — eh ? what do you think , Ebba ? ”
17712	17730	17731	17731	she	690	“ Mr. Darcy looks as if he were suffering from mental anxiety rather than from bodily ailment , ”
17735	17740	17742	17742	Auriol	93	“ I am so , ”
17748	17776	17742	17742	Auriol	93	“ A very disastrous circumstance has happened to me . But answer me one question : Has the mysterious person in the black cloak troubled you again ? ”
17777	17782	17784	17785	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ What mysterious person ? ”
17791	17797	17799	17799	Ebba	114	“ Never mind , father , ”
17801	17808	17809	17809	she	114	“ I saw him last night , ”
17814	17971	17809	17809	she	114	“ I was sitting in the back room alone , wondering what had become of you , when I heard a tap against the window , which was partly open , and , looking up , I beheld the tall stranger . It was nearly dark , but the light of the fire revealed his malignant countenance . I do n’t exaggerate , when I say his eyes gleamed like those of a tiger . I was terribly frightened , but something prevented me from crying out . After gazing at me for a few moments , with a look that seemed to fascinate while it frightened me , he said—‘You desire to see Auriol Darcy . I have just quitted him . Go to Langham Place to - morrow , and , as the clock strikes two , you will behold him . ’ Without waiting for any reply on my part , he disappeared . ”
17972	17985	17987	17988	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Ah , you never told me this , you little rogue ! ”
17990	18031	18032	18032	he	86	“ You persuaded me to come out with you , in the hope of meeting Mr. Darcy ; but you did not say you were sure to find him . So you sent this mysterious gentleman to her , eh ? ”
18037	18044	18046	18047	the other	244	“ No , I did not , ”
18050	18053	18055	18058	the iron - merchant	561	“ Indeed ! ”
18065	18097	18055	18058	the iron - merchant	561	“ Oh , then I suppose he thought it might relieve her anxiety . However , since we have met , I hope you ’ll walk home and dine with us . ”
18113	18125	18126	18126	he	93	“ I have an engagement , but I will forego it , ”
18154	18165	18167	18167	Ebba	114	“ This is very kind of you , Mr. Darcy , ”
18169	18178	18167	18167	Ebba	114	“ Oh , I have been so wretched ! ”
18179	18186	18187	18187	he	93	“ I grieve to hear it , ”
18190	18198	18187	18187	he	93	“ I hoped you had forgotten me . ”
18199	18209	18210	18210	she	114	“ I am sure you did not think so , ”
18227	18232	18233	18233	she	114	“ What ails you ? ”
18237	18250	18251	18251	he	93	“ I would have shunned you , if I could , Ebba , ”
18254	18273	18251	18251	he	93	“ but a fate , against which it is vain to contend , has brought us together again . ”
18274	18281	18282	18282	she	114	“ I am glad of it , ”
18285	18323	18282	18282	she	114	“ because , ever since our last interview , I have been reflecting on what you then said to me , and am persuaded you are labouring under some strange delusion , occasioned by your recent accident . ”
18324	18331	18333	18333	Auriol	93	“ Be not deceived , Ebba , ”
18335	18360	18333	18333	Auriol	93	“ I am under a terrible influence . I need not remind you of the mysterious individual who tapped at your window last night . ”
18361	18366	18368	18368	Ebba	114	“ What of him ? ”
18376	18385	18387	18387	Auriol	93	“ He it is who controls my destiny , ”
18389	18399	18401	18401	Ebba	114	“ But what has he to do with me ? ”
18403	18408	18409	18409	he	93	“ Much , much , ”
18417	18424	18425	18425	she	694	“ You terrify me , Auriol , ”
18428	18441	18425	18425	she	694	“ Tell me what you mean — in pity , tell me ? ”
18522	18529	18531	18531	Ebba	114	“ What a pretty little dog ! ”
18540	18549	18551	18551	Auriol	93	“ Allow me to present you with it ? ”
18553	18566	18567	18567	she	114	“ You know I should value it , as coming from you , ”
18573	18597	18567	18567	she	114	“ but I can not accept it ; so I will not look at it again , for fear I should be tempted . ”
18618	18654	18598	18601	The dog - fancier	507	“ Do jist look at the pretty little creater , miss . It han’t its equil for beauty . Do n’t be afeerd on it , miss . It ’s as gentle as a lamb . ”
18655	18661	18662	18662	Ebba	114	“ Oh you little darling ! ”
18693	18707	18709	18709	Ginger	92	“ Fairy seems to have taken quite a fancy to you , miss , ”
18711	18809	18709	18709	Ginger	92	“ and she ai n’t i ’ the habit o ’ fallin ’ i ’ love at first sight . I do n’t wonder at it , though , for my part . I should do jist the same , if I wos in her place . Vell , now , miss , as she seems to like you , and you seem to like her , I wo n’t copy the manners o ’ them ’ ere fathers as has stony ‘ arts , and part two true lovyers . You shall have her a bargin . ”
18810	18822	18824	18824	Ebba	114	“ What do you call a bargain , my good man ? ”
18828	18842	18844	18844	Ginger	92	“ I wish I could afford to give her to you , miss , ”
18846	18910	18844	18844	Ginger	92	“ you should have her , and welcome . But I must airn a livelihood , and Fairy is the most wallerable part o ’ my stock . I ’ll tell you wot I give for her myself , and you shall have her at a trifle beyond it . I ’d scorn to take adwantage o ’ the likes o ’ you . ”
18911	18925	18927	18927	Ebba	114	“ I hope you did n’t give too much , then , friend , ”
18929	18941	18943	18943	Ginger	92	“ I did n’t give hayf her wally — not hayf , ”
18945	19039	18943	18943	Ginger	92	“ and if so be you do n’t like her in a month ’s time , I ’ll buy her back again from you . You ’ll alvays find me here — alvays . Everybody knows Mr. Ginger — that ’s my name , miss . I ’m the only honest man in the dog - fancyin ’ line . Ask Mr. Bishop , the great gunmaker o ’ Bond Street , about me — him as the nobs calls the Bishop o ’ Bond Street — an ’ he ’ll tell you . ”
19040	19051	19053	19053	Auriol	93	“ But you have n’t answered the lady ’s question , ”
19055	19064	19053	19053	Auriol	93	“ What do you ask for the dog ? ”
19065	19079	19081	19081	Ginger	92	“ Do you want it for yourself , sir , or for her ? ”
19083	19089	19091	19091	Auriol	93	“ What does it matter ? ”
19094	19101	19103	19103	Ginger	92	“ A great deal , sir , ”
19105	19133	19103	19103	Ginger	92	“ it ’ll make a mater’al difference in the price . To you she ’ll be five - an’-twenty guineas . To the young lady , twenty . ”
19134	19145	19147	19147	Auriol	93	“ But suppose I buy her for the young lady ? ”
19149	19166	19168	19168	Ginger	92	“ Oh , then , in coorse , you ’ll get her at the lower figure ! ”
19170	19182	19184	19185	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ I hope you do n’t mean to buy the dog ? ”
19187	19195	19184	19185	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ The price is monstrous — preposterous . ”
19196	19206	19208	19208	Ginger	92	“ It may appear so to you , sir , ”
19210	19272	19208	19208	Ginger	92	“ because you ’re ignorant o ’ the wally of sich a hanimal ; but I can tell you , it ’s cheap — dirt cheap . Vy , his Excellency the Prooshan Ambassador bought a Charley from me , t’other week , to present to a certain duchess of his acquaintance , and wot d’ye think he give for it ? ”
19273	19287	19289	19290	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ I do n’t know , and I do n’t want to know , ”
19293	19297	19299	19299	Ginger	92	“ Eighty guineas , ”
19301	19334	19299	19299	Ginger	92	“ Eighty guineas , as I ’m a livin ’ man , and made no bones about it neither . The dog I sold him warn’t to be compared wi ’ Fairy . ”
19335	19340	19342	19343	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Stuff — stuff ! ”
19345	19356	19342	19343	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ I ai n’t to be gammoned in that way . ”
19357	19363	19365	19365	Ginger	92	“ It ’s no gammon , ”
19367	19405	19365	19365	Ginger	92	“ Look at them ears , miss — vy , they ’re as long as your own ringlets — and them pads — an ’ I ’m sure you von’t say she ’s dear at twenty pound . ”
19406	19416	19418	19418	Ebba	114	“ She ’s a lovely little creature , indeed , ”
19451	19456	19463	19464	the two	705	“ It ’s him ! ”
19467	19481	19490	19491	the other	244	companion—“it ’s the young man ve’ve been lookin ’ for — Auriol Darcy . ”
19482	19488	19490	19491	the other	244	“ It seems like him , ”
19505	19519	19490	19491	the other	244	“ I vish he ’d turn his face a leetle more this vay . ”
19520	19531	19533	19534	the Tinker	246	“ It ’s him , I tell you , Sandman , ”
19536	19546	19533	19534	the Tinker	246	“ Ve must give the signal to our comrade . ”
19547	19560	19562	19562	Ginger	92	“ Vell , I ’ll tell you wot it is , miss , ”
19565	19631	19562	19562	Ginger	92	“ your sveet’art — I’m sure he ’s your sveet’art — I can tell these things in a minnit — your sveet’art , I say , shall give me fifteen pound , and the dog ’s yourn . I shall lose five pound by the transaction ; but I do n’t mind it for sich a customer as you . Fairy desarves a kind missus . ”
19646	19656	19632	19632	Auriol	93	“ What ’s that you are saying , fellow ? ”
19657	19685	19687	19687	Ginger	92	“ I vos a - sayin ’ , sir , the young lady shall have the dog for fifteen pound , and a precious bargin it is , ”
19689	19704	19706	19706	Auriol	93	“ Well , then , I close with you . Here ’s the money , ”
19713	19720	19722	19722	Ebba	114	“ On no account , Auriol , ”
19725	19731	19722	19722	Ebba	114	“ It ’s too much . ”
19732	19742	19744	19744	Thorneycroft	114	“ A great deal too much , Mr. Darcy , ”
19746	19751	19753	19753	Ginger	92	“ Auriol and Darcy ! ”
19755	19784	19785	19785	he	92	“ Can this be the gemman ve’re a - lookin ’ for . Vere ’s my two pals , I vonder ? Oh , it ’s all right ! ”
19796	19808	19785	19785	he	92	“ They ’re on the look - out , I see . ”
19809	19823	19825	19825	Auriol	93	“ Give the lady the dog , and take the money , man , ”
19828	19834	19836	19836	Ginger	92	“ Beg pardon , sir , ”
19838	19863	19836	19836	Ginger	92	“ but had n’t I better carry the dog home for the young lady ? It might meet vith some accident in the vay . ”
19864	19869	19871	19872	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Accident!—stuff and nonsense ! ”
19874	19912	19871	19872	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ The rascal only wants to follow you home , that he may know where you live , and steal the dog back again . Take my advice , Mr. Darcy , and do n’t buy it . ”
19913	19919	19921	19921	Ginger	92	“ The bargain ’s concluded , ”
19949	19961	19963	19963	Ebba	114	“ How shall I thank you for this treasure , Auriol ? ”
19971	19984	19985	19985	he	93	“ By transferring to it all regard you may entertain for me , ”
19993	19998	19999	19999	she	114	“ That is impossible , ”
20002	20013	20015	20016	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Well , I vote we drive away at once , ”
20018	20023	20024	20024	he	86	“ Halloa ! jarvey ! ”
20041	20060	20064	20064	he	86	“ Now get in , Ebba . By this means we shall avoid being followed by the rascal . ”
20102	20108	20110	20111	the fellow	712	“ Beg pardin , sir , ”
20117	20127	20110	20111	the fellow	712	“ but ai n’t your name Mr. Auriol Darcy ? ”
20128	20132	20134	20134	Auriol	93	“ It is , ”

20192	20206	20208	20209	the Tinker	246	“ You ’ll know me better by - and - by , sir , ”
20216	20226	20208	20209	the Tinker	246	“ I must speak to you , and alone . ”
20227	20251	20253	20253	Auriol	93	“ If you do n’t go about your business , fellow , instantly , I ’ll give you in charge of the police , ”
20255	20268	20270	20271	the Tinker	80	“ No , you von’t , sir — no , you von’t , ”

20311	20321	20323	20323	Thorneycroft	86	“ Wo n’t you get in , Mr. Darcy ? ”
20332	20340	20342	20342	Auriol	93	“ I must speak to this man , ”
20344	20361	20342	20342	Auriol	93	“ I ’ll come to you in the evening . Till then , farewell , Ebba . ”
20376	20387	20370	20370	he	80	“ Now , rascal , what have you to say ? ”
20388	20395	20397	20398	the Tinker	80	“ Step this vay , sir , ”
20400	20425	20397	20398	the Tinker	80	“ There ’s two friends o ’ mine as vishes to be present at our conference . Ve’d better valk into a back street . ”
20519	20529	20531	20531	Auriol	93	“ Now , what do you want with me ? ”
20533	20539	20541	20542	the Tinker	246	“ You shall learn presently , ”
20544	20566	20541	20542	the Tinker	246	“ but first , it may be as vell to state , that a certain pocket - book has been found . ”
20567	20570	20572	20572	Auriol	93	“ Ah ! ”
20574	20591	20572	20572	Auriol	93	“ You are the villains who beset me in the ruined house in the Vauxhall Road . ”
20592	20605	20607	20608	the Tinker	246	“ Your pocket - book has been found , I tell you , ”
20610	20695	20607	20608	the Tinker	246	“ and from it ve have made the most awful diskiveries . Our werry ‘ air stood on end ven ve first read the shockin ’ particulars . What a bloodthirsty ruffian you must be ! Vy , ve finds you ’ve been i ’ the habit o ’ makin ’ avay with a young ooman vonce every ten years . Your last wictim wos in 1820 — the last but one , in 1810 — and the one before her , in 1800 . ”
20696	20704	20706	20707	the Sandman	247	“ Hangin ’s too good for you ! ”
20709	20720	20706	20707	the Sandman	247	“ but if ve peaches you ’re sartin to sving . ”

20749	20755	20747	20747	Auriol	93	“ What do you require ? ”
20756	20765	20767	20768	the Tinker	246	“ A hundred pound each’ll buy our silence , ”
20770	20778	20780	20781	the Sandman	247	“ Ve ought to have double that , ”
20783	20809	20780	20781	the Sandman	247	“ for screenin ’ sich atterocious crimes as he has parpetrated . Ve’re not werry partic’lar ourselves , but ve do n’t commit murder wholesale . ”
20810	20819	20821	20821	Ginger	92	“ Ve do n’t commit murder at all , ”
20823	20828	20821	20821	Ginger	92	“ You may fancy , ”
20833	20915	20916	20916	Auriol	93	“ that ve ai n’t perfectly acvainted with your history , but to prove that ve are , I ’ll just rub up your memory . Did you ever hear tell of a gemman as murdered Doctor Lamb , the famous halchemist o ’ Queen Bess ’s time , and , havin’ drank the ‘ lixir vich the doctor had made for hisself , has lived ever since ? Did you ever hear tell of such a person , I say ? ”
20923	20931	20932	20932	he	93	“ What idle tale are you inventing ? ”
20937	20944	20946	20947	the Tinker	246	“ It is no idle tale , ”
20950	20966	20946	20947	the Tinker	246	“ Ve can bring a vitness as’ll prove the fact — a livin ’ vitness . ”
20967	20971	20973	20973	Auriol	93	“ What witness ? ”
20975	20989	20991	20992	the Tinker	80	“ Do n’t you reckilect the dwarf as used to serve Doctor Lamb ? ”
20994	21014	20991	20992	the Tinker	80	“ He ’s alive still ; and ve calls him Old Parr , on account of his great age . ”
21015	21024	21026	21026	Auriol	93	“ Where is he?—what has become of him ? ”
21028	21038	21040	21041	the Tinker	80	“ Oh , ve’ll perduce him in doo time , ”
21044	21054	21056	21056	Auriol	93	“ But tell me where the poor fellow is ? ”
21058	21094	21056	21056	Auriol	93	“ Have you seen him since last night ? I sent him to a public - house at Kensington , but he has disappeared from it , and I can discover no traces of him . ”
21095	21105	21107	21108	the Tinker	246	“ He ’ll turn up somewhere — never fear , ”
21110	21154	21107	21108	the Tinker	246	“ But now , sir , that ve fairly understands each other , are you agreeable to our terms ? You shall give us an order for the money , and ve’ll undertake , on our parts , not to mislest you more . ”
21155	21170	21172	21172	Auriol	93	“ The pocket - book must be delivered up to me if I assent , ”
21174	21183	21172	21172	Auriol	93	“ and the poor dwarf must be found . ”
21184	21196	21198	21199	the Tinker	246	“ Vy , as to that , I can scarcely promise , ”
21201	21232	21198	21199	the Tinker	246	“ there ’s a difficulty in the case , you see . But the pocket - book’ll never be brought aginst you — you may rest assured o ’ that . ”
21233	21246	21248	21248	Auriol	93	“ I must have it , or you get nothing from me , ”
21250	21266	21268	21268	Ginger	92	“ Here ’s a bit o ’ paper as come from the pocket - book , ”
21270	21316	21268	21268	Ginger	92	“ Would you like to hear wot ’s written upon it ? Here are the words : ‘ How many crimes have I to reproach myself with ! How many innocents have I destroyed ! And all owing to my fatal compact with — — ’ ”
21317	21323	21325	21325	Auriol	93	“ Give me that paper , ”
21389	21396	21397	21397	he	92	“ Halloa ! What ’s that ? ”
21400	21406	21397	21397	he	92	“ The paper ’s gone ! ”
21407	21412	21414	21415	the Sandman	247	“ The hand again ! ”
21420	21434	21414	21415	the Sandman	247	“ See who ’s in the passage — open the door — quick ! ”
21446	21472	21397	21397	he	92	“ There ’s no one there . It must be the devil . I ’ll have nuffin ’ more to do wi ’ the matter . ”
21473	21484	21486	21487	the Tinker	246	“ Poh ! poh ! do n’t be so chicken-‘arted ! ”
21489	21510	21486	21487	the Tinker	246	“ But come what may , the gemman sha n’t stir till he undertakes to pay us three hundred pounds . ”
21511	21522	21524	21524	Auriol	93	“ You seek to frighten me in vain , villain , ”
21536	21556	21524	21524	Auriol	93	“ I have but to stamp my foot , and I can instantly bring assistance that shall overpower you . ”
21557	21563	21565	21565	Ginger	92	“ Do n’t provoke him , ”
21573	21592	21594	21594	he	246	“ For my part , I sha n’t stay any longer . I would n’t take his money . ”
21599	21613	21615	21616	the Sandman	247	“ I ’ll go and see wot ’s the matter wi ’ Ginger , ”
21637	21650	21652	21652	Auriol	93	“ Here , take this purse , and trouble me no more ! ”
21671	21687	21688	21688	he	246	“ I ’m bad enough — but I wo n’t sell myself to the devil , ”
21738	21742	21744	21744	Auriol	93	“ You here ? ”
21746	21750	21752	21753	the stranger	599	“ Of course , ”
21755	21826	21752	21753	the stranger	599	“ I came to watch over your safety . You were in danger from those men . But you need not concern yourself more about them . I have your pocket - book , and the slip of paper that dropped from it . Here are both . Now let us talk on other matters . You have just parted from Ebba , and will see her again this evening . ”

21834	21838	21840	21841	the stranger	599	“ You will , ”
21844	21901	21840	21841	the stranger	599	“ Remember , your ten years ’ limit draws to a close . In a few days it will be at an end ; and if you renew it not , you will incur the penalty , and you know it to be terrible . With the means of renewal in your hands , why hesitate ? ”
21902	21911	21913	21913	Auriol	93	“ Because I will not sacrifice the girl , ”
21915	21922	21924	21925	the stranger	599	“ You can not help yourself , ”
21928	21938	21924	21925	the stranger	599	“ I command you to bring her to me . ”
21939	21946	21948	21948	Auriol	93	“ I persist in my refusal , ”
21950	21959	21961	21962	the stranger	599	“ It is useless to brave my power , ”
21964	21989	21961	21962	the stranger	599	“ A moon is just born . When it has attained its first quarter , Ebba shall be mine . Till then , farewell . ”
22233	22236	22265	22265	he	125	“ called , ”
22239	22243	22265	22265	he	125	“ first wig , ”
22259	22264	22265	22265	he	125	“ Ah , sir , ”
22279	22347	22265	22265	he	125	“ you have quite the face of the Chief Justice — quite the face of the chief — I do n’t recollect him ordering his first wig — that was a little before my time ; but I hope to live to see you chief , sir . Quite within your reach , if you choose to apply . Sure of it , sir — quite sure . ”
22828	22835	22840	22842	Mr. Tuffnell Trigge	125	“ as well as a Christian . ”
23222	23227	23201	23201	he	125	“ Pretty dear!—pretty dear ! ”
23228	23239	23241	23241	Trigge	125	“ Ah ! what ’s that ? Who is it ? ”
23243	23248	23250	23251	the magpie	804	“ Pretty dear!—pretty dear ! ”
23321	23326	23328	23329	the magpie	804	“ Pretty dear!—pretty dear ! ”
23331	23339	23341	23342	Mr. Trigge	125	“ I see nothing pretty about him , ”
23344	23366	23341	23342	Mr. Trigge	125	“ What a strange little fellow ! It would puzzle the Lord Chancellor himself to say what his age might be . ”
23403	23415	23417	23418	the barber	785	“ What do you want , my little friend , eh ? ”
23420	23425	23427	23428	the magpie	804	“ High wages!—high wages ! ”
23430	23437	23439	23441	the little man	809	“ Is this yours , sir ? ”
23451	23463	23465	23466	Mr. Trigge	125	“ Yes , yes , that ’s my advertisement , friend , ”
23468	23474	23465	23466	Mr. Trigge	125	“ But what of it ? ”
23524	23530	23532	23533	the gentleman	817	“ Take care , sir ! ”
23536	23544	23532	23533	the gentleman	817	“ What the devil are you about ? ”
23545	23562	23509	23509	he	131	“ Yes ! take care , sir , as Judge Learmouth observes to a saucy witness , ”
23564	23574	23532	23533	the gentleman	817	Trigge—”‘take care , or I ’ll commit you ! ’ ”
23575	23582	23584	23585	the gentleman	817	“ D — n Judge Learmouth ! ”
23588	23603	23584	23585	the gentleman	817	“ If I were a judge , I ’d hang such a careless fellow . ”
23604	23609	23532	23533	the gentleman	817	“ Sarve him right ! ”
23611	23615	23584	23585	the gentleman	817	Mag—“sarve him right ! ”
23616	23622	23624	23624	Watts	131	“ Beg pardon , sir , ”
23626	23635	23624	23624	Watts	131	“ I ’ll rectify you in a minute . ”
23636	23643	23645	23645	Trigge	125	“ Well , my little friend , ”
23647	23678	23645	23645	Trigge	125	“ and what may be your object in coming to me ? as the great conveyancer , Mr. Plodwell , observes to his clients — what may be your object ? ”
23679	23691	23693	23695	the little man	809	“ You want an assistant , do n’t you , sir ? ”
23698	23714	23716	23716	Trigge	125	“ Do you apply on your own account , or on behalf of a friend ? ”
23718	23723	23725	23727	the little man	809	“ On my own , ”
23729	23735	23725	23727	the little man	809	“ What are your qualifications ? ”
23737	23742	23755	23757	the little man	809	Trigge—“what are your qualifications ? ”
23743	23753	23755	23757	the little man	809	“ I fancy I understand something of the business , ”
23759	23777	23755	23757	the little man	809	“ I was a perruquier myself , when wigs were more in fashion than they are now . ”
23778	23783	23785	23785	Trigge	125	“ Ha ! indeed ! ”
23789	23807	23785	23785	Trigge	125	“ That must have been in the last century — in Queen Anne ’s time — eh ? ”
23808	23817	23819	23821	the little man	809	“ You have hit it exactly , sir , ”
23823	23832	23819	23821	the little man	809	“ It was in Queen Anne ’s time . ”
23833	23847	23849	23850	Mr. Trigge	125	“ Perhaps you recollect when wigs were first worn , my little Nestor ? ”
23852	23855	23857	23859	the little man	809	“ Perfectly , ”
23861	23874	23857	23859	the little man	809	“ French periwigs were first worn in Charles the Second ’s time . ”
23875	23883	23885	23886	the barber	785	“ You saw ’em , of course ? ”
23892	23896	23898	23900	the little man	809	“ I did , ”
23903	23914	23916	23916	Trigge	125	“ Oh , he must be out of his mind , ”
23918	23939	23916	23916	Trigge	125	“ We shall have a commission de lunatico to issue here , as the Master of the Rolls would observe . ”
23940	23950	23952	23954	the little man	809	“ I hope I may suit you , sir , ”
23956	23967	23969	23970	Mr. Trigge	125	“ I do n’t think you will , my friend , ”
23972	24033	23969	23970	Mr. Trigge	125	“ I do n’t think you will . You do n’t seem to have a hand for hairdressing . Are you aware of the talent the art requires ? Are you aware what it has cost me to earn the enviable title of the Barber of London ? I ’m as proud of that title as if I were — — ”
24034	24039	24041	24041	Mag	139	“ Lord Chancellor!—Lord Chancellor ! ”
24043	24048	24050	24051	Mr. Trigge	125	“ Precisely , Mag , ”
24053	24061	24050	24051	Mr. Trigge	125	“ as if I were Lord Chancellor . ”
24062	24071	24073	24075	the little man	809	“ Well , I ’m sorry for it , ”
24078	24082	24084	24084	Mag	139	“ Pretty dear ! ”
24086	24090	24084	24084	Mag	139	“ pretty dear ! ”
24091	24100	24102	24106	the sour - looking gentleman	802	“ What a wonderful bird you have got ! ”
24114	24123	24102	24106	the sour - looking gentleman	802	“ I declare its answers are quite appropriate . ”
24124	24139	24141	24142	the barber	785	“ Ah ! Mag is a clever creature , sir — that she is , ”
24144	24153	24141	24142	the barber	785	“ I gave a good deal for her . ”
24154	24159	24102	24106	the sour - looking gentleman	802	“ Little or nothing ! ”
24161	24165	24176	24177	the gentleman	817	Mag—“little or nothing ! ”
24166	24174	24176	24177	the gentleman	817	“ What is your name , friend ? ”
24191	24205	24206	24206	he	809	“ Why , sir , I ’ve had many names in my time , ”
24209	24238	24206	24206	he	809	“ At one time I was called Flapdragon — at another , Old Parr — but my real name , I believe , is Morse — Gregory Morse . ”
24239	24245	24247	24248	Mr. Trigge	125	“ An Old Bailey answer , ”
24254	24268	24251	24251	his	125	“ Flapdragon , alias Old Parr — alias Gregory Morse — alias — — ”
24269	24273	24275	24275	Mag	139	“ Pretty dear ! ”
24277	24284	24286	24290	the sour - looking gentleman	802	“ And you want a place ? ”
24296	24299	24301	24301	Morse	141	“ Sadly , ”
24303	24311	24313	24314	the gentleman	817	“ Well , then , follow me , ”
24316	24328	24313	24314	the gentleman	817	“ and I ’ll see what can be done for you . ”
24519	24534	24536	24536	Ebba	114	“ Oh ! how different you are from what you were a week ago , ”
24539	24553	24536	24536	Ebba	114	“ Promise me not to indulge in any more of those gloomy fancies . ”
24554	24573	24574	24574	he	93	“ I will not indulge in them if I can help it , rest assured , sweet Ebba , ”
24577	24598	24574	24574	he	93	“ But my spirits are not always under my control . I am surprised at my own cheerfulness this evening . ”
24599	24606	24607	24607	she	114	“ I never felt so happy , ”
24610	24663	24607	24607	she	114	“ and the whole scene is in unison with my feelings . How soothing is the calm river flowing at our feet!—how tender is the warm sky , still flushed with red , though the sun has set!—And see , yonder hangs the crescent moon . She is in her first quarter . ”
24664	24672	24674	24674	Auriol	93	“ The moon in her first quarter ! ”
24682	24688	24674	24674	Auriol	93	“ All then is over . ”
24689	24696	24698	24698	Ebba	114	“ What means this sudden change ? ”
24705	24710	24711	24711	he	93	“ Oh , Ebba , ”
24714	24779	24711	24711	he	93	“ I must leave you . I have allowed myself to dream of happiness too long . I am an accursed being , doomed only to bring misery upon those who love me . I warned you on the onset , but you would not believe me . Let me go , and perhaps it may not yet be too late to save you . ”
24780	24789	24791	24791	Ebba	114	“ Oh no , do not leave me ! ”
24793	24804	24791	24791	Ebba	114	“ I have no fear while you are with me . ”
24805	24819	24820	24820	he	843	“ But you do not know the terrible fate I am linked to , ”
24823	24834	24820	24820	he	843	“ This is the night when it will be accomplished . ”
24835	24852	24853	24853	she	844	“ Your moody fancies do not alarm me as they used to do , dear Auriol , ”
24856	24878	24879	24879	she	844	“ because I know them to be the fruit of a diseased imagination . Come , let us continue our walk , ”
24887	24890	24891	24891	he	843	“ Ebba , ”
24894	24917	24891	24891	he	843	“ I implore you to let me go ! I have not the power to tear myself away unless you aid me . ”
24918	24926	24927	24927	she	844	“ I ’m glad to hear it , ”
24930	24939	24927	24927	she	844	“ for then I shall hold you fast . ”
24940	24948	24950	24950	Auriol	93	“ You know not what you do ! ”
24952	24961	24950	24950	Auriol	93	“ Release me ! oh , release me ! ”
24962	24973	24974	24974	she	844	“ In a few moments the fit will be passed , ”
24977	24985	24974	24974	she	844	“ Let us walk towards the abbey . ”
24986	24996	24998	24998	Auriol	93	“ It is in vain to struggle against fate , ”
25321	25327	25329	25329	Ebba	114	“ What a strange place ! ”
25337	25357	25329	25329	Ebba	114	“ It looks like a spot one reads of in romance . I wonder where that trap leads to ? ”
25358	25367	25369	25369	Auriol	93	“ Into the vault beneath , no doubt , ”
25371	25379	25369	25369	Auriol	93	“ But why did we come hither ? ”
25401	25408	25410	25410	Auriol	93	“ Did you hear that sound ? ”
25412	25425	25426	25426	she	114	“ It was nothing but the echo of laughter from the street , ”
25429	25438	25426	25426	she	114	“ You alarm yourself without reason , Auriol . ”
25439	25446	25447	25447	he	93	“ No , not without reason , ”
25450	25508	25447	25447	he	93	“ I am in the power of a terrible being , who seeks to destroy you , and I know that he is at hand . Listen to me , Ebba , and however strange my recital may appear , do not suppose it the ravings of a madman , but be assured it is the truth . ”
25509	25512	25426	25426	she	114	“ Beware ! ”
25527	25532	25534	25534	Ebba	114	“ Some one spoke , ”
25536	25550	25534	25534	Ebba	114	“ I begin to share your apprehensions . Let us quit this place . ”
25551	25556	25558	25558	Auriol	93	“ Come , then , ”
25560	25565	25558	25558	Auriol	93	“ Not so fast , ”
25586	25593	25595	25596	the stranger	599	“ Ebba , you are mine , ”
25598	25606	25595	25596	the stranger	599	“ Auriol has brought you to me . ”
25607	25612	25614	25614	Auriol	93	“ It is false ! ”
25616	25625	25614	25614	Auriol	93	“ I never will yield her to you . ”
25626	25631	25633	25634	the stranger	599	“ Remember your compact , ”
25641	25646	25648	25648	Ebba	114	“ Oh , Auriol ! ”
25650	25667	25648	25648	Ebba	114	“ I fear for your soul . You have not made a compact with this fiend ? ”
25668	25672	25674	25675	the stranger	599	“ He has , ”
25677	25688	25674	25675	the stranger	599	“ and by that compact you are surrendered to me . ”
25713	25719	25721	25721	Auriol	93	“ You shall not go ! ”
25726	25736	25721	25721	Auriol	93	“ Release her , or I renounce you wholly . ”
25737	25740	25742	25743	the stranger	599	“ Fool ! ”
25745	25756	25742	25743	the stranger	599	“ since you provoke my wrath , take your doom . ”
25833	25848	25820	25820	he	599	Auriol—“Behold ! the moon is in her first quarter . My words are fulfilled ! ”
26076	26089	26091	26091	Loftus	143	“ By Jove ! what a noble statue that is , Morse ! ”
26097	26106	26091	26091	Loftus	143	“ The horse is magnificent — positively magnificent . ”
26107	26138	26140	26140	Morse	141	“ I recollect when the spot was occupied by a gibbet , and when , in lieu of a statue , an effigy of the martyred monarch was placed there , ”
26142	26152	26091	26091	Loftus	143	“ That was in the time of the Protectorate . ”
26153	26167	26169	26169	Loftus	143	“ You can not get those dreams out of your head , Morse , ”
26173	26190	26169	26169	Loftus	143	“ I wish I could persuade myself I had lived for two centuries and a half . ”
26191	26222	26224	26224	Morse	141	“ Would you could have seen the ancient cross , which once stood there , erected by Edward the First to his beloved wife , ‘ Eleanor of Castile ’ ! ”
26233	26275	26224	26224	Morse	141	“ It was much mutilated when I remember it ; some of the pinnacles were broken , and the foliage defaced , but the statues of the queen were still standing in the recesses ; and altogether the effect was beautiful . ”
26276	26283	26285	26285	Loftus	143	“ It must have been charming , ”
26291	26324	26285	26285	Loftus	143	“ and , though I like the statue , I would much rather have had the old Gothic cross . But how fortunate the former escaped destruction in Oliver Cromwell ’s time ! ”
26325	26338	26340	26340	Morse	141	“ I can tell you how that came to pass , sir , ”
26342	26361	26340	26340	Morse	141	“ for I was assistant to John Rivers , the brazier , to whom the statue was sold . ”
26362	26367	26369	26369	Loftus	143	“ Ah ! indeed ! ”
26371	26388	26369	26369	Loftus	143	“ I have heard something of the story , but should like to have full particulars . ”
26389	26397	26399	26399	Morse	141	“ You shall hear them , then , ”
26401	26669	26399	26399	Morse	141	“ Yon statue , which , as you know , was cast by Hubert le Sueur , in 1633 , was ordered by Parliament to be sold and broken to pieces . Well , my master , John Rivers , being a stanch Royalist , though he did not dare to avow his principles , determined to preserve it from destruction . Accordingly , he offered a good round sum for it , and was declared the purchaser . But how to dispose of it was the difficulty ? He could trust none of his men but me , whom he knew to be as hearty a hater of the Roundheads , and as loyal to the memory of our slaughtered sovereign , as himself . Well , we digged a great pit , secretly , in the cellar , whither the statue had been conveyed , and buried it . The job occupied us nearly a month ; and during that time , my master collected together all the pieces of old brass he could procure . These he afterwards produced , and declared they were the fragments of the statue . But the cream of the jest was to come . He began to cast handles of knives and forks in brass , giving it out that they were made from the metal of the statue . And plenty of ’em he sold too , for the Cavaliers bought ’em as memorials of their martyred monarch , and the Roundheads as evidences of his fall . In this way he soon got back his outlay . ”
26670	26677	26679	26679	Loftus	143	“ Ha ! ha ! ha ! ”
26681	26691	26679	26679	Loftus	143	“ Well , in due season came the Restoration , ”
26695	26740	26679	26679	Loftus	143	“ and my master made known to King Charles the Second the treasure he had kept concealed for him . It was digged forth , placed in its old position — but I forget whether the brazier was rewarded . I rather think not . ”
26741	26745	26747	26747	Loftus	143	“ No matter , ”
26749	26778	26747	26747	Loftus	143	“ he was sufficiently rewarded by the consciousness of having done a noble action . But let us go and examine the sculpture on the pedestal more closely . ”
26829	26844	26846	26847	the dwarf	479	“ You are aware that this is the work of Grinling Gibbons , sir ? ”
26849	26856	26846	26847	the dwarf	479	“ To be sure I am , ”
26858	26875	26846	26847	the dwarf	479	Loftus—“to be sure . What fancy and gusto is displayed in the treatment of these trophies ! ”
26876	26887	26889	26889	Morse	141	“ The execution of the royal arms is equally admirable , ”
26891	26897	26889	26889	Morse	141	“ Never saw anything finer , ”
26899	26905	26846	26847	the dwarf	479	Loftus—“never , upon my life . ”
27008	27012	27014	27017	the street - sweeper	885	“ My eyes ! ”

27706	27710	27712	27712	Loftus	143	“ Grinling Gibbons , ”
27718	27748	27712	27712	Loftus	143	“ Horace Walpole said that no one before him could give to wood the airy lightness of a flower , and here he has given it to a stone . ”
27749	27761	27763	27765	the stout gentleman	904	“ This may be all very fine , my good fellow , ”
27773	27793	27763	27765	the stout gentleman	904	“ but do n’t you see the crowd you ’re collecting round you ? You ’ll be mobbed presently . ”

27817	27827	27829	27832	the iron - merchant	561	“ Come along , and I ’ll tell you , ”
27845	27855	27857	27857	Thorneycroft	114	“ I ’m so glad to have met you , ”
27869	27885	27857	27857	Thorneycroft	114	“ you ’ll be shocked to hear what has happened to your niece , Ebba . ”
27886	27895	27897	27897	Loftus	143	“ Why , what has happened to her ? ”
27899	27918	27897	27897	Loftus	143	“ You alarm me . Out with it at once . I hate to be kept in suspense . ”
27919	27925	27857	27857	Thorneycroft	114	“ She has left me , ”
27927	27936	27897	27897	Loftus	143	Thorneycroft—“left her old indulgent father — run away . ”
27937	27941	27943	27943	Loftus	143	“ Run away ! ”
27945	27959	27943	27943	Loftus	143	“ Impossible ! I ’ll not believe it — even from your lips . ”
27960	27974	27976	27976	Thorneycroft	114	“ Would it were not so!—but it is , alas ! too true , ”
27979	28011	27976	27976	Thorneycroft	114	“ And the thing was so unnecessary , for I would gladly have given her to the young man . My sole hope is that she has not utterly disgraced herself . ”
28012	28023	28025	28025	Loftus	143	“ No , she is too high principled for that , ”
28027	28042	28025	28025	Loftus	143	“ Rest easy on that score . But with whom has she run away ? ”
28043	28052	28054	28054	Thorneycroft	114	“ With a young man named Auriol Darcy , ”
28056	28067	28054	28054	Thorneycroft	114	“ He was brought to my house under peculiar circumstances . ”
28068	28075	28077	28077	Loftus	143	“ I never heard of him , ”
28079	28084	28077	28077	Loftus	143	“ But I have , ”
28088	28098	28086	28086	Morse	141	“ I ’ve known him these two hundred years . ”
28099	28107	28109	28109	Thorneycroft	114	“ Eh day ! who ’s this ? ”
28111	28126	28128	28128	Loftus	143	“ A crack - brained little fellow , whom I ’ve engaged as valet , ”
28130	28142	28128	28128	Loftus	143	“ He fancies he was born in Queen Elizabeth ’s time . ”
28143	28149	28151	28151	Morse	141	“ It ’s no fancy , ”
28153	28173	28151	28151	Morse	141	“ I am perfectly acquainted with Auriol Darcy ’s history . He drank of the same elixir as myself . ”
28174	28190	28192	28192	Thorneycroft	114	“ If you know him , can you give us a clue to find him ? ”
28194	28202	28204	28204	Morse	141	“ I am sorry I can not , ”
28206	28236	28204	28204	Morse	141	“ I only saw him for a few minutes the other night , after I had been thrown into the Serpentine by the tall man in the black cloak . ”
28237	28244	28246	28246	Thorneycroft	114	“ What ’s that you say ? ”
28249	28282	28246	28246	Thorneycroft	114	“ I have heard Ebba speak of a tall man in a black cloak having some mysterious connection with Auriol . I hope that person has nothing to do with her disappearance . ”
28283	28292	28294	28294	Morse	141	“ I should n’t wonder if he had , ”
28296	28306	28294	28294	Morse	141	“ I believe that black gentleman to be — — ”
28307	28310	28312	28312	Thorneycroft	114	“ What!—who ? ”
28314	28323	28325	28325	Morse	141	“ Neither more nor less than the devil , ”
28328	28333	28335	28335	Loftus	143	“ Pshaw ! poh ! ”
28337	28348	28335	28335	Loftus	143	“ I told you the poor fellow was half cracked . ”
28397	28404	28392	28392	his	909	“ Mr. Thorneycroft , I believe ? ”
28405	28413	28415	28418	the iron - merchant	561	“ My name is Thorneycroft , fellow ! ”
28424	28435	28415	28418	the iron - merchant	561	“ And your name , I fancy , is Ginger ? ”
28436	28441	28443	28446	the dog - fancier	507	“ Exactly , sir , ”
28453	28478	28443	28446	the dog - fancier	507	“ ex - actly . I did n’t think you would rekilect me , sir . I bring you some news of your darter . ”
28479	28483	28485	28485	Thorneycroft	86	“ Of Ebba ! ”
28494	28502	28485	28485	Thorneycroft	86	“ I hope your news is good . ”
28503	28520	28522	28525	the dog - fancier	507	“ I wish it wos better , for her sake as well as yours , sir , ”
28528	28540	28522	28525	the dog - fancier	507	“ but I ’m afeerd she ’s in werry bad hands . ”
28541	28558	28560	28560	Morse	141	“ That she is , if she ’s in the hands o ’ the black gentleman , ”
28562	28573	28575	28575	Ginger	92	“ Vy , Old Parr , that ai n’t you ? ”
28583	28596	28575	28575	Ginger	92	“ Vy , ‘ ow you are transmogrified , to be sure ! ”
28597	28604	28606	28606	Thorneycroft	86	“ But what of my daughter ? ”
28608	28625	28575	28575	Ginger	92	“ where is she ? Take me to her , and you shall be well rewarded . ”
28626	28645	28647	28647	Ginger	92	“ I ’ll do my best to take you to her , and without any reward , sir , ”
28649	28672	28647	28647	Ginger	92	“ for my heart bleeds for the poor young creater . As I said afore , she ’s in dreadful bad hands . ”
28673	28682	28684	28684	Thorneycroft	86	“ Do you allude to Mr. Auriol Darcy ? ”
28686	28703	28705	28705	Ginger	92	“ No , he ’s as much a wictim of this infernal plot as your darter , ”
28707	28732	28705	28705	Ginger	92	“ I thought him quite different at first — but I ’ve altered my mind entirely since some matters has come to my knowledge . ”
28733	28743	28745	28745	Thorneycroft	86	“ You alarm me greatly by these dark hints , ”
28747	28754	28745	28745	Thorneycroft	86	“ What is to be done ? ”
28755	28764	28766	28766	Ginger	92	“ I shall know in a few hours , ”
28768	28818	28766	28766	Ginger	92	“ I ai n’t got the exact clue yet . But come to me at eleven o’clock to - night , at the Turk ’s Head , at the back o ’ Shoreditch Church , and I ’ll put you on the right scent . You must come alone . ”
28819	28837	28839	28839	Thorneycroft	86	“ I should wish this gentleman , my brother - in - law , to accompany me , ”
28841	28848	28850	28850	Ginger	92	“ He could n’t help you , ”
28852	28916	28850	28850	Ginger	92	“ I ’ll take care to have plenty of assistance . It ’s a dangerous bus’ness , and can only be managed in a sartin way , and by a sartin person , and he ’d object to any von but you . To - night , at eleven ! Good - bye , Old Parr . Ve shall meet again ere long . ”
29047	29055	29057	29057	Ginger	92	“ You are punctual , Mr. Thorneycroft , ”
29069	29109	29057	29057	Ginger	92	“ and I ’m happy to say , I ’ve arranged everythin ’ for you , sir . My friends are ready to undertake the job . Only they von’t do it on quite sich easy terms as mine . ”
29129	29142	29144	29144	Ginger	92	“ As I said to you this mornin ’ , Mr. Thorneycroft , ”
29146	29181	29144	29144	Ginger	92	“ this is a difficult and a dangerous bus’ness , and there ’s no knowin ’ wot may come on it . But it ’s your only chance o ’ recoverin ’ your darter . ”
29182	29191	29193	29194	the Tinker	246	“ Yes , it ’s your only chance , ”
29196	29209	29211	29212	the Sandman	247	“ Ve’re about to risk our precious lives for you , sir , ”
29214	29226	29211	29212	the Sandman	247	“ so , in coorse , ve expects a perportionate revard . ”
29227	29244	29246	29249	the iron - merchant	561	“ If you enable me to regain my daughter , you shall not find me ungrateful , ”
29251	29259	29261	29262	the Tinker—“that	1963	“ I must have a hundred pounds , ”
29262	29267	29211	29212	the Sandman	247	Tinker—“that ’s my lowest . ”
29268	29274	29276	29277	the Sandman	247	“ And mine , too , ”
29279	29294	29296	29296	Ginger	92	“ I shall take nuffin ’ but the glory , as I said afore , ”
29298	29319	29296	29296	Ginger	92	“ I ’m sworn champion o ’ poor distressed young damsils ; but my friends must make their own bargins . ”
29320	29326	29211	29212	the Sandman	247	“ Well , I assent , ”
29331	29341	29328	29329	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ and the sooner we set out the better . ”
29342	29347	29349	29349	Ginger	92	“ Are you armed ? ”
29351	29362	29364	29364	Thorneycroft	86	“ I have a brace of pistols in my pocket , ”
29366	29379	29381	29381	Ginger	92	“ All right , then — ve’ve all got pops and cutlashes , ”
29383	29390	29381	29381	Ginger	92	“ So let ’s be off . ”
29447	29452	29453	29453	he	86	“ Who is this ? ”
29459	29463	29465	29465	Ginger	92	“ A friend , ”
29467	29491	29465	29465	Ginger	92	“ Vithout him ve could do nuffin ’ . His name is Reeks , and he is the chief man in our enterprise . ”
29492	29502	29504	29504	Thorneycroft	86	“ He claims a reward too , I suppose ? ”
29506	29519	29521	29521	Reeks	164	“ I will tell you what reward I claim , Mr. Thorneycroft , ”
29529	29558	29521	29521	Reeks	164	“ when all is over . Meantime , give me your solemn pledge , that whatever you may behold to - night , you will not divulge it . ”
29559	29564	29566	29569	the iron - merchant	561	“ I give it , ”
29571	29576	29566	29569	the iron - merchant	561	“ provided always — — ”

29589	29620	29585	29587	the other quickly	937	“ You must swear to keep silence unconditionally , or I will not move a footstep with you ; and I alone can guide you where your daughter is detained . ”
29621	29632	29634	29634	Ginger	92	“ Svear , sir ; it is your only chance , ”
29636	29651	29653	29654	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Well , if it must be , I do swear to keep silence , ”
29656	29664	29653	29654	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ but your proceedings appear very mysterious . ”
29665	29672	29674	29674	Reeks	164	“ The whole affair is mysterious , ”
29676	29696	29674	29674	Reeks	164	“ You must also consent to have a bandage passed over your eyes when you get into the coach . ”
29697	29701	29703	29706	the iron - merchant	561	“ Anything more ? ”
29708	29727	29729	29729	Reeks	164	“ You must engage to obey my orders , without questioning , when we arrive at our destination , ”
29731	29741	29729	29729	Reeks	164	“ Otherwise , there is no chance of success . ”
29742	29749	29751	29751	Thorneycroft	86	“ Be it as you will , ”
29753	29759	29751	29751	Thorneycroft	86	“ I must perforce agree . ”
29760	29767	29769	29769	Reeks	164	“ All then is clearly understood , ”
29771	29779	29769	29769	Reeks	164	“ and we can now set out . ”

30088	30100	30102	30102	Thorneycroft	86	“ I will deliver her , or perish in the attempt , ”
30115	30122	30124	30124	Reeks	164	“ Now then , follow me , ”
30126	30133	30124	30124	Reeks	164	“ and act as I direct . ”

31424	31435	31422	31422	Ebba	114	“ If so , I am equally culpable with you . ”

31449	31456	31458	31460	the agonised girl	993	“ Heaven have mercy upon me ! ”
31479	31489	31470	31476	a terrible voice from behind the curtain	994	“ Sign , or Auriol is lost for ever . ”
31490	31503	31505	31505	Ebba	114	“ I can not yield my soul , even to save him , ”
31508	31515	31517	31518	the voice	995	“ Witness his chastisement , then , ”
31557	31570	31572	31572	Auriol	93	“ Do not yield to the demands of this fiend , Ebba ! ”
31579	31595	31597	31598	the voice	995	“ Will you save him before he is cast , living , into the tomb ? ”
31636	31647	31649	31650	the voice	995	“ There he will be immured , unless you sign , ”
31652	31668	31649	31650	the voice	995	“ and , as he is immortal , he will endure an eternity of torture . ”
31669	31683	31685	31685	Ebba	114	“ I can not save him so , but I may precede him , ”
31807	31810	31812	31812	Auriol	93	“ Ebba ! ”
31820	31825	31812	31812	Auriol	93	“ Is it you ? ”
31836	31839	31841	31842	the voice	995	“ Sign ! ”
31844	31861	31841	31842	the voice	995	“ Your attempt at self - destruction has placed you wholly in my power . Sign ! ”
31940	31945	31947	31948	the voice	995	“ All is accomplished , ”
31950	31955	31947	31948	the voice	995	“ Away with him ! ”
32397	32405	32428	32430	the young man	298	“ Cyprianus de Rougemont , Fra . R.C. ”
32491	32499	32500	32500	he	298	“ Dost hear me , old ancestor ? ”
32503	32664	32669	32669	he	1029	“ I , thy descendant , Cyprian de Rougemont , call upon thee to point out where thy gold is hidden ? I know that thou wert a brother of the Rosy Cross — one of the illuminati — and didst penetrate the mysteries of nature , and enter the region of light . I know , also , that thou wert buried in this house with a vast treasure ; but though I have made diligent search for it , and others have searched before me , thy grave has never yet been discovered ! Listen to me ! Methought Satan appeared to me in a dream last night , and bade me come hither , and I should find what I sought . The conditions he proposed were , that I should either give him my own soul , or win him that of Auriol Darcy . I assented . I am here . Where is thy treasure ? ”
32684	32711	32669	32669	he	1029	“ Dost hear me , I say , old ancestor ? I call on thee to give me thy treasure . Dost hear , I say ? ”
32743	32748	32750	32750	Rougemont	167	“ What is this ? ”
32761	32768	32750	32750	Rougemont	167	“ Ha!—my invocation has been heard ! ”
32830	32844	32846	32846	Rougemont	167	“ This , then , is the entrance to my ancestor ’s tomb , ”
32848	32900	32846	32846	Rougemont	167	“ there can be no doubt of it . The old Rosicrucian has kept his secret well ; but the devil has helped me to wrest it from him . And now to procure the necessary implements , in case , as is not unlikely , I should experience further difficulty . ”
32991	33002	32985	32985	he	167	“ In two hundred and fifty years I shall open ! ”
33006	33060	32985	32985	he	167	“ and the date 1550 — why , the exact time is arrived . Old Cyprian must have foreseen what would happen , and evidently intended to make me his heir . There was no occasion for the devil ’s interference . And see , the key is in the lock . So ! ”
33478	33487	33488	33488	he	167	“ Here , then , old Cyprian lies , ”
33756	33759	33760	33760	he	167	“ Aha ! ”
33767	33824	33760	33760	he	167	“ I see now the cause of my extraordinary dream . My ancestor ’s wondrous power was of infernal origin — the result , in fact , of a compact with the Prince of Darkness . But what care I for that ? Give me wealth — no matter what source it comes from!—ha ! ha ! ”
33888	33896	33897	33897	he	167	“ At length I have my wish , ”
33900	34029	33897	33897	he	167	“ Boundless wealth , and therefore boundless power , is mine . I can riot in pleasure — riot in vengeance . As to my soul , I will run the risk of its perdition ; but it shall go hard if I destroy not that of Auriol . His love of play and his passion for Edith Talbot shall be the means by which I will work . But I must not neglect another agent which is offered me . That bottle , I have learnt from yon volume , contains an infernal potion , which , without destroying life , shatters the brain , and creates maddening fancies . It will well serve my purpose ; and I thank thee , Satan , for the gift . ”
34079	34092	34094	34099	the person who had checked him	1043	“ It is useless to meditate self - destruction , Auriol Darcy , ”
34101	34117	34094	34099	the person who had checked him	1043	“ If you find life a burden , I can make it tolerable to you . ”
34146	34152	34153	34153	he	93	“ Leave me , Rougemont ! ”
34157	34204	34153	34153	he	93	“ I want no society — above all , not yours . You know very well that you have ruined me , and that nothing more is to be got from me . Leave me , I say , or I may do you a mischief . ”
34205	34217	34219	34219	Rougemont	167	“ Tut , tut , Auriol , I am your friend ! ”
34221	34229	34219	34219	Rougemont	167	“ I purpose to relieve your distress . ”
34230	34244	34246	34246	Auriol	93	“ Will you give me back the money you have won from me ? ”
34248	34264	34246	34246	Auriol	93	“ Will you pay my inexorable creditors ? Will you save me from a prison ? ”
34265	34275	34277	34277	Rougemont	167	“ I will do all this , and more , ”
34279	34292	34277	34277	Rougemont	167	“ I will make you one of the richest men in London . ”
34293	34301	34303	34303	Auriol	93	“ Spare your insulting jests , sir , ”
34305	34315	34303	34303	Auriol	93	“ I am in no mood to bear them . ”
34316	34322	34324	34324	Rougemont	167	“ I am not jesting , ”
34326	34340	34341	34341	Auriol	93	“ Come with me , and you shall be convinced of my sincerity . ”
34382	34388	34389	34389	he	93	“ Do you live here ? ”
34392	34397	34399	34399	Rougemont	167	“ Ask no questions , ”
34508	34521	34505	34505	Auriol	93	“ Is it to mock me that you have brought me hither ? ”
34522	34529	34531	34531	Rougemont	167	“ To mock you — no , ”
34533	34560	34566	34566	he	167	“ I have told you that I mean to make you rich . But you look greatly exhausted . A glass of wine will revive you . ”
34586	34599	34600	34600	he	167	“ Taste this wine — it has been long in our family , ”
34607	34616	34618	34618	Auriol	93	“ It is a strange , bewildering drink , ”
34634	34648	34650	34650	Rougemont	167	“ You have taken it upon an empty stomach — that is all , ”
34652	34659	34650	34650	Rougemont	167	“ You will be better anon . ”
34660	34670	34672	34672	Auriol	93	“ I feel as if I were going mad , ”
34674	34685	34672	34672	Auriol	93	“ It is some damnable potion you have given me . ”
34686	34691	34693	34693	Rougemont	167	“ Ha ! ha ! ”
34695	34708	34693	34693	Rougemont	167	“ It reminds you of the elixir you once quaffed — eh ? ”
34709	34716	34718	34718	Auriol	93	“ A truce to this raillery ! ”
34721	34734	34718	34718	Auriol	93	“ I have said I am in no mood to bear it . ”
34735	34743	34749	34749	his	244	“ Pshaw ! I mean no offence , ”
34752	34760	34749	34749	his	244	“ What think you of this house ? ”
34761	34767	34769	34769	Auriol	93	“ That it is magnificent , ”
34774	34781	34769	34769	Auriol	93	“ I envy you its possession . ”
34782	34792	34794	34794	Rougemont	167	“ It shall be yours , if you please , ”
34796	34805	34794	34794	Rougemont	167	“ Mine ! you are mocking me again . ”
34806	34823	34749	34749	his	244	“ Not in the least . You shall buy it from me , if you please . ”
34824	34829	34831	34831	Auriol	93	“ At what price ? ”
34834	34843	34845	34846	the other	244	“ At a price you can easily pay , ”
34848	34860	34845	34846	the other	244	“ Come this way , and we will conclude the bargain . ”
34902	34921	34923	34923	Rougemont	167	“ It were a fruitless boon to give you this house without the means of living in it , ”
34930	34941	34923	34923	Rougemont	167	“ This pocket - book will furnish you with them . ”
34942	34949	34951	34951	Auriol	93	“ Notes to an immense amount ! ”
34965	34975	34977	34977	Rougemont	167	“ They are yours , together with the house , ”
34979	34990	34977	34977	Rougemont	167	“ if you will but sign a compact with me . ”
34991	34995	34997	34997	Auriol	93	“ A compact ! ”
35008	35015	34997	34997	Auriol	93	“ Who and what are you ? ”
35016	35025	35027	35027	Rougemont	167	“ Some men would call me the devil ! ”
35030	35057	35027	35027	Rougemont	167	“ But you know me too well to suppose that I merit such a designation . I offer you wealth . What more could you require ? ”
35058	35064	35066	35066	Auriol	93	“ But upon what terms ? ”
35068	35073	35075	35076	the other	244	“ The easiest imaginable , ”
35078	35085	35088	35088	he	167	“ You shall judge for yourself . ”
35108	35112	35113	35113	he	167	“ Sit down , ”
35116	35121	35113	35113	he	167	“ and read this . ”
35175	35182	35183	35183	he	93	“ Then you are the Fiend ? ”
35186	35196	35198	35199	the other	244	“ If you will have it so — certainly , ”
35201	35215	35217	35217	Auriol	93	“ You are Satan in the form of the man I once knew , ”
35219	35230	35217	35217	Auriol	93	“ Avaunt ! I will have no dealings with you . ”
35231	35246	35248	35249	the other	244	“ I thought you wiser than to indulge in such idle fears , Darcy , ”
35251	35273	35248	35249	the other	244	“ Granting even your silly notion of me to be correct , why need you be alarmed ? You are immortal . ”
35274	35277	35279	35279	Auriol	93	“ True , ”
35282	35287	35279	35279	Auriol	93	“ but yet — — ”
35288	35291	35293	35294	the other	244	“ Pshaw ! ”
35296	35306	35293	35294	the other	244	“ sign , and have done with the matter . ”
35307	35329	35331	35331	Auriol	93	“ By this compact I am bound to deliver a victim — a female victim — whenever you shall require it , ”
35333	35336	35338	35339	the other	244	“ Precisely , ”
35341	35352	35338	35339	the other	244	“ you can have no difficulty in fulfilling that condition . ”
35353	35367	35293	35294	the other	244	“ But if I fail in doing so , I am doomed — — ”
35368	35375	35377	35378	the other	244	“ But you will not fail , ”
35388	35393	35377	35378	the other	244	“ Now sign it . ”
35407	35420	35421	35421	he	93	“ I shall bring eternal destruction on myself if I sign it , ”
35424	35437	35439	35439	Rougemont	167	“ A stroke of the pen will rescue you from utter ruin , ”
35446	35461	35439	35439	Rougemont	167	“ Riches and happiness are yours . You will not have such another chance . ”
35462	35465	35467	35467	Auriol	93	“ Tempter ! ”
35493	35502	35503	35503	he	93	“ I repent — give it me back ! ”
35519	35525	35527	35528	the latter	922	“ It is too late ! ”
35535	35543	35527	35528	the latter	922	“ You are mine — irredeemably mine . ”
35544	35547	35549	35549	Auriol	93	“ Ha ! ”
35557	35567	35569	35569	Rougemont	167	“ I leave you in possession of your house , ”
35571	35588	35569	35569	Rougemont	167	“ but I shall return in a week , when I shall require my first victim . ”
35589	35598	35600	35600	Auriol	93	“ Your first victim ! oh , Heaven ! ”
35602	35613	35615	35615	Rougemont	167	“ Ay , and my choice falls on Edith Talbot ! ”
35617	35621	35623	35623	Auriol	93	“ Edith Talbot ! ”
35625	35644	35623	35623	Auriol	93	“ she your victim ! Think you I would resign her I love better than life to you ? ”
35645	35658	35660	35660	Rougemont	167	“ It is because she loves you that I have chosen her , ”
35667	35715	35660	35660	Rougemont	167	“ And such will ever be the case with you . Seek not to love again , for your passion will be fatal to the object of it . When the week has elapsed , I shall require Edith at your hands . Till then , farewell ! ”
35716	35719	35721	35721	Auriol	93	“ Stay ! ”
35723	35744	35746	35746	he	93	“ I break the bargain with thee , fiend . I will have none of it . I abjure thee . ”
35836	35850	35852	35854	the hall porter	1073	“ And we hope nothing has occurred to alter your opinion , sir ? ”
35856	35865	35867	35867	Auriol	93	“ You are sure Mr. Rougemont is gone ? ”
35869	35877	35879	35881	the hall porter	1073	“ Oh , quite sure , sir , ”
35883	35902	35879	35881	the hall porter	1073	“ I helped him on with his cloak myself . He said he should return this day week . ”
35903	35913	35915	35915	Auriol	93	“ If he comes I will not see him , ”
35918	35938	35915	35915	Auriol	93	“ mind that . Deny me to him ; and on no account whatever let him enter the house . ”
35939	35947	35949	35950	the porter	886	“ Your orders shall be strictly obeyed , ”
35956	35961	35963	35963	Auriol	93	“ Now leave me , ”
35986	35997	35971	35971	he	93	“ All precautions are useless . I am indeed lost ! ”
36116	36150	36151	36151	he	93	exclaimed—“Yes , yes — all obstacles are now removed ! When Mr. Talbot finds I am become thus wealthy , he will no longer refuse me his daughter . But I am mad , ”
36156	36226	36151	36151	he	93	himself—“worse than mad , to indulge such hopes . If it be indeed the Fiend to whom I have sold myself , I have no help from perdition ! If it be man , I am scarcely less terribly fettered . In either case , I will not remain here longer ; nor will I avail myself of this accursed money , which has tempted me to my undoing . ”
36299	36308	36310	36312	the unseen speaker	1079	“ It will be in vain to fly , ”
36314	36379	36310	36312	the unseen speaker	1079	“ You can not escape me . Whether you remain here or not — whether you use the wealth I have given you , or leave it behind you — you can not annul your bargain . With this knowledge , you are at liberty to go . But remember , on the seventh night from this I shall require Edith Talbot from you ! ”
36380	36387	36389	36389	Auriol	93	“ Where are you , fiend ? ”
36395	36405	36472	36473	the voice	995	“ Show yourself , that I may confront you . ”
36418	36425	36427	36427	Auriol	93	“ Give me back the compact , ”
36430	36460	36427	36427	Auriol	93	“ It was signed in ignorance . I knew not the price I was to pay for your assistance . Wealth is of no value to me without Edith . ”
36461	36470	36472	36473	the voice	995	“ Without wealth you could not obtain her , ”
36475	36536	36472	36473	the voice	995	“ You are only , therefore , where you were . But you will think better of the bargain to - morrow . Meanwhile , I counsel you to place the money you have so unwisely cast from you safely under lock and key , and to seek repose . You will awaken with very different thoughts in the morning . ”
36537	36550	36552	36552	Auriol	93	“ How am I to account for my sudden accession of wealth ? ”
36558	36568	36570	36572	the unseen stranger	1081	“ You a gambler , and ask that question ! ”
36579	36661	36570	36572	the unseen stranger	1081	“ But I will make your mind easy on that score . As regards the house , you will find a regular conveyance of it within that writing - desk , while the note lying on the table , which bears your address , comes from me , and announces the payment of a hundred and twenty thousand pounds to you , as a debt of honour . You see I have provided against every difficulty . And now , farewell ! ”
36772	36786	36763	36763	he	93	“ It is useless to struggle further — I must yield to fate ! ”
37065	37078	37080	37080	Auriol	93	“ Show me to my bedroom — that is all I require , ”
37792	37802	37804	37804	Auriol	93	“ But we can be married before you go ? ”
37806	37812	37814	37815	Mr. Talbot	175	“ Scarcely , I fear , ”
37820	37860	37814	37815	Mr. Talbot	175	“ You must control your impatience , my dear young friend . On the sixth day from this — that is , on Wednesday in next week — we are now at Friday — you shall be made happy . ”
38112	38129	38131	38131	Auriol	93	“ You have heard , dear Edith , that your father has consented to our union ? ”
38154	38161	38145	38145	Edith	171	“ He has fixed Wednesday next , ”
38165	38198	38145	38145	Edith	171	“ but I wish an earlier day could have been named . I have a presentiment that if our marriage is so long delayed , it will not take place at all . ”
38199	38208	38209	38209	she	171	“ You are full of misgivings , Auriol , ”
38212	38217	38218	38218	he	93	“ I confess it , ”
38221	38250	38218	38218	he	93	“ and my apprehensions have risen to such a point , that I feel disposed to urge you to a private marriage , during your father ’s absence . ”
38251	38272	38273	38273	she	171	“ Oh no , Auriol ; much as I love you , I could never consent to such a step , ”
38276	38319	38218	38218	he	93	“ You can not urge me to it . I would not abuse my dear father ’s trusting love . I have never deceived him , and that is the best assurance I can give you that I shall never deceive you . ”
38561	38568	38569	38569	he	175	“ Well , here I am ! ”
38578	38599	38569	38569	he	175	“ without having encountered any misadventure . On the contrary , I have completed my business to my entire satisfaction . ”
38600	38614	38616	38616	Edith	171	“ Oh , how delighted I am to see you , dear papa ! ”
38618	38630	38616	38616	Edith	171	“ Now , Auriol , you can have no more apprehensions . ”
38631	38636	38638	38639	Mr. Talbot	175	“ Apprehensions of what ? ”
38641	38658	38660	38660	Auriol	93	“ Of some accident befalling you , which might have interfered with our happiness , sir , ”
38662	38672	38674	38675	Mr. Talbot	175	“ Oh , lovers are full of idle fears ! ”
38677	38722	38674	38675	Mr. Talbot	175	“ They are unreasonable beings . However , here I am , as I said before , safe and sound . To - morrow we will finish all preliminary arrangements , and the day after you shall be made happy — ha ! ha ! ”
38723	38752	38754	38754	Edith	171	“ Do you know , papa , Auriol intends to give a grand ball on our wedding - day , and has invited all his acquaintance to it ? ”
38756	38766	38768	38769	Mr. Talbot	175	“ I hope you have not invited Cyprian Rougemont ? ”
38775	38782	38784	38784	Auriol	93	“ I have not , sir , ”
38789	38797	38784	38784	Auriol	93	“ But why do you particularise him ? ”
38798	38813	38815	38816	Mr. Talbot	175	“ Because I have heard some things of him not much to his credit , ”
38818	38828	38830	38830	Auriol	93	“ What — what have you heard , sir ? ”
38832	38864	38866	38867	Mr. Talbot	175	“ Why , one should n’t believe all the ill one hears of a man ; and , indeed , I can not believe all I have heard of Cyprian Rougemont , ”
38869	38890	38866	38867	Mr. Talbot	175	“ but I should be glad if you dropped his acquaintance altogether . And now let us change the subject . ”
39002	39013	39015	39016	Mr. Talbot	175	“ You are a perfect man of honour , Auriol , ”
39024	39045	39015	39016	Mr. Talbot	175	“ and I hope Edith will make you an excellent wife . Indeed , I have no doubt of it . ”
39046	39054	39057	39057	Auriol	93	“ Nor I,—if I ever possess her , ”
39350	39364	39365	39365	he	93	“ Are you prepared to quit this gay scene with me , Edith ? ”
39375	39379	39380	39380	she	1142	“ Quite so , ”
39389	39398	39380	39380	she	1142	“ I long to be alone with you . ”
39399	39404	39406	39406	Auriol	93	“ Come , then , ”
39573	39580	39582	39582	Edith	171	“ Ha ! who is this ? ”
39659	39666	39668	39668	Rougemont	174	“ You thought to delude me , ”
39680	39696	39668	39668	Rougemont	174	“ but you counted without your host . I am come to claim my victim . ”
39697	39713	39715	39715	Edith	171	“ What is the matter with you , that you tremble so , dear Auriol ? ”
39717	39724	39715	39715	Edith	171	“ Who is this strange person ? ”
39741	39757	39759	39759	Rougemont	174	“ Your carriage waits for you at the door , madam — all is prepared , ”
39770	39777	39779	39790	Edith , who scarcely knew whether to draw back or go forward	1160	“ You are coming , Auriol ? ”
39792	39797	39799	39799	Auriol	93	“ Yes — yes , ”
39810	39823	39799	39799	Auriol	93	“ This is my friend , Mr. Rougemont — go with him . ”
39824	39828	39830	39830	Edith	171	“ Mr. Rougemont ! ”
39832	39843	39830	39830	Edith	171	“ You told my father he would not be here . ”
39844	39854	39856	39856	Rougemont	174	“ Your husband did not invite me , madam , ”
39862	39881	39856	39856	Rougemont	174	“ but knowing I should be welcome , I came unasked . But let us avoid those persons . ”
40076	40082	40084	40085	Mr. Talbot	175	“ What is the matter ? ”
40092	40119	40084	40085	Mr. Talbot	175	“ I came to bid you good - bye . Why do I find you here alone ? Where is the carriage?—what has become of Edith ? ”
40120	40138	40140	40140	Auriol	93	“ She is in the power of the Fiend , and I have sold her to him , ”
40143	40150	40152	40153	Mr. Talbot	175	“ What mean you , wretch ? ”
40161	40181	40152	40153	Mr. Talbot	175	“ I heard that Cyprian Rougemont was here . Can it be he that has gone off with her ? ”
40182	40189	40191	40191	Auriol	93	“ You have hit the truth , ”
40193	40213	40191	40191	Auriol	93	“ He bought her with the money I gave you . I have sold her and myself to perdition ! ”
40214	40217	40219	40221	the old man	1171	“ Horror ! ”
40226	40237	40239	40239	Auriol	93	“ Ay , breathe your last — breathe your last ! ”
40242	40253	40239	40239	Auriol	93	“ Would I could yield up my life , likewise ! ”
40647	40652	40653	40653	he	86	“ A singular room , ”
40663	40673	40653	40653	he	86	“ Did you expect to find any one here ? ”
40674	40679	40681	40682	the other	244	“ I hardly know , ”
40684	40707	40681	40682	the other	244	“ That bell may have given the alarm . But I will soon ascertain the point . Remain here till I return . ”
40708	40717	40719	40720	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ You are not going to leave us ? ”
40723	40729	40731	40731	Reeks	164	“ Only for a moment , ”
40733	40754	40731	40731	Reeks	164	“ Keep quiet , and no harm will befall you . Whatever you may hear without , do not stir . ”
40755	40763	40765	40765	Thorneycroft	86	“ What are we likely to hear ? ”
40770	40777	40779	40779	Reeks	164	“ That ’s impossible to say , ”
40781	40801	40779	40779	Reeks	164	“ but I warn you not to cry out unnecessarily , as such an imprudence would endanger our safety . ”
40802	40815	40817	40817	Thorneycroft	86	“ You are quite sure you do n’t mean to abandon us ? ”
40819	40830	40832	40832	Reeks	164	“ Make yourself easy ; I have no such intention , ”
40835	40852	40854	40854	Ginger	92	“ Oh ! ve’ll take care on you , do n’t be afeerd , old gent , ”
40856	40865	40854	40854	Ginger	92	“ Yes , ve’ll take care on you , ”
40873	40885	40887	40887	Reeks	164	“ You may depend upon them as upon me , sir , ”
40889	40909	40887	40887	Reeks	164	“ Before we explore the subterranean apartments , I wish to see whether any one is up - stairs . ”
40910	40923	40925	40925	Ginger	92	“ Wot ’s that you say about subterranean apartments , Mr. Reeks ? ”
40927	40938	40925	40925	Ginger	92	“ Ve ai n’t a - goin’ below , eh ? ”
41532	41538	41626	41626	Auriol	93	“ Leave me in peace ! ”
41539	41547	41549	41549	Reeks	164	“ Is it Auriol Darcy who speaks ? ”
41551	41555	41557	41558	the prisoner	1218	“ It is , ”
41560	41569	41557	41558	the prisoner	1218	“ Who are you that put the question ? ”
41570	41574	41576	41576	Reeks	164	“ A friend , ”
41578	41585	41587	41587	Auriol	93	“ I have no friend here , ”
41589	41594	41587	41587	Auriol	93	“ You are mistaken , ”
41598	41609	41587	41587	Auriol	93	“ I have come with Mr. Thorneycroft to deliver you . ”
41610	41624	41626	41626	Auriol	93	“ Mr. Thorneycroft has come too late . He has lost his daughter , ”
41628	41635	41637	41637	Reeks	164	“ What has happened to her ? ”
41639	41649	41651	41651	Auriol	93	“ She is in the power of the Fiend , ”
41653	41663	41665	41665	Reeks	164	“ I know she is detained by Cyprian Rougemont , ”
41667	41674	41665	41665	Reeks	164	“ But what has befallen her ? ”
41675	41688	41690	41690	Auriol	93	“ She has become like his other victims — like my victims ! ”
41693	41698	41700	41700	Reeks	164	“ Do not despair , ”
41702	41709	41717	41717	Auriol	93	“ She may yet be saved . ”
41710	41715	41717	41717	Auriol	93	“ Saved ! how ? ”
41719	41724	41717	41717	Auriol	93	“ All is over . ”
41725	41733	41717	41717	Auriol	93	“ So it may seem to you , ”
41737	41746	41717	41717	Auriol	93	“ but you are the victim of delusion . ”
41747	41755	41757	41757	Auriol	93	“ Oh that I could think so ! ”
41759	41800	41757	41757	Auriol	93	“ But no — I saw her fall into the pit . I beheld her veiled figure rise from it . I witnessed her signature to the fatal scroll . There could be no illusion in what I then beheld . ”
41801	41812	41814	41814	Reeks	164	“ Despite all this , you will see her again , ”
41816	41826	41828	41828	Auriol	93	“ Who are you who give me this promise ? ”
41830	41840	41842	41842	Reeks	164	“ As I have already declared , a friend , ”
41844	41849	41842	41842	Reeks	164	“ Are you human ? ”
41850	41854	41871	41871	Auriol	93	“ As yourself . ”
41855	41869	41871	41871	Auriol	93	“ Then you seek in vain to struggle with the powers of darkness , ”
41873	41882	41884	41884	Reeks	164	“ I have no fear of Cyprian Rougemont , ”
41890	41898	41900	41900	Auriol	93	“ Your voice seems familiar to me , ”
41902	41909	41900	41900	Auriol	93	“ Tell me who you are ? ”
41910	41916	41918	41918	Reeks	164	“ You shall know anon , ”
41920	41931	41918	41918	Reeks	164	“ But , hist!—we are interrupted . Some one approaches . ”
41988	42007	41976	41977	the Tinker	246	“ Wot the devil can Mr. Reeks be about ? I hope nuffin ’ has happened to him . ”
42008	42019	42021	42021	Ginger	92	“ Do n’t mention a certain gent ’s name here , ”
42023	42035	42021	42021	Ginger	92	“ or if you do , treat it vith proper respect . ”
42036	42039	42041	42042	the Tinker	80	“ Pshaw ! ”
42045	42108	42041	42042	the Tinker	80	“ I do n’t like a man stayin ’ avay in this manner . It looks suspicious . I wotes ve goes and sees arter him . Ve can leave the old gent to take a keviet nap by himself . Do n’t disturb yourself , sir . Ve’ll only jist giv ’ a look about us , and then come back . ”
42109	42117	42119	42119	Thorneycroft	86	“ Stay where you are , rascal ! ”
42122	42138	42119	42119	Thorneycroft	86	“ I wo n’t be left . Stay where you are , I command you ! ”
42139	42155	42157	42158	the Tinker	246	“ Vell , ve’ve got a noo captain , I ’m a - thinkin ’ , ”
42165	42198	42199	42199	he	246	“ Ve’ve no vish to disobleege you , sir . I ’ll only jist peep out into the hall , and see if Mr. Reeks is anyvhere thereabouts . Vy , zounds ! ”
42208	42213	42203	42203	he	246	“ it ’s locked ! ”
42214	42219	42221	42221	Thorneycroft	86	“ What ’s locked ? ”
42225	42233	42235	42236	the Tinker	246	“ The door , to be sure , ”
42238	42242	42235	42236	the Tinker	246	“ Ve’re prisoners . ”
42243	42253	42255	42258	the iron - merchant	561	“ O Lord , you do n’t say so ! ”
42265	42272	42255	42258	the iron - merchant	561	“ What will become of us ? ”
42286	42293	42294	42294	he	561	“ I see how it is , ”
42297	42336	42294	42294	he	561	“ You have entrapped me , ruffians . It ’s all a trick . You mean to murder me . But I ’ll sell my life dearly . The first who approaches shall have his brains blown out . ”
42352	42362	42364	42365	that individual	1226	“ Holloa ! wot are you arter , sir ? ”
42374	42404	42364	42365	that individual	1226	“ You ’re a - labourin ’ under a mistake — a complete mistake . If it is a trap , ve’re catched in it as vell as yourself . ”
42405	42412	42414	42415	the Sandman	247	“ To be sure ve is , ”
42417	42445	42414	42415	the Sandman	247	“ Sit down , and vait a bit . I dessay Mr. Reeks’ll come back , and it von’t do no good gettin ’ into a passion . ”
42446	42459	42461	42461	Thorneycroft	86	“ Well , well , I must resign myself , I suppose , ”
42468	42486	42461	42461	Thorneycroft	86	“ It ’s a terrible situation to be placed in — shut up in a haunted house . ”
42487	42497	42499	42499	Ginger	92	“ I ’ve been in many much vurser sitivations , ”
42501	42520	42499	42499	Ginger	92	“ and I alvays found the best vay to get out on ’em wos to take things quietly . ”
42521	42531	42533	42534	the Tinker	246	“ Besides , there ’s no help for it , ”
42539	42546	42548	42549	the Sandman	247	“ That remains to be seen , ”
42557	42573	42548	42549	the Sandman	247	“ If Reeks do n’t come back soon , I ’ll bust open the door . ”
42574	42582	42584	42584	Ginger	92	“ Plenty o ’ time for that , ”
42597	42609	42584	42584	Ginger	92	“ wot do you say to a mouthful o ’ wittles ? ”
42610	42620	42622	42623	the Sandman	247	“ I would n’t touch ’em for the world , ”
42625	42629	42631	42632	the Tinker	246	“ Nor I , ”
42634	42640	42631	42632	the Tinker	246	“ they may be pisoned . ”
42641	42646	42648	42648	Ginger	92	“ Pisoned — nonsense ! ”
42650	42675	42648	42648	Ginger	92	“ do n’t you see some von has been a - takin ’ his supper here ? I ’ll jist finish it for him . ”
42676	42683	42685	42686	the Tinker	80	“ Vith all my ‘ art , ”
42688	42697	42699	42700	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Do n’t touch it on any account , ”
42702	42714	42699	42700	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ I agree with your companions , it may be poisoned . ”
42715	42723	42725	42725	Ginger	92	“ Oh ! I ai n’t afeerd , ”
42735	42753	42754	42754	he	92	“ As good a pigeon - pie as ever I tasted . Your health , Mr. Thorneycroft , ”
42766	42780	42754	42754	he	92	“ My service to you , gents . Famous tipple , by Jove ! ”
42797	42812	42813	42813	he	92	“ Never tasted sich a glass o ’ wine in all my born days , ”
42820	42828	42813	42813	he	92	“ I wonder wot it ’s called ? ”
42829	42833	42835	42836	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Prussic acid , ”
42839	42843	42845	42845	Ginger	92	“ Proossic fiddlestick ! ”
42847	42866	42845	42845	Ginger	92	“ more likely Tokay . I shall finish the bottle , and never be the vorse for it ! ”
42867	42874	42876	42877	the Tinker	246	“ He ’s gettin ’ svipy , ”
42879	42888	42876	42877	the Tinker	246	“ I vonder vether it ’s really Tokay ? ”
42889	42894	42896	42896	Thorneycroft	86	“ No such thing , ”
42898	42903	42896	42896	Thorneycroft	86	“ let him alone . ”
42904	42910	42912	42913	the Tinker	246	“ I must taste it , ”
42921	42931	42912	42913	the Tinker	246	“ Here , give us a glass , Ginger ! ”
42932	42936	42938	42938	Ginger	92	“ Vith pleasure , ”
42953	42963	42912	42913	the Tinker	246	“ You ’d better be perwailed upon , Sandy . ”
42964	42972	42974	42975	the Sandman	247	“ Vell , I s’pose I must , ”
42983	42991	42993	42993	Ginger	92	“ Here ’s the beaks ’ healths ! ”
42995	43013	42993	42993	Ginger	92	“ I gives that toast ‘ cos they ’re alvays so kind to us dog - fanciers . ”
43014	43040	43042	43043	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Dog - fanciers — say , rather , dog - stealers ; for that ’s the name such vagabonds deserve to be known by , ”
43048	43057	43059	43059	Ginger	92	“ Vell , ve von’t quarrel about names , ”
43063	43089	43059	43059	Ginger	92	“ but I ’ll relate a circumstance to you as’ll prove that wotever your opinion of our wocation may be , the beaks upholds it . ”
43090	43103	43105	43106	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ There can be but one opinion as to your nefarious profession , ”
43108	43137	43105	43106	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ and that is , that it ’s as bad as horse - stealing and sheep - stealing , and should be punished as those offences are punished . ”
43138	43145	43147	43147	Ginger	92	“ So I think , sir , ”
43154	43483	43147	43147	Ginger	92	“ but to my story , and do n’t interrupt me , or I ca n’t get through vith it properly . There ’s a gent livin ’ not a hundred miles from Pall Mall , as the noospapers says , as had a favourite Scotch terrier , not worth more nor half - a - crown to any one but hisself , but highly wallerable to him , ‘ cos it wos a favourite . Vell , the dog is lost . A pal of mine gets hold on it , and the gent soon offers a reward for its recovery . This do n’t bring it back quite so soon as he expects , ‘ cos he do n’t offer enough ; so he goes to an agent , Mr. Simpkins , in the Edger Road , and Mr. Simpkins says to him — says he , ‘ How are you , sir ? I expected you some days ago . You ’ve com’d about that ere Scotch terrier . You ’ve got a wallable greyhound , I understand . A man told me he ’d have that afore long . ’ Seein ’ the gent stare , Mr. S. adds , ‘ Vel , I ’ll tell you wot you must give for your dog . The party von’t take less than six guineas . He knows it ai n’t vorth six shillin ’ , but it ’s a great favourite , and has given him a precious sight o ’ trouble in gettin ’ it . ’ ‘ Give him trouble ! ’ cries the gent angrily—‘and what has it given me ? I hope to see the rascal hanged ! I shall pay no such money . ’ ‘ Werry vell , ’ replies Mr. Simpkins coolly , ‘ then your dog’ll be bled to death , as the nobleman ’s wos , and thrown down a breathless carkis afore your door . ’ ”
43484	43502	43504	43504	Thorneycroft	86	“ You do n’t mean to say that such a horrid circumstance as that really took place ? ”
43514	43523	43525	43525	Ginger	92	“ Only t’other day , I assure you , ”
43527	43546	43525	43525	Ginger	92	“ I ’d shoot the ruffian who treated a dog of mine so , if I caught him ! ”
43552	43560	43562	43562	Ginger	92	“ And sarve him right , too , ”
43564	43690	43562	43562	Ginger	92	“ I discourages all cruelty to hanimals . But do n’t interrupt me again . Arter a bit more chafferin ’ vith Mr. Simpkins , the gent offers three pound for his dog , and then goes avay . Next day he reads a report i ’ the Times noospaper that a man has been taken up for dog - stealin ’ , and that a lot o ’ dogs is shut up in the green - yard behind the police - office in Bow Street . So he goes there in search o ’ his favourite , and sure enough he finds it , but the inspector von’t give it up to him , ‘ cos the superintendent is out o ’ the vay . ”
43691	43694	43696	43697	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Shameful ! ”
43699	43706	43708	43708	Ginger	92	“ Shameful , indeed , sir , ”
43712	43766	43708	43708	Ginger	92	“ Thinkin ’ his dog safe enough in the hands o ’ the police , the gent sleeps soundly that night , but ven he goes back next mornin ’ he finds it has disappeared . The green - yard has been broken into overnight , and all the dogs stolen from it . ”
43767	43775	43777	43777	Thorneycroft	86	“ Under the noses of the police ? ”
43779	43785	43787	43787	Ginger	92	“ Under their werry noses , ”
43789	43903	43912	43912	Thorneycroft	86	“ But now comes the cream o ’ the jest . You shall hear wot the beak says to him ven the gent craves his assistance . ‘ I ca n’t interfere in the matter , ’ says he , a - bendin ’ of his brows in a majestic manner . ‘ Parties do n’t ought to come here vith complaints of vhich I ca n’t take notice . This place ai n’t an advertisin ’ office , and I sha’n’t suffer it to be made von . I von’t listen to statements affectin ’ the characters of absent parties . ’ Statements affectin ’ our characters,—do you tvig that , sir ? ”
43904	43910	43912	43912	Thorneycroft	86	“ I do , indeed , ”
43916	43933	43912	43912	Thorneycroft	86	“ and I am sorry to think such a remark should have dropped from the bench . ”
43934	43946	43948	43948	Ginger	92	“ You ’re right to say dropped from it , sir , ”
43950	44038	43948	43948	Ginger	92	“ I told you the beaks vos our best friends ; they alvays takes our parts . Ven the gent urges that it was a subject of ser’ous importance to all dog - owners , the magistrit angrily interrupts him , sayin’—‘Then let there be a meetin ’ of dog - owners to discuss their grievances . Do n’t come to me . I ca n’t help you . ’ And he vouldn’t if he could , ‘ cos he ’s the dog - fancier ’s friend . ”
44039	44049	44051	44051	Thorneycroft	86	“ It looks like it , I must own , ”
44053	44090	44051	44051	Thorneycroft	86	“ Such reprehensible indifference gives encouragement to people of your profession . Government itself is to blame . As all persons who keep dogs pay a tax for them , their property ought to be protected . ”
44091	44104	44106	44106	Ginger	92	“ I ’m quite satisfied vith the present state of the law , ”
44108	44124	44106	44106	Ginger	92	“ here ’s the vorthy beak ! I ’ll drink his health a second time . ”
44125	44132	44134	44135	the Tinker	246	“ Halloa ! wot ’s that ? ”
44137	44145	44134	44135	the Tinker	246	“ I thought I heerd a noise . ”
44146	44151	44051	44051	Thorneycroft	86	“ So did I , ”
44156	44167	44134	44135	the Tinker	246	“ a strange sort o ’ rumblin ’ sound overhead . ”
44168	44174	44176	44176	Ginger	92	“ There it goes again ! ”
44178	44184	44176	44176	Ginger	92	“ wot an awful din ! ”
44185	44191	44193	44194	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Now it ’s underneath , ”
44202	44214	44193	44194	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ It sounds as if some hidden machinery were at work . ”
44686	44697	44707	44710	the iron - merchant	561	exclaimed—“Will you swear to go hence if you are spared ? ”
44698	44705	44707	44710	the iron - merchant	561	“ No , I will not , ”
44856	44861	44863	44866	the dog - fancier	507	“ Who is it ? ”
44868	44872	44874	44875	the speaker	1253	“ Look up ! ”
44893	44903	44904	44904	he	92	“ Vy , it ca n’t be , surely , ”
44907	44919	44904	44904	he	92	“ And yet I could almost svear it was Old Parr . ”
44920	44927	44929	44930	the other	244	“ You ’re near the mark , ”
44937	44944	44929	44930	the other	244	“ It is your venerable friend . ”
44945	44963	44965	44965	Ginger	92	“ Vot the deuce are you doing here , and in this dress , or rayther undress ? ”
44967	44985	44965	44965	Ginger	92	“ Ven I see you this mornin ’ , you wos in the serwice of Mr. Loftus . ”
44986	44996	44998	44999	the dwarf	479	“ I ’ve got a new master since then , ”
45001	45009	45011	45011	Ginger	92	“ I ’m sorry to hear it , ”
45017	45030	45011	45011	Ginger	92	“ You have n’t sold yourself , like Doctor Forster — eh ? ”
45031	45041	45043	45044	Old Parr	90	“ Faustus , my dear Ginger — not Forster , ”
45046	45078	45043	45044	Old Parr	90	“ No , no , I ’ve made no bargain . And to be plain with you , I ’ve no desire to remain long in my present master ’s service . ”
45079	45093	45095	45095	Ginger	92	“ I do n’t like to ask the question too directly , wenerable , ”
45100	45113	45043	45044	Old Parr	90	tone—“but is your master — hem!—is he — hem!—the — the — — ”
45114	45122	45124	45125	Old Parr	90	“ The devil , you would say , ”
45127	45140	45124	45125	Old Parr	90	“ Between ourselves , I ’m afraid there ’s no denying it . ”
45141	45149	45151	45151	Ginger	92	“ La ! wot a horrible idea ! ”
45157	45177	45151	45151	Ginger	92	“ it makes the flesh creep on one ’s bones . Then we ’re in your master ’s power ? ”
45178	45183	45185	45186	Old Parr	90	“ Very like it , ”
45188	45199	45185	45186	Old Parr	90	“ And there ai n’t no chance o ’ deliverance ? ”
45200	45207	45124	45125	Old Parr	90	“ None that occurs to me . ”
45208	45215	45217	45217	Ginger	92	“ O Lord ! O Lord ! ”
45219	45239	45217	45217	Ginger	92	“ I ’ll repent . I ’ll become a reformed character . I ’ll never steal dogs no more . ”
45240	45253	45255	45256	Old Parr	90	“ In that case , there may be some chance for you , ”
45258	45281	45255	45256	Old Parr	90	“ I think I could help you to escape . Come with me , and I ’ll try and get you out . ”
45282	45292	45294	45294	Ginger	92	“ But wot is to become of the others ? ”
45296	45305	45307	45308	Old Parr	90	“ Oh , leave them to their fate , ”
45310	45318	45320	45320	Ginger	92	“ No , that ’ll never do , ”
45322	45350	45351	45351	he	90	“ Ve’re all in the same boat , and must row out together the best vay ve can . I tell you wot it is , wenerable , ”
45358	45390	45406	45407	Old Parr	90	throat—“your master may be the devil , but you ’re mortal ; and if you do n’t help me to deliver my companions , I ’ll squeege your windpipe for you . ”
45391	45404	45406	45407	Old Parr	90	“ That ’s not the way to induce me to help you , ”
45421	45430	45410	45410	himself	90	“ Now get out , if you can . ”
45431	45437	45439	45439	Ginger	92	“ Do n’t be angry , ”
45454	45475	45439	45439	Ginger	92	“ I only meant to frighten you a bit . Can you tell me if Mr. Auriol Darcy is here ? ”
45476	45487	45489	45490	Old Parr	90	“ Yes , he is , and a close prisoner , ”
45492	45504	45489	45490	Old Parr	90	“ And the girl — Miss Ebber , wot of her ? ”
45505	45511	45513	45514	Old Parr	90	“ I ca n’t say , ”
45516	45525	45513	45514	Old Parr	90	“ I can only speak to the living . ”
45526	45532	45534	45534	Ginger	92	“ Then she ’s dead ! ”
45542	45548	45550	45551	the dwarf	479	“ That ’s a secret , ”
45554	45568	45550	45551	the dwarf	479	“ and I ’m bound by a terrible oath not to disclose it . ”
45569	45580	45582	45582	Ginger	92	“ I ’ll have it out of you notvithstandin ’ , ”
45584	45617	45582	45582	Ginger	92	“ I vish you would lend me a knock on the head , old feller . I ca n’t help thinkin ’ I ’ve got a terrible fit o ’ the nightmare . ”
45618	45626	45628	45629	Old Parr	90	“ Let this waken you , then , ”
45640	45649	45651	45651	Ginger	92	“ Holloa , wenerable ! not so hard ! ”
45653	45660	45662	45663	the dwarf	479	“ Ha ! ha ! ha ! ”
45665	45674	45662	45663	the dwarf	479	“ You know what you ’re about now . ”
45675	45679	45681	45681	Ginger	92	“ Not exactly , ”
45683	45696	45681	45681	Ginger	92	“ I vish I wos fairly out o ’ this cursed place ! ”
45697	45709	45711	45712	Old Parr	90	“ You should n’t have ventured into the lion ’s den , ”
45719	45738	45711	45712	Old Parr	90	“ But come with me , and perhaps I may be able to do something towards your liberation . ”
46026	46038	46011	46011	Rougemont	167	“ You have come to seek your daughter . Behold her ! ”
46144	46147	46148	46148	he	86	“ Ebba ! ”
46149	46151	46153	46153	she	114	cried—“Ebba ! ”
46176	46181	46183	46185	the agonised father	1271	“ What ails her ? ”
46187	46192	46183	46185	the agonised father	1271	“ Ebba ! Ebba ! ”
46193	46197	46199	46199	Rougemont	167	“ Call louder , ”
46206	46219	46221	46222	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Do you not know me ? do you not hear me ? ”
46230	46239	46241	46241	Rougemont	167	“ I told you you should see her , ”
46248	46256	46241	46241	Rougemont	167	“ but she is beyond your reach . ”
46257	46264	46266	46266	Thorneycroft	86	“ Not so , not so ! ”
46268	46296	46266	46266	Thorneycroft	86	“ Come to me , Ebba!—come to your father . O Heaven ! she hears me not ! she heeds me not ! Her senses are gone . ”
46297	46306	46308	46308	Rougemont	167	“ She is fast bound by a spell , ”
46310	46325	46308	46308	Rougemont	167	“ Take a last look of her . You will see her no more . ”
46349	46355	46357	46357	Rougemont	167	“ Are you not content ? ”
46359	46385	46357	46357	Rougemont	167	“ Will you depart in peace , and swear never to come here more ? If so , I will liberate you and your companions . ”
46386	46412	46414	46414	Thorneycroft	86	“ So far from complying with your request , I swear never to rest till I have rescued my child from you , accursed being ! ”
46417	46426	46428	46428	Rougemont	167	“ You have sealed your doom , then , ”
46430	46451	46428	46428	Rougemont	167	“ But before you are yourself immured , you shall see how Auriol Darcy is circumstanced . Bring him along . ”
46531	46537	46539	46539	Auriol	93	“ Oh , Mr. Thorneycroft , ”
46544	46557	46539	46539	Auriol	93	“ I beseech you forgive me . I have destroyed your daughter . ”
46558	46561	46563	46566	the iron - merchant	561	“ You ! ”
46570	46575	46577	46577	Rougemont	167	“ It is true , ”
46579	46591	46593	46593	Auriol	93	“ I would have saved her if it had been possible ! ”
46595	46632	46593	46593	Auriol	93	“ I warned her that to love me would be fatal to her . I told her I was linked to an inexorable destiny , which would involve her in its meshes — but in vain . ”
46633	46636	46638	46638	Thorneycroft	86	“ Oh ! ”
46640	46652	46654	46654	Rougemont	167	“ You see you ought to blame him , not me , ”
46661	46681	46683	46683	Auriol	93	“ I would have given my life , my soul , to preserve her , had it been possible ! ”
46685	46697	46699	46699	Thorneycroft	86	“ Horrors crowd so thick upon me that my brain reels , ”
46701	46705	46706	46706	he	86	“ Merciless wretch ! ”
46712	46738	46706	46706	he	86	“ fiend — whatever you are , complete your work of ruin by my destruction . I have nothing left to tie me to life . ”
46739	46747	46749	46749	Rougemont	167	“ I would have the miserable live , ”
46756	46794	46749	46749	Rougemont	167	“ It is only the happy I seek to destroy . But you have to thank your own obstinacy for your present distress . Bid a lasting farewell to Auriol . You will see him no more . ”
46795	46798	46800	46800	Auriol	93	“ Hold ! ”
46802	46809	46800	46800	Auriol	93	“ A word before we part . ”
46810	46815	46749	46749	Rougemont	167	“ Ay , hold ! ”
46829	46833	46835	46835	Rougemont	167	“ Ha!—who speaks ? ”
46844	46850	46852	46852	Reeks	164	“ I , Gerard Paston ! ”
46891	46899	46901	46901	Auriol	93	“ Is it you , Gerard Paston ? ”
46906	46916	46901	46901	Auriol	93	“ the brother of Clara , my second victim ! ”
46917	46921	46923	46924	the other	244	“ It is , ”
46926	46935	46923	46924	the other	244	“ Your deliverance is at hand , Auriol . ”
46936	46947	46949	46949	Rougemont	167	“ And you have dared to penetrate here , Gerard ? ”
46957	46979	46949	46949	Rougemont	167	“ Recollect , you are bound to me by the same ties as Auriol , and you shall share his fate . ”
46980	46990	46992	46992	Paston	192	“ I am not to be intimidated by threats , ”
46999	47020	47022	47022	he	192	“ You have employed your arts too long . Deliver up Auriol and this gentleman at once , or — — ”
47029	47032	47034	47034	Rougemont	167	“ Fire ! ”
47044	47052	47034	47034	Rougemont	167	“ No earthly bullets can injure me . ”
47053	47058	47060	47060	Ginger	92	“ Ve’ll try that ! ”
47096	47105	47107	47107	Rougemont	167	“ You see how ineffectual your weapons are , ”
47114	47121	47123	47123	Ginger	92	“ It must be the devil ! ”
47128	47134	47136	47136	Paston	192	“ I will try mine , ”
47368	47375	47376	47376	he	192	“ Where are you taking me ? ”
47383	47388	47390	47391	the dwarf	479	“ Ask no questions , ”
47397	47418	47390	47391	the dwarf	479	“ Do you want to be captured , and shut up in a cell for the rest of your life ? ”
47419	47423	47425	47425	Thorneycroft	86	“ Certainly not , ”
47431	47441	47425	47425	Thorneycroft	86	“ I hope there ’s no chance of it . ”
47442	47450	47452	47453	Old Parr	90	“ There ’s every chance of it , ”
47455	47468	47452	47453	Old Parr	90	“ If you ’re taken , you ’ll share Auriol ’s fate . ”
47469	47477	47479	47482	the iron - merchant	561	“ O Lord ! I hope not , ”
47484	47509	47479	47482	the iron - merchant	561	“ I declare , you frighten me so much that you take away all power of movement . I shall drop in a minute . ”
47510	47517	47519	47520	the dwarf	479	“ Come along , I say , ”
47522	47530	47519	47520	the dwarf	479	“ I hear them close behind us . ”
47552	47560	47562	47565	the iron - merchant	561	“ I ca n’t stir another step , ”
47567	47578	47562	47565	the iron - merchant	561	“ I ’m completely done . Better yield at once . ”
47579	47586	47588	47589	the dwarf	479	“ What , without a struggle ? ”
47592	47625	47588	47589	the dwarf	479	“ Think of your daughter , and let the thought of her nerve your heart . She is lost for ever , if you do n’t get out of this accursed place . ”
47626	47636	47638	47641	the iron - merchant	561	“ She is lost for ever as it is , ”
47644	47653	47655	47656	the dwarf	479	“ No — she may yet be saved , ”
47658	47671	47655	47656	the dwarf	479	“ Come on — come on — they are close behind us . ”
47754	47764	47765	47765	he	561	“ We are entrapped — we shall be caught , ”
47768	47803	47765	47765	he	561	“ and then woe to both of us . Fool that I was to attempt your preservation . Better I had left you to rot in a dungeon than have incurred Rougemont ’s displeasure . ”
47813	47821	47822	47822	he	561	“ It ’s all over with me , ”
47825	47835	47822	47822	he	561	“ I give it up — I’ll die here ! ”
47836	47843	47845	47846	the dwarf	479	“ No — we are saved , ”
47865	47869	47871	47871	he	561	it,—“saved — saved ! ”
47962	47974	47976	47977	Old Parr	90	“ They are gone by some other way to intercept us , ”
47988	47995	47976	47977	Old Parr	90	“ come on , Mr. Thorneycroft . ”
47996	48001	48003	48006	the iron - merchant	561	“ I ’ll try , ”
48013	48029	48003	48006	the iron - merchant	561	“ but I ’m completely spent . Oh that I ever ventured into this place ! ”
48030	48051	48053	48054	Old Parr	90	“ It ’s too late to think of that now ; besides , you came here to rescue your daughter , ”
48056	48072	48053	48054	Old Parr	90	“ Take care and keep near me . I wonder where this passage leads to ? ”
48073	48079	48081	48084	the iron - merchant	561	“ Do n’t you know ? ”
48086	48092	48094	48095	the dwarf	479	“ Not in the least , ”
48097	48125	48094	48095	the dwarf	479	“ This is the first time I ’ve been here — and it shall be the last , if I ’m allowed any choice in the matter . ”
48126	48139	48141	48141	Thorneycroft	86	“ You have n’t told me how you came here at all , ”
48143	48149	48151	48152	the dwarf	479	“ I hardly know myself , ”
48154	48191	48151	48152	the dwarf	479	“ but I find it more difficult to get out than I did to get in . How this passage twists about ! I declare we seem to be returning to the point we started from . ”
48192	48201	48203	48203	Thorneycroft	86	“ I think we are turning round ourselves , ”
48211	48223	48203	48203	Thorneycroft	86	“ My head is going . Oh dear ! oh dear ! ”
48224	48237	48239	48240	the dwarf	479	“ Why , it does seem very strange , I must say , ”
48247	48262	48239	48240	the dwarf	479	“ I could almost fancy that the solid stone walls were moving around us . ”
48263	48268	48270	48270	Thorneycroft	86	“ They are moving , ”
48277	48299	48309	48310	the dwarf	479	“ I feel ’em . Lord have mercy upon us , and deliver us from the power of the Evil One ! ”
48300	48307	48309	48310	the dwarf	479	“ The place seems on fire , ”
48312	48329	48309	48310	the dwarf	479	“ A thick smoke fills the passage . Do n’t you perceive it , Mr. Thorneycroft ? ”
48330	48339	48341	48344	the iron - merchant	561	“ Do n’t I!—to be sure I do , ”
48350	48373	48341	48344	the iron - merchant	561	“ I feel as if I were in a room with a smoky chimney , and no window open . Oh!—oh!—I’m choking ! ”
48374	48380	48382	48383	the dwarf	479	“ Do n’t mind it , ”
48392	48402	48382	48383	the dwarf	479	“ We shall soon be out of the smoke . ”
48403	48410	48412	48413	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ I ca n’t stand it , ”
48415	48428	48412	48413	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ I shall die . Oh ! poah — pish — puff ! ”
48429	48446	48448	48449	Old Parr	90	“ Come on , I tell you — you’ll get some fresh air in a minute , ”
48451	48469	48448	48449	Old Parr	90	“ Halloa ! how ’s this ? No outlet . We ’re come to a dead stop . ”
48470	48476	48478	48481	the iron - merchant	561	“ Dead stop , indeed ! ”
48483	48499	48478	48481	the iron - merchant	561	“ We ’ve come to that long ago . But what new difficulty has arisen ? ”
48500	48517	48519	48520	Old Parr	90	“ Merely that the road ’s blocked up by a solid wall — that ’s all , ”
48522	48526	48528	48528	Thorneycroft	86	“ Blocked up ! ”
48530	48537	48528	48528	Thorneycroft	86	“ Then we ’re entombed alive . ”
48538	48542	48544	48545	the dwarf	479	“ I am , ”
48551	48579	48544	48545	the dwarf	479	“ As to you , you ’ve the comfort of knowing it ’ll soon be over with you . But for me , nothing can harm me . ”
48580	48589	48591	48594	a voice above them	1321	“ Do n’t be too sure of that , ”
48596	48604	48606	48607	the dwarf	479	“ Did you speak , Mr. Thorneycroft ? ”
48609	48619	48621	48624	the iron - merchant	561	“ N - o - o — not I , ”
48626	48637	48621	48624	the iron - merchant	561	“ I ’m suffocating — help to drag me out . ”
48638	48645	48683	48685	the unseen speaker	1079	“ Get out if you can , ”
48654	48660	48662	48663	the dwarf	479	“ It ’s Rougemont himself , ”
48667	48674	48662	48663	the dwarf	479	“ Then there ’s no escape . ”
48675	48681	48683	48685	the unseen speaker	1079	“ None whatever , rascal , ”
48687	48701	48683	48685	the unseen speaker	1079	“ I want you . I have more work for you to do . ”
48702	48710	48712	48713	the dwarf	479	“ I wo n’t leave Mr. Thorneycroft , ”
48716	48731	48712	48713	the dwarf	479	“ I ’ve promised to preserve him , and I ’ll keep my word . ”
48732	48735	48737	48738	the other	244	“ Fool ! ”
48740	48748	48737	48738	the other	244	“ You must obey when I command . ”
48780	48789	48791	48792	Old Parr	90	“ Lay hold of me , Mr. Thorneycroft , ”
48794	48810	48791	48792	Old Parr	90	“ I ’m going up again — lay hold of me — pull me down . ”
49027	49042	49023	49024	the Tinker	80	“ Vy , bless my ‘ art , if it ai n’t Mister Thorneycroft . ”
49043	49055	49057	49060	the iron - merchant	561	“ Yes , it ’s me , certainly , Mr. Tinker , ”
49062	49072	49057	49060	the iron - merchant	561	“ Who ’s that you ’ve got with you ? ”
49073	49084	49086	49087	the other	244	“ Vy , who should it be but the Sandman , ”
49090	49108	49086	49087	the other	244	“ Ve’ve set ourselves free at last , and have made some nice diskiveries into the bargin . ”
49109	49118	49120	49121	the Tinker	80	“ Yes , ve’ve found it all out , ”
49123	49135	49137	49140	the iron - merchant	561	“ What have you discovered — what have you found out ? ”
49143	49159	49137	49140	the iron - merchant	561	“ Have you found my daughter ? Where is she ? Take me to her . ”
49160	49172	49174	49175	the Tinker	80	“ Not so fast , old gent , not so fast , ”
49177	49202	49174	49175	the Tinker	80	“ Ve ai n’t sure as ‘ ow ve’ve found your darter , but ve’ve catched a peep of a nice young ‘ ooman . ”
49203	49216	49218	49221	the iron - merchant	561	“ Oh ! it must be her — no doubt of it , ”
49223	49238	49218	49221	the iron - merchant	561	“ Where is she ? Take me to her without a moment ’s delay . ”
49239	49253	49255	49256	the Tinker	246	“ But ve ca n’t get to her , I tell ‘ ee , ”
49258	49273	49255	49256	the Tinker	246	“ Ve knows the place vere she ’s a - shut up,—that ’s all . ”
49274	49280	49282	49283	Mr. Thorneycroft	86	“ Take me to it , ”
49286	49300	49302	49303	the Tinker	246	“ Vell , if you must go , step this vay , then , ”
49310	49323	49302	49303	the Tinker	246	“ Halloa , Sandy , did you shut the door arter you ? ”
49324	49328	49330	49331	the other	244	“ Not I , ”
49333	49337	49330	49331	the other	244	“ open it . ”
49338	49342	49344	49345	the Tinker	246	“ Easily said , ”
49347	49371	49344	49345	the Tinker	246	“ but not quevite so easily done . Vy , zounds , it ’s shut of itself and bolted itself on t’other side ! ”
49372	49380	49382	49382	Thorneycroft	86	“ Some one must have followed you , ”
49384	49392	49382	49382	Thorneycroft	86	“ We ’re watched on all sides . ”
49393	49402	49404	49405	the Sandman	247	“ Ay , and from above , too , ”
49407	49412	49413	49413	he	247	“ Look up there ! ”
49421	49434	49436	49439	the iron - merchant	561	“ What ’s the matter ? What new danger is at hand ? ”
49441	49448	49450	49451	the Sandman	81	“ Look up , I say , ”
49453	49461	49450	49451	the Sandman	81	“ Do n’t ye see , Tinker ? ”
49462	49470	49472	49473	the other	244	“ Ay , ay , I see , ”
49475	49500	49502	49502	he	247	“ The roof ’s a - comin ’ in upon us . Let ’s get out o ’ this as fast as ve can . ”
50062	50068	50069	50069	he	93	“ What can this mean ? ”
50072	50290	50069	50069	he	93	“ Have I endured a long and troubled dream , during which I have fancied myself living through more than two centuries ? O Heaven , that it may be so ! Oh that the fearful crimes I suppose I have committed have only been enacted in a dream ! Oh that my victims are imaginary ! Oh that Ebba should only prove a lovely phantom of the night ! And yet , I could almost wish the rest were real — so that she might exist . I can not bear to think that she is nothing more than a vision . But it must be so — I have been dreaming — and what a dream it has been!—what strange glimpses it has afforded me into futurity ! Methought I lived in the reigns of many sovereigns — beheld one of them carried to the block — saw revolutions convulse the kingdom — old dynasties shaken down , and new ones spring up . Fashions seem to me to have so changed , that I had clean forgotten the old ones ; while my fellow - men scarcely appeared the same as heretofore . Can I be the same myself ? Is this the dress I once wore ? Let me seek for some proof . ”
50327	50341	50321	50321	he	1357	“ This is proof enough — I have been dreaming all this while . ”
50342	50350	50352	50364	a personage stationed at the foot of the steps springing from the doorway	1358	“ The scheme works to a miracle , ”
50386	50395	50397	50397	Auriol	93	“ And yet , why am I here ? ”
50402	50411	50412	50412	he	93	“ Ah ! I see how it is , ”
50419	50443	50412	50412	he	93	“ I have been mad — perhaps am mad still . That will account for the strange delusion under which I have laboured . ”
50444	50452	50454	50455	the listener	1360	“ I will act upon that hint , ”
50457	50464	50466	50466	Auriol	93	“ Of what use is memory , ”
50469	50533	50466	50466	Auriol	93	“ if things that are not , seem as if they were ? If joys and sorrows which we have never endured are stamped upon the brain — if visions of scenes , and faces and events which we have never witnessed , never known , haunt us , as if they had once been familiar ? But I am mad — mad ! ”
50540	50664	50538	50538	himself	1360	“ How else , if I were not mad , could I have believed that I had swallowed the fabled elixir vitæ ? And yet , is it a fable ? for I am puzzled still . Methinks I am old — old — old — though I feel young , and look young . All this is madness . Yet how clear and distinct it seems ! I can call to mind events in Charles the Second ’s time . Ha!—who told me of Charles the Second ? How know I there was such a king ? The reigning sovereign should be James , and yet I fancy it is George the Fourth . Oh ! I am mad — clean mad ! ”
50682	50692	50694	50694	Auriol	93	“ Would I could look forth from this dungeon , ”
50700	50767	50694	50694	Auriol	93	“ and satisfy myself of the truth or falsehood of my doubts by a view of the external world , for I am so perplexed in mind , that if I were not distracted already , they would be enough to drive me so . What dismal , terrible fancies have possessed me , and weigh upon me still — the compact with Rougemont — ha ! ”
50768	50773	50775	50776	the listener	1360	“ Now it comes , ”
50778	50816	50775	50776	the listener	1360	“ Oh , that I could shake off the conviction that this were not so — that my soul , though heavily laden , might still be saved ! Oh , that I dared to hope this ! ”
50817	50828	50830	50831	the listener	1360	“ I must interrupt him if he pursues this strain , ”
50833	50905	50830	50831	the listener	1360	“ Whether my crimes are real or imaginary — whether I snatched the cup of immortality from my grandsire ’s dying lips — whether I signed a compact with the Fiend , and delivered him a victim on each tenth year — I can not now know ; but if it is so , I deeply , bitterly regret them , and would expiate my offences by a life of penance . ”
50930	50937	50909	50909	Rougemont	167	“ What ho , Auriol!—Auriol Darcy ! ”
50938	50942	50944	50944	Auriol	93	“ Who speaks ? ”
50946	50955	50944	50944	Auriol	93	“ Ah ! is it you , Fiend ? ”
50956	50967	50969	50969	Rougemont	167	“ What , you are still in your old fancies , ”
50971	50986	50969	50969	Rougemont	167	“ I thought the draught I gave you last night would have amended you . ”
50987	50996	50998	50998	Auriol	93	“ Tell me who and what I am , ”
51004	51023	50998	50998	Auriol	93	“ in what age I am living ; and whether I am in my right mind or not ? ”
51024	51035	51037	51037	Rougemont	167	“ For the first , you are called Auriol Darcy , ”
51039	51079	51037	51037	Rougemont	167	“ for the second , you are living in the reign of his most Catholic Majesty James I. of England , and Sixth of Scotland ; and for the third , I trust you will soon recover your reason . ”
51080	51083	51085	51085	Auriol	93	“ Amazement ! ”
51095	51101	51085	51085	Auriol	93	“ Then I am mad . ”
51102	51119	51121	51121	Rougemont	167	“ It ’s plain your reason is returning , since you are conscious of your condition , ”
51123	51136	51121	51121	Rougemont	167	“ but calm yourself , you have been subject to raging frenzies . ”
51137	51148	51150	51150	Auriol	93	“ And I have been shut up here for safety ? ”
51152	51155	51157	51158	the other	244	“ Precisely , ”
51160	51166	51157	51158	the other	244	“ And you are — — ”
51167	51171	51173	51173	Rougemont	167	“ Your keeper , ”
51175	51186	51188	51188	Auriol	93	“ My God ! what a brain mine must be ! ”
51190	51205	51188	51188	Auriol	93	“ Answer me one question — Is there such a person as Ebba Thorneycroft ? ”
51206	51214	51216	51216	Rougemont	167	“ You have often raved about her , ”
51218	51229	51216	51216	Rougemont	167	“ But she is a mere creature of the imagination . ”
51239	51256	51258	51258	Rougemont	167	“ Since you have become so reasonable , you shall again go forth into the world , ”
51260	51293	51258	51258	Rougemont	167	“ but the first essay must be made at night , for fear of attracting observation . I will come to you again a few hours hence . Farewell for the present . ”
51439	51451	51452	51452	he	1371	“ This will , at all events , solve my doubts , ”
51456	51479	51452	51452	he	1371	“ I will sheathe this weapon in my heart , and , if I am mortal , my woes will be ended . ”
51513	51521	51481	51481	he	1371	“ Would you destroy yourself , madman ? ”
51526	51552	51481	51481	he	1371	“ I thought your violence was abated , and that you might go forth in safety . But I find you are worse than ever . ”
51579	51588	51589	51589	he	93	“ You shall be removed to another chamber , ”
51592	51601	51589	51589	he	93	“ where you can be more strictly watched . ”
51602	51613	51615	51615	Auriol	93	“ Take me forth — oh ! take me forth , ”
51617	51631	51615	51615	Auriol	93	“ It was a mere impulse of desperation , which I now repent . ”
51632	51687	51589	51589	he	93	“ I dare not trust you . You will commit some act of insane fury , for which I myself shall have to bear the blame . When I yielded to your entreaties on a former occasion , and took you forth , I narrowly prevented you from doing all we met a mischief . ”
51688	51698	51700	51700	Auriol	93	“ I have no recollection of any such circumstance , ”
51703	51733	51700	51700	Auriol	93	“ But it may be true , nevertheless . And if so , it only proves the lamentable condition to which I am reduced — memory and reason gone ! ”
51734	51740	51742	51743	the other	244	“ Ay , both gone , ”
51750	51753	51755	51755	Auriol	93	“ Ha ! ”
51759	51789	51755	51755	Auriol	93	“ I am not so mad but I recognise in you the Evil Being who tempted me . I am not so oblivious as to forget our terrible interviews . ”
51790	51800	51802	51802	Rougemont	167	“ What , you are in your lunes again ! ”
51805	51819	51802	51802	Rougemont	167	“ Nay , then I must call my assistants , and bind you . ”
51820	51829	51831	51831	Auriol	93	“ Let me be — let me be ! ”
51833	51862	51831	51831	Auriol	93	“ and I will offend you no more . Whatever thoughts may arise within me , I will not give utterance to them . Only take me forth . ”
51863	51870	51872	51872	Rougemont	167	“ I came for that purpose , ”
51874	51891	51872	51872	Rougemont	167	“ but I repeat , I dare not . You are not sufficiently master of yourself . ”
51892	51896	51898	51898	Auriol	93	“ Try me , ”
51900	51903	51905	51906	the other	244	“ Well , ”
51908	51920	51905	51906	the other	244	“ I will see what I can do to calm you . ”
51955	51958	51959	51959	he	244	“ Drink ! ”
51970	51983	51984	51984	he	93	“ It seems to me rather a stimulant than a soothing potion , ”
51992	52001	52003	52004	the other	244	“ You are in no condition to judge , ”
52015	52023	52024	52024	he	244	“ Now then , come with me , ”
52027	52043	52024	52024	he	244	“ and do not make any attempt at evasion , or you will rue it . ”
52266	52274	52276	52276	Rougemont	167	“ Is your master a - bed ? ”
52278	52288	52290	52291	the dwarf	479	“ A - bed ! Good lack , sir ! ”
52293	52313	52290	52291	the dwarf	479	“ little of sleep knows Doctor Lamb . He will toil at the furnace till the stars have set . ”
52314	52318	52320	52320	Auriol	93	“ Doctor Lamb ! ”
52322	52331	52320	52320	Auriol	93	“ Surely I have heard that name before ? ”
52332	52336	52338	52338	Rougemont	167	“ Very likely , ”
52340	52352	52338	52338	Rougemont	167	“ for it is the name borne by your nearest kinsman . ”
52353	52361	52363	52364	the dwarf	479	“ How is the poor young gentleman ? ”
52371	52397	52369	52369	Auriol	93	“ My master often makes inquiries after his grandson , and grieves that the state of his mind should render it necessary to confine him . ”
52398	52409	52411	52411	Auriol	93	“ His grandson ! I — Doctor Lamb ’s grandson ! ”
52413	52422	52424	52425	the dwarf	479	“ In sooth are you , young sir , ”
52427	52488	52424	52425	the dwarf	479	“ Were you in your reason , you would be aware that my master ’s name is the same as your own — Darcy — Reginald Darcy . He assumes the name of Doctor Lamb to delude the multitude . He told you as much yourself , sweet sir , if your poor wits would enable you to recollect it . ”
52489	52503	52505	52505	Auriol	93	“ Am I in a dream , good fellow , tell me that ? ”
52511	52518	52520	52521	the dwarf	479	“ Alack , no , sir , ”
52523	52539	52540	52540	he	93	“ to my thinking , you are wide awake . But you know , sir , ”
52547	52567	52540	52540	he	93	“ you have been a little wrong here , and your memory and reason are not of the clearest . ”
52568	52575	52577	52577	Auriol	93	“ Where does my grandsire dwell ? ”
52579	52585	52587	52588	the dwarf	479	“ Why here , sir , ”
52590	52610	52587	52588	the dwarf	479	“ and for the matter of locality , the house is situated on the south end of London Bridge . ”
52611	52625	52627	52627	Auriol	93	“ On the bridge — did you say on the bridge , friend ? ”
52629	52653	52655	52656	the dwarf	479	“ Ay , on the bridge — where else should it be ? You would not have your grandsire live under the river ? ”
52658	52680	52655	52656	the dwarf	479	“ though , for ought I know , some of these vaults may go under it . They are damp enough . ”
52701	52715	52717	52718	the latter	922	“ Will it disturb Doctor Lamb if his grandson goes up to him ? ”
52725	52744	52746	52747	the dwarf	479	“ My master does not like to be interrupted in his operations , as you know , sir , ”
52749	52781	52746	52747	the dwarf	479	“ and seldom suffers any one , except myself , to enter his laboratory ; but I will make so bold as to introduce Master Auriol , if he desires it . ”
52782	52795	52797	52797	Auriol	93	“ You will confer the greatest favour on me by doing so , ”
52801	52808	52810	52810	Rougemont	167	“ Sit down — sit down ! ”
52813	52837	52810	52810	Rougemont	167	“ You can not go up till the doctor has been apprised . Remain here , while Flapdragon and I ascertain his wishes . ”
52901	52908	52910	52911	the mannikin	1399	“ Your grandsire will see you , ”
52913	52920	52922	52922	Auriol	93	“ One word before we go , ”
52928	52936	52938	52939	the dwarf	479	“ Saints ! how you frighten me ! ”
52941	52957	52938	52939	the dwarf	479	“ You must keep composed , or I dare not take you to my master . ”
52958	52962	52964	52964	Auriol	93	“ Pardon me , ”
52966	52983	52964	52964	Auriol	93	“ I meant not to alarm you . Where is the person who brought me hither ? ”
52984	52990	52992	52993	the dwarf	479	“ What , your keeper ? ”
52995	53014	52992	52993	the dwarf	479	“ Oh , he is within call . He will come to you anon . Now follow me . ”
53225	53231	53233	53235	the old man	1171	“ Come in , grandson , ”
53238	53277	53233	53235	the old man	1171	“ Come in , and close the door after you . The draught affects the furnace — my Athanor , as we adepts term it . So you are better , your keeper tells me — much better . ”
53278	53284	53286	53286	Auriol	93	“ Are you indeed living ? ”
53300	53305	53307	53309	the old man	1171	“ Off — off ! ”
53317	53341	53307	53309	the old man	1171	“ You disturb my operations . Keep him calm , Flapdragon , or take him hence . He may do me a mischief . ”
53342	53351	53353	53353	Auriol	93	“ I have no such intention , sir , ”
53355	53374	53353	53353	Auriol	93	“ indeed I have not . I only wish to be assured that you are my aged relative . ”
53375	53385	53387	53388	the dwarf	479	“ To be sure he is , young sir , ”
53390	53397	53387	53388	the dwarf	479	“ Why should you doubt it ? ”
53398	53402	53404	53404	Auriol	93	“ O sir , ”
53415	53497	53407	53407	himself	93	“ pity me if I am mad ; but offer me some explanation , which may tend to restore me to my senses . My reason seems gone , yet I appear capable of receiving impressions from external objects . I see you , and appear to know you . I see this chamber — these alchemical implements — that furnace — these different objects — and I appear to recognise them . Am I deceived , or is this real ? ”
53498	53507	53509	53511	the old man	1171	“ You are not deceived , my son , ”
53513	53566	53509	53511	the old man	1171	“ You have been in this room before , and you have seen me before . It would be useless to explain to you now how you have suffered from fever , and what visions your delirium has produced . When you are perfectly restored , we will talk the matter over . ”
53632	53648	53649	53649	he	93	“ I should feel perfectly convinced , if I might look forth from that window , ”
53652	53657	53659	53661	the old man	1171	“ Convinced of what ? ”
53665	53673	53675	53675	Auriol	93	“ That I am what I seem , ”
53677	53683	53685	53687	the old man	1171	“ Look forth , then , ”
53689	53716	53685	53687	the old man	1171	“ But do not disturb me by idle talk . There is the rosy colour in the projection for which I have been so long waiting . ”
53867	53881	53854	53854	he	93	“ I am satisfied . I have lived centuries in a few nights . ”
