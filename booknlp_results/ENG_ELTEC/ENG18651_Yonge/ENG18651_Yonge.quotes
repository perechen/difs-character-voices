7	17	5	5	DANTE	118	“ It is very kind in the dear mother . ”
18	39	5	5	DANTE	118	“ But — what , Rachel ? Do n’t you like it ! She so enjoyed choosing it for you . ”
40	87	5	5	DANTE	118	“ Oh yes , it is a perfect thing in its way . Do n’t say a word to her ; but if you are consulted for my next birthday present , Grace , could n’t you suggest that one does cease to be a girl . ”
88	107	5	5	DANTE	118	“ Only try it on , Rachel dear , she will be pleased to see you in it . ”
108	170	5	5	DANTE	118	“ Oh yes , I will bedizen myself to oblige her . I do assure you I am not ungrateful . It is beautiful in itself , and shows how well nature can be imitated ; but it is meant for a mere girl , and this is the very day I had fixed for hauling down the flag of youth . ”
171	176	5	5	DANTE	118	“ Oh , Rachel . ”
177	218	5	5	DANTE	118	“ Ah , ha ! If Rachel be an old maid , what is Grace ? Come , my dear , resign yourself ! There is nothing more unbecoming than want of perception of the close of young - ladyhood . ”
219	232	234	234	Grace	120	“ Of course I know we are not quite young girls now , ”
242	271	234	234	Grace	120	“ Exactly , from this moment we are established as the maiden sisters of Avonmouth , husband and wife to one another , as maiden pairs always are . ”
272	282	316	317	her sister	480	“ Then thus let me crown , our bridal , ”
298	302	304	304	Rachel	128	“ Treacherous child ! ”
322	358	316	317	her sister	480	“ You know brides always take liberties . Please , dear , let it stay till the mother has been in , and pray do n’t talk , before her of being so very old . ”
359	389	390	390	Grace	120	“ No , I ’ll not be a shock to her . We will silently assume our immunities , and she will acquiesce if they come upon her gradually . ”
418	427	429	434	a pleasant placid - looking lady	482	“ Ah , mother dear , good morning , ”
657	689	645	645	her	120	“ Yes , my dear , it looks very well ; and now you will oblige me by not wearing that black lace thing , that looks fit for your grandmother . ”
690	712	645	645	her	120	“ Poor Lovedy Kelland ’s aunt made it , mother , and it was very expensive , and would n’t sell . ”
713	757	645	645	her	120	“ No wonder , I am sure , and it was very kind in you to take it off their hands ; but now it is paid for , it ca n’t make much difference whether you disfigure yourself with it or not . ”
758	800	801	801	she	485	“ Oh yes , dear mother , I ’ll bind my hair when you bid me do it and really these buds do credit to the makers . I wonder whether they cost them as dear in health as lace does , ”
817	823	825	829	the well - pleased mother	486	“ I chose white roses , ”
831	860	825	829	the well - pleased mother	486	“ because I thought they would suit either of the silks you have now , though I own I should like to see you in another white muslin . ”
861	869	871	871	Rachel	128	“ I have done with white muslin , ”
878	892	871	871	Rachel	128	“ It is an affectation of girlish simplicity not becoming at our age . ”
893	897	899	899	Grace	120	“ Oh Rachel ! ”
984	998	999	999	she	128	“ And this is all I am doing for my fellow - creatures , ”
1004	1503	999	999	she	128	“ One class of half - grown lads , and those grudged to me ! Here is the world around one mass of misery and evil ! Not a paper do I take up but I see something about wretchedness and crime , and here I sit with health , strength , and knowledge , and able to do nothing , nothing — at the risk of breaking my mother ’s heart ! I have pottered about cottages and taught at schools in the dilettante way of the young lady who thinks it her duty to be charitable ; and I am told that it is my duty , and that I may be satisfied . Satisfied , when I see children cramped in soul , destroyed in body , that fine ladies may wear lace trimmings ! Satisfied with the blight of the most promising buds ! Satisfied , when I know that every alley and lane of town or country reeks with vice and corruption , and that there is one cry for workers with brains and with purses ! And here am I , able and willing , only longing to task myself to the uttermost , yet tethered down to the merest mockery of usefulness by conventionalities . I am a young lady forsooth!—I must not be out late , I must not put forth my views ; I must not choose my acquaintance , I must be a mere helpless , useless being , growing old in a ridiculous fiction of prolonged childhood , affecting those graces of so - called sweet seventeen that I never had — because , because why ? Is it for any better reason than because no mother can bear to believe her daughter no longer on the lists for matrimony ? Our dear mother does not tell herself that this is the reason , but she is unconsciously actuated by it . And I have hitherto given way to her wish . I mean to give way still in a measure ; but I am five and twenty , and I will no longer be withheld from some path of usefulness ! I will judge for myself , and when my mission has declared itself , I will not be withheld from it by any scruple that does not approve itself to my reason and conscience . If it be only a domestic mission — say the care of Fanny , poor dear helpless Fanny , I would that I knew she was safe,—I would not despise it , I would throw myself into it , and regard the training her and forming her boys as a most sacred office . It would not be too homely for me . But I had far rather become the founder of some establishment that might relieve women from the oppressive task - work thrown on them in all their branches of labour . Oh , what a worthy ambition ! ”
1504	1507	1509	1509	Grace	120	“ Rachel ! ”
1511	1539	1509	1509	Grace	120	“ Come , there ’s a letter , a letter from Fanny herself for you . Make haste , mamma is so nervous till you read it . ”
1567	1602	999	999	she	128	“ All is right , mamma . She has been very ill , but is fast recovering , and was to sail by the Voluta . Why , she may be here any day . ”
1603	1619	999	999	she	128	“ Any day ! My dear Grace , see that the nurseries are well aired . ”
1620	1659	999	999	she	128	“ No , mother , she says her party is too large , and wants us to take a furnished house for her to come into at once — Myrtlewood if possible . Is it let , Grace ? ”
1660	1672	999	999	she	128	“ I think I saw the notice in the window yesterday . ”
1673	1686	999	999	she	128	“ Then , I ’ll go and see about it at once . ”
1687	1710	1712	1713	her mother	496	“ But , my dear , you do n’t really mean that poor dear Fanny thinks of coming anywhere but to us ? ”
1717	1725	1727	1727	Grace	120	“ It is very considerate of her , ”
1729	1766	1727	1727	Grace	120	“ with so many little children . You would find them too much for you , dear mother . It is just like Fanny to have thought of it . How many are there , Rachel ? ”
1767	1799	999	999	she	128	“ Oh ! I ca n’t tell . They got past my reckoning long ago . I only know they are all boys , and that this baby is a girl . ”
1800	1820	999	999	she	128	“ Baby ! Ah , poor Fanny , I feared that was the reason the did not come sooner . ”
1821	2076	1727	1727	Grace	120	“ Yes , and she has been very ill ; she always is , I believe , but there is very little about it . Fanny never could write letters ; she only just says : ‘ I have not been able to attempt a letter sooner , though my dear little girl is five weeks old to - day . Think of the daughter coming at last , too late for her dear father , who had so wished for one . She is very healthy , I am thankful to say ; and I am now so much better , that the doctor says I may sail next week . Major Keith has taken our cabins , in the Voluta , and soon after you receive this , I hope to be showing you my dear boys . They are such good , affectionate fellows ; but I am afraid they would be too much for my dear aunt , and our party is so large , so the Major and I both think it will be the best way for you to take a house for me for six months . I should like Myrtlewood best , if it is to be had . I have told Conrade all about it , and how pretty it is , and it is so near you that I think there I can be happy as ever I can be again in this world , and have your advice for the dear children . ’ ”
2077	2088	1727	1727	Grace	120	“ Poor darling ! she seems but a child herself . ”
2089	2097	2099	2099	Rachel	128	“ My age — five and twenty , ”
2101	2144	2145	2145	she	128	“ Well I shall go and ask about the house . Remember , mother , this influx is to bring no trouble or care on you ; Fanny Temple is my charge from henceforth . My mission has come to seek me , ”
2839	2850	2851	2851	Rachel	128	“ At their age it was affecting an interesting childishness . ”
3734	3737	3741	3745	a figure in deep black	588	“ Rachel ! ”
3802	3827	3799	3800	a nurse	593	“ Good - bye . Thank you , oh , thank you . You will come soon . Oh , do come on now . ”
3828	3834	3764	3768	a tall , bearded man	589	“ Do come on now , ”
3841	3853	3799	3800	a nurse	593	“ I leave you in good hands . Good - bye . ”
3854	3886	3887	3888	This last	594	“ Good - bye . Conrade dear , see what Cyril is doing ; never mind , Wilfred , the Major will come and see us ; run on with Coombe . ”
3950	3958	3924	3925	the Major	5023	chorus—“Mamma , let me go with you ; ”
3959	3966	3924	3925	the Major	5023	“ I ’ll go with mamma ; ”
3967	3973	3924	3925	the Major	5023	“ Me go with mamma ; ”
4058	4077	4053	4053	Rachel	128	“ Little Wilfred can sit on my lap , he has not been well , poor little man , ”
4101	4113	4114	4114	Rachel	128	“ Oh , no thank you , Wilfred never tires me . ”
4262	4272	4255	4255	Britomart	136	“ Why would n’t the Major come , mamma ? ”
4273	4285	4295	4296	the Major	5023	“ He will soon come , I hope , my dear . ”
4433	4441	4443	4443	Rachel	128	“ She feeble , helpless , sickly ! ”
4445	4459	4443	4443	Rachel	128	“ I should have been less tired had I walked the twenty miles ! ”
4515	4518	4504	4504	Conrade	126	“ home , ”
4534	4538	4540	4540	Fanny	127	“ The sea ! ”
4553	4575	4540	4540	Fanny	127	“ it is hard to believe we have been on it so long , this seems so much more my own . ”
4576	4579	4581	4581	Rachel	128	“ Yes , ”
4583	4600	4581	4581	Rachel	128	“ you are come to your own home , for us to take care of you . ”
4601	4613	4616	4616	Conrade	126	“ I take care of mamma ! Major Keith said so , ”
4618	4630	4632	4632	Fanny	127	“ There ’s plenty of care for you both to take , ”
4642	4671	4632	4632	Fanny	127	“ The Major says I need not be a poor creature , and I will try . But I am afraid I shall be on all your hands . ”
4703	4708	4710	4711	Lady Temple	138	“ See the church , ”
4762	4766	4768	4768	her	127	“ How beautiful ! ”
4771	4792	4768	4768	her	127	“ You were beginning the collection for it when I went away ! How we used to wish for it . ”
4793	4799	4801	4801	Rachel	128	“ Yes , we did , ”
4940	4946	4936	4936	Francis	139	“ Where ’s the orderly ? ”
5118	5127	5129	5129	Conrade	126	“ I do n’t drink tea with nurse , ”
5388	5404	5406	5406	Rachel	128	“ You wo n’t mind , Rachel dear , I must first see about baby ; ”
5586	5631	5575	5575	her	128	“ Dear Rachel , it is like a dream to have you so near . I felt like the old life come back again to hear the surge of the sea all night , and know I should see you all so soon again . ”
5632	5665	5679	5682	two or three voices	668	“ Yes , it is a great satisfaction to have you back in your old home , under our wing . I have a great deal to tell you about the arrangements . ”
5666	5673	5679	5682	two or three voices	668	“ Oh yes ; thank you — ”
5674	5677	5679	5682	two or three voices	668	“ Mamma ! ”
5684	5692	5679	5682	two or three voices	668	“ I wanted to explain to you — ”
5708	5731	5705	5706	two boys	669	“ Mamma , nurse wo n’t undo the tin box , and my ship is in it that the Major gave me . ”
5732	5749	5679	5682	two or three voices	668	“ Yes , and my stuffed duck - bill , and I want it , mamma . ”
5750	5776	5705	5706	two boys	669	“ My dear Con , the Major would not let you shout so loud about it , and you have not spoken to Aunt Rachel . ”
5791	5811	5705	5706	two boys	669	“ Please order nurse to unpack it , mamma , and then Coombe will help us to sail it . ”
5812	5819	5821	5821	Fanny	127	“ Excuse me , dear Rachel , ”
5823	5831	5821	5821	Fanny	127	“ I will first see about this . ”
5866	5878	5850	5850	Rachel	128	“ Dear Rachel , you have been left a long time . ”
5879	5915	5920	5921	the visitor	672	“ Oh , never mind that , but , Fanny , you must not give way to those children too much ; they will be always — Hark ! was that the door - bell ? ”
5925	5929	5920	5921	the visitor	672	“ Mr. Touchett ; ”
5963	6001	5938	5938	he	673	“ My call is — is early , Lady Temple ; but I always pay my respects at once to any new parishioner — resident , I mean — in case I can be of any service . ”
6002	6012	6014	6014	Fanny	127	“ Thank you , I am very much obliged , ”
6041	6053	6036	6036	Rachel	128	“ My cousin is quite at home here , Mr. Touchett . ”
6054	6058	6059	6059	he	673	“ Oh yes , ”
6062	6069	6059	6059	he	673	“ so — so I understood . ”
6070	6093	6095	6095	Fanny	127	“ I know no place in England so well ; it is quite a home to me , so beautiful it is , ”
6097	6105	6095	6095	Fanny	127	“ And you see great changes here . ”
6106	6114	6116	6116	Fanny	127	“ Changes so much for the better , ”
6124	6135	6138	6138	Rachel	128	“ One always expects more from improvements than they effect , ”
6142	6150	6152	6153	Mr. Touchett	145	“ You have a large young party , ”
6161	6175	6152	6153	Mr. Touchett	145	“ Yes , I have half a dozen boys and one little girl . ”
6176	6179	6180	6181	Mr. Touchett	145	“ Seven ! ”
6208	6220	6198	6198	his	145	“ Seven ! It is — it is a great charge . ”
6221	6228	6229	6229	she	128	“ Yes , indeed it is , ”
6233	6256	6229	6229	she	128	“ and I am sure you will be kind enough to give your influence to help me with them — poor boys . ”
6257	6262	6263	6263	he	145	“ Oh ! oh ! ”
6266	6272	6263	6263	he	145	“ anything I can do — ”
6285	6299	6281	6281	Rachel	128	“ We are all anxious to assist in the care of the children . ”
6318	6327	6300	6300	He	145	“ As the clergyman of the parish — , ”
6352	6388	6340	6341	Lady Temple	138	“ Of course we shall look to you so much , and you will be so kind as to let me know if there is any one I can send any broth to at anytime . ”
6389	6398	6400	6400	he	145	“ Thank you ; you are very good ; ”
6406	6420	6346	6346	her	138	“ I shall have the pleasure of sending you down a few names . ”
6421	6431	6433	6433	Rachel	128	“ I never did approve the broken victual system , ”
6435	6440	6433	6433	Rachel	128	“ it creates dependence . ”
6441	6447	6449	6449	Fanny	127	“ Come here , Hubert , ”
6460	6469	6449	6449	Fanny	127	“ come and shake hands with Mr. Touchett . ”
6578	6599	6570	6570	Rachel	128	“ We can decide nothing yet ; I have made up my mind to teach the little boys at present . ”
6600	6605	6614	6617	the perplexed Lady Temple	680	“ Oh , indeed ! ”
6606	6612	6614	6617	the perplexed Lady Temple	680	“ It is very kind , ”
6619	6647	6614	6617	the perplexed Lady Temple	680	“ I beg your pardon , I only thought , in case you were wishing for some one , that Miss Williams will be at liberty shortly . ”
6648	6664	6666	6666	Rachel	128	“ I do not imagine Miss Williams is the person to deal with little boys , ”
6668	6683	6666	6666	Rachel	128	“ In fact , I think that home teaching is always better than hired . ”
6684	6691	6693	6693	Fanny	127	“ I am so much obliged , ”
6887	6909	6880	6880	Rachel	128	“ It is very sad . If you want to help the poor things , I will give anything I can . ”
6910	6956	6957	6957	Fanny	127	“ Oh , yes , thank you , but it is doleful merely to help them to linger out the remnant of a life consumed upon these cobwebs of vanity . It is the fountainhead that must be reached — the root of the system ! ”
6986	6993	6995	6995	Rachel	128	“ Lace and lacemakers are facts , ”
6997	7039	6995	6995	Rachel	128	“ but if the middle men were exploded , and the excess of workers drafted off by some wholesome outlet , the price would rise , so that the remainder would be at leisure to fulfil the domestic offices of womanhood . ”
7047	7056	7060	7060	Fanny	127	“ I beg your pardon , dear Rachel , ”
7062	7067	7069	7069	Rachel	128	“ I do declare , ”
7091	7108	7072	7072	Grace	127	“ poor Fanny ’s a perfect slave . One ca n’t get in a word edgeways . ”
7268	7278	7255	7256	the Major	5023	“ Did you let him think we should quarrel ? ”
7279	7296	7255	7256	the Major	5023	“ Oh , no , my dear ; but it might not agree with the children . ”
7297	7334	7255	7256	the Major	5023	“ Avonmouth ! Grace , do you hear what heresy Fanny has been learning ? Why , the proportion of ozone in the air here has been calculated to be five times that of even Aveton ! ”
7335	7340	7343	7343	Fanny	127	“ Yes , dearest , ”
7352	7375	7343	7343	Fanny	127	“ there is no place like Avonmouth , and I am sure the Major will think so when he has seen it . ”
7376	7387	7255	7256	the Major	5023	“ But what has he to do with your movements ? ”
7388	7393	7395	7395	Fanny	127	“ Sir Stephen wished — ”
7397	7419	7421	7421	Conrade	126	“ The Major is military secretary , and always settles our head - quarters , and no one interferes with him , ”
7884	7888	7889	7889	she	4964	“ Never mind , ”
7892	7906	7889	7889	she	4964	“ this salt wind is delightful . How like old times it is ! ”
7961	7969	7971	7971	Francis	139	“ It is all ugly and cold , ”
7978	7991	7971	7971	Francis	139	“ I shall go home to Melbourne when I ’m a man . ”
7992	8000	8002	8002	Conrade	126	“ And you will come , mamma ? ”
8153	8171	8173	8173	Fanny	127	“ What have you done to the dear old room — do you not use it still ? ”
8175	8182	8184	8184	Rachel	128	“ Yes , I work here , ”
8198	8213	8215	8215	Rachel	128	“ I have hitherto ground on at after - education and self - improvement , ”
8217	8241	8215	8215	Rachel	128	“ now I trust to make my preparation available for others . I will undertake any of your boys if you wish it . ”
8242	8250	8184	8184	Rachel	128	“ Thank you ; but what is that box?”—in
8261	8267	8269	8269	Grace	127	“ It is her dispensary , ”
8271	8274	8276	8276	Rachel	128	“ Yes , ”
8278	8294	8276	8276	Rachel	128	“ you are weak and nervous , and I have just the thing for you . ”
8295	8300	8215	8215	Rachel	128	“ Is it homoeopathy ? ”
8301	8364	8365	8365	Fanny	127	“ Yes , here is my book . I have done great things in my district , and should do more but for prejudice . There , this globule is the very thing for your case ; I made it out last night in my book . That is right , and I wanted to ask you some questions about little Wilfred . ”
8583	8591	8593	8593	Fanny	127	“ I was thinking of asking you , ”
8595	8610	8593	8593	Fanny	127	“ if there is any one here who would come as a daily governess . ”
8611	8614	8616	8616	Rachel	128	“ Oh ! ”
8618	8641	8616	8616	Rachel	128	“ these two would be much better at school , and I would form the little ones , who are still manageable . ”
8642	8651	8653	8654	his mother	619	“ Conrade is not eight years old yet , ”
8660	8683	8653	8654	his mother	619	“ and the Major said I need not part with him till he has grown a little more used to English ways . ”
8684	8692	8694	8694	Grace	127	“ He can read , I see , ”
8696	8710	8694	8694	Grace	127	“ and he told me he had done some Latin with the Major . ”
8711	8791	8653	8654	his mother	619	“ Yes , he has picked up a vast deal of information , and on the voyage the Major used to teach him out of a little pocket Virgil . The Major said it would not be of much use at school , as there was no dictionary ; but that the discipline and occupation would be useful , and so they were . Conrade , will do anything for the Major , and indeed so will they all . ”
8809	8829	8806	8806	she	128	“ I could undertake the next pair of boys easily , but these two are evidently wanting school discipline . ”
8842	8881	8830	8831	Lady Temple	138	“ You do not know Conrade . He is so trustworthy and affectionate , dear boy , and they are both always good with me . The Major said it often hurts boys to send them too young . ”
8882	8892	8894	8895	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ They are very young , poor little fellows , ”
8897	8912	8914	8914	Fanny	127	“ And if they are forward in some things they are backward in others , ”
8916	8936	8914	8914	Fanny	127	“ What Major Keith recommended was a governess , who would know what is generally expected of little boys . ”
8937	8945	8947	8947	Rachel	128	“ I do n’t like half measures , ”
8949	8966	8947	8947	Rachel	128	“ I do not approve of encouraging young women to crowd the overstocked profession of governesses . ”
8980	8988	8990	8990	Rachel	128	“ Is it not a flagrant abuse , ”
8992	9060	8990	8990	Rachel	128	“ that whether she have a vocation or not , every woman of a certain rank , who wishes to gain her own livelihood , must needs become a governess ? A nursery maid must have a vocation , but an educated or half - educated woman has no choice ; and educator she must become , to her own detriment , and that of her victims . ”
9061	9073	9075	9075	Fanny	127	“ I always did think governesses often much to be pitied , ”
9084	9117	9075	9075	Fanny	127	“ What ’s the use of pity if one runs on in the old groove ? We must prevent the market from being drugged , by diverting the supply into new lines . ”
9118	9125	9127	9127	Fanny	127	“ Are there any new lines ? ”
9139	9143	9145	9145	Grace	127	“ Homoeopathic doctresses , ”
9179	9226	9167	9167	she	127	“ Why not — I ask why not ? Some women have broken through prejudice , and why should not others ? Do you not agree with me , Fanny , that female medical men — I mean medical women — would be an infinite boon ? ”
9227	9240	9127	9127	Fanny	127	“ It would be very nice if they would never be nervous . ”
9241	9295	9167	9167	she	127	“ Nerves are merely a matter of training . Think of the numbers that might be removed from the responsibility of incompetently educating ! I declare that to tempt a person into the office of governess , instead of opening a new field to her , is the most short - sighted indolence . ”
9296	9306	9308	9308	Fanny	127	“ I do n’t want to tempt any one , ”
9310	9353	9308	9308	Fanny	127	“ She ought to have been out before and be experienced , only she most be kind to the poor boys . I wanted the Major to inquire in London , but he said perhaps I might hear of some one here . ”
9354	9362	9364	9365	her aunt	610	“ That was right , my dear , ”
9367	9383	9364	9365	her aunt	610	“ A gentleman , an officer , could not do much in such a matter . ”
9384	9393	9308	9308	Fanny	127	“ He always does manage whatever one wants . ”
9413	9418	9420	9420	Grace	127	“ I was thinking , ”
9422	9445	9420	9420	Grace	127	“ that I believe the people at the Cliff Cottages are going away , and that Miss Williams might be at liberty . ”
9446	9460	9462	9462	Rachel	128	“ Did n’t I know that Grace would come out with Miss Williams ? ”
9464	9480	9462	9462	Rachel	128	“ A regular eruption of the Touchettomania . We have had him already advertising her . ”
9481	9485	9487	9488	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Miss Williams ! ”
9490	9524	9487	9488	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Yes , she might suit you very well . I believe they are very respectable young women , poor things ! I have always wished that we could do more for them . ”
9525	9528	9530	9530	Fanny	127	“ Who ? ”
9532	9540	9542	9542	Rachel	128	“ Certain pets of Mr. Touchett ’s , ”
9544	9566	9542	9542	Rachel	128	“ some of the numerous ladies whose mission is that curatolatry into which Grace would lapse but for my strenuous efforts . ”
9567	9580	9582	9582	Grace	127	“ I do n’t quite know why you call them his pets , ”
9584	9598	9582	9582	Grace	127	“ except that he knew their antecedents , and told us about them . ”
9599	9640	9642	9642	Rachel	128	“ Exactly , that was enough , for me . I perfectly understand the meaning of Mr. Touchett ’s recommendations , and if what Fanny wants is a commonplace sort of upper nursemaid , I dare say it would do . ”
9660	9668	9670	9670	Grace	127	“ One sister is a great invalid , ”
9672	9765	9670	9670	Grace	127	“ quite a cripple , and the other goes out as a daily governess . They are a clergyman ’s daughters , and once were very well off , but they lost everything through some speculation of their brother . I believe he fled the country under some terrible suspicion of dishonesty ; and though no one thought they had anything to do with it , their friends dropped them because they would not give him up , nor believe him guilty , and a little girl of his lives with them . ”
9766	9770	9772	9773	Lady Temple	138	“ Poor things ! ”
9775	9790	9772	9773	Lady Temple	138	“ I should very much like to employ this one . How very sad . ”
9791	9808	9810	9811	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Mrs. Grey told me that her children had never done so well with any one , ”
9813	9846	9810	9811	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ She wanted to engage Miss Williams permanently , but could not induce her to leave her sister , or even to remove her to London , on account of her health . ”
9847	9855	9857	9857	Fanny	127	“ Do you know her , Grace ? ”
9859	9919	9857	9857	Fanny	127	“ I have called once or twice , and have been very much pleased with the sick sister ; but Rachel does not fancy that set , you see . I meet the other at the Sunday school , I like her looks and manner very much , and she is always at the early service before her work . ”
9920	9928	9930	9930	Rachel	128	“ Just like a little mauve book ! ”
9936	9954	9932	9932	Fanny	127	“ You go , do n’t you , Rachel ? How we used to wish for it ! ”
9955	9964	9966	9966	Rachel	128	“ You have wished and we have tried , ”
9972	9977	9979	9979	Grace	127	“ Yes , Rachel , ”
9981	10005	9979	9979	Grace	127	“ but with all drawbacks , all disappointments in ourselves , it is a great blessing . We would not be without it . ”
10006	10017	10019	10019	Rachel	128	“ I could not be satisfied in relinquishing it voluntarily , ”
10021	10108	10019	10019	Rachel	128	“ but I am necessarily one of the idle . Were I one of the occupied , laborare est orare would satisfy me , and that poor governess ought to feel the same . Think of the physical reaction of body on mind , and tell me if you could have the barbarity of depriving that poor jaded thing of an hour ’s sleep , giving her an additional walk , fasting , in all weathers , and preparing her to be savage with the children . ”
10109	10122	9979	9979	Grace	127	“ Perhaps it refreshes her , and hinders her from being cross . ”
10123	10158	9979	9979	Grace	127	“ Maybe she thinks so ; but if she have either sense or ear , nothing would so predispose her to be cross as the squeaking of Mr. Touchett ’s penny - whistle choir . ”
10159	10164	10166	10167	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Poor Mr. Touchett , ”
10169	10180	10166	10167	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ I wish he would not make such ambitious attempts . ”
10181	10189	10191	10191	Fanny	127	“ But you like the choral service , ”
10201	10226	9979	9979	Grace	127	“ When all the men of a regiment chant together you can not think how grand it is , almost finer than the cathedral . ”
10227	10236	10238	10238	Rachel	128	“ Yes , where you can do it , ”
10240	10248	10238	10238	Rachel	128	“ but not where you ca n’t . ”
10249	10259	10261	10261	Grace	127	“ I wish you would not talk about it , ”
10263	10279	10261	10261	Grace	127	“ I must , or Fanny will not understand the state of parties at Avonmouth . ”
10280	10289	10238	10238	Rachel	128	“ Parties ! Oh , I hope not . ”
10290	10340	10261	10261	Grace	127	“ My dear child , party spirit is another word for vitality . So you thought the church we sighed for had made the place all we sighed to see it , and ourselves too . Oh ! Fanny is this what you have been across the world for ? ”
10341	10346	10348	10348	Fanny	127	“ What is wrong ? ”
10352	10557	10558	10558	Fanny	127	“ Do you remember our axiom ? Build your church , and the rest will take care of itself . You remember our scraping and begging , and how that good Mr. Davison helped us out and brought the endowment up to the needful point for consecration , on condition the incumbency was given to him . He held it just a year , and was rich , and could help out his bad health with a curate . But first he went to Madeira , and then he died , and there we are , a perpetual curacy of £ 70 a year , no resident gentry but ourselves , a fluctuating population mostly sick , our poor demoralized by them , and either crazed by dissent , or heathenized by their former distance from church . Who would take us ? No more Mr. Davisons ! There was no more novelty , and too much smartness to invite self - devotion . So we were driven from pillar to post till we settled down into this Mr. Touchett , as good a being as ever lived , working as hard as any two , and sparing neither himself nor any one else . ”
10565	10589	10558	10558	Fanny	127	“ But he has two misfortunes . He was not born a gentleman , and his mind does not measure an inch across . ”
10590	10616	10827	10828	Poor Fanny	127	“ Rachel , my dear , it is not fair to prejudice Fanny ; I am sure the poor man is very well - behaved . ”
10617	10632	10558	10558	Fanny	127	“ Mother ! would you be calling the ideal Anglican priest , poor man ? ”
10633	10641	10643	10643	Fanny	127	“ I thought he was quite gentlemanlike , ”
10645	10654	10656	10656	Rachel	128	“ Gentlemanlike ! ay , that ’s it , ”
10658	10675	10656	10656	Rachel	128	“ just so like as to delight the born curatolatress , like Grace and Miss Williams . ”
10676	10683	10685	10685	Fanny	127	“ Would it hurt the children ? ”
10693	10701	10703	10703	Rachel	128	“ Yes , if it infected you , ”
10709	10722	10703	10703	Rachel	128	“ A mother of contracted mind forfeits the allegiance of her sons . ”
10723	10736	10738	10741	the gentle young widow	757	“ Oh , Rachel , I know I am weak and silly , ”
10745	10765	10738	10741	the gentle young widow	757	“ but the Major said if I only tried to do my duty by them I should be helped . ”
10766	10775	10777	10777	Rachel	128	“ And I will help you , Fanny , ”
10779	10797	10777	10777	Rachel	128	“ All that is requisite is good sense and firmness , and a thorough sense of responsibility . ”
10798	10826	10827	10828	Poor Fanny	127	“ That is what is so dreadful . The responsibility of all those dear fatherless boys , and if — if I should do wrong by them . ”
10990	11044	11045	11045	she	764	“ I am not vexed , dear Rachel , I know you are right . I am not clever enough to bring them up properly , but if I try hard , and pray for them , it may be made up to them . And you will help me , Rachel dear , ”
11222	11227	11211	11214	executor to the will	769	“ see about it , ”
11340	11354	11356	11356	Fanny	127	“ I did not like putting such a charge on my dear aunt , ”
11358	11400	11356	11356	Fanny	127	“ but the Major said I ought to appoint a relation , and I had no one else ! And I knew you would all be good to them , if they had lost me too , when baby was born . ”
11401	11407	11409	11409	Rachel	128	“ We would have tried , ”
11415	11428	11409	11409	Rachel	128	“ but oh ! I am glad you are here , Fanny ! ”
11439	11444	11436	11437	the Major	5023	“ seen about it . ”
11515	11518	11520	11520	Rachel	128	“ Selfish , ”
11522	11547	11520	11520	Rachel	128	“ if he will only stay away long enough , you shall learn , my dear , how well you can do without him ! ”
11677	11708	11718	11718	Fanny	127	“ Now , Fanny , since it seems that more can not be done at present , let us see about the children ’s education . Where are their books ? ”
11709	11716	11718	11718	Fanny	127	“ We have very few books , ”
11722	11732	11718	11718	Fanny	127	“ we had not much choice where we were . ”
11733	11744	11718	11718	Fanny	127	“ You should have written to me for a selection . ”
11745	11799	11801	11801	Fanny	127	“ Why — so we would , but there was always a talk of sending Conrade and Francis home . I am afraid you will think them very backward , dear Rachel , especially Francie ; but it is not their fault , dear children , and they are not used to strangers , ”
11805	11815	11817	11817	Rachel	128	“ I do not mean to be a stranger , ”
11847	11852	11843	11843	her	128	“ Conrade , Francis ! ”
11858	11860	11856	11856	She	128	“ Conrade ”
11870	11883	11856	11856	She	128	“ where can they be — not gone down on the beach ? ”
11884	11894	11896	11897	the mother	4964	“ Oh , dear no , I trust not , ”
11948	11983	11984	11984	Rachel	128	“ Oh , my dears , what figures you are ! Go to Coombe and get yourselves brushed , and wash your hands , and then come down , and bring your lesson books . ”
12031	12041	12043	12043	Rachel	128	“ But you are not living in state here , ”
12045	12066	12043	12043	Rachel	128	“ I never could enter into the cult some people , mamma especially , pay to their drawing - room . ”
12067	12084	12086	12086	Fanny	127	“ The Major used to be very particular about their not coming to sit down untidy , ”
12088	12098	12086	12086	Fanny	127	“ He said it was not good for anybody . ”
12172	12176	12169	12170	Mrs. Marcet	159	“ Little Willie . ”
12210	12222	12223	12223	she	128	“ I do n’t know what can be done with these ! ”
12226	12242	12244	12244	Conrade	126	“ Oh , then we ’ll have holidays till we have got books , mamma , ”
12259	12275	12277	12277	Rachel	128	“ It is very necessary to see what kind of books you ought to have , ”
12279	12288	12277	12277	Rachel	128	“ How far have you gone in this ? ”
12289	12295	12297	12297	Conrade	126	“ I say , mamma , ”
12299	12308	12297	12297	Conrade	126	“ we ca n’t do lessons without books . ”
12309	12332	12277	12277	Rachel	128	“ Attend to what your Aunt Rachel says , my dear ; she wants to find out what books you should have . ”
12333	12341	12342	12342	Conrade	126	“ Yes , let me examine you . ”
12367	12371	12361	12362	His mother	619	“ My dear ! ”
12372	12381	12350	12350	she	128	“ I thought she wanted to examine me , ”
12385	12400	12361	12362	His mother	619	“ When Dr. M’Vicar examines a thing , he puts it under a microscope . ”
12509	12520	12504	12504	Fanny	127	“ My dear , you can read better than that . ”
12534	12574	12521	12521	He	126	“ Mamma , are not we to have ponies ? Coombe heard of a pony this morning ; it is to be seen at the ‘ Jolly Mariner , ’ and he will take us to look at it . ”
12575	12598	12499	12499	she	128	“ The ‘ Jolly Mariner ! ’ It is a dreadful place , Fanny , you never will let them go there ? ”
12599	12614	12521	12521	He	126	“ My dear , the Major will see about your ponies when he comes . ”
12615	12625	12627	12627	Rachel	128	“ We will send the coachman down to inquire , ”
12629	12644	12646	12646	Conrade	126	“ He is only a civilian , and the Major always chooses our horses , ”
12648	12659	12661	12661	Francis	139	“ And I am to have one too , mamma , ”
12663	12688	12661	12661	Francis	139	“ You know I have been out four times with the staff , and the Major said I could ride as well as Con ! ”
12689	12703	12711	12712	his mother	619	“ Reading is what is wanted now , my dear , go on . ”
12839	12855	12824	12824	he	126	“ Five apples and eight apples , come , Conrade , what will they make ? ”
12856	12860	12824	12824	he	126	“ A pie . ”
12966	12973	12945	12945	he	139	“ Mamma never made him spell ; ”

13409	13433	13448	13448	Rachel	128	“ she had been very young , and Sir Stephen very old , and perhaps too much must not be expected of her . ”
13434	13446	13448	13448	Rachel	128	“ The grand passion of her life is yet to come , ”
13450	13455	13457	13457	Grace	127	“ I hope not , ”
13459	13467	13469	13469	Rachel	128	“ You may be certain of that , ”
13471	13519	13469	13469	Rachel	128	“ Feminine women always have it one time or other in their lives ; only superior ones are exempt . But I hope I may have influence enough to carry her past it , and prevent her taking any step that might be injurious to the children . ”
14758	14774	14735	14735	she	128	“ For shame , they are running away ! Conrade , Zack , have done ! ”
14809	14822	14789	14789	He	164	“ Please ma’am , he was meddling with our lobster - pot . ”
14823	14831	14833	14833	Conrade	126	“ I was n’t doing any harm , ”
14835	14852	14833	14833	Conrade	126	“ I was just looking in , and they all came and shied stones at us . ”
14853	14863	14865	14865	Rachel	128	“ I do n’t care how the quarrel began , ”
14867	14911	14865	14865	Rachel	128	“ You would not have run into it if you had been behaving properly . Zack was quite right to protect his father ’s property , but he might have been more civil . Now shake hands , and have done with it . ”
14912	14921	14923	14923	Francis	139	“ Not shake hands with a low boy , ”
14981	14995	14968	14968	his	126	“ There , that ’s in case I did the thing any harm . ”

15245	15266	15267	15269	The young birds	910	“ Oh , one egg ; there ’s no harm in taking that ; but this nest has young birds . ”

I am mastering them by degrees , and should do so sooner if I had them in my own hands , and no more worthy task can be done than training human beings for their work in this world , so I must be willing to go through a little while I bring them into order , and fit their mother for managing them . ”

15782	15793	15796	15796	Rachel	128	“ Well , that is much worse than I expected ! ”

15918	15939	15916	15916	Rachel	128	“ I received the boy ’s word , and it is my business to deal with the breach of promise . ”
15972	16000	15963	15963	she	128	“ Well , Conrade , I knew that you were violent and disobedient , but I never expected you to fail in your honour as a gentleman . ”
16001	16012	16015	16015	Conrade	126	“ I ’ll thrash any one who says I have , ”
16017	16041	16015	16015	Conrade	126	“ Then you must thrash me . You gave your word to me not to take your Aunt Grace ’s thrush ’s nest . ”
16042	16048	16050	16050	Conrade	126	“ And I did n’t , ”
16075	16084	16085	16085	she	128	“ I am shocked at you , Conrade , ”
16088	16137	16085	16085	she	128	“ I know your mamma will be exceedingly grieved . You must have fallen into very sad ways to be able to utter such a bold untruth . You had better confess at once , and then I shall have something to tell her that will comfort he . ”
16147	16171	16138	16138	Conrade	126	“ Come ; tell me you are sorry you took the nest , and have broken your word , and told a falsehood . ”
16186	16237	16085	16085	she	128	“ There is not the smallest use in denying it . I know you took it when you and Hubert went away together . Your Aunt Grace found it gone this morning , and one of the poor little birds dead below . What have you done with the others ? ”
16242	16256	16085	16085	she	128	“ Then I grieve to say I must tell all to your mother . ”
16318	16413	16312	16313	Lady Temple	138	“ Dear Fanny , I am very sorry to bring you so much vexation . I am afraid it will be a bitter grief to you , but it is only for Conrade ’s own sake that I do it . It was a cruel thing to take a bird’s - nest at all , but worse when he knew that his Aunt Grace was particularly fond of it ; and , besides , he had promised not to touch it , and now , saddest of all , he denies having done so . ”
16414	16421	16423	16423	Fanny	127	“ Oh , Conrade , Conrade ! ”
16428	16437	16423	16423	Fanny	127	“ You ca n’t have done like this ! ”
16438	16445	16447	16447	Conrade	126	“ So , I have not , ”
16475	16480	16482	16482	Rachel	128	“ Listen , Fanny , ”
16484	16510	16512	16512	she	127	“ I do not wonder that you are unwilling to believe anything so shocking , but I do not come without being only too certain . ”
16546	16559	16536	16536	she	127	“ Dear Con , do pray tell me if you did it . ”
16560	16565	16567	16567	Conrade	126	“ I did not , ”
16581	16586	16588	16588	Rachel	128	“ Where ’s Hubert ? ”
16629	16636	16638	16639	his mother	619	“ Come here , Hubert dear , ”
16641	16667	16638	16639	his mother	619	“ do n’t be frightened , only come and tell me where you and Con went yesterday , when the others were playing at bowls . ”
16679	16682	16668	16668	Hubert	141	“ Tell , ”
16686	16697	16668	16668	Hubert	141	“ Never mind her , she ’s only a civilian . ”
16698	16706	16668	16668	Hubert	141	“ Where did you go , Hubert ? ”
16707	16718	16668	16668	Hubert	141	“ Con showed me the little birds in their nest . ”
16719	16738	16668	16668	Hubert	141	“ That is right , Hubert , good little boy . Did you or he touch the nest ? ”
16739	16742	16668	16668	Hubert	141	“ Yes . ”
16755	16774	16746	16746	Conrade	126	“ Yes you did , Con , you touched the inside to see what it was made of . ”
16775	16784	16786	16786	Rachel	128	“ But what did you do with it ? ”
16788	16798	16800	16802	the little boy	676	“ Left it there , up in the tree , ”
16804	16809	16811	16812	the mother	4964	“ There , Rachel ! ”
16816	16825	16827	16827	Rachel	128	“ I do n’t know what you mean , ”
16831	16854	16827	16827	Rachel	128	“ only that Conrade is a worse boy than I had thought him , end has been teaching his little brother falsehood . ”
17004	17031	16993	16993	Fanny	127	“ Do you know , Rachel dear , I am convinced that it must be a mistake . Conrade assures me he never touched the nest . ”
17032	17039	17113	17113	Rachel	128	“ So he persists in it ? ”
17040	17074	17113	17113	Rachel	128	“ And indeed , Rachel dear , I can not help believing him . If it had been Francie , now ; but I never knew Conrade tell an untruth in his life . ”
17075	17086	16993	16993	Fanny	127	“ You never knew , because you always believe him . ”
17087	17112	17113	17113	Rachel	128	“ And it is not only me , but I have often heard the Major say he could always depend on Conrade ’s word . ”
17122	17152	17113	17113	Rachel	128	“ It must be dreadful to make such a discovery , but it was far worse to let deceit go on undetected ; and if only they were firm — ”
17166	17182	17113	17113	Rachel	128	“ Did n’t you lock the door ? Has he broken out ? How audacious ! ”
17183	17190	17192	17192	Fanny	127	“ I let him come out , ”
17194	17235	17113	17113	Rachel	128	“ there was nothing to shut him up for . I beg your pardon , dear Rachel ; I am very sony for the poor little birds and for Grace , but I am sure Conrade did not take it . ”
17236	17249	17251	17251	Rachel	128	“ How can you be so unreasonable , Fanny — the evidence , ”
17258	17264	17266	17266	Fanny	127	“ Do n’t you think , ”
17268	17279	17266	17266	Fanny	127	“ that some boy may have got into the park ? ”
17280	17355	17356	17356	Fanny	127	“ My dear Fanny , I am sorry for you , it is quite out of the question to think so ; the place is not a stone’s - throw from Randall ’s lodge . It will be the most fatal thing in the world to let your weakness be imposed on in this way . Now that the case is clear , the boy must be forced to confession , and severely punished . ”
17361	17417	17418	17418	She	127	“ I am very sorry for you , Fanny . I know it is very painful ; I assure you it is so to me . Perhaps it would be best if I were to lock him up , and go from time to time to see if he is come to a better mind . ”
17422	17429	17432	17432	Fanny	127	“ No , no , Rachel ! ”
17437	17492	17432	17432	Fanny	127	“ my boy has n’t done anything wrong , and I wo n’t have him locked up ! Go away ! If anything is to be done to my boys , I ’ll do it myself : they have n’t got any one but me . Oh , I wish the Major would come ! ”
17493	17509	17532	17533	the mother	4964	“ Fanny , how can you be so foolish?—as if I would hurt your boys ! ”
17510	17530	17532	17533	the mother	4964	“ But you wo n’t believe Conrade — my Conrade , that never told a falsehood in his life ! ”
17550	17564	17546	17546	her	4964	“ You want me to punish him for what he has n’t done . ”
17565	17577	17579	17579	Rachel	128	“ How much alike mothers are in all classes of life , ”
17610	17650	17607	17607	she	128	“ Well Fanny , one thing is clear , while you are so weak as to let that boy go on in his deceit , unrepentant and unpunished , I can have no more to do with his education . ”
17651	17654	17657	17657	Fanny	127	“ Indeed , ”
17659	17702	17657	17657	Fanny	127	“ I am afraid so , Rachel . You have taken a great deal of trouble , but Conrade declares he will never say a lesson to you again , and I do n’t quite see how to make him after this . ”
17703	17725	17607	17607	she	128	“ Oh , very well ; then there ’s an end of it . I am sorry for you , Fanny . ”
18002	18028	17988	17988	Fanny	127	“ Dear Rachel , I am so afraid I was hasty , I could not sleep without coming to tell you how sorry I am . ”
18029	18041	18180	18180	her	235	“ Then you are convinced ? I knew you would be . ”
18042	18174	18175	18176	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Oh , yes , I have just been sitting by him after he was gone to bed . He never goes to sleep till I have done that , and he always tells me if anything is on his mind . I could not ask him again , it would have been insulting him ; but he went over it all of himself , and owned he ought not to have put a finger on the edge of the nest , but he wanted so to see what it was lined with ; otherwise he never touched it . He says , poor boy , that it was only your being a civilian that made you not able to believe him , I am sure you must believe him now . ”
18300	18402	18403	18405	ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING	168	“ Oh ! and the squirting , dear Rachel ! I was so sorry when I found it out , it was only Francie and Leo . I was very angry with them for it , and I should like to make them ask pardon , only I do n’t think Francie would . I ’m afraid they are very rude boys . I must write to the Major to find me a governess that wo n’t be very strict with them , and if she could be an officer ’s daughter , the boys would respect her so much more . ”
18407	18442	18403	18405	ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING	168	“ Well , Grace , all things considered , perhaps I had better walk down with you to Mackarel Lane , and then I can form a judgment on these Williamses without committing Fanny . ”
18443	18454	18403	18405	ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING	168	“ Then you do not intend to go on teaching ? ”
18455	18472	18403	18405	ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING	168	“ Not while Conrade continues to brave me , and is backed up by poor Fanny . ”
18473	18494	18403	18405	ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING	168	“ I might speak to Miss Williams after church , and bring her in to Myrtlewood for Fanny to see . ”
18495	18531	18403	18405	ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING	168	“ Yes , that might do in time ; but I shall make up my mind first . Poor Fanny is so easily led that we must take care what influences fall in her way . ”
18532	18540	18403	18405	ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING	168	“ I always wished you would call . ”
18541	18575	18403	18405	ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING	168	“ Yes , and I would not by way of patronage to please Mr. Touchett , but this is for a purpose ; and I hope we shall find both sisters at home . ”
18694	18706	18708	18708	Rachel	143	“ A fine countenance ! what one calls a fine countenance ! ”
18710	18893	18686	18686	her	147	“ Is it a delusion of insipidity as usual ? The brow is good , massive , too much for the features , but perhaps they were fuller once ; eyes bright and vigorous , hazel , the colour for thought ; complexion meant to be brilliant brunette , a pleasant glow still ; hair with threads of grey . I hope she does not affect youth ; she ca n’t be less than one or two and thirty ! Many people set up for beauties with far less claim . What is the matter with her ? It is not the countenance of deformity — accident , I should say . Yes , it is all favourable except the dress . What a material ; what a pattern ! Did she get it second - hand from a lady’s - maid ? Will there be an incongruity in her conversation to match ? Let us see . Grace making inquiries — Quite at my best — Ah ! she is not one of the morbid sort , never thinking themselves better . ”
18894	18909	18686	18686	her	147	“ I was afraid , I had not seen you out for some time . ”
18910	18930	18686	18686	her	147	“ No ; going out is a troublesome business , and sitting in the garden answers the same purpose . ”
18931	18945	18686	18686	her	147	“ Of air , perhaps , but hardly of change or of view . ”
18946	18958	18959	18959	she	971	“ Oh ! I assure you there is a wonderful variety , ”
18969	18974	18976	18976	Rachel	143	“ Clouds and sunsets ? ”
18983	19063	18976	18976	Rachel	143	“ Yes , differing every day . Then I have the tamarisk and its inhabitants . There has been a tom - tit ’s nest every year since we came , and that provides us with infinite amusement . Besides the sea - gulls are often so good as to float high enough for me to see them . There is a wonderful charm in a circumcribed view , because one is obliged to look well into it all . ”
19064	19074	19076	19076	Rachel	143	“ Yes ; eyes and no eyes apply there , ”
19078	19093	19076	19076	Rachel	143	“ We found a great prize , too , the other day . Rosie ! ”
19123	19136	19137	19139	The little girl	507	“ My dear , will you show the sphynx to Miss Curtis ? ”
19190	19198	19200	19201	the child	975	“ Yes , till it buries itself , ”
19203	19213	19200	19201	the child	975	“ Aunt Ermine thinks it is the elephant sphynx . ”
19214	19221	19223	19224	the aunt	833	“ I can not be sure , ”
19226	19257	19223	19224	the aunt	833	“ my sister tried to find a figure of it at Villars ’ , but he had no book that gave the caterpillars . Do you care for those creatures ? ”
19258	19265	19267	19267	Grace	127	“ I like to watch them , ”
19269	19282	19267	19267	Grace	127	“ but I know nothing about them scientifically ; Rachel does that . ”
19283	19296	19298	19299	Miss Williams	147	“ Then can you help us to the history of our sphynx ? ”
19306	19316	19318	19318	Rachel	128	“ I will see if I have his portrait , ”
19320	19333	19318	19318	Rachel	128	“ but I doubt it . I prefer general principles to details . ”
19334	19351	19267	19267	Grace	127	“ Do n’t you find working out details the best way of entering into general principles ? ”
19382	19390	19375	19375	she	128	“ Naming and collecting is not science . ”
19391	19407	19318	19318	Rachel	128	“ And masonry is not architecture , but you ca n’t have architecture without it . ”
19408	19426	19375	19375	she	128	“ One can have broad ideas without all the petty work of flower botanists and butterfly naturalists . ”
19427	19464	19318	19318	Rachel	128	“ Do n’t you think the broad ideas would be rather of the hearsay order , at least to most people , unless their application were worked out in the trifle that came first to hand ? ”
19465	19469	19471	19471	Rachel	128	“ Experimental philosophy , ”
19501	19510	19512	19513	Miss Williams	147	“ If you like to call it so , ”
19522	19550	19512	19513	Miss Williams	147	“ For instance , the great art of mud pie taught us the porous nature of clay , the expansive power of steam , etc . etc . ”
19551	19562	19318	19318	Rachel	128	“ You had some one to improve it to you ? ”
19563	19595	19318	19318	Rachel	128	“ Oh dear no . Only afterwards , when we read of such things we remembered how our clay manufactures always burst in the baking unless they were well dried first . ”
19596	19608	19512	19513	Miss Williams	147	“ Then you had the rare power of elucidating a principle ? ”
19609	19626	19318	19318	Rachel	128	“ No , not I. My brother had ; but I could only perceive the confirmation . ”
19627	19657	19318	19318	Rachel	128	“ This reminds me of an interesting article on the Edgeworth system of education in the ‘ Traveller ’s Review . ’ I will send it down to you . ”
19658	19668	19512	19513	Miss Williams	147	“ Thank you , but I have it here . ”
19669	19686	19318	19318	Rachel	128	“ Indeed ; and do you not think it excellent , and quite agree with it ? ”
19687	19696	19704	19704	her	128	“ Yes , I quite agree with it , ”
19724	19728	19704	19704	her	128	“ Traveller ’s Review ”
19778	19811	19742	19742	Grace	127	“ She is generally at home by this time ; but this is her last day at Cliff Cottages , and she was to stay late to help in the packing up . ”
19812	19822	19824	19824	Grace	127	“ Will she be at home for the present ? ”
19826	19841	19842	19842	Grace	127	“ Yes , Rose and I are looking forward to a festival of her . ”
19856	19863	19854	19854	herself	128	“ My cousin , Lady Temple , ”
19939	19947	19949	19949	Grace	127	“ The room will be too full , ”
19974	19981	19969	19969	Rachel	128	“ I must see about it ; ”
20392	20401	20382	20383	her mother	496	“ I never expected to see you here . ”
20402	20409	20411	20411	Fanny	127	“ My aunt thought of it , ”
20413	20425	20411	20411	Fanny	127	“ and as she seems to find the children too much — ”
20585	20590	20592	20593	little Rose	186	“ So many ladies ! ”
20595	20606	20592	20593	little Rose	186	“ Aunt Ermine , have they made your head ache ? ”
20607	20649	20650	20651	The child	975	“ No , my dear , thank you , I am only tired . If you will pull out the rest for my feet , I will be quiet a little , and be ready for tea when Aunt Ailie comes . ”
20735	20765	20720	20720	She	975	“ Now I shall wish Augustus good night ; bring Violetta home from her play in the garden , and let her drink tea , and go to bed . ”
21019	21053	21008	21008	Rose	186	observed—“Violetta has been very good , and said all her lessons quite perfect , and she would like to sit up till her Aunt Ailie comes home . Do you think she may ? ”
21054	21064	21008	21008	Rose	186	“ Will she not be tired to - morrow ? ”
21065	21097	21008	21008	Rose	186	“ Oh , then she will be lazy , and not get up when she is called , till I pull all the clothes off , and that will be fun . ”
21098	21106	21008	21008	Rose	186	“ Or she may be fretful now ? ”
21116	21154	21008	21008	Rose	186	“ Now , my love ; that is taking a very unfair advantage of my promise . You will make your poor Aunt Ermine ’s head ache , and I shall have to send you to bed . ”
21155	21165	21008	21008	Rose	186	“ Would not a story pass away the time ? ”
21166	21190	21191	21192	The fairy	1029	“ You tell it , Aunt Ermine ; your stories are always the best . And let there be a fairy in it ! ”
21217	21236	21206	21206	Rose	186	“ Yes , Rosie — yes , Violetta ; what do you think I have got for you ? ”
21555	21558	21559	21559	she	177	“ There , ”
21567	21604	21559	21559	she	177	“ now we ’ll have a jubilee , and take you down under the East cliff , and we ’ll invest a shilling in ‘ Ivanhoe , ’ and Rose and Violetta shall open their ears ! ”
21605	21615	21559	21559	she	177	“ And you shall have a respectable Sunday mantle . ”
21616	21629	21559	21559	she	177	“ Oh , I dare say Julia will send us a box . ”
21630	21730	21559	21559	she	177	“ Then you will have to put a label on your back , ‘ Second - hand ! ’ or her velvet will be a scandal . I ca n’t wear out that at home like this flagrant , flowery thing , that I saw Miss Curtis looking at as rather a disreputable article . There ’s preferment for you , Ailie ! What do you think of a general ’s widow with six boys ? She is come after you . We had a great invasion — three Curtises and this pretty little widow , and various sons ! ”
21731	21736	21559	21559	she	177	“ Will she stay ? ”
21737	21777	21559	21559	she	177	“ Most likely , for she is a relation of Mrs. Curtis , and comes to be near her . You are to call for inspection at eleven o’clock tomorrow , so I fear your holiday will be short . ”
21778	21801	21559	21559	she	177	“ Well , the less play the less anxiety . How many drives will the six young gentlemen be worth to you ? ”
21802	21845	21559	21559	she	177	“ I am afraid it will be at the cost of tough work to you ; she looked to me too sweet a creature to have broken her sons in , but I should think she would be pleasant to deal with . ”
21846	21860	21559	21559	she	177	“ If she be like Miss Curtis , I am sure she will . ”
21861	21898	21559	21559	she	177	“ Miss Curtis ? My old friend you mean . She was rather suppressed today , and I began to comprehend the reason of the shudder with which Mr. Touchett speaks of the dogmatical young lady . ”
21899	21908	21559	21559	she	177	“ I hope she did not overwhelm you ! ”
21909	21973	21559	21559	she	177	“ Oh , no ! I rather liked her ; she was so earnest and spirited , I could fancy enjoying a good passage at arms with her if these were old times . But I hope she will not take the direction of your school - room , though she is an admirer of the educational papers in the ‘ Traveller . ’ ”
22020	22062	21559	21559	she	177	was—“Well , she is a very sweet creature . There is something indescribably touching in her voice and eyes , so soft and wistful , especially when she implores one not to be hard on those great scrambling boys of hers . ”
22063	22070	21559	21559	she	177	“ So she is your fate ? ”
22071	22108	21559	21559	she	177	“ Oh , yes , if there had been ten more engagements offered , I could not have helped accepting hers , even if it had not been on the best terms I have ever had . ”
22109	22112	21559	21559	she	177	“ What ? ”
22113	22221	21559	21559	she	177	“ Seventy — for the hours between nine and five . Pretty well for a journeyman hack , is it not ? Indeed , the pretty thing ’s only fear seemed to be that she was requiring too much , and offering too little . No , not her only fear , for there is some major in the distance to whose approval everything must be subject — uncle or guardian , I suppose , but he seemed to be rather an object of jealousy to the younger Miss Curtis , for every hint of wishing to wait for the Major made her press on the negotiations . ”
22222	22242	21559	21559	she	177	“ Seventy ! I hope you will make it do , Ailie . It would be a great relief . ”
22243	22314	21559	21559	she	177	“ And spare your brains not a little . Yes , I do trust to keeping it , for Lady Temple is delightful ; and as to the boys , I fancy it is only taming they want . The danger is , as Miss Rachel told me , whether she can bear the sight of the process . I imagine Miss Rachel herself has tried it , and failed . ”
22315	22320	22322	22322	Ermine	170	“ Part amateur work , ”
22326	22349	22322	22322	Ermine	170	“ It really is lucky you had to turn governess , Ailie , or there would have been a talent thrown away . ”
22350	22357	22359	22359	Alison	177	“ Stay till I have tried , ”
22506	22526	22503	22503	Hubert	141	“ You see , Aunt Rachel is only a civilian , and she has n’t any sense at all . ”
22550	22557	22543	22543	he	139	“ She was only a civilian . ”
22564	22580	22560	22560	she	177	“ At least she knew thus much , that the first military duty was obedience , ”
22630	22635	22636	22636	she	177	“ I sometimes suspect , ”
22639	22723	22636	22636	she	177	“ that he may have felt the influence of those winsome brown eyes and caressing manner , as I know I should if I were a man . I wonder how long the old general has been dead ? No , Ermine , you need not shake your head at me . I do n’t mean even to let Miss Curtis tell me if she would . I know confidences from partisan relations are the most mischief - making things in the world . ”
22843	22848	22878	22878	she	128	“ Traveller ’s Review , ”
22871	22876	22878	22878	she	128	“ It really seemed , ”
22883	22896	22878	22878	she	128	“ as if the more I talk , the less she says . ”
23311	23314	23320	23320	Grace	127	“ get on ”
23387	23390	23392	23392	Grace	127	“ Ah ! ”
23394	23430	23392	23392	Grace	127	“ Mr. Touchett was talking of getting the choir master from Avoncester , and giving up an afternoon to practice for Easter , but he never told me it was to be to - day . ”
23562	23589	23556	23556	she	127	“ Oh , no , it would be a great pleasure ; I always wish we could get more change and variety for her on Sunday . ”
23590	23604	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ She is very self - denying to spare you to the school . ”
23605	23685	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ I have often wished to give it up , but she never will let me . She says it is one of the few things we can do , and I see besides that it brings her fresh interests . She knows about all my class , and works for them , and has them to see her ; and I am sure it is better for her , though it leaves her more hours alone with Rose . ”
23686	23697	23556	23556	she	127	“ And the Sunday services are too long for her ? ”
23698	23750	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ Not so much that , as that she can not sit on those narrow benches unless two are put close together so that she can almost lie , and there is not room for her chair in the aisle on a Sunday . It is the greatest deprivation of all . ”
23751	23766	23768	23768	Grace	127	“ It is so sad , and she is so patient and so energetic , ”
23783	23813	23768	23768	Grace	127	“ You would say so , indeed , if you really knew her , or how she has found strength and courage for me through all the terrible sutfering . ”
23814	23822	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ Then does she suffer so much ? ”
23823	23838	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ Oh , no , not now ! That was in the first years . ”
23839	23846	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ It was not always so . ”
23847	23868	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ No , indeed ! You thought it deformity ! Oh , no , no ! she was so beautiful . ”
23869	23902	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ That she is still . I never saw my sister so much struck with any one . There is something so striking in her bright glance out of those clear eyes . ”
23903	23915	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ Ah ! if you had only seen her bloom before — ”
23916	23920	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ The accident ? ”
23921	23926	23928	23928	Alison	180	“ I burnt her , ”
23933	23946	23928	23928	Alison	180	“ You ! you , poor dear ! How dreadful for you . ”
23947	23954	23956	23956	Alison	180	“ Yes , I burnt her , ”
23961	24001	23956	23956	Alison	180	“ You ought not to be kind to me without knowing about it . It was an accident of course , but it was a fit of petulance . I threw a match without looking where it was going . ”
24002	24013	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ It must have been when you were very young . ”
24014	24076	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ Fourteen . I was in a naughty fit at her refusing to go to the great musical meeting with us . We always used to go to stay at one of the canon ’s houses for it , a house where one was dull and shy ; and I could not bear going without her , nor understand the reason . ”
24077	24084	23956	23956	Alison	180	“ And was there a reason ? ”
24085	24131	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ Yes , poor dear Ermine . She knew he meant to come there to meet her , and she thought it would not be right ; because his father had objected so strongly , and made him exchange into a regiment on foreign service . ”
24132	24140	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ And you did not know this ? ”
24141	24250	23956	23956	Alison	180	“ No , I was away all the time it was going on , with my eldest sister , having masters in London . I did not come home till it was all over , and then I could not understand what was the matter with the house , or why Ermine was unlike herself , and papa restless and anxious about her . They thought me too young to be told , and the atmosphere made me cross and fretful , and papa was displeased with me , and Ermine tried in vain to make me good ; poor patient Ermine , even then the chief sufferer ! ”
24251	24268	23518	23519	Alison Williams	180	“ I can quite imagine the discomfort and fret of being in ignorance all the time . ”
24269	24357	24358	24358	She	1084	“ Dear Ermine says she longed to tell me , but she had been forbidden , and she went on blaming herself and trying to make me enjoy my holidays as usual , till this dreadful day , when I had worried her intolerably about going to this music meeting , and she found reasoning only made me worse . She still wrote her note of refusal , and asked me to light the taper ; I dashed down the match in a frenzy of temper and — ”
24369	24517	24364	24364	Grace	127	“ We did not see it at first , and then she threw herself down and ordered me not to come near . Every one was there directly , I believe , but it burst out again and again , and was not put out till they all thought she had not an hour to live . There was no pain , and there she lay , all calmness , comforting us all , and making papa and Edward promise to forgive me — me , who only wished they would kill me ! And the next day he came ; he was just going to sail , and they thought nothing would hurt her then . I saw him while he was waiting , and never did I see such a fixed deathly face . But they said she found words to cheer and soothe him . ”
24518	24525	23956	23956	Alison	180	“ And what became of him ? ”
24526	24667	23956	23956	Alison	180	“ We do not know . As long as Lady Alison lived ( his aunt ) she let us hear about him , and we knew he was recovering from his wound . Then came her death , and then my father ’s , and all the rest , and we lost sight of the Beauchamps . We saw the name in the Gazette as killed at Lucknow , but not the right Christian name nor the same rank ; but then , though the regiment is come home , we have heard nothing of him , and though she has never spoken of him to me , I am sure Ermine believes he is dead , and thinks of him as part of the sunshine of the old Beauchamp days — the sunshine whose reflection lasts one ’s life . ”
24668	24675	24677	24677	Grace	127	“ He ought to be dead , ”
24679	24808	24677	24677	Grace	127	“ Yes , it would be better for her than to hear anything else of him ! He had nothing of his own , so there would have been a long waiting , but his father and brother would not hear of it , and accused us of entrapping him , and that angered my father . For our family is quite good , and we were very well off then . My father had a good private fortune besides the Rectory at Beauchamp ; and Lady Alison , who had been like a mother to us ever since our own died , quite thought that the prospect was good enough , and I believe got into a great scrape with her family for having promoted the affair . ”
24809	24815	23956	23956	Alison	180	“ Your squire ’s wife ? ”
24816	24866	23956	23956	Alison	180	“ Yes , and Julia and Ermine had come every day to learn lessons with her daughters . I was too young ; but as long as she lived we were all like one family . How kind she was ! How she helped us through those frightful weeks ! ”
24867	24880	24677	24677	Grace	127	“ Of your sister ’s illness ? It must have lasted long ? ”
24881	25081	23956	23956	Alison	180	“ Long ? Oh longer than long ! No one thought of her living . The doctors said the injury was too extensive to leave any power of rallying ; but she was young and strong , and did not die in the torture , though people said that such an existence as remained to her was not worth the anguish of struggling back to it . I think my father only prayed that she might suffer less , and Julia stayed on and on , thinking each day would be the last , till Dr. Long could not spare her any longer ; and then Lady Alison nursed her night after night and day after day , till she had worn herself into an illness , and when the doctors spoke of improvement , we only perceived worse agony . It was eight months before she was even lifted up in bed , and it was years before the burns ceased to be painful or the constitution at all recovered the shock ; and even now weather tells on her , though since we have lived here she has been far better than I ever dared to hope . ”
25082	25090	23956	23956	Alison	180	“ Then you consider her still recovering ? ”
25091	25147	24677	24677	Grace	127	“ In general health she is certainly greatly restored , and has strength to attempt more , but the actual injury , the contraction , can never be better than now . When we lived at Richmond she had constantly the best advice , and we were told that nothing more could be hoped for . ”
25148	25171	23956	23956	Alison	180	“ I wonder more and more at her high spirits . I suppose that was what chiefly helped to carry her through ? ”
25172	25181	25183	25183	Alison	175	“ I have seen a good many people , ”
25187	25245	25183	25183	Alison	175	“ but I never did see any one so happy ! Others are always wanting something ; she never is . Every enjoyment seems to be tenfold to her what it is to other people ; she sees the hopeful side of every sorrow . No burthen is a burthen when one has carried it to her . ”
25275	25284	25250	25250	she	175	“ The strain upraise of joy and praise . ”
25326	25334	25336	25337	the child	975	“ Aunt Ailie ! O Aunt Ailie ! ”
25366	25383	25347	25349	the little choir	1088	“ you should not have come , you were not to hear us till Trinity Sunday . ”
25427	25436	25438	25438	Grace	127	“ I am afraid it is my fault , ”
25440	25450	25438	25438	Grace	127	“ she has been telling me about your accident . ”
25451	25455	25457	25457	Ermine	170	“ Poor Ailie , ”
25459	25584	25585	25585	she	170	“ she never will receive kindness without having that unlucky story out ! It is just one of the things that get so cruelly exaggerated by consequences . It was one moment ’s petulance that might have caused a fright and been forgotten ever after , but for those chemicals . Ah ! I see , she said nothing about them , because they were Edward ’s . They were some parcels for his experiments , gun cotton and the like , which were lying in the window till he had time to take them upstairs . We had all been so long threatened with being blown up by his experiments that we had grown callous and careless , and it served us right ! ”
25615	25717	25585	25585	she	170	“ Yes , Rosie , when you go and keep house for papa on the top of the Oural Mountains , or wherever it may be , you are to remember that if Aunt Ermine had not been in a foolish , inattentive mood , and had taken his dangerous goods out of the way , she might have been trotting to church now like other people . But poor Ailie has always helped herself to the whole blame , and if every childish fit of temper were the root of such qualities , what a world we should have here ! ”
25718	25729	25585	25585	she	170	“ Ah ! no wonder she is devoted to you . ”
25730	25824	25825	25825	she	1095	“ The child was not fifteen , had never known cross or care , but from that moment she never was out of my room if it was possible to be in ; and when nurse after nurse was fairly worn out , because I could not help being so distressing , there was always that poor child , always handy and helpful , growing to be the chief dependence , and looking so piteously imploring whatever was tried , that it really helped me to go through with it . Poor Ailie , ”
25834	25875	25876	25876	she	1095	“ I always fancied those frowns of anxiety made her eyebrows grow together . And ever since we came here , we know how she has worked away for her old cinder and her small Rosebud , do n’t we ? ”
25923	25960	25910	25910	she	1095	“ You gossiping Ailie , to go ripping up old grievances . I am going to ask Miss Curtis not to let the story go any farther , now you have relieved your mind of it . ”
25961	25968	25970	25970	Alison	175	“ I did tell Lady Temple , ”
25972	25994	25970	25970	Alison	175	“ I never think it right not to let people know what sort of person they have to teach their children . ”
26046	26056	26036	26036	She	127	by—“Ah , poor thing ; how sad for her ! ”
26219	26222	26188	26188	Ermine	170	“ Edward ; ”
26298	26301	26297	26297	Grace	127	“ got on ”
27020	27026	27044	27046	the excellent Zack	164	“ singing for the parson , ”
27437	27451	27454	27455	Miss Williams	180	“ I am resigned to disappointments ; I have seen something of life . ”—“You
27466	28164	27454	27455	Miss Williams	180	” There was one who would have smoothed matters far better than any , who , like Ermine , took her weapons from the armoury of good sense ; but that person was entirely unconscious how the incumbent regarded her soft eyes , meek pensiveness , motherly sweetness , and , above all , the refined graceful dignity that remained to her from the leading station she had occupied . Her gracious respect towards her clergyman was a contrast as much to the deferential coquetry of his admirers as to the abruptness of his foe , and her indifference to parish details had even its charm in a world of fussiness ; he did not know himself how far a wish of hers would have led him , and she was the last person to guess . She viewed him , like all else outside her nursery , as something out of the focus of her eye ; her instinct regarded her clergyman as necessarily good and worthy , and her ear heard Rachel railing at him ; it sounded hard , but it was a pity Rachel should be vexed and interfered with . In fact , she never thought of the matter at all ; it was only part of that outer kind of dreamy stage - play at Avonmouth , in which she let herself he moved about at her cousin ’s bidding . One part of her life had passed away from her , and what remained to her was among her children ; her interests and intelligence seemed contracted to Conrade ’s horizon , and as to everything else , she was subdued , gentle , obedient , but slow and obtuse . Yet , little as he knew it , Mr. Touchett might have even asserted his authority in a still more trying manner . If the gentle little widow had not cast a halo round her relatives , he could have preached that sermon upon the home - keeping duties of women , or have been too much offended to accept any service from the Curtis family ; and he could have done without them , for he had a wide middle - class popularity ; his manners with the second - rate society , in which he had been bred , were just sufficiently superior and flattering to recommend all his best points , and he obtained plenty of subscriptions from visitors , and of co - operation from inhabitants . Many a young lady was in a flutter at the approach of the spruce little figure in black , and so many volunteers were there for parish work , that districts and classes were divided and subdivided , till it sometimes seemed as if the only difficulty was to find poor people enough who would submit to serve as the corpus vile for their charitable treatment . For it was not a really poor population . The men were seafaring , the women lacemaking , and just well enough off to make dissent doubly attractive as an escape from some of the interfering almsgiving of the place . Over - visiting , criticism of dress , and inquisitorial examinations had made more than one Primitive Methodist , and no severe distress had been so recent as to render the women tolerant of troublesome weekly inspections . The Curtis sisters were , however , regarded as an exception ; they were viewed as real gentlefolks , not only by their own tenants , but by all who were conscious of their hereditary claims to respect ; they did not care whether hair were long or short , and their benefits were more substantial and reliable than could be looked for from the casual visitors and petty gentry around , so that sundry houses that were forbidden ground to district visitors , were ready to grant them a welcome . One of these belonged to the most able lacemaker in the place , a hard - working woman , who kept seven little pupils in a sort of cupboard under the staircase , with a window into the back garden , “
28167	28171	27454	27455	Miss Williams	180	” said she , “
28190	28526	28172	28172	they	1165	” these gapsies consisting of the very scanty traffic of the further end of Mackarel Lane . For ten hours a day did these children work in a space just wide enough for them to sit , with the two least under the slope of the stairs , permitted no distraction from their bobbins , but invaded by their mistress on the faintest sound of tongues . Into this hotbed of sprigs was admitted a child who had been a special favourite at school , an orphan niece of the head of the establishment . The two brothers had been lost together at sea ; and while the one widow became noted for her lace , the other , a stranger to the art , had maintained herself by small millinery , and had not sacrificed her little girl to the Moloch of lace , but had kept her at school to a later age than usual in the place . But the mother died , and the orphan was at once adopted by the aunt , with the resolve to act the truly kind part by her , and break her in to lacemaking . That determination was a great blow to the school visitors ; the girls were in general so young , or so stupefied with their work , that an intelligent girl like Lovedy Kelland was no small treasure to them ; there were designs of making her a pupil teacher in a few years , and offers and remonstrances rained in upon her aunt . But they had no effect ; Mrs. Kelland was persuaded that the child had been spoilt by learning , and in truth poor Lovedy was a refractory scholar ; she was too lively to bear the confinement patiently ; her mind was too much awake not to rebel against the dulness , and her fingers had not been brought into training early enough . Her incessant tears spoilt her thread , and Mrs. Kelland decided that “
28541	28649	28534	28534	she	1166	” which breaking was attempted by a summary pawning of all poor Lovedy ’s reward books . The poor child confided her loss to her young lady teacher at the Sunday school ; the young lady , being new , young , and inflammable , reproached Mrs. Kelland with dishonesty and tyranny to the orphan , and in return was nearly frightened out of her wits by such a scolding as only such a woman as the lace mistress could deliver . Then Mr. Touchett tried his hand , and though he did not meet with quite so much violence , all he heard was that she had “
28703	28960	28682	28682	She	121	” And when the next district visitor came that way , the door was shut in her face , with the tract thrown out at the opening , and an intimation in Mrs. Kelland ’s shrill voice , that no more bukes were wanted ; she got plenty from Miss Curtis . These bukes from Miss Curtis were sanatory tracts , which Rachel was constantly bestowing , and which on Sundays Mrs. Kelland spelt through , with her finger under the line , in happy ignorance whether the subject were temporal or spiritual , and feeling herself in the exemplary discharge of a Sunday duty . Moreover , old feudal feeling made Rachel be unmolested when she came down twice a week , opened the door of the blackhole under the stairs , and read aloud something religious , something improving , and a bit of a story , following it up by mental arithmetic and a lesson on objects , which seemed to Mrs. Kelland the most arrant nonsense in the world , and to her well - broken scholars was about as interesting as the humming of a blue - bottle fly ; but it was poor Lovedy ’s one enjoyment , though making such havoc of her work that it was always expiated by extra hours , not on her pillow , but at it . These visits of Rachel were considered to encourage the Kelland refractoriness , and it was officially intimated that it would be wise to discontinue them , and that “
28965	29103	28682	28682	She	121	” to withdraw from Mrs. Kelland all that direct patronage of her trade , by which the ladies had enabled her to be in some degree independent of the middle - men , who absorbed so much of the profit from the workers . Grace and Rachel , sufficiently old inhabitants to remember the terrible wreck that had left her a struggling widow , felt this a hard , not to say a vindictive decision . They had long been a kind of agents for disposing of her wares at a distance ; and , feeling that the woman had received provocation , Grace was not disposed to give her up , while Rachel loudly averred that neither Mr. Touchett nor any of his ladies had any right to interfere , and she should take no notice . “
29106	29110	28682	28682	She	121	” said Grace , “
29122	29123	29127	29127	he	1170	” “
29192	29193	29187	29188	Mr. Touchett	145	” “
29204	29256	29196	29196	I	0	” said Grace , quietly , and she remained wishing it after Rachel had said a great deal more ; but the upshot of it was , that one day when Grace and Fanny were walking together on the esplanade , they met Mr. Touchett , and Grace said to him , “
29313	29314	29305	29305	she	189	” “
29318	29323	29305	29305	she	189	” said Mr. Touchett , “

29334	29341	29345	29345	she	189	” said Lady Temple , gently , “

29365	29370	29345	29345	she	189	” said Mr. Touchett , “

As to the victory , Rachel only laughed , and said , “
29549	29576	29544	29545	Mr. Touchett	145	” A few days after , Rachel made her appearance in Mackerel Lane , and announced her intention of consulting Ermine Williams under seal of secrecy . “

30007	30253	30004	30004	I	0	” Never did Madame de Genlis make a cleverer hit than in the reading of the Genius Phanor ’s tragedy in the Palace of Truth . Comically absurd as the inconsistency is of transporting the lecture of a Parisian academician into an enchanted palace , full of genii and fairies of the remotest possible connexion with the Arab jinn , the whole is redeemed by the truth to nature of the sole dupe in the Palace of Truth being the author reading his own works . Ermine was thinking of him all the time . She was under none of the constraint of Phanor ’s auditors , though she carried a perpetual palace of truth about with her ; she would not have had either fears or compunctions in criticising , if she could . The paper was in the essay style , between argument and sarcasm , something after the model of the Invalid ’s Letters ; but it was scarcely lightly touched enough , the irony was wormwood , the gravity heavy and sententious , and where there was a just thought or happy hit , it seemed to travel in a road - waggon , and be lost in the rumbling of the wheels . Ermine did not restrain a smile , half of amusement , half of relief , at the self - antidote the paper contained ; but the smile passed with the authoress as a tribute to her satire . “

31110	31122	31124	31124	Coombe	135	“ My lady sent a note to the Homestead this morning , ”
31126	31152	31153	31153	Rachel	128	“ She heard this morning that Colonel Keith intended to arrive to - day , and took the young gentlemen with her to meet him . ”
31176	31180	31181	31181	Coombe	135	“ It depended , ”
31184	31207	31181	31181	Coombe	135	“ upon the train ; it was not certain whether Colonel Keith would come by the twelve or the two o’clock train . ”
31232	31239	31225	31225	Alison	180	“ And who is Colonel Keith ? ”
31261	31283	31240	31240	Rachel	128	“ Colonel Keith ! why , the Major ! You have not been here so long without hearing of the Major ? ”
31284	31297	31299	31302	a more observant person	1209	“ Yes , but I did not know . Who is he ? ”
31322	31332	31334	31334	Leoline	140	“ Do n’t you know who the Major is ? ”
31336	31343	31334	31334	Leoline	140	“ He is our military secretary . ”

31381	31395	31397	31397	Leoline	140	“ He is not a regimental officer ; he is on our staff , ”

31427	31437	31425	31425	Rachel	128	“ and see if there is any explanation there . ”

31468	31471	31425	31425	Rachel	128	“ Leoline , ”
31476	31486	31425	31425	Rachel	128	“ can you tell me the Major ’s name ? ”
31487	31496	31454	31454	Hubert	141	“ Colonel Keith — Lieutenant - Colonel Keith , ”
31502	31512	31454	31454	Hubert	141	“ I meant his Christian name , my dear . ”

31942	31962	31965	31965	Rachel	128	“ Oh , if you would only go away , and not spoil our fun when the Major comes . ”
32320	32384	32307	32307	she	138	“ I do hope the children have been good ; I knew you would not mind ; I could not wait to see you , or I should have been too late to meet the train , and then he would have come by the coach ; and it is such a raw east wind . He must be careful in this climate . ”
32385	32396	32398	32398	Rachel	128	“ How warm and sunshiny it has been all day , ”
32412	32418	32420	32421	Colonel Keith	207	“ Sunshiny , but treacherous , ”
32423	32442	32420	32421	Colonel Keith	207	“ there are cold gusts round corners . This must be a very sheltered nook of the coast . ”
32443	32451	32453	32454	the youth	1243	“ Quite a different zone from Avoncester , ”
32456	32472	32474	32474	Fanny	127	“ Yes , delightful . I told you it was just what would suit you , ”
32480	32488	32490	32490	Rachel	128	“ Some winds are very cold here , ”
32492	32515	32490	32490	Rachel	128	“ I always pity people who are imposed upon to think it a Mentone near home . They are choking our churchyard . ”
32516	32522	32524	32526	the young man	1245	“ Very inconsiderate of them , ”
32528	32540	32542	32542	Rachel	128	“ But what made you come home so late , Fanny ? ”
32582	32636	32570	32570	Fanny	127	“ We found that the - th was at Avoncester . I had no idea of it , and they did not know I was here ; so I went to call upon Mrs. Hammond , and Colonel Keith went to look for Alick , and we have brought him home to dine . ”
32948	32978	32938	32938	Fanny	127	“ It is so natural to see you there ! One only wants poor Captain Dent at the other end . Do you know whether he has his leave ? ”
33124	33134	33117	33117	she	128	“ What conclusion have you formed upon female emigration ? ”
33135	33152	33154	33154	Alick	125	“ That ’s the most remarkable instance of female emigration on record , is n’t it ? ”
33156	33165	33167	33168	Colonel Keith	207	“ What ; her dying an old maid ? ”
33170	33185	33167	33168	Colonel Keith	207	“ I am not sure . Wholesale exportations of wives are spoiling the market . ”
33186	33193	33195	33195	Rachel	128	“ I did not mean marriage , ”
33199	33217	33195	33195	Rachel	128	“ I am particularly anxious to know whether there is a field open to independent female labour . ”
33218	33229	33231	33232	the Colonel	1244	“ All the superior young women seemed to turn nurserymaids , ”
33234	33237	33239	33239	Fanny	127	“ Oh , ”
33241	33270	33239	33239	Fanny	127	“ do you remember that nice girl of ours who would marry that Orderly - Sergeant O’Donoghoe ? I have had a letter from her in such distress . ”
33271	33279	33281	33281	Alick	125	“ Of course , the natural termination , ”
33288	33304	33306	33306	Fanny	127	“ And I thought you would tell me how to manage sending her some help , ”
33308	33324	33306	33306	Fanny	127	“ I could have helped you , Fanny . Wo n’t an order do it ? ”
33325	33329	33331	33331	Fanny	127	“ Not quite , ”
33343	33377	33331	33331	Fanny	127	“ It is whether to send it through one of the officers or not . If Captain Lee is with the regiment , I know he would take care of it for her . ”
33454	33472	33440	33440	she	127	“ Now , Alick , I do so want to hear about poor , dear little Bessie ; ”
33582	33584	33572	33573	Colonel Keith	207	“ Traveller ”
33598	33609	33572	33573	Colonel Keith	207	“ Do you know who is the writer of this ? ”
33610	33639	33572	33573	Colonel Keith	207	“ What is it ? Ah ! one of the Invalid ’s essays . They strike every one ; but I fancy the authorship is a great secret . ”
33640	33647	33572	33573	Colonel Keith	207	“ You do not know it ? ”
33648	33736	33572	33573	Colonel Keith	207	“ No , I wish I did . Which of them are you reading ? ‘ Country Walks . ’ That is not one that I care about , it is a mere hash of old recollections ; but there are some very sensible and superior ones , so that I have heard it sometimes doubted whether they are man ’s or woman ’s writing . For my part , I think them too earnest to be a man ’s ; men always play with their subject . ”
33737	33742	33744	33744	Fanny	127	“ Oh , yes , ”
33746	33797	33744	33744	Fanny	127	“ I am sure only a lady could have written anything so sweet as that about flowers in a sick - room ; it so put me in mind of the lovely flowers you used to bring me one at a time , when I was ill at Cape Town . ”
33844	33861	33833	33834	her sister	480	“ Ailie , dear , be it what it may , guessing is worse than certainty . ”
33862	33880	33833	33834	her sister	480	“ Oh , Ermine , I hoped — I know nothing — I have nothing to tell . ”
33881	33886	33888	33888	Ermine	170	“ You dread something , ”
33890	33922	33888	33888	Ermine	170	“ you have been striving for unconcern all the evening , my poor dear , but surely you know , Ailie , that nothing is so bad while we share it . ”
33923	33932	33833	33834	her sister	480	“ And I have frightened you about nothing . ”
33933	33940	33833	33834	her sister	480	“ Nothing ! nothing about Edward ? ”
33941	33948	33888	33888	Ermine	170	“ Oh , no , no ! ”
33949	33958	33833	33834	her sister	480	“ And no one has made you uncomfortable ? ”
33959	33962	33833	33834	her sister	480	“ No . ”
33963	34014	33888	33888	Ermine	170	“ Then there is only one thing that it can be , Ailie , and you need not fear to tell me that . I always knew that if he lived I must be prepared for it , and you would not have hesitated to tell me of his death . ”
34015	34049	33833	33834	her sister	480	“ It is not that , indeed it is not , Ermine , it is only this — that I found to - day that Lady Temple ’s major has the same name . ”
34050	34065	33833	33834	her sister	480	“ But you said she was come home . You must have seen him . ”
34066	34098	33888	33888	Ermine	170	“ Yes , but I should not know him . I had only seen him once , remember , twelve years ago , and when I durst not look at him . ”
34099	34103	34105	34105	Ermine	170	“ At least , ”
34109	34121	34105	34105	Ermine	170	“ you can tell me what you saw to - day . ”
34122	34136	33888	33888	Ermine	170	“ A Scotch face , bald head , dark beard , grizzled hair . ”
34137	34168	33833	33834	her sister	480	“ Yes I am grey , and he was five years older ; but he used not to have a Scotch face . Can you tell me about his eyes ? ”
34169	34172	34105	34105	Ermine	170	“ Dark , ”
34176	34215	34105	34105	Ermine	170	“ They were very dark blue , almost black . Time and climate must have left them alone . You may know him by those eyes , Ailie . And you could not make out anything about him ? ”
34216	34264	33888	33888	Ermine	170	“ No , not even his Christian name nor his regiment . I had only the little ones and Miss Rachel to ask , and they knew nothing . I wanted to keep this from you till I was sure , but you always find me out . ”
34265	34301	34105	34105	Ermine	170	“ Do you think I could n’t see the misery you were in all the evening , poor child ? But now you have had it out , sleep , and do n’t be distressed . ”
34302	34310	33888	33888	Ermine	170	“ But , Ermine , if you — ”
34311	34358	34105	34105	Ermine	170	“ My dear , I am thankful that nothing is amiss with you or Edward . For the rest , there is nothing but patience . Now , not another word ; you must not lose your sleep , nor take away my chance of any . ”
34406	34416	34417	34417	she	170	“ No , not the flowered flimsiness , please , ”
34427	34436	34417	34417	she	170	“ let me have the respectable grey silk . ”
34457	34465	34466	34466	she	170	“ I know it is very silly , ”
34469	34497	34466	34466	she	170	“ but I ca n’t quite help it . Only one question , Ailie , that I thought of too late . Did he hear your name ? ”
34498	34518	34568	34568	Ermine	170	“ I think not , Lady Temple named nobody . But why did you not ask me last night ? ”
34519	34540	34466	34466	she	170	“ I thought beginning to talk again would destroy your chance of sleep , and we had resolved to stop . ”
34541	34555	34466	34466	she	170	“ And , Ermine , if it be , what shall I do ? ”
34556	34566	34568	34568	Ermine	170	“ Do as you feel right at the moment , ”
34576	34602	34568	34568	Ermine	170	“ I can not tell how it may be . I have been thinking over what you told me about the Major and Lady Temple . ”
34603	34619	34466	34466	she	170	“ Oh , Ermine , what a reproof this is for that bit of gossip . ”
34620	34638	34640	34640	Ermine	170	“ Not at all , my dear , the warning may be all the better for me , ”
34651	34702	34640	34640	Ermine	170	“ It is not what , under the circumstances , I could think likely in the Colin whom I knew ; but were it indeed so , then , Ailie , you had better say nothing about me , unless he found you out . We would get employment elsewhere . ”
34703	34715	34648	34648	her	170	“ And I must leave you to the suspense all day . ”
34716	34752	34753	34753	Alison	180	“ Much better so . The worst thing we could do would be to go on talking about it . It is far better for me to be left with my dear little unconscious companion . ”
34895	34899	34876	34876	Keith	207	“ Miss Williams , ”
35170	35249	35167	35167	she	170	“ Oh , Colin , Colin , are you what you were twelve years back ? Is this all dream , all delusion , and waste of feeling , while you are lying in your Indian grave , more mine than you can ever be living be as it may , — — TEMPEST . Rose found the wheeled chair , to which her aunt gave the preference , was engaged , and shaking her little discreet head at “
35253	35255	35167	35167	she	170	” and “
35260	35281	35167	35167	she	170	” she turned pensively homeward , and was speeding down Mackarel Lane , when she was stayed by the words , “
35286	35301	35167	35167	she	170	” and the grandest and most bearded gentleman she had ever seen , demanded , “
35312	35313	35307	35308	Miss Williams	180	” “
35317	35332	35314	35315	My aunt	5353	” exclaimed Rose , gazing up with her pretty , frightened - fawn look . “
35335	35344	35314	35315	My aunt	5353	” he exclaimed , looking eagerly at her , “
35374	35375	35376	35376	Papa	206	” “
35380	35404	35376	35376	Papa	206	” said Rose , turning back her neck to get a full view of his face from under the brim of her hat . “
35422	35455	35415	35415	she	5246	” he added . Thus it was that Ermine heard the quick patter of the child ’s steps , followed by the manly tread , and the words sounded in her ears , “
35486	35504	35483	35483	he	5154	” Ermine ’s beaming eyes as absolutely met the new comer as though she had sprung forward . “
35511	35523	35505	35505	I	0	” she said , in a voice serene with exceeding bliss . “
35531	35566	35524	35524	I	0	” as their hands clasped ; and they gazed into each other ’s faces in the untroubled repose of the meeting , exclusive of all else . Ermine was the first to break silence . “

37004	37035	36994	36994	Little	160	” he said , stroking the child ’s head , and waiting as though her presence were a restraint on inquiries , but she eagerly availed herself of the pause . “

37995	38023	37987	37988	no one	5101	” Colonel Keith frowned and clenched the hand that lay in his grasp till it was absolute pain , but pain that was a relief to feel . “
38028	38032	37987	37988	no one	5101	” he said . “

39082	39093	39080	39080	Colin	236	” she said , with the dew in her eyes , “
39214	39289	39191	39191	I	0	” As she spoke , a knock , not at the house , but at the room door , made them both start , and impel their chairs to a more ordinary distance , just as Rachel Curtis made her entrance , extremely amazed to find , not Mr. Touchett , but a much greater foe and rival in that unexpected quarter . Ermine , the least disconcerted , was the first to speak . “
39299	39303	39295	39296	a visitor	1456	” she said , “
39334	39376	39377	39377	We	1458	” There was a ring of gladness in the usually patient voice that struck even Rachel , though she was usually too eager to be observant , but she was still unready with talk for the occasion , and Ermine continued : “
39419	39459	39415	39417	a mythic major	1464	” Rachel , never understanding playfulness , thought this both audacious and unnecessary , and if it had come from any one else , would have administered a snub , but she felt the invalid sacred from her weapons . “
39467	39472	39461	39461	you	236	” asked Colonel Keith . “
39491	39492	39483	39483	he	126	” “
39511	39512	39508	39508	they	626	” “
39522	39526	39527	39527	I	0	” said Rachel . “

39542	39547	39527	39527	I	0	” said the colonel : “
39591	39702	39574	39574	They	626	” Rachel would not encourage him to talk of Lady Temple , so she turned to Ermine on the business that had brought her , collecting and adapting old clothes for emigrants.—It was not exactly gentlemen ’s pastime , and Ermine tried to put it aside and converse , but Rachel never permitted any petty consideration to interfere with a useful design , and as there was a press of time for the things , she felt herself justified in driving the intruder off the field and outstaying him . She succeeded ; he recollected the desire of the boys that he should take them to inspect the pony at the “
39706	39710	39574	39574	They	626	” and took leave with—“I
39718	39719	39574	39574	They	626	” “
39727	39743	39720	39720	You	1471	” exclaimed Rachel , pausing in her unfolding of the Master Temples ’ ship wardrobe . “
39751	39752	39746	39746	you	1471	” “
39768	39769	39760	39760	He	1472	” “
39777	39825	39775	39775	he	1472	” demanded Rachel , as she knelt before her victim , fixing those great prominent eyes , so like those of Red Riding Hood ’s grandmother , that Ermine involuntarily gave a backward impulse to her wheeled chair , as she answered the readiest thing that occurred to her,—“He
39836	39837	39829	39834	Lord Keith of Gowan - brae	217	” “
39840	39848	39829	39834	Lord Keith of Gowan - brae	217	” said Rachel , kneeling on meditatively , “
39868	39869	39865	39866	idle honourables	1475	” “
39876	39880	39882	39882	his	1472	” replied Ermine ; “

39962	39984	39957	39957	your	1478	” said Rachel , edging forward on her knees , so as to bring her inquisitorial eyes to bear more fully . “
39994	40001	39985	39985	I	0	” said Ermine , rather faintly . “

40161	40189	40158	40159	the Newcomes	219	” said Ermine , who , besides her usual amusement in tracing Rachel ’s dicta to their source , could only keep in her indignation by laughing . “
40193	40205	40206	40206	I	0	” said Rachel , not to be turned from her purpose . “
40232	40233	40234	40234	I	0	” “
40237	40249	40234	40234	I	0	” said Ermine , bringing herself with difficulty to answer quietly , “
40274	40275	40276	40276	I	0	” “
40333	40334	40313	40313	he	1490	” “

40604	40605	40606	40606	I	0	” “
40618	40624	40608	40609	Colonel Keith	207	” suggested Ermine in despair . “
40651	40652	40645	40645	he	207	” “
40662	41107	40656	40656	he	207	” repeated Ermine , with an irresistible gleam of mirth about her lips and eyes , and at that moment Alison made her appearance . The looks of the sisters met , and read one another so far as to know that the meeting was over , and for the rest they endured , while Rachel remained , little imagining the trial her presence had been to Alison ’s burning heart — sick anxiety and doubt . How could it be well ? Let him be loveable , let him be constant , that only rendered Ermine ’s condition the more pitiable , and the shining glance of her eyes was almost more than Alison could bear . So happy as the sisters had been together , so absolutely united , it did seem hard to disturb that calm life with hopes and agitations that must needs be futile ; and Alison , whose whole life and soul were in her sister , could not without a pang see that sister ’s heart belonging to another , and not for hopeful joy , but pain and grief . The yearning of jealousy was sternly reproved and forced down , and told that Ermine had long been Colin Keith ’s , that the perpetrator of the evil had the least right of any one to murmur that her own monopoly of her sister was interfered with ; that she was selfish , unkind , envious ; that she had only to hate herself and pray for strength to bear the punishment , without alloying Ermine ’s happiness while it lasted . How it could be so bright Alison knew not , but so it was she recognised by every tone of the voice , by every smile on the lip , by even the upright vigour with which Ermine sat in her chair and undertook Rachel ’s tasks of needlework . And yet , when the visitor rose at last to go , Alison was almost unwilling to be alone with her sister , and have that power of sympathy put to the test by those clear eyes that were wo nt to see her through and through . She went with Rachel to the door , and stood taking a last instruction , hearing it not at all , but answering , and relieved by the delay , hardly knowing whether to be glad or not that when she returned Rose was leaning on the arm of her aunt ’s chair with the most eager face . But Rose was to be no protection , for what was passing between her and her aunt ? “
41156	41212	41143	41144	any gentleman	1508	” Alison had no difficulty in smiling as Ermine stroked the child ’s hair , kissed her , and looked up with an arch , blushing , glittering face that could not have been brighter those long twelve years ago . And then Rose turned round , impatient to tell her other aunt her story . “
41283	41284	41285	41285	You	185	” “
41291	41301	41288	41288	you	185	” said Ermine , laughing , and blushing again . “
41340	41341	41329	41329	I	0	” “
41354	41358	41345	41345	you	185	” observed Rose . “
41369	41382	41359	41359	I	0	” said Alison , smiling being happily made very easy to her . “
41393	41394	41388	41388	you	181	” “
41440	41441	41427	41427	Ailie	220	” “
41448	41452	41443	41443	he	1506	” said Alison . “
41510	41511	41512	41512	I	0	” “
41522	41523	41524	41524	I	0	” “
41601	41602	41603	41603	I	0	” “
41611	41625	41609	41609	you	181	” said Alison , scarcely able to keep the tears from her eyes . “
41699	41789	41790	41790	Colin	236	” Ermine lent back with clasped hands . She was like one weary with happiness , and lain to rest in the sense of newly - won peace . She said little more that evening , and if spoken to , seemed like one wakened out of a dream , so that more than once she laughed at herself , begged her sister ’s pardon , and said that it seemed to her that she could not hear anything for the one glad voice that rang in her ear , “
41795	41921	41922	41922	I	0	” That was sufficient for her , no need for any other sympathy , felt Alison , with another of those pangs crushed down . Then wonder came — whether Ermine could really contemplate the future , or if it were absolutely lost in the present ? Colonel Keith went back to be seized by Conrade and Francis , and walked off to the pony inspection , the two boys , on either side of him , communicating to him the great grievance of living in a poky place like this , where nobody had ever been in the army , nor had a bit of sense , and Aunt Rachel was always bothering , and trying to make mamma think that Con told stories . “
41928	41934	41922	41922	I	0	” said Conrade , stoutly ; “
41939	41940	41944	41944	she	1523	” “
41952	41956	41944	41944	she	1523	” added Francis . “
41964	41968	41960	41960	mamma	162	” said Conrade , “
42031	42032	42033	42033	My	0	” “
42036	42049	42033	42033	My	0	” said the Colonel , who had been giving only half attention ; “
42101	42102	42103	42103	I	0	” “
42110	42114	42132	42132	her	128	” sighed Conrade ; “
42136	42235	42236	42237	Dear papa	1533	” Questions that the Colonel was glad to turn aside by moans of the ponies , and by a suggestion that , if a very quiet one were found , and if Conrade would be very careful , mamma might , perhaps , go out riding with them . The motion was so transcendant that , no sooner had the ponies been seen , than the boys raced home , and had communicated it at the top of their voices to mamma long before their friend made his appearance . Lady Temple was quite startled at the idea . “
42239	42247	42236	42237	Dear papa	1533	” as she always called her husband , “
42264	42272	42255	42255	she	128	” The tears came into her eyes . “
42278	42285	42273	42273	I	0	” said the Colonel , gently ; “
42308	42322	42299	42299	Conrade	126	” he added , as the boys had rushed out of the room . “
42353	42354	42347	42347	you	1534	” “
42362	42363	42347	42347	you	1534	” “
42369	42376	42366	42366	you	0	” said Fanny looking up surprised ; “
42413	42414	42415	42415	You	0	” “
42421	42430	42415	42415	You	0	” he said , sitting down by her ; “
42447	42448	42435	42435	I	0	” “
42469	42470	42466	42466	I	0	” “
42482	42502	42506	42506	her	180	” He paused , and added slowly , as if merely for the sake of dwelling on the words , “
42508	42509	42506	42506	her	180	” “
42513	42521	42510	42511	Miss Williams	180	” said Fanny , with perplexed looks . “
42545	42546	42547	42548	That sister	5672	” “
42565	42576	42547	42548	That sister	5672	” cried the much confused Fanny , in a breath ; “
42584	42585	42579	42579	you	0	” “
42600	42604	42586	42586	I	0	” he said . “

42672	42676	42658	42658	them,—I	0	” repeated Fanny ; “
42686	42687	42658	42658	them,—I	0	” “

42901	42929	42930	42930	I	0	” And there was a pause , both much affected by the thought of the good old man ’s ever ready consideration . At last Fanny said , “
42947	42951	42953	42953	you	1553	” she added , “
42966	42967	42957	42957	you	1553	” “
43003	43004	43010	43010	you	1553	” “

43167	43168	43156	43156	I	0	” “
43179	43190	43156	43156	I	0	” said Fanny ; then with a start of dismay , “
43247	43248	43242	43242	you	1565	” “
43270	43271	43252	43252	Alison	180	” “
43274	43291	43252	43252	Alison	180	” cried Lady Temple , with an odd sound of satisfaction , doubt , and surprise , “
43301	43302	43295	43295	you	1565	” “
43344	43345	43339	43339	Alison	180	” “
43350	43351	43347	43348	your brother	1570	” “
43375	43381	43368	43368	he	1570	” said the Colonel sternly . “
43408	43409	43419	43419	She	128	” “
43444	43445	43450	43450	you	1565	” “
43474	43475	43467	43467	I	0	” “
43484	43499	43479	43479	I	0	” she said , with sweet earnestness , holding out her hand in congratulation . “
43524	43525	43519	43519	you	1565	” “
43549	43550	43537	43537	you	1565	” “
43591	43592	43593	43593	She	186	” “
43601	43614	43593	43593	She	186	” said the Colonel , smiling , and looking at his watch . “
43694	43695	43681	43681	I	0	” “
43724	43725	43729	43729	she	204	” “
43786	43787	43774	43774	I	0	” “
43795	43802	43788	43788	I	0	” said Colonel Keith , smiling , “
43813	43814	43815	43815	Rachel	128	” “
43823	43827	43829	43829	she	128	” said Fanny , “
43883	43884	43873	43873	They	1586	” “
43887	43888	43873	43873	They	1586	” “
43900	43904	43891	43891	you	0	” colouring up , “
43924	43925	43917	43917	you	0	” “
43938	43944	43926	43926	I	0	” he said , smiling , “
43961	43962	43949	43949	I	0	” “
43970	43974	43964	43964	you	0	” she said . “
44026	44027	44028	44028	Ermine	186	” “
44047	44074	44028	44028	Ermine	186	” added Colonel Keith , and both moved away with the startled precision of members of a punctual military household , still feeling themselves accountable to somebody .
44215	44219	44214	44214	her	180	“ Very well , ”
44221	44231	44214	44214	her	180	“ not at all the worse for the excitement , ”
44244	44246	44248	44248	Ermine	186	“ well ”
44432	44472	44425	44426	a creature	1602	“ to whom the notion of noise at play was something strange and ridiculous ; necessity has reduced her to Jacqueline Pascal ’s system with her pensionnaires , who were allowed to play one by one without any noise . ”
44473	44482	44484	44484	Rose	186	“ But I do n’t play all alone , ”
44486	44499	44484	44484	Rose	186	“ I play with you , Aunt Ermine , and with Violetta . ”
44572	44604	44564	44564	he	207	“ Well , Miss Violetta , and Miss Rose , when you come to live with me , I shall hope for the pleasure of teaching you to make a noise . ”
44605	44611	44613	44613	Rose	186	“ What does he mean ? ”
44622	44632	44634	44634	Ermine	170	“ I am afraid he does not quite know , ”
44638	44643	44645	44645	he	207	“ Nay , Ermine , ”
44657	44707	44708	44708	he	207	“ you are the last who should say that . Have I not told you that there is nothing now in our way — no one with a right to object , and means enough for all we should wish , including her — ? What is the matter ? ”
44716	44726	44708	44708	he	207	“ Ah , Colin ! I thought you knew — ”
44727	44733	44735	44735	his	207	“ Knew what , Ermine ? ”
44740	44747	44748	44748	she	975	“ Knew — what I am , ”
44751	44778	44748	44748	she	975	“ knew the impossibility . What , they have not told you ? I thought I was the invalid , the cripple , with every one . ”
44779	44793	44794	44794	he	207	“ I knew you had suffered cruelly ; I knew you were lame , ”
44799	44804	44794	44794	he	207	“ but — what — ”
44805	44812	44813	44813	she	975	“ It is more than lame , ”
44816	44864	44865	44865	she	975	“ I should be better off if the fiction of the Queens of Spain were truth with me . I could not move from this chair without help . Oh , Colin ! poor Colin ! it was very cruel not to have prepared you for this ! ”
44892	44900	44901	44901	she	975	“ Yes , indeed it is so , ”
44904	44939	44901	44901	she	975	“ the explosion , rather than the fire , did mischief below the knee that poor nature could not repair , and I can but just stand , and can not walk at all . ”
44940	44948	44949	44949	he	207	“ Has anything been done — advice ? ”
44952	45013	45014	45014	she	975	“ Advice upon advice , so that I felt at the last almost a compensation to be out of the way of the doctors . No , nothing more can be done ; and now that one is used to it , the snail is very comfortable in its shell . But I wish you could have known it sooner ! ”
45028	45035	45036	45036	he	207	“ What you must have suffered ! ”
45039	45072	45036	45036	he	207	“ That is all over long ago ; every year has left that further behind , and made me more content . Dear Colin , for me there is nothing to grieve . ”
45097	45107	45109	45109	Ermine	170	“ Oh , if I could only follow him , ”
45118	45127	45129	45129	Rose	186	“ Is it because you ca n’t walk ? ”
45155	45164	45166	45166	Ermine	170	“ Oh ! this was what I feared ! ”
45168	45180	45166	45166	Ermine	170	“ Oh , give us strength to go through with it . ”
45188	45199	45185	45186	the child	975	presence—“A little water , if you please , my dear . ”
45205	45230	45185	45186	the child	975	“ Do n’t be frightened , my Rose ; you did not know it was such a shock to find me so laid by — ”
45231	45242	45244	45244	Rose	186	“ He is in the garden walking up and down , ”
45246	45263	45244	45244	Rose	186	“ May I go and tell him how much merrier you always are than Aunt Ailie ? ”
45329	45339	45340	45340	she	1612	eyes—“Please , please do n’t be so very sorry , ”
45343	45358	45340	45340	she	1612	“ Aunt Ermine does not like it . She never is sorry for herself — ”
45359	45368	45369	45369	he	207	“ Have I shaken her — distressed her ? ”
45374	45384	45386	45386	Rose	186	“ She does n’t like you to be sorry , ”
45391	45423	45386	45386	Rose	186	“ And , indeed , she does not mind it ; she is such a merry aunt ! Please , come in again , and see how happy we always are — ”
45441	45469	45434	45434	Ermine	170	“ Yes , come in , Colin , and learn not to grieve for me , or you will make me repent of my selfish gladness yesterday . ”
45470	45474	45475	45475	he	207	“ Not grieve ! ”
45478	45497	45499	45499	he	207	“ when I think of the beautiful vigorous being that used to be the life of the place — ”
45513	45516	45517	45517	she	170	“ Well , ”
45523	45761	45517	45517	she	170	“ it is a pity to think even of a crushed butterfly ; but indeed , Colin , if you can bear to listen to me , I think I can show you that it all has been a blessing even by sight , as well as , of course , by faith . Only remember the unsatisfactoriness of our condition — the never seeing or hearing from one another after that day when Mr. Beauchamp came down on us . Did not the accident win for us a parting that was much better to remember than that state of things ? Oh , the pining , weary feel as if all the world had closed on me ! I do assure you it was much worse than anything that came after the burn . Yes , if I had been well and doing like others , I know I should have fretted and wearied , pined myself ill perhaps , whereas I could always tell myself that every year of your absence might be a step towards your finding me well ; and when I was forced to give up that hope for myself , why then , Colin , the never seeing your name made me think you would never be disappointed and grieved as you are now . It is very merciful the way that physical trials help one through those of the mind . ”
45762	45767	45769	45770	the Colonel	1244	“ I never knew , ”
45772	45787	45769	45770	the Colonel	1244	“ all my aunt ’s latter letters spoke of your slow improvement beyond hope . ”
45788	45833	45517	45517	she	170	“ True , in her time , I had not reached the point where I stopped . The last time I saw her I was still upstairs ; and , indeed , I did not half know what I could do till I tried . ”
45834	45837	45839	45839	he	1244	“ Yes , ”
45852	45875	45839	45839	he	1244	“ and you will yet do more , Ermine . You have convinced me that we shall be all the happier together — ”
45876	45889	45890	45890	she	1614	“ But that was not what I meant to convince you of — ”
45895	45956	45890	45890	she	1614	“ Not what you meant , perhaps ; but what it did convince me was , that you — as you are , my Ermine — are ten thousand times more to me than even as the beautiful girl , and that there never can be a happier pair than we shall be when I am your hands and feet . ”
45978	46003	46004	46004	He	1615	“ Dear Colin , it can not be ! I trusted you were understanding that when I told you how it was with me . ”
46011	46014	46015	46015	she	170	“ No , ”
46018	46073	46015	46015	she	170	“ it would be wrong in me to think of it for an instant . That you should have done so , shows — O Colin , I can not talk of it ; but it would be as ungenerous in me to consent , as it is noble of you to propose it . ”
46074	46081	46082	46082	he	1615	“ It is no such thing , ”
46085	46108	46082	46082	he	1615	“ it has been the one object and thought of my life , the only hope I have had all these years . ”
46109	46113	46114	46114	she	170	“ Exactly so , ”
46123	46160	46114	46114	she	170	“ and that is the very thing . You kept your allegiance to the bright , tall , walking , active girl , and it would be a shame in the scorched cripple to claim it . ”
46161	46181	46082	46082	he	1615	“ Do n’t call yourself names . Have I not told you that you are more than the same ? ”
46182	46216	46114	46114	she	170	“ You do not know . You are pleased because my face is not burnt , nor grown much older , and because I can talk and laugh in the same voice still . ”
46225	46281	46114	46114	she	170	“ But it would be a wicked mockery in me to pretend to be the wife you want . Yes , I know you think you do , but that is just because my looks are so deceitful , and you have kept on thinking about me ; but you must make a fresh beginning . ”
46282	46289	46290	46290	he	1616	“ You can tell me that , ”
46295	46304	46305	46305	she	1617	“ Because it is not new to me , ”
46308	46350	46305	46305	she	1617	“ the quarter of an hour you stood by me , with that deadly calm in your white face , was the real farewell to the young hopeful dream of that bright summer . I wish it was as calm now . ”
46351	46358	46360	46360	he	1616	“ I believed you dying then , ”
46362	46380	46381	46381	she	1617	“ Do not make me think it would have been better for you if I had been , ”
46386	46427	46381	46381	she	1617	“ It was as much the end , and I knew it from the time my recovery stopped short . I would have let you know if I could , and then you would not have been so much shocked . ”
46428	46439	46305	46305	she	1617	“ So as to cut me off from you entirely ? ”
46440	46486	46488	46488	her	1617	“ No , indeed . The thought of seeing you again was too — too overwhelming to be indulged in ; knowing , as I did , that if you were the same to me , it must be at this sad cost to you , ”
46494	46505	46488	46488	her	1617	“ It is you who make it so , Ermine . ”
46506	46589	46590	46590	she	1617	“ No ; it is the providence that has set me aside from the active work of life . Pray do not go on , Colin , it is only giving us both useless pain . You do not know what it costs me to deny you , and I feel that I must . I know you are only acting on the impulse of generosity . Yes , I will say so , though you think it is to please yourself , ”
46619	46629	46630	46630	he	1618	“ I will make you think so in time , ”
46633	46648	46649	46649	she	1617	“ Then I might tell you , you had no right to please yourself , ”
46660	46711	46649	46649	she	1617	“ you have got a brother , you know — and — yes , I hear you growl ; but if he is a poor old broken man out of health , it is the more reason you should not vex him , nor hamper yourself with a helpless commodity . ”
46712	46731	46649	46649	she	1617	“ You are not taking the way to make me forget what my brother has done for us . ”
46732	46814	46815	46815	He	1619	“ How do you know that he did not save me from being a strong - minded military lady ! After all , it was absurd to expect people to look favourably on our liking for one another , and you know they could not be expected to know that there was real stuff in the affair . If there had not been , we should have thought so all the same , you know , and been quite as furious . ”
46853	46856	46857	46857	he	1619	“ Still , ”
46861	46868	46857	46857	he	1619	“ I think there was harshness . ”
46869	46905	46940	46940	Ermine	170	“ So do I , but not so much as I thought at that time , and — oh , surely that is not Rachel Curtis ? I told her I thought you would call . ”
46906	46909	46910	46910	he	1619	“ Intolerable ! ”
46916	46925	46910	46910	he	1619	“ Is she always coming to bore you ? ”
46926	46938	46940	46940	Ermine	170	“ She has been very kind , and my great enlivenment , ”
46942	46975	46940	46940	Ermine	170	“ and she ca n’t be expected to know how little we want her . Oh , there , the danger is averted ! She must have asked if you were here . ”
46976	46999	46910	46910	he	1619	“ I was just thinking that she was the chief objection to Lady Temple ’s kind wish of having you at Myrtlewood . ”
47000	47006	47008	47008	Ermine	170	“ Does Lady Temple know ? ”
47012	47046	47008	47008	Ermine	170	“ I could not keep it from one who has been so uniformly kind to me ; but I desired her not to let it go further till I should hear your wishes . ”
47047	47057	47059	47059	Ermine	170	“ Yes , she has a right to know , ”
47061	47070	47008	47008	Ermine	170	“ but please , not a word elsewhere . ”
47071	47082	46910	46910	he	1619	“ And will you not come to stay with her ? ”
47083	47125	46910	46910	he	1619	“ I ? Oh , no ; I am fit for no place but this . You do n’t half know how bad I am . When you have seen a little more of us , you will be quite convinced . ”
47126	47140	47008	47008	Ermine	170	“ Well , at least , you give me leave to come here . ”
47141	47204	46910	46910	he	1619	“ Leave ? When it is a greater pleasure than I ever thought to have again ; that is , while you understand that you said good - bye to the Ermine of Beauchamp Parsonage twelve years ago , and that the thing here is only a sort of ghost , most glad and grateful to be a friend — a sister . ”
47205	47208	47209	47209	he	1621	“ So , ”
47212	47223	47209	47209	he	1621	“ those are to be the terms of my admission . ”
47224	47230	46910	46910	he	1619	“ The only possible ones . ”
47231	47243	46910	46910	he	1619	“ I will consider them . I have not accepted them . ”
47244	47248	47249	47249	she	1621	“ You will , ”
47298	47302	47253	47253	she	1621	“ Human Reeds , ”
47311	47314	47253	47253	she	1621	“ Military Society ”
47321	47323	47253	47253	she	1621	“ Curatocult ”
47454	47460	47461	47461	she	128	“ Six officers ’ cards ! ”
47464	47471	47473	47473	Grace	127	“ No , only six cards , ”
47475	47482	47473	47473	Grace	127	“ there are two of each . ”
47483	47488	47490	47490	Rachel	128	“ That ’s enough , ”
47492	47497	47490	47490	Rachel	128	“ and look there , ”
47505	47524	47490	47490	Rachel	128	“ She is walking with the young puppy that dined here on Thursday , and they called Alick . ”
47525	47530	47532	47532	Grace	127	“ Do you remember , ”
47534	47571	47532	47532	Grace	127	“ how she used to chatter about Alick , when she first came to us , at six years old . He was the child of one of the officers . Can this be the same ? ”
47572	47614	47617	47617	Grace	127	“ That ’s one of your ideas , Grace . Look , this youth could have been hardly born when Fanny came to us . No ; he is only one of the idlers that military life has accustomed her to . ”
47651	47662	47617	47617	Grace	127	“ Then you will give me dear Bessie ’s direction ? ”
47663	47674	47621	47621	Rachel	128	“ Thank you , it will be the greatest kindness — ”
47675	47686	47688	47688	Fanny	127	“ Oh , Grace , Rachel , is it you ? ”
47690	47706	47688	47688	Fanny	127	“ You have not met before , I think . Mr. Keith — Miss Curtis . ”
48003	48041	47990	47990	Grace	127	“ The boys have gone to their favourite cove under the plantation . They have a fort there , and Hubert told me he was to be a hero , and Miss Williams a she - ro . ”
48042	48052	48054	48054	Rachel	128	“ I would not encourage that description of sport , ”
48071	48078	48080	48080	Fanny	127	“ They like it so much , ”
48082	48099	48080	48080	Fanny	127	“ and they learn so much now that they act all the battles they read about . ”
48100	48108	48110	48110	Rachel	128	“ That is what I object to , ”
48112	48123	48110	48110	Rachel	128	“ it is accustoming them to confound heroism with pugnacity . ”
48124	48151	48153	48153	Fanny	127	“ No , but Rachel dear , they do quarrel and fight among themselves much less now that this is all in play and good humour , ”
48155	48180	48153	48153	Fanny	127	“ Yes , that may be , but you are cultivating the dangerous instinct , although for a moment giving it a better direction . ”
48181	48195	48197	48197	Fanny	127	“ Dangerous ? Oh , Alick ! do you think it can be ? ”
48209	48216	48217	48217	he	1638	“ According to the Peace Society , ”
48228	48235	48217	48217	he	1638	“ perhaps you belong to it ? ”
48236	48241	48243	48243	Rachel	128	“ No , indeed , ”
48248	48286	48243	48243	Rachel	128	“ I think war the great purifier and ennobler of nations , when it is for a good and great cause ; but I think education ought to protest against confounding mere love of combat with heroism . ”
48287	48297	48298	48298	he	1638	“ Query , the true meaning of the word ? ”
48304	48317	48320	48320	Rachel	128	“ Heros , yes from the same root as the German herr , ”
48322	48351	48320	48320	Rachel	128	“ meaning no more than lord and master ; but there can be no doubt that the progress of ideas has linked with it a much nobler association . ”
48352	48364	48243	48243	Rachel	128	“ Progress ! What , since the heroes were half divine ! ”
48365	48411	48320	48320	Rachel	128	“ Half divine in the esteem of a people who thought brute courage godlike . To us the word maintains its semi - divinity , and it should be our effort to associate it only with that which veritably has the god - like stamp . ”
48412	48418	48243	48243	Rachel	128	“ And that is — ? ”
48419	48427	48429	48429	Rachel	128	“ Doing more than one ’s duty , ”
48436	48448	48449	48449	he	1638	“ Very uncomfortable and superfluous , and not at all easy , ”
48459	48472	48449	48449	he	1638	“ Easy , no , that ’s the beauty and the glory — ”
48473	48487	48489	48489	Coombe	135	“ Major Sherborne and Captain Lester in the drawing room , my lady , ”
48501	48510	48512	48512	Fanny	127	“ You will come with me , Grace , ”
48516	48539	48512	48512	Fanny	127	“ I dare say you had rather not , Rachel , and it would be a pity to disturb you , Alick . ”
48540	48553	48449	48449	he	1638	“ Thank you ; it would be decidedly more than my duty . ”
48554	48567	48569	48569	Fanny	127	“ I am quite sorry to go , you are so amusing , ”
48571	48601	48569	48569	Fanny	127	“ but I suppose you will have settled about heroism by the time we come out again , and will tell me what the boys ought to play at . ”
48687	48739	48684	48684	she	128	“ No words have been more basely misused than hero and heroine . The one is the mere fighting animal whose strength or fortune have borne him through some more than ordinary danger , the other is only the subject of an adventure , perfectly irrespective of her conduct in it . ”
48740	48747	48748	48748	he	1640	“ Bathos attends all high words , ”
48772	48855	48748	48748	he	1640	“ This is not their natural bathos but their misuse . They ought to be reserved for those who in any department have passed the limits to which the necessity of their position constrained them , and done acts of self - devotion for the good of others . I will give you an instance , and from your own profession , that you may see I am not prejudiced , besides , the hero of it is past praise or blame . ”
48870	48986	48866	48866	she	128	“ It was in the course of the siege of Delhi , a shell came into a tent where some sick and wounded were lying . There was one young officer among them who could move enough to have had a chance of escaping the explosion , but instead of that he took the shell up , its fuse burning as it was , and ran with it out of the tent , then hurled it to a distance . It exploded , and of course was his death , but the rest were saved , and I call that a deed of heroism far greater than mounting a breach or leading a forlorn hope . ”
48987	48993	48995	48996	Mr. Keith	229	“ Killed , you say ? ”
49005	49023	48995	48996	Mr. Keith	229	“ Oh yes , mortally wounded : carried back to die among the men he had saved . ”
49024	49031	49033	49035	this provoking individual	1643	“ Jessie Cameron singing his dirge , ”
49060	49081	49056	49056	her	128	“ You do not mean to undervalue an action like that in comparison with mere animal pugnacity in an advance . ”
49082	49092	49093	49093	he	229	“ More than one ’s duty was your test , ”
49096	49125	49126	49126	He	229	“ And was not this more than duty ? Ah ! I see yours is a spirit of depreciation , and I can only say I pity you . ”
49413	49419	49420	49420	she	235	“ Yes , my dear , ”
49425	49446	49420	49420	she	235	“ I must get it over before church , or it will make me so nervous all through the service . ”
49615	49618	49620	49620	Fanny	127	“ Oh ! ”
49629	49638	49620	49620	Fanny	127	“ he is not going to Ireland now . ”
49639	49649	49620	49620	Fanny	127	“ Indeed ! I quite understood he intended it . ”
49650	49653	49655	49655	Fanny	127	“ Yes , ”
49657	49666	49655	49655	Fanny	127	“ but he found that he need not . ”
49667	49670	49673	49676	poor perplexed Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Indeed ! ”
49678	49691	49673	49676	poor perplexed Mrs. Curtis	235	“ but then , at least , he is going away soon . ”
49692	49725	49620	49620	Fanny	127	“ He must go to Scotland by - and - by , but for the present he is going into lodgings . Do you know of any nice ones , dear aunt ? ”
49726	49755	49673	49676	poor perplexed Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Well , I suppose you ca n’t help that ; you know , my dear , it would never do for him to stay in this house . ”
49756	49763	49765	49765	Fanny	127	“ I never thought of that , ”
49776	49826	49827	49827	Fanny	127	“ No , my dear , but you see you are very young and inexperienced . I do not say you have done anything the least amiss , or that you ever would mean it , only you will forgive your old aunt for putting you on your guard . ”
49847	49877	49843	49843	her	127	her—“It was he that thought of getting a lodging . I am glad I did not persuade him not ; but you know he always did live with us . ”
49878	49945	49827	49827	Fanny	127	“ With us . Yes , my poor dear , that is the difference , and you see he feels it . But , indeed , my dear child , though he is a very good man , I dare say , and quite a gentleman all but his beard , you had better not encourage — You know people are so apt to make remarks . ”
49946	49952	49954	49954	Fanny	127	“ I have no fear , ”
49972	50011	49954	49954	Fanny	127	“ Ah ! my dear , you do n’t guess how ready people are to talk ; and you would not like — for your children ’s sake , for your husband ’s sake — that — that — ”
50012	50018	50020	50020	Fanny	127	“ Pray , pray aunt , ”
50025	50068	49954	49954	Fanny	127	“ indeed you do n’t know . My husband had confidence in him more than in any one . He told him to take care of me and look after the boys . I could n’t hold aloof from him without transgressing those wishes”—and
50077	50100	50102	50104	poor Mrs. Curtis	235	“ My dear , indeed I did not mean to distress you . You know , I dare say — I mean — ”
50106	50145	50102	50104	poor Mrs. Curtis	235	“ I know you must see a great deal of him . I only want you to take care — appearances are appearances , and if it was said you had all these young officers always coming about — ”
50146	50183	50185	50185	Fanny	127	“ I do n’t think they will come . It was only just to call , and they have known me so long . It is all out of respect to my father and Sir Stephen , ”
50191	50233	50185	50185	Fanny	127	“ Indeed , I would not for the world do anything you did not like , dear aunt ; but there ca n’t be any objection to my having Mrs. Hammond and the children to spend the day to - morrow . ”
50277	50293	50265	50265	she	235	“ This young man , my dear , he seems to make himself very intimate . ”
50294	50301	50303	50303	Fanny	127	“ Alick Keith ? Oh aunt ! ”
50313	50417	50303	50303	Fanny	127	“ do n’t you know about him ? His father and mother were our greatest friends always ; I used to play with him every day till I came to you . And then just as I married , poor Mrs. Keith died , and we had dear little Bessie with us till her father could send her home . And when poor Alick was so dreadfully wounded before Delhi , Sir Stephen sent him up in a litter to the hills for mamma and me to nurse . Mamma was so fond of him , she used to call him her son . ”
50418	50446	50265	50265	she	235	“ Yes , my dear , I dare say you have been very intimate ; but you see you are very young ; and his staying here — ”
50447	50471	50473	50473	Fanny	127	“ I thought he would be so glad to come and be with the Colonel , who was his guardian and Bessie ’s , ”
50475	50496	50473	50473	Fanny	127	“ and I have promised to have Bessie to stay with me , she was such a dear little thing — ”
50497	50573	50265	50265	she	235	“ Well , my dear , it may be a good thing for you to have a young lady with you , and if he is to come over , her presence will explain it . Understand me , my dear , I am not at all afraid of your — your doing anything foolish , only to get talked of is so dreadful in your situation , that you ca n’t be too careful . ”
50574	50585	50587	50591	the drooping and subdued Fanny	1668	“ Yes , yes , thank you , dear aunt , ”
50622	50659	50660	50660	Her	1668	“ Please , dear aunt , help me , for indeed I do n’t know how to manage — tell me how to be civil and kind to my dear husband ’s friends without — without — ”
50742	50822	50823	50823	Rachel	128	“ Well , well , my dear child , we all know you wish to do right ; you can judge best . I would not have you ungrateful or uncivil , only you know you are living very quietly , and intimacy — oh ! my dear , I know your own feeling will direct you . Dear child ! you have taken what I said so kindly . And now let me see that dear little girl . ”
50915	50947	50896	50896	she	138	“ May I come in ? Your sister and your little niece are gone for a walk . I told them I would come ! I did want to see you ! ”
50948	50952	50954	50954	Ermine	170	“ Thank you , ”
50986	50994	51002	51002	her	138	“ Yes , you must let me , ”
51007	51026	51002	51002	her	138	“ you know I have known him so long , and he has been so good to me ! ”
51027	51036	51038	51038	Ermine	170	“ Indeed it is very kind in you , ”
51060	51123	51038	51038	Ermine	170	“ Oh , no , I could not help it . I am only so sorry we kept him away from you when you wanted him so much ; but we did not know , and he was Sir Stephen ’s right hand , and we none of us knew what to do without him ; but if he had only told — ”
51124	51133	51135	51135	Ermine	170	“ Thank you , oh , thank you ! ”
51137	51149	51135	51135	Ermine	170	“ but indeed it was better for him to be away . ”
51175	51196	51162	51162	her	170	“ It has been such a pleasure to hear he had so kind and happy a home all these years . ”
51197	51245	51293	51295	a different being	1677	“ Oh , you can not think how Sir Stephen loved and valued him . The one thing I always did wish was , that Conrade should grow up to be as much help and comfort to his father , and now he never can ! But , ”
51251	51285	51287	51287	she	170	“ it was so hard that you should not have known how distinguished and useful and good he was all those years . Only now I shall have the pleasure of telling you , ”
51319	51328	51330	51330	Ermine	170	“ It will be a pleasure of pleasures , ”
51334	51348	51350	51351	Lady Temple	138	“ Then you will do me a favour , a very great favour , ”
51360	51375	51350	51351	Lady Temple	138	“ if you and your sister and niece will come and stay with me . ”
51462	51472	51473	51473	she	170	“ You see I am terribly young , really , ”
51476	51529	51473	51473	she	170	“ though I have so many boys , and my aunt thinks it awkward for me to have so many officers calling , and I ca n’t keep them away because they are my father ’s and Sir Stephen ’s old friends ; so please do come and make it all right ! ”
51558	51563	51564	51564	she	170	“ I ought not , ”
51567	51605	51564	51564	she	170	“ it is not good for him , so you must not press me , dear Lady Temple . You see it is best for him that nobody should ever know of what has been between us . ”
51606	51615	51617	51617	Fanny	127	“ What ! do n’t you mean — ? ”
51623	51628	51630	51630	Ermine	170	“ I can not ! ”
51632	51647	51630	51630	Ermine	170	“ But he would like it . He wishes it as much as ever . ”
51648	51654	51656	51656	Ermine	170	“ I know he does , ”
51663	51694	51656	51656	Ermine	170	“ but you see that is because he did not know what a wretched remnant I am , and he never has had time to think about any one else . ”
51695	51701	51630	51630	Ermine	170	“ Oh no , no . ”
51702	51727	51630	51630	Ermine	170	“ And it would be very unfair of me to take advantage of that , and give him such a thing as I am . ”
51728	51738	51740	51740	Fanny	127	“ Oh dear , but that is very sad ! ”
51746	51759	51740	51740	Fanny	127	“ But I am sure you must see that it is right . ”
51760	51766	51630	51630	Ermine	170	“ It may be right , ”
51775	51825	51630	51630	Ermine	170	“ but it is very , very hard and disagreeable , if you do n’t mind my saying so , when I know it is so good of you . And do n’t you mean to let him even see you , when he has been constant so long ? ”
51826	51862	51630	51630	Ermine	170	“ No ; I see no reason for denying myself that ; indeed I believe it is better for him to grow used to me as I am , and be convinced of the impossibility . ”
51863	51875	51630	51630	Ermine	170	“ Well then , why will you not come to me ? ”
51876	51931	51630	51630	Ermine	170	“ Do you not see , in all your kindness , that my coming to you would make every one know the terms between us , while no one remarks his just coming to me here as an old friend ? And if he were ever to turn his mind to any one else — ”
51932	51943	51630	51630	Ermine	170	“ He will never do that , I am sure . ”
51944	51964	51966	51966	Ermine	170	“ There is no knowing . He has never been , in his own estimation , disengaged from me , ”
51968	52004	51966	51966	Ermine	170	“ his brother is bent on his marrying , and he ought to be perfectly free to do so , and not under the disadvantage that any report of this affair would be to him . ”
52005	52015	52017	52017	Fanny	127	“ Well , I am sure he never will , ”
52022	52034	52017	52017	Fanny	127	“ I know I shall hate her , that ’s all . ”
52056	52100	52053	52053	she	170	“ At any rate you will be so very kind as not to let any one know of it . I am glad you do . I should not feel it right that you should not , but it is different with others . ”
52101	52199	52053	52053	she	170	“ Thank you . And if you will not come to me , you will let me come to you , wo n’t you ? It will be so nice to come and talk him over with you . Perhaps I shall persuade you some of these days after all . Only I must go now , for I always give the children their tea on Sunday . But please let your dear little niece come up to - morrow and play with them ; the little Hammonds will be there , she is just their age . ”
52313	52317	52319	52319	Ermine	170	“ Pretty creature ! ”
52323	52354	52319	52319	Ermine	170	“ really if it did come to that , I could spare him to her better than to any one else . She has some notion how to value him . ”
52729	52740	52741	52741	he	207	“ Did she think his visits bad for her sister ? ”
52754	52760	52761	52761	she	180	“ No , certainly not , ”
52776	52781	52782	52782	she	180	“ My only fear , ”
52786	52827	52782	52782	she	180	“ is , that if this is pressed much on her , and she has to struggle with you and herself too , it may hurt her health . Trouble tells not on her cheerfulness , but on her nerves . ”
52828	52832	52833	52833	he	207	“ Thank you , ”
52836	52841	52833	52833	he	207	“ I will refrain . ”
52967	52975	52976	52976	her	180	“ I have been walking with Colin , ”
52983	52990	52976	52976	her	180	“ And learning to know him . ”
52991	53000	52956	52957	the other	5166	“ Learning to sympathize with him , Ermine , ”
53007	53014	52976	52976	her	180	“ You are hard on him . ”
53015	53020	53022	53022	Ermine	170	“ Now , Ailie , ”
53024	53191	53022	53022	Ermine	170	“ once for all , he is not to set you on me , as he has done with Lady Temple . The more he persuades me , the better I know that to listen would be an abuse of his constancy . It would set him wrong with his brother , and , as dear Edward ’s affairs stand , we have no right to carry the supposed disgrace into a family that would believe it , though he does not . If I were ever so well , I should not think it right to marry . I shall not shun the sight of him ; it is delightful to me , and a less painful cure to him than sending him away would be . It is in the nature of things that he should cool into a friendly kindly feeling , and I shall try to bear it . Or if he does marry , it will be all right I suppose — ”
53206	53209	53210	53210	she	1706	“ There , ”
53220	53257	53210	53210	she	1706	“ there ’s my resolution , to do what I like more than anything in the world as long as I can ; and when it is over I shall be helped to do without it ! ”
53258	53264	53267	53267	Alison	180	“ I ca n’t believe — ”
53269	53280	53282	53282	Ermine	170	“ Not in your heart , but in your reason , ”
53288	53389	53282	53282	Ermine	170	“ He will hover about here , and always be kind , loving , considerate ; but a time will come that he will want the home happiness I can not give . Then he will not wear out his affection on the impossible literary cripple , but begin over again , and be happy . And , Alison , if your love for me is of the sound , strong sort I know it is , you will help me through with it , and never say one word to make all this less easy and obvious to him . ”

53619	53672	53820	53820	Ermine	170	“ You ca n’t tell ! You are contented with that sort of home peaceful sunshine that I know suffices many . Even intellectual as you are , you ca n’t tell what it is to feel power within , to strain at the leash , and see others in the race . ”
53673	53697	53525	53526	an editor	1709	“ I was thinking whether you could not make an acceptable paper on the lace system , which you really know so thoroughly . ”
53698	53703	53705	53705	Rachel	128	“ The fact is , ”
53707	53725	53705	53705	Rachel	128	“ it is much more difficult to describe from one ’s own observation than from other sources . ”
53726	53732	53734	53734	Ermine	170	“ But rather more original , ”
53745	53752	53754	53754	Rachel	128	“ I do n’t see that , ”
53756	53806	53754	53754	Rachel	128	“ It is abstract reasoning from given facts that I aim at , as you will understand when you have heard my ‘ Human Reeds , ’ and my other — dear me , there ’s your door bell . I thought that Colonel was gone for the day . ”

53879	53891	53867	53867	Rachel	128	“ that you would have been at Avoncester to - day . ”
53892	53911	53912	53912	he	1711	“ I always get out of the way of horse - dealing . I know no greater bore , ”
53915	53921	53922	53922	Conrade	126	“ Mamma sent me down , ”
53926	53990	53922	53922	Conrade	126	“ Mr. Keith ’s uncle found out that he knew Miss Williams — no , that ’s not it , Miss Williams ’ uncle found out that Mr. Keith preached a sermon , or something of that sort , so mamma sent me down to show him the way to call upon her ; but I need not stay now , need I ? ”
53991	54008	54010	54011	Alick Keith	125	“ After that elegant introduction , and lucid explanation , I think you may be excused , ”
54034	54058	54063	54063	his	5285	“ I wanted to see the toad and the pictures our Miss Williams told me about , but I ’ll come another time ; ”
54102	54115	54088	54088	Ermine	170	“ The elements of aunt and boy do not always work together . ”
54116	54119	54121	54121	Rachel	128	“ No , ”
54123	54143	54121	54121	Rachel	128	“ I have never been forgiven for being the first person who tried to keep those boys in order . ”
54144	54148	54150	54150	Ermine	170	“ And now , ”
54158	54176	54150	54150	Ermine	170	“ perhaps I may discover which of us , or of our uncles , preached a sermon . ”
54177	54183	54121	54121	Rachel	128	“ Mine , I suspect , ”
54188	54210	54185	54186	Mr. Keith	229	“ Your sister and I made out at luncheon that you had known my uncle , Mr. Clare , of Bishopsworthy . ”
54211	54218	54220	54220	Ermine	170	“ Mr. Clare ! Oh yes , ”
54223	54248	54220	54220	Ermine	170	“ he took the duty for one of our curates once for a long vacation . Did you ever hear him speak of Beauchamp ? ”
54249	54270	54185	54186	Mr. Keith	229	“ Yes , often ; and of Dr. Williams . He will be very much interested to hear of you . ”
54271	54280	54282	54282	Ermine	170	“ It was a time I well remember , ”
54284	54324	54282	54282	Ermine	170	“ He was an Oxford tutor then , and I was about fourteen , just old enough to be delighted to hear clever talk . And his sermons were memorable ; they were the first I ever listened to . ”
54325	54340	54342	54342	Rachel	128	“ There are few sermons that it is not an infliction to listen to , ”
54352	54366	54342	54342	Rachel	128	“ I assure you they are even more striking now in his blindness . ”
54367	54379	54381	54381	Rachel	128	“ Blindness ! Indeed , I had not heard of that . ”
54476	54481	54483	54483	Rachel	128	“ No one else ? ”
54485	54494	54483	54483	Rachel	128	“ I thought your sister lived at Bishopsworthy . ”
54495	54578	54594	54594	her	128	“ No , my sister lives , or has lived , at Little Worthy , the next parish , and as unlike it as possible . It has a railroad in it , and the cockneys have come down on it and ‘ villafied ’ it . My aunt , Mrs. Lacy Clare , has lived there ever since my sister has been with her ; but now her last daughter is to be married , she wishes to give up housekeeping . ”
54579	54589	54591	54591	Rachel	128	“ And your sister is coming to Lady Temple , ”
54602	54611	54594	54594	her	128	“ She will find it very dull here . ”
54612	54622	54624	54624	Alick	125	“ With all the advantages of Avoncester at hand ? ”
54654	54671	54645	54645	Rachel	128	“ In Lady Temple ’s situation any such thing would be most inconsistent with good feeling . ”
54672	54678	54687	54687	Alick	125	“ Such as the cathedral ? ”
54721	54728	54729	54729	she	170	“ If you meant the cathedral , ”
54760	54790	54753	54754	Miss Keith	244	“ I am afraid it is not of much benefit to people living at this distance , and there is not much to be said for the imitation here . ”
54791	54824	54825	54825	Rachel	128	“ You will see what my sister says to it . She only wants training to be the main strength of the Bishopsworthy choir , and perhaps she may find it here . ”
54881	54884	54885	54886	Mr. Keith	229	“ No , ”
54889	54949	54885	54886	Mr. Keith	229	“ it was very unlucky that Mr. Lifford did not know one note from another ; so that his vicar could not delude himself into hoping that his playing on his violin was anything but a nuisance to his companion , and in spite of all the curate ’s persuasions , he only indulged himself therewith on rare occasions . ”
54974	55002	54885	54886	Mr. Keith	229	added—“No one would suit him so well . Mr. Lifford has been with him ever since his sight began to fail , and understands all his ways . ”
55003	55012	54973	54973	he	229	“ Yes , that makes a great difference . ”
55013	55016	55018	55020	the young man	1245	“ And , ”
55034	55076	55028	55028	he	1245	“ though he is not quite all that a companion might be , my uncle says there would be no keeping the living without him , and I do not believe there would , unless my uncle would have me instead . ”
55100	55104	55106	55106	Alick	125	“ Another advantage , ”
55120	55147	55106	55106	Alick	125	“ is , that he is no impediment to Bessie ’s living there , for , poor man , he has a wife , but insane . ”
55148	55156	55158	55158	Rachel	128	“ Then your sister will live there ? ”
55160	55186	55158	55158	Rachel	128	“ What an enviable position , to have the control of means of doing good that always falls to the women of a clerical family . ”
55187	55192	55194	55195	the brother	1729	“ Tell her so , ”
55204	55213	55194	55195	the brother	1729	“ What , she does not think so ? ”
55214	55217	55219	55220	Mr. Keith	229	“ Now , ”
55225	55255	55219	55220	Mr. Keith	229	“ on my answer depends whether Bessie enters this place with a character for chanting , croquet , or crochet . Which should you like worst , Miss Curtis ? ”
55256	55264	55266	55266	Rachel	128	“ I like evasions worst of all , ”
55286	55298	55300	55301	Alick Keith	125	“ But you see , unfortunately , I do n’t know , ”
55305	55331	55332	55332	he	125	“ I have never been able to find out , nor she either . I do n’t know what may be the effect of example , ”
55352	55367	55369	55369	Rachel	128	“ I shall be very happy to show Miss Keith any of my ways , ”
55377	55392	55369	55369	Rachel	128	“ but she will find me terribly impeded here . When does she come ? ”
55393	55421	55332	55332	he	125	“ Not for a month or six weeks , when the wedding will be over . It is high time she saw something of her respected guardian . ”
55422	55426	55369	55369	Rachel	128	“ The Colonel ? ”
55427	55430	55369	55369	Rachel	128	“ Yes , ”
55435	55469	55369	55369	Rachel	128	“ Every one turns to him with reliance and confidence . I believe no one in the army received so many last charges as he has done , or executes them more fully . ”
55470	55473	55475	55475	Ermine	170	“ And , ”
55488	55493	55475	55475	Ermine	170	“ you are relations . ”
55494	55507	55369	55369	Rachel	128	“ So far away that only a Scotsman would acknowledge the cousinship . ”
55508	55517	55519	55519	Ermine	170	“ But do not you call yourself Scotch ? ”
55532	55542	55544	55544	Alick	125	“ My great grandfather came from Gowan - brae , ”
55546	55596	55544	55544	Alick	125	“ but our branch of the family has lived and died in the — th Highlanders for so many generations that we do n’t know what a home is out of it . Our birthplaces — yes , and our graves — are in all parts of the world . ”
55597	55604	55369	55369	Rachel	128	“ Were you ever in Scotland ? ”
55605	55650	55369	55369	Rachel	128	“ Never ; and I dread nothing so much as being quartered there . Just imagine the trouble it would be to go over the pedigree of every Keith I met , and to dine with them all upon haggis and sheeps ’ head ! ”
55651	55665	55667	55667	Rachel	128	“ There ’s no place I want to sea as much as Scotland , ”
55669	55679	55667	55667	Rachel	128	“ Oh , yes ! young ladies always do . ”
55680	55690	55692	55692	Rachel	128	“ It is not for a young lady reason , ”
55696	55739	55692	55692	Rachel	128	“ I want to understand the principle of diffused education , as there practised . The only other places I should really care to see are the Grand Reformatory for the Destitute in Holland , and the Hospital for Cretins in Switzerland . ”
55740	55758	55760	55761	Mr. Keith	229	“ Scotch pedants , Dutch thieves , Swiss goitres — I will bear your tastes in mind , ”
55768	55771	55773	55773	Rachel	128	“ Really , ”
55780	55881	55773	55773	Rachel	128	“ if he had not that silly military tone of joking , there might be something tolerable about him if he got into good hands . He seems to have some good notions about his sister . She must be just out of the school - room , at the very turn of life , and I will try to get her into my training and show her a little of the real beauty and usefulness of the career she has before her . How late he has stayed ! I am afraid there is no time for the manuscripts . ”
56024	56027	56000	56000	she	186	“ Oh ! ”
56033	56041	56000	56000	she	186	“ it ca n’t be for me ! ”
56042	56052	56054	56055	the Colonel	1244	“ Do you think it is for your aunt ? ”
56057	56071	56073	56073	Rose	186	“ Oh , thank you ! But such a beautiful creature for me ! ”
56082	56096	56073	56073	Rose	186	“ Aunt Ermine , how shall I ever make her clothes nice enough ? ”
56097	56119	56000	56000	she	186	“ We will see about that , my dear . Now take her into the verandah and introduce her to Violetta . ”
56120	56123	56073	56073	Rose	186	“ Yes ; ”
56133	56177	56073	56073	Rose	186	“ Aunt Ermine , I never saw such a beauty , except that one the little girl left behind on the bench on the esplanade , when Aunt Ailie said I should he coveting if I went on wishing Violetta was like her . ”
56178	56182	56184	56184	Ermine	170	“ I remember , ”
56186	56237	56184	56184	Ermine	170	“ I have heard enough of that ‘ ne plus ultra ’ of doll ! Indeed , Colin , you have given a great deal of pleasure , where the materials of pleasure are few . No one can guess the delight a doll is to a solitary imaginative child . ”
56238	56242	56243	56243	he	1734	“ Thank you , ”
56248	56260	56262	56262	Ermine	170	“ I believe I shall enjoy it as much as Rose , ”
56264	56302	56262	56262	Ermine	170	“ both for play and as a study . Please turn my chair a little this way , I want to see the introduction to Violetta . Here comes the beauty , in Rose ’s own cloak . ”
56331	56333	56326	56326	Violetta	147	“ slantingdicular ”
56364	56441	56447	56448	the Colonel	1244	“ Violetta , darling , you need not be afraid ! There is a new beautiful creature come , and I shall call her Colinette , and we must be very kind to her , because Colonel Keith is so good , and knows your grandpapa ; and to tell you a great secret , Violetta , that you must not tell Colinette or anybody , I think he is Aunt Ermine ’s own true knight . ”
56442	56445	56447	56448	the Colonel	1244	“ Hush ! ”
56463	56539	56456	56456	he	1244	“ So you must be very good to her , Violetta , and you shall help me make her clothes ; but you need not be afraid I ever could love any one half or one quarter as much as you , my own dear child , not if she were ten times as beautiful , and so come and show her to Augustus . She ’ll never be like you , dear old darling . ”
56540	56546	56548	56549	the Colonel	1244	“ It is a study , ”
56562	56571	56552	56552	Rose	186	“ a moral that you should take home . ”
56582	56592	56574	56574	her	170	“ Tell me , does your young cousin know — ”
56593	56657	56666	56666	her	170	“ Alick Keith ! Not from me , and Lady Temple is perfectly to be trusted ; but I believe his father knew it was for no worse reason that I was made to exchange . But never mind , Ermine , he is a very good fellow , and what is the use of making a secret of what even Violetta knows ? ”
56737	56830	56724	56724	she	170	“ And now I am going to make you useful . The editor of the ‘ Traveller ’ is travelling , and has left his work to me . I have been keeping some letters for him to answer in his own hand , because mine betrays womanhood ; but I have just heard that he is to stay about six weeks more , and people must be put out of their misery before that . Will you copy a few for me ? Here is some paper with the office stamp . ”
56831	56841	56724	56724	she	170	“ What an important woman you are , Ermine . ”
56842	56882	56897	56897	she	1244	“ If you had been in England all this time , you would see how easy the step is into literary work ; but you must not betray this for the ‘ Traveller ’s ’ sake or Ailie ’s . ”
56883	56891	56893	56894	the colonel	1244	“ Your writing is not very womanish , ”
56903	56935	56893	56894	the colonel	1244	“ Or is this yours ? It is not like that of those verses on Malvern hills that you copied out for me , the only thing you ever gave me . ”
56936	56964	56897	56897	she	1244	“ I hope it is more to the purpose than it was then , and it has had to learn to write in all sorts of attitudes . ”
56965	56970	56972	56972	he	1244	“ What ’s this ? ”
56979	57006	56972	56972	he	1244	“ your manuscript entitled ‘ Curatocult . ’ Is that the word ? I had taken it for the produce of Miss Curtis ’s unassisted genius . ”
57007	57015	57017	57017	Ermine	170	“ Have you heard her use it ! ”
57030	57092	57017	57017	Ermine	170	“ Oh yes ! I heard her declaiming on Sunday about what she knows no more about than Conrade ! A detestable , pragmatical , domineering girl ! I am thankful that I advised Lady Temple only to take the house for a year . It was right she should see her relations , but she must not be tyrannized over . ”
57093	57102	56972	56972	he	1244	“ I do n’t believe she dislikes it . ”
57103	57140	56972	56972	he	1244	“ She dislikes no one ! She used to profess a liking for a huge Irishwoman , whose husband had risen from the ranks ; the most tremendous woman I ever saw , except Miss Curtis . ”
57141	57152	57017	57017	Ermine	170	“ You know they were brought up together like sisters . ”
57153	57237	56972	56972	he	1244	“ All the worse , for she has the habit of passive submission . If it were the mother it would be all right , and I should be thankful to see her in good keeping , but the mother and sister go for nothing , and down comes this girl to battle every suggestion with principles picked up from every catchpenny periodical , things she does not half understand , and enunciates as if no one had even heard of them before . ”
57238	57268	56972	56972	he	1244	“ I believe she seldom meets any one who has . I mean to whom they are matters of thought . I really do like her vigour and earnestness . ”
57269	57300	57017	57017	Ermine	170	“ Do n’t say so , Ermine ! One reason why she is so intolerable to me is that she is a grotesque caricature of what you used to be . ”
57301	57360	56972	56972	he	1244	“ You have hit it ! I see why I always liked her , besides that it is pleasant to have any sort of visit , and a good scrimmage is refreshing ; she is just what I should have been without papa and Edward to keep me down , and without the civilizing atmosphere at the park . ”
57361	57364	56972	56972	he	1244	“ Never . ”
57365	57416	56972	56972	he	1244	“ No , I was not her equal in energy and beneficence , and I was younger when you came . But I feel for her longing to be up and doing , and her puzzled chafing against constraint and conventionality , though it breaks out in very odd effervescences . ”
57417	57434	56972	56972	he	1244	“ Extremely generous of you when you must be bored to death with her interminable talk . ”
57435	57518	56972	56972	he	1244	“ You do n’t appreciate the pleasure of variety ! Besides , she really interests me , she is so full of vigorous crudities . I believe all that is unpleasing in her arises from her being considered as the clever woman of the family ; having no man nearly connected enough to keep her in check , and living in society that does not fairly meet her . I want you to talk to her , and take her in hand . ”
57519	57549	56972	56972	he	1244	“ Me ! Thank you , Ermine ! Why , I could not even stand her talking about you , though she has the one grace of valuing you . ”
57550	57586	56972	56972	he	1244	“ Then you ought , in common gratitude , for there is no little greatness of soul in patiently coming down to Mackarel Lane to be snubbed by one ’s cousin ’s governess ’s sister . ”
57587	57605	56972	56972	he	1244	“ If you will come up to Myrtlewood , you do n’t know what you may do . ”
57606	57628	56972	56972	he	1244	“ No , you are to set no more people upon me , though Lady Temple ’s eyes are very wistful . ”
57629	57642	56972	56972	he	1244	“ I did not think you would have held out against her . ”
57643	57688	56972	56972	he	1244	“ Not when I had against you ? No , indeed , though I never did see anybody more winning than she is in that meek , submissive gentleness ! Alison says she has cheered up and grown like another creature since your arrival . ”
57689	57819	56972	56972	he	1244	“ And Alexander Keith ’s . Yes , poor thing , we have brought something of her own old world , where she was a sort of little queen in her way . It is too much to ask me to have patience with these relations , Ermine . If you could see the change from the petted creature she was with her mother and husband , almost always the first lady in the place , and latterly with a colonial court of her own , and now , ordered about , advised , domineered over , made nobody of , and taking it as meekly and sweetly as if she were grateful for it ! I verily believe she is ! But she certainly ought to come away . ”
57820	57854	56972	56972	he	1244	“ I am not so sure of that . It seems to me rather a dangerous responsibility to take her away from her own relations , unless there were any with equal claims . ”
57855	57933	56972	56972	he	1244	“ They are her only relations , and her husband had none . Still to be under the constant yoke of an overpowering woman with unfixed opinions seems to be an unmitigated evil for her and her boys ; and no one ’s feelings need be hurt by her fixing herself near some public school for her sons ’ education . However , she is settled for this year , and at the end we may decide . ”
58021	58023	58012	58012	he	1742	“ Traveller ”
58032	58044	58012	58012	he	1742	“ there was such a want of original thought in it . ”
58086	58103	58083	58083	she	170	“ Indeed ! Then we had better enliven it with the recollections of a military secretary , ”
58127	58130	58131	58131	he	1742	“ But , ”
58134	58179	58131	58131	he	1742	“ there is something in that girl , I perceive , Ermine ; she does think for herself , and if she were not so dreadfully earnest that she ca n’t smile , she would be the best company of any of the party . ”
58180	58234	58083	58083	she	170	“ I am so glad you think so ! I shall be delighted if you will really talk to her , and help her to argue out some of her crudities . Indeed she is worth it . But I suppose you will hardly stay here long enough to do her any good . ”
58235	58246	58117	58117	she	170	“ What , are you going to order me away ? ”
58247	58257	58131	58131	he	1742	“ I thought your brother wanted you at home . ”
58258	58349	58083	58083	she	170	“ It is all very well to talk of an ancestral home , but when it consists of a tall , slim house , with blank walls and pepper - box turrets , set down on a bleak hill side , and every one gone that made it once a happy place , it is not attractive . Moreover , my only use there would be to be kept as a tame heir , the person whose interference would be most resented , and I do n’t recognise that duty . ”
58350	58363	58365	58365	Ermine	170	“ You are a gentleman at large , with no obvious duty , ”
58369	58374	58376	58376	his	1745	“ What , none ? ”
58385	58396	58397	58397	she	170	“ Oh , if you come here out of duty — ”
58407	58424	58425	58425	she	170	“ There , is not that a nice occasion for picking a quarrel ? And seriously , ”
58428	58459	58425	58425	she	170	“ perhaps it might be good for you if we did . I am beginning to fear that I ought not to keep you lingering here without purpose or occupation . ”
58460	58471	58403	58403	her	170	“ Fulfil my purpose , and I will find occupation . ”
58472	58478	58403	58403	her	170	“ Do n’t say that . ”
58479	58527	58425	58425	she	170	“ This once , Ermine . For one year I shall wait in the hope of convincing you . If you do not change , your mind in that time , I shall look for another staff appointment , to last till Rose is ready for me . ”
58537	58547	58548	58548	she	170	“ That ’s what you learnt of your chief , ”
58551	58560	58561	58561	he	1746	“ There would be less difference in age , ”
58564	58585	58586	58586	he	1746	“ Though I own I should like my widow to be less helpless than poor little Lady Temple . So , ”
58597	58623	58586	58586	he	1746	“ if you continue to reject me yourself , you will at least rear her with an especial view to her efficiency in that capacity . ”
58674	58677	58650	58650	he	1746	“ my work ”
58679	58685	58686	58686	he	1746	“ Aunt Ermine ’s work , ”
58710	58732	58686	58686	he	1746	“ Aunt Ermine says I must learn to manage , because some day I shall have to take care of papa . ”
58733	58736	58738	58738	his	1746	“ Yes , ”
58746	58770	58738	58738	his	1746	“ learn to be a useful woman ; who knows if we sha n’t all depend on you by - and - by ? ”
58771	58781	58783	58783	Rose	186	“ Oh do let me be useful to you , ”
58785	58801	58783	58783	Rose	186	“ I could hem all your handkerchiefs , and make you a kettle - holder . ”
59052	59060	59061	59061	she	128	“ The worst despotism practised in England , ”
59064	59128	59061	59061	she	128	“ is that of coachmen , and it is well that Fanny should be spared ! The coachman who lived here when mamma was married , answered her request to go a little faster , ‘ I shall drive my horses as I plazes , ’ and I really think the present one is rather worse in deed , though not in word . ”
59179	59192	59193	59193	she	128	“ And dear Sir Stephen did so dislike the sight of them , ”
59213	59220	59222	59222	Rachel	128	“ On the whole , mother , ”
59224	59265	59222	59222	Rachel	128	“ unless there is more heart - break than Fanny professes , there ’s more coquetry in a pretty young thing wearing a cap that says , ‘ come pity me , ’ than in going about like other people . ”
59266	59280	59282	59283	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ I only wish she could help looking like a girl of seventeen , ”
59285	59320	59282	59283	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ If that colonel were but married , or the other young man ! I ’m sure she will fall into some scrape ; she does not know how , out of sheer innocence . ”
59321	59343	59222	59222	Rachel	128	“ Well , mother , you know I always mean to ride with her , and that will be a protection . ”
59344	59370	59282	59283	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ But , my dear , I am not sure about your riding with these gay officers ; you never used to do such things . ”
59371	59385	59222	59222	Rachel	128	“ At my age , mother , and to take care of Fanny . ”
60415	60420	60411	60411	Curatocult	250	“ declined with thanks . ”
60462	60478	60453	60453	he	207	“ That is great candour . Men generally grudge whatever they think their own privilege . ”
60479	60524	60411	60411	Curatocult	250	“ Many things can often be felt and expressed by an able woman better than by a man , and there is no reason that the utterance of anything worthy to be said should be denied , provided it is worthy to be said . ”
60525	60543	60411	60411	Curatocult	250	“ Ah ! there comes the hit . I wondered if you would get through without it . ”
60544	60587	60453	60453	he	207	“ It was not meant as a hit . Men are as apt to publish what is not worth saying as women can be , and some women are so conscientious as only to put forth what is of weight and value . ”
60588	60603	60453	60453	he	207	“ And you are above wanting to silence them by palaver about unfeminine publicity ? ”
60604	60631	60411	60411	Curatocult	250	“ There is no need of publicity . Much of the best and most wide - spread writing emanates from the most quiet , unsuspected quarters . ”
60632	60642	60453	60453	he	207	“ That is the benefit of an anonymous press . ”
60643	60690	60453	60453	he	207	“ Yes . The withholding of the name prevents well - mannered people from treating a woman as an authoress , if she does not proclaim herself one ; and the difference is great between being known to write , and setting up for an authoress . ”
60691	60713	60411	60411	Curatocult	250	“ Between fact and pretension . But write or not write , there is an instinctive avoidance of an intellectual woman . ”
60714	60765	60453	60453	he	207	“ Not always , for the simple manner that goes with real superiority is generally very attractive . The larger and deeper the mind , the more there would be of the genuine humbleness and gentleness that a shallow nature is incapable of . The very word humility presupposes depth . ”
60766	60773	60775	60775	Rachel	128	“ I see what you mean , ”
60777	60794	60775	60775	Rachel	128	“ Gentleness is not feebleness , nor lowness lowliness . There must be something held back . ”
60795	60801	60803	60804	Colonel Keith	207	“ I see it daily , ”
60832	60839	60841	60841	Rachel	128	“ Superior natures lowly and gentle ! ”
60845	61027	60841	60841	Rachel	128	“ Am I so to him , then , or is he deceiving himself ? What is to be done ? At my age ! Such a contravention of my principles ! A soldier , an honourable , a title in prospect , Fanny ’s major ! Intolerable ! No , no ! My property absorbed by a Scotch peerage , when I want it for so many things ! Never . I am sorry for him though . It is hard that a man who can forgive a woman for intellect , should be thrown back on poor little Fanny ; and it is gratifying—. But I am untouched yet , and I will take care of myself . At my age a woman who loves at all , loves with all the gathered force of her nature , and I certainly feel no such passion . No , certainly not ; and I am resolved not to be swept along till I have made up my mind to yield to the force of the torrent . Let us see . ”
61028	61034	61036	61037	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Grace , my dear , ”
61047	61066	61036	61037	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ is not dear Rachel looking very well ? I never saw her dress so well put on . ”
61067	61076	61078	61078	Grace	127	“ Yes , she is looking very handsome , ”
61080	61103	61078	61078	Grace	127	“ I am glad she has consented to have her hair in that now way , it is very becoming to her . ”
61104	61118	61120	61121	the mother	4964	“ I — I do n’t know that it is all the hair , ”
61132	61200	61120	61121	the mother	4964	“ but it seemed to me that we need not have been so uneasy about dear Fanny . I think , do n’t you ? that there may be another attraction . To be sure , it would be at a terrible distance from us ; but so good and kind as he is , it would be such a thing for you and Fanny as well — ”
61207	61213	61201	61201	Grace	127	“ Yes , my dear , ”
61223	61273	61214	61215	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ she would be a dreadful loss to us ; but you see , so clever and odd as she is , and with such peculiar ideas , I should be so thankful to see her in the hands of some good , sensible man that would guide her . ”
61274	61286	61201	61201	Grace	127	“ But do you really think it is so , mother ? ”
61287	61322	61323	61323	Grace	127	“ Mind , my dear , it is nothing to build on , but I can not help being struck , and just thinking to myself . I know you ’ll not say anything . ”
61704	61715	61717	61717	Colin	236	“ This comes of being the youngest of the family , ”
61721	61752	61717	61717	Colin	236	“ One is never supposed capable of taking care of one ’s self . With Keith I shall be the gay extravagant young officer to the end of my days . ”
61753	61762	61764	61764	Ermine	186	“ You are not forgiving to your brother , ”
61766	61778	61779	61779	he	503	“ You have it in your power to make me so , ”
61783	61792	61793	61793	she	186	“ Then you would have nothing to forgive , ”
61901	61908	61909	61909	he	503	“ My brother knows the whole , ”
61912	61924	61909	61909	he	503	“ and I do not wish to attempt to conceal anything . ”
61925	61933	61935	61935	Fanny	127	“ I do not mean to conceal , ”
61937	61958	61935	61935	Fanny	127	“ only I thought it might save a shock — appearances — he might think better of it , if — ”
61959	61967	61969	61970	the colonel	1244	“ You thought only what was kind , ”
61972	62014	61969	61970	the colonel	1244	“ and I thank you for it most warmly ; but this matter does not depend on my brother ’s consent , and even if it did , Ermine ’s own true position is that which is most honourable to her . ”
62451	62458	62459	62459	He	199	“ a long - backed Scotchman . ”
62694	62698	62684	62685	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ old school , ”
62829	62842	62844	62845	the colonel	1244	“ Can you bear it ? You will not like to play ? ”
62869	62892	62850	62850	he	1841	“ Oh ! I do n’t mind . I like anything like old times , and my aunt does not like playing — ”
63235	63238	63240	63240	Rachel	128	“ Why , ”
63247	63258	63240	63240	Rachel	128	“ you have not been ten years in the army ! ”
63259	63267	63268	63268	he	125	“ I had my commission at sixteen , ”
63271	63281	63282	63282	she	128	“ You are not six - and - twenty ! ”
63285	63293	63299	63299	his	125	“ You are as right as usual , ”
63304	63313	63299	63299	his	125	“ at least till the 1st of August . ”
63314	63318	63320	63321	her mother	496	“ My dear ! ”
63348	63368	63320	63321	her mother	496	“ you are hardly come to the time of life for liking to hear that your looks deceived us . ”
63369	63374	63375	63375	he	125	“ Boys are tolerated , ”
63671	63682	63683	63683	she	128	“ I beg your pardon ; I ’m so sorry — ”
63687	63699	63700	63700	he	229	“ Inferior animals can dispense with a member more or less , ”
63737	63755	63758	63758	he	229	“ That venerable animal is apparently indifferent to having left a third of two legs behind him , ”
63834	63838	63822	63822	she	128	“ Where — ? ”
63839	63845	63846	63846	he	229	“ Not under the handkerchief , ”
63860	63867	63846	63846	he	229	“ At Delhi , I imagine . ”
64041	64196	64267	64267	she	138	“ Surely , surely , it must not be that womanhood in its contemptible side is still so strong that I want to keep all for myself ! Shame ! And this may be the true life love , suppressed , now able to revive ! I have no right to be disgusted , I will watch minutely , and judge if he will be a good guide and father to the boys , though it may save the colonel trouble . Pish ! what have I to do with either ? Why should I think about them ? Yet I must care for Fanny , I must dislike to see her lower herself even in the eyes of the world . Would it really be lowering herself ? I can not tell , I must think it out . I wish that game was over , or that Grace would let one speak . ”
64224	64265	64220	64220	her	138	“ Please , Mr. Touchett , let this go towards some treat for the school children . I should not like to give it in any serious way , you know , but just for some little pleasure for them . ”
64691	64696	64683	64684	his brother	503	“ these unfortunate ladies . ”
64917	64920	64921	64921	he	1244	“ Well , ”
64924	64940	64921	64921	he	1244	“ What she thought of his brother , and if he were what she expected ? ”
64941	64996	64906	64906	he	1244	“ Very much , only older and feebler . And did he communicate his views of Mackarel Lane ? I saw him regarding , me as a species of mermaid or syren , evidently thinking it a great shame that I have not a burnt face . If he had only known about Rose ! ”
64997	65054	65116	65116	she	1912	“ The worst of it is that he wants me to go home with him , and I am afraid I must do so , for now that he and I are the last in the entail , there is an opportunity of making an arrangement about the property , for which he is very anxious . ”
65055	65073	65116	65116	she	1912	“ Well , you know , I have long thought it would be very good for you . ”
65074	65091	65093	65093	he	1911	“ And when I am there I shall have to visit every one in the family ; ”
65120	65126	65116	65116	she	1912	“ You know you ought . ”
65127	65140	65116	65116	she	1912	“ Then you deliver me up to Keith ’s tender mercies till — ”
65141	65153	65116	65116	she	1912	“ Till you have done your duty — and forgiven him . ”
65154	65204	65116	65116	she	1912	“ Remember , Ermine , I ca n’t spend a winter in Scotland . A cold always makes the ball remind me of its presence in my chest , and I was told that if I spent a winter at home , it must be on the Devonshire coast . ”
65205	65217	65218	65218	she	1912	“ That ball is sufficient justification for ourselves , I allow , ”
65235	65249	65218	65218	she	1912	“ And meantime you will write to me — about Rose ’s education . ”
65250	65265	65266	65266	Alison	180	“ To be sure , or what would be the use of growing old ? ”
65350	65385	65344	65344	she	186	“ It has been too bright a summer to last for ever . It would be very wrong to wish him to stay dangling here . Let what will happen , he is himself . ”
65787	65791	65793	65793	Ermine	186	“ I understand , ”
65805	65821	65823	65824	Lord Keith	199	“ I was sure that a person of your great good sense would do so , ”
65826	65859	65823	65824	Lord Keith	199	“ I assure you no one can be more sensible than myself of the extreme forbearance , discretion , and regard for my brother ’s true welfare that has been shown here . ”
65895	65938	65950	65950	Ermine	186	“ And now , knowing the influence over him that , most deservedly , you must always possess , I am induced to hope that , as his sincere friend , you will exert it in favour of the more prudent counsels . ”
65939	65948	65950	65950	Ermine	186	“ I have no influence over his judgment , ”
65956	65960	65962	65963	Lord Keith	199	“ I mean , ”
65971	66048	65962	65963	Lord Keith	199	“ you will excuse me for speaking thus openly — that in the state of the case , with so much depending on his making a satisfactory choice , I feel convinced , with every regret , that you will feel it to be for his true welfare — as indeed I infer that you have already endeavoured to show him — to make a new beginning , and to look on the past as past . ”
66092	66100	66101	66101	she	186	“ Colonel Keith must judge for himself , ”
66114	66120	66122	66123	Lord Keith	199	“ I — I understand , ”
66125	66152	66122	66123	Lord Keith	199	“ that you had most honourably , most consistently , made him aware that — that what once might have been desirable has unhappily become impossible . ”
66153	66156	66158	66158	Ermine	186	“ Well , ”
66160	66164	66165	66165	he	199	“ And thus , ”
66168	66197	66165	66165	he	199	“ that the sincere friendship with which you still regard him would prevent any encouragement to continue an attachment , unhappily now hopeless and obstructive to his prospects . ”
66206	66210	66211	66211	she	186	“ Lord Keith , ”
66214	66252	66211	66211	she	186	“ I have never sought your brother ’s visits nor striven to prolong them ; but if he finds pleasure in them after a life of disappointment and trouble , I can not refuse nor discourage them . ”
66253	66258	66260	66261	Lord Keith	199	“ I am aware , ”
66269	66295	66260	66261	Lord Keith	199	“ that I have trespassed long on your time , and made a suggestion only warranted by the generosity with which you have hitherto acted . ”
66296	66312	66314	66314	Ermine	186	“ One may be generous of one ’s own , not of other people ’s , ”
66325	66364	66316	66316	He	199	“ Perhaps it will be best to speak categorically , Miss Williams . Let it be distinctly understood that my brother Colin , in paying his addresses to you , is necessarily without my sanction or future assistance . ”
66365	66378	66380	66380	her	186	“ It might not be necessary , my lord . Good morning ; ”
66418	66425	66393	66393	she	180	“ Pride and perverseness , Ailie ! ”
66435	66494	66393	66393	she	180	“ I believe he was justified in all he said . But , Ailie , I have preached to Colin more than I had a right to do about forgiving his brother . I did not know how provoking he can be . I did not think it was still in me to fly out as I did ! ”
66495	66508	66510	66510	Alison	180	“ He had no business to come here interfering and tormenting you , ”
66514	66556	66510	66510	Alison	180	“ I dare say he thought he had ! But one could not think of that when it came to threatening me with his giving no help to Colin if — There was no resisting telling him how little we cared ! ”
66557	66571	66393	66393	she	180	“ You have not offended him so that he will keep Colin away ! ”
66572	66701	66393	66393	she	180	“ The more he tried , the more Colin would come ! No , I am not sorry for having offended him . I do n’t mind him ; but Ailie , how little one knows ! All the angry and bitter feelings that I thought burnt out for ever when I lay waiting for death , are stirred up as hotly as they were long ago . The old self is here as strong as ever ! Ailie , do n’t tell Colin about this ; but to - morrow is a saint ’s day , and would you see Mr. Touchett , and try to arrange for me to go to the early service ? I think then I might better be helped to conquer this . ”
66702	66717	66393	66393	she	180	“ But , Ermine , how can you ? Eight o’clock , you know . ”
66718	66777	66778	66778	Alison	180	“ Yes , dearest , it will give you a great deal of trouble , but you never mind that , you know ; and I am so much stronger than I used to be , that you need not fear . Besides , I want help so much ! And it is the day Colin goes away ! ”
66859	66868	66869	66869	she	186	“ I am glad to have met you , ”
66872	66883	66884	66884	he	199	“ I am glad to see you out so early , ”
66889	66895	66896	66896	she	186	“ This is an exception , ”
66905	66934	66896	66896	she	186	“ Good - bye , I have thought over what passed yesterday , and I believe we are more agreed than perhaps I gave you reason to think . ”
66960	66965	66957	66957	she	186	“ Good - bye , ”
66980	66985	66975	66976	Lord Keith	199	“ Good - bye ; ”
66994	67004	66975	66976	Lord Keith	199	“ After all , that is a remarkable woman . ”
67011	67015	67021	67021	she	180	“ Only nerves , ”
67665	67671	67672	67672	she	128	“ I will try myself , ”
67677	67703	67672	67672	she	128	“ if I am heartily interested in my occupations by the end of the next week , then I shall believe myself my own woman ! ”
68172	68180	68182	68183	Captain Keith	258	“ Will you allow me a seat ? ”
68213	68228	68230	68231	his sister	5961	“ If you were good for anything , you would sit outside and smoke , ”
68233	68251	68252	68252	he	258	“ If privacy is required for swearing an eternal friendship , I can go to sleep instead , ”
68259	68264	68252	68252	he	258	“ Quite the reverse , ”
68269	68282	68252	68252	he	258	“ he has prepared me to hate you all , Miss Curtis . ”
68283	68290	68292	68293	the brother	1729	“ On the mutual aversion principle , ”
68295	68324	68292	68293	the brother	1729	“ Do n’t you flatter yourself ! Have you found out , Miss Curtis , that it is the property of this species always to go by contraries ? ”
68325	68339	68341	68341	Alick	125	“ To Miss Curtis I always appear in the meekest state of assent , ”
68343	68358	68341	68341	Alick	125	“ Then I would not be Miss Curtis . How horribly you must differ ! ”
68418	68430	68408	68408	she	128	“ How has he prepared you to hate us?—By praising us ? ”
68431	68453	68408	68408	she	128	“ Oh , no ; that would have been too much on the surface . He knew the effect of that , ”
68465	68525	68527	68527	she	128	“ No ; his very reserve said , I am going to take her to ground too transcendent for her to walk on , but if I say one word , I shall never get her there at all . It was a deep refinement , you see , and he really meant it , but I was deeper , ”
68534	68544	68546	68546	Rachel	128	“ You are always trying which can go deepest ? ”
68548	68556	68546	68546	Rachel	128	“ It is a sweet fraternal sport , ”
68560	68566	68568	68568	Bessie	204	“ Have you no brother ? ”
68570	68573	68568	68568	Bessie	204	“ No . ”
68574	68586	68588	68588	she	128	“ Then you do n’t know what detestable creatures they are , ”
68642	68655	68657	68658	her brother	1120	“ Have a care , Bessie ; Miss Curtis will despise you , ”
68660	68667	68669	68669	Rachel	128	“ Why should you think so ? ”
68684	68694	68669	68669	Rachel	128	“ Have I not been withered by your scorn ! ”
68695	68700	68701	68701	Rachel	128	“ I — I — ”
68747	68766	68734	68735	Bessie Keith	204	“ What , Alick , you have brought the service into disrepute ! I am ashamed of you ! ”
68767	68772	68774	68774	Rachel	128	“ Oh , no ! ”
68799	68824	68825	68825	Her	128	“ only we had been used to regard officers as necessarily empty and frivolous , and our recent experience has — has been otherwise . ”
68831	68871	68825	68825	Her	128	“ There , Alick , is that the effect of your weight of wisdom ? I shall be more impressed with it than ever . It has redeemed the character of your profession . Captain Keith and the army . ”
68872	68882	68884	68884	Alick	125	“ I am afraid I can not flatter myself , ”
68904	68913	68892	68892	Rachel	128	“ its reputation has been in better hands . ”
68914	68962	68825	68825	Her	128	“ O Colonel Colin ! Depend upon it , he is not half as sage as you , Alick . Why , he is a dozen years older!—What , do n’t you know , Miss Curtis , that the older people grow the less sage they get ? ”
68963	68968	68970	68970	Rachel	128	“ I hope not , ”
68972	68993	68970	68970	Rachel	128	“ Do you ! A contrary persuasion sustains me when I see people obnoxiously sage to their fellow - creatures . ”
68994	69008	69010	69010	Alick	125	“ Obnoxious sageness in youth is the token that there is stuff behind , ”
69115	69119	69112	69113	Mr. Clare	241	“ Very well , ”
69124	69142	69112	69113	Mr. Clare	241	“ unfailing in spirits , every one agreed that he was the youngest man at the wedding . ”
69143	69150	69152	69152	Bessie	204	“ Having outgrown his obnoxious sageness , ”
69154	69176	69152	69152	Bessie	204	“ There is nothing he is so adroit at as guessing the fate of a croquet - ball by its sound . ”
69177	69181	69183	69183	Alick	125	“ Now Bessie , ”
69185	69194	69196	69196	Bessie	204	“ I have not transgressed , have I ? ”
69208	69261	69205	69205	she	204	“ You see what want of confidence is . This brother of mine no sooner saw you in the carriage than he laid his commands on me not to ask after your croquet - ground all the way home , and the poor word can not come out of my mouth without — ”
69262	69292	69293	69293	he	1977	“ I only told you not to bore Miss Curtis with the eternal subject , as she would think you had no more brains than one of your mallets , ”
69299	69317	69293	69293	he	1977	“ And if we had begun to talk croquet , we should soon have driven him outside . ”
69318	69327	69329	69329	Rachel	128	“ But suppose I could not talk it , ”
69331	69341	69329	69329	Rachel	128	“ and that we have no ground for it . ”
69342	69345	69346	69346	she	128	“ Why , then,”—and
69352	69369	69293	69293	he	1977	eyes,—“I can only aver that the coincidence of sentiments is no doubt the work of destiny . ”
69370	69373	69375	69376	her brother	1120	“ Bessie ! ”
69378	69418	69375	69376	her brother	1120	“ Poor old fellow ! you had excuse enough , lying on the sofa to the tune of tap and click ; but for a young lady in the advanced ranks of civilization to abstain is a mere marvel . ”
69419	69429	69431	69431	Rachel	128	“ Surely it is a great waste of time , ”
69433	69454	69431	69431	Rachel	128	“ Ah ! when I have converted you , you will wonder what people did with themselves before the invention . ”
69455	69461	69375	69376	her brother	1120	“ Woman ’s mission discovered , ”
69466	69476	69431	69431	Rachel	128	“ Also man ’s , unless he neglects it , ”
69481	69496	69478	69479	Miss Elizabeth	262	“ I wonder , now , if you would play if Miss Curtis did . ”
69497	69510	69431	69431	Rachel	128	“ Wisdom never pledges itself how it will act in hypothetical circumstances , ”
69515	69518	69521	69522	Bessie Keith	204	“ Hypothetical , ”
69524	69553	69521	69522	Bessie Keith	204	“ did you teach him that word , Miss Curtis ? Well , if I do n’t bring about the hypothetical circumstances , you may call me hyperbolical . ”
69693	69697	69698	69698	she	128	“ I remember , ”
69701	69750	69698	69698	she	128	“ Mrs. Curtis kept great order . In fact , between ourselves , she was rather a dragon ; and Lady Temple , though she had one child then , seemed like my companion and playfellow . Dear little Lady Temple , I wonder if she is altered ! ”
69751	69757	69698	69698	she	128	“ Not in the least , ”
69900	69906	69908	69908	Bessie	204	“ It was very stupid , ”
69910	69959	69908	69908	Bessie	204	“ of none of those girls to have Uncle George to marry them . My aunt fancied he would be nervous , but I know he did marry a couple when Mr. Lifford was away ; I mean him to marry me , as I told them all . ”
69960	69972	69974	69974	Alick	125	“ You had better wait till you know whether he will , ”
69976	69994	69996	69996	Bessie	204	“ Will ? Oh , he is always pleased to feel he can do like other people , ”
69998	70041	69996	69996	Bessie	204	“ and I ’ll undertake to see that he puts the ring on the right — I mean the left finger . Because you ’ll have to give me away , you know , Alick , so you can look after him . ”
70042	70053	70055	70055	Rachel	128	“ You seem to have arranged the programme pretty thoroughly , ”
70057	70077	70055	70055	Rachel	128	“ After four weddings at home , one ca n’t but lay by a little experience for the future , ”
70081	70121	70055	70055	Rachel	128	“ and after all , Alick need not look as if it must be for oneself . He is quite welcome to profit by it , if he has the good taste to want my uncle to marry him . ”
70122	70135	70137	70137	Alick	125	“ Not unless I were very clear that he liked my choice , ”
70141	70183	70185	70185	Bessie	204	“ Oh , dear ! Have you any doubts , or is that meant for a cut at poor innocent me , as if I could help people ’s folly , or as if he was not gone to Rio Janeiro , ”
70285	70295	70296	70296	she	204	“ I am afraid that I was very naughty , ”
70314	70391	70296	70296	she	204	“ but I never can resist plaguing that dear anxious brother of mine , and he did so dreadfully take to heart the absurdities of that little Charlie Carleton , as if any one with brains could think him good for anything but a croquet partner , that I could not help giving a little gentle titillation . I saw you did not like it , dear Lady Temple , and I am sorry for it . ”
70392	70401	70403	70403	Fanny	127	“ I hope I did not vex you , ”
70411	70430	70403	70403	Fanny	127	“ Oh , no , indeed ; a little check just makes one feel one is cared for , ”
70436	70473	70403	70403	Fanny	127	“ you see when one has a very wise brother , plaguing him is irresistible . How little Stephana will plague hers , in self - defence , with so many to keep her in order . ”
70474	70480	70296	70296	she	204	“ They all spoil her . ”
70481	70519	70296	70296	she	204	“ Ah , this is the golden age . See what it will be when they think themselves responsible for her ! Dear Lady Temple , how could you send him home so old and so grave ? ”
70520	70561	70403	70403	Fanny	127	“ I am afraid we sent him home very ill . I never expected to see him so perfectly recovered . I could hardly believe my eyes when Colonel Keith brought him to the carriage not in the least lame . ”
70562	70610	70296	70296	she	204	“ Yes ; and it was half against his will . He would have been almost glad to be a lay curate to Uncle George , only he knew if he was fit for service my father would have been vexed at his giving up his profession . ”
70611	70619	70621	70621	Rachel	128	“ Then it was not his choice ! ”
70623	70716	70621	70621	Rachel	128	“ Oh , he was born a soldier , like all the rest of us , could n’t help it . The — th is our home , and if he would only take my hint and marry , I could be with him there , now ! Lady Temple , do pray send for all the eligible officers — I do n’t know any of them now , except the two majors , and Alick suspects my designs , I believe , for he wo n’t tell me anything about them . ”
70717	70721	70723	70723	Fanny	127	“ My dear ! ”
70727	70743	70723	70723	Fanny	127	“ how you talk ; you know we are living a very quiet life here . ”
70744	70755	70756	70756	she	127	“ Oh , yes , so Alick has told me , ”
70767	70775	70777	70777	she	127	“ you must be patient with me , ”
70790	70808	70777	70777	she	127	“ I am used to be a great chatter - box , and nobody protested but Alick . ”
70809	70905	70907	70907	Fanny	127	“ I wish you would tell me about his return , my dear ; he seemed so unfit to travel when your poor father came to the hills and took him away by dak . It seemed so impossible he could bear the journey ; he could not stand or help himself at all , and had constant returns of fever ; but they said the long sea voyage was the only chance , and that in India he could not get vigour enough to begin to recover . I was very unhappy about him , ”
70931	71043	70777	70777	she	127	“ Yes , the voyage did him good , but the tidings of papa ’s death came two months before him , and Uncle George ’s eyes were in such a state that he had to be kept in the dark , so that no one could go and meet the poor dear boy at Southampton but Mr. Lifford , and the shock of the news he heard brought the fever back , and it went on intermitting for weeks and weeks . We had him at Littleworthy at first , thinking he could be better nursed and more cheerful there , but there was no keeping the house quiet enough . ”
71044	71047	71049	71049	Rachel	128	“ Croquet ! ”
71051	71054	71056	71056	Bessie	204	“ Everything ! ”
71058	71199	71056	71056	Bessie	204	“ Four courtships in more or less progress , besides a few flirtations , and a house where all the neighbours were running in and out in a sociable way . Our loss was not as recent there as it was to him , and they were only nieces , so we could not have interfered with them ; besides , my aunt was afraid he would be dull , and wanted to make the most of her conquering hero , and everybody came and complimented him , and catechised him whether he believed in the Indian mutilations , when , poor fellow , he had seen horrors enough never to bear to think of them , except when the fever brought them all over again . I am sure there was excuse enough for his being a little irritable . ”
71200	71204	71206	71206	Fanny	127	“ My dear , ”
71211	71222	71206	71206	Fanny	127	“ he was patience itself while he was with us . ”
71223	71356	71056	71056	Bessie	204	“ That ’s the difference between illness and recovery , dear Lady Temple ! I do n’t blame him . Any one might be irritable with fresh undetected splinters of bone always working themselves out , all down one side ; and doubts which were worse , the fingers on , or the fingers off , and no escape from folly or politeness , for he could not even use a crutch . Oh , no , I do n’t blame him ; I quite excuse the general dislike he took to everything at poor dear Littleworthy . He viewed it all like that child in Mrs. Browning ’s poem , ‘ seeing through tears the jugglers leap , ’ and we have partaken of the juggler aspect to him ever since ! ”
71357	71369	71371	71371	Fanny	127	“ I do n’t think he could ever be very irritable , ”
71380	71385	71388	71388	Bessie	204	“ Sister and recovery ! ”
71390	71582	71388	71388	Bessie	204	“ they encounter what no one else does ! He only pined for Bishopsworthy , and when we let him move there , after the first month , he and my uncle were happy . I stayed there for a little while , but I was only in the way , the dear good folks were always putting themselves out on my account ; and as to Alick , you ca n’t think how the absence of his poor ‘ souffre - douleur , ’ invigorated him . Every day I found him able to put more point into his cutting compliments , and reading to my uncle with more energy ; till at last by the time the — th came home , he had not so much as a stiff leg to retire upon . Luckily , he and my uncle both cared too much for my poor father ’s wishes for him to do so without , though if any unlucky chance should take Mr. Lifford away from my uncle , he threatens coming to supply the vacancy , unless I should , and that is past hope . ”
71583	71591	71593	71593	Rachel	128	“ Your home is with your uncle , ”
71595	71598	71599	71599	she	128	“ Yes , ”
71604	71694	71599	71599	she	128	“ dear Littleworthy was too happy to last . It broke itself up by its own charms — all married and gone , and the last rose of summer in my poor person must float away . Jane wants her mother and not me , and my uncle will submit to me as cheerfully as to other necessary evils . It is not myself that I fear for ; I shall be very happy with the dear uncle , but it will be a dreadful overthrow to his habits . ”
71695	71705	71707	71707	Rachel	128	“ I do not see why it need be , ”
71709	71733	71707	71707	Rachel	128	“ What ! two old bachelors with a young lady turned in on them ! And the housekeeper — think of her feelings ! ”
71734	71747	71749	71749	Fanny	127	“ I do not think you need be uneasy , my dear , ”
71751	71793	71795	71795	she	128	“ Your brother is convinced that it will be the greatest pleasure and comfort to Mr. Clare to have you ; and though there may be difficulties at first , I am sure anybody must be the happier for having you , ”
71810	71864	71795	71795	she	128	“ Alick is no judge ! He is the child of the house , and my uncle and Mr. Lifford do n’t feel complete without him . My uncle is as fond of me as can be , and he and I could get on beautifully , but then Mr. Lifford is impracticable . ”
71865	71868	71870	71870	Rachel	128	“ Impracticable ? ”
71878	71895	71870	71870	Rachel	128	“ He objects to your exerting yourself in the parish . I know what that is . ”
71896	71901	71903	71903	Fanny	127	“ Pray , Rachel , ”
71907	71931	71903	71903	Fanny	127	“ pray do n’t any anything against him ! I am very sorry he has annoyed you , but I do like him . ”
71932	71940	71942	71942	Bessie	204	“ Oh , does he play croquet ! ”
71944	71948	71950	71950	Rachel	128	“ I gather , ”
71961	71974	71950	71950	Rachel	128	“ that by impracticable you mean one who will not play croquet . ”
71975	71981	71983	71983	Bessie	204	“ You have hit it ! ”
71985	72048	71983	71983	Bessie	204	“ Who will neither play at croquet , nor let one work except in his way . Well , there are hopes for you . I cure the curates of every cure I come near , except , of course , the cure that touches me most nearly . The shoemaker ’s wife goes the worst shod ! I ’ll tame yours . ”
72049	72064	71950	71950	Rachel	128	“ My dear , I ca n’t have poor Mr. Touchett made game of . ”
72065	72085	71983	71983	Bessie	204	“ I wo n’t make game of him , dear Lady Temple , only make him play a game . ”
72086	72095	72097	72097	Fanny	127	“ But you said Alick did not approve , ”
72119	72122	71983	71983	Bessie	204	“ Punch . ”
72123	72184	71983	71983	Bessie	204	“ Oh , that ’s fudge on Master Alick ’s part ! Just the remains of his old miseries , poor fellow . What he wants is love ! Now he ’ll meet his fate some of these days ; and as he ca n’t meet three Englishwomen without a mallet in hand , love and croquet will come together . ”
72185	72191	72194	72195	Lady Temple	138	“ Alick is very good , ”
72211	72322	72194	72195	Lady Temple	138	“ Colonel Hammond gave me such an account of him , so valuable and excellent among the men , and doing all that is possible for their welfare , interesting himself about their library , and the regimental school and all . The colonel said he wished only that he was a little more easy and popular among the young officers ; but so many of his own standing were gone by the time he joined again , that he lives almost too much to himself , reads a good deal , and is most exemplary , but does not quite make his influence as available as it might be . ”
72323	72329	72331	72331	Bessie	204	“ That ’s just it , ”
72335	72428	72331	72331	Bessie	204	“ the boy is a lazy boy , and wants shaking up , or he ’ll get savage and no good . Ca n’t you see , by the way he uses his poor little sister , what an awful don Captain Keith must be to a schoolboy of an ensign ? He must be taught toleration and hunted into amiability , or he ’ll be the most terrible Turk by the time he is a colonel ; and you are the only person that can do it , dear Lady Temple . ”
72765	72776	72796	72796	she	204	“ Have you seen the young lady with Lady Temple ? ”
73487	73494	73496	73496	Rachel	128	“ He has hurt his foot ! ”
73498	73519	73496	73496	Rachel	128	“ I must go down after him . Yes , Don , yes , poor fellow , I ’m coming . ”
73520	73532	73496	73496	Rachel	128	“ My dear Curtia , do n’t leap into the gulf ! ”
73533	73552	73496	73496	Rachel	128	“ Oh , it ’s no great height , and the tide will soon fill up this place . ”
73553	73570	73496	73496	Rachel	128	“ Do n’t ! do n’t ! You ’ll never be able to get up again . ”
73692	73713	73735	73735	Bessie	204	“ My dear Rachel , you will only break your neck , too , it is quite vain to try ! ”
73714	73734	73735	73735	Bessie	204	“ If you could just come to that first rock , perhaps I could push him up to you ! ”
73743	73795	73735	73735	Bessie	204	“ Oh , I ’m not steady ; I could n’t do it ! Besides , it would hurt him so , and I know you would fall . Poor fellow , it is very sad ; but indeed , Rachel , your life is more precious than a dog ’s ! ”
73796	73805	73807	73807	Rachel	128	“ I ca n’t leave him to drown , ”
73819	73851	73853	73853	he	2050	“ Here , if you could only get him by the scrough of his neck , it would not hurt him so much ; poor Don , yes , poor fellow ! ”
73901	73904	73905	73905	she	204	“ Indeed , ”
73908	73931	73905	73905	she	204	“ I had better run and call some one ; I wo n’t be long , and you are really quite safe . ”
73932	73955	73889	73889	she	204	“ Yes , quite safe . If you were down here and I above I am sure he could do it easily . ”
73956	73971	73905	73905	she	204	“ Ah ! but I ’m no cragswoman ; I ’ll be back instantly . ”
73972	73988	73990	73990	Rachel	128	“ That way , that ’s the shortest , call to Zack or his father , ”
75074	75082	75084	75084	Bessie	204	“ Once again , that landscape painter ! ”
75103	75109	75096	75097	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ an adventure at last . ”
75110	75115	75117	75117	Rachel	128	“ Not at all , ”
75121	75129	75117	75117	Rachel	128	“ there was neither alarm nor danger . ”
75130	75164	75096	75097	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Precisely ; the romance minus the disagreeables . Only the sea monster wanting . Young Alcides , and rock — you stood there for sacrifice , I was the weeping Dardanian dames . ”
75186	75207	75209	75209	Rachel	128	“ Now , Bessie , I entreat that you will not make a ridiculous story of a most simple affair , ”
75211	75229	75209	75209	Rachel	128	“ I promise not to make one , but do n’t blame me if it makes itself . ”
75230	75243	75117	75117	Rachel	128	“ It can not , unless some of us tell the story . ”
75244	75270	75096	75097	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ What , do you expect the young Alcides to hold his tongue ? That is more than can be hoped of mortal landscape painter . ”
75271	75289	75209	75209	Rachel	128	“ I wish you would not call him so . I am sure he is a clergyman . ”
75290	75302	75117	75117	Rachel	128	“ Landscape painter , I would lay you anything you please . ”
75303	75306	75308	75308	Grace	127	“ Nay , ”
75310	75325	75308	75308	Grace	127	“ according to you , that is just what he ought not to be . ”
75326	75337	75339	75339	Rachel	128	“ I do not understand what diverts you so much , ”
75347	75357	75339	75339	Rachel	128	“ What matters it what the man may be ? ”
75358	75368	75370	75370	Bessie	204	“ That is exactly what we want to see , ”
75491	75494	75496	75496	Rachel	128	“ Yes , ”
75500	75668	75496	75496	Rachel	128	“ I see now what Captain Keith regrets . His sister , with all her fine powers and abilities , has had her tone lowered to the hateful conventional style of wit that would put me to the blush for the smallest mishap . I hope he will not come over till it is forgotten , for the very sight of his disapproval would incite her further . I am glad the Colonel is not here . Here , of course , he is in my imagination . Why should I be referring everything to him ; I , who used to be so independent ? Suppose this nonsense gave him umbrage ? Let it . I might then have light thrown on his feelings and my own . At any rate , I will not be conscious . If this stranger be really worth notice , as I think he is , I will trample on her ridicule , and show how little I esteem it . ”
75753	75762	75773	75773	Richard	279	“ Rd . R. H. C. L. Mauleverer ; ”
75934	75944	75946	75946	Grace	127	“ Oh , Rachel , I am very sorry , ”
75948	75954	75946	75946	Grace	127	“ Sorry , what for ? ”
75955	75968	75900	75901	Mr. Villars	281	“ Why , you and mamma seemed quite inclined to like him . ”
75969	75978	75946	75946	Grace	127	“ Well , and what have we heard ? ”
75979	75988	75990	75990	Grace	127	“ Not much that is rational , certainly , ”
75994	76002	75990	75990	Grace	127	“ but we know what was meant . ”
76003	76139	75946	75946	Grace	127	“ Granting that we do , what is proved against him ? No , I will not say proved , but alleged . He is one of the many who have thought for themselves upon the perplexing problems of faith and practice , and has been sincere , uncompromising , self - sacrificing , in avowing that his mind is still in that state of solution in which all earnest and original minds must be ere the crystallizing process sets in . Observe , Grace , I am not saying for an instant that he is in the right . All I do say is , that when depth of thought and candour have brought misfortune upon a man , it is ungenerous , therefore , to treat him as if he had the leprosy . ”
76140	76159	75990	75990	Grace	127	“ Indeed , Rachel , I think you have made more out of his opinions than I did . ”
76160	76172	75990	75990	Grace	127	“ I was only arguing on your construction of his opinions . ”
76173	76178	75990	75990	Grace	127	“ Take care — ! ”
76243	76253	76237	76237	his	258	“ Then I conclude there is nothing the matter ? ”
76254	76259	76261	76261	Grace	127	“ Nothing at all , ”
76263	76269	76285	76285	he	258	“ What did you hear ? ”
76270	76283	76285	76285	he	258	“ Only a little drowning , and a compound fracture or two , ”
76309	76316	76318	76318	Rachel	128	“ There , how very annoying ! ”
76320	76332	76318	76318	Rachel	128	“ though , of course , the smallest adventure does travel . ”
76333	76375	76383	76383	Rachel	128	“ I may venture to hope that neither are you drowned , nor my sister ’s leg broken , nor a celebrated professor and essayist ‘ in a high fever wi ’ pulling any of you out of the sea . ’ ”
76376	76381	76383	76383	Rachel	128	“ There , Grace , ”
76385	76394	76383	76383	Rachel	128	“ I told you he was something distinguished . ”
76395	76413	76383	76383	Rachel	128	“ My dear Rachel , if his celebrity be in proportion to the rest of the story . ”
76414	76422	76424	76425	Captain Keith	258	“ Then there really was a rescue ! ”
76451	76507	76435	76435	Rachel	128	“ There was no danger , only Don slipped down into that curved cove where we walked one day with the boys . I went down after him , but he had broken his leg . I could not get up with him in my arms , and Bessie called some one to help me . ”
76508	76518	76437	76437	her	128	“ And why could not Bessie help you herself ? ”
76519	76534	76435	76435	Rachel	128	“ Oh ! strangers can never climb on our slippery rocks as we can . ”
76535	76545	76550	76550	himself	1729	“ Moreover , it would have spoilt the predicament , ”
76559	76567	76550	76550	himself	1729	“ And is the child behaving herself ? ”
76592	76595	76596	76596	he	1729	“ Ah ! ”
76618	76631	76596	76596	he	1729	“ I knew she always did better when I was not there . ”
76694	76796	76797	76797	Alick	125	“ Oh , I am so glad to see you ; Don is so much better , Rachel , and Conrade wants to thank you . He went up yesterday , and was so sorry you were out . Might it not have been dreadful , Alick ? I have been so wanting to tell you how very delightful that dear sister of yours is . All the boys are distracted about her . Come out please . She has been teaching the boys such a delightful game ; so much nicer than cricket , for I can play with them . ”
76858	76866	76868	76869	innocent Grace	127	“ And you really are learning croquet ! ”
76871	76880	76868	76869	innocent Grace	127	“ well , it makes a beautiful ground . ”
76881	76884	76886	76888	poor Lady Temple	138	“ Croquet ! ”
76894	76910	76886	76888	poor Lady Temple	138	“ you do n’t really mean that it is croquet ! O Bessie , Bessie ! ”
76911	76925	76933	76933	she	138	“ Ah ! I did n’t mean you to have come so soon , ”
76940	76974	76933	76933	she	138	“ I meant the prejudice to be first conquered . See , dear Lady Temple , I ’m not ashamed ; this whitey brown moustache is going to kiss me nevertheless and notwithstanding . ”
77027	77046	77021	77021	mamma	162	“ Not now , my dears — I must — I must . Indeed I did not know . ”
77047	77058	77060	77060	Bessie	204	“ Now , Alick , I trust to your generosity , ”
77069	77093	77060	77060	Bessie	204	“ Coming , Con — Come , Grace , come and convince Lady Temple that the pastime is not too wicked for you . ”
77094	77099	77100	77101	Lady Temple	138	“ Indeed , Alick , ”
77105	77125	77100	77101	Lady Temple	138	“ I am very sorry , I wo n’t allow it one moment if you think it is objectionable . ”
77126	77132	77134	77134	Alick	125	“ But I do n’t , ”
77138	77154	77134	77134	Alick	125	“ Far from it . It is a capital game for you and your boys . ”
77155	77169	77171	77172	Lady Temple	138	“ I thought — I thought you disapproved and could not bear it , ”
77178	77188	77171	77172	Lady Temple	138	“ Ca n’t bear is not disapprove . Indeed , ”
77198	77232	77191	77192	gentle earnest	283	“ there is no harm in the game itself . It is a wholly personal distaste , arising from my having been bored with it when I was ill and out of spirits . ”
77233	77246	77247	77247	she	138	“ But is not there something about it in ‘ Punch ? ’ ”
77284	77365	77281	77281	he	125	“ Certainly there is about its abuse as an engine for flirtation , which , to tell you the truth , was what sickened me with the sight at Littleworthy ; but that is not the line Con and Francie will take just yet . Why , my uncle is specially addicted to listening to croquet , and knows by the step and sound how each player is getting on , till he is quite an oracle in disputed hits . ”
77366	77372	77374	77374	Fanny	127	“ So Bessie told me , ”
77390	77407	77281	77281	he	125	“ but I ca n’t think how she could , when you do n’t like it . ”
77408	77417	77419	77419	Alick	125	“ Nobody is bound to respect foolish prejudices , ”
77426	77438	77419	77419	Alick	125	“ It would have been very absurd not to introduce it . ”
77439	77444	77446	77446	Bessie	204	“ Come , Alick , ”
77450	77480	77446	77446	Bessie	204	“ have you absolved her , and may we begin ? Would it not be a generous act of amnesty if all the present company united in a match ? ”
77481	77485	77487	77487	Alick	125	“ Too many , ”
77489	77519	77487	77487	Alick	125	“ odd numbers . I shall go down and call on Miss Williams . May I come back , Lady Temple , and have a holiday from the mess ? ”
77520	77536	77446	77446	Bessie	204	“ I shall be very glad ; only I am afraid there is no dinner . ”
77537	77563	77446	77446	Bessie	204	“ So much the better . Only let me see you begin , or I shall never dare to express an opinion for the future . ”
77564	77580	77582	77582	Conrade	126	“ Mamma , do pray , pray begin ; the afternoon is wasting like nothing ! ”
77590	77595	77596	77596	he	126	“ And Aunt Rachel , ”
77603	77616	77596	77596	he	126	“ you shall be my partner , and I ’ll teach you . ”
77617	77637	77639	77639	Rachel	128	“ Thank you , Conrade , but I ca n’t ; I promised to be at home at four , ”
77712	77731	77732	77732	she	127	“ You heard , Alick , of the interesting individual who acted the part of Rachel ’s preserver , ”
77771	77776	77778	77778	Alick	125	“ I came here , ”
77782	77795	77778	77778	Alick	125	“ to assist in recovering the beloved remains from a watery grave ; ”
77852	77865	77867	77867	Bessie	204	“ And he is at this moment sketching the Spinster ’s Needles ! ”
77869	77914	77867	77867	Bessie	204	“ Well , I am consoled . With all your resolve to flatten down an adventure , fate is too strong for you . Something will come of it . Is not the very resolve that it shall not be an adventure a token ? ”
77915	77934	77936	77936	Alick	125	“ If any one should wish to forget it , it is you , I think , Bessie , ”
77938	77958	77936	77936	Alick	125	“ Your admirable sagacity seems to have been at fault . I thought you prided yourself on your climbing . ”
77959	77965	77867	77867	Bessie	204	“ Up a slippery perpendicular — ”
77966	77972	77973	77973	he	125	“ I know the place , ”
77977	77980	77982	77982	Bessie	204	“ Well , ”
77987	78059	77982	77982	Bessie	204	“ I am not a mermaid nor even a dear gazelle , and , in my humble opinion , there was far more grace in preventing heroism from being ‘ unwept , unnoticed , and unsung , ’ than in perilling my own neck , craning down and strangling the miserable beast , by pulling him up by the scrough of his neck ! What an introduction would have been lost ! ”
78060	78070	78072	78073	her brother	1120	“ If you are going to play , Bessie , ”
78075	78087	78072	78073	her brother	1120	“ it would be kind to take pity upon those boys . ”
78088	78094	78095	78095	she	204	“ One achievement is mine , ”
78110	78120	78102	78102	her	204	“ the great Alexander has bidden me to croquet . ”
78121	78126	78128	78129	her brother	1120	“ I am afraid , ”
78138	78158	78128	78129	her brother	1120	“ that it was all her fault . Pray be patient with her , she has had many disadvantages . ”
78192	78203	78186	78186	she	128	“ Oh , never mind , it did not signify . ”
78219	78221	78214	78215	the boys	626	“ aunts ”
78284	78304	78305	78305	she	2138	“ I promised to write a letter for my mother on business before post time . The Burnaby bargain , ”
78313	78321	78323	78323	Bessie	204	“ A business - like transaction indeed ! ”
78331	78344	78346	78346	Rachel	128	“ Only a bit of land in trust for apprenticing poor children , ”
78348	78444	78346	78346	Rachel	128	“ It was left by a Curtis many generations ago , in trust to the rector of the parish and the lord of the manor ; and poor Mr. Linton is so entirely effete , that it is virtually in our hands . It is one of the vexations of my life that more good can not be done with it , for the fees are too small for superior tradespeople , and we can only bind them to the misery of lacemaking . The system belongs to a worn - out state of things . ”
78600	78604	78606	78606	she	204	“ Poor Alick , ”
78628	78645	78648	78648	she	204	“ he did think he had one lawn in the world undefiled by those horrible hoops ! ”
78657	78686	78648	78648	she	204	“ but it was so exactly what they wanted here . It is so good for Lady Temple and her boys to have something they can do together . ”
78694	78706	78707	78707	he	126	“ I object to nothing but its being for her good , ”
78711	78728	78707	78707	he	126	“ But now , does not it make her very happy , and suit her excellently ? ”
78729	78744	78818	78818	she	204	“ May be so , but that is not the reason you introduced it . ”
78745	78773	78775	78775	she	204	“ You have a shocking habit of driving one up into corners , Alick , but it shall be purely , purely for my own selfish delight , ”
78813	78817	78818	78818	she	204	“ if only , ”
78821	78852	78818	78818	she	204	“ you wo n’t let it banish you . You must come over to take care of this wicked little sister , or who knows what may be the consequences . ”
78853	78888	78889	78889	he	126	“ I kept away partly because I was busy , and partly because I believe you are such a little ape as always to behave worse when you have the semblance of a keeper ; ”
78903	78918	78889	78889	he	126	“ And in the mean time fell out the adventure of the distinguished essayist . ”
78919	78924	78925	78925	he	126	“ I am afraid , ”
78928	78951	78925	78925	he	126	“ that was a gratuitous piece of mischief , particularly annoying to so serious and thoughtful a person as Miss Rachel Curtis . ”
78952	78955	78957	78957	Bessie	204	“ Jealousy ? ”
78963	78984	78957	78957	Bessie	204	“ You see what you lost by not trusting me , to behave myself under the provocation of your presence . ”
78985	78998	78925	78925	he	126	“ What ! the pleasure of boxing your ears for a coward ? ”
78999	79017	79018	79018	she	204	“ Of seizing the happy opening ! I am very much afraid for you now , Alick , ”
79024	79071	79018	79018	she	204	“ What hope can a poor Captain of Highlanders , even if he does happen to be a wounded hero or two , have against a distinguished essayist and landscape painter ; if it were a common case indeed , but where Wisdom herself is concerned — ”
79072	79079	79081	79081	Alick	125	“ Military frivolity can not hope , ”
79101	79107	79087	79087	his	125	“ Ah , poor Alick , ”
79112	79172	79087	79087	his	125	“ you always were a discreet youth ; but to be connected with such a union of learning , social science , and homeaopathy , soared beyond my utmost ambition . I suppose the wedding tour — supposing the happy event to take place — will be through a series of model schools and hospitals , ending in Hanwell . ”
79173	79176	79178	79178	Alick	125	“ No , ”
79183	79195	79178	79178	Alick	125	“ to the Dutch reformatory , and the Swiss cretin asylum . ”
79212	79275	79196	79196	She	5961	“ I am glad you have revealed the secrets of your breast . I saw there was a powerful attraction and that you were no longer your own , but my views were humbler . I thought the profound respect with which you breathed the name of Avonmouth , was due to the revival of the old predilection for our sweet little — ”
79276	79281	79283	79284	her brother	1120	“ Hush , Bessie , ”
79294	79320	79283	79284	her brother	1120	“ this is more than nonsense . One word more of this , and you will cut me off from my greatest rest and pleasure . ”
79321	79331	79357	79357	He	1120	“ From the lawn where croquet waits his approbation , ”
79374	79475	79357	79357	He	1120	“ Remember , I never met her from seven years old till after her marriage . She has been the kindest of friends in right of our fathers ’ old friendship . You know how her mother nursed me , and the sister she was to me . And Bessie , if your selfishness — I wish I could call it thoughtlessness — involves her innocent simplicity in any scrape , derogatory to what is becoming her situation , I shall find it very hard to forgive you , and harder still to forgive myself for letting you come here . ”
79492	79505	79506	79506	she	204	“ There , you have given your wicked little sister a screed , ”
79515	79591	79506	79506	she	204	“ Just as if I did not think her a darling , and would not for the world do anything to spoil her . Have not I been leading the most exemplary life , talking systems and visiting cottages with Rachel and playing with the boys , and singing with the clergyman ; and here am I pounced on , as if I were come to be the serpent in this anti - croquet paradise . ”
79592	79599	79357	79357	He	1120	“ Only a warning , Bessie . ”
79600	79629	79506	79506	she	204	“ You ’ll be better now you have had it out . I ’ve seen you suppressing it all this time , for fear of frightening me away . ”
79816	79833	79811	79812	Miss Keith	244	“ Did you ever play at croquet ? do come , and we will teach you , ”
81046	81051	81055	81055	her	128	“ that landscape painter , ”
81059	81069	81055	81055	her	128	“ you did not mean to object , mother ? ”
81070	81085	81055	81055	her	128	“ Oh , not for a moment , pray do n’t think of it , ”
81093	81141	81055	81055	her	128	“ I would not think of the intrusion . It is only that these poor trifles are steps to one of the few means by which I can still hope to do even a little for my fellow creatures ; the greatest solace that remains to me . ”
81142	81152	81154	81154	Rachel	128	“ My mother did not mean to prevent anything , ”
81157	81167	81154	81154	Rachel	128	“ least of all any means of doing good . ”
81168	81199	81055	81055	her	128	“ Indeed , I can not but be aware that Miss Curtis is the last individual who would do so , except indeed by the good works she herself absorbs . ”
81200	81208	81154	81154	Rachel	128	“ You are too good , sir , ”
81213	81294	81210	81211	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ I am sure I did not mean to object to anything for good . If it is for a charity , I am sure some of our friends would be very glad to take some sketches of our scenery ; they have been begging me this long time to have it photographed . I should like to have that drawing myself , it would please your aunt so much , my dear , if we sent it to her . ”
81374	81388	81389	81389	Rachel	128	“ which would be quite another thing , you know , my dear . ”
81419	81456	81396	81407	the artist , who was sketching in full view from the windows	2210	“ Perhaps , but I do n’t know , my dear . Wo n’t it be odd ? Had you not better wait till Grace comes in , or till I can come down with you ? ”
81457	81478	81480	81480	Rachel	128	“ No need at all , mother , I can do it much better alone , and at my age — ”
81573	81576	81578	81578	Rachel	128	“ Ah ! ”
81597	81619	81578	81578	Rachel	128	“ I heard you had been interesting yourself about Mrs Kelland ’s lace school . What a miserable system it is ! ”
81620	81635	81578	81578	Rachel	128	“ My inquiries have betrayed me then ? It is indeed a trying spectacle . ”
81636	81645	81647	81647	Rachel	128	“ And to be helpless to alleviate it , ”
81649	81689	81647	81647	Rachel	128	“ Over work , low prices and middle - men perfectly batten on the lives of our poor girls here . I have thought it over again and again , and it is a constant burden on my mind . ”
81690	81713	81578	81578	Rachel	128	“ Yes , indeed . The effects of modern civilization are a constant burden on the compassion of every highly constituted nature . ”
81714	81728	81730	81730	Rachel	128	“ The only means that seems to me likely to mitigate the evil , ”
81747	81797	81730	81730	Rachel	128	“ would be to commence an establishment where some fresh trades might be taught , so as to lessen the glut of the market , and to remove the workers that are forced to undersell one another , and thus oblige the buyers to give a fairly remunerative price . ”
81798	81829	81647	81647	Rachel	128	“ Precisely my own views . To commence an establishment that would drain off the superfluous labour , and relieve the oppressed , raising the whole tone of female employment . ”
81830	81839	81730	81730	Rachel	128	“ And this is the project you meant ? ”
81840	81870	81730	81730	Rachel	128	“ And in which , for the first time , I begin to hope for success , if it can only receive the patronage of some person of influence . ”
81871	81879	81881	81881	Rachel	128	“ Oh , anything I can do ! ”
81886	81931	81881	81881	Rachel	128	“ It is the very thing I have been longing for for years . What , you would form a sort of industrial school , where the children could be taught some remunerative labour , and it might soon be almost self - supporting ? ”
81932	81955	81730	81730	Rachel	128	“ Exactly ; the first establishment is the difficulty , for which I have been endeavouring to put a few mites together . ”
81956	81966	81968	81968	Rachel	128	“ Every one would subscribe for such a purpose ! ”
81970	81991	81730	81730	Rachel	128	“ You speak from your own generous nature , Miss Curtis ; but the world would require patronesses to recommend . ”
81992	82001	82003	82003	Rachel	128	“ There could be no difficulty about that ! ”
82083	82087	82089	82090	her mother	496	“ My dear , ”
82096	82115	82089	82090	her mother	496	“ how long you have been ; and what am I to give for the water - colour ? ”
82116	82193	82089	82090	her mother	496	“ Oh , I forgot all about the water - colour ; but never mind what we give , mamma , it is all to go to an asylum for educating poor girls , and giving them some resource beyond that weary lace - making — the very thing I have always longed for . He is coming to settle it all with me to - morrow , and then we will arrange what to give . ”
82194	82240	82089	82090	her mother	496	“ Indeed , my dear , I hope it will be something well managed . I think if it were not for those middle - men , lace - making would not be so bad . But you must not keep poor Miss Williams waiting . ”
82311	82324	82302	82302	Ermine	186	“ Captain Keith , heard he was a distinguished professor and essayist . ”
82325	82336	82338	82338	Ermine	186	“ Then I wonder we have not heard his name , ”
82340	82360	82338	82338	Ermine	186	“ It is a remarkable one ; one might look in the ‘ Clergy List ’ at Villars ’s . ”
82361	82369	82371	82371	Rachel	128	“ Villars called him a clerical gentleman , ”
82373	82392	82371	82371	Rachel	128	“ Then you would be sure to be able to find out something about him before committing yourself . ”
82393	82401	82403	82403	Rachel	128	“ I can see what he is , ”
82405	82437	82403	82403	Rachel	128	“ a very sensible , accomplished man , and a great deal more ; not exactly a finished gentleman . But that is no objection to his doing a great work . ”
82438	82443	82445	82445	Ermine	186	“ None at all , ”
82449	82484	82445	82445	Ermine	186	“ but please forgive me . We have suffered so much from trusting too implicitly , that I never can think it safe to be satisfied without thorough knowledge of a person ’s antecedents . ”
82485	82489	82491	82491	Rachel	128	“ Of course , ”
82493	82532	82491	82491	Rachel	128	“ I shall do nothing without inquiry . I will find out all about him , but I can not see any opening for distrust . Schemes of charity are not compatible with self - seeking and dishonesty . ”
82533	82543	82445	82445	Ermine	186	“ But did I not hear something about opinions ? ”
82544	82608	82445	82445	Ermine	186	“ Oh , as to that , it was only Villars . Besides , you are a clergyman ’s daughter , and your views have a different colouring from mine . Modern research has introduced so many variations of thought , that no good work would be done at all if we required of our fellow - labourers perfect similarity of speculative belief . ”
82609	82618	82491	82491	Rachel	128	“ Yet suppose he undertook to teach others ? ”
82619	82649	82445	82445	Ermine	186	“ The simple outlines of universal doctrine and morality which are required by poor children are not affected by the variations to which investigation conducts minds of more scope . ”
82650	82662	82445	82445	Ermine	186	“ I am afraid such variations may often reach the foundation . ”
82663	82713	82491	82491	Rachel	128	“ Now , Miss Williams , I am sure you must often have heard it observed how when it comes to real practical simple teaching of uninstructed people , villagers or may be heathens , the details of party difference melt away , and people find themselves in accordance . ”
82714	82791	82445	82445	Ermine	186	“ True , but there I think party differences in the Church , and even the variations between Christian sects are concerned , both being different ways of viewing the same truth . These may , like the knights in the old fable , find that both were right about the shield , both have the same foundation . But where the foundation is not the same , the results of the teaching will not agree . ”
82792	82800	82445	82445	Ermine	186	“ Every one agrees as to morality . ”
82801	82841	82491	82491	Rachel	128	“ Yes , but do all give a motive sufficient to enforce the self - denial that morality entails ? Nay , do they show the way to the spiritual strength needful to the very power of being moral ? ”
82842	82913	82445	82445	Ermine	186	“ That is begging the question . The full argument is whether the full church , say Christian system , exactly as you , as we hold it , is needful to the perfection of moral observance . I do n’t say whether I assent , but the present question is whether the child ’s present belief and practice need be affected by its teacher ’s dogmatic or undogmatic system . ”
82914	82931	82491	82491	Rachel	128	“ The system for life is generally formed in childhood . Harvest depends on seed time . ”
82932	82937	82939	82939	Rachel	128	“ And after all , ”
82941	82971	82939	82939	Rachel	128	“ we have no notion whether this poor man be not precisely of your own opinions , and from their fruits I am sure you ought to claim them . ”
82972	82979	82981	82981	Ermine	186	“ Their blossoms if you please , ”
82983	82992	82981	82981	Ermine	186	“ We have not seen their fruits yet . ”
82993	83010	83012	83012	Rachel	128	“ And I shall take care the fruits are not nipped with the blight of suspicion , ”
83064	83068	83057	83057	she	128	“ Clergy List . ”
83295	83303	83265	83266	the butler	2232	“ Mr. Mauleverer to see Miss Rachel . ”
83310	83321	83306	83307	Miss Rachel	128	“ You ’ll excuse me , it is on business ; ”
83328	83331	83306	83307	Miss Rachel	128	“ the mother ”
83396	83418	83419	83419	he	2234	“ You were doing me the honour to look for my name in the ‘ Clergy List , ’ Miss Curtis , ”
83422	83430	83432	83432	Rachel	128	“ Yes , one is apt — , ”
83439	83494	83432	83432	Rachel	128	“ I quite appreciate the motive . It is exactly in accord with Miss Curtis ’s prudence and good sense . I should wish to be fully explicit before any arrangements are made . I am unhappily not in orders , Miss Curtis . I know your liberality will regard the cause with leniency . ”
83495	83498	83500	83500	Rachel	128	“ Indeed , ”
83512	83539	83500	83500	Rachel	128	“ I can fully appreciate any reluctance to become stringently bound to dogmatic enunciations , before the full powers of the intellect have examined into them . ”
83540	83578	83432	83432	Rachel	128	“ You have expressed it exactly , Miss Curtis . Without denying an iota of them , I may be allowed to regret that our formularies are too technical for a thoughtful mind in the present age . ”
83579	83586	83588	83588	Rachel	128	“ Many have found it so , ”
83592	83619	83588	83588	Rachel	128	“ who only needed patience to permit their convictions to ripen . Then I understand you , it was a rejection on negative not positive grounds ? ”
83620	83638	83432	83432	Rachel	128	“ Precisely ; I do not murmur , but it has been the blight of my life . ”
83639	83643	83645	83645	Rachel	128	“ And yet , ”
83649	83660	83645	83645	Rachel	128	“ it may enable you to work with more freedom . ”
83661	83686	83432	83432	Rachel	128	“ Since you encourage me to believe so , Miss Curtis , I will hope it , but I have met with much suspicion . ”
83687	83694	83696	83696	Rachel	128	“ I can well believe it , ”
83698	83752	83696	83696	Rachel	128	“ even some of the most superior persons refuse to lay their hands to any task unless they are certified of the religious opinions of their coadjutors , which seems to me like a mason ’s refusing to work at a wall with a man who liked Greek architecture when he preferred Gothic ! ”
84511	84519	84521	84521	she	128	“ the good time coming at last . ”
84563	84568	84554	84555	Bessie Keith	204	“ that landscape painter , ”
84712	84715	84717	84717	Fanny	127	“ Oh ! ”
84727	84754	84720	84720	her	127	“ I am so sorry you think so ; Rachel wished it so much , and it seems such a nice thing for the poor children . ”
84755	84758	84760	84761	Mr. Touchett	145	“ Indeed , ”
84770	84805	84760	84761	Mr. Touchett	145	“ I am quite sensible of the kindness of all you do , I only ventured to wish there had been a little more delay , that we were more certain about this person . ”
84806	84824	84826	84826	Fanny	127	“ When Colonel Keith comes back he will find out all about him , I am sure , ”
85298	85306	85307	85307	he	1120	“ Is that what you are after ? ”
85310	85347	85307	85307	he	1120	“ Indeed , Alick , I thought it was the greatest kindness I could do her ; she is so very eager about this plan , and so anxious to find poor Meg a good home . ”
85348	85354	85295	85295	his	1120	“ Purely to oblige her ? ”
85355	85405	85295	85295	his	1120	“ Of course , Alick , it was much more convenient to her than if she had had to send about to horse - dealers or to advertise . I doubt if she could have done it at all ; and it is for her asylum , you know . ”
85406	85417	85307	85307	he	1120	“ Then give the coachman ’s sixty guineas at once . ”
85418	85428	85430	85430	she	2292	“ Ah , Alick , that ’s your infatuation ! ”
85439	85465	85430	85430	she	2292	“ But excuse me , where would be the fine edge of delicacy in giving a manifestly fancy price ? Come and look at her . ”
85466	85475	85295	85295	his	1120	“ I never meddle with horse - dealing . ”
85476	85514	85295	85295	his	1120	“ Stuff , as if you were n’t the best - mounted man in the regiment . I shall send a note to Captain Sykes if you wo n’t ; he knows how to drive a bargain . ”
85515	85568	85430	85430	she	2292	“ And give a fancy price the other way . Well , Bessie , on one condition I ’ll go , and that is , that Meg goes to Bishopsworthy the day she is yours . I wo n’t have her eating Lady Temple ’s corn , and giving her servants trouble . ”
85569	85580	85295	85295	his	1120	“ As if I should think of such a thing . ”
85611	85646	85648	85648	she	204	“ Now seriously , Alick , do you think her worth so much ? Is n’t it a pity , when you know what a humbug poor Rachel is going to give it to ? ”
85656	85678	85648	85648	she	204	“ If she were going to throw it into the sea , I do n’t see what difference that would make . ”
85679	85699	85602	85602	Bessie	204	“ Ah ! you are far too much interested . Nothing belonging to her can bear a vulgar price . ”
85700	85715	85717	85717	Alick	125	“ Nothing belonging to me is to gain profit by her self - denial , ”
85721	85745	85717	85717	Alick	125	“ You can not do less than give her what she gave for it , if you enter on the transaction at all . ”
85746	85771	85772	85772	she	204	“ You mean that it would look shabby . You see we womankind never quite know the code of the world on such matters , ”
85777	85788	85789	85789	he	125	“ There is something that makes codes unnecessary , Bessie , ”
85792	85833	85789	85789	he	125	“ Ah ! I can make allowances . It is a cruel stroke . I do n’t wonder you ca n’t bear to see any one else on her palfrey ; above all as a sacrifice to the landscape painter . ”
85834	85847	85849	85849	Alick	125	“ Then spare my feelings , and send the mare to Bishopsworthy , ”
85882	85887	85888	85888	she	204	“ To be sure , ”
85891	85927	85888	85888	she	204	“ it is past concealment now . You must have been very far gone , indeed , to have been taken in to suppose me to be making capital of her ‘ charitable purposes . ’ ”
85928	85936	85937	85937	he	125	“ Your acting is too like life , ”
85958	86011	85947	85947	she	204	“ Is it the long words , Alick , or is it ‘ the great eyes , my dear ; ’ or is it — oh , yes , I know what is the great attraction — that the Homestead does n’t possess a single spot where one could play at croquet ! ”
86012	86016	86018	86018	Alick	125	“ Quite irresistible ! ”
86111	86124	86085	86086	Lady Temple	138	“ So , Alick , your feelings must endure the dreadful spectacle . ”
86136	86141	86156	86156	she	128	“ Christian Knowledge Society . ”
86204	86208	86210	86210	Alick	125	“ And pray , ”
86222	86235	86210	86210	Alick	125	“ how do you reconcile yourself to the temptation to the postmen ? ”
86236	86247	86188	86188	she	128	“ They do n’t see what my letters are about ? ”
86248	86298	86188	86188	she	128	“ They must be dull postmen if they do n’t remark on the shower of envelopes that pass through their hands — ominous money - letters , all with the same address , and no detection remember . You do n’t know who will answer and who will not . ”
86299	86306	86308	86308	Rachel	128	“ I never thought of that , ”
86310	86324	86308	86308	Rachel	128	“ but risks must be run when any great purpose is in hand . ”
86325	86343	86345	86346	Captain Keith	258	“ The corruption of one postman versus the rescue of — how many children make a postman ? ”
86355	86363	86365	86365	Grace	127	“ The postman would be corrupt already , ”
86389	86395	86397	86398	Captain Keith	258	“ There is another objection , ”
86407	86444	86401	86401	he	258	“ Have you considered how you are frightening people out of the society ? It is enough to make one only subscribe as Michael Miserly or as Simon Skinflint , or something equally uninviting to applications . ”
86445	86456	86458	86458	Rachel	128	“ I shall ask you to subscribe by both names ! ”
86462	86469	86458	86458	Rachel	128	“ How much for Simon Skinflint ? ”
86470	86484	86401	86401	he	258	“ Ten pounds . Stop — when Mr. Mauleverer gives him a reference . ”
86485	86498	86401	86401	he	258	“ That ’s ungenerous . Will Michael Miserly make up for it ? ”
86499	86512	86458	86458	Rachel	128	“ Yes , when the first year ’s accounts have been audited . ”
86513	86531	86401	86401	he	258	“ Ah ! those who have no faith to make a venture can never effect any good . ”
86532	86562	86401	86401	he	258	“ You evidently build on a great amount of faith from the public . How do you induce them to believe — do you write in your own name ? ”
86563	86607	86458	86458	Rachel	128	“ No , it makes mamma unhappy . I was going to put R. C. , but Grace said people would think it meant Roman Catholic . Your sister thought I had better put the initials of Female Union for Lacemaker ’s Employment . ”
86608	86621	86623	86624	Alick Keith	125	“ You do n’t mean that Bessie persuaded you to put that ? ”
86637	86648	86635	86635	him	125	“ Yes . There is no objection , is there ? ”
86649	86665	86667	86667	Grace	127	“ Oh , Rachel , Rachel , how could we have helped thinking of it ? ”
86701	86721	86676	86676	Rachel	128	“ Miss Curtis , though you are not Scottish , you ought to be well read in Walter Scott . ”
86722	86745	86747	86747	Rachel	128	“ I have thought it waste of time to read incorrect pictures of pseudo - chivalry since I have been grown up , ”
86749	86759	86747	86747	Rachel	128	“ But that has nothing to do with it . ”
86760	86786	86788	86788	Grace	127	“ Ah , Rachel , if we had been more up in our Scotch , we should have known what F. U. L. E. spells , ”
86797	86808	86810	86810	her	128	“ I am sure Bessie never could have recollected it , ”
86814	86818	86819	86819	she	127	“ But there , ”
86831	86856	86819	86819	she	127	“ never mind . It can not be helped , and I dare say not one person in ten will be struck by it . ”
86857	86860	86862	86862	Grace	127	“ Stay , ”
86864	86884	86862	86862	Grace	127	“ let it be Englishwoman ’s Employment . See , I can very easily alter the L into an E. ”
87549	87553	87557	87557	Alison	180	“ Clergy List , ”
88460	88481	88458	88458	Fanny	127	“ she hoped he had found nothing unsatisfactory , the poor man must be so glad to be of use ; ”
88487	88496	88482	88483	Mr. Touchett	145	“ Indeed , it is an unfortunate situation ; ”
88507	88511	88513	88513	Bessie	204	“ Of course , ”
88515	88522	88513	88513	Bessie	204	“ we know by what witchery ! ”

89072	89077	89079	89080	Bessie Keith	204	“ Go and bray , ”
89086	89110	89079	89080	Bessie Keith	204	“ for the sake of the chief of my name , I hope that it is not an omen of his occupations here . ”
89138	89147	89121	89121	Francis	139	“ Colonel Keith never brayed in his life , ”
89190	89198	89200	89200	Conrade	126	“ He is worse than Aunt Rachel , ”
89204	89218	89200	89200	Conrade	126	“ now she has saved Don , and keeps away from the croquet . ”
89577	89580	89582	89582	Conrade	126	“ Then , ”
89584	89610	89582	89582	Conrade	126	“ he must take mamma ’s place , whilst she was being devoured , and how surprised she would be at being so helped on ! ”
89611	89620	89621	89621	he	126	“ Not now , not to - day , ”
89624	89647	89621	89621	he	126	“ I may go to your sister , Ailie ? Yes , boys , you must close up your ranks without me . ”
89648	89652	89654	89654	Hubert	141	“ Then please , ”
89656	89661	89654	89654	Hubert	141	“ take him away , ”
89670	89683	89685	89686	the Colonel	1244	“ Do you find elder brothers so easily disposed of , Hubert ? ”
89688	89698	89685	89686	the Colonel	1244	“ Do you take Conrade away when you please ? ”
89699	89705	89707	89707	Francis	139	“ I should punch him , ”
89709	89714	89707	89707	Francis	139	“ He knows better , ”
89729	89735	89707	89707	Francis	139	“ And I know better , ”
89740	89760	89762	89762	he	207	“ never mind , boys , I ’ll come back in — in reasonable time to carry him off , ”
89768	89776	89778	89778	Bessie	204	“ Surely you wish to go too , ”
89782	89804	89778	89778	Bessie	204	“ if only to relieve them of the little girl ! I ’ll take care of the boys . Pray go . ”
89805	89809	89811	89811	Alison	180	“ Thank you , ”
89823	89842	89811	89811	Alison	180	“ but they are quite hardened to Rose ’s presence , and I think would rather miss her . ”
89953	89955	89973	89974	Colonel Keith	207	“ eehaw ”
90030	90036	90038	90039	Colonel Keith	207	“ Better than I expected ! ”
90055	90078	90038	90039	Colonel Keith	207	“ I knew it was inevitable that she should be here , but that she should depart so fast was beyond hope ! ”
90079	90082	90084	90084	Ermine	186	“ Yes , ”
90088	90152	90084	90084	Ermine	186	“ I woke with such a certainty that she would be here and spend the first half hour in the F. U. E , E. that I wasted a great deal of resignation . But how are you , Colin ? You are much thinner ! I am sure by Mrs. Tibbie ’s account you were much more ill than you told me . ”
90153	90261	90038	90039	Colonel Keith	207	“ Only ill enough to convince me that the need of avoiding a northern winter was not a fallacy , and likewise to make Tibbie insist on coming here for fear Maister Colin should not be looked after . It is rather a responsibility to have let her come , for she has never been farther south than Edinburgh , but she would not be denied . So she has been to see you ! I told her you would help her to find her underlings . I thought it might be an opening for that nice little girl who was so oppressed with lace - making . ”
90262	90320	90084	90084	Ermine	186	“ Ah ! she has gone to learn wood - cutting at the F. U. E. E. ; but I hope we have comfortably provided Tibbie with a damsel . She made us a long visit , and told us all about Master Colin ’s nursery days . Only I am afraid we did not understand half . ”
90321	90326	90328	90329	the Colonel	1244	“ Good old body , ”
90341	90382	90328	90329	the Colonel	1244	“ She was nursery girl when I was the spoilt child of the house , and hers was the most homelike face that met me . I wish she may be happy here . And you are well , Ermine ? ”
90383	90421	90423	90423	her	304	“ Very well , those drives are so pleasant , and Lady Temple so kind ! It is wonderful to think how many unlooked - for delights have come to us ; how good every one is ; ”
90448	90456	90457	90457	she	304	“ And you have brought your brother , ”
90460	90485	90457	90457	she	304	“ you have been too useful to him to be spared . Is he come to look after you or to be looked after ! ”
90486	90494	90496	90497	the Colonel	1244	“ A little of both I fancy , ”
90499	90548	90496	90497	the Colonel	1244	“ but I suspect he is giving me up as a bad job . Ermine , there are ominous revivifications going on at home , and he has got himself rigged out in London , and had his hair cut , so that he looks ten years younger . ”
90549	90559	90457	90457	she	304	“ Do you think he has any special views ! ”
90560	90666	90457	90457	she	304	“ He took such pains to show me the charms of the Benorchie property that I should have thought it would have been Jessie Douglas , the heiress thereof , only coming here does not seem the way to set about it , unless be regards this place as a bath of youth and fashion . I fancy he has learnt enough about my health to make him think me a precarious kind of heir , and that his views are general . I hope he may not be made a fool of , otherwise it is the best thing that could happen to us . ”
90667	90680	90682	90682	Ermine	186	“ It has been a dreary uncomfortable visit , I much fear , ”
90684	90772	90682	90682	Ermine	186	“ Less so than you think . I am glad to have been able to be of use to him , and to have lived on something like brotherly terms . We know and like each other much better than we had a chance of doing before , and we made some pleasant visits together , but at home there are many things on which we can never be of one mind , and I never was well enough at Gowanbrae to think of living there permanently . ”
90773	90788	90457	90457	she	304	“ I was sure you had been very unwell ! You are better though ? ”
90789	90799	90801	90801	he	2451	“ Well , since I came into Avonmouth air , ”
90803	90835	90457	90457	she	304	“ I fear nothing but cold . I am glad to have brought him with me , since he could not stay there , for it is very lonely for him . ”
90836	90847	90457	90457	she	304	“ Yet you said his daughter was settled close by . ”
90848	91097	90457	90457	she	304	“ Yes ; but that makes it the worse . In fact , Ermine , I did not know before what a wretched affair he had made of his daughters ’ marriages . Isabel he married when she was almost a child to this Comyn Menteith , very young too at the time , and who has turned out a good - natured , reckless , dissipated fellow , who is making away with his property as fast as he can , and to whom Keith ’s advice is like water on a duck ’s back . It is all rack and ruin and extravagance , a set of ill - regulated children , and Isabel smiling and looking pretty in the midst of them , and perfectly impervious to remonstrance . He is better out of sight of them , for it is only pain and vexation , an example of the sort of match he likes to make . Mary , the other daughter , was the favourite , and used to her own way , and she took it . Keith was obliged to consent so as to prevent an absolute runaway wedding , but he has by no means forgiven her husband , and they are living on very small means on a Government appointment in Trinidad . I believe it would be the bitterest pill to him that either son - in - law should come in for any part of the estate . ”
91098	91105	90457	90457	she	304	“ I thought it was entailed . ”
91106	91130	90457	90457	she	304	“ Gowanbrae is , but as things stand at present that ends with me , and the other estates are at his disposal . ”
91131	91146	90457	90457	she	304	“ Then it would be very hard on the daughters not to have them . ”
91147	91265	90457	90457	she	304	“ So hard that the death of young Alexander may have been one of the greatest disasters of my life , as well as of poor Keith ’s . However , this is riding out to meet perplexities . He is most likely to outlive me ; and , moreover , may marry and put an end to the difficulty . Meantime , till my charge is relieved , I must go and see after him , and try if I can fulfil Hubert ’s polite request that I would take him away . Rosie , my woman , I have hardly spoken to you . I have some hyacinth roots to bring you to - morrow . ”
91368	91375	91376	91376	she	138	“ Oh , no , no ! ”
91396	91400	91401	91401	she	138	crimson—“Oh , no , ”
91411	91430	91401	91401	she	138	“ It is all well with them as yet . But — but — it ’s your brother . ”
91465	91476	91462	91462	his	207	were—“I am very sorry . I never thought of this . ”
91477	91482	91483	91483	she	138	“ No , indeed , ”
91486	91518	91483	91483	she	138	“ who could ? It was too preposterous to be dreamt of by any one . At his age , too , one would have thought he might have known better . ”
91623	91644	91612	91612	she	138	soft—“Haste ! Yes ! I did think that people would have had some respect for dear , dear Sir Stephen , ”
91676	91683	91684	91684	he	207	“ I am very much concerned , ”
91693	91733	91684	91684	he	207	“ If I could have guessed his intentions , I would have tried to spare you this ; at least the suddenness of it . I could not have guessed at such presumptuous expectations on so short an acquaintance . ”
91734	91745	91747	91747	Fanny	309	“ He did not expect me to answer at once , ”
91749	91802	91804	91804	Fanny	309	“ He said he only meant to let me know his hopes in coming here . And , oh , that ’s the worst of it ! He wo n’t believe me , though I said more to him than I thought I could have said to anybody ! I told him , ”
91818	91870	91871	91871	her	309	“ that I cared for my dear , dear husband , and always shall — always — and then he talked about waiting , just as if anybody could leave off loving one ’s husband ! And then when he wanted me to consider about my children , why then I told him”—and
91875	91940	91941	91941	she	309	again—“the more I considered , the worse it would be for him , as if I would have my boys know me without their father ’s name ; and , besides , he had not been so kind to you that I should wish to let him have anything to do with them ! I am afraid I ought not to have said that , ”
91952	91980	91941	91941	she	309	“ but indeed I was so angry , I did not know what I was about . I hope it will not make him angry with you . ”
91981	91986	91988	91989	Colonel Keith	207	“ Never mind me , ”
91993	92018	91988	91989	Colonel Keith	207	“ Indeed , Lady Temple , it is a wonderful compliment to you that he should have been ready to undertake such a family . ”
92019	92031	92034	92034	her	309	“ I do n’t want such compliments ! And , oh ! ”
92040	92074	92076	92076	she	309	“ what shall I do ? He only said my feelings did me honour , and he would be patient and convince me . Oh , Colonel Keith , what shall I do ? ”
92100	92118	92119	92119	he	2462	“ You need do nothing but go on your own way , and persist in your refusal , ”
92130	92147	92119	92119	he	2462	“ Oh , but pray , pray never let him speak to me about it again ! ”
92148	92192	92193	92193	he	2462	“ Not if I can help it , and I will do my best . You are quite right , Lady Temple . I do not think it would be at all advisable for yourself or the children , and hardly for himself , ”
92198	92214	92193	92193	he	2462	“ I think the mischief must all have been done by that game at whist . ”
92215	92237	92242	92243	the children	598	“ Then I ’ll never play again in my life ! I only thought he was an old man that wanted amusing—. ”
92253	92276	92242	92243	the children	598	back—“O dear ! how shall I ever look at Conrade again , now any one has thought I could forget his father ? ”
92277	92301	92193	92193	he	2462	“ If Conrade knew it , which I trust he never will , he ought to esteem it a testimony to his mother . ”
92302	92338	92345	92345	her	2464	“ Oh , no , for it must have been my fault ! I always was so childish , and when I ’ve got my boys with me , I ca n’t help being happy , ”
92348	92375	92345	92345	her	2464	“ I know I have not been as sad and serious as my aunt thought I ought to be , and now this comes of it . ”
92376	92386	92388	92389	Colonel Keith	207	“ You have been true , have acted nothing , ”
92391	92434	92388	92389	Colonel Keith	207	“ and that is best of all . No one who really knew you could mistake your feelings . No doubt that your conduct agrees better with what would please our dear Sir Stephen than if you drooped and depressed the children . ”
92435	92445	92446	92446	she	2464	“ Oh , I am glad you say that , ”
92464	92518	92446	92446	she	2464	“ I have tried to think what he would like in all I have done , and you know I ca n’t help being proud and glad of belonging to him still ; and he always told me not to be shy and creeping into the nursery out of every one ’s way . ”
92547	92572	92526	92526	he	2465	“ And now what would you like me to do ? Shall I try to persuade my brother to come away from this place ? ”
92573	92603	92526	92526	he	2465	“ Oh , but then every one would find out why , and that would be dreadful ! Besides , you are only just come . And Miss Williams — ”
92604	92614	92526	92526	he	2465	“ Do not let that stand in your way . ”
92615	92647	92526	92526	he	2465	“ No , no . You will be here to take care of me . And his going now would make people guess ; and that would be worse than anything . ”
92648	92718	92719	92719	She	2466	“ It would . The less disturbance the better ; and if you upset his plans now , he might plead a sort of right to renew the attempt later . Quiet indifference will be more dignified and discouraging . Indeed , I little thought to what I was exposing you . Now I hope you are going to rest , I am sure your head is aching terribly . ”
93268	93277	93278	93278	he	199	“ Let her get accustomed to the idea , ”
93285	93304	93278	93278	he	199	“ The very outcry she makes against it will be all in my favour when the turn comes . ”
93305	93315	93278	93278	he	199	“ I doubt whether you will find it so . ”
93316	93428	93278	93278	he	199	“ All the world does not live on romance like you , man . Look on , and you will see that a pretty young widow like her can not fail to get into scrapes ; have offers made to her , or at least the credit of them . I ’d lay you ten pounds that you are said to be engaged to her yourself by this time , and it is no one ’s fault but your own that you are not . It is in the very nature of things that she will be driven to shelter herself from the persecution , with whoever has bided his time . ”
93429	93441	93442	93442	He	2485	“ Oh , if you prefer being accepted on such terms — ”
93457	93501	93442	93442	He	2485	proceeded—“A pretty , gracious , ladylike woman , who has seen enough of the world to know how to take her place , and yet will be content with a quiet home . It is an introduction I thank you for , Colin . ”
93502	93506	93508	93508	Colin	236	“ And pray , ”
93525	93536	93515	93515	he	2485	“ what do you think of those seven slight encumbrances ? ”
93537	93545	93547	93548	Lord Keith	199	“ Oh , they are your charge , ”
93557	93583	93554	93554	his	199	“ Besides , most of them are lads , and what with school , sea , and India , they will be easily disposed of . ”
93584	93594	93596	93596	Colin	236	“ Certainly it has been so in our family , ”
93621	93624	93626	93627	Lord Keith	199	“ And , ”
93634	93690	93626	93627	Lord Keith	199	“ she is so handsomely provided for , that you see , Colin , I could afford to give you up the Auchinvar property , that should have been poor Archie ’s , and what with the farms and the moor , it would bring you in towards three hundred a year for your housekeeping . ”
93702	93718	93691	93691	Colin	236	“ I had rather see it settled as a provision on Mary and her children . ”
93729	93736	93738	93739	the Colonel	1244	“ That is all I desire , ”
94144	94151	94117	94117	her	128	“ Am I not a Sister ? ”
94424	94431	94419	94419	she	309	“ to speak to Mr. Touchett , ”
94780	94784	94771	94771	Rachel	128	“ scratching the surface ”
94793	94800	94771	94771	Rachel	128	“ What could presumptuous hope inspire . ”—Rokeby
95075	95078	95079	95079	she	612	“ Oh ! ”
95096	95107	95079	95079	she	612	“ I — I did not mean to interrupt you . ”
95108	95122	95124	95125	Colonel Keith	207	“ I ’m only helping Rose to change the water of her hyacinths , ”
95146	95158	95160	95161	Lady Temple	138	“ I did not know you were out to - day , ”
95168	95186	95160	95161	Lady Temple	138	“ Yes , I came to claim my walking companion . Where ’s your hat , Rosie ? ”
95225	95234	95219	95219	he	207	“ I thought he was safe out riding . ”
95235	95246	95249	95250	Lady Temple	138	“ Oh no , no , it is not that , ”
95354	95357	95358	95358	he	207	“ Well ! ”
95361	95395	95358	95358	he	207	“ Well ? Colin , have you so low an opinion of the dignity of your charge as to expect her to pour out her secrets to the first ear in her way ? ”
95396	95407	95344	95344	she	186	“ Oh , if she has told you in confidence . ”
95408	95423	95459	95459	he	207	“ No , she has not told me in confidence ; she knew better . ”
95424	95431	95358	95358	he	207	“ She has told you nothing ? ”
95432	95435	95437	95437	Ermine	186	“ Nothing ! ”
95462	95474	95459	95459	he	207	“ Ah ! the pleasure of disappointing me quite consoles you . ”
95475	95513	95358	95358	he	207	“ No ; the proof of the discretion of womanhood does that ! You thought , because she tells all her troubles to you , that she must needs do so to the rest of the world . ”
95514	95525	95358	95358	he	207	“ There is little difference between telling you and me . ”
95526	95539	95459	95459	he	207	“ That ’s the fault of your discretion , not of hers . ”
95540	95555	95358	95358	he	207	“ I should like to know who has been annoying her . I suspect — ”
95556	95587	95588	95588	He	207	“ So do I. And when you get the confidence at first hand , you will receive it with a better grace than if you had had a contraband foretaste . ”
95591	95604	95588	95588	He	207	“ I thought yours a more confidence - winning face , Ermine . ”
95605	95663	95358	95358	he	207	“ That depends on my respect for the individual . Now I thought Lady Temple would much prefer my looking another way , and talking about Conrade ’s Latin grammar , to my holding out my arms and inviting her to pour into my tender breast what another time she had rather not know that I knew . ”
95664	95672	95673	95673	he	207	“ That is being an honourable woman , ”
95931	95936	95938	95938	Ermine	186	“ Well , Colin , ”
95944	95970	95938	95938	Ermine	186	“ I have had a first - hand confidence , though from a different quarter . Poor Mr. Touchett came to announce his going away . ”
95971	95974	96418	96418	her	186	“ Going ! ”
95975	96038	96418	96418	her	186	“ Yes . In the very nick of time , it seems , Alick Keith has had a letter from his uncle ’s curate , asking him to see if he could meet with a southern clergyman to exchange duties for the winter with a London incumbent who has a delicate wife , and of course . Mr. Touchett jumped at it . ”
96039	96049	95938	95938	Ermine	186	“ A very good thing — a great relief . ”
96050	96120	96418	96418	her	186	“ Yes . He said he was very anxious for work , but he had lost ground in this place within the last few months , and he thought that he should do better in a fresh place , and that a fresh person would answer better here , at least for a time . I am very sorry for him , I have a great regard for him . ”
96121	96169	96418	96418	her	186	“ Yes ; but he is quite right to make a fresh beginning . Poor man ! he has been quite lifted off his feet , and entranced all this time , and his recovery will be much easier elsewhere . It was all that unlucky croquet . ”
96170	96255	95938	95938	Ermine	186	“ I believe it was . I think there was at first a reverential sort of distant admiration , too hopeless to do any one any harm , and that really might have refined him , and given him a little of the gentleman - like tone he has always wanted . But then came the croquet , and when it grew to be a passion it was an excuse for intimacy that it would have taken a stronger head than his to resist . ”
96256	96264	96418	96418	her	186	“ Under the infection of croquet fever . ”
96265	96365	96418	96418	her	186	“ It is what my father used to say of amusements — the instant they become passions they grow unclerical and do mischief . Now he used , though not getting on with the Curtises , to be most successful with the second - rate people ; but he has managed to offend half of them during this unhappy mania , which , of course , they all resent as mercenary , and how he is ever to win them back I do n’t know . After all , curatocult is a shallow motive — Rachel Curtis might triumph ! ”
96366	96404	95938	95938	Ermine	186	“ The higher style of clergyman does not govern by curatocult . I hope this one may be of that description , as he comes through Mr. Clare . I wonder if this poor man will return ? ”
96405	96408	96410	96410	Ermine	186	“ Perhaps , ”
96421	96450	96410	96410	Ermine	186	“ when Lady Temple is married to the Colonel . There now , I have gone and told you ! I did try to resolve I would not . ”
96451	96458	95938	95938	Ermine	186	“ And what did you say ? ”
96459	96476	95938	95938	Ermine	186	“ I thought it due to Lady Temple to tell him exactly how she regarded you . ”
96477	96543	96410	96410	Ermine	186	“ Yes , Ermine , and it is due to tell others also . I can not go on on these terms , either here or at Myrtlewood , unless the true state of the case is known . If you will not let me be a married man , I must be an engaged one , either to you or to the little Banksia . ”
96594	96599	96590	96590	Ermine	186	“ As you please . ”
96667	96685	96655	96655	she	186	“ Yes , it may be better that the true state of the case should be known , ”
96707	96751	96752	96752	she	186	“ At first I thought it would do him good , he began pitying us so vehemently ; but when he found I did not pity myself , he was as ready to forget our troubles as — you are to forget his , ”
96770	96785	96752	96752	she	186	“ I beg his pardon , but there are things that come more home . ”
96786	96791	96793	96793	Ermine	186	“ So thought he , ”
96795	96801	96803	96803	Colin	236	“ Did you find out , ”
96809	96816	96803	96803	Colin	236	“ what made him take courage ? ”
96817	96876	96752	96752	she	186	“ When he had once come to the subject , it seemed to be a relief to tell it all out , but he was so faltering and agitated that I did not always follow what he said . I gather , though , that Lady Temple has used him a little as a defence from other perils . ”
96877	96885	96752	96752	she	186	“ Yes , I have seen that . ”
96886	97056	96803	96803	Colin	236	“ And Miss Keith ’s fun has been more encouragement than she knew ; constantly summoning him to the croquet - ground , and giving him to understand that Lady Temple liked to have him there . Then came that unlucky day , it seems , when he found Bessie mounting her horse at the door , and she called out that it was too wet for croquet , but Lady Temple was in the garden , and would be glad to see him . She was going to make visits , and he walked down with her , and somehow , in regretting the end of the croquet season , he was surprised into saying how much it had been to him . He says she was exceedingly kind , and regretted extremely that anything should have inspired the hope , said she should never marry again , and entreated him to forget it , then I imagine she fled in here to put an end to it . ”
97057	97102	96752	96752	she	186	“ She must have been much more gentle this time than she was with Keith . I had never conceived her capable of being so furious as she was then . I am very sorry , I wish we could spare her these things . ”
97103	97126	97128	97128	Ermine	186	“ I am afraid that can only be done in one way , which you are not likely at present to take , ”
97142	97153	97154	97154	he	2565	“ I know no one less likely to marry again , ”
97157	97233	97154	97154	he	2565	“ yet no one of whom the world is so unlikely to believe it . Her very gentle simplicity and tenderness tell against her ! Well , the only hope now is that the poor man has not made his disappointment conspicuous enough for her to know that it is attributed to her . It is the beginning of the fulfilment of Keith ’s prediction that offers and reports will harass her into the deed ! ”
97234	97281	97340	97340	him	2566	“ There is nothing so fallacious as prophecies against second marriages , but I do n’t believe they will . She is too quietly dignified for the full brunt of reports to reach her , and too much concentrated on her children to care about them . ”
97282	97314	97315	97315	He	2566	“ Well , I have to see her to - morrow to make her sign some papers about her pension , so I shall perhaps find out how she takes it . ”
97407	97411	97419	97419	she	309	“ Frances Grace Temple ”
97426	97441	97419	97419	she	309	“ Is it true that poor Mr. Touchett is going away for the winter ? ”
97442	97452	97419	97419	she	309	“ I believe he is even going before Sunday . ”
97453	97476	97419	97419	she	309	“ I am very glad — I mean I am very sorry . Do you think any one knows why it is ? ”
97477	97507	97419	97419	she	309	“ Very few are intimate enough to guess , and those who are , know you too well to think it was otherwise than very foolish on his part . ”
97508	97514	97516	97516	Fanny	127	“ I do n’t know , ”
97518	97551	97419	97419	she	309	“ I think I must have been foolish too , or he never could have thought of it . And I was so sorry for him , he seemed so much distressed . ”
97552	97571	97419	97419	she	309	“ I do not wonder at that , when he had once allowed himself to admit the thought . ”
97572	97602	97604	97604	Fanny	127	“ Yes , that is the thing . I am afraid I ca n’t be what I ought to be , or people would never think of such nonsense , ”
97614	97636	97604	97604	Fanny	127	“ I ca n’t be guarding that dear memory as I ought , to have two such things happening so soon . ”
97637	97649	97419	97419	she	309	“ Perhaps they have made you cherish it all the more . ”
97650	97730	97731	97731	She	2570	“ As if I wanted that ! Please will you tell me how I could have been more guarded . I do n’t mind your knowing about this ; indeed you ought , for Sir Stephen trusted me to you , but I ca n’t ask my aunt or any one else . I ca n’t talk about it , and I would not have them know that Sir Stephen ’s wife ca n’t get his memory more respected . ”
97748	97758	97759	97759	he	2571	“ I do n’t think any one could answer , ”
97762	97830	97759	97759	he	2571	“ I did take my aunt ’s advice about the officers being here . I have not had them nearly as much as Bessie would have liked , not even Alick . I have been sorry it was so dull for her , but I thought it could not be wrong to be intimate with one ’s clergyman , and Rachel was always so hard upon him . ”
97831	97864	97419	97419	she	309	“ You did nothing but what was kind and right . The only possible thing that could have been wished otherwise was the making a regular habit of his playing croquet here . ”
97865	97893	97419	97419	she	309	“ Ah ! but the boys and Bessie liked it so much . However , I dare say it was wrong . Alick never did like it . ”
97894	97987	97759	97759	he	2571	“ Not wrong , only a little overdone . You ladies want sometimes to be put in mind that , because a clergyman has to manage his own time , he is not a whit more really at liberty than a soldier or a lawyer , whose hours are fixed for him . You do not do him or his parish any kindness by engrossing him constantly in pastimes that are all very well once in a way , but which he can not make habitual without detriment to his higher duties . ”
97988	98001	97419	97419	she	309	“ But I thought he would have known when he had time . ”
98002	98016	97419	97419	she	309	“ I am afraid curates are but bits of human nature after all . ”
98017	98026	97759	97759	he	2571	“ And what ought I to have done ? ”
98027	98091	97759	97759	he	2571	“ If you had been an exceedingly prudent woman who knew the world , you would have done just as you did about the officers , been friendly , and fairly intimate , but instead of ratifying the daily appointments for croquet , have given a special invitation now and then , and so shown that you did not expect him without one . ”
98092	98153	97419	97419	she	309	“ I see . Oh , if I had only thought in time , I need not have driven him away from his parish ! I hope he wo n’t go on being unhappy long ! Oh , I wish there may be some very nice young lady where he is going . If he only would come back married ! ”
98154	98164	97759	97759	he	2571	“ We would give him a vote of thanks . ”
98165	98175	98177	98177	Fanny	127	“ What a wedding present I would make her , ”
98182	98214	98177	98177	Fanny	127	“ I would give her my best Indian table , only I always meant that for Ermine . I think she must have the emu ’s egg set in Australian gold . ”
98215	98226	98228	98229	Colonel Keith	207	“ If she were to be induced by the bribe , ”
98233	98252	98253	98253	he	207	“ I think Ermine would be sufficiently provided for by the emu ’s egg . Do you know , ”
98260	98273	98253	98253	he	207	“ I think I have made a great step in that direction . ”
98282	98293	98294	98294	he	207	“ She has given me leave to mention the matter , ”
98297	98312	98294	98294	he	207	“ and I take that as a sign that her resistance will give way . ”
98313	98321	98323	98323	Fanny	127	“ Oh , I am very glad , ”
98325	98337	98323	98323	Fanny	127	“ I have so wished them to know at the Homestead , ”
98361	98373	98375	98376	the Colonel	1244	“ I should rather like to tell your cousin Rachel myself , ”
98378	98408	98375	98376	the Colonel	1244	“ she has always been very kind to Ermine , and appreciated her more than I should have expected . But she is not easily to be seen now . ”
98409	98419	98421	98421	Fanny	127	“ Her whole heart is in her orphan asylum , ”
98423	98443	98421	98421	Fanny	127	“ I hope you will soon go with us and see it ; the little girls look so nice . ”
98655	98663	98664	98664	she	128	“ Earnest enough for you , Rachel , ”
98669	98676	98664	98664	she	128	“ Is he a party man ? ”
98677	98694	98636	98637	Bessie Keith	204	“ Oh , parties are getting obsolete ! He works too hard for fighting battles outside . ”
99166	99168	99160	99161	Mrs. Mitchell	315	“ Objects ”
99223	99226	99210	99210	He	314	“ opinions , ”
99331	99335	99337	99338	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ My dear , ”
99344	99419	99337	99338	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ I offered Colonel Keith a seat in the carriage to go to the annual book - club meeting with us . Mr. Spicer is going to propose him as a member of the club , you know , and I thought the close carriage would be better for him . I suppose you will be ready by eleven ; we ought to set out by that time , not to hurry the horses . ”
99420	99426	99428	99428	Rachel	128	“ I am not going , ”
99517	99544	99509	99510	her mother	496	“ I wrote to Mrs. Spicer a month ago to take my name off . I have no superfluous money to spend on my selfish amusement . ”
99545	99549	99551	99551	Grace	127	“ But Rachel , ”
99553	99572	99509	99510	her mother	496	“ did you not particularly want — oh ! that fat red book which came to us uncut ? ”
99573	99584	99509	99510	her mother	496	“ I did , but I must do without it . ”
99585	99607	99509	99510	her mother	496	“ Poor Mr. Spicer , he reckoned on you to take it ; indeed , he thought you had promised him . ”
99608	99647	99509	99510	her mother	496	“ If there is anything like a promise , I suppose it must be done , but I do not believe there is . I trust to you , Grace , you know I have nothing to waste . ”
99648	99678	99509	99510	her mother	496	“ You had better go yourself , my dear , and then you would be able to judge . It would be more civil by the society , too . ”
99679	99724	99509	99510	her mother	496	“ No matter , indeed I can not ; in fact , Mr. Mauleverer is coming this morning to give his report and arrange our building plans . I want to introduce him to Mr. Mitchell , and fix a day for going over . ”
100164	100175	100176	100176	she	128	“ If I could only make the Barnaby bargain available , ”
100179	100206	100176	100176	she	128	“ it is cruel to have it tied up to mere apprenticeships , which in the present state of things are absolutely useless , or worse . ”
100207	100213	100129	100129	he	282	“ Can nothing be done ? ”
100214	100342	100176	100176	she	128	“ You shall hear . Dame Rachel Curtis , in 1605 , just when this place was taking up lace - making , an art learnt , I believe , from some poor nuns that were turned out of St. Mary ’s , at Avoncester , thought she did an immense benefit to the place by buying the bit of land known as Burnaby ’s Bargain , and making the rents go yearly to apprentice two poor girls born of honest parents . The rent is fourteen pounds , and so the fees are so small that only the small lace - makers here will accept them . I can not get the girls apprenticed to anything better in the towns except for a much larger premium . ”
100343	100359	100129	100129	he	282	“ Do I understand you that such a premium is at present to be bestowed ? ”
100360	100398	100400	100400	Rachel	320	“ No , not till next June . The two victims for this year have been sacrificed . But perhaps another time it might be possible to bind them to you as a wood engraver or printer ! ”
100404	100419	100400	100400	Rachel	320	“ I should be most happy . But who would be the persons concerned ? ”
100420	100473	100129	100129	he	282	“ The trustees are the representative of our family and the rector of the parish — not Mr. Touchett ( this is only a district ) , but poor old Mr. Linton at Avonbridge , who is barely able to sign the papers , so that practically it all comes to me . ”
100474	100484	100176	100176	she	128	“ Extremely fortunate for the objects of the charity . ”
100485	100553	100400	100400	Rachel	320	“ I wish it were so ; but if it could only be made available in such a cause as ours , I am sure my good namesake ’s intentions would be much better carried out than by binding these poor girls down to their cushions . I did once ask about it , but I was told it could only be altered by Act of Parliament . ”
100554	100563	100565	100566	Mr. Mauleverer	282	“ Great facilities have of late been given , ”
100568	100589	100565	100566	Mr. Mauleverer	282	“ many old endowments have most beneficially extended their scope . May I ask where the land in question is ? ”
100590	100661	100400	100400	Rachel	320	“ It is the level bit of meadow just by the river , and all the slope down to the mouth ; it has always been in our hands , and paid rent as part of the farm . You know how well it looks from the garden - seat , but it always grieves me when people admire it , for I feel as if it were thrown away . ”
100662	100685	100400	100400	Rachel	320	“ Ah ! I understand . Perhaps if I could see the papers I could judge of the feasibility of some change . ”
100720	100725	100400	100400	Rachel	320	“ Barnaby ’s Bargain . ”
100726	100732	100733	100733	she	320	“ I have been thinking , ”
100741	100791	100733	100733	she	320	“ that that piece of land must have grown much more valuable since this rent was set on it ! Fourteen pounds a year , why we never thought of it ; but surely in such a situation , it would be worth very much more for building purposes . ”
100792	100806	100400	100400	Rachel	320	“ There can be no doubt . But your approach , Miss Curtis ? ”
100807	100883	100733	100733	she	320	“ If it is a matter of justice to the charity , of course that could not be weighed a moment . But we must consider what is to be done . Get the land valued , and pay rent for it accordingly ? I would give it up to its fate , and let it for what it would bring , but it would break my mother ’s heart to see it built on . ”
100884	100905	100733	100733	she	320	“ Perhaps I had better take the papers and look over them . I see they will need much consideration . ”
100906	100976	100400	100400	Rachel	320	“ Very well , that will be the best way , but we will say nothing about it till we have come to some conclusion , or we shall only startle and distress my mother . After all , then , I do believe we have the real income of the F. U. E. E. within our very hands ! It might be ten times what it is now . ”
101242	101250	101252	101252	Rachel	128	“ Wonderfully kind to her he is , ”
101268	101281	101252	101252	Rachel	128	“ he takes that little girl out walking with him every morning . ”
101282	101293	101295	101295	Bessie	204	“ I wonder if his constancy will ever be rewarded ? ”
101322	101356	101319	101319	she	128	“ Surely you are not in ignorance ! What have I done ? I thought all the world knew — all the inner world , that is , that revels in a secret . ”
101357	101361	101363	101363	Rachel	128	“ Knew what ? ”
101373	101411	101363	101363	Rachel	128	“ Why the romance of Colin and Ermine ! To live on the verge of such a — a tragi - comedy , is it ? and not be aware of it , I do pity you . ”
101412	101422	101424	101425	her brother	1120	“ The only wonder is how you knew it , ”
101433	101670	101424	101425	her brother	1120	“ I ! Oh , it is a fine thing to be a long - eared little pitcher when one ’s elders imagine one hears nothing but what is addressed to oneself . There I sat , supposed to be at my lessons , when the English letters came in , and I heard papa communicating to mamma how he had a letter from old Lord Keith — not this one but one older still — the father of him — about his son ’s exchange — wanted papa to know that he was exemplary and all that , and hoped he would be kind to him , but just insinuated that leave was not desirable — in fact it was to break off an affair at home . And then , while I was all on fire to see what a lover looked like , comes another letter , this time to mamma , from Lady Alison something , who could not help recommending to her kindness her dear nephew Colin , going out broken - hearted at what was feared would prove a fatal accident , to the dearest , noblest girl in the world , for so she must call Ermine Williams . Ermine was a name to stick in one ’s memory if Williams was not , and so I assumed sufficient certainty to draw it all out of dear Lady Temple . ”
101671	101676	101678	101678	Rachel	128	“ She knows then ? ”
101687	101729	101678	101678	Rachel	128	“ Know ? Yes , or she could hardly make such a brother of the Colonel . In fact , I think it is a bit of treachery to us all to keep such an affair concealed , do n’t you ? ”
101742	101755	101678	101678	Rachel	128	“ Treachery not to post up a list of all one ’s — ”
101756	101761	101763	101763	Bessie	204	“ One ’s conquests ? ”
101775	101792	101763	101763	Bessie	204	“ Did you ever hear a more ingenious intimation of the number one has to boast ? ”
101793	101798	101801	101801	Alick	125	“ Only in character , ”
101803	101809	101811	101811	Rachel	128	“ But do not laugh , ”
101821	101840	101811	101811	Rachel	128	“ if this is so , it must be far too sad and melancholy to be laughed about . ”
101841	101846	101848	101848	Alick	125	“ So it is , ”
101856	101878	101848	101848	Alick	125	“ It has been a mournful business from the first , and I do not see how it is to end . ”
101879	101892	101894	101894	Bessie	204	“ Why , I suppose Colonel Colin is his own master now , ”
101896	101913	101894	101894	Bessie	204	“ and if he has no objection I do not see who else can make any . ”
101914	101930	101932	101932	Alick	125	“ There are people in the world who are what Tennyson calls ‘ selfless , ’ ”
101934	101942	101944	101944	Rachel	128	“ Then the objection comes from her ? ”
101948	101954	101956	101956	Bessie	204	“ So saith Lady Temple , ”
102285	102289	102291	102291	Ermine	186	“ So soon ? ”
102293	102304	102291	102291	Ermine	186	“ I have not seen you for a long time . ”
102305	102317	102319	102319	Rachel	128	“ I — I was afraid of being in the way , ”
102344	102354	102356	102356	Ermine	186	“ We are sure to be alone after twilight , ”
102358	102377	102356	102356	Ermine	186	“ if that is not too late for you , but I know you are much occupied now . ”
102415	102424	102426	102426	Ermine	186	“ Her whole soul is in that asylum , ”
102433	102458	102426	102426	Ermine	186	“ I should like to hear that it is going on satisfactorily , but she does not seem to have time even to talk . ”
102459	102467	102469	102469	Bessie	204	“ The most wonderful consummation of all , ”
102471	102474	102476	102476	Ermine	186	“ No , ”
102478	102498	102476	102476	Ermine	186	“ the previous talk was not chatter , but real effervescence from the unsatisfied craving for something to do . ”
102499	102508	102510	102510	Bessie	204	“ And has she anything to do now ? ”
102512	102539	102510	102510	Bessie	204	“ That is exactly what I want to know . It would be a great pity if all this real self - devotion were thrown away . ”
102540	102548	102550	102550	Alick	125	“ It can not be thrown away , ”
102552	102557	102559	102559	Ermine	186	“ Not on herself , ”
102561	102582	102559	102559	Ermine	186	“ but one would not see it misdirected , both for the waste of good energy and the bitter disappointment . ”
102583	102586	102588	102588	Bessie	204	“ Well , ”
102590	102603	102588	102588	Bessie	204	“ I ca n’t bear people to be so dreadfully in earnest ! ”
102604	102616	102618	102618	Ermine	186	“ You are accountable for the introduction , are not you ? ”
102620	102678	102618	102618	Ermine	186	“ I ’m quite willing ! I think a good downfall plump would be the most wholesome thing that could happen to her ; and besides , I never told her to take the man for her almoner and counsellor ! I may have pointed to the gulf , but I never bade Curtia leap into it . ”
102679	102693	102695	102695	Ermine	186	“ I wish there were any one to make inquiries about this person , ”
102697	102732	102695	102695	Ermine	186	“ but when Colonel Keith came it was too late . I hoped she might consult him , but she has been so much absorbed that she really has never come in his way . ”
102733	102741	102743	102743	Bessie	204	“ She would never consult any one , ”
102745	102753	102755	102755	Ermine	186	“ I am not sure of that , ”
102757	102787	102755	102755	Ermine	186	“ I think that her real simplicity is what makes her appear so opinionated . I verily believe that there is a great capability of humility at the bottom . ”
102788	102793	102795	102795	Bessie	204	“ Of the gulf , ”
102802	102830	102798	102799	her brother	1120	“ Quite true . She has always been told she is the clever woman of the family , and what can she do but accept the position ? ”
102831	102834	102836	102836	Ermine	186	“ Exactly , ”
102838	102885	102836	102836	Ermine	186	“ every one has given way to her , and , of course , she walks over their bodies , but there is something so noble about her that I can not but believe that she will one day shake herself clear of her little absurdities . ”
102886	102900	102902	102902	Bessie	204	“ That is contrary to the usual destiny of strong - minded women , ”
102904	102924	102926	102926	Ermine	186	“ She is not a strong - minded woman , she only has been made to believe herself one , ”
102953	102986	102943	102944	the last	2643	“ Generous rivals ! I never saw so good a comedy in all my days ! To disclose the fatal truth , and then bring the rival fair ones face to face ! ”
102987	103009	102943	102944	the last	2643	“ If that were your belief , Bessie , the demon of teasing has fuller possession of you than I knew . ”
103010	103016	103018	103018	Bessie	204	“ Ah ! I forgot , ”
103020	103051	103018	103018	Bessie	204	“ it is tender ground with you likewise . Alas ! Alick , sisterly affection can not blind me to the fact of that unrequited admiration for your honourable rival . ”
103052	103062	102943	102944	the last	2643	“ What , from the strong - minded Curtia ? ”
103063	103102	102943	102944	the last	2643	“ Ah ! but have we not just heard that this is not the genuine article , only a country - made imitation ? No wonder it was not proof against an honourable colonel in a brown beard . ”
103103	103120	103018	103018	Bessie	204	“ So much the better ; only unluckily there has been a marked avoidance of him . ”
103121	103168	102943	102944	the last	2643	“ Yes ; the Colonel was sacrificed with all other trivial incidents at the shrine of the F. U. L. E.—E. E. , I mean . And only think of finding out that one has been sacrificing empty air after all — and to empty air ! ”
103169	103178	103180	103180	Alick	125	“ Better than to sacrifice everything to oneself , ”
103182	103218	103180	103180	Alick	125	“ Not at all . The latter practice is the only way to be agreeable ! By - the - bye , Alick , I wonder if she will deign to come to the ball ? ”
103219	103223	102943	102944	the last	2643	“ What ball ? ”
103224	103260	102943	102944	the last	2643	“ Your ball at Avoncester . It is what I am staying on for ! Major McDonald all but promised me one ; and you know you must give one before you leave this place . ”
103261	103281	103180	103180	Alick	125	“ Do n’t you know that poor Fraser has just been sent for home on his sister ’s death ? ”
103282	103295	102943	102944	the last	2643	“ But I conclude the whole regiment does not go into mourning ? ”
103296	103445	102943	102944	the last	2643	“ No , but Fraser is the one fellow to whom this would be real enjoyment . Indeed , I particularly wish no hints may be given about it . Do n’t deny , I know you have ways of bringing about what you wish , and I will not have them used here . I know something of the kind must be done before we leave Avoncester , but to give one this autumn would be much sooner than needful . I believe there is hardly an officer but myself and Fraser to whom the expense would not be a serious consideration , and when I tell you my father had strong opinions about overdoing reciprocities of gaiety , and drawing heavily on the officers ’ purses for them , I do not think you will allow their regard for him to take that manifestation towards you . ”
103446	103451	103453	103453	Bessie	204	“ Of course not , ”
103457	103484	103453	103453	Bessie	204	“ I will not think of it again . Only when the fate does overtake you , you will have me here for it , Alick ? ”
103629	103633	103634	103634	she	128	“ After all , ”
103639	103688	103634	103634	she	128	“ there can be no great harm done , I have not been weak enough to commit my heart to the error . I am unscathed , and I will show it by sympathy for Ermine . Only — only , why could not she have told me ? ”
103754	103774	103751	103751	she	235	“ I do really think it is very unfair , but it was not his fault , he says . ”
103775	103778	103780	103780	Rachel	128	“ Who ? ”
103784	103793	103795	103797	good Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Why , Colonel Keith , my dear , ”
103805	103807	103751	103751	she	235	“ broken ”
103811	103823	103795	103797	good Mrs. Curtis	235	“ it seems we were mistaken in him all this time . ”
103824	103831	103833	103833	Rachel	128	“ What , about Miss Williams ? ”
103841	103848	103795	103797	good Mrs. Curtis	235	“ how did you hear it ? ”
103849	103858	103860	103861	her mother	496	“ You knew it , my dear child , ”
103868	103877	103860	103861	her mother	496	“ Only this afternoon , from Bessie Keith . ”
103878	103887	103889	103890	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ And Fanny knew it all this time , ”
103892	103954	103889	103890	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ I can not imagine how she could keep it from me , but it seems Miss Williams was resolved it should not be known . Colonel Keith said he felt it was wrong to go on longer without mentioning it , and I could not but say that it would have been a great relief to have known it earlier . ”
103955	103965	103967	103967	Rachel	128	“ As far as Fanny was concerned it would , ”
104006	104022	104024	104025	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ I could not help being extremely sorry for him when he was telling me , ”
104040	104094	104024	104025	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ It has been such a very long attachment , and now he says he has not yet been able to overcome her scruples about accepting him in her state . It is quite right of her , I ca n’t say but it is , but it is a very awkward situation . ”
104095	104102	104104	104104	Rachel	128	“ I do not see that , ”
104118	104170	104104	104104	Rachel	128	“ it is very sad and distressing in some ways , but no one can look at Miss Williams without seeing that his return has done her a great deal of good ; and whether they marry or not , one can only be full of admiration and respect for them . ”
104171	104176	104178	104179	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Yes , yes , ”
104181	104199	104178	104179	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ only I must say I think it was due to us to have mentioned it sooner . ”
104200	104231	104104	104104	Rachel	128	“ Not at all , mother . Fanny knew it , and it was nobody ’s concern but hers . Pray am I to have Owen ’s ‘ Palaeontology ’ ? ”
104232	104274	104104	104104	Rachel	128	“ No , Colonel Keith bought that , and some more of the solid books . My dear , he is going to settle here ; he tells me he has actually bought that house he and his brother are in . ”
104275	104279	104178	104179	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Bought it ! ”
104280	104355	104104	104104	Rachel	128	“ Yes ; he says , any way , his object is to be near Miss Williams . Well , I can not think how it is to end , so near the title as he is , and her sister a governess , and then that dreadful business about her brother , and the little girl upon her hands . Dear me , I wish Fanny had any one else for a governess . ”
104356	104362	104364	104364	Rachel	128	“ So do not I , ”
104366	104425	104364	104364	Rachel	128	“ I have the greatest possible admiration for Ermine Williams , and I do not know which I esteem most , her for her brave , cheerful , unrepining unselfishness , or him for his constancy and superiority to all those trumpery considerations . I am glad to have the watching of them . I honour them both . ”
104457	104467	104455	104455	Coriolanus	326	“ Yes , I go the week after next . ”
104468	104482	104104	104104	Rachel	128	“ So soon ? I thought you were to stay for our ball . ”
104483	104504	104364	104364	Rachel	128	“ Till this time next year ! No , no , I ca n’t quite do that , thank you . ”
104505	104510	104104	104104	Rachel	128	“ This very winter . ”
104511	104564	104566	104566	Meg	291	“ Oh , no — no such thing ! Why , half the beauty and fashion of the neighbourhood is not come into winter quarters yet . Besides , the very essence of a military ball is that it should be a parting — the brightest and the last . Good morning . ”
104641	104648	104650	104651	Lord Keith	199	“ Do you not like dancing ? ”
104670	104677	104679	104679	Bessie	204	“ I ’m not so unnatural , ”
104686	104718	104679	104679	Bessie	204	“ but it would never do to let the Highlanders give one now . Alick has been telling me that the expense would fall seriously on a good many of them . ”
104719	104722	104724	104725	Colonel Keith	207	“ True , ”
104727	104738	104724	104725	Colonel Keith	207	“ too many fetes come to be a heavy tax . ”
104739	104753	104755	104756	Lord Keith	199	“ That is more consideration than is common in so young a lad , ”
104758	104770	104772	104773	the sister	2662	“ Yes , but dear Alick is so full of consideration , ”
104777	104822	104825	104825	her	2662	“ He does not get half the credit for it that he deserves , because , you know , he is so quiet and reserved , and has that unlucky ironical way with him that people do n’t like ; especially rattlepates like those , ”
104836	104842	104844	104845	the Colonel	1244	“ It is a pity , ”
104847	104867	104844	104845	the Colonel	1244	“ it lessens his influence . And it is strange I never perceived it before his return to England . ”
104868	104919	104825	104825	her	2662	“ Oh ! there ’s much owing to the habitual languor of that long illness . That satirical mumble is the only trouble he will take to lift up his testimony , except when a thing is most decidedly his duty , and then he does it as England expects . ”
104920	104934	104936	104937	Lord Keith	199	“ And he considered it his duty to make you decline this ball ? ”
104939	104948	104950	104950	Bessie	204	“ Oh , not his more than mine , ”
104952	104965	104950	104950	Bessie	204	“ I do n’t forget that I am the Colonel ’s daughter . ”
104995	104998	104999	105000	Lord Keith	199	“ Dancing . ”
105796	105829	105770	105771	Emily Grey	327	“ And they say you have the hero here — the Victoria Cross man — and that you know him . You must show him to me , and get me introduced . ”
105830	105839	105841	105841	Rachel	128	“ There is no Victoria Cross man here , ”
105845	105853	105841	105841	Rachel	128	“ Colonel Keith did not have one . ”
105854	105923	105770	105771	Emily Grey	327	“ Oh , no , I do n’t mean Colonel Keith , but Captain Alexander Keith , quite a young man . Oh , I am sure you remember the story — you were quite wild about it — of his carrying the lighted shell out of the hospital tent ; and they told me he was always over here , and his sister staying with Lady Temple . ”
105924	105931	105933	105933	Rachel	128	“ I know Captain Alexander Keith , ”
105937	105957	105933	105933	Rachel	128	“ but you must be mistaken , I am certain I should know if he had a Victoria Cross . ”
105958	105972	105974	105975	Miss Grey	329	“ It is very odd ; Charlie told me it was the same , ”
105993	106000	106002	106002	Rachel	128	“ Scottish names are very common , ”
106158	106164	106165	106165	he	2704	“ You do n’t polk ? ”
106170	106195	106165	106165	he	2704	“ In fact , you regard all this as a delusion of weak minds . Then , will you come and have some tea ? ”
106232	106240	106218	106218	she	128	“ That is not the Victoria Cross ? ”
106241	106254	106255	106255	he	2704	“ Then it is , like all the rest , a delusion , ”
106264	106268	106269	106269	she	128	“ And gained , ”
106272	106290	106269	106269	she	128	“ by saving the lives of all those officers , the very thing I told you about ! ”
106291	106300	106218	106218	she	128	“ You told me that man was killed . ”
106301	106308	106218	106218	she	128	“ Then it was not you ! ”
106309	106321	106269	106269	she	128	“ Perhaps they picked up the pieces of the wrong one . ”
106322	106335	106218	106218	she	128	“ But if you would only tell me how you gained it . ”
106336	106343	106218	106218	she	128	“ By the pursuit of conchology . ”
106344	106350	106353	106353	Rachel	128	“ Then it was yourself ? ”
106359	106370	106371	106371	he	2704	“ If I be I as I suppose I be , ”
106390	106407	106218	106218	she	128	“ Many such things have happened , and I did not know whether you meant this . ”
106408	106420	106376	106376	his	2704	“ That was the reason you made so light of it . ”
106421	106432	106376	106376	his	2704	“ What , because I thought it was somebody else ? ”
106433	106455	106218	106218	she	128	“ No , the contrary reason ; but I can not understand why you let me go on without telling me . ”
106456	106469	106376	106376	his	2704	“ I never interfere when a story is so perfect in itself . ”
106470	106479	106481	106481	Rachel	128	“ But is my story perfect in itself ? ”
106483	106490	106376	106376	his	2704	“ or is it the contrary ? ”
106491	106503	106504	106504	he	2704	“ No one knows less of the particulars than I do , ”
106507	106573	106504	106504	he	2704	“ I think your version was that it was an hospital tent that the shell came into . It was not that , but a bungalow , which was supposed to be out of range . It stood on a bit of a slope , and I thought I should have been able to kick the shell down before it had time to do mischief . ”
106574	106594	106596	106596	Rachel	128	“ But you picked it up , and took it to the door — I mean , did you ? ”
106629	106635	106636	106636	she	128	“ I was very blind , ”
106641	106661	106636	106636	she	128	“ and now I have gone and insisted to poor Emily Grey that you never did any such thing . ”
106662	106666	106667	106667	he	125	“ Thank you , ”
106670	106681	106667	106667	he	125	“ it was the greatest kindness you could do me . ”
106682	106697	106636	106636	she	128	“ Ah ! your sister said you had the greatest dislike to hero worship . ”
106698	106705	106706	106706	he	125	“ A natural sense of humbug , ”
106709	106720	106721	106721	he	125	“ I do n’t know why they gave me this , ”
106728	106786	106721	106721	he	125	“ unless it was that one of the party in the bungalow had a turn for glorifying whatever happened to himself . Plenty of more really gallant things happened every day , and were never heard of , and I , who absolutely saw next to nothing of the campaign , have little right to be decorated . ”
106787	106790	106792	106792	Rachel	128	“ Ah ! ”
106796	106814	106792	106792	Rachel	128	“ I have always wondered whether one would be happier for having accomplished an act of heroism . ”
106815	106821	106823	106823	Alick	125	“ I do not know , ”
106839	106877	106830	106830	Rachel	128	“ Oh , you mean this ; but it was mere self - preservation . I could hardly even have bolted , for I was laid up with fever , and was very shaky on my legs . ”
106878	106884	106886	106886	Rachel	128	“ I suppose , however , ”
106888	106913	106886	106886	Rachel	128	“ that the vision of one ’s life in entering the army would be to win that sort of distinction , and so young . ”
106914	106922	106924	106924	Alick	125	“ Win it as some have done , ”
106926	106970	106924	106924	Alick	125	“ and deserve what is far better worth than distinction . That may be the dream , but , after all , it is the discipline and constant duty that make the soldier , and are far more really valuable than exceptional doings . ”
106971	106982	106984	106984	Rachel	128	“ People must always be ready for them , though , ”
106985	106990	106992	106992	Alick	125	“ And they are , ”
107020	107036	107007	107007	she	128	“ Do you mean that the reception of this cross was no gratification to you ? ”
107037	107046	107051	107051	he	125	“ No , I am not so absurd , ”
107055	107095	107051	107051	he	125	“ That was damped quite otherwise . The news that I was named for it came almost in the same breath with that of my father ’s death , and he had not heard I was to receive it . ”
107096	107103	107007	107007	she	128	“ Ah ! I can understand . ”
107104	107192	107007	107007	she	128	“ And you can see how intolerable was the fuss my good relations made with me just when the loss was fresh on me , and with that of my two chief friends , among my brother officers , fellows beside whom I was nobody , and there was my uncle ’s blindness getting confirmed . Was not that enough to sicken one with being stuck up for a lion , and constantly poked up by the showwoman , under pretext of keeping up one ’s spirits ! ”
107193	107208	107051	107051	he	125	“ And you were — I mean were you — too ill to escape ? ”
107209	107250	107007	107007	she	128	“ I was less able to help myself than Miss Williams is . There had been a general smash of all the locomotive machinery on this side , and the wretched monster could do nothing but growl at his visitors . ”
107251	107328	107007	107007	she	128	“ Should you growl very much if I introduced you to Emily Grey ? You see it is a matter of justice and truth to tell her now , after having contradicted her so flatly . I will wait to let you get out of the way first if you like , but I think that would be unkind to her ; and if you ever do dance , I wish you would dance with her . ”
107329	107335	107336	107336	he	2710	“ With all my heart , ”
107339	107345	107347	107347	Rachel	128	“ Oh , thank you , ”
107429	107443	107447	107447	he	2710	“ Emily , you were right after all , and I was mistaken , ”
107451	107464	107447	107447	he	2710	“ Miss Grey , Captain Keith wishes to be introduced to you . ”
107545	107553	107555	107555	Rachel	128	“ There is genuine heroism in him , ”
107557	107653	107555	107555	Rachel	128	“ but it is just in what Emily would never appreciate — it is in the feeling that he could not help doing as he did ; the half - grudging his reward to himself because other deeds have passed unspoken . I wonder whether his ironical humour would allow him to see that Mr. Mauleverer is as veritable a hero in yielding hopes of consideration , prospects , honours , to his sense of truth and uprightness . If he would only look with an unprejudiced eye , I know he would be candid . ”
107654	107662	107664	107665	Colonel Keith	207	“ Are you looking for Mrs. Curtis ? ”
107667	107677	107664	107665	Colonel Keith	207	“ I think she is in the other room . ”
107678	107685	107687	107687	Rachel	128	“ Not particularly , thank you , ”
107706	107721	107697	107697	she	128	“ Would it be contrary to your principles or practice to dance with me ? ”
107722	107727	107728	107728	she	128	“ To my practice , ”
107732	107758	107759	107759	she	128	“ so let us find my mother . Is Miss Alison Williams here ? I never heard whether it was settled that she should come , ”
107786	107815	107759	107759	she	128	“ No , she was obstinate , though her sister and I did our utmost to persuade her , and the boys were crazy to make her go . ”
107816	107825	107776	107777	her mother	496	“ I ca n’t understand your wishing it . ”
107826	107863	107874	107874	Rachel	128	“ Not as an experience of life ? Alison never went to anything in her girlhood , but devoted herself solely to her sister , and it would be pleasant to see her begin her youth . ”
107864	107872	107874	107874	Rachel	128	“ Not as a mere young lady ! ”
107876	107883	107874	107874	Rachel	128	“ That is happily not possible . ”
107913	107926	107927	107927	Rachel	128	“ I must say young ladyhood looks to the greatest advantage there , ”
107996	108004	108006	108007	the Colonel	1244	“ She is a very pretty creature , ”
108017	108036	108038	108038	Rachel	128	“ I never saw any one make the pursuits of young ladyhood have so much spirit and meaning , ”
108040	108063	108038	108038	Rachel	128	“ Here you see she has managed to make herself sufficiently like other people , yet full of individual character and meaning . ”
108064	108075	108077	108078	the Colonel	1244	“ That is the theory of dress , I suppose , ”
108080	108088	108077	108078	the Colonel	1244	“ If one chooses to cultivate it . ”
108089	108100	108038	108038	Rachel	128	“ Did you ever see Lady Temple in full dress ? ”
108101	108114	108038	108038	Rachel	128	“ No ; we were not out when we parted as girls . ”
108115	108188	108077	108078	the Colonel	1244	“ Then you have had a loss . I think it was at our last Melbourne ball , that when she went to the nursery to wish the children good night , one of them — Hubert , I believe — told her to wear that dress when she went to heaven , and dear old Sir Stephen was so delighted that he went straight upstairs to kiss the boy for it . ”
108189	108195	108197	108198	Alick Keith	125	“ Was that Lady Temple ? ”
108234	108237	108239	108240	the Colonel	1244	“ Yes , ”
108242	108260	108239	108240	the Colonel	1244	“ I was recollecting the gracious vision she used to be at all our chief ’s parties . ”
108261	108329	108215	108215	his	125	“ Vision , you call her , who lived in the house with her ? What do you think she was to us — poor wretches — coming up from barracks where Mrs. O’Shaughnessy was our cynosure ? There was not one of us to whom she was not Queen of the East , and more , with that innocent , soft , helpless dignity of hers ! ”
108330	108341	108343	108344	the Colonel	1244	“ And Sir Stephen for the first of her vassals , ”
108346	108354	108356	108356	Alick	125	“ What a change it has been ! ”
108358	108393	108356	108356	Alick	125	“ Yes ; but a change that has shown her to have been unspoilable . We were just agreeing on the ball - room perfections of her and your sister in their several lines . ”
108394	108399	108401	108401	Alick	125	“ Very different lines , ”
108405	108414	108416	108416	Rachel	128	“ I ca n’t judge of Fanny ’s , ”
108418	108439	108416	108416	Rachel	128	“ but your sister is almost enough to make one believe there can be some soul in young lady life . ”
108440	108451	108356	108356	Alick	125	“ I did not bring Bessie here to convert you , ”
108458	108463	108465	108465	Rachel	128	“ Nor has she , ”
108467	108488	108489	108489	Alick	125	“ except so far as I see that she can follow ordinary girls ’ pursuits without being frivolous in them . ”
108495	108503	108505	108505	Rachel	128	“ And she has been a sunbeam , ”
108507	108518	108505	108505	Rachel	128	“ we shall all feel graver and cloudier without her . ”
108519	108522	108524	108525	Colonel Keith	207	“ Yes , ”
108527	108550	108551	108551	he	207	“ and I am glad Mr. Clare has such a sunbeam for his parsonage . What a blessing she will be there ! ”
108597	108611	108594	108594	Rachel	128	“ I do envy that power of saying the right thing to everybody ! ”
108612	108621	108623	108623	his	207	“ Don’t — it is the greatest snare , ”
108648	108656	108631	108631	she	128	“ It prevents many difficulties and embarrassments . ”
108657	108662	108707	108707	Rachel	128	“ Very desirable things . ”
108663	108682	108684	108684	Rachel	128	“ Yes ; for those that like to laugh , but not for those that are laughed at , ”
108686	108703	108684	108684	Rachel	128	“ More so ; the worst of all misfortunes is to wriggle too smoothly through life . ”
109569	109576	109577	109577	she	204	“ He is a good creature , ”
109580	109625	109577	109577	she	204	“ and most necessary to my uncle , but how he and I are to get through life together , I can not tell . It must soon be tried , though ! After my visit at Bath will come my home at Bishopsworthy ! ”
109729	109739	109740	109740	she	204	“ And I must go some time or other , ”
109746	109789	109740	109740	she	204	“ so it had better be when you are all here to make Myrtlewood cheerful , and I can be of most use to poor Jane ! I do think dear Lady Temple is much more full of life and brightness now ! ”
109955	109975	109953	109953	Bessie	204	“ it was much better for her than staying at home with her , and bringing in no novelty . ”
109976	110006	109953	109953	Bessie	204	“ Pray come to me again , dearest ! Your stay has been the greatest treat . It is very kind in you to be so good to me . ”
110007	110021	109953	109953	Bessie	204	“ It is you who are good to me , dearest Lady Temple . ”
110022	110060	109953	109953	Bessie	204	“ I am afraid I shall hardly get you again . Your poor uncle will never be able to part with you , so I wo n’t ask you to promise , but if ever you can — ”
110061	110079	109953	109953	Bessie	204	“ If ever I can ! This has been a very happy time , dear Lady Temple , ”
110093	110122	110089	110089	she	2781	“ I shall always think of you as the kindest friend a motherless girl ever had ! I will write to you from Bath . Good - bye — ”
110199	110210	110198	110198	It	2785	“ Alick , I have something to say to you . ”
110297	110319	110320	110320	She	204	“ Alick , I have something to say to you , and I suppose I may as well say it now . ”
110339	110362	110320	110320	She	204	“ Ah , well , I ’ve been a sore plague to you , but I shall be off your hands now . ”
110363	110373	110280	110280	Bessie	204	“ Eh ! whose head have you been turning ? ”
110374	110385	110320	110320	She	204	“ Alick , what do you think of Lord Keith ? ”
110392	110397	110398	110398	he	125	“ The old ass ! ”
110401	110413	110398	110398	he	125	“ But at least you are out of his way now . ”
110414	110432	110280	110280	Bessie	204	“ Not at all . He is coming to Bath to - morrow to see my aunt . ”
110433	110448	110280	110280	Bessie	204	“ And you want me to go out to - morrow and stop him ? ”
110449	110471	110398	110398	he	125	“ No , Alick , not exactly . I have been cast about the world too long not to be thankful . ”
110472	110475	110280	110280	Bessie	204	“ Elizabeth ! ”
110476	110485	110486	110486	she	2789	“ Do not look so very much surprised , ”
110495	110523	110486	110486	she	2789	“ May I not be supposed able to feel that noble kindness and gracious manner , and be glad to have some one to look up to ? ”
110524	110531	110533	110533	Alick	125	“ And how about Charlie Carleton ? ”
110541	110547	110548	110548	she	2789	“ For shame , Alick ! ”
110552	110594	110548	110548	she	2789	“ you who were the one to persecute me about him , and tell me all sorts of things about his being shallow and unprincipled , and not to be thought of , you to bring him up against me now . ”
110595	110603	110605	110605	Alick	125	“ I might think all you allege , ”
110609	110620	110621	110621	Bessie	204	“ and yet be much amazed at the new project . ”
110624	110683	110621	110621	Bessie	204	“ In fact you made a little romance , in which you acted the part of sapient brother , and the poor little sister broke her heart ever after ! You wanted such an entertainment when you were lying on the sofa , so you created a heroine and a villain , and thundered down to the rescue . ”
110684	110709	110548	110548	she	2789	“ Very pretty , Bessie , but it will not do . It was long after I was well again , and had joined . ”
110710	110748	110621	110621	Bessie	204	“ Then it was the well - considered effect of the musings of your convalescence ! When you have a sister to take care of , it is as well to feel that you are doing it . ”
110749	110754	110756	110757	her brother	1120	“ Now , Elizabeth , ”
110774	110800	110769	110769	his	1120	“ before I hear another word on this matter , look me in the face and tell me deliberately that you never cared for Carleton . ”
110801	110812	110814	110814	Bessie	204	“ I never thought for one moment of marrying him , ”
110818	110843	110814	110814	Bessie	204	“ If I ever had any sort of mercy on him , it was all to tease you . There , are you satisfied ? ”
110844	110852	110853	110853	he	1120	“ I must be , I suppose , ”
110861	110867	110857	110857	he	1120	“ When was this settled ? ”
110868	110911	110769	110769	his	1120	“ Yesterday , walking up and down the esplanade . He will tell his brother to - day , and I shall write to Lady Temple . Oh , Alick , he is so kind , he spoke so highly of you . ”
110912	110917	110919	110919	Alick	125	“ I must say , ”
110927	110953	110919	110919	Alick	125	“ that if you wished for the care of an old man , I should have thought my uncle the more agreeable of the two . ”
110954	110968	110769	110769	his	1120	“ He is little past fifty . You are very hard on him . ”
110969	110994	110769	110769	his	1120	“ On the contrary , I am sorry for him . You will always find it good for him to do whatever suits yourself . ”
110995	110998	111000	111001	his sister	5961	“ Alick ? ”
111004	111020	111000	111001	his sister	5961	“ you have never forgotten or forgiven my girlish bits of neglect after your wound . ”
111021	111026	111027	111027	he	125	“ No , Bessie , ”
111035	111082	111027	111027	he	125	“ it is not the neglect or the girlishness , but the excuses to me , still more to my uncle , and most of all to yourself . They are what make me afraid for you in what you are going to take upon yourself . ”
111091	111150	111000	111001	his sister	5961	pursued—“Are you driven to this by dislike to living at Bishopsworthy ? If so , do not be afraid to tell me . I will make any arrangement , if you would prefer living with Jane . We agreed once that it would be too expensive , but now I could let you have another hundred a year . ”
111151	111175	111090	111090	he	125	“ As if I would allow that , Alick ! No , indeed ! Lord Keith means you to have all my share . ”
111176	111207	111090	111090	he	125	“ Does he ? There are more words than one to that question . And pray is he going to provide properly for his poor daughter in the West Indies ? ”
111208	111220	111000	111001	his sister	5961	“ I hope to induce him to take her into favour . ”
111221	111247	111000	111001	his sister	5961	“ Eh ? and to make him give up to Colin Keith that Auchinvar estate that he ought to have had when Archie Keith died ? ”
111248	111276	111090	111090	he	125	“ You may be sure I shall do my best for the Colonel . Indeed , I do think Lord Keith will consent to the marriage now . ”
111277	111286	111287	111287	he	2792	“ You have sacrificed yourself on that account ? ”
111313	111324	111287	111287	he	2792	“ That is understood , so give me the merit . ”
111325	111354	111090	111090	he	125	“ The merit of , for his sake , becoming a grandmother . You have thought of the daughters ? Mrs. Comyn Menteith must be older than yourself . ”
111355	111359	111361	111361	Bessie	204	“ Three years , ”
111373	111391	111361	111361	Bessie	204	“ and I shall have seven grandchildren in all , so you see you must respect me . ”
111392	111399	111090	111090	he	125	“ Do you know her sentiments ? ”
111400	111435	111090	111090	he	125	“ I know what they will be when we have met . Never fear , Alick . If she were not married it might be serious , being so , I have no fears . ”
111454	111457	111458	111458	he	125	“ Bessie , ”
111469	111504	111458	111458	he	125	“ do n’t think me unkind . I believe you have waited on purpose to leave me no time for expostulation , and what I have said has sounded the more harsh in consequence . ”
111505	111510	111511	111511	she	2794	“ No , Alick , ”
111514	111580	111511	111511	she	2794	“ you are a kind brother in all but the constructions you put upon my doings . I think it would be better if there were more difference between our ages . You are a young guardian , over anxious , and often morbidly fanciful about me during your illness . I think we shall be happier together when you no longer feel yourself responsible . ”
111581	111586	111588	111588	Alick	125	“ The tables turned , ”
111590	111597	111599	111599	Bessie	204	“ I am prepared for misconstruction , ”
111601	111678	111599	111599	Bessie	204	“ I know it will be supposed to be the title ; the estate it can not be , for you know how poor a property it is ; but I do not mean to care for the world . Your opinion is a different thing , and I thought you would have seen that I could not be insensible to such dignified kindness , and the warmth of a nature that many people think cold . ”
111679	111689	111511	111511	she	2794	“ I do n’t like set speeches , Bessie . ”
111690	111713	111599	111599	Bessie	204	“ Then believe me , Alick . May I not love the fine old man that has been so kind to me ? ”
111714	111720	111722	111722	Alick	125	“ I hope you do , ”
111726	111748	111722	111722	Alick	125	“ And you ca n’t believe it ? Not with Lady Temple before you and hers was really an old man . ”
111749	111764	111765	111765	he	125	“ Do not talk of her or Sir Stephen either . No , Bessie , ”
111773	111955	111765	111765	he	125	“ I may be doing great injustice to you both , but I must speak what it is my duty to say . Lord Keith is a hard , self - seeking man , who has been harsh and grasping towards his family , and I verily believe came here bent on marriage , only because his brother was no longer under his tyranny . He may not be harsh to you , because he is past his vigour , and if he really loves you , you have a power of governing ; but from what I know of you , I can not believe in your loving him enough to make such management much better than selfish manoeuvring . Therefore I can not think this marriage for your real welfare , or be other than bitterly grieved at it . Do not answer , Bessie , but think this over , and if at any time this evening you feel the least doubt of your happiness in this matter , telegraph to me , and I will stop him . ”
111956	111961	111962	111962	she	2795	“ Indeed , Alick , ”
111968	111979	111962	111962	she	2795	“ I believe you are very anxious for my good . ”
112299	112316	112267	112267	he	258	“ Oh , I am not afraid of that . She will manage him fast enough . ”
112317	112415	112267	112267	he	258	“ Very likely , and for his good . Nor need you question his being a safe guide for her in higher matters . Perhaps you are prejudiced against him because his relations with me have not been happy , but candidly , in them you know the worst of him ; and no doubt he thought himself purely acting for my welfare . I know much more of him now that I have been at home with him , and I was greatly struck with his real consideration for the good of all concerned with him . ”
112416	112448	112267	112267	he	258	“ No , I am not thinking of Lord Keith . To speak it out , I can not believe that my sister has heart enough in this to justify her . ”
112449	112463	112267	112267	he	258	“ Young girls often are more attracted by elderly men than by lads . ”
112464	112481	112483	112483	Alick	125	“ You do not know Bessie as , I am sorry to say , I do , ”
112500	112548	112483	112483	Alick	125	“ I do not say that she says anything untrue , but the truth is not in her . She is one of those selfish people who are infinitely better liked than those five hundred times their worth , because they take care to be always pleased . ”
112549	112559	112267	112267	he	258	“ They give as much pleasure as they take . ”
112560	112624	112267	112267	he	258	“ Yes , they take every one in . I wish to my heart I could be taken in too , but I have seen too much of her avoidance of every service to my uncle that she did not like . I verily believe , at this moment , that one great inducement with her is to elude the care of him . ”
112625	112663	112483	112483	Alick	125	“ Stern judgments , Alick . I know you would not speak thus without warrant ; but take it into account that marriage makes many a girl ’s selfishness dual , and at last drowns the self . ”
112664	112783	112784	112785	Colonel Keith	207	“ Yes , when it is a marriage of affection . But the truth must be told , Colonel . There was a trumpery idle fellow always loitering at Littleworthy , and playing croquet . I set my face against it with all my might , and she always laughed to scorn the notion that there was anything in it , nor do I believe that she has heart enough to wish to marry him . I could almost say I wish she had , but I never saw her show the same pleasure in any one ’s attentions , and I believe he is gone out to Rio in hopes of earning means to justify his addresses . ”
112798	112818	112790	112790	he	207	“ Do you mean that there was attachment enough to make it desirable that you should tell my brother ? ”
112819	112842	112483	112483	Alick	125	“ No , I could say nothing that she could not instantly contradict with perfect truth , though not with perfect sincerity . ”
112843	112875	112784	112785	Colonel Keith	207	“ Let me ask you one question , Alick — not a flattering one . May not some of these private impressions of yours have been coloured by your long illness ! ”
112876	112887	112889	112889	Alick	125	“ That is what Bessie gives every one to understand , ”
112893	113010	112889	112889	Alick	125	“ She is right , to a certain degree , that suffering sharpened my perceptions , and helplessness gave me time to draw conclusions . If I had been well , I might have been as much enchanted as other people ; and if my uncle had not needed her care , and been neglected , I could have thought that I was rendered exacting by illness . But I imagine all I have said is not of the slightest use , only , if you think it right to tell your brother to talk to me , I would rather stand all the vituperation that would fall on me than allow this to take place . ”
113057	113067	113069	113070	Colonel Keith	207	“ I see no purpose that would be answered , ”
113079	113139	113069	113070	Colonel Keith	207	“ you have nothing tangible to mention , even as to the former affair that you suspect . I see a great deal in your view of her to make you uneasy , but nothing that would not be capable of explanation , above all to such a man as my brother . It would appear like mere malevolence . ”
113140	113148	113150	113150	Alick	125	“ Never mind what it would appear , ”
113170	113185	113187	113188	the Colonel	1244	“ If the appearance would entirely baffle the purpose , it must be considered , ”
113190	113219	113187	113188	the Colonel	1244	“ and in this case it could only lead to estrangement , which would be a lasting evil . I conclude that you have remonstrated with your sister . ”
113220	113240	113069	113070	Colonel Keith	207	“ As much as she gave me time for ; but of course that is breath spent in vain . ”
113241	113253	113069	113070	Colonel Keith	207	“ Your uncle had the same means of judging as yourself . ”
113254	113310	113187	113188	the Colonel	1244	“ No , Colonel , he could do nothing ! In the first place , there can be no correspondence with him ; and next , he is so devotedly fond of Bessie , that he would no more believe anything against her than Lady Temple would . I have tried that more than once . ”
113311	113346	113069	113070	Colonel Keith	207	“ Then , Alick , there is nothing for it but to let it take its course ; and even upon your own view , your sister will be much safer married than single . ”
113347	113371	113069	113070	Colonel Keith	207	“ I had very little expectation of your saying anything else , but in common honesty I felt bound to let you know . ”
113372	113389	113187	113188	the Colonel	1244	“ And now the best thing to be done is to forget all you have said . ”
113390	113439	113069	113070	Colonel Keith	207	“ Which you will do the more easily as you think it an amiable delusion of mine . Well , so much the better . I dare say you will never think otherwise , and I would willingly believe that my senses went after my fingers ’ ends . ”
113666	113669	113663	113664	JOANNA BAILLIE	336	“ Mamma , ”
113673	113694	113705	113705	Hubert	316	“ I thought a woman must not marry her grandfather . And she called him the patriarch of her clan . ”
113695	113703	113705	113705	Hubert	316	“ He is a cross old man , ”
113707	113733	113705	113705	Hubert	316	“ He said children ought not to be allowed on the esplanade , because he got into the way as I was pushing the perambulator . ”
113734	113740	113742	113742	Francis	139	“ This was the reason , ”
113746	113772	113742	113742	Francis	139	“ that she stopped me from braying at him . I shall know what people are at , when they talk of disrespect another time . ”
113773	113780	113782	113782	Conrade	126	“ Do n’t talk of her , ”
113788	113796	113785	113785	himself	126	“ women have no truth in them . ”
113797	113807	113813	113813	boys	681	“ Except the dear , darling , delightful mammy ! ”
113945	113948	113930	113930	She	2828	“ Indeed ! ”
113990	113998	114000	114000	her	2828	“ Aspirations in women are mere delusions , ”
114006	114022	114000	114000	her	2828	“ There is no truer saying , than that a woman will receive every man . ”
114023	114033	114035	114035	Grace	127	“ I have always been glad that is aprocryphal , ”
114037	114045	114035	114035	Grace	127	“ and Eastern women have no choice . ”
114046	114055	114057	114057	Rachel	128	“ Nor are Western women better than Eastern , ”
114059	114102	114057	114057	Rachel	128	“ It is all circumstances . No mental power or acuteness has in any instance that I have yet seen , been able to balance the propensity to bondage . The utmost flight is , that the attachment should not be unworthy . ”
114103	114113	114115	114115	Grace	127	“ I own that I am very much surprised , ”
114117	114124	114126	114126	Rachel	128	“ I am not at all , ”
114128	114205	114126	114126	Rachel	128	“ I have given up hoping better things . I was beginning to have a high opinion of Bessie Keith ’s capabilities , but womanhood was at the root all the time ; and , as her brother says , she has had great disadvantages , and I can make excuses for her . She had not her heart filled with one definite scheme of work and usefulness , such as deters the trifling and designing . ”
114206	114214	114248	114248	Rachel	128	“ Like the F. U. E. E. ? ”
114215	114245	114126	114126	Rachel	128	“ Yes , the more I see of the fate of other women , the more thankful I am that my vocation has taken a formed and developed shape . ”
114320	114324	114325	114325	he	258	“ Thank you , ”
114333	114340	114325	114325	he	258	“ Did she write to you ? ”
114341	114344	114356	114356	his	258	“ No . ”
114345	114350	114356	114356	his	258	“ I thought not . ”
114450	114454	114456	114457	Miss Keith	244	“ or else , ”
114459	114501	114456	114457	Miss Keith	244	“ I should have been enchanted to have overcome your reluctance to witness the base surrender of female rights . I am afraid you are only too glad to be let off , only do n’t thank me , but circumstances . ”
114561	114584	114530	114530	she	127	“ For such a pleasant - spoken lady as Miss Keith , she would sit up all night rather than disappoint her . ”
114675	114741	114661	114661	She	304	“ makin ’ siccan a fule ’s bargain wi ’ yon glaikit lass . My certie , but he ’ll hae the warst o’t , honest man ; rinnin ’ after her , wi ’ a ’ her whigmaleries an ’ cantrips . He ’ll rue the day that e’er he bowed his noble head to the likes o ’ her , I ’m jalousin . ”
114777	114880	114754	114757	a Keith in blood	2852	“ A Keith ca ’ ye her ! It ’s a queer kin ’ o ’ Keiths she ’s comed o ’ , nae better nor Englishers that haena sae muckle ’s set fit in our bonny Scotland ; an ’ sic scriechin ’ , skirlin ’ tongues as they hae , a body wad need to be gleg i ’ the uptak to understan ’ a word they say . Tak ’ my word for’t , Maister Colin , it ’s no a’thegither luve for his lordship ’s grey hairs that gars yon gilpy lassock seek to become my Leddy Keith . ”
114881	114917	114754	114757	a Keith in blood	2852	“ Nay , Tibbie , if you find fault with such a sweet , winning young creature , I shall think it is all because you will not endure a mistress at Gowanbrae over you . ”
114918	114944	114754	114757	a Keith in blood	2852	“ His lordship’ll please himsel ’ wi ’ a leddy to be mistress o ’ Gowanbrae , but auld Tibbie’ll never cross the doorstane mair . ”
114945	114980	114754	114757	a Keith in blood	2852	“ Indeed you will , Tibbie ; here are my brother ’s orders that you should go down , as soon as you can conveniently make ready , and see about the new plenishing . ”
114981	115135	114754	114757	a Keith in blood	2852	“ They may see to the plenishing that ’s to guide it after han , an ’ that ’ll no be me . My lord’ll behove to tak ’ his orders aff his young leddy ance he ’s married on her , may be a whilie afore , but that ’s no to bind ither folk , an ’ it ’s no to be thought that at my years I ’m to be puttin ’ up wi ’ a ’ ther new fangled English fykes an ’ nonsense maggots . Na , na , Maister Colin , his lordship’ll fend weel aneugh wantin ’ Tibbie ; an ’ what for suld I leave yerself , an ’ you settin ’ up wi ’ a house o ’ yer ain ? Deed an ’ my mind ’s made up , I ’ll e’en bide wi ’ ye , an ’ nae mair about it . ”
115136	115141	115143	115143	Colin	305	“ Stay , stay , ”
115152	115177	115143	115143	Colin	305	“ do n’t reckon without your host , Tibbie . Do you think Gowanbrae the second is never to have any mistress but yourself ? ”
115178	115297	115149	115149	his	305	“ Haud awa ’ wi ’ ye , laddie , I ken fine what ye’ra ettlin ’ at , but yon ’s a braw leddy , no like thae English folk , but a woman o ’ understandin ’ , an ’ mair by token I ’m thinkin ’ she ’ll be gleg aneugh to ken a body that ’ll serve her weel , an ’ see to the guidin ’ o ’ thae feckless queens o ’ servant lasses , for bad ’s the best o ’ them ye’ll fin ’ hereawa ’ . Nae fear but her an ’ me’ll put it up weel thegither , an ’ a ’ gude be wi ’ ye baith . ”
115758	115788	115751	115751	she	975	“ What is it , my dear ? That dog is not barking at you . He only wants to have a stick thrown into the sea for him . ”
115789	115798	115817	115818	the Colonel	1244	“ Oh not the dog ! It was — ”
115799	115804	115817	115818	the Colonel	1244	“ Was , what ? ”
115805	115808	115810	115810	Rose	186	“ HIM ! ”
115812	115815	115817	115818	the Colonel	1244	“ Who ? ”
115833	115837	115817	115818	the Colonel	1244	“ Mr. Maddox . ”
115838	115847	115817	115818	the Colonel	1244	“ My dear child ! Which , where ? ”
115848	115872	115817	115818	the Colonel	1244	“ He is gone ! he is past . Oh , do n’t turn back ! Do n’t let me see him again . ”
115873	115886	115817	115818	the Colonel	1244	“ You do n’t suppose he could hurt you , my dear . ”
115887	115890	115892	115892	Rose	186	“ No , ”
115894	115899	115892	115892	Rose	186	“ not with you . ”
115900	115906	115817	115818	the Colonel	1244	“ Nor with any one . ”
115907	115912	115914	115914	Rose	186	“ I suppose not , ”
115927	115943	115945	115946	the Colonel	1244	“ Would it distress you very much to try to point him out to me ? ”
115954	115967	115949	115949	his	1244	“ I will . Only keep hold of my hand , pray , ”
116016	116024	116008	116008	she	186	“ No , he was not there . ”
116058	116080	116054	116054	he	1244	“ My dear , why are you so much afraid , of this person ? What do you know about him ? ”
116081	116090	116092	116092	Rose	186	“ He told wicked stories of my papa , ”
116097	116120	116092	116092	Rose	186	“ True , but he could not hurt you . You do n’t think he goes about like Red Ridinghood ’s wolf ? ”
116121	116131	116054	116054	he	1244	“ No , I am not so silly now . ”
116132	116151	116054	116054	he	1244	“ Are you sure you know him ? Did you often see him in your papa ’s house ? ”
116152	116169	116092	116092	Rose	186	“ No , he was always in the laboratory , and I might not go there . ”
116170	116197	116054	116054	he	1244	“ Then you see , Rose , it must be mere fancy that you saw him , for you could not even know him by sight . ”
116198	116204	116206	116206	Rose	186	“ It was not fancy , ”
116224	116229	116231	116232	Colonel Keith	207	“ My dear child , ”
116240	116263	116231	116232	Colonel Keith	207	“ you must try to be reasonable . How can you possibly recognise a man that you tell me you never saw ? ”
116264	116275	116277	116277	Rose	186	“ I said I never saw him in the house , ”
116282	116302	116277	116277	Rose	186	“ but they said if ever I told they would give me to the lions in the Zoological Gardens . ”
116303	116308	116231	116232	Colonel Keith	207	“ Who said so ? ”
116309	116317	116318	116318	she	186	“ He , Mr. Maddox and Maria , ”
116331	116354	116318	116318	she	186	“ But you are old and wise enough now to know what a foolish and wicked threat that was , my dear . ”
116355	116397	116398	116398	Colin	236	“ Yes , I was a little girl then , and knew no better , and once I did tell a lie when mamma asked me , and now she is dead , and I can never tell her the truth . ”
116498	116516	116538	116538	Rose	186	“ Now tell me all about it , my dear little girl . Who was this Maria ? ”
116517	116536	116538	116538	Rose	186	“ Maria was my nurse when I lived at home . She used to take me out walking , ”
116558	116561	116562	116562	he	2890	“ Well , ”
116569	116580	116562	116562	he	2890	“ and was it than that you saw this Maddox ? ”
116581	116727	116538	116538	Rose	186	“ Yes , he used to come and walk with us , and sit under the trees in Kensington Gardens with her . And sometimes he gave me lemon - drops , but they said if ever I told , the lions should have me . I used to think I might be saved like Daniel ; but after I told the lie , I knew I should not . Mamma asked me why my fingers were sticky , and I did say it was from a lemon - drop , but there were Maria ’s eyes looking at me ; oh , so dreadful , and when mamma asked who gave it to me , and Maria said , ‘ I did , did not I , Miss Rose ? ’ Oh , I did not seem able to help saying ‘ yes . ’ ”
116728	116742	116873	116873	She	186	“ Poor child ! And you never dared to speak of it again ? ”
116743	116776	116562	116562	he	2890	“ Oh , no ! I did long to tell ; but , oh , one night it was written up in letters of fire , ‘ Beware of the Lions . ’ ”
116777	116788	116562	116562	he	2890	“ Terror must have set you dreaming , my dear . ”
116789	116792	116794	116794	Rose	186	“ No , ”
116798	116872	116873	116873	She	186	“ I was quite awake . Papa and mamma were gone out to dine and sleep , and Maria would put me to bed half an hour too soon . She read me to sleep , but by - and - by I woke up , as I always did at mamma ’s bed time , and the candle was gone , and there were those dreadful letters in light over the door . ”
116894	116919	116879	116879	he	2894	“ I jumped up , and screamed , and opened the door ; but there they were growling in papa ’s dressing - room . ”
116920	116937	116562	116562	he	2890	“ They , the lions ? Oh , Rose , you must know that was impossible . ”
116938	116972	116562	116562	he	2890	“ No , I did not see any lions , but I heard the growl , and Mr. Maddox coughed , and said , ‘ Here they come , ’ and growled again . ”
116973	116978	116879	116879	he	2894	“ And you — ? ”
116979	117009	116562	116562	he	2890	“ I tumbled into bed again , and rolled up my head in the clothes , and prayed that it might be day , and it was at last ! ”
117010	117035	116562	116562	he	2890	“ Poor child ! Indeed , Rose , I do not wonder at your terror , I never heard of a more barbarous trick . ”
117036	117042	117044	117044	Rose	186	“ Was it a trick ? ”
117054	117076	117044	117044	Rose	186	“ Did you never hear of writing in phosphorus , a substance that shines at night as the sea sometimes does ? ”
117077	117106	116562	116562	he	2890	“ Aunt Ailie has a book with a story about writing in fiery letters , but it frightened me so much that I never read to the end . ”
117107	117136	116562	116562	he	2890	“ Bring it to me , and we will read it together , and then you will see that such a cruel use can be made of phosphorus . ”
117137	117144	117146	117146	Rose	186	“ It was unkind of them , ”
117150	117160	117146	117146	Rose	186	“ I wonder if they did it for fun ? ”
117161	117167	116562	116562	he	2890	“ Where did you sleep ? ”
117168	117180	116562	116562	he	2890	“ I had a little room that opened into mamma ’s . ”
117181	117189	116562	116562	he	2890	“ And where was all this growling ? ”
117190	117234	116562	116562	he	2890	“ In papa ’s room . The door was just opposite to mine , and was open . All the light was there , you know . Mamma ’s room was dark , but there was a candle in the dressing - room . ”
117235	117241	116562	116562	he	2890	“ Did you see anything ? ”
117242	117279	116562	116562	he	2890	“ Only the light . It was such a moment . I do n’t think I saw Mr. Maddox , but I am quite certain I heard him , for he had an odd little cough . ”
117280	117310	117311	117311	She	2895	“ Then , Rose , I have little doubt that all this cruelty to you , poor inoffensive little being , was to hide some plots against your father . ”
117330	117349	117311	117311	She	2895	“ Then if I had been brave and told the truth , he might never have hurt papa . ”
117350	117379	116562	116562	he	2890	“ Mind , I do not know , and I never thought of blaming you , the chief sufferer ! No , do n’t begin to cry again . ”
117380	117399	117400	117400	she	2895	“ Ah ! but I did tell a lie . And I never can confess it to mamma , ”
117452	117464	117465	117465	he	2896	“ And now you will not fear to tell your aunt , ”
117468	117483	117465	117465	he	2896	“ only it should be when you can mention it without such sad crying . ”
117484	117495	117497	117497	Rose	186	“ Telling you is almost as good as telling her , ”
117499	117507	117508	117508	she	186	“ and I feel safe with you , ”
117518	117534	117508	117508	she	186	“ Please tell Aunt Ermine , for my crying does give her such a headache . ”
117535	117556	117465	117465	he	2896	“ I will , then , and I think when we all know it , the terrors will leave you . ”
117557	117615	117465	117465	he	2896	“ Not when I see Mr. Maddox . Oh , please now you know why , do n’t make me walk without you . I do know now that he could not do anything to me , but I ca n’t help feeling the fright . And , oh ! if he was to speak to me ! ”
117616	117625	117508	117508	she	186	“ You have not seen him here before ? ”
117626	117679	117465	117465	he	2896	“ Yes I have , at least I think so . Once when Aunt Ermine sent me to the post - office , and another time on the esplanade . That is why I ca n’t bear going out without you or Aunt Ailie . Indeed , it is not disliking Tibbie . ”
117680	117731	117465	117465	he	2896	“ I see it is not , my dear , and we will say no more about it till you have conquered your alarm ; but remember , that he is not likely to know you again . You must be more changed in these three years than he is . ”
117746	117758	117741	117741	her	186	“ Please , are my eyes very red for going home ? ”
117759	117804	117465	117465	he	2896	“ Somewhat mottled — something of the York and Lancaster rose . Shall I leave you under Tibbie ’s care till the maiden blush complexion returns , and come back and fetch you when you have had a grand exhibition of my Indian curiosities ? ”
117805	117819	117465	117465	he	2896	“ Have you Indian curiosities ! I thought they were only for ladies ? ”
117820	117851	117741	117741	her	186	“ Perhaps they are . Is Tibbie guard enough ? You know there ’s an Irish sergeant in the house taller than I am , if you want a garrison ? ”
117852	117864	117465	117465	he	2896	“ Oh , I am not afraid , only these eyes . ”
117865	117882	117741	117741	her	186	“ I will tell her you have been frightened , and she shall take no notice . ”
118040	118098	118024	118025	The Colonel	1244	“ No , it was not discovered till after her departure . Her fate has always been a great grief to us , though we little thought her capable of using Rose in this way . She was one of the Hathertons . You must remember the name , and the pretty picturesque hovel on the Heath . ”
118099	118120	118666	118667	the Colonel	1244	“ The squatters that were such a grievance to my uncle . Always suspected of poaching , and never caught . ”
118121	118185	118024	118025	The Colonel	1244	“ Exactly . Most of the girls turned out ill , but this one , the youngest , was remarkably intelligent and attractive at school . I remember making an excuse for calling her into the garden for you to see and confess that English beauty exceeded Scottish , and you called her a gipsy and said we had no right to her . ”
118186	118202	118024	118025	The Colonel	1244	“ So it was those big black eyes that had that fiendish malice in them ! ”
118203	118379	118666	118667	the Colonel	1244	“ Ah ! if she fell into Maddox ’s hands , I wonder the less . She showed an amount of feeling about my illness that won Ailie ’s heart , and we had her for a little handmaid to help my nurse . Then , when we broke up from home , we still kept her , and every one used to be struck with her looks and manner . She went on as well as possible , and Lucy set her heart on having her in the nursery . And when the upper nurse went away , she had the whole care of Rose . We heard only of her praises till , to our horror , we found she had been sent away in disgrace at a moment ’s warning . Poor Lucy was young , and so much shocked as only to think of getting her out of the house , not of what was to become of her , and all we could learn was that she never went home . ”
118380	118389	118024	118025	The Colonel	1244	“ How long was this before the crash ? ”
118390	118429	118024	118025	The Colonel	1244	“ It was only a few weeks before the going abroad , but they had been absent nearly a year . No doubt Maddox must have made her aid in his schemes . You say Rose saw him ? ”
118430	118457	118666	118667	the Colonel	1244	“ So she declares , and there is an accuracy of memory about her that I should trust to . Should you or Alison know him ? ”
118458	118496	118666	118667	the Colonel	1244	“ No , we used to think it a bad sign that Edward never showed him to us . I remember Alison being disappointed that he was not at the factory the only time she saw it . ”
118497	118524	118024	118025	The Colonel	1244	“ I do not like going away while he may be lurking about . I could send a note to - night , explaining my absence . ”
118525	118530	118532	118532	Ermine	170	“ No , no , ”
118534	118611	118532	118532	Ermine	170	“ that would be making me as bad as poor little Rose . If he be here ever so much he has done his worst , and Edward is out of his reach . What could he do to us ? The affairs were wound up long ago , and we have literally nothing to be bullied out of . No , I do n’t think he could make me believe in lions in any shape . ”
118612	118626	118024	118025	The Colonel	1244	“ You strong - minded woman ! You want to emulate the Rachel . ”
118627	118633	118635	118635	Ermine	170	“ You have brought her , ”
118653	118662	118663	118663	she	128	“ I was in hopes of meeting you , ”
118669	118683	118685	118685	she	128	“ I wanted to ask you to take charge of some of these ; ”
118693	118699	118024	118025	The Colonel	1244	“ Journal of Female Industry , ”
118732	118736	118738	118738	Rachel	128	“ I hoped , ”
118740	118834	118738	118738	Rachel	128	“ to have begun with the year , but we are not forward enough , and indeed some of the expenses require a subscription in advance . A subscriber in advance will have the year ’s numbers for ten shillings , instead of twelve ; and I should be much obliged if you would distribute a few of these at Bath , and ask Bessie to do the same . I shall set her name down at the head of the list , as soon as she has qualified it for a decoy . ”
118835	118846	118685	118685	she	128	“ Are these printed at the F. U. E. E. ? ”
118847	118912	118914	118914	she	2906	“ No , we have not funds as yet . Mr. Mauleverer had them done at Bristol , where he has a large connexion as a lecturer , and expects to get many subscribers . I brought these down as soon as he had left them with me , in hopes that you would kindly distribute them at the wedding . And I wished , ”
118918	118929	118914	118914	she	2906	“ to ask you to contribute to our first number . ”
118930	118934	118685	118685	she	128	“ Thank you , ”
118946	118996	118940	118940	Rachel	128	“ I know you write a great deal , and I am sure you must produce something worthy to see the light . I have no scruple in making the request , as I know Colonel Keith agrees with me that womanhood need not be an extinguisher for talent . ”
118997	119005	119006	119006	Ermine	170	“ I am not afraid of him , ”
119019	119050	119051	119051	she	170	“ Then if you would only entrust me with some of your fugitive reflections , I have no doubt that something might be made of them . A practised hand , ”
119059	119070	119051	119051	she	170	“ can always polish away any little roughnesses from inexperience . ”
119103	119110	119095	119095	she	170	“ I ca n’t plead inexperience . ”
119111	119114	119116	119116	Rachel	128	“ No ! ”
119118	119128	119116	119116	Rachel	128	“ You have written ; you have not published ! ”
119129	119142	119144	119144	Ermine	170	“ I was forced to do whatever brought grist to the mill , ”
119146	119149	119150	119150	she	170	“ Indeed , ”
119162	119190	119150	119150	she	170	“ our secrets have been hardly fair towards you , but we made it a rule not to spoil our breadwinner ’s trade by confessing my enormities . ”
119191	119196	119198	119199	the Colonel	1244	“ I assure you , ”
119208	119243	119198	119199	the Colonel	1244	“ I do n’t know how long this cautious person would have kept me in the dark if she had not betrayed herself in the paper we discussed the first day I met you . ”
119244	119250	119252	119252	Rachel	128	“ The ‘ Traveller , ’ ”
119263	119271	119252	119252	Rachel	128	“ She is the ‘ Invalid ’ ! ”
119272	119287	119289	119289	Ermine	170	“ There , I am glad to have made a clean breast of it , ”
119291	119297	119299	119299	Rachel	128	“ The ‘ Invalid ’ ! ”
119301	119311	119299	119299	Rachel	128	“ It is as bad as the Victoria Cross . ”
119312	119328	119330	119330	Colin	236	“ There is a compliment , Ermine , for which you should make your bow , ”
119332	119341	119343	119343	Rachel	128	“ Oh , I did not mean that , ”
119345	119383	119385	119385	she	128	“ but that it was as great a mistake as I made about Captain Keith , when I told him his own story , and denied his being the hero , till I actually saw his cross , ”
119400	119412	119385	119385	she	128	“ I wonder why I am fated to make such mistakes ! ”
119413	119417	119419	119419	Ermine	170	“ Preconceived notions , ”
119423	119437	119419	119419	Ermine	170	“ your theory suffices you , and you do n’t see small indications . ”
119438	119446	119448	119448	Rachel	128	“ There may be something in that , ”
119452	119465	119448	119448	Rachel	128	“ it accounts for Grace always seeing things faster than I did . ”
119466	119479	119481	119482	the Colonel	1244	“ Did Mr. — , your philanthropist , bring you this today ? ”
119503	119557	119558	119558	Ermine	170	“ Mr. Mauleverer ? Yes ; I came down as soon as he had left me , only calling first upon Fanny . I am very anxious for contributions . If you would only give me a paper signed by the ‘ Invalid , ’ it would be a fortune to the institution . ”
119594	119597	119599	119600	the Colonel	1244	“ Intolerable ! ”
119602	119653	119599	119600	the Colonel	1244	“ She was improving under Bessie ’s influence , but she has broken out worse than ever . ‘ Journal of Female Industry ! ’ ‘ Journal of a Knight of Industry , ’ might be a better title . You will have nothing to do with it , Ermine ? ”
119654	119679	119564	119564	she	170	“ Certainly not as the ‘ Invalid , ’ but I owe her something for having let her run into this scrape before you . ”
119680	119703	119599	119600	the Colonel	1244	“ As if you could have hindered her ! Come , do n’t waste time and brains on a companion for Curatocult . ”
119704	119742	119599	119600	the Colonel	1244	“ You make me so idle and frivolous that I shall be expelled from the ‘ Traveller , ’ and obliged to take refuge in the ‘ Female Industry Journal . ’ Shall you distribute the prospectuses ? ”
119743	119759	119564	119564	she	170	“ I shall give one to Bessie ! That is if I go at all . ”
119760	119799	119599	119600	the Colonel	1244	“ No , no , there is no valid reason for staying away . Even if we were sure that Rose was right , nothing could well come of it , and your absence would be most invidious . ”
119800	119832	119599	119600	the Colonel	1244	“ I believe I am wanted to keep Master Alick in order , but if you have the least feeling that you would be more at ease with me at home — ”
119833	119841	119843	119843	Ermine	170	“ That is not a fair question , ”
119847	119858	119843	119843	Ermine	170	“ You know very well that you ought to go . ”
119859	119870	119872	119873	the Colonel	1244	“ And I shall try to bring back Harry Beauchamp , ”
119875	119885	119872	119873	the Colonel	1244	“ He would be able to identify the fellow . ”
119886	119898	119843	119843	Ermine	170	“ I do not know what would be gained by that . ”
119899	119907	119872	119873	the Colonel	1244	“ I should know whom to watch . ”

120871	120890	120860	120860	Alison	180	“ Who knows what may be done to those poor children ? Ca n’t Mr. Mitchell do something ? ”
121105	121111	121088	121097	a rude , slatternly , half - witted looking charwoman	2960	“ Master was not in , ”
121336	121344	121317	121318	Mrs. Rawlins	298	“ Show the gentleman , my dear , ”
121411	121452	121405	121406	Mrs. Rawlins	298	“ Ah ! Mary is ashamed to tell : but the gentleman will think nothing of it , my dear . He knows that children will be children , and I can not bear to check them , the dears . ”
121555	121574	121538	121538	She	128	“ She is a handsome woman , and reminds me strongly of a face I saw in India . ”
121575	121592	121594	121594	Rachel	128	“ There are some classes of beauty and character that have a remarkable sameness of feature , ”
121596	121633	121594	121594	Rachel	128	“ Do n’t push that theory , for your matron ’s likeness was a very handsome Sepoy havildar whom we took at Lucknow , a capital soldier before the mutiny , and then an ineffable ruffian . ”
121634	121653	121665	121665	Rachel	128	“ The mutiny was an infectious frenzy ; so that you establish nothing against that cast of countenance . ”
121807	121813	121814	121815	Mrs. Kelland	189	“ It was not right , ”
121818	121861	121814	121815	Mrs. Kelland	189	“ that the poor lone orphan should not see her that was as good as a mother , when she had no one else to look to . They that kept her from her did n’t do it for no good end . ”
121862	121872	121814	121815	Mrs. Kelland	189	“ But , Mrs. Kelland , rules are rules . ”
121873	121949	121814	121815	Mrs. Kelland	189	“ Do n’t tell me of no rules , Miss Rachel , as would cut a poor child off from her friends as her mother gave her to on her death - bed . ‘ Sally , ’ says she , ‘ I know you will do a mother ’s part by that poor little maid ; ’ and so I did till I was over persuaded to let her go to that there place . ”
121950	121979	121814	121815	Mrs. Kelland	189	“ Indeed you have nothing to regret there , Mrs. Kelland ; you know , that with the kindest intentions , you could not make the child happy . ”
121980	122051	121814	121815	Mrs. Kelland	189	“ And why was that , ma’am , but because her mother was a poor creature from town , that had never broke her to her work . I never had the trouble with a girl of my own I had with her . ‘ It ’s all for your good , Lovedy , ’ I says to her , and poor child , maybe she wishes herself back again . ”
122052	122117	121814	121815	Mrs. Kelland	189	“ I assure you , I always find the children well and happy , and it is very unfair on the matron to be angry with her for being bound by rules , to which she must submit , or she would transgress the regulations under which we have laid her ! It is not her choice to exclude you , but her duty . ”
122118	122153	122155	122156	Mrs. Kelland	189	“ Please , ma’am , was it her duty to be coming out of the house in a ‘ genta coloured silk dress , and a drab bonnet with a pink feather in it ? ”
122173	122187	122155	122156	Mrs. Kelland	189	“ You do n’t know what you are talking about , Mrs. Kelland . ”
122188	122259	121814	121815	Mrs. Kelland	189	“ Well , ma’am , it was a very decent woman as told me , an old lady of the name of Drinkwater , as keeps a baker ’s shop on the other side of the way , and she never sees bread enough go in for a cat to make use of , let alone three poor hungry children . She says all is not right there , ma’am . ”
122260	122336	122337	122337	Rachel	128	“ Oh , that must be mere gossip and spite at not having the custom . It quite accounts for what she may say , and indeed you brought it all on yourself by not having asked me for a note . You must restrain yourself . What you may say to me is of no importance , but you must not go and attack those who are doing the very best for your niece . ”
122359	122417	122355	122357	tearful Mrs. Morris	334	“ Oh , Miss Rachel , if it would not be displeasing to you , would you give me an order for my child to come home . Ours is a poor place , but I would rather make any shift for us to live than that she should be sent away to some place beyond sea . ”
122418	122424	122337	122337	Rachel	128	“ Some place beyond sea ! ”
122425	122521	122355	122357	tearful Mrs. Morris	334	“ Yes , ma’am . I beg your pardon , ma’am , but they do say that Mr. Maw - and - liver is a kidnapper , ma’am , and that he gets them poor children to send out to Botany Bay to be wives to the convicts as are transported , Miss Rachel , if you ’ll excuse it . They say there ’s a whole shipload of them at Plymouth , and I ’d rather my poor Mary came to the Union at home than to the like of that , Miss Rachel . ”

123432	123436	123438	123438	Rachel	128	“ Of course , ”
123440	123451	123438	123438	Rachel	128	“ it is a reminiscence of the painting there represented . ”

123543	123549	123550	123550	she	127	“ Athanasius against the world , ”
123553	123569	123571	123571	Ermine	186	“ Athanasius should take care that his own foot is firm , his position incontrovertible , ”
123573	123576	123571	123571	Ermine	186	“ Well ! ”
123577	123580	123582	123582	Ermine	186	“ Then , ”
123584	123596	123582	123582	Ermine	186	“ will you allow these little pictures to be examined into ? ”
123597	123606	123571	123571	Ermine	186	“ I do n’t know what you mean . ”
123607	123611	123613	123614	the Colonel	1244	“ Look here , ”
123654	123662	123663	123663	he	1244	“ Who did that , my dear ? ”
123666	123671	123673	123673	Rose	186	“ Mamma had it , ”
123677	123689	123673	123673	Rose	186	“ it was always in my old nursery scrap - hook . ”
123690	123695	123697	123697	Rachel	128	“ Every one knows , ”
123699	123726	123697	123697	Rachel	128	“ that a woodcut is often like an etching , and an etching like a woodcut . I do not know what you are driving at . ”
123727	123734	123736	123736	Alick	125	“ The little dogs and all , ”
123755	123759	123761	123761	Rachel	128	“ I know , ”
123763	123842	123761	123761	Rachel	128	“ that there is a strong prejudice against Mr. Mauleverer , and that it is entertained by many whom I should have hoped to see above such weakness but when I brought these tangible productions of his system , as evidence of his success , I did not expect to see them received with a covert distrust , which I own I do not understand . I perceive now why good works find so much difficulty in prospering . ”
123843	123847	123849	123850	Alick Keith	125	“ I believe , ”
123852	123868	123849	123850	Alick Keith	125	“ that I am to have the honour of dining at the Homestead on Monday ? ”
123869	123894	123761	123761	Rachel	128	“ Yes . The Greys spend the day with us , and it is Emily ’s due to have a good sight of you . ”
123895	123974	123761	123761	Rachel	128	“ Then will you let me in the meantime take my own measures with regard to these designs . I will not hurt or injure them in any way ; they shall be deposited here in Miss William ’s hands , and I promise you that if I have been able to satisfy myself as to the means of their production , Simon Skinflint shall become a subscriber to the F. U. E. E. Is it a bargain ? ”
123975	123983	123985	123985	Rachel	128	“ I never made such a bargain , ”
123989	123999	123985	123985	Rachel	128	“ Is that a reason for not doing so ? ”
124000	124026	123761	123761	Rachel	128	“ I do n’t know what you mean to do . Not to molest that poor Mrs. Rawlins . I will not have that done . ”
124027	124072	123761	123761	Rachel	128	“ Certainly not . All I ask of you is that these works of art should remain here with Miss Williams , as a safe neutral , and that you should meet me here on Monday , when I will undertake to convince myself . ”
124073	124077	124079	124079	Rachel	128	“ Not me ? ”
124081	124095	124079	124079	Rachel	128	“ Who would make it part of his terms to convince a lady ? ”
124096	124102	124104	124104	Rachel	128	“ You mean to say , ”
124109	124123	124136	124136	Ermine	186	“ that as a woman , I am incapable of being rationally convinced ! ”
124124	124134	124136	124136	Ermine	186	“ The proverb does not only apply to women , ”
124158	124194	124144	124144	Rachel	128	continued—“Let the proof be convincing , and I will meet it as candidly as it is the duty of all reasonable beings to do . Only let me first know what you mean to prove . ”
124195	124295	124296	124296	Ho	355	“ The terms are these then , are they not , Miss Williams ? I am to come on Monday , February the 5th , prepared to test whether these designs are what they profess to be , and Miss Curtis undertakes to be convinced by that proof , provided it be one that should carry conviction to a clear , unbiassed mind . I undertake , on the other hand , that if the said proof should be effectual , a mythical personage called Simon Skinflint shall become a supporter of the Female Union for Englishwomen ’s Employment . ”
124364	124403	124361	124361	Rachel	128	“ Well , I consent , provided that my candour be met by equal candour on the other side , and you will promise that if this ordeal succeeds , you will lay aside all prejudice against Mauleverer . ”
124576	124631	124555	124555	she	138	“ I should much like to see how it will turn out . I do believe that there is some difference in the colour of the ink in the middle and at the edge , and if those people are deceiving Rachel , who knows what they may be doing to the poor children ? ”
124678	124700	124701	124701	she	138	“ It really is dreadful to have sent those little girls there without any one knowing what anybody does to them , ”
124704	124716	124718	124719	the Colonel	1244	“ It makes even Alick come out in a new character , ”
124726	124729	124718	124719	the Colonel	1244	“ Why , ”
124733	124795	124718	124719	the Colonel	1244	“ my sister had so much to do with letting the young lady in for the scrape , that it is just as well to try to get her out of it . In fact , I think we have all sat with our hands before us in a shamefully cool manner , till we are all accountable for the humbuggery . ”
124796	124815	124817	124817	Colin	236	“ When it comes to your reproaching us with coolness , Captain Keith , the matter becomes serious , ”
124819	124825	124817	124817	Colin	236	“ It does become serious , ”
124830	124891	124817	124817	Colin	236	“ it is hard that a person without any natural adviser should have been allowed to run headlong , by force of her own best qualities , into the hands of a sharper . I do not see how a man of any proper feeling , can stand by without doing something to prevent the predicament from becoming any worse . ”
124892	124897	124899	124900	Colonel Keith	207	“ If you can , ”
124902	124907	124909	124909	Alick	125	“ I verily believe , ”
124916	124931	124909	124909	Alick	125	“ that the worse it is for her , the more you enjoy it ! ”
124932	124936	124938	124938	Ermine	186	“ Quite true , ”
124944	124995	124938	124938	Ermine	186	“ it is a true case of man ’s detestation of clever women ! Look here , Alick , we will not have him here at the great ordeal of the woodcuts . You and I are much more candid and unprejudiced people , and shall manage her much better . ”
124996	125005	125007	125008	the Colonel	1244	“ I have no desire to be present , ”
125010	125033	125007	125008	the Colonel	1244	“ I have no satisfaction in seeing my friend Alick baffled . I shall see how they both appear at luncheon afterwards . ”
125034	125040	125042	125042	Fanny	127	“ How will that be ? ”
125046	125086	125097	125097	Alick	125	“ The lady will be sententious and glorious , and will recommend the F. U. E. E. more than ever , and Alick will cover the downfall of his crest by double - edged assents to all her propositions . ”
125087	125095	125097	125097	Alick	125	“ You will not have that pleasure , ”
125099	125107	125097	125097	Alick	125	“ I only go to dinner there . ”
125108	125113	125115	125116	the Colonel	1244	“ At any rate , ”
125118	125140	125115	125116	the Colonel	1244	“ supposing your test takes effect by some extraordinary chance , do n’t take any further steps without letting me know . ”
125198	125216	125217	125217	she	128	“ I am ready to submit to any test that Captain Keith may require to confute himself , ”
125222	125316	125217	125217	she	128	“ and I do so the more readily that with all his mocking language , there is a genuine candour and honesty beneath that would be quite worth convincing . I believe that if once persuaded of the injustice of his suspicions he would in the reaction become a fervent supporter of Mr. Mauleverer and of the institution ; and though I should prefer carrying on our work entirely through women , yet this interest would be so good a thing for him , that I should by no means reject his assistance . ”
125420	125429	125430	125430	he	258	“ I am sorry to be so late , ”
125433	125445	125430	125430	he	258	“ but I have only now succeeded in procuring my ally . ”
125446	125450	125430	125430	he	258	“ An ally ? ”
125451	125477	125479	125479	he	258	“ Yes , in this book . I had to make interest at the Avoncester Library , before I could take it away with me . ”
125515	125520	125481	125481	he	258	“ Illustrated London News . ”
125550	125554	125556	125556	Rachel	128	“ I see , ”
125558	125572	125556	125556	Rachel	128	“ it is the same figure , but not the same shaped picture . ”
125605	125612	125615	125615	Rachel	128	“ I perceive a great resemblance , ”
125617	125638	125615	125615	Rachel	128	“ but none that is not fully explained by Mr. Mauleverer ’s accurate resemblance and desire to satirize foolish sentiment . ”
125646	125651	125652	125652	he	258	“ I should say , ”
125662	125678	125652	125652	he	258	“ that it was unusual to mount a proof engraving so elaborately on a card . ”
125679	125700	125615	125615	Rachel	128	“ Oh , I see what your distrust is driving at ; you suspect the designs of being pasted on . ”
125701	125710	125712	125712	Alick	125	“ There is such a test as water , ”
125714	125733	125712	125712	Alick	125	“ I should be ashamed to return the proof to its master , bearing traces of unjust suspicion . ”
125734	125754	125822	125822	she	128	“ If the suspicion you impute to me be unjust , the water will produce no effect at all . ”
125755	125777	125822	125822	she	128	“ And you engage to retract all your distrust and contempt , if you are convinced that this engraving is genuine ? ”
125778	125782	125783	125783	he	258	“ I do , ”
125830	125842	125822	125822	she	128	“ There , now I suppose I may wipe it off . ”
125975	125981	125983	125983	her	128	“ What does it mean ? ”
125993	126000	125983	125983	her	128	“ Well , do you triumph ? ”
126001	126009	126011	126011	Ermine	186	“ I am very , very sorry , ”
126013	126026	126028	126028	Rachel	128	“ I do not know that it is come to that yet , ”
126035	126046	126033	126033	herself	128	“ I may have been pressing too hard for results . ”
126062	126083	126033	126033	herself	128	“ But it is a deception ! A deception ! Oh ! he need not have done it ! Or , ”
126093	126107	126033	126033	herself	128	“ suppose he did it to see whether I should find it out ? ”
126108	126119	126121	126121	Ermine	186	“ He is hardly on terms with you for that , ”
126131	126147	126124	126124	Alick	125	“ Then he would be a more insolent scoundrel than he has shown himself yet . ”
126148	126158	126160	126160	Rachel	128	“ I know he is not quite a gentleman , ”
126162	126198	126124	126124	Alick	125	“ and nothing else gives the instinct of the becoming . You have conquered , Captain Keith , if it be any pleasure to you to have given my trust and hope a cruel shock . ”
126199	126206	126207	126207	he	125	“ With little satisfaction to myself , ”
126216	126305	126213	126213	she	128	“ A shock , a shock I say , no more ; I do not know what conclusion I ought to draw . I do not expect you to believe in this person till he has cleared up the deceit . If it be only a joke in bad taste , he deserves the distrust that is the penalty for it . If you have been opening my eyes to a deception , perhaps I shall thank you for it some day . I must think it over . ”
126341	126368	126337	126337	he	125	“ There is a great deal of dignity in the strict justice of a mind slow to condemn , or to withdraw the trust once given . ”
126369	126373	126375	126375	Ermine	186	“ There is , ”
126387	126414	126375	126375	Ermine	186	“ there has been full and real candour , not flying into the other extreme . I am afraid she has a great deal to suffer . ”
126415	126432	126434	126434	Alick	125	“ It was very wrong to have stood so still when the rascal began his machinations , ”
126436	126460	126434	126434	Alick	125	“ Bessie absolutely helping it on ! But for her , the fellow would have had no chance even of acquaintance with her . ”
126461	126470	126488	126488	he	125	“ Your sister hardly deserves blame for that . ”
126471	126481	126482	126482	he	125	“ Not exactly blame ; but the responsibility remains , ”
126776	126787	126770	126770	Grace	127	“ Oh , Rachel dear , Mrs. Rossitur is here . ”
126788	126810	126770	126770	Grace	127	“ I think old servants have a peculiar propensity for turning up when the house is in a state of turmoil , ”
126814	126835	126837	126837	Grace	127	“ I have been walking round the garden with her , and doing my best to suffice for her entertainment , ”
126843	126871	126837	126837	Grace	127	“ but she really wants to see you on business . She has a bill for the F. U. E. E. which she wants you to pay . ”
126872	126882	126770	126770	Grace	127	“ A bill for the F. U. E. E. ? ”
126883	126916	126837	126837	Grace	127	“ Yes ; she makes many apologies for troubling you , but Tom is to be apprenticed to a grocer , and they want this fifteen pounds to make up the fee . ”
126917	126949	126837	126837	Grace	127	“ But I tell you , Grace , there ca n’t have been fifteen pounds ’ worth of things had in this month , and they were paid on the 1st . ”
126950	126966	126770	126770	Grace	127	“ She says they have never been paid at all since the 1st of December . ”
126967	127045	126837	126837	Grace	127	“ I assure you , Grace , it is in the books . I made a point of having all the accounts brought to me on the 1st of every month , and giving out the money . I gave out £ 3 . 10s . for the Rossiturs last Friday , the 1st of February , when Mr. Mauleverer was over here . He said coals were dearer , and they had to keep more fires . ”
127046	127053	127055	127055	Grace	127	“ There must be some mistake , ”
127057	127109	127055	127055	Grace	127	“ I ’ll show you the books . Mr. Mauleverer keeps one himself , and leaves one with me . Oh , botheration , there ’s the Grey carriage ! Well , you go and receive them , and I ’ll try to pacify Mrs. Rossitur , and then come down . ”
127262	127268	127270	127272	the old servant	3049	“ And , Miss Rachel , ”
127274	127357	127270	127272	the old servant	3049	“ you ’ll excuse me , but they do say very odd things of the matron at that place , and I doubt you are deceived in her . Our lads went to the the - a - ter the other night , and I checked them well for it ; but mother , says they , we had more call to be there than the governess up to Miss Rachel ’s schule in Nichol Street , dressed out in pink feathers . ”
127358	127439	127440	127441	Mrs. Rossitur	357	“ Well , Mrs. Rossitur , I will make every inquiry , and I do not think you will find anything wrong . There must be some one about very like Mrs. Rawlins . I have heard of those pink feathers before , but I know who the matron is , and all about her ! Good - bye . I ’ll see you again before you go , I suppose it wo n’t be till the seven o’clock train . ”
127470	127474	127444	127444	her	357	“ melting day , ”
127503	127607	127487	127487	Rachel	128	“ A mistake , an error . It must be a blunder ! That boy that went to the theatre may have cheated them ! Mrs. Rawlins may have deceived Mr. Mauleverer . Anything must be true rather than — No , no ! such a tissue of deception is impossible in a man of such sentiments ! Persecuted as he has been , shall appearances make me — me , his only friend — turn against him ? Oh , me ! here come the whole posse purring upstairs to take off their things ! I shall be invaded in a moment . ”
127836	127858	127830	127832	the little lady	3070	“ If you do n’t object , Miss Williams , we will go to Rachel ’s asylum on our way home . ”
127869	127872	127874	127875	Lady Temple	138	“ No , ”
127877	127972	127874	127875	Lady Temple	138	“ but you see I ca n’t be satisfied about those woodcuts ; and that poor woman , Mrs. Kelland , came to me yesterday about my lace shawl , and she is sadly distressed about the little girl . She was not allowed to see her , you know , and she heard such odd things about the place that I told her that I did not wonder she was in trouble , and that I would try to bring the child home , or at any rate see and talk to her . ”
127973	127998	127830	127832	the little lady	3070	“ I hope we may be able to see her , but you know Colonel Keith could not get in without making an appointment . ”
127999	128005	128007	128008	Lady Temple	138	“ I pay for her , ”
128010	128054	128007	128008	Lady Temple	138	“ and I can not bear its going on in this way without some one seeing about it . The Colonel was quite sure those woodcuts were mere fabrications to deceive Rachel ; and there must be something very wrong about those people . ”
128055	128064	127830	127832	the little lady	3070	“ Did she know that you were going ? ”
128065	128091	128007	128008	Lady Temple	138	“ No ; I did not see her before we went . I do not think she will mind it much ; and I promised . ”
128105	128136	128092	128093	Lady Temple	138	“ And indeed , after what Mrs. Kelland said , I could not sleep while I thought I had been the means of putting any poor child into such hands . ”
128137	128140	128142	128142	Alison	180	“ Yes , ”
128144	128167	128142	128142	Alison	180	“ it is very shocking to leave them there without inquiry , and it is an excellent thing to make the attempt . ”
128353	128359	128347	128348	the girl	3036	“ This way , ma’am , ”
128452	128459	128538	128538	she	3036	“ Making ready for our reception , ”
128475	128482	128469	128470	Lady Temple	138	“ I do not like it , ”
128484	128500	128469	128470	Lady Temple	138	“ it is very unsatisfactory . No , I do n’t like it at all , ”
128513	128537	128538	128538	she	3036	“ Things must be very sad , or they would never take so much preparation . I ’ll tell you , Miss Williams , ”
128546	128594	128538	128538	she	3036	“ there are two of us , and the woman can not be in two places at once . Now , if you go up and see the rooms and all , which I saw long ago , I could stay and talk to the poor children . ”
128701	128776	128689	128689	she	138	“ Why , my lady , you see Mr. Mauleverer is very particular . I hardly know that I could answer it to him to have one of his little darlings out of his sight . It unsettles a child so to be going home , and Lovedy has a bad cold , my lady , and I am afraid it will run through the house . My little Alice is beginning of it . ”
128985	129001	129003	129003	she	138	“ Oh , yes , ma’am , certainly , though we are rather in confusion , ”
129071	129076	129077	129077	she	138	“ My poor child , ”
129082	129096	129077	129077	she	138	“ you seem very poorly . Have you any message to your aunt ? ”
129097	129102	129104	129104	Lovedy	121	“ Please , please ! ”
129111	129128	129130	129132	the little one	3103	“ Lovedy , do n’t , do n’t be a bad girl , or you know — ”
129139	129145	129147	129148	Lady Temple	138	“ She is not naughty , ”
129151	129156	129147	129148	Lady Temple	138	“ only not well . ”
129157	129165	129130	129132	the little one	3103	“ Please , my lady , look , ”
129206	129211	129213	129213	Alice	361	“ Oh , Lovedy , ”
129215	129223	129213	129213	Alice	361	“ she ’ll take the big stick . ”
129224	129232	129234	129234	Mary	299	“ She could not do her work , ”
129239	129261	129234	129234	Mary	299	“ she is so poorly , and Missus said she would have the twenty sprigs if she sat up all night . ”
129262	129265	129213	129213	Alice	361	“ Sprigs ! ”
129266	129296	129234	129234	Mary	299	“ Yes , ma’am , we makes lace more than ever we did to home , day and night ; and if we do n’t she takes the stick . ”
129297	129302	129304	129305	the child	975	“ Oh , Mary , ”
129307	129316	129304	129305	the child	975	“ she said if you said one word . ”
129317	129320	129322	129323	Lady Temple	138	“ Mary , ”
129329	129335	129322	129323	Lady Temple	138	“ where are your bonnets ? ”
129336	129344	129346	129346	Mary	299	“ We have n’t none , ma’am , ”
129348	129376	129346	129346	Mary	299	“ she pawned them . But , oh , ma’am , please take us away . We are used dreadful bad , and no one knows it . ”
129460	129464	129465	129465	she	138	“ Mrs. Rawlins , ”
129473	129548	129465	129465	she	138	“ I think Lovedy is so poorly that she ought to go home to her aunt to be nursed , and I have taken little Mary that she may not be left behind alone . Please to tell Mr. Mauleverer that I take it all upon myself . The other little girl is not at all to blame , and I hope you will take care of her , for she looks very ill . ”
129626	129658	129618	129618	she	3112	“ My poor , poor little dear ! Francis , dear boy , the wicked people have been beating her ! Oh , Miss Williams , look at her poor neck ! ”
129719	129728	129706	129707	Lady Temple	138	“ Oh , you have been cruelly treated ! ”
129729	129738	129740	129742	the frightened Mary	299	“ Please do n’t let her get us , ”
129744	129761	129740	129742	the frightened Mary	299	“ Never , never , my dear . We are taking you home to your mother . ”
130189	130198	130184	130184	Alison	180	“ I wish it with all my heart ! ”
130382	130422	130376	130376	his	126	“ Oh , Aunt Rachel , your F. U. thing is as bad as the Sepoys . But we have saved the two little girls that they were whipping to death , and have got them in the carriage . ”
130515	130527	130512	130512	her	180	“ O , Colin , Colin , it is Maria Hatherton . ”
130528	130534	130512	130512	her	180	“ What ! the matron ? ”
130535	130558	130512	130512	her	180	“ Yes , the woman that has used these poor children like a savage . O , Colin , it is frightful . ”
130559	130572	130512	130512	her	180	“ You should sit down , you are almost ready to faint . ”
130573	130597	130598	130598	Alison	180	“ Nothing ! nothing ! But the poor girls are in such a state . And that Maria whom we taught , and — ”
130601	130607	130598	130598	Alison	180	“ Did she know you ? ”
130608	130627	130512	130512	her	180	“ I ca n’t tell . Perhaps ; but I did not know her till the last moment . ”
130628	130658	130598	130598	Alison	180	“ I have long believed that the man that Rose recognised was Mauleverer , but I thought the uncertainty would be bad for Ermine . What is all this ? ”
130659	130680	130682	130682	Alison	180	“ You will hear . There ! Listen , I ca n’t tell you ; Lady Temple did it all , ”
130773	130803	130804	130804	she	127	“ Oh , Rachel , dear , I did not mean it to have been so sudden or before them all , but indeed I could not help it , ”
130813	130825	130804	130804	she	127	“ if you only saw that poor dear child ’s neck . ”
130864	130889	130855	130856	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ What is it , my dear ; is it something very sad ? Those poor children look very cold , and half starved . ”
130890	130893	130895	130895	Fanny	127	“ Indeed , ”
130897	130942	130895	130895	Fanny	127	“ they have been starved , and beaten , and cruelly used . I am very sorry , Rachel , but indeed that was a dreadful woman , and I thought Colonel Keith and Mr. Grey would tell us what ought to be done . ”
130943	130947	130949	130950	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Mr. Grey ! ”
130966	130994	130949	130950	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ will you tell us what is to be done ? Here has poor dear Rachel been taken in by this wicked scheme , and these poor — ”
130995	131000	131002	131002	Rachel	128	“ Mother , mother , ”
131009	131022	131002	131002	Rachel	128	“ please not out here , before the servants and every one . ”
131052	131067	131043	131044	Mr. Grey	362	“ Eh ? Then this is Rachel ’s new female asylum , is it ? ”
131068	131100	131106	131106	Fanny	127	“ Yes , I always feared there was something odd about it . I never liked that man , and now — Fanny , my love , what is the matter ? ”
131147	131189	131191	131192	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ And you will commit those wretches . You will send them to prison at once , Mr. Grey . They have been deceiving my poor Rachel ever so long , and getting sums upon sums of money out of her , ”
131200	131218	131220	131221	Mr. Grey	362	“ If there is sufficient occasion I will summon the persons concerned to the Bench on Wednesday , ”
131229	131234	131236	131237	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Not till Wednesday ! ”
131268	131301	131265	131265	she	235	“ but you can take all the examinations here at once , you know ; and Grace can find you a summons paper , if you will just go into the study . ”
131302	131317	131319	131320	Mr. Grey	362	“ It might save the having the children over to - morrow , certainly , ”
131814	131823	131825	131826	the Colonel	1244	“ I saw her with a bruised eye , ”
131834	131839	131825	131826	the Colonel	1244	“ How was that ? ”
131840	131876	131825	131826	the Colonel	1244	“ Please , sir , Mrs. Rawlins hit me with her fist because I had only done seven sprigs . She knocked me down , and I did not come to for ever so long . ”
132062	132098	132057	132058	the Colonel	1244	“ I believe her name to be Maria Hatherton . Miss Williams has recognised her as a servant who once lived in her family , and who came from her father ’s parish at Beauchamp . ”
132157	132163	132166	132167	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ But , Mr. Grey , ”
132169	132226	132166	132167	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ you do n’t mean that you are not going to do anything to that man ! Why he has been worse than the woman ! It was he that entrapped the poor children , and my poor Rachel here , with his stories of magazines and illustrations , and I do n’t know what all ! ”
132227	132234	132236	132237	the magistrate	3192	“ Very true , Mrs. Curtis , ”
132239	132248	132236	132237	the magistrate	3192	“ but where ’s the charge against him ? ”
132791	132802	132764	132764	She	128	“ Mr. Grey , pray let me speak to you ! ”
132825	132834	132835	132835	she	128	“ Must this be done to - day ? ”
132838	132842	132843	132843	he	362	“ Why not ? ”
132846	132902	132843	132843	he	362	“ I want time to think about it . The woman has acted like a fiend , and I have not a word to say for her ; but I can not feel that it is fair , after such long and entire trust of this man , to turn on him suddenly without notice . ”
132903	132913	132915	132916	Mr. Grey	362	“ Do you mean that you will not prosecute ? ”
132928	132955	132925	132925	his	362	“ I have not said so . I want time to make up my mind , and to hear what he has to say for himself . ”
132956	132967	132843	132843	he	362	“ You will hear that at the Bench on Wednesday . ”
132968	132977	132843	132843	he	362	“ It will not be the same thing . ”
132978	132984	132925	132925	his	362	“ I should hope not ! ”
132985	132989	132991	132991	Rachel	128	“ You see , ”
133003	133041	132991	132991	Rachel	128	“ I can not but feel that I have trusted too easily , and perhaps been to blame myself for my implicit confidence , and after that it revolts me to throw the whole blame on another . ”
133042	133058	133060	133061	Mr. Grey	362	“ If you have been a simpleton , does that make him an honest man ? ”
133065	133068	133070	133070	Rachel	128	“ No , ”
133072	133075	133070	133070	Rachel	128	“ but — ”
133076	133079	132991	132991	Rachel	128	“ What ? ”
133080	133089	133090	133090	she	128	“ My credulity may have caused his dishonesty , ”
133105	133112	133114	133115	Mr. Grey	362	“ Look you here , Rachel , ”
133129	133291	133118	133118	himself	362	“ it does not simply lie between you and him — a silly girl who has let herself be taken in by a sharper . That would be no more than giving a sixpence to a fellow that tells me he lost his arm at Sebastopol when he has got it sewn up in a bag . But you have been getting subscriptions from all the world , making yourself answerable to them for having these children educated , and then , for want of proper superintendence , or the merest rational precaution , leaving them to this barbarous usage . I do n’t want to be hard upon you , but you are accountable for all this ; you have made yourself so , and unless you wish to be regarded as a sharer in the iniquity , the least you can do by way of compensation , is not to make yourself an obstruction to the course of justice . ”
133292	133303	133305	133305	Rachel	128	“ I do n’t much care how I am regarded , ”
133314	133337	133305	133305	Rachel	128	“ I only want to do right , and not act spitefully and vindictively before he has had warning to defend himself . ”
133338	133393	133433	133434	her mother	496	“ Or to set off to delude as many equal foo — mistaken people as he can find elsewhere ! Eh , Rachel ? Do n’t you see , it this friend of yours be innocent , a summons will not hurt him , it will only give him the opportunity of clearing himself . ”
133394	133400	133402	133402	Rachel	128	“ Yes , I see , ”
133816	133822	133823	133823	he	3233	“ I had no proof , ”
133826	133892	133823	133823	he	3233	“ You were sure of the woman , but so far it is only guess work with him ; though each time Rose spoke of seeing Maddox coincided with one of Mauleverer ’s visits . Besides , Alison , on the back of that etching in Rose ’s book is written , Mrs. Williams , from her humble and obliged servant , R. Maddox . ’ ”
133893	133901	133805	133805	Alison	180	“ And you said nothing about it ? ”
133902	133921	133805	133805	Alison	180	“ No , I wished to make myself secure , and to see my way before speaking out . ”
133922	133937	133823	133823	he	3233	“ What shall you do ? Can you trust to Rose ’s identifying him ? ”
133938	133994	133805	133805	Alison	180	“ I shall ride in to - morrow to see what is going on , and judge if it will be well to let her see this man , if he have not gone off , as I should fear was only too likely . Poor little Lady Temple , her exploit has precipitated matters . ”
133995	134019	133805	133805	Alison	180	“ And you will let every one , Dr. Long and all , know what a wretch they have believed . And then — ”
134020	134044	133823	133823	he	3233	“ Stay , Alison , I am afraid they will not take Maddox ’s subsequent guilt as a proof of Edward ’s innocence . ”
134045	134058	133823	133823	he	3233	“ It is a proof that his stories were not worth credit . ”
134059	134123	133805	133805	Alison	180	“ To you and me it is , who do not need such proof . It is possible that among his papers something may be found that may implicate him and clear Edward , but we can only hold off and watch . And I greatly fear both man and woman will have slipped through our fingers , especially if she knew you . ”
134124	134137	134139	134139	Alison	180	“ Poor Maria , who could have thought of such frightful barbarity ? ”
134141	134161	134162	134162	She	180	“ I knew she was a passionate girl , but this is worse than one can bear to believe . ”
134183	134191	134192	134192	she	180	“ I suppose we must tell Ermine , ”
134195	134206	134192	134192	she	180	“ indeed , I know I could not help it . ”
134207	134211	134212	134212	he	3235	“ Nor I , ”
134217	134246	134212	134212	he	3235	“ though there is only too much fear that nothing will come of it but disappointment . At least , she will tell us how to meet that . ”
134565	134568	134569	134569	she	127	“ Impossible , ”
134572	134584	134569	134569	she	127	“ You must , Rachel dear ; indeed , you must . ”
134585	134593	134547	134547	she	128	“ As if I could leave her . ”
134594	134606	134547	134547	she	128	“ Nay , Rachel , but if you would only send — ”
134607	134657	134569	134569	she	127	“ Nonsense , Grace ; if I can stay with her I can restore her far better than could an allopathist , who would not leave nature to herself . O Grace , why ca n’t you leave me in peace ? Is it not bad enough without this ? ”
134658	134685	134547	134547	she	128	“ Dear Rachel , I am very sorry ; but if you did not come down to dinner , think of the talk it would make . ”
134686	134691	134547	134547	she	128	“ Let them talk . ”
134692	134734	134569	134569	she	127	“ Ah , Rachel , but the mother ! Think how dreadful the day ’s work has been to her ; and how can she ever get through the evening if she is in a fright at your not coming down ? ”
134735	134749	134751	134751	Rachel	128	“ Dinner parties are one of the most barbarous institutions of past stupidity , ”
134883	134887	134878	134878	Grace	127	“ the mother ’s ”
134925	134930	134920	134921	Mr. Grey	362	“ Accountable for all , ”
135300	135314	135290	135291	Captain Keith	258	“ This has come about far more painfully than could have been expected . ”
135315	135323	135324	135324	she	128	“ I thought you would have triumphed , ”
135327	135345	135324	135324	she	128	“ No , indeed . I feel accountable for the introduction that my sister brought upon you . ”
135346	135354	135356	135356	Rachel	128	“ It was no fault of hers , ”
135360	135369	135356	135356	Rachel	128	“ I wish I could feel it so . ”
135370	135384	135324	135324	she	128	“ That was a mere chance . The rest was my own doing . ”
135385	135397	135324	135324	she	128	“ Aided and abetted by more than one looker - on . ”
135398	135408	135409	135409	she	128	“ No . It is I who am accountable , ”
135418	135424	135409	135409	she	128	“ You accept the whole ? ”
135440	135444	135437	135437	she	128	“ I must , ”
135484	135489	135490	135490	he	362	“ You can not , ”
135493	135516	135490	135490	he	362	“ every bystander must rue the apathy that let you be so cruelly deceived , for want of exertion on their part . ”
135517	135520	135521	135521	she	128	“ Nay , ”
135524	135547	135521	135521	she	128	“ you tried to open my eyes . I think this would have come worse , but for this morning ’s stroke . ”
135548	135552	135553	135553	he	362	“ Thank you , ”
135558	135572	135573	135573	she	128	“ I daresay you know more than I have been able to understand , ”
135577	135596	135573	135573	she	128	“ it is like being in the middle of an explosion , without knowing what stands or falls . ”
135597	135605	135607	135607	he	362	“ And lobster salad as an aggravation ! ”
135616	135624	135607	135607	he	362	“ This dinner is hard on you . ”
135625	135668	135573	135573	she	128	“ Very ; but my mother would have been unhappy if I had stayed away . It is the leaving the poor child that grieves me . She is in a fearful state , between sore throat , starvation , and blows . ”
135757	135768	135749	135749	She	128	“ But it was only the woman that was cruel . ”
135769	135779	135749	135749	She	128	“ She had not her Sepoy face for nothing . ”
135780	135790	135749	135749	She	128	“ Did I hear that Miss Williams knew her ? ”
135791	135828	135749	135749	She	128	“ Yes , it seems she was a maid who had once been very cruel to little Rose Williams . The Colonel seems to think the discovery may have important consequences . I hardly know how . ”
135937	135943	135944	135944	he	258	“ How is your patient ? ”
135947	135972	135944	135944	he	258	“ She is very ill ; and the worst of it is , that it seems such agony to her to attempt to swallow . ”
135973	135981	135923	135924	Captain Keith	258	“ Have you had advice for her ? ”
135982	136004	135923	135924	Captain Keith	258	“ No ; I have often treated colds , and I thought this a case , aggravated by that wicked treatment . ”
136005	136013	135944	135944	he	258	“ Have you looked into her mouth ? ”
136014	136025	136026	136026	He	258	“ Yes ; the skin is frightfully brown and dry . ”
136039	136046	136026	136026	He	258	“ Did you ever see diphtheria ? ”
136047	136048	135944	135944	he	258	“ No!”—her
136050	136053	136026	136026	He	258	contracting—“did you ? ”
136054	136070	136026	136026	He	258	“ Yes ; we had it through all the children of the regiment at Woolwich . ”
136071	136078	136079	136079	He	258	“ You think this is it ? ”
136093	136101	136103	136103	Rachel	128	“ I must send for Mr. Frampton , ”
136131	136143	136121	136127	all the male part of the establishment	3281	“ Where does he live ? I ’ll send him up . ”
136144	136164	136165	136165	He	258	“ Thank you , oh ! thank you . The house with the rails , under the east cliff . ”
136284	136354	136243	136243	Grace	127	“ I am sorry to say that Mr. Frampton is out , not likely to be at home till morning , and his partner is with a bad accident at Avonford . The best plan will be for me to ride back to Avoncester , and send out Macvicar , our doctor . He is a kind - hearted man , of much experience in this kind of thing . ”
136355	136363	136366	136367	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ But you are not going back , ”
136379	136399	136366	136367	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ You were to sleep at Colonel Keith ’s . I could not think of your taking the trouble . ”
136400	136421	136243	136243	Grace	127	“ I have settled that with the Colonel , thank you . My dog - cart will be here directly . ”
136422	136431	136433	136433	Rachel	128	“ I can only say , thank you , ”
136437	136455	136433	136433	Rachel	128	“ But is there nothing to be done in the meantime ? Do you know the treatment ? ”
136477	136499	136243	136243	Grace	127	“ That horrible new sore throat ! Oh , Rachel , and you have been hanging over her all this time ! ”
136500	136503	136505	136506	Alick Keith	125	“ Indeed , ”
136512	136544	136505	136506	Alick Keith	125	“ I think you need not be alarmed . The complaint seems to me to depend on the air and locality . I have been often with people who had it . ”
136545	136551	136243	136243	Grace	127	“ And not caught it ? ”
136552	136596	136605	136605	he	3290	“ No ; though one poor little fellow , our piper ’s son , would not try to take food from any one else , and died at last on my knee . I do not believe it is infectious in that way . ”
136617	136642	136613	136614	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ He really is a very good young man . But oh , Rachel , my dear , how could you bring her here ? ”
136643	136667	136605	136605	he	3290	“ I did not know , mother . Any way it is better than her being in Mrs. Kelland ’s hive of children . ”
136668	136682	136613	136614	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ You are not going back to her , Rachel , I entreat ! ”
136683	136730	136731	136731	She	3292	“ Mother , I must . You heard what Captain Keith said . Let that comfort you . It would be brutal cruelty and cowardice to stay away from her to night . Good night , Grace , make mother see that it must be so . ”
136756	136771	136736	136737	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ You do not go into the room again , Grace , I insist . ”
136835	136840	136818	136819	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ mother ’s child , ”
137155	137175	137144	137145	Mrs. Kelland	189	“ It is the turn of the night , Miss Rachel . You bad best leave her to me . ”
137176	137183	137185	137185	Rachel	128	“ I will never leave her , ”
137188	137208	137185	137185	Rachel	128	“ You are a young lady , Miss Rachel , you ai n’t used to the like of this . ”
137209	137212	137213	137213	Rachel	128	“ Hark ! ”
137282	137298	137265	137265	she	128	“ Please , ma’am , do n’t fret , I ’m going to poor mother . ”
137299	137313	137315	137315	Rachel	128	“ You will be better now , Lovedy , here is the doctor , ”
137382	137391	137393	137393	Rachel	128	“ Can not her throat be operated on ? ”
137401	137415	137393	137393	Rachel	128	“ I think we could both be depended on if you wanted us . ”
137416	137426	137346	137346	He	302	“ She is too far gone , poor lassie , ”
137431	137465	137346	137346	He	302	“ it would be mere cruelty to torment her . You had better go and lie down , Miss Curtis ; her mother and I can do all she is like to need . ”
137466	137471	137393	137393	Rachel	128	“ Is she dying ? ”
137472	137512	137346	137346	He	302	“ I doubt if she can last an hour longer . The disease is in an advanced state , and she was in too reduced a state to have battled with it , even had it been met earlier . ”
137513	137524	137526	137526	Rachel	128	“ As it should have been ! Twice her destroyer ! ”
137582	137625	137626	137627	Dr. Macvicar	373	“ She ’s saying she’ve been a bad girl to me , poor lamb , and I tell her not to think of it ! She knows it was for her good , if she had not been set against her work . ”
137667	137672	137673	137673	she	128	“ Do n’t fret , ”
137676	137695	137673	137673	she	128	“ there ’s no one to beat me up there ! Please , the verse about the tears . ”
137725	137760	137717	137721	the old Scotch army surgeon	3313	“ ‘ The Lord God shall wipe off tears from all eyes . ’ Ah ! poor little one , you are going from a world that has been full of woe to you . ”
137761	137774	137776	137776	Rachel	128	“ Oh , forgive me , forgive me , my poor child , ”
137788	137797	137799	137801	the little girl	507	“ Please , ma’am , do n’t cry , ”
137804	137819	137820	137820	she	507	“ you were very good to me . Please tell me of my Saviour , ”
137858	137869	137852	137853	the child	975	whisper—“Ah ! I knew they scourged Him — for me . ”
138005	138010	138002	138002	she	128	“ Accountable for all . ”
138082	138093	138080	138080	Marmion	375	“ Are you sleepy , Rose ? What a yawn ! ”
138094	138117	138042	138042	he	3324	“ Not sleepy , Aunt Ailie ; only it is such a tiresome long day when the Colonel does not come in . ”
138118	138138	138204	138204	his	1750	“ Take care , Rosie ; I do n’t know what we shall be good for at this rate . ”
138139	138158	138080	138080	Marmion	375	“ We ? O Aunt Ermine , then you think it tiresome too . I know you do — ”
138159	138166	138042	138042	he	3324	“ What ’s that , Rose ! ”
138167	138182	138080	138080	Marmion	375	“ It is ! it is ! I ’ll open the door for him . ”
138225	138239	138219	138219	Ermine	170	“ How came Tibbie to let you out at this time of night ? ”
138240	138258	138186	138186	Rose	186	“ I have not ventured to encounter Tibbie at all . I drove up to your door . ”
138259	138271	138273	138273	Alison	180	“ You have been at St. Norbert ’s all this time , ”
138275	138299	138300	138300	he	1750	“ Do you think no one can carry on a campaign at St. Norbert ’s but yourself and your generalissima , Miss Ailie ? ”
138310	138337	138339	138339	Ermine	170	“ Then , if you have not gone home , you have had nothing to eat , and that is the reason you look so tired , ”
138341	138352	138339	138339	Ermine	170	“ Yes ; I had some luncheon at the Abbey . ”
138353	138375	138186	138186	Rose	186	“ Then , at any rate , you shall have some tea . Rosie , run and fetch the little kettle . ”
138376	138384	138386	138386	Rose	186	“ And the Beauchamp cup and saucer , ”
138403	138456	138386	138386	Rose	186	“ And please , please , Aunt Ermine , let me sit up to make it for him . I have not seen him all day , you know ; and it is the first time he ever drank tea in our house , except make - believe with Violetta and Colinette . ”
138457	138518	138519	138519	Rose	186	“ No , Rose . Your aunt says I spoil that child , and I am going to have my revenge upon you . You must see the wild beast at his meals another time ; for it just happens that I have a good deal to say to your aunts , and it is not intended for your ears . ”
138534	138545	138553	138553	she	186	“ just to put the tea - things in order , ”
138559	138568	138570	138570	Ermine	170	“ Here , Rose , if you please , ”
138580	138595	138570	138570	Ermine	170	“ Why , Aunt Ermine , I did not know you could make tea ! ”
138596	138616	138553	138553	she	186	“ There are such things as extraordinary occasions , Rose . Now , good night , my sweet one . ”
138617	138645	138647	138647	Alison	180	“ Good night , my Lady Discretion . We will make up for it one of these days . Do n’t stay away , pray , Ailie , ”
138653	138664	138647	138647	Alison	180	“ I have nothing to say till you come back . ”
138665	138673	138675	138675	Ermine	170	“ I know it is good news , ”
138677	138687	138675	138675	Ermine	170	“ but it has cost you something , Colin . ”
138709	138724	138692	138692	he	3328	“ How long is it since you poured out tea for me , Ermine ? ”
138725	138763	138647	138647	Alison	180	“ Thirteen years next June , when you and Harry used to come in from the cricket field , so late and hot that you were ashamed to present yourself in civilized society at the Great House . ”
138764	138781	138675	138675	Ermine	170	“ As if nobody from the Parsonage ever came down to look on at the cricket . ”
138782	138801	138692	138692	he	3328	“ Yes ; being summoned by all the boys to see that nothing would teach a Scotchman cricket . ”
138802	138817	138647	138647	Alison	180	“ Ah ! you have got the last word , for here comes Ailie . ”
138818	138822	138824	138824	Alison	180	“ Of course , ”
138829	138850	138824	138824	Alison	180	“ Ermine has had the pith of the story , so I had better ask at once what it is . ”
138851	138880	138882	138882	Ermine	170	“ That the Beauchamp Eleven beat Her Majesty ’s — th Foot on Midsummer Day , 1846 , is the pith of what I have as yet heard , ”
138884	138914	138916	138916	Colin	236	“ And that Beauchamp ladies are every whit as full of mischief as they used to be in those days , is the sum of what I have told , ”
138918	138921	138923	138923	Ermine	170	“ Yes , ”
138925	138949	138923	138923	Ermine	170	“ he has most loyally kept his word of reserving all for you . He has not even said whether Mauleverer is taken . ”
138950	138959	138961	138961	Colin	236	“ My story is grave and sad enough , ”
139049	139055	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ Is he the same ? ”
139059	139095	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ All in due time ; unless , like Miss Rachel , you wish to tell me my story yourselves . By - the - bye , how is that poor girl to - day ? ”
139096	139132	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ Thoroughly knocked down . There is a sort of feverish lassitude about her that makes them very anxious . They were hoping to persuade her to see Mr. Frampton when Lady Temple heard last . ”
139133	139201	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ Poor thing ! it has been a sad affair for her . Well , I told you I should go over this morning and see Mr. Grey , and judge if anything could be done . I got to the Abbey at about eleven o’clock , and found the policeman had just come back after serving the summons , with the news that Mauleverer was gone . ”
139202	139205	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ Gone ! ”
139206	139641	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ Clean gone ! Absconded from his lodgings , and left no traces behind him . But , as to the poor woman , the policeman reported that she had been left in terrible distress , with the child extremely ill , and not a penny , not a thing to eat in the house . He came back to ask Mr. Grey what was to be done ; and as the suspicion of diphtheria made every one inclined to fight shy of the house , I thought I had better go down and see what was to be done . I knocked a good while in vain ; but at last she looked out of window , and I told her I only wanted to know what could be done for her child , and would send a doctor . Then she told me how to open the door . Poor thing ! I found her the picture of desolation , in the midst of the dreary kitchen , with the child gasping on her lap ; all the pretence of widowhood gone , and her hair hanging loose about her face , which was quite white with hunger , and her great eyes looked wild , like the glare of a wild beast ’s in a den . I spoke to her by her own name , and she started and trembled , and said , ‘ Did Miss Alison tell you ? ’ I said , ‘ Yes , ’ and explained who I was , and she caught me up half way : ‘ O yes , yes , my lady ’s nephew , that was engaged to Miss Ermine ! ’ And she looked me full and searchingly in the face , Ermine , when I answered ‘ Yes . ’ Then she almost sobbed , ‘ And you are true to her ; ’ and put her hands over her face in an agony . It was a very strange examination on one ’s constancy , and I put an end to it by asking if she had any friends at home that I could write to for her ; but she cast that notion from her fiercely , and said she had no friend , no one . He had left her to her fate , because the child was too ill to be moved . And indeed the poor child was in such a state that there was no thinking of anything else , and I went at once to find a doctor and a nurse . ”
139642	139646	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ Diphtheria again ? ”
139647	139830	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ Yes ; and she , poor thing , was in no state to give it the resolute care that is the only chance . Doctors could be easily found , but I was at my wit ’s end for a nurse , till I remembered that Mr. Mitchell had told me of a Sisterhood that have a Home at St. Norbert ’s , with a nursing establishment attached to it . So , in despair , I went there , and begged to see the Superior , and a most kind and sensible lady I found her , ready to do anything helpful . She lent me a nice little Sister , rather young , I thought ; but who turned out thoroughly efficient , nearly as good as a doctor . Still , whether the child lives is very doubtful , though the mother was full of hope when I went in last . She insisted that I had saved it , when both she and it had been deserted by Maddox , for whom she had given up everything . ”
139831	139840	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ Then she owned that he was Maddox ? ”
139841	139942	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ She called him so , without my even putting the question to her . She had played his game long enough ; and now his desertion has evidently put an end to all her regard for him . It was confusedly and shortly told ; the child was in a state that prevented attention being given to anything else ; but she knows that she had been made a tool of to ruin her master and you , and the sight of you , Ailie , had evidently stirred up much old affection , and remembrance of better days . ”
139943	139949	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ Is she his wife ? ”
139950	139972	139974	139974	he	3332	“ No , or the evidence she promises could not be used against him . Do you know this , Ermine ? ”
139986	140007	139974	139974	he	3332	“ The Saracen ! the Saracen ’s head , Colin ; it was made with the lost seal - ring ! ”
140008	140339	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ The ring was taken from Edward ’s dressing - room the night when Rose was frightened with the phosphorus . Maria declares that she did not suspect the theft , or Maddox ’s purpose , till long after she had left her place . He effected his practices under pretence of attachment to her , and then could not shake her off . She went abroad with him after the settlement of affairs ; but he could not keep out of gambling speculation , and lost everything . Then he seems to have larked about , obtaining means she knew not how — as artist , lecturer , and what not — till the notable F. U. E. E. was started . Most likely he would have collected the subscriptions and made off with them , if Rachel Curtis had not had just sense enough to trust him with nothing without seeing some result , so that he was forced to set the affair going with Maria at its head , as the only person who could co - operate with him . They kept themselves ready for a start whenever there should be symptoms of a discovery , but , in the meantime , he gambled away all that he got into his hands , and never gave her enough to feed the children . Thus she was absolutely driven to force work from them for subsistence ; and she is a passionate creature , whom jealousy embittered more and more , so that she became more savage than she knew . Poor thing ! She has her punishment . Maddox only came home , yesterday , too late for any train before the mail , and by that time the child was too ill to be moved . He must have thought it all up with him , and wished to be rid of both , for they quarrelled , and he left her to her misery . ”
140340	140345	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ What , gone ? ”
140346	140447	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ Yes , but she told us of his haunts — haunts that he thought she did not know — a fancy shop , kept by a Mrs. Dench at Bristol , where it seems that he plays the philanthropical lecturer , and probably has been trying to secure a snug berth for himself unknown , as he thought , to Maria ; but she pried into his letters , and kept a keen watch upon him . He was to be inquired for there by his Mauleverer name , and , I have little doubt , will be captured . ”
140448	140452	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ And then ? ”
140453	140501	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ He will be committed for trial at the sessions ; and , in the meantime , I must see Beauchamp and Dr. Long , and arrange that he should be prosecuted for the forgery , even though he should slip through our fingers at the sessions . ”
140502	140509	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ Oh , could that be ? ”
140510	140603	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ This Clever Woman has managed matters so sweetly , that they might just as well try her as him for obtaining money on false pretences ; and the man seems to have been wonderfully sharp in avoiding committing himself . Mrs. Curtis ’s man of business has been trying all day to get up the case , but he has made out nothing but a few more debts such as that which turned up yesterday ; and it is very doubtful how far a case can be made out against him . ”
140604	140612	139057	139057	Alison	180	“ And then we should lose him . ”
140613	140672	140673	140673	Alison	180	“ That is exactly what I wish to avoid . I want to bring up my forces at once , and have him laid hold of at once for the forgery of those letters of Edward ’s . How long would it take to hear from Ekaterinburg ? I suppose Edward could travel as fast as a letter . ”
140680	140701	140673	140673	Alison	180	“ O , Colin , Colin ! you do not think that Edward would be here by the next sessions . ”
140702	140706	140708	140708	Colin	236	“ He ought , ”
140710	140732	140708	140708	Colin	236	“ I hope to induce Dr. Long and Harry to write him such letters as to bring him home at once . ”
140770	140775	140777	140777	Ermine	186	“ Poor dear Ailie , ”
140779	140800	140777	140777	Ermine	186	“ she has suffered terribly . Her heart is full of Edward . Oh , I hope he will come . ”
140801	140816	140741	140741	She	180	“ He must . He can not be so senseless as to stay away . ”
140817	140861	140777	140777	Ermine	186	“ There is that unfortunate promise to his wife ; and I fear that he is become so much estranged from English ways that he will hardly care to set himself straight here , after the pain that the universal suspicion gave him . ”
140862	140878	140881	140881	Colin	236	“ He can not but care . For the sake of all he must care , ”
140894	140932	140777	140777	Ermine	186	“ For his child ’s sake , this would be enough to bring him from his grave . If he refused to return to the investigation , it would be almost enough to make me doubt him . ”
140933	140941	140943	140943	Ermine	186	“ I am glad you said almost , ”
140959	140963	140964	140964	he	3336	“ Dear Ermine , ”
140969	141025	140964	140964	he	3336	“ you need not fear my not trusting him to the utmost . I know that he has been too much crushed to revive easily , and that it may not be easy to make him appreciate our hopes from such a distance ; but I think such a summons as this must bring him . ”
141026	141032	141034	141034	Ermine	181	“ I hope it will , ”
141036	141053	141034	141034	Ermine	181	“ Otherwise we should not deserve that you should have any more to do with us . ”
141054	141072	140964	140964	he	3336	“ Ermine , Ermine , do you not know that nothing can make any difference between us ? ”
141081	141085	141086	141086	she	181	“ I know , ”
141089	141110	141086	141086	she	181	“ that all you are doing makes me thank and bless you — oh ! more than I can speak . ”
141166	141182	141159	141159	he	3337	“ You forgive me , Ermine , you know I trust him as you do . ”
141183	141195	141197	141197	Ermine	181	“ I look to your setting him above being only trusted , ”
141203	141225	141197	141197	Ermine	181	“ Oh ! if you knew what this ray of hope is in the dreary darkness that has lasted so long ! ”
142126	142139	142141	142141	Alison	175	“ I do n’t think she realizes the extent of the illness , ”
142143	142218	142141	142141	Alison	175	“ say what I would , she would keep on thanking me breathlessly , and only wanting to escape to him . I asked if we should send to let Colin know , and she answered in her dear , unselfish way , ‘ By no means , it would be safer for him to be out of the way , ’ and , besides , she knew how much depended on his going . ”
142219	142224	142226	142226	Ermine	181	“ She is right , ”
142228	142259	142226	142226	Ermine	181	“ I am thankful that he is out of reach of trying to take a share in the nursing , it is bad enough to have one in the midst ! ”
142260	142263	142265	142265	Alison	175	“ Yes , ”
142267	142307	142265	142265	Alison	175	“ Lady Temple can not be left to bear this grievous trouble alone , and when the Homestead can not help her . Yet , Ermine , what can be done ? Is it safe for you and Rose ? ”
142308	142320	142322	142322	Ermine	186	“ Certainly not safe that you should come backwards and forwards , ”
142324	142361	142362	142362	Alison	175	“ Rose must not be put in danger ; so , dear , dear Ailie , you had better take your things up , and only look in on us now and then at the window . ”
142367	142388	142362	142362	Alison	175	“ Oh , Ermine , Ermine , since you began to mend , not one night have we been apart ! ”
142389	142393	142395	142395	Ermine	186	“ Silly child , ”
142405	142418	142395	142395	Ermine	186	“ I am strong , and Rose is my best little handmaid . ”
142419	142426	142428	142428	Alison	175	“ I know it is right , ”
142430	142500	142428	142428	Alison	175	“ I could not keep from my boys , and , indeed , now Colin is gone , I do not think any one at Myrtlewood will have the heart to carry out the treatment . It will almost kill that dear young mother to see it . No , they can not be left ; but oh , Ermine , it is like choosing between you and them . ”
142501	142514	142362	142362	Alison	175	“ Not at all , it is choosing between right and wrong . ”
142515	142543	142428	142428	Alison	175	“ And Ermine , if — if I should be ill , you must not think of coming near me . Rose must not be left alone . ”
142544	142555	142557	142557	Ermine	186	“ There is no use in talking of such things , ”
142561	142591	142557	142557	Ermine	186	“ let us think of what must be thought of , not of what is in the only Wise Hands . What has been done about the other children ? ”
142592	142612	142428	142428	Alison	175	“ I have kept them away from the first ; I am afraid for none of them but Conrade . ”
142613	142631	142557	142557	Ermine	186	“ It would be the wisest way to send them , nurses and all , to Gowanbrae . ”
142632	142638	142640	142640	Alison	175	“ Wise , but cool , ”
142642	142648	142640	142640	Alison	175	“ I will settle that , ”
142652	142668	142650	142650	Ermine	186	“ Tibbie shall come and invite them , and you must make Lady Temple consent . ”
142856	142885	142844	142844	her	186	“ she ’d be won’erfu ’ proud to serve Miss Williams , while her sister was sae thrang waitin ’ on her young scholar in his sair trouble . ”
142902	143033	142886	142886	Emmie	327	“ Deed , aye , ma’am , he ’s weel awa ’ . He has sic a wark wi ’ thae laddies an ’ their bit bairn o ’ a mither , I ’ll no say he ’d been easy keepit out o ’ the thick o ’ the distress , an ’ it ’s may be no surprisin ’ , after a ’ that ’s come and gane , that he seeks to take siccan a lift of the concern . I ’ve mony a time heard tell that the auld General , Sir Stephen , was as good as a faither to him , when he was sick an ’ lonesome , puir lad , in yon far awa ’ land o ’ wild beasts an ’ savages . ”
143034	143056	143128	143128	Ermine	381	“ Would it not be what he might like , to take in the children out of the way of infection ? ”
143057	143064	142886	142886	Emmie	327	“ ‘ Deed , Miss Ermine , ”
143070	143127	142886	142886	Emmie	327	“ I ’m thinkin ’ ye ken my maister Colin amaist as weel as I do . He ’s the true son of his forbears , an ’ Gowanbrae used to be always open in the auld lord ’s time , that ’s his grandfather Foreby , that he owes so much kindness to the General . ”
143151	143210	143128	143128	Ermine	381	“ liked the nurse as an extraordinar ’ douce woman , not like the fine English madams that Miss Isabel — that ’s Mrs. Comyn Menteith — put about her bairns ; and as to room , the sergeant and the tailor bodie did not need much , and the masons were only busy in the front parlour . ”
143211	143214	143216	143216	Ermine	381	“ Masons ? ”
143218	143334	143216	143216	Ermine	381	“ On , aye ? didna ye ken it ’s for the new room , that is to be built out frae the further parlour , and what they ca ’ the bay to the drawin’-room , just to mak ’ the house more conformable like wi ’ his name and forbears . I never thocht but that ye’d surely seen the plans and a ’ , Miss Ermine , an ’ if so be it was Maister Colin ’s pleasure the thing suld be private , I ’m real vext to hae said a word ; but ye’ll may be no let on to him , ma’am , that ye ken onything about it . ”
143335	143345	143347	143347	Ermine	381	“ Those down - stairs rooms so silently begun , ”
143349	143392	143347	143347	Ermine	381	“ How fixed his intention must be ? Oh , how will it end ? What would be best for him ? And how can I think of myseif , while all , even my Ailie , are in distress and danger ? ”
143593	143606	143582	143583	the mother	4964	“ Why should I be deprived of you both in one day ? ”
144083	144090	144091	144093	the dying child	3395	“ Tell me of my Saviour , ”
144494	144499	144520	144520	She	128	“ Accountable for all , ”
145522	145555	145556	145556	She	496	“ My dear , do n’t let me hear you say any such thing . He is a very wicked man , and you ought to be glad to have him punished ! ”
145936	145944	145945	145945	he	258	“ This is very good in you , ”
145948	145983	145945	145945	he	258	“ I met your mother and sister on my way up , and they asked me to leave word of Conrade being better , but they did not tell me I should see you . ”
145984	145989	145991	145991	Rachel	128	“ Conrade is better ? ”
146001	146024	145991	145991	Rachel	128	“ Yes , his throat is better . Miss Williams ’s firmness saved him . They think him quite out of danger . ”
146025	146048	145945	145945	he	258	“ Thank Heaven ! Oh , I could never have seen his mother again ! Oh , she has been the heroine ! ”
146049	146058	146059	146059	he	3452	“ In the truest sense of the word , ”
146089	146107	146108	146108	she	128	“ Dear Fanny , yes , she will be a rebuke to me for ever ! But , ”
146121	146144	146108	146108	she	128	“ I wanted — I wanted to beg you to do me a service . You were so kind the other night . ”
146172	146175	146176	146176	he	3452	“ Then , ”
146179	146198	146158	146158	she	128	“ you would wish for me to see the man and ascertain how he has disposed of them . ”
146199	146206	146158	146158	she	128	“ I should be most grateful ! ”
146207	146252	146158	146158	she	128	“ I will do my utmost . Perhaps I may not succeed immediately , as I believe visitors are not admitted every day , and he is said to be busy preparing his defence , but I will try , and let you know . ”
146253	146274	146158	146158	she	128	“ Thanks , thanks ! The doubt is terrible , for I know worry about it would distract my mother . ”
146275	146281	146158	146158	she	128	“ I do not imagine , ”
146285	146302	146158	146158	she	128	“ that much worse consequences than worry could ensue . But there are none more trying . ”
146303	146308	146158	146158	she	128	“ Oh not none ! ”
146309	146320	146321	146321	he	3452	“ Do not let worry about this increase other ills , ”
146326	146339	146321	146321	he	3452	“ do not think about this again till you hear from me . ”
146340	146345	146158	146158	she	128	“ Is that possible ? ”
146346	146375	146158	146158	she	128	“ I should not have thought so , if I had not watched my uncle cast off troubles about his eye - sight and the keeping his living . ”
146376	146388	146321	146321	he	3452	“ Ah ! but those were not of his own making . ”
146389	146409	146411	146411	Alick	125	“ ‘ There is a sparkle even in the darkest water . ’ That was a saying of his , ”
146425	146432	146411	146411	Alick	125	“ Not when they are turbid . ”
146433	146438	146439	146439	he	3452	“ They will clear , ”
146459	146478	146479	146479	he	3452	“ Meantime remember that in any way I can help you , it will be the greatest favour — ”
146500	146541	146543	146543	he	3452	“ My sister is too much at the bottom of it for me not to feel it the greatest kindness to me to let me try to be of the slightest use . I believe I had better go now , ”
146551	146560	146543	146543	he	3452	“ you are too much tired to talk . ”
146561	146567	146568	146568	she	3453	“ I believe I am , ”
146574	146585	146568	146568	she	3453	“ but thank you , this has done me good . ”
146586	146594	146543	146543	he	3452	“ And you are really getting better ? ”
146595	146614	146568	146568	she	3453	“ Yes , I believe so . Perhaps I may feel it when this terrible day is over . ”
146980	146988	146989	146989	she	138	“ He may come any time now , ”
146992	147016	146989	146989	she	138	“ his coming to - day or to - morrow was to depend on his getting his business done on Saturday or not . ”
147069	147083	147033	147033	Ermine	186	“ Why Ermine ! you could not bear the jarring of that crutch — ”
147084	147101	147138	147138	him	3469	“ Five or six years ago , Ailie , when I was a much poorer creature , ”
147108	147130	147138	147138	him	3469	“ I would make you a curtsey , Colonel Keith , but I am afraid I ca n’t quite do that , ”
147202	147215	147191	147191	she	138	“ See what it is to have had to shift for oneself ! ”
147216	147235	147304	147304	Ermine	186	“ You met me with your eyes the first time , Ermine , and I never missed anything . ”
147236	147275	147304	147304	Ermine	186	“ Well , I think it is hard not to have been more congratulated on my great achievement ! I thought I should have had at least as much credit as Widdrington , my favourite hero and model . ”
147276	147300	147191	147191	she	138	“ When you have an arm to support you it may be all very well , and I shall never stand it without . ”
147312	147322	147304	147304	Ermine	186	“ Well , Ailie , how are your boys ? ”
147323	147332	147304	147304	Ermine	186	“ Both much better , Francis nearly well . ”
147333	147345	147304	147304	Ermine	186	“ You have had a terrible time ! And their mother ? ”
147346	147353	147355	147355	Alison	180	“ Dearer and sweeter than ever , ”
147362	147378	147355	147355	Alison	180	“ no one who has not seen her now can guess half what she is ! ”
147379	147404	147304	147304	Ermine	186	“ I hope she has not missed me . If this matter had not been so pressing , I could not have stayed away . ”
147405	147444	147304	147304	Ermine	186	“ The one message she always gave me was , that you were not to think of coming home ; and , indeed , those dear boys were so good , that we managed very well without you . ”
147445	147481	147304	147304	Ermine	186	“ Yes , I had faith in your discipline , and I think that matters are in train against Edward comes . Of course there is no letter , or you would have told me . ”
147482	147489	147491	147491	Ermine	186	“ He will be coming himself , ”
147510	147521	147523	147523	Colin	305	“ Nothing could be more satisfactory than Beauchamp ’s letter , ”
147525	147552	147523	147523	Colin	305	“ He was so thoroughly convinced , that he immediately began to believe that he had trusted Edward all along , and had only been overruled . ”
147553	147558	147560	147560	Ermine	186	“ I dare say , ”
147564	147589	147560	147560	Ermine	186	“ I can quite fancy honest Harry completely persuaded that he was Edward ’s champion , while Maddox was turning him round his finger . ”
147590	147643	147644	147644	Alison	180	“ And such is his good faith , that I hope he will make Edward believe the same ! I told you of his sending his love to you , and of his hopes that you would some day come and see the old place . He made his wife quite cordial . ”
147661	147692	147656	147656	Ermine	186	“ Poor Harry ! I should like to see him again ! He would be exactly the same , I dare say . And how does the old place look ? ”
147693	147774	147560	147560	Ermine	186	“ Just what I do not want you to see . They have found out that the Rectory is unhealthy , and stuck up a new bald house on the top of the hill ; and the Hall is new furnished in colours that set one ’s teeth on edge . Nothing is like itself but Harry , and he only when you get him off duty — without his wife ! I was glad to get away to Belfast . ”
147775	147792	147644	147644	Alison	180	“ And there , judging from Julia ’s letter , they must have nearly devoured you . ”
147793	147810	147560	147560	Ermine	186	“ They were very hospitable . Your sister is not so very unlike you , Ermine ? ”
147811	147816	147818	147818	Alison	180	“ Oh , Colin ! ”
147839	147845	147560	147560	Ermine	186	“ Perhaps not so very . ”
147846	147854	147856	147856	Colin	305	“ She was very gracious to me , ”
147860	147870	147856	147856	Colin	305	“ and we had much pleasant talk of you . ”
147871	147874	147876	147876	Ermine	186	“ Yes , ”
147878	147905	147876	147876	Ermine	186	“ it will be a great pleasure to poor Julia to be allowed to take us up again , and you thought the doctor sufficiently convinced . ”
147906	147950	147856	147856	Colin	305	“ More satisfactorily so than Harry , for he reasoned out the matter , and seems to me to have gone more by his impression that a man could not be so imprudent as Edward in good faith than by Maddox ’s representation . ”
147951	147956	147958	147958	Alison	180	“ That is true , ”
147960	147985	147958	147958	Alison	180	“ he held out till Edward refused to come home , and then nothing would make him listen to a word on his behalf . ”
147986	147994	147996	147996	Ermine	186	“ And it will be so again , ”
148009	148023	148006	148006	she	186	“ Did you see whether there was a letter for you at home ? ”
148024	148046	147856	147856	Colin	305	“ Yes , I looked in , and found only this , which I have only glanced at , from Bessie . ”
148047	148051	147856	147856	Colin	305	“ From Paris ? ”
148052	148433	148006	148006	she	186	“ Yes , they come home immediately after Easter . ‘ Your brother is resolved I should be presented , and submit to the whole season in style ; after which he says I may judge for myself . ’ What people will do for pretty young wives ! Poor Mary ’s most brilliant season was a winter at Edinburgh ; and it must be his doing more than hers , for she goes on : ‘ Is it not very hard to be precluded all this time from playing the chieftainess in the halls of my forefathers ? I shall have to run down to your Gowanbrae to refresh myself , and see what you are all about , for I can not get the fragment of a letter from Alick ; and I met an Avoncestrian the other day , who told me that the whole county was in a state of excitement about the F. U. etc . ; that every one believed that the fascinating landscape - painter was on the high road to winning one of the joint - heiresses ; but that Lady Temple — the most incredible part of the story — had blown up the whole affair , made her way into the penetralia of the asylum , and rescued two female ‘ prentices , so nearly whipped to death that it took an infinitesimal quantity of Rachel ’s homoeopathy to demolish one entirely , and that the virtuous public was highly indignant that there was no inquest nor trial for manslaughter ; but that it was certain that Rachel had been extremely ill ever since . Poor Rachel , there must be some grain of truth in all this , but one would like to be able to contradict it . I wrote to ask Alick the rights of the story , but he has not vouchsafed me a line of reply ; and I should take it as very kind in you to let me know whether he is in the land of the living or gone to Edinburgh — as I hear is to be the lot of the Highlanders — or pining for the uncroquetable lawn , to which I always told him he had an eye . ’ ”
148434	148445	148447	148447	Ermine	186	“ She may think herself lucky he has not answered , ”
148449	148464	148447	148447	Ermine	186	“ he has always been rather unreasonably angry with her for making the introduction . ”
148465	148474	148476	148476	Alison	180	“ That is the reason he has not , ”
148478	148519	148476	148476	Alison	180	“ for he is certainly not far off . He has been over almost every day to inquire , and played German tactics all Saturday afternoon with Francis to our great relief . But I have stayed away long enough . ”
148520	148546	148447	148447	Ermine	186	“ I will walk back with you , Ailie . I must see the good little heroine of the most incredible part of the story . ”
148590	148613	148579	148579	she	138	“ They are so much better , and I am so glad you were not at home in the worst of it . ”
148614	148624	148476	148476	Alison	180	“ And I am sorry to have deserted you . ”
148625	148738	148740	148740	Fanny	127	“ Oh , no , no , it was much better that you should be away . We should all have wanted you , and that would have been dangerous , and dear , dear Miss Williams did all that could be done . Do you know , it taught me that you were right when you told me I ought never to rest till the boys learnt to obey , for obedience ’ sake , at a word . It showed what a bad mother I am , for I am sure if dear Conrade had been like what he was last year , even she could not have saved him , ”
148814	148826	148801	148801	herself	127	“ hear how dismal it is to have a silent nursery . ”
148827	148852	148801	148801	herself	127	“ Yes , it has been a fearful time . We little guessed how much risk you ran when you went to the rescue . ”
148853	148883	148885	148885	Fanny	127	“ Dear Con , when he thought — when we thought he could not get better , said I was not to mind that , and I do n’t , ”
148887	148960	148885	148885	Fanny	127	“ I thought it was right , and though I did not know this would come of it , yet you see God has been very merciful , and brought both of my boys out of this dreadful illness , and I dare say it will do them good all their lives now it is over . I am sure it will to me , for I shall always be more thankful . ”
148961	148967	148968	148968	he	3476	“ Everything does you good , ”
148971	148976	148977	148977	she	127	“ And another thing , ”
148982	149100	148977	148977	she	127	“ it has made me know that dear Miss Williams so much better . She was so good , so wonderfully good , to come away from her sister to us . I thought she was quite gone the first day , and that I was alone with my poor Francie , and presently there she was by my side , giving me strength and hope by her very look . I want to have her for good , I want to make her my sister ! She would teach the boys still , for nobody else could make them good , but if ever her sister could spare her , she must never go away again . ”
149101	149110	149112	149113	the Colonel	1244	“ You had better see what she says , ”
149272	149279	149287	149287	Rachel	128	“ Is it so nominated in the bond?”—Merchant
149471	149474	149466	149466	she	128	“ yes , ”
149944	149954	149956	149956	she	128	“ No ; it was a viva voce agreement . ”
149978	149988	149956	149956	she	128	“ I described my plans , and you consented . ”
150058	150081	150119	150119	she	128	“ I do not remember the exact words ; but you acquiesced in the appearance of your name as secretary and treasurer . ”
150193	150201	150203	150203	Rachel	128	“ I understood that they were paid , ”
150209	150223	150225	150226	the prisoner	3504	“ Will you oblige me by mentioning on what that understanding was founded ? ”
150294	150299	150288	150288	she	128	“ I thought so . ”
150387	150400	150376	150376	Colin	305	“ Come out when Lady Temple does , I will meet you , ”
150419	150424	150417	150417	Rachel	128	“ I thought so , ”
150437	150492	150427	150428	the chairman	3520	“ Mr. Murray , can you carry the case any further by other witnesses ? At present I see no case to go to the jury . You will see that the witness not only does not set up any case of embezzlement , but rather loads to an inference in the contrary direction . ”
150493	150498	150524	150525	the chairman	3520	“ No , sir , ”
150503	150520	150524	150525	the chairman	3520	“ I am afraid that I can add nothing to the case already presented to you . ”
150528	150730	150524	150525	the chairman	3520	“ Gentlemen of the Jury,—The case for the prosecution does not sustain the indictment or require me to call on the prisoner for his defence , and it is your duty to find him not guilty . You will observe that we are not trying a civil action , in respect of the large sum which he has received from the young lady , and for which he is still accountable to her ; nor by acquitting him are you pronouncing that he has not shown himself a man of very questionable honesty , but only that the evidence will not bring him within the grasp of the criminal law , as guilty of embezzlement under the statute , and this because of the looseness of the arrange ments , that had been implied instead of expressed . It is exceedingly to be regretted that with the best intentions and kindest purposes , want of caution and experience on her part should have enabled the prisoner thus to secure himself from the possibility of a conviction ; but there can be no doubt that the evidence before us is such as to leave no alternative but a verdict of not guilty . ”
150901	150905	150887	150888	the jury	7613	“ Not Guilty , ”
150984	150987	150989	150990	Lady Temple	138	“ Oh ! ”
150992	151041	150989	150990	Lady Temple	138	“ is it not horrid ? Is nothing to be done to that dreadful man ? I always thought people came here to do justice . I shall never like Sir Edward Morden again ! But , oh ! what can that be ? Where is the Colonel ? ”
151213	151218	151219	151219	she	180	“ Is he come ? ”
151222	151225	151219	151219	she	180	“ No , ”
151232	151237	151238	151238	she	180	“ Oh , Colin ! ”
151336	151358	151327	151327	he	362	“ Well , Ailie , how are you ? and how is Ermine ? Where can this brother of yours be ? ”
151359	151368	151369	151369	she	180	“ Harry ! Mr. Beauchamp ! You here ! ”
151378	151415	151369	151369	she	180	“ Here is Colin seeming to think that something may be done towards nailing this scoundrel for the present , so I am come at his call . We shall have the fellow in a moment . ”
151501	151515	151498	151499	Harry Beauchamp	209	“ Good evening , Mr. Maddox , I am sorry to trouble you . ”
151516	151526	151478	151478	Mauleverer	282	“ I hope there is no misunderstanding , sir , ”
151531	151545	151498	151499	Harry Beauchamp	209	“ I have not the pleasure of knowing for whom you take me . ”
151838	151843	151845	151846	the accused	3551	“ Indeed , sir , ”
151853	151999	151845	151846	the accused	3551	“ this is an exceedingly hard case . Here am I , newly acquitted , after nearly six weeks ’ imprisonment , on so frivolous a charge that it has been dismissed without my even having occasion to defend myself , or to call my own most respectable witnesses as to character , when another charge is brought forward against me in a name that there has been an unaccountable desire to impose on me . Even if I were the person that this gentleman supposes , there is nothing proved . He may very possibly have received a forged letter , but I perceive nothing to fix the charge upon the party he calls Maddox . Let me call in my own witnesses , who had volunteered to come down from Bristol , and you will be convinced how completely mistaken the gentleman is . ”
152074	152083	152084	152084	he	214	“ What say you to this , Colin ? ”
152089	152111	152084	152084	he	214	“ That man ’s audacity is enough to stagger one , and I only saw him three times at the utmost . ”
152112	152116	152118	152118	Colin	305	“ Never fear , ”
152120	152128	152118	152118	Colin	305	“ delay is all in our favour . ”
152409	152427	152395	152396	Colonel Keith	207	“ Lady Temple will wait for me at the inn . It will soon be all right . ”
152469	152489	152466	152466	he	282	“ Sir , you do not intend to be misled by the malignity of a person of this description . ”
152490	152496	152498	152501	the scandalized widow Dench	3574	“ Worse than a murderess ! ”
152503	152509	152466	152466	he	282	“ Well , I never ! ”
152709	152768	152705	152705	himself	1126	“ I now understand the incredible ingratitude and malignity that have pointed out against me these hitherto unaccountable slanders . It is a punishment for insufficient inquiry into character . But you , sir , in common justice , will protect me from the aspersions of one who wishes to drag me down in her justly merited fall . ”
152769	152780	152782	152783	Mrs. Dench	397	“ Sentenced for three years ! To take her examination ! ”
153052	153055	153048	153049	Mr. Beauchamp	214	“ Dear H. ”
153081	153084	153086	153087	the accused	3551	“ Sir , ”
153089	153199	153086	153087	the accused	3551	“ of course I have no intention of intimating that a gentleman like the Honourable Colonel Keith has been in any collusion with this unhappy woman , but it must be obvious to you that his wish to exonerate his friend has induced him to give too easy credence to this person ’s malignant attempts to fasten upon one whom she might have had reason to regard as a benefactor the odium of the transactions that she acknowledges to have taken place between herself and this Maddox , thereto incited , no doubt , by some resemblance which must be strong , since it has likewise deceived Mr. Beauchamp . ”
153384	153409	153374	153375	Colonel Keith	207	“ Do not be frightened , my dear , you have only to answer a few questions as plainly and clearly as you can . ”
153446	153459	153437	153437	he	362	“ This is Mr. Grey , Rose , tell him your name . ”
153478	153485	153461	153462	Mr. Grey	362	“ I am Rose Ermine Williams . ”
153486	153496	153437	153437	he	362	“ And how old are you , my dear ? ”
153497	153507	153437	153437	he	362	“ I was eight on the last of June . ”
153508	153517	153519	153520	Mr. Grey	362	“ She knows the nature of an oath ? ”
153525	153536	153519	153520	Mr. Grey	362	“ Certainly , you can soon satisfy yourself of that . ”
153537	153541	153544	153545	Mr. Grey	362	“ My dear , ”
153562	153587	153544	153545	Mr. Grey	362	“ I am sure you have been well taught . Can you tell me what is meant by taking an oath before a magistrate ? ”
153588	153591	153593	153593	Rose	186	“ Yes , ”
153601	153615	153593	153593	Rose	186	“ it is calling upon Almighty God to hear one speak the truth . ”
153649	153664	153628	153628	she	186	“ Oh please , why am I here , what am I to say ? ”
153692	153749	153686	153686	he	362	“ Only answer just what you are asked as clearly as you can , and Mr. Grey will soon let you go . He knows you would try any way to speak the truth , but as he is going to examine you as a magistrate , he must ask you to take the oath first . ”
153791	153797	153798	153798	she	186	“ My mother is dead , ”
153801	153814	153798	153798	she	186	“ my father is Mr Williams , he is away at Ekaterinburg . ”
153815	153827	153774	153774	her	186	“ Do you remember any time before he was at Ekaterinburg ? ”
153828	153846	153798	153798	she	186	“ Oh yes ; when we lived at Kensington , and he had the patent glass works . ”
153847	153864	153798	153798	she	186	“ Now , turn round and say if there is any one here whom you know ? ”
153892	153896	153798	153798	she	186	“ Aunt Alison , ”
153907	153915	153798	153798	she	186	“ What is it , my dear ? ”
153916	153925	153948	153948	his	362	“ It is — it is Mr. Maddox , ”
153933	153943	153948	153948	his	362	“ and Maria ! Oh , let me go . ”
154012	154024	154006	154006	she	186	“ The agent for the glass — my father ’s agent . ”
154025	154031	154006	154006	she	186	“ And who is Maria ? ”
154032	154038	154006	154006	she	186	“ She was my nurse . ”
154039	154052	154006	154006	she	186	“ When did you last see the person you call Mr. Maddox ? ”
154053	154077	154079	154079	Rose	186	“ Last time , I was sure of it , was when I was walking on the esplanade at Avoncester with Colonel Keith , ”
154092	154103	154079	154079	Rose	186	“ I suppose you can hardly tell when that was ? ”
154104	154121	154123	154123	Rose	186	“ Yes , it was the day before you went away to Lord Keith ’s wedding , ”
154130	154137	154123	154123	Rose	186	“ Had you seen him before ? ”
154138	154158	154079	154079	Rose	186	“ Twice when I was out by myself , but it frightened me so that I never looked again . ”
154159	154170	154171	154171	She	186	“ Can you give me any guide to the time ? ”
154203	154218	154196	154196	she	186	“ Only when Colonel Keith saw how frightened I was , and asked me . ”
154219	154225	154227	154228	Mr. Grey	362	“ Why were you frightened ? ”
154237	154263	154227	154228	Mr. Grey	362	“ Because I could not quite leave off believing the dreadful things Mr. Maddox and Maria said they would do to me if I told . ”
154264	154268	154300	154301	Mr. Grey	362	“ Told what ? ”
154269	154285	154287	154287	Rose	186	“ About Mr. Maddox coming and walking with Maria when she was out with me , ”
154403	154416	154419	154420	the accused	3551	“ The young lady may be precocious , no doubt , sir , ”
154422	154458	154419	154420	the accused	3551	“ but I hardly see why she has been brought here . You can attach no weight to the confused recollections of so young a child , of matters that took place so long ago . ”
154459	154476	154478	154479	Mr. Grey	362	“ The question will be what weight the jury will attach to them at the assizes , ”
154481	154508	154478	154479	Mr. Grey	362	“ You will permit me to make one inquiry of the young lady , sir . Who told her whom she might expect to see here ? ”
154519	154563	154516	154516	Rose	186	“ Nobody ; I knew my aunt and the Colonel and Lady Temple were gone in to Avoncester , and Aunt Ermine got a note from the Colonel to say that I was to come in to him with Tibbie in a fly . ”
154564	154574	154478	154479	Mr. Grey	362	“ Did you know what you were wanted for ? ”
154575	154603	154478	154479	Mr. Grey	362	“ No , I could not think . I only knew they came to get the woman punished for being so cruel to the poor little girls . ”
154604	154613	154516	154516	Rose	186	“ Do you know who that person was ? ”
154614	154618	154478	154479	Mr. Grey	362	“ Mrs. Rawlins , ”
154624	154628	154630	154631	Mr. Grey	362	“ I think , ”
154636	154666	154630	154631	Mr. Grey	362	“ that you must perceive that , with such coincidence of testimony as I have here , I have no alternative but to commit you for the summer assizes . ”
154865	154877	154856	154857	Little Rose	400	“ Please , Aunt Ailie , may I speak to her ? ”
154930	154935	154936	154936	she	400	“ Please , Maria , ”
154939	154976	154936	154936	she	400	“ do n’t be angry with me for telling ; I never did till Colonel Keith asked me , and I could not help it . Will you kiss me and forgive me as you used ? ”
154996	155023	154936	154936	she	400	“ Oh , Miss Rose , Miss Rose , do not come near me . Oh , if I had minded you — and your aunts — ”
155101	155123	155082	155082	Alison	177	“ Maria , poor Maria , I am so sorry for you , I will try to come and see you — ”
155133	155147	155125	155125	her	177	“ Ailie , you must come , they are all waiting for you . ”
155168	155202	155151	155151	she	177	“ So that is Edward ’s little girl ! Why , she is the sweetest little clear - headed thing I have seen a long time . She was the saving of us . ”
155203	155212	155292	155293	the Colonel	1244	“ It was well thought of by Colin . ”
155213	155236	155292	155293	the Colonel	1244	“ Colin is a lawyer spoilt — that ’s a fact . A first - rate get - up of a case ! ”
155237	155245	155151	155151	she	177	“ And you think it safe now ? ”
155246	155280	155292	155293	the Colonel	1244	“ Nothing safer , so Edward turns up . How he can keep away from such a child as that , I ca n’t imagine . Where is she ? Oh , here — ”
155300	155315	155295	155295	Rose	186	“ Ha , my little Ailie , I must make better friends with you . ”
155316	155325	155327	155329	the little girl	507	“ My name is Rose , not Ailie , ”
155331	155357	155327	155329	the little girl	507	“ Oh , aye ! Well , it ought to have been , what d’ye call her — that was a Daniel come to judgment ? ”
155358	155361	155363	155363	Rose	186	“ Portia , ”
155365	155377	155363	155363	Rose	186	“ but I do n’t think that is pretty at all . ”
155378	155385	155388	155388	Alison	177	“ And where is Lady Temple ? ”
155390	155401	155388	155388	Alison	177	“ She must be grieved to be detained so long . ”
155402	155412	155414	155415	the Colonel	1244	“ Oh ! Lady Temple is well provided for , ”
155417	155452	155414	155415	the Colonel	1244	“ all the magistrates and half the bar are at her feet . They say the grace and simplicity of her manner of giving her evidence were the greatest contrast to poor Rachel ’s . ”
155453	155459	155462	155462	Alison	177	“ But where is she ? ”
155464	155501	155462	155462	Alison	177	“ At the hotel ; Maria ’s was the last case of the day , and she went away directly after it , with such a choice of escorts that I only just spoke to her . ”
155567	155570	155571	155571	she	177	“ Otherwise , ”
155574	155598	155571	155571	she	177	“ it would have been all my fault for having acted without asking advice . I hope I shall never do so again . ”
155880	155885	155875	155876	Alick Keith	125	out—“How has it gone ? ”
155886	155895	155875	155876	Alick Keith	125	“ Why , were you not in court ? ”
155896	155907	155875	155876	Alick Keith	125	“ What ! I go to hear my friends baited ! ”
155908	155914	155875	155876	Alick Keith	125	“ Where were you then ? ”
155915	155919	155875	155876	Alick Keith	125	“ At Avonmouth . ”
155920	155930	155932	155933	Lady Temple	138	“ Oh , then you have seen the boys , ”
155935	155940	155932	155933	Lady Temple	138	“ How is Conrade ? ”
155941	155960	155875	155876	Alick Keith	125	“ Quite himself . Up to a prodigious amount of indoor croquet . But how has it gone ? ”
155961	155966	155968	155969	Lady Temple	138	“ Such a shame ! ”
155971	155998	155968	155969	Lady Temple	138	“ They acquitted the dreadful man , and the poor woman , whom he drove to it , has a year ’s imprisonment and hard labour ! ”
155999	156008	155875	155876	Alick Keith	125	“ Acquitted ! What , is he off ? ”
156009	156035	155875	155876	Alick Keith	125	“ Oh , no , no ! he is safe , and waiting for the Assizes , all owing to the Colonel and little Rose . ”
156036	156045	156047	156048	Colonel Keith	207	“ He is committed for the former offence , ”
156050	156055	156047	156048	Colonel Keith	207	“ the important one . ”
156056	156067	156068	156068	he	207	“ That ’s right ! Good night ! And how , ”
156076	156084	156068	156068	he	207	“ did your cousin get through it ? ”
156085	156095	156097	156098	Lady Temple	138	“ Oh , they were so hard on her ! ”
156100	156125	156097	156098	Lady Temple	138	“ I could hardly bring myself to speak to Sir Edward after it ! It was as if he thought it all her fault ! ”
156126	156133	156135	156136	Colonel Keith	207	“ Her evidence broke down completely , ”
156138	156167	156135	156136	Colonel Keith	207	“ Sir Edward spared her as much as he could ; but the absurdity of her whole conduct was palpable . I hope she has had a lesson . ”
156184	156201	156183	156183	his	125	mufflers,—“I never could make out whether that is the coolest or the most sensitive fellow living ! ”
156569	156574	156575	156575	she	128	“ Pray excuse me , ”
156586	156613	156575	156575	she	128	“ indeed , I do n’t know that I could sit out a dinner ! A number of people together make me so dizzy and confused . ”
156614	156618	156620	156621	Miss Wellwood	403	“ Poor child ! ”
156634	156650	156628	156629	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Perhaps , as she has been so ill , the evening might be enough . ”
156651	156654	156656	156656	Rachel	128	“ Oh , ”
156658	156681	156656	156656	Rachel	128	“ I hope to be in bed before you have finished dinner . Indeed I am not good company for any one . ”
156682	156691	156693	156694	Miss Wellwood	403	“ Do n’t say that , my dear , ”
156698	156704	156706	156707	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Indeed , my dear , ”
156712	156730	156706	156707	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ I think the exertion would be good for you , if you could only think so . ”
156731	156736	156738	156739	Miss Wellwood	403	“ Yes , indeed , ”
156746	156759	156738	156739	Miss Wellwood	403	“ it is your mind that needs the distraction , my dear . ”
156760	156767	156706	156707	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ I am distracted enough already , ”
156777	156788	156789	156789	she	128	“ Indeed , I do not want to be disobliging , ”
156807	156848	156789	156789	she	128	“ it is very kind in you , Miss Wellwood , but this has been a very trying day , and I am sure I can give no pleasure to anybody , so if I might only be let off . ”
156849	156856	156858	156859	Miss Wellwood	403	“ It is not so much — ”
156870	156911	156858	156859	Miss Wellwood	403	“ Indeed , my dear , my brother and I could not bear that you should do anything you did not like , only you see it would never do for you to seem to want to shut yourself up . ”
156912	156932	156934	156934	Rachel	128	“ I should think all the world must feel as if I ought to be shut up for life , ”
156938	156961	156934	156934	Rachel	128	“ Ah ! but that is the very thing . If you do not show yourself it will make such a talk . ”
156967	156972	156934	156934	Rachel	128	“ Let them talk ; ”
157003	157019	157000	157000	she	128	“ Indeed , I can not much care , provided I do n’t hear them . ”
157020	157032	157034	157035	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Ah ! but you do n’t know , my dear , ”
157046	157070	157034	157035	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Indeed , dear Miss Wellwood , she does not know ; we thought it would be so awkward for her in court . ”
157071	157075	157077	157077	Rachel	128	“ Know what ? ”
157088	157097	157077	157077	Rachel	128	“ What have you been keeping from me ? ”
157098	157121	157034	157035	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Only — only , my dear , people will say such things , and nobody could think it that knew you . ”
157122	157125	157127	157127	Rachel	128	“ What ? ”
157129	157132	157134	157135	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Yes , ”
157161	157183	157184	157185	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ you know people will gossip , and some one has put it about that — that this horrid man was — ”
157205	157208	157209	157209	she	128	“ Oh ! ”
157219	157272	157209	157209	she	128	“ there must needs be a spice of flirtation to give piquancy to the mess of gossip ! I do n’t wonder , there are plenty of people who judge others by themselves , and think that motive must underlie everything ! I wonder who imagines that I am fallen so low ? ”
157273	157286	157288	157289	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ There , I knew she would take it in that way , ”
157291	157319	157288	157289	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ And so you understand us , my dear , we could not bear to ask you to do anything so distressing except for your own sake . ”
157320	157331	157333	157333	Rachel	128	“ I am far past caring for my own sake , ”
157335	157388	157333	157333	Rachel	128	“ but for yours and Grace ’s , mother , I will give as much ocular demonstration as I can , that I am not pining for this hero with a Norman name . I own I should have thought none of the Dean ’s friends would have needed to be convinced . ”
157389	157398	157399	157400	Miss Wellwood	403	“ Oh , no ! no ! but — ”
157422	157514	157415	157416	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ After all , my love , one ca n’t so much wonder ! You have always been very peculiar , you know , and so clever , and you took up this so eagerly . And then the Greys saw you so unwilling to prosecute . And — and I have always allowed you too much liberty — ever since your poor dear papa was taken — and now it has come upon you , my poor child ! Oh , I hope dear Fanny will take warning by me , ”
157527	157538	157540	157540	Rachel	128	“ Mother — mother ! this is worse than anything , ”
158005	158031	157978	157978	Rachel	128	“ Yes , my dear , but perhaps — don’t you think it might be remarked as if you chose to keep out of sight ? ”
158032	158038	158039	158039	Rachel	128	“ Oh , very well . ”
158265	158275	158237	158240	the girl beside her	3696	“ a gentleman who came down by the train , ”
158279	158282	158237	158240	the girl beside her	3696	“ Lady Temple ”
158284	158287	158289	158291	the young lady	5540	“ admirable , ”
158495	158499	158500	158500	she	128	“ The woman ? ”
158503	158587	158500	158500	she	128	“ Sentenced to a year ’s imprisonment with hard labour , and let me tell you , Rachel , you had a most narrow escape there ! If that army doctor had not come in time to see the child alive , they could not have chosen but have an inquest , and no mortal can tell what might have been the decision about your homoeopathy . You might have been looking forward to a worse business than this at the next assizes . ”
159665	159705	159750	159750	Grace	127	“ And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea ; and if one look unto the land , behold darkness and sorrow , and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof . ”
159909	159914	159916	159916	she	128	“ Captain Alexander Keith . ”
160030	160055	160027	160027	He	5154	“ I saw your mother and sister going into the town . I thought you would like to hear of this business at once . ”
160056	160063	160010	160010	he	5154	“ Oh yes , thank you . ”
160064	160077	160078	160078	he	5154	“ I could not see the man till the day before yesterday , ”
160081	160132	160027	160027	He	5154	“ and I could get nothing satisfactory from him . He said he had taken the papers to a legal friend , but was not authorized to give his name . Perhaps his views may be changed by his present condition . I will try him again if you like . ”
160133	160147	160010	160010	he	5154	“ Thank you , thank you ! Do you think this is true ! ”
160148	160186	160010	160010	he	5154	“ He is too cunning a scoundrel to tell unnecessary lies , and very likely he may have disposed of them to some Jew attorney ; but I think nothing is to be feared but some annoyance . ”
160187	160201	160203	160203	Rachel	128	“ And annoyance to my mother is the one thing I most fear , ”
160207	160220	160221	160221	he	3748	“ There might be a mode of much lessening it to her , ”
160224	160241	160221	160221	he	3748	“ Oh , what ? Tell me , and I would do it at any cost . ”
160242	160246	160248	160248	he	3748	“ Will you ? ”
160252	160259	160248	160248	he	3748	“ At the cost of yourself ? ”
160274	160289	160290	160290	he	3748	“ Would not a son be the best person to shield her from annoyance , ”
160305	160313	160302	160302	he	3748	“ Rachel , Rachel , let me ! ”
160325	160336	160316	160316	her	128	“ Oh ! oh ! I never thought of this . ”
160337	160340	160341	160341	he	3748	“ No , ”
160344	160392	160341	160341	he	3748	“ and I know what you do think of it , but indeed you need not be wasted . Our women and children want so much done for them , and none of our ladies are able or willing . Will you not come and help me ? ”
160393	160410	160455	160455	his	3748	“ Do n’t talk to me of helping ! I do nothing but spoil and ruin . ”
160411	160427	160455	160455	his	3748	“ Not now ! That is all gone and past . Come and begin afresh . ”
160428	160438	160455	160455	his	3748	“ No , no , I am too disagreeable . ”
160439	160447	160448	160448	he	3748	“ May not I judge for myself ? ”
160462	160467	160448	160448	he	3748	“ Headstrong — overbearing . ”
160468	160471	160473	160473	his	3748	“ Try , ”
160478	160505	160506	160506	she	3749	“ Oh no , no , nobody can bear me ! This is more than you — you ought to do — than any one should , ”
160515	160527	160512	160512	she	3749	“ Than any one to whom you were not most dear ! ”
160547	160574	160533	160533	he	3748	“ Oh , that ca n’t be . Bessie said you always took up whatever other people hated , and I know it is only that — ”
160575	160594	160596	160596	he	3748	“ Do n’t let Bessie ’s sayings come between us now , Rachel . This goes too deep , ”
160614	160622	160607	160607	she	3749	“ But you know what they say ! ”
160623	160633	160634	160634	he	3748	“ Have they been stupid enough to tell you ? ”
160637	160670	160607	160607	she	3749	“ Confute them then , Rachel — dolts that ca n’t believe in self - devotion ! Laugh at their beards . This is the way to put an end to it ! ”
160671	160688	160689	160689	she	3749	“ Oh no , they would only detest you for my sake . I ca n’t , ”
160701	160709	160710	160710	he	3748	“ I ’ll take care of that ! ”
160742	160745	160746	160746	he	3748	“ Then , ”
160749	160788	160746	160746	he	3748	“ you will let me take this whole matter in hand ; and if the worst comes to the worst , we will make up to the charity out of the Indian money , without vexing the mother . ”
160789	160801	160825	160825	he	3748	“ I ca n’t let you suffer for my miserable folly . ”
160802	160809	160810	160810	he	3748	“ Too late to say that ! ”
160829	160843	160825	160825	he	3748	“ These last weeks have shown me that your troubles must be mine . ”
160962	160972	160955	160955	he	258	“ May I have a few words with you ? ”
160973	160981	160983	160984	Mrs. Curtis	235	“ Not Fanny — not the children ! ”
160988	160995	161002	161002	his	258	“ No indeed . Only myself , ”
161081	161109	161062	161063	Miss Wellwood	403	“ a young officer , I believe . We see him often at the cathedral , and somebody said it was his sister whom Lord Keith married . ”
161110	161126	161128	161128	Grace	127	“ Yes , we know him well , and he is a Victoria Cross man , ”
161137	161188	161128	161128	Grace	127	“ So some one said , but the Dean never calls on the officers unless there is some introduction , or there would be no end to it . It was a mistake letting him in to disturb Rachel . Is your mother gone up to her , my dear ? ”
161189	161210	161212	161212	Grace	127	“ No , I think she is in the cathedral yard . I just came in to see about Rachel , ”
161375	161390	161391	161391	she	235	“ A maid whom there were few to praise And very few to love , ”
161654	161658	161663	161663	him	520	“ Dear Alexinder , ”
161889	161901	161902	161902	He	3784	“ Oh , Mr. Dean , it is nothing like that . ”
161910	161919	161921	161921	Rachel	128	“ Mother , mother , how could you ? ”
161928	161943	161921	161921	Rachel	128	“ My dear , they were so kind ; they could not help knowing ! ”
161944	161951	162010	162010	She	235	“ But it ca n’t be . ”
161952	161962	161921	161921	Rachel	128	“ Rachel , my child , you like him ! ”
161963	161989	161921	161921	Rachel	128	“ He does not know half about me yet . Mother , do n’t tell Fanny or any one till I have seen him again . ”
162052	162075	162078	162078	Keith	125	“ My Dear Bessie,—Wish me joy . I have gone in for the uncroquetable lawn , and won it.—Your affectionate brother ’ , “
162080	162081	162078	162078	Keith	125	” “
162104	162111	162096	162096	thou	3788	” — Much Ado about Nothing . “
162119	162143	162112	162112	Alick	125	” inquired Colonel Keith , sitting by his fire , suffering considerably from his late drive , and hearing reports that troubled him . “
162160	162161	162112	162112	Alick	125	” “
162194	162195	162183	162183	You	125	” “
162201	162211	162183	162183	You	125	” said Alick , as though weighing his words . “
162255	162256	162258	162259	Miss Williams	180	” “
162261	162262	162258	162259	Miss Williams	180	” “
162280	162281	162263	162263	Ermine	186	” “
162312	162313	162314	162314	I	0	” “
162379	162380	162384	162384	my	0	” “
162387	162397	162384	162384	my	0	” said Alick , looking composedly into the fire . “
162402	162408	162384	162384	my	0	” said the puzzled Colonel , “
162413	162414	162415	162416	No one	5101	” “
162422	162423	162415	162416	No one	5101	” “

162469	162501	162502	162502	Absurd	408	” gloomily added Alick . The Colonel conceived a hope that the lady would abjure matrimony , and release this devoted knight , but in a few moments Alick burst out — “
162561	162562	162532	162537	that old woman of a doctor	3800	” “
162567	162574	162575	162575	you	125	” said his friend , smiling , “
162589	162590	162575	162575	you	125	” “
162597	162601	162575	162575	you	125	” returned Alick . “
162615	162616	162575	162575	you	125	” “
162733	162739	162744	162744	you	125	” The Colonel was moved . “
162761	162762	162756	162756	you	125	” “
162768	162775	162756	162756	you	125	” said Alick , rather resentfully , “
162805	162812	162813	162813	I	0	” Colonel Keith shook his head . “
162823	162830	162815	162815	I	0	” he said with some dejection . “
162839	162845	162815	162815	I	0	” said Alick , lightly . “
162863	162864	162860	162861	Mackarel Lane	14	” “

162915	162929	162930	162930	I	0	” The Colonel responded with a less cheerful look than usual , adding , “
162956	162957	162960	162961	my guardian	3813	” “
162964	162977	162960	162961	my guardian	3813	” said Alick , with the desired effect of making him laugh . “
162991	162996	162986	162986	I	0	” he added gravely . “
163048	163049	163045	163045	her	3816	” “
163053	163057	163045	163045	her	3816	” said Alick , “
163108	163151	163152	163153	dear Alexander	207	” No , Grace was obdurate . Mr. Frampton had spoken of a nervous fever , and commanded perfect quiescence ; and Grace was the less tempted to transgress the order , because she really thought her mother was more in love with “
163154	163440	163152	163153	dear Alexander	207	” than Rachel was . Rachel was exceedingly depressed , restless , and feverish , and shrank from her mother ’s rejoicing , declaring that she was mistaken , and that nothing more must be said . She had never consented , and he must not make such a sacrifice ; he would not when he knew better . Nay , in some moods , Rachel seemed to think even the undefined result of the interview an additional humiliation , and to feel herself falling , if not fallen , from her supreme contempt of love and marriage . The hurry , and the consent taken for granted , had certainly been no small elements in her present disturbed and overwhelmed state ; and Grace , though understanding the motive , was disposed to resent the over - haste . Calm and time to think were promised to Rachel , but the more she had of both the more they hurt her . She tossed restlessly all night , and was depressed to the lowest ebb by day ; but on the second day , ill as she evidently was , she insisted on seeing Captain Keith , declaring that she should never be better till she had made him understand her . Her nurses saw that she was right ; and , besides , Mrs. Curtis ’s pity was greatly touched by dear Alexander ’s entreaties . So , as a desperate experiment , he was at last allowed to go into the dressing - room , where she was lying on the sofa . He begged to enter alone , only announced by a soft knock , to which she replied with a listless “
163444	163537	163152	163153	dear Alexander	207	” and did not look up till she suddenly became conscious of a footfall firmer though softer than those she was used to . She turned , and saw who it was who stood at a window opposite to her feet , drawing up the Venetian blind , from whose teasing divisions of glare and shade she had been hiding her eyes from the time she had come in , fretted by the low continuous tap of its laths upon the shutters . Her first involuntary exclamation was a sigh of relief . “
163556	163557	163543	163543	I	0	” “
163576	163614	163565	163565	me	0	” And as he did so , and she raised herself , he shook out her cushions , and substituted a cool chintz covered one for the hot crimson damask on which her head had been resting . “
163625	163635	163620	163620	you	3818	” she said with a long breath of satisfaction . “
163640	163736	163620	163620	you	3818	” he said , very quietly seating himself beside her couch , with a stillness of manner that strangely hushed all her throbbings ; and the very pleasure of lying really still was such that she did not at once break it . The lull of these few moments was inexpressibly sweet , but the pang that had crossed her so many times in the last two days and nights could not but return . She moved restlessly , and he leant towards her with a soft - toned inquiry what it was she wanted . “
163740	163747	163620	163620	you	3818	” she said , raising herself . “
163762	163778	163759	163759	you	3818	” she continued , as if repeating the sentence she had conned over to herself . “
163792	163799	163620	163620	you	3818	” with an effort of memory , “
163834	163845	163823	163823	you	3818	” she added , pressing her hands to her temples . “
163858	163859	163861	163861	me	0	” “
163863	163871	163861	163861	me	0	” he said , bending towards her . “
163888	163899	163880	163880	My	0	” she said in a low awe - struck voice . “
163934	163943	163880	163880	My	0	” she added in a strange interrogative tone . “
163958	163963	163965	163965	you	3818	” Alick said sadly ; “
163982	163983	163965	163965	you	3818	” “
164028	164029	163965	163965	you	3818	” “
164056	164065	164066	164066	You	3818	” She turned her eyes full on him . “
164078	164079	164072	164072	You	3818	” “
164088	164089	164090	164090	You	3818	” “
164115	164129	164094	164094	I	0	” there was something piteous in the way her eye sought his face . “
164135	164139	164094	164094	I	0	” he said ; “
164169	164170	164152	164152	I	0	” “
164175	164190	164191	164191	You	0	” she said with a groan ; but with a sudden turn she exclaimed , “
164212	164213	164207	164210	that kind of woman	3822	” “
164221	164232	164207	164210	that kind of woman	3822	” he answered in his natural tone ; then affectionately , “
164243	164292	164236	164236	I	0	” She lay back , wearied with the effort , and disinclined to break the stillness . There was a move at the door ; Mrs. Curtis , in an agony of restless anxiety , could not help coming to see that the interview was doing no harm . “
164297	164315	164236	164236	I	0	” exclaimed Rachel , holding out her hand as he turned at the opening of the door . “
164320	164342	164318	164318	mother	4966	” and there was an evident sound of disappointment . Mrs. Curtis was infinitely rejoiced to find her entrance thus inopportune . “
164356	164360	164343	164343	I	0	” she said . “
164381	164411	164363	164363	mother	4966	” looking up to him , as her mother retreated to tell Grace that it was indeed all right . This brought him to a footstool close beside her . “
164415	164419	164413	164413	you	0	” he murmured . “
164488	164510	164479	164479	you	0	” The tone of these words made Rachel raise herself , turn towards him , and hold out both her hands . “
164513	164525	164479	164479	you	0	” she said , as he took them into his own , “
164545	164546	164479	164479	you	0	” “
164553	164560	164587	164587	You	128	” in his own dry way . “
164570	164571	164587	164587	You	128	” “
164593	164594	164590	164590	I	0	” “
164605	164616	164590	164590	I	0	” she sighed , in the full surrender of herself . “
164626	164627	164590	164590	I	0	” “
164636	165009	164590	164590	I	0	” he said , as he replaced her on her cushions , and sat by her , holding her hand , but not speaking till the next interruption , by one of the numerous convalescent meals , brought in by Grace , who looked doubtful whether she would be allowed to come in , and then was edified by the little arrangements he made , quietly taking all into his own hands , and wonderfully lessening a sort of fidget that Mrs. Curtis ’s anxiety had attached to all that was done for Rachel . It was not for nothing that he had spent a year upon the sofa in the irritably sensitive state of nerves that Bessie had described ; and when he could speak to Grace alone , he gave her a lecture on those little refinements of unobtrusive care , that more demonstrative ailments had not availed to inculcate , and which Mrs. Curtis ’s present restless anxiety rendered almost impossible . To hinder her from constantly aggravating the fever on the nerves by her fidgeting solicitude was beyond all power save his own , and that when he was actually in the house . Morning after morning he rode to the Homestead to hear that Rachel had had a very bad night , and was very low , then was admitted to find Mrs. Curtis ’s fluttering , flurried attentions exasperating every wearied fibre with the very effort to force down fretfulness and impatience , till , when she was left to him , a long space of the lull impressed on her by his presence was needful before he could attempt any of the quiet talk , or brief readings of poetry , by which he tried further to soothe and rest her spirits . He would leave her so calm and full of repose as to make him augur well for the next day ; but the moment his back was turned , something would always happen that set all the pulses in agitation again , and consigned her to a fresh night of feverish phantoms of the past . He even grew distracted enough to scold Grace fraternally as the only person he could scold . “
165056	165057	165041	165041	his	3828	” “
165062	165072	165060	165060	Alick	125	” said Grace , with tears in her eyes , “
165122	165123	165126	165126	Grace	127	” “
165152	165153	165139	165139	I	0	” “
165170	165171	165158	165158	you	125	” “
165219	165220	165206	165206	Grace	127	” “
165237	165498	165499	165499	I	0	” And ‘ what a comfort ’ was re - echoed by Mrs. Curtis , who had erected dear Alexander to a pedestal of infallibility , and was always treated by him with a considerate kindness that made her pity Fanny for the number of years that must pass before Stephana could give her the supreme blessing of a son - in - law . Fanny , on her side , had sufficient present blessing in collecting her brood around her , after the long famine she had suffered , and regretted only that this month had rendered Stephana ’s babyhood more perceptibly a matter of the past ; and that , in the distance , school days were advancing towards Conrade , though it was at least a comfort that his diphtheria had secured him at home for another half year , and the Colonel had so much to think about that he had not begun his promised researches into schools . The long - looked - for letters came after a weary interval of expectation , the more trying to Ermine because the weather had been so bitter that Colin could not shake off his cold , nor venture beyond his own fireside , where Rose daily visited him , and brought home accounts that did not cheer her aunt . Edward wrote shortly to his sister , as if almost annoyed at the shower of letters that had by every post begun to recall his attention from some new invention on the means of assaying metals : — “
165702	165880	165881	165881	Thy	3839	” Ermine shed some bitter tears over this letter , the more sorrowful because the refusal was a shock to her own reliance on his honour , and she felt like a traitress to his cause . And Colin would give him up after this ungrateful indifference , if nothing worse . Surely it betrayed a consciousness that the whole of his conduct would not bear inquiry , and she thought of the representations that she had so indignantly rejected , that the accounts , even without the last fatal demand , were in a state that it required an excess of charity to ascribe to mere carelessness on the part of the principal . She was glad that Alison was absent , and Rose in the garden . She laid her head on her little table , and drew long sobs of keen suffering , the reaction from the enjoyment and hope of the last few months . And so little knew she what she ought to ask , that she could only strive to say , “
165886	165887	165888	165888	Ermine	186	” “
165926	165973	165924	165924	himself	3841	” Ermine looked up , and Colin was standing over her , muffled up to the eyes , and a letter of his own in his hand . Her first impulse was to cry out against his imprudence , glad as she was to see him . “
165980	165988	165924	165924	himself	3841	” he said , unwinding his wrappings , “
166043	166092	166094	166094	Edward	182	” Ermine ’s laugh had come , even amid her tears , his tone was so great a relief to her . She did not know that he had spent some minutes in cooling down his vexation , lest he should speak ungently of her brother ’s indifference . “
166096	166100	166094	166094	Edward	182	” she said , “
166114	166115	166101	166101	you	182	” “
166120	166134	166118	166118	yourself	3844	” and he pointed to the divisions of the letter he had described . “
166166	166167	166159	166159	he	182	” “
166180	166184	166171	166171	he	182	” said Ermine . “
166190	166191	166196	166196	you	186	” “
166204	166205	166196	166196	you	186	” “
166250	166251	166232	166232	Colin	236	” “
166258	166262	166232	166232	Colin	236	” he repeated . “
166279	166280	166281	166281	Colin	236	” “
166288	166289	166290	166290	I	0	” “
166337	166338	166324	166324	I	0	” “
166369	166370	166363	166363	I	0	” “
166383	166384	166388	166388	You	236	” “
166396	166397	166388	166388	You	236	” “
166402	166407	166388	166388	You	236	” with a smile , “
166414	166499	166388	166388	You	236	” She tried to answer his smile , but leant back and shed tears , not like the first , full of pain , but of affectionate gratitude , and yet of reluctance at his going . She had ever been the strength and stay of the family , but there seemed to be a source of weakness in his nearness , and this period of his indisposition and of suspense had been a strain on her spirits that told in this gentle weeping . “
166514	166523	166506	166506	you	236	” she said when she could speak again . “
166542	166543	166530	166530	you	236	” “
166553	166554	166555	166555	I	0	” “
166564	166565	166567	166567	I	0	” “
166581	166606	166607	166607	Mitchel	411	” In that calm smiling resolution Ermine read the needlessness of present argument , and spoke again of his health and his solitary hours . “
166697	166698	166686	166686	you	0	” “
166709	166710	166706	166706	her	3852	” “
166748	166845	166744	166744	Rachel	128	” If it was not Rachel , it was the next thing to her , namely , Alick Keith . This was the last day of those that he had spent at the Homestead , and he was leaving Rachel certainly better . She had not fallen back on any evening that he had been there , but to his great regret he would not be able to come out the next day . Regimental duty would take him up nearly all the day , and then he was invited to a party at the Deanery , “
166857	166880	166847	166848	the mother	4964	” he said ; just as if the mother ’s desires had the very same power over him as over her daughters . “
166892	166896	166889	166890	Miss Williams	180	” he said . “
166944	166945	166946	166946	She	128	” “
166950	166954	166946	166946	She	128	” said Ermine . “
166991	166992	166979	166979	she	128	” “
167033	167037	167014	167014	she	128	” said Ermine . “
167050	167054	167041	167041	her	128	” said Alick , “
167157	167158	167140	167140	She	128	” “
167172	167178	167164	167164	I	0	” said Ermine , cheerfully , “
167206	167323	167198	167198	I	0	” Alick thanked her earnestly . His listless manner was greatly enlivened by his anxiety , and Colonel Keith was obliged to own that marriage would be a good thing for him ; but such a marriage ! If from sheer indolence he should leave the government to his wife , then — Colin could only shrug his shoulders in dismay . Nevertheless , when Ermine ’s wheeled chair came to the door the next afternoon , he came with it , and walked by her side up the hill , talking of what had been absolutely the last call she had made — a visit when they had both been riding with the young Beauchamps . “
167352	167521	167347	167347	I	0	” said Ermine , laughing , and taking as usual an invalid ’s pleasure in all the little novelties only remarked after long seclusion . That steep , winding , pebbly road , with the ferns and creeping plants on its rocky sides , was a wonderful panorama to her , and she entreated for a stop at the summit to look down on the sea and the town ; but here Grace came out to them full of thanks and hopes , little knowing that to them the event was a very great one . When at the glass doors of the garden entrance , Ermine trusted herself to the Colonel ’s arm , and between him and her crutch crossed the short space to the morning room , where Rachel rose from her sofa , but wisely did not come forward till her guest was safely placed in a large easy chair . Rachel then held out her hand to the Colonel , and quietly said , “
167525	167561	167347	167347	I	0	” in a subdued manner that really touched him , as he retreated quickly and left them together . Then Rachel sat down on a footstool close to Ermine , and looked up to her . “
167615	167616	167604	167604	he	3864	” “
167629	167635	167604	167604	he	3864	” said Ermine , brightly . “
167664	167701	167704	167704	I	0	” For in truth Rachel ’s complexion had been little altered by her illness ; and the subdued dejected expression was the chief change visible , except in the feebleness and tremulousness of all her movements . “
167708	167712	167713	167713	I	0	” she said . “
167726	167727	167719	167719	he	3864	” “
167741	167751	167731	167731	I	0	” said Ermine , bending down to kiss her . “
167766	167770	167771	167771	I	0	” said Rachel . “
167789	167790	167791	167791	Grace	127	” “
167797	167801	167791	167791	Grace	127	” said Rachel , “
167860	167861	167862	167867	No one that could really judge	3869	” “
167869	167870	167862	167867	No one that could really judge	3869	” “
167875	167881	167890	167890	he	3864	” said Rachel , quickly , “
167982	167983	167987	167987	You	3874	” “
167992	167993	167987	167987	You	3874	” “
168002	168006	167999	167999	I	0	” said Rachel . “
168015	168049	168050	168050	My	0	” Ermine was struck with the still resolute determination of judging for herself — the self - sufficiency , almost redeemed by the unselfishness , and the face was most piteously in earnest . “
168094	168095	168072	168073	The Colonel	207	” “
168100	168104	168072	168073	The Colonel	207	” said Rachel , “
168121	168127	168118	168118	you	3878	” and she looked down , “
168386	168387	168388	168388	He	207	” “
168391	168400	168388	168388	He	207	” said Ermine , with a shaken voice , “
168412	168413	168388	168388	He	207	” “
168434	168443	168415	168415	he	207	” said Rachel , in an excited manner . “
168446	168450	168415	168415	he	207	” said Ermine , “
168535	168540	168542	168542	you	128	” Rachel looked cheered . “
168544	168548	168542	168542	you	128	” she faltered , “
168558	168559	168560	168560	I	0	” “
168569	168589	168564	168564	I	0	” murmured Ermine , a vivid colour flashing forth upon her cheek , and leading the question from herself . “
168612	168613	168606	168606	you	128	” “
168632	168642	168648	168648	you	128	” added Rachel , faintly after her brave beginning . “
168661	168676	168648	168648	you	128	” Rachel hung her head , and her lips made a half murmur of , “
168685	168686	168648	168648	you	128	” “
168730	168731	168746	168746	him	125	” “
168763	168767	168769	168769	I	0	” sobbed Rachel , “
168782	168801	168813	168813	his	125	” She laid her weary head on Ermine ’s lap , and Ermine bent down and kissed her . “
168818	168822	168823	168823	I	0	” proceeded Rachel . “
168844	168845	168835	168835	people	1066	” “
168882	168883	168877	168877	you	0	” “
168891	168897	168877	168877	you	0	” said Rachel , impatiently . “
168910	168957	168901	168901	I	0	” and she shed a few tears . Ermine was provoked with her , and began to think that she had been arguing on a wrong tack , and that it would be better after all for Alick to be free . Rachel looked up presently . “
169094	169095	169091	169091	his	3897	” “
169114	169118	169119	169119	He	3897	” said Ermine . “
169145	169146	169135	169135	I	0	” “
169151	169152	169157	169157	him	3897	” “
169176	169177	169157	169157	him	3897	” “
169191	169197	169184	169185	Lady Temple	138	” said Ermine , cheerfully , “
169272	169273	169259	169260	Miss Curtis	128	” “
169304	169313	169280	169280	You	0	” she added , holding Ermine ’s hand , “
169321	169322	169280	169280	You	0	” “
169326	169332	169298	169298	yours	0	” said Ermine , softly , “
169404	169764	169392	169392	Rachel	128	” Rachel lay down on her sofa , and fell asleep , nor did Alick find any occasion for blaming Grace when he returned the next day . The effect of the conversation had been to bring Rachel to a meek submission , very touching in its passiveness and weary peacefulness . She was growing stronger , walked out leaning on Alick ’s arm , and was even taken out by him in a boat , a wonderful innovation , for a dangerous accident to Mr. Curtis had given the mother such a horror of the sea that no boating excursions had ever taken place during her solitary reign , and the present were only achieved by a wonderful stretch of dear Alexander ’s influence . Perhaps she trusted him the more , because his maimed hand prevented him from being himself an oarsman , though he had once been devoted to rowing . At any rate , with an old fisherman at the oar , many hours were spent upon the waters of the bay , in a tranquillity that was balm to the harassed spirit , with very little talking , now and then some reading aloud , but often nothing but a dreamy repose . The novelty and absence of old association was one secret of the benefit that Rachel thus derived . Any bustle or resumption of former habits was a trial to her shattered nerves , and brought back the dreadful haunted nights . The first sight of Conrade , still looking thin and delicate , quite overset her ; a drive on the Avoncester road renewed all she had felt on the way thither ; three or four morning visitors coming in on her unexpectedly , made the whole morbid sense of eyes staring at her recur all night , and when the London solicitor came down about the settlements , she shrank in such a painful though still submissive way , from the sight of a stranger , far more from the semblance of a dinner party , that the mother yielded , and let her remain in her sitting - room . “
169770	169779	169766	169766	I	0	” said Alick , knocking at the door . “
169787	169788	169780	169780	I	0	” “
169798	169799	169794	169795	Mr. Williams	396	” “
169839	169859	169836	169836	you	0	” he added , stroking her hand , and speaking so gently that the very irony was rather pleasant . “
169867	169868	169836	169836	you	0	” “

U. E. E. The prayer of her life had been for action and usefulness , but when she had seen the shadow in the stream , her hot and eager haste , her unconscious detachment from all that was not visible and material had made her adhere too literally to that misinterpreted motto , laborare est orare . How should then her eyes be clear to discern between substance and shadow ?

171249	171256	171221	171221	he	125	“ Are you very much tired ? ”
171257	171266	171221	171221	he	125	“ No , it is very quiet here . ”
171267	171285	171221	171221	he	125	“ Very ; but I must take you in before that curling mist mounts into your throat . ”
171286	171305	171221	171221	he	125	“ This is a very nice place , Alick , the only really quiet one we have found . ”
171306	171332	171221	171221	he	125	“ I am afraid that it will be so no longer . The landlord tells me he has letters from three parties to order rooms . ”
171333	171344	171346	171346	Rachel	128	“ Oh , then , pray let us go on , ”
171351	171366	171221	171221	he	125	“ To - morrow afternoon then , for I find there ’s another waterfall . ”
171367	171371	171373	171373	Rachel	128	“ Very well , ”
171377	171393	171373	171373	Rachel	128	“ Or shall we cut the waterfall , and get on to Llan — something ? ”
171394	171406	171221	171221	he	125	“ If you do n’t think we ought to see it . ”

171416	171443	171411	171411	he	3951	“ What is the ought in the case ? Why are we going through all this ? Is it a duty to society or to ourselves ? ”
171444	171453	171455	171455	Rachel	128	“ A little of both , I suppose , ”
171457	171476	171455	171455	Rachel	128	“ And , Rachel , from the bottom of your heart , is it not a trying duty ? ”
171477	171488	171490	171490	Rachel	128	“ I want to like what you are showing me , ”
171492	171503	171490	171490	Rachel	128	“ And you are more worried than delighted , eh ? ”
171504	171565	171567	171567	she	128	“ I — I do n’t know ! I see it is grand and beautiful ! I did love my own moors , and the Spinsters ’ Needles , but — Don’t think me very ungrateful , but I ca n’t enter into all this ! All I really do care for is your kindness , and helping me about , ”

171630	171681	171627	171627	he	3953	“ let us be strong minded ! If life should ever become painful to us because of our neglect of the waterfalls , we will set out and fulfil our tale of them . Meantime , let me take you where you shall be really quiet , home to Bishopsworthy . ”
171682	171693	171722	171722	Rachel	128	“ But your uncle does not expect you so soon . ”
171694	171721	171722	171722	Rachel	128	“ My uncle is always ready for me , and a week or two of real rest there would make you ready for the further journey . ”

172265	172270	172227	172227	she	128	“ Not very little . ”
172271	172285	172227	172227	she	128	“ No ; I told you it was villafied and cockneyfied . There , ”
172302	172325	172227	172227	she	128	“ that ’s Timber End , the crack place here , where Bessie has always said it was her ambition to live . ”
172326	172335	172227	172227	she	128	“ How far is it from the Parsonage ? ”
172336	172340	172227	172227	she	128	“ Four miles . ”
172365	172374	172376	172376	Alick	125	“ Bishopsworthy is happily defended by a Dukery , ”
172500	172503	172496	172496	Alick	125	“ Thanks , ”
172505	172512	172496	172496	Alick	125	“ we will get out here , ”
172515	172535	172496	172496	Alick	125	“ They will take in the goods the back way . I do n’t like careering into the churchyard . ”

172740	172747	172701	172702	a gentleman	5154	“ Alick , my dear boy , ”
172930	172935	172937	172938	Mr. Clare	241	“ Traces of Bessie , ”
172940	172982	172937	172938	Mr. Clare	241	“ she brought them this morning , and spent nearly an hour in arranging them and entertaining me with her bright talk . I have hardly been able to keep out of the room since , they make it so delicious . ”
172983	172990	172992	172992	Alick	125	“ Do you often see her ? ”
172994	173024	172992	172992	Alick	125	“ Yes , dear child , she is most good - natured and attentive , and I take it most kindly of her , so courted as she is . ”
173025	173035	172937	172938	Mr. Clare	241	“ How do you get on with his lordship ? ”
173036	173097	172992	172992	Alick	125	“ I do n’t come much in his way , he has been a good deal laid up with sciatica , but he seems very fond of her ; and it was all her doing that they have been all this time at Littleworthy , instead of being in town for the season . She thought it better for him . ”
173098	173105	173107	173107	Alick	125	“ And where is Mr. Lifford ? ”
173109	173118	173107	173107	Alick	125	“ Gone to M — — till Saturday . ”
173119	173126	172992	172992	Alick	125	“ Unable to face the bride . ”
173127	173136	173138	173139	Mr. Clare	241	“ I fear Ranger is not equally shy , ”
173188	173196	173198	173199	Mr. Clare	241	“ How are the peacocks , Alick ? ”
173201	173230	173231	173231	Alick	125	“ they , at least , are inoffensive pets . I dreaded the shears without your superintendence , but Joe insisted that they were getting lop - sided . ”
173240	173267	173268	173268	Whereupon	419	“ All right , sir ; Joe has been a little hard on the crest of the left - hand one , but it is recovering . ”
173601	173610	173613	173613	Alick	125	“ Is there anything to be read aloud ? ”
173615	173627	173613	173613	Alick	125	“ You have not by chance got ‘ Framley Parsonage ? ’ ”
173628	173653	173655	173655	he	125	“ I wish I had . I did pick up ‘ Silas Marner , ’ at a station , thinking you might like it , ”
173674	173681	173658	173658	Rachel	128	“ Have you met with it ? ”
173682	173697	173613	173613	Alick	125	“ I have met with nothing of the sort since you were here last ; ”
173703	173750	173613	173613	Alick	125	“ Alick indulges me with novels , for my good curate had rather read the catalogue of a sale any day than meddle with one , and I ca n’t set on my pupil teacher in a book where I do n’t know what is coming . ”
173751	173759	173761	173761	Alick	125	“ We will get ‘ Framley , ’ ”
173763	173815	173761	173761	Alick	125	“ Bessie has it . She read me a very clever scene about a weak young parson bent on pleasing himself ; and offered to lend me the book , but I thought it would not edify Will Walker . But , no doubt , you have read it long ago . ”
173816	173819	173821	173821	Rachel	128	“ No , ”
173845	173849	173761	173761	Alick	125	“ Silas Marner , ”
173985	173998	174005	174005	she	128	“ sweet day , so calm , so cool , so bright , ”
174034	174039	174040	174040	he	125	“ You unmusical female , ”
174043	174049	174040	174040	he	125	“ what is that for ? ”
174050	174067	174040	174040	he	125	“ Your uncle spoke of music last night , and I thought he would like it . ”
174068	174077	174040	174040	he	125	“ I thought you had no such propensity . ”
174078	174128	174040	174040	he	125	“ I learnt like other people , but it was the only thing I could not do as well as Grace , and I thought it wasted time , and was a young ladyism ; but if can recover music enough to please him , I should be glad . ”
174129	174133	174135	174135	Alick	125	“ Thank you , ”
174139	174163	174135	174135	Alick	125	“ He is very much pleased with your voice in speaking . Indeed , I believe I first heard it with his ears . ”
174164	174175	174177	174177	Rachel	128	“ This is a thorough lady ’s collection of music , ”
174189	174199	174177	174177	Rachel	128	“ Altogether the house has not a bachelor look . ”
174200	174352	174040	174040	he	125	“ Did you not know that he had been married ? It was when he first had the living twelve years ago . She was a very lovely young thing , half Irish , and this was the happiest place in the world for two years , till her little brother was sent home here from school without proper warning of a fever that had begun there . We all had it , but she and her baby were the only ones that did not recover ! There they lie , under the yew - tree , where my uncle likes to teach the children . He was terribly struck down for years , though he went manfully to his work , and it has been remarkable how his spirits and sociability have returned since he lost his sight ; indeed , he is more consistently bright than ever he was . ”
174353	174362	174364	174364	Rachel	128	“ I never saw any one like him , ”
174366	174424	174364	174364	Rachel	128	“ I have fallen in with clergy that some call holy , and with some that others call pious , but he is not a bit like either . He is not even grave , yet there is a calming , refreshing sense of reverence towards him that would be awe , only it is so happy . ”
174448	174461	174462	174462	she	128	“ What a comfort your long stay with him must have been , ”
174466	174474	174462	174462	she	128	“ in the beginning of his blindness ! ”
174475	174515	174516	174516	he	125	“ I hope so . It was an ineffable comfort to me to come here out of Littleworthy croquet , and I think cheering me did him good . Rachel , you may do and say what you please , ”
174521	174529	174516	174516	he	125	“ since you have taken to him . ”
174530	174537	174539	174539	Rachel	128	“ I could not help it , ”
174583	174593	174580	174580	she	128	“ Will he like the piano to be used ? ”
174594	174614	174580	174580	she	128	“ Of all things . Bessie ’s singing is his delight . Look , could we get this up ? ”
174615	174629	174580	174580	she	128	“ You do n’t sing , Alick ! I mean , do you ? ”
174630	174641	174642	174642	Rachel	128	“ We need not betray our talents to worldlings base . ”
174775	174785	174760	174760	he	125	“ What , you can read Hebrew , Alick ? ”
174786	174791	174740	174740	he	125	“ So can you . ”
174792	174806	174760	174760	he	125	“ Enough to appreciate the disputed passages . When did you study it ? ”
174807	174828	174829	174829	She	128	“ I learnt enough , when I was laid up , to look out my uncle ’s texts for him . ”
175589	175597	175598	175598	she	128	“ Yet this ca n’t be all , ”
175615	175660	175598	175598	she	128	“ is it a trance , or am I myself ? I have not unthought or unfelt , yet I seem falling into a very sweet hypocrisy ! Alick says thought will come back with strength . I do n’t think I wish it ! ”
176121	176139	176111	176111	she	128	“ At last ! Where did you hide yourself ? I had begun to imagine dire mischances . ”
176140	176149	176111	176111	she	128	“ Only in the corner by the chancel . ”
176150	176193	176111	176111	she	128	“ Alick ’s old nook ! Keeping up honeymoon privileges ! I have kept your secret faithfully . No one knows you are not on the top of Snowdon , or you would have had all the world to call on you . ”
176194	176202	176204	176204	Alick	125	“ There are always the Earlsworthy woods , ”
176206	176224	176226	176226	Bessie	204	“ Or better still , come to Timber End . No one penetrates to my morning room , ”
176228	176234	176235	176235	she	204	“ Now , Uncle George , ”
176243	176267	176235	176235	she	204	“ you have had a full allowance of them for three days , you must spare them to me to - morrow morning . ”
176268	176277	176278	176278	he	4054	“ So it is you , my lady , ”
176286	176305	176278	176278	he	4054	“ I heard a sort of hail - storm of dignity sailing in ! How is Lord Keith ? ”
176306	176341	176342	176342	She	204	“ Very stiff . I want him to have advice , but he hates doctors . What is the last Avonmouth news ? Is Ermine in good heart , and the boys well again ? ”
176475	176478	176480	176480	Alick	125	“ Rachel , ”
176490	176505	176480	176480	Alick	125	“ I wonder if you would be greatly disappointed if our travels ended here . ”
176506	176516	176480	176480	Alick	125	“ I am only too glad of the quiet . ”
176517	176631	176480	176480	Alick	125	“ Because Lifford is in great need of thorough rest . He has not been away for more than a year , and now he is getting quite knocked up . All he does care to do , is to take lodgings near his wife ’s asylum , poor man , and see her occasionally : sad work , but it is rest , and winds him up again ; and there is no one but myself to whom he likes to leave my uncle . Strangers always do too little or too much ; and there is a young man at Littleworthy for the long vacation who can help on a Sunday . ”
176632	176645	176480	176480	Alick	125	“ Oh , pray let us stay as long as we can ! ”
176646	176652	176480	176480	Alick	125	“ Giving up the Cretins ? ”
176653	176691	176480	176480	Alick	125	“ It is no sacrifice . I am thankful not to be hunted about ; and if anything could make me better pleased to be here , it would be feeling that I was not hindering you . ”
176692	176720	176480	176480	Alick	125	“ Then I will hunt him away for six weeks or two months at least . It will be a great relief to my uncle ’s mind . ”
177450	177461	177445	177445	Rachel	128	“ What you , Rachel ! you who despised allopathy ! ”
177462	177471	177445	177445	Rachel	128	“ I have learnt not to despise advice . ”
177482	177575	177473	177473	Bessie	204	“ There ’s some old Scotch doctor to whom his faith is given , and that I do n’t half believe in . If he would see our own Mr. Harvey here it would be quite another thing ; but it is of no use telling him that Alick would never have had an available knee but for Mr. Harvey ’s management . He persists in leaving me to my personal trust in him , but for himself he wo n’t see him at any price ! Have you seen Mr. Harvey ? ”
177576	177583	177614	177616	a young man	6798	“ I have seen no one . ”
177584	177598	177473	177473	Bessie	204	“ Oh , I forgot , you are not arrived yet ; but — ”
177599	177605	177607	177607	Rachel	128	“ There ’s some one , ”
177631	177651	177622	177622	Bessie	204	“ Never mind , my dear , he is quite inoffensive , we ’ll soon get rid of him . ”
177659	177674	177655	177655	he	6798	“ Good morning , Lady Keith , I thought I should find you here , ”
177679	177703	177675	177675	she	204	“ If you had been proper behaved and gone to the door , you would have known that I am not at home . ”
177711	177740	177741	177741	she	204	“ No , I am not at home , and , what is more , I do not mean to be . My uncle will be here directly , ”
177753	177768	177741	177741	she	204	“ Then it is not true that your brother and his bride are arrived ? ”
177769	177800	177807	177807	him	6798	“ True in the same sense as that I am at home . There she is , you see — only you are not to see her on any account , ”
177811	177847	177807	177807	him	6798	“ Now mind you have not been introduced to Mrs. Keith , and if you utter a breath that will bring the profane crowd in shoals upon the Rectory , I shall never forgive you . ”
177848	177867	177741	177741	she	204	“ Then I am afraid we must not hope to see you at the bazaar for the idiots . ”
177868	177873	177874	177874	Bessie	204	“ No , indeed , ”
177884	177901	177874	177874	Bessie	204	“ no one is to infringe her incog , under penalty of never coming here again . ”
177902	177907	177908	177908	he	6798	“ You are going ? ”
177913	177946	177908	177908	he	6798	“ indeed , that was what brought me here . My sisters sent me to ask whether they may shelter themselves under your matronly protection , for my mother dreads the crush . ”
177947	177985	177874	177874	Bessie	204	“ I suppose , as they put my name down , that I must go , but you know I had much rather give the money outright . It is a farce to call a bazaar charity . ”
177986	178002	177908	177908	he	6798	“ Call it what you will , it is one device for a little sensation . ”
178094	178100	178102	178102	Bessie	204	“ I am so sorry , ”
178106	178134	178102	178102	Bessie	204	“ I had taken precautions against invasion , but he did not go to the front door . I do so hope Rachel has not been fluttered . ”
178135	178143	178145	178145	Alick	125	“ I thought he was at Rio , ”
178147	178239	178145	178145	Alick	125	“ He could not stand the climate , and was sent home about a month ago — a regular case of bad shilling , I am afraid , poor fellow ! I am so sorry he came to startle Rachel , but I swore him over to secrecy . He is not to mention to any living creature that she is nearer than Plinlimmon till the incog , is laid aside ! I know how to stand up for bridal privileges , and not to abuse the confidence placed in me . ”
178299	178308	178252	178253	the sister	2662	“ He seems extremely tame about the garden . ”
178309	178368	178252	178253	the sister	2662	“ Or he would not have fallen on Rachel . It was only a chance ; he just brought over a message about that tiresome bazaar that has been dinned into our ears for the last three months . A bazaar for idiots they may well call it ! They wanted a carving of yours , Uncle George ! ”
178369	178386	178388	178389	Mr. Clare	241	“ I am afraid I gave little Alice Bertie one in a weak moment , Bessie , ”
178391	178403	178388	178389	Mr. Clare	241	“ but I hardly durst show my face to Lifford afterwards . ”
178404	178415	178417	178417	Bessie	204	“ After all , it is better than some bazaars , ”
178419	178460	178417	178417	Bessie	204	“ it is only for the idiot asylum , and I could not well refuse my name and countenance to my old neighbours , though I stood out against taking a stall . Lord Keith would not have liked it . ”
178461	178471	178473	178473	Alick	125	“ Will he be able to go with you ? ”
178475	178560	178473	178473	Alick	125	“ Oh , no ; it would be an intolerable bore , and his Scottish thrift would never stand the sight of people making such very bad bargains ! No , I am going to take the Carleton girls in , they are very accommodating , and I can get away whenever I please . I am much too forbearing to ask any of you to go with me , though I believe Uncle George is pining to go and see after his carving . ”
178561	178609	178473	178473	Alick	125	“ No , thank you ; after what I heard of the last bazaar I made up my mind that they are no places for an old parson , nor for his carvings either , so you are quite welcome to fall on me for my inconsistency . ”
178610	178623	178625	178625	Bessie	204	“ Not now , when you have a holiday from Mr. Lifford , ”
178627	178635	178625	178625	Bessie	204	“ Now come and smell the roses . ”
178673	178684	178670	178670	he	125	“ I think I must go to this idiotical bazaar ! ”
178685	178688	178690	178690	Rachel	128	“ You ! ”
178692	178711	178690	178690	Rachel	128	“ Yes ; I do n’t think Bessie ought to go by herself with all this Carleton crew . ”
178712	178721	178723	178723	Rachel	128	“ You do n’t wish me to go , ”
178730	178759	178723	178723	Rachel	128	“ You ! My dear Rachel , I would not take you for fifty pounds , nor could I go myself without leaving you as vice deputy curate . ”
178760	178766	178768	178769	Mr. Clare	241	“ No need for that , ”
178776	178792	178768	178769	Mr. Clare	241	“ young people must not talk secrets with a blind man ’s ears behind them . ”
178793	178799	178801	178801	Alick	125	“ I make no secret , ”
178803	178829	178801	178801	Alick	125	“ I could not go without leaving my wife to take care of my uncle , or my uncle to take care of my wife . ”
178830	178839	178841	178842	Mr. Clare	241	“ And you think you ought to go ? ”
178844	178890	178841	178842	Mr. Clare	241	“ It is certainly better that Bessie should have a gentleman with her in the crowd ; but you know this is a gossiping neighbourhood , and you must be prepared for amazement at your coming into public alone not three weeks after your wedding . ”
178891	178907	178801	178801	Alick	125	“ I ca n’t help it , she ca n’t go , and I must . ”
178908	178924	178841	178842	Mr. Clare	241	“ And you will bring down all the morning visitors that you talk of dreading . ”
178925	178940	178941	178941	he	241	“ We will leave you to amuse them , sir . Much better that , ”
178947	178965	178966	178966	Rachel	128	“ than to leave the very semblance of a secret trusted by her to that intolerable puppy — ”
178985	179006	178977	178978	Mr. Clare	241	“ I beg your pardon , Alick , but you should be quite sure that your wife likes this proposal . ”
179007	179021	179023	179023	Alick	125	“ That ’s the value of a strong - minded wife , sir , ”
179025	179038	179023	179023	Alick	125	“ she is not given to making a fuss about small matters . ”
179039	179050	178977	178978	Mr. Clare	241	“ Most ladies might not think this a small matter . ”
179051	179080	179023	179023	Alick	125	“ That is because they have no perspective in their brains . Rachel understands me a great deal too well to make me explain what is better unspoken . ”
179081	179103	179023	179023	Alick	125	“ You know what I think , Alick , that you are the strictest judge that ever a merry girl had . ”
179104	179127	179128	179128	Alick	125	“ I had rather you continued to think so , uncle ; I should like to think so myself . Good night . ”
179548	179553	179554	179554	he	241	“ A sickening place , ”
179557	179564	179554	179554	he	241	“ I am glad I went . ”
179565	179576	179697	179698	DE GIRARDIN	428	“ How glad Bessie must have been to have you ! ”
179577	179597	179554	179554	he	241	“ I believe she was . She has too much good taste for much of what went on there . ”
179598	179602	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ I doubt , ”
179609	179619	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ if you could have been an agreeable acquisition . ”
179620	179653	179554	179554	he	241	“ I do n’t know . Bessie fools one into thinking oneself always doing her a favour . Oh , Rachel , I am thankful you have never taken to being agreeable . ”
179654	179692	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ Une femme egoiste , non seulement de coeur , mais d’esprit , ne pent pas sortir d’elle - meme . Le moi est indelible chez elle . Une veritable egoiste ne sait meme pas etre fausse . ”
179700	179708	179710	179711	Lady Keith	249	“ I am come to prepare you , ”
179729	179752	179714	179714	her	249	“ Mrs. Huntsford is on her way to call and make a dead set to get you all to a garden party . ”
179753	179763	179554	179554	he	241	“ Then we are off to the Earlsworthy Woods . ”
179764	179800	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ Nay , listen , Alick . I have let you alone and defended you for a whole month , but if you persist in shutting up you wife , people wo n’t stand it . ”
179801	179809	179714	179714	her	249	“ Which of us is the Mahometan ? ”
179810	179864	179554	179554	he	241	“ You are pitied ! But you see it was a strong thing our appearing without our several incumbrances , and though an old married woman like me may do as she pleases , yet for a bridegroom of not three weeks ’ standing to resort to bazaars solus argues some weighty cause . ”
179865	179870	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ And argues rightly . ”
179871	179887	179714	179714	her	249	“ Then you are content to be supposed to have an unproduceably eccentric melancholy bride ? ”
179888	179916	179554	179554	he	241	“ Better they should think so than that she should be so . She has been victimized enough already to her mother ’s desire to save appearances . ”
179917	180005	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ You do not half believe me , Alick , and this is really a very kind , thoughtful arrangement of Mrs. Huntsford ’s . She consulted me , saying there were such odd stories about you two that she was most anxious that Rachel should appear and confute them ; and she thought that an out - of - door party like this would suit best , because it would be early , and Rachel could get away if she found it too much for her . ”
180006	180017	179714	179714	her	249	“ After being walked out to satisfy a curious neighbourhood . ”
180018	180043	179554	179554	he	241	“ Now Alick , do consider it . This sort of thing could remind her of nothing painful ; Uncle George would enjoy it . ”
180044	180052	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ And fall over the croquet traps . ”
180053	180071	179714	179714	her	249	“ No ; if you wanted to attend to him , I could take care of Rachel . ”
180072	180149	179554	179554	he	241	“ I can not tell , Bessie , I believe it is pure goodnature on Mrs. Huntsford ’s part , but if we go , it must be from Rachel ’s spontaneous movement . I will not press her on any account . I had rather the world said she was crazy at once than expose her to the risk of one of the dreadful nights that haunted us till we came here to perfect quiet . ”
180150	180208	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ But she is well now . She looks better and nicer than I ever saw her . Really , Alick , now her face is softer , and her eyes more veiled , and her chin not cocked up , I am quite proud of her . Every one will be struck with her good looks . ”
180209	180214	180215	180215	he	4148	“ Flattery , Bessie , ”
180222	180264	180215	180215	he	4148	“ Yes , she is much better , and more like herself ; but I dread all this being overthrown . If she herself wishes to go , it may be a good beginning , but she must not be persuaded . ”
180265	180293	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ Then I must not even tell her that she wo n’t be required to croquet , and that I ’ll guard her from all civil speeches . ”
180294	180321	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ No , for indeed , Bessie , on your own account and Lord Keith ’s , you should hardly spend a long afternoon from home . ”
180322	180361	180215	180215	he	4148	“ Here ’s the war in the enemy ’s quarters ! As to fatigue , dawdling about Mrs. Huntsford ’s garden , is much the same as dawdling about my own , and makes me far more entertaining . ”
180362	180390	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ I can not help thinking , Bessie , that Lord Keith is more ill than you suppose . I am sure he is in constant pain . ”
180391	180396	180398	180398	Bessie	204	“ So I fear , ”
180402	180421	180398	180398	Bessie	204	“ but what can be done ? He will see no one but his old surgeon in Edinburgh . ”
180422	180428	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ Then take him there . ”
180429	180455	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ Take him ? You must know what it is to be in the hands of a clever woman before you make such a proposal . ”
180456	180473	180398	180398	Bessie	204	“ You are a cleverer woman than my wife in bringing about what you really wish . ”
180474	180515	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ Just consider , Alick , our own house is uninhabitable , and this one on our hands — my aunt coming to me in a month ’s time . You do n’t ask me to do what is reasonable . ”
180516	180563	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ I can not tell , Bessie . You can be the only judge of what is regard of the right kind for your husband ’s health or for yourself ; and see , there is Mrs. Huntsford actually arrived , and talking to my uncle . ”
180564	180620	179604	179605	Mr. Clare	241	“ One moment , Alick : I am not going to insult myself so far as to suppose that poor Charlie Carleton ’s being at home has anything to do with your desire to deport me , but I want you to know that he did not come home till after we were settled here . ”
180621	180633	180635	180635	he	4149	“ I do not wish to enter into details , Bessie , ”
180848	180859	180861	180861	she	204	“ You did not wish me to refuse , Alick , ”
180887	180894	180895	180895	he	125	“ No , not at all , ”
180898	180922	180923	180923	he	125	“ it is likely to be a pleasant affair , and my uncle will be delighted to have us with him . No , ”
180935	181024	180928	180928	she	204	“ it is the old story . My sister ! Poor little thing ! I always feel as though I wore more unkind and unjust to her than any one else , and yet we are never together without my feeling as if she was deceiving herself and me ; and yet it is all so fair and well reasoned that one is always left in the wrong . I regretted this marriage extremely at first , and I am not the less disposed to regret it now . ”
181025	181046	180923	180923	he	125	“ Indeed ! Every one says how attentive she is to him , and how nicely they go on together . ”
181047	181132	180928	180928	she	204	“ Pshaw , Rachel ! that is just the way . A few words and pretty ways pass with her and all the world for attention , when she is wherever her fancy calls her , all for his good . It is just the attention she showed my uncle . And now it is her will and pleasure to queen it here among her old friends , and she will not open her eyes to see the poor old man ’s precarious state . ”
181133	181144	180928	180928	she	204	“ Do you think him so very ill , Alick ? ”
181145	181215	180923	180923	he	125	“ I was shocked when I saw him yesterday . As to sciatica , that is all nonsense ; the blow in his side has done some serious damage , and if it is not well looked - to , who knows what will be the end of it ! And then , a gay young widow with no control over her — I hate to think of it . ”
181216	181219	181221	181221	Rachel	128	“ Indeed , ”
181223	181271	181221	181221	Rachel	128	“ she is so warm and bright , and really earnest in her kindness , that she will be sure to see her own way right at home . I do n’t think we can guess how obstinate Lord Keith may be in refusing to take advice . ”
181272	181280	181282	181282	Alick	125	“ He cut me off pretty short , ”
181284	181356	181282	181282	Alick	125	“ I am afraid he will see no one here ; and , as Bessie says , the move to Scotland would not be easy just now . As I said , she leaves one in the wrong , and I do n’t like the future . But it is of no use to talk of it ; so let us come and see if my uncle wants to go anywhere . ”
181759	181769	181771	181771	Alick	125	“ That is what I call well turned out , ”
181778	181787	181789	181790	Mr. Clare	241	“ Describe her dress , if you please , ”
181792	181802	181789	181790	Mr. Clare	241	“ I like to hear how my nieces look . ”
181808	181884	181886	181886	he	125	“ There , stroke it down , a long white feather in a shady hat trimmed with dark green , velvet ; she is fresh and rosy , you know , sir , and looks well in green , and then , is it Grace ’s taste , Rachel ? for it is the prettiest thing you have worn — a pale buff sort of silky thing , embroidered all over in the same colour , ”
181899	181904	181906	181907	Mr. Clare	241	“ Indian , surely , ”
181913	181924	181906	181907	Mr. Clare	241	“ it is too intricate and graceful for the West . ”
181925	181928	181930	181930	Alick	125	“ Yes , ”
181932	181981	181930	181930	Alick	125	“ I remember now , Grace showed it to me . It was one that Lady Temple brought from India , and never had made up . Poor Grace could get no sympathy from Rachel about the wedding clothes , so she was obliged to come to me . ”
181982	181997	181999	181999	Rachel	128	“ And I thought you did not know one of my things from another , ”
182001	182010	181999	181999	Rachel	128	“ Do you really mean that you care ? ”
182011	182022	182024	182025	Mr. Clare	241	“ Depend upon it , he does , my dear , ”
182027	182038	182024	182025	Mr. Clare	241	“ I have heard him severely critical on his cousins . ”
182039	182050	182052	182052	Rachel	128	“ He has been very good in not tormenting me , ”
182059	182065	182067	182067	Alick	125	“ I apprehended the consequences , ”
182069	182105	182067	182067	Alick	125	“ and besides , you never mounted that black lace pall , or curtain , or whatever you call it , upon your head , after your first attempt at frightening me away with it . ”
182106	182116	182118	182119	Mr. Clare	241	“ A cap set against , instead of at , ”
182210	182214	182215	182215	she	249	“ Well met , ”
182218	182236	182215	182215	she	249	“ I called at the Rectory to take up Rachel , but you were flown before me . ”
182237	182246	182183	182183	She	249	“ Yes , we went through the Park . ”
182247	182279	182280	182280	she	249	“ I wish the Duke would come home . I ca n’t go that way now till I have called . I have no end of things to say to you , ”
182304	182379	182298	182298	she	249	“ Who do you think is come ? Colin Keith made his appearance this morning . He has safely captured his Ouralian bear , though not without plenty of trouble , and he could not get him on to Avonmouth till he had been to some chemical institution about an invention . Colin thought him safe there , and rushed down by the train to see us . They go on to - morrow . ”
182380	182389	182391	182391	Alick	125	“ What did he think of Lord Keith ? ”
182415	182424	182426	182426	Bessie	204	“ He has settled the matter about advice , ”
182430	182513	182426	182426	Bessie	204	“ you can not think what a relief it is . I mean , as soon as I get home , to write and ask Mr. Harvey to come and talk to me to - morrow , and see if the journey to Edinburgh is practicable . I almost thought of sending an apology , and driving over to consult him this afternoon , but I did not like to disappoint Mrs. Huntsford , and I thought Rachel would feel herself lost . ”
182514	182518	182520	182520	Rachel	128	“ Thank you , ”
182522	182539	182520	182520	Rachel	128	“ but could we not go away early , and go round by Mr. Harvey ’s ? ”
182540	182581	182582	182582	Alick	125	“ Unluckily I have sent the ponies home , and told the close carriage to come for me at nine . It was all settled , and I do n’t want to alarm Lord Keith by coming home too soon . ”
182649	182652	182655	182655	Bessie	204	“ company . ”
182723	182726	182716	182718	a little girl	6994	“ Aunt Mary ”
182821	182828	182829	182829	he	125	“ How is it with you ? ”
182833	182851	182829	182829	he	125	“ you know you can go home in a moment if you have had enough of this . ”
182852	182870	182805	182805	Alick	125	“ No , I want nothing , now I have found you . Where is your uncle ? ”
182871	182910	182805	182805	Alick	125	“ Fallen upon one of his oldest friends , who will take care of him , and well out of the way of the croquet traps . Where ’s my Lady ? I thought you were with her . ”
182911	182945	182829	182829	he	125	“ She disappeared while I was talking to that good Miss Penwell ! You must be pleased now , Alick , you see she is really going to see about going to Scotland . ”
182946	182966	182805	182805	Alick	125	“ I should be better pleased if she had not left that poor old man alone till nine o’clock . ”
182967	182982	182805	182805	Alick	125	“ She says that when he has his man Saunders to read to him — ”
182983	183001	183002	183002	He	4205	“ Do n’t tell me what she says ; I have enough of that at first hand . ”
183182	183188	183171	183171	Rachel	128	“ Bessie , the hoop ! ”
183263	183268	183269	183269	she	128	“ No , no , ”
183272	183290	183291	183291	she	128	“ Do n’t let him come ; do n’t let him call any one , do n’t , ”
183363	183377	183378	183378	she	128	“ I do n’t know if I have not twisted myself a little , ”
183388	183402	183378	183378	she	128	“ but it will go off . Rachel , how scared you look ! ”
183403	183408	183410	183410	Rachel	128	“ Do n’t laugh , ”
183467	183486	183453	183453	her	128	“ Shall I drive you home ? Alick can walk home with his uncle when he is ready . ”
183487	183504	183505	183505	she	128	“ Home ! Thank you , Rachel , pray do . Not that I am hurt , ”
183512	183528	183505	183505	she	128	“ only these rags would tell tales , and there would be an intolerable fuss . ”
183529	183542	183544	183544	Alick	125	“ Then I will bring the carriage round to the road there , ”
183546	183565	183505	183505	she	128	“ I told Joe to be in readiness , and you need not go back to the house . ”
183566	183578	183579	183579	she	128	“ Thank you . But , oh , send him away ! ”
183587	183605	183579	183579	she	128	“ Only do n’t let him tell any one . Tell him I desire he will not . ”
183629	183661	183622	183622	Rachel	128	“ I do n’t feel it ; I do n’t believe in it . My dear , your strong mind is all humbug , or you would not look so frightened , ”
183673	183708	183664	183664	she	128	“ it is only that I ca n’t stand a chorus of old ladies in commotion . How happy Alick must be to have his prediction verified by some one tumbling over a hoop ! ”
183731	183763	183721	183721	she	128	“ Do n’t let him come , dear Rachel ; go to him , tell him I am well , but keep him away , and mind he tells no one ! ”
183865	183924	183925	183925	She	128	“ The miserable simpleton ! Rachel , Alick was right . I thought , I little thought he would forget how things stand now , but he got back to the old strain , as if — I shall make Lord Keith go to Scotland any way now . I was so thankful to see you and Alick . ”
183956	184042	183944	183944	she	128	“ What could possess him ? For years he had followed me about like a little dog , and never said more than I let him ; and now what folly was in his head , just because I could not walk as far as the ruin with the others . When I said I was going to Scotland , what business had he to — Oh ! the others will be coming back , Rachel , could we not go to meet the carriage ? ”
184361	184370	184371	184371	she	128	“ Oh , Alick ! oh , uncle ! ”
184375	184403	184371	184371	she	128	“ Bessie says she is shocked to have turned your house upside down , but we could not go any further . And her baby is born ! ”
184418	184502	184371	184371	she	128	“ Yes , it is all right , so Nurse Jones says . I could not send to you , for we had to send everywhere at once . Mr. Harvey was not at home , and we telegraphed to London , but no one has come yet , and now I have just written a note to Lord Keith with the news of his son and heir . And , uncle , she has set her heart on your baptizing him directly . ”
184621	184632	184612	184612	she	436	“ that the lady was in a way about it , ”
184821	184825	184826	184826	her	128	“ Alexander Clare , ”
184845	184861	184840	184840	she	4964	“ Make Alick kiss him , Rachel , and do homage to his young chieftain . ”
184989	184992	184993	184993	she	204	“ Alexander ! ”
184997	185037	184993	184993	she	204	“ I always promised my child that he should not have a stupid second son ’s name . I had a right to my own father ’s and brother ’s name , and now it ca n’t be altered , ”
185049	185097	185103	185103	she	204	“ not that I would have hurried it on if I had not thought it right , poor little fellow , but now I trust he will do nicely , and I do think we have managed it all with less trouble than might have been expected . ”
185155	185159	185160	185160	he	426	“ at her age ”
185701	185707	185696	185696	he	241	“ They are coming down , ”
185751	185760	185761	185761	he	241	“ After all , this may mean nothing , ”
185764	185778	185780	185780	Rachel	128	“ Oh , we do n’t make it better by fancying it nothing , ”
185782	185832	185833	185833	He	125	“ Let us try to meet it like your uncle . Oh , Alick , it seemed all this time as if I could pray again , as I never could since those sad times . He seemed so sure , such a rock to help and lean on . ”
185840	185847	185848	185848	he	125	“ You are praying for her ! ”
185924	185927	185928	185928	he	125	“ Children , ”
185931	185946	185928	185928	he	125	“ it is as we feared . This great sorrow is coming on us . ”
185947	185953	185955	185955	Alick	125	“ Then there is danger , ”
185960	185965	185967	185968	his uncle	1716	“ More than danger , ”
185970	185980	185967	185968	his uncle	1716	“ they have tried all that skill can do . ”
185981	185987	185989	185989	Alick	125	“ Was it the fall ? ”
185991	186002	186004	186004	Rachel	128	“ It was my bad management , it always is , ”
186009	186015	186017	186018	Mr. Clare	241	“ No , dear child , ”
186020	186052	186017	186018	Mr. Clare	241	“ there was fatal injury in the fall , and even absolute stillness for the last few hours could hardly have saved her . You have nothing to reproach yourself with . ”
186053	186057	186059	186059	Alick	125	“ And now ! ”
186063	186102	186059	186059	Alick	125	“ Much more exhausted than when we were with her ; sometimes faint , but still feverish . They think it may last many hours yet , poor dear child , she has so much youth and strength . ”
186103	186108	186017	186018	Mr. Clare	241	“ Does she know ? ”
186109	186139	186059	186059	Alick	125	“ Harvey thought some of their measures alarmed her , but they soothed and encouraged her while they saw hope , and he thinks she has no real fears . ”
186140	186148	186150	186150	Alick	125	“ And how is it to be — ”
186152	186156	186150	186150	Alick	125	“ She ought — ”
186157	186221	186222	186222	Rachel	128	“ Yes ; Harvey thinks she ought , she is fully herself , and it can make no difference now . He is gone to judge about coming up at once ; but Alick , my poor boy , you must speak to her . I have found that without seeing the face I can not judge what my words may be doing . ”
186272	186282	186284	186284	Alick	125	“ You had better let me go in first , ”
186299	186308	186310	186310	Rachel	128	“ Not if she is asking for me , ”
186348	186464	186338	186338	her	204	“ I thought you would stay to see the doctors off . They had their revenge for our stealing a march on them , and have prowled about me till I was quite faint ; and now I do n’t feel a bit like sleep , though I am so tired . Would Alick think me very wicked if I kept you a little while ? Do n’t I see Alick ’s shadow ? Dear old fellow , are you come to wish me good - night ? That is good of you . I am not going to plague you any more , Alick , I shall be so good now ! But what ? ”
186480	186491	186338	186338	her	204	“ Oh ! there is nothing wrong with the baby ? ”
186492	186503	186505	186505	Alick	125	“ No , dear Bessie , not with the baby , ”
186511	186516	186517	186517	she	4299	“ What , myself ? ”
186603	186654	186596	186597	the doctor	5016	“ Then I think my poor old Lord Keith had better have his night ’s rest in peace . But , oh ! I should like to speak to Colin . Send for him , Alick ; telegraph , Alick ; he is at the Paddington Hotel . Send directly . ”
186669	186672	186673	186673	she	4299	“ Rachel , ”
186678	186702	186705	186705	her	4299	“ Ermine must marry him now , and see to Lord Keith , and the little one — tell her so , please , ”
186709	186786	186673	186673	she	4299	“ he will seem like your own child , dear Rachel , and you should have him ; but you ’ll have a wandering home with the dear old Highlanders . Oh ! I wonder if he will ever go into them , there must always be a Keith there , and they say he is sure of the Victoria Cross , though papa will not send up his name because of being his own son . ”
186796	186815	186789	186789	her	4304	exclaimed—“Wasn’t I talking great nonsense , Rachel ? I do n’t seem able to say what I mean . ”
186816	186823	186825	186825	Rachel	128	“ It is weakness , dearest , ”
186827	186846	186825	186825	Rachel	128	“ perhaps you might gain a little strength if you were quite still and listened to my uncle . ”
186847	186931	186789	186789	her	4304	“ Presently . O Rachel ! I like the sound of your voice ; I am glad Alick has got you . You suit him better than his wicked little sister ever did . You have been so kind to me to - night , Rachel ; I never thought I should have loved you so well , when I quizzed you . I did use you ill then , Rachel , but I think you won Alick by it just by force of contrast,”—she
186949	186957	186959	186959	Bessie	204	“ It ca n’t make any difference , ”
186961	187023	186959	186959	Bessie	204	“ and I ’ll try to be quiet and do all right , if you ’ll just let me have my child again . I do want to know who he is like . I am so glad it is not he that was hurt . Oh ! I did so want to have brought him up to be like Alick . ”
187128	187147	187148	187148	she	204	“ near the willow - tree ; not next to my aunt , I ’m not good enough , ”
187151	187181	187148	187148	she	204	“ but I could not bear that old ruined abbey , where all the Keiths go , and Alick always wanted me to be here — Alick was right ! ”
187258	187299	187216	187216	she	204	“ He ought not ! I thought he knew better ! Alick was right ! Come away , Rachel , I ’ll never see him again . I have done nothing that he should insult me . Alick was right ! ”
187356	187367	187412	187412	she	204	“ Alick , indeed you do like to attribute motives , ”
187370	187380	187412	187412	she	204	“ Indeed it is not all self - deception , ”
187386	187400	187412	187412	she	204	“ Alick is right , only do n’t let him be so angry ! ”
187568	187581	187582	187582	He	5016	“ I feared she would have suffered much more . Thank God ! ”
188486	188502	188538	188538	her	128	“ That we may embrace and ever hold fast the blessed hope of everlasting life . ”
188695	188760	188691	188692	Mr. Clare	241	“ No , my dear , this is not a day to do without such a beginning . We must do what we can . Or stay , it is the last chapter of St. John . I could hardly fail in that . Sit near me , and give me the word if I do , unless you want to be with Alick . ”
188898	188904	188888	188888	she	128	“ It is the Lord . ”
188975	189048	189049	189049	Rachel	128	“ Dear child , no one could be expected to keep the place when there was so much to dwell on in the very comfort of the chapter . And now if you are not in haste , would you take me to the place that dear Bessie spoke of , by the willow - tree . I am almost afraid little Mary Lawrence ’s grave may have left too little space . ”
189141	189144	189146	189146	Rachel	128	“ Yes , ”
189148	189166	189146	189146	Rachel	128	“ there is such a quiet freshness , and the willow - tree seems to guard it . ”
189167	189178	189242	189242	his	241	“ Is there not a white foxglove on the bank ? ”
189179	189198	189146	189146	Rachel	128	“ Yes , but with only a bell or two left at the top of the side spikes . ”
189199	189239	189242	189242	his	241	“ Your aunt sowed the seed . It is strange that I was very near choosing this place nine years ago , but it could not be seen from my window , which was an object with me then . ”
189265	189273	189256	189256	Rachel	128	“ It is that unhappy Mr. Carleton . ”
189274	189279	189281	189282	Mr. Clare	241	“ Poor young fellow , ”
189292	189300	189281	189282	Mr. Clare	241	“ I had better speak to him . ”
189508	189512	189514	189514	Alick	125	“ Can you ? ”
189516	189525	189514	189514	Alick	125	“ Ought you not to be at Avoncester ? ”
189526	189541	189514	189514	Alick	125	“ I am not a witness , and the case is in excellent hands . ”
189542	189563	189514	189514	Alick	125	“ Could you not run down ? I shall be available tomorrow , and I could be with Lord Keith . ”
189564	189579	189581	189581	Colin	236	“ Thank you , Alick , it is impossible for me to leave him , ”
189782	189800	189753	189753	she	128	“ Nothing should have induced her , but her poor son was in such a dreadful state . ”
189916	189919	189896	189896	she	444	“ Yes , ”
189941	189949	190028	190029	Mrs. Carleton	444	“ she was exceedingly distressed and displeased , ”
189972	189975	189976	189976	she	444	“ Ah ! ”
189979	190013	189976	189976	she	444	“ it was right , quite right . It was very wrong of my poor boy . Indeed I am not excusing him , but if you only knew how he blames himself . ”
190014	190021	190022	190022	Rachel	128	“ I am sure he ought , ”
190569	190572	190573	190573	she	128	“ Indeed , ”
190576	190601	190573	190573	she	128	“ I fear no one can say it was not so ; I do n’t think anything is made better by blinking the reality . ”
190602	190631	190573	190573	she	128	“ Oh , Mrs. Keith , it is so dreadful . I can not tell my poor son . I do n’t know what might be the consequence . ”
190639	190642	190643	190643	she	128	“ Indeed , ”
190646	190767	190768	190768	she	128	“ I am very sorry for you . I believe every one knows that I have felt what it is to be guilty of fatal mischief , but , indeed , indeed I am sure that to realize it all is the only way to endure it , so as to be the better for it . Believe me , I am very sorry , but I do n’t think it would be any real comfort to your son to hear that poor Bessie had never been careful , or that I was inexperienced , or the nurse ignorant . It is better to look at it fairly . I hear Mr. Clare coming in . Will you see him ? ”
190859	190913	190914	190914	She	128	“ I ’m Isabel . I came down from London to - day because it was so very shocking and deplorable , and I am dying to see my poor little brother and uncle Colin . I must keep away from poor papa till the doctors are gone , so I came here . ”
191055	191060	191052	191052	She	308	“ poor dear Bessie , ”
191068	191105	191052	191052	She	308	“ Oh , she was such a darling ! I got on with her immensely . Why did n’t you send to me , though I do n’t know that Donald would have let me come , ”
191163	191258	191157	191157	herself	308	“ It was very odd of them all not to telegraph for me . Those telegrams are such a dreadful shock . There came one just as I set out from Timber End , and I made sure little Sandie was ill at home , for you know the child is very delicate , and there are so many things going about , and what with all this dreadful business , I was ready to faint , and after all it was only a stupid thing for Uncle Colin from those people at Avoncester . ”
191259	191268	191153	191154	Mrs. Menteith	308	“ You do not know what it was ? ”
191269	191345	191153	191154	Mrs. Menteith	308	“ Somebody was convicted or acquitted , I forget which , but I know it had something to do with Uncle Colin ’s journey to Russia ; so ridiculous of him at his age , when he ought to know better , and so unlucky for all the family , his engagement to that swindler ’s sister . By - the - bye , did he not cheat you out of ever so much money ? ”
191346	191373	191157	191157	herself	308	“ Oh , that had nothing to do with it — it was not Miss Williams ’s brother — it was not he that was tried . ”
191374	191479	191153	191154	Mrs. Menteith	308	“ Was n’t he ? I thought he was found guilty or something ; but it is very unfortunate for the family , for Uncle Colin wo n’t give her up , though she is a terrible cripple , too . And to tell you a secret , it was his obstinacy that made papa marry again ; and now it is of no use , this poor little fellow will never live , and this sharper ’s sister will be Lady Keith after all ! So unlucky ! Papa says she is very handsome , and poor Bessie declares she is quite ladylike . ”
191480	191489	191491	191491	Rachel	128	“ The most superior person I ever knew , ”
191495	191516	191491	191491	Rachel	128	“ Ah , yes , of course she must be very clever and artful if her brother is a swindler . ”
191517	191533	191153	191154	Mrs. Menteith	308	“ But indeed he is not , he was cheated ; the swindler was Maddox . ”
191534	191637	191153	191154	Mrs. Menteith	308	“ Oh , but he was a glass - blower , or something , I know , and her sister is a governess . I am sure it is no fault of mine ! The parties I gave to get him and Jessie Douglas together ! Donald was quite savage about the bills . And after all Uncle Colin went and caught cold , and would not come ! I would not have minded half so much if it had been Jessie Douglas ; but to have her at Gowanbrae — a glass - blower ’s daughter — isn’t it too bad ? ”
191638	191650	191491	191491	Rachel	128	“ Her father was a clergyman of a good Welsh family . ”
191651	191667	191153	191154	Mrs. Menteith	308	“ Was he ? Then her brother or somebody had something to do with glass . ”
191696	191744	191745	191745	She	1820	“ those horrid doctors will be gone now , and I will be able to see poor papa , and tell him when I will take home the baby , though I do n’t believe he will live to be taken anywhere , poor dear little man . ”
191808	191818	191820	191821	Mr. Clare	241	“ You are tired with your visitors my dear , ”
191836	191842	191843	191843	she	128	“ How do you know ? ”
191846	191873	191843	191843	she	128	“ By the sound of your move across the room , and the stream of talk I heard above must be enough to exhaust any one . ”

191980	192002	192003	192003	she	128	“ And I am afraid she is gone to talk Alick to death ! I wonder when Alick will come home , ”
192013	192043	192003	192003	she	128	“ She says Colonel Keith had a telegram about the result of the trial , but she does not know what it was , nor indeed who was tried . ”
192044	192058	192060	192061	Mr. Clare	241	“ Alick will not keep you in doubt longer than he can help , ”
192063	192070	192072	192072	Rachel	128	“ You know all about it ; ”
192074	192091	192072	192072	Rachel	128	“ The facts every one must know , but I mean that which led to them . ”
192092	192102	192003	192003	she	128	“ Alick told me you had suffered very much . ”
192103	192153	192003	192003	she	128	“ I do n’t know whether it is a right question , but if it is , I should much like to know what Alick did say . I begged him to tell you all , or it would not have been fair towards you to bring me here . ”
192154	192185	192003	192003	she	128	“ He told me that he knew you had been blind and wilful , but that your confidence had been cruelly abused , and you had been most unselfish throughout . ”
192186	192206	192003	192003	she	128	“ I did not mean so much what I had done as what I am — what I was . ”
192207	192307	192003	192003	she	128	“ The first time he mentioned you , it was as one of the reasons that he wished to take our dear Bessie to Avonmouth . He said there was a girl there of a strong spirit , independent and thorough - going , and thinking for herself . He said , ‘ to be sure , she generally thinks wrong , but there ’s a candour and simplicity about her that make her wildest blunders better than parrot commonplace , ’ and he thought your reality might impress his sister . Even then I gathered what was coming . ”
192308	192320	192003	192003	she	128	“ And how wrong and foolish you must have thought it . ”
192321	192332	192003	192003	she	128	“ I hoped I might trust my boy ’s judgment . ”
192333	192390	192003	192003	she	128	“ Indeed , you could not think it worse for him than I did ; but I was ill and weak , and could not help letting Alick do what he would ; but I have never understood it . I told him how unsettled my views were , and he did not seem to mind — ”
192391	192409	192003	192003	she	128	“ My dear , may I ask if this sense of being unsettled is with you still ? ”
192410	192505	192003	192003	she	128	“ I do n’t know ! I had no power to read or think for a long time , and now , since I have been here , I hope it has not been hypocrisy , for going on in your way and his has been very sweet to me , and made me feel as I used when I was a young girl , with only an ugly dream between . I do n’t like to look at it , and yet that dream was my real life that I made for myself . ”
192506	192523	192524	192524	Rachel	128	“ Dear child , I have little doubt that Alick knew it would come to this . ”
192527	192553	192524	192524	Rachel	128	“ What , you and he think a woman ’s doubts so vague and shallow as to be always mastered by a husband ’s influence ? ”
192615	192675	192612	192612	she	4416	“ Things will seem to you like trifles , indeed , individual criticisms appear so to me ; but the difficulty to my mind is that I do n’t see these objections fairly grappled with . There is either denunciation or weak argument ; but I can better recollect the impression on my own mind than what made it . ”
192676	192695	192612	192612	she	4416	“ Yes , I know that feeling ; but are you sure you have seen all the arguments ? ”
192696	192722	192612	192612	she	4416	“ I can not tell — perhaps not . Whenever I get a book with anything in it , somebody says it is not sound . ”
192723	192738	192739	192739	he	241	“ And you therefore conclude that a sound book can have nothing in it ? ”
192744	192776	192612	192612	she	4416	“ Well , most of the new ‘ sound ’ books that I have met are just what my mother and sister like — either dull , or sentimental and trashy . ”
192777	192826	192612	192612	she	4416	“ Perhaps those that get into popular circulation do deserve some of your terms for them . Illogical replies break down and carry off some who have pinned their faith to them ; but are you sure that though you have read much , you have read deep ? ”
192827	192889	192612	192612	she	4416	“ I have read more deeply than any one I know — women , I mean — or than any man ever showed me he had read . Indeed , I am trying not to say it in conceit , but Ermine Williams does not read argumentative books , and gentlemen almost always make as if they knew nothing about them . ”
192890	192979	192612	192612	she	4416	“ I think you may be of great use to me , my dear , if you will help me . The bishop has desired me to preach the next visitation sermon , and he wishes it to be on some of these subjects . Now , if you will help me with the book work , it will be very kind in you , and might serve to clear your mind about some of the details , though you must be prepared for some questions being unanswered . ”
192980	192984	192986	192986	Rachel	128	“ Best so , ”
192988	192999	192986	192986	Rachel	128	“ I do n’t like small answers to great questions . ”
193000	193025	192612	192612	she	4416	“ Nor I. Only let us take care not to get absorbed in admiring the boldness that picks out stones to be stumbled over . ”
193026	193041	192612	192612	she	4416	“ Do you object to my having read , and thought , and tried ? ”
193042	193127	192612	192612	she	4416	“ Certainly not . Those who have the capability should , if they feel disturbed , work out the argument . Nothing is gained while it is felt that both sides have not been heard . I do not myself believe that a humble , patient , earnest spirit can go far wrong , though it may for a time be tried , and people often cry out at the first stumbling block , and then feel committed to the exclamations they have made . ”
193251	193367	193247	193248	Lord Keith	199	“ Oh , there ’s no getting at his feelings . He was very civil to me — asked after you , Rachel — told me to give you his thanks , but not a single word about anything nearer . Then I had to read the paper to him — all that dinner at Liverpool , and he made remarks , and expected me to know what it was about . I suppose he does feel ; the Colonel says he is exceedingly cut up , and he looks like a man of eighty , infinitely worse than last time I saw him , but I do n’t know what to make of him . ”
193368	193379	193244	193244	Rachel	128	“ And , Alick , did you hear the verdict ? ”
193380	193384	193247	193248	Lord Keith	199	“ What verdict ? ”
193385	193400	193244	193244	Rachel	128	“ That man at Avoncester . Mrs. Menteith said there had been a telegram . ”
193405	193415	193416	193416	he	125	“ This has put everything out of my head ! ”
193419	193425	193416	193416	he	125	“ What was the verdict ? ”
193426	193445	193247	193248	Lord Keith	199	“ That was just what she could not tell . She did not quite know who was tried . ”
193446	193457	193458	193458	he	125	“ And she came here and harassed you with it , ”
193466	193477	193458	193458	he	125	“ As if you had not gone through enouqh already . ”
193478	193506	193507	193507	she	4420	“ Never mind that now . It seems so long ago now that I can hardly think much about it , and I have had another visitor , ”
193518	193532	193507	193507	she	4420	“ Mrs. Carleton — that poor son of hers is in such distress . ”
193533	193541	193542	193542	he	125	“ She has been palavering you over , ”
193559	193579	193542	193542	he	125	“ Indeed , Alick , if you would listen , you would find him very much to be pitied . ”
193580	193593	193594	193594	He	125	“ I only wish never to hear of any of them again . ”
193606	193619	193620	193620	she	128	“ I thought you would not object to my letting her in , ”
193623	193630	193631	193631	he	125	“ I never said I did , ”
193634	193661	193631	193631	he	125	“ I can never think of him but as having caused her death , and it was no thanks to him that there was nothing worse . ”
193688	193699	193683	193683	her	128	“ There may have been more excuse than you believe . ”
193700	193711	193712	193712	He	125	“ Do you suppose that is any satisfaction to me ? ”

All are gone to Avoncester now , though with some doubts whether this be indeed the critical day ; I hope it may be , the sooner this is over the better , but I am full of hope . I can not believe but that the Providence that has done so much to discover Edward ’s innocence to the world , will finish the work ! I have little expectation though of your coming down in time to see it , the copy of the telegraphic message , which you sent by Harry , looks as bad as possible , and even allowing something for inexperience and fright , things must be in a state in which you could hardly leave your brother , so unwell as he seems . “
194630	195199	195200	195200	They	4444	“ And I have written so far without a word on the great subject of all , the joy untold for which our hearts had ached so long , and which we owe entirely to you , for Edward owns that nothing but your personal representations would have brought him , and , as I suppose you already know — he so much hated the whole subject of Maddox ’s treachery that he had flung aside , unread , all that he saw related to it . Dear Colin , whatever else you have done , you have filled a famished heart . Could you but have seen Ailie ’s face all last evening as she sat by his side , you would have felt your reward — it was as if the worn , anxious , almost stern mask had been taken away , and our Ailie ’s face was beaming out as of old when she was the family pet , before Julia took her away to be finished . She sees no change ; she is in an ecstasy of glamour that makes her constantly repeat her rejoicings that Edward is so much himself , so unchanged , till I almost feel unsisterly for seeing in him the traces that these sad years have left , and that poor little Rose herself has detected . No , he is not so much changed as exaggerated . The living to himself , and with so cruel a past , has greatly increased the old dreaminess that we always tried to combat , and he seems less able than before to turn his mind into any channel but the one immediately before him . He is most loving when roused , but infinitely more inclined to fall off into a muse . I am afraid you must have had a troublesome charge in him , judging by the uproar Harry makes about the difficulty of getting him safe from Paddington . It is good to see him and Harry together — the old schoolboy ways are so renewed , all bitterness so entirely forgotten , only Harry rages a little that he is not more wrapped up in Rose . To say the truth , so do I ; but if it were not for Harry ’s feeling the same , I should believe that you had taught me to be exacting about my rosebud . Partly , it is that he is disappointed that she is not like her mother ; he had made up his mind to another Lucy , and her Williams face took him by surprise , and , partly , he is not a man to adapt himself to a child . She must be trained to help unobtrusively in his occupations ; the unknowing little plaything her mother was , she never can be . I am afraid he will never adapt himself to English life again — his soul seems to be in his mines , and if as you say he is happy and valued there — though it is folly to look forward to the wrench again , instead of rejoicing in the present , gladness ; but often as I had fashioned that arrival in my fancy , it was never that Harry ’s voice , not yours , should say the ‘ Here he is . ’ “

We were all dreadfully shocked to hear about poor dear Bessie ; it is so sad her having no mother nor any one but Rachel to take care of her , though Rachel would do her best , I know . If she would like to have me , or if you think I could do any good , pray telegraph for me the instant you get this letter . I would have come this morning , only I thought , perhaps , she had her aunt . That stupid telegram never said whether her baby was alive , or what it was , I do hope it is all right . I should like to send nurse up at once — I always thought she saved little Cyril when he was so ill . Pray send for nurse or me , or anything I can send : anyway , I know nobody can be such a comfort as you ; but the only thing there is to wish about you is , that you could be in two places at once . “

196450	196602	196432	196433	Mr. Grey	362	“ The counsel for the prosecution told the whole story , and it was very touching . I had never known the whole before ; the sisters are so resolute and uncomplaining : but how they must have suffered when every one thought them ruined by their brother ’s fraud ! I grieve to think how we neglected them , and only noticed them when it suited our convenience . Then he called Mr. Beechum , and you will understand better than I can all about the concern in which they were embarked , and Maddox coming to him for an advance of £ 300 , giving him a note from Mr. Williams , asking for it to carry out an invention . The order for the sum was put into Maddox ’s hands , and the banker proved the paying it to him by an order on a German bank . “
197010	197108	197109	197110	Other people	5446	“ The rest of the examination must have been very distressing , for Maddox ’s counsel pushed him hard about his reasons for not returning to defend himself , and he was obliged to tell how ill his wife was , and how terrified ; and they endeavoured to make that into an admission that he thought himself liable . They tried him with bits of the handwriting , and he could not always tell which were his own;—but I think every one must have been struck with his honourable scrupulosity in explaining every doubt he had . “
197262	197464	197255	197255	they	5309	“ That poor woman whom we used to call Mrs. Rawlins told her sad story next . She is much worn and subdued , and Mr. Grey was struck with the change from the fierce excitement she showed when she was first confronted with Maddox , after her own trial ; but she held fast to the same evidence , giving it not resentfully , but sadly and firmly , as if she felt it to be her duty . She , as you know , explained how Maddox had obtained access to Mr. Williams ’s private papers , and how she had , afterwards , found in his possession the seal ring , and the scraps of paper in his patron ’s writing . A policeman produced them , and the seal perfectly filled the wax upon the forged letter . The bits of paper showed that Maddox had been practising imitating Mr. Williams ’s writing . It all seemed most distinct , but still there was some sharp cross - examination of her on her own part in the matter , and Mr. Grey said it was well that little Rose could so exactly confirm the facts she mentioned . “
197945	198036	198037	198037	We	4519	“ Well , I can not tell you all , but the judge summed up strongly for a conviction , though he said a good deal about culpable negligence almost inviting fraud , and I fear it must have been very distressing to the Williamses , but the end was that Maddox was found guilty , and sentenced to fourteen years ’ penal servitude , though I am afraid they will not follow Conrade ’s suggestion , and chain up a lion by his bed every night of his life . “

It would have been a pity not to have slept to wake to the knowledge that all was not a dream , but then came the contrast with the sorrow you are watching . And I have just had your letter . What a sudden close to that joyous life ! She was one of the most winning beings , as you truly say , that ever flashed across one ’s course , and if she had faults , they were those of her day and her training . I suppose , by what you say , that she was too girlish to be all the companion your brother required , and that this may account for his being more shocked than sorrow - stricken , and his child , since he can dwell on the thought , is such a new beginning of hope , that I wonder less than you do at his bearing up so well . Besides , pain dulls the feelings , and is a great occupation . I wish you could have seen that dear Bessie , but I gather that the end came on much more rapidly than had been expected . It seemed as if she were one of those to whom even suffering was strangely lightened and shortened , as if she had met only the flowers of life , and even the thorns and stings were almost lost in their bright blossoms . And she could hardly have lived on without much either of temptation or sorrow . I am glad of your testimony to Rachel ’s effectiveness , I wrote it out and sent it up to the Homestead . There was a note this morning requesting Edward to come in to see Maddox , and Ailie is gone with him , thinking she may get leave to see poor Maria . Think of writing ‘ Edward and Ailie again ! Dr. Long and Harry are gone with them . The broken thread is better pieced by Harry than by the Doctor ; but he wants Ailie and me to go and stay at Belfast . Now I must hear Rose read , in order to bring both her and myself to our reasonable senses . ”

203621	203634	203636	203637	Colonel Keith	207	“ I could not think , but I see it was so , ”
203641	203680	203636	203637	Colonel Keith	207	“ As I am obliged to understand these things , she must have greatly exceeded her means , and have used much cleverness and ingenuity in keeping the tradesmen quiet , and preventing all from coming to light . ”
203681	203695	203606	203606	Rachel	128	“ How miserable ! I ca n’t fancy living in such a predicament . ”
203696	203702	203704	203705	the Colonel	1244	“ I am much afraid , ”
203712	203732	203704	203705	the Colonel	1244	“ that it explains the marriage — and then Keith did not allow her as much as she expected . ”
203733	203742	203744	203744	Rachel	128	“ Oh , Colonel Keith , do n’t ! ”
203746	203774	203744	203744	Rachel	128	“ it is just the one thing where I could not bear to believe Alick . She was so dear and beautiful , and spoke so rightly . ”
203775	203780	203782	203783	the Colonel	1244	“ To believe Alick ! ”
203792	203814	203816	203816	Rachel	128	“ I thought — I ought not to have thought — he was hard upon her — but he knew better , ”
203818	203831	203816	203816	Rachel	128	“ of course he did not know of all this dreadful business ! ”
203832	203836	203838	203839	the Colonel	1244	“ Assuredly not , ”
203841	203879	203838	203839	the Colonel	1244	“ that is self - evident , but as you say , I am afraid he did know his poor sister ’s character better than we did , when he came to warn me against the marriage . ”
203880	203893	203816	203816	Rachel	128	“ Did he ? Oh how much it must have cost him . ”
203894	203995	203816	203816	Rachel	128	“ I am afraid I did not make it cost him less . I thought he judged her harshly , and that his illness had made him magnify trifles , but though our interference would have been perfectly useless , he was quite right in his warning . Now that , poor thing , she is no longer here to enchant us with her witcheries , I see that my brother greatly suffered from being kept away from home , and detained in this place , and that she left him far more alone than she ought to have done . ”
203996	204018	203838	203839	the Colonel	1244	“ Yes , Alick thought so , but she had such good reasons , I am sure she believed them herself . ”
204019	204038	204040	204041	the Colonel	1244	“ If she had not believed them , she could not have had such perfect sincerity of manner , ”
204043	204067	204040	204041	the Colonel	1244	“ she must have persuaded at least one half of herself that she was acting for every one ’s good except her own . ”
204068	204094	203838	203839	the Colonel	1244	“ And Mr. Clare , whom Alick always thought she neglected , never felt it . Alick says he was too unselfish to claim attention . ”
204095	204204	203838	203839	the Colonel	1244	“ I never doubted her for one moment till I came home , on that unhappy day , and found how ill Keith was . I did think then , that considering how much she had seen of Alick while the splinters were working out , she ought to have known better than to talk of sciatica ; but she made me quite believe in her extreme anxiety , and that she was only going out because it was necessary for her to take care of you on your first appearance . How bright she looked , and how little I thought I should never see her again ! ”
204205	204224	204226	204226	Rachel	128	“ Oh , she meant what she said ! She always was kind to me ! Most kind ! ”
204228	204305	204226	204226	Rachel	128	“ so considerate about all the dreadful spring — not one word did she say to vex me about the past ! I am sure she did go out on that day as much to shelter me as for anything else . I ca n’t bear to think all this — here in this pretty room that she had such pleasure in ; where she made me so welcome , after all my disagreeableness and foolishness . ”
204313	204327	204306	204307	The Colonel	1244	“ Better such foolishness than such wisdom , such repulsion than such attraction . ”
204363	204374	204375	204375	he	1244	“ It is a very sad moment to be undeceived , ”
204378	204396	204375	204375	he	1244	“ one would rather have one ’s faults come to light in one ’s life than afterwards . ”
204466	204483	204458	204458	her	128	“ So long as thou doest well unto thyself , men will speak good of thee . ”
204524	204555	204556	204556	she	128	“ Oh ! at least it is a comfort that Alick was really the kindest and rightest ! Only too right ! but you can settle all this without him , ”
204560	204575	204556	204556	she	128	“ need he know of this ? I ca n’t bear that he should . ”
204576	204580	204582	204583	Colonel Keith	207	“ Nor I , ”
204585	204599	204582	204583	Colonel Keith	207	“ it was the reason that I am glad you are here alone . ”
204600	204612	204614	204614	Rachel	128	“ Oh , thank you ! No one need ever know , ”
204616	204640	204556	204556	she	128	“ I fear my brother must see the accounts , as they have to be paid , but that need not be immediately . ”
204641	204650	204652	204652	Rachel	128	“ Is there anything else that is dreadful ? ”
204669	204686	204652	204652	Rachel	128	“ I do n’t like to take them home now , if they will grieve Alick . ”
204687	204697	204699	204700	the Colonel	1244	“ You need not be afraid of that packet , ”
204702	204718	204699	204700	the Colonel	1244	“ I see his father ’s handwriting . They look like his letters from India . ”
204732	204735	204736	204736	she	128	“ Oh ! ”
204739	204768	204736	204736	she	128	“ this is enough to make up for all . This is his letter to tell about Alick ’s wound . Oh how beautifully he speaks of him , ”
204810	204822	204824	204825	the father	1864	“ You must be prepared to hear that all is over , ”
204830	204977	204824	204825	the father	1864	“ in fact , I doubt whether he can live till morning , though M’Vicar declares that nothing vital has been touched . Be it as it may , the boy has been in all respects , even more than I dared to wish , and the comfort he has been ever since he came out to me has been unspeakable . We must not grudge him such a soldier ’s death after his joyous life . But for you , my poor girl , I could only wish the same for myself to - morrow . You will , at least , if you lose a brother ’s care , have a memory of him , to which to live up . The thought of such a dead brother will be more to you than many a living one can ever be to a sister . ”
205210	205214	205205	205205	he	1244	“ little charge , ”
205352	205365	205335	205335	she	128	“ You know I ca n’t go with you to - day . ”
205366	205404	205335	205335	she	128	“ Of course , but I must make him fit to be seen . You know he has been wearing little Una ’s things all this time , and that will not do out of the nursery . ”
205405	205425	205335	205335	she	128	“ A superior woman ought to know that his Lordship will never find out what his son has on . ”
205426	205454	205335	205335	she	128	“ Then it is all the more reason that I should not let the poor dear little fellow go about wrapped up in somebody ’s old shawl ! ”
205455	205466	205335	205335	she	128	“ What will you do then — take your maid ? ”
205467	205478	205335	205335	she	128	“ Certainly not . I ca n’t have him left . ”
205479	205486	205335	205335	she	128	“ Then take him with you ? ”
205487	205517	205335	205335	she	128	“ What , Alick , a little unvaccinated baby ! Where have you ever lived ! I do n’t see the least reason why I should not go alone . ”
205518	205543	205335	205335	she	128	“ You need not begin beating about the world yet , Rachel . How many times did you say you had been in London ? ”
205544	205583	205335	205335	she	128	“ Three ; once with my father when I was a child , once in the time of the Great Exhibition , and passing through it now with you . But any one of common sense can manage . ”
205584	205598	205600	205600	Alick	125	“ If you will wait till five o’clock I will come with you , ”
205604	205633	205600	205600	Alick	125	“ No , indeed , I had rather not go , than that you should , you are quite tired out enough at the end of the day . ”
205634	205640	205335	205335	she	128	“ Then do not go . ”
205641	205657	205659	205659	Rachel	128	“ Alick , why will you have no proper feeling for that poor dear child ! ”
205675	205686	205687	205687	he	125	“ My proper feeling takes the direction of my wife , ”
205690	205702	205703	205703	she	128	“ You do n’t really mean to forbid me to go , ”
205706	205728	205703	205703	she	128	“ I do n’t mean it , for I do so , unless you find some one to go with you . ”
205789	205796	205776	205776	She	128	“ May I take the housekeeper ? ”
205797	205802	205805	205805	he	125	“ Yes , certainly , ”
205827	205839	205822	205822	she	128	“ Have I been self - willed and overbearing , Alick ? ”
205843	205872	205873	205873	he	125	“ Not at all ; you have persevered just where you ought . I dare say this is all more essential than shows on the surface . And , ”
205881	205906	205873	205873	he	125	“ if you were not myself , Rachel , you know how I should thank you for caring for my poor Bessie ’s child . ”
205951	205958	205949	205949	she	6239	“ busied in her housewife skep , ”
205991	206000	205987	205988	Mr. Clare	241	“ Pray are you above accepting my services ? ”
206001	206013	205987	205988	Mr. Clare	241	“ You ! Oh , uncle ; thank you , but — ”
206014	206040	205987	205988	Mr. Clare	241	“ What were your orders ? Anybody with you , was it not ? I flatter myself that I have some body , at least . ”
206041	206051	205987	205988	Mr. Clare	241	“ If Alick will not think I ought not ! ”
206052	206067	205987	205988	Mr. Clare	241	“ The boy will not presume to object to what I do with you . ”
206068	206076	206078	206079	candid Rachel	128	“ I do wish it very much , ”
206081	206137	206078	206079	candid Rachel	128	“ Of course you do , my dear . Alick is not cured of a young man ’s notion that babies are a sort of puppies . He is quite right not to let you run about London by yourself , but he will be quite satisfied if you find eyes and I find discretion . ”
206138	206148	205987	205988	Mr. Clare	241	“ But is it not very troublesome to you ? ”
206149	206156	206158	206159	Mr. Clare	241	“ It is a capital lark ! ”
206365	206381	206382	206382	she	128	“ If I had been sensible , I might have come to something like this ! ”
206385	206396	206382	206382	she	128	“ Do you wish to undo these last three months ? ”
206397	206436	206450	206451	Mr. Clare	241	“ No ; I am not fit to be anything but an ordinary married woman , with an Alick to take care of me ; but I am glad some people can be what I meant to be . ”
206437	206448	206450	206451	Mr. Clare	241	“ And you need not regret not being useful now , ”
206453	206463	206450	206451	Mr. Clare	241	“ Where should any of us be without you ? ”

206869	206909	207057	207057	he	199	“ Then while you are so kind as to watch over him , I much prefer that things should remain in their present state , than to bring him to a house like this . You do not object ? ”
206910	206943	207057	207057	he	199	“ Oh , no ; I am so glad . I was only dreading the losing him . I thought Mrs. Menteith wished for him when he is old enough to travel . ”
206944	206947	206949	206950	Lord Keith	199	“ Colin ! ”
206956	206987	206949	206950	Lord Keith	199	“ will nothing make the Menteiths understand that I would rather put out the child to nurse in a Highland hut than in that Babel of a nursery of theirs ? ”

207005	207013	207015	207016	Lord Keith	199	“ But remember , both of you , ”
207018	207056	207057	207057	he	199	“ that happen what may , this poor child is not to be in her charge . I ’ve seen enough of her children left alone in perambulators in the sun . You will be in Edinburgh ? ”
207064	207073	207057	207057	he	199	“ Yes , when Alick ’s leave ends . ”
207074	207118	207119	207119	Rachel	128	“ I shall return thither when this matter is over , I know I shall be better at home in Scotland , and if I winter in Edinburgh , may be we could make some arrangement for his being still under your eye . ”

207533	207607	207608	207608	Yours	462	“ Yes , Ermine Williams , forgive all that is past , and feel for an old , it may be , a dying man , and for a motherless infant . There is much to forget , but I trust to your overcoming any scruples , and giving me all the comfort in your power , in thinking of the poor child who has come into the world under such melancholy circumstances . “
207612	207616	207608	207608	Yours	462	“ Keith of Gowanbrae ”
207617	208036	208037	208037	Yours	4756	“ Poor Keith , he has given me his letter open , his real anxiety has been too much at last for his dignity ; and now , my Ermine , what do you say to his entreaty ? The state of the case is this . How soon this abscess may be ready for the operation is still uncertain , the surgeons think it will be in about three weeks , and in this interval he wishes to complete all his arrangements . In plain English , his strongest desire is to secure the poor little boy from falling into Menteith ’s hands . Now , mine is a precarious life , and Alick and Rachel may of course be at the ends of the earth , so the point is that you shall be ‘ one of the family , ’ before the will is signed . Alick ’s leave has been extended to the 1st of October , no more is possible , and he undertakes to nurse poor Keith for a fortnight from to - morrow , if you will consent to fulfil this same request within that time . After the 1st , I should have to leave you , but as soon as Keith is well enough to bear the journey , he wishes to return to Edinburgh , where he would be kindly attended to by Alick and Rachel all the winter . There , Ermine , your victory is come , your consent has been entreated at last by my brother , not for my sake , but as a personal favour to himself , because there is no woman in the world of whom he thinks so highly . For myself I say little . I grieve that you should be thus hurried and fluttered , and if Ailie thinks it would harm you , she must telegraph back to me not to come down , and I will try to teach myself patience by preaching it to Keith , but otherwise you will see me by four o’clock to - morrow . Every time I hear Rachel ’s name , I think it ought to have been yours , and surely in this fourteenth year , lesser objections may give way . But persuasions are out of the question , you must be entirely led by your own feeling . If I could have seen you in July , this should not have come so suddenly at last . “
208048	208053	208045	208045	you	4756	“ Colin A Keith . “
208067	208109	208110	208110	Edward	182	” Colonel Keith followed his letter at four o’clock , and entering his own study , found it in a cloud of smoke , in the midst of which he dimly discerned a long beard and thin visage absorbed in calculation . “

208401	208483	208394	208394	We	4758	” Nevertheless Rose duteously loosed the hand to which she had been clinging till they came to the door ; and as Colin Keith opened it , again he was met by the welcoming glances of the bright eyes . This time he did not pause till he was close to her , and kneeling on one knee beside her , he put his arm round her , and held her hands in his . The first words that passed were , “

209925	210019	210020	210020	You	4796	” said Ermine , quickly . Meanwhile Alison , sore and sick at heart , wandered on the esplanade , foreboding that the blow was coming that she ought to rejoice at , if her love could only be more unselfish . At last the Colonel joined her , and , as usual , his tone of consideration cheered and supported her when in actual conference with him , and as he explained his plans , he added that he hoped there would be scarcely any interruption to her intercourse with her sister . “
210023	210028	210020	210020	You	4796	” she said abruptly , “
210036	210037	210020	210020	You	4796	” “
210057	210063	210064	210064	your	4796	” And as she hesitated , “

210604	211259	210567	210567	Mauleverer	282	” Alison ’s scruples were thus disposed of , and when Edward ’s brain cleared itself from platinum , he showed himself satisfied with the decision , though he insisted on henceforth sending home a sum sufficient for his daughter ’s expenses , and once said something that could be construed into a hope of spending a quiet old age with her and his sister ; but at present he was manifestly out of his element , and was bent on returning to Ekaterinburg immediately after the marriage . His presence was but a qualified pleasure . Naturally shy and absent , his broken spirits and removal from domestic life , and from society , had exaggerated his peculiarities ; and under the pressure of misfortune , caused in a great measure by his own negligence , he had completely given way , without a particle of his sister ’s patience or buoyancy , and had merely striven to drown his troubles in engrossing problems of his favourite pursuit , till the habit of abstraction had become too confirmed to be shaken off . When the blot on his name was removed , he was indeed sensible that he was no longer an exile , but he could not resume his old standing , friendships rudely severed could not be re - united ; his absorption had grown by indulgence ; old interests had passed away ; needful conformity to social habits was irksome , and even his foreign manner and appearance testified to his entire unfitness for English life . Tibbie was in constant dread of his burning the house down , so incalculable and preposterous were his hours , and the Colonel , longing to render the house a perfect shrine for his bride , found it hard to tolerate the fumes with which her brother saturated it . If he had been sure that opium formed no portion of Edward ’s solace , his counsel to Alison would have been less decisive . To poor little Rose , her father was an abiding perplexity and distress ; she wanted to love him , and felt it absolute naughtiness to be constantly disappointed by his insensibility to her approaches , or else repelled and disgusted by that vice of the Russian sheep . And a vague hint of being transported to the Ural mountains , away from Aunt Ermine , had haunted her of late more dreadfully than even the lions of old ; so that the relief was ineffable when her dear Colonel confided to her that she was to be his niece and Aunt Ermine ’s handmaid , sent her to consult with Tibbie on her new apartment , and invited Augustus to the most eligible hole in the garden . The grotto that Rose , Conrade , and Francis proceeded to erect with pebbles and shells , was likely to prove as alarming to that respectable reptile as a model cottage to an Irish peasant . Ermine had dropped all scruples about Rose ’s intercourse with other children , and the feeling that she might associate with them on equal terms , perhaps , was the most complete assurance of Edward ’s restoration . She was glad that companionship should render the little maiden more active and childlike , for Edward ’s abstraction had made her believe that there might be danger in indulging the dreaminess of the imaginative child . No one welcomed the removal of these restraints more warmly than Lady Temple . She was perhaps the happiest of the happy , for with her there was no drawback , no sorrow , no parting to fear . Her first impulse , when Colonel Keith came to tell her his plans , was to seize on hat and shawl , and rush down to Mackarel Lane to kiss Ermine with all her heart , and tell her that “
211287	211338	211283	211285	that dear Colonel	4816	” and then she clung to Alison , declaring that now she should have her all to herself , and if she would only come to Myrtlewood , she would do her very best to make her comfortable there , and it should be her home — her home always . “
211342	211351	211283	211285	that dear Colonel	4816	” said Ermine , afterwards to the Colonel , “
211393	211536	211388	211389	the lady	7187	” The courtship had been the more ardent from Fanny ’s alarm lest the brother should deprive her of Alison ; and when she found her fears groundless , she thanked him with such fervour , and talked so eagerly of his sister ’s excellences that she roused him into a lucid interval , in which he told Colonel Keith that Lady Temple might give him an idea of the style of woman that Lucy had been . Indeed , Colin began to think that it was as well that he was so well wrapped up in smoke and chemistry , otherwise another might have been added to the list of Lady Temple ’s hopeless adorers . The person least satisfied was Tibbie , who could not get over the speediness of the marriage , nor forgive the injury to Miss Williams , “
211597	211908	211909	211910	The lad	4822	” Crusty as she was , there was no danger of her not giving her warmest welcome , and thus the morning came . Tibbie had donned her cap , with white satin ribbons , and made of lace once belonging to the only heiress who had ever brought wealth to the Keiths . Edward Williams , all his goods packed up , had gone to join his sisters , and the Colonel , only perceptibly differing from his daily aspect in having a hat free from crape , was opening all the windows in hopes that a thorough draft would remove the last of the tobacco , when the letters were brought in , and among them one of the black bordered bulletins from Littleworthy , which ordinarily arrived by the second post . It was a hurried note , evidently dashed off to catch the morning mail . My Dear Colonel,—Alick tells me to write in haste to catch the morning post , and beg you to telegraph the instant your wedding is over . The doctors see cause to hasten their measures , but your brother will have nothing done till the will is signed . He and Alick both desire you will not come , but it is getting to be far too much for Alick . I would tell you more if there were time before the post goes . Love to dear Ermine . Very sincerely yours , R. KEITH . There was so shocked and startled a look on Colin ’s face , that Tibbie believed that his brother must be dead , and when in a few almost inaudible words he told her that he must start for Bishopsworthy by the afternoon train , she fairly began to scold , partly by way of working off the irritation left by her alarm . “
211963	211964	211968	211968	she	4826	” “
211973	211978	211968	211968	she	4826	” said the Colonel , “
211989	211990	211991	211992	Hout awa	469	” “
212047	212048	212049	212049	My	0	” “
212067	212087	212058	212058	You	304	” said Colin , a little restored by his amusement at her anxiety for his honour among the English . “
212134	212183	212187	212187	his	0	” Tibbie looked after him , and shook her head , understanding from her ain laddie ’s pallid check , and resolute lip , nay , in the very sound of his footfall , how sore was his trial , and with one - sided compassion she muttered , “
212207	212705	212193	212194	His Lordship’ll	6965	” As it was in every way desirable that the wedding should be unexpected by Avonmonth in general , it was to take place at the close of the ordinary morning service , and Ermine in her usual seat within the vestry , was screened from knowing how late was Colin ’s entrance , or seeing the determined composure that would to her eyes have betrayed how much shaken he was . He was completely himself again by the time the congregation dispersed , leaving only Grace Curtis , Lady Temple , and the little best man , Conrade , a goodly sight in his grey suit and scarlet hose . Then came the slow movement from the vestry , the only really bridal - looking figure being Rose in white muslin and white ribbons ; walking timidly and somewhat in awe beside her younger aunt ; while her father upheld and guided the elder . Both were in quiet , soft , dark dresses , and straw bonnets , but over hers Ermine wore the small though exquisite Brussels lace veil that had first appeared at her mother ’s wedding ; and thankful joy and peaceful awe looked so lovely on her noble brow , deep , soft dark eyes , and the more finely moulded , because somewhat worn , features ; and so beauteously deepened was the carnation on her cheek , that Mr. Mitchell ever after maintained that he had never married any one to compare with that thirty - three years ’ old bride upon crutches , and , as he reported to his wife , in no dress at all . Her brother , who supported her all the time she stood , was infinitely more nervous than she was . Her native grace and dignity , and absence of all false shame entirely covered her helplessness , and in her earnestness , she had no room for confusion ; her only quivering of voice was caught for one moment from the tremulous intensity of feeling that Colin Keith could not wholly keep from thrilling in his tones , as he at last proclaimed his right to love and to cherish her for whom he had so long persevered . Unobserved , he filled up the half - written despatch with the same pen with which he signed the register , and sent Conrade to the door with it to his already mounted messenger . Then assuming Edward ’s place as Ermine ’s supporter , he led her to the door , seated her in her wheeled chair , and silently handing Rachel ’s note as his explanation to Alison , he turned away , and walked alone by Ermine ’s side to his own house . Still silent , he took her into the bright drawing - room he had so long planned for her , and seated her in her own peculiar chair . Then his first words were , “
212711	212717	212718	212718	Colin	236	” She knew his face . “
212725	212736	212718	212718	Colin	236	” He bent his head , he could not speak . “
212749	212750	212751	212751	Ermine	170	” “
212765	212766	212757	212757	You	170	” “
212783	212795	212778	212778	me	0	” He told the substance of the note , ending with , “
212803	212804	212805	212805	I	0	” “
212862	212987	212830	212830	Colin	236	” She was the stronger . Tears , as much of loving thankfulness as of overflowing disappointment , rushed into his eyes at such a fulfilment of the purpose that he had carried with him by sea and land , in battle and sickness , through all the years of his manhood . And withal her one thought was to infuse in its strongest measure the drop of happiness that was to sustain him through the scenes that awaited him , to make him feel her indeed his wife , and to brighten him with the sunbeam face that she knew had power to cheer him . Rallying her playfulness , she took off her bonnet , and said as she settled her hair , “
213070	213165	213171	213171	you	304	” Her smile awoke a responsive look , and she began to gaze round and admire , feeling it safest to skim on the surface ; and he could not but be gratified by her appreciation of the pains spent upon this , her especial home . He had recovered himself again by the time these few sentences had passed ; they discussed the few needful arrangements required by his departure , and Tibbie presently found them so cheerful that she was quite scandalized , and when Ermine held out her hands , saying , “
213182	213186	213171	213171	you	304	” she exclaimed — “
213238	213239	213240	213240	I	0	” “
213254	213259	213260	213260	Weel	473	” said the Colonel . “
213302	213303	213272	213272	She	4843	” “
213308	213331	213306	213306	Tibbie	304	” exclaimed Ermine , greatly amused at the unexpected turn , purely for the sake of putting Maister Colin in the wrong . “
213400	213410	213379	213379	I	0	” she added , with a look of intelligence . “
213418	213426	213379	213379	I	0	” responded Tibbie , with profound satisfaction . “
213441	213550	213379	213379	I	0	” Colin could not help laughing , and when once this had been effected , Ermine felt that his depression had been sufficiently met , and that she might venture on deeper , and more serious sympathy , befitting the chastened , thankful feelings with which they hailed the crowning of their youthful love , the fulfilment of the hopes and prayers that the one had persisted in through doubt and change , the other had striven to resign into the All - wise Hands . They had an early meal together , chiefly for the sake of his wheeling her to the head of his table , and “
213557	213582	213379	213379	I	0	” and then the inexorable hour was come , and he left her , with the echo of her last words in his ear , “
213630	213691	213615	213616	a sister	498	” and his last look at the door was answered with her sunshiny smile . But when , a few minutes after , Edward came up with Alison for his farewell , they found her lying back in her chair , half fainting , and her startled look told almost too plainly that she had not thought of her brother . “
213695	213712	213615	213616	a sister	498	” said Edward , affectionately , as much to console Alison as Ermine for this oblivion ; “
213843	213877	213832	213832	She	7128	” Ermine ’s powers were absolutely exhausted ; she could only answer him by embraces and tears ; and all the rest of the day she was , to use her own expression , “
213887	214226	213832	213832	She	7128	” Nor , though she exerted herself that she might with truth write that she was well and happy , was she good for much more on the next , and her jealous guardians allowed her to see no one but soft , fondling Lady Temple , who insisted on a relationship ( through Rachel ) , and whose tender pensive quietness could not fail to be refreshment to the strained spirits , and wearied physical powers , and who better than anybody could talk of the Colonel , nay , who could understand , and even help Ermine herself to understand , that these ever - welling tears came from a source by no means akin to grief or repining . The whole aspect of the rooms was full of tokens of his love and thought for her . The ground - floor had been altered for her accommodation , the furniture chosen in accordance with her known tastes or with old memories , all undemonstratively prepared while yet she had not decided on her consent . And what touched her above all , was the collection of treasures that he had year by year gathered together for her throughout the weary waiting , purchases at which Lady Temple remembered her mother ’s banter , with his quiet evasions of explanation . No wonder Ermine laid her head on her hand , and could not retain her tears , as she recalled the white , dismayed face of the youth , who had printed that one sad earliest kiss on her brow , as she lay fire - scathed and apparently dying ; and who had cherished the dream unbroken and unwaveringly , had denied himself consistently , had garnered up those choice tokens when ignorant over whether she still lived ; had relied on her trust , and come back , heart - whole , to claim and win her , undaunted by her crippled state , her poverty , and her brother ’s blotted name . “
214250	214266	214267	214267	I	0	” she thought , and wept again ; because , as she murmured to Fanny , “
214313	214314	214307	214307	I	0	” “
214327	214616	214316	214316	I	0	” said Fanny ; a better companion to - day than the grave , strong Alison , who would have been kind , but would have had to suppress some marvel at the break - down , and some resentment that Edward had no greater share in it . The morning ’s post brought her the first letter from her husband , and in the midst of all her anxiety as to the contents , she could not but linger a moment on the aspect of the Honourable Mrs. Colin Keith in his handwriting ; there was a carefulness in the penmanship that assured her that , let him have to tell her what he would , the very inditing of that address had been enjoyment to him . That the border was black told nothing , but the intelligence was such as she had been fully prepared for . Colin had arrived to find the surgeon ’s work over , but the patient fast sinking . Even his recognition of his brother had been uncertain , and within twenty - four hours of the morning that had given Colin a home of his own , the last remnant of the home circle of his childhood had passed from him . Still Ermine had to continue a widowed bride for full a fortnight , whilst the funeral and subsequent arrangements necessitated Colin ’s presence in Scotland . It was on a crisp , beautiful October evening that Rose , her chestnut hair flying about her brow , stood , lighted up by the sunbeams in the porch , with upraised face and outstretched hands , and as the Colonel bent down to receive her joyous embrace , said , “
214649	214772	214643	214643	I	0	” The open door showed Ermine , too tremulous to trust to her crutch , but leaning forward , her eyes liquid with tears of thankfulness . The patient spirits had reached their home and haven , the earthly haven of loving hearts , the likeness of the heavenly haven , and as her head leant , at last , upon his shoulder , and his guardian arm encircled her , there was such a sense of rest and calm that even the utterance of their inward thanksgiving , or of a word of tenderness would have jarred upon them . It was not till a knock and message at the door interrupted them , that they could break the blessed stillness . “
214781	214799	214779	214779	Ermine	170	” said Colin , standing on the hearth - rug , and surveying her with satisfied eyes . “

216404	216681	216387	216390	the poor little Lord	4905	” Knowledge and Wisdom , TENNYSON . It was long before the two Mrs. Keiths met again . Mrs. Curtis and Grace were persuaded to spend the spring and summer in Scotland , and Alick ’s leave of absence was felt to be due to Mr. Clare , and thus it was that the first real family gathering took place on occasion of the opening of the institution that had grown out of the Burnaby Bargain . This work had cost Colonel Keith and Mr. Mitchell an infinity of labour and perseverance before even the preliminaries could be arranged , but they contrived at length to carry it out , and by the fourth spring after the downfall of the F. U. E. E. a house had been erected for the convalescents , whose wants were to be attended to by a matron , assisted by a dozen young girls in training for service . The male convalescents were under the discipline of Sergeant O’Brien and the whole was to be superintended by Colonel and Mrs. Keith . Ermine undertook to hear a class of the girls two or three times a week , and lower rooms had been constructed with a special view to her being wheeled into them , so as to visit the convalescents , and give them her attention and sympathy . Mary Morris was head girl , most of the others were from Avonmouth , but two pale Londoners came from Mr. Touchett ’s district , and a little motherless lassie from the — th Highlanders was brought down with the nursery establishment , on which Mrs. Alexander Keith now practised the “
216689	217002	216387	216390	the poor little Lord	4905	” May was unusually propitious , and after an orthodox tea - drinking , the new pupils and all the Sunday - schools were turned out to play on the Homestead slopes , with all the world to look on at them . It was a warm , brilliant day , of joyous blossom and lively green , and long laughing streaks of sunlight on the sea , and no one enjoyed it more than did Ermine , as she sat in her chair delighting in the fresh sweetness of the old thorns , laughing at the freaks of the scampering groups of children , gaily exchanging pleasant talk with one friend after another , and most of all with Rachel , who seemed to gravitate back to her whenever any summons had for a time interrupted their affluence of conversation . And all the time Ermine ’s footstool was serving as a table for the various flowers that two children were constantly gathering in the grass and presenting to her , to Rachel , or to each other , with a constant stream of not very comprehensible prattle , full of pretty gesticulation that seemed to make up for the want of distinctness . The yellow - haired , slenderly - made , delicately - featured boy , whose personal pronouns were just developing , and his consonants very scanty , though the elder of the two , dutifully and admiringly obeyed the more distinct , though less connected , utterances of the little dark - eyed girl , eked out by pretty imperious gestures , that seemed already to enchain the little white - frocked cavalier to her service . All the time it was droll to see how the two ladies could pay full attention to the children , while going on with their own unbroken stream of talk . “
217009	217031	217003	217003	I	0	” suddenly exclaimed Rachel , checking herself in mid - career about the mothers ’ meetings for the soldiers ’ wives . “
217041	217042	217037	217037	I	0	” “
217066	217077	217079	217079	Ermine	170	”—“I should not think he often had to do so , ”
217086	217099	217079	217079	Ermine	170	remedy—(“Mind , Keith , that is a nettle . It will sting — “
217101	217107	217037	217037	I	0	“ Less often than before , ”
217109	217384	217037	217037	I	0	Rachel—(“Never mind the butterfly , Una)—I do n’t think I have had more than one thorough fit of what he calls leaping into the gulf . It was about the soldiers ’ wives married without leave , who , poor things , are the most miserable creatures in the world ; and when I first found out about them I was in the sort of mood I was in about the lace , and raved about the system , and was resolved to employ one poor woman , and Alick looked meeker and meeker , and assented to all I said , as if he was half asleep , and at last he quietly took up a sheet of paper , and said he must write and sell out , since I was bent on my gulf , and an officer ’s wife must be bound by the regulations of the service . I was nearly as bad as ever , I could have written an article on the injustice of the army regulations , indeed I did begin , but what do you think the end was ? I got a letter from a good lady , who is always looking after the poor , to thank Mrs. Alexander Keith for the help that had been sent for this poor woman , to be given as if from the general fund . After that I could not help listening to him , and then I found it was so impossible to know about character , or to be sure that one was not doing more harm than — What is it , boys ? ”
217393	217418	217386	217389	three or four Temples	4910	“ Aunt Rachel , Mr. Clare is going to teach us a new game , and he says you know it . Pray come . ”
217419	217442	217445	217449	a child in each hand	4911	“ Come , Una . What , Keith , will you come too ? I ’ll take care of him , Ermine . ”
217473	217494	217466	217466	Rose	186	“ Aunt Ermine , you must come nearer ; it is so wonderful to see Mr. Clare teaching this game . ”
217495	217514	217549	217550	aunt Ermine	170	“ Do n’t push my chair , my dear ; it is much too heavy for you uphill . ”
217515	217531	217466	217466	Rose	186	“ As if I could not drive you anywhere , and here is Conrade coming . ”
217580	217591	217593	217593	Rose	186	“ I think she has left off her long words , ”
217595	217603	217605	217605	Conrade	126	“ She is not a civilian now , ”
217622	217649	217605	217605	Conrade	126	“ I did think it a most benighted thing to marry her , but that ’s what it is . Military discipline has made her conformable . ”
217912	217915	217937	217938	the Colonel	1244	“ music in’t ”
217948	217959	217937	217938	the Colonel	1244	“ Why , baby , you are soon come away ! ”
217960	217971	217973	217975	the little fellow	4867	“ I did not like it,—sit on mamma ’s knee , ”
217993	218000	218002	218003	the Colonel	1244	“ He was very soon frightened , ”
218005	218048	218002	218003	the Colonel	1244	“ it was only that little witch Una who could have deluded him into such a crowd , and , as soon as she saw a bigger boy to beguile , she instantly deserted Keith , so I relieved Rachel of him . ”
218049	218080	217937	217938	the Colonel	1244	“ See Rachel now ; Mr. Clare is interrogating her . How she is making them laugh ! I did not think she could ever have so entered into fun . ”
218081	218113	218002	218003	the Colonel	1244	“ Alick must have made it a part of her education . When the Invalid has time for another essay , Ermine , it should be on the Benefits of Ridicule . ”
218114	218131	218002	218003	the Colonel	1244	“ Against Clever Womanhood ? But then the subject must have Rachel ’s perfect good humour . ”
218132	218145	218147	218148	the Colonel	1244	“ And the weapon must be in the most delicately skilful hands , ”
218150	218172	218147	218148	the Colonel	1244	“ Properly wielded , it saves blunting the superior weapon by over - frequent use . Here the success is complete . ”
218173	218182	218184	218184	Ermine	170	“ It has been irony rather than ridicule , ”
218186	218239	218184	218184	Ermine	170	“ though , when he taught her to laugh , he won half the battle . It is beautiful to see her holding herself back , and most forbearing where she feels most positive . I am glad to see him looking so much stronger and more substantial . Where is he ? ”
218240	218280	218147	218148	the Colonel	1244	“ On the further bank , supposed by Mrs. Curtis to be asleep , but watching uncle , wife , and child through his eyelashes . Did you ever see any one so like his sister as that child ? ”
218281	218307	218184	218184	Ermine	170	“ Much more so than this one . I am glad he may one day see such a shadow of his bright - faced mother . ”
218308	218313	218315	218318	the the little orphan	4936	“ You are mother ! ”
218370	218384	218346	218346	she	170	“ Yes , always a mother to you , my precious little man . ”
218385	218398	218400	218401	the Colonel	207	“ Nor could you have had a bonnier face to look into , ”
218403	218431	218400	218401	the Colonel	207	“ There , the game breaks up . We should collect our flock , and get them them back to Les Invalides , as Alick calls it . ”
218432	218441	218443	218443	Ermine	170	“ Take care no one else does so , ”
218447	218516	218443	218443	Ermine	170	“ It has been a most happy day , and chief of all the pleasures has been the sight of Rachel just what I hoped , a thorough wife and mother , all the more so for her being awake to larger interests , and doing common things better for being the Clever Woman of the family . Where is she ? I do n’t see her now . ”
218568	218571	218572	218572	he	125	“ Tired ? ”
218575	218614	218572	218572	he	125	“ No ; I only sent down nurse to drink tea with the other grandees . What a delightful day it has been ! I never hoped that such good fruit would rise out of my unhappy blunders . ”
218615	218626	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ The blunders that brought so much good to me . ”
218627	218691	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ Ah ! the old places bring them back again . I have been recollecting how it used to seem to me the depth of my fall that you were marrying me out of pure pity , without my having the spirit to resent or prevent it , and now I just like to think how kind and noble it was in you . ”
218692	218722	218572	218572	he	125	“ I am glad to hear it ! I thought I was so foolishly in love , that I was very glad of any excuse for pressing it on . ”
218723	218734	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ Are the people dispersing ? Where is your uncle ? ”
218735	218755	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ He went home with the Colonel and his wife ; he has quite lost his heart to Ermine . ”
218756	218767	218572	218572	he	125	“ And Una — did you leave her with Grace ? ”
218768	218789	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ No , she trotted down hand in hand with his little lordship : promising to lead her uncle back . ”
218790	218805	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ My dear Alick , you do n’t mean that you trust to that ? ”
218806	218812	218572	218572	he	125	“ Why , hardly implicitly . ”
218813	218850	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ Is that the way you say so ? They may be both over the cliffs . If you will just stay in the room with baby , I will go down and fetch them up . ”
218875	218908	218872	218872	he	125	“ You have run miles enough to - day . I am going down as soon as my uncle has had time to pay his visit in peace , without being hunted . ”
218909	218915	218572	218572	he	125	“ Does he know that ? ”
218916	218946	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ The Colonel does , which comes to the same thing . Is not this boy just of the age that little Keith was when you gave him up ? ”
218947	218965	218872	218872	he	125	“ Yes ; and is it not delightful to see how much larger and heavier he is ! ”
218966	218976	218572	218572	he	125	“ Hardly , considering your objections to fine children . ”
218977	219032	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ Oh , that was only to coarse , over - grown ones . Una is really quite as tall as little Keith , and much more active . You saw he could not play at the game at all , and she was all life and enjoyment , with no notion of shyness . ”
219033	219042	218872	218872	he	125	“ It does not enter into her composition . ”
219043	219074	218572	218572	he	125	“ And she speaks much plainer . I never miss a word she says , and I do n’t understand Keith a bit , though he tells such long stories . ”
219075	219079	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ How backward ! ”
219080	219142	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ Then she knows all her letters by sight — almost all , and Ermine can never get him to tell b from d ; and you know how she can repeat so many little verses , while he could not even say , ‘ Thank you , pretty cow , ’ this morning , when I wanted to hear him . ”
219143	219147	218872	218872	he	125	“ Vast interval ! ”
219148	219166	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ It is only eight months ; but then Una is such a bright , forward child . ”
219167	219173	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ Highly - developed precocity ! ”
219174	219191	218872	218872	he	125	“ Now , Alick , what am I about ? Why are you agreeing with me ? ”
219192	219222	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ I am between the horns of a dilemma . Either our young chieftain must be a dunce , or we are rearing the Clever Woman of the family . ”
219223	219228	219230	219230	Rachel	128	“ I hope not ! ”
219232	219254	219230	219230	Rachel	128	“ Indeed ? I would not grudge her a superior implement , even if I had sometimes cut my own fingers . ”
219255	219273	218538	218538	Alick	125	“ But , Alick , I really do not think I ever was such a Clever Woman . ”
219274	219281	219282	219282	he	4943	“ I never thought you one , ”
219297	219301	219302	219302	she	128	“ I see , ”
219307	219374	219302	219302	she	128	“ I had a few intellectual tastes , and liked to think and read , which was supposed to be cleverness ; and my wilfulness made me fancy myself superior in force of character , in a way I could never have imagined if I had lived more in the world . Contact with really clever people has shown me that I am slow and unready . ”
219375	219396	219294	219294	her	128	“ It was a rusty implement , and you tried weight instead of edge . Now it is infinitely brighter . ”
219397	219402	219403	219403	she	128	“ But , Alick , ”
219417	219429	219430	219430	she	128	“ I believe you may be right about Una , for , ”
219436	219449	219430	219430	she	128	“ she is like the most practically clever person I ever saw . ”
219450	219453	219454	219454	he	2184	“ True , ”
219458	219535	219536	219536	he	2184	“ I see it every day , in every saucy gesture and coaxing smile , when she tries to turn away displeasure in her naughty fits . I hardly knew how to look on at her airs with Keith , it was so exactly like the little sister I first knew . Rachel , such cleverness as that is a far more perilous gift to woman than your plodding intellectuality could ever be . God grant , ”
219552	219592	219536	219536	he	2184	“ that this little fellow may be a kinder , wiser brother than ever I was , and that we may bring her up to your own truth and unselfishness . Then such power would be a happy endowment . ”
219593	219596	219598	219598	Rachel	128	“ Yes , ”
219600	219694	219598	219598	Rachel	128	“ may she never be out of your influence , or be left to untrustworthy hands . I should have been much better if I had had either father or brother to keep me in order . Poor child , she has a wonderful charm , not all my fancy , Alick . And yet there is one whose real working talent has been more than that of any of us , who has made it effective for herself and others , and has let it do her only good , not harm . ”
219695	219769	219430	219430	she	128	“ You are right . If we are to show Una how intellect and brilliant power can be no snares , but only blessings helping the spirits in infirmity and trouble , serving as a real engine for independence and usefulness , winning love and influence for good , genuine talents in the highest sense of the word , then commend me to such a Clever Woman of the family as Ermine Keith . ”
