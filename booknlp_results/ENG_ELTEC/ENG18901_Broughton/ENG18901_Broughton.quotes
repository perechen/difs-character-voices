It is rather a nuisance , particularly as it is such a wet night ; but the fact is , I have promised to read to the ' Oxford Women 's Provident Association .

440	454	456	456	Jim	181	" On the other hand , we had a great many improvident men , "
459	574	456	456	Jim	181	" Well , the fact is , my wife is on the committee , and a good deal interested in it , and we give them a sort of entertainment once a month through the winter terms — tea and buns , that kind of thing , sixpence a head ; they enjoy it far more than if we gave it them for nothing ; and after tea we get people to recite and read and sing to them . I am sure I wish them joy of my reading to - night , for I do not see how I am to make myself audible ; I am as hoarse as a crow . "

And I says to Sophy , ' Now , Sophy , my good girl , have a regular day for your stoves , and do not brush your hair with the bottoms of the saucepans , and do not meddle with the snuffs of the candles , and it stands to reason that it can not be .

7001	7054	7055	7055	They	572	" With my aunt ? Well , I never exactly lived with her ; I made , and make my headquarters there when I am in England , which is not very often . I have been a rolling stone ; I have rolled pretty well round the world since we parted . "

7949	7955	7957	7957	she	590	" You need not be , "
7960	7986	7957	7957	she	590	" he does not mind it in the least ; indeed , happily for him , most of his friends have been sent down too . "
7987	8016	7882	7882	he	198	" What has he been doing this time ? Putting the porter into the fountain ? or screwing up the Dean ? or what other playful little pleasantry ? "
8017	8028	8030	8030	she	590	" You need not speak in that nasty sarcastic voice , "
8038	8073	8030	8030	she	590	" After all , you must know that young men will be young men , or , at least , if you do not know it now , you must have known it once . "
8074	8083	8085	8085	Burgoyne	198	" If you take that tone to me , "
8089	8114	8085	8085	Burgoyne	198	" I shall have to souse your gardener in your fountain , to prove my juvenility ; but come , what has he done ? "
8115	8127	8129	8129	she	590	" Absolutely nothing , as far as I can make out , "
8142	8166	8168	8168	Burgoyne	198	" Do you mean to say that the authorities have sent him down de gaieté de cœur , without any provocation at all ? "
8186	8192	8194	8194	she	590	" I mean to say , "
8198	8256	8194	8194	she	590	" that he had a few men to supper , and I suppose they were making a little noise ; did you ever in your day hear of an undergraduate supper where there was not noise ? However , in this case , from what he tells me , Willy was taking positively no part in it . "
8257	8276	8278	8278	Burgoyne	198	" He was sitting in a corner , with cotton - wool in his ears , reading Aristotle , "
8281	8286	8288	8288	she	590	" And it seems , "
8297	8355	8359	8359	her	590	" that the Proctor came in , and was very rude , and Willy was told to go to the Dean next morning , and he either was a little late , or mistook the hour , or some trifle of that sort ; and when he did go he was told that he was sent down . However"—with
8360	8394	8359	8359	her	590	voice—"it did not matter in the least — he did not mind ; in fact , he was rather glad , as he has long wanted to go to Italy in the spring . "
8395	8412	8460	8460	her	590	" To Italy ? Then perhaps we shall meet ; I too am going to Italy . "
8413	8417	8418	8418	she	590	" Are you ? "
8421	8456	8418	8418	she	590	" Why should you go to Italy ? There is nothing to kill there , is there ? Is not it at Naples that they go out in full chasseur uniform to shoot tomtits ? "
8489	8498	8499	8499	he	599	" You see , Amelia is at Florence , "
8503	8557	8499	8499	he	599	" her father , Mr. Wilson , had a clergyman 's throat in the autumn , and was obliged to give up duty , so they all went abroad . They have been abroad all the winter ; you know that I have not seen her since I came back from the Rockies . "
8606	8618	8699	8699	she	604	" Jim , how long have you been engaged to Amelia ? "
8628	8649	8699	8699	she	604	" Eight years — eight years this next June ; it was the second summer term after I came up . "
8650	8670	8719	8719	her	604	" And as far as you can see , you are likely to be engaged for another eight years ? "
8671	8689	8699	8699	she	604	" As far as I can see — yes ; but then I can not see far . "
8709	8713	8714	8714	she	604	" Poor Amelia ! "
8722	8726	8728	8728	he	599	" Poor Amelia ! "
8731	8748	8728	8728	he	599	" why poor?—for being engaged to me ? You are not very complimentary , Mrs. Byng . "
8756	8778	8749	8749	She	604	" For being engaged to you , or being only engaged to you?—which ? I leave you a choice of interpretation . "
8871	8889	8863	8864	Mrs. Byng	203	" If you and Willy are both going to Italy , why should not you go together ? "
8922	8930	8932	8933	the mother	579	" You do not like the idea ? "
8966	8980	8949	8949	she	604	" I did not say so . I did not even think so . "
8981	8990	8992	8992	she	604	" Willy is an ideal fellow - traveller , "
8994	9004	8949	8949	she	604	" excepting in the matter of punctuality ; I warn you"—laughing—"that
9016	9017	9005	9005	you	181	" "
9020	9025	9005	9005	you	181	" suggests Jim slowly , "
9076	9077	9080	9080	he	181	" "
9134	9149	9129	9129	you	0	" she adds , after a pause , and with a rather wistful air , "
9161	9162	9163	9163	I	0	" "
9217	9392	9209	9209	you	0	" And so it came to pass that a fortnight later , while April is still young , Burgoyne , en route to his Amelia , is standing at a window of the Hotel de Gênes at Genoa , noisiest of hotels , though , to be sure , that is its only fault . He is looking out at the gay market that is held in the piazza below — the gay market that is over and gone by nine o'clock . It seems odd that so many women , so many umbrellas , so many baskets , so many oranges and lemons — each lemon with a glossy green leaf still adhering to its inch of stalk — so many fresh vegetables can be swept away in so short a time . But they are ; all the gay kerchiefs are fled , and have been replaced by a row of fiacres with sad droop - headed horses , a good hour before Byng appears — appears radiantly well washed and apologetic . "
9403	9410	9209	9209	you	0	" asks Burgoyne with some dryness . "
9417	9436	9209	9209	you	0	" replies the other sweetly , sitting down at a little table , and unfolding his breakfast napkin . "
9488	9799	9800	9801	Henry James	206	" Burgoyne is rather inclined to echo the thanksgiving a little later in the day , as they stroll with the pleasant vagueness with which one strays about a little - known foreign town , not exactly knowing whither , through the streets of the queenly city , with which neither of them has much acquaintance ; Byng 's twenty - two years of school and college , of cricket , and grouse , and stalking , having left not much margin for aught else ; and Burgoyne being in the case of some widely - wandered shots and explorers , to whom the Nyanza Lake and the Australian Bush are more familiar than Giotto 's Campanile or the Lagoons . There is a grayish - looking English sky , with now and then little sprays of rain , and now and then flashes of warm sun . Neither of the young men knows much Italian , and such as they possess they are ashamed to air before each other in asking their way , so they wander wherever chance or fancy leads them . They look curiously into churches , they walk down deep narrow streets , whose houses have for three centuries been threatening to embrace each other across the strait sky strip far , far above their heads . They glance at palace - fronts , and wonder at the sculptured portals where fresco and fruit garland and fine tracery speak of a time at more leisure for delicate work that has no end but beauty , than this breathless one . Everywhere in the gardens they see budding green , untrained roses making bowers , ripe oranges hanging over the walls . They jostle against women , each made charming , even the ugliest of them , by the black lace kerchief tied about her head . "
9816	9860	9800	9801	Henry James	206	" says Byng , in a tone of strong dissent , following with his eyes a little tripping figure , and with an expression of pronounced approbation in those eyes , which gives Burgoyne a momentary twinge of misgiving as to his chaperonship . "
9878	9879	9880	9881	All crowds	625	" "
9889	10225	9886	9887	most individuals	626	" replies Burgoyne , misanthropically looking up from his guide - book . They are sauntering down the Via Garibaldi , street of palaces that deserves an antiquer name than that of the somewhat shoddy and recent hero who has god - fathered it . Noblest Via , down whose stately length great towering bulks succeed each other in solid majesty on either hand ; bulks on whose high fronts , lofty - portaled , o'errun with fresco , glorified by brush and chisel , strength and beauty take hands in unending wedlock . Into the noblest of all , up the echoing stone stairs , down which the feet of the masters have for ever ceased to tread , they enter . As we all know , it has been given to the city of Genoa — lovely queen - city meriting so great a gift — by the dying hand of its latest possessor , the last of that high and beautiful race — if we may judge of the dead by their pictures — who paced its floors , and went forth in final funeral pomp through its worthy - to - be - imperial portals . Burgoyne and Byng are standing before the great Vandyke . The custode , opening a shutter , and throwing wider a door , casts a brighter ray of light for the staring Britons — several others have joined themselves to our friends — to gape at it by . What does the stately gentleman on his great white horse , whom Vandyke has made able to set at naught death 's effacement , think of them , as the custode slowly swings him forward on his hinges , so that the day - beams may bring out more clearly still the arresting charm of his serious face , his outstretched arm , and grave , gallant bearing ? Looking at him , whose heart among us is not besieged by an ache of longing that that "
10229	10368	9886	9887	most individuals	626	" gentleman on the brave white charger should ride down to us out of his frame , and bring back his world with him ? probably not a better world than ours , but surely , surely a handsomer one . After awhile the other tourists drift away , but the two men still stand and gaze . Into Burgoyne 's mind has come a sense of disgust with the present , a revolt against steam trams and the Cromwell Road — most perfect symbol of that bald , unending , vulgar ugliness , which , in some moods , must seem to everyone the dominant note of nineteenth - century life . The light - hearted Byng , who always takes his colour from his surroundings , is hushed into a silence that is almost reverent too . "
10382	10387	10375	10375	his	627	" he says presently . "
10457	10458	10449	10449	he	627	" "
10477	10569	10449	10449	he	627	" asks Burgoyne , rousing himself , and looking over his shoulder towards the entrance to the next frescoed , mirrored , pictured room , whence he hears the sound of approaching voices . In his eye is an idle and mechanical curiosity , mixed with vexation that his short respite from his fellow - countrymen is ended ; in this case , it is fellow - countrywomen , for the tones that are nearing are those of a woman , a woman who is saying in a key of satisfaction , "
10587	10958	10576	10576	I	0	" At the same moment the speaker , as well as the person addressed , came into sight ; and in an instant out of Burgoyne 's eye has raced away the lack - lustre curiosity , and has given way to an expression of something beyond surprise , of something more nearly verging on consternation ; and yet , after all , there is nothing very astonishing in the fact that it is Mrs. Le Marchant who is the woman in search of the Vandyke . There is nothing more surprising in her being at Genoa than in his being there himself . At that mart of nations it can never be matter for wonder to meet anyone ; but who is this to whom her observation is addressed ? It is not Mr. Le Marchant , it is not a man at all ; it is a slight woman — like Lance 's sister , dressed with that neat , tight , gray - tinted simplicity , severe yet smart , which marks the well - bred Englishwoman on her travels . Is it one of the younger ones , who has grown up so startlingly like her ? Miriam ? Rose ? or is it , can it be , the dead Elizabeth ? In a ripe civilization such as ours there are formulas provided to meet the requirements of every exigency that may possibly arise ; but amongst them there is not one which teaches us how to greet a person come back from the dead , because it is held impossible that such a contingency can occur . Perhaps this is the reason why Jim Burgoyne , usually a docile and obedient member of the society to which he belongs , now flies in the face of all the precepts instilled into him by that society 's code . At the sight of Elizabeth Le Marchant entering the room , clad in a very neat tailor gown , instead of the winding - sheet with which he had credited her , he at first stands transfixed , staring at her with a hardness of intensity which is allowed to us in the case of Titian 's "
10961	10965	10576	10576	I	0	" or Botticelli 's "
10968	11007	11008	11008	Elizabeth	193	" but has never been accounted permissible in the case of a more living loveliness . Then , before he can control , or even question the impulse that drives him , it has carried him to her . "
11010	11051	11054	11054	Elizabeth	193	" he says , in that sort of awed semi - whisper with which one would salute a being plainly returned from the other side , fearing that the fulness of a living voice might strike too strongly on his disused ear—"is
11056	11410	11054	11054	Elizabeth	193	" Had Burgoyne been quite sure , even now , of that fact ; if he had had his wits well about him , he would certainly not have addressed her by her Christian name . But from the dead the small pomps and ceremonies of earth fall off . We think of them by their naked names — must we not then appeal to them by the same when they reappear before us ? The girl — for she does not look much more — thus rudely and startlingly bombarded , drops her Baedeker out of her slim - gloved hand , and with a positive jump at the suddenness of the address , looks back apprehensively at her interlocutor . In her eyes is , at first , only the coldly frightened expression of one discourteously assailed by an insolent stranger ; but in a space of time as short as had served him to note the same metamorphosis in the case of her parents , he sees the look of half — three - quarter — whole recognition dawn in her eyes , followed — alas ! there can be no mistake about it — by the same aspiration after flight . There is no reason why she should not recognise him again at once . He has fallen a prey neither to hair nor fat — the two main disguisers and disfigurers of humanity . His face is as smooth and his figure as spare as when , ten years ago , he had given the pretty tomboy of sixteen lessons in jumping the ha - ha . And as to her identity , no shadow of doubt any longer lingers in his mind . The violence and shock of his attack have made her crimson , have matched her cheeks with those long - withered damasks in the Moat garden , with which they used to vie in bloomy vividness . But even yet he does not treat her quite as if she were really and veritably living ; he has not yet got back his conventional manners . "
11417	11462	11411	11411	I	0	" he says , his voice not even yet raised to its ordinary key , some vague awe still subduing it . It must be a trick of his excited imagination that makes it seem to him as if she said under her breath , "
11467	11492	11464	11464	I	0	" But before he has had time to do more than distrust the testimony of his ears , Mrs. Le Marchant strikes in quickly — "
11502	11511	11498	11499	Mr. Burgoyne	198	" says she , with a constrained laugh ; "
11577	11630	11631	11631	You	193	" She pours out her questions with such torrent - force and rapidity , as gives to her auditor the conviction that it is her aim to have a monopoly of them . After one look of unbounded astonishment at his companion 's onslaught , Byng has withdrawn to a discreet distance . "
11642	11674	11631	11631	You	193	" says Burgoyne , disregarding her trivial and conventional questions , and turning his eyes away with difficulty from his old playfellow . Mrs. Le Marchant laughs again , still constrainedly . "
11682	11683	11676	11676	you	0	" "
11688	11693	11684	11684	I	0	" he says solemnly ; "
11724	11737	11717	11717	I	0	" A sort of slight shiver passes over the woman 's frame . "
11745	11899	11717	11717	I	0	" During the foregoing little dialogue about herself , Elizabeth has stood with her eyes on the ground ; but at the end of it she lifts them to smile lovingly at her mother . They are very pretty eyes still , but surely they seem to have cried a good deal ; and now that the hurrying blood has left her cheek again , Burgoyne sees that she looks more nearly her age than he had imagined at the first glance . He has not heard her voice yet ; she has not spoken , unless that first shaken whisper — so much more likely to be the freak of his own heated fancy — could count for speech . He must hear her tones . Do they keep an echo of the other world , as he still imagines that he sees a shade from it lying lingeringly across her face ? "
11909	11935	11901	11901	you	640	" he asks abruptly . She starts slightly , and again , though with a weaker red wave , her rather thin cheeks grow tinged . "
11942	11959	11901	11901	you	640	" she says , with a bewildered look , and speaking in a somewhat tremulous voice . "
11960	11968	11901	11901	you	640	Yes"—slowly , as if with an effort of memory—"I
11973	11974	11901	11901	you	640	" "
11982	11994	11975	11975	You	640	" cries Jim , in an accent of absurdly disproportioned disappointment . "
12007	12065	12003	12003	you	640	" Perhaps she is putting her memory to the same strain as he had done his in the case of her mother 's name on the occasion of their Oxford meeting . At all events , she leaves the question unanswered , and the elder woman again hurries to her help against this persistent claimant of reminiscences . "
12080	12092	12066	12066	You	641	" she says with a touch of friendliness in her look . "
12121	12122	12113	12113	you	641	" "
12129	12139	12140	12140	he	210	" inquires Jim , thus reminded to put his tardy query—"is
12144	12145	12140	12140	he	210	" "
12159	12181	12148	12148	he	210	not"—smiling—"'dear abroad ' to him , but I think that he will very likely come out to Florence to fetch us . "
12182	12189	12191	12193	the young man	643	" You are going to Florence ? "
12196	12211	12191	12193	the young man	643	" So am I ! oh , hurrah ! then we shall often meet . "
12254	12272	12250	12250	she	189	" We do not intend to go out at all in Florence — I mean into society . "
12273	12280	12282	12282	he	643	" But I am not society , "
12289	12291	12250	12250	she	189	" I wish"—glancing
12298	12342	12250	12250	she	189	other—"that I could give you a little of my memory . If I could , you would see that , after being so infinitely good to me at the Moat , you can not expect me to meet you as total strangers now . "
12425	12435	12409	12411	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" And you have remembered us all these years ? "
12463	12474	12476	12476	she	189	" And you are on your way to Florence too ? "
12532	12535	12536	12536	His	643	" Yes . "
12557	12567	12568	12568	He	643	" Not on any unpleasant errand , I hope ? "
12594	12611	12568	12568	He	643	" I am going to see my young woman — the girl I am engaged to . "
12612	12623	12568	12568	He	643	" Well , that is a pleasant errand , surely ? "
12628	12632	12634	12634	Jim	181	" C'est salon ! "
12637	12650	12634	12634	Jim	181	" I have a piece of ill - news to tell her ; "
12664	12683	12634	12634	Jim	181	" which way do you think that ill - news read best — on paper or vivâ voce ? "
12689	12703	12634	12634	Jim	181	" I do not know . I do not like them either way . "
12728	12747	12725	12725	she	189	" It is actually a quarter to two ! Are not you famished , Elizabeth ? I am ! "
12770	12780	12781	12781	he	181	" Have you decided upon your hotel in Florence ? "
12785	12793	12795	12795	her	189	" We have decided against them all , "
12798	12838	12839	12839	She	189	" We have taken a little apartment — a poor little entresol ; but it is such a poor little one , that I should be ashamed to ask any of my friends to come and see me there . "
12985	13006	12962	12962	Byng	203	" Did I hear you tell that lady , when first you spoke to her , that she was dead ? "
13007	13013	13077	13077	Byng	203	" I thought she was . "
13014	13020	13077	13077	Byng	203	" Had you heard it ? "
13021	13024	12962	12962	Byng	203	" No . "
13025	13034	13077	13077	Byng	203	" Did you see it in the papers ? "
13035	13038	13077	13077	Byng	203	" No . "
13042	13052	13053	13054	The other	396	" I wonder why you thought she was dead . "
13061	13076	13053	13054	The other	396	" I had no reason — none whatever . It was an idiotic inference . "
13085	13101	13102	13102	Jim	181	" Well , at all events , I am very glad that she is not . "
13139	13165	13123	13123	her	217	" Why should you be glad of that , Betsy ? She is unbeknown to you except by hearing . Why should you be glad ? "
13216	13219	13245	13247	the younger man	654	" Sairey . "
13220	13236	13245	13247	the younger man	654	" I do not quite see how it affects you . Why are you glad ? "
13237	13243	13245	13247	the younger man	654	" Why am I glad ? "
13254	13267	13245	13247	the younger man	654	" For the same reason that I am glad that Vandyke painted that picture"—pointing
13269	13288	13245	13247	the younger man	654	it—"or that Shakespeare wrote As You Like It . The world is the richer by them all three . "
13304	13307	13245	13247	the younger man	654	" Humph ! "
13308	13387	13245	13247	the younger man	654	" There are no more by - path meadows where you may innocently linger , but the road lies long and straight and dusty to the grave . You may think you had a conscience and believed in God ; but what is conscience to a wife ? .... To marry is to domesticate the Recording Angel . Once you are married , there is nothing left for you — not even suicide — but to be good . "
13688	13701	13665	13667	the younger man	654	" I suppose you are off to the Anglo - Américain now . "
13702	13707	13709	13709	Jim	181	" I think not , "
13712	13727	13728	13728	He	181	" it is past ten , you see , and they are early people . "
13743	13776	13728	13728	He	181	" Mr. Wilson is rather an invalid , and there is also an invalid or semi - invalid sister ; I think that I had better not disturb them to - night . "
13952	13993	13944	13944	her	393	" Would you mind coming into the dining - room ? Sybilla is in the drawing - room already this morning . She said she was afraid it was going to be one of her bad days , so I thought "
13998	14024	13944	13944	her	393	" that possibly she would be a little later than usual in coming down ; but , on the contrary , she is much earlier . "
14217	14228	14205	14205	He	181	" out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh "
14267	14278	14280	14281	the woman	431	" And are you really glad to see me again ? "
14330	14340	14342	14342	he	181	" I decline to answer all such futile inquiries , "
14357	14397	14354	14354	his	181	" Even if I did not discourage them on principle , I should have no time to answer them to - day ; I have so much to say to you that I do not know where to begin . "
14398	14408	14410	14410	she	431	" After ten months that is not very surprising , "
14443	14452	14453	14453	he	181	" Of course not ! of course not ! "
14457	14471	14453	14453	he	181	" but it is not really ten months — no , surely — — "
14472	14488	14512	14512	she	431	" Ten months , one week , two days , four hours and a half ! "
14521	14535	14536	14536	he	181	" And how are things going ? How are you all getting on ? "
14566	14570	14536	14536	he	181	" Your father ? "
14571	14575	14536	14536	he	181	" His throat is better"—with
14596	14600	14536	14536	he	181	" And Sybilla ? "
14601	14616	14536	14536	he	181	" Oh , poor Sybilla ! she has her bad days now and then . "
14617	14645	14647	14647	Jim	181	" And , like the early Christians , she resolves to have all things in common . I expect that her family have their bad days too , "
14650	14657	14659	14659	Amelia	201	" Well , we do sometimes , "
14664	14684	14659	14659	Amelia	201	" but she really does try to control herself , poor thing ; she is hardly ever unbearable now . "
14685	14689	14536	14536	he	181	" And Cecilia ? "
14690	14737	14536	14536	he	181	" She is rather in trouble just now ; I fear there is no doubt that the man she was engaged to has thrown her over . You never saw him ? Oh no ! Of course , the affair came on after you left England . "
14763	14790	14536	14536	he	181	" How many does that make ? Four ? Well , courage ! There is luck in odd numbers ; perhaps she will land the fifth . "
14791	14800	14802	14802	Amelia	201	" She will tell you about it herself , "
14804	14828	14802	14802	Amelia	201	" she tells everybody ; she likes talking about it — it is very odd , but she does . When you throw me over"—rubbing
14844	14857	14802	14802	Amelia	201	cheek—"I shall tell nobody ; I shall keep my misfortune very dark . "
14858	14863	14865	14865	he	181	" When I do ! "
14919	14922	14923	14923	he	181	" Meanwhile , "
14949	14958	14923	14923	he	181	" meanwhile , someone has thrown me over . "
14959	14962	14926	14926	his	181	" You ? "
14963	15004	14926	14926	his	181	" Yes , me ; I did not write it to you , because I do not see much use in putting down bad news in black and white , and even with this little delay , I am afraid , "
15010	15022	15023	15023	He	181	" that you will have plenty of time to enjoy it . "
15055	15064	15030	15030	she	693	" My aunt is going to be married . "
15100	15103	15104	15104	she	201	" Married ! "
15110	15120	15104	15104	she	201	" Why , she is quite , quite old ! "
15121	15128	15134	15134	Amelia	201	" She is sixty - five ! "
15161	15173	15154	15154	she	201	" And is he?—do you?—has she chosen wisely , I mean ? "
15178	15226	15174	15174	Jim	181	" Can one choose wisely at sixty - five ? Well , whether she has or no is a matter of opinion ; she has chosen the curate of the parish , who , by reason of his extreme juvenility , is still in deacon 's orders . "
15271	15285	15286	15286	she	201	" And can not you hinder it , can not you dissuade her ? "
15290	15339	15286	15286	she	201	" I shall not try ; poor old woman ! After all , she has a right to pursue her own happiness in her own way , only I wish that she had made up her mind twenty years ago ; though , to be sure , how could she?"—with
15341	15356	15243	15243	She	200	smile—"since , at that time , her bridegroom was not much more than born . "
15456	15470	15473	15473	his	181	" Will it — will it — make a great difference to you ? "
15499	15507	15508	15508	he	181	" It will make all the difference ! "
15578	15589	15590	15590	he	181	" Her money is almost entirely in her own power , "
15598	15622	15590	15590	he	181	" and when she announced her marriage to me , she also announced her intention of settling the whole of it upon her — her"—he
15646	15649	15590	15590	he	181	calm—"her husband . "
15700	15705	15706	15706	she	201	" Her whole fortune ? "
15712	15715	15717	15717	Jim	181	" All ? "
15738	15805	15812	15812	his	181	" My dear , do not look so broken - hearted . I am not absolutely destitute ; I need not become a sandwich man . I have still got my £ 800 a year , my very own , which neither man nor mouse , neither curate nor vicar , can take from me . I can still go on rioting upon that ; the question is"—his
15815	15828	15812	15812	his	181	graver—"have I any right to ask you to riot on it too ? "
15932	15942	15943	15943	he	181	" The one thing that I blame her for , "
15989	16042	15943	15943	he	181	" the only thing I blame her for , is her having hindered my adopting any profession . Poor old woman , it was not malice prepense , I know ; she had not seen her Jessamey then , probably had not even a prophetic instinct of him , but as things turned out"—stifling
16044	16062	16063	16063	Amelia	201	sigh—"it would have been kinder to have put me in the way of earning my own living . "
16122	16129	16130	16130	she	201	" It was monstrous of her ! "
16147	16161	16130	16130	she	201	" After having always told you that you were to be her heir ! "
16162	16170	16172	16172	Jim	181	" But had she told me so ? "
16186	16245	16247	16247	his	181	" That is what I have been trying to recall for the last few days . I never remember the time when I did not believe it , so I suppose that someone must have told me so ; but I could not swear that she herself had ever put it down in black and white . However , "
16265	16294	16338	16338	his	181	" what does that matter now ? I am not her heir , I am nobody 's heir ; we must look facts in the face ! Amelia , dear"—in
16325	16333	16338	16338	his	181	pain—"we must look facts in the face ! "
16354	16366	16371	16371	he	181	" It is very hard for me , dear , after all these"—he
16376	16382	16371	16371	he	181	" weary years ' waiting , "
16408	16426	16406	16406	he	181	on—"after all these many years ' waiting , to have come to this , is not it ? "
16458	16464	16465	16465	she	201	" They were not long ! "
16469	16493	16465	16465	she	201	" Nothing is , nothing can be , long to me as long as I have you , or the hope of you ! "
16713	16718	16719	16719	he	181	" Have you realized , "
16722	16787	16719	16719	he	181	" that I shall never be better off than I am now ? never ! never ! For though of course I shall try to get work , one knows how successful that quest generally is in the case of a man with no special aptitudes , no technical training , and who starts in the race handicapped by being ten years too late ! "
16811	16816	16805	16805	She	201	" I realize it . "
16817	16835	16836	16836	he	181	" And this is what I have brought you to , after all these years ' waiting , "
16846	16873	16836	16836	he	181	" All I can offer you at the end of them is a not particularly genteel poverty , not even a cottage with a double coach - house!"—laughing
16876	16893	16895	16895	Amelia	201	" I do not want a double coach - house , nor even a single one ! "
16909	16935	16895	16895	Amelia	201	" Do not you know that I had rather drive a costermonger 's barrow with you than go in a coach and six without you ! "
17001	17011	17012	17012	She	201	" If you will never be better off — — "
17015	17064	17012	17012	She	201	" Yes , dear , go on ; ' if I shall never be better off'—I certainly never shall ; I feel sure that you will be able to put my earnings for the next ten years into your eye , and see none the worse for them ! "
17065	17081	17082	17082	she	201	" If — you — will — never — be — better — off — — "
17097	17102	17082	17082	she	201	" Well , dear ? "
17103	17110	17082	17082	she	201	" If you will never be better off"—this
17137	17144	17114	17114	her	201	breast—"why should we wait any longer ? "
17445	17449	17450	17450	he	181	" I believe , "
17457	17478	17450	17450	he	181	" that you would have married me eight years ago , on my pittance , if I had asked you ! "
17480	17482	17450	17450	he	181	" Yes "
17525	17532	17533	17533	he	181	" And I never suspected it ! "
17537	17568	17533	17533	he	181	" I give you my word of honour , I never suspected it ! I thought you looked upon my poverty in as prohibitory a light as I did myself . "
17569	17579	17581	17581	Amelia	201	" I do not call it such great poverty , "
17594	17654	17581	17581	Amelia	201	" Of course , it is an income that would require a little management ; but if we cut our coat according to our cloth , and did not want to move about too much , we might live either in a not very fashionable part of London , or in some cheap district in the country very comfortably . "
17773	17792	17797	17797	her	201	" But it would not be fair ; it would be asking you to give up too much . "
17814	17825	17826	17826	he	706	" Is not it my turn to give up something ? "
17830	17851	17826	17826	he	706	" and besides , it is time for me to settle ! I am — I am tired of wandering ! "
17925	17939	17911	17911	she	201	" At least , if I am not , I ought to be ! "
17953	17964	17942	17942	she	201	" If I could only believe that that was true ! "
17965	17970	17972	17972	he	706	" It is true , "
17978	18027	17972	17972	he	706	" at least , true enough for all working purposes ; we all know that life is a series of compromises , a balancing of gain and loss . I shall lose something , I do not deny that , but I gain more — I gain you ! "
18028	18040	18041	18041	she	201	" That is such a mighty gain , is it not ? "
18067	18079	18081	18081	he	706	" A matter of taste — a mere matter of taste ! "
18151	18215	18216	18216	He	706	" Why should not we be married at once ? to - morrow ? the day after to - morrow ? at the Consulate — of course there is a Consulate — or the English church ; I suppose there are half a dozen English churches . Why not ? We have nothing to wait for , and we are both of age ! "
18341	18356	18357	18357	she	201	" You must be making fun of me , to suggest such a thing ! "
18364	18389	18357	18357	she	201	" you know how wildly impossible it would be that I should leave them all — my father — Sybilla — without any preparation . "
18390	18395	18397	18397	Jim	181	" Without any preparation ! "
18403	18416	18417	18417	He	706	" Have not you been preparing them for the last eight years ? "
18491	18573	18477	18477	he	706	" I am afraid that you will have to leave them all some day ; I am afraid that our Bayswater mansion — by - the - bye , I am sure it will not be a mansion , for I am sure it will not have a back - door — will not be likely to contain all . Your father — Sybilla — Sybilla and her physic bottles take up a good deal of room , do not they ? "
18603	18638	18580	18580	she	201	" If you would consent to wait till we get home — father does not mean to stay in Italy beyond the end of next month — we might be married in June ; that "
18647	18656	18580	18580	she	201	" would not be so long to wait . "
18731	18742	18746	18746	he	181	" As you will , then , as you will ! "
18766	18782	18746	18746	he	181	" Of course , dear , the sooner I get you the better for me ! "
18816	18822	18823	18823	she	222	" Do not be afraid , "
18830	18859	18823	18823	she	222	" I will not stay a minute , but I just wanted to say ' How do you do ? ' How well you are looking ! and how young!"—with
18882	18885	18823	18823	she	222	" Ah ! "
18889	18912	18823	18823	she	222	" with all your Rocky Mountain experiences , it is evident that you have been having an easier time than we have ! "
18913	18920	18922	18922	Jim	181	" Are you alluding to Sybilla ? "
18925	18949	18922	18922	Jim	181	" I have no doubt , from what I know of her powers in that line , that she has been extremely trying . "
18950	18955	18957	18958	the girl	3289	" Yes , partly , "
18961	18983	18957	18958	the girl	3289	" but I have had troubles of my own too . I dare say that Amelia has told you , or probably "
18992	19000	18957	18958	the girl	3289	" you have been more pleasantly employed . "
19001	19009	19011	19011	Jim	181	" Amelia did hint at some disaster , "
19040	19054	18957	18958	the girl	3289	" but I have been waiting to hear all the details from yourself . "
19055	19068	19070	19070	Cecilia	222	" I know that you are apt to think I fancy things , "
19080	19121	19070	19070	Cecilia	222	" but there could be no fancy in this case ; I am sure I was as much engaged as any girl ever was . I had chosen the drawing - room paper and bought the dining - room grate ! "
19122	19137	19139	19139	Jim	181	" That is further than we ever got , is not it , Amelia ? "
19161	19190	19139	19139	Jim	181	" but , Cis , if I were you , I should keep the grate ; one does not know how soon its services may be required again ! "
19191	19202	19204	19204	Cecilia	222	" It is all very well for you to joke , "
19211	19224	19204	19204	Cecilia	222	" it may be play to you , but it is — — "
19225	19235	19237	19237	Burgoyne	181	" Not death , not quite death to you ! "
19249	19277	19237	19237	Burgoyne	181	" I think you will live to fight another day , will not you ? But I really am extremely sorry ; tell me all about it . "
19278	19288	19290	19290	Cecilia	222	" He was perfectly right when we left England , "
19309	19480	19290	19290	Cecilia	222	" nobody could have been more so ; he came to see us off at Folkestone , and the tears were in his eyes ; they were really , it was not my imagination , was it , Amelia ? And at first he wrote all right , and said all the usual things ; but then his letters gradually grew fewer and fewer , and after I had written and telegraphed a great many times — I do not know how many times I did not telegraph to ask whether he was ill , and you know how expensive foreign telegrams are — he sent me a few lines , oh , such cruel lines , were not they , Amelia ? to say that , on reflection , he feared that the feeling he had for me was not such as to justify his entering on so sacred an engagement as marriage with me ; but he ought to have thought of that before , ought not he ? "
19481	19484	19290	19290	Cecilia	222	" Undoubtedly ! "
19485	19496	19498	19498	Cecilia	222	" I will never engage myself to a clergyman again , "
19550	19576	19541	19541	he	181	" They do play one dirty turns now and then , do not they ? Yes , Cis , stick to laymen for the future ! "
19604	19612	19613	19613	she	222	" Let us talk about something pleasanter , "
19616	19643	19613	19613	she	222	" Had you a good journey ? Do you like your travelling companion ? Why did not you bring him with you ? Is he nice ? "
19644	19655	19657	19657	Jim	181	" At all events , he is not a clergyman , "
19665	19694	19657	19657	Jim	181	" but no , my dear , do not let your thoughts turn in that direction ! You must look at him as poor women look at diamonds ! "
19695	19707	19709	19709	Cecilia	222	" I am sure I do not know what you mean ! "
19713	19743	19748	19748	she	222	" I have not the slightest wish to look at him ! I am not in spirits to ' look , ' as you call it , at anyone ! "
19760	19784	19748	19748	she	222	" We are certainly an unlucky family in our loves ! I , heartlessly thrown over , and Amelia engaged for eight years ! "
19788	19799	19800	19800	he	181	" Amelia is not going to be engaged any longer , "
19810	19820	19800	19800	he	181	" Amelia is going to be married at once ! "
20049	20061	20062	20062	she	221	" You will take us some excursions , will not you ? "
20076	20102	20062	20062	she	221	" Father is so unenterprising , we have really seen scarcely anything ; but you will take us some excursions now , will not you ? "
20103	20115	20117	20117	Burgoyne	181	" Are you sure that your spirits are equal to them ? "
20120	20132	20134	20134	she	221	" I do not know about that , I am sure , "
20142	20173	20134	20134	she	221	" but one must make an exertion sometime , and I think a little distraction would do me good , and so I am sure it would to poor Amelia ! "
20174	20186	20188	20190	the young man	643	" Poor Amelia will shortly have the distraction of being married , "
20212	20222	20224	20224	Cecilia	222	" And I think it would be only civil , "
20227	20250	20224	20224	Cecilia	222	" in fact , I do not see how you could avoid it , if you invited your friend to join us . "
20810	20815	20816	20816	he	750	" They have arrived ! "
20829	20831	20825	20825	Burgoyne	181	" they "
20879	20882	20891	20891	he	181	" Oh ! "
20896	20911	20913	20913	Byng	203	" I thought that they could not stay more than another day in Genoa , "
20934	21019	20913	20913	Byng	203	" So I thought I would just run down to the station to meet the evening train , the one we came by last night ; however , it must have been more punctual than yesterday , for before I reached the station , I met them ; I mean they passed me in a fiacre . I only caught a glimpse of her face , but I saw her hand ; it was lying on the carriage door like a snow - flake . "
21020	21025	21027	21027	Burgoyne	181	" Like my grandmother ! "
21076	21106	21107	21107	Jim	181	" I do not know what colour your grandmother was ; but she must have been very unlike most people 's if she was like a snow - flake . "
21144	21159	21161	21161	Byng	203	" I had a good mind to tell my fiacre man to follow them , "
21168	21221	21161	21161	Byng	203	" but , in the first place , I did not know how to say it — really , Jim , we must get up a little of the lingo — and , in the second place , I thought it would perhaps be rather too much in the private detective line . "
21222	21232	21234	21234	Jim	181	" I think it would have been extremely ungentlemanlike ! "
21247	21268	21237	21237	Byng	203	" That is coming it rather strong , is not it ? but anyhow , I did not do it . "

22153	22178	22180	22180	Jim	206	" If you had been going through as many kitchen - ranges as I have this morning , perhaps you would have a headache , "
22183	22200	22180	22180	Jim	206	" You know that I am going to be married as soon as I get home . "
22236	22248	22250	22250	Byng	203	" When are you going to introduce me to Miss Wilson ? "
22253	22271	22272	22272	Jim	181	" If you shirk it much longer , I shall think that you are ashamed of me . "
22311	22322	22323	22323	he	181	" You have so large an acquaintance in Florence already , "
22330	22345	22323	22323	he	181	" that I did not know that you would care to add to it . "

22364	22379	22380	22380	he	181	" You know I love my fellow - creatures ; and in this case , "
22384	22391	22380	22380	he	181	" I do care very much . "

22485	22520	22439	22439	he	181	" No - o - o ; not to - day , I think . It has been arranged that we are to go to San Miniato — Amelia , her sister , and I. "
22521	22526	22531	22531	his	181	" Three of you ? "
22534	22547	22531	22531	his	181	" Then why not four ? Why may not I come too ? "
22676	22689	22690	22690	she	221	" So you are going off on a long afternoon 's pleasuring ? "
22698	22752	22690	22690	she	221	" I am so glad that neither of my sisters is going to stay at home with me . We invalids must guard against growing selfish , though I think that is perhaps more the danger with malades imaginaires ; we real ones have learnt our lesson of suffering better , I hope . "

22792	22802	22804	22804	Sybilla	221	" Ah , that is because of my colour , "
22814	22864	22804	22804	Sybilla	221	" You , too , fall into that common error . My London doctor tells me that there is no such unerring indication of radical delicacy of constitution as a fixed pink colour like mine ; the more feverish I am , the deeper it grows . It is very hard"—smiling

27541	27553	27554	27554	Byng	203	" Did Miss or Mrs. Le Marchant ask you to call ? "
27557	27571	27554	27554	Byng	203	" Both of them are as innocent of it as the babe unborn ! "
27572	27578	27554	27554	Byng	203	" You asked yourself then ? "
27589	27595	27586	27586	Byng	203	" And she said yes ? "
27631	27645	27646	27646	he	181	" If she did not say ' Yes'—if she said ' No , ' "
27655	27662	27646	27646	he	181	" I fail to understand — — "
27663	27672	27674	27674	Byng	203	" She did not say ' No , ' "
27686	27715	27722	27722	he	181	" She began to say it ; but I suppose that I looked so broken - hearted — I am sure I felt it — that she stopped . "
27730	27747	27722	27722	he	181	" After all , she can but send me away . One is always being sent away "
27761	27787	27722	27722	he	181	" but now and again one is not sent , and those are the times that pay for the others ! I 'll risk it . "
27815	27819	27811	27813	the younger man	654	" Come now , Jim"—looking
27832	27848	27797	27797	he	181	countenance—"speak up ! Do you know of any cause or impediment why I should not ? "
27995	28000	28001	28001	he	181	" My dear boy , "
28010	28028	28001	28001	he	181	heartily—"I see no earthly reason why you should not go ; you could not make nicer friends . "
28029	28038	28040	28040	Byng	203	" Then why will not you come too ? "
28052	28068	28049	28049	his	396	" They had much rather I stayed away ; they have taken me en grippe . "
28069	28078	28001	28001	he	181	" Pooh ! Nonsense ! You fancy it . "
28079	28082	28049	28049	his	396	" I think not"—speaking
28085	28161	28049	28049	his	396	thoughtfully—"I am not a fanciful person , nor apt to imagine that my acquaintances bother their heads about me one way or another ; but when people try their best , in the first instance , to avoid recognising you at all , and on every subsequent occasion endeavour to disappear as soon as you come in sight , it is not a very forced assumption that they are not exactly greedy for your society . "
28184	28215	28001	28001	he	181	" I think it is because I remind them of the past ; they have evidently some unpleasant association of ideas with that past . I wonder what it is . "
28228	28251	28253	28255	the younger man	654	" Perhaps some of them have died , or come to grief , and they are afraid of your asking after them , "
28257	28272	28253	28255	the younger man	654	" On the contrary — they are all — one more flourishing than another . "
28273	28307	28309	28309	Byng	203	" Well , I would give them one more trial , anyhow ; I am sure they would come round . Give them time , and I am sure they would come round ! "
28314	28334	28309	28309	Byng	203	" What could have been pleasanter than Mrs. Le Marchant 's manner when you presented her to Miss Wilson ? "
28423	28429	28431	28431	Byng	203	" You had better come , "
28506	28511	28513	28513	Jim	181	" My dear boy , "
28525	28575	28513	28513	Jim	181	" you are really too obliging ; but , even if I wished it — which I do not — or even if they wished it — which they do not — it is in this case quite impossible , as I am engaged to go shopping with Amelia . "
28837	28848	28849	28849	she	221	" You have appeared at a not very happy moment , "
28856	28882	28849	28849	she	221	" we have been having a family breeze ; it has sent my temperature up nicely ! It is 100 , 100 , Point 2 . "
28911	28942	28908	28908	he	181	" If it were 1,000 , Point 99 , I should not be surprised , in this atmosphere ! Good Heavens , Cis , are not you hot enough already ? "
29005	29011	29012	29012	she	968	" Father behaves so childishly , "
29019	29031	29012	29012	she	968	" You must own that it was enough to provoke him , "
29039	29064	29066	29066	Jim	181	" What was enough to provoke him ? How has he shown his childishness ? For Heaven 's sake , some of you explain ! "
29122	29127	29128	29128	she	968	" The fact is , "
29148	29168	29128	29128	she	968	" that Mr. Dashwood , the man to whom I was engaged , has chosen to marry . I am sure"—with
29170	29260	29261	29261	Jim	181	shrug—"no one has the least desire to deny his perfect right to do so ; and this morning there arrived by post a bit of his wedding - cake ! I suppose he meant it civilly ; but father chose to take it as an insult to himself , and though it was addressed to me , he threw it into the fire . I am very fond of wedding - cake ; so , as soon as father 's back was turned , I fished it out again ! "
29272	29292	29261	29261	Jim	181	" Bravo , Cis ! You are a real philosopher ! We might all learn a lesson from you . "
29293	29303	29305	29305	Sybilla	221	" What have you done with your nice friend ? "
29308	29343	29305	29305	Sybilla	221	" Amelia , dear , this couvre - pied is slipping off me again . What a sympathetic voice he has ! I am sure he has been a great deal with sick people . "
29344	29378	29261	29261	Jim	181	" I left him putting on his best tie to go out calling . No , calm yourself , Cecilia , not on you ; it is not your turn to - day . "
29379	29386	29388	29389	the girl	3289	" Whose turn is it then ? "
29460	29476	29448	29448	He	181	" I believe it is the Piazza d'Azeglio upon which that luminary is to shine . "
29477	29493	29495	29495	Amelia	201	" Is he going to see that lovely creature to whom you introduced me yesterday ? "
29503	29538	29495	29495	Amelia	201	" I heard her telling him that she lived in the Piazza d'Azeglio . Oh , Jim , how pretty she is ! One ought to pay for being allowed to look at her . "
29600	29619	29621	29621	Cecilia	222	" She looks as if she had had a history ; that always improves a woman 's appearance , "
29643	29647	29621	29621	Cecilia	222	" Has she ? "
29648	29654	29621	29621	Cecilia	222	" I never asked her . "
29655	29663	29673	29673	her	201	" Why did not you go too ? "
29725	29763	29798	29798	he	976	" They are old friends of yours , are not they ? They may be hurt if they find that a perfect stranger like Mr. Byng is in a greater hurry to visit them than you are . "
29806	29842	29798	29798	he	976	" Why did not I go too ? Because I was under the impression that I was engaged to go with another lovely being to choose crockery , was I not ? Am I not ? "
29968	29981	29983	29984	Miss Wilson	200	" I could not say so , of course , before her , "
29995	30110	29983	29984	Miss Wilson	200	" or she might have insisted upon my going . She is very unselfish sometimes ; but the fact is , I do not think I ought to leave Sybilla again to - day . You see , she was alone the whole of yesterday afternoon ; and when we came back we found her in a very low way . She had been reading her book of prescriptions — you know the book ; all the prescriptions which she has had for the last ten years bound up together — and we rather dread her bringing it out , as she always fancies that she is going to have the disease prescribed for . "
30111	30114	29983	29984	Miss Wilson	200	" Humph ! "
30115	30132	30134	30134	Amelia	201	" And , after all , happiness ought not to make one selfish , ought it ? "
30157	30175	30144	30144	she	201	" I have so much of you now — oh , so much!—not to speak of — — "
30176	30187	30189	30189	Jim	181	" Cecilia , of course , is incapacitated by grief ? "
30192	30223	30189	30189	Jim	181	" She will be going up and down upon the mountains like another unfortunate fair one . But your father ? He will be at home , will he not ? "
30224	30233	30235	30235	Amelia	201	" Yes , he will be at home , "
30254	30301	30235	30235	Amelia	201	" but , as you know , it never answers to leave father and Sybilla alone together for long . You see , he does not believe that there is anything the matter with her ; he thinks that she is as well as you or I "
30322	30351	30352	30352	Jim	181	" and though he tries to prevent himself from showing it to her , yet I am afraid , poor dear , that he is not very successful . "
30355	30361	30363	30363	Amelia	201	" And to - day , "
30365	30401	30363	30363	Amelia	201	" he is naturally a good deal upset about Cecilia and that wedding - cake ; it was very impertinent to send it — was not it?—though she does not seem to see it . I hope"—with
30418	30426	30363	30363	Amelia	201	sleeve—"that when you throw me over — — "
30449	30458	30459	30459	he	181	" If we are going to talk nonsense , "
30476	30483	30459	30459	he	181	" I may as well go . "
30484	30491	30493	30493	she	201	" Go to the Piazza d'Azeglio , "
30541	30553	30554	30554	he	181	then—"Why do you wish me to go to the Piazza d'Azeglio ? "
30572	30580	30554	30554	he	181	" Why are you driving me there ? "
30581	30590	30591	30591	she	201	" Because I think you would like it , "
30594	30595	30591	30591	she	201	" because"—taking
30618	30635	30636	30636	He	181	it—"because all through your life I want you to have exactly what you like , always . "
30656	30662	30663	30663	he	181	" That is so likely , "
31259	31265	31266	31266	she	189	" How do you do ? "
31284	31291	31266	31266	she	189	" Are you fond of music ? "
31307	31321	31266	31266	she	189	" I hope so ! Did you ever hear such a shocking noise ? "
31322	31342	31344	31344	he	181	" I do not know which I admire most , the vocal or the instrumental part of the performance , "
31496	31503	31505	31506	the child	1006	" Oh , do go on ! "
31509	31526	31505	31506	the child	1006	" Oh , do make him do it again ! Oh , why do you stop ? "
31627	31638	31639	31639	she	193	" Bertie has come to spend the day with us , "
31730	31737	31738	31738	he	181	" Bertie is a new friend , "
31742	31749	31738	31738	he	181	" I do not know Bertie . "
31750	31775	31738	31738	he	181	" His mother , Mrs. Roche , is a cousin of ours ; she has a villa on Bellosguardo . Perhaps you know her ? "
31776	31789	31791	31791	Jim	181	" I am going to a party at her house on Wednesday , "
31819	31826	31827	31827	Elizabeth	193	" I shall meet you there ? "
31839	31842	31829	31829	her	193	" No ? "
31843	31850	31888	31890	Miss Le Marchant	240	" We are not going out . "
31904	31913	31914	31914	he	181	" Though Bertie is not an old friend , "
31919	31964	31914	31914	he	181	" yet I have come across one here to - day — she opened the door to me ; I should have liked to shake hands with her , only she looked so haughty — she never used to look haughty at the Moat . "
31965	31971	31972	31972	she	193	" Do you mean nurse ? "
31975	31994	31914	31914	he	181	" Yes , I knew her in an instant ; she is not in the least changed , less even"—hesitating
32010	32015	32016	32016	She	193	personality—"less even than you . "
32042	32050	32051	32051	she	193	" You must be laughing at me , "
32065	32072	32051	32051	she	193	" I am very much changed . "
32100	32110	32111	32111	he	181	" Of course I was only speaking of externals , "
32115	32137	32111	32111	he	181	" ten years could hardly be expected to leave any of us quite where we were as to our inner selves ; "
32175	32456	32151	32151	he	181	" Ere the words are out of his mouth she has risen with precipitation , and begun hurriedly to re - arrange the branches of lilac in a scaldino on the table near her . She is apparently so awkward about it that one odorous white bough falls out on the floor . Before Jim can stoop to pick it up , Byng has rushed to the rescue . In eagerly thanking him , in receiving it back from him , and accepting his services in replacing it among its perfumed brothers , the girl , perhaps involuntarily , turns her back upon her former interlocutor , who sits for a moment staring rather blankly at her , and wondering what sting there could have lurked in his apparently harmless words to drive her away so abruptly . Whatever may have driven her away , there is certainly no doubt as to her being gone . Nor as Jim sees her moving about the room , followed by Byng , and showing him her treasures — the little wild red and yellow tulips she plucked in the field this morning ; the chicken - skin box she bought at Ciampolini 's yesterday , and mixing all that she shows with her delicate light laughter — can he buoy himself up with any reasonable hope of her ever , with her own good will , returning . He must be looking more blank than he is conscious of , for Mrs. Le Marchant 's voice sounds quite apologetic in his ears , when , having been , like himself , deserted by her companion , she takes a seat near him . "
32465	32478	32479	32479	she	193	" she says , glancing with a lenient smile towards her daughter ; "
32486	32487	32488	32488	She	193	" "
32497	32522	32488	32488	She	193	" replies Jim , rather morosely ; then , becoming aware of the almost puerile jealousy evidenced by his last remark , he adds : "
32572	32606	32607	32607	She	193	" The mother 's eye is still following her child , and , if it were not an absurd assumption , Burgoyne could have fancied that there was a sudden moisture in it . "
32612	32619	32607	32607	She	193	" Mrs. Le Marchant answers slowly ; "
32634	32635	32607	32607	She	193	" "
32642	32652	32654	32654	you	240	" rejoins Jim , with some ill - humour , "
32694	32708	32710	32711	the Moat	8	" ( striking the forefinger of his left hand with the right ) , "
32713	32726	32710	32711	the Moat	8	" He pauses , as if expecting a disclaimer , but none such comes—"The
32729	32750	32751	32751	Yourselves	1018	" ( moving on to the second finger and again halting ; but with no more result than before ) . "
32752	32792	32794	32794	your	1018	" ( reaching the third finger ) . Still that silence , which , if it mean anything , must mean assent . He looks impatiently in her face , to seek the response which her lips refuse him . "
32798	32810	32794	32794	your	1018	" she says gently , though in a rather troubled voice , "
32833	32843	32845	32845	I	0	" His brows draw together into a painful frown . "
32862	32929	32845	32845	I	0	" It is a random shot , a bow drawn at a venture ; but it could not have hit more true apparently had it been levelled with the nicest aim . As her daughter had done before her , Mrs. Le Marchant rises hastily , and leaves him — leaves him to reflect ironically upon how wisely Amelia had acted in insisting upon his visiting these "
32934	32947	32845	32845	I	0	" upon whom the effect of his conversation is so obviously exhilarating . "
32964	33197	33198	33198	He	1020	" The small fractious voice that wails the two preceding sentences seems to be Jim 's own mouthpiece . It is , in point of fact , the voice of Bertie , who , tired of uttering his unregarded request for the repetition of the concert which had filled him with such delight , has of late been trying the effect of his unassisted powers to bring about the desired consummation , by putting his arms as far as he can round the dog 's body , and endeavouring to lug him towards the music - stool . The collie has been enduring this treatment for five minutes — enduring it with an expression of magnanimous patience , which seems to say , that , though it is undoubtedly an unpleasant experience , yet , as it is inflicted upon him by one of his own family , he must of course put up with it , when Elizabeth goes to the rescue . Elizabeth goes alone , since Byng is held in converse by her mother at the other side of the room . Verbal persuasions having entirely failed , she tries to loosen the child 's arms ; but his grasp , though puny , is obstinate , and the only perceptible result of her endeavours is the utterance by her young friend of the two polite aspirations above recorded . "
33210	33220	33221	33221	you	1021	" Jim hears her saying in her gentle voice ; "
33251	33261	33262	33262	you	1021	" ( with a little accent of pain ) , "
33267	33378	33262	33262	you	1021	" Jim has been looking with a lack - lustre eye out of the open window at the young plane trees exchanging their frowsy buds for infant leaves ; at the one Judas tree pranking in its purple blossoms in the Piazza ; but at that low complaint he makes one step across the room , and , whipping off Master Bertie alike from long - enduring dog and plaintive woman , stoops over the latter as she sits upon the floor , passing one hand over the other , upon which the child 's angry fingers , transferred from his first victim , have left rosy prints of pain . "
33395	33401	33411	33411	I	0	" whimpers the little boy . "
33420	33428	33411	33411	I	0	" says Jim in a stiff voice ; "
33435	33483	33411	33411	I	0	" She looks up at him from her lowly posture , a charming , half - apologetic , wholly peace - making smile fleeting across her small face , while she still chafes her hand — that little pinched hand which makes him feel so ridiculously tender . "
33494	33605	33411	33411	I	0	" she asks . The question takes him by surprise . He is not prepared for so friendly and almost intimate a sequel to her short , shy answers , and her abrupt quitting of him . He hesitates how to answer it ; and as he hesitates , she rises and stands beside him . It is not easy for a grown person to rise gracefully from a seat on the floor . Jim catches himself thinking with what a roll and a flounder Cecilia would have executed the same manœuvre ; but Elizabeth , supple and light , rises as smoothly as an exhalation from a summer meadow . "
33615	33622	33411	33411	I	0	" she says , rather tremulously ; "
33669	33698	33724	33725	the signora	1027	" The two men are gone ; so is the child ; so is the dog ; and Elizabeth is shutting up the piano and removing the score . "
33705	33714	33724	33725	the signora	1027	" she says , smiling at the recollection . "
33734	33760	33727	33729	the other lodgers	1028	" Mrs. Le Marchant has followed her daughter , and now throws one arm about her slight neck , with a gesture of passionate affection . "
33765	33778	33762	33762	you	0	" she says , in a voice of deep and happy agitation , "
33795	33796	33797	33797	I	0	" "
33822	33849	33819	33819	you	0	" answers the younger woman , laying her sleek head down caressingly on her mother 's shoulder ; then , in a changed and restless voice : "
33872	33873	33865	33865	he	574	" "
33877	33886	33887	33887	Men	512	" replies Mrs. Le Marchant with a shrug . "
33928	33929	33926	33926	you	0	" "
33932	33939	33942	33942	he	574	" replies Elizabeth , with emphasis ; "
33962	33979	33961	33961	mammy	1029	" ( turning her face round , and burying it on her mother 's breast ) , "
33997	35620	35622	35622	you	1034	" A reconciliation is seldom effected without some price being paid for it . Jim 's with Elizabeth , if it can be called such , is bought at the cost of a small sacrifice of principle on his part . No later than this morning he had laid it down as a Median rule that he should avoid opportunities of finding himself in Miss Le Marchant 's company ; and yet , not only has he spent the major part of the afternoon in her society , but , as he walks away from her door , he finds that he has engaged himself to help Byng , on no distant day , in doing the honours of the Certosa Monastery to her and her mother . On reflection , he can not quite explain to himself how the arrangement has come about . The proposal certainly did not originate with him , and still less with the two ladies so strangely shy of all society . The three have somehow been swept into it by Byng , who , either with the noblest altruism , or because he feels justly confident that he has no cause for jealousy of his friend ( Jim 's cynical reflection is that the latter is the much more probable reason ) , has insisted on drawing him into the project . Jim Burgoyne is not a man whom , as a rule , it is easy either to wile or cudgel into any course that does not recommend itself to his own judgment or taste — a fact of which he himself is perfectly aware , and which makes him remorsefully acknowledge that there must indeed have been a traitor in the citadel of his own heart before he could have so weakly yielded at the first push to what his reason sincerely disapproves . But yet it is not true that remorse is the leading feature of his thoughts , as he walks silently beside his friend down the Via di Servi . It ought to be , perhaps ; but it is not . The picture that holds the foreground of his memory is that of Elizabeth sitting on the floor , and sending him peace - offerings from her pathetic eyes and across her sensitive lips . It was very sweet of her to think it necessary to make him amends at all for her trifling incivility , and nothing could be sweeter than the manner of it . How gladly would he buy some little rudeness from her every day at such a price ! But yet , as he thinks it over , the manner of it , the ground on which she rested her excuse , is surely a strange one . That she should attribute her light lapse from courtesy to want of knowledge of the world comes strangely from the mouth of a woman of six - and - twenty . If it be true — and there was a naïve veracity in lip and eye as she spoke — how is it to be accounted for ? Has her mind , has her experience of life , remained absolutely stationary during the last ten years ? Her tell - tale face , over which some pensive story is so plainly written , forbids the inference . It is no business of his , of course . Amelia , thank Heaven ! has no story ; but , oh ! if someone would tell him what that history is ! And yet , three days later , he voluntarily puts away from himself the opportunity of hearing it . During those three days he sees no more of her . He does not again seek her out , and accident does not throw her in his way . He buys his Cantagalli dinner - service in company with Amelia ; chooses the soup - tureen out of which he is to ladle mutton broth for the inhabitants of Westbourne Grove ; he tastes of the wedding - cake that has cost Cecilia so dear , and he avoids Byng . On the third day he can no longer avoid him , since he is to occupy , as on the San Miniato occasion , the fourth seat in the fiacre which conveys himself and the Misses Wilson to the garden - party at the villa in Bellosguardo inhabited by Mrs. Roche , the mother of the amiable Bertie . The Wilsons ' acquaintances in Florence are few , and , as far as Burgoyne has at present had the opportunity of judging , evil . It is , therefore , with a proportionate elation that Cecilia dresses for a party at which she will meet the bulk , or at least the cream , of the English society . It is to Byng 's good nature that she and her sister owe the introduction to a hostess whose acquaintance is already too large to make her eager for any causeless addition to it ; but whose hand has been forced by Byng , in the mistaken idea that he is doing a service to his friend Jim . They are late in setting off , as Amelia is delayed by the necessity of soothing Sybilla , who has been reduced to bitter tears by a tête - à - tête with her father , in which that well - intentioned but incautious gentleman has been betrayed into suggesting to her that she may possibly be suffering from biliousness . The administering of bromide , to calm her nerves under such a shock ; the reiterated assurances that every member of the family except its head realizes the monstrosity of the suggestion , take up so much time that Amelia herself has to reduce to a minimum the moments allotted to her own toilette . She has cried a little with Sybilla , for company partly , and partly out of weariness of spirit . That and hurry have swollen her eyelids , and painted her cheeks with a hard , tired red , so that it is an even more homespun figure and a homelier face than usual , that seat themselves opposite Burgoyne , when at length they get under weigh . He , Burgoyne , has been impatient of the delay , impatient to set off and to arrive ; yet he would be puzzled to say why . He knows , on no less authority than her own word , that he shall not meet Elizabeth ; and yet the mere feeling that the mistress of the house to which he is going is of the same blood as she ; that he shall see the rude , spoilt child , whose ill - tempered pinch made her utter that low cry of pain , suffice to give a tartness to his tone , as he inquires the cause of her lagging , of the panting , flushed , apologetic Amelia . Byng and Cecilia have been sitting waiting for some time in the salon , from which Sybilla has removed her prostrate figure and tear - stained face ; but they have been entertaining each other so well — she in paying him a series of marked attentions , and he in civilly and pleasantly accepting them — that the half - hour has not seemed long to either . But the party , in motion at last , has passed the Roman Gate , and is climbing up and up between the high walls , each step giving it a greater vantage ground over the Flower City , before Burgoyne recovers his equanimity . The spring comes on apace . In the gardens above their heads laurestinus bushes , with all their flowers out ( as they are never seen in England , where always the east wind nips half the little round buds before they can expand into blossom ) , stand in white and green ; rosemary trees , covered with gray bloom , hang down ; and against the azure of the high heaven purple irides stand up arow . It is one of those days on which one can with bodily eyes see the Great Mother at her quickening work ; can see her flushing the apple - boughs , unfolding the fig - leaves , and driving the lusty green blood through the sappy vines . And in the slow creeping of the fiacre up the twisting white road , each turn lays the divine Tuscan city before them in some new aspect of arresting loveliness . At Florence , one is like Balaam with the Israelites . One is taken to see her from one point after another , each point seeming fairer than the last ; but the likeness ends there , for no wish to curse the sweet town could ever arise in even the morosest heart . The hills have put on their summer look of dreamy warmth and distance . Before they have reached the hilltop the boon Italian air has kissed most of the creases out of Jim 's temper , and the brick - red from Amelia 's cheek - bones . He looks remorsefully from the triumphant beauty around , into the poor , fond face opposite to him — looks at her with a sort of compassion for being so unlovely , mixed with a compunctious admiration and tenderness for her gentle qualities . He may touch her hand without fear of observation , so wholly is Byng enveloped in the mantle of Cecilia 's voluble tenderness . "
35626	35632	35622	35622	you	1034	" he asks , smiling ; "
35655	35726	35650	35650	Sybilla	221	" They have reached the villa , and turned out of the dusty highway into a great cool courtyard , that has a Moorish look , with its high arches , over which the Banksia roses tumble in cascades of yellow and white . It seems wrong that the voices which come from the tea - tables under the Loggia should be chattering English or Yankee , instead of cooing that "
35730	36459	35650	35650	Sybilla	221	" that better suits place and day . The hostess shakes hands absently with Burgoyne , offers his fair charges iced coffee , and then , having discharged her conscience towards them , draws Byng away for an intimate chat . From her hands he passes into those of several other willing matrons and maids , and it seems likely that the party who brought him will see him no more . Amelia , unused to , and unexpectant of attention , is perfectly content to sit silent , sipping her cold coffee ; but Cecilia is champing her bit in a way which frightens her future brother - in - law so much that he cowardly takes the opportunity of her looking in another direction to lure his docile fiancée on to the broad terrace , whence all the young green glory of the Arno 's plain , and the empurpled slopes and dreamful breast of Morello , are to be seen by the looker 's beauty - drunk eye . Upon this terrace many people are walking and sitting in twos and threes , and in one of the little groups Amelia presently discovers a female acquaintance , who at once fastens upon her , and happening to be afflicted with a relative visited by a disorder of something the same nature as Sybilla 's , subjects her to a searching and exhaustive catechism as to the nature of her sister 's symptoms . Sybilla 's symptoms , whether at first or second hand , have invariably the property of driving Jim into desert places ; and , in the present instance , seeing no likelihood of an end to the relation of them , he turns impatiently away , and , without much thought of where he is going , follows a steep downward path that ends in a descent of old stone steps , between whose crevices green plants and little hawkweed blow - balls flourish undisturbed , to a large square well , framed by a low broad parapet , with flower - beds set around it , and the whole closed in by rugged stone walls . No one apparently has had the same impulse as he , for , at first , he has the cool solitude to himself . He sits down on the parapet of the still well , and drops in pebbles to see how deep the water is ; and anon lifts his idle look to the empty niches in the crumbling wall — niches where once wood - god , or water - nymph , or rural Pan stood in stone , now empty and forsaken . Out of the wall two ilexes grow , and lift themselves against the sapphire arch , which yet is no sapphire , nor of any name that belongs to cold stone ; a blue by which all other blues are but feeble colourless ghosts of that divinest tint . He is roused from the vague reverie into which the cool silence and the brooding beauty around have lulled him , by the sound of approaching voices . He is not to have his well any longer to himself . He looks up with that scarcely latent hostility in his eye with which one regards the sudden intruder into a railway carriage , when — counting on keeping it to one 's self for a long night journey — one has diffused limbs and parcels over its whole area . The owners of the voices , having descended , as he had done , the age - worn steps , come into sight . They are both men , and one of them he recognises at once as a Mr. Greenock , a well - known stock figure in Florentine society , a mature bachelor diner - out , a not ill - natured retailer of news , collector of bons - mots , and harmless appendage of pretty women . Of the other , at whom he scarcely glances , all he grasps is the fact that he is dressed in clerical attire , and that the first words audible of his speech , as he comes within hearing , is the name of an English county — Devonshire . The answer comes in a tone of keen interest : "
36471	36548	36462	36462	I	0	" As the new arrivals become aware of the presence of a third person , they pause in their talk ; but presently , Mr. Greenock having recognised Jim and greeted him with a friendly nod and a trivial remark upon the splendour of the day , they resume their interrupted theme , standing together a few yards distant from him on the walk — resume it in a rather lower but still perfectly audible key . "
36564	36585	36549	36549	I	0	" continues Mr. Greenock in the gratified tone of one who has at length solved a long - puzzling riddle . "
36607	36617	36601	36601	you	0	" The other gives a sigh and a shrug . "
36646	36647	36549	36549	I	0	" "
36650	36651	36549	36549	I	0	" "
36656	36657	36549	36549	I	0	" "
36661	36836	36549	36549	I	0	" Burgoyne is still sitting on the well - brim ; but he no longer sees the lapis vault above , nor the placid dark water below . A sort of horrible mist is swimming before his eyes ; it is of Elizabeth Le Marchant that they are speaking . Through that mist he snatches a scared look at the speaker ; at him whom but two minutes ago he had glanced at with such a cursory carelessness . Does he recognise him ? Alas ! yes . Though changed by the acquisition of a bald head and a grizzled beard , he sees him at once to be the man who , at the time of his own acquaintance with the Le Marchant family , had filled the office of vicar of their parish ; under whom he had sat on several drowsy summer Sunday mornings , trembling at the boys ' perilous antics in the great curtained pew , and laughing inwardly at Elizabeth 's mirth - struggling efforts to control them . "
36850	36872	36838	36838	you	1037	" pursues Mr. Greenock in a tone of good - natured compassion , that is yet largely tinged with gratified curiosity . "
36880	36885	36873	36873	They	1038	" returns the clergyman . "
36924	36929	36951	36951	you	1037	but"—lowering his voice a little more—"you
36947	36948	36951	36951	you	1037	" "
36958	36969	36951	36951	you	1037	" cries Mr. Greenock in a burst of generous indignation ; "
36970	36978	36951	36951	you	1037	but"—stepping a pace or two nearer to his interlocutor—"I
37005	37201	36995	36995	you	1037	" Jim has been sitting in such a stunned stillness that it is perhaps no wonder that they have forgotten his neighbourhood . At all events , the clergyman is evidently about to comply with his companion 's request and recapitulate the tale . If Jim preserves his motionless attitude but five minutes longer , he will be put into possession of that story whose existence he has already heavily conjectured , and the imagining of which has made him often , within the last week or two , turn with nausea from his food , and toss restlessly upon his bed . Without any trouble on his part , without any possible blame attaching to him , he will learn the poor soul 's secret . Never ! If the devil wish to tempt him with a prospect of success , it must be with a less unhandsome bait . Almost before the two startled scandalmongers have recalled the fact of his existence by the abrupt noise of his departure , he is half - way back to the terrace , that mist still before his eyes , and a singing in his ears . "
37224	37608	37609	37609	I	0	" The return drive , as it is quicker , being all downhill , so is it a more silent one than that to the villa had been . Byng , indeed , is as gaily willing to be fondled by Cecilia as he was on his way up ; but there is a mixture of maidenly reserve and sub - tender reproach in her manner which makes their relations somewhat strained . The afternoon 's pleasuring has had a jading effect upon Amelia 's spirits , as , after having been sucked dry on the subject of Sybilla 's maladies , and afterwards at once shaken off , by her female acquaintance , she has not been fortunate enough to meet with anyone else to exchange talk with , and has sat in disconsolate yet patient loneliness on a stone bench , afraid to stir from the spot where he had left her , lest she might miss her lover , of whom , however , she has unaccountably seen nothing , until when the Angelus is ringing , and the shadows spreading , he has come to give her curt notice , with half - averted face , that the fiacre is at the door . In point of fact , he has been too conscious of the disorder of his features to dare to expose them sooner than he can help to her fond scrutiny . He would give anything to be able to sit beside , instead of opposite to her during their drive home , as a profile is a much less tell - tale and more governable thing than a full face ; and he is painfully conscious that as often as she imagines she can do it without being detected by him , she is stealing looks of inquiring anxiety at him . He tries to put her off the scent by spasmodic comments upon the entertainment that they have just quitted ; and she does her best to keep up the ball of conversation , since she sees that it is his wish . But in vain . Each forced remark falls still - born , leading to nothing . It is Cecilia who at last succeeds in giving a fillip to the languid talk . "
37627	37649	37652	37652	you	1045	" she says suddenly , growing tired of her pensive attitude , and addressing herself to Jim . He starts guiltily . "
37654	37678	37652	37652	you	1045	" He must look odd ; for even Cecilia 's large and preoccupied cow eyes rest upon him with an expression of surprise . "
37690	37726	37682	37682	she	252	" It is not exactly a question , yet her great shallow orbs do not seem to be going to leave his face until he makes some response . He forces himself to do so . "
37743	37744	37729	37731	Miss Le Marchant	240	" "
37753	37782	37729	37731	Miss Le Marchant	240	" inquires Cecilia , in an injured voice , as if the retirement from the world of the two ladies in question were a personal injury to herself ; "
37811	37822	37826	37826	they	1046	" ( after a moment 's thoughtful attempt to find a solution)—"perhaps
37849	38058	38442	38442	you	201	" At this ingenious suggestion Jim is conscious of a writhing motion passing over the stalwart form of Byng beside him . In his own brain , if there is room for anything but the desire to evade Amelia 's eyes , is a dim sense of relief at a suggestion so grotesquely wide of the mark as that made by the younger Miss Wilson . In perfect innocence of the effect produced upon her companions by her bright hypothesis , Cecilia goes on to remind her sister of the parallel case of a very handsome girl whom they had once reckoned among their acquaintance , and who was periodically being found by her family with her head under the fender . But Amelia rises but faintly to the reminiscence , and the remainder of the drive is accomplished in a general silence . The next day is the one which had been fixed upon for the expedition to Certosa . It was only with a very large admixture of wormwood in his prospective pleasure that Jim had ever looked forward to this party , but now he anticipates it with absolute dread . How can he face Elizabeth and her mother , with that ominous phrase of the "
38061	38421	38422	38422	Amelia	201	" still ringing in his ears ? He feels a traitor towards them , in that he has , however unwillingly , overheard it . To add to his mental uneasiness is the fact of his having as yet not broken to Amelia his intentions with regard to the disposal of his afternoon . Amelia 's eyes have for years had the habit of covertly watching him to read his wishes almost before they rose ; but in their gaze yesterday he had , unless misled by his guilty conscience , detected a new quality , a quality of alarm and enlightenment . He will get over the communication of his piece of news as early in the day as may be ; so , having finished breakfast before Byng has put in his , as usual , tardy appearance , he takes his hasty way to the Anglo - Américain . He finds the family there in a more placid frame of mind than that which they had presented on one or two of his recent visits . Sybilla is expecting her doctor , on which occasions she always likes to have a more lacy coverlet than usual thrown over her languid feet ; a greater efflorescence of pink ribbons about her thin throat , and a disposition of pots of lilies about her wan head . Amelia , active and long - suffering as usual , is moving about in patient execution of her vain and tiresome whimsies . Cecilia sits tranquilly in the window , knitting an elaborate pair of men 's woollen gloves , not indeed — to do her justice — for anyone in particular , but with a wise forethought for the accidents and possibilities of life . Since , on this occasion , his sweetheart shows no inclination to draw him away into the dining - room for a tête - à - tête , Jim has to take the bull by the horns , and rush into his subject in a more public manner than he had intended . But the one desire to get it over outbalances all minor considerations . "
38424	38440	38422	38422	Amelia	201	" he begins suddenly , and even to himself his voice sounds discourteous and abrupt , "
38448	38501	38442	38442	you	201	" The moment that the words are out of his mouth it strikes him that the form into which he has thrown his question is more than necessarily untender . She stops in the patting of Sybilla 's smart pillows , and perhaps there is something a little abrupt too in her monosyllabic "
38504	38505	38442	38442	you	201	" "
38508	38530	38534	38534	you	201	" standing before the fireplace , with his back to the three women , and throwing the words over his shoulder , "
38548	38583	38540	38540	I	0	" There is a pause . He hears that Cecilia 's needles have stopped clicking ; her work has dropped into her lap . In another moment she will have proposed to come too . "
38589	38602	38585	38587	the Le Marchants	261	" he goes on , shooting out the fateful words like bullets ; "
38607	38695	38585	38587	the Le Marchants	261	" Still silence behind him . He can not go on staring for ever at the billets of wood of the unlit fire . He has to turn round and face his companions . The only one of them whose pleasure or displeasure in his announcement he at all heeds — Amelia — is stooping over Sybilla , rearranging in a high , picturesque tier behind the invalid 's long back , three cushions , and her face is almost entirely hidden from him by her attitude . "
38725	38739	38721	38721	you	1049	" he continues in a tone that is at once apologetic and dogged . "
38745	38776	38777	38777	You	1049	" cries she , answering at last , and with a distinct laugh in her voice , a laugh into whose quality he is not anxious too curiously to inquire . "
38896	38902	38880	38881	Poor father	1053	" ( laughing again ) , "
38913	39017	38880	38881	Poor father	1053	" There is such a forced mirth in her tone that Jim feels much more guiltily uncomfortable than if she had treated him to hysterics or sulks . Nor does his satisfaction with himself increase , when , upon his rising to depart , she runs out of the room after him , to say to him , while her homely face twitches against her will , how much she hopes that he will enjoy himself ; how perfectly happy she shall be without him ; and how eagerly she shall look forward to hearing all about it from him to - morrow . "
39029	39087	39027	39027	herself	65	" she ends . But against the unnatural altitude of this last flight of abnegation nature revolts , and , becoming conscious of a break in her voice , she hastily retreats and gets back into the salon , in time to see Cecilia shaking her elaborate head , and to hear her remarking with slow emphasis , "
39106	39171	39172	39172	I	0	" With spirits sensibly worsened by his interview , Burgoyne returns to the Minerva , and , mounting to Byng 's bedroom , finds that young gentleman stretched upon his bed , gloom in his usually jocund eye , and an open letter lying on the floor beside him . But Jim is far too preoccupied to notice anybody 's gloom but his own . "
39187	39200	39201	39201	We	1058	" he says with a sort of flat moroseness in his tone . "
39205	39237	39201	39201	We	1058	" rejoins the other with a groan , and rolling over with a sort of petulance on the bed , dishevelling the neatly - smoothed pillow by burrowing his ruffled head in it—"we
39239	39280	39357	39357	you	1059	" There is such a heart - rent woe in the accent with which the last monosyllable is pronounced that for a moment Burgoyne has no other idea but that his young friend , too , has become aware of the "
39284	39329	39330	39330	We	1058	" has heard , perhaps in detail , that story from before whose ominous opening he himself had fled . The thought sends his heart into his throat , so as to render him incapable of asking an explanation of the other 's affliction . "
39332	39354	39330	39330	We	1058	" repeats Byng for the third time , and very indistinctly , as he is now lying entirely on his face . "
39369	39448	39357	39357	you	1059	" asks Jim at last , recovering his voice — recovering it only to employ it in imitating the younger man 's accents , in a manner which displays more exasperation than natural talent for mimicry . It is not a politely - worded inquiry , but it has the desired result of acting as a tonic on him at whom it is aimed , making him not only roll over once again , but actually sit up . "
39455	39472	39451	39451	I	0	" repeats he , his young eyes looking lamentably out from under the fall of his tumbled hair—"because
39494	39543	39482	39482	You	1059	" Jim heaves an inaudible sigh of relief . Whatever may be the cause of his companion 's enigmatical conduct , it is evidently not what he had feared . There is , however , no evidence of relief or any other mild quality in his next remark . "
39567	39589	39590	39590	You	1059	" The query seems only to renew and deepen the other 's tribulation . He falls back into his former attitude . "
39602	39606	39590	39590	You	1059	" he groans . "
39612	39659	39590	39590	You	1059	" ( with a sudden and startling change of tone , springing off the bed , as he becomes aware that his friend is making for the door , unable to bear those rhapsodies , whose full distastefulness to their hearer the utterer little conjectures ) . "
39711	39730	39703	39703	She	1063	" Jim 's fingers are already on the door handle , but this piece of news arrests him . "
39744	39745	39749	39749	I	0	" "
39751	39752	39749	39749	I	0	" "
39762	39763	39749	39749	I	0	" "
39766	39767	39749	39749	I	0	" "
39775	39776	39749	39749	I	0	" "
39779	39805	39806	39806	She	1063	" There is so ludicrous a discrepancy between the adjective and the accent with which it is rendered that Jim bursts into a bitter laugh . "
39823	39848	39811	39811	she	1063	" Byng 's blood rushes up under his clear smooth skin at his friend 's jeer , but he answers , with some dignity : "
39898	39943	39944	39944	I	0	" Jim feels ashamed of himself , though , being an Anglo - Saxon , he has far too much false shame to confess it directly , and what he means for an amende , when it comes , is of an oblique nature . "
39971	39998	39963	39963	I	0	" The indignant red has rapidly died out of Byng 's face ; his placability being only to be surpassed by his slowness to take offence . "
40003	40034	40039	40039	you	1067	" he asks in a tone of stupefaction ; then , with a sudden tardy recollection of the rosy fetters in which his friend is held by another lady , he adds—"But
40047	40051	40043	40043	I	0	" Jim winces . "
40072	40073	40058	40058	you	1067	" "
40085	40090	40058	40058	you	1067	" cries Byng eagerly . "
40132	40133	40123	40123	you	1067	" "
40139	40146	40123	40123	you	1067	" inquires the older man carpingly . "
40167	40168	40123	40123	you	1067	" "
40173	40223	40123	40123	you	1067	" begins Byng in a rapt voice ; but apparently the sight of his companion , who has somewhat ostentatiously pulled out a note - book and pencil , and assumed the patient air of one about to write to dictation , dries the stream of his young eloquence ; "
40229	40452	40123	40123	you	1067	" replies Jim , leaving the room with this quotation on his lips , rather hastily , for fear lest the other should change his mind . It is five o'clock , the hour fixed for the expedition to Certosa , and in the entresol of 12 bis , Piazza d'Azeglio , Mrs. and Miss Le Marchant are sitting — hatted , gloved , and en - tout - cas - ed — in expectation of the arrival of their double escort . Elizabeth 's afternoon has , so far , not been a lazy one , as her little cousin Bertie and his dog have again been good enough to pay her a lengthy visit , and the former has insisted upon a repetition of the musical performance of the other day , though with truncated rites . Without the powerful aid of Byng , Elizabeth has found it a task considerably beyond her strength to hold a large collie , poised on his hind - legs , on a music - stool . He has jumped down repeatedly , and now lies on his back — an attitude in which experience has taught him he is less attackable than in any other — sawing the air with his fore - paws , and lifting his lip in a deprecating grin . "
40458	40476	40455	40456	Mr. Byng	251	" cries Bertie fretfully , baulked in his efforts to make his wily victim resume the perpendicular . "
40489	40490	40485	40486	Mr. Byng	251	" "
40499	40537	40493	40493	you	1074	" suggests Mrs. Le Marchant , in that patiently coaxing voice in which we are wo nt to address a tiresome child on a visit , instead of the buffet which we should bestow upon it were it resident—"perhaps
40560	40616	40619	40619	him	251	" The suggestion is at once accepted , and the child , balancing his fidgety body on a chair , and craning his neck over the window - ledge , is shouting shrill pieces of information as to the passers - by to his friends within the room . Presently he shrieks out in triumph : "
40634	40652	40655	40655	he	251	No!"—a moment later , with a changed and disgusted note , as a nearer view corrects the first impression—"it
40666	40667	40789	40791	the other one	1076	" "
40673	40787	40789	40791	the other one	1076	" It is quite impossible that the sound of the child 's voice can reach down to the open portal of No . 12 bis , at which Jim has now arrived , and it is also certain that neither of the ladies whom he has come to visit is likely to word her surprise at his having arrived alone with the frank brutality which is confined to the utterances of infancy ; and yet Jim , as he presents himself , announced by Annunziata , the hard - featured possessor of a lovely name , is quite as conscious , as if he had overheard the boy 's slighting remark , of being "
40793	40811	40789	40791	the other one	1076	" Before he can begin his apologies , the eager little boy has run up to him . "
40833	40891	40828	40828	Elizabeth	193	" At this last clause Burgoyne is conscious of a dark , hot flush rising to his face , and , partly to hide it , partly to avoid seeing what the effect of his communication may be upon her for whom it is meant , he stoops over the child , addressing his answer to him : "
40908	40909	40828	40828	Elizabeth	193	" "
40920	40921	40917	40917	he	251	" "
40931	40945	40917	40917	he	251	" replies Jim , trying to speak in a light and playful voice ; "
40980	41000	40978	40978	he	251	" But to this fustian and copy - book generality the young gentleman addressed is too angry to reply . "
41023	41071	41009	41009	he	251	" says Jim , turning to the two ladies , and looking apologetically from one to the other . Elizabeth 's head is averted ; but on her mother 's features he sees , or fancies he sees , slight evidences of a feeling not unlike relief . "
41080	41085	40978	40978	he	251	" she says cheerfully ; "
41096	41184	41185	41185	You	1079	" Burgoyne 's heart sinks . In these last sentences he too surely traces signs of the evasive and would - be - retrograde nature which has all along characterized Mrs. Le Marchant 's relations with him . It has seemed to him that he has been looking forward to the expedition with sensations of almost unmixed dread , and yet , now that he seems to be going to be delivered from it , what he experiences certainly does not come under the head of elation . "
41193	41214	41185	41185	You	1079	" he asks , in a tone which he honestly tries to make as neutral and colourless as he can . "
41231	41296	41297	41297	I	0	" The person thus addressed lifts her head , and all over her features he , eagerly scanning them , sees written a warm acquiescence in her motherly decision , an acquiescence which , as her eyes meet his — his , in which his disappointment is written a good deal more plainly than he is aware — changes slowly and sweetly into indecision . "
41302	41319	41297	41297	I	0	" she answers , her gentle look clouded a little , and yet kindly interrogating his ; "
41364	41692	41354	41354	you	215	" To this proposition Bertie assents warmly , and begins thrasonically to recount to inattentive ears the high and singular deeds with which he will celebrate his arrival at maturity . But , as Mrs. Le Marchant puts a strenuous veto upon his adoption as escort , and as his nurse appears at the same juncture to fetch him , he and his dog are presently removed ; and the other three set off without him . Burgoyne has chartered a fiacre , with a horse as little lame as is ever to be found in Florence , and in this vehicle they are presently rolling along . None of them are in very exuberant spirits . Burgoyne is as well aware as if her sensitive lips had put the fact into words , that for Elizabeth the pleasure of the outing has evaporated with the absence of Byng , and that it is only the soft - hearted shrinking of a sweet nature from inflicting mortification on a fellow - creature that has set her opposite to him in her white gown . He has never seen her dressed in white before , and says to himself that it was for Byng 's sake that she has made herself so summer - fine . But even if it be so , it is not Byng who is profiting by it . It is for him , not Byng , that the large Italian light is glorifying its thin fabric . Lily - pure , snow - clean she looks , sitting under her sunshade ; and he sits over against her in a stupid silence . It seems to him as if his only safety were in silence , as if , did he speak at all , he must put into brutal words the brutal questions that are dinging in his head , that seem knocking for utterance against the gate of his set teeth . "
41725	41819	41712	41712	they	1085	" He looks , in a fierce perplexity , from one to the other of those delicately poised heads , held aloft with such modest dignity . Surely it is beyond the bounds of possibility that any heavily hideous shame or leaden disgrace can ever have weighed upon them ! Probably the intensity of his thought has given an intensity to his look , of which he is unaware ; for he presently finds the soft veiled voice of Elizabeth — Elizabeth who has hitherto been as mute as himself — addressing him : "
41834	41928	41826	41826	I	0	" The question , striking in so strangely pat , brings him back with a start . For a second an almost overpowering temptation assails him to tell her what is the object of his thought , to answer her with that whole and naked truth which we can so seldom employ in our intercourse with our fellow - men . But one glance at her innocent face , which has a vague trouble in it , chases the lunatic impulse , though he dallies with the temptation to the extent of saying : "
41945	41967	41937	41937	you	0	" He looks at her penetratingly as he puts the question . Before either his eyes or his manner she shrinks . "
41974	41981	41937	41937	you	0	" she cries with tremulous haste , "
42023	42330	42333	42333	he	1088	" He relapses into silence ; but her words , and still more the agitated manner in which they are pronounced , make a vague yet definite addition to the disquiet of his soul . By setting off at so judiciously late an hour as five o'clock , they have avoided the greater part of the flood of tourists which daily sets towards Certosa , and which they meet , tightly packed in crowded vehicles , sweeping Florence - wards in a choking cloud of white dust ; so that on reaching the Certosa Monastery , sitting so grandly on its hilltop , they have the satisfaction of finding that it is temporarily all their own — all their own but for the few white - frocked figures and tonsured heads which an economico - democratic Government has left to hint what in its palmy days was the state of that which is now only a Government museum . A burly monk receives them . He does not look at all a prey to the pensive sorrow one would expect at the desecration of his holy things and the dispersion of his fraternity . Probably , in his slow peasant mind there is room for nothing but self - congratulation at his being one of the few — only fifteen in all — left to end their days in the old home . He leads them stolidly through chapels and refectory — the now too roomy refectory , where the poor remnant of Carthusians dine together only on Sundays — through meagrely furnished cells , in one of which he matter - of - factly lets down the front flap of a cupboard to show what forms his daily dining - table except on the happy Sunday , to which he must look forward so warmly . "
42337	42345	42333	42333	he	1088	" cries Elizabeth , with sparkling eyes . "
42369	42477	42361	42361	you	1088	" Elizabeth 's spirits are going up like quicksilver . It is evident , despite the delicate melancholy of her face , that she is naturally of an extremely joyous and enjoying nature , and gifted with a freshness of sensation which belongs ordinarily rather to the green age at which Jim first remembers her , than to the mature one which he knows for a certainty that she has now reached . She is filled with such a lively and surprised delight at all the little details of arrangement of the monastic life that he is at last impelled to say to her , something wonderingly : "
42488	42489	42479	42479	you	1088	" "
42493	42494	42479	42479	you	1088	" "
42510	42511	42512	42512	I	0	" "
42523	42524	42516	42516	I	0	" "
42528	42554	42516	42516	I	0	" She lifts up her hand , and waves it at him with an air of hasty deprecation of further question , growing suddenly grave . "
42585	42917	42576	42576	I	0	" Her desire for a cessation of all inquiries as to her doings is obviously so earnest that Jim of course complies with it . Once or twice before he has been struck by her strange want of acquaintance with facts and phenomena , which would have come as a matter of course within the range of observation of every woman of her age and station . Against his will , a horrid recollection flashes upon him of a novel he had once read , in which the hero exhibits a singular ignorance of any events or incidents that had occurred within the ten years preceding the opening of the story — an ignorance which towards the end of the third volume was accounted for by its transpiring that he has spent the intervening period in a convict prison ! He drives the grotesque and monstrous idea with scourges out of his mind ; but it recurs , and recurs to be displaced by another hardly less painful , if in some degree more probable . Can it be possible that the crushing blow which has fallen upon the Le Marchant family , and upon Elizabeth in particular , whitening the mother 's hair , and giving that tear - washed look to the daughter 's sweet eyes — can it be possible that that heavy stroke was insanity ? Can Elizabeth have been out of her mind ? Can she have spent in confinement any of that past , from all allusion to which she shies away with a sensitiveness more shrinking than that of He is so much absorbed in his tormenting speculations about her that for the moment he forgets her bodily presence ; and it is only her voice , her soft sane voice , that brings him back to a consciousness of it . They have been led into a salon , in which , as their guide tells them , the confraternity used to receive any "
42919	43057	42576	42576	I	0	" that came to visit them . Alas , no personage ever visits the poor frocked remnant now ! It is a charming lightsome room , that gives one no monastic idea , with pretty airy fancies of flower - wreaths and arabesques , and dainty dancing figures painted on wall and ceiling and doors . One of these latter is half open , and through it comes an exquisite sudden view of the hills , with their sharp - cut shadows and their sunlit slopes ; of shining Florence at their feet , of the laugh of young verdure , and the wedded gloom and glory of cypress and poplar filling the foreground . Upon Elizabeth 's small face , turned suddenly towards him , seems reflected some of the ineffable radiance of the Tuscan light . "
43065	43076	43060	43060	I	0	" she says , in her tender , vibrating voice , "
43105	43110	43084	43084	you	1093	but"—with a joyful change of key—"I
43135	43207	43124	43124	I	0	" He looks back at her , hardly hearing her words , but chiding himself fiercely for the disloyal thought which he has entertained , however unwillingly ; the thought that the foul fiend of madness could ever , even temporarily , have defiled the temple of those eyes whence reason and feeling , so sweetly wedded , are shining out upon him , unworthy as he is of their rays . "
43213	43223	43124	43124	I	0	" he repeats in a sort of dreamy interrogation ; "
43230	43231	43232	43232	You	1097	" "
43241	43261	43232	43232	You	1097	" she cries in a voice of playful remonstrance , in which there is a lilt of young gaiety . "
43298	43567	43288	43288	I	0	" Presently they pass into the still , cloistered garden , in whose unmown grass - squares gray - blue flowers are blowing , beside whose walks pale pink peonies are flushing , and round whose well the grave rosemary bushes are set . Through the whole place is an atmosphere of deep peace , of silence , leisure , dignity . It is virtually a tête - à - tête , as their tonsured guide , seeing their evident harmlessness , has left them to their own devices ; and Mrs. Le Marchant has sat down to rest upon a camp - stool which Elizabeth has been carrying ever since they left the carriage . It has fidgeted Jim to see her burdened with it ; for let a man be ever so little in love with a woman , his tendency always is to think her as brittle as spun glass , to believe that any weight , however light , will bruise her arm — any pebble , however tiny , wound her tender foot . He has offered to relieve her of it , but she has refused — playfully at first — telling him she is sure that he will lose it ; and afterwards , when he insists , more gravely , though with gentle gratitude , saying that it would never do for her to get into the habit of being waited upon , and that she always carries mammy 's things . It is perhaps absurd that a woman of six - and - twenty should speak of her mother as "
43570	43582	43288	43288	I	0	" yet the homely and childish abbreviation seems to him to come "
43587	43666	43288	43288	I	0	" from her lips . They stay a long time in the sun - kissed garden , considering that there is after all not very much to see there . But Elizabeth 's light steps , that to - day seem set to some innocent dancing - tune , are loath to leave it ; she must smell the great new peonies , monthly - rose - coloured , faintly perfumed ; she must steal a sprig of rosemary "
43676	44167	43288	43288	I	0	" at which he catches his breath , shuddering ; she must peep into the well . He insists on her holding his hand for safety as she leans over to do so ; her little fingers grip his tight as she cranes her neck and bends her lissom body . But what a small handful they are , compared to those other fingers — those kind , useful , but undoubtedly solid fingers — which he has held perfunctorily through many a matter - of - fact hour . By - and - by they stray away together out of the bounteous air of the hilltop into a semi - underground church , to see the fifteenth and sixteenth century monuments , which look as fresh as if their marble had left its home in Carrara but yesterday . They stand looking down at those three kin who lie side by side before the high altar , each with head dropped a little sideways on the shoulder , as if overcome by sudden sleep . They step on into the side chapel , where that yet nobler mitred figure , fashioned by Donatello 's hand , stretches his prone length above his border of fruit and flowers , among which lies a carved skull , through whose empty eye - holes — strange and grisly fancy contrasting with so much beauty — a mocking ribbon runs . Elizabeth is perfectly silent the whole time , but no flood of talk could make Jim half so conscious of her presence , palpitating with sympathy and feeling , could give half the confidence he enjoys that she will introduce no allusion to either Kensal Green or Woking , as it is but too probable that the excellent companion of most of his Florentine rambles would have done . Elizabeth has been perfectly silent , yet at last she speaks . It is in the Chapter House , where , as most of us have done , they have suddenly come upon another tomb , the tomb of one lying full - length on the pavement before the altar , with no separating edge of marble or wrought - iron railing to keep him from the foot of the passer - by . He lies there , portrayed with such an extraordinary vividness of life about his prostrate figure and his severe , powerful face , that one feels inclined to speak low , lest he should lift his white lids and look rebuke at us . In the lines about his mouth there is a hint of sardonic mirth . Is he — hearing our foolish chatter — touched with a grave contemptuous amusement at it ? Or is he keeping in his sleep the memory of some four hundred years old jest ? Elizabeth has involuntarily crept close to Burgoyne 's side , with the gesture of a frightened child . "
44177	44245	44169	44169	you	1100	" she asks tremulously under her breath . Her next thought is that her mother must see him too , this wonderful living dead man , and they presently set forth to return to the garden to fetch her . But apparently she has grown tired of waiting for them , for , as they enter the cloistered enceinte , they see her advancing to meet them . "
44263	44275	44246	44246	I	0	" Elizabeth is saying , with a half - nervous laugh . "
44300	44305	44278	44278	mammy	1029	this?"—with a sudden change of key—"what
44309	44347	44278	44278	mammy	1029	" For as they draw near to Mrs. Le Marchant they see that her walk is a staggering one , and that the usually healthy , clear pallor of her face is exchanged for a livid whiteness . "
44354	44363	44278	44278	mammy	1029	" cries Elizabeth in an accent of terror . "
44374	44406	44366	44366	Jim	181	" In the agitation of the moment she has unconsciously returned to the familiar address which she used always to employ towards him in their boy - and - girl days . "
44435	44510	44425	44425	us	1105	" A camp - stool is neither an easy nor a luxurious seat upon which to deposit a half - swooning woman , but the joint exertions of her daughter and of Burgoyne presently succeed in replacing her on her rickety resting - place ; their arms interlace each other behind her back , and their anxious eyes look interrogation at one another above her head , half dropped on Elizabeth 's slight shoulder . "
44523	44531	44517	44517	she	0	" asks Jim , in a whisper . "
44536	44556	44517	44517	she	0	" replies the girl in a heart - rent voice , raining kisses on her mother 's white face . "
44569	44606	44517	44517	she	0	" Perhaps it is through the vivifying rain of those warm kisses , but a little colour is certainly beginning to steal back into the elder woman 's cheek , and she draws a long breath . "
44618	44631	44517	44517	she	0	" cries Elizabeth , greedily verifying these slight signs of returning consciousness . "
44653	45164	44517	44517	she	0	" Burgoyne complies , though it is not without reluctant misgivings that he withdraws the efficacious support of his own solid arm , and leaves Elizabeth 's poor little limb to bear the whole weight of her mother 's inert body . Their guide has , as before mentioned , disappeared ; and Jim has not the slightest idea in which direction to seek him . It is five good minutes before he discovers him , standing near the door of the monastery , in conversation with a visitor who is apparently just in the act of departure . The stranger is in clerical dress ; and , as he turns to nod farewell to the monk , Jim recognises in his features those of the Devonshire clergyman , whom he had last seen , and so unwillingly heard , by the well - brim of the Bellosguardo villa . In a second a light has flashed into his mind . Mrs. Le Marchant , too , has seen that stranger — has seen him for the first time for ten years , since it is evident that the recognition of mother and daughter in the Via Tornabuoni , to which the Moat 's late rector had referred , could not have been reciprocal . It is to the fact of her having been brought suddenly and unpreparedly face to face with that mysterious past , which seems to be always blocking his own path to her friendship , that is to be attributed the poor woman 's collapse . A rush of puzzled compassion flows over him as he realizes the fact , and his one impatient wish is to return with all the speed he may to the forlorn couple he has left , to reassure them as to the removal ( even though it may only be a temporary one ) out of their path of the object of their unexplained terror . Will the mother have imparted to her child the cause of her fainting , or will she have tried to keep it from her ? The first glimpse he gets when , having at length procured the desired glass of water , he comes into sight of them , answers the question for him . Mrs. Le Marchant is evidently partially recovered . She is sitting up , no longer supported by her daughter 's arm , and that daughter is lying on her knees , with her head buried in her mother 's lap . As he nears them , he sees the elder woman hurriedly pressing her daughter 's arm to warn her of his approach , and Elizabeth obediently lifts her face . But such a face ! He can scarcely believe it is the same that laid itself — hardly less bloomily fair than they — against the faint peony buds half an hour ago ; a face out of which the innocent glad shining has been blown by some gust of brutal wind — scared , blanched , miserable . "
45182	45206	45169	45169	I	0	" says Mrs. Le Marchant , pushing away the offered glass , and speaking with a ghastly shadow of her former even cheerfulness . "
45230	45307	45223	45223	I	0	" He silently holds out the water to Elizabeth , and she , without attempting to take the tumbler into her own trembling hand , drinks . He looks with impotent pity from the bent blonde head to the prematurely snow - white one . How can he word his reassurance to them without appearing to thrust himself with officious insolence into their confidence ? It seems to himself that he solves the problem very clumsily . "
45319	45350	45311	45311	you	193	" he says , feeling that he is dragging in the piece of information he is anxious to give them with an awkward head - and - shoulder - ness : "
45380	45400	45403	45404	a clergyman	3215	" He pauses , conscious that at the last word a tremulous shiver has passed over the kneeling figure . "
45406	45423	45403	45404	a clergyman	3215	" he goes on with nervous haste , hurrying to put them out of their pain ; "
45460	45562	45456	45456	him	1114	" Ere he has finished his sentence , he is seized by the apprehension that there must appear to his listeners something suspicious in the laboured details into which he is entering ; presupposing , as they do , that he is aware of there being for them an interest attaching to the fact of the stranger 's departure . And indeed , as he speaks , he is conscious that Mrs. Le Marchant 's frightened eyes , which have been taking surreptitious trips round the peaceful garden , now come home with a no less alarmed look to his face . "
45574	45583	45564	45564	he	1114	" she asks , with an attempt at a laugh—"this
45600	45601	45602	45603	An acquaintance	1117	" "
45605	45610	45613	45614	an acquaintance	1117	" repeats Jim doubtfully ; "
45651	45684	45648	45649	an acquaintance	1117	" Elizabeth 's hat has fallen on the ground , and hitherto she has seemed unconscious of the evening sunbeams smiting her uncovered head ; now she stoops and picks it up . "
45696	45712	45713	45713	You	1116	" continues Mrs. Le Marchant , still with that painful effort at lightness of tone . "
45749	45790	45791	45791	I	0	" Jim 's eyes are fixed on her as she speaks with a compassionate steadiness , under which hers quail waveringly . Is it possible that she can imagine that she is deceiving him by this miserable pretence of indifference ? "
45809	45814	45796	45796	I	0	" he answers gravely ; "
45844	45886	45818	45818	he	1114	" He had thought that Mrs. Le Marchant was already as colourless as a woman could be ; but as he speaks , he sees her face take on a new degree of pallor . She struggles unsteadily to her feet . "
45895	45900	45818	45818	he	1114	" she says indistinctly ; "
45911	45936	45818	45818	he	1114	" Even as she speaks she makes an uncertain step forward , but it is so uncertain that he catches her by the arm . "
45945	45952	46076	46076	you	1116	" he says with kind imperativeness ; "
45972	46074	46076	46076	you	1116	" Convinced , either by the young man 's eloquence , or , as is more likely , by the shaking of her own limbs , Mrs. Le Marchant sits down again . Elizabeth has risen to her feet , and now stands beside her mother . She has said nothing , but he can see her trembling from head to heel . He hears her voice now addressing him , but in so subdued a key that her words are almost lost in the low blowing of the faint south wind that is fondling the blades of the unshorn grass . "
46089	46090	46084	46084	you	1116	" "
46103	46104	46106	46106	you	1116	" "
46118	46119	46109	46109	you	1116	" "
46122	46125	46106	46106	you	1116	but"—with the greatest eagerness—"I
46136	46239	46240	46240	You	1125	" Elizabeth is standing quite close to him , so close that he can see her poor little heart leaping under the thin white gown , whose simple finery had piqued him earlier in the day . She has apparently , in her new terror , forgotten that there is any cause for concealing from him the occasion of it . She turns instinctively to him , as a hurt child to the nearest bystander . It seems to him the most natural thing in the world that she should . They are both recalled to themselves by her mother 's voice . "
46250	46258	46240	46240	You	1125	" she says with a sickly smile ; "
46297	46298	46278	46282	a comparative stranger like you	1127	" "
46307	46336	46337	46337	I	0	" cries Jim vehemently ; by this time — he does not know how — he is holding a hand of each of the trembling women in his . "
46368	46435	46362	46362	you	1131	" He glances with pitying , affectionate eagerness from one to other of the woebegone faces on either side of him . The tears have come in sudden flood to the elder woman , and are pouring over her white cheeks , stopping the passage of her voice ; but Elizabeth 's fair eyes are drearily dry , and speech comes clear and hopeless from her . "
46443	46469	46436	46436	You	0	" she says , giving the hand that holds hers a little pressure , which he feels to be as cold as it is grateful ; "
46494	46498	46499	46499	one	501	us"—with a slight despairing shrug—"no
46510	46517	46507	46507	God	214	sometimes"—drawing a long , half - sobbing breath—"I
46527	47147	47148	47148	You	1137	" There are few things more difficult than when one 's mind is full of the interests , cares , and sorrows of one set of friends , to have to empty it suddenly of them , and refill it as suddenly with the entirely different , and perhaps discrepant interests , cares , and sorrows of an altogether alien set . Seldom in the course of their old and tried friendship has Jim Burgoyne felt less disposed for the company and conversation of his valued ally , Mrs. Byng , than when he knocks at the door of her sitting - room on the morning following the excursion to Certosa . He can not talk to her about the Le Marchants , seeing that she has never even heard of their existence ; and if out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh , his talk upon any other topic must be scant and jejune indeed . The only cheerful side which his prospective visit turns to him is , that if he were not with Mrs. Byng , he would be with Amelia ; and that the friendlily indifferent eyes of the former will , at all events , be less likely than the hungrily loving ones of the latter to detect that he has not slept a wink , and that he has not the remotest idea what he is talking about . If he were to follow his inclination , he would be bestowing his company this morning upon neither friend nor sweetheart , but would be ransacking Florence for the piece of information he had yesterday promised those two woebegone women to procure for them . Even into the very midst of his heartfelt sore compassion for them , there pierces a shamed unwilling flash of elation at the thought of what a stride to intimacy his being entrusted with this commission implies , of what an opening to indefinitely numerous future visits it affords . His determination to conduct the search is at present a good deal more clearly defined than the method in which that search is to be effected . He can consult Galignani as to the names and whereabouts of new arrivals ; but they could do that much for themselves . He could examine the visitors ' books of the different hotels ; but Florence , though a little city , is rich in hostelries , and this course would take time . He could consult Mr. Greenock , the head and fount of all Florentine gossip , and who , since he had seen him in conversation with the object of his inquiries , would probably be able to satisfy them ; but his acquaintance with the good - natured newsmonger is not sufficiently intimate for him to be able to pay him a morning visit with any air of probability of having been impelled thereto by a desire for his company ; and , moreover , he shrinks with a morbid fear from any action which may lead , however obliquely , to his being himself apprised of the terrible secret which — it is no longer mere matter of conjecture — lies couched somewhere in those two poor creatures ' past . And meanwhile he knocks at Mrs. Byng 's door , and is quickly bidden enter by a cheerful English voice , the welcoming alacrity of whose tones shames his own want of pleasure in the meeting . But he is too unfortunately honest to express a joy he does not experience , and only says , with a slight accent of reproach as he takes her ready hand , heartily held out : "
47157	47164	47173	47173	you	1139	" She laughs a little guiltily . "
47183	47188	47175	47175	I	0	" He laughs too . "
47236	47275	47234	47234	you	1139	" His tone is , as he himself feels , not quite a pleasant one ; but the mother is scarcely more prone to take offence than the son ; and she answers with an amiably hasty disclaimer : "
47331	47332	47306	47306	you	1139	" "
47360	47361	47306	47306	you	1139	" "
47387	47409	47410	47410	I	0	" Jim 's only answer is to lift his hands and shoulders in protest against his friend 's weak - mindedness . "
47422	47433	47410	47410	I	0	" continues she , not much abashed by his scorn ; "
47506	47507	47544	47544	you	1139	" "
47516	47517	47544	47544	you	1139	" "
47521	47537	47544	47544	you	1139	Amelia?"—her cheerful eyes resting in friendly and half - inquisitive interest on his sombre face . "
47546	47547	47538	47538	Amelia	201	" "
47552	47553	47548	47549	Amelia Wilson	271	" "
47556	47557	47548	47549	Amelia Wilson	271	" "
47560	47567	47548	47549	Amelia Wilson	271	long?"—laughing—"another ten years , I suppose ? "
47568	47589	47548	47549	Amelia Wilson	271	" For three months , I believe ; we are to be married as soon as they return to England . "
47590	47595	47548	47549	Amelia Wilson	271	" You do not say so?"—with
47602	47631	47548	47549	Amelia Wilson	271	incredulity—"hurrah ! poor Amelia ! ' Tout vient à point à qui sait attendre ; ' and she has su attendre with a vengeance , has not she ? "
47632	47642	47644	47644	Jim	181	" She is not going to attendre any more , "
47647	47661	47663	47664	Mrs. Byng	203	" Then I shall have to give you a present , I suppose ! "
47672	47725	47726	47726	Jim	181	" Something useful , I have no doubt . I feel sure that Amelia would like something useful ; why should not we choose it to - day ? Florence is an ideal place for buying presents ; do you think that Amelia would spare you to me for a whole morning ? "
47797	47802	47804	47804	she	203	" Amelia will not ? "
47813	47842	47804	47804	she	203	" Well , I could not have believed it of her ! Not even if you told her that it is on purpose to buy her a present ? "
47850	47907	47843	47843	Jim	181	" How frightfully quickly your mind moves ! It leaps like a kangaroo ! I never said that she would not resign the precious boon of my society ; on the contrary , I am sure that nothing would give her greater pleasure , but — but — what will Willy say to my monopolizing you ? "
47967	47975	47976	47976	she	1148	" Willy has an engagement this morning , "
47992	48052	47976	47976	she	1148	" nothing could be sweeter and dearer than he was , and he is going to take me somewhere this afternoon — to Fiesole or Petraia , or somewhere else delightful ; but this morning he has an engagement . He did not tell me what it was , and I did not like to tease him with questions . You"—with
48061	48070	48071	48071	Jim	181	companion—"do not happen to know what it is ? "
48125	48134	48136	48137	Mrs. Byng	203	" So that I rather counted upon you , "
48149	48158	48160	48160	Burgoyne	181	" And you did not count in vain , "
48649	48652	48657	48657	her	203	" Spring , "
48799	48802	48804	48804	he	181	" Spring , "
48862	48895	48850	48851	Mrs. Byng	203	" Why , there 's Willy ! Do not you see ? There ! leaning out of that window , and who — who is the lady whom he has with him ? "
49073	49122	49224	49225	the mother	579	" Who is she ? Who can she be ? Have not you an idea ? He has not seen us ! Had not we better creep quietly away ? Most likely he would rather not meet me ; I could not bear to make him look foolish ! "
49159	49163	49164	49164	he	181	" What nonsense ! "
49169	49216	49164	49164	he	181	" I wish you would not let your imagination run away with you so , and of course I know who she is ; she is an — an acquaintance of mine . I — I presented Willy to her ; she is Miss Le Marchant . "
49217	49222	49224	49225	the mother	579	" Miss Le Who ? "
49259	49273	49224	49225	the mother	579	hearing—"an acquaintance of yours , is she ? Oh , then , of course "
49283	49289	49224	49225	the mother	579	" she is all right . "
49290	49294	49296	49296	Jim	181	" All right ! "
49362	49366	49359	49359	she	1179	" all right ! "
49367	49378	49387	49388	Mrs. Byng	203	" All right ! of course she is all right . "
49379	49385	49387	49388	Mrs. Byng	203	" But she is lovely ! "
49413	49422	49428	49428	her	203	" what a dear little face ! but , "
49431	49462	49428	49428	her	203	" is it possible that she is here alone with him ? If so , of course she is American . Oh ! do not say that she is American . "
49463	49470	49472	49472	Burgoyne	181	" Of course she is not , "
49485	49530	49472	49472	Burgoyne	181	" of course she is all that there is of most English , and there is her mother , as large as life , within a yard and a half of her ; there , do not you see ? looking at the Ghirlandajo . "
49556	49598	49534	49534	her	203	" So that is the mother , is it ? a very nice - looking woman , and what beautiful white hair ! Mrs. Le —— what did you say their name was ? Ah ! Willy has seen us , poor boy!"—laughing—"how
49607	49657	49604	49604	he	1184	" And in point of fact the young man , having given a very indubitable start and said something hurried to his companion , is seen advancing quasi - carelessly to meet the two persons , the object of whose observation he has for some minutes so unconsciously been . "
49664	49677	49604	49604	he	1184	" cries Mrs. Byng , with a rather nervously - playful accent ; "
49712	49713	49604	49604	he	1184	" "
49721	49751	49752	49752	I	0	" replies the young man , the colour — always as ready as a school miss 's to put him to shame — mantling in his handsome smooth cheeks . "
49809	49834	49803	49803	she	1188	" But this ingenious attempt to divert the current of his parents ' ideas into another channel is scarcely so successful as it deserves . "
49843	49869	49871	49871	she	1188	" she asks eagerly , and not heeding , evidently not even hearing , the empty question contained in the last half of his speech ; "
49887	49920	49881	49881	you	1183	" It seems a simple and natural request enough , and yet the young man perceptibly hesitates . He even tries to turn it off by a clumsy and entirely pointless jest . "
49949	49968	49942	49942	her	1188	" A look of surprise and of natural annoyance clouds the cheerful eagerness of Mrs. Byng 's face . "
49976	49986	49942	49942	her	1188	" she asks , with a rather vexed smile ; "
50021	50022	50009	50009	you	181	" "
50031	50052	50009	50009	you	181	" replies he , with a stammering unreadiness , which contrasts somewhat ludicrously with the acquiescence conveyed by his words , "
50061	50062	50053	50053	I	0	" "
50082	50265	50072	50072	they	3452	" As she speaks , indeed , Mrs. Le Marchant and Elizabeth are seen nearing the little group ; but it is soon apparent that this movement on their part is by no means owing to any wish or even willingness to make Mrs. Byng 's acquaintance . It is indeed solely due to there being no egress from the room at that end of it where they have been standing , so that , if they wish to leave it , they must necessarily retrace their steps and pass the three persons who are so busily discussing them . They do this so quickly and with so resolute an air of not wishing to be delayed in their exit , bestowing a couple of such smileless and formal bows upon the two men , that it would have needed a much more determined obstruction than either of those gentlemen is prepared to offer to arrest their progress . In a moment they are through the doorway and out of sight . Mrs. Byng looks after them , with her mouth open . "
50285	50310	50312	50312	they	1194	" says the younger man , observing the displeased astonishment expressed by his mother 's countenance , and with a lame effort at explanation . "
50322	50327	50312	50312	they	1194	" retorts she dryly . "
50377	50406	50369	50369	I	0	" So saying , he shoots off in pursuit of the retreated figures , and Mrs. Byng and her escort are again left tête - à - tête . "
50417	50435	50408	50408	you	0	" asks the lady , looking at Jim with a penetrating glance that he does not enjoy ; "
50451	50452	50443	50443	she	1197	" "
50458	50463	50443	50443	she	1197	" answers he testily . "
50467	50468	50469	50469	she	1197	knows?"—laughing unmirthfully—"perhaps
50479	50480	50469	50469	she	1197	" "
50515	50525	50526	50526	Amelia	271	" Although Mrs. Byng always speaks of Miss Wilson as "
50528	50754	50526	50526	Amelia	271	" and is acquainted with every detail of that young lady 's uneventful history — thanks to a long series of direct and interested questions , addressed through a considerable number of years , to her friend Jim , as to his betrothed — she has no personal acquaintance with the latter . She is so determined , however , to repair this omission , now that so highly favourable an opportunity is presented as their common stay in the same small city , that Jim is powerless to hinder her from arranging a joint expedition of the two parties — herself and her son on the one side , and Jim with his future wife and sister - in - law on the other , to Careggi , on the afternoon of the same day as he had witnessed her abortive attempt to add Elizabeth Le Marchant and her mother to the list of her acquaintances . Amelia , is , for a wonder , free from home claims , Sybilla being more than usually bright , a kind friend having lately provided her with a number of the Lancet , containing a detailed account of an operation , which it seems not over - sanguine to expect she may herself be able to undergo . We all have our Blue Roses , and to "
50758	51387	50526	50526	Amelia	271	" as she technically phrases it , is Sybilla Wilson 's Blue Rose . Cecilia is likewise disengaged . The latter circumstance is matter for not unmixed rejoicing to Jim , Cecilia 's future connection with himself being too close for him to relish the thought of her somewhat pronounced wooing of Byng being exposed in all its naïveté to the clear if good - humoured eyes of Byng 's mother . But in this he wrongs Cecilia . The garden - party at the villa on Bellosguardo had proved to her that the fruit is hung too high for her fingers to reach , and that philosophy , which had enabled her genuinely to relish the wedding - cake of the man who had jilted her , now teaches her to lay to heart the sarcastic advice offered her by Jim , to look at the young man as poor women look at diamonds . Beyond one or two trifling gallantries , for which no one can judge her harshly , she leaves him alone , even though out of good - nature , and from inveterate force of habit , he gives her several openings to make love to him . The day is one of even Italy 's best , an air as soft as feathers , and full of April odours — a bright gay sun . The vines are rushing into leaf ; they that ten days ago looked such hopeless sticks ; little juicy leaves uncurling and spreading on each , and the mulberry trees , round which they twine , are rushing out too , at the triumphant call of the spring . The party being of the unmanageable number five , has to be divided between two fiacres , whereof Mrs. Byng , in pursuance of her determination to know Amelia , insists upon occupying the first in tête - à - tête with Miss Wilson , while Cecilia and the two men fill the other . The latter makes but a silent load . Byng is , for him , out of spirits , and finding that Cecilia has virtually abandoned her suit , is glad to lapse into his own reflections . His example is followed by Jim , whose temper is ruffled by being again obliged to defer the quest he is still feverishly anxious to pursue , despite the shock of the morning 's meeting at the Accademia . They reach the villa , and leave their vehicles , glad to think that two of the perennially tired Florentine cab - horses will have a pause of rest , and , having shaken off a tiresome would - be laquais de place , desirous to embitter for them the sweet day and place , they stray at will through the garden among the clipped laurels , the cypresses , the gorgeous red rhododendrons , while beds of mignonette send forth such a steady wave of poignant sweetness as makes the sense ache with ecstasy of pleasure ; and over the conservatory hangs a wistaria so old , so magnificent , with such a Niagara of giant flower bunches , as takes an English breath away . They go over the villa itself , pass through the room , and by the bed where Lorenzo , with the grotesque grim face , Lorenzo the Magnificent , gave his last sigh . It would make Death even more difficult to face than he is already , if one thought one should have to meet him under such a catafalque . As they issue out again from the house 's shadow into the sun - drenched garden , Mrs. Byng joins Burgoyne , who is walking a little apart . "
51392	51397	51390	51390	Amelia	271	" she says confidentially , "
51425	51482	51420	51420	she	271	" It must always be pleasant to hear that the one absolutely good thing which this life has to offer is lavishly heaped upon us by the person with whom we are to pass that life ; and perhaps pleasure is the emotion evidenced by the silent writhe with which Jim receives this piece of information . "
51498	51526	51489	51489	she	271	" continues his friend , perceiving that her speech is received in a silence that may mean disapproval of any intrusion into the sanctuary of his affections ; "
51564	51569	51555	51555	She	271	" He writhes again . "
51582	51718	51720	51720	he	1200	" he answers constrainedly . The not unnatural result of the tone in which he utters this sentence , no less than the words themselves , is to quench the fire of Mrs. Byng 's benevolent eulogies ; and , as she can not at once hit upon another topic , and is by no means sure that her countenance does not betray the rather snubbed dismay produced by the reception of her amenities , she is not sorry when Jim presently leaves her . Being , however , of a very sanguine disposition , and seeing him a little later sitting peacefully on a garden - seat beside his fiancée , she hopes that her words , though not very handsomely received at the time , may bear fruit later for Amelia 's benefit . "
51726	51733	51720	51720	he	1200	" she adds to herself consolatorily . "
51757	52035	51754	51754	he	1200	" The sun is growing visibly lower , and the Ave Maria comes ringing solemnly from the city . The seat to which Jim has somewhat remorsefully led his lady - love is a stone bench , shaded by a honeysuckle bower , close to a fountain . The fountain is not playing now ; but round about it first a marten wheels , dipping in the water the end of her fleet wings ; then a little bat prematurely flits , for it is still broad daylight . Broad indeed and bounteous is the daylight of Italy . Around them is the lush unmown grass ; full of homely field - flowers , buttercups , catch - flies , daisies , ragged robins , while from some bush near by a nightingale is pouring out all the infinite variety of her ravishing song . She says so many different things that one never can feel sure that one has heard all that she has to say . Jim leans back listening , with his hands behind his head , steeped in a half - voluptuous sadness . He is oppressed by the thought of Amelia 's great love . Is the nightingale 's splendid eloquence really the voice of the poor dumb passion beside him , lent to Amelia to plead her cause ? The high - flown poetry of the idea fills his heart with an imaginative yearning kindness towards her . He is in the act of turning to face her , with a more lover - like speech on his lips than has hovered there for years , when Amelia herself anticipates him . "
52045	52056	52043	52043	April	204	" she says , with an air of prosaic astonishment . "
52078	52079	52073	52073	Cecilia	222	" "
52086	52095	52081	52081	Cecilia	222	" repeats Burgoyne in a rather dazed voice . "
52108	52210	52101	52101	Cecilia	222	" This is the form into which are frozen the love - words that the nightingale and the perfume of the Tuscan flowers and the Ave Maria had so nearly brought to his tongue . Had Amelia known what an unwonted burst of tenderness her unlucky reminiscence had choked , she would have regretted it probably with a good deal deeper bitterness than would many a woman with a happier gift of utterance . But she is blessedly ignorant of what Cecilia 's mumps have robbed her , and presently again strikes athwart the nightingale 's song with the placid remark : "
52228	52259	52260	52260	She	3412	" This time Burgoyne has no difficulty in responding immediately . Miss Wilson 's first speech had so effectually chased his dreams that he can now reply with commonplace kindliness : "
52276	52277	52260	52260	She	3412	" "
52286	52293	52279	52279	she	3412	" continues Amelia . He laughs . "
52305	52342	52294	52294	She	3412	" then , with a hurried change of tone , in dread lest the last speech shall call out some expression of the mute pent passion always lurking in her patient eyes , he adds lightly , "
52351	52896	52294	52294	She	3412	" What effect the flat fatuity , as it seems to Jim himself , of this last observation has upon Amelia , does not appear , since she receives it in silence ; and again the Ave Maria and the bird divide between them the province of sound . As the great sun droops , the honeysuckle above their heads seems to give out more generously its strong clean sweetness . The rest of the party have drifted away out of sight and hearing ; but by - and - by their voices are again heard and their returning forms seen . As they draw near , it appears that their original number of three has been augmented by the addition of two men ; and a still nearer approach reveals who the two men are . Mrs. Byng leads the way , talking animatedly to Mr. Greenock , who is evidently an old acquaintance . Byng trails after them by himself , and the rear is brought up by Cecilia and a portly clerically - dressed figure , whom Jim at once recognises as the Devonshire clergyman , his failure in obtaining information about whom has embittered and fidgeted his whole day . Here then is the opportunity he has sought brought to his very hand . And yet his first feeling , as he sees the complacent priestly face , and the deliberate black legs pacing beside Cecilia , is one of dismay . There is nothing unlikely in the supposition that he may have been presented to her at the garden - party at the Bellosguardo villa ; and yet he now realizes with a shock of surprise that they are acquainted , and , if acquainted , then at liberty to converse upon whatever subject may best recommend itself to them . He is absolutely powerless to put any check upon their talk , and yet at this very moment he may be narrating to her that story which his own loyalty had forbidden him to overhear . The first couple has passed , so absorbed in eager question and answer that they do not even see Burgoyne and his betrothed . Mrs. Byng left London only three days ago , and Mr. Greenock might return thither at any moment that he chooses ; and yet they are talking of it with a wistful fondness that might have beseemed Dante questioning some chance wayfarer to Ravenna as to the prosperity of his Florence . The second pair 's voices are lower pitched , and their topics therefore less easy to ascertain ; yet by Cecilia 's gratified and even hopeful air they are evidently agreeable ones . But though agreeable , there is no evidence of their being , by their riveting ear and eye , of the nature he dreads . They also are so absorbed in each other as to have no attention to spare for the quiet silent persons sitting on the stone bench . Amelia looks after them with a benevolent smile . Her sense of humour is neither keen nor quick , but there is a touch of very mild sarcasm in her voice , as she says , watching her sister 's retreating figure : "
52916	52917	52918	52918	I	0	" "
52932	52957	52922	52922	Burton	279	" replies Jim reluctantly , feeling as if even in admitting knowledge of the stranger 's surname he were letting out a dangerous secret . "
52971	52988	52963	52963	she	222	" he adds with a very much more pronounced accent of satire than Miss Wilson 's . "
53009	53038	53041	53041	we	1214	" This last suggestion is the result of a vague , uneasy feeling that , by keeping within earshot , he may exercise some check upon their conversation . "
53043	53071	53041	53041	we	1214	" replies Amelia , for once in her life running counter to a proposition of her lover 's , and turning her meek eyes affectionately upon him ; "
53082	53087	53041	53041	we	1214	and"—laughing—"we should spoil sport . "
53242	53264	53265	53265	she	271	" I think I like to come to these sort of places with you even better than to picture - galleries , "
53274	53280	53282	53282	he	181	" Do you , dear ? "
53302	53325	53282	53282	he	181	" Of course you are quite right : ' God made the country , and man made the — — ' Ah ! "
53590	53678	53584	53584	she	222	" You may depend upon me ; I assure you I am as safe as a church ; if I had chosen I might have made a great deal of mischief in my day , but I never did . I always said that she had a history . I do not pretend to be a physiognomist , but I said so the first time I saw her . I knew that they came from Devonshire . I assure you I am as safe as a church ! "
53745	53752	53753	53753	he	181	" Come and see the wistaria , "
53761	53794	53753	53753	he	181	" you were not with us when we were looking at it , were you ? You were maintaining the other day that wistaria has no scent ; come and smell it ! "
53956	53964	53965	53965	she	222	" You rather cut your own throat , "
53973	54020	53965	53965	she	222	" when you interrupted me and Mr. Burton so rudely ; he was on the point of telling me something very interesting about your dear friends the Le Marchants ; he knows all about them ; he has known Elizabeth ever since she was a child . "
54056	54068	53965	53965	she	222	" Who is Elizabeth ? Do you mean Miss Le Marchant ? "
54069	54080	54082	54082	Cecilia	222	" Mr. Burton talked of her as ' Elizabeth , ' "
54098	54113	54082	54082	Cecilia	222	" one naturally would of a person whom one had known in short frocks . "
54114	54127	53965	53965	she	222	" And he — he told you something very interesting about her ? "
54128	54135	54137	54137	Cecilia	222	" No , he did not , "
54140	54164	54137	54137	Cecilia	222	" he had not the chance ; he was just beginning when you rushed in like a bull in a china shop , and now"—in
54169	54187	53965	53965	she	222	vexation—"I shall probably never have another chance of hearing , as he leaves Florence to - morrow . "
54195	54205	54206	54206	he	181	" Leaves Florence to - morrow , does he ? "
54210	54225	54227	54227	Cecilia	222	" I do not know why you should seem so delighted to hear it , "
54245	54267	54234	54234	her	222	" I do not see anything particularly exhilarating in losing an agreeable acquaintance almost as soon as one has made it ! "
54268	54278	54280	54280	Jim	181	" Perhaps — perhaps it was a false alarm , "
54305	54306	54280	54280	Jim	181	" perhaps"—beginning
54308	54329	54234	54234	her	222	laugh—"he only said it to frighten you ; why do you think that he is leaving Florence to - morrow ? "
54330	54337	54339	54339	she	222	" Because he told me so , "
54342	54395	54339	54339	she	222	" he is at the Grande Bretagne , and he was complaining of not being comfortable there , and I was advising him to move to another hotel , and he said , ' Oh no , it was not worth while , as he was leaving Florence to - morrow . ' "
54444	54453	54455	54455	Cecilia	222	" So your interruption was the more provoking , "
54472	54530	54457	54457	her	222	" as it was our last chance of meeting ; however , you cut your own throat , as he evidently knew something very interesting about your dear friends ; something which he does not generally tell people , and which he would not have told me only that he saw at once I was no blab . "
54567	54572	54573	54573	she	603	" Are you cold , "
54576	54591	54573	54573	she	603	" or did a goose walk over your grave ? Why did you shiver ? "
54597	54602	54603	54603	he	181	" I was shivering , "
54625	54657	54658	54658	She	603	" at the thought of the peril I had saved you from . My poor Cis , have not you and I suffered enough already at the hands of the Church ? "
54661	54688	54658	54658	She	603	" Though I do not pretend to any great sensitiveness on the subject , I think you have worn that old joke nearly off its legs . "
54769	54782	54784	54784	Amelia	271	" Are you coming to look in upon us to - night ? "
54826	54832	54833	54833	he	699	" What do you advise ? "
54836	54847	54833	54833	he	699	" Shall you spend the evening in the usual way ? "
54848	54853	54854	54854	she	271	" I suppose so , "
54857	54885	54854	54854	she	271	" I suppose we shall read aloud ; you know father likes to make our evenings as like our home ones as possible , and Sybilla — — "
54886	54895	54897	54897	he	699	" Then it is no use my coming , "
54900	54909	54926	54926	he	699	" I should have no good of you ; "
54929	54951	54926	54926	he	699	" but , of course , if you wish it , dear — if it would give you any satisfaction — — "
54952	54958	54960	54960	she	271	" But it would not , "
54978	54988	54960	54960	she	271	" when you are by , I always lose my place"—laughing
54989	55007	54926	54926	he	699	tremulously—"and father scolds me ! No , you had far better not come . I must not be greedy"—in
55012	55030	54960	54960	she	271	" I had quite half an hour , nearly three - quarters , of you this afternoon . "
55674	55677	55682	55682	he	699	" Trockne Blumen "
55693	55696	55682	55682	he	699	" Winter aus "
55840	55870	55871	55871	he	699	" I hope you will excuse my taking such a liberty . I know that I had no business to come in when I was told you were out , "
55875	55898	55871	55871	he	699	" but — I thought — I hoped — I had an idea — that you might be glad to hear — — "
55994	55999	56001	56003	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" To hear what ? "
56046	56090	56034	56034	He	699	" I thought you might be glad to hear that the — the inquiries you asked me — I mean that I promised to make — that the person relating to whom I — I made inquiries , leaves Florence to - morrow . "
56130	56144	56120	56122	the elder woman	3305	" To - morrow ? Are you sure ? How do you know ? "
56145	56154	56120	56122	the elder woman	3305	" He said so himself to - day . "
56155	56168	56185	56185	her	3305	" Have you met him ? Have you been talking to him ? "
56204	56242	56196	56196	He	699	" Heaven forbid ! I have taken great care to avoid recalling myself to his memory . I have no desire to renew my acquaintance with him . I — I — hate the sight of him ! "
56299	56310	56365	56365	him	181	" Then how do you know that it is true ? "
56311	56359	56365	56365	him	181	" He told an — an acquaintance of mine ; he was complaining of the discomfort of his hotel , and , on her recommending him to change it , he answered that it was not worth while , as he was leaving Florence to - morrow . "
56420	56502	56410	56412	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" We are extremely obliged to you for having taken so much trouble for us , and it must seem very strange to you that we should be so anxious to hear that this — this person has left Florence ; but in so small a place one is sure to be always coming into collision with those whom one would rather avoid , and there are reasons which — which make it very — painful to us to meet him . "
56596	56622	56623	56623	she	193	" You must have thought us rather impostors when you saw us at the Accademia this morning , after leaving us apparently so shattered overnight , "
56632	56644	56645	56645	he	1280	" I was very glad to find you so perfectly recovered , "
56689	56706	56708	56708	Elizabeth	193	" I think we are a little like india - rubber balls , mammy and I , "
56710	56721	56708	56708	Elizabeth	193	" we have great recovering powers ; if we had not "
56733	56744	56708	56708	Elizabeth	193	" I suppose that we should not be alive now . "
56806	56853	56854	56854	her	193	" But we should not have gone out sight - seeing this morning — we were not at all in a junketing mood — if it had not been for Mr. Byng ; he came in and took us both by storm . It is difficult , "
56880	56928	56874	56874	Jim	181	forth—"it is difficult to resist a person who brings so much sunshine with him — do not you find it so ? He is so very sunshiny , your Mr. Byng . We like sunshine ; we — we have not had a great deal of it . "
56972	56981	56982	56982	she	193	" When you look so kind and interested , "
57003	57009	57010	57010	She	193	" I feel a fraud . "
57013	57022	57024	57024	he	1280	" I look interested because I feel interested , "
57027	57033	57024	57024	he	1280	" fraud or not — but "
57040	57063	57024	57024	he	1280	" do not , even in joke , call yourself ugly names — fraud or not , you can not hinder me . "
57064	57072	57074	57074	she	193	" Do not be interested in me , "
57082	57108	57077	57077	her	193	" we are very bad people to get interested in , we are not repaying people to be interested in . I think — that perhaps "
57114	57161	57077	57077	her	193	" under other circumstances we might have been pleasant enough . Mammy has naturally excellent spirits , and so have I ; it does not take much to make us happy , and even now I often feel like poor little Prince Arthur — But then , "
57165	57185	57077	57077	her	193	" the moment that we begin to feel a little cheerful , something comes and knocks us down again . "
57264	57279	57280	57280	she	193	" Are you sure that he is really gone — going , I mean , "
57289	57336	57280	57280	she	193	" going to - morrow morning , as you say ? Oh , I wish it were to - morrow morning ! But perhaps when to - morrow morning comes , he will have changed his mind . Was he quite , quite sure about it ? "
57337	57348	57350	57350	Jim	181	" He said he was going to - morrow morning , "
57366	57388	57350	57350	Jim	181	" that it was not worth while to change his hotel , as he was leaving Florence to - morrow morning . "
57389	57395	57396	57396	she	193	" He will not go , "
57406	57416	57400	57400	her	193	" nobody but would be loth to leave this heavenly place"—glancing
57435	57446	57400	57400	her	193	garden—"we shall find that he is not gone after all . "
57447	57458	57460	57460	Burgoyne	181	" Nothing will be easier to ascertain than that fact , "
57474	57500	57460	57460	Burgoyne	181	" now that I know which is his hotel , I can inquire there to - morrow morning , and bring you word at once . "
57501	57508	57510	57510	she	193	" Could you , would you ? "
57525	57529	57510	57510	she	193	" but no , "
57536	57561	57510	57510	she	193	" why should you ? Why should we keep you running upon our errands ? What right have we to take up your time ? "
57562	57566	57568	57568	he	181	" My time , "
57571	57602	57568	57568	he	181	" I am like the German Prince mentioned by Heine , who spent his leisure hours — hours of which he had twenty - four every day — in — — "
57603	57612	57614	57614	Elizabeth	193	" But if we do not rob you , "
57623	57638	57614	57614	Elizabeth	193	" we rob Miss — Miss Wilson . What will she say to us ? "
57639	57647	57649	57649	he	181	" She will be only too glad , "
57698	57702	57704	57704	Elizabeth	193	" Will she ? "
57723	57755	57715	57715	her	193	" How good of her ! and how unlike most very happy people ! Happy people are generally rather exacting ; but she looks good . She has a dear face ! "
57793	57802	57803	57803	she	193	" I am afraid I have vexed you , "
57810	57846	57803	57803	she	193	" I had no business to praise her to you ; it was like praising a person to himself ; but do not be angry with me — I did not mean to be impertinent ! "
57893	57907	57908	57908	he	181	" I will not — I will not let you say such things , "
57913	57944	57908	57908	he	181	" She is good : she has a dear face : and I love to hear you say so ! May I — may I bring her to see you ? "
58026	58033	58034	58034	he	181	" You will not say no ? "
58038	58058	58034	58034	he	181	" I am sure you will not say no . I shall feel very much snubbed if you do . "
58086	58113	58075	58075	He	181	" I must apologize for having made the suggestion . I can only beg you to forget that it was ever made . Good - bye ! "
58163	58171	58172	58172	she	1287	" I thought you would have understood , "
58176	58191	58172	58172	she	1287	" I thought that you were the one person who would not have misunderstood . "
58244	58276	58230	58230	she	1287	" You know — we told you — even at Genoa — that — that we are not going out , that we do not wish to make any new acquaintances ! "
58277	58281	58283	58283	he	181	" I know , "
58289	58313	58283	58283	he	181	" that that is the hollow formal bulletin you issue to the world in general , but I thought — I hoped — — "
58314	58323	58324	58324	she	1287	" Do not bring her to see me , "
58347	58365	58324	58324	she	1287	" She — she might be sorry — she — she might not like it — afterwards ! "
58401	58476	58390	58390	he	181	" You have been so kind in not asking me any questions , you have even given up alluding to old times since you saw that it hurt me ; but you must see — of course you do — that — that there is something — in me — not like other people ; something that — that prevents — my — having any friends ! I have not a friend in the world "
58483	58494	58390	58390	he	181	" except my mother — except mammy ! Do you think "
58502	58523	58390	58390	he	181	" that it is very silly of me , at my age , to call her ' mammy ' still ? "
58524	58528	58529	58529	he	1288	" I think , "
58532	58556	58529	58529	he	1288	" that I am one of the greatest brutes out , and that I should be thankful if someone would kick me downstairs . "
58619	58628	58614	58615	no one	819	" the spring comes slowly up this way . "
58684	58687	58696	58698	a wonderful Paulownia	1294	" unhandsome thrift "
59512	59515	59506	59506	she	222	" Etiquette , "
59560	59576	59506	59506	she	222	" Your husband takes the Baronet 's daughter , and you follow with the Prince . "—"We
59588	59684	59506	59506	she	222	" etc . Upon Jim 's entrance Cecilia lays down her paper , and at once offers to go in search of her sister , with whom she shortly returns . He had been quite right . There is no peace to make . Amelia greets him with her usual patient and perfectly unrancorous smile , but his second glance at her tells him that she is looking old and fagged . It is only in very early youth that vigils and worries and self - denials do not write their names upon the skin . "
59692	59715	59506	59506	she	222	" he says . If he had given utterance to the word that hovered on his lips , he would have cried , "
59719	59720	59727	59727	she	1317	" "
59731	59742	59727	59727	she	1317	" says Cecilia with a shrug , looking up from her "
59745	59752	59753	59753	she	1317	" to which she has returned ; "
59817	59827	59813	59813	you	1321	" Amelia has subsided rather wearily into a chair . "
59836	59839	59875	59875	she	1317	" says she apologetically—"and
59851	59852	59875	59875	she	1317	" "
59856	59865	59866	59866	she	1317	" rejoins her sister , with an exasperated sniff "
59879	59880	59875	59875	she	1317	" "
59890	59917	59875	59875	she	1317	" replies he heartily ; and then his conscience - struck eyes revert to his betrothed 's wan face , all the plainer for its wanness . "
59925	59939	59958	59959	Mrs. Byng	203	" in an injured tone , checking off the items on his fingers . "
59947	59955	59941	59941	I	0	" smiling at him with pale affection ; "
59976	60035	59967	59968	Mrs. Byng	203	" She does not lay the faintest invidious accent on the name , as if contrasting it with another whose owner had been so far less kind ; it is his own guilty heart that supplies the emphasis . His only resource is an anger which — so curiously perverse is human nature — is not even feigned . "
60058	60077	60042	60043	Mrs. Byng	203	" he says in a surly voice . She does not defend herself but her lower lip trembles . "
60084	60103	60081	60081	me	0	" he cries , remorse giving a harshness even to the tone of the sincerely - meant invitation . "
60155	60183	60151	60151	I	0	" The genuine eagerness of his proposal has tinged her sickly - coloured cheek with a healthier hue for the moment , but she shakes her head . "
60216	60244	60245	60245	He	3390	" The only sign of approval of this instance of filial piety given by Jim is that he rises and begins to stamp irritably about the room . "
60253	60260	60261	60261	he	3390	" continues Amelia in anxious deprecation ; "
60293	60294	60289	60289	He	3390	" "
60302	60347	60348	60348	I	0	" This is not what Mr. Wilson said , but is the expression of the unjust wrath which Burgoyne , feeling it much pleasanter to be angry with someone else than himself is artificially and not unsuccessfully fostering . Again Amelia 's lip quivers . "
60351	60356	60348	60348	I	0	" she says gently , "
60376	60401	60348	60348	I	0	" Nothing can be milder than the form which this suggestion takes , and yet there is something in its shape that provokes him . "
60404	60409	60412	60412	I	0	" he interrupts tartly , "
60433	60434	60435	60435	I	0	" "
60443	60466	60435	60435	I	0	" rejoins she — the light that his first proposal to take her out had brought into her face growing brighter and more established—"because
60485	60486	60531	60531	Amelia	271	" "
60510	60521	60522	60522	I	0	" cries he , with a sort of spurious grumpiness . "
60543	60551	60535	60535	her	271	" says Cecilia , whose attention to her "
60553	60704	60705	60705	I	0	" is apparently not so absorbing but that she has some to spare for the conversation going on in her neighbourhood . They all laugh a little ; and harmony being restored , and Jim graciously vouchsafing to forgive Amelia for having ignored her for a sennight , she returns to her patient , and he to his hotel , where he is at once , contrary to his wish , pounced upon by Byng . For some reason , which he would be puzzled to explain to himself , he has for the last week rather avoided his friend 's company — a task rendered easier by the disposition manifested by the young man 's mother to monopolize him , a disposition to which Burgoyne has felt no inclination to run counter . It is without enthusiasm that he receives Byng 's expressions of pleasure in their accidental meeting . "
60716	60717	60719	60719	you	0	" "
60721	60722	60719	60719	you	0	" "
60728	60729	60725	60725	you	0	" "
60737	60769	60725	60725	you	0	Américain"—with a flash of inward self - congratulation at this query having been put to - day , instead of yesterday , or the day before . The other looks disappointed . "
60789	60823	60783	60783	you	0	" Burgoyne has ceased to feign lack of understanding to whom the personal pronoun refers , and he answers with as much carelessness as at a moment 's notice he can put on : "
60835	60836	60838	60838	they	82	" "
60858	60859	60860	60860	They	82	" "
60862	60864	60838	60838	they	82	do"—dryly . "
60871	60872	60873	60873	They	82	" "
60877	60889	60873	60873	They	82	perhaps"—sarcastically—"the subject was too acutely painful for them to allude to . "
60945	60956	61004	61004	he	1335	" She — she has not referred to the subject ? "
60957	60961	61004	61004	he	1335	" What subject ? "
60962	60968	61004	61004	he	1335	" To — to me ? "
60969	60977	61004	61004	he	1335	" She has never mentioned your name . Stay"—his
60987	61002	61004	61004	he	1335	nature—"one day she said that you were sunshiny , and that she liked sunshine . "
61077	61084	61086	61086	Byng	203	" I should have been over , "
61093	61128	61086	61086	Byng	203	" every day , every hour , as often as they would have received me , only that I could not leave my mother ; and she — she has taken them en grippe ! "
61129	61136	61138	61138	Jim	181	" En grippe ? Your mother ? "
61161	61164	61165	61166	The other	396	" why ? "
61172	61249	61165	61166	The other	396	" I have not an idea ; it can not be because they did not seem to wish to be introduced to her at the Accademia the other day ; she is quite incapable of such pettiness , and she admired HER so tremendously at first , did not she ? You heard her ; but since then she has taken it into her head that there is something — I can not bear even to say it"—dashing
61257	61275	61276	61276	his	396	table—"something louche , as she calls it , about her . Mother thinks that she — she — she"—sinking
61283	61297	61276	61276	his	396	whisper—"has — has gone off the rails some time or other . Can you conceive?"—raising
61308	61329	61298	61298	his	396	indignation—"that anyone — any human being could look in her face and harbour such a notion for a single instant ? "
61377	61393	61357	61357	Burgoyne	181	" How — how can such an idea have got into your mother 's head ? "
61394	61471	61472	61472	Burgoyne	181	" I do not know , but it is there ; and what I wanted you , what I have been searching everywhere for you for , is to ask you to — to set her right , at once , without any delay . It is unbearable that she should go on thinking such things , and nothing could be easier for you , who know them so well , who know all about them ! "
61506	61512	61513	61513	he	181	" Know all about them ? "
61528	61572	61513	61513	he	181	" Who dares ever say that he knows all about any other living soul ? How many times must I tell you that , until we met at Genoa , I had not set eyes on Miss Le Marchant for ten good years ? "
61608	61615	61616	61616	he	181	" But when you knew them , "
61619	61645	61616	61616	he	181	" in Devonshire , they — they were all right then , were not they ? they were well thought of?—there was nothing against them ? "
61646	61652	61654	61654	Jim	181	" Good Heavens — no ! "
61681	61708	61709	61709	Byng	203	" There was not a family in all the neighbourhood that stood so high . Everybody loved them ; everybody had a good word for them . "
61716	61733	61709	61709	Byng	203	" And there is no reason — you have no reason for supposing anything different now ? "
61770	61789	61790	61790	He	181	" The facts of life are enough for me ; I do not trouble myself with its suppositions . "
61814	61826	61837	61837	He	181	" But you must have an opinion — you must think , "
61855	61867	61868	61868	he	181	" I asked her permission to bring Amelia to see her , "
61877	61900	61868	61868	he	181	" if I had thought as ill of her as your mother does , do you think I should have done that ? "
61901	61919	61868	61868	he	181	Camille.—"Que me conseilleriez - vous de faire le jour où je verrais que vous ne m'aimez plus ? "

62558	62576	62578	62579	Mrs. Byng	203	" What a bad conscience you must have ! Did you think that I was a bailiff ? "
62583	62588	62589	62589	he	1366	" Where is Amelia ? "
62625	62633	62620	62620	her	3511	" What have you done with Amelia ? "
62634	62646	62648	62648	she	271	" What a ' Stand - and - deliver ' tone ! "
62659	62666	62648	62648	she	271	" Well , where is she ? "
62670	62683	62685	62685	her	271	" She was here five minutes ago with Willy . Poor Amelia ! "
62693	62737	62685	62685	her	271	" I am so glad you have come at last ; she is patience personified . I must congratulate you upon the excellent training into which you have got her , but I think that she was beginning to look a little anxious . "
62738	62756	62758	62758	he	1370	" And I think that you have been giving the reins to your imagination , as usual , "
62953	62972	62948	62948	Jim	181	" I understood that Miss Wilson was with you ? Do you happen to know where she is ? "
62981	62988	62989	62989	he	1370	" Why , where is she ? "
63008	63023	62989	62989	he	1370	" She was here five minutes ago . Where can she have disappeared to ? "
63525	63528	63529	63529	he	181	" Amelia ! "
63532	63553	63529	63529	he	181	" Amelia ! What are you doing up here ? With whom are you playing hide - and - seek ? "
63650	63655	63608	63608	her	201	" Are you ill ? "
63656	63664	63608	63608	her	201	" No ; I am not ill . "
63729	63734	63735	63735	he	181	" Is it possible , "
63745	63803	63735	63735	he	181	" that I am to attribute this — this state of things — to my being accidentally late ? It was a mere accident : it is not like you to make a scene . I do not recognise you ; I am very sorry that I was late , and that I have made you angry . "
63836	63839	63840	63840	she	201	" Angry ! "
63843	63871	63840	63840	she	201	" angry with you for being late ? Oh , you are quite mistaken ! In all these years how often have I been angry with you ? "
63893	63899	63900	63900	he	181	" Then what is it ? "
63904	63939	63940	63940	She	201	" what is it all about ? I think I have a right to ask you that ; since I saw you last something must have happened to you to produce this extraordinary change . "
63947	63960	63940	63940	She	201	" Something has happened to me ; yes , something has happened ! "
63961	63986	63987	63987	He	181	" But what — what kind of a something ? I have a right to know — I insist upon knowing ; tell me ! "
64061	64083	64051	64051	she	201	" I will tell you , there is no question of insisting . I should have told you anyhow ; but not here"—glancing
64088	64091	64051	64051	she	201	curtains—"not now ! "
64092	64101	64102	64102	Her	201	" Why not here ? Why not now ? "
64106	64111	64112	64112	she	201	" I could not , "
64116	64147	64112	64112	she	201	" I do not quite know how I shall get through telling it ; it must be somewhere — somewhere where it will not matter if I do break down ! "
64163	64208	64148	64148	He	181	" Have you gone mad , Amelia ? or are you taking a leaf out of Sybilla 's book ? If you do not clear up this extraordinary mystification at once , I shall be compelled to believe either the one or the other . "
64216	64226	64227	64227	she	201	" Oh , if it were only a mystification ! "
64235	64254	64227	64227	she	201	" I can not tell you here ; it is physically impossible to me . But do not be afraid"—with
64269	64347	64353	64353	she	1413	for—"you shall not have long to wait ; I will tell you , without fail , to - morrow ; to - morrow morning , if you like . Come as early as you please , I shall be ready to tell you ; and now would you mind leaving me ? I want to have a few moments to myself before I see anybody — before I see Mrs. Byng ; will you please leave me ? "
64731	64742	64714	64714	she	201	" it does not matter if she does break down . "
64784	64792	64780	64781	the Baron	1426	" On ne badine pas avec l'amour , "
64810	64846	64854	64854	he	181	" Non , en vérité , non , mon ami , je n'y comprends absolûment rien . Tout cela me paraît une conduite désordonnée , il est vrai , mais sans motif comme sans excuse . "
64923	64937	64918	64918	she	201	" In all these years how often have I been angry with you ? "
65577	65587	65588	65588	she	201	" I have a proposal to make to you , "
65594	65639	65588	65588	she	201	" Father is so well this morning , quite easy , and he has been wheeled into the sitting - room to see Sybilla . She has been very good about him this time , and quite believes that he has been really bad . "
65640	65646	65648	65648	Jim	181	" How good of her ! "
65651	65672	65648	65648	Jim	181	" it would be so easy and so amusing to play at having a swollen toe , would not it ? "
65673	65677	65679	65680	Miss Wilson	200	" And so , "
65690	65714	65679	65680	Miss Wilson	200	" I am perfectly free , and I want you to take me somewhere , some little drive or expedition ; you see , "
65725	65745	65679	65680	Miss Wilson	200	" I counted upon your saying ' yes ' ; I dressed so as not to keep you waiting . "
65846	65858	65833	65833	he	181	" By all means . I am quite at your service . "
65859	65867	65869	65869	Amelia	201	" And now where shall we go ? "
65887	65954	65869	65869	Amelia	201	" that is the next thing — not to any gallery or church , I think , if you do not mind ; I say such stupid things about Art , and the more I try , the stupider they are ; let us go somewhere into the country — I can understand the country . I am not afraid of saying stupid things about it . "
65999	66017	66018	66018	she	605	" It would be a sin to be under any roof to - day but this one , "
66032	66046	66018	66018	she	605	" would you mind — could you spare time to go to Fiesole ? "
66724	66727	66712	66712	them	3256	" mingled hue "
66732	66738	66712	66712	them	3256	" purfled scarf doth show ! "
66911	66923	66905	66905	he	181	" I thought that you had something to say to me ? "
66961	66966	66955	66955	she	201	" So I have . "
66967	66979	66955	66955	she	201	" And how much longer am I to wait for it ? "
67011	67021	66995	66995	her	201	" Are you in such a hurry to hear ? "
67073	67083	67084	67084	he	181	" I do not know what you call hurry , "
67088	67102	67084	67084	he	181	" I have been awaiting this mystic utterance for sixteen or seventeen hours . "
67117	67123	67124	67124	she	201	" You are quite right , "
67128	67163	67124	67124	she	201	" I have no business to keep you waiting . I meant to tell you as soon as we got here ; I asked you to bring me here on purpose , only — — "
67164	67188	67190	67190	he	181	" You told me that you must make the communication at some place where it would not matter if you did break down , "
67198	67214	67190	67190	he	181	" you must allow that that was not an encouraging exordium . Do you look upon this"—glancing
67216	67225	67124	67124	she	201	round—"as a particularly suitable place for breaking down ? "
67250	67257	67258	67258	she	201	" I shall not break down , "
67269	67320	67258	67258	she	201	" you need not be afraid that I shall . I know that yesterday I was foolish enough to say the very words you quote , but I was not quite myself then ; I did not quite know what I was saying ; I had only just heard it . "
67321	67353	67364	67364	her	201	" It ? What IT ? Is this a new riddle ? For Heaven 's sake let us hear the answer to the first before we embark on any fresh one ! "
67354	67360	67362	67362	she	201	" It is no riddle , "
67374	67402	67362	67362	she	201	" nothing could be plainer ; it was only that I happened to overhear something rather — rather painful — something that was not intended for me . "
67476	67501	67459	67459	he	181	" If you had lived longer in Florence , you would know how much importance to attach to its tittle - tattle and cancans . "
67511	67522	67504	67504	her	201	" This was no tittle - tattle — no cancan . "
67536	67541	67542	67542	he	181	" It is astonishing , "
67550	67578	67542	67542	he	181	" how ready even the best women are to believe evil ; what — what evidence have you of the truth of — of these precious stories ? "
67579	67583	67584	67584	she	201	" What evidence ? "
67592	67610	67588	67588	her	201	him—"the evidence of my own heart . I realize now that I have known it all along . "
67671	67678	67662	67662	he	181	" Have known what all along ? "
67736	67744	67745	67745	she	201	" That you are sick of me , "
67755	67768	67745	67745	she	201	" sick to death of me — that was what she said . "
67856	67861	67867	67867	His	181	" What who said ? "
67862	67866	67867	67867	His	181	" Mrs. Byng . "
67871	67892	67867	67867	His	181	" Mrs. Byng — Mrs. Byng told you that I was sick of you ? Sick to death of you ? "
67893	67898	67899	67899	she	193	" Oh , no , "
67915	67962	67899	67899	she	193	" she did not tell me so ! How could you imagine such a thing ? She is far , far too kind - hearted ; she would not hurt a fly intentionally , and would be exceedingly pained if she thought I had overheard her . "
67969	67994	67963	67963	He	181	" Je m'y perds ! She told you , and she did not tell you ; you heard , and you did not hear . "
67995	68006	68007	68007	she	193	" I am telling it very stupidly , I know , "
68011	68031	68032	68032	She	193	" very confusedly ; and of course I ca n't expect you to understand by instinct how it was . "
68049	68155	68032	68032	She	193	" You know she took me to the party , but when we reached the villa , I found that she knew so many people , and I so few , that I should only be a burden to her if I kept continually by her side , and as I was rather tired — you know that I had not been in bed for two or three nights — I thought I would go into the house and rest , so as to be quite fresh by the time you came . I fancied it was not unlikely you might be a little late . "
68196	68215	68032	68032	She	193	" I discovered that chair by the window under the curtain , the one where you found me . "
68216	68219	68032	68032	She	193	" Well ? "
68220	68258	68032	68032	She	193	" It was so quiet there , as everybody was in the garden , that I suppose I fell asleep ; at least I remember nothing more until suddenly I heard Mrs. Byng 's voice saying — — "
68259	68263	68032	68032	She	193	" Saying what ? "
68264	68376	68032	68032	She	193	" Her son was with her — he had brought her in to have some tea ; it was to him that she was speaking ; she was asking him about me , where I was ? where he had left me ? whether he had seen me lately ? And then she said , ' Poor Amelia , Jim really does neglect her shamefully ; and yet one can not help being sorry for him , too ; it was such child - stealing in the first instance , and he is evidently dead - sick of her ! It is so astonishing that she does not see it ! ' "
68451	68481	68448	68448	she	201	" And then he , Mr. Byng , answered , ' Poor soul , it — it is odd ! She must have the hide of a hippopotamus . ' "
68644	68650	68652	68652	Amelia	201	" She was perfectly right , "
68659	68712	68652	68652	Amelia	201	" it is astonishing that I should not have seen it ; and it was child - stealing ; you were barely twenty - one , and I — I was not very young for a woman even then — I was twenty - three . I ought to have known better . "
68773	68783	68785	68786	Miss Wilson	200	" However , it might have been much worse , "
68788	68829	68785	68786	Miss Wilson	200	" just think if I had overheard it only after I had married you , when I knew that there was nothing but death that could rid you of me . I thank God I have heard it in time . "
68877	68882	68883	68883	she	200	" Child - stealing , "
68890	68892	68883	68883	she	200	" and yet"—with
68899	68917	68883	68883	she	200	deprecation—"you seemed old for your age ; you seemed so much in earnest ; I think you really were;"—a
68919	68971	68887	68887	her	200	pause—"and afterwards , though of course I could not help seeing that I was not to you what you were to me , yet I thought — I hoped that if I waited — if I was patient — if no one else — no one more worthy of you came between us"—another
68979	69007	68977	68977	her	200	speech—"you might grow a little fond of me , out of long habit ; I never expected you to be more than a little fond of me ! "
69093	69124	69089	69089	she	200	" But you could not ; I am not so unjust as not to know that you tried your best . Poor fellow ! it must have been uphill work for you"—with
69129	69198	69089	69089	she	200	bitterness—"labouring to love me , for eight years ; is it any wonder that you failed ? and I was so thick - skinned I did not see it — the ' hide of a hippopotamus ' indeed ! There could not be a juster comparison ; and now all I can do is to beg your pardon for having spoilt eight of your best years — your best years"—with
69202	69204	69089	69089	she	200	" but come"—more
69205	69239	69089	69089	she	200	lightly—"you have some very good ones left too ; you are still quite young ; for a man you are quite young ; the harm I have done you is not irreparable ; I think"—with
69243	69262	69089	69089	she	200	reproach—"you might ease my mind by telling me that the harm I have done you is not irreparable ! "
69326	69338	69339	69339	he	1501	" And what about the harm I have done to you ? "
69354	69365	69339	69339	he	1501	" what about the eight best years of your life ? "
69404	69411	69412	69412	she	1502	" Do not fret about them , "
69416	69471	69412	69412	she	1502	" they were — they always will have been — the eight best years of my life . They were full of good and pleasant things . Do not forget — I would not for worlds have you forget — I shall never forget myself — that they all came to me through you ! "
69551	69555	69556	69556	he	1501	" Through me ? "
69569	69657	69556	69556	he	1501	" you do not mean to be ironical , dear ; you were never such a thing in your life ; you could not be if you tried ; but if you knew what a sweep you make me feel when you say the sort of thing you have just said!—and so it is all to come to an end , is it ? Good as these eight years have been , you have had enough of them ? You do not want any more like them ? "
69688	69705	69665	69665	He	1501	" And all because you have heard some fool say that I was tired of you ? "
69720	69731	69732	69732	She	1502	" Worse than tired ! sick ! sick to death ! "
69946	69955	69956	69956	She	1502	" Am I sick of you , Amelia ? "
70012	70019	70020	70020	He	1501	" Yes ! yes ! YES ! "
70070	70079	70046	70046	He	1501	" Am I sick of you , Amelia ? "
70195	70200	70201	70201	she	1502	" Is it possible ? "
70207	70217	70201	70201	she	1502	" do you mean — that you are not ? "
70271	70273	70274	70274	he	1501	" else "
70341	70356	70357	70357	Cecilia	222	" We have been thinking that Jim was going to jilt you , Amelia ! "
70475	70483	70484	70484	he	181	" Where have you been all day ? "

70516	70531	70533	70534	the other	396	" I am not so sure that I should always receive the same answer , "
70539	70542	70484	70484	he	181	laugh—"but stop a bit!"—seeing
70553	70580	70484	70484	he	181	movements—"my mother is asking for you ; she has been asking for you all the afternoon ; she wants to speak to you before she goes . "
70581	70584	70484	70484	he	181	" Goes ? "
70585	70630	70631	70631	Jim	181	" Yes , she is off at seven o'clock to - morrow morning — back to England : she had a telegram to - day to say that her old aunt , the one who brought her up , has had a second stroke . No!"—seeing
70650	70697	70484	70484	he	181	occasions—"it is no case of great grief ; the poor old woman has been quite silly ever since her last attack ; but mother thinks that she ought to be there , at — at the end ; to look after things , and so forth . "
70778	70786	70788	70788	Byng	203	" I offered to go with her , "
70802	70807	70808	70808	Byng	203	" And she refused ? "
70831	70870	70808	70808	Byng	203	" Mother is so unselfish that it is always difficult to make out what she really wishes ; but — but I do not quite see of what use I should be to her if I did go . "
70892	70903	70879	70879	Burgoyne	181	" If you take my advice you will go home . "
70936	70939	70932	70932	Byng	203	" Why ? "
70940	70958	70959	70961	The young man	643	" Because , if you stay here , I think you will most likely get into mischief . "
70979	70996	70997	70997	he	643	" The same kind of mischief that you have been getting into during the past week ? "
71075	71087	71088	71088	he	643	" I do not know what has happened to my mother , "
71095	71116	71092	71092	his	643	" there is no one less of a mauvaise langue than she , as you know ; but in the case of——"—he
71125	71180	71092	71092	his	643	" she has been warning me against them again ; I ca n't find that she has any reason to go upon ; but she has taken a violent prejudice against her . She says that it is one of her instincts ; and you — you have done nothing towards setting her right ? "

71220	71230	71217	71217	his	643	" Why should I?—it is no concern of mine . "
71231	71254	71256	71256	Byng	203	" No concern of yours to stand by and see an angel 's white robe besmirched by the foul mire of slander ? "
71280	71284	71256	71256	Byng	203	" see blood . "
71285	71320	71322	71322	he	643	" When I come across such a disagreeable sight it will be time enough to decide whether I will interfere or not . At present I have not met with anything of the kind , "
71418	71422	71423	71423	he	643	" I hear , "
71424	71436	71397	71397	She	1528	begins—"Willy tells me — I am very sorry to hear — — "
71437	71448	71450	71450	she	1528	" Oh , there is no great cause for sorrow , "
71469	71498	71397	71397	She	1528	conversation—"poor dear old auntie!—the people who love her best could not wish to keep her in the state she has been in for the last year ; oh , dear!"—sighing—"how
71528	71529	71530	71530	I	0	" "
71534	71539	71530	71530	I	0	" replies he gravely ; "
71560	71602	71603	71603	I	0	" He looks at her resentfully as she speaks , but she has so entirely forgotten her own application of the accented adjectives to his feelings for Amelia , that she replies only by a rather puzzled but perfectly innocent glance . "
71616	71629	71603	71603	I	0	" she goes on presently , pursuing her own train of thought ; "
71644	71648	71630	71630	I	0	" He smiles . "
71669	71670	71719	71719	you	0	" "
71674	71682	71719	71719	you	0	" rejoins she , with some warmth ; "
71716	71717	71711	71711	I	0	" "
71737	71755	71719	71719	you	0	" inquires Jim , with an irritating air of asking for information . Mrs. Byng reddens slightly . "
71808	71809	71812	71817	no cannibals in the Rocky Mountains	1533	" "
71819	71840	71812	71817	no cannibals in the Rocky Mountains	1533	" corrects Jim quietly ; and then they both laugh , and recommence their talk on a more friendly footing . "
71850	71851	71848	71848	Willy	222	" "
71854	71855	71848	71848	Willy	222	" "

71946	71975	71984	71984	Willy	222	" repeats Burgoyne slowly , reflecting in how extremely commonplace a light both the virtues and vices of his fellow - traveller have always presented themselves to him ; "
71989	72008	72009	72009	She	0	cannot"—smiling—"encourage you in the idea that you have added one to the number of the world 's eccentrics . "
72022	72078	72009	72009	She	0	" ' Children are avenues to misfortune , ' as somebody said , and I think that , whoever he was , he was right . ' If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth , such as are those in the land , what good shall my life do to me ? ' "
72079	72090	72009	72009	She	0	" Why should you credit Jacob with any such intention ? "
72091	72103	72009	72009	She	0	" I do not half like leaving him here by himself . "
72104	72116	72009	72009	She	0	" By himself ? You count me as no one then ? "
72117	72173	72174	72174	He	1537	" Oh yes , I do — I count you as a great deal ; that is why I was so anxious to speak to you before I went ; of course I do not expect you to take upon yourself the whole responsibility of him , but you might keep an eye upon him . "
72179	72203	72174	72174	He	1537	" As I have to keep the other eye upon myself , I am afraid that the effort would but make me squint . "
72204	72253	72009	72009	She	0	" It is his own generosity that I am afraid of — his self - sacrificing impulses ; I am always in terror of his marrying someone out of pure good - nature , just to oblige her , just because she looked as if she wished it . "
72254	72279	72174	72174	He	1537	" Stevenson thinks that it does not much matter whom we marry , whether ' noisy scullions , ' or ' acidulous vestals . ' "
72280	72331	72174	72174	He	1537	" I do not care what Stevenson thinks : ever since Willy was in Eton jackets , I have had a nightmare of his bringing me home as daughter - in - law some poor little governess with her nose through her veil , and her fingers through her gloves ! "
72351	72375	72376	72377	Mrs. Byng	203	" I think you overrate his magnanimity ; I never saw him at all tender to anyone whose gloves were not beyond suspicion . "
72381	72405	72376	72377	Mrs. Byng	203	" Well , if she has not holes in her gloves , she may have holes in her reputation , which is worse . "
72458	72482	72452	72452	He	181	" These Le Marchants — as they are friends of yours — I suppose that I ought not to say anything against them ? "
72483	72501	72503	72503	he	181	" I am sure that you are too well - bred to do anything of the kind , "
72527	72563	72519	72519	she	203	" I do not think I am ; I am only well - bred now and then , when it suits me ; I am not going to be well - bred to - night . "
72564	72572	72452	72452	He	181	" I am sorry to hear it . "
72573	72589	72452	72452	He	181	" Whether they are friends of yours or not , I do not like them . "
72590	72607	72452	72452	He	181	" I do not think that that matters much , either to you or to them . "
72608	72618	72452	72452	He	181	" I have an instinct that they are adventuresses . "
72619	72625	72452	72452	He	181	" I know for a certainty "
72629	72637	72452	72452	He	181	warmth—"that they are nothing of the kind . "
72638	72648	72452	72452	He	181	" Then why do not they go out anywhere ? "
72649	72656	72452	72452	He	181	" Because they do not choose . "
72657	72679	72452	72452	He	181	" Because no one asks them , more likely ! Why were they so determined not to be introduced to me ? "
72680	72686	72452	72452	He	181	" How can I tell ? Perhaps"—with
72689	72696	72697	72697	She	1538	laugh—"they did not like your looks ! "
72707	72715	72716	72716	Her	1538	" Who is ill - bred now ? "
72735	72736	72716	72716	Her	1538	" I!"—he
72738	72744	72761	72761	she	1538	contritely—"undoubtedly I ! but — — "
72745	72750	72752	72752	she	1538	" Do not apologize , "
72768	72831	72761	72761	she	1538	" I like you for standing up for them if they are your friends ; and I hope that you will do the same good office for me when someone sticks pins into me behind my back ; but come now , let us be rational ; surely we may talk quietly about them without insulting each other , may not we ? "
72832	72842	72761	72761	she	1538	" I do not know ; we can try . "
72843	72845	72761	72761	she	1538	" I suppose"—a
72847	72869	72870	72870	He	1541	ironically—"that you are not so sensitive about them but that you can bear me to ask a few perfectly harmless questions ? "
72873	72890	72870	72870	He	1541	" Of course ! of course ! what are they to me?—they are nothing to me ! "
72914	72941	72911	72911	her	1542	" Then you really will be doing me a great service if you tell me just exactly all you know about them , good and bad . "
72942	72949	72961	72961	he	181	" All I know about them , "
72967	73032	72961	72961	he	181	lesson—"is that they were extremely kind to me ten years ago ; that they had a beautiful place in Devonshire , and were universally loved and respected : I hear that they have let their place ; so no doubt they are not so much loved and respected as they were ; and now you know as much about the matter as I do ! "
73318	73327	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	" You will keep an eye upon him ? "
73330	73341	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	" You will keep an eye upon him — promise ? "
73342	73380	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	" I do not know what ' keeping an eye upon him ' means in your vocabulary ; often you and I do not use the same dictionary ; until I know , I will not promise . "
73381	73392	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	" You will look after him ; do , Jim ! "
73393	73396	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	" My dear madam"—with
73397	73424	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	irritation—"let me go and buy your papers ; and meanwhile urge him to look after me ; I assure you that it is quite as necessary . "
73425	73436	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	" Fiddlesticks , with your unimaginative , unemotional nature — — "
73437	73440	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	" H'm ! "
73441	73452	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	" Your head will always take care of your heart . "
73453	73457	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	" Will it ? "
73458	73483	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	" While he — promise me at least that , if you see him rushing to his ruin , you will telegraph to me ? "
73484	73528	73304	73305	Mrs. Byng	203	" Certainly , if you wish it ; I will telegraph , ' Willy rushing Ruin . ' At five - and - twenty centimes a word , it will cost you sevenpence halfpenny ; not dear at the price , is it ? "
73533	73559	73529	73530	The mother	579	" You have become a very mauvais plaisant of late , Jim ; oh dear me ! here he is back again , tiresome boy ! "
73807	73815	73817	73817	Cecilia	222	" You are late to - day , "
73861	73891	73848	73848	her	201	" we began to think you had had a relapse . I was just telling Amelia that the pace had been too good to last — ha , ha ! "
73924	73933	73934	73934	he	181	" I have been seeing Mrs. Byng off , "
73964	73981	73983	73983	Cecilia	222	" You let her go without getting that wedding present out of her , after all ? "
73994	74000	74002	74002	Sybilla	221	" Gone , is she ? "
74013	74069	74002	74002	Sybilla	221	" well , I , for one , shall not cry . I am afraid that she was not very simpatica to me ; she was so dreadfully robust . Perhaps , now that she is no longer here to monopolise him , we shall be allowed to see something more of that nice boy . "
74093	74097	74098	74098	Sybilla	221	" nice boy . "
74104	74120	74121	74121	she	221	" I dare say that he has a delicacy about coming without a special invitation , "
74124	74183	74121	74121	she	221	" where there is an invalid ; but you might tell him that on my good days no one is more pleased to see their friends than I ; it does not even send my temperature up ; you might tell him that on my good days Dr. Coldstream says it does not even send my temperature up ! "
74189	74203	74205	74205	Sybilla	221	" You do not seem to be listening to what I am saying , "
74208	74217	74205	74205	Sybilla	221	" will you please tell him , Jim ? "
74241	74252	74253	74253	he	181	" I do not think that I will , Sybilla , "
74257	74293	74253	74253	he	181	" I do not think he cares a straw whether your temperature goes up or down . I think that he does not come here because — because he has found metal more attractive elsewhere . "
74550	74559	74529	74529	Turin	298	" Write ; keep an eye upon him ! "
74560	74571	74583	74583	he	181	" Write ; keep an eye upon him ! Write ! "
74846	74859	74861	74861	Cecilia	222	" And then you wonder that I am anxious to be married , "
74896	74954	74956	74956	Jim	181	" I make no secret of it , I am madly anxious , I would marry anyone , I am desperate . Just think what my life will be when Amelia is gone ; and though of course I shall be a great deal with her — she has promised that I shall be almost always with her "
74957	74975	75058	75058	she	222	winces)—"yet of course it ca n't be the same thing as having a home of your own . "
74976	74985	74987	74987	he	181	" We will do our best for you , "
75000	75029	74987	74987	he	181	" but you know , my dear Cis , anybody can lead a horse to the water , but it is not so easy to make him drink . "
75030	75036	75038	75038	Cecilia	222	" That is quite true , "
75061	75142	75058	75058	she	222	" and I have no luck ; such promising things turn up , and then come to nothing . Now , that clergyman the other day , whom we met at the Villa Careggi — such a pleasant gentlemanlike man — he was on the look - out for a wife , he told me so himself , and I know so much about the working of a parish , and next day he was off , Heaven knows where ! "
75149	75162	75163	75163	he	181	" I do not think you had any great loss in him , "
75174	75223	75163	75163	he	181	" I mean , you know , that it is always said that a man is a better judge of another man than a woman is , and I did not like his looks ; give us time , and we will do better for you than that . "
75683	75709	75711	75711	Cecilia	222	" I am told that one of the brothers is an Englishman ; I did not hear his name , but he is certainly English , "
75728	75769	75711	75711	Cecilia	222	" If I send up word that I am a fellow - countrywoman , perhaps he will come out and speak to me ; I am sure that it would be a very nice change for him , poor fellow ! "
76329	76341	76342	76342	He	181	" Be on your guard ! we are close to you ! "
76448	76453	76455	76455	Cecilia	222	" What a coincidence ! "
76689	76705	76707	76707	Cecilia	222	" Did you come here all alone ? You two all alone ? What fun ! "
76743	76747	76749	76749	Elizabeth	193	" Alone?—oh no ! "
76776	76791	76749	76749	Elizabeth	193	" My mother is here — she came with us ; why , where is she?"—looking
76796	76803	76749	76749	Elizabeth	193	air—"she was here a moment ago . "
76855	76865	76867	76867	Byng	203	" Mrs. Le Marchant was here a moment ago , "
76874	76875	76867	76867	Byng	203	" but"—dodging
76879	76898	76867	76867	Byng	203	eyes—"she said she was a little stiff from sitting so long ; she must be quite close by . "
76899	76908	76910	76910	Elizabeth	193	" I will go and look for her , "
76941	76948	76949	76949	she	201	" Oh , do not stir ! "
76957	77010	76949	76949	she	201	" You look so comfortable . Let me go and search for Mrs. Le Marchant ; I — I — should be afraid to sit down , I am so hot . I should like to find her ; Cecilia will help me , and Mr. Byng will show us the way . "
77083	77090	77091	77091	she	201	" Will not you sit down ? "
77104	77116	77091	77091	she	201	" I do not know why I should invite you , as if"—glancing
77123	77130	77131	77131	He	181	panorama—"this were my drawing - room . "
77280	77293	77295	77295	Elizabeth	193	" You have not been to see us for a long time , "
77332	77335	77328	77328	He	181	" No . "
77506	77514	77493	77493	he	643	" Have you missed me very much ? "
77562	77584	77551	77551	she	193	" Oh , surely ! I must have missed you — you were so extraordinarily , so unaccountably kind to us ! "
77630	77644	77645	77645	he	643	" You must have been very little used to kindness all your life , "
77652	77663	77645	77645	he	643	" to be so disproportionately grateful for my trumpery civilities . "
77671	77676	77677	77677	she	700	" You are right , "
77680	77710	77677	77677	she	700	" I have not received any great kindness in my life — justice , well , yes , I suppose so — but no , not very much mercy . "
77762	77767	77768	77768	he	643	" I always think , "
77771	77804	77768	77768	he	643	" that there is something fatuous in a man 's apologizing to a lady for not having been to see her , as if the loss were hers , and not his . "
77805	77822	77768	77768	he	643	" Is there ? All the same , I am sorry that you did not come . "
78018	78022	78024	78024	Elizabeth	193	" I suppose , "
78032	78062	78024	78024	Elizabeth	193	" that the fact is , when people are in your position — I mean on the brink of a great deep happiness — they forget all lesser things ? "
78114	78117	78128	78128	her	193	" Perhaps . "
78118	78121	78128	78128	her	193	" The big fish"—her
78152	78163	78145	78145	she	193	gaze—"swallows up all the little gudgeons ! Poor little gudgeons . "
78164	78169	78170	78170	he	643	" Poor little gudgeons ! "
78186	78200	78202	78202	she	193	" And now I suppose you will be going directly — going home ? "
78215	78227	78202	78202	she	193	" I hope so ; and — and — you too ? "
78247	78266	78240	78240	her	193	" We — we ? Why should we go home ? We have nothing pleasant to go to , and"—looking
78283	78293	78297	78297	herself	193	grass—"we are so well — so infinitely well here ! "
78308	78356	78357	78357	She	193	" But yes , of course we , too , shall go by - and - by ; this can not last for ever — nothing lasts for ever . That is the one thought that has kept me alive all these years ; but now — — "
78361	78365	78357	78357	She	193	" But now ? "
78402	78406	78407	78407	she	193	" But now ? "
78422	78441	78407	78407	she	193	her—"But now ? Did I say ' But now ? ' Ah , here they are back again ! "
78442	78453	78455	78455	Amelia	201	" I am going to turn the tables on you , "
78500	78517	78518	78518	She	193	" you are always arranging treats for me ; now I have planned one for you ! "
78550	78555	78556	78556	he	181	" Indeed , dear ! "
78560	78583	78556	78556	he	181	" I do not quite know what I have done to deserve it ; but I hope it is a nice one . "
78584	78592	78617	78617	she	193	" It is very nice — delightful . "
78593	78598	78600	78600	he	181	" Delightful , eh ? "
78639	78658	78617	78617	she	193	" well , am I to guess what it is ? or are you going to tell me ? "
78681	78692	78694	78694	she	201	" We have never been at Vallombrosa , have we ? "
78696	78699	78694	78694	she	201	" Never . "
78700	78711	78617	78617	she	193	" Well , we are going there to - morrow . "
78712	78721	78723	78723	he	181	" Are we ? is that your treat ? "
78747	78755	78723	78723	he	181	" And we are not going alone . "
78756	78776	78617	78617	she	193	" There is nothing very exceptional in that ; Cecilia is mostly good enough to lend us her company . "
78777	78787	78792	78792	her	1671	" I am not thinking of Cecilia ; I have persuaded"—the
78793	78804	78792	78792	her	1671	cheeks—"I have persuaded some friends of yours to join us . "
78866	78872	78873	78873	she	1671	" You are not glad ? "
78877	78883	78873	78873	she	1671	" you are not pleased ? "
78926	78939	78946	78946	she	1671	" I — I — had rather have had you to myself . "
78940	78945	78946	78946	she	1671	" Would you really ? "
78988	79001	78946	78946	she	1671	" would you really ? then I am sorry I asked them ; but"—with
79003	79030	78946	78946	she	1671	wistfulness—"if you only knew how I long to give you a little pleasure , a little enjoyment — you who have given me so infinitely much . "
79108	79116	79098	79098	his	181	" Do I really make you happy ? "
79117	79119	79120	79120	she	1671	" Do you?"—echoes
79131	79157	79120	79120	she	1671	eyes—"I should not have thought it possible that so much joy could have been packed into any fortnight as I have had crammed into mine ! "
79588	79592	79596	79596	he	181	" stands rebuked . "
79981	80002	79975	79975	Elizabeth	193	" Oh , what honeysuckle ! I must have some ! I must get out ! Tell him to stop ! "
80121	80129	80130	80130	Amelia	201	" Are you going to change places ? "
80154	80166	80141	80141	he	181	" It will not be for long , dear ; but you know"—with
80189	80195	80173	80173	he	181	gatherers—"fair play is a jewel ! "
80231	80237	80239	80239	you	181	" Are you going to change places?"—adding—"do
80249	80814	80239	80239	you	181	" But probably he is too much occupied in wrestling with the stiff door to hear her , for he makes no answer beyond getting in . The only reward that he receives for his piece of self - sacrifice is a rapturous look of gratitude from Byng , when he perceives the changed position of his affairs , and that recompense Jim had far rather have been without . They are off again . Being now second in the little procession , Burgoyne has but meagre and difficult views of the first ; but now and again , when the road describes an acuter angle than usual , he can by turning his whole body , under pretext of admiring the view , snatch a glimpse of all three occupants leaning their heads sociably together , evidently in bright light talk . After all , he had deceived himself . It is he and not Amelia who had made her shy . Even when he can not see her , there come to his ears little wafts of laughter , in which her voice is mixed . He catches himself trying to recall whether she had laughed even once during the period of his being her companion . There is not much mirth in his own carriage . What a kill - joy he has grown ! Cecilia , though her heart is as pure as the babe unborn of any serious designs on Byng , of which indeed she has long seen the fruitlessness , yet thinks a sulky brother - in - law - elect but a poor exchange for a handsome young acquaintance , whom neither his good manners nor the amount of his intimacy allow to sit opposite to her in grumpy silence . Mrs. Le Marchant is obviously as ill at ease as was her daughter when in his fellowship , though in this case a little observation shows him that he counts for nothing in her discomfort of mind , but that she is watching the other half of the party with an anxiety as keen , if almost as covert , as his own . She is too well - bred indeed not to endeavour to keep up a decent show of conversation , but as neither of her companions makes any effort to second her , an ever - deepening silence falls upon them as they advance , nor , as the day grows older , is the weather calculated to exhilarate their spirits . The sky 's frown becomes more and more pronounced the higher they mount . Through a village nobly seated on its hilltop , but , like most Italian townlets , squalid enough on a nearer view — up and up — up and up — till they reach what were once groves of stately chestnuts , but where the hungry Tuscan axe has left nothing but twigs and saplings , but never a spreading tree ; then on into the fir - woods , which are woods indeed , though even here the hatchet 's cruel tooth has begun to bite . No sooner is their dark umbrage reached than the mist , that has been hanging with threatening lowness above the travellers ' heads , comes down close , blinding , clinging like wet flannel , and as thick . "
80820	80949	80239	80239	you	181	" Jim says , with a sort of dismal unlikely hopefulness as he strains his eyes , trying to look down the straight solemn fir aisles , with their files upon files of tall stems , that seem to be seen only as if through a thick gauze . Neither of his companions has the spirit necessary to echo the supposition . The road winds endlessly , steeper and steeper up through the mist . The tired horses step wearily , and the unfortunate pleasure - seekers are beginning to think that the muffled monotony of firs , of winding road , of painfully labouring horses , will never end , when the vetturino turns round with a smile on his fog - wet face , and says , "
80952	81720	80239	80239	you	181	" Under other circumstances , the announcement might have been cheering , might have excited a poetic curiosity ; but as it is , the hood of the vehicle — necessarily raised some miles back — is so far poked forward that nothing is to be seen but a pour of rain — the rain has begun to descend in torrents — a glass - door in a house - wall opening to admit them , and a waiter holding up a green umbrella to protect their descent . Neither he nor the landlord , nor yet the chambermaid , show any signs of mirth or wonder at their arrival among the clouds on such a day . They are used to mad Inglese . And amongst the mad Inglese themselves there is certainly no temptation to mad merriment . On such an occasion there is nothing to do but eat , so they lunch dismally in a long , bare dining - room , with a carpetless floor , a table laid for a grossly improbable number of guests , and a feeling of searching cold . Having spun out their scanty meal to the utmost limits of possibility , and washed it down with the weakest red wine that ever lived in a wicker bottle , they pass into a funereal salon , to which the waiter invites them . Someone makes the cheering announcement that they have as yet been here only half an hour , and that the horses must have two full hours to bait before there can be any question of beginning the return journey . And then they amble about the room , looking at the dreadful lithographs of Italy 's plain King and fair Queen on the walls ; at the venerable journals and gaudy English storybook , so dull as to have been forgotten by its owner , on the table . Their spirits are not heightened by a pervading sense as of being in a cellar , minus the wine . The equipment of this pleasant apartment is completed by a half - dead nosegay of what must once have been charming mountain blossoms . The sight decides them . They must go out . Perhaps even through this opaque cloud they may dimly see the mountain flowers growing , the mountain brooks dashing , which John Milton has told them that — They all catch at the suggestion , when made by Byng , and presently sally forth to see as much of Vallombrosa as a fog that would not have disgraced the Strand , as a close blanket of almost confluent rain , and as umbrellas held well down over their cold noses , will let them ; Mrs. Le Marchant alone declines to be one of the party , and is left sitting , swaddled in all the superfluous wraps , on a horsehair chair in the salon , to stare at the wall and at King Humbert 's ugly face , until such time as her companions see fit to release her . It is no wonder that Burgoyne overhears her eagerly whispering to Elizabeth a request that she will not stay too long away . And Elizabeth , whose spirits have gone up like a rocket at the prospect of a taste of the fresh air , and who knows what else , lays her little face , crowned with a deer - stalking cap , against her mother 's , and promises , and skips away . At first they all five keep together , wet but sociable . They ask their way to the Paradiso — the name sounds ironical — and set off climbing up through the fir - wood in the direction indicated ; along a path which in fair weather must be heavenly with piny odours , but which is now only a miry alternative of dripping stones and muddy puddles . Through the mist they see indeed fair flowers gleaming , yellow anemones , unfamiliar and lovely , but they are too drenched to pluck . The sound of falling water guides them to where the clear brook — clear even to - day — falls in little cascades down the hill 's face between the pines . How delicious to sit on its flat stones some hot summer 's noon , with your hands coolly straying among its grasses , or dabbling in its bright water ; but to - day they can but look at it sadly from the low bridge , saying sighingly , "
81723	81948	81949	81949	They	1719	" They reach the goal , some cross , and all floundering , the ladies with draggled skirts and cold , dank ankles . The Paradiso is a little house , a dépendance apparently of the hotel below — apparently also tenantless and empty . It is built on the bare rock , looking sheer down on — what ? on a blanket of fog . What does , what can , that maddening blanket conceal ? Oh , if they could but tear it in pieces , rend it asunder , hack it with knives , by any means abolish its unsightly veil from over the lovely face they will now , with all their climbing , all their early rising , never see ! But will not they ? Even as they look , despairingly straining their eyes , in the vain effort to pierce that obscure and baffling veil , there is a movement in it , a stirring of the inert mass of vapour ; a wind has risen , and is blowing coldly on their brows , and in a moment , as it seems , the maddening wet curtain is swept away and up , as by some God - hand , the hand of some spirit that has heard their lament and has pitied them and said , "
81968	82288	81962	81962	us	1720	" The curtain has rolled up and up , the sombre fir - wood starts out , and the emerald meadows , the lowest and nearest range of hills , then the next , and then the next , and then the furthest and highest of all . There they stand revealed , even the city , Florence , far away . They can make out her Duomo , small and dim with distance , yet certainly there ; in the sudden effulgence all the valley alight and radiant . Range behind range stand the hills ; belated vapour wreaths floating , thin as lawn , up their flanks ; wonderful dreamy patches of radiance on the far slopes ; marvellous amethysts starring their breasts . Mystery and beauty , colour and space , sky and lovely land , where , five minutes ago , there was nothing but choking fog . Burgoyne stands as in a trance , vaguely conscious — trance - wise too — that Elizabeth is near him ; all his soul passed into his eyes ; stands — how long ? He hardly knows . Before that fair sight time seems dead ; but even as he yet looks , smiling as one smiles at anything surpassingly lovely , the cloud - wreaths float downwards again , wreaths at first , then great volumes , then one universal sheet of vapour , impenetrably dense as before . Vanished are the Apennine slopes , sun - kissed and dreamy ; vanished the distant Arno plain ; vanished even the near pines . He can scarce see his hand before him . And yet he can see Elizabeth 's face transfigured and quivering , lifted to his — yes , to his — though Byng is on her other side ; her eyes full of tender tears of ravishment , while her low voice says sighingly : "
82311	82491	82560	82561	the others	3469	" And although the next moment she is reabsorbed into the fog and Byng , though for the rest of the deplorable walk he scarce catches sight again of the little brown head and the soaked deer - stalking cap , yet it makes a gentle warmth about his chilled heart to think that , in her moments of highest emotion , it is her impulse to turn to him . Not once again , so long as they remain at Vallombrosa , does the envious cloud - blanket lift ; and , after slopping about for some time longer , in the vain hope that it will , Burgoyne and his two female relatives - elect return to the inn , all fallen very silent . The other two members of the party have disappeared into the fog . At the door of the hotel they find Mrs. Le Marchant , who has broken from her cerements , and is looking anxiously out . As she catches sight of them the look of tension on her face lessens . "
82498	82502	82560	82561	the others	3469	" says she . "
82520	82521	82514	82515	the others	3469	" "
82529	82559	82560	82561	the others	3469	" replies Cecilia , with some ill - humour , taking upon her the office of spokeswoman , which neither of her companions seems in any hurry to assume ; "
82589	82657	82658	82658	I	0	" Amelia is to the full as wet as her sister ; nothing can well be more lamentable than the appearance of either ; and upon Amelia 's face there is , in addition to a handsome share of splashes of rain , a look of mortification and crestfallenness ; but she now puts in her word , with her usual patience and thoughtful good - temper . "
82672	82699	82700	82700	they	3469	" she says , observing the immediate relapse into what seems an exaggerated concern following instantly upon Cecilia 's remark on Mrs. Le Marchant 's features ; "
82735	82744	82726	82726	they	3469	" turning with an interrogative air to Burgoyne . "
82756	82777	82747	82747	they	3469	" he assents , not thinking it necessary to add why he is so very certain as to this fact . "
82790	82799	82778	82778	They	3469	" cries Cecilia , with an exasperated laugh . "
82839	82927	82828	82829	the chambermaid	4204	" With these words she walks towards the staircase and climbs it , leaving a muddy imprint on each step to mark her progress as she mounts . Amelia does not at once follow her example . She remains standing where she was , her arms hanging listlessly by her sides , and the expression of crestfallenness deepened on her fagged face . Her lover is touched by her look , and , going up to her , lays his hand kindly and solicitously on her shoulder . "
82938	82946	82947	82947	You	1730	" he says , trying to smile . "
82983	82994	82974	82975	the chambermaid	4204	" She lifts her eyes with wistful gratitude to his . "
83000	83005	83006	83006	my	0	" she says slowly ; "
83017	83053	83015	83015	Jim	181	" There is a depth of compassion in her tone as disproportioned to the apparent cause as had been Mrs. Le Marchant 's anxiety for her daughter 's return , and beneath it he winces . "
83060	83066	83056	83056	you	0	" he inquires half indignantly . "
83079	83083	83084	83084	You	0	" Adding cheerfully , "
83106	83107	83109	83109	ourselves	1733	" "
83116	83190	83191	83191	I	0	" echoes she , as if repeating a lesson ; and then she goes off docilely , in obedience to his suggestion , in search of dry raiment . He rejoins Mrs. Le Marchant , whose unaccountable fears have led her beyond the house 's shelter out into the rain , where she stands looking down that river of mud which represents the road by which she hopes to see the truants reappear . "
83198	83209	83193	83193	you	0	" he says , in a reassuring and remonstrating tone . "
83218	83245	83247	83247	she	0	" She does not answer , her eyes , into which the rain is beating under her umbrella brim , still fixed upon the empty road . "
83256	83273	83247	83247	she	0	" he asks , his own tone catching the infection of her vague and nameless disquiet . "
83289	83300	83281	83281	I	0	that!"—her composure breaking down into an unaffected outburst of distress . "
83351	83352	83334	83334	I	0	" "
83363	83427	83357	83357	I	0	" repeats Jim slowly , not at the first instant comprehending , nor even at the second quite taking in the full , though unintentional , uncomplimentariness of this speech ; which , however , before his companion again takes up her parable , has tinglingly reached — what ? His heart , or only his vanity ? They lie very close together . "
83438	83452	83357	83357	I	0	" pursues Mrs. Le Marchant , still in that voice of intense vexation . "
83474	83475	83476	83476	You	0	" "
83484	83489	83476	83476	You	0	" says Burgoyne gravely ; "
83503	83504	83496	83496	I	0	" "
83513	83528	83496	83496	I	0	" replies she , with an obvious effort to resume her usual courteous manner . "
83545	83546	83541	83541	you	0	" "
83553	83554	83549	83549	you	0	" "
83566	83573	83549	83549	you	0	" cries the poor woman agitatedly . "
83604	83605	83606	83606	I	0	" "
83611	83620	83606	83606	I	0	" he begins ; but she interrupts him . "
83626	83631	83640	83640	I	0	" she says remorsefully ; "
83647	83653	83645	83645	I	0	sure"—looking gratefully at him through the rain—"why
83678	83679	83681	83681	I	0	" "
83683	83701	83681	83681	I	0	" says he , with a melancholy air that does not argue much gratification at the compliment . "
83710	83719	83681	83681	I	0	" But she does not heed his disclaimer . "
83727	83732	83720	83720	We	1738	" she goes on ; "
83737	83752	83754	83754	Florence	20	here"—looking round with an involuntary smile at the envelope of wet vapour that encases them both—"but
83769	83774	83766	83766	you	0	know"—with an appealing touch of pathos—"what
83810	83841	83808	83808	you	0	" It is senseless of him ; but yet , little as he can comprehend why it should be so , the idea of Byng 's love being described as a "
83844	83883	83884	83884	I	0	" presents itself not disagreeably to his mind . For whatever mysterious reason , it is apparent that even Byng 's own mother can not be much more adverse to his suit than is the lady before him . "
83892	83900	83884	83884	I	0	" he answers , with sympathetic gravity ; "
83947	83948	83937	83937	they	1741	" "
83960	84279	83937	83937	they	1741	" she says , with an impatient sigh ; but she allows him to guide her and her umbrella back to the inn . Burgoyne 's prediction is not verified ; probably he had no very great faith in it himself . Mrs. Le Marchant 's back has , for the best part of an hour , been turned upon the mountain road , and the stragglers have not yet rejoined the main body . There has been plenty of time for Cecilia to be thoroughly dried , warmed , comforted , and restored to good humour ; for the vetturino to send in and ask whether he shall not put the horses to ; for Amelia to exhaust all her little repertory of soothing hypotheses ; for Mrs. Le Marchant to stray in restless misery from salon to salle - à - manger and back again , and for Burgoyne to pull gloomily at a large cigar in the hall by himself before at length the voices of the truants are heard . Burgoyne being , as I have said , in the hall , and therefore nearest the door of entrance , has the earliest sight of them . His first glance tells him that the blow apprehended by Mrs. Le Marchant has fallen . Of Elizabeth , indeed , he scarcely catches a glimpse , as she passes him precipitately , hurrying to meet her mother , who , at the sound of her voice , has come running into the outer room . But Byng ! Byng has not experienced so many very strong emotions in his short life as to have had much practice in veiling them from the eyes of others when they come , and the gauze now drawn over his intolerable radiance is of the thinnest description . Again that earnest desire to hit him hard assails the elder friend . "
84288	84294	84282	84282	you	1743	" cries the young man . "
84303	84330	84282	84282	you	1743	" replies Burgoyne ; and if the penalty had been death , he could not at that moment have added one syllable to the acrid assent . "
84335	84340	84341	84341	I	0	" asks Elizabeth tremulously ; "
84364	84459	84359	84359	I	0	" She looks with an engaging timidity of apology from one to other of the sulky countenances around her ; and Burgoyne stealing a look at her , their eyes meet . He is startled by the singularity of expression in hers . Whatever it denotes , it certainly is not the stupid simplicity of rapture to be read , in print as big as a poster 's , in Byng 's . And yet , among the many ingredients that go to make up that shy fevered beam , rapture is undoubtedly one . "
84473	84530	84466	84466	you	1743	" asks Cecilia , with a curiosity that is , considering the provocation given , not unjustifiable . They both reply vaguely that they had lost themselves , that they had gone deeper into the wood . It is obvious to the meanest intelligence that neither of them has the slightest idea where they have been . "
84544	84675	84531	84531	I	0	" says Burgoyne , in a matter - of - fact voice , glad of an excuse to absent himself . When he comes back , he finds the Le Marchants standing together in the window , talking in a low voice , and Byng hovering near them . It is evident to Jim that the elder woman has no wish for converse with the young man ; but in his present condition of dizzy exhilaration , he is quite unaware of that fact . He approaches her indeed ( as the unobserved watcher notes ) with a dreadful air of filial piety , and addresses her in a tone of apology it is true , but with a twang of intimacy that had never appeared in his voice before . "
84718	84727	84717	84717	you	1747	think"—with an excited laugh of triumph and a bright blush—"that
84735	84962	84717	84717	you	1747	" The speech is in extremely bad taste , since , whatever may be the posture of affairs between himself and Elizabeth , it is morally impossible that her mother can yet be enlightened as to it ; the familiarity of it is therefore premature and the jocosity ill - placed . No one can be more disposed to judge it severely than its unintended auditor ; but even he is startled by the effect it produces . Without making the smallest attempt at an answer , Mrs. Le Marchant instantly turns her shoulder upon the young man — a snub of which Jim would have thought so gentle - mannered a person quite incapable , and walks away from him with so determined an air that not even a person in the seventh heaven of drunkenness can mistake her meaning . Nor does Elizabeth 's conduct offer him any indemnification . She follows her mother a little more slowly ; and , as she passes Jim , he sees that she is shaking violently , and that her face is as white as chalk . A sort of generous indignation against the mother for spoiling the poor little soul 's first moments of bliss mixes curiously in his mind with a less noble satisfaction at the reflection that there are undoubtedly breakers ahead of Byng . "
84971	85191	85192	85192	She	1750	" cries Cecilia , as they all stand at the door while the two carriages drive up . No one answers . The arrangement seems planned by no one in particular , and yet , as he drives down the hill , Burgoyne finds himself sitting opposite the two Misses Wilson . He is thankful that the raised hood and unfurled umbrellas of the second equipage prevent his having any ocular evidence of the ecstasy that that wet leather and that dripping silk veil . But even this consolation is not long left him . As they leave the fir - wood , they come out of the clouds too , into clear , lower air . Hoods are pushed back and umbrellas shut . The horses , in good heart , with homeward - turned heads , pricked with emulation by another carriage ahead of them , trot cheerfully down the road — the road with all its bent - elbow turnings — down , down , into the valley beneath . But the clouds that have rolled away off the evening sky seem to have settled down with double density upon the spirit of Burgoyne and his companions . Even the fountain of Cecilia 's chatter is dried . Once she says suddenly à propos de bottes : "
85200	85207	85192	85192	She	1750	" To which Amelia quickly rejoins — "
85215	85375	85209	85209	she	1750	" It is almost the only remark she makes during the long drive , and Burgoyne is thankful to her for her silence . Conscious of and grateful for her magnanimity as he is , there is yet something that jars upon him in her intuition of his thoughts , and in her eager championship of that other woman . He looks out blankly at the flowers , wetly smiling from field and bank , at the endless garden of embracing vines and embraced mulberries , joining their young leafage ; at the stealing river and the verdurous hill - sides . In vain for him Italy 's spring laughter broadens across the eternal youth of her face . On reaching Florence and the Anglo - Américain , he would fain enter and spend the evening with his betrothed . He has a feverish horror of being left alone with his own thoughts , but she gently forbids him . "
85386	85390	85209	85209	she	1750	" she says . "
85432	85496	85497	85497	She	0	say"—smiling—"that there is nothing very new in that ; but I am quite beyond even my usual mark to - night . Good - night , dear ; I humbly beg your pardon for having caused you to spend such a wretched day . I will never give you another treat — never , never ! it was my first and last attempt . "
85852	85855	85842	85842	he	1754	" Already ? "
85856	85862	85864	85864	Byng	203	" I was sent away , "
85880	85948	85864	85864	Byng	203	" they sent me away — they would not let me go further than the house - door . I say ' they , ' but of course she had no hand in it — she , not she . She would not have sent me away , God bless her ! it was her mother , of course — how could she have had the heart ? "
85962	85965	85864	85864	Byng	203	" she , "
85983	85988	85864	85864	Byng	203	" God bless her , "
85996	86006	86008	86008	Byng	203	" But I do not blame Mrs. Le Marchant , "
86019	86041	86008	86008	Byng	203	" Who would not wish to monopolize her ? Who would not grudge the earth leave to kiss her sweet foot ? "
86050	86055	86095	86095	she	1765	" replies Burgoyne dryly ; "
86066	86093	86059	86059	your	181	" But to speak to the young man now is of as much avail as to address questions or remonstrances to one walking in his sleep . "
86127	86143	86124	86124	I	0	" But Burgoyne 's phial of patience is for the present emptied to the dregs . "
86208	86247	86248	86248	I	0	" The sarcastic words , ill - natured and unsympathetic as they sound in their own speaker 's ears , yet avail to bring the young dreamer but a very few steps lower down his ladder of bliss . "
86253	86260	86250	86250	your	181	" he says sweet - temperedly ; "
86289	86290	86272	86272	I	0	" "
86303	86329	86299	86299	I	0	" growls Burgoyne , struggling to conquer , or at least tone down , the intense irritability of nerves that his friend 's flights provoke . "
86365	86391	86395	86395	I	0	" The question , sobering in its tendency , has yet for sole effect the setting Byng off again with spread pinions into the empyrean . "
86398	86409	86410	86410	You	181	" he repeats , in a dreamy tone of ecstasy . "
86430	86461	86420	86420	anyone	3161	" He pauses a moment or two , steeped in a rapture of oblivious reverie , then goes on , still as one only half waked from a beatific vision : "
86518	86519	86490	86490	you	181	" "
86528	86529	86490	86490	you	181	" "
86537	86550	86490	86490	you	181	wood"—his voice sinking , as that of one who approaches a Holy of Holies—"when
86625	86626	86627	86627	I	0	" "
86642	86651	86652	86652	I	0	" interrupts Burgoyne , in a hard voice ; "
86697	86732	86690	86692	Miss Le Marchant	240	" Byng brings his eyes , which have been lifted in a sort of trance to the ceiling , down to the prosaic level of his Mentor 's severe and tight - lipped face . "
86741	86752	86734	86734	you	181	" he says , in an awed half - whisper , "
86792	86815	86817	86817	you	181	" Burgoyne had known perfectly well that it was coming ; but yet how much worse is it than he had expected ! "
86825	86851	86852	86852	She	240	" But Byng has apparently fled back on the wings of fantasy into the wet woods of Vallombrosa , for he makes no verbal answer . "
86856	86872	86852	86852	She	240	" asks Burgoyne , raising his voice , as if he were addressing someone deaf . "
86882	86901	86902	86902	I	0	" At the sound of that hard naked query the dreamer comes out of his enchanted forest again . "
86918	86946	86914	86914	she	240	" he answers , murmuring the words laggingly ; while , as he goes on , the fire of his madness spires high in his flashing eyes . "
86979	87005	87059	87059	She	240	" There is a moment 's pause , broken only by the commonplace sound of an electric bell rung by some inmate of the hotel . "
87016	87029	87008	87010	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" inquires Jim presently , with an irony he can not restrain . "
87057	87058	87059	87059	She	240	" "
87070	87097	87067	87067	she	240	" cries Byng , whose drunkenness shares with the more ordinary kind the peculiarity of believing whatever he wishes to be not only probable but inevitable . "
87146	87147	87156	87156	you	0	" "
87193	87194	87177	87177	You	0	" "
87199	87212	87177	87177	You	0	" answers Byng slowly , and with a slight diminution of radiance . "
87249	87250	87243	87243	she	240	" "
87255	87256	87243	87243	she	240	" "
87294	87300	87311	87311	you	1780	perfect"—the intoxication getting the upper hand again—"driving
87332	87339	87311	87311	you	1780	face!"—his voice breaking into a tremor . "
87360	87483	87345	87345	Jim	181	" Burgoyne has all the time had his brushes in his hand , the brushes with which he has been preparing himself for his solitary dinner . He bangs them down now on the table . How can he put a period to the ravings of this maniac ? And yet not so maniac either . What gives the sharpest point to his present suffering is the consciousness that he would have made quite as good a maniac himself if he had had the chance . This consciousness instils a few drops of angry patience into his voice , as , disregarding the other 's high - flown question , he puts one that is not at all high - flown himself . "
87494	87533	87489	87491	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" But the smile that the memory — so fresh , only half an hour old — of Elizabeth 's loveliness has laid upon Byng 's lips still lingers there ; and makes his response dreamy and vague . "
87624	87746	87620	87620	I	0	" He stops , his words dying away into a whisper , his throat 's too narrow passage choked by the rushing ocean of his immense felicity . Burgoyne looks at him in silence , again with a sort of admiration mixed with wrath . How has this commonplace , pink - and - white boy managed to scale such an altitude , while he himself , in all his life , though with a better intelligence , and , as he had thought , with a deeper heart , had but prowled around the foot ? Why should he try to drag him down ? On the peak of that great Jungfrau of rapture no human foot can long stand . "
87762	87766	87752	87754	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" pursues Byng . "
87851	87855	87849	87849	you	1782	" Burgoyne hesitates . "
87863	87894	87899	87899	her	189	" continues Byng , his sun breaking out again in full brilliancy from the very little cloud that , during his last sentence or two , had dimmed its lustre , "
87926	88045	87911	87917	the burglar who has broken open one	1786	" Burgoyne still hesitates . Shall he tell the young ranter before him what excellent reasons he has for knowing that any filial disposition on his part to throw himself on Mrs. Le Marchant 's neck will be met by a very distinct resistance on that lady 's part , or shall he leave him poised on till morning ? The morning light will certainly see him tumbling at the least some few kilometres down . He decides generously to leave him in present possession of his peak ; but yet , so inconsistent is human nature , his next speech can have no drift but that of giving a slight jog to his friend 's towering confidence . "
88051	88087	87911	87917	the burglar who has broken open one	1786	" It may generally be concluded that a person has not a very pertinent response to give to a question if his only answer to that question be to repeat it in the same words . "
88092	88093	88088	88090	My own mother	1789	" "
88108	88127	88096	88096	you	1787	" For a second the young man 's forehead clouds , then he breaks into an excited laugh . "
88174	88175	88176	88176	I	0	" "
88178	88179	88176	88176	I	0	" "
88184	88212	88176	88176	I	0	Cecilia"—quite unaware , in his excitement , of the freedom he is taking , for the first time in his life , with those young ladies ' Christian names—"tell
88284	88295	88271	88271	she	1076	consent!"—laughing again with that bubbling - over of superfluous joy . "
88338	88368	88328	88328	we	1801	" Burgoyne feels that one more mention of that wood will convert him into a lunatic , quite as indisputable as his companion , only very much more dangerous . "
88371	88376	88328	88328	we	1801	" he says grimly . "
88392	88393	88381	88381	you	1799	" "
88402	88430	88431	88431	she	1076	either"—possibly dimly perceiving , even through the golden haze of his own glory , the lack of enjoyment of his last piece of news conveyed by Jim 's tone—"for
88460	88509	88453	88453	she	1076	" The adjective , as applied to himself by Elizabeth and her mother , has not the merit of novelty in the hearer 's ears , which is perhaps the reason why the elation that he must naturally feel on hearing it does not translate itself into words . "
88513	88523	88453	88453	she	1076	" repeats Byng , apparently pleased with the epithet . "
88554	88555	88552	88552	you	1799	" "
88572	88579	88556	88556	I	0	" answers Burgoyne , rather sadly ; "
88595	88599	88590	88590	I	0	Joy"—repeating the word over reflectively—"it
88608	88625	88626	88626	You	0	" The extreme dampness of his tone arrests for a few minutes Byng 's jubilant pæan . "
88640	88652	88626	88626	You	0	" he asks presently , in a changed and hesitating key . "
88666	88667	88668	88668	I	0	" "
88673	88677	88662	88662	she	1063	yet"—with an accent of stupefaction—"it
88717	88718	88744	88744	she	1063	" "
88726	88727	88744	88744	she	1063	" "
88730	88734	88744	88744	she	1063	think"—with a gleam of hope—"that
88770	88776	88756	88756	she	1063	" Burgoyne shakes his head . "
88779	88799	88756	88756	she	1063	" he says , with the slowness of a man who is saying what he himself does not believe , "
88825	88826	88816	88818	Miss Le Marchant	240	" "
88829	88844	88816	88818	Miss Le Marchant	240	" cries Byng , with almost a shout of angry derision at the suggestion . "
88894	88895	88890	88890	their	1806	" "
88898	88903	88890	88890	their	1806	" replies Burgoyne gruffly . "
88926	88956	88910	88910	she	240	" though , even as he speaks , he realizes that to him this is almost as incredible as to the young madman whom he is so pitilessly snubbing . "
88986	88987	88966	88966	you	0	" "
88994	89015	88990	88990	you	0	" replies Byng , out of whose voice his kind Mentor has at last succeeded in momentarily conjuring the exaltation . "
89081	89082	89083	89083	You	0	" "
89093	89097	89083	89083	You	0	" interjects Jim . "
89120	89138	89101	89101	her	240	" After a pause , his voice taking on again its inflection of confident , soaring triumph : "
89282	89379	89380	89380	I	0	" As Burgoyne is conscious of not being in a position to answer this question with much satisfaction to himself , he leaves it unanswered . A new day has awaked , and Firenze , fresh - washed after yesterday 's rain , smelling through all her streets of lilies , laughs up , wistaria - hung , to a fleckless sky . If poor Amelia had but deferred her treat for twenty - four hours , what a different Vallombrosa would she and her companions have carried home in their memories ! Amelia 's treat ! "
89391	89406	89407	89407	I	0	" Burgoyne says to himself , as he sits appetiteless over his solitary breakfast . "
89419	89997	89407	89407	I	0	" As he makes this reflection , he rises with some alacrity , and , leaving his scarcely - tasted coffee and his not - at - all - tasted omelette , walks out of the salle - à - manger . His motive for so early a visit to the Anglo - Américain is less an excessive eagerness to proclaim his piece of news than the thought that by so doing he will , at least for a few hours , escape the necessity of being in his young friend 's company . As to where that young friend at present is , whether , after having wandered about the town all night , he is now sleeping late , or whether he is already off to persecute poor Mrs. Le Marchant for that maternal blessing which she has so little inclination to give , Jim is ignorant . All he knows is that such another dose of Byng 's erotic eloquence as he had to swallow last night will leave him ( Burgoyne ) either a murderer or suicide . Owing to his arrival at the Anglo - Américain so much sooner than usual , he finds himself coming in for the ceremony of Sybilla 's installation for the day in the drawing - room . There is always a little pomp and fussy bustle about this rite . Sybilla totters in ( grave doubts have occasionally crossed the minds of her family as to whether she does not in reality possess a pair of excellent and thoroughly dependable legs ) , supported on one side by Amelia and on the other by her maid . Cecilia goes before with an air cushion , and Mr. Wilson follows , when he does not turn restive — which is sometimes the case — with a duvet . To - day , as I have said , this rite is in full celebration when Jim arrives , but it is being performed with mutilated glories . The rite is going forward , but the high priest is absent . That ministrant , upon whose arm the sufferer is wo nt to lean far the most heavily ; she upon whom devolves the whole responsibility of arranging the three cushions behind the long limp back ; the properly covering the languid feet ; the nice administering of the reviving cordial drops that are to repair the fatigue of the transit from bedroom to sitting - room — that most important and unfailing ministrant is nowhere to be seen . No artist wishes his picture to be viewed in an inchoate , unfinished stage , nor is Sybilla at all anxious to have the public admitted to the sight of that eminent work of art herself until she is stretched in faint , moribund , graceful completeness on her day - bed . At the moment of Burgoyne 's entry she has just reached that unbecoming point , where she is sitting sideways on her sofa , before her wasted limbs — Burgoyne is one of those heretics who have never believed that they are wasted — have been carefully lifted into their final posture of extension upon the Austrian blanket . It is , of all moments , the one at which interruption is least welcome ; nor is the intruder at all surprised at being greeted by the invalid with a more than sub - acid accent . "
90021	90024	90014	90016	the early bird	1817	not"—with an annoyed laugh—"give
90036	90037	90038	90038	I	0	" "
90048	90078	90079	90079	I	0	" replies he , his eyes wandering away from the fretful features before him in search of others upon which he knows he shall find written no complaint of his prematureness—"but
90087	90088	90089	90089	You	0	" "
90094	90105	90089	90089	You	0	" replies Sybilla , with a sort of hysterical laugh . "
90189	90190	90180	90180	you	222	" "
90195	90242	90180	90180	you	222	" repeats Burgoyne hastily , both because he wants to know , and because he is anxious to strangle in its infancy one of those ignoble family bickerings , to assist at many of which has been the privilege or penalty of his state of intimacy . "
90248	90285	90180	90180	you	222	" replies Cecilia shortly , her rosy face rosier than usual , either with the joy of imminent battle , or with the exertion of swaddling , under protest , the invalid 's now elevated legs . "
90293	90338	90289	90289	Amelia	201	" echoes he , in a tone of incredulity . During all the years of their acquaintance not once has he heard his patient sweetheart complain of ache or pain . Manlike , he has therefore concluded that she can never have felt either . "
90346	90366	90289	90289	Amelia	201	" says Cecilia , with a not altogether amiable laugh , and giving a final irritated slap to Sybilla 's coverlet—"considering
90404	90405	90399	90399	she	201	" "
90409	90410	90399	90399	she	201	" "
90434	90435	90411	90411	She	201	" "
90451	90452	90453	90453	She	201	" "
90517	90549	90507	90507	Amelia	201	" This would be an even handsomer tribute to Amelia than it is , if it did not suggest a secondary intention of administering a back - hander to someone else . "
90557	90591	90507	90507	Amelia	201	" says Mr. Wilson , making his voice heard for the first time from the window , where he is discontentedly peering up and down the sheets of a journal through his spectacles , "
90608	90640	90507	90507	Amelia	201	" Mr. Wilson likes his eldest daughter . He is uneasy and upset , and rather angry at her indisposition , and this is his way of showing his paternal tenderness . "
90644	90673	90674	90674	Amelia	201	" The human animal is the most adaptive of created beings ; but even it requires some little time to adjust itself to entirely new conditions of existence . "
90676	90695	90674	90674	Amelia	201	" continues Mr. Wilson , fanning the flame of his ire with the bellows of his own rhetoric , "
90725	90726	90727	90727	You	1829	" "
90739	90746	90727	90727	You	1829	" says Cecilia , with an indignant laugh—"as
90760	90768	90752	90752	I	0	Sybilla"—with a resentful side - glance at the sofa—"could
90792	90793	90785	90785	her	201	" "
90797	90810	90811	90811	you	3390	" cries Jim , his bewildered surprise swallowed up in genuine alarm ; "
90825	90881	90882	90882	My	0	" Sybilla laughs , and even in the midst of his real anxiety , Burgoyne has time for the reflection that the Wilson family seem this morning to have se donné le mot to show in how many different styles it is possible to be merry without the least tinge of genuine mirth in any . "
90960	91019	91020	91020	You	0	" This speech is uttered with the accent of such entire conviction that it ought to carry reassurance into the heart of the person to whom it is addressed . Sybilla really and honestly disbelieves in the reality of any claims but her own to sincere sickness . But Jim unreasonably neither is nor feigns to be reassured . "
91034	91055	91031	91032	Dr. Coldstream	297	" he asks rapidly of the two sound members of the family , turning his back unceremoniously upon the invalid . "
91066	91083	91056	91056	I	0	" answers Cecilia , her own latent anxiety quickened by the evident alarm of her interlocutor , "
91104	91105	91085	91085	Sybilla	221	" "
91115	91144	91108	91108	he	297	" puts in Sybilla in a piano voice , that shows an evident desire to assert her threatened position of prime and only genuine invalid , a sort of "
91148	91151	91108	91108	he	297	" tone ; "
91204	91205	91187	91187	he	297	" "
91211	91219	91187	91187	he	297	" inquires Jim , with some heat , "
91247	91259	91245	91245	you	0	" turning with an earnest appeal in his eyes to Cecilia ; "
91313	91314	91334	91334	you	0	" "
91322	91328	91317	91318	Dr. Coldstream	297	" says Mr. Wilson irritably ; "
91380	91381	91334	91334	you	0	" "
91389	91420	91383	91383	you	0	" says Jim , a shade relieved at having at last succeeded in rousing Amelia 's relations to prompt action , and feeling a feverish desire to be doing something , "
91450	91451	91453	91453	you	0	" "
91460	91485	91487	91487	you	0	" asks Sybilla , as Jim hustles Cecilia to her writing - table , and stands , nervously fidgeting beside her as she writes ; "
91544	91545	91546	91546	You	0	" "
91560	91780	91546	91546	You	0	" cries Jim , hanging tiresomely over Cecilia , rather impeding her than the reverse by his impatience , and leaving entirely unnoticed Sybilla 's observation , which indeed has been uttered more to preserve her own self - respect than with much hope that in the present wrong - headed state of mind of her family any member will pay much heed to it . In five minutes more , Jim , with Cecilia 's note in his pocket , is being borne rapidly in a fiacre through the sweet , gay streets . But , drive as rapidly as he may , he is not quick enough to intercept the popular English doctor , who , although , as his servant tantalizingly informs Jim , he is almost always at home at that hour , has , on this occasion , been sent for to an urgent case of sudden illness out of Florence , at the village of Peretola . Jim has to content himself with the assurance that immediately on his return the note will be given him ; and with this unsatisfactory intelligence Mr. Burgoyne reappears at the Anglo - Américain . He finds the three persons whom he had left much as he had quitted them — uneasy , cross , and unemployed . "
91792	91803	91811	91811	I	0	" says Cecilia , harking back to her old cry . "
91828	91829	91933	91933	you	0	" "
91840	91866	91933	91933	you	0	" interrupts Burgoyne impatiently , and wincing at these philippics against his poor bride 's miserable treat as if they had been directed against herself . "
91881	91887	91888	91888	I	0	" pursues the young lady . "
91908	91931	91933	91933	you	0	" Her large prominent eyes are fixed upon Jim as she speaks with a sort of knowingness overlying their former lugubrious expression . "
91942	91964	91933	91933	you	0	" inquires he , pronouncing both names with a laboured distinctness , while his voice sounds to himself loud and wooden . "
91993	92020	91979	91979	Byng	251	" If the essence of a good piece of news is to surprise , Jim can certainly not flatter himself that his comes under that head . "
92031	92037	91979	91979	Byng	251	" is Cecilia 's comment . "
92082	92087	92092	92093	some people	1848	me!"—with a good - sized sigh—"how
92113	92154	92224	92224	her	222	" She pauses , and it is plain to those acquainted with her heart history that her thoughts are coursing mournfully back to the all - along reluctant and ultimately entirely faithless clergyman who had last possessed her young affections . "
92163	92182	92224	92224	her	222	" cries Jim hotly , jarred more than he would like to own to himself by this phrase . "
92199	92214	92216	92216	Cecilia	222	" Do you mean to say that you think it will not come off ? "
92275	92286	92291	92291	her	221	" I am sure he would make a delightful husband , "
92321	92352	92291	92291	her	221	" he has such gentle , feminine ways ; he comes into a room so quietly , and when he asks one how one is really listens for the answer . "
92353	92365	92367	92367	Cecilia	222	" Perhaps you are right , and it will fall through , "
92370	92375	92367	92367	Cecilia	222	" many engagements do ! "
92381	92410	92367	92367	Cecilia	222	" She is a sweet , pretty creature , and looks as if butter would not melt in her mouth ; but she is evidently older than he . "
92411	92422	92424	92424	Sybilla	221	" Jim will not allow that to be an objection , "
92431	92449	92424	92424	Sybilla	221	" will you , Jim ? How much older than you is Amelia ? I always forget . "
92450	92462	92464	92464	Cecilia	222	" I never can help thinking that she has a history , "
92471	92526	92464	92464	Cecilia	222	" and that Mr. Greenock knows it . If ever her name is mentioned he always begins to look wise , as if there were something that he was longing to tell one about her ; it is continually on the tip of his tongue — some day it will tumble over the tip . "
92527	92544	92546	92546	Jim	181	" I do not think that there is any use in my staying all this while ! "
92551	92595	92546	92546	Jim	181	" Dr. Coldstream can not be here at soonest for another hour ; and I do not think that we are , any of us , very good company for each other to - day , so I will look in again later . "
92881	92884	92875	92875	she	193	" lovely well "
93439	93446	93436	93436	he	251	" The Signora ? The Signorina ? "
93462	93465	93449	93449	her	264	" Gone ! "
93466	93475	93459	93459	her	264	" Gone ? You mean gone out driving ? "
93496	93500	93490	93490	he	251	" En fiacre ? "
93535	93540	93503	93503	her	264	" No , gone ! "
93541	93547	93549	93549	he	251	" But where ? Dove ? "
93571	93582	93566	93566	she	264	" I do not know ; they did not say . "
93597	93602	93604	93604	her	264	" When ? Quando ? "
93924	93930	93939	93945	the person to whom it is addressed	4374	" What does this mean ? "
94115	94123	94125	94125	he	251	" turning on the water - works , "
94200	94202	94151	94151	he	251	" masher "
94240	94246	94248	94248	Burgoyne	181	" What does it mean ? "
94283	94285	94272	94272	he	181	" gone "
94328	94336	94337	94337	he	181	" Why do you look like that ? "
94354	94361	94337	94337	he	181	" Why do not you speak ? "
94389	94396	94399	94399	Burgoyne	181	" What does that paper mean ? "
94419	94438	94439	94439	He	181	" what is it ? what does it say ? Does it — does it — explain anything ? "
94465	94477	94478	94478	he	181	" It is the first letter I ever had from her , "
94600	94650	94592	94592	he	181	" Good - bye , I was mad yesterday . I shall never marry you ; I have no right to marry anyone . For God 's sake do not ask me what I mean ; and oh ! do n't , do n't , DON'T come after me ! "
94833	94863	94877	94879	the other sadly	1899	" It is not her doing ! You may think it is her doing , but I know it is not ! I know her better than you do . "
94864	94875	94877	94879	the other sadly	1899	" I never made any pretensions to knowing her well , "
94892	94901	94903	94903	Byng	251	" Is it likely , I ask you ? "
94906	94956	94903	94903	Byng	251	" I put it to you fairly : is it likely that she , with her seraph nature , all love and burning , she that is tender over drowning flies , would have put me to this horrible pain?—O God , you do not know what pain it is "
94958	94963	95011	95011	his	251	" Do not I ? "
94964	94970	95011	95011	his	251	aside]—"of her own free will ? "
94971	94988	94990	94990	Byng	251	" I do not know ; as you say , I do not know her well . "
95076	95083	95087	95087	his	251	" But what am I saying ? "
95096	95204	95205	95205	Jim	181	" It was not she ! If I thought it were she , could I live a moment ? It is her mother ; no sane person can doubt that it is her mother 's doing ! She was always so sweetly docile , and her mother has conceived some prejudice against me . Did not I tell you how barbarously she shut the door upon me last night?—shut the door of my heaven in my face just as I thought I had won the right to enter it . Who would not have thought that it was won who had seen us together in the wood ? "
95208	95217	95205	95205	Jim	181	" Oh , never mind the wood now ! "
95218	95257	95258	95258	Jim	181	" Someone has prejudiced her against me , but who ? I did not know that I had an enemy in the world . Someone has told her about — about Oxford — about my being sent down . "
95262	95270	95258	95258	Jim	181	" If it is only that — — "
95281	95287	95258	95258	Jim	181	" It is not that . "
95288	95338	95205	95205	Jim	181	" Someone has put a spoke in my wheel ; but who ? You are the only person who could , and you , dear old chap , are the last person who would , though you were not very encouraging to me last night ! You did not ? "
95377	95390	95393	95394	the admission—"I	4420	" No , I did not put a spoke in your wheel ; but"—his
95394	95417	95418	95418	Byng	251	admission—"I am not at all so sure that I am the last person who would have done so , if I could . "
95465	95480	95481	95481	he	251	" It seems blasphemy to say so of anything that came from her hand , "
95494	95529	95481	95481	he	251	" but it reads like nonsense , does it not ? ' I shall never marry you ! I have no right to marry anyone ! ' No right ? what does she mean ? "
95536	95542	95481	95481	he	251	" How can I tell ? "
95543	95549	95481	95481	he	251	" Do you think it is possible"—lifting
95558	95593	95481	95481	he	251	friend—"it is a dreadful hypothesis , but I can think of no other — that that bright intelligence was clouded — that — that her dear little wits were touched when she wrote this ? "
95594	95603	95481	95481	he	251	" No , I do not think so . "
95604	95613	95481	95481	he	251	" You — you are not keeping anything from me?"—coming
95624	95677	95481	95481	he	251	arm—"you — you do not know anything — anything that could throw light upon — upon this ? I do not know whether you are conscious of it , but there is something in your manner that might lead me to that conclusion . Do you know — have you heard anything ? "
95678	95683	95685	95685	Jim	181	" I know nothing , "
95696	95711	95685	95685	Jim	181	" but I conjecture , I fear , I believe that — that — — "
95712	95726	95481	95481	he	251	" That what ? For God 's sake , be a little quicker ! "
95727	95743	95685	95685	Jim	181	" That — that — there is a — a — something in her past . "
95761	95778	95755	95755	his	251	" What — what do you mean ? What are you talking about ? Her past ? What"—soaring
95781	95804	95481	95481	he	251	again—"what can there be written on that white page?—so white that it bedazzles the eyes of even the angels who read it . "
95805	95814	95816	95816	Jim	181	" I do not know what there is , "
95855	95894	95481	95481	he	251	" How many times must I tell you that I know no more than you , only from — from various indications I have been led to believe that she has something — some great sorrow behind her ? "
95918	95934	96125	96125	Jim	181	" What — what do you mean ; what — what sort of a sorrow ? "
95935	95945	95946	95946	Byng	251	" I tell you , I do not know . "
95971	95978	95979	95979	he	251	" I will go to her , "
95982	96028	95979	95979	he	251	" if sorrow has the audacity to approach her again , it will have to reckon with me . There is no sorrow , none , in the whole long gamut of woe , for which love such as mine is not a balm . Reciprocal love!"—trailing
96036	96053	95979	95979	he	251	rapture—"no one that had seen her in the wood could have doubted that it was reciprocal . "
96054	96061	95979	95979	he	251	" No doubt , no doubt . "
96062	96067	95979	95979	he	251	" I will go to her!"—clasping
96073	96108	95979	95979	he	251	air—"I will pour the oil and spikenard of my adoration into her gaping wounds ! I will kiss the rifts together , though they yawn as wide as hell — yes , I will . "
96109	96122	96125	96125	Jim	181	" For heaven 's sake , do not talk such dreadful gibberish , "
96158	96195	95979	95979	he	251	" It is a knockdown blow for you , I own , and I would do what I could to help you ; but if you will keep on spouting and talking such terrible bosh — — "
96196	96207	96209	96209	Byng	251	" I suppose I am making an ass of myself , "
96221	96242	96243	96243	his	251	" I beg your pardon , I am sure , old man . I have no right to victimize you , "
96254	96378	96379	96379	He	1907	" but you see it is so horribly sudden . If you had seen her when I parted from her last night at the door ! She lingered a moment behind Mrs. Le Marchant — just a moment , just time enough to give me one look , one wordless look . She did not speak ; she was so divinely dutiful and submissive that nothing would have persuaded her by the lightest word to imply any censure of her mother ; but she gave me just a look , which said plainly , ' It is not my fault that you are turned away ! I would have welcomed you in ! ' Upon that look I banqueted in heaven all night . "
96384	96387	96379	96379	He	1907	" Well ? "
96388	96496	96567	96567	him	1908	" And then this morning , when I got here — I think I ran all the way ; I am sure I did , for I saw people staring at me as I passed — to be met by Annunziata with the news that they were gone ! I did not believe her ; I laughed in her face , and then she grew angry , and bid me come in and see for myself ! And I rushed past her , in here , with my arms stretched out , confident that in one short moment more she would be filling them , and instead of her"—dropping
96505	96507	96379	96379	He	1907	groan—"I find this!"—dashing
96512	96546	96547	96547	He	1908	floor—"all that she leaves me to fill my embrace instead of her is this poor little pillow , that still seems to keep a faint trace of the perfume of her delicate head ! "
96588	96604	96564	96564	Jim	181	" When did they go ? at what hour ? last night or this morning ? "
96605	96613	96564	96564	Jim	181	" This morning early , quite early . "
96614	96622	96564	96564	Jim	181	" They have left all their things behind them"—looking
96638	96639	96564	96564	Jim	181	" Yes"—lifting
96646	96697	96564	96564	Jim	181	cushion—"and at first , seeing everything just as usual , even to her very workbasket — she has left her very workbasket behind — I was quite reassured . I felt certain that they could have gone for only a few hours — for the day perhaps ; but — — "
96701	96704	96564	96564	Jim	181	" Yes ? "
96705	96727	96564	96564	Jim	181	" They left word that their things were to be packed and sent after them to an address they would give . "
96728	96739	96564	96564	Jim	181	" And you do not know where they have gone ? "
96740	96762	96564	96564	Jim	181	" I know nothing , nothing , only that they are gone . Oh ! oh ! ! oh ! ! ! "
96763	96785	96564	96564	Jim	181	" You never heard them speak of their plans , mention any place they intended to move to on leaving Florence ? "
96786	96789	96564	96564	Jim	181	" Never ! "
96790	96798	96800	96800	Jim	181	" It is too late for Rome , "
96803	96811	96800	96800	Jim	181	" England ? I hardly think England , "
96824	96839	96564	96564	Jim	181	" Why should we go home ? We have nothing pleasant to go to . "
96840	96850	96852	96852	Byng	251	" I do not think they had any plans , "
96865	96901	96852	96852	Byng	251	" they never seemed to me to have any . She was so happy here , so gay , there never was anything more lovely than her gaiety , except — except — her tenderness . "
96902	96918	96564	96564	Jim	181	" Yes , yes , no doubt . Then you are absolutely without a clue ? "
96919	96922	96564	96564	Jim	181	" Absolutely . "
96923	96953	96564	96564	Jim	181	" Do you mean to say that up to yesterday — all through yesterday , even — she never gave you a hint of any intention of leaving Florence ? "
96954	96967	96969	96969	he	1908	" Never , never . On the contrary , in the — — "
96974	96978	96969	96969	he	1908	" the wood , "
96986	97006	96969	96969	he	1908	" we were planning many more such expeditions as yesterday 's . At least , I was planning them . "
97007	97012	96564	96564	Jim	181	" And she assented ? "
97013	97029	97030	97030	Jim	181	" She did not dissent . She met me with a look of divine acquiescence . "
97059	97063	97064	97064	his	1908	" What powers of hell"—banging
97070	97138	96564	96564	Jim	181	again—"could have wrought such a hideous change in so few hours ? Only ten ! for it was eight in the evening before I left them , and they were off at six this morning . They could have seen no one ; they had received no letters , no telegrams , for I inquired of Annunziata , and she assured me that they had not . Oh no!"—lifting
97148	97196	96564	96564	Jim	181	it—"there is only one tenable hypothesis about it — it is not her doing at all . She wrote this under pressure . It is her handwriting , is it not?—though I would not swear even to that . I — I have played the mischief with my eyes"—pulling
97207	97224	96564	96564	Jim	181	them—"so that I can not see properly ; but it is hers , is not it ? "
97225	97243	97256	97256	his	251	" I do not know ; I never saw her handwriting ; she never wrote to me . "
97244	97252	97254	97254	Byng	251	" It was evidently dictated to her , "
97265	97332	97254	97254	Byng	251	" there are clear traces , even in the very way the letters are formed , of its being written to order reluctantly . She did it under protest . See how her poor little hand was shaking , and she was crying all the while , bless her ! There , do not you see a blister on the paper — here on this side ? "
97367	97383	97385	97385	Byng	251	" I declare I think we have got hold of the right clue at last , "
97405	97512	97513	97513	Jim	181	" Read in this light , it is not nearly so incomprehensible : ' I shall never marry you , I have no right to marry anyone . ' Of course , I see now ! What an ass I was not to see it at once ! What she means is that she has no right to leave her mother ! To anyone who knew her lofty sense of duty as well as I ought to have done it is quite obvious that that is what she means . Is not it quite obvious ? is not it as clear as the sun in heaven ? "
97518	97530	97515	97515	his	181	" I am afraid that it is rather a forced interpretation . "
97531	97539	97541	97542	the other	396	" I do not agree with you , "
97545	97605	97541	97542	the other	396	" I see nothing forced about it . You do not know as well as I do — how should you?—her power of delicate , self - sacrificing devotion . It is overstrained , I grant you ; but there it is — she thinks she has no right to leave her mother now that she is all alone . "
97606	97617	97515	97515	his	181	" She is not alone ; she has her husband . "
97618	97650	97515	97515	his	181	" I mean now that all her other children are married and scattered . There are plenty more — are not there?—though I never could get her to talk about them . "
97651	97660	97541	97542	the other	396	" There are two sisters and two brothers . "
97661	97673	97675	97675	Byng	251	" But they are no longer any good to their mother , "
97703	97716	97687	97687	he	251	" as far as she is concerned they are non - existent . "
97717	97730	97541	97542	the other	396	" I do not know what right you have to say that . "
97731	97761	97687	97687	he	251	" And so she , with her lofty idea of self - sacrifice , immolates her own happiness on the altar of her filial affection . It is just like her!"—going
97767	97806	97807	97807	He	251	rapture—"blind mole that I was not to divine the motive , which her ineffable delicacy forbade her to put into words . She thought she had a right to think that I should have comprehended her without words ! "
97846	97872	97920	97920	his	181	" I do not know why you should credit Mrs. Le Marchant with such colossal selfishness ; she never used to be a selfish woman . "
97947	98067	97920	97920	his	181	prose—"Though they left no address , it will of course be possible , easy , to trace them . I will go to the station and make inquiries . They will have been seen . It is out of the question that she can have passed unnoticed ! No eye that has once been enriched by the sight of her can have forgotten that heavenly vision . I will telegraph to Bologna , to Milan , to Venice . Before night I shall have learnt her whereabouts . I shall be in the train , following her track . I shall be less than a day behind her . I shall fall at her feet , I shall — — "
98068	98074	98088	98088	his	181	" You are talking nonsense , "
98091	98160	98088	98088	his	181	" you can not do anything of the kind . When the poor woman has given so very unequivocal a proof of her wish to avoid you , as is implied in leaving the place at a moment 's notice , without giving herself even time to pack her clothes , it is impossible that you can force your company again upon her — it would be persecution . "
98161	98170	98172	98172	Byng	251	" And do you mean to tell me , "
98195	98228	98088	98088	his	181	" do you mean to say that I am to acquiesce , to sit down with my hands before me , and submit without a struggle to the loss of —— O my God"—breaking
98234	98249	98088	98088	his	181	cry—"why did you make me if it were only to rob me of her ? "
98250	98263	98265	98265	Jim	181	" I do not see what other course is open to you , "
98298	98326	98342	98342	Byng	251	" It is evident that she has some cogent reasons — or at least that appear cogent to her — for breaking off her relations with you . "
98327	98340	98342	98342	Byng	251	" What cogent reasons can she have that she had not yesterday ? "
98343	98376	98342	98342	Byng	251	violently—"yesterday , when she lay in my arms , and her lips spoke their acquiescence in my worship — if not in words , yet oh , far , far more — — "
98377	98385	98387	98387	Burgoyne	181	" Why do you reiterate these assertions ? "
98420	98463	98516	98516	Byng	251	" I neither express nor feel any doubt as to the terms you were on yesterday ; what I maintain is that to - day — I do not pretend to explain the why — she has changed her mind ; it is not"—with
98482	98506	98469	98469	himself	181	unworthy—"it is not the first time in the world 's history that such a thing has happened . She has changed her mind . "
98507	98514	98518	98518	his	251	" I do not believe it , "
98532	98578	98518	98518	his	251	" till her own mouth tell me so I will never believe it . If I thought for a moment that it was true I should rush to death to deliver me from the intolerable agony of such a thought . You do not believe it yourself"—lifting
98598	98638	98518	98518	his	251	" Think what condemnation it implies of her — her whom you always affected to like , who thought so greatly of you — her whose old friend you were — her whom you knew in her lovely childhood ! "
98639	98644	98646	98646	Jim	181	" You are right , "
98655	98705	98646	98646	Jim	181	" I do not believe that she has changed her mind . What I do believe is that yesterday she let herself go ; she gave way for one day , only for one day , after all , poor soul , to that famine for happiness which , I suppose"—with
98710	98756	98757	98757	He	1919	shrug—"gnaws us all now and then — gave way to it even to the pitch of forgetting that — that something in her past of whose nature I am as ignorant as you are , which seems to cast a blight over all her life . "
98774	98807	98770	98770	he	1919	" After you left her , recollection came back to her ; and because she could not trust herself again with you , probably for the very reason that she cared exceedingly about you"—steeling
98812	98824	98770	98770	he	1919	admission—"she felt that there was nothing for it but to go . "
98877	98889	98891	98891	Burgoyne	181	" It is an awful facer for you , I know , "
98931	98944	98988	98988	Byng	251	" What is he made of ? how can he do it ? "
98993	98998	98990	98990	his	251	" Are you going ? "
98999	99035	99041	99042	the other	396	" Yes ; if it is any consolation to you , you have not a monopoly of wretchedness to - day . Things are not looking very bright for me either . Amelia is ill . "
99036	99039	99041	99042	the other	396	" Amelia , "
99071	99098	98990	98990	his	251	" Is Amelia ill ? Oh poor Amelia ! Amelia was very good to her . Amelia tried to draw her out . She liked Amelia ! "
99099	99100	98990	98990	his	251	" Well"—with
99103	99113	98990	98990	his	251	sigh—"unfortunately that did not hinder Amelia from falling ill . "
99114	99119	98990	98990	his	251	" She is not ill really?"—his
99138	99142	98990	98990	his	251	" I do not know"—uneasily—"I
99179	99197	99198	99198	I	0	" But at this proposition the lover 's sobs break out louder and more infuriating than ever . "
99627	99641	99666	99666	She	222	" Has not he come yet ? Has not the doctor come yet ? "
99642	99662	99664	99664	Cecilia	222	" He has been and gone ; you see , you have been such a very long time away , "
99694	99701	99676	99676	her	222	" And what did he say ? "
99702	99709	99666	99666	She	222	" He did not say much . "
99710	99725	99666	99666	She	222	" Does he — does he think that it is anything — anything serious ? "
99726	99732	99676	99676	her	222	" He did not say . "
99733	99739	99666	99666	She	222	" Do you mean to tell me"—indignantly—"that
99746	99747	99740	99740	you	222	" "
99754	99764	99740	99740	you	222	" replies Cecilia , with a not inexcusable resentment , "
99772	99773	99765	99765	you	222	" "
99781	99799	99777	99777	you	222	" in too real anxiety to be offended at , or even aware of , her fleer . "
99805	99806	99802	99802	he	181	" "
99815	99816	99811	99811	he	181	" "
99830	99849	99850	99850	He	181	" growing the more uneasy as there seems no tangible object for his fears to lay hold of . "
99917	99918	99923	99923	he	181	" "
99933	99934	99935	99935	I	0	" "
99940	99941	99935	99935	I	0	" "
99960	99990	99944	99944	he	181	" asks Jim feverishly , chafing at the idea of this inaction , which seems inevitable , with that helpless feeling which his own entire ignorance of sickness produces . "
100005	100025	99993	99993	you	222	" cries Cecilia , rendered even more uncomfortable than she was before , by the contagion of his anxiety . "
100062	100063	100055	100055	she	1942	" "
100069	100070	100055	100055	she	1942	" "
100112	100116	100111	100111	I	0	believe"—with a rather grudging smile—"that
100133	100143	100128	100128	she	1942	" A sudden mountain rises in Jim 's throat . "
100160	100161	100153	100154	Dr. Coldstream	297	" "
100171	100172	100164	100164	he	297	" "
100178	100211	100173	100173	He	297	" Jim writhes . It seems to him as if he were being blind - folded , and having his arms tied to his sides by a hundred strong yet invisible threads . "
100218	100223	100213	100214	no one	819	" he cries miserably . "
100234	100247	100224	100224	I	0	" says Cecilia , with the venial crossness bred of real anxiety . "
100264	100265	100250	100250	you	222	" "
100283	100285	100280	100280	I	0	here!"—restlessly . "
100291	100296	100289	100289	you	222	" No immediate answer . "
100302	100316	100300	100300	you	222	" repeats she , curiosity , for the moment , superseding her disquiet . "
100338	100339	100321	100321	I	0	" "
100347	100348	100341	100341	I	0	" "
100352	100353	100354	100354	I	0	" "
100363	100364	100361	100361	Byng	251	" "
100368	100381	100366	100366	Byng	251	" repeats Cecilia , too genuinely astonished to remember even to prefix a "
100383	100389	100366	100366	Byng	251	" to Byng 's name . "
100425	100426	100464	100464	you	222	" "
100434	100445	100429	100429	you	222	" chimes in Sybilla 's languid voice from the sofa . "
100451	100452	100453	100453	I	0	" "
100461	100462	100453	100453	I	0	" "
100469	100484	100464	100464	you	222	" cries Cecilia , her countenance tinged with the pink of a generous indignation , "
100525	100526	100518	100518	she	189	" "
100536	100565	100527	100529	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" Then , seeing the open - mouthed astonishment depicted on the faces of his audience , he braces his mind to make the inevitable yet dreaded announcement . "
100586	100587	100582	100582	they	1952	" "
100590	100591	100582	100582	they	1952	" "
100603	100612	100594	100594	they	1952	" There is a moment of silent stupefaction . "
100616	100629	100613	100613	I	0	" says Cecilia , at last slowly recovering the power of speech , "
100655	100721	100722	100722	I	0	" Never in his life has Jim laboured under so severe a temptation to tell a lie , were it only the modified falsehood of allowing Cecilia 's hypothesis to pass uncontradicted ; but even if he were able for once to conquer his constitutional incapacity , he knows that in this case it would be useless . The truth must transpire to - morrow . "
100726	100727	100722	100722	I	0	" "
100730	100741	100782	100782	they	1952	" repeats Cecilia , in a still more thunderstruck key than before—"and
100747	100748	100749	100749	I	0	" "
100754	100755	100749	100749	I	0	" "
100761	100773	100758	100758	they	1952	" Jim makes an impatient movement , fidgeting on his chair . "
100794	100795	100782	100782	they	1952	" "
100809	100835	100800	100800	they	1952	" This being of the nature of an assertion — not an interrogation — Jim feels with relief that it does not demand an answer . "
100858	100859	100860	100860	They	1952	" "
100865	100904	100860	100860	They	1952	" The moment that this admission is out of Burgoyne 's mouth , he repents having made it ; nor does his regret at all diminish under the shower of ejaculations from both sisters that it calls forth . "
100920	101049	100913	100913	they	1952	" There is something so horribly jarring in the semi - jocosity of the last phrase that Jim jumps up from his chair and walks towards the window , where Mr. Wilson is sitting in dismal idleness . Mr. Wilson has never cared much about the Le Marchants , and is now far too deeply absorbed in his own trouble to have anything but the most inattentive indifference to bestow upon the topic which to his daughters appears so riveting . Jim blesses him for his callousness . But the window of a small room is not so distant from any other part of it that sounds can not , with perfect ease , penetrate thither , as Jim finds when Cecilia 's next eager question pursues him . "
101059	101060	101051	101052	Mr. Byng	251	" "
101063	101069	101051	101052	Mr. Byng	251	" There is a pause . "
101075	101084	101085	101085	I	0	" says Cecilia , with almost a gasp . "
101134	101135	101125	101125	she	1961	" "
101147	101148	101140	101140	she	1961	" "
101153	101157	101140	101140	she	1961	" sighs Sybilla , "
101195	101196	101197	101197	I	0	" "
101205	101267	101197	101197	I	0	" says Cecilia , with that inquisitiveness as to the details of a great affliction which we are all apt to experience . For some perverse reason , inexplicable even to himself , Jim would like to be able to answer that his friend is not cut up at all ; but truth again asserting its empire , he assents laconically , "
101270	101271	101197	101197	I	0	" "
101278	101279	101274	101274	he	251	" "
101288	101349	101350	101352	Poor dear boy	1963	" The impatience of the key in which this is uttered , coupled with the implied side - allusion to an acquaintance with sorrows of a somewhat similar nature on her own part , silences the younger and sounder Miss Wilson for a moment , but only for a moment — a moment long enough to be filled by another sighing "
101354	101358	101359	101359	You	1967	" from Sybilla . "
101367	101375	101362	101362	she	1968	him?"—with a renewed light of curiosity in her eyes—"have
101384	101390	101362	101362	she	1968	" Jim hesitates ; then , "
101393	101397	101362	101362	she	1968	" he replies ; "
101420	101421	101453	101453	she	1968	" "
101424	101426	101453	101453	she	1968	not!"—reluctantly ; "
101445	101446	101453	101453	she	1968	" "
101449	101450	101453	101453	she	1968	" "
101462	101463	101453	101453	she	1968	" "
101466	101467	101453	101453	she	1968	" "
101475	101476	101491	101491	she	1968	" "
101479	101480	101491	101491	she	1968	" "
101488	101489	101491	101491	she	1968	" "
101513	101553	101505	101505	she	1968	" cries Jim irritably , deeply annoyed to find that he is , by the series of negatives that is being forced from him , doing the very thing which he had just denied his own right to do . "
101568	101576	101567	101567	I	0	wonder"—with an air of even alerter interest than before—"what
101621	101644	101609	101609	I	0	" For the second time in one day the mention of an amiable flâneur 's name makes Jim vault to his feet . "
101658	101663	101664	101664	I	0	" he cries hastily . "
101671	101672	101664	101664	I	0	" "
101677	101696	101674	101674	you	1970	" asks Mr. Wilson dully , lifting his head from his chest , upon which it is sunk . "
101717	101727	101699	101699	you	1970	" The phrase strikes cold on Jim 's heart . "
101738	101746	101729	101729	you	1970	" inquires Sybilla as he passes her . "
101777	101793	101795	101795	him	1970	" and as he stoops to perform the asked - for service , she adds : "
101829	101877	101878	101878	You	1970	" But what Sybilla can conscientiously recommend is shut into the closing door . Outside that door Jim finds that Cecilia has joined him . Anxiety has quite banished the not altogether disagreeable curiosity of five minutes ago , from the troubled face she lifts to his . "
101887	101891	101885	101885	you	1970	" she asks . "
101936	101937	101938	101938	I	0	" "
101948	101953	101941	101941	I	0	" he answers mournfully . "
101968	102049	102050	102050	I	0	" As he puts the question , he feels its irrationality . He knows that the person to whom he is making his futile appeal has already given him all the scanty tidings she has to give ; yet he can not help indulging a faint hope that her response to this last query of his may perhaps set Amelia 's condition in a slightly more favourable light . A look of helpless distress clouds Cecilia 's already cloudy face . "
102084	102088	102076	102076	she	221	she"—with a slight parenthetical smile—"but
102143	102180	102139	102139	I	0	" He stops her , breaking rudely into her sentence . He can not bear to hear that it is only at the magic of his name that his poor faithful love lifts her sick head . "
102188	102189	102139	102139	I	0	" "
102203	102216	102190	102191	Some one	1980	" pursues Cecilia , still with that same helpless air of disquiet ; "
102299	102320	102321	102321	Amelia	201	" Burgoyne is too well aware of the perfect truth of this last statement to attempt any contradiction of it . "
102336	102341	102321	102321	Amelia	201	" continues she woefully ; "
102379	102715	102377	102377	herself	201	" Jim can well sympathize with this same confusion , when , several times during his walk back to the Piazza d'Azeglio , a muddled thought of comfort , in the idea that he will go and tell Amelia what a terrible day of anxiety about some one he has been having , taps at the door of his brain . The portals of No . 12 are once again opened to him by Annunziata , who indicates to him , by a series of compassionate gestures and liquid Tuscan sentences , that the povero is still within , and the Padrona , who this time also appears on the scene , and who is possessed of somewhat more English than her handmaid , intimates , albeit with a good deal of sympathy for his sufferings , yet with still more of determination , that it would be no bad thing were he to be removed , since , whether the sun shines or the rain falls , people must live , and the apartment has to be prepared for new occupants . Anything that speaks less intention of removing than Byng 's pose , when his friend rejoins him , it would be difficult to imagine . He is stretched upon the parquet floor , with his head lying on the small footstool that has been wo nt to support Elizabeth 's feet ; her rifled workbasket stands on the floor beside him , while her bit of embroidery half shrouds his distorted face . The needle , still sticking in it , may prick his eyes out for all he cares ; the book she last read is open at the page where she has put her mark of a skein of pale silk ; and the yellow anemones , that he must have plucked for her yesterday in drenched Vallombrosa , are crushed under his hot cheek . But outwardly he is quite quiet . Jim puts his hand on his shoulder . "
102730	102744	102377	102377	herself	201	" As he receives no answer , he repeats the exhortation more imperatively , "
102747	102748	102377	102377	herself	201	" "
102760	102770	102377	102377	herself	201	" says the young man , lifting his head , "
102787	102840	102841	102841	You	0	" He says this with an air of resolution , and once more lays down his face upon the footstool , which , being entirely worked in beads , has impressed the cheek thrust against it with a design in small hollows , a fact of which the sufferer is quite unaware . "
102846	102867	102868	102868	you	0	" cries Burgoyne , the more impatiently that his own share of anxiety is fretting his temper almost past endurance ; "
102895	102896	102880	102880	they	1987	" "
102900	102925	102880	102880	they	1987	" repeats Byng , turning over almost on his face , and flattening his nose and lips against the beaded surface of his stool , "
102935	103004	103005	103005	I	0	" It is to be placed to the credit side of Mr. Burgoyne 's account that he does not , upon this declaration , withdraw the resting - place from his young friend 's countenance and break it over his head . It is certainly not the temptation to do so that is lacking . Instead , he sits down at some distance off , and says quietly : "
103041	103052	103037	103037	I	0	" The other has lifted his head in a moment . "
103058	103059	103055	103055	you	0	" "
103064	103069	103061	103061	you	0	" asks Jim indignantly , "
103103	103125	103092	103092	you	0	Come"—seeing a look of shocked consternation breaking over the young man 's face , and determined to strike while the iron is hot—"I
103179	103579	103580	103580	You	1999	" Byng obeys with a scared docility ; his eyes are so dim , and his fingers tremble so much , that Jim has to help him in replacing Elizabeth 's small properties . His own heart is pricked with a cruel smart that has no reference to Amelia 's illness , as he handles the departed girl 's spools and skeins , and awkwardly folds her scrap of broidery . Byng offers no further resistance , and , equally indifferent to his own bunged - up eyes , bead - marked cheeks , and dishevelled locks , follows his companion dully , down the stone stairs , compassionately watched from the top by Annunziata , whose heart is an inconveniently tender one to be matched with so tough a face . They get into the fiacre , and drive in dead silence to the Minerva . Arrived there , Jim persuades his friend , who now seems prepared to acquiesce meekly in whatever he is told to do , to lie down on his bed , since the few words that he utters convey the fact of his being suffering from a burning headache , a phenomenon not very surprising , considering his late briny exercises , since , even at the superb age of twenty - two , it is difficult to spend six hours in banging your forehead against a parquet floor , in moaning , bellowing , and weeping , without leaving some traces of these gymnastics on your physique . Burgoyne stands or sits patiently beside him , bathing his fiery temples with eau - de - Cologne , not teasing him with any questions , having , indeed , on his own part , the least possible desire for conversation ; and so the heavy hours go by . The day has declined to evening before Burgoyne quits his protégé 's side to dine , shortly and solitarily , previous making a third visit to the Anglo - Américain , to learn the latest news of his betrothed . He had left Byng still stretched upon his bed , apparently asleep , and is therefore the more surprised , on returning to take a final look at him before setting out on his own errand , to find him up , with hat and stick in hand , evidently prepared for a walk . "
103585	103586	103580	103580	You	1999	" "
103589	103590	103580	103580	You	1999	" "
103596	103601	103602	103602	I	0	" The other hesitates . "
103608	103609	103602	103602	I	0	" "
103612	103613	103602	103602	I	0	" "
103618	103623	103615	103615	I	0	" replies Byng doggedly ; "
103686	103687	103782	103782	you	2003	" "
103693	103694	103782	103782	you	2003	" "
103717	103766	103767	103767	You	2003	" There is such a fixed resolution in his voice , which is no longer quavering with sobs , and in his ashy face , that Jim offers no further resistance . The only concession he can obtain from him is that of permitting him to accompany him . "
103784	103797	103782	103782	you	2003	" inquires Jim , as they set off walking across the Piazza . "
103809	103815	103782	103782	you	2003	" answers the other restlessly . "
103818	103833	103835	103835	you	2003	" ( a hazy look of reminiscence dawning over his preoccupied haggard face ) , "
103849	103850	103835	103835	you	2003	" "
103859	103865	103853	103853	you	2003	" replies the other sadly . "
103870	103925	103866	103866	She	201	" Perhaps the wretchedness that pierces through his friend 's quiet tones recalls the young dreamer to the fact that the world holds other miseries than his own . There is at all events something of his old quick sympathy in his next words , and in the way in which they are uttered : "
103962	104103	104104	104104	Cecilia	222	" It is the question that Jim , in baffled anxiety , puts when he is admitted inside the dull salon , where no love - glorified , homely face to - night lights up the tender candles of its glad eyes , from over its stitching , at his entry . Sybilla is lying less comfortably than usual on her sofa , her cushions not plumped up , and her bottle of smelling - salts rolled out of her reach . Mr. Wilson is walking uneasily up and down the room , instead of sitting placidly in his chair , with the soothing voice — which he had always thought as much to be counted on , and as little to be particularly thankful for , as the air that fills his lungs — lullingly reading him to sleep . "
104111	104122	104104	104104	Cecilia	222	" he says , in a voice of forlorn irritation . "
104153	104179	104145	104145	she	222	" A moment later , still pursuing his fidgety ramble from wall to wall , and exclaiming peevishly , as he stumbles over a footstool : "
104212	104239	104240	104240	I	0	" A not very subdued sob from the sofa is the only answer he gets , an answer which evidently irritates still further his fretted nerves . "
104249	104266	104245	104245	Cecilia	222	" he cries , hastening to the door , opening it noisily , and then listening . "
104274	104293	104268	104268	me	0	" says Jim , his heart going out to the fractious old man in a sympathy of suffering . "
104310	104355	104356	104356	I	0	" ( a flash of recollection lighting up the fact that Amelia 's is distinctly the worst room of the suite occupied by the Wilson family ; the room with most stairs to climb to , and least accommodation when you reach it ) . "
104383	104518	104374	104374	I	0	" Without waiting for permission , he springs up the stairs , and , standing on the landing , taps cautiously on the closed door , whose number ( by one of those quirks of memory that furnish all our minds with insignificant facts ) he has recollected . His first knock is so superfluously soft that it is evidently inaudible within , since no result follows upon it . His second , a shade louder , though still muffled by the fear of breaking into some little fitful yet salutary sleep , brings Cecilia out . His first glance at her face shows him that she has no good news , either to warm his own heart , or for him to carry down as a solace to the poor old man below . "
104528	104546	104523	104523	you	0	" says she , shutting the door behind her with a clumsy carefulness that makes it creak . "
104585	104613	104580	104580	she	222	" It is the same adjective that Cecilia had applied earlier in the day to her sick sister , and it fills Jim with an impotent terror . "
104628	104632	104633	104633	I	0	" he asks . "
104647	104648	104641	104641	you	0	" "
104654	104679	104649	104649	She	222	" replies Cecilia , in a noisy whisper , much more likely to pierce sick ears than a voice pitched in its normal key ; "
104720	104721	104698	104699	Dr. Coldstream	297	" "
104742	104791	104728	104728	I	0	" persists Jim who feels a desire , whose gnawing intensity surprises himself , to be assured by the evidence of his own eyes that his poor love 's face has not undergone some strange and gruesome change , such as is suggested by Cecilia 's disquieting epithet . "
104803	104808	104795	104795	she	222	" asks she scornfully , "
104819	104931	104932	104932	She	222	" So that night Jim does not see Amelia . After all , as Cecilia says , it is better to be on the safe side , and to - morrow she will be brighter , and he can sit by her , and tell her lovingly — oh very lovingly!—what a fright she has given him . Yes , to - morrow she will be brighter . The adjective is Cecilia 's ; but , apparently , he can not improve upon it , for he not only keeps repeating it to himself as he runs downstairs , but employs it for the reassurance of Miss Wilson 's anxious relatives . "
104950	104965	104968	104968	she	222	they?"—rather vaguely , with again that oppressive sense of his own inexperience in illness . "
104970	104982	105029	105029	she	222	worse"—this is hastily subjoined , as he sees her father 's face fall—"Cecilia
105037	105498	105499	105499	I	0	" He leaves the hotel with the phrase , which sounds cut and dried and unreal , still upon his lips , after bidding a kinder good - night than usual to Mr. Wilson , after having offered to supply Amelia 's place by reading aloud to him , a feat he has not performed since the evening of his disastrous experience of the Provident Women of Oxford ; and lastly , having even — as a reward to Sybilla , who has been understood to murmur something tearful about letting her maid look in upon Amelia at intervals through the night — tucked in her Austrian blanket , and picked up her smelling - bottle . He has expected to rejoin Byng outside , as he had promised to wait for him with such patience as a cigar could lend , and on the condition that his absence should not exceed a stipulated period . But either the promise has been broken , or the period exceeded , for Byng is gone . The fact does not greatly surprise Burgoyne , though it causes him a slight uneasiness , which is , perhaps , rather a blessing for him , distracting his mind in some slight measure from the heaviness of his own trouble . He walks fast to the Piazza d'Azeglio ; but he neither overtakes him of whom he is in pursuit , nor finds him at 12 bis . He has been there , has inquired with agitation for the telegrams , which have naturally not been received , and has then gone away again immediately . Whither ? The Padrona , who has answered the door - bell herself and , with Italian suavity , is doing her best to conceal that she is beginning to think she has heard nearly enough of the subject , does not know . For a few moments Jim stands irresolute , then he turns his steps towards the Arno . It is not yet too late for the charming riverside promenade , the gay Lung'Arno , to be still alive with flâneurs ; the stars have lit their lamps above , and the hotels below . The pale planets , and the yellow lights from the opposite bank of the river , lie together , sweet and peaceful upon her breast . In both cases the counterfeits are as clear and bright as the real luminaries ; and it seems as if one had only to plunge in an arm to pick up stars and candles out of the stream 's depths . Leaning over the parapet near the Ponte Vecchio , Burgoyne soon discovers a familiar figure , a figure which starts when he touches its arm . "
105512	105524	105501	105501	I	0	" says Byng , with a rather guilty air of apology , "
105565	105570	105562	105562	You	2015	think"—with a look of almost terror—"that
105589	105590	105562	105562	You	2015	" "
105596	105597	105593	105593	I	0	" "
105607	105625	105593	105593	I	0	" cries Byng feverishly , irritated at not having drawn forth the reassurance he had hoped for . "
105666	105678	105679	105679	I	0	" Jim looks down sadly at the calm , strong stream . "
105696	105697	105698	105698	I	0	" "
105707	105718	105698	105698	I	0	" says Byng , lifting his arms from the parapet , "
105771	105790	105791	105791	I	0	" He glances at his friend in a nervous , sidelong way , as he makes this suggestion . "
105801	105819	105791	105791	I	0	" replies Jim quietly , without giving any evidence of an intention to acquiesce in his dismissal . "
105837	105867	105890	105890	you	2022	" His tone , in making this statement , must be yet more dreary than he is aware , as it arouses even Byng 's self - absorbed attention . "
105875	105884	105885	105885	My	0	" he echoes , with a shocked look . "
105900	105901	105890	105890	you	2022	" "
105908	105930	105902	105902	I	0	" interrupts Jim sharply , in a superstitious panic of hearing some unfavourable augury as to his betrothed put into words . "
105981	106112	106113	106113	You	2023	" He speaks almost angrily , as if expecting and challenging contradiction . But Byng 's spirit has already flown back to his own woes . He may make what sanguine statements he pleases about Amelia 's to - morrow , without fearing any demurrer from his companion . What attention the latter has to spare is evidently only directed to the solving of the problem , how best , with amicable civility , to be rid of him . Before he can hit upon any expedient for attaining this desired end , Burgoyne speaks again , his eye resting with a compassionate expression upon his junior 's face , whose wild pallor is heightened by the disorder of his hair , and the hat crushed down over his brows . "
106138	106139	106125	106125	you	2023	" "
106142	106152	106153	106153	you	2023	" cries the other , with almost a scream ; "
106162	106177	106153	106153	you	2023	" Then , checking himself and with a strong and palpable effort for composure : "
106223	106224	106238	106238	Doney	109	" "
106254	106255	106238	106238	Doney	109	" "
106265	106270	106258	106258	I	0	" asks Byng impatiently . "
106299	106304	106328	106328	Jim	181	that"—breaking out into a noisy laugh—"you
106339	106364	106366	106366	Byng	251	" If you think that you will get me to go back to the hotel to - night , you are very much mistaken , "
106369	106375	106377	106377	his	2031	" no roof less high than this"—jerking
106389	106466	106377	106377	his	2031	stars—"shall shelter my head ; and besides , where would be the use of going to bed when I should have to be up again so early ? I shall be off by one of the morning expresses : until I have learnt — as , of course , I shall do to - night — where she has gone , I can not tell which ; but neither of them starts much later than seven . "
106524	106540	106520	106520	himself	181	" And supposing that you do not learn to - night where she has gone ? "
106541	106552	106520	106520	himself	181	" There is no use in supposing anything so impossible ! "
106716	106723	106725	106725	Byng	251	" You will go home now ? "
107102	107105	107099	107099	Arnolpho	290	" Bride , "
107785	107793	107794	107794	she	201	" How fresh and cool you are ! "
107803	107808	107794	107794	she	201	" Do not look at me!"—covering
107814	107831	107794	107794	she	201	hands—"I am not fit to be seen ; but what does that matter ? What do I care?"—beginning
107833	107888	107794	107794	she	201	cry—"Oh , she is so bad ! We have spent such a dreadful night ! As I tell you , I am a shocking sick - nurse ; I never know what to do ; I lose my head completely ; and she has been so odd — she has been talking such gibberish ! "
107889	107892	107794	107794	she	201	" Delirious ? "
107893	107948	107794	107794	she	201	" Yes , I suppose that is what you would call it . I never saw anybody delirious before , so I do not know . I have seen Sybilla in hysterics , but I never believed that they were real — I always thought that a bucket of water would bring her round . "
107982	107988	107990	107990	Cecilia	222	" I was so frightened , "
107992	108094	107990	107990	Cecilia	222	" it is not cheerful being all alone at the dead of night with a person talking such nonsense as she was . Amelia , of all people , to talk nonsense ! I could not quite make out what it was about , but it seemed to have more or less reference to you . She was begging you to forgive her for something she had done , as far as I could gather ; some treat she had prepared for you , and that you had not liked . Have you the least idea what she could have meant ? "
108129	108181	108182	108182	I	0	" She is quieter now . Sybilla 's maid is with her ; Sybilla really has not behaved badly — for her ; she let her maid look in several times during the night ; but still , for the most part I was alone with her ! Oh , I do trust"—shuddering—"that
108203	108380	108193	108201	a person who is not right in her head	2069	" This aspiration on the youngest Miss Wilson 's part is , for the present occasion , at least , likely to be gratified ; for , by the time that another night settles down on Florence , Amelia 's illness has been declared by Dr. Coldstream to have every symptom of developing into the malarious Florentine fever , which not unfrequently lays low the chilled or over - fatigued , or generally imprudent foreign visitor to that little Eden . Amelia has Florentine fever ; and the verification of this fact is followed by all the paraphernalia of serious sickness — night and day nurses , disinfectants , physic phials . The announcement of her being attacked by a definite and recognised disease brings at first a sort of relief to Burgoyne 's mind , which , under Cecilia 's frightened and frightening word - pictures , had been beset by terrors great in proportion to their vagueness . Now that Amelia is confessedly sick of a fever , there is nothing abnormal in her being "
108383	108385	108193	108201	a person who is not right in her head	2069	" and "
108388	108390	108193	108201	a person who is not right in her head	2069	" and "
108393	108585	108586	108586	I	0	" these being only the inevitable stages on a road which will — which must lead to ultimate recovery . His heart is heavy , yet scarcely so heavy as it had been upon his arrival in the morning , when , late in the afternoon — not sooner do the claims upon him of the disorganized and helpless family of his betrothed relax — he returns to the Minerva to look after Byng . Having had every reason to fear that he will not find him at the hotel , but will be obliged again to set off in pursuit of him through the streets and squares so repeatedly traversed last night , he is relieved to learn from the hotel servants that the young man is in his bedroom . He finds him there indeed ; no longer stretched in the blessed oblivion of deep sleep upon his bed , but sitting on a hard chair by the open window , his arms resting upon the back , and his face crushed down upon them . By no slightest movement does he show consciousness of his friend 's entrance . "
108597	108603	108605	108605	you	0	" says the latter kindly . "
108607	108626	108605	108605	you	0	" answers Byng , his voice coming muffled through lips still buried in his own coat - sleeve . "
108638	108639	108632	108632	I	0	" "
108650	108662	108640	108640	I	0	" rejoins Jim , still indulgently , though a shade dryly . "
108670	108671	108664	108664	you	0	" "
108681	108683	108664	108664	you	0	Yes,"—lifting his head—"I

108767	108842	108757	108757	she	2073	" Jim refrains from saying how likely this culmination of his friend 's woes has appeared to him , since it would have been the height of the illogical for the Le Marchants to have put themselves to extreme inconvenience in order to escape from a person to whom they immediately afterwards gave the power of following them . He refrains from saying it , because he knows of how very little consoling power the "
108846	108851	108757	108757	she	2073	" philosophy is possessed . "
108859	108860	108855	108855	you	0	" "
108882	108883	108891	108891	he	386	" "
108907	108947	108903	108904	a buffalo	2077	" replies Burgoyne with a matter - of - fact dryness , which proceeds less from want of sympathy , than from an honest belief that it is the best and kindest method of dealing with Byng 's heroics . "
108953	108972	108973	108973	I	0	" murmurs the latter , repeating his own phrase as if he found a dismal pleasure in it . "
108992	108993	109031	109031	he	386	" "
109010	109011	109031	109031	he	386	" "
109457	109473	109474	109474	he	386	" Poor soul ! I can not quite make out what it is all about , "
109484	109505	109474	109474	he	386	" but I catch your name over and over again , Jim ; I suppose it is all about you . "
109534	109556	109506	109506	Cecilia	222	" You must not mind , you know it is all nonsense . She talks very differently when she is well . "
109847	109869	109870	109870	she	221	" It is ridiculous to suppose that a person in such rude health as Cecilia can miss her as I do , "
109874	109897	109870	109870	she	221	" I was always her first object , she always knew by instinct when I was more suffering than usual ; who cares now"—breaking
109905	109912	109870	109870	she	221	tears—"whether I am suffering or not ? "
110179	110186	110163	110163	He	2095	" Where else should I go ? "
110225	110239	110240	110240	He	2095	stool—"Where shall I find such recent and authentic traces of her as here ? "
110583	110590	110575	110575	Jim	181	" What are you looking at ? "
110591	110644	110659	110659	he	181	" I ; oh — nothing particular ! What should I be looking at ? What is there to look to ? I was only — only — wondering as a mere matter of curiosity , how many feet it is from here to the pavement ? Sixteen ? eighteen ? twenty ? "
110663	110680	110659	110659	he	181	" I do not recommend it ; it would be a clumsy way of doing it . "
110681	110696	110698	110698	Byng	251	" What matter how clumsy the way , so that one attains the end ? "
110713	110764	110659	110659	he	181	" who cares how bad the road is so that it leads him to the goal ? Jim shudders . Death has been so near to him for the last nine days , that the terrific realism of Constance 's apostrophe seems to be almost more than he can bear . "
110793	110832	110659	110659	he	181	" continues Byng loudly and wildly , clasping his hands above his head , and apparently perfectly indifferent as to whether the other inmates of the hotel , or passers - by on the piazza , overhear him . "
110853	110874	110839	110839	you	2116	" replies Jim , glancing at the other 's head , exposed hatless to the scorch of the Tuscan sun , "
110883	110958	110959	110959	I	0	" So saying , he takes him quietly , yet decidedly , by the arm , and leads him within the room . Either his matter - of - fact manner , or the sight of his face , upon which , well - seasoned as it is , vigil and sorrow have begun to write their unavoidable marks , brings the young madman back to some measure of sense and self - control . "
110965	110976	110977	110977	you	2116	" he says apologetically , still looking white and wild ; "
111024	111025	111010	111010	you	2116	" "
111037	111054	111029	111029	you	2116	" answers Jim , fixing his tired , sleepless eyes with melancholy severity upon his companion . "
111137	111227	111230	111233	my dear old chap	2022	" Burgoyne 's hopes have not been high , as to any salutary result of his own philippic while uttering it . But our words , sometimes , to our surprise , turn from wooden swords to steel daggers in our hands . For a moment Byng stands as if stunned ; then he breaks into a tornado of sobs and tears , such tears as have often before angered his friend , but which now he welcomes the sight of , as perhaps precursors of a saner mood . "
111235	111251	111230	111233	my dear old chap	2022	" he cries , catching at Jim 's unresponsive hand , and wringing it hard , "
111286	111287	111288	111288	I	0	" "
111312	111313	111302	111302	they	2123	" "
111331	111351	111325	111325	you	0	" cries Byng , in a broken voice of passionate excitement , the tears still racing down his face . "
111362	111418	111419	111419	I	0	" asks Jim , with a nod of his head towards the balcony , seen from where they stand , grilling in the midday blaze . The verb employed , if closely looked into , bears a ludicrous disproportion to the intended action indicated , but neither of the men sees anything ridiculous in it . "
111423	111431	111419	111419	I	0	" cries Byng , in eager asseveration ; "
111531	111577	111596	111596	you	0	" He covers his face with his hands , and through them the scalding drops trickle ; but only for a moment . In the next , he has dashed them away , and is moving restlessly about the room , looking for his hat . "
111584	111589	111596	111596	you	0	" he says urgently ; "
111634	111677	111629	111629	us	2126	" Burgoyne complies ; but under pretext of making some change in his dress , escapes from his friend , for just the few minutes necessary to write and despatch a telegram to the young man 's mother . It runs thus : "
111697	111833	111688	111688	He	2127	" If , as is to be hoped , Mrs. Byng is still in London , reaping the succession of the old relative whose death - bed she had quitted Florence to attend , his message will bring her hither within forty - eight hours , and the burden of responsibility , now grown so insupportable , will be shifted from his shoulders . Until those forty - eight hours have elapsed , he must not again let Byng out of his sight . The day rolls by , the critical ninth day rolls by on its torrid wheels to eventide , and when that eventide comes , it finds Cecilia Wilson running down from Amelia 's room , to give the last news of her to the three men and one woman waiting below . "
111841	111871	111836	111836	he	2127	" she says , in answer to the silent hungry looks of question addressed to her , and alluding to the doctor , who is still with the patient ; "
111881	111921	111922	111922	you	2128	" What a dreadful parrot - sound the two phrases , so familiar to us all in the newspaper bulletins of distinguished men on their death - beds , have during the last week assumed in Burgoyne 's ears ; "
111946	111947	111942	111942	he	2127	" "
111954	111965	111966	111966	you	0	" cries Byng , rushing forward and snatching both Cecilia 's hands—"do
111974	111975	111966	111966	you	0	" "
111992	112017	112022	112022	he	2127	" replies Cecilia , a tinge of colour rushing over her mealy face — that face , ten days ago , clothed in so many roses—"well
112057	112058	112050	112050	she	0	" "
112063	112657	112060	112061	God!—thank God	214	" In the ardour of his thanksgiving he presses her hands closer , instead of dropping them , a fact of which he is entirely unaware , but so is not she ; and who knows , even at that serious moment , what tiny genial hope may slide into her plump heart ! Again this night Burgoyne does not go to bed , from a superstitious fear that if he does , if he seems to take for granted an improvement , that very taking for granted may annul it — may bring on a relapse . But when the next morning finds no such backsliding to have taken place , when each hour through the cheerfully broadening day brings falling fever and steadying pulse , then indeed he cautiously opens the door of his heart to let a tiny rose - pinioned hope creep in — then at last , on the third night , he stretches his tired limbs in deep slumber upon his bed . He has received a brief telegram from Mrs. Byng to announce her arrival as fast as boat and train can bring her ; and seven o'clock on Saturday morning — he having sent his despatch to her on the previous Wednesday — finds him pacing the platform of the railway - station , awaiting the incoming of the morning express from Turin . He is pacing it alone , for he has thought it best not to reveal to her son the fact of her expected return , not being at all sure in what spirit he will receive it , nor whether indeed the news of it might not even drive him , in his present unsound state of mind , to fly from the place at her approach . The morning air , in its early clear coolness , blows sweet here , under the station - roof , unconquered even by engine smoke , and on Jim 's face as he walks up and down — careworn as it still is — there comes , now and again , a half - born smile . He is never one to hope very easily , but surely now — now that yet another night has been prosperously tided over , there can , even to him , seem no reasonable ground for doubt that Amelia has turned the corner . Amelia , with the corner turned — Byng , in five minutes wholly off his hands ! The only wonder is , that the small smile never comes quite to the birth . The train is punctual , and almost at its due moment draws up in dusty length at the platform . Its passengers are comparatively few ; for at this latening season most of the English are winging home to their rooky woods ; and he has no difficulty in at once discovering among them the tall smart figure — smart even after forty - eight hours of the unluxurious luxury of a wagon - lit — of the lady he is awaiting . As he gives her his hand to help her down the high step , the admiring thought crosses his mind of what a large quantity of fatigue , dust , and uneasiness of mind a radically good - looking Englishwoman , in radically good clothes , can undergo without seeming much the worse for them . Before her neat narrow foot has touched the pavement , a brace of eager questions shoots out of her mouth . "
112668	112669	112664	112664	I	0	" "
112680	112681	112683	112683	he	2130	" "
112720	112746	112715	112715	you	2132	" By this time she is safely landed at his side , which is possibly the reason why he at once lets fall her hand . "
112763	112764	112774	112774	her	2131	" "
112776	112793	112774	112774	her	2131	" cries the mother , fast becoming frantic at the delay in answering her passionate questions . "
112847	112919	112827	112827	I	0	" Now that Burgoyne has a nearer view of Mrs. Byng , he sees that she has a more fagged and travel - worn air than he had at first supposed , and her dusty eyes are fastened upon him with such a hunger of interrogation , that , angered and jarred as he is by her tone , he has not the heart any longer to keep her in suspense . "
112943	112944	112938	112938	she	2131	" "
112962	113054	113061	113061	she	2131	" She puts the question in all good faith , her lively imagination having easily made the not very wide jump from the fact already established in her own mind of Elizabeth being an adventuress , to the not much more difficult one to swallow , of her having devoured another fils de famille , as well as Mrs. Byng 's own . For a moment , Burgoyne turns away , voice and countenance alike beyond his control . He has by no means perfectly recovered either , when he answers — "
113075	113076	113061	113061	she	2131	" "
113081	113096	113102	113102	you	2137	" cries Mrs. Byng , with an accent of the highest relief and joy ; "
113106	113117	113118	113118	he	2131	God!"—then , with a sudden lapse into affright , she adds rapidly—"and
113127	113128	113122	113122	her?—he	2131	" "
113135	113136	113131	113131	he	2131	" "
113145	113147	113141	113141	he	2131	me?"—suspiciously . "
113156	113157	113158	113158	You	2137	" "
113164	113165	113158	113158	You	2137	" "
113168	113169	113158	113158	You	2137	" "
113177	113178	113173	113173	you	2137	" "
113189	113190	113173	113173	you	2137	" "
113195	113206	113192	113192	you	2137	say"—falling from her former rapidity of utterance to a dismayed incredulous slowness—"that
113224	113225	113226	113226	I	0	" "
113279	113326	113274	113274	you	2137	" replies Jim , avenging by this sentence the wrongs done to Elizabeth , and doing it so well , that a moment later a feeling of compunction comes over him at the success of his own attempt at retributive justice . Mrs. Byng turns pale . "
113335	113342	113328	113328	she	240	" she says under her breath . "
113348	113368	113369	113369	you	2137	" repeats Jim , his ire aroused again , no sooner than allayed , by this mode of expression ; "
113402	113570	113387	113387	she	240	" But at this , Mr. Burgoyne 's auditor looks so hopelessly bewildered that he thinks it the simplest plan at once , in the fewest possible words , to put her in possession of the tale of her son 's achievements and disasters . He does this , partly to stem the torrent of her questions , the form that they have hitherto taken producing in him a feeling of frenzied indignation , which he doubts his own power much longer to conceal — partly in order to set Elizabeth 's conduct with the least possible delay in its true light before her . Surely , when she has been told of her magnanimous renunciation , she will do her justice , will cease to load her with those hard names and insulting assertions that have made him grind his own teeth to listen to . But in this expectation he soon finds that he is mistaken . The wrath of Mrs. Byng against Elizabeth for having "
113573	113595	113635	113635	she	2141	" her son , as she persists in stating the case , is surpassed only by indignation at her insolence in having "
113600	113621	113635	113635	she	2141	" As to the genuineness of this last action she expresses , it is true , the most complete incredulity . "
113666	113669	113678	113678	you	2142	proof"—with an angry laugh—"that
113690	113691	113692	113692	I	0	" "
113706	113754	113704	113704	you	2142	" replies Jim , with an anger no less real , and a merriment no less spurious than her own . By this time they have reached the hotel ; and Jim , having helped his companion out of the fiacre , shows symptoms of leaving her . "
113764	113776	113757	113757	you	0	" she asks , a little aghast at this unexpected manœuvre ; "
113792	113808	113809	113809	he	2144	he"—her eyes wandering wistfully over the hotel front till they rest on her son 's closed persiennes—"that
113829	113830	113831	113831	I	0	" "
113838	113839	113831	113831	I	0	" "
113843	113855	113856	113856	You	0	you?"—with an impatient but friendly little mocking imitation of his tone . "
113858	113861	113856	113856	You	0	not"—with a conciliatory smile—"angry
113874	113879	113885	113887	the old hen	2146	" Jim smiles too . "
113909	113910	113905	113905	I	0	" "
113916	113917	113905	113905	I	0	" "
113924	113930	113905	113905	I	0	" She lifts her eyebrows . "
113966	113970	113953	113953	I	0	" He sighs . "
113983	113984	113953	113953	I	0	" "
113993	113998	113987	113987	you	0	surely?"—in a tone of lively surprise—"Amelia
114001	114135	114136	114136	I	0	" He looks at her with an irrational stupefaction . It appears to him now , in the distortion of all objects that the last fortnight has brought , as if Amelia 's illness had spread over the whole of his life , as if there had never been a time when she had not been ill , and yet of this event , immense as it seems to him in its duration , the woman before him obviously has never heard . When he comes to think of it , how should she ? In point of fact it is not a fortnight since Miss Wilson fell sick , and during that fortnight he himself has not written her a line ; neither , he is equally sure , has her son . "
114145	114161	114136	114136	I	0	" she says , noting the , to her , unintelligible astonishment in his face ; "
114181	114226	114177	114177	she	2148	" In answer he tells her , with as much brevity and compression as he had employed in the tale of Elizabeth 's disappearance , that of Amelia 's illness , often interrupted by her expressions of sympathy . At the end she says : "
114256	114323	114163	114163	you	2147	" Her adoption of his trouble as her own , an adoption whose sincerity is confirmed by her impulsive seizure of his hand , and the feeling look in her handsome eyes make him forgive the exaggeration of her statement , and go some way towards replacing her in that position in his esteem which her diatribes against Elizabeth had gone near to making her forfeit . "
114332	114337	114163	114163	you	2147	" continues she sanguinely ; "
114358	114387	114163	114163	you	2147	least"—as the reminiscence of Amelia 's unyouthful appearance evidently flashes across her mind , of that prematurely middle - aged look which an unequal fortune gives to some plain women—"at
114397	114483	114484	114484	You	2149	" Whether it be due to the possession of this modified form of juvenility , to an excellent constitution , or to what other reason , certain it is that the next two days go by without any diminution , rather with a sensible and steady increase , in Miss Wilson 's favourable symptoms , and , on the afternoon of the latter of these days , Cecilia , in rather impatient answer to Jim 's long daily string of questions about her , says : "
114530	114531	114518	114518	you	2149	" "
114538	114613	114615	114615	I	0	" inquires he , with a tremble in his voice . He desires passionately to see her ; until he does he will never believe that she is really going to live ; he has a hunger to assure himself that no terrible metamorphosis has passed over her in these nightmare days ; and yet , coupled with that hunger , is a deep dread , which translates itself into his next halting words . "
114634	114635	114626	114626	she	2148	" "
114642	114659	114626	114626	she	2148	" replies Cecilia half sadly , yet with the sub - lying cheerfulness of assured hope ; "
114691	114751	114753	114753	she	2148	" It is the second time within two days that the fact of his betrothed 's maturity has been impressed upon him , and formerly it would have caused him a pang ; but now , of what moment is it to him that she looks a hundred , if only she is living , and going to live ? "
114761	114762	114753	114753	she	2148	" "
114798	115253	114784	114784	her	2148	" The tears have come into Cecilia 's large stupid eyes , and Jim himself is , with regard to her , in the position of the great Plantagenet , when he heard the lovely tale of York and Suffolk 's high death . As he walks away he is filled with a solemn joy , one of those deep serious gladnesses with which not the stranger , no , nor even the close friend or loving kinsman intermeddleth . He is under an engagement to meet Mrs. Byng at a certain hour , but although that hour has already come and passed , he feels that he can not face all her sincere congratulations without some preparatory toning down of his mood . The streets , with their gay va - et - vient , their cracking whips and shouting drivers , seem all too secular and every - day to match the profundity of his reverent thankfulness . He takes it with him into the great cool church that stands so nigh at hand to his hotel , Santa Maria Novella . The doors fall behind him noiselessly as he enters , shutting out the fiery hot piazza , and the garish noises of the world . In the great dim interior , cold and tranquil , there is the usual sprinkling of tourists peering up at its soaring columns , trying to read themselves , out of their guide - books , into a proper admiration for Cimabue 's large - faced Virgin and ugly Bambino , folded , with all its gold and sombre colours , in the dignity of its twice two centuries of gloom . There are the usual three or four blue - trousered soldiers strolling leisurely about , there is a curly - tailed little dog trotting hither and thither unforbidden , ringing his bell , and there are the invariable tanned peasant - women kneeling at the side - altars . He does not belong to the ancient Church , but to - day he kneels beside them , and the tears he had hastened away to hide from Cecilia come back to make yet dimmer to his view the details of the dim altar - pieces behind the tall candles . His eye , as he rises to his feet again , falls on the contadina nearest him . What is she praying for ? In the expansion of his own deep joy he longs to tell her how much he hopes that , whatever it is , she will obtain it . It is not the contadina who , standing a little behind , joins him as he turns away from the altar . "
115262	115281	115256	115256	you	2153	" says Mrs. Byng , her smile growing somewhat diffident as she sees the solemnity of his face , "
115299	115335	115295	115295	I	0	" He would , of the two , have preferred that she had not followed him , that he had been given five more minutes to himself ; but he naturally does not say so . "
115348	115554	115295	115295	I	0	" and he assents . A small Dominican monk , with a smile and a bunch of keys , is opening a door to some strangers , prowling like our friends about the church . The latter follow , the little monk enveloping them too in his civil smile . Down some steps into the great cloister , under whose arches pale frescoes cover the ancient walls — where in Florence are there not frescoes?—and the hands that painted them seem all to have wielded their brushes in that astounding fifteenth century , which was to Florence 's life what May is to Italy 's year . For some moments they stand silent , side by side , perhaps picking out familiar scenes from among the sweet faded groups — a slim Rebecca listening to Eliezar 's tale , and looking maiden pleasure at his gifts ; a shivering Adam and Eve chased out of Paradise ; an Adam and Eve dismally digging and stitching respectively ; Old Testament stories that time has blurred , that weather — even in this dry air — has rubbed out and bedimmed , and that yet , in many cases , still tell their curious faint tale decipherably . "
115563	115610	115295	115295	I	0	" says Mrs. Byng presently , growing a little tired of her companion 's taciturnity , being indeed always one of those persons who are of opinion that the gold of which silence is said to be made has a good deal of alloy in it . "
115620	115738	115295	115295	I	0	" He speaks almost under his breath , either because he has no great confidence in his voice , if he employ a higher key , or because there seems to him a certain sanctity in this promised meeting on the kindly hither side of the grave which has so lately yawned . Mrs. Byng is much too old and intimate a friend of Jim 's not to have been pretty well aware of the state of his feelings during the past eight years , though certainly not through any communication from him . So it is , perhaps , scarcely to be wondered at that she presently says , in a tone tinged with admiring surprise : "
115746	115839	115741	115741	you	0	" He receives the remark in a jarred silence , his eye resting on the square of neglected graves in the middle of the cloister , how unlike our turfy quads and lawns . A commonplace nineteenth century photographer , with his vulgar camera planted on the time - worn stones , is evidently trying to persuade the little monk to pose for his picture . The gentle - looking Fra laughs , and draws up his cowl , then lowers it again , folding his arms , and trying various postures . "
115851	115877	115840	115840	You	0	" This speech — though such is certainly far from the good - natured speaker 's intention — stings Burgoyne like a whip - lash . "
115898	115904	115905	115905	I	0	know!"—with an accent of almost anguished appeal—"that
115917	115918	115897	115897	you	0	" "
115931	115948	115928	115928	you	0	" replies she , astonished and concerned at the evident and extreme distress of his tone . "
115965	115974	115989	115989	Tilburina	327	But"—with a laugh that is at once uneasy and reassuring—"what
116024	116082	116016	116016	they	3155	" But her light and well - meant words fail to remove the painful impression from her hearer 's mind . Has she , during all these years , been crediting him with a wish for Amelia 's death , that she should be so much astonished at his thankfulness for her being given back to him ? "
116100	116128	116083	116083	I	0	" continues Mrs. Byng , feeling uncomfortably that she has not been happy in her choice of a topic , and yet unable to leave it alone . "
116139	116141	116150	116150	I	0	fact"—again laughing nervously—"I
116205	116234	116201	116202	the Yankees	2166	" The words are scarcely out of Mrs. Byng 's mouth before she adds , in a changed key , and with an altered direction of the eyes — "
116251	116363	116242	116242	He	3992	" Jim turns his head at her speech , and at once recognises in the figure hastening towards them the porter of the Anglo - Américain hotel . The man looks strangely , and carries a slip of paper , unfolded and open , in his hand . In a second Jim has sprung to his side , has snatched the paper , and is staring at its contents . They are hardly legible , scrawled tremblingly with a pencil , and for a moment he can not make them out . Then , as he looks , in one horrible flash their import has sprung into his eyes and brain . "
116372	116405	116364	116364	She	2168	" Mrs. Byng is reading too , over his shoulder . In going over the scene in memory afterwards , he believes that she gives a sort of scream , and says , "
116418	116899	116900	116900	She	2169	" But at the time he hears , he knows nothing . He is out of the church ; he is in the fiacre waiting at the door : he is tearing through the streets , with the hot summer air flowing in a quick current against his face . He thinks afterwards at what a pace the horse must have been going , and how the poor jade must have been lashed to keep it up to that useless speed . At the time he thinks nothing , he feels nothing . He rushes through the court of the hotel , rushes through what seem to be people ; he thinks afterwards that they must have been waiters and chambermaids , and that there came a sort of compassionate murmur from them as he passed . He is up the stairs , the three flights ; as he tears up , three steps at a time , there comes across his numbed intelligence a flash of wonder why they always give Amelia the worst room . He is at that door , outside which he has spent so many hours of breathless listening ; he need no longer stay outside it now . It is open , inviting him in . He is across that , as yet , unpassed threshold , that threshold over which he was to have stepped in careful , soft - footed joy to - morrow . He has pushed through the people — why must there be people everywhere?—of whom the room seems full , unnecessarily full ; he is at the bedside . Across the foot a figure seems thrown — he learns afterwards that that is Sybilla . Another figure is prostrate on the floor , heaving , in dreadful dry sobs ; that is Cecilia . A third is standing upright and tearless , looking down upon what , an hour ago , was his most patient daughter . They have left her alone now — have ceased to tease her . They no longer hold a looking - glass to her pale mouth , or beat her tired feet , or pour useless cordials between her lips . They have ceased to cry out upon her name , having realized that she is much too far away to hear them . Neither does he cry out . He just goes and stands by the father , and takes his thin old hand in his ; and together they gaze on that poor temple , out of which the spirit that was so much too lovely for it has fleeted . Later on they tell him how it came about ; later on , when they are all sitting huddled in the little dark salon . Cecilia is the spokeswoman , and Sybilla puts in sobbing corrections now and again . "
116935	116936	116931	116932	the nurse	2170	" "
116940	116965	116931	116932	the nurse	2170	" corrects Sybilla , who has forgotten to lie down upon her sofa , and is sitting on a hard chair like anyone else . "
116969	116973	116931	116932	the nurse	2170	" continues Cecilia , "
117052	117053	117055	117055	she	2169	" "
117066	117108	117055	117055	she	2169	" cries Sybilla , breaking into a loud wail . Then comes a dreadful and incongruous flash of that ridiculous , which is the underlining to all our tragedies , across Jim 's mind at this last lament . The going , "
117113	117141	117055	117055	she	2169	" naturally seems to Sybilla the most terrible feature in the whole case , to her who has so repeatedly taken heartrending last farewells of her family . "
117154	117205	117206	117206	Jim	181	" pursues Sybilla , still sobbing noisily , and without the least attempt at self - control . Cecilia , who is sitting with her head on her arms resting on the table , lifts her tear - blurred face and answers this apostrophe in a voice choked with weeping . "
117221	117497	117210	117210	he	181	" Again that dreadful impulse towards mirth assails Burgoyne . Is it possible that , at such an hour , he can feel a temptation to laugh out loud ? But , later again , this horrible mood passes ; later , when they have all grown more composed , when their tears run more gently , when their voices are less suffocated , and they are telling each other little anecdotes of her , aiding each other 's memories to recall half - effaced traits of her homely kindness , of her noiseless self - denials , of her deep still piety . They bring out her photographs , mourning over their being so few , and such old and long - ago ones . There are effigies by the dozen of Cecilia , and even touching presentments of Sybilla stretched in wasted grace upon her day bed ; but it had never occurred to anyone — least of all to Amelia herself — that there is any need for her image to be perpetuated . And now they are searching out , as treasures most precious , the scanty faded likenesses that exist of her , planning how they can be enlarged , and repeated , and daintily framed , and generally done homage and tender reverence to . Jim listens , occasionally putting in a low word or two , when appealed to to confirm or correct the details of some little story about her . But it seems to him as if his anguish only begins when the stream of their reminiscences turns into the channel of her love for him . "
117559	117617	117558	117558	I	0	know!"—hastily—"that you were not to blame , that you were in out - of - the - way places , where there was no post : but there were sometimes long gaps between your letters ; and we always knew — did not we?—when she had heard from you by her face , long before she spoke . "
117622	117665	117712	117712	Sybilla	221	" How she fired up if anyone said anything slightingly of you : she never cared in the least if one abused herself ; she always thought she quite deserved it ; but if anybody dared to say the least disparaging thing of you"—it
117694	117702	117685	117685	Jim	181	occurrence—"she was like a lioness at once . "
117703	117710	117712	117712	Sybilla	221	" The saddest thing of all , "
117720	117737	117712	117712	Sybilla	221	" is that she should have died just as she was beginning to be so happy ! "
117807	117868	117803	117803	they	2179	" Did you ever see anything so radiant as she was — that last fortnight ? She used to say that she was quite ashamed of being so much more fortunate than anyone else , she seemed always trying to make up to us for not being so happy as she . Oh , she was happy that last fortnight ! "
120619	120624	120616	120616	Burgoyne	181	" the new man , "
121255	121267	121279	121279	her	2303	" They are nice - looking people , are they not ? "
121291	121341	121279	121279	her	2303	" but they give themselves great airs ; nobody in the hotel is good enough for them to speak to . M. Cipriani evidently thinks them people of importance ; he makes twice as much fuss about them as he does about anyone else . Look at him now ! "
122493	122501	122476	122476	he	210	" That is what they always do ! "
122536	122563	122476	122476	he	210	" That is what they always do — come long after dinner has begun , and go out long before it has ended . Such swagger ! "
122597	122599	122600	122600	Elizabeth	193	" swaggering "
122644	122650	122652	122652	Elizabeth	193	" Did you see him ? "
122694	122719	122720	122720	She	193	" What is he doing here ? Why has he come ? When first I caught sight of him I thought that of course — "
122726	122777	122720	122720	She	193	" and when I saw that he was alone I was relieved ; but I was disappointed too ! Oh , I must be a fool — a bad fool — but I was disappointed ! Oh , mammy ! mammy ! how seeing him again brings it all back ! "
122778	122790	122792	122794	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" Do not cry , dear child ! do not cry ! "
122810	122825	122802	122802	she	189	" Your father will be in directly ; and you know how angry — — "
122826	122835	122837	122837	Elizabeth	193	" I will not ! I will not ! "
122852	122880	122837	122837	Elizabeth	193	" and I do not show it much when I have been crying ; my eyes do not mind it as much as most people 's ; I suppose"—with
122884	122892	122802	122802	she	189	smile—"because they are so used to it ! "
122893	122901	122903	122904	the mother	579	" Perhaps he will not stay long , "
122922	122935	122903	122904	the mother	579	" perhaps if we are careful we may avoid speaking to him . "
122936	122944	122951	122951	her	3289	" But I must speak to him , "
122957	122982	122951	122951	her	3289	" I must ask him ; I must find out ; why , we do not even know whether Willy is dead or alive ! "
122983	122989	122991	122993	the elder woman	3305	" He is not dead , "
123001	123044	122991	122993	the elder woman	3305	" if he had been , we should have seen it in the papers ; and , besides , why should he be ? Grief does not kill ; nobody , Elizabeth , is better able to attest that than you and I. "
123060	123065	123066	123066	she	193	" He is aged , "
123088	123128	123083	123085	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" He must have cared more for that poor creature than we gave him credit for . Get up , darling ; dry your eyes , and sit with your back to the light ; here comes your father ! "
123271	123273	123241	123241	He	181	" Amelia "
123477	123491	123528	123529	M. Cipriani	330	" Blank misgivings of a creature , Moving about in worlds not realized , "
123565	123577	123578	123578	His	181	" Mr. , Mrs. , and Miss Le Marchant , England . "
123983	123997	123999	123999	she	2371	" We are not so green for nothing , I can tell you , "
125426	125429	125415	125415	she	222	" Jim ! "
125464	125471	125472	125472	Burgoyne	181	" father , here is Jim ! "
125564	125568	125544	125544	Cecilia	222	" very dressy . "
125622	125640	125619	125619	he	202	" ' Sh , Cecilia ! do not talk so loud . How are you , Jim ? "
125753	125860	125746	125746	Her	2456	" It is so nice to see you again ! When did you come ? We did not expect you quite so soon ; in your last letter you were rather vague as to dates ; I ca n't say that you shine as a correspondent . You will come back to luncheon with us , of course , will not you ? déjeûner , as they call it here ; I always thought déjeûner meant breakfast . You will come , will not you ? Sybilla will be so glad to see you — glad , that is to say , in her dismal way . "
126019	126025	126027	126027	Cecilia	222	" Is not he beautiful ? "
126086	126103	126104	126104	herself	2467	" is not he beautiful ? When first we came here we were in mourning ; as if"—catching
126109	126160	126104	126104	herself	2467	sigh—"there were any need to tell you that ; and father wanted to put him into black , but I would not hear of it : was not I right ? He would have been nothing in black ; it is his red and yellow that give him his cachet . "
126228	126236	126209	126209	he	181	" I think you were perfectly right . "
126297	126307	126284	126284	her	2467	" How nice it is to see you again ! "
126308	126312	126313	126313	His	181	" Thank you . "
126344	126356	126357	126357	Cecilia	222	" And you — how have you all been getting on ? "
126362	126430	126359	126359	her	2467	" We are better off than we were ; you know that , of course . Nobody ever thought that father 's brother would have died before him . Wait till you see our villa — it is one of the show ones here ; and of course it is very pleasant having more money ; but one can not help wishing that it had come earlier . "
126490	126517	126486	126486	she	222	" I think that one may be very bright - coloured outside , and very black inside . Father and I are sometimes very black inside . "
126518	126522	126486	126486	she	222	" Are you ? "
126523	126575	126576	126576	She	222	" We do very well when we are alone together , father and I ; we like to talk about her . Dear me ! what a place Algiers is for dust ! that is why there are so many blind people here . How it gets into one 's eyes ! "
126619	126634	126602	126602	he	181	" Sybilla begins to cry if we even distantly allude to her ; yet I know"—with
126635	126682	126615	126615	she	222	exasperation—"that she talks of her by the hour to strangers — to her new doctor , for instance ; yes , she has picked up a new doctor here — a dreadful little adventurer ! She will probably talk of nothing else but her to you . "
126683	126687	126688	126688	They	2471	" God forbid ! "
126799	126812	126813	126813	she	221	" When I think — when I think of our last meeting ! "
126817	126820	126821	126821	he	181	" Yes , "
126826	126840	126821	126821	he	181	" yes , of course . What a beautiful villa you have here ! "
127077	127104	127068	127069	the invalid	3676	" It is very beautiful ; and , of course , it is everything for weary eyes to have such pleasant objects to rest upon . I believe"—with
127107	127155	127068	127069	the invalid	3676	laugh—"that we sick people really take in most of our nourishment through the eyes . Was not it wonderfully enterprising of us to come here ? I suppose your first thought when you heard the news was , ' How mad of Sybilla to attempt it ! ' "
127186	127201	127180	127180	him	181	" But you were none the worse ? you got over it all right ? "
127202	127208	127210	127210	she	3676	" I was really wonderful , "
127212	127215	127210	127210	she	3676	" we sick people"—with
127220	127313	127314	127314	Her	3676	playfulness—"do give you well ones these surprises sometimes ; but I must not take the credit to myself : it is really every bit due to Dr. Crump , my new doctor , who is a perfect marvel of intuition . I always tell him that he never need ask ; he divines how one is ; he says he is a mere bundle of nerves himself ; that is , I suppose , why one can talk to him upon subjects that are sealed books with one 's nearest and dearest . "
127476	127490	127492	127492	Cecilia	222	" We quarrel more than we used to do , do not we ? "
127524	127549	127505	127505	she	222	" and to - day we were better than usual , because you were by . Oh , I wish you were always by ! "
127599	127623	127628	127628	he	181	" I do hope you will not drop us altogether . Of course , now that the link that bound us to you is broken"—her
127645	127666	127628	127628	he	181	him—"there is nothing to hold you any longer ; but I do trust you will not quite throw us over . "
127667	127707	127628	127628	he	181	" My dear old girl , why should I ? I hope that you and I shall always be the best of friends , and that before long I shall see you settled in a home of your own . "
127708	127720	127628	127628	he	181	" You mean that I shall marry ? Well , to be sure"—with
127743	127762	127628	127628	he	181	heart—"I ought to have a better chance now than ever , as I shall have a larger fortune ; but"—with
127766	127811	127817	127817	one	501	depression—"this is not a good place for men — I mean Englishmen . There are troops of delightful - looking Frenchmen , Chasseurs d'Afrique , and Zouaves ; but , then , we do not know any of them — not one . Well , perhaps"—philosophically—"it
127827	127978	127817	127817	one	501	" Notre Dame d'Afrique — Lady of Africa — is an ugly lady , homely and black ; and the church that is dedicated to her is ugly too — new and mock - Moorish ; but , like many another ugly lady , being very nobly placed , she has a great and solemn air . It is Our Lady of Africa who first gives us our greeting as we steam in from seawards ; it is to Our Lady of Africa that the fisher - people climb to vespers , and to the touching office that follows , when priests and acolytes pass out of the church to the little plateau outside , where , sheer against the sky , stands a small Latin cross , with a plain and , as it seems , coffin - shaped stone beneath it , on which one reads the inscription : "
128001	128002	127817	127817	one	501	" "
128019	128696	127817	127817	one	501	" What a gigantic company to be covered with one little epitaph ! Notre Dame d'Afrique stands grandly on the cliff - tops , overlooking the sea , whose cruel deeds she is so agonizedly prayed to avert , whose cruelty she is sometimes powerful to assuage , witness the frequent votive tablets with which the church walls are covered : She does not look very lovable , this coal - black Marie , who stands in her stiff brocade , with her ebon hands stretched straight out above the high - altar ; but how tenderly these poor fisherwives must have felt towards her when she brought them back their Pierre or their Jean , from the truculent deeps of the ocean ! Burgoyne has been told , both by his guide - book and by his table - d'hôte neighbour , that he ought to see Notre Dame d'Afrique ; nor is he loth to pay further obeisance to that high lady who already yesterday beckoned to him across the blue floor of her waters . He does not tell Cecilia of his intention , as he knows that she would offer to accompany him ; but on leaving her he takes his way through the gay French town , along its Arab - named streets , Bab - a - Zoun and Bab - el - Oued , towards the village of St. Eugène , and breasts the winding road that , with many an elbow and bend , heading a deep gorge that runs up from the sea to the church - foot , leads him within her portals . The congregation is sparse — a few peasants , a blue and red Zouave , and several inevitable English . Now and again a woman , clad in humble black that tells of prayers in vain , goes up with her thin candle , and , lighting it , sticks it in its sconce among the others that burn before the altar . For awhile Burgoyne finds it pleasant after his climb to sit and watch her , and speculate pityingly with what hope of still possible good to herself she is setting her slender taper alight — now that her treasure has all too obviously gone down beneath the waves ; to sit and speculate , and smell the heady incense , and listen to the murmur of chanted supplication ; but presently , growing weary of the uncomprehended service , he slips outside to the little plateau , with its view straight out — no importunate land - object intervening — towards the sea , across which a little steamer is cutting her way ; and on the horizon two tiny shining sails are lying . Here , on this bold headland , it seems as if one were one 's self in mid - ocean ; and one has to lean far over the low wall in order to realize that there is some solid earth between us and it ; that two full cities of the dead — a Jewish and a Christian — lie below . From the land - cemeteries to the vast sea - cemetery — for read by the light of that plain inscription upon which his eyes are resting , what is even the azure Mediterranean but a grave ? For the matter of that , what is all life but a grave ? He turns away , and , muttering these words half absently between his lips , begins to make the circuit of the church ; and in doing so , comes suddenly upon three persons who are apparently similarly employed . The party consists of a man and two ladies . Being a little ahead of him , they are , for the first moment or two , not aware of his presence , an ignorance by which he , rather to his own discomfiture , profits to overhear a scrap of their conversation certainly not intended for his ears . "
128709	128727	128700	128700	you	2493	" Mr. Le Marchant is saying , with an accent of cold severity , to his daughter ; "
128750	128852	128735	128735	you	2493	" Jim starts , partly at having happened so unexpectedly upon the people before him , partly in shocked astonishment at the harshness both of voice and words . In the old days Elizabeth had been the apple of her father 's eye , to oppose whose lightest fancy was a capital offence , for whom no words could be too sugared , no looks too doting . Yet now she answers , with the sweetest good - humour , and without the slightest sign of surprise or irritation , or any indication that the occurrence is not a habitual one : "
128871	128872	128873	128873	I	0	" "
128879	128887	128877	128877	you	2493	" replies the father , entirely unmollified ; "
128912	128913	128888	128888	I	0	" "
128921	128953	128888	128888	I	0	" breaks in Mrs. Le Marchant , throwing herself anxiously , and with a dexterity which shows how frequently she is called upon to do so , between the two others ; "
128969	128970	128971	128971	You	2493	" "
128977	128990	128971	128971	You	2493	" cries Elizabeth impetuously , but still with the same perfect sweetness ; "
129010	129057	129058	129058	You	2493	" So saying , she , with the speed of lightning , whips off the garment alluded to , and proceeds to guide her mother 's arms into its inconveniently tight sleeves , laughing the while with her odd childish light - heartedness , and crying , "
129068	129123	129058	129058	You	2493	" The mother laughs too , and aids her daughter 's efforts ; nor does it seem to occur to any of the three that the fatal Southern chill may possibly strike the delicate little frame of Elizabeth , now exposed , so lightly clad in her tweed gown , to its insidious influence . "
129137	129146	129149	129149	she	0	" cries she , rippling into fresh mirth ; "
129155	129526	129149	129149	she	0	" appealing to him with as little resentment for his past surliness as would be shown by a good dog ( I can not put it more strongly ) , and yet , as it seems to Jim , with a certain nervous deprecation . The next moment one of them — he does not know which — has caught sight of himself , and the moment after he is shaking hands with all three . It is clear that the fact of his presence in Algiers has been notified to Mr. Le Marchant , for there is no surprise in his coldly civil greeting . He makes it as short as possible , and almost at once turns to continue his circuit of the church , his wife at his side , and his daughter meekly following . Doubtless they do not wish for his ( Jim 's ) company ; but yet , as he was originally , and without any reference to them , going in their direction , it would seem natural that he should walk along with them . He is hesitating as to whether or no to adopt this course , when he is decided by a very slight movement of Elizabeth 's head . She does not actually look over her shoulder at him , and yet it seems to him as if , were her gesture completed , it would amount to that ; but it is arrested by some impulse before it is more than sketched . Such as it is , it suffices to take him to her side ; and it seems to him that there is a sort of satisfaction mingled with the undoubted apprehension in her face , as she realizes that it is so . Her eyes , as she turns them upon him , have a hungry question in them which her lips seem afraid to put . Apparently she can not get nearer to it than this — very tremblingly and hurriedly uttered , with a timid glance at her father 's back , as if she were delivering herself of some compromising secret instead of the mere platitude which she so indistinctly vents : "
129543	129590	129591	129593	A great many	2498	" Her eye travels for a moment to his hat , from which , unlike Cecilia 's rainbow raiment , the crape band has not yet been removed ; and he understands that she is comprehending his troubles as well as her own in the phrase . "
129595	129692	129693	129693	I	0	" he answers baldly . He has not the cruelty to wish to keep her on tenterhooks , and he knows perfectly what is the question that is written in the wistful blue of her look , and whom it concerns ; but it would be impertinence in him to take for granted that knowledge , and answer that curiosity which , however intense and apparent , has yet not become the current coin of speech . Probably she sees that he is unable or unwilling to help her , for she makes another tremendous effort . "
129705	129706	129707	129709	All my friends	2500	" "
129711	129718	129707	129709	All my friends	2500	" repeats he , half sadly ; "
129736	129801	129803	129803	you	0	" His thoughts have reverted to his own loss , for , at the moment , Amelia is very present to him ; but the words are no sooner out of his mouth than he sees how false is the impression produced by his reply — sees it written in the sudden dead - whiteness of her cheek and the terror in her eye . "
129804	129805	129803	129803	you	0	mean"—she stammers—"that
129819	129820	129803	129803	you	0	" "
129826	129831	129803	129803	you	0	" he cries reassuringly ; "
129845	129847	129832	129832	you	0	is"—with a sigh—"that
129873	129874	129875	129875	Elizabeth	193	" "
129877	130225	129875	129875	Elizabeth	193	" breaks in Mr. Le Marchant 's voice , in severe appellation ; he has only just become aware that his daughter is not unaccompanied , and the discovery apparently does not please him . Without a second 's delay , despite her twenty - seven years , she has sprung forwards to obey the summons ; and Jim has the sense to make no further effort to rejoin her . By the time that their circuit is finished , and they have again reached the front of the church , vespers are ended , and there is a movement outwards among the worshippers . They stream — not very numerous — out on the little terrace . The priests follow , tonsured , but — which looks strange — with beards and whiskers . The acolytes , in their red chasubles , carry a black and white pall , and lay it over the memorial stone below the cross . On either hand stand a band of decently clad youths — sons of drowned seamen — playing on brass instruments . It is a poor little music , doubtfully in tune ; but surely no rolling organ , no papal choir , could touch the heart so much as this simple ceremonial . The little Latin cross standing sheer out against the sea ; the black pall thrown over the stone that commemorates the sea 's innumerable dead ; the red - clad acolytes , standing with eyes cast down , holding aloft their high tapers , whose flickering flame the sea - wind soon puffs out ; and the sons of the drowned sailors , making their homely music to the accompaniment of the salt breeze . The little service is brief and those who have taken part in it are soon dispersing . As they do so , Jim once more finds himself for a moment close to Elizabeth . The sun has nearly touched the sea - line by this time , and he sees , or thinks he sees , her shiver . "
130230	130235	130226	130226	You	2509	" he says solicitously ; "
130242	130262	130264	130264	I	0	" She looks back at him , half surprised , half grateful , at the anxiety of his tone . "
130266	130279	129875	129875	Elizabeth	193	" she answers , with a gentle air of indifference and recklessness ; "
130286	130287	130300	130300	I	0	" "
130297	130298	130292	130292	I	0	" "
130304	130321	130300	130300	I	0	only"—smiling—"that a goose walked over my grave . Does a goose never walk over your grave ? "
130572	130575	130552	130552	One	501	" gunébri , "
130653	130662	130644	130644	He	501	" You were not at dinner last night ? "
130663	130666	130646	130646	his	501	" No . "
130667	130679	130680	130680	Her	2525	" I hope that did not mean that you were ill ? "
130705	130713	130714	130714	she	2525	" No , I was not ill , "
130718	130746	130747	130747	she	2525	" but I had made such a figure of myself by crying that mammy thought I had better stay away . When I looked in the glass , "
130751	130757	130747	130747	she	2525	" I thought so myself . "
130758	130776	130777	130777	he	501	" There was not much sign of tears about you when we parted at Notre Dame d'Afrique , "
130781	130784	130789	130789	her	2525	" No , but"—with
130791	130825	130826	130826	She	2525	lashes—"you know there is never any medium in me ; I am always either laughing or crying ; and , of course , seeing you again brought — brought things back to me . "
131158	131163	131165	131165	Elizabeth	193	" I always think , "
131172	131192	131200	131200	her	2525	eyes—"perhaps it may be fancy — that this particular corner of the sky is much bluer than any other . "
131344	131374	131329	131332	A pert English miss	2538	" You can get this 7 - 1/2d . cheaper at Whiteley 's . I saw a much better one than this for half the price at Marshall 's , "
131385	131387	131384	131386	the " miss	4854	" miss "
131459	131482	131484	131484	Elizabeth	193	" She does not get on with her own family at home , and she has quarrelled with all her travelling companions ! "
131511	131561	131562	131562	Jim	181	" The fat widow in the weepers , who is preening herself like a great pouter pigeon , is trying to marry the wizened old gentleman in the bamboo chair . Sometimes we think she will succeed ; sometimes we think she will not : it is so interesting ! "
131607	131620	131622	131622	she	193	" Mammy and I get an infinity of amusement out of them , "
131638	131663	131622	131622	she	193	" oh , we know a great deal about them all ; and those that we do not know about we make stories for ! "
131664	131667	131668	131668	His	181	" Indeed ! "
131710	131724	131685	131685	she	193	" You said just now that seeing me brought things back to you . "
131794	131799	131800	131800	she	193	" Yes — yes , "
131803	131817	131800	131800	she	193	" but ' brought things back ' is not quite the right phrase ; they"—her
131822	131829	131800	131800	she	193	tremulous—"had not very far to come . "
131848	131859	131860	131860	he	181	" If you would like to ask me any questions , "
131864	131872	131860	131860	he	181	" I am ready to answer them . "
131873	131877	131878	131878	she	193	" Are you ? "
131882	131902	131878	131878	she	193	" oh , that is kind of you ! but , then , you always were kind ; but not here"—looking
131904	131925	131860	131860	he	181	round—"I could not trust myself to talk about — about him here ; I — I should break down , and nothing"—with
131935	131949	131860	131860	he	181	humorous—"would induce me to make a fool of myself before the widow Wadman . "
131959	131963	131964	131964	she	193	" Come indoors ! "
131985	132022	131964	131964	she	193	" Come into our salon — no , you need not be afraid ; we shall have it all to ourselves ; father and mother have gone out for their usual constitutional on the Boulevard Mustapha . "
132189	132194	132195	132195	he	181	" An old acquaintance ! "
132205	132222	132195	132195	he	181	" it is in better order than when last I had the pleasure of seeing it . "
132223	132230	132231	132231	she	193	" Do you mean in Florence ? "
132237	132238	132231	132231	she	193	" Yes"—still
132242	132323	132324	132324	She	193	smile—"after you were gone , I had the honour of helping to pack it to send after you . I am afraid I was rather clumsy over it ; but , at any rate , I managed better than he . By - the - bye , did you find any rust on your scissors and thimble when next you had occasion to use them ? Poor boy ! he cried enough over them to take all the polish off ! "
132348	132355	132356	132356	she	193	" Do not sneer at me ! "
132360	132382	132356	132356	she	193	" You would not if you knew how you hurt me . Is he — is he — how is he ? "
132383	132389	132324	132324	She	193	" He is not ill . "
132476	132481	132483	132483	Jim	181	" When a man , "
132486	132528	132483	132483	Jim	181	" at the outset of his life , gets such a facer as he did , if he has not a very strong character , it is apt to drive him off the rails , to give him a shove downwards . "
132529	132544	132483	132483	Jim	181	" I see ; and you think I have given him a shove downwards ? "
132545	132548	132483	132483	Jim	181	" Yes . "
132651	132669	132629	132629	she	193	" If I had married him , I should have given him a much worse shove down . "
132724	132757	132758	132758	He	181	" You would be doing the kindest thing that you ever did in your life , if you could bring yourself to say that you thought I did it for the best . "
132850	132866	132867	132867	he	181	" I could not possibly say that unless I knew the circumstances of the case , "
132886	132897	132915	132915	her	193	" Then you must go on thinking ill of me . "
132950	132961	132962	132962	he	181	" I do not wish to think ill of you , "
132966	133018	132962	132962	he	181	" Good heavens ! do I need to tell you that ? I have tried all along to keep myself from judging you ; but I should not be human — you must know that I should not be human — if I did not ask myself why you did it . "
133019	133025	133030	133030	She	193	" Why I left Florence ? "
133026	133029	133030	133030	She	193	" Yes . "
133055	133069	133070	133070	He	181	" If I told you that , I should be telling you everything . "
133180	133187	133166	133166	He	181	" Then do not tell me . "
133248	133263	133238	133238	He	181	" How did he take it ? how did he take it at first ? "
133289	133310	133264	133264	Her	193	" He would not believe it at first ; and then he cried a great deal — oh , an immense deal!"—with
133326	133342	133343	133343	Jim	181	power—"and then — oh , then , he thought of putting an end to himself ! "
133411	133417	133418	133418	he	181	" Do not be afraid ! "
133444	133506	133418	133418	he	181	" the impulse was a short - lived one ; he is not thinking of putting an end to himself now , I can assure you of that ; he is only thinking of how he can best amuse himself . Whether he is much more successful in that than he was in the former , I am not so sure . "
133525	133532	133533	133533	she	2569	" Poor boy ! poor boy ! "
133571	133583	133584	133584	he	181	" It was a pity you let it go so far , "
133588	133622	133584	133584	he	181	" you must allow me to say that much ; but I suppose , in point of fact , the ball once set rolling , it was past your power to stop it . "
133635	133641	133642	133642	she	2569	" I did not try , "
133676	133732	133733	133733	herself	2569	" I said to myself , ' If I have any luck , I shall die before the smash comes ; ' and I just lived on from day to day . I had not the heart to stop it ; I knew it would stop of itself before long ; I had never — hardly ever"—correcting
133742	133756	133733	133733	herself	2569	afterthought—"in my life before known what happiness meant ; and oh ! oh ! OH!"—with
133765	133772	133733	133733	herself	2569	interjection—"what a big word it is ! "
133871	133873	133862	133862	she	2569	" hardly "
133926	133934	133911	133911	he	181	" Hardly ever , that implies — — "
133971	133996	133997	133997	She	2569	" Talking of happiness makes one think of unhappiness , does not it ? We both know something about that , do not we ? "
134085	134124	134125	134125	She	2569	" We saw it in the papers ; I could not believe it at first . It was the last thing I ever expected to happen . I thought of writing to you , but I did not . "
134207	134222	134224	134224	her	2569	" It seemed such a pity that it was she , and not I ! "
134276	134292	134298	134298	she	2569	" I said so to mammy at the time . Ah , here is mammy ! "
134348	134356	134358	134358	Elizabeth	193	" I brought Mr. Burgoyne in here , "
134367	134399	134358	134358	Elizabeth	193	" because we could not talk comfortably out on the terrace ; they listen to everything we say : they have such long ears — the Widow Wadman and Miss Strutt ! "
134400	134417	134419	134420	the mother	579	" I do not know what State secrets you and Mr. Burgoyne can have to discuss , "
134437	134457	134419	134420	the mother	579	" Yes , dear child , I shall be very much obliged if you will take my bonnet upstairs for me"—this
134480	134492	134495	134495	Jim	181	" I do not know whether you have yet found it so "
134498	134506	134495	134495	Jim	181	" but this is a slack place . "
134521	134531	134532	134532	she	579	" What have you been talking about to her , "
134536	134545	134532	134532	she	579	" not , I hope , about him ? "
134546	134557	134558	134560	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" I could not help it ; she asked me . "
134584	134589	134562	134562	her	579	" Th ! th ! "
134594	134651	134667	134667	Jim	181	" I am sure you will understand that I do not mean to imply any ill - will to you ; but it is unlucky that we should have happened to meet you here ; it has brought it all back to her , and she was just beginning to pluck up her spirits a little . "
134652	134665	134667	134667	Jim	181	" Did she — did she take it so much to heart ? "
134699	134707	134709	134711	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" Did she take it to heart ! "
134729	134752	134709	134711	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" why , of course she did ! I thought at one time that she would have gone out of her mind ! "
134782	134796	134797	134797	he	181	" And I thought that he would have gone out of his mind , "
134954	134964	134950	134950	he	181	" It seems a pity — a great pity ! "
134965	134969	134971	134972	the mother	579	" A pity ! "
134991	135022	135023	135023	She	579	" I should think it was a pity ! Pity is a weak word ! The whole thing is piteous ! her whole history ! If you only knew — — "
135070	135080	135082	135082	Jim	181	" They were so well suited to each other , "
135109	135147	135096	135096	he	181	" Is it — I do not wish to intrude upon your confidence , but in the interests of my friend you will allow me to say that much — is it quite out of the question ? "
135148	135153	135155	135156	the mother	579	" Quite ! quite ! "
135162	135213	135155	135156	the mother	579	" what , poor soul , is not out of the question for her that has any good or happiness in it ? and that — that more than anything ! If you have any mercy in you , do not put it into her head that it is not ! "
135214	135231	135233	135233	Jim	181	" If it is not in her head already , I could not put it there , "
135236	135249	135233	135233	Jim	181	" but I will not — I promise you I will not . "
135299	135307	135309	135311	the poor woman	553	" That is very kind of you ! "
135314	135373	135374	135374	she	553	" and I am sure when you say a thing I can depend upon you for it ; and though , of course , it was unlucky our happening to meet you , yet you need not see much of her . Although it is not in the least ' out of sight , out of mind ' with her"—sighing—"yet
135426	135500	135391	135391	I	0	" She breaks off , and her imploring eye invites him to reassure her by naming a speedy day for his own departure . But magnanimity may have calls made upon it that exceed its power to answer , and Jim 's silence sufficiently proves that he is not going to allow himself to be seduced into a promise to go . The next morning proves the truth of Miss Strutt 's words that "
135512	135671	135391	135391	I	0	" The weather changes some time after dark has fallen . A mighty wind arises . Jim 's slumbers are broken by the fact that somebody 's outside shutters bang , loose and noisy all night . The great sign at the top of the hotel swings and creaks and groans . In the morning , as far as can be seen through blurred panes , the trees — eucalyptus , ilex , stone - pine — are all cowering and stooping before the wind 's lash . The fan palm before Mrs. Le Marchant 's window , with its fans all pinched and bent , is staggering before the gale . One can not conceive what that unlucky tropical product can be doing in this galley , and it requires a strong effort of reason and will to resist the conviction that the oranges and lemons are tied upon the shivering trees instead of growing naturally there . "
135682	135860	135676	135676	Afric	347	" says Jim to himself , over his breakfast in the salle à manger , through whose shut windows the mad rain forces itself ; and the blast , coming to his wet sister 's aid , bursts them open now and again . The day seems enormously long . He gets through the morning tolerably well with letter - writing , and after the twelve o'clock déjeûner he faces the gale in a determined walk down into the town . Seldom in the course of his wide wanderings has he felt the furious scourge of more tremendous rain . The side - path is whitened with big hailstones ; red torrents tear with ferocious speed and violence down the steep incline . The great acanthus - leaves , and all the plentiful undergrowth , are dripping and rejoicing . Through the blinding white deluge he gets forlorn peeps of the villas that had shone yesterday with the white splendour one associates with the city of the saints of God ; and instead of , as yesterday , "
135868	136653	135676	135676	Afric	347	" the Mediterranean is whitening the bay 's rounded curve with its angry breakers , and the snow is sprinkling the Atlas crests . A few Arabs are sitting on the ground under the Pont d'Isly , packed up into whitish woollen parcels , knees to nose , and arms and hands all withdrawn into the protection of the sheltering burnous . But no one else , who can help it , is abroad . It seems to Jim as if his disagreeable tussle with the elements had lasted a long time , and yet , on his return to the hotel , he finds that it is only half - past two . He thinks at first that the clocks must have stopped , but finds , on examination , that they are all ticking , and all unanimous . His drenched condition is at least a resource , necessitating an entire and fundamental change of raiment ; but even this expedient , though dragged out to its utmost possible limit , does not carry him further than three . How is he to dispose of the seven or eight hours that must elapse before he can seek refuge in bed ? He has exhausted his correspondence , which is never a large one , and he has seldom in his life been so short of books . He makes his way through the hall , which is crammed with young people playing battledore , and noisily counting ; with elder persons , dreadfully short of a job , looking on and applauding ; to the salon , in hopes of there finding a Tauchnitz novel , or even a superannuated Pall Mall or World . But half a dozen other weather - bound sufferers have been before him , and the tables are swept clean of all literature save a three - months - old Court Journal . Miss Strutt and the pert votary of Whiteley are sitting shawled , and with their heads close together . By their titters , and the fragments he catches of their talk , they seem to be concocting a practical joke of some kind . The widow Wadman , shawled too , and her valetudinarian in a comforter , are stopping over a wood - fire , which refuses to burn , the souches being wringing wet . Jim rather injudiciously approaches them , and offers his assistance in piling the damp logs ; but he is so evidently de trop , that he retires discomfited . On the other hand , the invitation in Miss Strutt 's and her coadjutor 's eye is so apparent that he beats a hasty retreat out of the room , in dread lest he should be drawn into their mysterious pleasantry . He never is quite clear afterwards how he gets over the hours that intervene before dinner — whether sleep comes to his aid , or whether he is after all reduced to perusing in the Court Journal the narrative of which direction the Queen and Princess Henry of Battenburg took their walk in , in October . But at length the welcome bell rings , drowning even , for two minutes , the banging of the wind ; and the whole hotel , unwontedly punctual , rushes in answer to its summons . People who have hitherto scarcely exchanged words , have eyed each other with hardly veiled distrust , now show a feverish desire to enter into conversation , to detain one another after dinner on the steps of the salle à manger . As the evening advances , Jim sees an intention among the younger portion of the company to launch out into noisy , romping games , to institute a Dumb Crambo . He feels it is far from impossible that he himself may fall so low as to be drawn into it . Miss Strutt 's eye is on him , but before he succumbs he will make one effort on his own behalf . He embraces a desperate resolution . He has seen the Le Marchants eating their dinner near , and yet hopelessly far from him . Elizabeth had given him one furtive smile , and her mother a hurried bow ; this is , to tell the truth , all the encouragement he has to go upon — all that he can find to keep his courage up as he knocks at their door , telling himself that his excuse — that of asking them to lend him a book — is a quite sufficient and legitimate one . He knocks , and Elizabeth 's voice at once answers : "
136656	136796	136797	136797	I	0	" It is clear that she takes him for the German waiter , Fritz . She remains in this belief even after he has opened the door , since she does not at first look up . She is alone — not in the pretty flowered room in which she had yesterday received him , but in the first and less adorned of the little series — one that he had , on his former visit , cursorily supposed to be chiefly used as an ante - room — sitting alone at a table , and before her are spread writing - materials , over which she is stooping . An odious and ridiculous thought darts , with a prick , across his mind . Is she sitting here , all alone , in order to write to Byng ? "
136801	136817	136797	136797	I	0	" he begins ; and at the unexpected voice she looks up with a start : "
136824	136861	136822	136822	you	0	" she says , in a low key , glancing rather apprehensively at the closed door , which separates them from the inner room , in a manner which tells him that her parents are within . "
136863	136875	136797	136797	I	0	came"—his voice almost unconsciously sinking to the level hers has indicated to him—"to
136884	136885	136877	136877	you	0	" "
136889	136906	136907	136907	I	0	" she repeats doubtfully , with another and still more nervous glance at the shut door ; "
136917	136918	136907	136907	I	0	" "
136927	136942	136907	136907	I	0	" rejoins Burgoyne hastily , unwittingly quoting the words of the immortal Mr. Toots ; "
136951	137038	136907	136907	I	0	" As he speaks , he begins to retreat towards the door , but so slowly as to give her plenty of time to recall him had she so wished . But she does not . She only stands looking uncertain and distressed . He can not take such a melancholy impression of her little face away for the whole night with him — it would give him the blues too seriously after this dismal day — so he takes a step or two forward again . "
137045	137063	136907	136907	I	0	" he asks , with an expressive look round . She gives a small , uncomplaining smile . "
137110	137190	137191	137191	They	2585	" There is not the slightest trace of any sense of being aggrieved in either words or tone . Again that picture of the adored Elizabeth of former days , of whose prattle her father was never weary , whose jokes were always considered so unequalled , and whose pre - eminence in favour was so allowed that her intercession and influence were always employed by the others as certain in their efficacy , rises before Jim 's eyes . "
137197	137202	137191	137191	They	2585	" continues Elizabeth softly ; "
137217	137218	137220	137220	you	0	" "
137226	137227	137220	137220	you	0	" "
137242	137277	137278	137278	I	0	" A pang of shame at his unworthy suspicion , coupled with a sense of astonishment at her simple confession of friendlessness , prevent his speaking ; and it is she who goes on : "
137291	137303	137278	137278	I	0	Florence"—with the inevitable low sigh that always accompanies her mention of that name—"and
137337	137338	137278	137278	I	0	" "
137341	137346	137278	137278	I	0	" repeats Jim emphatically ; "
137364	137365	137366	137366	Someone	529	" "
137399	137530	137534	137534	they	529	" There is a suppressed envy in her tone , which tells how far from disagreeable the innocent noisy pastime to which she alludes would be to her even now . She has sat down again on the straight - backed chair from whose elevation she had commanded her Italian studies ; a large grayish cloak , lined and heavily collared , and bordered with fur , hangs , unfastened at the throat , about her . Out of the dark beaver her delicate neck and head rise , like a pale primrose from out of piled dead oak - leaves in a yet wintry wood . Through the door , which he has left open behind him , come bursts of maniac mirth from the votaries of Dumb Crambo . "
137538	137539	137543	137543	they	529	" "
137546	137547	137551	137551	they	529	" "
137555	137556	137551	137551	they	529	" "
137571	137606	137568	137569	Dumb Crambo	351	" She repeats the words after him with a lingering intonation , in which there again is , or , at least , he thinks that he detects it , a tinge of envy . "
137610	137611	137607	137608	Dumb Crambo	351	" "
137619	137620	137613	137613	you	0	" "
137621	137642	137607	137608	Dumb Crambo	351	No"—slowly—"not quite that ; but — it sounds ridiculous — but I should like to play Dumb Crambo again . We used"—in
137647	137655	137662	137662	she	0	tone—"to play it when we were children . "
137690	137704	137672	137672	he	2593	" I know you did ; once or twice I played with you . "
137705	137708	137709	137709	She	0	" You ? "
137757	137765	137745	137745	her	0	" Oh yes , to be sure ! "
137772	137796	137745	137745	her	0	" What odd words we used to choose sometimes — words that nobody could guess ! I wonder what words they have chosen ? "
137803	137811	137797	137797	He	2593	" Shall I go and ask them ? "
137842	137855	137857	137857	Elizabeth	193	" Do you think that that can be meant for a pig ? "
137867	137868	137857	137857	Elizabeth	193	" Oh!"—with
137872	137902	137857	137857	Elizabeth	193	uneasiness—"I wish that they would not make so much noise ; father does so dislike noise . They might as well have put it off till to - morrow . "
137903	137920	137857	137857	Elizabeth	193	" Why would to - morrow 's noise be more endurable than to - night 's ? "
137921	137944	137945	137945	Burgoyne	181	" It would not have mattered to - morrow ; father will not be here ; he is going to Hammam Rhira . "
137984	138002	137971	137971	she	189	" Do you mean — are you all going to Hammam Rhira to - morrow?—all going away ? "
138058	138102	138042	138042	his	2593	" Not to - morrow ; not all of us . Father and mammy are going there for a couple of nights to see what the place is like — one hears such contradictory accounts ; and if they are pleased with it — "
138103	138106	138042	138042	his	2593	" Yes ? "
138107	138127	138128	138128	He	2593	" If they are pleased with it we shall all probably move on there in a day or two . "
138164	138174	138042	138042	his	2593	" And they are going to leave you behind ? "
138175	138205	138236	138236	she	2597	" Why not ? there would not be much use in taking me ; and , as I tell you , they love being tête - à - tête . "
138206	138213	138042	138042	his	2593	" And you love being alone ? "
138310	138323	138306	138306	she	2597	" One certainly does hear dreadfully plainly here with the door open . "
138794	138801	138791	138792	some lady	2617	" with ravishing division to her lute "
138832	138840	138842	138842	Cecilia	222	" You will not mind staying here ? "
138844	138869	138842	138842	Cecilia	222	" Dr. Crump is in the drawing - room with Sybilla ; I am sure that you do not want to see Dr. Crump ! "
138870	138881	138842	138842	Cecilia	222	" I can not express how little I wish it . "
138882	138891	138842	138842	Cecilia	222	" I can not think what has happened to Sybilla"—wrinkling
138897	138964	138842	138842	Cecilia	222	furrows—"but she is so dreadfully sprightly when he is there ; she never was sprightly with Dr. Coldstream , and he is such an impossible man!—the sort of man who , when first he comes in , always says , ' Well , how are we this morning ? ' Do not you think that it stamps a man to say ' How are we ? ' "
138965	138971	138842	138842	Cecilia	222	" I think it does . "
138972	138978	138842	138842	Cecilia	222	" He talks such nonsense to her!"—with
138979	139032	138842	138842	Cecilia	222	irritation—"he tells her that he , too , is a bundle of nerves ! if you could only see him ! And one day he told her that when first he came here he had seen the Angel of Death waving his fans above her head ! and she swallows it all ! "
139033	139041	138842	138842	Cecilia	222	" I am not at all surprised . "
139042	139048	139050	139050	she	2621	" It makes me sick ! "
139053	139061	139050	139050	she	2621	" let us go into the garden . "
139236	139243	139245	139246	the girl	3289	" Yes , it is pretty , "
139308	139329	139386	139386	he	181	" Do you know who is in Algiers — whom I saw driving through the Place Bressant on Sunday afternoon ? "
139330	139333	139386	139386	he	181	" Who ? "
139334	139344	139386	139386	he	181	" The Le Marchants . Ah , you are not surprised!"—rather
139347	139352	139386	139386	he	181	" You knew already ! "
139393	139412	139386	139386	he	181	" It would be odd if I did not , seeing that they are staying at my hotel . "
139413	139420	139386	139386	he	181	" You knew that when you went there?"—very
139423	139426	139386	139386	he	181	" Of course not!"—with
139435	139439	139441	139441	Cecilia	222	" I suppose , "
139457	139479	139441	139441	Cecilia	222	" that you have not found out why they stampeded from Florence in that extraordinary way ? Oh no , of course not!"—as
139495	139529	139441	139441	Cecilia	222	" It is not a thing upon which you could question them ; and , after all , it was their own affair ; it was no business of ours , was it ? "
139530	139535	139441	139441	Cecilia	222	" Not the slightest . "
139536	139544	139546	139546	Cecilia	222	" I always used to like them , "
139549	139551	139546	139546	Cecilia	222	" at least"—becoming
139567	139624	139441	139441	Cecilia	222	neighbour—"at least , they never gave me the chance of liking them ; but I always admired them . I wonder are they more accessible than they were in Florence ? There are so few nice English here this year ; everybody says that there never was a year when there were so few nice English ! "
139688	139709	139711	139711	she	222	" I can fancy that this would be a very pleasant place if one had someone to go about with , "
139713	139753	139711	139711	she	222	" but father grows less and less inclined to move . Poor dear ! he is not so young as he was , and I am not quite old enough yet , I suppose , to go about alone . "
139796	139833	139789	139789	she	222	" There are not many advantages in being old ; but , at least , one is freer , and in a youth spent as mine is , there is really not much profit or pleasure . "
139856	139880	139848	139848	Jim	181	" Cheer up , old girl ! there is a good time coming ! It is a long lane that has no turning . "
139960	140023	139956	139956	her	222	" There is a band plays twice a week in the Place de Gouvernement — plays admirably . Now , I suppose that there would be nothing odd ; that no one could say anything ; that it would not be the least improper , considering our connection and everything , if you were to take me to hear it some day ? "
140024	140040	140054	140054	his	181	" I never have the slightest idea of what is improper and what is not , "
140057	140061	140054	140054	his	181	" No more have I"—laughing
140063	140084	139956	139956	her	222	awkwardly—"but in this case I am pretty sure . Tuesdays and Fridays are the days on which the band plays . "
140085	140088	140054	140054	his	181	" Oh ! "
140089	140100	140054	140054	his	181	" To - day is Tuesday , is not it ? "
140101	140104	140054	140054	his	181	" Yes . "
140108	140130	140054	140054	his	181	" I thought that perhaps , if you had nothing better to do , you might take me to - day ? "
140198	140204	140205	140205	he	181	" I am afraid — — "
140209	140217	140219	140219	Cecilia	222	" You are vamping up an excuse ! "
140223	140255	140219	140219	Cecilia	222	" I see it in your eyes . You can not have made any engagements here yet . You do not know anybody , do you , except the Le Marchants ? "
140256	140265	140267	140267	he	181	" And they have gone to Hammam Rhira , "
140293	140298	140300	140300	she	222	" At least — — "
140311	140318	140300	140300	she	222	" To - morrow , then ? "
140335	140346	140300	140300	she	222	" But the band does not play to - morrow . "
140347	140355	140357	140357	she	222	" Oh ! what does that matter ? "
140360	140380	140357	140357	she	222	" I had just as soon go somewhere else — the Arab town , the Kabyle village , anywhere . "
140414	140451	140452	140452	She	222	" Well , times are changed ! I always used to make one in those happy excursions at Florence ; and somehow — thanks to her , I suppose — I never felt a bad third . "
140508	140513	140514	140514	he	181	" Why , Cis ! "
140524	140580	140514	140514	he	181	" are we going to quarrel at this time of day — you and I ? Of course I will take you to the band and the Kabyle village , and any other blessed sight you choose to name , only tell me by which of them you would like to begin to ride round . "
140764	140775	140753	140753	Jim	181	" I think that caged birds ought to be loved ! "
140776	140795	140755	140755	his	181	" The Prophet was a wise man , was not he ? he knew a little about us , "
141184	141193	141194	141194	he	181	" You can not make up your mind ? "
141253	141259	141242	141242	he	181	" Which do you advise ? "
141260	141266	141267	141267	He	181	" I advise the town . "
141292	141312	141313	141313	He	181	" As I am going there myself , will you allow me to walk a little way with you ? "
141416	141433	141410	141410	he	181	" I am going to see the Arab town ; Miss Strutt says that I ought . "
141434	141446	141448	141448	Elizabeth	193	" She meant you to ask her to show it you ! "
141454	141473	141410	141410	he	181	" but she was quite right — it is delightful ; I am sure you will like it . "
141474	141480	141410	141410	he	181	" You have been there ? "
141481	141491	141410	141410	he	181	" Yes , once or twice ; not half so often"—regretfully—"as
141499	141518	141410	141410	he	181	" Dare he speak upon the last innocent hint ? But while he is doubting she goes on : "
141544	141545	141546	141546	You	181	" "
141559	141598	141546	141546	You	181	" He throws out the suggestion in a semi - bantering voice , so that if it meet with obvious disapproval he may at once withdraw it . She stops suddenly stock - still , and faces him . "
141623	141717	141618	141618	you	181	" She lifts her eyes , widely opened , like a child 's at hearing of some unexpected treat , to his . How astonishingly clear they are ! and how curiously guileless ! He has not the least doubt that she will sweetly acquiesce in his decision , whichever way it tends ; and , for a second , a movement of irritation with her for her pliability crosses his mind . She ought to be able to have an opinion of her own . While he hesitates , she speaks again . "
141729	141739	141618	141618	you	181	" she says wistfully , and yet gaily too . "
141754	141789	141812	141812	you	2669	sun!"—lifting her face with sensitive lips , half open , as if to suck in his beams , to the great gold luminary pouring down his warmth through the pepper - trees upon them . "
141800	141804	141805	141805	you	2669	old"—with a pretty flattering smile—"that
141826	141870	141819	141819	you	2669	" He throws conscience to the winds , and although not two hours ago he had professed to Cecilia his inability to decide upon the propriety or impropriety of any given course of female action , now answers with an almost brutal decisiveness : "
141884	141892	141819	141819	you	2669	" A relieved look crosses her features . "
141902	142056	141819	141819	you	2669	" she says , with a joyful surrendering of her judgment into his keeping , and so , once again , steps along with her quick feather - light feet at his side . For the moment she is the happier of the two , since he is not perfectly pleased either with himself or her . It is in vain that he tells himself that it is no babe whom he is beguiling ; that , difficult as it is to believe it , those limpid eyes have looked at the sun for seven - and - twenty years . He still has a lingering sense of discomfort at having availed himself , for his own profit , of her ductility . And yet , five minutes later , he takes yet further advantage of that quality in her . They have reached the Plateau Saulière , and the stand of fiacres that "
142058	142064	141819	141819	you	2669	" there . Jim pauses . "
142087	142088	142165	142165	you	2671	" "
142109	142114	142165	142165	you	2671	" cries she delightedly . "
142136	142158	142165	142165	you	2671	" says he doubtfully , and eyeing her bright slenderness with an air of uncertainty as to her powers of endurance . "
142172	142173	142165	142165	you	2671	" "
142181	142185	142165	142165	you	2671	" replies she ; "
142209	142280	142203	142203	you	2671	" Still he looks at her dubiously . To him there appears to be a much greater degree of the compromising in a tête - à - tête drive than in a walk . In the one case the meeting may have been accidental ; in the other there can be no mistake as to the deliberate intention . But either this does not strike Elizabeth , or she thinks , "
142290	143071	142203	142203	you	2671	" ; or , lastly , and most probably , having given up her judgment into his keeping , she finds it easiest and most natural to acquiesce in whatever he may propose . The ungenerous thought flashes across him that if this is the principle on which she has guided her life , it is small wonder if she have made shipwreck of it . He hails a fiacre , and silently hands her in , and again they are off . Elizabeth has disclaimed fatigue , and yet the restful position is evidently agreeable to her delicate body ; and she thanks him so gratefully for his thought of her that his hard thoughts of her dissolve into remorse , and by - and - by change into an enjoyment almost as entire and uncalculating as her own . Elizabeth has astonishing powers of enjoying herself . If he had not known that fact before , the afternoon would have revealed it to him . She must have driven through the French town almost every day since her arrival , and yet its cheerful white - shuttered houses , its boulevards of glossy - leaved ficus - trees , its cafés , its arcaded streets with their polyglot promenaders , seem to fill her with as lively a pleasure as if she had but just landed from the steamboat that brought her . The three Spahis , eternally sitting in a row on a bench outside some general officer 's quarters , robed in their great red cloaks , with muslin - swathed swart heads and long red - leather boots , dimly descried beneath the stately sweep of their mantles , sitting there motionless , solemn and silent as the Fates ; a venerable Arab , only to be distinguished from Abraham or Isaac by his carrying a vulgar brown umbrella ; a short Kabyle seen in back view , with his rope - bound headdress , his brown - and - white striped frock , and his bare red legs striding along , looking exactly like a ludicrous and indelicate old woman ; a Biskrah water - carrier , poising a great burnished copper pot on his shoulder ; two little baggy trousered white ladies waddling along ; a dozen of smart blue Turcos . She is enraptured with them all . They leave their fiacre in the Place de la Cathédrale , and enter upon the mysterious recesses of the Arab town . Up and down endless flights of steps , up street after street — if streets they can be called , that are not wider than a yard in their widest part — and above their heads the rafter - supported houses lean together , letting scarce a glint of daylight drip down upon the dusky path far below . They pass arched doorways , with pretty designs in plaster — doorways whose doors open inwards upon mysterious interiors — house or court , or mosque or Marabé . All along stand tiny shops , like wild - beast dens , as far as light and space go , lit only by the tempered light — in reality , only semi - darkness — that enters in front . How can they see to work — plait straw , for instance ? as the three ebon - black negroes are doing , upon whom they stare in , asquat upon the ground . The turbans , and the red sashes , and the burnouses glimmer out of the little dim frontages , where charming pierced - brass Moorish lamps hang and swing aloft ; and tempting piles of dully splendid brocades and bright gold - laminated gauzes gleam from the crowded shelves . The narrow streetlets are full of unbusy , un - hurrying Easterns , hideous old negresses grinning like monkeys , idle Arabs sauntering along in their lazy grace , draped like Greek statues , sauntering along between the blue - washed walls that look in their effective variation upon the blinding whitewash as if some of the sky - colour had rubbed off upon them . Jim and Elizabeth have paused , in their leisurely strolling and staring , to look from the straight shadowed alley in which they are standing up a long flight of steps to a low carved doorway , and a bit of starch - blue wall at the top . Down the steep flight a veiled , trousered woman is waddling , her immense pantaloons waggling awkwardly as she descends . Elizabeth stands still , shaking with laughter at the sight . Jim laughs too . "
143109	143123	143097	143097	you	2678	" Her laughter lessens , though her face is still alight with mirth . "
143132	143133	143097	143097	you	2678	" "
143136	143137	143097	143097	you	2678	" "
143150	143158	143140	143140	I	0	" Her laughter is quite dead now . "
143167	143193	143140	143140	I	0	" repeats he , his surprise betraying him into one of those flights back into the past for which she has always showed such repugnance . "
143221	143222	143219	143219	you	2678	" "
143233	143246	143219	143219	you	2678	" cries she , with a sort of writhe in her voice ; "
143265	143490	143219	143219	you	2678	" So saying , she moves on quickly ; and yet with the dance gone out of her feet . It never quite comes back . They look into an Arab club , where men are squatting , playing with odd - looking cards and drinking muddy coffee . Then a loud noise of jabbering young voices makes them peep in upon an Arab school , where a circle of little Moslems is sitting on the ground , scribbling Arabic on slates ; while between the knees of the turbaned master a tiny baby scholar , of three or four , is standing in a lovely dull green coatlet . Elizabeth strokes the baby - learner 's coppery cheek with her light hand , and says , with a laugh , that it seems odd to see little street - boys writing Arabic ; but her laughter is no longer the bubbling , irrepressible joy - drunk thing it was before he had indulged in his tactless reminiscences ; it is the well - bred , civil , grown - up sound that so often has no inside gladness to match it . In his vexation with himself for the clouding over of his little heaven that he himself has effected , he tries to persuade himself that it is caused by bodily fatigue . "
143496	143514	143219	143219	you	2678	" he says , by - and - by , looking down affectionately at her pallid profile , "
143528	143547	143575	143575	her	2682	spirit"—smiling—"is so very much too big for your body that one has to keep an eye upon you . "
143548	143562	143564	143564	she	2682	" It would not be much of a spirit if it were not , "
143580	143609	143564	143564	she	2682	" I know that I look a poor thing , but I am rather a fraud : I do not tire easily ; I am not tired now . "
143610	143615	143575	143575	her	2682	" Bored , then ? "
143639	143644	143625	143625	her	2682	" Most distinctly not . "
143645	143655	143668	143668	her	2682	" You would like to go on , then ? "
143656	143659	143668	143668	her	2682	" Yes . "
143660	143664	143665	143665	She	2682	" Or back ? "
143700	143711	143712	143712	He	2683	" Yes — perhaps ; I have really no choice . "
143726	143740	143712	143712	He	2683	" Do you never have a will — a preference of your own ? "
143829	143838	143839	143839	she	2682	" In this case I really have not , "
143843	143864	143839	143839	she	2682	" but I dare say that it was tiresome of me not to speak more decidedly ; let us — let us"—another
143887	143892	143839	143839	she	2682	inclinations—"let us go home ! "
143969	143974	144035	144035	Elizabeth	193	" watchet - blue , "
144014	144033	144035	144035	Elizabeth	193	" If I had as many gowns as the Mediterranean , how well - dressed I should be ! "
144188	144200	144201	144201	she	193	" You do not mind my not talking , do you ? "
144229	144281	144201	144201	she	193	" No , I am sure you do not . Somehow — it is a great gift — you always feel in tune with one , and one does not chatter most when one is most greatly pleased , does one ? Oh , what a treat you have given me ! "
144447	144452	144479	144479	Burgoyne	181	" Arrêtez ! arrêtez ! "
144458	144473	144479	144479	Burgoyne	181	" Jim ! Jim ! do you not see us ? Arrêtez ! arrêtez ! "
144798	144813	144815	144815	she	221	" A miracle ! a miracle ! I know you are saying to yourself ! "
144822	144835	144815	144815	she	221	" and well you may ! This is the miracle - monger ! "
144849	144876	144815	144815	she	221	" Dr. Crump , let me present to you Mr. Burgoyne — Jim , our Jim , whom I have so often talked to you about . "
144908	144930	144932	144932	she	221	" It is an experiment , of course ; there is no use in pretending that it is not an experiment , "
144941	144942	144943	144943	her	221	" but"—lowering
144946	144954	144943	144943	her	221	little—"they wished me to make the effort . "
145042	145082	145009	145009	she	221	" Oh , Miss Le Marchant ! is it you ? I beg your pardon , I did not recognise you at the first moment . One does not recognise people — does one?—when one is not expecting to see them"—is
145091	145129	145009	145009	she	221	" How are you ? How do you like Algiers ? I hope Mrs. Le Marchant is well . What a long time it is since we met ! I hope we shall see something of you . "
145432	145449	145429	145429	he	2718	" After all , I do not think you need take it so much to heart . "
145450	145456	145457	145457	she	193	" Take what to heart ? "
145487	145491	145457	145457	she	193	" Oh , I see"—a
145509	145551	145552	145552	Vallombrasa	357	carnation—"I see what you mean ; but you are mistaken . I — I — it had not occurred to me ; I was only thinking — only remembering that the last time I saw her was at — at Vallombrosa . "
146796	146801	146802	146802	she	193	" You , too ! "
146805	146846	146802	146802	she	193	" why , the whole hotel seems to be emptied out into these gardens ; the widow Wadman is buying violets — mark if they do not appear upon Uncle Toby at dinner to - night . The Vicomte — — "
146847	146860	146862	146862	Jim	181	" Yes , I saw you engaged in animated dialogue with him , "
146868	146879	146862	146862	Jim	181	" I had no idea that you were such allies . "
146880	146885	146887	146887	she	193	" Had not you ? "
146890	146904	146887	146887	she	193	" He was telling me about his English governess , what a treasure she is"—her
146907	146935	146936	146936	He	181	mischievously—"and how wonderfully pure her accent . So it is — pure Cockney . You should hear the little Vicomte talk of the biby and the pipers . "
146957	146965	146948	146948	she	193	" Have you been on another expedition ? "
146966	146977	146948	146948	she	193	" No , not an expedition ; only a walk . If"—yielding
147002	147031	147033	147033	he	181	else—"if I had invited you to do me the honour of making another excursion with me to - day , do you think that you would have consented ? "
147117	147132	147134	147134	she	193	" Is not that rather a tantalizing question when you did not ask me ? "
147140	147163	147134	147134	she	193	" Yes , I suspect that I should ; I was so very happy yesterday ; and although you told me the other night"—swallowing
147165	147187	147247	147247	He	181	sigh—"that you supposed I must love my own society , in point of fact , I do not think I do . "
147215	147219	147221	147221	Jim	181	" And yet , "
147224	147246	147221	147221	Jim	181	" you seem to have a good deal of it ; I suppose , in your position , it is unavoidable . "
147372	147375	147376	147376	she	193	" Yes , "
147383	147408	147376	147376	she	193	" you are right . In my position it is unavoidable , and it is cowardly of me not to accept it as such . "
147409	147411	147423	147423	she	193	" I mean"—he
147413	147421	147423	147423	she	193	desperately—"I only meant — I mean — — "
147434	147439	147440	147440	she	193	" It is cold , "
147445	147451	147440	147440	she	193	" I will go home . "
147715	147764	147698	147698	Jim	181	" Whenever I see her , I stick a knife into her ! It is impossible ! There is no use trying ! I will give up the attempt . It is out of the question to have any happy relations with a woman who has a past ! "
148060	148072	148077	148077	his	181	" He is gone for a week , is not he ? "
148096	148103	148077	148077	his	181	" Yes , quite a week . "
148104	148106	148114	148114	he	181	" Are you"—he
148123	148129	148130	148130	She	2083	question—"are you glad or sorry ? "
148134	148143	148130	148130	She	2083	" Why should I be glad ? Do you mean"—with
148152	148164	148130	148130	She	2083	voice—"because I shall have mammy all to myself ? You must not think"—with
148171	148189	148130	148130	She	2083	compunction—"that I am not fond of him , because he sometimes speaks a little roughly to me . "
148199	148227	148130	148130	She	2083	" You see , when you have broken a person 's heart , you can scarcely blame him for not having a very high opinion of you . "
148315	148324	148326	148327	Miss Strutt	346	" They make fun of the whole hotel , "
148331	148357	148326	148327	Miss Strutt	346	" I do not believe that one of us escapes ! When he is not there to check them , there is no holding them ! "
149426	149437	149417	149417	he	181	" What spirits she is in , is not she ? "
149438	149445	149447	149448	the mother	579	" Yes ; is not she ? "
149451	149476	149417	149417	he	181	" Oh , I can not say how grateful I am to you for having cheered her up as you have done ! Oh , "
149498	149505	149494	149494	her	193	" if it could only last ! "
149506	149513	149417	149417	he	181	" Why should not it last ? "
149514	149521	149417	149417	he	181	" If nothing fresh would happen ! "
149522	149529	149417	149417	he	181	" Why should anything fresh happen ? "
149535	149548	149530	149530	She	579	" Sometimes I think that Coleridge wrote those lines expressly for me . "
149560	149573	149530	149530	She	579	" She has not mentioned him to you lately , has she ? "
149574	149577	149417	149417	he	181	" No . "
149578	149608	149530	149530	She	579	" That is a good sign . Do not you think that that is a good sign ? I think that she is getting better ; do not you ? "
149669	149675	149676	149676	he	2831	" I do not know , "
149684	149691	149676	149676	he	2831	" it is hard to judge . "
149692	149703	149676	149676	he	2831	" You have not told him that we are here ? "
149724	149728	149676	149676	he	2831	" Oh no ! "
149729	149745	149676	149676	he	2831	" You do not think that he is at all likely to join you here ? "
149746	149752	149676	149676	he	2831	" Not in the least ! "
149796	149803	149780	149782	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" Then I do not see , "
149818	149828	149780	149782	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" why we should not all be very comfortable . "
149840	149843	149851	149853	Mr. Le Marchant	210	" all , "
149913	149983	149908	149908	she	189	" I met M. Cipriani bringing you this . It seems that you ought to have had it two days ago , but , by some mistake , it was put into another gentleman 's room — a gentleman who has never arrived — and there it has remained . He was full of apologies , but I told him what culpable carelessness it showed . I do trust , "
149990	149999	149908	149908	she	189	" that it is not anything that matters . "
150000	150009	150011	150011	Jim	181	" It can not be of much consequence , "
150115	150124	150125	150127	The elder one	659	" I hope you have no bad news ? "
150164	150168	150169	150169	he	181	" Bad news ? "
150174	150207	150169	150169	he	181	voice—"what is bad news ? That depends upon people 's tastes . It is for you to judge of that ; it concerns you as much or more than it does me . "
150270	150294	150258	150258	Elizabeth	193	" Have heard of Le Marchants . If you do not wire to the contrary , shall cross to - morrow.—Byng , Marseille . "
150313	150318	150320	150322	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" He is coming ! "
150329	150341	150320	150322	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" and you told me — not five minutes ago you told me"—with
150345	150396	150320	150322	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	reproach—"that there was not the remotest chance of it . Oh , stop him ! stop him ! Telegraph at once ! The office will be open for two or three hours yet ! There is plenty , plenty of time ! Oh , telegraph at once — at once ! "
150397	150403	150405	150405	Jim	181	" It is too late , "
150414	150452	150405	150405	Jim	181	" you forget that it is two days old . You see , they have spelt my name wrong ; that accounts for the mistake . Bourgouin ! It looks odd spelt Bourgouin , does not it ? "
150467	150474	150476	150478	the young man	643	" He must have sailed yesterday , "
150491	150514	150481	150481	he	643	" he may be here at any moment . If the weather had been decent , he would have arrived ere now . "
150515	150524	150526	150528	Mrs. Le Marchant	189	" Then there is nothing to be done ! "
150598	150627	150659	150659	her	193	" If this had not been delayed — if it had not been too late , would you have wished , would you have decided to stop him ? "
150628	150646	150648	150648	she	193	" What is the use of asking me such a question now that it is too late ? "
150809	150813	150832	150832	she	189	" After all , "
150848	150956	150832	150832	she	189	" after all , there is no reason why you should see him , Elizabeth . There is no reason why she should see him , is there , Mr. Burgoyne ? It could serve no possible end — could it?—and only be exceedingly painful to them both . You will explain to him , will not you ? You will take any message from her ? You will tell him that she really is not up to it , will not you ? It is quite true , I am sure . You are not , are you darling ? She is not , is she ? "
150984	150999	151001	151001	she	579	" Or I would speak to him myself ; if you thought that better , "
151013	151077	151001	151001	she	579	" I would say anything you wished said to him , and I would be careful to say it as kindly as possible . I am sure he would understand ; he would see the sense , the justice of it , would not he ? There is no need for her to expose herself to such useless suffering , is there , Mr. Burgoyne?"—appealing
151093	151112	151001	151001	she	579	address—"when either you or I are more than ready to shield her from it , are not we ? "
151149	151158	151159	151159	he	181	" I think I need not tell you , "
151168	151180	151159	151159	he	181	" that I would help you in any way I could . "
151278	151287	151288	151288	she	193	" You are both very good to me , "
151292	151317	151288	151288	she	193	" As to you , mammy , that is an old story . But I really believe that there is nothing disagreeable that you , too"—with
151332	151375	151401	151401	her	193	hers—"would not do for me . But do not think me obstinate if I say that I think — I am sure — that it would be better — that it would hurt him less — if I spoke to him myself . "
151376	151389	151401	151401	her	193	" It is not a question of what will hurt him least , "
151404	151444	151401	151401	her	193	" The thing to be considered is what will hurt you least . Mr. Burgoyne , am I not right ? Do tell her that I am ! Ought not she to think of what will hurt her least ? "
151522	151537	151511	151511	she	193	" Well , then , I think it will hurt me least , too . "
152048	152058	152063	152063	himself	2875	" I will give him half an hour more , "
152065	152073	152063	152063	himself	2875	" and then I will turn in . "
152234	152248	152257	152258	the other	396	" She is here ? There is no mistake ? She is here ? "
152249	152255	152257	152258	the other	396	" How late you are ! "
152281	152294	152257	152258	the other	396	" Why are you so late ? Did the engines break down ? "
152295	152300	152302	152302	Byng	203	" She is here ? "
152315	152334	152302	152302	Byng	203	" You have not deceived me ? For mercy 's sake say that you have not deceived me ! "
152335	152342	152344	152344	Jim	181	" Why should I deceive you ? "
152347	152355	152344	152344	Jim	181	" Yes ; certainly she is here . "
152419	152428	152518	152518	his	2887	" You must have had a fine tossing ! "
152429	152476	152518	152518	his	2887	" I believe you ; they all thought we were going to make a dinner for the fishes — ha , ha ! All but I. I knew better . I knew that I could not come to grief when she had called me to her . "
152592	152612	152588	152588	he	181	" Come into the dining - room . I told them to put something to eat for you there . "
152674	152777	152640	152640	he	181	" Oh , my dear old chap , how good it is to see your ugly old mug again ! If you had known — oh , if you had only known!—what I went through during the twenty - four hours after I sent you that telegram , when through every hour , through every minute and second of every hour , I said to myself , ' It may come now — my death - warrant may come now ! In five minutes it may have come ! ' But it did not , it did not ! I ought to have known"—with
152781	152840	152640	152640	he	181	ecstasy—"that of her pitifulness she would relent at last . She is infinitely pitiful , is not she ? but I shall upbraid her a little — oh , do not be afraid ; it will be gently , most gently — for having kept me so long , so inhumanly long , upon my gridiron ! I had always"—breaking
152845	152867	152868	152868	He	2891	laugh—"something of a tenderness for St. Lawrence , but during the last seven months I have loved him like a brother ! "
152890	152898	152887	152887	his	2891	" But what does it matter now ? "
152917	152952	152868	152868	He	2891	together—"what does it matter ? ' After long grief and pain , to feel the arms of my true love round me once again ! ' You may think that I word it extravagantly , "
152975	153030	152868	152868	He	2891	" but in the hope itself , the more than hope , there is nothing extravagant ; you must own that yourself . If she had not meant to put an end to my long agony , she would not have sent for me ; not to stop me was to send for me . "
153031	153039	153041	153041	Jim	181	" You are labouring under a mistake , "
153060	153095	153041	153041	Jim	181	" she had not the option of stopping you . By some accident I did not receive your telegram till four hours ago . She could not have stopped you if she had wished . "
153142	153151	153152	153152	he	181	" I — I — do not understand , "
153172	153184	153152	153152	he	181	" I do not follow you . What do you mean ? "
153185	153189	153191	153191	Jim	181	" I mean , "
153214	153252	153191	153191	Jim	181	" that owing , I suppose , to my name being spelt wrongly — Bourgouin instead of Burgoyne — your telegram was given to someone else , and did not reach me till nine o'clock this evening . "
153339	153360	153361	153361	Jim	181	" I am to understand , then , that — that she would have stopped my coming if she could . "
153378	153395	153365	153365	He	181	" She would have escaped me again if she had had the chance ! What am I saying?"—with
153403	153451	153402	153402	his	181	tone—"she may have escaped me already ! She may be gone ! Tell me the truth — do not dare to tell me anything but the bare truth . I saw that you hesitated when I asked you whether she was really here . Is she gone ? "
153452	153455	153457	153457	Jim	181	" Gone ! "
153493	153556	153606	153606	he	181	" To - night — in this storm ? How likely ! Come , be rational ; try to keep your head , and let us have a truce to this ranting . I give you my word of honour that she is here , under this roof ; asleep , I should hope , if your bellowings have not awoke her . "
153602	153605	153606	153606	he	181	" Asleep ! "
153621	153628	153606	153606	he	181	" Good angels guard her slumbers ! But"—with
153634	153690	153606	153606	he	181	excitement—"are you sure that she is asleep — that she has gone to bed yet ? They used to sit up very late in Florence sometimes . If she has not gone to bed , why should not I see her ; why should not I fall at her feet now — to - night ? "
153691	153696	153698	153698	Jim	181	" My dear boy , "
153717	153778	153698	153698	Jim	181	" have you any idea what time it is ? I should have thought it might have occurred even to you that 1.30 A.M. is scarcely a suitable hour for paying a morning call ! Do not be a fool ! Pull yourself together . I swear to you that she has every intention of seeing you to - morrow . Come"—trying
153780	153814	153698	153698	Jim	181	laugh—"you will not have long to wait ! It is to - morrow already ; and , meantime , sit down and eat something ; you must be as empty as a drum . "
153964	153972	153992	153992	he	181	" Is there insanity in Byng 's blood "
154001	154042	153992	153992	he	181	" What security have I if I go to bed that she will not steal away from me in the night ? It was in the night — almost in the night — that she stole away from me before . "
154316	154424	154298	154298	Byng	203	" Why do you go on questioning me as to where I have been , and what I have done ? I tell you I have been nowhere , and done nothing ; I believe that my body has been here and there , but my soul has been nowhere ; it has been lying dead ! Would you expect a man who has been lying six months in his coffin to give you a catalogue of his adventures ? My soul has been dead , I tell you — dead and putrescent . What is the use of putting me through a catechism about its doings ? "
154785	154797	154806	154806	her	193	" He has come ; you know that , I suppose ? "
154798	154801	154806	154806	her	193	" Yes . "
154870	154883	154844	154844	her	193	" I do not believe that you went to bed at all . "
154884	154895	154903	154903	herself	193	" Yes , I did ! yes , I did ! "
154912	154949	154957	154957	her	193	" and — he — how is he ? How does he look ? Had not he a dreadful crossing ? Does he want to see me ? to see me soon ? to - day ? "
154995	155011	155013	155013	he	181	" Of course he wants to see you — wants it very , very much , "
155033	155036	155018	155018	his	181	" As much as"—with
155040	155063	155018	155018	his	181	smile—"you want to see him . No , do not be angry . Why should not you wish to see each other ? "
155064	155072	155074	155074	she	193	" Oh , there is every reason ! "
155075	155083	155018	155018	his	181	miserably—"the same reason that there always was . But"—with
155085	155100	155018	155018	his	181	agitation—"where is it to be ? How soon ? When does he wish it ? "
155101	155108	155109	155109	She	193	" He is waiting outside now . "
155113	155129	155018	155018	his	181	" Now ! Oh , poor fellow ! we must not keep him waiting ; and yet"—stretching
155134	155160	155161	155161	Jim	181	detention—"tell me , before he comes in — tell me , is he changed ? Is he ? Is he the same as he was ? "
155177	155245	155175	155175	her	193	" You are vexed with me for teasing you with so many tiresome questions . Oh , forgive me ! I ought not to take advantage of your kindness ; but we have grown to depend upon you so ; and I will promise not to worry you with any other , if you will only answer me this one . Is he changed — much changed ? "
155246	155251	155253	155253	Jim	181	" I am afraid , "
155273	155287	155253	155253	Jim	181	" that you must be prepared to find him a good deal altered . "
155288	155293	155175	155175	her	193	" Altered ! How ? "
155294	155303	155253	155253	Jim	181	" I do not quite know how to describe it"—uneasily—"but
155333	155342	155324	155324	he	2922	" She makes a clutch at his hand . "
155345	155354	155324	155324	he	2922	mean"—her voice has sunk to a horror - struck whisper—"that
155360	155361	155355	155355	he	2922	" "
155370	155376	155377	155377	you	193	" with a strained laugh ; "
155435	155468	155469	155469	You	193	" She is still terrifiedly clutching his hand , though with no consciousness of doing so , nor that the fingers so tightly gripped by her are not made of dry stick . "
155476	155481	155469	155469	You	193	" he says soothingly . "
155547	155567	155524	155524	you	193	" Still she does not speak , and there is scarcely any diminution of the horror of her look . "
155596	155597	155599	155599	you	0	" "
155602	155612	155599	155599	you	0	" she asks , with a sort of scorn , "
155624	155625	155629	155629	I	0	" "
155680	155681	155674	155674	you	0	" "
155686	155694	155674	155674	you	0	" she answers , docile even now . "
155714	155751	155703	155703	you	0	" The misgivings with which Jim complies with this request are not much allayed by the manner and voice of him who receives it , and who has been raging up and down the narrow corridor . "
155761	155762	155703	155703	you	0	" "
155776	155788	155767	155767	she	2926	" catching him by the arm as he springs past him . "
155818	155848	155811	155811	she	2926	" Byng 's answer is to fling resentfully away the detaining hand of his Mentor , while he says , with a furious look coming into his bloodshot eyes : "
155869	156068	155851	155851	you	2926	" The rudeness of both words and actions is so unlike the real Byng , that it is with an even more sinking spirit than before that Jim follows him with his eyes as he passes out of sight into the salon . As soon as the door is shut behind him , he himself takes up the position he had suggested in the ante - room . There are few things more trying to an active - minded person than to sit occupationless , vaguely waiting . At first , it is true , the keenness of Jim 's alarm prevents his feeling the ennui which would be the natural result of his situation . Poignantly anxious questions succeed each other in his mind . Has he had any right to permit the interview at all ? How far is Byng accountable for his actions ? What chance is there that his already rocking reason will stand the shock of a meeting which , even in his sanest moments , would have so wildly excited him ? And if not , what may be the consequences ? Grisly headings of newspaper paragraphs write themselves in the air before him—"Homicidal
156071	156072	155851	155851	you	2926	" "
156077	156818	155851	155851	you	2926	" The details of a tragic story which , illustrated by sensational woodcuts , he had idly read a day or two ago in a venerable Police News , left lying on the smoking - room table , recur to his memory . It was a tale of a groom who , in an access of jealous madness , had shot a scullion sweetheart through the head , and then blown his own brains out . The tale had made but little impression on him at the time — unhappily , it is scarcely possible to take up a journal without the eye alighting upon some such — but it comes back to him now with terrifying vividness . What security is there that such tragedies may be confined to grooms and kitchen - maids ? How does he know that Byng has not a revolver hidden in his breast - pocket ? How can he tell that he is not at this very moment drawing it out ? He ( Jim ) ought to have made sure , before exposing her to such a peril , that the danger was minimized by Byng 's being weaponless . Is it too late to make sure of that even now ? He takes one step towards the salon door , then hastily retraces it . Pooh ! he is growing as mad as Byng . They will come out and find him eavesdropping . He retreats to the table , which is at the greatest distance allowed by the room 's narrow enceinte from the scene of the drama whose dénouement he is expecting , and , sitting down , takes up a book . It happens to be Elizabeth 's Italian exercise - book , and the sight of it conjures up before his memory her forlorn figure stooping disconsolately over the page , wrapped in her brown furs , as he had seen it on that rainy night that seems now so distant . He had pitied her for being lonely then . Well , whatever else she may be , she is not lonely now . He catches his breath . It is quite a quarter of an hour since he began his watch . How quiet they are ! There is a murmur of voices , but there is nothing that in the least indicates violence . Before his eyes there flashes in grotesque recollection the hideous picture in the Police News which illustrates the high words with which the catastrophe of the groom and kitchenmaid had been heralded . He has been making a mountain out of a mole - hill ; has been exaggerating his friend 's emotional temperament , naturally further heightened by sleeplessness and want of food , into incipient insanity . If he were mad , or at all tending that way , would he be talking in the low rational key which he obviously must be ? It is evident that her presence , her eye , her — yes , what more likely?—her touch have soothed and conjured away what of excessive or perilous there was in his emotion . They have been together half an hour now . All danger is certainly over . Why should he any longer continue his officious and needless watch?—superfluously spying upon them ? Relieved as to what he had thought his worst fear , and yet with an uncommon bitterness about his heart , he turns to withdraw , and his hand is already on the lock of the door which leads into the corridor , when suddenly , without any warning , there reaches his ear the noise of a loud , crashing fall , followed — accompanied , rather — by a piercing scream . In infinitely less than a second he finds himself on his knees beside the prostrate body of Byng , who , with blood pouring from his forehead , is stretched upon the floor of the salon . Even at this second there flashes upon him , ludicrous and dreadful , the memory of the Police News . This scene has a grotesque likeness to the final one of the groom and kitchenmaid series , only that in the present case the heroine , instead of staggering backward with the top of her head flying up to the ceiling , is hanging unharmed over her fallen lover . "
156823	156849	155851	155851	you	2926	" cries Jim in frantic anxiety , looking at her across the prostrate figure , and unable to eradicate from his mind the revolver idea . "
156862	156863	156851	156851	he	2930	" "
156872	156903	156870	156870	he	2930	" fetching her breath in terrible gasps , and hanging over the bleeding man with that utter abandonment of all disguise , in which a great naked grief sweeps away our sophistications—"he
156907	156908	156912	156912	he	2930	" "
156916	156934	156935	156935	He	2930	" answers Jim hastily , tearing open Byng 's waistcoat and laying his hand upon his heart . "
156956	156972	156955	156955	his	2930	head"—seeing that she is agonizedly trying to raise his prone head and rest it upon her knees—"he
156987	157107	157121	157121	he	2930	" She does not need to be twice told . In an instant she has sprung to the table , and brought thence the china jug out of which she is wo nt to water her flowers , and also the big cut - glass bottle of smelling - salts with which Jim has often seen poor Mrs. Le Marchant solacing herself when racked with that neuralgic headache which means worry . He splashes water out of the one upon Byng 's ashy face , and holds the other to his pale nostrils ; while Elizabeth , once more flinging herself upon her knees , wipes the blood from his temples with her little useless gossamer inch of handkerchief . "
157113	157118	157121	157121	he	2930	" asks Jim rapidly . "
157126	157194	157121	157121	he	2930	" The heads of the two ministrants are very close to each other as they bend together over the swooned youth . Jim can see a little smear of Byng 's blood upon one of her white cheeks . The sight gives him a shudder . Byng seems to have made her more his own by that gory baptism than by all his frenzied vows and tears . "
157202	157215	157216	157216	He	2930	" she answers , still fetching both breath and words with difficulty . "
157256	157264	157272	157272	I	0	table"—with a convulsive shiver at the recollection . "
157309	157310	157302	157302	I	0	" "
157320	157337	157316	157316	he	2930	" replies Jim brusquely , thinking a certain harshness of manner the best recipe for her . "
157481	157980	157462	157463	M. Cipriani	2932	Crump"—catching in his destitution at the thought of even Sybilla 's objectionable friend . But hereupon half a dozen voices — for by this time even more than that number of inmates of the hotel have thronged into the little room — raise themselves to pronounce another name — the name of one who both stands higher in medical fame and is more quickly procurable . In search of him Zameth , the porter , is instantly despatched , and meanwhile about the inanimate body sympathizers stand three deep , until reluctantly dispersed by a hint of a nature so broad as not to be misunderstood from Jim , to the effect that the patient would have a better chance of coming to himself if he were allowed to have a breath of air . By the time the doctor arrives — there is some small delay before he appears — all are got rid of , and , Mrs. Le Marchant having gone to give directions for having Jim 's room arranged for the sick man , both because it is on the ground - floor and also of a better size than that allotted to him , Jim and Elizabeth are once again left tête - à - tête . Once again they kneel on either side of the prone figure . How dreadfully dead and how extravagantly long it looks ! Once again he sees that blood - smear on her face . It is just above her one dimple , and stands out in ghastly incongruity over that little pitfall for love and laughter . How passionately he wishes that he might ask her to go and wash it off ! If he did she would not hear him . She has no ears left , no eyes , no sense , save for that livid face , splashed with the water which has not brought him back to life , and with the red drops still slowly trickling from the wound on his brow , and which have stained here and there the damp tendrils of his hair — for that livid face and for the flaccid hands , which she rubs between her own with an ever more terrified energy , as he still gives no sign of returning consciousness . By - and - by he is taken out of her custody . She is robbed even of the wretched satisfaction of chafing his poor senseless fingers . On the arrival of the doctor he is carried off , and laid upon the bed that has been made ready for him . She follows them miserably as they bear him staggeringly across the hall — a powerfully - built young man of over six feet high , in the perfect inertness of syncope , is no light weight — and looks hungrily over the threshold of the bedroom ; but when she attempts to cross it Jim puts her gently back . "
157987	158007	158008	158008	dear	3358	" he says . ( He is almost sure afterwards that for that once in his life he calls her "
158010	158012	158008	158008	dear	3358	" ) "
158059	158060	158057	158057	you	3358	" "
158069	158520	158525	158525	me	0	" she answers slowly . And so turns in her utter tractableness , and goes away meekly without a word . It is evening again now , almost the same hour at which Jim and Elizabeth were beheading photographs twenty - four hours ago . Twenty - four hours ! It feels more like twenty - four years . This is what he says to himself as he once again opens the door of the Le Marchants ' apartment . It is the first time during the whole day , except to snatch a couple of mouthfuls of food , that he has left Byng 's side ; and it is only due to the fact that Mrs. Le Marchant is supplying his place , and has sent him on a message to her daughter , that he has quitted his post . He knows that she has meant to do him a kindness in despatching him upon this errand ; but he is not sure that it is one . Elizabeth is not in the salon , but the screen that masks the door separating that room from the little alcove beyond is folded back . Over the doorway is a hanging of Eastern embroidery — as to the meaning of the strange gold scrolls that look like Arab letters on whose red ground Elizabeth and he have often idly speculated . He pushes it aside , and sees her standing with her back towards him , the flimsy muslin window - curtains drawn back as she looks out on the night . The alcove is on ordinary occasions scarcely ever occupied , and there is something uneasy and uncomfortable that matches the wretchedness of her other circumstances in finding her standing there alone and idle . The elements have long finished their raging , and fallen to boisterous play . It has been a fine day , and though the sun has long laid down his sceptre , he has passed it on with scarcely diminished , though altered , radiance to his white imitator . It is broad moonlight — startlingly broad . The moon hangs overhead , with never a cloud - kerchief about her great disk . The winds that , loudly sporting , are up and abroad have chased every vapour from the sky , which is full of throbbing white stars . Before he reaches her side she has heard him , and turned to meet him , with a mixed hunger and pitiful hope in her wan face . She thinks that he has come to fetch her . He must kill that poor hope , and the quicklier the more mercifully . "
158543	158549	158541	158541	you	189	wrong"-with an attempt at a reassuring smile—"he
158624	158625	158614	158615	the doctor	1869	" "
158639	158681	158635	158635	you	189	" What a quivering voice the hope has , and yet how alive it is ! However clumsily , and with whatever bitter yearnings over the pain he is causing her , he must knock it on the head at once . "
158711	158712	158705	158705	he	2939	" "
158720	158729	158730	158730	he	2939	" interrupts she , with a pathetic pertinacity , "
158781	158792	158802	158802	anyone	3161	indeed!"—with a change of tone to one of agonized self - reproach;—"have
158815	158929	158930	158930	I	0	" She turns back to the window again , and dashes her forehead with violence against the frame . Outside the tall date - palm is shaken through all its plumes by the loud breeze ; it is swaying and waving and blowing , and not less is its solid shadow cut out by the moonshine 's keen knife on the terrace , wavering and shaking too , as if convulsed by laughter . The porch of the hotel — mere whitewash and plaster , as memory and reason tell one that it is — stands out in glorified ivory like the portals of such a palace as we see in vision , when "
158939	159011	158934	158934	you	189	" says Jim , in an exceedingly kind and not very steady voice , for his own feelings are horribly harrowed ; and on thinking over the scene afterwards , he can not swear that , at this point , he did not pass a most brotherly arm for one moment round the poor little heaving shoulder , which is shaking almost as much as the palm - tree 's shadow . "
159036	159140	159026	159026	Nobody	3337	" She makes him no answer , nor lifts her stricken head , over which he looks out , while the ghostly mirth shakes the landscape ; at his wits ' end , in search of consolation . Below waves a sea of foliage , out of which the strong elfin light has stolen all the colour . From that colourless dark ocean rises far away to the right the dazzling little snowy dome of a mosque , showing like a transfigured mushroom ; and down below the rounding bay is seen laying its foam - lips in white glory on the land . "
159259	159269	159258	159258	you	2944	remember?"—trying to recall every circumstance that may tend to reassure her—"I
159285	159299	159280	159280	you	2944	" His words have a very different effect from that intended by him . "
159311	159326	159327	159327	You	2944	" says she , with what sounds almost like a cry of physical pain . "
159352	159480	159347	159347	him	2939	" She breaks off . To tell him what ? Jim bites his lips hard to hinder himself from putting this question , as he again , in mercy to her , looks away from her out into the night . The moon has swum over the housetop by now ; but one can see her handiwork as plainly as ever in the broad argent fringe , like the border of a cloak , that marks where the waves are breaking on the beach . One often talks of a fringe without really meaning that there is much likeness to one ; but to - night the moon - washed breakers really do wear that aspect — a fringe of silver with long silver tags and ends . "
159487	159499	159482	159482	I	0	" she continues , with that wail still in her voice ; "
159584	159588	159583	159583	I	0	did"—growing very breathless and incoherent—"and
159668	159710	159663	159663	I	0	" What can Jim say to her ? Fear lest any dastardly unchivalrous curiosity may seem to pierce through whatever sympathetic question he might put to her keeps him dumb , and stupidly staring at the bowing , ironically merry palm . "
159714	159737	159738	159738	he	2939	" she goes on , lifting her face , and he is shocked to see how livid it is in the moonlight , "
159797	159813	159814	159814	I	0	" The sob with which she ends alarms him by its kinship to a convulsion . "
159824	159867	159814	159814	I	0	" he says , desperately making a snatch at her two hands , as if by the violence of his grip he could convey to her some little portion of the deep compassion that is swelling up in his heart for her ; "
159882	159900	159901	159901	I	0	" with a return of that terror lest this ejaculation should seem the outcome of any inquisitiveness ; "
160008	160018	160025	160025	I	0	die"—with a hurried trip back to his former strain of consolation—"he
160035	160040	160025	160025	I	0	honour"—becoming perfectly reckless and completely insensate—"that
160045	160058	160025	160025	I	0	" But she is too strangled with sobs to make any rejoinder . "
160067	160072	160073	160073	I	0	" goes on Jim . "
160118	160163	160113	160114	General Smith	368	" He stops abruptly , with a too tardy recollection that the allusion is not a happy once , since the General died two days ago . Unfortunately , she also remembers , as is evidenced by the strong shudder that passes over her . "
160235	160237	160220	160220	he	2939	" Though "
160242	161115	160220	160220	he	2939	" was never and nowhere truer to her name than this year , and in Algiers — coming laden with wet days to make the green Sahel , if possible , greener than it was before ; yet the inhabitants of the Grand Hotel do not again , for a matter of three weeks , relieve their ennui or let off their energies in far from Dumb Crambo , or loud charade . The voice of the battledore is silent in the entrance - hall , and the shuttlecock sleeps . M. Cipriani has scarcely had to do more than mention his request that they would lay aside their more noisy pastimes , for they are , most of them , rather good - natured persons than otherwise , since , indeed , it is quite as uncommon to be very ill - natured as to be very selfless , or very foolish , or very wise . Those of them who have been fortunate enough to be present at the catastrophe have carried away such a moving image of a wounded Adonis , apparently several yards long , stretched upon Mrs. Le Marchant 's Persian carpet , that they have infected those less happy persons who know of him only by hearsay with a compassionate interest scarcely inferior to their own . The only person in the hotel who makes much noise is poor Byng himself , and for awhile he falls it with clamour enough to furnish two or three of those bump suppers of which , not so long ago , he was a conspicuous ornament . There had never , even when he was in his wits , been much disguise as to the state of his feelings ; now that he is out of them , the whole house rings with his frantic callings upon the name of Elizabeth , uttered in every key of rage , expostulation , tenderness , and appeal . These cries reach Elizabeth herself as she sits cowering in that one of the little suite of rooms which is nearest the door of entrance — sits there cowering , and yet with the door , through which those dreadful sounds penetrate to her , ajar , in order the better to hear them — cowering , and for several days alone . Owing to various accidents , similar in their results , though differing in character , almost a week elapses from the first breaking out of Byng 's malady before the arrival of either the hospital nurse or of Mrs. Byng . When the latter event occurs , Mrs. Le Marchant retires from her post at the sick man 's bedside with the same unostentatious matter - of - factness with which she had assumed it , and Elizabeth is no longer alone . But to set against this advantage is the counterbalancing evil that , after the arrival of Byng 's mother , she can no longer steal out , as she had before done a hundred times a day , to his door , to glean fragments of tidings from any outcomer thence . She is never able to repeat those little surreptitious excursions after that occasion when Mrs. Byng , coming suddenly out upon her , passes her with such speaking , if silent , hostility and scorn in her tired and grief - stricken eyes , that the luckless spy slinks back sobbing to her own tender mother ; and there Jim , flying out a while after to carry them a crumb of reassurance , finds them , to his indignation , mingling their bitter tears . Whatever else his faults may be , Mr. Burgoyne is a man of his word ; he certainly keeps his promise to Elizabeth that Byng shall be well nursed . He keeps his other promise , too — though that is more by good luck than good management — that Byng shall not die . Whether to hinder his friend from being made a liar , or because he himself is loth to leave a world which he has found so pretty , cruel , and amusing , Byng does not die — Byng lives . By her 25th day February has dried her tears , though they still hang on her green lashes , and a great galleon of a sun steers through a tremendous sea of blue , as Jim persuades Byng 's mother to go out for her first delicious drive in that fresh and satin - soft air of the Algerian February , which matches our best poets ' May. He takes her along the Route des Aqueduques , that lovely route which runs high along the hillside among the villas above the town , so high as to be on a level with the roofs of the lofty - standing Continental and Orient Hotels . It is a most twisting road , which in curves and loops winds about the head of narrow deep gorges , full of pale olive - trees , caroubiers , and ilex . Below lies the red - roofed white town . Slowly they trot past the campagne of the "
161119	161120	160220	160220	he	2939	" "
161124	161196	161197	161197	I	0	" and many others , over whose high walls bougainvillias light their now waning purple fires , and big bushes of fleurs de Marie stoop their milky stars . Mrs. Byng 's eyes , sunk and diminished by watching and weariness , have been lying restfully on the delightful spring spectacle — on the great yellow sorrels by the wayside ; she now turns them tear - brimmed to her companion . "
161205	161210	161197	161197	I	0	" she says shakily . "
161233	161269	161227	161227	we	2957	" Jim 's only answer is a sympathetic pressure of the extremely well - fitting glove nearest him . If Willy had died instead of lived , her gloves would have fitted all the same . "
161280	161291	161271	161271	we	2957	" continues she , with a shake of the head . "
161310	161311	161227	161227	we	2957	" "
161315	161435	161436	161436	I	0	" inquires he , obstinately stupid , and with somewhat of a heart - sinking at the prospect of the engagement which he sees ahead of him . How many elbows the road makes ! It seems to have been cut in places right through the wet red rock , now overhung by such a torrent of vegetation . At the head of one of the deep clefts that run up from the sea they pause , and look down upon a second sea of greenery that would seem to belong to no month less leafy than June . To June , too , belong the murmur and hum and summer trickle of running water at the ravine bottom . "
161454	161461	161513	161513	she	0	" says Mrs. Byng in a restless voice—"why
161482	161483	161513	161513	she	0	" "

161539	161542	161526	161526	she	0	no"—rather grudgingly . "
161597	161598	161587	161587	they	2962	" "
161607	161623	161599	161599	You	2961	" says Jim , in a voice which , though quiet , is not pacific , "
161654	161660	161661	161661	mothers	2965	indeed"—correcting himself with a somewhat malicious intention—"for
161670	161671	161675	161675	she	189	" "
161683	161689	161675	161675	she	189	" in a jealous tone . "
161690	161691	161675	161675	she	189	Well"—more generously—"how
161715	161722	161713	161713	I	0	thought"—compunctiously—"that she looked a nice woman . "
161723	161729	161713	161713	I	0	" She is nice — as nice"—descending
161737	161742	161713	161713	I	0	years—"as they make 'em . "
161743	161762	161763	161763	They	2966	" And the girl — I suppose one can hardly call her a girl — looks nice too . "
161821	161848	161816	161816	he	181	" I suppose that she must have been quite , quite young when — when those dreadful things happened that Willy talked about in his delirium ? "
161849	161852	161853	161853	you	181	" Is it possible"—indignantly—"that
161868	161869	161816	161816	he	181	" "
161876	161882	161816	161816	he	181	but"—with an obstinate sticking to her point—"there
161897	161918	161816	161816	he	181	" Jim shuts his teeth tight together . His vow of silence is harder to keep than he had thought . "
161932	161938	161940	161940	he	181	" continues his companion anxiously ; "
161944	161945	161940	161940	he	181	" "
161948	161949	161940	161940	he	181	" "
162023	162072	162018	162018	He	181	" They have left the Prison Civile and the Zouave Barracks behind them . A longer interval than that usually supposed to elapse between a remark and its rejoinder has passed , before Jim can bring himself to utter the following sentence with the calmness which he wishes : "
162086	162181	162080	162080	she	603	" Perhaps Mrs. Byng does not readily find a response to this question ; perhaps it sets her off upon a train of speculation which does not conduce to garrulity . Certain it is that , for the rest of the drive , she is as silent as Jim could wish her . It is a sharp surprise to him two days later to be mysteriously called outside the sick man 's door by her , in order to be informed that she has invited Miss Le Marchant to accompany her on a drive . "
162189	162207	162182	162182	I	0	" she says , avoiding — or so he fancies it — his eye as she speaks ; "
162228	162229	162211	162212	the girl	3289	" "
162235	162249	162233	162233	you	0	" cries Jim , a flash of real pleasure in his serious look ; "
162262	162284	162233	162233	you	0	" And he takes her hand to thank it by a friendly pressure . But she draws it away rather hastily . "
162300	163020	162233	162233	you	0	" She seems confused and a little guilty , and escapes with some precipitation from his gratitude . Mrs. Byng is not a woman addicted to double - dealing , and if she ever makes any little essays in that direction , she does them , as on this present occasion , villainously . Burgoyne is not at the hall - door to help the ladies into the carriage when they set off . Perhaps this may be because he is in attendance upon the invalid . Perhaps because — glad as he had at first felt and expressed himself at their friendliness — some misgiving may , upon reflection , have beset him at so strange a conjunction . At all events , it is only Fritz who throws the light Arab rug over their knees and gives them his encouraging parting smile . Poor Miss Le Marchant needs his encouragement , for , indeed , it is in a very frightened spirit that she sets forth on her pleasuring . But before the horse - bells have jingled to the bottom of Mustapha Supérieur , her spirits are rising . The sun shines , and he has shone so seldom in Elizabeth 's life that a very few of his beams , whether real or metaphorical , suffice to send up her quicksilver . She does not consciously admit for a second the hope that in the present overture on the part of her companion lies any significance . But yet a tiny trembling bliss now and then taps at her heart 's door , and she pushes it away but feebly . Before they have reached the Amirauté , where they are to get out , she has thanked Mrs. Byng with such pretty and unsuspecting gratitude for bringing her , and has made her laugh so irrepressibly by her gay and naïve comments upon the motley passers - by , that the latter is filled with a compunctious regret that a person with such lovely manners , and such a sense of a joke , should have made so disastrous a fiasco of her life as renders necessary the extremely distasteful errand on which she herself is at present bound . At the Amirauté , as I say , they get out ; and , turning under a groined roof that looks as if it were the crypt of a church , find themselves presently upon the long stone breakwater that runs out into the bay . It was built , they tell us , in old days by the wretched Christian captives ; but the sea has taken care that not much of the original labour of blood and tears has survived . The wind is high , and the sunshine ardent and splendid . On their right as they walk , with the wind officiously helping them from behind , is a world of dancing sapphire , each blue billow white - tipped . On their left are great blocks of masonry , built strong and square , with narrow intervals between to break the might of the water . How little their strength has availed against that of their tremendous opponent is seen at every step , since nearly half the blocks are overthrown or in semi - ruin ; though the date engraved upon them shows for how few seasons they have been exposed to the ravages of the tempestuous sea . They walk on to the end , till they can go no further , since , just ahead of them , the waves are rolling in half - fierce play — though the day is all smiles — over the breakwater ; and even where they stand , their footing is made unsure by lengths of slimy seaweed that set them slipping along . Elizabeth insists upon the elder woman taking her slight arm — insists upon carrying her wraps , and generally waiting upon and ministering to her . From the bottom of her heart Mrs. Byng wishes that she would not , since every instance of her soft helpfulness , so innocent and spontaneous , makes more difficult the answer to that question which she has been asking herself ever since they set foot upon the Mole : "
163026	163249	163023	163023	I	0	" It is unanswered still , when , retracing their steps a little , they sit down under the lee of one of the half - wrecked blocks to enjoy the view . From here the sea is a lake , the distant mountains and the breakwater seeming — though in reality parted by how wide a wet waste — to join in embracing it . The mountains are dim and filmy to - day , Cape Matifou scarcely visible ; but the Koubah shows white - domed on the hillside , and all the dazzling water is shot through with blinding light . The town , Arab - French , is dazzling too ; the arcaded quay , the fortifications , one can scarcely look at any of them . Two or three steamers , with a little vapour issuing from their ugly black and red funnels , lie moored ; and other smaller craft lift their spars against the heaven . Near by a man is sitting with his legs dangling over the water , fishing with a line ; and two or three Arabs , draped in the dignity of their poetic rags , lie couched round a fire that they have kindled . Beneath and around them is the banging and thundering of the sea . August noise ! "
163259	163337	163023	163023	I	0	" Could there be a more awful comparison ? Just underneath them , where the sea has made a greater breach than usual , it is boiling as in a caldron . Looking down and in , they see the water comparatively quiet for a moment ; then , with a shout of its great jubilant voice , rushing and surging in , tossing its mane . Elizabeth 's eyes are resting on the heavenly sapphire plain . "
163341	163349	163023	163023	I	0	" she says , under her breath ; "
163384	163385	163386	163386	I	0	" "
163401	163426	163428	163428	I	0	" replies Mrs. Byng , lugging in somewhat awkwardly , as she feels , the subject which she finds it so hard to introduce , "
163438	163466	163467	163468	Mr. Burgoyne	198	" Her charity bids her not glance at her companion as she speaks , so she is not quite sure whether or not she gives a start . "
163494	163520	163476	163476	I	0	" She tries to throw as much significance as they are capable of holding into the latter words , and feels that she has succeeded . "
163529	163539	163476	163476	I	0	" continues she , with a rather strained laugh . "
163603	163604	163640	163640	I	0	" "
163607	163611	163640	163640	I	0	" almost inaudibly . "
163612	163623	163640	163640	I	0	But"—reddening slightly at the patently - intended application of her next sentence—"anyone
163677	163678	163679	163679	I	0	" "
163689	163712	163683	163684	no one	819	" There is not a touch of asperity in the dove - soft voice ; but there is a shade of dignity . "
163722	163724	163683	163684	no one	819	" ( "
163731	163736	163683	163684	no one	819	" in an anguished internal aside)—"I
163747	163842	163683	163684	no one	819	" The ardour of the chase has vanquished her charity , and she is looking at her victim . But , to do her justice , the success of her labours shocks her . Can this little aged , pinched face , with its dilated eyes , so full of woe and terror , be the same one that dimpled into riotous laughter half an hour ago at the sight of the two dirty old men , in Jewish gaberdines and with gingham umbrellas , kissing each other by the Mosquée de la Pêcherie ? "
163850	163878	163683	163684	no one	819	" she goes on hurriedly , snatching at the first expression that occurs to her as likely to undo , or at least a little modify , her work—"nothing
163905	163919	163903	163903	I	0	sure"—with a remorseful if clumsy attempt to be kind , and a most uneasy smile—"that
163927	163994	163995	163995	I	0	" In the narrow interspace between the blocks and the path — not more than a couple of fingers wide — how the sea forces itself ! and up race its foam - fountains , throwing their spray aloft in such mighty play , as if they would hit heaven 's arch . What exhilaration in its great glad noise , superb and battle - ready ! "
164006	164022	164030	164030	his	2988	me"—in a tone that certainly gives no reason to doubt the truth of her statement ; "
164062	164063	164047	164047	you	2987	" "
164078	164150	164071	164071	I	0	" How curiously still and slow her voice is ! Mrs. Byng has resolutely averted her eyes , so that her purpose may not again be shaken by the sight of the havoc she has wrought , and has fixed them upon some sea gulls that are riding up and down upon the merry waves , making them , with their buoyant motion , even more jocund than they were before . "
164174	164184	164171	164171	I	0	it"—in a tone of excessive distress , yet firmness . "
164201	164202	164205	164205	I	0	" "
164224	164225	164220	164220	we	2992	" "

164279	164351	164272	164272	I	0	" The sea - gulls have risen from the billow , and are turning and wheeling in the air . The light is catching their wings , and making them look like whitest silver . It seems as if they were at conscious play with it , trying experiments as to how they can best catch their bright playfellow , and again shake it off , and yet again recapture it . "
164360	164406	164355	164355	you	2987	" breaks out the elder woman presently . Now that the impression has somehow been conveyed to her mind that her mission is likely to be completely successful , the full brutality of the method by which she has accomplished it bursts upon her mind . "
164429	164456	164464	164465	a monster	2993	" Elizabeth 's narrow hands are clasped upon her knee , and her small heart - broken , white face is looking out straight before her . "
164467	164469	164464	164465	a monster	2993	" she answers—"you
164492	164496	164507	164508	his mother	3511	sorry"—with a sort of smile—"for
164531	164532	164533	164533	I	0	" "
164600	164661	164662	164662	I	0	" How deplorably lame even to Mrs. Byng 's ears sound her tardy efforts to place the grounds of her objection on a less cruel basis than that which she has already made so nakedly plain to be the real one ! Even the sweet - mannered Elizabeth does not think it necessary to express gratitude for such insulting civilities . "
164674	164682	164721	164721	he	2996	" she says , with quiet politeness ; "
164691	164692	164684	164684	you	2999	" "
164779	164780	164767	164767	He	2996	" "
164790	164803	164782	164782	you	2999	" Her delicate suffering mouth quivers ; but she is perfectly composed . "
164825	164829	164814	164814	you	2999	be"—with a wretched stunted laugh—"of
164845	164913	164841	164841	you	2999	" Elizabeth does not dispute the fact of her want of acquaintance with Byng 's character , nor does she help his floundering parent by any suggestion . She merely goes on listening to her with that civil white look , while the sportive sea - mews still play at hide - and - seek with the sun - rays on the wide blue fields of heaven . "
164928	164944	164986	164986	he	2996	" says Mrs. Byng , in a voice of the strongest revolt and ire against her destiny—"insult
165057	165063	165048	165048	You	2999	me!"—with a fresh access of angry remorse—"as
165072	165083	165084	165084	You	2999	" This compliment also its pale object receives in silence . "
165100	165118	165084	165084	You	2999	" goes on Mrs. Byng with another dwarfish laugh , which has a touch of the hysteric in it—"a
165182	165229	165170	165170	you	2999	" There is a silence between them . An unrulier billow than usual , yet more masterless in its Titan play , is hurling itself with a colossal thud and bang against the causeway ; and Elizabeth waits till its clamour is subsided before she speaks . "
165232	165237	165170	165170	you	2999	" she answers slowly , "
165273	165421	165422	165422	I	0	" A moment or two later they are on their way back to the Amirauté . The ocean is at its glorious pastimes all around them ; the hill - climbing , shining town smiles upon them from its slope ; but upon both has fallen a blindness . The feelings of Mrs. Byng are perhaps the least enviable of the two . They are nearly back at the beginning of the breakwater , when she stops short . Probably when cool reflection comes , when she is removed from the charm and pathos of Elizabeth 's meek white presence , lovely and unreproachful , she will not repent her work ; but at the present moment of impulse and remorse she feels as if the expunging of the last half - hour would be cheaply purchased by the sacrifice of six months of her remaining life . "
165445	165455	165459	165459	you	3004	" she says , with unsteady - toned humility ; "
165485	165545	165548	165548	I	0	" The tears are rolling down her cheeks , and in an instant Elizabeth 's hand has gone out to her . As it does so , the grotesque regret flashes across the elder woman 's mind that any future daughter - in - law of hers will be most unlikely to be the possessor of such a hand . "
165553	165558	165552	165552	you	3004	cannot"—with a heart - wrung smile—"possibly
165590	165861	165586	165586	anyone	3161	" On their drive home they meet with one or two little incidents quite as funny as the old Jews kissing each other ; but this time they do not move poor Miss Le Marchant to any laughter . Two days later she is called upon to perform the task she has undertaken . Probably she has spent those two days , and also the appertaining nights , in bracing her mind to it , for Jim can plainly see the marks of that struggle , though he is not aware of its existence , graved upon her face , on the third morning after the excursion to the Mole , when he comes in search of her . He does not find her in her accustomed corner of the terrace , but , looking down over the balustrade , sees her sitting below and alone on a small tree - shaded plateau that seems to have been levelled for lawn - tennis or bowls . Probably the giggling and chaffering of the girls on the terrace , and the respectful but persistent importunities of the Omars and Ahmeds to buy their colourful wares outspread on the hot flags have oppressed her spirits . Fritz has carried down for her an arm - chair , a cane table , and a Persian rug for her feet , and she looks as if she were established for the day . Since Byng has been out of danger Elizabeth has returned to her embroidery . She is one of those women to whom needlework is unaffectedly dear , like that other sweet woman "
165870	165907	165586	165586	anyone	3161	" Before she catches sight of him he watches for a few moments her bright bent head and flying white fingers , and is able to perceive how many sighs she is sewing into the pattern . "
165912	165924	165586	165586	anyone	3161	" he says , running down the steps and joining her . "
165941	166013	165939	165939	he	819	" There is no second seat , so he stands beside her , looking up over her head at the tall trees above her , from which immense garlands of ivy are hanging and swinging in the warm breeze . That potent ivy has killed one tree altogether . She glances up at him mutely , knowing that he has not come merely to tell her that the day is fine . "
166053	166146	166044	166044	he	819	" He had thought her nearly as pale as it was possible for her to be when he had first come upon her . He now realizes how many degrees of colour she then had left to lose . While he speaks she has been mechanically pulling her thread through , and as he ceases , her lifted hand stops as if paralyzed , and remains holding her needle in the air . It has come , then . For all her two days ' bracing , is she ready for it ? "
166149	166181	166044	166044	he	819	" The whisper in which this monosyllable is breathed is so stamped with a fear that borders on terror , that his one astonished thought is bow best to reassure her . "
166245	166246	166212	166212	him	3012	" "
166252	166287	166248	166248	I	0	" she says , standing up suddenly , and with trembling hands laying her work down upon the table , and beginning from dainty habit to pin it up in its protecting white cloth . "
166302	166353	166300	166300	me	0	" She turns away from him and fixes her unseeing eyes , glassy and dilated , upon a poplar tree that is hanging tasselled catkins out against the sky . Then once again she faces him , and he sees that there are cold beads of agony upon her forehead . "
166358	166361	166300	166300	me	0	" she says huskily—"wish
166384	167141	167142	167142	I	0	" Then , motioning to him with her hand not to follow her , she walks quickly towards the hotel . It is impossible to him to stay quiet . He wanders restlessly away , straying he knows not whither . The mimosas are out charmingly in the gardens , sending delicious whiffs of perfume from the soft yellow fluff of their flowers . The pinky almond - trees are out too , but not till long afterwards does he know it . By - and - by he finds himself strolling , unhindered by a gardener placidly digging , through the grounds of a villa to let . Gigantic violets send their messages to his nostrils , the big and innumerable blue blossoms predominating over the leaves , which in England have to be so carefully searched for them . Superabundant oranges tumble about his feet ; arum lilies , just discovering the white secret hid in their green sheaths , stand in tall rows on either side of him ; a bed of broad beans points out the phenomenon of her February flowers to him . He sees and smells none of them . Have his senses stolen away with his heart into Byng 's bedchamber ? They must have done so , or he could not see with such extraordinary vividness the scene enacting there . He has himself helped to place it in such astonishing reality before himself . Does not he know the exact position of the chair she is to occupy ? Did not he place it for her before he went to fetch her ? Nor can his reason prevent his distorted fancy from presenting the interview as one between happy and confessed lovers . Even the recollection of her features , ghastly and with beads of agony dewing them , can not correct the picture of his mind as he persistently sees it . That she meant , when he parted from her , to renounce Byng , he has no manner of doubt . But does not he know the pliancy of her nature ? Is not he convinced that the rock on which her life has split is her inability ever to refuse anyone anything that they ask with sufficient urgency or with enough plausibility to persuade her that she can do them a kindness by yielding ? How much more , then , will she be incapable of resisting the importunate passion of her own heart 's chosen one , freshly risen from a bed of death ? Presently his restless feet carry him away out of the villa grounds again . He finds himself on the Boulevard Mustapha , and sits down on the low wall by the roadside , staring absently at a broken line of dusky stone - pines , cutting the ardent blue of the African sky on the hill opposite , and at an arcaded campagne throned high up among the verdure . He knows that it belongs to an Englishman who made reels of cotton , and the idle thought saunters across his mind how strange it is that reels of cotton should wind anyone into such a lofty white Eden ! Can the interview be lasting all this while ? Is not it yet ended ? May not his tormented fancy see the chair by Byng 's sofa once again empty or occupied by nurse or mother ? Will not Mrs. Byng , will not Elizabeth herself ; have seen the unfitness of taxing the sick man 's faint powers by so extreme a strain upon them ? But no sooner has this suggested idea shed a ray of light upon his darkness than an opposing one comes and blows it out . Has not Byng a will of his own ? Will he be likely so soon to let her go ? Nay , having once recovered her , will he ever let her out of his sight again ? The thought restores him to restless action , and , although with sedulous slowness , he begins to retrace his steps towards the hotel . At a point about a quarter of a mile distant from it , the lane which leads to the Villa Wilson debouches into the road , and debouching also into the road he sees the figure of Cecilia , who , catching sight of him , as if unable to wait for him to join her , almost runs to meet him . "
167150	167155	167142	167142	I	0	" says she eagerly . "
167156	167158	167142	167142	I	0	Oh!"—with a laugh—"to
167184	167185	167173	167173	you	3014	" "
167192	167193	167186	167186	I	0	" "
167218	167284	167285	167285	I	0	" There is such a flat tepidity in the tone of these expressions of commiseration , something so different from the tender alertness of Cecilia 's former interest in their object , that Jim , roused out of his own reflections to regard her more attentively than he has yet done , sees that she is preoccupied by some subject quite alien to the invalid . "
167293	167300	167285	167285	I	0	you"—with a sort of angry chuckle . "
167317	167381	167310	167310	you	3014	" At her words a wonder as idle and slack as his late thought about the reels of cotton crosses him as to what possible piece of news to be told him by the buxom and excited person , before him could give him the faintest pleasure . That wonder sends up his eyebrows , and throws a mild animation into his voice . "
167384	167385	167310	167310	you	3014	" "
167388	167389	167310	167310	you	3014	like"—still chuckling—"to
167401	167402	167403	167403	I	0	" "
167410	167411	167403	167403	I	0	" "
167414	167417	167403	167403	I	0	then"—with a dramatic pause—"we
167428	167429	167430	167430	My	0	" "
167434	167460	167430	167430	My	0	" cries he , smiling very good - naturedly , and with a sensation that , though not violent , is the reverse of annoyance . "
167481	167494	167500	167500	I	0	" Cecilia shakes her head and gives a short and rosy laugh . "
167509	167510	167502	167502	You	3014	" "
167512	167543	167561	167561	father	3390	father?"—in a shocked voice . He has a confused and illogical feeling that a second marriage on the part of Mr. Wilson would be a slight upon Amelia 's memory . "
167544	167560	167502	167502	You	3014	Father!"—with an accent that plainly shows him he is still further afield than in his first conjecture—"poor
167576	167603	167573	167574	a stepmother	3021	" She pauses to give a shudder at the idea , while Jim gapes blankly at her , wondering whether she has gone off her head . "
167625	167626	167623	167623	Sybilla	356	" "
167632	167701	167627	167627	Sybilla	356	" Although Mr. Burgoyne has not got it on his conscience that he has ever either expressed or felt anything but the most strenuous and entire disbelief in Sybilla 's maladies , yet it has never occurred to him as possible that she should engage in any occupation nearer akin to the ordinary avocations of life than imbibing tonics through tubes and eating beef essences out of cups . "
167710	167726	167732	167732	she	356	" continues Cecilia , not on the whole dissatisfied with the effect of her torpedo . "
167782	167783	167779	167779	her	356	" "
167787	167788	167779	167779	her	356	" "
167848	167849	167850	167850	Sybilla	356	" "
167854	167855	167850	167850	Sybilla	356	" "
167939	167940	167933	167933	I	0	" "
167943	167968	167969	167969	You	225	Crump"—with an emphasis so intense that Cecilia bursts out into a laugh of a more genuine character than any she has yet indulged in . "
167977	167990	167969	167969	You	225	" she cries , as soon as she can again speak distinctly . "
168015	168016	168009	168009	she	356	" "
168026	168043	168017	168017	She	356	" returns he , recovering enough from his first stupefaction to join Cecilia in her mirth ; "
168053	168054	168055	168055	You	225	" "
168059	168077	168055	168055	You	225	away?"—raising her eyebrows , and with a tinge of meaningness in her tone which vaguely frets him . "
168084	168097	168055	168055	You	225	" he asks irritably , his short and joyless merriment quite quenched . "
168168	168169	168165	168165	I	0	" "
168176	168181	168165	168165	I	0	" replies she demurely ; "
168216	168229	168213	168213	I	0	" glancing at him for confirmation of her statement rather too innocently , "
168249	168466	168241	168243	Miss Le Marchant	240	" Elizabeth 's feeble tap at Byng 's door is instantly answered by the nurse , who , opening it smilingly to admit her , the next moment , evidently in accordance with directions received , passes out herself and shuts it behind her . Elizabeth , deprived of the chaperonage of her cap and apron , and left stranded upon the threshold , has no resource but to cross the floor as steadily as a most trembling pair of legs will let her . The room is a square one , two of its thick walls pierced by Moorish windows . Drawn up to one of those windows — the one through which Jim had caught his first glimpse of Elizabeth on the night of his arrival — is the sick man 's sofa . At the side of that sofa his visitor has , all too soon , arrived . She had prepared a little set speech to deliver at once — a speech which will give the keynote to the after - interview ; but , alas ! every word of it has gone out of her head . Unable to articulate a syllable , she stands beside him , and if anyone is to give the keynote , it must be he . "
168512	168657	168503	168503	they	3041	" She has not yet dared to lift her eyes to his face , in terror lest the sight of the change in it shall overset her most unsure composure . Already , indeed , she has greedily asked and obtained every detail of the alteration wrought in him . She knows that his head is shaved , that his features are sharp , and that his voice is faint ; and when , as he ceases speaking , she at last wins resolution enough to look at him , she sees that she has been told the truth . His head is shaven , his nose is as sharp as a pen , and his voice is faint . She has been told all this ; but what is there that she has not been told ? What is his voice besides faint ? "
168685	168705	168680	168680	you	3043	" pointing to the chair which is figuring at the same moment so prominently in Jim 's tormented fancy . "
168733	168759	168761	168761	you	3043	" She sits down meekly as he bids her , glad to be no longer obliged to depend upon her shaky limbs , and answers : "
168768	168769	168761	168761	you	3043	" "
168779	168906	168907	168907	I	0	cushion?"—looking all round the room for one . His voice is courteous , tender almost , in its solicitude for her ease . But is she asleep or awake ? Can this be the same voice that poured the frenzy of its heartrending adjurations into her ear scarce a month ago ? Can this long , cool , white saint — he looks somehow like a young saint in his emaciation and his skull - cap — be the stammering maniac who , when last she saw him , crashed down nigh dead at her feet , slain by three words from her mouth ? At the stupefaction engendered by these questions , her own brain seems turning , but she feebly tries to recover herself . "
168917	168918	168909	168909	I	0	" "
168938	168980	168936	168936	Keats	374	" After all , there is something of the original Byng left , and the ghost of his old spouting voice in which he recites the above couplet gives her back a greater measure of composure than could almost anything else . "
169045	169082	169022	169022	her	1063	" She can see now that he is very much embarrassed — that his fluency is but the uneasy cover of some emotion — and the discovery enables her yet further to regain possession of herself . "
169087	169095	169083	169083	I	0	" she says in her gentle voice , "
169118	169119	169124	169124	one	501	" "
169132	169136	169124	169124	one	501	but"—with a rather forced laugh—"at
169170	169226	169159	169159	I	0	" She moves a little in her chair , as if to assure herself that she is really awake . That stupefaction is beginning to numb her again — that hazy feeling that this is not Byng at all , this polite invalid , making such civil conversation for her ; this is somebody else . "
169246	169271	169239	169239	I	0	" he continues , his embarrassment perceptibly deepening , while his transparent hand fidgets uneasily with the border of the coverlet thrown over him , "
169272	169273	169279	169280	a nurse	1945	or"—laughing again—"I
169310	169417	169292	169292	I	0	" She sits immovable , listening , while a ray of something — can it be hope ? why should it be hope?—darts across her heart . After all , this may be Byng — her Byng ; this strange new manner may be only the garment in which sickness has dressed his passion — a worn - out garment soon to drop away from him in rags and tatters , and in which can not she already discern the first rent ? After all , she may have need for her armour — that armour which , so far , has seemed so pitifully needless . "
169513	169611	169612	169612	You	3049	" Her eyelids tremble , and she instinctively puts up her hand to cover her tell - tale mouth . Surely this is the old language . Surely there is , at all events , a snatch of it in his last words ; and again that prick of illogical joy quickens the beats of her fainting heart , though she tries to chide it away , asking herself why she should be in any measure glad that the love which she has come here for no other purpose than to renounce , still lives and stirs . "
169648	169744	169641	169641	I	0	" He pauses with a momentary failure of his still feeble powers . She catches her breath . Now is the time for her to strike in , to arrest him before he has time to say anything more definite . Now is the time for her to fulfil her promise , her inhuman promise , which yet never for one instant strikes her as anything but irrevocably binding . Does he see her intention , that he plunges , in order to anticipate it , into so hurried a resumption of his interrupted sentence ? "
169766	169864	169870	169870	I	0	" She gives an almost imperceptible start . This ending is not what she had expected , not the one to defend herself against which she has been fastening on her buckler and grasping her shield . The words that it demands in answer are not those with which she has been furnishing herself , and it is a moment or two before she can supply herself with others . He must be referring , of course , to his last meeting with her — that one so violently broken off by the catastrophe of his collapse . "
169875	169882	169870	169870	I	0	" she says , half bewildered . "
169902	169903	169891	169891	You	3049	" "
169916	169924	169908	169908	I	0	" cries he , precipitately correcting her . "
169961	169979	169956	169958	a perfect Bedlamite	3052	No"—going on very rapidly , as it in desperate anxiety to make her comprehend with the least possible delay—"what
170006	170083	170084	170084	I	0	" The two white faces are looking breathlessly into each other , and though of late he has been tussling with death on a bed , and she has been walking about , and plying her embroidery , and dining at a public table , hers is far the whiter of the two . It must be the unwonted exertion of talking so much that makes him bring out his next speech in jerks and gasps . "
170139	170158	170135	170135	him	181	when"—how difficult it is ! he finds it almost as hard work as his mother had done upon the Mole—"not
170229	170234	170242	170242	you	0	wretchedly!"—in a tone of deep distress—"but
170253	170377	170250	170250	I	0	" She makes an assenting motion with her head . At this moment she can not speak : she will be able to do so again directly , but she must have just a minute or two . Yet she must not leave him for an instant in doubt that she understands him . Oh yes , she understands him — understands that he is apologizing for having ever loved her ; that he is awkwardly trying to draw the mantle of insanity over even the Vallombrosan wood . It is true that he does it with every sign of discomfort and pain ; and he looks away from her , as Mrs. Byng , too , had found it pleasanter to do . "
170411	170422	170425	170425	they	3057	there"—glancing towards the now neatly - arranged and empty bed . "
170483	170516	170436	170436	them	3057	" Again that little assenting movement of her fair head . How perfectly comprehensible he still is ! How well she understands that he is renouncing her among the other follies of his "
170518	170560	170562	170562	I	0	days"—college bear - fights , music - halls , gambling clubs . Well , why should not he ? Has not she come here on purpose to renounce him ? Can she quarrel with him for having saved her the trouble ? "
170589	170600	170602	170602	you	3058	you!"—with a momentary expression of extreme impatience at his own bodily weakness—"and
170613	170649	170602	170602	you	3058	" She looks at him , and sees his wasted face flushing with fatigue and worry and mental suffering . Oh , what a bitter wave of desolateness rolls over her ! But she smiles . "
170681	170725	170663	170663	I	0	help"—she stops abruptly in compassion for the look of acute regret , shame and remorse that crosses his sharp features , and , in her mercy to him , gives a different close to her phrase from that which its beginning had seemed to bespeak—"than
170734	170848	170726	170726	you	3058	" Her tone , quite unconsciously to herself is inexpressibly touching ; and Byng , weakened by illness , turns his face upon the pillow , and breaks into violent weeping . His mother had cried too . It seems to be in the family . She has risen — what further is there for her to stay for?—and pauses quietly at his side till the paroxysm is past . Her standing posture tells him that she is going , and he consequently struggles to recover himself in some degree ; but having never cultivated self - control when he was in health , it declines to come at his enfeebled bidding now . "
170855	170890	170726	170726	you	3058	" is all he can stammer . She looks down upon him with a strange and tender smile , in which for the moment the selfless , pitying sweetness has swallowed up the misery . "
170947	173077	173079	173079	you	3059	" She walks cheerfully to the door , and , reaching it , turns , still wearing that smile , that he may see how perfectly friendly is her last look ; but he does not see it . He has rolled over on his face , and the whole sofa is shaking with his sobs . The Byngs are gone , having got off just within the time first suggested by the sick man 's mother . But , after all , he has to be carried on board the Eugène Perrère . Since his interview with Miss Le Marchant , his progress towards recovery has scarcely been so smooth or so fast as before ; and perhaps his mother is right to bear him away with what seems such overhaste , even though it be on men 's shoulders that he has to make his exit . At all events , he is gone . The hotel — of which a part of the inmates have seen him only prostrate and bleeding , and the other and larger part have not seen him at all , but have had their curiosity whetted by the tale of his calamitous arrival , only to have it balked by his hurried departure — crowd into the entrance - hall , some on one pretext , some on another , most on no pretext at all , to see him go . There are only two of the visitors whose faces can not be seen among the good - naturedly curious and sympathetically pitiful group that watch the exodus of the little party . Who shall say how those two spend the hour of Byng 's departure out of their lives ? Jim has accompanied the invalid to the quay to see the last of him ; has stayed with him till the final bell warns non - passengers off the boat ; has left him with all the proper requests and adjurations to let him know how the sick man bears the voyage ; how they get on , etc . But as Mrs. Byng stands on the upper deck and watches the trail of churned water lengthening between her and the dwindling high white town , she has a feeling that her old friend does not like her as well as he did , and that it will never again be quite the same thing between them . The Byngs are gone — have been gone a fortnight — and March is here . Over the villa faces the begonias have broken into riotous flower , and the snowy - blossomed fruit - trees , that have put on their snowy garments but lately , stand out in bright fragility against the heavy green that never , even in January , ceases to wrap itself about the lovely Moslem town . Every day for the last fortnight , Jim , too , has been going , but he is not yet gone . His guns have arrived ten days ago , and his friend has expressed by post and wire his weariness of exploring the bazaars of Tunis alone . But he is not yet gone to join that impatient friend . Why does he still linger in a place where , as he had justly explained to Cecilia , there is nothing for him to do ? Why indeed ? It is a question that , by night and day , by the insolence of the staring moonlight which slides in upon his restless open eyes by night , under the fires of the great spring sun at noon , he asks himself . All the answer he can give is that it would be hardly friendly to choose this moment , when she is so down in the world , to leave Elizabeth . She is down in the world ; there can be no mistake about that . Even her father , who has returned from his wanderings , must be aware of this fact . Perhaps that is the reason why he no longer snubs her as much as he did ; why he even accepts , with some semblance of graciousness , those affectionate and watchful ministrations which she tenders him with as gentle an assiduity as in her brighter days . But he has still no great appetite for her society ; and she , unresentfully divining it , gives up to him , without repining , the one great solace of her melancholy — her mother 's company . If Jim were gone , the more part of her life would be spent alone . She tells him so — tells him , with a sweet flattering smile , how much his comradeship is to her . Has he any right to rob her of that last prop ? It is only to himself that the breathless clamberings up the steep short cut to El Biar , deep and brambly as her own Devonshire lanes , that the gazings in common over the pigeon - necked sea and the amaranth hills , can do any harm . They may put a sting into his own after - life — a sting that all the empty years that follow may be powerless to extract ; but to her they serve only as a narcotic to numb the intensity of that ache which the cured madness of Byng has left behind it . Some day , of course , he must leave her ; he can not pass his whole life at her side ; some day soon leave her to walk and sit and study her Italian Grammar forlornly alone . But it must not be until she has a little plucked up her spirits . As soon as he sees any signs of this occurring , he will quit Algiers — quit it comfortably , with the consciousness of having done a good - natured thing , by which nobody is the worse . This is the compromise at which he arrives with the inward adviser — conscience , common - sense , what you will — that is hourly admonishing him to be gone . Does Elizabeth guess that her retention of the companion , to whom she so desolately clings , hangs on her remaining always as crushed as the first ten days after those cruel interviews with the Byngs , mother and son , had left her ? If she did , she would probably seek to check the first faint revivings of cheerfulness in her inveterately gay spirit . Instead , while her heart is yet at its sickest , she earnestly tries to foster the tiny seeds of cheerfulness , saying to herself that it is mere selfishness in her to inflict her dismalness upon her one friend ; seeking rather to lift his spirits , which seem scarcely less drooping than her own . Does he enter into her motive ? Does not it rather strike him with a species of shock how superficial must be the nature , how on the surface the suffering , of one who can already begin again to take a mischievous interest in the Widow Wadman 's amours , and to mimic afresh the Cockney twang of the French Vicomte 's English governess ? It is three weeks to - day since the Byngs left . The weather is fine , and a hot sunbeam is lighting up the painful indecision of Jim 's face , as he stands in his bedroom with an open telegram in his hand , which two hours ago was put into it . It is from his friend at Tunis , and is conceived in terms which demonstrate that the indignation of the sender has got the better of his economy . It contains a stringent representation of his inability any longer to dance attendance upon Burgoyne 's whims , and a peremptory request , answer paid , to be at once informed either that he will join him immediately , or that the idea of their joint excursion has been entirely abandoned . He is standing holding the paper in miserable uncertainty , torn by doubts , rent in twain by conflicting emotions , when the noise of voices and laughter outside the house draws him to the window . The room he has occupied since he vacated his own for Byng looks out over the hall - door , and in front of that door a small group is gathered — the Vicomte , his two boys , his girl , her governess , a coal - black negro who serves as kitchenmaid to the establishment , and — Elizabeth . They are all gathered round a tiny donkey , such a bourriquot as the valiant Tartarin slew , which has evidently been brought up for sale by its Arab master . Attached to its head gear are two long reins , and holding these reins is Miss Le Marchant . As Jim looks out , the bourriquot , taking some strange freak into its little brown head , sets off galloping at a prodigious rate ; and Elizabeth — white gown and blonde hair flying — gallops after it . As she is dragged at racing pace down the drive , her immoderate laughter comes borne back on the wind to the spectator of whom she is unconscious . The latter has turned away from the window , and sat down to his writing - table , where he is scribbling a hasty answer to the missive which has cost him such long deliberation . It does not take a minute to pen now that he has once made up his mind , nor can it be more than five from the moment of the donkey 's start to that when the telegram is on its way to the Post Office in Zameth the porter 's hand . The die is cast . When this is the case after long irresolution , there must always be a sense of relief , and perhaps , therefore , it is relief which Jim 's face , thrown down upon his arms rested on the table , expresses . Since no one can see that hidden face , it is impossible to say . He has certainly no wish that Elizabeth should be unhappy . Her patient white misery had filled him with tender pity and ruth ; and yet her laugh , sweet and delicate as it was with all its excess of merriment , rings jarringly in his ears . She is incapable of a great constancy . He had promised himself to stay with her until her spirits were restored . Well , he has kept his promise handsomely . He has done with her and her contradictions now . It will be someone else 's turn with her next . Whose ? The Vicomte 's , perhaps . By - and - by he rouses himself . Only a part of his task is yet done . He must tell them that he is going . As he passes the looking - glass , he sees that his hair is roughened and erected by his late attitude . He passes a brush hastily over it . He must not look a Bedlamite like Byng . He finds Mr. and Mrs. Le Marchant sitting under the ficus - tree on the terrace — the terrace which , at this hour , they have to themselves . She is reading aloud to him paragraphs out of the Algerian paper , translating as she goes along , since his French is about on a par with that of most Englishmen of his standing . He is leaning back in a wicker chair , with an expression of placid good - humour on his face . Across his knees the hotel cat — a plain and ill - natured animal — lies , loudly purring , while he obligingly scratches her judiciously whenever she indicates a wish for that relaxation . As Burgoyne remembers , Mr. Le Marchant had always been on very friendly terms with the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air . About the little group there is such an air of content , of harmony , of completeness in itself , that none can connect the idea of a third person with it in anything but an interloping attitude . And yet there is a third person whose presence must be continually infringing its happy duality , since niche of her own in life has she none . "
173084	173102	173103	173103	she	193	" asks Elizabeth 's mother , laying down her paper as the new - comer draws near ; "
173109	173172	173173	173173	She	193	" The intimate friendliness of her smile as she gives him this bit of information — the matter of course taking for granted that he must be seeking her whose society he has so wholly monopolized of late — plants a new sting in Jim 's sore heart , and robs him for the moment of the power to make his announcement . "
173181	173196	173197	173197	I	0	minutes"—still with that bright look of kindly confidence that she is answering his thoughts . "
173204	173209	173197	173197	I	0	" he answers abruptly . "
173223	173315	173316	173316	I	0	" The shaft is sped . Though he is not looking at Mrs. Le Marchant , he knows that her face has fallen . Upon Mr. Le Marchant 's , on the contrary , an added shade of cheerfulness is visible . Mr. Le Marchant has ceased any overt opposition to the young man 's intimacy with his family ; but none the less is the young man aware that the father has acquiesced but grudgingly in the footing on which he had found Jim on his return from his tour . "
173330	173337	173327	173327	he	4887	dangerous"—laughing , oh , how forcedly ! "
173344	173353	173338	173338	You	0	" says Mr. Le Marchant , almost cordially . "
173385	173386	173376	173381	the mongrel hotch - potch one	3064	" "
173399	173431	173376	173381	the mongrel hotch - potch one	3064	" asks the wife . The geniality has gone out of her tone , and the sunshine out of her face . There is a touch of involuntary wistfulness in both . "
173442	173443	173441	173441	My	0	dawdling"—more laughter—"has
173475	173540	173472	173473	the Escurial	380	" There is a general silence . Well , it is done . Neither husband nor wife makes any effort to alter his resolution or detain him . They do not even put any questions to him as to his future projects . He has nothing to do but remove himself and allow them to resume that happy little duet which he had disturbed . "
173596	173597	173583	173583	I	0	" "
173603	174016	173583	173583	I	0	" replies Mr. Le Marchant , in the easy and comfortable tone of one to whom it is a matter of supreme indifference whether or not that farewell meeting ever takes place , and Mrs. Le Marchant says nothing at all . He has adduced his necessary packings as an excuse for leaving them ; though , indeed , they neither wished for nor asked any excuse ; yet nothing is further from his intentions than to enter at once upon that occupation . She has walked to Biermandreis . In five minutes he is walking thither too . There are a couple of roads that lead there , and of course he takes the wrong one — the same , that is , that she had taken , so that , although he walks fast , yet , thanks to her start of him , he has reached the pretty little flower - shaded French village which , with its white church and its École Communale , looks as if it were taken to pieces at night and put to bed in a toy - box — he has reached it , and has , moreover , traced half his homeward way , before he overtakes her . The path by which he returns is a rough Arab track , cut in low steps up the hill , each step a mass of fossil - shells — whelk , and scallop and oyster shells , whose inhabitants died — strange thought!—before Adam saw Eden 's fair light . It is a charming road , cut , in part , through the red rock , over which the southern greenery tumbles . He has approached quite close to her before she sees him . She is sitting on a camp - stool by the wayside , looking vacantly before her . Her figure is rather stooped , and her straight back bent , as if it were not worth the trouble to hold it up . Beside her , on the ground , lie a little tin colour - box and water - bottle and a drawing - board . He wishes , with a new pang , that he had not come upon her so suddenly . He is afraid that this is one of the aspects of her that will stick most pertinaciously in his memory . Catching sight of him , her whole sad , listless face lights up . "

174135	174156	174117	174117	she	3071	" I want to buy him ; only I am afraid he might die of sea - sickness going home . "
174157	174158	174161	174161	he	3071	" Perhaps"—scarcely
174165	174268	174161	174161	he	3071	" I should like to buy a little cart to harness him to — such a one as I saw just now going along the road , drawn by a tiny bourriquot that might have been twin brother to mine . Some Arab children had dressed out both him and his cart with branches of that great yellow fennel — his long ears and his little nose peeped out so pathetically between ; another child walked after barefoot , waving a great acanthus - leaf . You never saw anything so pretty ! Yes , you must break mine in for me , "
174272	174286	174161	174161	he	3071	" it will not take more than a week , I am sure . "
174287	174308	174161	174161	he	3071	" If it did not take more than a day even , I am afraid I should have to decline the appointment"—seizing
174317	174338	174339	174339	She	3073	" I am off at six o'clock to - morrow morning . I — I want to see the Escurial . "

174516	174588	174589	174589	She	201	" It has been great good luck for me that you have stayed so long ; I know that it is out of pure kindness that you have done it , and it has made all the difference to me . I — I am quite set up again now , thanks to you ; and — and summer is coming on , and I shall do very well — capitally ! "
174676	174680	174675	174675	her	201	" gentle physic , "
174691	174703	174704	174704	he	3071	" It must come to an end some time or other ! "
174713	174716	174704	174704	he	3071	" Yes ! "
174863	174873	174874	174874	She	193	" You were a very good friend to me ! "
174897	174904	174874	174874	She	193	" I do not know how . "
174905	174933	174874	174874	She	193	" And friends — real , good friends — should not have concealments from each other , should they ? They should tell one another about themselves ? "
174934	174937	174874	174874	She	193	" Yes . "
174941	174985	174874	174874	She	193	" I have often wished — often tried to tell you about myself ; but I could not . I never could ! I can tell you to - day if you wish , if you care to hear . Do you care ? "
174986	174991	174874	174874	She	193	" Do I care ? "
175032	175053	175015	175015	She	3084	" I shall be all right when I have once begun , but it is bad to make a start . "
175054	175079	175015	175015	She	3084	" Do not make it ! do not tell me ! I adjure you not to tell me ! it hurts you too much ! "
175080	175096	175015	175015	She	3084	" It would hurt me more to let you go without telling you . Do you remember"—rushing
175100	175126	175127	175127	He	3085	subject—"at the time you stayed with us at the Moat , that there was a great talk among us of my having my portrait painted ? "
175139	175145	175127	175127	He	3085	" Yes , I recollect . "
175146	175163	175170	175170	her	3084	" Father was wonderfully proud of me in those days ; it seems impossible to believe it now"—with
175172	175176	175170	175170	her	3084	statement—"but he was . "
175177	175182	175127	175127	He	3085	" Yes , yes . "
175183	175216	175217	175217	Jim	181	" Do you remember all the arranging and planning as to who was to be the artist , and that he was to come and stay in the house to paint it ? "
175252	175271	175220	175220	his	181	" Yes , yes ; he was not an Englishman , was he ? We used to laugh about him"—adding
175285	175295	175220	175220	his	181	recollections—"used to call him the ' distinguished foreigner . ' "
175296	175300	175220	175220	his	181	" Did we ? Yes"—slowly—"I
175307	175333	175220	175220	his	181	Well"—gathering herself up for a supreme effort , panting painfully , and turning her head quite aside so that he may have no glimpse of her face—"he
175359	175506	175507	175507	I	0	" One would have thought that Jim had been in some measure prepared for the just - fallen blow , both by the overheard fragments of Mr. Greenock 's conversation with the Devonshire clergyman at Florence last year ; by the accumulated evidence of there being some blight upon Elizabeth 's life ; and , lastly and chiefly , by the ravings of Byng . But there is something so different from all these , so infinitely more dreadful , in hearing this naked statement from her own lips , that it stuns him as much as if he had never received any hint of that ruinous secret in the background of her life . Having now uttered it , she stops , either to pick up her own spent strength or to give him the opportunity for some question or comment . He makes neither . "
175534	175548	175528	175528	he	251	" Again she breaks off , but still no sound comes from Jim . "
175595	175640	175657	175657	He	251	" His continued muteness must daunt her , for she here makes a longer pause than before . Indeed , it is only the fear lest she should mean it for a final one that enables him to force out the two husky monosyllables : "
175644	175656	175657	175657	He	251	" She is always most obedient , and she now obeys . "
175727	175737	175721	175721	you	3087	" The listener makes a slight motion of assent . "
175805	175847	175801	175801	father	3390	" Even at this moment the thought darts across Jim 's mind that he has never known Elizabeth miss an opportunity of implying some praise of that father whose harshness towards herself he has so often had an opportunity of witnessing . "
175913	175914	175907	175907	they	3095	" "
175922	175945	175917	175917	he	251	" says Jim , indignation at last giving him words . She puts out her hand , as if to stop him . "
175950	175957	175917	175917	he	251	" she says , almost authoritatively ; "
176008	176047	175988	175988	he	251	" She pauses , pulled up by a deep sigh , at the reminiscence of that young gaiety , then hurries on , as if afraid of his again breaking in upon her narrative with some scathing ejaculation . "
176081	176091	176092	176092	He	251	" Jim stirs uneasily , galled by the comparison . "
176176	176242	176264	176264	He	251	" She stops to let pass two Frenchmen and a Frenchwoman of the petit bourgeois class who are sauntering homewards , frisked about by two little cheerful curs , and with armfuls of hawthorn — yes ; real English hawthorn — in their embrace . They look inquisitively , but not rudely , at the pale couple , and now they are out of sight . "
176312	176341	176289	176289	she	3101	" Jim sees how increasingly , how horribly difficult of relation is the tale as it nears its catastrophe ; but he is quite incapable of helping her . "
176348	176349	176350	176350	he	251	another"—almost brusquely—"and
176407	176475	176483	176483	he	251	" There is mixed with the hurry and shame and anguish of her tone such an element of almost regretful compassion as she pronounces these last words , that Jim 's jealous wrath awakes . Does she , then , love him still ? In her heart for how many is there lodging at once ? For Byng ? For this unknown ? For how many more ? "
176568	176579	176550	176550	I	0	once"—with a piteous effort to mitigate the severity of her silent judge—"and
176595	176635	176591	176591	I	0	" Far away a dull cloud , rain - charged , is settling over the Kabyle mountains , rubbing out their toothed ridge . Can she hold out to the end ? She has not reached the worst yet . "
176751	176781	176785	176785	I	0	" She has repeatedly put up her handkerchief , and passed it over her brow , but it is useless . The cold sweat breaks out afresh and afresh . "
176881	176897	176898	176898	We	3096	" Again that touch of almost tender ruth in her voice makes her auditor writhe . "
177053	177566	177567	177567	She	3130	now"—shuddering—"and as I had no change of clothes I lay all night outside my bed . It took a great deal to keep me awake in those days , and , wretched as I was , I slept a good deal . The next morning I awoke , feeling more cheerful . We should be married in the forenoon , return home in the afternoon , to spring our surprise upon the children and Fräulein , and be ready to receive and be pardoned by father and mother on their return to - morrow . It had not occurred to either of us that there would be the slightest difficulty in pursuing this course . We had decided upon at once inquiring the name and address of the clergyman in whose parish the hotel was — going together to ask for an interview , and beg him to marry us at once . We had a vague idea that a licence might be needed , but relied upon the clergyman also to inform us where that might be got . In one respect our plans had to be at once modified . When I came down I found that there was such a dense fog that he would not hear of my venturing out into it , particularly , he said , as my staying behind would entail no delay ; since , when he had obtained the licence and engaged the clergyman , he would , of course , at once come back to fetch me to church . I gave in , though I had rather have gone with him , and fought my way through the fog than stayed behind , alone in that dreary sitting - room . I was there nearly all day by myself until late in the afternoon . The fog was so thick that I could not see a finger 's length beyond the window , nor even across the room . I had neither book nor work . I had nothing to do but walk up and down by the flickering light of the bad gas , which was burning all day , and look at a wretched little dead aucuba in a pot . Sometimes I went out on the landing to see if there were any signs of his return . I had done this for the fiftieth time , when at last I saw him through the gas and the fog , coming up the staircase . I could not wait till he had reached me , but called out over the banisters , ' Well ? Well ? ' His only answer was a sort of sign to me to go back into the room ; but I did not understand it at first . Not until I saw , coming up the stairs too , a little behind him , the face of — of — that clergyman you saw at Certosa — our clergyman whom we used to make fun of . Oh , why did we ? "
177589	177948	177581	177581	she	3130	" As soon as I caught sight of him I ran back ; but it was too late . I knew that he had recognised me . I do not , to this day , understand how he came to be in that out - of - the - way place ; whether it was a most unfortunate coincidence , or whether he had seen us in the train or at Paddington , and tracked us there . I ran back , as I have said , into the room ; but I did not really mind much his having seen me ; it would all be explained so soon , and I was too much taken up with the bitter disappointment in store for me to give him more than a passing thought . Of course you will understand that it was not in the power of any clergyman to marry us , as neither of us had lived in the parish for the requisite time beforehand , nor could we be married at a registry office , as our names had not been entered in the registrar 's book for the legal time . I think I should have broken down altogether when I heard this if I had not had to comfort him . He was so overwhelmed with the fear that I should think that it was his fault — that he had not done his best . Heaven knows I had no such hard thought of him ! Although we consulted together all that evening , and till late into the night , we could not hit upon any expedient . He had been told vaguely that the Scotch marriage law differed from the English , and that in Edinburgh we might be married at once . But we had not enough money to take us there . Our whole stock would only just buy an ordinary licence , keep us one day more at the hotel , and take us home third class . What should we do ? We did not even try to laugh that evening — that last evening ! "
177980	178097	177950	177950	her	3131	" I did not once close my eyes that night , and when I came down next morning I had made up my mind to beg him to let me go home and ask father to make everything right . I had such confidence that father could set everything right . When I came into the sitting - room he was not there . I waited for him , and after awhile the breakfast was brought up ; but still he did not come . I waited on . It seemed to me odd that , at such a crisis , when we were both so miserable , he should be able to oversleep himself I am afraid"—with
178103	178398	178399	178399	She	3133	remorse—"that I did think hardly of him then . I looked at the clock ; I had been down an hour . I rang for the waiter , and asked him to go and tell the gentleman this . He was so long in coming back that I lost patience , and went out into the passage . I saw a little group of people gathered round a door some way down it . They seemed to be whispering and speaking excitedly , and one chambermaid was crying . In an instant I was among them , through them , in the room . It was his bedroom . He was lying half on , half off the bed . He had evidently not undressed all night , and had taken off nothing but his coat . Before they could stop me — I believe that they humanely tried — I had caught a glimpse of his face , and had heard someone , as if at a great distance off , pronounce the word ' dead ' ! Then everything went away . I believe I crashed down like a log , as Mr. Byng did . When next I came to myself mammy was leaning over me . The people in the hotel had found a letter in my pocket , with my address , and had telegraphed for her and father . They took me home . I do not remember anything about that , but so I was told afterwards , as I was also told that he had died of deep - seated heart - disease , aggravated by his anxiety about me . I have never brought good - luck to anyone that had to do with me ! "
178433	178559	178419	178419	He	181	" For the first few days after I came home I did not feel anything at all , and I saw nobody but mammy . At the end of a week she came to me , and told me that I must pull myself together , for that my father wished me to go with him to an agricultural meeting at Exeter , which we were always in the habit of attending . She said that there were reports about me in the county , which nothing but my appearing in public would contradict She said she knew how hard it was for me , but that she knew , too , that I would try to make the effort for their sakes . For their sakes!"—in
178564	178660	178661	178661	Her	3135	voice—"was not it the least I could do , for their sakes ? I got up ; my legs felt as if they did not belong to me . She dressed me herself — darling mammy!—and she tied on my veil , and — put some rouge on my cheeks ! Think of mammy rouging anyone ! If you remember , we had had some charades while you were with us , and had bought some rouge for them . And then she took me down to father , and we went — he and I. "
178684	178775	178776	178776	She	3136	" We went — and we walked about — among the shorthorns — and the prize poultry — and the tents — father and I — and we met a great many people whom we knew — the whole county was there — but we were too late . Our Rector had been before us with them — and not one of them would speak to me ! Not one of them would have anything to say to me ! And then we went home . Oh , poor father ! "
178810	178929	178930	178930	She	3138	" He was quite right — it was quite natural that he should not allow me to live at home , after that . He said I must not blight the children 's lives — must not stand in the light of the others . So I was sent away to live with some old friends of mammy's — two kind old ladies — with whom she had been at school ; and they were very good to me , and I lived with them until , as Miriam and Rose were married , father thought I could not do anyone any more harm , and he let me come home again . There ! that is all ! "
179443	179465	179436	179436	his	3139	" I do not know how — I have not words strong enough with which to thank you for telling me . "
179466	179486	179487	179487	she	193	" I did not want my one friend to go away thinking more hardly of me than he need , "
179527	179544	179520	179520	His	3139	" I could not well think much better of you than I have done all along . "
179756	179759	179760	179760	He	3139	" Yes . "
179779	179782	179766	179766	Byng	251	" Elizabeth ! Elizabeth!"—he
179790	179817	179766	179766	Byng	251	first—"you — you are the worst - used woman in the world ! and I — I have not the least desire to see the Escurial ! "
