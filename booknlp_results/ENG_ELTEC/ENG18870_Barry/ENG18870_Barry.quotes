1018	1022	1024	1025	the other	618	' Trelingham Court ? '
1031	1058	1024	1025	the other	618	' Why , about six miles if one is a stranger ; under six , a good deal , taking the short cut by St. Mirian . '

1139	1144	1145	1145	He	651	' How very odd ! '
1157	1196	1145	1145	He	651	' I am very likely going to ask an absurd question , but I happened to see a portrait in this year 's Academy of which you strongly remind me , and my cousin pointed it out as — '

1212	1263	1209	1209	he	651	' is Rupert Glanville , and a portrait of me there certainly was , hung rather too near the sky - line , on those much - enduring walls . But you must have observed it closely to see a likeness between it and a chance traveller on the railway . '
1264	1271	1273	1274	the other	618	' I was about to remark , '
1276	1317	1273	1274	the other	618	' that my cousin pointed it out as that of the artist who was coming down to Trelingham to paint the Great Hall . Else , I know so little of art matters that I should hardly have remembered it . '
1318	1327	1329	1330	Mr. Glanville	242	' Your cousin said so , did he ? '
1337	1343	1329	1330	Mr. Glanville	242	' I thought no one — '
1344	1350	1352	1353	the other	618	' It was not he , '
1357	1399	1352	1353	the other	618	' it was she . Not my cousin , Lord Trelingham , but his daughter , Lady May , who was inspecting the pictures that afternoon with other young ladies , and made some of us fellows walk in her train . '
1400	1403	1405	1406	Mr. Glanville	242	' Ah , '
1408	1480	1405	1406	Mr. Glanville	242	' I have never met Lady May Davenant ; and I thought , I imagined , that only Lord Trelingham knew what was proposed . Until I have seen the Great Hall , and heard his plans more in detail , I can not tell whether anything will come of it , so far as I am concerned . That is why I am now on my way to Trelingham Court . '
1481	1484	1486	1487	the Earl	663	' Oh , '
1666	1667	1670	1670	I	0	' '
1674	1710	1670	1670	I	0	' said Mr. Glanville , much amused at the courteous bluntness , or blunt courtesy , of this young man , to whom painting was clearly a far - off mystery , like Chinese chess . '
1734	1735	1736	1736	I	0	' '
1741	1747	1736	1736	I	0	' said the other emphatically ; '
1785	1786	1770	1770	he	243	' '
1792	1797	1798	1798	you	0	' replied Mr. Glanville ; '
1978	2064	2065	2066	Lord Trelingham	243	' To this learned speech the Earl 's cousin made no reply , perhaps because he did not understand it . About epics , classical or medieval , Homeric or Arthurian , he never had troubled himself since he left school ; and there he cared only for the fighting in the Iliad , in which he would have liked to join . Poetry meant less to him even than painting ; but he did not lack brains , and he said by and by : '
2135	2136	2137	2137	I	0	' '
2140	2145	2137	2137	I	0	' said Mr. Glanville ; '
2149	2162	2137	2137	I	0	' And he laughed as if the suggestion had roused his fancy . '
2221	2222	2205	2205	he	243	' '
2231	2236	2223	2223	He	243	' said the other , '
2274	2281	2271	2271	you	0	' Mr. Glanville could not say . '
2349	2350	2337	2337	he	243	' '
2357	2362	2365	2365	he	243	' said Mr. Glanville ; '
2369	2370	2365	2365	he	243	' '
2376	2383	2365	2365	he	243	' replied the Earl 's cousin ; '
2433	2441	2442	2442	He	243	' Mr. Glanville 's lip curled scornfully . '
2449	2453	2455	2455	he	243	' he said ; '
2459	2460	2455	2455	he	243	' '
2465	2470	2455	2455	he	243	' answered the other ; '
2505	2658	2660	2660	Apollo	251	' A pity if anything should befall him , let me tell the reader , for Tom Davenant , as he sat there with the fun breaking out at the corners of his mouth , was a marvellously good - looking fellow , well - made in every limb , tall and broad - shouldered , with a face so clear and open that to see him was to like him . The artist , since their conversation began , had been scanning with his practised eye the almost too delicate features of this young English Apollo , meaning hereafter to translate him into his own realm of paganism , putting a little more mind into the great blue eyes ( there was enough in the mobile lips ) , and surrounding him with the graceful Hellenic forms to which , in spite of his modern garb , he was manifestly akin . '
2662	2669	2660	2660	Apollo	251	' said Mr. Glanville to himself , '
2710	3806	3807	3811	an astrologer in a play	700	' And he went on with his mental portraiture . I wonder what Tom Davenant would have made of these reflections had his companion uttered them . He was not conscious in the least of the beauty Nature had given him , and thought fishing , hunting , and boating were the only business a man had in life , with smoking for a relaxation . He was a perfectly beautiful , healthy , guileless , and good - tempered youth , fond of every beast he did not kill . But as for Apollo and his lute , he preferred a good fowlingpiece to all the lutes in the world . And he was not exactly shy of the Muses , if Mr. Glanville meant thereby feminine society ; but he thought them uninteresting . Whether he cared for Lady May the uneven tenor of this chronicle must show . The train was stopping at Yalden , a steep , scrambling , irregular village that came stumbling down the red sandstone cliff as though it had meant , in a frenzied or heroic mood , to plunge straight into the sea , but had been pulled up at the last moment and was now unable to get back again . But the sea dealt kindly with it , not suffering trees to grow indeed , and often sending great sheets of spray high up into its face , yet tempering the air and encouraging the fuchsias and rhododendrons to flourish plenteously in the open , so that when our travellers arrived the village was all colour , fragrance , freshness , its houses embowered in the exquisite long creeping plants which knew how to shield themselves from the sea - wind , and the red sandstone glowing , as the rays of sunset kindled it , like a heavy purple cloak flung carelessly on the ground . The waters were restless under a freshening breeze , thin lines of foam stretching themselves along and curling back as they touched the sands , which at this point make a shelly , narrow , and undulating beach . A little way beyond the village , where the sandstone yielded to some harder and more primitive rock , might be seen a tiny creek hemmed in by huge cliffs , under which , brawling and defiant , rushed one of those short , swift rivers that delight in quarrelling with every stone they meet and fall into the sea all foam and trouble . It was the Yale , from which Yalden takes its name ; and its brief journey began on the moor above . There , too , the railway paused , shareholders not being in love with steep gradients and preferring to economise their resources , while the one or two small inns of Yalden added to theirs by sending flys to meet passengers on alighting . Mr. Tom Davenant had telegraphed that he might be looked for by such a train , and as he and Mr. Glanville leaped on the platform they saw the Earl 's brougham awaiting them . With windows down and the carriage going at a good pace over the moor , it was a pleasant evening drive ; though Tom Davenant would have preferred riding , which was to him , as to an Usbeg Tartar , the natural way of getting from one place to another . He had talked a great deal for him , being of a silent and self - contained disposition , in the last half - hour of their journey ; and he was not sorry that Mr. Glanville left him to his thoughts as they drove along . The artist , indeed , was no more inclined to speak than the hunting - man by his side . He was all eye , gazing out upon the rolling moor which unfolded itself before them , now up , now down , seemingly boundless , except in one direction where the sky bent over it to the western waters , fringing it in this light with a golden line that never wavered , while on the wide waste there lay a stillness , intensified by the dying murmur of the sea they were leaving behind . And here again the red sandstone glowed purple , the heather looked glorious as the rain of sunshine fell upon it , the clouds grew more solemn and appeared to be drawing together , trailing after them fiery streamers , and leaving wide spaces of tender pale green vapour , which would melt later on into the dark blue of the evening sky and make room for the stars . Strange , too , it was to see the lonely boulders , each like a ghost standing in his place on the moor , brought thither in the long past time when a river of ice travelled over it , one knows not how , one can not reckon when , grinding its slow way onward till it slipped into the ocean , leaving these tokens that once it had been . There were dips full of verdure and flowering shrubs , reaches of bare sand , and , as the road bent down and away from the sea , a dark copse or two , sheltered , as on a lee shore , by the higher ground , to whose sides they clung timorously . As the carriage turned a steep corner and began to ascend again , Glanville perceived that they were entering a narrow valley , which widened as it went up to the moor by easy steps , and was clothed to the right with underwood which the sun had now ceased to illuminate , while to the left all was heath and furze . They were entering the Park . They passed one gate and then another ; above the trees , which here found no difficulty in growing , came out the turrets of a great house . A few more minutes brought the carriage to the broad gravel sweep of a terrace facing south - west , along which ran the massive undecorated front of Trelingham Court ; and the Earl himself , who was walking to and fro as if in expectation of his guests , came forward to meet them . He gave each a hand , and bade the artist welcome . Lord Trelingham certainly bore out his cousin 's half - mocking description of him as '
3812	4212	3807	3811	an astrologer in a play	700	' ; neither white beard , nor velvet gown , nor skull - cap was wanting . He wore on his little finger an amethyst inscribed with Solomon 's seal ; and his wrinkled , tawny face , dim eyes , and lean , tremulous figure heightened the effect , making him altogether like a man who had stepped down out of a picture and was taking his evening walk , regardless of the fact that he had been buried and his portrait counted among the family heirlooms for a couple of centuries . He was not so tall as his young cousin , but had an air of dignity which softened to the utmost good - nature when the shyness or embarrassment of others called it forth . As he stood on the terrace , enjoying the prospect and pointing out the way they had come to Glanville , the artist could not help admiring the beautiful old man , and asking himself whether immense wealth and high rank always did spoil human goodness , as is commonly said . Here was an unspoiled rich man , one of the great ones of the earth , yet so gentle and unaffected that to live with him would imply neither time - serving nor ceremonious posture - making . It might , however , involve superstitious practices , if the Earl were bent on winning disciples to astrology . And Glanville , who had a lively fancy , began to smile at a Burke 's Peerage recorded in the stars . They went in , passing through the Great Hall which was to be the scene of Glanville 's achievements . It was a magnificent room , opening straight on the terrace , and designed for the solemn banquets of former days , when a man feasted his tenants and neighbours at the same tables and counted his guests by the hundred . It was lighted from above , but at the farther end an immense window reaching from floor to ceiling gave a view of the inner court , with its lawn and fountain now in shadow , and a screen of dark foliage , the beginning of an extensive plantation . Trelingham Court was built in collegiate fashion , sheltering its woods from the sea , and sheltered by then in turn from the north - east . '
4218	4223	3807	3811	an astrologer in a play	700	' said the Earl ; '
4237	4974	3807	3811	an astrologer in a play	700	' and he left Glanville in the butler 's charge . That stately gentleman , it is needless to observe , was though perfectly well - bred , much more ceremonious than his master . He perpetuated in a lower sphere what one has heard of the manners of la vieille cour , that Versailles the graces of which must have been hopelessly lost during the French Revolution but for such fortunate survivals . In this diginfied way Glanville was shown to an apartment overlooking the front terrace , and giving views of the broken and rock - strewn line of coast , beyond which the waters spread out in a golden sheet . The sun was sinking , clear and ruddy , on their extreme edge . It was an hour to muse or write verses rather than to dine . But the great British evenign sacrifice called for its votary , and Glanville proceeded to attire himself in the garb of blackness appropriate thereto . On entering the drawing - room he found some ten or twelve persons , of whom he knew none but his host , standing about in the mournful way which seems to have been prescribed by a Plutonian master of ceremonies for the minutes preceding dinner . Every one was hungry , and even the ladies looked pensive or distracted , for the hour was late . Glanville had no gift of taking in a company at a glance ; he was led forward blindly , introduced to Lady May Davenant , who presided over her father 's household ( for the Earl was a widower ) , and whose face , as she was standing with her back to the light , he could scarcely see,—bowed submissively to another lady whose name he did not catch , but to whom he offered his arm with the readiness required of him , dinner being that instant announced ; and moved on to the dining - room not unwillingly , for all the romantic scene of lights upon the sea which curtains now shut out and the flowers and subdued lamps of a dinner - table replaced . Dazzled though he often was on coming into a room , Glanville had quick eyes and ears . When , in Homeric phrase , his mind was getting the better of its desire of meat and drink,—in other words , when an excellent soup and a glass of old sherry left him philosophically calm and capable of observation,—he looked across the ferns and surveyed the assembled guests at his leisure . Mr. Tom Davenant , who had followed him into the drawing - room , was now sitting opposite by the side of a clerical - looking lady whose partner in life was not far to seek ; for the only clergyman present ( he had said grace , but of course Glanville did not hear him ) at that moment drew all eyes by remarking in a cheerful voice to the Earl that his two volumes of the Life of King Arthur would be out to - morrow . Glanville , a little alarmed at the announcement , earnestly scrutinised the speker 's countenance . It was a bright , good humoured face , betokening no malice , and made veneable by the crown of white hair which set off a noble - looking head . Lord Trelingham , however , replied that Mr. Truscombe 's work could not have appeared at a better time ; it would no doubt help Mr. Glanville to more vividly reproduce the local colouring which their frescoes in the Great Hall would demand . Mr. Truscombe was the clergyman of the parish , expressly invited to meet the artist on the ground of his being learned beyond all others in British antiquities , and already famous by his great book on the holy wells of Cornwall and Cumbria . Glanville received this piece of news with a polite air , but inwardly began to chafe at the appearance of King Arthur and British antiquities during dinner . No one could be more sensitive , or less given to the jargon of his trade than he . So sensitive , indeed , was the man , that he had not yet overcome his vexation on hearing from Tom Davenant that the Earl had spoken of him as '
4985	5069	5072	5072	his	703	' He did not know that he should paint it . One thing was certain : if he undertook the design he must be left to his own inspirations , or it would be a failure . He had hoped to come down as an invited guest with no preliminary flourish of trumpets , to meditate upon the work in solitude , alone with Art , his unseen mistress ; and here was a whole dinner - table ready perhaps to ask him , '
5075	5335	5072	5072	his	703	' or , worse still , to brings out their own by way of suggestion . Glanville was a fiery , shy , unmanageable spirit , quite beyond Lord Trelingham 's comprehension . The Earl could not have dreamt what thoughts were passing through his mind at the mention of Mr. truscombe 's King Arthur and the short discussion to which it gave rise . For an instant the design which had brought Glanville from London was in danger . He had more than once started at the shadow of interference and flung his work aside . Could he but have done so now ! Innocent Mr. Truscombe would then have proved himself the Deus ex machina , the divine agency that cuts an otherwise insoluble knot and gives the tragic story a happy ending,—or rather , in this case , the tragedy would never have begun . But no , the personages of the play , on the very point of falling asunder and going out by their several exits , were drawn once more by invisible threads into a fated group . Glanville mastered , though not without an effort , the spasm of rage that had seized upon him . At clever evasions he was skilful ; and , while he took care that there should be no talk of King Arthur that evening , so far as he was concerned , only a very keen observer would have known how angry the allusion had made him . It was an evil omen . Instead of the '
5338	5589	5590	5593	The Catholicus of Babylon	5840	' with which he had hoped to begin , he felt as if a raven or other illboding visitant were flapping its wings over the painted scene in which already his imagination was roving . Conversation at the Earl 's end of the table floated to a fresh topic . Another voice struck in , that of Lord Hallamshire , one of his oldest friends , and , like himself , devoted to the interests of the catholicising party in the Church of England . Lord Hallamshire presided at meeting innumerable for the adoption , defence , or further strengthening of the eastward position ; visited the confessors of the faith in prison ; subscribed handsomely to missionary efforts for explaining to the natives of the Andaman and neighbouring islands the exact difference between a cope and a chasuble ; and was a large , good , dull man , with heavy brows and an immovable countenance . His enormous nose , as I have often observed in persons of Lord Hallamshire 's type , indicated solidity rather than sagacity , and a firm grasp of the prosaic side of things . He was now , after some floundering about , holding straight on in an account of what had been acccomplished by the Guild of St. Austell to get the orders of the English Church fully recognised by their Eastern brethren . Their success with the Catholicus of babylon , so far , had been all they could wish . '
5595	5607	5590	5593	The Catholicus of Babylon	5840	' said Glanville , who had recovered his good - humour ; '
5618	5650	5613	5616	the Pope of Rome	706	' Tom Davenant looked at the Earl and broke into a very pleasant smile . But Lord Trelingham , who had no sense of the ludicrous , replied with much gravity , '
5717	5727	5715	5715	St.	256	' He hesitated , trying to remember the name . '
5731	5759	5728	5729	St. Daniel	258	' inquired Tom Davenant , to the Earl 's consternation , who became yet more confused and quite at a loss . The young man continued innocently , '
5784	5795	5728	5729	St. Daniel	258	' Belshazzar gave a feast at Babylon in his hall . '
5797	5803	5851	5851	Glanville	242	' Be quiet , Tom , '
5815	5832	5851	5851	Glanville	242	' You might at least quote accurately . You have spoilt the rhythm of the verse . '
5840	5847	5848	5848	she	714	' St. Paphnutius is the name , '
6007	6133	5977	5985	the younger lady whom Glanville had taken into dinner	721	' My dear May , I met this very Catholicus of Babylon , who has said such civil things of your church , last week in Paris , at Madame de Mont - Bazeille 's . An extraordinarily handsome man , of about thirty - six . He has a face like a statue , and the darkest of dark eyes . But his beard was not so long as I expected . His costume was splendid,—a kind of Oriental satin , of which even Worth does not know the name , for I asked him . And charmingly made up with a ruche , you know , of strange old lace . I daresay it cost a fortune . Monseigneur Sidarlik they called him . '
6134	6140	6142	6143	Lord Hallamshire	249	' That is the name , '
6145	6166	6142	6143	Lord Hallamshire	249	' it is odd you should have met him in Paris . His letter to the Guild was dated Constantinople . '
6167	6180	6182	6183	the lady	722	' Oh , he came on account of the slave - trade , '
6185	6199	6182	6183	the lady	722	' I heard why , but it has gone out of my head . '
6200	6203	6208	6208	his	243	' Doubtless , '
6212	6241	6208	6208	his	243	' it was to ask the French Government whether they could not stop the importation of slaves into Syria . I hope he succeeded in his benevolent mission . '
6242	6247	6249	6251	the young lady	723	' I remember now , '
6253	6293	6249	6251	the young lady	723	' no , it was very amusing . Monseigneur Sidarlik came to consult a great firm in Paris which gives young girls a dot , — what are they called ? Ah , yes , the Prix Montyon de l '
6367	6373	6374	6374	My	0	' Lord Trelingham looked aghast . '
6378	6382	6383	6383	you	265	' he said , '
6414	6814	6815	6815	he	735	' Lord Hallamshire thought so too . The Countess shrugged her shoulders and did not argue the point ; but she held her own opinion . Whether , indeed , she were maligning a blameless prelate , or casting a powerful side - light on the manners and customs of Babylonian Christians , in any case , the subject became too difficult to dwell upon . Lady May inquired of Tom Davenant what he had been doing . He bethought himself of the remarkable meeting with Glanville , and drew the artist into the conversation ; and the Earl 's daughter , though her sentences were brief , and she guided their talk rather than shared in it , kept them off the dangerous themes of painting and religion . Her expression , while she thus fulfilled the duties of her place , was somewhat fatigued . She wore an air of listlessness . But her lips were proud and firm ; and Glanville found himself comparing her voice to the sound of a harp . It was a rich contralto , full of depth and resonance , which gave the commonest words a feeling . What she spoke was not trivial , but it could not be intimate , uttered across a dining - table ; yet there was something,—there was a story to make out , Glanville fancied , though he could not have said why . If she were a blue - stocking , then blue - stockings might be wonderfully impressive . Lady May rose , and the gentlemen fell into politics when they were left to themselves . But Glanville sat considering . He was haunted by the look and still more by the voice of his hostess . She was not exactly beautiful — or was she ? The features were regular , the eyes dark and full ; cheek and throat of a ruddy brown , and hair as black as night . There was intelligence in the forehead , and a proud decision in her movements . Yet in those dark eyes was a far - off look , uncertain , questioning , in the closed lips a habit of self - repression . Could it be that she was unhappy ? passionate she seemed by temperament , inclinning to despise those about her . And the voice again,—'fire and sweetness , '
6820	6827	6828	6828	he	735	' Am I falling in love ? '
6998	7007	7008	7008	he	671	' Thank you so much , my dear , '
7011	7058	7008	7008	he	671	' for helping me to the name of St. Paphnutius . What a wonderful memory you have ! I can not remember names at all , and it gets one into such difficulties when one has to make a speech . But you never forget them . '
7059	7064	7066	7067	Lady May	244	' It is easier , '
7070	7100	7066	7067	Lady May	244	' to remember a name for you , papa , even if it is so out of the way as Paphnutius than to see you in trouble over it . '
7101	7104	7106	7106	Glanville	242	' So , '
7108	7131	7106	7106	Glanville	242	' she is not a church dictionary after all ; she is only an affectionate daughter . I am glad of it . '
7169	7211	7166	7166	she	722	' I fear Mr. Truscombe 's new book will not be so agreeable to you as to the good man himself . It is a pity the publication should occur just whem you are designing your plans for the great Hall . '
7220	7261	7166	7166	she	722	' Really , I do n't know . Why do you think so ? Perhaps I did not show sufficient interest in the Life of King Arthur . I hope I was not in any way rude to Mr. truscombe ? '
7262	7266	7268	7269	Lady May	244	' Oh no , '
7271	7386	7268	7269	Lady May	244	' but there was something you did not like . My father is the most considerate of men , and admires art and artists . But he does not quite , I think , enter into the nture of their work ; he does not know that inspiration is easily checked . He would fancy that you and mr . Truscombe might , to some extent , combine your gifts in the decoration on which he has set his heart . But if I understand — perhaps I do not — the quality of your painting , I should think it impossible for you to do so . And I saw you were annoyed . '
7387	7390	7392	7392	Glanville	242	' Well , '
7399	7445	7446	7446	he	242	' I was . I may not have any inspiration to boast of ; and no doubt Mr. Truscombe could teach me about the local colour . But I have always worked alone , and a partner would be unendurable to me . At least , '
7455	7473	7446	7446	he	242	' there is only one from whom I ask advice , and I seldom take it then . '
7474	7483	7485	7486	Lady May	244	' He must be a man of genius , '
7499	7528	7494	7494	she	244	' for your painting has so much that is peculiar . I can not imagine two minds , much less two pairs of hands , engaged in it . '
7553	7612	7550	7550	He	5691	' My friend does not paint , but he knows all that has been done in painting , and everything else , I think . His advice , like that of the demon of Socrates , is chiefly negative . But it is the serverest criticism ; it takes down the studio walls and lets in the sun . '
7613	7618	7620	7621	Lady May	244	' How very interesting ! '
7623	7634	7620	7621	Lady May	244	' and is he known ? Has he written anything ? '
7635	7651	7652	7652	They	755	' Not a line . He is quite unknown , and will never be famous . '
7691	7723	7687	7687	she	5673	' I wonder by what secret association it is that one thinks of rain and storm on such an evening as this ? There is not a cloud to be seen . '
7724	7734	7736	7737	the artist	5691	' And are you thinking of rain and storm ? '
7739	7813	7687	7687	she	5673	' My imagination , I suppose I must call it , has been whispering to me of rain since we came on the terrace . Rain , coming down soft and steady , without a moment 's pause ; and the wind sighing through it , yet not blowing it away . It is strange that fancy should play these tricks . What is the association with a still landscape and radiant moon ? '
7814	7817	7819	7819	Glanville	242	' Contrast , '
7821	7846	7847	7847	he	242	' if we only knew why contrasts suggest each other , or why extremes meet . It is too deep a philosophy . But , '
7852	7911	7847	7847	he	242	' there is something in your description of dark rain and wind that reminds me of I know not what musician ; of some one who has put into his composition the voice of a long - continued , hopeless , weeping tempest , which sobs as though it would fain hush itself to sleep and could not . '
7912	7915	7917	7918	Lady May	244	' Oh , '
7923	7964	7917	7918	Lady May	244	' have you those feelings when you hear music ? Do you translate it into figures of people moving , scenery , a sense that you are journeying on and on into unknown lands ? I am constantly doing so . '
7965	7971	7973	7973	he	242	' And I , too , '
7975	8033	7973	7973	he	242	' but in my fanciful accompaniment there are always battles . mighty conflicts upon which the fate of the world seems to hanf . Yes , it was a movement of Chopin 's that you described , the very spirit of the rain moaning to itself secretly . Do you play ? You may have the music . '
8034	8040	8042	8043	the lady	722	' Yes , I play , '
8045	8060	8042	8043	the lady	722	' and there are many of Chopin 's works in the drawing - room . '
8094	8097	8099	8099	Glanville	242	' Then , '
8101	8127	8099	8099	Glanville	242	' let me ask you to lay the rain - spirit with Chopin 's nocturne . Let it weep itself to death on the piano . '
8145	8148	8149	8149	she	265	' May , '
8152	8189	8149	8149	she	265	' are you going to play ? I want you to choose something that will take the moonlight out of my eyes . It has made me quite sleepy ; and you must wake me up . '
8209	8214	8191	8191	she	265	' No , karina , '
8219	8234	8216	8217	Lady May	244	' I shall send you to sleep now . You can wake up afterwards . '
8706	8711	8713	8714	the Countess	5855	' Oh , May , '
8719	8762	8763	8763	she	244	' do you call that playing me to sleep ? I am trembling all over . Where did you find that horrible piece of music ? It was enough to curdle the blood in one 's veins . Do you not think , '
8769	8806	8763	8763	she	244	' that my cousin ought to be ashamed of frightening us so ? I always say she has the voice of a Medea , or a stage - murderess . Do n't you agree with me ? '
8974	9015	8960	8960	She	774	' I learned to improvise when I was a child in Italy ; and the pleasure of attempting it is sometimes irresistible . I hope you were not frightened , like my cousin Karina . She is terrified at everything . '
9016	9023	9025	9025	Karina	270	' Indeed , I am not , '
9028	9065	9025	9025	Karina	270	' but I never could endure your grand style of singing — you know I adore you when you are quiet — since the day it made me fall off the steps at Genoa with surprise . '
9066	9073	9075	9076	Lady May	244	' You were a silly child , '
9078	9101	9075	9076	Lady May	244	' and you fell because you would look back and make faces at me , instead of seeing where you were going . '
9533	9537	9538	9538	he	781	' You see , '
9548	9582	9538	9538	he	781	' it was your prophetic sense that made you think of rain . It seems to have come in good earnest . Last night you must have heard it creeping over the sea . '
9583	9592	9594	9595	Lady May	244	' Then I am a prophetess of evil , '
9597	9620	9594	9595	Lady May	244	' for there has not been such a storm this long while . I could not sleep for the uproar it made . '
9621	9624	9626	9627	Tom Davenant	250	' No , '
9632	9651	9655	9655	him	781	' you are too nervous . But have you seen what has happened in the picture - gallery ? '
9659	9666	9667	9667	he	781	' Oh , my dear May , '
9670	9709	9667	9667	he	781	' such a misfortune ! One of the windows in the picture - gallery blew in during the storm , and has been shattered to pieces . And the portrait of Lady Elizabeth is ruined — utterly ruined . '
9743	9749	9750	9750	he	781	' Lady Elizabeth 's portrait , '
9753	9763	9750	9750	he	781	' I should not have cared for any other . '
9764	9773	9775	9775	May	244	' Oh , father , what a pity ! '
9781	9798	9775	9775	May	244	' How sorry you will be ! Did it fall , or what was the accident ? '
9807	9812	9813	9814	her father	671	' Ruined , ruined ! '
9817	9862	9813	9814	her father	671	' It was found this morning by Redwood lying across some chairs ; the canvas not only scratched , but torn in several places , as if it had been paper , and the face of the portrait damaged worse than all the rest . '
9863	9874	9876	9877	Tom Davenant	250	' It must have been struck bodily from the wall , '
9879	9919	9920	9920	he	671	' by the window frame when it was blown in . You never saw such confusion . Glass , woodwork , and canvas all in a heap together . But can nothing be done ? Here is Mr. Glanville , '
9929	9946	9920	9920	he	671	' he can tell us better than any one whether the harm can be put right . '
9947	9956	9958	9958	Glanville	242	' I am at lord trelingham 's service , '
9960	9971	9958	9958	Glanville	242	' shall I go at once and examine the picture ? '
9972	9978	9980	9981	the Earl	663	' You are very kind , '
9983	10016	9980	9981	the Earl	663	' but you must not stir till you have breakfasted . There is no haste . The workmen have boarded up the window , and laid the picture in a safe place . '
10046	10057	10058	10058	he	663	' We shall feel the loss of it , May , '
10068	10074	10058	10058	he	663	' You will feel it . '
10075	10080	10081	10081	she	5673	' Never mind me , '
10084	10112	10081	10081	she	5673	' if nothing can be done I shall know how to bear it . But till Mr. Glanville has said restoration is impossible we ought to hope . '
10113	10125	10126	10126	he	663	' I have always thought the history was not concluded yet , '
10139	10145	10146	10146	she	5673	' No history ever is , '
10312	10315	10316	10316	he	242	' Why , '
10319	10328	10316	10316	he	242	' it is a Spanish altar - piece . '
10329	10335	10337	10338	the Earl	663	' And a family portrait , '
10340	10346	10347	10347	he	663	' I will tell you , '
10354	10374	10347	10347	he	663	' the history , or what I can of it , in time — but first examine its condition . '
10791	10796	10798	10798	Glanville	242	' How very lovely ! '
10804	10870	10798	10798	Glanville	242	' And how hopeless , I fear , to restore it ! Even if the canvas could be joined and the colouring touched again , how could the most daring painter reproduce the head of the Virgin ? There is nothing to copy from , and , judging by the rest of the figure , it must have been a peculiarly striking and original face . '
10871	10874	10876	10877	Lord Trelingham	243	' Oh , '
10879	10922	10876	10877	Lord Trelingham	243	' we need be at no loss for an original , if the picture were otherwise capable of being restored . You have only to look at my daughter , Lady May , and you will see the face that was vanished . '
10923	10931	10933	10934	the artist	5691	' Indeed ! What an extraordinary thing ! '
10955	11053	10951	10951	her	814	' You were saying that this altar - piece , for such it is , was likewise a family portrait . Did I hear the name of Lady Elizabeth ? And it was like Lady May. Yes , I can just fancy , when I look very closely into it , that there is left even now some shadow of resemblance . But how comes it , if I may ask ? Do tell me the story whilst I go on with my examination . I can not decide in a moment how this should be treated . '
11087	11103	11105	11106	Tom Davenant	250	' You have a morning 's work cut out for you , I should think , '
11108	11131	11105	11106	Tom Davenant	250	' I will go round to the stables and come back in an hour or so , in case you want me . '
11184	11196	11181	11181	she	5753	' Well , papa , Mr. Glanville wants you to begin . '
11224	11268	11219	11219	He	671	' May , my dear , I am not very good at telling a story . I hardly know where to begin . The portrait came into my hands soon after my father 's death , during the war of the Spanish succession . '
11292	11296	11269	11269	He	671	' he said , '
11414	11445	11446	11446	You	242	' Glanville was touched by the old man 's simplicity and kindly tone . A soft light came into his eyes and his swarthy cheek grew ruddier as he murmured , '
11467	11482	11483	11483	I	0	' And Lady May looked pleased , and eager to hear what was coming . '
11486	11492	11483	11483	I	0	' she said to Glanville , '
11546	11547	11537	11537	he	274	' '
11557	11562	11548	11548	He	274	' replied her father . '
11606	11650	11593	11593	me	0	' He looked down , as if collecting his thoughts , and began in a low meditative voice , like one who watches the scenes of earlier days emerging into daylight , from the dim recesses where they hide , at his summoning . '
11986	12216	12222	12222	himself	243	' He and I were of the same college , though in very different sets , for my tastes led me in the direction of religious and ecclesiastical subjects — in short , towards the movement which , beginning at Oxford , had now affected Cambridge also ; whilst his , I am sorry to say , had thrown him into society which , intellectual though it may have called itself , was frivolous and unbelieving . Valence was a young man of the world ; he had never been a fervent Christian , and his studies and associations received that year an unfortunate bent , from which they never recovered . He became an open , a violent atheist . He said the most daring things , scoffed at the University authorities , took my own remonstrances by no means in the affectionate spirit which , I trust , dictated them , and saved himself from expulsion only by quitting Cambridge in a fit of passion and taking his name off the books . He returned , a changed and deteriorated man , to his father 's house . A ruined man , alas ! for it was well known why he had left the University ; and in those days unbelief roused a universal horror and was visited with social excommunication . It is not so now , '
12224	12227	12229	12229	Glanville	242	' No , '
12238	12264	12229	12229	Glanville	242	' I suppose people are more used to it . But how did the change affect Lady Alice ? Did she also give him up ? '
12265	12271	12273	12274	the Earl	663	' I will tell you , '
12276	12651	12273	12274	the Earl	663	' When my father heard of this extraordinary and painful lapse in one towards whom he cherished the kindliest feelings , he sent for Valence and kept him at Trelingham nearly a week , doing his best by argument and exhortation to bring him into a more suitable frame of mind . Lady Alice , who knew of what had taken place , joined her entreaties to her father 's ; and her evident distress might have wrought upon a more decided temper than that of Edgar Valence , had pride for the moment not dulled his affection . It proved all in vain . During their reiterated and , as one may suppose , not very calm discussions , bitter words passed on both sides , and my father could never forgive the harsh , the blasphemous denial by Valence of all that Christians deem sacred . My sister was no less horror - stricken ; I can not , however , think she was much to blame if an affection begun in childhood survived even this rude trial . When my father pointed out to Valence that while he continued an unbeliever his marriage with Lady Alice was out of the question , my sister silently acquiesced . She did not pretend that her feelings had altered ; though she exhibited much self - control , she could not , in bidding her lover farewell , but whisper that she trusted the sky would clear again and all be as before . Valence was free , she said , but she had given him her heart and could wait until he was worthy of it . " That will never be , " replied my father with some anger . " Valence has no heart himself , and what brain he has will bring him to little good . If he can not believe in God , you ought never to believe in him . He will only deceive you . " Valence said nothing , looked for an instant into Lady Alice 's face , bowed haughtily to my father , and turned from the door . Once , and once only , was he fated to cross that threshold again . '
12955	12960	12961	12961	you	275	' said the Earl ; '
13021	13022	13035	13035	him	274	' '
13025	13030	13035	13035	him	274	' replied Lady May , '

13064	13069	13058	13058	You	275	' said Lord Trelingham . '
13488	13587	13480	13480	I	0	' And as he spoke the Earl rose and left the picture - gallery . Lady May turned to the window and gazed out on the sky , which had in nothing abated of its sombreness ; in the heavens was a wild and shifting dance of clouds , directed , as it would seem , by an inconstant breeze , and upon the ear came a long low whisper from the waves which could be seen tossing on the beach and rolling out again to sea . Glanville was deep in contemplation of the wreck before him . '
13591	13597	13480	13480	I	0	' he said half aloud , '
13611	13623	13608	13609	Ivor Mardol	277	' The lady came back at the sound of his voice . '
13630	13691	13627	13628	Ivor Mardol	277	' she said . Before he had time to answer Lord Trelingham entered . He bore in his hand a yellow , dingycoloured epistle , which , when it was unfolded , almost fell to pieces . He spread it out on a table near the window , for it was growing very dark , and said to the artist : '
13753	13809	13810	13810	I	0	' Glanville looked at the paper before him . The ink was faded , and in places the lines were uneven ; but no one could mistake the exquisite character of the hand in which they were traced . There was a date , which I shall not give . But the letter began abruptly . '
13815	13819	13810	13810	I	0	' it said , '
14104	14422	14423	14423	You	888	' This place is called Sepúlveda . You never heard of it , I suppose . A gloomy - sounding name , but a grand , romantic piece of country , some forty or fifty miles from Seville , on the spur of a mountain - range that I can see from my window , stretching across the horizon to the north like the drop - scene of a theatre . I was brought here wounded , I do n't know how long ago . A week , a month , an eternity , for all I can tell ! Down below in the valley I can see , too , the waters of a stream where they broaden into the deep pool of San Lucar . The convent stands on the edge of the pool , and looks at it all day and all night ; for its great ruined windows are all on that side . " The convent — what convent ? " you ask . It is called San Lucar , I tell you . Ought you not , as a Tractarian , to know who San Lucar was ? Did he not work miracles somewhere , and live in a cave , or on a column , or on nothing , for a couple of centuries ? Well , I can not tell you who this San Lucar may have been , for it is not the evangelist , but a local deity . And he is dead , and his bones used to be kept in a shrine of fretted silver in a side - chapel , which , I should think , was always dark in spite of the lamps we saw burning all about it . Oh , my head , my head ! I ramble on , as if I had a thousand years to tell this story . '
14534	14560	14498	14498	Mendizabal	279	' Glanville , who had hesitated in his reading more than once , now came to a dead pause , and said to Lord Trelingham , '
14575	14576	14498	14498	Mendizabal	279	' '
14580	14585	14498	14498	Mendizabal	279	' said the Earl ; '
14621	14627	14606	14606	Valence	274	' The artist read on : '
14815	15191	14808	14808	I	0	' I do not mind acknowledging that the ruffian band , of which I became captain,—for promotion is rapid in these parts of the world,—were as savage and motley a crew as ever escaped hanging . I often seemed to be living over Gil Blas on a grander scale , with all the riff - raff of centuries gathered round me and following the tattered banner of the Revolution . But dirty work must be done with dirty tools . These men were good enough to pull down a system that was worse than themselves ; for it pretended to have come from heaven , and they did n't much care whether they came from heaven or hell ; neither did they trouble as to which of the two would have them by and by . They hated monkery , and they liked a wild life . Certain of them , however , were fierce fanatics ; and one of these gave me trouble enough . He was a stalwart young fellow , more gipsy , I should think , than genuine Spaniard . He had been a monk in Jaen , and had run away from his monastery as soon as he got the chance . How he delighted in breaking open church - gates , and smashing altars , and pulling the great images down from their pedestals ! You will not suppose I minded that ! There is only one mythology I would spare for its beauty — not the medieval , which is a fantastic dream,—but that calm old Greek world of loveliness , where the gods are the forms of Nature become breathing marble , and the heroes are daring and human , with their glorious limbs and fair faces . They have no place in this half - African land brooded over by the sultry air from Sahara , and too hot and feverish to bring forth yellow - haired Greeks . No , I looked on while the churches were defaced and their shrines plundered . But my gipsy - monk would have gone much further . He was , as you would say , no gentleman . And he took my reprimands as sullenly as he dared . '
15553	15578	15541	15541	I	0	' Glanville naturally paused again . Lady May , who had given him the closest attention , said , in a sort of impatience , '
15583	15588	15541	15541	I	0	' And he resumed : '
15598	15603	15604	15604	I	0	' said the manuscript ; '
15700	16060	15676	15677	some one	933	' Las venas con poca sangre , Los ojos con mucha noche . " Little blood in the veins , and heavy night upon the eyelids . I must hasten while I may . We did nothing that evening except to keep the passes of the valley . It was known outside the convent that we had come , and why ; but the peasants had been cowed by the revolutionary frenzy of the towns , and we neither expected resistance nor much cared if it were attempted . We were stirring next day with the sun . What a glorious morning broke over the valley and the stream , and drove back the darkness towards the mountains as with a single sweep of some glittering sword in heaven ! Such a clear light came over the white monastery walls , and was reflected from the lake as we marched up to the huge wooden gates that divided the cloister from the world without . Felayo beat upon them with his thundering club , which had shattered so many before . But they stood unshaken , and we saw that if we were to enter at that point we must open with a regular assault . As we hesitated to begin one of the men cried out that the church doors would be easier . That great building stood outside the cloister and opened on the public highway . We marched hastily towards it ; and what was our surprise when we drew near to distinguish the solemn sounds of choral chanting and organ accompaniment within ! " They are singing Mass , " cried Felayo ; " I suppose they would like to win the crown of martyrdom , as their good ancestors did when the wicked Moors slew them ; " and again he raised his club , this time with effect , against the sacred gates . One blow drove in the rusty lock , a second and a third , aided by the pikes of the rest , broke the framework in pieces , and with yells of rage and triumph the men rushed in . '
16906	16993	17007	17007	I	0	' Meanwhile , the invaders were breaking down the cloister , tearing from their places silver lamps and the precious gates of the various shrines , rending the vestments to pieces , and hurling the great crucifixes to the ground . The noise , the riot , were indescribable . I appointed a couple of men to guard the high altar ; and seeing what was likely to happen now the soldiers were getting infuriated , I made my way over the fallen screen into the nuns '
17322	17676	17677	17677	They	992	' I was greatly embarrassed , for I would not leave the portrait of Alice to the mercy of the new imagebreakers ; and yet go we must . In this perplexity , one of the wounded priests whispered to me that , if I wished to save the Virgin , there was a secure place under the altar where it might be hidden . Let me send the rest away and he would show me . I thought the matter out for a while . We could not get the wounded to Sepúlveda without mules , of which we had very few . Whatever was to be done must be done at once ; but to stay for the wounded could not be an infringement of orders . I sent men off to find means of transport ; and , keeping only three whom I knew to be loyal fellows , when the church was cleared I bade the priest show me the hiding - place of which he spoke . He was badly hurt , but he contrived to reach the altar , and touching the great slab at which mass had been said , he made it move out of its place noiselessly . There was a dry vault underneath , and several huge coffers in it where treasure had once been stored . If the altar were broken down , the vault would be discovered ; otherwise , it was safe enough . We unfastened the great picture , not without difficulty , from its place on the wall ; covered it with remnants of the heavy silk hangings ; and were so fortunate as to come upon a chest which would hold it under lock and key . I took possession of the key , which is now under my pillow , and will never leave me till the picture is removed to some fitter resting - place . The priest explained to me the secret of the spring ; and the great slab , revolving once more , concealed from the returning soldiery what we had done . '
18015	18082	17997	17997	they	1006	' Davenant , if I get well , you must prepare Lord Trelingham to receive me , if only once , within his threshold . I will not entrust the portrait of Alice to another . But when I have put it into his hands , I will turn again and he shall see me no more until he welcomes me as his daughter 's husband . '
18228	18235	18237	18237	I	0	' There was no other signature . '
18241	18246	18237	18237	I	0	' said the Earl , '

19077	19367	19070	19070	Valence	274	' While we talked Lady Alice came back , looking so pale that I ran to her , expecting her to faint in my arms . She thanked me in a feeble voice , but declared that she was strong enough to bear anything save uncertainty . I gave her the letter ; she sat down and was absorbed in it , reading with eager haste , turning back sometimes as though fearing to lose a word , and quite unmindful of our presence . She uttered no exclamation when he spoke of seeing her above the altar ; she was too intent on the sequel , and I dreaded to see her come to his last words . As she did so a fit of shuddering seized her . But with a strong effort she mastered her emotion , and saying only , " I will wait , I will wait , " she let the paper fall to her feet and came and put her arms about our father 's neck . " Papa , " she said , " do not fear me ; I will be a good daughter . Only let , let Edgar come . He will not be so unbelieving then . See how this strange thing has softened him . By and by he will follow your advice , and we shall be happy . " Her voice broke , her eyes streamed with tears . " Very well , " my father replied , " if he comes I will see him . But you must be patient . "—"I will , I will , " she whispered , and took up the letter again and was lost in it . '
19440	19480	19484	19484	himself	5872	' On a dark cold evening in November , when the snow was lying deep , my father breathed his last . We buried him on the bleak hillside , which looks almost as cold and dark this morning . '
19525	19602	19522	19522	He	5872	' The next day , late in the afternoon , as I was seated in my study , and Lady Alice was reclining in her own room , too much exhausted to move , a stranger was announced . He gave no name I bade them show him into the drawing - room . I entered , and my eyes fell on Edgar Valence . Through the windows I could see that it was snowing fast . '
19835	19887	19888	19888	He	5872	' I do not know , " was my answer ; " but had you come in my father 's lifetime , for her sake he would have granted you an interview . He would have done no more ; and , Valence , unless you are changed neither will I. " '
19918	19948	19894	19894	his	5872	' " Be it so , " was my reply , " then you may look for the same course from me that my father would have pursued . " '
19960	20107	20108	20108	I	0	' I knew very well the answer I meant to give . It was imperative on me as a son and a Christian ; but it would cost me a sharp pang to utter it , when I thought of my poor sister lying dangerously ill , without heart or hope , and the desolate future before us . I delayed the fatal moment . Instead of replying , I said to Valence , " Did you return to San Lucar , as you hoped?"—"Return ? " he cried ; " had I not returned and brought away the portrait , do you think I should have ventured hither to - day ? The picture is waiting at your lodge gates . Will you receive it ? Will you tell some of your servants to bring it up ? Do you know anything about it ? " '
20167	20207	20208	20208	I	0	' I shook my head . " There are coincidences , " I answered , " which have an evil purport . I can not think , if you are unchanged , that this will come to good . " '
20338	20445	20446	20447	The men	6002	' Very likely , " he replied ; " I landed at Plymouth that very day , and came with the utmost speed hither . At first I thought of preparing you for my arrival . But you might have declined seeing me , and I judged it better to take you by surprise and trust to the generous impulses"—he spoke with frank courtesy ; how winning I used to think it!—"which have always seemed to me inherent in the family of Trelingham . I saw no one — I was not aware of your father 's illness , much less of what has happened . " '
20776	20981	20761	20761	she	275	' On this understanding we parted for the night . I went to my own chamber , he to his , but there was no sleep for either of us . How was I to reconcile my father 's wishes and the honour of a family which had ever been true to Church and King , with the opinions , the character , the inclinations of Valence ? Lord Trelingham , it is true , had exacted no promise from me ; and my sister , though not of age , wanted so few months of it that to all intents she might be deemed her own mistress . But the very existence of our house was at stake . Who could say that the succession to name and property would not pass to my sister 's issue ? There was no other relative but a distant cousin , and he unmarried , and what if her children were brought up atheists and democrats ? I shuddered at the thought , and my former resolution shone out in the clearest light of reason as of religious duty . But , on the other side , was my sister 's happiness , perhaps her life . '
21655	22181	22182	22182	Her	1102	' The first and last ! One happy moment we had , and then the struggle began again — if struggle it could be called , which was all on my side and most unwilling . I knew that whenever Alice should perceive the physical helplessness to which Valence was reduced , the argument for affection would be strengthened a thousand - fold . It was pretty and exceedingly touching to witness how , on observing his scarred forehead , she clung to him more closely , looking at him again and again with a sort of motherly tenderness . Her tears flowed silently , but she smiled , and , in more cheerful tones than I had heard for many months , she exclaimed , " Well , brother , you see that all is clear now . I can not leave this poor Edgar . He has waited and suffered , and he has my promise . Poor Edgar ! " And she fondly repeated the words as if caressing a child . I was overcome , but not wholly . Valence , still encircling her with his arm , said to me , " Davenant , love is stronger than death , " and he gave me a half - mocking , half - melancholy smile . I will not relate the discussion that followed . On my sister it was impossible to make an impression ; but from Valence I demanded a solemn engagement that he would bring up his children in their ancestral faith , and allow me , or some one whom he might name , to be their guardian . Alice kept her eyes fixed on him , and I question whether she comprehended a syllable of our dispute . It was in vain . At last I reminded Valence of the dignities inseparable from the House of Trelingham , which it was my bounden duty to preserve unimpaired . " And do you think , " he answered , " that I believe more in your titles and laws of inheritance than I do in you traditional religion ? What an idiot I should be ! No , Davenant ; when your sister accepts my hand she breaks , I do not say with the affection of her kindred , but with the delusive greatness they call theirs . She will be no longer Lady Alice ; and you may rely upon it , no child of mine will claim the title or estates , or will touch a stiver belonging to the House of Trelingham . I have enough to live upon ; and if I had not , a man can earn his bread . With your sister 's beliefs I do not interfere ; it is too late , and she could renounce them only to be unhappy . But these things , " he went on , looking scornfully round the gallery and waving his hand towards the long line of pictures , " I think she will give up these without shedding tears over them . Will you not , darling ? " '
22403	22464	22475	22475	you	0	' The Earl 's emotion in concluding his narrative made the last sentence almost inaudible . Glanville would have liked to inquire whether Colonel Valence was still living , and in what part of the world . But he refrained , seeing how deeply Lord Trelingham was moved . After some time , the latter said , with an effort , '
22487	22488	22475	22475	you	0	' '
22496	22500	22475	22475	you	0	' he replied . '
22587	22588	22584	22585	Ivor Mardol	277	' '
22596	22601	22593	22594	Ivor Mardol	277	' replied the lady ; '
22616	22617	22608	22609	My father	5872	' '
22624	22628	22608	22609	My father	5872	' said Glanville ; '
22658	22708	22608	22609	My father	5872	' houses . He is extremely unconventional , and being in manners and education far more than a workman , and refusing to be called a gentleman , it would be no easy task to find , in a house like this , the niche that would suit him . '
22709	22717	22719	22720	Lord Trelingham	243	' What is he then by profession ? '
22722	22726	22728	22728	Glanville	242	' An engraver , '
22730	22907	22728	22728	Glanville	242	' but he works for himself , not for a firm or a newspaper . He is well enough off ; lives in his own little house in a street near Charing Cross , which he has made as quaint and suggestive of the artistic life as any workshop in the time of Quentin Matsys or Albert Dürer ; and is , in short , a quiet , large - minded , quick - eyed young man , acquainted not only with his own branch of study , but with painting and painters , and the history of art since the Egyptians , if they began it . He will sometimes condescend to stay with me , though seldom . He lives in his work and the studies to which it leads him . Odd and out - of - the - way society he likes , and has friends very low down in the depths . I should think he has never seen the inside of a drawing - room , except in a picture . '
22908	22917	22919	22920	Lady May	244	' What a delightfully fresh being you describe ! '
22922	22979	22919	22920	Lady May	244	' you must persuade him to come to us . We will excuse him from attendance in the drawing - room . We will fit him up a hermitage in the Park , or assign him a lodging in the tower . But he must come to us , though we should have to employ stratagem . '
22980	22985	22987	22988	the Earl	663	' My dear May , '
22990	23044	22987	22988	the Earl	663	' you let your fancies run away with you . Of course , if Mr. Glanville thinks his friend would come , and that his knowledge could help us to restore Lady Elizabeth 's portrait , there could be no difficult in letting him follow his own way of life while staying here . '
23045	23051	23053	23053	Glanville	242	' What I was thinking , '
23055	23148	23053	23053	Glanville	242	' is , that if he saw the Madonna he could tell us whether a replica of it is anywhere to be met . Or , indeed , without seeing it he might . On the other hand , should it be necessary to attempt its restoration , I could have no more skilful assistant . The one thing for which I should , in that case , stipulate , would be , as you kindly say , Lord Trelingham , that he might be suffered to live in his own way . '
23149	23160	23162	23163	Lady May	244	' But there is really a hermitage in the Park , '
23165	23223	23162	23163	Lady May	244	' an attempt at an Alpine cottage , just large enough to hold one person and his brushes , if he happened to be an artist . It stands on an islet in the river , screened from observation by wooded heights , and is off the paths in the Chase . It is not far either . '
23224	23229	23231	23231	Glanville	242	' That sounds enticing , '
23233	23261	23231	23231	Glanville	242	' I can not see my way without Ivor Mardol ; and , if your lordship agrees'—he turned to Lord Trelingham—'I will acquaint him with the proposal . '
23262	23267	23269	23270	the Earl	663	' By all means , '
23272	23280	23282	23283	Lady May	244	' And he shall have the Hermitage , '
23285	23294	23282	23283	Lady May	244	' and as much solitude as he chooses . '
23295	23302	23304	23304	Glanville	242	' I can not be sure , '
23307	23337	23304	23304	Glanville	242	' that you will like him ; description goes for so little . He is bright , unworldly spirit , but reserved to excess when not among intimate friends . '
23338	23343	23345	23346	the lady	722	' Is he married ? '
23348	23355	23357	23357	Glanville	242	' Not that I am aware , '
23363	23453	23357	23357	Glanville	242	' but that is one of the points on which he would be most reserved , if the whim seized him . I know nothing of his relations or surroundings beyond what I see . Nor , though we have been friends since we were at school , has he uttered a syllable respecting them . However , personal talk was never a characteristic of Ivor Mardol . His mind is given elsewhere . For a man not yet thirty , he is marvellously staid and self - contained . '
23454	23465	23467	23468	Lady May.	261	' You describe an interesting , almost a romantic personage , '
23469	23482	23467	23468	Lady May.	261	' We must hope he will not be deaf to your persuasions . '
23496	23500	23357	23357	Glanville	242	' almost romantic personage '
23567	23576	23562	23563	Ivor Mardol	277	' something between a workman and a gentleman . '
23583	23591	23592	23592	he	250	' What kind of cross is that ? '
23598	23612	23592	23592	he	250	' I do n't think those half - breeds usually turn out well . '
23640	23645	23662	23662	he	250	' half - breed . '
23678	23692	23662	23662	he	250	' You ca n't get an Arab out of a cart - horse . '
24126	24134	24135	24135	he	250	' What a lonely fellow I am ! '
24140	24161	24135	24135	he	250	' But for Ivor , I should not have a friend , to call a friend , in the world . '
24205	24213	24215	24215	Glanville	261	' And I am alone , too , '
25383	25396	25372	25372	Glanville	242	' fell from running to going , and from going to clambering , '
25887	25893	25895	25895	Glanville	242	' What a desolate place ! '
25897	25929	25930	25930	He	242	' How it makes one shiver to think of the dead in these storm - swept graves by the sea ! Can they rest quietly on such a day as this ? '
26183	26187	26164	26164	his	1207	' darkness visible , '
26972	26978	26979	26979	he	242	' What is that for ? '
27003	27017	26999	27000	the stranger	1207	' It is a signal of distress ; she is likely to founder . '
27018	27022	27024	27024	Glanville	242	' Good God ! '
27026	27038	27024	27024	Glanville	242	' do you mean to tell me she will be wrecked ? '
27039	27044	27046	27047	the other	618	' I think so , '
27062	27113	27046	27047	the other	618	' See , they are signalling again . They will never get into harbour ; if she stands in she will go to pieces on the bar . It is a good dozen miles to the next place where she could run in . But that is only a roadstead . '
27114	27119	27121	27121	Glanville	242	' But the lifeboat , '
27127	27136	27121	27121	Glanville	242	' is there no lifeboat on the coast ? '
27137	27147	27149	27150	the stranger	1207	' What lifeboat would venture on such a sea ? '
27152	27187	27149	27150	the stranger	1207	' It would be merely adding to the number of drowned men . Ah , she signals again ! It is no use ; we shall see her heel over in a few minutes . '
27188	27195	27197	27198	the artist	5691	' Oh , horrible , horrible ! '
27200	27217	27197	27198	the artist	5691	' To look on , and be so helpless . If we could but do something , '
27261	27273	27275	27277	the old man	5911	' You never saw a ship go down , I suppose ? '
27326	27332	27333	27333	he	242	' What makes you ask ? '
27336	27348	27333	27333	he	242	' have you ? You seem not to mind it much . '
27349	27362	27364	27366	the old man	5911	' What difference can it make whether I mind it or no ? '
27368	27478	27364	27366	the old man	5911	' It will not save one of them from drowning . The play must be played out . Do you think of rushing on the stage and rescuing Hamlet or Lear from his fate because you pity him ? No , you sit there quietly and enjoy your sentimental illusions and your exquisite weeping . This is but a larger stage . You ca n't interfere ; be miserable if you must , or if you wish to indulge in the luxury . It is all one to the men in that sinking ship . Ha , what a lurch ! She can not stand much more of it . '
27479	27482	27484	27484	Glanville	242	' Why , '
27486	27520	27484	27484	Glanville	242	' you talk as if you had not the heart of a man . What hideous nonsense ! and at such a time ! You are not , you can not be serious . '
27548	27555	27556	27556	he	618	' When I was your age , '
27559	27632	27556	27556	he	618	' I felt as you do . I have learnt since not to lament the things I can not help . We must bear them . The time will come , if you live long enough , when you will have witnessed many a ship go down , and be as helpless to save them as you are at this moment . Perhaps it is the deepest pity that sheds no tears . '
27683	27689	27690	27690	he	242	' Pardon me , sir , '
27693	27709	27690	27690	he	242	' if I did not quite understand you . This dreadful scene,—it is too much . '
27760	27770	27772	27773	his companion	657	' You will hear no more signal - guns , '
27779	27866	27772	27773	his companion	657	' that was probably the last which came before this overwhelming clap of thunder . Nothing can live when sky and sea are gone mad in such fashion . To - morrow planks and spars will be thrown up along the coast , and we shall have to lay in this nook , which holds too many already , the bodies that may be cast ashore . Well , it is all over now ; when the play comes to an end the tragedy is out . '
27894	27955	27956	27956	he	1207	' The worst is if the curtain should draw up a second time . To be wrecked is unpleasant , but the waves close over you , and you sink to sleep as on velvet cushions . I remember the keen sense of anticipation . That cuts deep into a man . But afterwards is nothing in comparison . No , '
27972	27992	27956	27956	he	1207	' it is coming back to life that I regret , not seeing it slip away into the ocean . '
27993	28003	28005	28007	the young man	5843	' Were you ever in a shipwreck , then ? '
28011	28018	28019	28019	he	5843	' Once , many years since , '
28022	28028	28005	28007	the young man	5843	' And you escaped easily ? '
28029	28053	27956	27956	he	1207	' I was brought back to life when I had been dead , so far as any one could tell , several hours . '
28054	28062	28063	28064	the artist	5691	' Were you unconscious all that time ? '
28067	28071	28072	28072	he	5843	' Utterly so , '
28075	28107	28072	28072	he	5843	' and coming back to consciousness was far more dreadful than the pangs of drowning . I left half my vitality — the best half , I think — behind me . '
28117	28126	28108	28108	Glanville	242	' Is that why you feel so unconcerned ? '
28127	28130	28132	28140	the other , who seemed incapable of taking offence	1265	' No , '
28142	28227	28132	28140	the other , who seemed incapable of taking offence	1265	' I think life itself is the great shipwreck . Existence is made up of pain . It is always and everywhere pitiable . And we are but spectators till our own turn comes to wear the burning crown and be racked and torn . You can not help me , and I can not help you if you stand in need of help . But the sky is clearing now the brave vessel has gone down . Let me wish you good afternoon . '
28361	28379	28350	28350	He	242	' Colonel Valence ? What do you want with him ? He is here at your service . '
28488	28503	28485	28485	he	242	' Have I had the honour of meeting you at any time , sir ? '
28504	28511	28513	28514	the artist	5691	' Never , to my knowledge , '
28516	28554	28485	28485	he	242	' but — but I have heard your name,—something , too , of your history , of your having fought in Spain when a young man . You lived in this neighbourhood once , did you not ? '
28555	28561	28563	28564	the Colonel	1272	' I live here still , '
28567	28590	28563	28564	the Colonel	1272	' and now , since you appear to be well acquainted with my name , may I ask the favour of yours ? '

28623	28629	28631	28633	the modest painter	1278	' An artist , certainly , '
28645	28654	28655	28655	he	274	' Are you staying at the town younder ? '
28669	28677	28655	28655	he	274	' I am staying at Trelingham Court . '
28678	28685	28687	28687	Valence	274	' Oh , at Trelingham Court ! '
28694	28705	28687	28687	Valence	274	' Then I wish you good - day , sir ! '
29039	29051	28990	28990	They	1294	' We should have started sooner , one of them subjoined , '
29060	29079	29057	29058	Mr. Davenant	250	' Glanville was shocked to such a degree that he forgot to thank them for going after himself . '
29083	29088	29057	29058	Mr. Davenant	250	' he hastily inquired . '
29128	29129	29111	29111	He	250	' '
29137	29186	29111	29111	He	250	' cried Glanville , and he had begun to question them as they arrived at the entrance , when , catching sight of Lady May crossing the hall , he ran up to her , and begged to know whether her cousin was in any kind of danger . '
29193	29197	29111	29111	He	250	' she answered ; '
29291	29292	29278	29278	He	250	' '
29301	29328	29295	29295	he	250	' inquired Glanville , feeling very kindly towards the young man , and silently contrasting him with Colonel Valence , not to the latter 's advantage . '
29339	29343	29334	29335	Cousin Tom	303	' said Lady May. '

29397	29416	29392	29393	my cousin	5664	' She rang , and instructed the housekeeper to see that Mr. Glanville was treated as an invalid . '
29429	29481	29482	29482	he	5664	' she added . Under such gracious care did the artist appear at dinner . He looked pale and tired ; with a paleness , however , which set off his bright hair and intellectual features to exceeding advantage . He was not so good - looking as Tom Davenant ; but '
29487	29769	29482	29482	he	5664	' They were a small party . Mr. Truscombe and Lord Hallamshire had gone down to the wreck ; and the Earl , who was very fond of his cousin , could not be induced to quit his bedside until that young man was satisfactorily asleep . The only remaining gentleman besides Glanville was an elderly squire , who lived a long way across the moor and had come to enjoy a few days fishing at Trelingham . He was a good - natured , silent creature , not easily roused to express sentiment of any kind , good or bad ; and while he made you comfortable in his presence ( which some silent men are far from doing ) , you could not expect him even to ask a question . But Glanville was ready to ask a thousand ; and Lady May and the Countess were only too willing to satisfy him . He could ask questions , but he could neither eat nor drink . The light and warmth of the dining - room were grateful to him physically , and took away the chill sense of desolation which so many hours in the churchyard , under the pelting storm , had inflicted ; but his memory was full of the dreadful sight , and yet more dreadful imagination , which had mastered him while gazing at the tossing ship . He could not choose but think of it again and again , and , though he knew not one of the human beings she carried , it would prove an intense relief should any , by the gallant exertions of Tom Davenant , have escaped destruction . '
29779	29812	29772	29773	Mr. Davenant	250	' he asked . The Countess , who exhibited a curious mixture of excited gaiety and sudden relapses into the terror which had laid hold of her that afternoon , answered plaintively , '
29942	29973	29940	29940	May	244	' she cried , with a piteousness in her voice that Glanville could not laugh at , although he felt there was a comic element some - where in it , '
29987	29988	29989	29990	The doctor	1301	' '
29995	30000	29989	29990	The doctor	1301	' answered Lady May ; '
30026	30032	30023	30023	you	244	' she added somewhat mockingly . '
30041	30047	30038	30039	Mr. Glanville	242	' the Countess went on , '
30089	30090	30066	30066	He	303	' '
30109	30113	30102	30102	you	244	' said Lady May. '
30136	30144	30147	30147	my	0	' she continued , looking towards Glanville , '
30314	30315	30318	30318	her	1259	' '
30327	30345	30318	30318	her	1259	' said Glanville ; and he described how she had repeatedly fired minuteguns and received no answer . '
30354	30359	30318	30318	her	1259	' said Lady May , '
30445	30476	30419	30419	You	0	' Glanville nodded assent . It was when Colonel Valence had given the vessel up for lost , and when she had , in fact , disappeared from their view . '
30939	30959	30921	30929	a young fisher - lad who instantly plunged in	1360	' said Lady May , stopping in her narrative as the thought of his peril came home to her ; '
30977	31056	31057	31057	Your	1362	' Karina , who had for some time been listening with her hands clasped , was crying like a child , and could not speak for tears . She looked very pretty and innocent so , like a white rose upon which the rain is falling in heavy drops , while the sun lights them up . Glanville , who felt himself liking Tom Davenant more and more , said , when the silence was becoming rather painful , '
31073	31074	31075	31075	He	303	' '
31080	31085	31095	31095	he	303	' replied Lady May , '
31251	31269	31225	31226	the men	6002	' Again Glanville 's thoughts reverted to Colonel Valence . But he would not speak of him . '
31278	31284	31285	31285	We	1377	' was his next question . '
31312	31316	31300	31300	I	0	' said Lady May. '
31338	31342	31318	31318	you	1379	' he asked . '
31345	31349	31318	31318	you	1379	' she replied ; '
31391	31392	31318	31318	you	1379	' '
31402	31406	31318	31318	you	1379	' he replied , '
31422	31820	31823	31823	he	1385	' He would not mention Colonel Valence . Glanville , spending much of his time alone , and keeping his own confidence because he had none to share it , had fallen into a habit of reserve , which often induced him to be silent when he was , as now , living in a domestic circle . What harm could there be in saying that he had come across a man whose name , since he lived in their neighbourhood , must often be heard at Trelingham ? However , he did not choose to repeat his disagreeable adventure ; and he was spared the temptation , thanks to the Countess Karina , who , in her vivacious manner , was perpetually recurring to the event of the afternoon — admiring , fearing , and hoping by turns as the thought of Tom Davenant 's heroism , of his danger , and the many perils he had escaped already on the hunting - field and the river , came uppermost . All this , from the peculiar lightness of accent which distinguished the fair lady , and the impossibility of a cloud resting long on her transparent brow and sparkling eyes , seemed to Glanville like a fantastic interlude weaving itself up with the horror of the shipwreck and the simple manliness of Cousin Tom . He laughed inwardly , tired and depressed as he felt , at the naïve affection which would not let the Countess be silent . Was she engaged to her cousin ? It did not seem so . She was not more than his age , if so much ; but there was a tone about her that implied the enjoyment of more freedom than is usual in young unmarried ladies , even when engaged . That she was exceedingly interested in Mr. Tom Davenant no one with eyes in his head could help seeing ; not even the placid sportsman , Glanville supposed , who had looked and listened in silence imperturbable during the whole of the narrative , only remarking , when it was concluded , that he knew the man whose stack of timber that was nigh which Mr. Tom had come to grief . He was a sawyer named Frampton , and ought to have taken it away a good week ago to his yard at Plymouth . '
31828	31832	31823	31823	he	1385	' cried Karina . '
31840	31846	31835	31835	you	1386	' she observed next moment , '
31861	31862	31863	31863	Papa	290	' '
31873	31878	31880	31880	he	290	' answered Lady May , '
31885	31962	31880	31880	he	290	' On which hint the other lady rose , and Glanville was left to the company of Squire Huffington . The squire drank his wine quietly , in moderation , and as with a conscience void of offence ; although in the course of ten minutes he did but open his lips once for the purpose of conversation , and then merely to emphasise the delinquency of sawyer Frampton , on which he had before animadverted . '
31976	32112	31963	31963	He	303	' he said . Glanville could not but agree with him ; and after this brilliant dialogue they joined the ladies , just as Lord Trelingham came from his cousin 's room . He gave a reassuring account of Mr. Tom , except that he could not sleep long together because of the pain . But a good deal of pain , the nurse said , was better than insensibility at that stage ; and the patient took it all as a matter of course , and was very obedient to orders . While the Earl spoke he glanced uneasily at Lady May , who neither avoided nor sought his observation . The Countess he patted on the head , but otherwise gave her no great share of attention . Glanville went to bed saying , '
32124	32153	32117	32117	them	1389	' But he was too cold and wretched to pursue the subject , and he spent a miserable night , feeling more feverish than he liked to own . '
32157	32163	32154	32155	Dear Ivor	307	' wrote Glanville next morning , '
32246	32637	32222	32222	he	242	' My dear old fellow , I want you to give me not advice , but two or three weeks of your existence . I am lost if you do not come to Trelingham Court . You exclaim at the notion ; but without you I can not stay here . You know to what severe fits of depression I am liable ; one of them , owing to a misadventure that I witnessed yesterday , has come upon me again , and I shall not shake it off in the mental solitude of this place . Other reasons , curious and important , would have led me to write yesterday . I will explain when you come , and you shall decide whether they would have justified me in asking you to break through your rule and mix in this kind of society . I should tell you that Lord Trelingham , who sends a most cordial invitation , and will be charmed to make your acquaintance,—this banal phrase is not without meaning in the present instance,—knows the ways and customs of the artist tribe too well to think of binding you down to formal observances . You may live as retired here and as much at your ease as in your own sanctum . I have informed him , so far as was required , of the manner in which you meet the world , or , to speak more truly , get out of its way . You shall be a hermit at Trelingham , if you will come , and meet only those you like . If you say the thing is impossible , then , Ivor , I must go back to London . To not a soul in the world but yourself would I reveal this streak of madness — for what else can it be ? I was caught , by the bye , in a storm yesterday afternoon , have neither eaten nor slept to speak of in the last twenty - four hours , and shall want you if I indulge myself in a slight attack of fever . But what is the use of going on ? Send me a line and say I may expect you to - morrow evening . I enclose directions for the journey . RUPERT . '

33709	33712	33714	33714	Tom	304	' Eleven , '
33717	33802	33714	33714	Tom	304	' We did what we could ; but the sea was awful . Our boat rescued six , and the other which followed us picked up the rest . Mr. Truscombe will be pretty well worn out by the time he has seen to the survivors and buried all that may be thrown on shore . He is down there now ; Lord Hallamshire left him in the midst of living and dead , for the poor things that were saved are quite destitute . '
33806	33813	33814	33814	he	242	' Thank you for reminding me , '

34247	34278	34244	34245	the artist	5691	' please , do not think him unmanageable , or morbid , or , as perhaps my account of him has led you to believe , in any way ridiculous . '
34293	34299	34300	34300	she	244	' I do not wonder , '
34303	34387	34300	34300	she	244	' if original people — in a society of portentous dulness like ours , where the outside is solid and the inside hollow — have to wear a mask . They can not help being shy , because they are always solitary ; conversation as it goes on around them must sound like the cawing of rooks . I honour Mr. Mardol 's shyness . It seems to be founded on genius and character , not on the fear of man 's opinion . '
34388	34393	34395	34395	Glanville	242	' It is founded , '
34397	34455	34300	34300	she	244	' on absorption in the greatest thoughts , which often makes him disregard little things when he should be attending to them . He does not wish to be or to appear singular ; but his exceptional gifts make him so ; and he is startled into shyness when the difference between himself and others comes out . '
34456	34463	34244	34245	the artist	5691	' You say he is learned ? '
34464	34495	34244	34245	the artist	5691	' Beyond comparison the best - read man of my acquaintance . Speaks half a dozen languages , understands as many more , and is at home in all literatures . '
34496	34507	34300	34300	she	244	' And his profession — is he skilful in it ? '
34508	34535	34244	34245	the artist	5691	' A most sure and delicate touch . His eye quick in discerning the finest shades , and an equal lightness of hand in rendering them . '
34536	34549	34244	34245	the artist	5691	' But why is he not celebrated ? Has he no ambition ? '
34550	34679	34300	34300	she	244	' I do not think he understands the word . He earns money and gives it away ; talks to me when he wants society , or goes among the working men in his neighbourhood ; travels occasionally in a modest way ; can bear his own company for months at a time ; and would expire with shame if any one pointed him out in the street . Is there not a Roman poet who calls that the summit of ambition — to be pointed at as you go along ? It would kill Ivor Mardol . I think he would give a gallery of his finest prints to buy the cloak of darkness they tell of in fairy tales , and go about in it unseen . '

36405	36449	36393	36393	He	277	' Then you shall at once,'replied Lady May , and she laid her hand on the Countess 's shoulder , where that pensive beauty stood gazing at large out of window lost in sad thoughts of Tom Davenant 's captivity in his room . '
36456	36485	36453	36454	her cousin	6183	' a truce to your reveries ; they are really becoming a mania . We are going to visit the chalet , and these gentlemen will accompany us . '

36753	36765	36806	36806	you	242	' she added , in an explanatory tone to the artist , '
36813	36814	36815	36815	We	1490	' '
36824	36850	36820	36822	Lady May,'said Glanville	310	' But the Countess?'and he turned an inquiring glance on the Lady Karina . She looked down at her boot and across at her cousin . '
36859	36876	36853	36853	I	0	' I do n't like walking over wet grass,'—to which she subjoined in a reflective manner , '
36886	36887	36878	36878	I	0	' '
36895	36927	36892	36893	Lady May	244	' who could want you ? My father is in his library , writing a tract on the connection between the medieval reredos and the mosaics of San Clemente at Rome . 'She

37764	37773	37790	37791	the Prince	1524	' It is a scene of fairyland,'exclaimed Rupert ; '
37797	37798	37790	37791	the Prince	1524	' '
37826	37852	37865	37865	he	1524	' a palace with thickets of roses fencing it all about . Whereas this , which you called a chalet,'he just glanced towards Lady May , '
37881	37882	37865	37865	he	1524	' '
37895	37899	37865	37865	he	1524	' remarked Glanville . '
37913	37914	37865	37865	he	1524	' '
37919	38037	37916	37917	Lady May	244	' and even that is at the discretion of the hermit . For , if you notice , the steps which descend from that projecting ledge , or floor of the verandah , are fastened merely by rings , and may be drawn up when the lake - dweller pleases . It was a fancy of my grandfather 's . The architect wanted a bridge on this side ; and in wet weather it would be a convenience , for the lakelet is stormy enough at times . But my grandfather had a model , " in his mind 's eye , " he used to say ; and nothing would persuade him to allow the bridge . '
38038	38044	37865	37865	he	1524	' He was right,'said Glanville ; '
38097	38098	38102	38103	the Countess	304	' '
38110	38134	38102	38103	the Countess	304	' All I can see is a cottage made of little church roofs and old planks , which must be damp in winter . '
38172	38174	38159	38159	she	1536	' exhalations'and '
38178	38220	38221	38221	she	1536	'She was proud of being matter - of - fact , and said so . A stray reminiscence of Cousin Tom , however , gleamed upon her as she spoke ; and Love contemptuously shook his light wings when she repeated that '
38230	38239	38221	38221	she	1536	' Was the young gentleman up at Trelingham Court '
38245	38587	38221	38221	she	1536	' ? was he not — but there is no need to pursue her meditations . She laughed at herself in a minute or two , though she took care to wait until no one was watching . There was a small boat - house on each side of the lakelet . The party entered a tolerably - sized skiff which they found under shelter , and Rupert and Ivor Mardol took the oars . To make up for her little outbreak of pettishness , occasioned solely by a love for matter - of - fact people , Karina insisted on steering . She was not a creature to bear malice . The water was very still , and so warm and pleasant that they lingered on their mimic voyage to bask in the air and take a steadier look down the valley , which , seen from this point , appeared high and narrow , with the broad gleam of the sea and an intensely blue sky over it , for a perspective . No habitation save the lake - dwelling could be discerned ; the belt of tall brushwood under the lee of which they were loitering hid Trelingham Court ; and the purple moor was shut off by the ridge they had descended . A more lonely , a more beautiful , a more tranquillising scene , who could imagine ? They forgot to praise and were silent . Even the restless Karina felt its subduing influence ; much more did her cousin and the two friends . Transparent light brooded on the glassy depths which no ripple stirred , and seemed to dye the surface with a thousand emerald tints , bright or dark , as it reflected the rich vegetation that , embowering the hillside , crept down to the edge of the mere , and threw out straggling branches to the water - lilies floating on its bosom . A trance at noon - day fell upon our pilgrims ; they dreamt with open eyes . '
38626	38645	38646	38646	My	0	' My father used to spend a day there formerly , but he finds it too cold,'said Lady May. '
38748	38749	38731	38731	I	0	' '
38757	38771	38753	38754	the Countess	304	' that I was to have taken my lesson in fly - fishing . 'Her
38778	38788	38753	38754	the Countess	304	' Well , you may take it still,'said Glanville . '
38823	39288	39292	39293	the servants	1546	' This was an expectation to caress and make much of . The Lady Karina began to steer again with a lighter heart , and forgave Glanville . A few strokes brought them to the side of the Hermitage . The waters were still swollen , and their skiff rose to the middle round of the ladder . A chain hung down over the verandah for the oarsmen to seize ; the boat was made fast to it ; they ascended with quick and easy steps , although the feeling was much like that of getting up a ship 's side , and were soon assembled , without a wet foot or other mishap , on the floor of the verandah . The chalet was built somewhat like a cabin on the main deck of a steamer . Round it was a broad open space , paved with coloured woods , and overhung with a sloping roof to keep out the rain . Casements fitted in made this a comfortable promenade , or deambulation , as the Romans called it , in wintry weather . They were now standing wide open , shaded by the too - abundant creepers ; but the house was airy and dry , furnished with simplicity , as became its pretensions , but the details carried out in admirable taste . There lacked nothing to the hermit 's comfort ; his study , fitted with volumes of the poets and books on fishing ; his sleeping apartment , contrived with a pleasant outlook towards the morning sun ; his dining - room , bright and cheerful as the scene of temperate enjoyment and philosophic mirth should be ; his small but elegant kitchen , copied , as to its decorations , from Pompeii ; and a guest - chamber in the snuggest corner of the house , sheltered from wind and storm by the hills which looked down upon it,—these , with a watch - tower , skilfully perched up among the gables , made a lake - dwelling at which the heart of the troglodyte would have rejoiced . But Ivor Mardol was no troglodyte ; he had not hitherto dwelt in a cave ; and his heart laughed within him , o use an Homeric expression , when he thought of exchanging , for at least a few hours every day , the splendours of Trelingham Court for this lovely , lonely hermitage . He stood in admiration , above all , of the kitchen , a temple of ideal coolness , contrasting with the fiery dens wherein our meals too commonly are made ready at the expense of temper and religion . But Rupert , although he praised what he beheld , inquired after some reflection : '
39294	39303	39292	39293	the servants	1546	' accommodation ? I do n't perceive any . '
39304	39307	39309	39309	Ivor	277	' What ! '
39320	39385	39309	39309	Ivor	277	' Do you imagine that a hermit has anybody to wait on him ? Where would be the charm of solitude , if another human being dwelt and cooked within these walls ? For my part , I should flee out of them and build myself a hut in the wood over against us , did such a demoniac presence come to trouble me . '
39457	39518	39452	39452	herself	722	' But you are very right , Mr. Mardol . When my father stays here he brings a cold luncheon with him ; and Mr. Davenant — as my grandfather used to do — not only catches his own fish , but cooks them , and will not allow a servant to come up the ladder whilst he is here . '
39519	39524	39452	39452	herself	722	' I surrender,'said Glanville , '

But I hope you will give us the pleasure of your company at dinner as often as possible . However , both then and at all times you must look upon yourself as unshackled by our formal ordinances . You see , Mr. Mardol , I have learned how great a lover of solitude you are . '
39713	39717	39624	39625	Lady May	244	' But,'he replied , '

39754	39809	39751	39752	Lady May	244	' we know it will give you pleasure , and it will therefore please us . I think Mr. Glanville touched on this point in conveying to you my father 's invitation .

40097	40163	40018	40019	the artist	5691	' The white sails seem lost in the overpowering radiance . All one can perceive are the heaving hulls , like lines of ebony crossing the gold .

40482	40537	40538	40538	I	0	' What matter?'said Ivor . They were forgetting luncheon . The Countess , partly because she was hungry , and yet more from a dread that in lingering so unconscionably they would be leaving no time for a certain visit as a sister of charity in the afternoon , reminded them of the fact . '
40560	40575	40551	40551	her	1565	' Had we not better be going towards luncheon ? It is past one . '
41406	41468	41396	41396	Glanville	242	' The worst of being knocked up is that a fellow does n't know what to do with himself . He ca n't read anything except the Field ; and I 've read it all through now . I must hark back , I suppose , and see whether I 've skipped a page;'and he took up the discarded journal again . '
41480	41500	41477	41477	Karina	270	' No , thank you,'he answered ; adding , after a while , with some annoyance in his tone , '
41536	41546	41547	41547	I	0	' The Countess blushed , but attempted a smile . '

Davenant?'The curious mingling of sarcasm , fright , and tenderness with which the Countess uttered his name thus formally was worth observing . Glanville , hitherto intent on his letter , began to feel an interest in the little comedy . He knew nothing of the relation in which the Countess stood to the house of Trelingham ; he had never even caught her family name . To the servants she was '
41659	41663	41664	41665	The Earl	663	' her Ladyship . '
41692	41728	41675	41676	Tom Davenant	304	' Countess,'and never bestowed on her a Christian vocative . Sometimes , though seldom , he would call Lady May by her name ; but this favour was witheld from the light - tongued Karina . '
41736	41824	41734	41734	Tom	304	' Not by any means . You are May 's first cousin , because her mother and yours were sisters . But May and I are related on the father 's side . You might as well have argued that your husband was my cousin because he married you . Poor fellow!'concluded Tom in sympathetic accents,—but whether pitying the Countess 's late husband ( she was a widow then , it seemed ) on the score of his marriage or his decease , Glanville could not determine . '
41830	41873	41734	41734	Tom	304	' I know you liked him , and he suffered so dreadfully at the last . It is not pleasant dying at two and twenty . But no , Mr.—Mr . Davenant,'she observed , brightening up after her transient expression of regret ; '

41917	41945	41946	41946	She	265	' if you have suffered in the cause , I suppose it is fair that you should call any English gentleman you choose your cousin . But — '
41950	41968	41946	41946	She	265	' Thank you so much , Cousin Tom,'she said archly , though with contentment in her looks . '

42279	42290	42273	42274	Lady May	244	' Well , what if it were true?'he asked himself . '
42433	42448	42453	42453	She	5855	' But if you do n't care for Tom , you must refuse him . 'Such

42616	42886	42612	42612	you	244	' I can fancy it , however . My Cousin Karina has been so constantly with us from childhood , and her marriage lasted so short a time , that we hardly think of her as a Lutenieff . Her own name , which we never liked , was Karen Zarkoff . My aunt married a Zarkoff ; but he need not have disfigured his daughter by calling her Karen . So we changed it when she came to us quite young to Karina , spelling it with a K to make it look Russian . She lost both parents before she could speak . Her guardian sent her to England until she was sixteen , and then had her taken back to the Ukraine to marry Count Lutenieff , whom she had never seen in her life . There was no help for it . But she cried at leaving my Cousin Tom , who had been her idol ever since she played with him and me during a summer holiday , when we were all three in this house , as we are now . Nevertheless , she liked her husband after they were married ; he was a gentle , consumptive young man , greatly attached to her and to Mr. Davenant , who visited them in Russia . At eighteen she became a widow , and is , in a measure , my father 's ward . But she does what she pleases , and is always on the wing ; for to reason with her or to keep her in one place is impossible . '
42887	42903	42904	42904	His	1623	' And Mr. Davenant?'said Glanville , controlling his voice lest it should betray undue curiosity . '

42967	42988	42962	42962	You	1626	' Mr. Davenant is heir - presumptive to the title and esatates of Trelingham ; and so,'she said , laughing , '
43065	43173	43045	43045	He	250	' All this , told in a calm way , was interesting , but it threw no light on the question whether Lady May and her cousin were engaged . One point only seemed certain . Tom Davenant might be the idol of the Lady Karina 's affections as much as he pleased or , very likely , did not please ; to the Earl 's daughter he was a cousin and nothing more . She spoke of him readily , without changing tone or colour , she lauded his manliness , and at the same time laughingly applied to him the charming words of her poet — '
43209	44441	44443	44443	I	0	' That negligent chaperon , the Countess , who had slipped away at the beginning of this conference , now returned ; and there came an interval of silence , during which , if many fine strokes were added to the face that was growing perfect on canvas , not a few went deep into the heart of one , at least , in that speechless company . And now , reader , I will draw away the curtain , and , with such skill as I may , endeavour to disclose the inward meaning of this simple and oft - repeated scene in the picture - gallery at Trelingham Court . What could eyes behold ? On the one hand a lady , in the dark crimson , curiously embroidered with gold , which vested the Madonna of the Seraphim , and was here in some artistic drapery imitated,—a lady , I say , seated where the light fell on her meditative , earnest brow , glowing features , and massive dark hair arranged as in a crown , her whole attitude one of reflection and yet suggesting a concentrated passionateness which , when she spoke or acted , would manifest itself daringly ; and on the other , moving lightly about the easel , glancing at the seated figure from time to time , smiling a little as he turned to lay on a colour , and murmuring to himself in the painters'dialect , a young man , of good height and graceful mien , of ruddy countenance too , like the lady , but , unlike her , with the yellow hair of the Norsemen or the Greeks , the sleeves of his velvet coat turned up over fine wristbands , and a certain air of distinction , of dainty though not effeminate carefulness in all his attire , which threw into strong relief the genius shining out of his bright and steady eyes . He was at once an artist , a refined man of the world , and an athletic , well - knit figure of youth and comeliness ; one in whom the balance of thought and fancy , of reason and instinct would seem incapable of being over - thrown . The shade of melancholy which came , like a passing cloud , across his countenance when he was not speaking added that indescribable touch , that dim sense of the imperfection hidden in all fair things , apart from which we may admire and be dazzled with the splendour of a face , but do not feed our heart upon it . A pleasant sight , you will say , and worthy of its surroundings in that stately room , where the portraits of three centuries looked from the walls , various in costume , feature , and bearing , yet a gracious assemblage of old and young , of knights and ladies , of warriors , statesmen , ambassadors , recalling confusedly the life of court and camp in which they had acted their part till life 's poor play was o'er . In front of the great windows lay the wild moor , beautiful in desolation , framed in the silver sea , which , now at peace , sent up its multitudionous voices in a murmuring chorus that whispered things sweet and strange . The lady sank , and sank , and sank into deeper reverie . She listened to the echoes in her heart of all that had been in the past , began a sentence to let it fall unfinished , and mused upon the many days she had spent alone . She had been asked in marriage — by whom ? By men whose birth and breeding , equal to her own , carried with it an outward semblance of perfection , but implied neither deep feeling nor elevated thought , nor enthusiasm for anything in earth or heaven except their free open - air life , their horses and dogs , their yachts in the Solent and rivers in Norway . Yes , she had not wanted suitors of a different kind either,—solemn - faced men , with brains as unpromising as Nimrod 's , but whose narrow vision took in objects less picturesque ; her father 's friends , lay or clerical , who asked her to share their destiny and help to build schools in the East End , and churches at Earl 's Court or Stoke Newington , to weave ecclesiastical garments according to the use of Sarum , and save mankind by acres of broadcloth fashioned into coats of the strictest orthodoxy . She smiled at the notion ; but her feeling was bitter enough . Riches , leisure , friends , the most delightful surroundings had been given her by Fortune . She was a great lady , to be envied and courted . But all these things were the embroidery of life ; she wanted the simple greatness which comes of knowing and loving , not a gorgeous frame about the poor genre painting , which was all she had to show . How can a woman be noble , she asked herself , except by uniting her life to another which is governed by the highest thoughts ? She could have devoted herself to a father , to a brother , if she had one , provided only he were intent on realising a great ideal . But her father 's ideal ? It did not tempt her . It was nothing but the digging up of old grave - clothes and multiplication of minutiæ ; it was insular , parochial , sectarian . She had long felt that the controversies of little or no meaning which went on in her presence , and to which she was obliged to listen , were driving her in the opposite direction to her father ; and , though she would not afflict him by disclosing what had taken place within her , she saw clearly that , perhaps for want of the right teacher , the religion in which she had been brought up had become to her merley a name . It gave her no principles , it had ceased to be the rule of her conduct . She longed for a light from Heaven ; she did not remember that it sometimes leads astray . Unhappy she was and had been ; dissatisfied , sick with longing for a world of which , in poem or romance , the outline was revealed like a cloud hanging steadfast , shining sun - bathed in the infinite blue . Was it all an impossible dream ? Even so , she could not renounce it . To bend her gaze on the earth , and putting her hand into that of a man whose thoughts were fashioned of its gross elements ; to travel on and on , over the barren moor , with no prospect before her but the waste and sundown , was to die ere her prime . She was resolved to drink of the fountain of life . She cared nothing for station , and heeded little of the world 's judgment on those that descend . Unworthy she would not be , nor undutiful to her father . '

45480	45490	45492	45493	the painter	800	' Unsatisfied ideals,'she said , as she turned away ; '
45511	45656	45492	45493	the painter	800	' This picture was her book of Hours , her philosophy , for many a day . She lived in it ; she saw its every detail , and could have drawn it from memory . As soon as her mind would let her , she begged Lord Trelingham to purchase the drawing ; but it had made a great impression and was already sold . The intelligence grieved her like a personal loss , and she began to haunt the galleries where other works of Rupert Glanville 's were on view . She had not been deceived in ranking him neither among the votaries of religious medievalism , nor with the school of sentimental landscape , so to call it , which has grown out of the study of the Middle Ages by men whose creed may be summed up in the words , '
45662	46120	46122	46122	he	1674	'When Glanville chose a medieval subject , he treated it like one to whom larger worlds were known ; he was free , ironical , and , as the critics said sometimes , joyously pagan . What he painted was full of life ; life , running over at the brim , energetic , bold , adventurous , taking the infinite resources of existence for granted . But his pictures had in them nothing sensuous or over soft ; they did not represent joy as the intoxication of a Silenus , still less did they affect the morbidezza , the pallid waxen tints which in their excessive refinement denote that the artist has sought beauty in decline and is enamoured of consumption . Glanville 's art was healthy ; one might almost have called it , to use the philosopher 's jargon , optimist . But , as in the drawing which had first made him known to Lady May , so in all he painted , there were suggestions of the infinite unseen , the mysterious and strangely possible . He , too , it was apparent , sought and had not found . His ideal , like hers , was behind the clouds . She came unexpectedly on a small picture of his in a friend 's drawing - room , and acknowledged , by the violence of her emotion , that she was falling in love with the unknown artist . Did she think of subduing her passion , of putting away his remembrance ? With all her force of character , and in spite of her wide attainment and unusual gifts , May Davenant was a very woman . She could do much ; she could not forget , So , at least , she told her conscience when it warned her against caring about a man she had never seen . Might he not be low - born , ill - educated , anything but charming to look at ? this worldly - wise conscience inquired . She did not believe it possible . No , his mind must be equal to his paintings ; and what did the rest signify ? His mind was himself ; birth and appearance , good or ill , were but accessories . However , she would ask and be satisfied . Her father had a multitiude of friends in the world of art . She invited one of them to dinner , was very gracious to him in the drawing - room , and put her important questions among a sheaf of others , trivial , but sufficient to blind the deluded artist , who flattered himself that he was always welcome where ladies ruled . '
46158	46285	46124	46124	Glanville?'—'Oh	334	'—'Much in society?'—'A good deal , he should say ; met him in the best houses , where he was a favourite ; could tell capital stories , not too long ; was not bad - looking ; sang and played a little ; fancied he came from somewhere on the Welsh border — Herefordshire , Shropshire , that way ; had been told he was of good family , all extinct but himself ; not a bad thing when one 's family was all extinct but one 's self , provided they mentioned one in their wills , ha , ha!'—'Rich , did he suppose?'—'Why , not , you know , rich , but landed proprietor , that sort of thing , etc . etc . 'Lady
46443	46449	46433	46433	Conscience	335	' the Belle 's Stratagem . '
46655	46713	46648	46648	She	244	' Mr. Glanville 's is your artist , papa,'she boldly said . The Earl thought for a minute or two . He knew Mr. Glanville 's productions well ; strangely enough , he liked them . In design they were bold and clear ; in execution , it was agreed on all hands , they were admirable . '
46724	47486	46648	46648	She	244	' said the good man finally . When the door closed behind him , Lady May sank down trembling on her chair . What had she done ? This was the first of many interviews which Lord Trelingham held with Glanville , who never showed to such advantage as in adapting himself to men from whom he entirely differed . Valuing his own opinions too highly to bestow them on every chance comer , and not preaching them save by the indirect methods of art , the young man took pleasure in observing how variously the world appeared in other men 's eyes ; and he was therefore attentive to the Earl and charmed him in turn . To accept the commission , though brilliant , was another question . He did not want for money or fame ; he hesitated to leave London for so many months as the task would demand ; and he doubted that Lord Trelingham would enter into his conception of the cycle of the Morte d'Arthur , which was more rugged , primitive , and barbaric , but also of larger scope and nearer , as he believed , to the roots of life and reality , than the current interpretation . To his surprise , the formal ritualist did enter into his thought,—thanks very possibly to Mr. Truscombe , whose volume , then about to be published , had been seen by the Earl in manuscript , and whose sturdy realism had one element , at all events , in common with Glanville 's more elevated historical views . Thus encountering no resistance where he had looked for it , and captivated by the mingled courtliness and good nature of the old man , Glanville consented to pay a visit to Trelingham , and , after seeing the Great Hall , to lay his designs ( of which he drew out a lucid sketch ) before him . He did not propose to call on the Earl in town ; it was a busy time when his engagements stood six deep , and he must add to them if he intended an early departure . Lord Trelingham felt relieved . He had suggested to Lady May , after his first visit , that she should ask the artist to dinner , and she , a good deal to his surprise , had not exactly declined , but put it off , saying that it did not matter and they should have as much as they wanted of him in the country . It was a fancy on her part to begin their friendship away from London , in a less artificial atmosphere . The key - note of an acquaintance is so often struck in the first conversation , and how often wrong ! Mr. Glanville would surely come to Trelingham ; and , with a light heart , she delayed the dawn of a day whose varying fortunes she could by no means have guessed at . Resolute , however , she was in turning over this new leaf , that looked so fair in its gold - illumined border , of the book of her fate . She would have blushed for shame had her intention pointed in the direction for which a hard , practical world would have given her credit . So rude and gross are the maxims upon which social arrangements are calculated that the motives of a lady , at the age of twenty - six , and still unmarried , who takes an interest in a young unmarried genius , seem even to the fair - minded , suspicious or self - evident . What can she want except to marry him ? And there is much to be said for that view . Nevertheless , she does not always want to marry him ; she may be seeking an object of admiration , of worship , which is not compatible at all times with marriage ; or a friend to share her better thoughts ; or simply a comrade whose amusing manners would be lost outside the circle of a numerous society by the domestic hearth . All this will be conceded by the philosopher who sees in life deeper problems than those of ordinary match - making ; but even he , the wise observer , will shake his head when enthusiasm mounts so fast as it did in the bosom of Lady May. She , to her own seeming , had left behind her the '
47493	47519	46648	46648	She	244	' the velvet - footed flower - besprinkled vally where youths and maidens choose one another ; she was , and meant to continue , an '
47523	47572	46648	46648	She	244	' She did not call it the state of single blessedness ; it was only not so miserable as would have been a life spent with any of the suitors that had come to her . What she did ask , had it ever been possible , was the '
47578	48170	46648	46648	She	244	' which is the inward grace of all outward union between man and woman . She dreamt now that in Rupert Glanville was such a true mind as she had hitherto sought in vain ; but the time of marriage was past . With a sigh she looked back , and once more the land of white and green , the daisies and fresh springing grass , had melted into reminiscences of early youth . Glanville was unwedded ; but he might still be her friend , and teach her something better than to feed on romance . I daresay the reader will experience some contempt for Lady May , on hearing that a friendship like this , pitched just right between high and low , appeared in her eyes a state of life to which she and Glanville might be called . And yet she thought so . Inbred modesty would have forbidden her to take steps towards securing a lover ; but how could it interfere with her winning a friend ? Conscience , perplexed , though not entirely convinced , lay down to sleep again . The sacred epochs of fashion were passing quickly by . Lord Trelingham , who usually observed these times and seasons as he did Easter and Saints'-days,—although he never had witnessed a horse - race or owned a yacht,—went down early with Lady May to his country - seat , and summoned Mr. Truscombe to advise him in the selection of historic scenes for the Great Hall . Rupert Glanville likewise , as if he were acting of his own free will , and there were no Lady May in existence , took his ticket for Yalden on a certain morning , and , in so doing , burnt his ships . There was no going back the same man that he came . Thus , at the end of a month , we find these two in the picture - gallery : Rupert , master of himself , uncertain whether he cares for the lady , certain that he does not care with any overwhelming passion ; and she already doubting whether to bind herself to friendship and nothing beyond , or yield to this new absorbing influence which is wrapping her all round in its golden haze . To yield ? But , if he should think of her only a friend , would it not be planting a dagger in her bosom , never to be withdrawn ? He was courteous , attentive , full of pleasant wisdom , open as the day . He would have been a perfect brother . Was that the whole of it ? She longed and feared and grew uneasy , and could find no rest . She knew , what Rupert , being only a man , was not likely to perceive , that Karina Lutenieff watched them ; that she would have encouraged , had she dared , an affection which to her meant the surrender , by her cousin , of Tom Davenant . When the Countess spoke in the drawing - room about Lady May 's giving up the dignity of cousinhood , she was moved by a mischievous desire to irritate all three who were sitting there . She had said , petulantly enough , when the gentlemen left , that it was a shame Lady May did not at once refuse Tom Davenant , since she seemed not to care for him . And Lady May had answered , '
48183	48614	48172	48172	you	1693	' For though the Countess was afraid , and her cousin suspected , that something would occur on Mr. Davenant 's coming of age , neither of them knew of his having already made a proposal in set terms . There were moments , during these days of bewilderment and growing trouble , when Lady May , as she sat listening to Rupert , seemed to catch glimpses of a nobler order of things , where friendship and not love should be the primal element,—rifts in her golden haze through which the pure heavens were seen like unchanging sapphire , a great , free , illimitable world , passionless , tranquil , clear as the morning dawn . They came when he spoke of the artist 's enthusiasm , of his yearning to express the unseen beauty which haunted his steps and whispered in his ear , and vanished so soon as he turned his head to look upon her . Or again , when he descanted on the secret loveliness of landscape , its infinite meanings , its mysterious half - tones , its silent touches lulling the spirit to rest , on the lapse of streams and the glory of foaming waters . While he forgot himself in speaking , she , in her rapt attention , saw the earthly vanish and themselves entering into a unity of which all the love we know is but a trembling shadow . And he spoke of history , of the old classic times , of religion , not as a man largely - informed indeed , but as a true artist , whose eye sees things in their grouping and judges them by the law of the beautiful . It was the high world she had longed to dwell in . How could she think of marriage if this were not the heart of it , the gold that made it precious ? She grew ashamed now , though never before , humbled at the remembrance of what passionate desires she had allowed to come between her and the unsullied light . She would be worthy of him , of his large thoughts and heroic aims ; for did he not make of his profession a heroism ? After a morning spent like this , she went about her household tasks with an air of gentleness , a countenance so clear and eyes so washed in heavenly dews , that the Earl , moved to admiration of he knew not what that was exquisite about her , would say smilingly , '
48641	49496	49497	49497	I	0	' Alas ! she could not . Rupert himself was not always soaring on eagle 's wing . He could be melancholy and dispirited ; he was sometimes worn out with fatigue of which he rendered no account ; for , as I have said , he united to a most winning frankness a reserve that none , except Ivor Mardol , attempted to break into . He was unequal , changeable , or , in his friend 's complimentary phrase , iridescent . Trifles irritated him when serious misfortunes left him tranquil . He could be touchy at a word ; and although in Lady May 's presence he never displayed temper , it was not difficult to perceive that many things tried him . Some afternoons he would make an excuse for strolling out alone , and , going down to the boat - house , unmoor the skiff , leap into it , row across to Ivor sitting philosophically in the verandah of his hermitage , and running up the water - steps like a man pursued , fling himself down on the sofa in Ivor 's study , and lie there silent till the bell summoned him to dinner . He returned , for the most part , in good though not exuberant spirits , and said not a syllable of where he had been or what doing since last they saw him . Trelingham was a pleasant house to stay at ; for its owner possessed the hospitable grace of providing all things for your amusement and never asking whether you had availed yourself of them . But these imperfections , proving that the serene spirit was human , had more danger for Lady May than their joint expeditions in quest of the Ideal . From pity to love is an easy step . She admired , she pitied , she began , despite her interest in the higher friendship , if we may call it so , to love . And mark , reader , for I must tell you the truth as I know it , she felt that , in so doing , she was descending ; she did not admire her love , but yielded to it as a disease . I have heard say that falling in love is like falling asleep ; it implies a quiescent , not an active will . So was it with Lady May. She felt herself falling asleep ; her better resolutions melted away ; her fear of consequences changed to an impetuous hope . The angel - face did not return so often ; the golden haze thickened and shut out the sapphire . She began to long for an acknowledgment of affection from Glanville , as a fevered man longs for the cooling water . She would die rather than speak ; surely she was no Countess Lutenieff to blazon her feelings before friends and strangers ; but how slow the minutes moved until that draught was handed her ? She kept her secret with an agony like the young Spartan 's who felt the gnawing of the fox under his cloak and would not cry out though his vitals were torn . Had men so little perception when a woman was suffering ? But could he return her love merely because she suffered ? No , she would not have it in such a shape , on such conditions ; she would wait and think of that higher world , and — and if nothing came of it , well , she could die . The lady of the lake seated by the dim gray waters , looking on the infinitely unfolding cloud , flecked with faint sunshine , the impenetrable thicket on one side of her , the deserted path away in the green forest behind her;—all the picture came back as when first she saw it , and the same feeling of desolation . Its irony was prophetic , its meaning likely to be fulfilled in her own life with which she was now making a last and desperate experiment . Timid though she felt in approaching a subject that might betray her emotion , she could not refrain one morning from the inquiry what his meaning was in that composition . He asked her in turn , as was not unusual with him , to give him an account of it ; whether it seemed to aim at anything except describing in colour what the poet had described in words . She was dreadfully embarrassed , and wished she had not spoken . In a low voice , hesitating at every sentence , she faltered out her surmises , her probably mistaken opinion , that it implied rather a longing for the unattainable than perfect joy in the realms of romance . Glanville , not laying aside his brush while she spoke , gave her a look of contentment from time to time , and said , when she could keep her voice no longer under control and took refuge in silence , '

49928	50018	49899	49899	You	1709	' But , in her own mind , she was far from granting it . Rupert did not answer immediately . His thoughts went back to Colonel Valence and that forlorn afternoon in the churchyard . He seemed to hear the sad yet mocking tone in which Valence declared existence a universal shipwreck ; and it gave him pause . Too large - minded to call a possibility in question because it was disagreeable , he preferred not to dwell upon it . After a while he answered gravely : '

50261	50398	50202	50202	You	0	' Lady May sank back into her chair and meditated . The unreal vision was love which pined in secret and called forth no response . The reasonable union between herself and Rupert Glanville could only be friendship , if she saw a way to keep it as intimate as now it was becoming . But no way presented itself . He would marry and forget her . She must return to a lonely life . The days ran on ; there was little change in them . And while her own countenance gazed upon her from the canvas , she beheld only the enchanted fay , her eyes full of wistfulness , looking out upon dim waters , upon a mist of weary sunshine , and a world of dreams . Would she ever awaken ? '

Do I think of going ? No . I must if the Earl does not bid me stay . But I am confident he will . There is the Great Hall to be commenced now . Rupert 's designs will have to be made out , and I can help him better than any one else . Why should I not render him the service he expects ? Admirable reasoning , Ivor ! And is it what you mean ? Come , my friend , be plain with yourself ; there is not a soul listening . Let me cross - examine you a little . Now , sir , what are you by profession ? A philosopher . Good . It is not the commonest trade in these times . And what kind of philosopher?—do you pretend to know the essences of things , entities , quiddities , and all the rest ? You do not ? You hold with an uncouth Athenian sculptor , who carved badly , but argued irresistibly , that your business , being a philosopher , is to know yourself and do your duty , not to peer into the mysteries of the gods . Yes , and you consider that a man should rise above his passions and control them , not be swayed as they move . For , you say , they run wild in every direction , all wanting to be satisfied at once , and , like horses that will not obey the rein , each of them pulls the way it would like to go , and is fain to drag the charioteer along with it . Right — quite right . You remember your Greek , I see . But , then , why do you think of staying here ? '
51140	51254	51262	51262	he	277	' You speak very well , better than some books I have read . And , Ivor , were I not looking so straight at you , I should think this was not only the truth , but the whole truth . Ah , you colour at my insinuation ; your eyes droop . I must ask no further . My dear young man , the lawyer shall give place to the physician , to the father confessor . Tell me what that feeling is which has begun to stir like a serpent in your bosom . I will not vex you , but suggest the healing remedies , if any there be . '
51446	51455	51456	51456	he	277	' The thousand eyes are looking into mine , '
51918	52348	51907	51907	his	277	' If hitherto I have been so foolish as to dream of love , and such a love , here is the end . It is not for me . I know my calling , to which , until I found myself at Trelingham , I have never been disloyal . These moments of madness shall not count . Let me recall them now that they belong to the past ; let me examine , in the starry light of intellect , a passion to which , as I think , I yielded too much , but hope to yield no more . The most efficacious means of vanquishing a sentiment is , say the wise masters , to put it under the microscope and analyse it to the last fibre . I doubt that a mistress 's letters , howsoever tender and eloquent they seem to the lover , would charm or subdue if he read them critically to see where the charm lay . I will pluck up this fast - growing wild rose by the roots , trace the delicate , almost invisible threads which it was insinuating into my heart , and leave it , a beautiful dead thing , perfect but withered , compressed between these pages . Am I strong enough to be fair to myself , resolved enough not to run a further risk ? But should I not still be exposed to temptation , while the warm earth cherished the seed of love ? Out with it to the surface ; let the light kill it ! But in what way ? Let me think . This book , so scanty in its record of facts , is abundant in delineation of moods and feelings . I always meant to make it an autobiography,—the travels of a soul towards truth . Why , now , should I not take Carlyle 's advice , and set down the story of my life ? Why not , like Jean Paul , in that charming brief fragment of his , become the professor of biography to myself ? It will bring out the contrast which would make any love of mine for Lady May ridiculous ; and I might turn to these pages for a little cooling of my infatuation should it return . The sweet poison must not run in my veins any longer . This antidote shall allay its fury . Do but let me begin at the beginning , and not spare the subject of the story out of misplaced tenderness . '
52392	53007	52364	52364	he	277	' Of my birth and parentage I know less than a workhouse orphan , except that neither can have signified to the world at large ; for it is something to be chargeable to the parish . All I know is that I was brought up by good - natured , affectionate people , who told me I was no child of theirs . The old man taught me to draw , praised my ability , set me to learn what I could , being a mere lad , of the technique of engraving , and took me with him , almost as soon as I could walk , to his workman 's club , his tradesunion meetings , his political association , his temperance and vegetarian propaganda , but at no time to church . He did not believe greatly in churches . However , I soon learnt that the world was a busy place ; and strange to say , I learnt equally soon that I had nothing to do with its concerns . I liked to see and hear human beings . To attend a crowded meeting and listen to straightforward , energetic speeches , interrupted , encouraged , sometimes put an end to , by a vast audience upon whom not a word fell unobserved,—this was to me as animating as it was instructive . All the arguments I heard were of much the same import ; they dwelt on the misery of the masses and proved it by appealing to ourselves . I was not miserable ; I had all I wanted . But I knew of some in my own street that had nothing , to whom the charity of neighbours supplied a crust now and then , while at other times they went hungry to bed . Did I feel for them ? Have I not often sat down with tears in my eyes to our simple table , because I could not share my little meal with the poor wretches ? I pitied , I caressed the tiny children , so begrimed and neglected , as they sat shivering on the door - step near the street lamp , afraid to go into the dark when night was fallen on the huge city , and mothers and sisters had left them at home — left them on what a business too often ! That , too , I was not long in learning ; the children of the poor know everything . They can not be blessedly ignorant like those who are fenced round about in luxurious mansions and pleasant gardens whither evil does not penetrate easily . But I have known them , though not ignorant , innocent ; though acquainted so young with the ways of life , modest and self - respecting . My teacher might have forbidden me to make friends among these outcast children . He did no such thing . He trusted to the moral influence of the movement of reform to which he belonged ; and his trust was not in vain . Deeply impressed as I was , at an incredibly early date , with a sense of the many things , too bad for improvement , that could not and ought not to endure , there was little room left in my thoughts for what was base or ignoble . I have smiled since on hearing it said that children are too young to understand these things . How young was I when the problem of social misery , shouted from a hundred platforms , became to me as real a fact as it is this night ? '
53279	53623	53248	53249	political economists	1761	' Had I lived in my own family , or known what it was to have brothers and sisters , I too must have thrown myself as I grew up into the reform movement . To change the world , one must have a home , a country , a religion . It is that which gives the local habitation and the name , apart from which our aspirations are like the poet 's dream — airy nothings . But I had neither home , nor country , nor religion . I had only myself and this kind - hearted philosophy . It charmed my imagination ; it roused me at the great meetings to enthusiasm ; it did not hinder me from falling back into that solitary world where I was the only figure . I learned much , and with superhuman quickness ; I spent hour after hour at my teacher 's side , watching all he did , and copying it as he allowed me , always with astonishing accuracy for so young a hand . The good man looked on me , I think , as something uncanny . I must , indeed , have been a weird , elfish creature . And how I went on dreaming , longing , imagining , ever under a presentiment that , sooner or later , a figure would step down to me from the unknown world , and I should enter upon a fresh chapter of existence ! Not that I despised my station , or coveted the rich wares I saw in shop - windows , or thought as I went by the enormous palaces of Belgravia and Tyburnia , that I should like to live in them . My dream did not run thus . I saw myself restored to father and mother , or kissing the lips of a baby - sister , and wandering in the fields , holding my new - found father 's hand . An idle dream ! But , surely , innocent enough . '
53927	54705	54706	54706	Our	1774	' I liked what he read ; but I did not think of disobeying his wishes . What took up my thoughts a great deal more was the fancy , which I indulged without breathing a word to any one , that Christmas Day was my birthday , to be kept sacred by me , to be filled with a vision of home and all that I was by and by to recover of my inheritance of love . Christmastide for me meant infinite hopes , unquenchable desires . I , too , was to taste the joys of childhood , and be folded to a mother 's bosom . While old Mr. Mardol was speaking of the dream of innocence long banished from mankind , or to be found only in the hearts of children ; when he prophesied that by the law of progress it would in due time become no dream , but a universal reality , and the age of reason , of obedience to nature , of unpurchased happiness and sylvan delights , be ushered in with acclamation , and terminate the ferocious strife of man with man , by a treaty of eternal brotherhood , my heart warmed within me , and I saw myself roaming the beautiful forest and playing in its sunlit glades , not an orphan or an outcast , but restored to all that loved me and were by me beloved . I could think of no progress but the change from my wintry desolation to a home looking out on the wide world , yet centred in the rustic cabin of my parents . For it was the firm conviction of Mr. Mardol , as of thousands besides , that , when the day came , mankind would pour out of their enormous modern towns , as on the opening of the prison gates captives rush forth in ecstasy , and would never more shut out the air and light of heaven with high walls and crowded habitations , or heap together corrupting luxuries , every one of which was soaked or stained with the blood and sweat of unrewarded toilers . He called the splendid capitals of Europe and America mouths of hell , where flame and smoke ascended day and night without ceasing , and the shrieks of the damned for ever filled the mirky air . But for the sense of duty which kept him where the battle raged , he would have sold what he possessed and gone away , when he was young and active , to the uncolonised lands in which a man might live as nature intended . But it was a task laid upon him , laid upon me too , he repeated with solemn emphasis , to aid in conquering from effete civilisation the countries on which it had inflicted wars and pestilence and famine , and a tyranny as hurtful to the few that exercised it as to the millions who could not shake it off . Meanwhile , we must share the captivity of our brethren , and teach them to forge weapons whereby freedom might be won . I felt that he spoke nobly ; I was eager to follow his lead ; but my imagination delighted in the remote continents whose soil was yet virgin , and whose pathless woods owned no sovereignty but nature 's . I longed to lose myself in the vast solitude , with only the stars to tell me whether I was travelling towards the equator or the pole ; I spent in thought more hours than I can reckon floating down the mighty rivers in the canoe I had with my own hands hollowed out of a fallen trunk,—floating , dreaming , as the waters bore me onward between forest and forest , the endless branches interlacing over my head , and almost shutting out the sky . Was I called to be a soldier in the war against corrupt civilisation , my pleasure should be to explore in fancy the beautiful regions I could not otherwise attain . I was , and have remained amid a variety of changes , an untamable creature , a denizen of woods and wild places . The deep seclusion of this valley , where now I am writing , the loneliness of the Hermitage , have for me a charm which only those can experience who , living much in the throng of civilised men , yet strange to their ways and feelings , are in dreams transported into the midst of landscapes they have never with waking eyes beheld . '
55150	55561	55567	55568	the stranger	1207	' I must have been about twelve years old , when , as the short afternoon of Christmas was closing in , and the blazing fire made a mixture of light and shade on our parlour ceiling , a ring came to the sidedoor , and Mr. Mardol , pausing in the story he was telling,—I remember it was the life and adventures of Victor Jacquemont , the French traveller in the Himalayas,—rose from his chimney - corner and went to open it . We had no servant , not even a girl to run errands . It was my business to do such commissions for Mrs. Mardol , and very willingly I did them . In a few moments the old man came back with some one I had never seen . Mrs. Mardol , however , did not look surprised . Her husband seemed intimate with the man , whose peculiar appearance , to confess the truth , I did not like . He shook hands with Mrs. Mardol , sat down in the chair she offered him , and asked in a quick but courteous tone , whether the candles standing on the table might not be lighted . I disliked him even for this little thing . I was fond of watching the uncertain dancing shadows on the ceiling and the tongues of fire that leaped among them , before the lights came . He seemed to be intruding on the poetic interval I had enjoyed at Mr. Mardol 's knee ; to be ending my time of poetry altogether . I can not tell why this notion came into my head ; but , as Mrs. Mardol said to me once , I was always fancying something . And so I fancied this , not guessing what the stranger 's business might be . The candles were lighted ; my teacher threw himself back in his chair ; and the unknown guest , backoning me to him , drew the lights where they would fall full on my face and leave him in shadow . I looked at Mr. Mardol ; he smiled encouragingly , and said , " You need not be afraid , Ivor ; our friend will do you no harm . " But I was afraid , although , by a strong resolution , I kept down the trembling that came upon me . How well I remember what ensued ! " '
55613	55694	55605	55605	you	1207	' Well , " said he , " to be rich and wear fine clothes , a new suit every day if you liked , and to drink wine , and eat venison which you had killed yourself , and have servants , and horses , and carriages ? " He spoke in an amused voice , and smiled , not unpleasantly I thought , across at Mr. Mardol . He had not long to wait for his answer . " '
55745	55830	55835	55836	the stranger	1207	' But , " I went on at once , " I have clothes enough , and Mr. Mardol says it is wrong and cruel to be rich . And I do n't want to kill anything , or to eat dead animals , or to drink fire - water . And , " I concluded , out of breath , though not so incoherently as it sounded , " if all men are equal , how can a good man have servants ? " '
56227	56554	56216	56216	I	0	' Then , " I answered immediately , " why do you not speak the truth ? It is wrong to make believe that you could give me the things you said , when you had n't them . " He laughed a good deal before replying . " I did not say I had them , but that you might have them , my boy . However , let us leave this . I am going to propose something which I mean in earnest ; and I hope you will be a good boy and say yes where I want you to do so ? " He raised all manner of wild hopes within me . I looked at him with eager eyes ; I felt the tears coming into them ; and I could hardly see him for crying , as I said tremulously , " Will you take me to my father and mother ? " Such were the words in which my heart relieved its pent - up sorrow . At last the promise of Christmas Day was to be fulfilled . The home I longed for could not be all a dream . As though it were near at hand , hidden only by a curtain that instant to be drawn away , I divined its presence . Children on every side of me , though in want , though with scantiest raiment , and oftentimes only sleep to still their hunger , had love to keep them warm ; while I , poor outcast , was owned by none except for charity . Must not this unexpected friend , if he cared for me as he said , have brought the best of news ? Who was so wretched as to lack the love of kith and kin , save only me ? Shaken with childish sobbing , I repeated , " Take me to my father and mother ! " '
56609	56991	56602	56602	he	277	' The man seemed thunderstruck . He started violently , putting his hand to his heart as if he had been shot . " Your father and mother ? " he repeated with surprise ; " no , I can not take you to them . When or how did it come into your head that you could have any father and mother except these ? " and he pointed to the good old people who sat in anxious silence , waiting — as I have thought in later years when mediatating on the doings of that night — to be informed of things about which they had no more knowledge than I. The stranger turned to Mr. Mardol with a somewhat haughty gesture . " You do not instil into the boy , " he said , " I am sure you do not , idle fancies of this kind . Is it his way to talk of a possible father and mother ? " Mr. Mardol answered calmly , " I have told him that he is no child of mine , and there I have left the matter . Never until this evening did I hear him talk of his unknown parents . "—"Right , right , " said the stranger ; " you rebuke me . I know well that you have dealt with Ivor wisely , and have brought him up according to our agreement . " Then , falling to a steady perusal of my tear - stained countenance , he said in firm but gentle accents , " Ivor , you must put away impossible notions . To vex yourself about parents whom you have lost is foolish . It can bring you nothing but trouble . I am your guardian , although you have never seen me till now ; and Mr. and Mrs. Mardol , who have taken such care of you , will give you a home as long as you wish to stay with them . But you are called to a task , in which the ties of kindred would be simply a hindrance . You know in part what I mean . You have now to learn the rest . Can you attend while I am talking ? " '
57203	57240	57252	57252	he	1816	' I was again stirred to rebellion . " What have I to do with gentlemen ? " I cried . " I do not want to be a gentleman , but an engraver . " " '
57597	58139	57592	57592	you	0	' Might I come back afterwards to learn engraving ? " I would not give up what I so intensely delighted in . He assured me that such was his intention ; when I could go on with my studies by myself , I should return to Mr. Mardol 's workroom . If I showed no aptitude for Latin and Greek — but it could not be , I was too fond of modern languages , as he knew , not to feel interested in the ancient , which were so much nobler . The stranger talked more eloquently than even Mr. Ashwell ; and my ear detected , in his accent and choice of words , a refinement that in Mr. Ashwell it would have been vain to seek . He must belong , I fancied , to the washed and scented revolutionists , the less common sort , whose ranks he invited me to join . I did not feel reluctant if , in the end , I might become an engraver . At my age , it is true , three or four years seemed an eternity . What might not happen in them ? But I was told that the time would run by faster than I could imagine ; that it was really almost too short ; and that I should spend my holidays with Mr. and Mrs. Mardol . They acquiesced in the arrangement . And , though I shed tears at the thought of entering on a new world without guide or companion , what could I do but consent ? The stranger was affected on leaving me . He said I should see him again , but not until I had spent a term at school . And so the day was fixed , and he went out into the freezing weather of Christmas , to his carriage , I suppose , round the corner . I was glad to see him go . I spent the long hours of that night in feverish dreaming . All I had heard or imagined during the day came back , strangely confused , in sleep . I seemed to find in the wilderness my long - lost parents ; but while I clung about my mother 's knees with sobbing affection , or held forth my arms to clasp a father whose face I dimly discerned , the vision melted , and I was standing by an open tomb , wherein lay a dreadful shrouded figure . Bending over it , with sardonic joy in his looks , I beheld the stranger , and , on beholding him , fled . Ever and anon I awoke , crying bitterly , and the pillow wet with my tears . The night seemed as though it would never end . Time after time , with change of scene and attitude , the man that called himself my guardian came before me as the murderer of those I held dear . His icy breath froze the blood in my veins ; I shrank at his touch , but could neither escape nor resist him . His single face made my world and filled me with loathing and dismay . '
58277	58426	58441	58441	he	1845	' My first days at school ! ah me , how miserable they were ! Mr. Felton 's solicitor , who took me down from London , told me I should be homesick , but I must not mind , it would pass in a week or two . He little understood that the worst home - sickness is that of a child who has no home . If I felt lonely when Mr. and Mrs. Mardol took care of me , it was a thousand times worse here . I had the sense of a man with the tender heart of a child . My wretchedness was not the simple though piercing misery of a dog that has lost his master ; it was poisoned and made incurable by thought . I did not in any way resemble the ordinary English boy , to whom leaving his parents '
58586	58720	58723	58723	They	1853	' An unreal , a fantastic world , wilder than many dreams ! Here were five hundred boys , trained , as Mr. Ashwell , the eloquent stone - mason , said , to be slaves of an institution and to believe in worn - out lies . Not that their minds received any training ; it was only their characters that were moulded on a certain plan . I saw none with a love of learning ; enthusiasm was not scorned , for it did not exist within the school precincts . Masters and boys were immersed in routine ; and they had but one standard , of vague outline , but exceedingly definite in practice : they all aimed at being English gentlemen . This did not keep the boys from schoolboys '
58873	59115	58864	58864	I	0	' I could not help looking for a friend , but it was long ere I found one . What point of contact was there between me and all these boys ? They did not read ; they could talk only of trivial subjects . They knew nothing of the great causes about which men were contending . They had never been thrown upon the current of life . Their very sins against the moral law had less in them of the human being than of the unreasoning animal which fulfils its desires and has never heard of a law . Mr. Mardol spoke to me of the True , the Good , the Beautiful , the greatest happiness of the greatest number , the essential sacredness of duty , the wisdom of obeying the higher Nature which is eternal and unchangeable . Do not say that I could not understand . I did understand ; and the proof is that I put questions to which Mr. Mardol could not always find an answer . But that inability , so humbly confessed in the presence of a young child , did not abate the boundless reverence with which I listened . In my thoughts , he was the interpreter of Nature 's laws , the Orpheus by whose song my slumbering spirit was awakened . I obeyed him with utter submission , and the deepest feeling of my soul was reverence . '
59723	59934	59699	59700	Mr. Felton	353	' The boys were gentlemen in the making . With much that was agreeable , they had nothing that was pathetic about them . I could have liked one or another , as I might have been fond of a high - spirited , beautiful animal ; but how different was that affection from the heart - piercing pity , the unbounded tenderness , I had felt at the sight of my poor little neighbours , — children of my own age or younger , living on stinted fare , without amusements , without green fields or flowers , shivering in the cold , and trembling when the dark night came on because they had only one another 's company in the lonesome street,—forlorn , unfriended creatures , the recollection of whom makes my heart bleed even while I write , and tells me that this love trouble of mine is trifling indeed compared with the anguish that nightly haunts our cities . Be still , be still , spirit of compassion ! I will serve , I am serving in the army of the poor . Do not blind me with tears until I have written the memories that are to save me from degradation , from moral ruin . '
60126	60355	60121	60122	the burin	1887	' The time would not pass quickly . I counted all the days and all their hours , gaining relief only from my books , in which were things high and heroic , if I could have been taught them by men who had felt the heroism or aspired to the height . My evenings , too , when I could be alone , were spent in a pleasant occupation ; for I did not lay aside my pencil . But I must have broken down in health and spirits , or pleaded for release from captivity , but for one thing . Rupert came to be my friend . Rupert , not quite my own age , with his bright looks , ardent feelings , quick impulsive ways,—Rupert , versatile , affectionate , capable of anger and so ready to forgive and forget , sensitive , engaging,—what a change passed over my solitary life when he grew to be a part of it , when his sunshine brought out in the gray wintry landscape all manner of unexpected colouring , warm tints , and comfortable cheering prospects ! It was the love of drawing that occasioned our friendship ; but I should always have worshipped him , though in silence , for his nature , how different soever from mine , was essentially that of the artist .

60763	60815	60816	60816	I	0	' Only a boy 's friendship ? Ah , golden hours , full of life and wonder , when , like virgin - snow , the unsullied feelings took on them rosy tints , and sparkled and shone pure and bright under the great sun as it rose into the heavens ! '
61239	61736	61737	61737	I	0	' All too quickly now did the days fleet on , as they swept down the river of time . I counted them for the pleasure they had yet in store . Rupert , like myself , was an orphan ; he did not spend the holidays at home , but either in his guardian 's family or with friends to whom he was always welcome . With the courtesy of his class , he put no questions as to whence I came . I gave him to understand that I had lost my parents ; that my name was not my own ; and that I was not going to a university like most of our companions , or , like himself , on the Continent to study . He never said , " What , then , do you propose to do ? " But he entreated me to take him for my brother in heart and soul . I promised , and I have kept my promise . The strange thing was that I loved him so well , and felt in such a heavenly new world when he was by , that I did not remember one of the controverted points on which I ought to have examined him . I did not ask him to accept Democracy , or vegetarianism ( which latter , from necessity , I had been compelled at school to surrender ) , or the hatred of city - life , or the worship of Nature . He was gentle to every one ; he could not be hard - hearted when he stooped to care for me . But I thought neither of my old associates nor of the questions they were agitating as I looked at his dear face and walked by his side . Long after I came upon the magnificent saying of Novalis , " Were there only two lovers in the universe , " and so on . How deep it went into me ! I remembered the time when , for Rupert and me , there were only two lovers — we two , in all the world , and we wandered as in a happy dream . Life could have no problems for us ; we desired nothing save that our dream might never end . Does the secret of regeneration lie there for these half - dead institutions ? Is love the last word in the development of the race , as it surely is in that of the individual ? But men do not understand . They have so little inspiration , so universal a sense of distrust . They are cautious , and therefore cold . They pretend to be guided by justice , by an abstract formal balancing of mine and thine , which speedily becomes injustice when the stronger holds the scales . The universal makeweight , I perceive , is the sword of Brennus . '
61967	62488	61950	61950	He	353	' I can see now that the experiment of school had its dangers . However , it succeeded . Much as I loved Rupert , I was not tempted to prefer the English gentleman 's view of things either to Plutarch or to Plato . These boys were Macedonians , not Greeks . It might have been difficult to climb from their level to the higher doctrines ; but the only change for me would have been a descent , and that in the region of the intellect I hold to be impossible . I am yet convinced that English life is founded on chimæras . Its rank , respectability , wealth , and religion are phantoms , not realities . Mr. Mardol , who had none of these , was superior beyond comparison to the teachers at whose feet I was sitting . For I was astonished , and have since been amused , on finding that Mr. Mardol applied a religious standard , and made me do so too , where these nominal Christians dreamt only of their conventions . At school I kept my feelings on this and the like matters to myself ; even Rupert did not know them . The conformity expected of me was by no means troublesome . Nobody asked whether I thought of eternal realities , or believed in them . I went to chapel like the rest ; unlike the rest , I listened to sermons which , in their complacent dulness had a grotesque charm for one to whom the manliest popular speaking in London was accessible and long had been so . I was much too young to analyse , but perfectly capable of feeling the difference . I heard the preacher in the pulpit tamely rehearse , for the hundredth time , a gospel which was not so real to him as to me were the figures of the heathen mythology in his everyday lessons . I knew the poetical worth and grandeur of Apollo ; he did not know the historical worth or grandeur of his Christ . Therefore , he droned out a burden of so - called saving articles and went his way , satisfied to have spoken what he had spoken before , any time these twenty years . Of religion he knew nothing . On the other hand , my friend Mr. Ashwell , the eloquent stone - mason , rugged as he was in speech and bearing , insisted on a creed for which he would have laid down his life , or taken that of any preacher — a creed which absorbed his being and filled his daily thoughts , shining out to him as the certain salvation of mankind . Now , Mr. Ashwell did not stand alone . I knew a multitude of others , equally convinced and eager to spread their teaching , though not so eloquent . The old religion , as seen at school , seemed to me an effete babbler on Sundays , and no better than a forgotten corpse the rest of the week . '
62489	62655	61950	61950	He	353	' But , Ivor , you reason more than enough . Go on with your story . You left school as you came , a revolutionist ; you corresponded with Rupert ; you saw Mr. Felton once in a way and satisfied him that you were striving to unite the noble past of mankind with as noble a future ; you earned your bread honestly , and repaid Mr. and Mrs. Mardol 's affection by tending them in their old days and closing their eyes when the hour struck . You laboured in the cause , and did not abandon it in the pursuit of worldly phantoms ; you fell in love neither with rank , nor with riches , nor with respectability . You were loyal and true until a certain morning , when , as you gazed foolishly into a beautiful face , your beliefs and principles melted like frostwork in the sun ; and you fell in love with Lady May Davenant . '
62656	63246	63247	63247	He	1914	' Ah , spare me , stern monitor ! I will confess and have done with it . Yes , it is too true . Convinced that I had nothing to fear from love , that Rupert 's friendship left no room for it , I came into the neighbourhood of fire and was scorched before I knew . Pity and pardon my inexperience . How could I anticipate that feelings which had never shown a sign of existence would leap out of the soil , full - armed and mature , at the glance of a woman which meant nothing for me and yet was infinitely captivating ? But is it not shameful that I waited to catch the plague until I had left my work - a - day world and was admitted within this high - born circle ? Could I never , then , have fallen in love with a mechanic 's daughter ? I never did , nor thought of such a thing . It is only , I suppose , King Cophetua that weds the beggar maid , not a man whose rank is about equal to her father 's . I have seen beautiful , though ragged , damsels in the haunts of the poor ; could I have asked one of them to share my affection ? Not I. Cophetua had a greater mind than the engraver 's apprentice . Or was it that I sought a companion who would understand me and be my radiant polar star in what I dreamt of achieving ? That may be the explanation . May Davenant has , I think , the heart of a woman and the mind of a man . I like her resolute bearing , the proud carriage of her body and straightforward look , the cordial grasp of her hand . Then how abashed she can suddenly seem , eyes cast down and the colour mounting , as if in the midst of her imperious strength she remembered that she was a maiden and therefore needed a stronger arm . I beheld in her a highly - cultivated yet unspoilt nature , the finest breeding combined with as fine a play of impulse and passion,—no wonder I began to think there might be happiness in love . Let it serve for my exculpation . No , she would not dream of marrying beneath her , as the world calls it . For me she cares not at all . When I talk she looks at me with undaunted eyes ; it is only while she is talking herself , or Lord Trelingham interposes , or Rupert throws in a hasty word , that the fit of blushing comes upon her . To indulge an affection like this would be chasing the rainbow . It may be difficult to renounce ; but , Ivor , confess that it is impossible to attain . Some other man will appear to make her happy , if he has not come already . Her gratitude for the restoration of the canvas may give you a place in her memory among carpenters and drawing - masters . You will bid the Hermitage farewell , go back to the mighty prison of London , live where no great lady comes or would venture her dainty footstep , and find in Rupert all the joy that affection is to bestow on you . Good - bye , Lady May ; the rainbow has melted into mist . '
63357	63363	63364	63364	he	1914	' The fire is out , '
63373	63395	63364	63364	he	1914	' and so is my love for May Davenant . Each has done its work . What more do I want ? '
63418	63440	63441	63441	He	1914	' What is love but a handful of dry heather , set on fire and cast into the waters of death . '
64335	64343	64344	64344	he	277	' Cast a line into the waters , '
64446	64550	64571	64571	you	250	' Thus Ivor explained the final cause of fly - fishing ; not to catch trout for supper , but to get back the lost sense of Paradise and be one again with the spirit of the watery realms from which , some forgotten morning millions of years ago , the first amphibian crept daringly on land . He said , now and then , to his scientific friends that while he agreed with them in going forward , he thought it would be fatal to man 's happiness if he did not go backward too . In his metaphorical way he added , '
64598	64673	64674	64674	Man	6250	' His friends looked gravely at him and did not smile . They thought it more respectable to say as little as might be of the amphibian now he had become such a distant relative . But these were chamber - philosophers , not students in the open air . They little understood what a revolution is preparing for their science , as well as for the political systems against which they are contending . '
64680	64684	64674	64674	Man	6250	' said Ivor , '
64702	66426	64687	64687	he	6250	' Thus Ivor gained a second friend , to whom , after Rupert , he cleaved with his whole heart . They had in common a deep sense of enjoyment and freedom in the open air , and the unconscious poetry that lingers about the sedges by the river . Perhaps there was something else that bound them — an innocent mind , a pure and simple heart ; for they were both unworldly . Tom could understand where he could not speak , and he grew greatly attached to the stranger . He consulted him on other things besides fishing : what he ought to do at Foxholme , whether he could look after his tenants without doing more harm than good , and kindred subjects on which he would never have spoken to Lord Trelingham . Would Ivor come and stay with him after he was twenty - one ? Ivor smiled , but made no promises . He was not his own master , he said . Their intimacy delighted Glanville , surprised but did not displease the Earl , and slightly amused Lady May. In the bosom of the Countess it excited some innocent wonder . She neither liked nor disliked Mr. Mardol ; to her he was a species of inferior artist , who came about the place as other men did to put up stained - glass or æsthetic woodwork . She wished he would not persuade Tom to go fishing so often , or spend the time after dinner out of doors . It was stupid when Tom came in merely to dine , and to stroll about afterwards with a male companion instead of staying to be worshipped in the drawing - room . For herself , she had made several flying visits to town , and meant , after Tom 's birthday , to spend a season in Paris . But she could not forego the opportunities of seeing him which Trelingham afforded . It was her second home , and she would stay until the young man went . Thus eagles , wrens , and turtledoves reason , after their kind . Glanville , meanwhile , was falling into a mesmeric sleep . He had no defence against the sorceries of Lady May , no other love to resist an ardent nature bent on making him its own . He felt the pressure of an invisible hand , silently but surely compelling him to his knees . He could not pretend indifference to Lady May. The strange fierce beauty of her character excited him . Her conversation was singularly animated ; her voice had charmed him from the first ; and the loneliness of her position appeared to him deserving of the sincerest pity . She spoke of the great relatives with whom she had passed her time during her mother 's frequent illnesses . Among them all she had not one friend . Little by little she told Rupert all she dared . He saw more clearly than she did the peril of these confidential dialogues . But it was hard not to return her confidence and treat her as an intimate friend who would be delighted to know all about him . When the conversation was over he regretted that it had begun ; he accused himself of sentimentality , of being led away by his feelings , and indulging in what the French call effusion . Nevertheless , a morning seldom ended before Lady May had taken up the thread of sentiment again , while appearing to be merely absorbed or unhappy , and Glanville had suffered another of the silken meshes to be woven about him . Now he was under the enchanter 's spell ; he fancied he could move when he desired , that he had only to will ; and he was forgetting that to will under certain circumstances is the whole , but an insuperable , difficulty . A single word would break the spell ; but how was he to utter it ? On the contrary , he began whispering to himself that such confidences were very pleasant ; that he knew where to stop ; that there was no reason why he should not be Lady May 's best friend ; that he had not thought she could be so fascinating ; that if he did care a great deal for her it would do no harm ; that — he woke up one morning with something like a guilty conscience and began to deliberate whether he could stay at the Court and not ask Lord Trelingham to consent to their marriage . Was he so sure , then , of the lady 's consent ? He was no coxcomb ; and yet he was sure . By a thousand tokens May Davenant had convinced him that he was the most interesting man she had met . To confess it in direct terms was neither possible , nor becoming , nor necessary . He knew it . Even now he did not say to himself that she was in love with him ; but he felt no anxiety . The question he had asked in his own mind , as he walked up and down the front terrace on a certain afternoon , seemed now to have an answer . Could he live without one who captivated his feelings , who would be happy to share his life , who was capable of splendid enthusiasm ? Her position might demand an alliance with rank ; but her extraordinary gifts made her worthy to be the helpmate of genius . Glanville did not speak much that morning ; but he looked often at Lady May , and the glance of soft inquiring meditation , which had never before lighted on her , stirred her heart with an expectant thrill . She could not meet his eyes , but a gentle blush , a sense of overwhelming diffidence , which gave to her motions a distracted and yet not ungraceful hesitation , betokened that love , waiting so long for a response , was now certain that it would not be withheld . The morning was still and autumnal ; but in Lady May 's heart rose the delicious feeling of spring . She was no longer miserable ; the clouds were dispersing , and the sun was coming out . She felt that love was answering love ; and while her own was intensified , it was humbled too . Had she done that which was unmaidenly ? had there been a lack of reticence , a boldness in speaking of what she had thought and suffered ? She hoped not ; she trusted not . But all would be well now . These first green buds were like the promise of a glorious summer ; they gave her inexpressible delight . Nor was Glanville quite destitute of similar feelings . He knew that she was pleased and happy ; confidence between them seemed natural enough now , and he was sure it would last . He did not think Lord Trelingham could resist an only daughter 's wishes . His own success had been too brilliant and unmistakable to allow of the difficulties being raised which are commonly brought forward in such cases . He would finish the Madonna of the Seraphim before taking any step . There must be no chance of an abrupt termination to the task he had begun . But , on the day after he had restored the picture , he would demand the hand of Lady May. That , and that alone , should be his recompense . Nor would he give occasion to malice by attempting to gain the lady 's consent before her father 's . It should not be said of him that he had taken the Earl at a disadvantage . Had his affection been as strong as he imagined perhaps he had not behaved so punctiliously ; he might have found himself saying more than he intended , and betraying a secret that lovers can not easily keep . Anyhow , he resolved to wait . The last sitting was over . Glanville , thinking himself much enamoured of the lady , paid her no compliments ; but , with the delicate flattery of the artist , spoke of the expression , temper , and make of soul which went with this or that detail in the copy he was taking from nature . He felt satisfied that the task was done , and , as he thought , not unworthily . There remained the more difficult enterprise , to transfer the features of Lady May to the original canvas , now set up at the end of the gallery and waiting the master 's touch . Curtains drawn round it concealed from profane eyes the havoc that remained , though Ivor had smoothed away crease and hollow , making , by the aid of some secret in alchemy , a restoration so perfect that the Earl wondered and Glanville was astounded . The engraver would not allow any one else to view his triumph . He insisted , mildly , but with the authority of a benefactor , on hiding the Madonna of the Seraphim in a kind of artist 's sanctuary until it shone out in splendour as before the morning it was ruined . Glanville agreed , and , as he could not execute what amounted to a tour de force in the light - handed way he had taken with Lady May 's portrait , it was resolved that the gallery should remain open , but the farther end be cut off and fitted up as a studio , where Rupert , assisted by his friend , might work unhindered . With a mixture of pain and expectation , Lady May rose for the last time from the chair in which she had sat and dreamt over her life during all those mornings . She put away the heavy crimson dress , sighing as she did so , and wondering whether the Madonna of the Seraphim would become to her an intolerable memory or , as Dante sings , '
66436	66549	64687	64687	he	6250	' The tremendous inward conflict , the intense longing and ardour of resolution had left her exhausted , like a medium who has with difficulty succeeded in mesmerising a reluctant will . And was she successful ? She did not know . Rupert 's countenance told her so little . She saw him vanish with her portrait behind the voluminous curtains of his improvised studio ; and she walked slowly away , feeling like one that has witnessed the fourth act of a tragedy and is uncertain how the fifth will turn out . Alas that the tragedy was her own ! She was expectant , not sanguine . It was part of '
66555	68350	64687	64687	he	6250	' that she anticipated on the day when the picture was restored the dénouement of these most wretched uncertainties . She must live through the interval as she could . It was not easy . Passion is one of the sleepless gods ; it watched by her day and night , banished repose from her pillow , took the colour from her cheek , steeped her very music in bitterness , languor , and excitement , in delirious joy and quickly succeeding pain . She had been , in earlier times , a bold horsewoman , somewhat to the scandal of Lord Trelingham 's acquaintance , but it was an exercise she had forsworn and she would not return to it . Had the chalet been untenanted she might have spent her worst hours there , unobserved by the guests who were constantly coming and going at the Court . But now she felt like a wounded animal that has no place to creep into . She knew not what to anticipate nor how she should act . There was , in the whole world , no single creature with whom she could take counsel ; and the gnawing pain at her heart grew , until she feared in a sudden frenzy of the nerves to betray her secret and be disgraced for ever . Day after day she wandered about the beach , choosing the most lonely situations and walking on and on wherever the strip of sand was wide enough to leave a passage at the foot of the cliffs . She was not much the better for it all ; her sleep after such prolonged exertion was broken and feverish . She seemed to be living on wild hopes which would not bear examination . Now and then a passing look , a word from Glanville revived her . But that was little enough , and there was nothing else . At length the decisive morning came , towards the end of October , when the still air seems tranquil , not melancholy , and there are frequent gleams of sunshine . Glanville had been absorbed in his work , not allowing himself a moment 's leisure while daylight lasted . He could think of nothing else . All the airy shapes that filled his imagination had taken wings ; he forgot even the motive with which an artist is commonly credited — the love of fame . One purpose took possession of him — to make this picture as perfect as he might ; to enter into the heart of that dead Friar who had painted it and wrest from him the secret of its loveliness . He felt that to restore was , in this instance , to create anew . Rupert had learnt when he was very young , what many artists have not discovered when they lay down their pencil,—at twenty he said to himself that the painter who has not lived in his picture will never make it live to others ; that drawing and colouring are the hands , but imagination is the eye and the soul . In delineating the countenance of May Davenant he had seen only the lady before him ; in reproducing it he forgot her , and in spirit went back to the world of religious types and ecstatic imaginations wherein Fray Raimondo had beheld the Virgin of the Seraphim ere he depicted her to others . The enthusiasm which dominated Glanville was not love ; it was antagonistic to love ; but he might have made to Lady May the excuse which Andrea del Sarto offered to his angry wife — that he forgot her for herself . There was no room then for a double worship ; he was living , contemplating , loving with Fray Raimondo , two centuries ago , in a southern land and among a medieval populace . There are dramatic painters no less than dramatic poets , men who throw themselves into a mood , a character , a whole epoch , with such intense realisation that the feelings spring up in them which correspond with the scene they are describing , and out of that vivid illusion they extract truth and summon the past from its grave . When the short afternoon compelled him regretfully to put down his brushes , he still went on dreaming of San Lucar and the monk in his cell , with the golden vision steadfast above him . This man of the world became a child , a mortified recluse , a seer at the gate of heaven ; for the time being he was neither sarcastic nor melancholy . He would not have chosen the subject ; he painted no Madonnas of his own accord ; but since it was given to him , the instinct which made him an artist impelled him to obey the law of inspiration whereby he had succeeded hitherto . None but Ivor Mardol saw the work advance . The friends were much together and communicative as usual on the points raised in its execution . But on other things they were silent . Each had a secret of his own which concerned Lady May , and neither could utter it . Glanville , indeed , looked forward to the marriage on which he had , I will not say set his hopes , but made up his mind . Yet he was no more excited when he thought of it than if some one had told him that there would be rain in the evening . Had he cared half as much as the lady who was waiting breathlessly for the fifth act to commence , he would have found his tongue , and surprised Ivor with his eloquence . Then , too , he might have seen into the bosom of his friend , whose thwarted affection , purifying itself like an ascending flame , was not to be quenched , but transformed into the rarest sentiment of chivalry . Ivor was more tender than passionate ; the pity which was almost born with him coloured his every feeling , even that friendship for Rupert , wherein pity might have seemed to find no place . Much more did it warm and melt his being when the haggard looks of Lady May told him , the most observant and most unobtrusive of spectators , that she was suffering . It was a feeling which softened his disappointment and took away the eagerness that , under other circumstances , would have prompted him to pour his confidences into the ear of Rupert . A necessary reserve grew up between them , not weakening their affection , but marking another stage in the friendship which had united them . It was destined to exert a momentous influence on their lives when the threads had grown more entangled . So the morning arrived , bright and clear , on which Glanville proposed to unveil the Madonna of the Seraphim . There were no strangers in the house except himself and Ivor , both of whom had by this time a false air , as the French say , of belonging to the domain . Even Mr. Truscombe had not been invited . Lord Trelingham , in his rare visits to the gallery , chiefly during the earlier sittings , had made various suggestions with regard to the tone and expression of the vanished countenance . His memory for technical details and accessories was excellent , and , thanks to it , Glanville had reproduced the style , if not the actual peculiarities , of ornament and setting . The Earl would not interrupt him while engaged on the picture itself ; but he came when Glanville was not working , marked the changes that he judged indispensable , and offered his advice with the respect due to a great artist . It was generally to the purpose ; nor did Rupert pique himself on knowing the original better than those who had seen it . When the last colour was laid on , Lord Trelingham took what he called a private view and came away delighted . The painting was hung in its former place , the purple veil , which still had Lady Elizabeth 's name upon it , was drawn in front ; and on the pleasant forenoon of the day appointed the little family group stood before it in expectation . Rupert was still in the enthusiastic mood of Fray Raimondo ; only by an effort could he remember that he had promised himself a reward which to - morrow he must demand or renounce for ever . Lady May superstitiously expected to read her fate in the unveiled picture ; and Tom and the Countess , who were standing side by side , the least concerned of all , felt vaguely that an atmosphere of unrest surrounded them . Karina had not discovered Lady May 's secret ; she fancied more than she knew ; while of Glanville she could make nothing whatever . His mind was a sealed volume which required a mightier spell than hers to unlock it . She whispered to her cousin that there ought to be an overture before the curtain drew up ; but Lady May did not answer . The Earl looked graver than usual , for he was thinking of that other morning , when the young Alice and Edgar Valence exchanged , in the presence of this same Madonna , the pledges that had bereft him of a friend and a sister . His eyes turned more than once towards Lady May , inquiringly , anxiously , as if he were struck with her resemblance to her unhappy aunt . There was no overture , nor was any needed . When Ivor drew aside the veil a sight as beautiful as ever graced the eyes of mortals broke upon them . The picture , as they remembered it after the storm , was blurred in a hundred places , and the countenance of the Virgin had disappeared under dust and defilement . But now ! It was a new creation . The seal of age could not remain intact ; fresh colours , though exquisitely blent with the old , took something of its two centuries from the painting . But there was no crudeness , no offensive novelty ; a light and delicate touch had given radiance to what was dim and effect to what was faded . The splendour of the vision came back , the heavenly dyes of angelic raiment , the brightness of the martyrs '

68762	68801	68759	68759	she	244	' he could have painted no Madonna . I am only fit to be the type of a different woman — a sinful , ambitious , despairing creature , for whom heaven and its glory are a legend . '
70354	70362	70342	70342	He	242	' the shining levels of the lake . '
70654	70657	70659	70659	Glanville	242	' Well , '
70661	70695	70659	70659	Glanville	242	' here is proof positive that the prehistoric has been in the land , or , to speak more accurately , on the water . I must really try my hand at this . '
70785	70795	70796	70796	he	242	' Then Ivor is at home , after all , '
70801	70836	70796	70796	he	242	' but why did he come round to this side ? Has he been exploring in the wood like me ? And if he has , why did I not hear or see him ? '
70857	70862	70854	70854	he	242	' Ivor , Ivor ! '
71167	71183	71164	71164	she	722	' Are you the tenant of the chalet ? And must I ask your pardon ? '
71184	71209	71164	71164	she	722	' The tenant ? No ; really I — my friend Mr. Mardol — I was expecting to find him ; is there any — '
71268	71271	71272	71272	she	723	' Then , '
71275	71325	71272	71272	she	723	' you do not live here . I was afraid'—she did not look in any way afraid , and I can not believe she was , although she said so—'I was afraid it might be like the fairy tale , and that one of the bears was coming home . '
71326	71340	71341	71341	He	242	' The bears — the fairy tale ? I do not understand you . '
71356	71363	71364	71364	she	723	' If you are a stranger , '
71367	71400	71401	71401	she	723	' and not master of the chalet , you will allow me to take my leave before any one comes . You appear not to know a great deal about fairy tales , '
71411	71448	71449	71449	she	723	' but I have no time to explain . I ought to go before the bears catch me . There is no saying whether they would take me for their sister . Some of them ought , '
71453	71458	71460	71460	Rupert	242	' If you mean , '
71475	71524	71460	71460	Rupert	242	' that you do not wish to meet any of Lord Trelingham 's family , I think I can assure you that they are not likely to visit the Hermitage at this hour . It is my friend , Mr. Ivor Mardol , who lives here just now . '
71562	71574	71559	71559	she	723	' And is your friend a relative of Lord Trelingham 's ? '
71575	71580	71582	71582	Rupert	242	' Not at all , '
71584	71600	71582	71582	Rupert	242	' he is an artist , like myself , who happens to be staying here . '
71601	71614	71615	71615	She	723	' And who is painting Lady May 's portrait , I suppose . '
71629	71632	71634	71634	he	242	' No , '
71642	71662	71634	71634	he	242	' I am painting the portrait . I should rather use the past tense , for it is finished . '
71663	71674	71675	71675	she	723	' Then you are Mr. Glanville , the other artist , '
71678	71699	71675	71675	she	723	' I heard my father speak of you . But I did not know there were two artists at Trelingham . '
71705	71709	71710	71710	he	242	' Mr. Mardol , '
71713	71736	71710	71710	he	242	' is more properly an engraver , not an artist . But may I inquire who it was that spoke of me ? '
71737	71741	71742	71742	she	723	' My father , '
71745	71793	71742	71742	she	723	' Colonel Valence . Did you not meet him in Trelingham churchyard the afternoon of the great storm ? He told me that you had had some conversation in the porch while it thundered and lightened . He mentioned your name several times before he went away . '
71855	71861	71862	71862	he	242	' Has Colonel Valence gone ? '
71865	71922	71862	71862	he	242	' I should have liked — I was hoping to meet him again . Our conversation was so extraordinary that I did not know what to make of it , and it has puzzled me ever since . But I beg your pardon , Miss Valence . It is impertinent of me to say all this . '
71923	71928	71929	71929	she	722	' Why , no , '
71932	71959	71929	71929	she	722	' not if I could tell you what my father meant , as I daresay would not be impossible . He shares his thoughts with me . '
71960	71967	71971	71971	himself	368	' Shares his thoughts with her ! '
71973	71983	71969	71969	Glanvile	368	' how many of his thoughts , I wonder ? '
72022	72033	72034	72034	he	368	' Some of Colonel Valence 's thoughts are very stern , '
72038	72050	72034	72034	he	368	' Too stern , indeed,'answered the young lady with a sigh . '
72103	72132	72134	72134	you	0	' She spoke with calmness and decision , looking as childlike now in her serious utterances as when she was alluding to the bears and the fairy tale . '
72143	72161	72134	72134	you	0	' he asked , with some astonishment in his tone , which Miss Valence 's ear detected . '
72166	72167	72134	72134	you	0	' '
72172	72176	72169	72169	I	0	' she answered . '
72266	72275	72249	72249	He	5872	' Rupert was struck with a sudden thought . '
72291	72413	72418	72418	he	2057	' he inquired . It occurred to him that Colonel Valence would wish to be informed of the accident to his Madonna . And what if he would , Rupert ? do you think that a sufficient excuse for renewing your acquaintance with him , or for combating his philosophy , and looking at your ease on the countenance of this young lady while you do so ? Oh no ; it was nothing so hypocritical . Of course not . But if the Colonel had endured such hardships to bring the picture from Spain , it would be only charitable to tell him about it . In the last few moments he had become more amiable in Glanville 's eyes . '
72421	72425	72418	72418	he	2057	' she replied . '
72453	72454	72445	72445	He	2057	' '
72460	72510	72457	72457	your	0	' Rupert did not reflect how he was violating all the proprieties . How dared he be so inquisitive ? I wonder Miss Valence was not offended . But she seemed not to mind . Instead of at once insisting on being taken to her boat , she answered : '
72529	72530	72524	72525	my mother	6777	' '
72539	72548	72534	72535	Lady Alice	275	' exclaimed Rupert , completely off his guard . '
72558	72559	72560	72561	Lady Alice	275	' '
72567	72572	72573	72573	she	275	' she answered quietly ; '
72581	72582	72573	72573	she	275	' '
72590	72594	72584	72584	she	275	' said Glanville . '
72607	72608	72598	72599	Colonel Valence	274	' '
72611	72615	72616	72616	he	274	' she replied ; '
72632	72637	72624	72624	you	274	' she went on . '
72641	72645	72624	72624	you	274	' he said , '
72689	72690	72624	72624	you	274	' '
72698	72702	72624	72624	you	274	' she answered . '
72772	72773	72755	72755	He	5872	' '
72782	72783	72776	72777	Lady Alice	275	' '
72859	73319	73321	73321	you	2085	' Glanville thought , while she spoke , what a striking contrast they would make . Lady May , although not taller than the average , had a stateliness of manner which seemed to add to her height ; she was dark and almost foreign - looking with her great piercing eyes , long eyelashes , and , as the poets say in describing this type of beauty , her ebon tresses , that naturally suggested a crown or a chaplet of purple flowers to set them off . She moved slowly , and had nothing of the tripping fairy in her motions . The expression of her countenance was earnest and impassioned . And what was Colonel Valence 's daughter like ? Rupert found it necessary to study her features with great attention ; he might be asked some day to paint her portrait ; or what if he sketched it from memory when he went home , and laid it up in his portfolio ? There could be no harm in doing that . He wondered , by the way , what her name was . How could he find out without appearing over - curious ? Hers was a slender form , graceful as Arethusa 's , or the mountain - nymph 's whose home is among rocks and streams , where all day long she roams , climbing , or springing , or dancing , as best pleases her , seldom quiet except when she has tired herself out with play . Her countenance was clear and well - cut , of that exquisite pale olive which is the least English of tones , resembling fine ivory . And those innocent brown eyes , how softly they gazed at the audacious painter ! how tender and steadfast was their expression ! They had caught a golden - tawny hue from the ringlets of sunny hair falling about her face , among which the breeze coming in at the open window played wantonly . Such a combination of light and dark in the human countenance he had never beheld . The exquisite shape might be matched , perhaps , did he know where to look for it , in sylph or fairy . But could sylph or fairy boast of that serious , calm , aerial loveliness which shone out , so young and so unconscious , from the pale ivory features and the soft eyes ? Not knowing what had been said or what he was saying , Rupert drew a step nearer , and in a beseeching voice , as if he must fall on his knee and worship whilst he spoke , the words came from his lips in a half - whisper , '
73347	73385	73386	73386	Sir	5663	' The lady blushed almost scarlet now . Her pale cheek showed a deep , passionate tinge , and even her forehead was dyed in a faint rose - colour , which grew purple as she answered : '
73392	73406	73390	73390	you	5663	' She had got no further when she saw Rupert at her feet . '
73412	73416	73390	73390	you	5663	' he said ; '
73439	73503	73433	73433	I	0	' There was something in his tone which melted her . No , he had not meant to offend ; he was only overcome , fascinated , out of himself . How is it that love reveals its presence ? She could not speak for a moment ; and her voice when it came back was , like Rupert 's , almost inarticulate . '
73506	73510	73433	73433	I	0	' she said ; '
73516	73546	73433	73433	I	0	' And as he stood before her , ashamed , penitent , his eyes seeking the ground , she went on , not looking at him—'My name is Hippolyta . '
73547	73550	73551	73551	he	0	' Ah , '
73557	73577	73551	73551	he	0	' I knew you came out of A Midsummer Night 's Dream . Titania should be jealous of you . '
73578	73583	73584	73584	she	2088	' Again , sir ! '
73592	73600	73601	73601	She	2088	' stand aside and let me pass . '
73623	73628	73629	73629	he	0	' Not like that , '
73632	73672	73629	73629	he	0	' Oh , not like that . What shall I do if you go away despising me ? I am mad ; I have lost my senses . But I will not , I will not offend any more . '
73830	73834	73835	73835	he	0	' Miss Valence , '
73839	73876	73835	73835	he	0	' this small boat is not safe in such stormy weather . Will you allow me to fetch the larger one , which is lying in the boathouse opposite , and to row you to shore ? '
73877	73883	73884	73884	she	2088	' I will allow nothing , '
73887	73902	73884	73884	she	2088	' I did wrong to come here . Let me pass into the boat . '
73935	73980	73915	73915	He	242	' I can not let you risk your life , Miss Valence . If you will not wait till I can bring the safer boat you must allow me to take charge of this . A very few minutes will see you on shore . '
74120	74126	74127	74127	he	242	' I beg your pardon , '
74193	74249	74182	74182	she	372	' I came out of childish curiosity , and — and I have been punished . Tell Lord Trelingham , if you please , that I wanted to see the chalet , that I did not know — and I had never seen it , and my father said ... but it does not matter . '
74300	74312	74313	74313	he	242	' I would give my life that this had not happened , '
74316	74354	74355	74355	he	242	' Miss Valence , I implore you , think no more of it . Indeed , indeed , I meant no harm . I was beside myself . Can not you forgive one who has never seen — '
75289	75294	75295	75295	he	242	' Hippolyta , Hippolyta , '
75300	75317	75295	75295	he	242	' Oh , senseless Rupert , did you think the wedding could be without the wooing ? '
75329	75333	75334	75334	he	242	' And yet , '
75338	75352	75334	75334	he	242	' she ought to have known that I meant only to worship her . '
75368	75399	75400	75400	He	242	' How could she have known what I meant ? She had never set eyes on me . Are my looks so innocent as hers ? Childlike , divine Hippolyta ! '
76380	76394	76395	76395	He	242	' Mr. Glanville , are you here ? What has happened to you ? '
76566	76574	76548	76548	He	242	' I must have lost my way . '
76614	76622	76624	76624	Hippolyta	367	' If you were going to Trelingham , '
76626	76648	76624	76624	Hippolyta	367	' you have certainly lost it . The Court is sixteen miles off , and in the opposite direction to this . '
76655	76667	76668	76668	he	242	' I am much obliged for the information , Miss Valence , '
76675	76699	76668	76668	he	242	' and shall be grateful if you can point out the road . I have never been in this part of the country . '
76700	76706	76707	76707	she	723	' There is no road , '
76711	76744	76707	76707	she	723	' you are on the moor . And , if there were , you could not walk sixteen miles before nightfall . The sun will be down in less than an hour . '
76745	76751	76753	76753	Glanville	242	' I must get back , '
76843	76852	76853	76853	she	723	' You can not get back this way , '
76856	76910	76911	76911	she	723	' nor is it the slightest use ot attempt it . You would be lost in the mosses which you have passed without seeing them , I suppose . But Falside is hardly a mile off , and you can there be put on the right road . Do come , Mr. Glanville , '
76940	76945	76946	76946	he	242	' I will come , '
76949	76958	76959	76959	he	242	' if you can forgive me . Not , '
76962	77001	76959	76959	he	242	' that you ought . I know I am inexcusable . But , if you will not overlook my great fault , I must stay here until morning . I can make my way back in the light . '
77002	77015	77017	77017	Hippolyta	367	' Stay until morning , and be frozen ! No , indeed , '
77019	77040	77041	77041	She	723	' that you shall not . Come now , show that you know how to be obedient to a lady . '
77054	77076	77041	77041	She	723	' I do forgive you . Artists are strange people . One can not treat them like the rest of mankind . '
77077	77082	77084	77084	Rupert	242	' You forgive me ! '
77086	77098	77099	77099	She	723	' I will follow you to the end of the world . '
77106	77113	77114	77114	she	723	' No , only to Falside , '
77394	77421	77389	77389	he	242	' Why not ? let us go by all means . We shall perhaps find the golden cup the children talk of now we are together . '
77464	77469	77470	77470	she	367	' No , Djalma , '
77473	77512	77513	77513	she	367	' you must be patient . Mr. Glanville would not care to keep up with you at a trot after his day 's expedition . We shall cross your old friend , the Yale , in a minute , '
77521	77541	77513	77513	she	367	' It rises a little way off , and comes down into our valley on its journey to Trelingham . '
77644	77778	77638	77638	they	2169	' slow riding upon another road , not so broad as the first , which , turning very abruptly , brought them to a garden - gate overshadowed with foliage . Rupert ran to open the gate . He could see only a short distance in front , for the trees overarched and came down so close that it seemed as if they were entering another wood . But soon they reached a second entrance , clear of trees , and flanked on either side by a low wall , which permitted a view into the valley and across to the neighbouring heights . It was a ravine , at the head of which , on a projecting terrace near the waterfall , rose in picturesque beauty the gables of a double cottage . '
77783	77792	77638	77638	they	2169	' said Hippolyta , pointing with her whip . '
77800	77823	77797	77798	Mr. Glanville	242	' She did not wait for his thanks or his assistance , but dismounting and throwing him the reins , she added , '
77837	78101	77825	77825	you	242	' Saying which she went rapidly up the path and disappeared round a corner of the cottage . If Rupert could have made sure of being unobserved , I think he too would have put his arm round the pony 's neck and saluted him on the forehead . But he was prudent . No more risks through excess of demonstration for him . Djalma , therefore , had to be content with much patting and caressing , which , like all beings accustomed to adoration , he took as a matter of course . He was wondering when the groom would come , and not attending to Rupert at all . When the groom did arrive he was by no means of that spruce description which is usual in great English houses like Trelingham Court . He was an old man with white hair and an exceedingly wrinkled forehead , dressed in plain rough clothes , more suitable to a gardener or man - of - all - work than to the guardian of so beautiful and well - kept a steed as Djalma . His eyes , which were very dark and glittering , made it clear that he was some kind of foreigner , to say nothing of the expressive gesture , indicating a doubt or a question , as Rupert fancied , with which on seeing the artist he turned to Miss Valence . She merely shook her head and bade Rupert relinquish the reins , which he did unwillingly , as one that gives up a beloved charge . '
78104	78108	78110	78110	you	2174	' said Hippolyta , '
78149	78176	78141	78141	you	2174	' Rupert obeyed , not being clear in his own mind as to what was proper or becoming . He said when they passed the threshold , '
78216	78217	78202	78202	you	2174	' '
78226	78230	78202	78202	you	2174	' answered Hippolyta , '
78257	78290	78291	78291	I	0	' A thought seemed to flash across her mind while she was speaking , and she examined his face with no less attention than he had bestowed on hers in the chalet . '
78295	78300	78291	78291	I	0	' she went on , '
78315	78500	78501	78501	I	0	' Glanville entreated her not to trouble herself about so small a matter . He had not , in fact , eaten or drunk since the morning , and was beginning to feel the effects of his involuntary fast . But Hippolyta , with the woman 's feeling that men are always ready to eat and can not , like themselves , live on three grains of rice a day , was shocked to hear it . She begged him to sit near the fire and not stir till she came back . Then , running hastily out of the room , she left him to his own reflections , which were not disagreeable , but had lasted only a few minutes when she returned , bearing the requisites for afternoon tea , as Rupert would have said in any other drawing - room . Here it was probably not tea , but ambrosia , nectar , the amrita cup,—some enchanting draught with immortality among its ingredients . Hippolyta set the tray down ; and , with a smile , remarked to the artist : '
78562	78668	78531	78531	Andres	377	' Rupert was more and more embarrassed , though happier than words can express . Was he to dine alone with Hippolyta ? The gods be thanked . But what would men , and especially women , say ? It was like getting into heaven by a forbidden door . He could not refuse ; neither could he suggest that there were difficulties , that the world had its customs . Suggest such a thing to Hippolyta , who moved about with the grace and security of a young maiden in her own home , busy , unaffected , and the very picture of innocence ! '
78674	78681	78531	78531	Andres	377	' he thought with a sigh , '
78695	78964	78531	78531	Andres	377	' It did not appear that Hippolyta minded Mrs. Grundy in any way . She was the princess receiving a shipwrecked mariner into her palace ; a beneficent Calypso , to whom the rumours of the world did not penetrate , as she dwelt in her sequestered island , amusing herself with divine songs and a quick - footed steed . Had she no servants but Andres ? The place seemed silent , buried in deep sleep . No footfall was heard about it ; no sound but the murmuring cascade ; no voice within or without . Neither did Hippolyta appear to expect attendance . Did she abide all alone , like this , whenever Colonel Valence was absent ? She had described him as living very little at Falside . It was an extraordinary manner of passing her existence for a young girl , especially one so bright and vivacious as Hippolyta . Was it imaginable that she liked or could endure it long ? At this point in his meditations the lady offéred him a cup of the ambrosia she had been preparing . It was very good . Rupert felt like a new being when he had drunk it ; moreover , he secretly resolved to look upon it as the enchanting draught which henceforth bound him to exist under the governance and in the toils of Hippolyta . It was her own doing , and he would always plead it in excuse if she wished him to become a stranger again . But that he thought impossible after the events of the day . '
78973	78979	78966	78966	you	2187	' he ventured to ask . '
78986	78990	78983	78984	my father	5872	' she replied ; '
79119	79125	79116	79116	you	2200	' she added , laughing , '
79134	79135	79136	79136	You	0	' '
79145	79149	79136	79136	You	0	' said Rupert . '
79191	79192	79181	79181	they	2203	' '
79197	79201	79181	79181	they	2203	' she replied ; '
79229	79230	79232	79232	they	2207	' '
79246	79286	79232	79232	they	2207	' Rupert could not refrain from this question , but his curiosity was not altogether personal . Hippolyta did not resemble the masculine creature to whom he would have attributed a love of socialist theories or schemes of revolution . '
79302	79308	79232	79232	they	2207	' was her unexpected reply . '
79434	79559	79560	79561	Miss Valence	367	' She spoke warmly , and Rupert listened with admiration and suprise . He did not pretend to feel much with those that desire universal change . He was an artist , and dreaded the advent of democracy . But he could have worshipped any doctrine which came to him impersonated in such a form . However , he was spared making his profession of faith ; for Andres , coming in as Hippolyta finished speaking , announced that the stranger 's room was ready . Glanville rose . He could think of more things than one at a time , and he had made up his mind , while reflecting on Hippolyta 's eloquence , as to what it behoved him to do . '
79563	79572	79560	79561	Miss Valence	367	' he said , going up to her , '
79656	80141	79646	79646	they	2217	' He spoke reasonably , and Hippolyta was persuaded . She insisted only that he should stay for dinner . Andres , who was their coachman when they required one , would drive him , not over the moor , but round by the good roads on that side of the country . It would take time , but save mishaps , and Trelingham might be reached before midnight . When these things were clear Rupert followed Andres , who took him out of the cottage , and by a covered way up some steps into another building , almost as large , that stood behind it and contained kitchen , housekeeper 's room , and two or three guest - chambers . An ancient lady , as un - English in appearance as Andres,—she was his wife,—now took charge of Glanville , and led him upstairs to a small and plainly furnished room , where she left him without a word . It was the way at Falside to do everything as silently as possible . All manner of strange guests came thither , many of whom spoke no English and bore no particular name while under Colonel Valence 's roof . Whether Glanville was a refugee or an ordinary wayfarer who had been lost on the moor did not signify to the helpmate of Andres , nor did the good man enlighten her . An old revolutionist himself , he had asked in dumb show , on seeing him , whether Rupert was one of theirs . Hippolyta had used the English fashion of shaking her head to say no , and Andres , by this time somewhat naturalised , understood , but was not quite certain . Rupert came quickly down again , and entered the drawing - room . But he found no Hippolyta . He had leisure to look about him now , for he had observed nothing but Miss Valence 's face and motions while she was making tea . It was a library rather than a drawing - room , with bookshelves round the walls , and otherwise somewhat solidly furnished . But a nice disorder , and the presence of flowers and needle - work , were signs that Hippolyta made it her usual abode . On examining the shelves he saw books in every European langage,—some with extraordinary titles , betokening new systems of philosophy or of government , and a large number of modern poets and novelists . Among the latter were works he had never come across , which it surprised him to see in a lady 's collection . But he reflected that , in all likelihood , it was Colonel Valence and not Hippolyta who studied these daring romances . He could not associate her with the books that were there . She came in while he was looking at them . '
80149	80153	80145	80147	a great reader	2220	' she said , '
80201	80202	80204	80204	you	0	' '

80243	80248	80204	80204	you	0	' was her answer . '

80299	80388	80294	80294	you	0	' said Glanville , turning to a passage I need not transcribe , for it is , like the landscapes round Vesuvius and the Campanian coast , a possession of modern times as of antiquity,—the marvellous scene where Antigone , standing at first with head bent to the ground in the presence of Creon , lifts up voice and eyes , saying that neither Zeus , nor Righteousness , assessor of the gods , had established among men the law which she had violated in burying her brother . '
80392	80396	80390	80390	them	2228	' cried Hippolyta ; '
80417	80445	80402	80402	They	2228	' And taking the volume from him , she read in tones of strong feeling the lines that come after , at once so calm and pathetic . '
80448	80463	80465	80465	you	2230	' she said , when she had come to the end of the passage , '
80515	80535	80509	80509	Antigone	386	' " Such mighty heraldings I never dreamed , Mortal , were thine as could prevail to break The gods '
80627	80628	80629	80629	You	2230	' '
80635	80639	80629	80629	You	2230	' replied Glanville . '
80699	80708	80693	80697	the martyr of a custom	2240	' Hippolyta looked sad while he was speaking . '
80711	80715	80693	80697	the martyr of a custom	2240	' she said , '
80764	80775	80748	80748	you	2230	' Her voice sank a little ; she was grieved . '
80785	80790	80748	80748	you	2230	' exclaimed Rupert eagerly . '
80847	80848	80842	80842	I	0	' '
80859	80900	80850	80850	women	7138	' she inquired , still speaking in the low sweet voice , with its touch of sadness . Rupert fixed his eyes on her , not daringly , but with a light shining out of them as he made answer . '
80904	81113	81114	81114	I	0	' said he . She was silent . She closed the volume and restored it to its place . A moment after dinner was announced , and they passed into the dining - room . It was not so large as the one they had left , and looked out on another side of the cottage . A bright fire was burning in the grate . Andres , who had forgotten to draw the curtains , now shut out the October night , which seemed raw and chill . Hippolyta motioned Rupert to a seat at the bottom of the table and took her place opposite him . She had none of that trembling shyness that might have been expected in one so young . Evidently she had been accustomed to receive guests and entertain them in the self - possessed way she used towards the artist . He felt that the tête - à - tête meant less than he had imagined . Hippolyta had no need to keep him at a distance . She seemed to have forgotten their meeting at the Hermitage altogether . But it was not so . After dealing with indifferent topics , she came back to it of her own accord . '
81117	81123	81114	81114	I	0	' she said , smiling , '
81171	81229	81160	81161	the gods	1730	' Glanville was sure that Lord Trelingham would have been delighted to show her over the Hermitage . It was a pity that his own friend , Ivor Mardol , had not been there to welcome her ; he was exceedingly proud of having such a quaint habitation , and made a very tolerable hermit , too . '
81232	81236	81160	81161	the gods	1730	' answered Hippolyta , '
81401	81402	81406	81406	he	243	' '
81409	81413	81406	81406	he	243	' asked Rupert . '
81506	81636	81480	81480	I	0	' The dinner could not last long . Though no wine appeared on the table , it was one of the pleasantest in Rupert 's life . He must go now ; and Hippolyta , with the thoughtless cruelty of a young lady who was not in love , when she saw that he had no greatcoat or other defence against the night air , insisted on his wrapping himself in a soft woollen shawl which was assuredly no part of Colonel Valence 's apparel . The foolish young man was now quite enough intoxicated not to recover from his state of delirium so long as the remembrance of that night stayed with him . Hippolyta , on bidding him good - bye , detained him for a moment . '
81639	81643	81645	81645	you	2269	' she said , '
81700	81714	81690	81690	you	2269	' she continued , with a little more colour coming into her cheeks , '
81734	81739	81740	81740	he	274	' she concluded merrily , '
81750	82687	81740	81740	he	274	' Rupert promised , of course . What would he not have promised ? It was another link between them . He knew from Lady May 's silence , from her never mentioning Falside or Colonel Valence 's daughter , that no other way of conveying it could be open to Hippolyta . So much the better . It made him , in a sort , her representative , her accredited ambassador at Trelingham . But one thing remained which , in spite of his devotion or because of it , he had not promised , which nothing short of necessity should compel him to do ; and that was to mention where and how he had met Hippolyta . Their meeting , he said to himself , was in a realm with which strangers and denizens of the everyday world had nought to do — in the kingdom of poetry , in Fairyland . Should he tell Lord Trelingham that he had dreamt a midsummer night 's dream on an autumn morning ? Not though his reward should be,—he stopped when he came to this reflection . For the sentence would have ended by bestowing on him the hand of Lady May. He was sitting in the dogcart by the side of the old coachman , Andres ; and , if he blushed , the dark night concealed his shame . Twenty - four hours ago and less he had been resolved to ask Lord Trelingham for his daughter . Had the incident of the morning not taken place he must to - morrow have been uniting his fortune with that of a lady whom he did not love , whom he had never at any time loved . What an escape ! He knew the difference now . A single day had sufficed to show him his delusion . Was he grieved on Lady May 's account ? Love has been defined as l'égoisme à deux . Rupert was in love with Hippolyta , and for him the Earl 's daughter was merely a lady whose portrait he had painted . I do not say he would have summed the position in these harsh words ; but , it is quite true , the first hours of love are like a deep delirium wherein the patient sees only what imagination bodies forth . The world of reality slips away into unfathomable waters and is found no more . Lady May had ceased to mesmerise him . It was a pitch - dark night . Andres had received his instructions from Hippolyta , and drove warily along , neither making a remark nor troubled at the artist 's silence . They might have been travelling towards the centre of the earth or through a succession of coal - pits for all that was visible on either side . Glanville , who had a horror of darkness , grew tired and fell into a dose which was perpetually interrupted by the jolting of the vehicle over stones and rough ground , or stopping to ascertain where the road turned . Several times Andres dismounted to make certain that they were not passing the cross lanes from Falside to Trelingham . It was weary work , made endurable to Glanville only by remembering that he was wrapped in Hippolyta 's woollen shawl , which he meant not to return , if Andres could be got to overlook it , until he had an opportunity of thanking its owner in person . What ridiculous image and relic worshippers are all the slaves of Cupid ! How could a woollen shawl make Glanville happier except by making him warmer ? And yet it did , and not in that way alone . It wanted little of midnight when they came to the front terrace of Treligham Court . Andres rang the bell , saw Glanville safely down from his high seat , demanded the shawl by a respectful but not to be resisted gesture , and without waiting for fee or reward drove away in the dark . Lord Trelingham and the rest of the family were in the drawing - room , to which Rupert accordingly proceeded . There was some little commotion , followed by anxious questionings , on his appearance . The Earl had been alarmed and at a loss what to do , for no one could tell him in which direction his guest had walked out . Ivor Mardol , who had not gone to the Hermitage that day , was waiting for him , uncertain whether he should renew the efforts he had made a couple of hours previously to find him in the thick darkness . He had been searching on the Yalden side of the Park . But , of course , his search had been in vain . To Lady May the date marked out for something notable had seemed to be ending in calamity ; she thought Rupert might have been drowned , waylaid , murdered , she could not tell what . Her joy on seeing him was proportionate ; but she dared not trust her feelings , and spoke no more than she could help . Glanville , never used to giving a long account of himself , now briefly explained that he had not walked in the direction of Yalden , but had crossed the stream and lost his way on the moor . A lucky accident had taken him near Falside , where he had been given something to eat and enabled to reach Trelingham . '
82694	82704	82689	82689	you	2272	' inquired the Earl , scanning his face eagerly . '
82712	82716	82705	82706	Colonel Valence	274	' replied Glanville . '
82722	82742	82743	82744	Miss Valence	367	' asked Lady May. The artist , with a great appearance of sleepy distraction , answered in two words , '
82746	82747	82743	82744	Miss Valence	367	' '
82753	82763	82750	82751	Miss Valence	367	' cried Lady May , glancing towards her father ; '
82778	82779	82774	82774	I	0	' '
82785	82795	82774	82774	I	0	' said Rupert , feeling more and more sleepy ; '
82815	82819	82800	82800	I	0	' he continued , '
82858	83087	82846	82846	I	0	' They let him go . He looked as tired as he said . The Earl would have liked to ask him about Falside , which he had not seen , except in the distance , for several years . And Lady May , on retiring to rest towards one o'clock , had only one thought in her mind , but it kept her awake for hours . He had seen Miss Valence ; what was she like ? Was she the sort of person to captivate Rupert , who was surely of a susceptible temperament , yet seemed on his guard against the approach of love ? She could not be certain that he cared for herself in any passionate way . Would he care at all , would he care more for Miss Valence ? An anxious problem . Rupert fell fast asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow ; and during the next eight hours paid equal attention , that is to say none at all , to Hippolyta and Lady May. And Hippolyta ? It would be interesting to know her thoughts after that passionate pilgrim had vanished into the dark . Could Rupert 's undisguised admiration have kindled in her an answering gleam ? Who knows ? For , after one brief interview , the heroine in Shakespeare found herself inquiring , '
83097	83123	82846	82846	I	0	' Certain it is that Hippolyta , before going to her room , sat down to read once again the concluding scenes of the Antigone . '
83126	83140	82846	82846	I	0	' she said to herself with decision as she came to the end , '
83152	83415	83150	83150	Woman	6532	' END OF VOL . I It was natural that Lord Trelingham should ask next morning how Rupert had been led to Falside . And just as natural was it that Rupert should not know where to begin . He would not mention his first encounter with Hippolyta , and was thereby at a loss how to explain the second . He kept , therefore , to the vague and the general . He had never crossed the stream before , and , on the completion of his picture , had been seized with an irresistible desire to spend a morning in the open air and to explore the country which lay across the high and woody banks of Yale . He was not , like his friend Ivor , endowed with a strong local memory , and the mist which came down on the moor obliterated the usual landmarks . While in this uncertainty , Miss Valence , who was riding home , as he supposed , and who might have gathered from his appearance that he was a stranger , came to his rescue . She told him that he could not reach Trelingham before nightfall , and very kindly offered him shelter and refreshment at her father 's house . He might have hesitated had Colonel Valence been at home ; but in his absence no subjects were likely to be handled in which a guest at Trelingham could not join , and he had accepted Miss Valence 's benevolent offer . At this point Lady May interrupted him . '
83422	83432	83417	83418	Miss Valence	367	' So far as he knew , she was . '
83441	83448	83436	83439	an extraordinary young lady	2275	' said the Earl 's daughter . '
83528	83600	83521	83521	she	367	' Glanville hardly knew ; no , he thought not ; he had no opinion , except that Miss Valence seemed to have had more experience of the world than he could have supposed . And here he began to consider how he should give her message to Lady May. Better now than when they were alone . He must speak as not having received any special confidences while at Falside . '
83604	83619	83601	83602	Miss Valence	367	' he said , not without an inward thrill as he mentioned her name , '
83672	83684	83685	83685	she	367	' he went on , directing his words to the Earl , '
83711	83712	83714	83714	she	367	' '
83717	83728	83714	83714	she	367	' cried the Countess , who had been listening attentively . '
83749	83823	83748	83748	May.	394	' Her cousin was astonished , not at Karina , who uttered whatever came into her flighty brain , but at the message conveyed by Rupert . She was not prejudiced in favour of Miss Valence . Though her own views were unconventional and her principles daringly unlike those in which , as the daughter of a pious English peer , she had been trained , it did not follow that she approved of '
83827	84451	83748	83748	May.	394	' as she called them . Neighbours who remembered Lady Alice 's marriage , were slow to mention the Valences when one of the Trelingham family happened to be present . Yet she had heard and seen enough to give her a disagreeable notion of Hippolyta as a bold , hoydenish sort of young person , brought up nobody knew where , and showing in her conduct a complete indifference to the sacred usages of the class to which her father at least belonged . Lady May was capable of breaking with society to gratify a strong inclination ; but she was not capable of riding out without a groom . Those laws of the Medes and Persians which , concerned with slight outward forms , are different in different countries , are yet in each inviolable . Now Hippolyta had never borne their yoke . She could not feel the enormity of the offences she almost daily committed against those which govern Englishwomen . Not a stain could be imputed to her ; in word and deed she was white as the driven snow . And yet the mention of her name in any drawing - room within a circuit of a dozen miles was accompanied , on the part of her own sex , with mysterious looks and frowns , which implied that her reputation was a thing of naught . On first coming into the country she was too young to be introduced anywhere ; nor did Colonel Valence , who never entered a drawing - room , seek female society for his daughter . She had grown up alone , and seemed not to mind it . But such an eccentric way of life made it impossible that the ladies around should make acquaintance with her now she had reached the age of nineteen . She was excommunicated by universal though tacit consent . She was a social outcast , to be owned by no class of her father 's fellow - citizens or their wives . Did she feel it ? Was she aware of it even ? Impossible to say . If she suffered , neither Colonel Valence nor any of their forein guests observed her suffering . She went to and fro , or stayed at home and received her visitors , with much the same freedom and straightforwardness which a young man of her own age would have displayed . Her manners were , in this respect , American . Most certainly they were un - English . Had one of the younger revolutionists that sometimes came happened to interest her in his views , she would have written long letters to him and permitted or enjoined him to answer at equal length , nor imagined that she was indulging an unfeminine intimacy . Assuredly she had not the shadow of a notion that such correspondence implied a promise or prospect of their union for life . As a matter of fact , she had no correspondent except her father ; but she might have had a score and Colonel Valence would not have interposed . She did , indeed , write letters at his dictation to all parts of Europe , sometimes in cypher , and often without remembering their contents . These things were not all within Lady May 's knowledge , but some of them were ; and she could not decide whether the message conveyed by Rupert was a fresh instance of Miss Valence 's boldness , or whether she ought to accept it in a friendly spirit . Her first resolution was in the negative . She could not take notice of Hippolyta ; it would be every way unbecoming . '
84458	84625	84453	84453	you	2289	' she inquired of Rupert . He admitted that he had done so ; and further civil questioning made it clear that Miss Valence had presided at the dinner - table . This was dreadful in a maiden of nineteen ; how could any lady that respected herself visit such a hardened sinner , such an inexcusable culprit ? So reasoned the Earl 's daughter on hearing these confessions , although for the honour of her sex she made no remark . Rupert , likewise , came in for his share of censure . But he was only a man , and men are easily led from the right path when women are bold . Call on Miss Valence ? no , indeed . But the Countess would not leave her in peace . When she expressed her decision in a brief but energetic sentence , that lady , appealing to the Earl , who tolerated her saucy ways with marvellous good - nature , said , '
84707	84716	84718	84718	people	5883	' continued the Countess in a wise tone , '
84764	84803	84804	84804	I	0	' She spoke with conviction , the lawless creature ! The beginning of this little speech was more persuasive than the end . Lord Trelingham smiled at the first words , and did not attend to the last . '
84809	84821	84804	84804	I	0	' he said , with a benignant glance at his daughter , '
84892	85008	84886	84886	you	2299	' Lady May was still reflecting on the odd circumstance that Rupert should have dined at Falside . She did not answer immediately . Her affection for the artist had not yet been quickened by jealousy . But she disliked the thought of Hippolyta intervening at that moment . Why could fortune not have waited till Rupert had taken the decisive step ? It was a most undesirable incident . If she declined to call on Miss Valence , she must remain in the dark about her so long as Rupert hesitated . There might , of course , be no feelings on either side ; but still — She must gain time to think . '
85017	85027	85011	85012	Colonel Valence	274	' she inquired by way of answering her father . '
85033	85038	85011	85012	Colonel Valence	274	' said the Earl . '
85093	85112	85113	85113	I	0	' Rupert , who had reasons on his side to encourage the intimacy , threw in a word . '
85148	85149	85126	85126	She	5673	' '
85154	85159	85126	85126	She	5673	' said the Earl . '
85195	85602	85191	85191	his	274	' Nothing more was said just then . A few days passed ; and Rupert , still in a dream which was so vivid and absorbing that he hardly wanted to see Hippolyta , went silently to and fro in the Park or spent hours by the sea , his imagination busy on the designs which must be prepared for the Great Hall , his heart musing on its own happiness and inspiring his genius with ever fresh lights . He said little or nothing ; but the watchful eye of his hostess caught him smiling often , fantastically , like Malvolio , whom , as I have remarked , most infatuated lovers resemble in their gestures . The change , unobserved by others , could not escape Lady May ; but the meaning of it was beyond her . Rupert never uttered Miss Valence 's name . Now that the tête - à - tête in the picture - gallery had come to an end , these two seldom saw one another alone , and at no time for more than a few seconds . While others were present Rupert stayed ; when they went he found a pretext for leaving the room . All this he did unconsciously , not being quite awake . The question whether he had done Lady May a wrong was one that , after the drive from Falside , ceased to trouble him . The truth is that he scarcely thought of her at all . Years of absence could not have made a wider gulf between them than the hours he had passed with Hippolyta , or in thinking about her since their meeting . He looked neither before nor after . He did not even reflect on the difficulties which might arise should Lady May call on Hippolyta and the innocent Amazon gave an account of her visit to the Hermitage . She was capable of it ; but Rupert never heeded . Fortune favoured him , more perhaps than he deserved . The next time he rowed to the chalet Ivor was at home . Our philosopher had fallen into a habit of spending almost every day by himself , and appeared at Trelingham merely for dinner , being occupied , as he said , in the work which Rupert had given him . Imagine the consternation of the latter when his friend said to him , '

85623	85653	85191	85191	his	274	' said Rupert , looking up from the couch where he lounged away his time on these visits . He was alarmed and nervous at what might be coming . '

86813	86817	86805	86805	you	242	' replied Ivor , '

86974	86978	86969	86969	he	2338	' said Rupert , '
86988	87220	86969	86969	he	2338	' He could not help laughing as he spoke at the thought of trying to mislead Ivor . The fatal effects of love ! He was aware that the relations between Colonel Valence and Lord Trelingham had never been discussed before his friend . Ivor did not know the story of the Madonna of San Lucar except in general outline , nor until the adventure on the moor had Miss Valence been mentioned . Thus if the young man departed immediately he might never know who had left the missive on his table . Rupert felt certain it was Hippolyta . Her bold visit was now explained ; and the circumstance that she had held a book in her hand when she received him so calmly was decisive . He would have liked to ask whether his friend knew the Valences or anything about them . But it was part of their silent compact never to indulge in personal questions which might involve deceit on Ivor 's part . Rupert was in the dark , not as to his friend 's convictions , but as to the extent to which they implicated him in dangerous designs . That Ivor would not countenance assassination he felt sure . But there his knowledge ended . So now he did not dare to mention Colonel Valence or his daughter . But Ivor was speaking . '
87234	87238	86969	86969	he	2338	' he exclaimed ; '
87252	87253	87244	87250	the strange being from whom this comes	2340	' '
87260	87264	87265	87265	I	0	' said Glanville . '
87269	87275	87265	87265	I	0	' replied the other quietly ; '
87290	87482	87483	87483	We	2342	' He put forth his unmerciful hand while speaking , and , to Rupert 's poignant grief , took the beloved object away . To protest would have been in vain . With sorrowful eyes the worshipper of Hippolyta beheld her divine glove ( is it not so the poets call it ? ) weighted with a stone and flung into the mere . A ripple on the waters showed where it had gone down , and for half a minute Rupert detested his bosom - friend . But , wise even in despair , he held his peace ; and the adored name of Hippolyta escaped not the hedge of his teeth . Ivor , as though he had accomplished a sacred duty , turned the conversation to other things ; and his friend when he grew calm believed that the peril on that side was past . How did it stand on the other , which was Lady May 's ? When in the evening he returned to Trelingham one of the first to greet him was the Countess Lutenieff , and she did so in the triumphant words , '
87490	88631	87487	87488	Miss Valence	367	' The young man 's heart beat fast . He thought it was the Countess 's doing , and he did not know whether to feel grateful or the reverse . He wished the acquaintance had begun under better auspices . But he was mistaken . Not Karina , but Lady May had proposed to drive over in the afternoon to Falside . This was the outcome of her painful meditations . She would see with her own eyes and hear with her own ears . To linger in suspense was intolerable ; it was , indeed , killing her , as she said with the exaggerated language of passion for which , in this instance , ground was not wholly wanting . Once having resolved on the visit , she was restless till it had taken place . To her fevered spirit even the hours occupied in driving to Falside seemed an age . It was a delightfully still afternoon , with that serious unruffled calm over earth and sea which has the solemnity though not the bitterness of a farewell to things mortal . The trees were bare , the long lanes dry and leafless , the country silent as they drove through it . Lady May , addressing no word to her cousin , sat upright in her furs and looked eagerly onward , as though to quicken the pace at which they were moving . She would have given much to be tranquil , but it was not in her nature ; and when the carriage turned at the steep entrance to Falside , she almost wished that she had never undertaken this trying visit . Could any good come of it ? But self - control was too much a habit of her life to be shaken even by a meeting with the woman on whose attractiveness or the want of it her future perhaps depended ; and only the sharpened attention of Karina could perceive that in shaking hands with Hippolyta she was inwardly agitated . The supreme powers , indeed , had so ordered it that their first encounter was agreeable . Lady May acquitted herself of a delicate task with grace and courtesy , while the quiet spirit of the afternoon seemed to have passed into Hippolyta . Unaffectedly surprised and pleased with Lady May 's kindness , she was not so much the spirited maiden who feared neither to ride alone nor to preside at the dinner - table when her father gathered round it his miscellaneous guests , as the child who is all shyness and gratitude in return for a token of love . With charming simplicity she did the honours of Falside ; and while not apologising for anything in their way of life , she spoke as if taking for granted the peculiarities in her bringing - up and in Colonel Valence 's history , which would explain whatever might seem strange . There was not a turn in her speech nor a trace in her bearing that could be deemed unfeminine . The Countess was particularly struck with her ; she was so elegantly dressed and looked so beautiful in the shades of colour she had chosen that all idea of a female revolutionist vanished from Karina 's mind . If she was leaned , she kept it to herself ; if unbelieving , as people said , she was certainly not aggressive . Her natural delight on receiving them gained her visitors in no long time , so that a stranger coming in might have taken them for old established callers . And , pray , what did they talk about ? You may well ask , for it was a curiously intimate yet strictly defined conversation . Subjects there were in the minds of all three which , though constantly suggesting themselves , could not be handled . Lady May found it wisest , as it was most natural , to begin with the occurrence that had given occasion to their meeting — Rupert 's adventure on the moor . Had the gentleman himself been in company he would have praised Hippolyta 's discretion — it was equal to her other adorable virtues . For when , by the tenor of Lady May 's discourse , it was evident that he had said nothing at Trelingham of their meeting in the morning , she fell in with Rupert 's policy and said as little . This was not because Miss Valence deemed her conduct unmaidenly ; the thought never entered her mind . But if Rupert had not spoken , there was no reason why she should speak . She allowed the story to begin where he told it ; and keenly as her visitors examined her countenance while she inquired about him , neither the Countess nor Lady May perceived a change in its exquisite calm or noted in her voice the tremulousness that is born of love . The Earl 's daughter began to feel happier ; and her cousin , in whose fertile mind a certain plan had been ripening , had to brush away a sense of disappointment when it appeared that Rupert Glanville excited no more interest at Falside than a young man may to whom one has given shelter from the rain . Hippolyta knew nothing of his pictures , and could ask about them in a steady voice . Then she passed to a more important topic,—her own isolation , necessitated , in great measure , by the wandering life of Colonel Valence and the principles on which he regulated his household . It was impossible , she said with a smile , to receive friends who could not forego the convenience of servants , or who would be shocked by seeing their hostess performing what they might deem menial offices . Nor did she complain of her exclusion from the world . She was not without interests ; she had travelled with her parents in many parts of Europe ; and she had books and a horse . All she wanted besides — she hesitated , and looked in a pleading , affectionate way from one lady to the other — was a friend or two of her own sex , who might remind her that there were other things as sweet and precious as the service in which she was engaged . Especially , she went on , it had been her desire to know a little of Lady May , to be allowed sometimes to talk with her , and , sooner or later , to help towards healing the feud which had lasted so many years . It was daring , on her part , to make the request which Rupert had conveyed . '
88634	88638	88639	88639	you	2343	' she said , '
88677	88784	88785	88785	My	0	' All this was said with extreme modesty and a charm of manner which Lady May had been far from anticipating . Hippolyta 's strange beauty dazzled her ; while the combination of self - respect with straightforward feeling which appeared in all she spoke , made it impossible to set her down as the unwomanly creature she was deemed in the neighbourhood . She asked for affection . Could it be refused ? But while Lady May was reasoning , the Countess had decided . With her birdlike lightness she had flown to Hippolyta , and , kissing her on the cheek , cried out , '
88836	88850	88793	88793	You	5845	' Hippolyta returned her embrace , saying in a low , earnest voice , '
88858	88924	88925	88925	My	0	' But she still kept her eyes on Lady May , as though the Countess 's affection by itself would not suffice . The Earl 's daughter had gone too far to draw back . Neither was she disposed to feel uneasy , as before their meeting . She put out her hand and took Hippolyta 's with a firm grasp , while she said , '
88996	88997	88987	88987	He	5872	' '
89000	89004	88987	88987	He	5872	' said Hippolyta , '
89062	89568	89054	89054	He	5872	' On this understanding they parted . Hippolyta promised that she would come to Trelingham for a long day , as soon as her household affairs permitted ; and Lady May renewed her assurances that she should be received by the Earl with cordiality . At the gate , to which she accompanied them , Hippolyta underwent a second embrace from Madame de Lutenieff , and again shook hands with the less demonstrative of her visitors . She saw them off , and walked back with thoughtful steps and slow along the terrace , listening to her waterfall as it leapt merrily down the rocks . Much had been done , but much remained to do . Her purpose in soliciting Lady May 's friendship was indeed simply to end the long disagreement between the families . She could not comprehend her father 's motive in keeping it up , unless that he fancied the Earl unwilling to be reconciled . But the Earl had relented , according to Lady May ; and why should Colonel Valence not do the same ? Their political differences were not to the point ; they never had met , nor were likely to meet , on this ground . For if Lord Trelingham was a Tory of the purest type , her father represented a programme which at that date no English party would have dreamt of adopting . He despised the politics of the polling - booth , and would have begun his reform by abolishing not only the Crown , but the Houses of Parliament with it . She knew that the two men could never again be friends ; why , however , should they continue to be enemies ? The waters kept falling with their pleasant ripple , and Hippolyta roamed about her garden till sundown . Such was the event of which Rupert heard from the Countess when he came in ; and at dinner she dressed it up in the grotesque fancies suggested by her imagination . She had never seen any one like Hippolyta . She compared her , as the artist himself had done , to a sylph , a creature of romance , imprisoned by Colonel Valence at Falside . They ought not to rest till she was delivered . Glanville laughingly inquired whether a captive sylph was in the habit of riding alone all over the country ; and was told in reply that Hippolyta 's captivity was moral , not a mere imprisonment of the body . She dressed with remarkable taste for one who had never seen a fashionable gathering ; but that might be inspiration like Rachel 's , who could have worn a tablecloth as if it were a princess 's robe . And her manners , though wild , were beautiful . Therefore she must come out and be made know to civilised people . The Countess would do her that charity if no one else was willing , for she adored Hippolyta . '
89579	89583	89570	89570	you	2356	' asked Glanville . '
89639	89640	89641	89641	You	2362	' '
89649	89653	89641	89641	You	2362	' said Karina ; '
89710	89711	89702	89703	Miss Valence	367	' '
89720	89725	89712	89712	She	2358	' said Lady May , '
89747	90093	89742	89742	she	2358	' It was evident that she had not spoken of the Hermitage . Oh , wise Hippolyta , thought Rupert . Now he should see her again ; and the secret between them would give him an advantage . All love - making is a contest in which not a little depends on the given odds . Hippolyta was to some extent in his power . And he was no longer in hers — since she had kept silence when to speak might have put him in the wrong . He watched every day till she came . A whole week moved on at the laggard pace of time when we are expecting something to happen . Ivor finished his work , or at least put it in order for Rupert to finish ; packed up his belongings , and said good - bye to the Earl and Lady May with a tranquil mien in which none could have discerned the passionate regrets that filled his heart . Lord Trelingham begged him to come back as soon as he could ; the Hermitage would be always at his disposal , and he might rest assured of a hearty welcome . He smiled sadly ; no , he thanked them , it was most improbable that he should return . Circumstances , his way of life , imperative engagements , forbade the hope . But he would call on them in town ? He did not know ; the future was so uncertain . Then Tom Davenant said he must come to Foxholme ; and poor Ivor turned away his face because of the shame and emotion that were gathering there . If Tom could only know upon what errand he was departing , the last thing he would have imagined would have been such an invitation . He loved the young man . But they stood ranged on opposite sides in the battle of life ; and the trumpetcall which was sounding in his own ears sternly told him that friendship must yield to duty . '
90103	90107	90094	90094	I	0	' he answered , '
90129	90475	90476	90476	You	2368	' Tom had , therefore , to content himself with the mournful pleasure of driving him to the station , which he did with exemplary skill , at the same time assuring Ivor that if he would not mind little deficiencies in writing and grammar — his ignorance of which the young man regretted , though too late — he , Tom Davenant , should find solace in corresponding with him . His friend smiled and said how grateful it would make him , adding that , in case he delayed an answer for some weeks , it would mean that he was gone from home . Characteristic of the man I call it , that his sorrow on leaving these two friends , Rupert and Tom Davenant , almost made him forget the love he was renouncing . Nay , he thought more of the new friend than of the old during those days ; for the expected to meet Rupert again in London or abroad , but this might prove his last farewell to Tom Davenant . He had lived more than four months at the chalet . It was now November ; and the winter of his discontent took from him , or made more piercing , the remembrance of those heavenly days when first he came . Happy if he could forget them altogether ! But no , they would be a lifelong regret . Even as the thought crossed his mind he smiled bitterly . Lifelong might not be so very long after all . He was ordered to the front ; and those who are to face cannon do not insure their lives at a low premium . He would not disclose to the friend by his side , or even to Rupert , how serious the danger had become ; I should rather say , he could not , for they would have hindered his going . But a certain steady light in his eyes and involuntary tension of the muscles betokened the excitement under which he laboured . '
90482	90488	90476	90476	You	2368	' said Tom to him ; '
90497	91109	90476	90476	You	2368	' Rupert noticed his mood , was exceedingly gentle with him as on the like occasions in their previous intercourse ; but ventured neither to ask a question nor to offer advice . He knew well that Ivor did not brook interference . So he went away and disappeared into the unknown . Rupert , a few days after , requested that the chalet might be assigned to himself as a studio and general storehouse , for he did not wish to encumber the Great Hall as yet , and his sketches took up room . But he never went across the mere till he had ascertained that Hippolyta would not call in the morning . He was now assiduous in his politeness to Lady May , upon whose spirits a dull tranquillity had fallen , like yellow fog stifling and blinding her . She could not subdue the fascination of being with him ; ever when he came into the room the others vanished from her eyes and she looked at him alone , and brooded over his slightest utterances . She did not fear Hippolyta much now ; and not to be jealous was comparative happiness . There had come indeed an end of her confidences and of his listening to them . But when would he declare himself ? For he was surely bound by what had passed . It was a lovely morning when Hippolyta appeared at Trelingham , in a low chaise which she drove herself , while the silent old groom or gardener sat behind . She had come to spend the day , but not to dine ; for she said in her note that they must excuse her shyness if she felt tempted to fly away again as soon as she found herself inside the Court . Glanville , who had been lingering since breakfast about the gate by which she was to enter and saw her drive by , himself lying close in ambush , ran along other pathways up to the house , and the moment he decently could sauntered into the morning - room where the three ladies were seated . That he blushed like a very young man on meeting those brown eyes need hardly be said ; and if Hippolyta 's countenance did not put on exactly the same shade of crimson , it may have been simply because hers was a pale ivory cheek and his was rather swarthy . They were both a good deal embarrassed , which Lady May ascribed to the circumstances of the adventure which had made them acquainted . She said to herself that Miss Valence , though she had sinned against propriety on that day , had done so ignorantly , while Rupert was often confused on coming into a room . They talked until the Earl came about the scenery of Trelingham Park , which Hippolyta did not know except on the outskirts . And the artist sat and gazed at her . She was more beautiful than ever . Lady May , whome he could now contrast with his divinity , seemed a majestic woman , allied to the dangerous creatures of forest or jungle in whose composition there is more fire than light . But Hippolyta did not belong to earth . Fervent she might be in her feelings , quick to speak and to move ; her beauty was not childlike , nor did it appeal merely to the softer passions of pity and tenderness ; but there was about her , all the while , an innocent directness , a virginal simplicity , which made of her '
91116	91275	90476	90476	You	2368	' When she answered Lady May her voice had in it a tone of great affection , which changed to something bright and sparkling if the Countess addressed her . But it was clear that she listened , even while joining in the conversation , for a step that happily was not long delayed . Every minute she had looked towards the door in anxious expectation ; and when it opened and the Earl of Trelingham came in , walking with the feeble gait which was growing habitual with him , she rose at once and ran to meet the old man . He took both her hands in his , and , clasping them affectionately , led her towards the window . There was little need to say that he welcomed her ; his emotion proved it better than words . After scanning her face eagerly in silence , he let go her hands , and said , '
91356	91357	91358	91358	I	0	' '
91361	91365	91358	91358	I	0	' answered Hippolyta , '
91402	91411	91391	91391	me	0	' and she stopped as if for permission . '
91418	91423	91391	91391	me	0	' said the Earl ; '
91435	91448	91429	91429	you	5845	' He too seemed overcome by her great beauty and simple ways . '
91456	91460	91450	91450	I	0	' she said , '
91514	91515	91510	91510	I	0	' '
91519	91524	91526	91526	God	276	' said the Earl , '
91640	91641	91642	91642	My	0	' '
91654	91658	91648	91649	Lady Alice	275	' replied Hippolyta . '
91735	91736	91718	91718	she	6777	' '
91742	91747	91752	91752	she	2390	' inquired the Earl . '
91761	91771	91752	91752	she	2390	' Rupert waited with some curiosity for the answer . '
91782	91786	91752	91752	she	2390	' said Hippolyta ; '
91804	91910	91796	91797	My father	5872	' She spoke with composure , and seemed to have said all that she thought necessary . Lord Trelingham was too well bred to pursue the examination . His melancholy looks , indeed , bore witness to what he feared would have been the result . He blamed Colonel Valence , but it was impossible to blame his daughter ; and the sad spiritual condition of so lovely and innocent a creature filled him with indignation , which went far to counteract his previous desire to condone the past . Meanwhile , Karina , whose eager spirits made her sometimes inconsiderate , inquired of Hippolyta , '
91933	91946	91947	91947	My	0	' Lord Trelingham , with some severity in his tone , interposed . '
91951	91955	91947	91947	My	0	' he said , '
91982	91998	91999	91999	I	0	' But Miss Valence was not offended . She replied at once to the Countess . '
92039	92249	92031	92032	My father	5872	' This remarkable declaration , made in her natural voice , which was gentle and sweet , came upon her hearers like lightning from a clear sky . It startled them , although every one present had supposed it already . But there are so many things we know yet could not venture on putting into words . The Earl was inexpressibly pained ; Lady May looked across at Glanville to see what effect this confession would have on him ; and the Countess felt frightened , as though a snake had turned under her hand and bitten her . Rupert moved uncomfortably in his chair . It was a shock to him , certainly . He would have said , in the abstract , that with these matters women had nothing to do ; they ought to keep to the religion in which they were born and leave speculation to the philosophers . But when his eyes fell on the beloved features again the discomfort vanished . Hippolyta sat , a picture of quiet beauty , untroubled by the momentary silence which had followed her declaration , and perhaps too little acquainted with the ways of the world to comprehend how much it had astonished them . She said '
92257	92270	92250	92251	My father	5872	' as she would have said , had it been the fact , '
92276	92408	92250	92251	My father	5872	' She was not aggressive or defiant , but natural and innocent . Thus it came to pass that even Lord Trelingham 's horror , which was exceedingly great , yielded to compassion , and he thought it more than ever expedient to make her at home among good Christians who might enlighten her . But lest that terrible niece of his should ask more questions , he turned the conversation to Miss Valence 's knowledge of the Continent , and they were soon deep in the comparative beauties of the Alps and the Apennines . Her parents , it was evident , had wandered fast and far , seldom staying long in one place , and never making the acquaintance of great families unless some member of them happened to be '
92414	92431	92250	92251	My father	5872	' as Lord Trelingham would have called it , or , in Colonel Valence 's phrase , '
92436	92933	92934	92934	You	2404	' There was something even slightly ridiculous in the way that names came up between the Earl and the young lady . If he mentioned a noble house , she often knew it ; but when he went on to describe the august head thereof or his equally august consort , Hippolyta had never seen either , and owed her familiarity with the name to a scapegrace or scientific young man , the grief of his parents , who had served with Garibaldi in Sicily , or was famous in the Cretan or the Polish rising . Lord Trelingham bore it very well ; this he had expected ; and much as he might deplore the associations in which Valence had brought up his daughter , there were too many great Englishmen on that side to allow of unmitigated censure in the instance before him . The Earl was by no means liberal , but he was something which is perhaps as commendable in a world where we can not have all we should like,—he was good - natured , and quite incapable of indentifying individuals with the doctrines they held . He therefore listened with patience and a degree of interest to the remarks , which were rather pointed than voluble , of Hippolyta on those revolutionary young men whose pedigree he knew in Lombardy and Languedoc . He was led to speak of his own travels , which had been extensive ; but , interrupting himself suddenly in the midst of his recital , he asked whether Miss Valence had ever been in Spain . Yes , she told him , once , on the side of Barcelona . And Seville , did she know that picturesque city ? She had not been there , nor had her father mentioned his early campaign in its neighbourhood . Then she knew nothing of the Madonna of San Lucar ? Nothing whatever , she replied . He was astonished that so striking an incident of his first travels had not been a favourite theme of Colonel Valence 's . However , it might help to soften him still more if he learned how narrowly the picture had escaped destruction . He would perhaps be touched on hearing it ; for the sight of the portrait long ago had affected him powerfully and even brought him , one might say , from Spain to Trelingham . Herewith the Earl invited Hippolyta to follow him to the gallery upstairs . She rose , nothing loth ; and as he evidently wished the rest to accompany them , a general move was made . The Countess , again interposing as they went along , asked Hippolyta whether she knew what kind of picture was about to be shown her . The young lady , turning half round on the stairs , answered that she supposed it would resemble those she had noticed in the great collections on the Continent . '
92939	92944	92934	92934	You	2404	' she added innocently , '
92970	93192	92954	92954	I	0	' Glanville fell back a step on hearing this language , and Karina did not open her mouth again for some time . She was daring herself , but she knew that ordinary people did not speak in this way ; and again the simile of the snake occurred to her . Lord Trelingham was either deaf or preoccupied , and took no heed of the remark . Perhaps he was thinking how he could make the history of the picture brief yet intelligible ; for , when they arrived before it , he began at once to run over the main points as we know them . He said nothing of Valence 's motives for leaving England , nor of what followed when he came back to Trelingham . But how much of his narrative did the stranger apprehend ? She stood like one spellbound , first eyeing Lady May and then lost in the magnificence and glory of the painting . The Earl ceased to speak , and there was a long silence , during which Hippolyta steadfastly gazed at it , never turning her head , with the expression of one who would learn a thing by heart . By and by she glanced towards Lady May , and going up to her , said in a whisper , '
93209	93244	93258	93261	an ancestress of mine	2407	' The question was extraordinary , but Hippolyta seemed in earnest . Lady May smiled with a feeling of anguish ; she still felt the distance between herself and that ideal of heavenly innocence . '
93252	93256	93258	93261	an ancestress of mine	2407	' she replied , '
93277	93278	93263	93263	I	0	' '
93282	93286	93263	93263	I	0	' Hippolyta said , '
93337	93343	93331	93331	you	242	' she asked of Lady May. '
93349	93358	93344	93344	I	0	' was the answer , given somewhat impetuously ; '
93374	93375	93387	93387	them	2416	' '
93378	93382	93387	93387	them	2416	' said Hippolyta ; '
93494	93529	93454	93455	the philosophers	1715	' She looked round , expecting some one , as it should seem , to answer . But they were too much astonished at such curious words on the lips of one so young . '
93538	93547	93454	93455	the philosophers	1715	' said Glanville , coming close to her . '
93587	93588	93590	93590	you	2422	' '
93596	93601	93590	93590	you	2422	' she said inquiringly . '
93609	93613	93590	93590	you	2422	' he answered . '
93631	93649	93590	93590	you	2422	' Lady May listened ; she heard something in his voice of which she did not approve . '
93662	93666	93590	93590	you	2422	' exclaimed Hippolyta , '
93731	93740	93742	93742	you	2422	' The Earl put in his quiet word . '
93803	93949	93786	93787	Mr. Glanville	242	' She left the picture unwillingly , and looked back more than once as they went to the door . The incident had shown her in a strange and amiable light which endeared her to the heart of Lord Trelingham ; while Rupert , mindful of his own enthusiasm when restoring the Madonna of the Seraphim , said to himself that this highly poetic temperament had at once seized its meaning and reality — a result which only days of study had brought about in him the sensitive artist . Hippolyta was peculiar ; but where in heaven or earth could he find a more exquisite creation ? When , by and by , she spoke of returning to Falside , and the Earl was taking her to the ponychaise which had been brought round , that kind - hearted old man said to her , '
94009	95422	94007	94007	him	6060	' Three months passed quickly by , the happiest in Rupert 's life . Winter by the Western Sea is often wild and stormy ; the days have little light in them , and the moist vapour filling the air seems to cling heavily about one , while hour after hour the rain - clouds creep along the sides of the valleys or hang on the wooded ridges above them . It is a monotonous , dull - eyed season , the least favourable that can be imagined to inspiration ; and only a brave spirit will bear up against it or keep alert under its stupefying influence . But the brave spirit was there . If light grew scant outside , and work went on slowly in the Great Hall , a radiance was kindling within the artist 's fancy which became larger every day , adding an energy to his step , a charm to his voice and expression , and for the while utterly doing away with the melancholy that used to haunt him . When he was called to his London studio , as happened more than once , he went regretfully , stayed the shortest possible time , and ran back again like a boy escaping from school over the palings . He came to be looked upon almost as a member of the Trelingham household ; and , in turn , he seemed to love everything in and about it . His unequal humour gave place to a cheerfulness which was willing to amuse and to be amused . Nothing could ruffle him ; and Lady May , in spite of herself , caught the infection of his high spirits , while Tom Davenant declared that if all artists resembled Glanville they were not half - bad fellows . The Earl , though no judge of character , became ever more thankful that Providence , through his daughter 's suggestion , had put him in the way of a great painter and most agreeable companion , who knew how to observe the delicate line of conduct traced out for him by circumstances . Rupert 's behaviour was , I must say , perfect ; he kept his distance , did not ask or encourage sentimental conversations on the part of Lady May , and displayed towards her and the Countess a courtesy in which it would have been impossible to strike a shade of difference . If he had in any way presumed , here to a reasonable mind was satisfaction . The secret of his content lay near at hand . For the first time in his life he was in love . He saw Hippolyta when she visited Trelingham ; he met her by chance as she rode out , and watched her foot - steps along the sands where , on bright afternoons , she sometimes walked . He professed an ardent desire to know the tracks over the moor which lay on the other side of Yale ; and his explorations naturally took him up the course of the stream , if only to admire in its winter glory the cascade from which Falside derived its name . At this time of the year he found it more romantic , and the flood of waters more plenteous , than he had expected . It was , indeed , not the season for out - door sketching ; yet an hour of fine weather would come occasionally , and he transferred to his portfolio a number of rapid and , it must be allowed , masterly views in which the water - fall dashed and foamed over its moss - grown rocks , and the bare trees bending over it added grandeur to the scene . Hippolyta 's garden , lying on the hillside and green as an Alpine meadow , could not well be omitted ; nor a gable of the cottage , although it stood back from the cascade , and was visible only at one point of sight . The young lady was not always at home when these sketches were taken ; but Rupert , who , like all artists , had something of the gipsy in him , would go up at the back of the cottage and humbly demand from old Dolores , the nurse or housekeeper , a glass of milk to quench his thirst . Dolores saw him about the place , and did not mind ; while his petition , delivered in a matter - of - fact tone and without hesitating , seemed to imply that it was customary . She gave the milk and said nothing about it to her mistress . But as he happened once to be standing at the door in his vagrant attitude , taking slow draughts of that beverage , Hippolyta came running out in quest of Dolores , and on seeing him changed colour and looked confused . She drew back , and tried to cover her confusion with a laugh ; but it did not serve , and she had to look another way while she begged him to come into the house and rest for a few moments . No , he would not do that ; but would she deign to criticise the sketch he was making of the waterfall in this rainy light ? He could not satisfy himself that it looked natural , and the opinion of one who had seen the cascade at all hours would be of service to him . Hippolyta was always ready to be of service to anybody ; she threw on a shawl , and went down the steep pathway which led to the water 's edge . Rupert , all thanks and eagerness , made her observe the clear yellow light that was filling the sunset heavens , how it spread above the waterfall and irradiated the high branches and slender tracery over their heads , throwing a tawny reflection from the opening to their left upon the pure white foam which crowned the falling torrent . Then he showed her what he had made of it ; and she , who could find nothing to criticise,—for it was an admirable sketch , — praised it and him , of course in his artistic capacity , which resulted on his part in a momentary fit of intoxication . She knew the waterfall in all its aspects , and was beguiled into talking about them , even leading him to an upper walk where he might see how the Yale formed its tiny rapids ere it plunged down the rocks . Glanville hearkened respectfully , took out his pencil and dashed down a line or two , declared that she was endowed with the eye of an artist and ought to take lessons in painting , and would have lingered till nightfall had not Hippolyta quietly observed that she must go back to her bread - baking or the batch would spoil , and sped away like a roe - deer , leaving him the helpless victim of her charms . He could not but come again and complete the sketch . Hippolyta saw him from her window as he sat in front of the waterfall . She hesitated a while , and then went down through the garden , and gave him a commission for Lady May. This little action took no time to speak of , and Hippolyta returning to the house was seen no more by Rupert . Yet he walked to the village where he had left his horse , and rode on to Trelingham in a state of singular happiness . He rehearsed his commission openly and unabashed ; if Lady May had an answer to send he could take it , for he was going the same way to - morrow . And it became an understood thing that Glanville intended to exhibit a landscape , in which the cascades of the Yale would be introduced , during the course of that year . At Trelingham , in spite of her untutored ways , Hippolyta was everybody 's favourite , unless I am to except Lady May. She came often , as the Earl desired ; and her bearing was so frank and gentle that even the censorious neighbours , who were shocked when they heard that she had been '
95425	95527	95757	95757	I	0	' by Lady Alice 's brother , began to admit that Miss Valence , though a perfect savage in her habits , was interesting . Not , indeed , that many of them came across her . She begged hard to be introduced as little as possible , and saw only those chance visitors from whom she could not get away in time . When she was thus held captive she spoke hardly at all , but her silence showed that she was attending , and more than one imposing and frivolous matron found in Hippolyta 's dumbness a check upon the '
95531	95543	95757	95757	I	0	' to use Fluellen 's excellent phrase , which passes current as '
95547	95738	95757	95757	I	0	' and is thought the proper subject - matter of a morning call . Poor Hippolyta , she was much to be pitied ! She did not mean to be silent ; she was overwhelmed at the kind of conversation on which people fed their minds . Was the great world , which gave laws to the rest of mankind , and boasted of its blood , and wealth , and intellect , so like that deafening house which she had once entered in the Zoological Gardens where parrots and cockatoos scream all day long , and each bird sharpens its beak on iron wire ? Most of the ladies , she thought , and Tom Davenant would have agreed with her , had very hard mouths . For want of practice she could not vie with them , and she sat and listened in blank amazement . But she had been taught to observe , and she perceived that the inmates of Trelingham Court were unlike their visitors . She said to Glanville , whom she often found at her elbow when she turned round to make a remark , '
95794	95811	95812	95812	You	0	' she concluded , smiling at him in a way he did not think of resenting . '
95817	95821	95812	95812	You	0	' he said ; '
95866	95867	95860	95861	Lady May	244	' '
95939	95940	95949	95950	the Countess	5855	' '
95945	95946	95949	95950	the Countess	5855	' '
95952	95958	95949	95950	the Countess	5855	' said Hippolyta , laughing ; '
95999	96000	95989	95989	her	5855	' '
96006	96010	95989	95989	her	5855	' thought Glanville , '
96040	96149	96150	96150	You	2453	' In which philosophic inference , not communicated to Miss Valence , but the fruit of observation , we shall perhaps see that Rupert was justified . The only drawback to his contentment was that Ivor did not write ; while if Hippolyta was not always happy , she ascribed it , in Lord Trelingham 's hearing , to the fact that her father had sent only a laconic message when she told him of her new friends , to the effect that she might please herself in the matter . He subjoined , it is true , a hasty postscript , but it contained merely these words , '
96161	96781	96782	96782	You	2454	' This was not all she wanted by any means ; although the Earl , resolved upon looking at things in a Christian light , took it as a concession and bade her not lose heart . He did not inquire where Colonel Valence was ; and though she wrote frequently , she neither spoke of his doings nor expressed anxiety for his return . No one could suppose that she did not love her father ; but , though impressionable , her nerves had been schooled from the first , and the Colonel 's uncertain and wandering life was too familiar an experience to make her uneasy . Still , she was alone in the world,—a perilous situation for a maiden of nineteen . Adviser she had none ; her Spanish relatives , if such existed , did not come within reach of her ; nor were the Trelingham family , however amiable , of the kind to influence one who had been educated on principles which the Earl abhorred , and which Lady May , in spite of her varied accomplishments and real intellect , could not have understood . It can hardly be questioned , indeed , that if Lord Trelingham had realised how far they were from being abstract theories , and what a bearing they had on life , his compassion for Hippolyta would have been vanquished by his dread of their contagion . Rupert was destined to know a little more of them . It was that difficult time of day , for an artist in a country - house , which begins somewhere about four o'clock in winter and lasts till the dinner - bell puts an end to it , when Glanville , who had been at work in the Great Hall since morning , and felt so tired that he did not know what to do with himself , entered the many - windowed drawing - room which was then empty , and walking across its wide expanse , threw himself into one of the cushioned embrasures where he could lie at ease and look out at the sea beyond . An immense wood - fire was burning on the hearth , and Rupert , to get away from the blaze , had chosen a window as far from it as possible , drawing the heavy velvet curtains about him so as to be screened and comfortable . He soon grew tired of watching the misty waters ; his eyes closed , and the young man fell into an innocent and refreshing sleep . How long his slumber continued is immaterial to the story ; but it was broken in upon by the sound of voices at no great distance , and as he slowly came back to himself he heard an animated conversation sustained by the three ladies , who , though not resembling the withered hags of fable , were weaving his destiny among them . It was dark on the terrace ; but through the aperture of the curtains he could observe the flickering light of the wood - fire and the figures seated near it,—Lady May with a cup in her hand , sitting upright and addressing Karina , who was in the act of laying a book on the sofa where she half reclined . Hippolyta , buried in the depths of a huge arm - chair , was looking straight into the flames , but , as her expression showed , had an ear for the discussion that was going on . Animated it certainly was ; with less refinement of manner it would have appeared a downright quarrel . Lady May was speaking . '

96971	96978	96968	96968	I	0	' answered Lady May very decidedly , '

97604	97608	97591	97592	Jean Jacques	417	' said Hippolyta , '

97674	97680	97685	97685	you	2371	' said the Countess ; and '
97688	97729	97685	97685	you	2371	' said Lady May. They were both interested ; but Lady May was somewhat doubtful as to the propriety of revelations which , innocent enough on the lips of Miss Valence , might confirm the Countess in her evil ways . '
97740	97749	97737	97737	I	0	' said Hippolyta with a smile at Lady May. '
97807	98143	98144	98144	I	0	' Thus far the listener behind the curtain had felt assured that he should only terrify a peaceful company of ladies by appearing in their midst from his place of concealment . But now he was in a frightful dilemma . To escape unobserved was impossible , to stay where he found himself was still more impossible . He looked across at the doors . They might as well have been a thousand miles off ; neither to the one nor the other could he get without passing the ladies who occupied that side of the room in force . He thought , as desperate men will , of impossible alternatives — of opening the heavy window , and getting out on the terrace ; but that , too , meant noise and discovery . If only it had been the French window lower down ! There is a fate in these things . Instant decision alone could save him , and to decide instantly was out of the question . Hippolyta had begun ; he did not know what to do ; he must remain there imprisoned and trust to a kindly Providence to interpose in his favour . Some one might come in , or the ladies might depart without knowing they had had an auditor . He closed his eyes , but sleep would not come , even if , which I take leave to doubt , it had been seriously invoked . After all , Rupert was human ; he had resolved that Hippolyta should be his , and nothing he might hear would shake his resolution . These confidences must have come after marriage ; there was no great harm in hearing them before . Thus he argued , listening the while to Hippolyta 's voice , which sounded in his ears like an evening bell in the distance , full of dreaming melody . For even now he was not thoroughly roused , though sleep had fled from him . '

Hippolyta was not crying , but her subdued tones were full of pathos ; and as if the last words had stirred recollections which she could not trust herself to utter , she became silent for two or three minutes , while the Countess and Lady May exchanged glances of surprise . Here was a revelation . Miss Valence was a gentlewoman , then , only by courtesy ; for her father had renounced his station and her mother had none to renounce . '
99151	99155	99159	99160	the people	2533	' she resumed , '

100759	100896	100749	100749	he	250	' Hippolyta was inwardly amused . The Countess 's tender idyll was no secret to her ; but whether she thought it should be realised in the golden age she would not say . A long pause followed . Glanville , his mind filled with conflicting thoughts , irritated , yet more in love than ever , was hardly conscious that he might be discovered at any moment , and that the consequences would be dreadful . During the conversation , which had absorbed all their attention , the ladies had neglected to tend the fire , and it was dying down into dull white ashes , with a spark here and there glowing out of them . The sensitive Karina , usually wrapt in furs , began to shiver and look round for the explanation . '
100901	100905	100899	100899	May	244	' she cried , '
100941	100942	100943	100943	We	2582	' '
100949	100962	100943	100943	We	2582	' replied her cousin , to which Rupert mentally added an amen . '
100986	100996	100983	100984	my dear	5845	' she continued , taking Hippolyta by the hand , '
101040	101307	101308	101308	You	2590	' Rupert strained his eyes through the curtains , and held his breath while the ladies were moving towards the door . They were very slow , for they had shawls and wrappers to collect in the semi - darkness ; and it was not until the open door allowed a gleam of light to come in from the hall that they could see what they were doing . At last , at long last , they went . Glanville gave a sigh of relief ; he waited a moment till the coast was clear , and then pulling the curtains aside , rose and stretched himself . He felt extremely tired and not a little excited . It was about time he said , that this strange conversation had ended , for he could not have endured either his cramped position or the thought of eavesdropping much longer . And with these words he grasped the handle of the door . At the same moment he felt some one turning it from the outside . Aghast , he staggered back , the door opened , and Hippolyta came running in . As the light fell full upon Rupert , standing like a lost man in front of her , she stopped and put her hands to her breast . A nervous woman would have screamed , a silly one would have fainted ; but Hippolyta , possessed of the rare courage which answers at call , did neither . Her eyes met those of the artist , steadily , inquiringly . He was dead silent . '
101316	101327	101308	101308	You	2590	' she said . He replied in a faint voice , '
101341	101352	101333	101333	I	0	' She blenched , but kept looking at him still . '
101364	101370	101357	101357	I	0	' was the low answer . '
101373	101386	101357	101357	I	0	' she said , with the greatest agitation in voice and manner , '
101395	101412	101391	101391	you	2590	' and as she spoke she turned from him . He caught her by the sleeve . '
101416	101427	101428	101428	Hippolyta	394	' he cried in a tone of the deepest love ; '
101434	101769	101432	101432	you	0	' She plucked her sleeve from him and was gone . He heard her step on the stairs , but he dared not follow . He was so overcome that he leaned against the wall to recover himself . Was he ashamed or exultant , struck with remorse or full of hope and courage ? He was all these at once . For the notions that Hippolyta had learned from her father he cared not a jot . Hers was a soul that turned them all to favour and to prettiness ; she believed them because they seemed noble in her eyes and came with authority from the being she most revered . That she had laid bare her very innermost heart in speaking with Lady May and the Countess he was certain . She could never have been so frank with him , even though he stood in the place of a declared lover . He despise Hippolyta ! Good heavens , why could he not this instant follow her and fall at her feet ? But the die was cast . She had no choice now but to understand . He would speak that evening , if it were possible ; to - morrow , at any rate . He had meant to wait a little for fear of alarming the bird ere it was caught in the snare ; but events had proved too much for him . He must venture all , and , if necessary , venture again and again . While he stood absorbed in meditation the first dinner - bell sounded , and awoke him to the things of earth . He ran upstairs with a quicker step than usual , wishing that for the next four and twenty hours society and all that it inherit could be dissolved , leaving him and Hippolyta to be their own universe . At the bottom of his heart he doubted her love as little as he doubted his own . '
101776	101781	101784	101784	Hippolyta	394	' he repeated mechanically ; '
101794	102639	102640	102641	Miss Valence	367	' He hardly knew what he was doing , and made sad havoc among his dressing things during the next half - hour . The fingers were hot and trembling with which he fumbled at his neckcloth ; he took up this and that which were nothing to his purpose , looked about the room for what he held in his hand , had just sense enough not to attempt shaving — which , had he begun , this chronicle might speedily have been ended — and was not in any way ready when the second bell resounded in his ears . He came in as the rest were seated round the dinner - table , and took his place , which the fates had willed should be next to Hippolyta . He seemed distraught , but I regret to say that his distraction did not originate in a feeling of shame for what had happened . This honourable man , who for a long hour had listened behind a curtain to conversation which was not intended for any man 's ears , could be scarcely said to remember where he had passed the afternoon . Some remnant of grace hindered him from directing his eyes towards Hippolyta . He knew very well , notwithstanding , both how she looked and what flowers she wore in her beautiful golden hair . He knew that she felt as uncomfortable and as happy as he did ; that the slight quiver in her voice when she spoke — and she said but little — had infinite meanings ; that her shyness equalled his , although it was better concealed ; and when dinner was drawing to an end he absolutely looked up and met the tremulous smile on her lips with the shadow of an answering smile upon his own . The Earl , unconsciously , was very good to them . Knowing Hippolyta 's unwillingness to say much in the presence of strangers , he had invited her on a day when the family were alone ; and as she appeared to be still in terror he acted like a considerate host , and spoke of things indifferent which required no answering , or narrated incidents out of his own past , and had the gratification of seeing the young lady 's eyes bent on him while he discoursed . For no reward in the world would she have ventured to address Rupert except in monosyllables . Once , I say , she met his gaze , and her lips fashioned themselves unwillingly into a smile . But that over , she was glad to escape ; and when the gentlemen entered the drawing - room Glanville learned that Miss Valence had been too much fatigued to stay up , and was departed to her slumbers . His apology , his declaration of love or war , must wait until the moon came out of the clouds again . But Hippolyta had not gone home ; that was his comfort . He should see her in the morning . She appeared at breakfast ; was tongue - tied as on the previous evening , and exceedingly careful not to address the young man , whose courage , dashed for a moment by her silence , revived when he looked upon her calm and beautiful face . She was agitated by no inward trouble , only absorbed and mastered . Could it be that she thought he would not speak ? He waited to hear of the arrangements for the day . Hippolyta , still pleading fatigue , asked that the expedition they had planned might be put off till the afternoon , or till her next visit . Rupert was exultant . If she stayed in the house or in the Park he would find his opportunity . And so it came to pass . The other ladies went out riding . Miss Valence sat in the morning - room , where the lights were pleasant until mid - day , and a cheerful fire was burning . She had drawn her chair to the window , and was writing at a small desk , bending over which her figure was visible to any one that came that way along the terrace . Glanville walked about in the air , trying to collect his thoughts and cool the fever which ran in his veins ; but , crisp as was the morning , and cold and clear in the stinted sunshine the aspect of the distant waters , he could not bring down his high - beating pulse . And when he had passed by the window where Hippolyta sat more times than he could reckon , he summoned up heart of grace , and walked boldly into the hall . In another moment he was by her side . Hippolyta , in her extreme agitation on seeing him there , stood up and had not a word to say . They both coloured violently . '
102643	102686	102640	102641	Miss Valence	367	' he began ; he could get no further . She did not know how to rebuke or to encourage him , or which of the two she meant . He waited until she resumed her seat , then began once more . '
102693	102708	102688	102688	I	0	' he said , in the lowest tones of a passion - stirred voice . '
102748	102755	102756	102756	you	367	' he said , bursting out , '
102781	102782	102770	102770	I	0	' '
102788	102808	102809	102809	I	0	' she asked , with her quick sense of the entanglement into which this eloquent lover had got himself . '
102820	102843	102812	102812	I	0	' But the taunt would not serve . Rupert was in too serious a mood to be laughed out of his passion . '
102847	102851	102852	102852	you	367	' he cried ; '
102911	103032	102907	102907	you	367	' Her face was burning . She grasped the edge of the writing - table to steady herself . Which way to turn she did not know , but it seemed to her that unless she made a resolute effort she should fall off the chair fainting . Rupert stood looking down on the ground , motionless and silent . The murmur of the waves came , like the sound of bells in the air , faint and musical , athwart the stillness ; and neither of them spoke . Slowly , however , Hippolyta gathered up her strength as if for a supreme effort . She said to Rupert in a steady voice where no vibration betrayed her feeling , '
103043	103060	103062	103062	you	242	' He raised his eyes . She seemed perfectly mistress of herself as she went on , '
103071	103072	103065	103065	you	242	' '
103076	103080	103065	103065	you	242	' he exclaimed , '
103108	103109	103101	103102	any one	5901	' '
103169	103170	103157	103157	they	5873	' '
103179	103185	103172	103172	I	0	' returned Glanville with eagerness . '
103212	103213	103188	103188	you	0	' '
103217	103231	103188	103188	you	0	' she answered , as if the notion had not occurred to her , '
103272	103273	103266	103266	I	0	' '
103280	103284	103266	103266	I	0	' he cried ; '
103357	103407	103408	103408	I	0	' And then , in few words , he told her how he had fallen asleep and what happened afterwards . She listened to him gravely , and as though waiting for the conclusion he would draw from her yesterday 's avowal . It was not long in coming . '
103418	103423	103459	103459	you	0	' were his words , '
103486	103548	103473	103473	You	0	' He drew nearer as he spoke , and the great flame of his affection seemed to be rushing about her and hiding the whole world in its divine radiance . In her own mind she had surrendered already ; what was there to oppose to Rupert 's vehemence and sincerity ? But still , she would have a clear understanding . '
103578	103579	103571	103571	you	0	' '
103647	103685	103686	103686	Rupert	242	' His vehemence made him gasp for breath . Hippolyta rose and put her hand in his . The maiden 's eyes were glowing with soft light ; the flush on her countenance was beautiful to see . '
103688	103707	103708	103708	Rupert	242	' she said . Then she too paused an instant . How he waited for the next word ! '
103741	103763	103739	103739	yours	242	' He took her other hand in his with a convulsive grasp . But she drew herself away , and continued , '
103847	103848	103834	103834	You	242	' '
103852	103856	103834	103834	You	242	' said Glanville , '
103890	103891	103881	103881	I	0	' '
103898	103903	103879	103879	Hippolyta	367	' was her answer : '
103964	103965	103966	103966	I	0	' '
103974	104016	103968	103968	you	367	' he said ; and there his great joy overcame him . The strong man broke down . Hippolyta was much affected . With a charming mixture of affection and timidity she laid her hand on his arm and said bashfully , '
104047	104822	104823	104823	My	0	' She laughed very softly , with the tenderest playfulness in her accents . Rupert caught her in his arms and for a single moment held her there . But she slipped away from him , and , leaving her unfinished letter on the desk , fled out of the room . Such was Rupert Glanville 's engagement with Hippolyta Valence . When they met again in private , which by favour of the gods happened that very afternoon , it was decided that they should keep their promises secret until Hippolyta gave permission to make them known . This was not Rupert 's proposal , or entirely his wish ; for he felt , with reason , that he could not have a better defence against Lady May , nor put forward a more intelligible excuse for his change of conduct towards her , than to announce the engagement . But Hippolyta , to whom he did not speak of the Earl 's daughter , was apprehensive that a premature disclosure of what had taken place would thwart her efforts to bring about a reconciliation between the families . She knew how great was Lady May 's influence over Lord Trelingham ; neither had she waited until now to discover that something in the nature of an enthusiastic friendship , perhaps of love , existed on her side which had not been returned by Rupert . She would be a rival , sooner or later , — unsuccessfully , no doubt , but a rival still,—for the hand of the artist . That need not signify once Hippolyta had brought the Earl and her father into some sort of agreement . But meanwhile , secrecy appeared to her an absolute part of discretion . She was not afraid of losing Rupert , his love would protect him , and she had been too well used to deny herself pleasant things , and therefore knew how to be patient . The gentleman , in that submissive state which lasts till he reaches the altar , and ceases as if by magic when he is returning down the church after certain words have been spoken , yielded uncomplainingly . He was glad enough to have an assurance of possessing Hippolyta at whatever time and under such circumstances as she , in her wisdom , might determine . You never saw a mountain - pard so tamed by kindness , so subdued and willing to follow the hand that led him along , as this fiery , clear - eyed , tender - hearted Rupert . His best friends , always excepting Ivor Mardol , would not have known him as he stood humbly attendant on the behest of his newly - found mistress . Might he tell Ivor ? he inquired . Hippolyta reflected for a while , and answered between a smile and a sigh that she did not doubt his friend , but it would be as well to let nobody hear of it besides her father . To him she was writing by the next post . So these two , opening the gates of Elysium , went down into its heathery dells and fresh green woodlands side by side . They had found one another amid the wastes of the world , and might ramble where it pleased them in a golden dream . They loved with the ardour of youth and the intensity of exceptional natures . Hippolyta 's strange education had kept her innocent of the thousand artificialities which too often spoil the best of women , making them helpless , sentimental , or false , when they desire to be brave and true . She was the most loyal of human beings ; her temperament was steeped in poetry , and the sweet impulses of the heart gave her slightest words a fascination . But where she loved she could not be sentimental ; and Glanville , who had sometimes felt wearied with Lady May 's — how shall I call it?—too great effusiveness , was delighted with a companion at once so charming and so sensible . She told him much of her earlier life and her father 's character and principles . To Rupert Colonel Valence seemed an enigma . He did not comprehend how a man who had professed such a hopeless creed as he had gathered from the Colonel 's lips in the churchyard at their first and only meeting could spend his life in forwarding Utopian schemes . But Hippolyta , when this difficulty was urged , had much to say in explanation . '
104826	104830	104856	104856	he	5872	' she remarked , '
104940	105068	105069	105069	I	0	' — she laughed and looked at Glanville , who was delighted to be so mocked—'we shall still be face to face with the terrible unknown powers that we can neither control nor appease . So my father says . But is that any reason , he asks , why we should tolerate kings and kaisers ? Thus he combines the deep melancholy , which seems to grow upon him every year , with a burning zeal and such incessant activity as will not suffer him to stay at home . I feel it , but I would not hinder him from being noble . My husband , when I have one , must be father and mother too . Will he , Rupert , think you ? '
105165	105169	105171	105171	Hippolyta	367	' rest of them '
105364	105369	105371	105372	Mr. Truscombe	255	' I must confess , '
105381	105402	105371	105372	Mr. Truscombe	255	' that I have never had patience with the ultra - sceptics who look upon King Arthur as a myth : '
105550	105571	105572	105572	You	2644	' Glanville listened to the worthy man in respectful silence ; and when he had concluded took up his parable . '
105579	105583	105572	105572	You	2644	' he said , '
105684	105685	105674	105682	a real personage of the fifth or sixth century	2650	' '
105695	105700	105674	105682	a real personage of the fifth or sixth century	2650	' interrupted Mr. Truscombe ; '
105715	105716	105674	105682	a real personage of the fifth or sixth century	2650	' '
105720	105724	105674	105682	a real personage of the fifth or sixth century	2650	' said Glanville ; '
105841	105855	105837	105837	Joseph	426	' The company was disposed to laugh , but not so Mr. Truscombe . '
105860	105864	105837	105837	Joseph	426	' he said , '
105902	105940	105886	105886	I	0	' Glanville , who saw that he was on the very edge of an abyss into which next moment the erudite but fantastic Mr. Truscombe would drag him down , hastened to save himself by timely admissions . '
105943	105947	105886	105886	I	0	' he said , '
106022	106023	106020	106020	Arthur	245	' '
106035	106069	106027	106027	you	0	' inquired Hippolyta , who was interested and forgot her timidity while she was speaking . But she knew her face was burning when she had got the words out of her mouth . '
106075	106079	106027	106027	you	0	' replied Glanville ; '
106271	106272	106262	106262	I	0	' '
106277	106286	106274	106274	I	0	' said Mr. Truscombe in his deep voice ; '

106317	106322	106310	106311	King David	356	' Glanville went on , '
106550	106551	106544	106544	I	0	' '
106561	106566	106555	106555	you	2673	' said the Countess . '
106670	106679	106667	106667	I	0	' she said , speaking to Lady May ; '
106694	106695	106667	106667	I	0	' '
106700	106705	106667	106667	I	0	' answered Lady May , '
106726	106727	106728	106728	I	0	' '
106734	106739	106728	106728	I	0	' said the artist , '
107021	107484	107541	107541	you	242	' Mr. Truscombe was somewhat too literal to follow the artist , and would now have been glad to ask whether he believed in a real King Arthur or held him to be a coinage of the brain . But , somehow , Glanville 's eloquence daunted the antiquarian . He was fain , therefore , to take up the nearest of the drawings , which represented a pirate ship disembarking its mailed hordes , and to put a few searching questions on the subject of chain armour , regarding which he was the first authority in Europe . Glanville replied ; and the others looked at his designs . On so genial a day , when the sun was bright and warm , indoors and out seemed equally alluring . The party scattered,—some remaining in the study to discuss the drawings point by point , others lingering about the verandah , or going down to the boats and paddling round the chalet , which on every side presented a different but agreeable aspect . While they were thus occupied Rupert invited Hippolyta to ascend the watch - tower . She looked round for a companion , but every one was busy , and she ran gaily up the stairs with him . The watch - tower was empty , and the great window gave a delightful view of the long gorge with its waving woods , the meandering silver thread which marked the course of the Yale , and the clear - shining waters with a circle of clouds above them which closed in the scene . Side by side Rupert and Hippolyta stood , without uttering a word , in that most intimate of companionships which would be lessened , not added to , by speaking . Their cup was full , was brimming over . Happiness had come to them and seemed willing to stay . The breeze which fanned their cheeks , the light which rested lovingly upon their heads and appeared to caress them , was intoxication enough . They could have remained silent thus and lost in a delicious sense of their nearness to one another had not some movement on the waters below them broken the spell . It was only Tom Davenant mooring his outrigger at the steps . Glanville smiled , and , as if remembering the purpose that had brought him , went to a chest of drawers in the room , and taking thence a square sheet of paper , as it would seem , returned to Hippolyta and held it before her . The young lady looked , drew back a little to see the object more clearly , and took it in her hand with an exclamation of delight . '
107488	107492	107541	107541	you	242	' she cried , '
107499	107504	107495	107495	you	242	' He laughed mischievously . '
107520	107521	107518	107518	Hippolyta	367	' '
107524	107532	107518	107518	Hippolyta	367	' she said in a lower tone ; '
107568	107569	107558	107558	you	242	' '
107640	107641	107638	107638	Hippolyta	367	' '
107650	107654	107644	107644	you	242	' she whispered , '
107685	107686	107677	107677	I	0	' '
107723	107724	107712	107712	you	242	' '
107730	107738	107726	107726	I	0	' she said , with great calmness . '
107753	107761	107746	107746	You	5663	' She was laughing to herself slightly . '
107769	107774	107764	107764	I	0	' said Glanville pettishly , '
107797	107802	107789	107790	the wretch	2690	' Hippolyta became interested . '
107811	107815	107805	107805	you	5663	' she asked . '
107846	107847	107832	107832	he	2690	' '
107854	107855	107849	107849	he	2690	' '
107875	107922	107864	107864	he	2690	' When Hippolyta heard these words she became very quiet . She was thinking whether to leave matters as they stood , or explain them to Rupert . When she had made up her mind she said , with her eyes fixed on her own portrait , '
107933	107934	107924	107924	you	2690	' '
107940	107944	107935	107935	I	0	' answered Rupert . '

107991	107995	107967	107967	I	0	' she said , '

108382	108386	108370	108370	I	0	' said Glanville ; '

108418	108422	108401	108410	the most lovely woman I had ever set eyes on	2716	' she answered . '
108453	108459	108451	108451	me	0	' she went on meditatively , '
108481	108505	108508	108508	I	0	' He held up his hand , as if to threaten her , but she motioned him to keep still , and continued , '
108549	108557	108558	108559	The Earl	252	' They heard Tom Davenant calling Rupert . '
108563	108572	108558	108559	The Earl	252	' he said , as they came downstairs . '
108623	108667	108616	108616	She	5855	' On entering the studio they found the party collected round Rupert 's drawings , and Madame de Lutenieff in earnest conversation with her cousin . She at once came to the artist , and with enthusiasm in her accents said to him , '
108692	108693	108683	108683	I	0	' '
108704	108709	108694	108694	I	0	' he answered gallantly , '

It would be an original and quaint device , but without Glanville 's aid in designing dresses and sketching the groups it could not be carried out . How did it strike him ? Instead of answering like a sensible young man , Rupert turned demurely to Miss Valence and inquired what she thought . She laughed , and blushed , but would not reply beyond saying that in these matters she had no opinion to give . '

109435	109445	109431	109431	you	242	' she asked with comic anxiety . Hippolyta answered , '
109503	109504	109490	109490	I	0	' '
109508	109513	109514	109514	you	242	' said the Countess ; '
109537	109538	109534	109534	his	242	' '
109545	110257	109539	109540	Mr. Glanville	242	' replied the infatuated artist . He had never till then thought of dancing with Hippolyta . What a heaven of happiness was in store ! How admirable of the Countess to propose it and of Tom Davenant to come of age just at that time ! To get any further conversation of a sensible kind from Rupert was for the rest of the day impossible . The Countess made her observations ; Lady May , whose suspicions had been lulled to sleep , was not blind , and began once more to feel the gnawing pangs of jealousy ; while Mr. Davenant wondered that people should care so much about tiring themselves to death in a hot and crowded assembly , and would have given all the balls between now and next year for a good day 's fishing . But the dress ball was decided on , and there were to be tableaux representing King Arthur and his Table Round . In proposing , out of her own head , a dress ball at which Miss Valence should be present , the Countess Lutenieff was carrying out one of those schemes , so dear to the impish character she affected , through which accidents of a perverse kind are wo nt to happen . She was not very learned or large - minded ; and , like most ignorant persons of a quick - witted turn , she was subtle , preferring always the crooked path to the straight , and delighted when she could imagine that she made the puppets dance to her playing . Since she had recovered from the shock of her husband 's death — it had taken her about six months , for she was of an affectionate disposition — her one aim had been to marry Tom Davenant , whom from a child she had worshipped . This alone reconciled her to the English sky with its everlasting gray tones , and the English manners at once so selfsatisfied and so chilling . But Mr. Davenant was a shy bird , and would not stoop at her call . Nor had she a falconer 's voice to lure him back again from his pursuit of more interesting prey . He , like the rest of the Davenants , was guided by a fine sense of honour,—too fine thought the Russian lady , since it appeared to be driving him on a marriage with his cousin . And its recompense might possibly be the hand of Lady May in spite of the six years which divided their ages . Nothing , said Karina to herself , will make me secure on that side but a violent passion on the part of Lady May for some one who is not Tom Davenant . Might not Glanville be the man ? She had hoped and prayed so while the painting went on in the picture - gallery ; but that was now at an end . The artist seemed to be dominated by a fresh sentiment in which Lady May had no part , and as Tom 's birthday drew near , bringing with it apprehensions of calamity , the Countess sat down to consider what could be done . If Glanville was not desperately in love elsewhere he would fall a sure victim to her cousin , provided that May Davenant cared to subdue him . And how make her care ? A great passion , Karina had read in her French authors , is only a slight one thwarted by a great difficulty . Add jealousy to liking and the thing might be done . Whatever else was uncertain , it could not be doubted that May cared for Glanville more than she did for Tom Davenant . If she married her cousin , it would be from devotion to the name and ancient descent she had been taught to revere . Let her be infatuated about the artist , and her refusal of the cousinly hand would follow as a matter of course . Miss Valence had entered from the side - scene , therefore , just when she was wanted , and her cue , in the language of the drama , was '
110263	111035	109539	109540	Mr. Glanville	242	' To promote that feeling in the breast of Lady May was now her cousin 's dearest wish , her hourly and daily thought . The dress ball seemed to her an inspiration of some good genius . There would be much preparation , and at Trelingham a great deal of rehearsing — so to call it — with these original costumes , which would need to be carefully designed . And when the intimacy of the preparations had stung Lady May like a gadfly , the ball itself was to do the rest . She would see Rupert with Hippolyta . She would be mad with disappointment and jealousy , above all if her attention were directed that way ; and when her feeling had reached that height — good - bye to Cousin Tom , concluded the Countess ; he will speak only to be repulsed . Thus she thought , much musing ; and the unconscious puppets fell into their places , and waited till she should pull the wires to begin their exhibition . One point remained doubtful . Was there really anything between Hippolyta and the artist , and if so , how far had the attraction gone ? To ascertain this was of the last importance . Too little would be as fatal as too much . Miss Valence went about in the most beautiful innocence , quiet and composed , like one that had not a care in the world . When at Trelingham her bearing towards Rupert was cordial and friendly , but disarmed suspicion ; and though the artist was often in the neighbourhood of Falside he never passed its threshold . The truth was that with Glanville 's roaming habits and Hippolyta 's constant ridings unattended at what hour and in which direction she pleased , these young lovers could afford to be on their good behaviour at the Court . They met under every variety of circumstance , and the romance of concealment added not a little to their passion . It was not , however , a very wicked way in them . Colonel Valence had taught his child that she must search into her heart , follow where it loved , and not fear the consequences . Though no reply had come to her letter , she knew he would consent . He must have got beyond the reach of correspondence , she fancied ; that was all . Not long after the ball had been determined on Miss Valence was surprised one afternoon to see the Countess Lutenieff ride up to Falside , enter the library , and ask her dear Hippolyta for a cup of tea . She was all smiles and graciousness , hoping she had not interrupted the interesting work in which Miss Valence was sure to be engaged ; but the lovely air and the absence of Lady May , who was visiting some distant friends for some few days , had tempted her to ride over the moor for a tête - à - tête , which she knew would be delightful . Hippolyta put away her books and papers , made her visitor welcome , and submitted to her fate . She was quick enough to perceive that Karina had laid her plan for an afternoon 's talk , but on what subject or to what end , in so flighty a creature , it was impossible to conjecture . They sat by the open window , which was a bower of exquisite creepers , and looked down the valley over green meadows and cornfields where the blade was springing . Hippolyta waited and wondered . But the purpose which had brought Karina still lay hidden , sharp and cruel as it was , like the sword of Harmodius wreathed in myrtle . She touched many flowers of talk with her light wings , flitted up and down from art to social systems , from women to their dressmakers and the last new thing in female frippery , coming nearer and nearer to the point she had in view , sweeping round it in circles that ever grew narrower . She could be wily and indirect when she chose , although much of her ordinary conversation had the malicious naïveté of a precocious child 's . And thus , without quite knowing how they came to it , Hippolyta found herself discussing Lady May 's opinions on the subject of marriage and her probable destiny . Nothing could be less reserved or affected than the Countess while speaking of her cousin . '
111042	111046	109539	109540	Mr. Glanville	242	' she said , '

111101	111120	111086	111086	I	0	' inquired Hippolyta , languidly . She did not want these sentimental confidences , especially with the Countess . '

111166	111177	111135	111135	You	5845	' said Hippolyta . She would not encourage the Countess . '
111182	111188	111135	111135	You	5845	' answered the other eagerly ; '
111256	111257	111246	111246	she	244	' '
111260	111292	111246	111246	she	244	' said Hippolyta , feeling uncomfortable , though she could not say why . What was all this about ? Had she any interest in it ? She must know more . '
111297	111304	111246	111246	she	244	' she said after a pause . '
111332	111333	111334	111334	I	0	' '
111340	111344	111334	111334	I	0	' replied Karina ; '
111361	111380	111355	111355	you	5845	' Hippolyta 's heart gave a great leap . The sword was out and had gone through her . '
111384	111453	111381	111382	Mr. Glanville	242	' she echoed under her breath . It was impossible to go on . The Countess waited , like some savage beast that sees its victim fascinated at its own first spring from the thicket . But Hippolyta did not mean to let her secret escape . She took in her hand the cup of tea which she had laid down , and went on with an effort , '
111483	111484	111485	111485	I	0	' '
111564	111729	111547	111548	Mr. Davenant	250	' This was overwhelming . The sword now was rifling her heart , turning in the wound it had made . Hippolyta was no woman of the world , and her poor brave defence was nearly at an end . Rupert in love with Lady May ! The room reeled about her ; she could not speak ; she was incapable of thinking . Karina sat still , conscience - stricken at the apparent success of her stratagem , but yet enjoying its success . She had in her that mixture of cruelty and remorse which plays so strange a part in the Russian temperament . She was disgusted with herself ; but nothing in heaven or earth would have stayed her hand now . In this contest Hippolyta was not her match . A pause of some moments ensued , at the end of which Miss Valence in a low unsteady voice , which could scarcely be heard across the table , murmured , '
111746	111747	111740	111740	I	0	' '
111791	111811	111783	111783	he	242	' This was cunningly said , as a compliment , forcible though indirect , to Hippolyta 's own discernment . '
111814	111820	111822	111822	you	2756	' the Countess went on , '
111863	111883	111886	111886	he	242	' Karina forgot , apparently , how often she had left them alone and departed on her own errands . '
111891	111899	111886	111886	he	242	' said Hippolyta with a melancholy smile ; '
111909	111910	111903	111903	he	242	' '
111952	112327	111946	111946	he	242	' Ah , yes , she did know , too well for her peace . It was a dangerous gift that sudden vehement inspiration which made his tongue so eloquent , his imagination so vivid and orginal , after a long interval of silence or depression . She had observed that when Rupert was in the mood any listener would suffice ; all he seemed to need was an audience . The explanation which he gave her one day was plausible , but did not take away the peril . He said that when a man has lived by himself as much as he had done in former years , the necessity for speech becomes from time to time imperious , and it matters not whose is the open ear into which it is poured . He had a whole chapter of curious illustrations to the point , adding merely that he still found himself holding forth to an audience of one without minding whether his silent vis - à - vis were taking in every word he said or falling asleep open - mouthed under its influence . But she was convinced that when he chose to speak his audience would not slumber . Lady May had been charmed ; yes , why should she not ? Before Karina spoke that idea had crossed her mind . But had Rupert been charmed in turn ? How was she to find out ? what was she to think ? Could she ask this chattering , frivolous , mocking lady , who cared little what game her shafts brought down ? But there was no need to ask . Karina went on with her story , founded on fact as we know , but embellished and exaggerated until it seemed that Rupert might have been kneeling at Lady May 's feet , in the guise of a troubadour , imploring her to have pity on a desponding lover . Hippolyta could say little in reply , nor dared to utter that little . If she spoke , she was betrayed . Her utmost effort only succeeded in casting a doubt on Karina 's powers of observation . But the Countess was not to be shaken . '
112336	112340	111946	111946	he	242	' she said , '
112413	112414	112417	112417	you	0	' '
112420	112430	112417	112417	you	0	' said Hippolyta , resolved to withstand this prying . '
112452	112459	112443	112443	she	244	' She spoke hotly and angrily . '
112465	112470	112471	112471	you	5845	' answered the Countess , '
112524	112525	112508	112508	he	242	' '
112538	112547	112526	112526	He	242	' answered Hippolyta , still angry and miserable . '
112557	112558	112550	112550	he	242	' '
112630	112631	112627	112628	Mr. Glanville	242	' '
112641	112653	112632	112632	She	244	' said Hippolyta , irritated into expressing more than was prudent . '
112675	112676	112632	112632	She	244	' '
112679	112695	112697	112697	you	5845	' said the Countess , delighted to see the flame spreading and glowing so warm ; '
112715	112716	112705	112705	you	5845	' '
112725	112726	112719	112719	he	242	' '
112777	112787	112773	112773	Dear	2772	' she said , rising at the last words , '
112871	116822	116830	116830	she	244	' She went off with a light step and a smile of triumph . Miss Valence would do her part . There was affection or ambition on her side , sufficient to make her an excellent rival — a Fair Rosamund to Lady May 's Eleanor . The scheme promised admirably , and she sang little snatches of Russian or French ballads as she cantered along . Whether Hippolyta had been deeply wounded and might bleed to death she did not consider , nor did she care . She was fond of Miss Valence , in that selfish way which people have who like to see beautiful things about them ; fond as she might have been of a lovely flower , or an Arab steed . But she had only one strong human feeling , and that was for no woman . She did mean to marry her cousin ; and she would have immolated a thousand Hippolytas in one holocaust rather than give him up . I will not say that she had roused the demon of jealousy in a heart so innocent , so little accustomed to seek itself or to indulge in malice and evil thoughts , as that of Hippolyta . So great a revolution was not to be accomplished in a day . But she had awakened her victim from a dream of childlike happiness , and , suddenly strking into the chords of her enchanted harp , had turned the music to harsh discords which went on sounding and jangling and would not be still . Colonel Valence had left his daughter without the usual safeguards of conventional religious training , and she had moved among the strange men and women that made her world , free as the weakest or the strongest of them , familiar with much more than the name of sin and moral degradation . For she had witnessed something of the misery upon which her father 's damning argument against the society of to - day was founded . But , truly , as she declared to Lady May , her days had been spent without harm . She harboured no unbecoming thoughts ; she was fearless and free ; nor , until Rupert fixed his eyes upon her , had she known what it was to care for any man save her father . The power of first love is proverbially intense ; and when it comes at once , without warning , to a heart so large as Hippolyta 's , and hitherto so self - contained , it has a depth of sacred purity , of kindling fire . Had she spoken of a consuming passion she would have been better justified than the Countess , who employed such words because they sounded romantic and startling , not for any well - assured knowledge that they were true of Lady May. The Spanish temperament , the unfettered life , the enthusiasm for things demanding sacrifice , the glamour of a devotion , sincere and expressive , on Rupert 's side , must all be remembered , if we would calculate what elements there were for jealousy , watchfulness , and a perplexed yet irresistible love in Hippolyta . She did not doubt the man who had breathed out his soul in passionate utterances before her . Perish the thought , she cried , when it rose from the deeps of her anguish like a phantom and threatened to eclipse the light of heaven . She knew that he was loyal ; but was there full security from the past , or had he so entangled himself in its consequences that he might not hope to be free ? Most men had such a past ; her books told her so , and she could bear to think of it with an equal mind , if the curtain which had fallen over it for Rupert was never to be raised again . But how , if Lady May interposed , if a claim there really was , or an old love with which to be off ere he could be on with the new ? Hippolyta was devoted , but she was likewise proud and generous . She would not be Lady May 's rival should it appear that Rupert , in whatever fashion , had given her a promise , or that his affection was divided . As she came to this resolution her heart sickened within her . She sat motionless , where the Countess had left her by the window , gazing with fixed and meditative eyes over the valley till the moon rose up in the cloudy sky , her hands clasped on her knees , while she thought and thought , and the slow tears began to well up from within and form on the tender eyelashes . She did not know where to look for help . A Christian maiden , she said half - unconsciously , would have prayed for guidance,—whatever prayer was . But she could only resolve to be true and trusting , impartial to Lady May as to Rupert , and not unjust . It was a heavy burden for young shoulders , and the tears that fell at last were exceedingly bitter . Her resolution , all this notwithstanding , held firm . She must ascertain the state of the case , and by that be guided . Until this afternoon she had given no assurance of attending the dress ball , which was a kind of entertainment alien from her feelings and characteristic of that social or aristocratic existence with which she could have so little in common . Rupert 's pleadings even had not overcome her dislike to it ; and the Countess , for all her zeal in the good cause , was obliged to be content with a very conditional acceptance . Now , however , she would take the rôle offered her and appear among the rest . Their frequent meetings , if she studied them with her eyes open , must surely betray the relation in which Rupert stood to Lord Trelingham 's daughter . And if when the birthnight festivities were come her mind was not clear , she would ask Glanville the question , cost what struggling and shame it might . False , no , he was not false . It was easy for a man to be imprudent , but impossible that Rupert did not mean every word he had whispered in her ear . Great as was her trouble , so new and unexpected that it quite overcame her for days together , it left in the depths of her being an assured trust that love had answered love between them twain . As soon as she dared , that is to say when her self - control was somewhat restored , she went over to Trelingham . Lady May had come back , bringing with her Mrs. Davenant , the well - known fashionable personage who called Tom her son , and expected from him a son 's devotion , though she could not give up the world so far as to make Foxholme the pleasant place it should have proved to that amiable young man . She and Lord Trelingham , though of course very old acquaintance , had never got beyond the first stage of intimacy , while Lady May , to whom the frivolities of fashion were odious , was merely civil to her and did not see her more than twice in a season . She had come now to preside over the arrangements for keeping Tom 's birthday and issue the much - coveted invitations which were to gather a numerous party at Trelingham . She , also , was asking herself whether her son had serious thoughts of marrying his cousin ; and it was part of her endeavouring just now to find out the way he had spent these months in the country , with Lady May on the one side and Madame de Lutenieff on the other . For though Tom was an affectionate son he wrote seldom , and there was that in Mrs. Davenant 's character which forbade him to let her see into his heart . There could be no real confidence between persons so unlike , however attached they might be to one another . Tom felt more comfortable at Trelingham than he had ever been under his own roof . He loved his guardian , the Earl , with a simple but earnest devotion , which had increased as the boy grew to man 's estate ; and he looked forward to being perfectly happy with him and Lady May , if the latter would consent to be his wife . He knew she was infinitely beyond him in cleverness and knowledge of the world ; but , if anything , he was attracted rather than repelled by that circumstance . A stupid man , he argued , ought to have a clever wife who would keep him from blundering . He did not think himself unequal to the duties of a country gentleman ; but , should he become Earl of Trelingham , there would be Parliament and the burden of society , and who could help him so well as Lady May ? That he would succeed his cousin if he outlived him was as certain as anything in this world . Lord Trelingham had assured him of it in so many words . It was a piece of eccentric generosity , perhaps of unnecessary frankness . But he had acted towards Tom Davenant during the last five or six years as he would have acted towards his own son ; and it was in keeping with the rest of his conduct to give up Trelingham Court to the festivities which must otherwise have taken place at Foxholme . The house party would be numerous , and was already gathering when Hippolyta called after her sad visit from the Countess . She went through her introduction to Mrs. Davenant without flinching , but was glad to escape into the Great Hall , where a kind of rehearsal for the tableaux was in course of arrangement . Rupert , who had not been able to go near Falside for several days , came to her as soon as she had exchanged a word with Lady May , and was so struck on observing her paleness and the dark rings round her eyes that he could think of nothing else . He drew her away , under pretence of showing her the dresses from which she was to choose , and in low passionate undertones implored her to tell him what was the matter . She could not mistake the feeling in his voice ; it was that of the most devoted love . Her spirits revived ; and , though she put him off with unmeaning answers , there was enough to cheer him in her assurance that she should soon be well . He looked at her with tender anxiety ; he saw that something must have happened . But she had secrets which it did not become him to pry into ; her troubles might be connected with Colonel Valence 's numerous projects , and were not to be removed even by a lover 's assiduity . However , he would not quit her side till she insisted on it ; and his frequent glances towards her revealed a preoccupation which the Countess was delighted to behold , and which , in her careless infantine way , she pointed out to her cousin . Lady May was in her most difficult mood , irritated by the presence of Mrs. Davenant at Trelingham , dissatisfied with Rupert , and not at peace in her own mind . She had not conceived any great affection for Hippolyta ; but now , under the Countess 's malicious guidance , she saw , or thought she saw , enough to justify dislike and suspicion . Was Glanville bestowing elsewhere the love she had striven so desperately to win ? It made her wretched when Miss Valence came near him , when he spoke to her in seeming confidence , when he showed how she must wear the elfin array in which he proposed to deck the Queen of Fairyland , as he smilingly called her . She was to be the Lady of the Lake . All this reacted , according to Karina 's deep - laid plan , on the feelings of Hippolyta . She , too , was made wretched ; for Lady May , resolved on having her will , found means to engage Rupert 's attention , and gave him so many commissions , had such a variety of questions to ask and possibilities to provide for , that the lovers , after their first greeting , met again only for an instant that afternoon . Time was when , if any one had charged May Davenant with being an adept in the arts of jealousy , she would have turned a scornful eye upon the speaker and bade him begone with a proud consciousness of her innocence . Nor am I saying now that she was mean or malevolent ; she was passionate and had forgotten herself , that was all . But was it not a sad falling away on the part of that lofty spirit ? Hippolyta , struck through with Karina 's fiery shaft , suffered and was helpless . She had no arts to counteract the imperious charm of the Earl 's daughter ; and when she beheld Rupert 's embarrassment , how he resisted in vain , nor would look steadily in the face of Lady May , she began to fear that an entanglement really existed , and went home more miserable than she came . Certainly , she might have demanded an explanation from Rupert , and one word would have sufficed to scatter the clouds in her heaven . But it was not the time ; she dreaded an explosion which must have blasted all her hopes , or sent him from Trelingham at this unseasonable moment . The play was to be played out . She took her part bravely ; but as the days went on she became more and more resolute in the thoughts which had begun to ferment within her . That afternoon was a sample of those which followed . Rupert , engaged from morning till night , and often in Lady May 's company , had less time than usual to spend with Hippolyta , and none to mark that her dejection was profound and her paleness increasing . To mark , I say ; for he felt that there was a vague misunderstanding between them , which he meant , as soon as the festival would let him , to have thoroughly cleared up . Lady May , however , was his greatest trial . The intimacy that had so happily fallen through seemed reviving again , and with it a sense of the magnetic danger , so to speak , which had compassed him round about in the picture - gallery . When Hippolyta was present he felt it less ; but then another peril awaited him , for he did not choose that his old sin should be ever staring him in the face , and yet it did . Certain confidential allusions , slight yet speaking glances which might signify nothing in Lady May , but were embarrassing to him , and a demeanour in which friendliness might have the greater share , yet love not be wholly wanting,—he could no more define these things to himself than he could photograph the wind , but he knew that it was not imagination which led him to fear them as the harbingers of catastrophe . What if Hippolyta should notice them too ? He anathematised the folly of six months ago , his weakness when he ought to have been proof against this contagious sentiment . He would certainly at the very earliest quit Trelingham under one pretext or another , and put a solid interval of time between the painting of the Madonna with its mischievous associations and the work he had yet to do . There must be an end of this phantasmal coquetry , this mock sun of love which shone over against the true , and perplexed observers . He little knew the forces against which he was contending . And so , amid fears and hopes and the strong resolutions of those upon whom fortune had laid the burden of a deadly struggle , Tom Davenant 's birthday came . The house was full of guests ; the Chase was thrown open , and the solemn early dinner appointed at which the Earl 's tenantry were to hear their future lord deliver his maiden speech . The bright spring weather , dashed with a shower of rain , was all that could be wished ; and if I do not dwell upon the events of the day , it is not because they deserved no sacred poet , but that one who knew how to adorn his grateful task with flowers of rhetoric to which I may not pretend , has already written of them in the County Chronicle , to the files of which I refer inquiring friends . For I must hasten to the evening , when a more select , but hardly less numerous , company was assembled in the Great Hall , and the tableaux vivants were beginning . Hippolyta , who had accepted Madame de Lutenieff as her chaperon in default of another , descended from her room with beating heart , and was glad to find herself only just in time for her share in the representations . The Countess led her at once to the sort of green - room where the members of the first group were putting themselves in order . A stage had been erected at the end of the Great Hall , opposite the chief entrance . In front of it hung the ample folds of a curtain which was to draw up to the sound of music , when the tableau was arranged and the signal given . The scenes were to be presented at intervals , and to last only so long as might be required to take in their meaning and to distinguish the characters which made them up , for anything like a sensible interruption of the dancing was not proposed , and would have been received with scant favour . Rupert had advised that the grouping should follow the order of his frescoes , including some which were only among his drawings , but not as yet visible on the walls . Thus it began with the Finding of Arthur , when , in the great temple , he draws out of the stone the miraculous sword which has resisted the efforts of all pretenders to the crown of Britain . Tom Davenant , with his exquisite beauty of face and manly form , was the very model of a young hero , and not unnaturally had been compelled , against his will , to put on the trappings of Arthur . A crowd of knights occupied the foreground , behind them rose the dim pillars and vast recesses of a rude cathedral , and near the semblance of an altar stood Hippolyta , the Lady of the Lake , who was Arthur 's fairy godmother , in converse with the mysterious enchanted Merlin . When they were all in their places a silver bell rang , and the curtain drew up . It was a striking scene and called forth instant applause , which was hushed when the orchestra , composed of harps and flutes , began above the great entrance a shrill weird music to celebrate the coming of the King . It was Lady May who had devised this wild welcome , so unlike the harmonies of the modern muse , but for that reason symbolic of far - off ages when the appeal was to elementary passions rather than to a complex temperament like ours of to - day . The effect was strange but overpowering . While it lasted , Hippolyta , who had not ventured to lift her eyes at the beginning , looked up and saw the vast spaces before her filled with a motley crowd , in all manner of fantastic and glittering attire , while a flood of golden light fell upon them from the sides of the hall , where Rupert 's grandly - conceived frescoes , marking out the whole extent they were by and by to cover , added an air of indescribable solemnity and antique grandeur to the vision . Never in her life had she beheld anything so beautiful . It dazzled and excited her ; it gave her a larger sense of existence , palpitating with joy and passion . She could have been content , she thought , to gaze at it without going nearer . But in a few moments the music ceased , the curtain fell , and the Arthurian group , disappearing through the side - scene , was lost in the crowd below . She gave herself into the hands of the Countess and followed . The ball began ; and Hippolyta , with mingled pleasure and dismay , found herself dancing with Rupert , who had instantly claimed her hand . What she saw and experienced that evening , thanks to the novelty of her sensations , the secluded life she had led , the love which was filling heart and brain , the trouble of an uncertain future , and her joy in Rupert 's triumph , it is not easy to describe . It was a whirl of excitement when time seemed short as a lightining flash , yet every moment eternal . The pauses in the dance , the bursts of barbaric music coming between , the delicate strange colours which had been so subtly combined in the grouping , the gleam of saffron and gold , of shining battle - axe and linked armour of steel , the perfume of tropical flowers which hung upon the atmosphere and penetrated her being , the steady blaze of light overhead , the sparkling of precious stones and waving of feathers and soft dark jets of velvet sheen , the sound of bubbling fountains in the conservatories which opened out of the ballroom into the garden beyond , — all this was mingled with laughing voices , with the play of outspread fans , and the movement of a multitude in whose eyes the light and the passion seemed to be reflected and to shine out again more intensely . It was a sea of life on whose waves , to the sound of enchanting music , she floated along . Sometimes Rupert held her hand , sometimes another whom she had never seen , to whom she spoke in dreamy whispers , not knowing what had been said to her . Out of the crowd a face surged up and gazed across inquiringly , as though seeking an answer in her eyes ; but it was gone ere she could catch her breath and murmur , '
116835	117824	116830	116830	she	244	' Or again , it was the Countess , smiling cold , inquisitive , mocking , as her voice floated over her shoulder and bade her rest a while in the shade of the cool ferns . And Rupert , where was he ? She looked round in a vague , sweet trouble , and saw him leading out Lady May , whose earnest eyes seemed full of a steady fire . Could she not warn him , not rescue him from the danger ? No , he was a thousand leagues away , and her hand could never reach him . As these thoughts came to darken the festival her heart beat faster with a sense of unspeakable love and pity . She felt that Rupert was all the world to her , that she could not live except in the sunshine of his presence , that to surrender him would be death . But her meditations were again and again interrupted as one after the other of these brilliant masqueraders came up to solicit the honour of dancing with her . Hippolyta was so wrapt in her passionate griefs and longings that she did not realise the impression she was making in that unknown realm , where faces , voices , manners , were all novel and strange . Miss Valence 's name was whispered from mouth to mouth ; her father 's story , so much of it as the public knew , was rehearsed again . Some , who had heard only of the marriage with Lady Alice , imagined that this was a niece of Lord Trelingham , now publicly adopted by him ; and they wondered whether Tom Davenant would select her or Lady May for his bride . Others felt her beauty enhanced by the uncertain tales of her origin , for no one in that country - side had ever set eyes on her mother or could tell who she was . And the young men declared with enthusiasm that they had never seen such dancing . It was the perfection of unconscious grace , without effort or affectation ; the true Spanish gravity with a world of passion in it ; the movements , slow or swift , as the music demanded , always under control , not wild , but exquisitely self - contained . That evening Hippolyta and the lady of the lake melted into one lovely lissom figure , clad in a floating vestment of dark fairy - green , with golden hair falling down over the collar of wrought flowers which left the delicate throat bare , while a wreath of some strange bloom that resembled hyacinths decked the beautiful head , and gave her the look of sylvan majesty that befitted her in the legend . Nor had the warm paleness of her cheek , the light in her large , soft eyes , ever charmed the heart of Rupert as they did during those hours of dance and thrilling music . He could not turn his gaze from her ; but it seemed to him that she did not always return it . Was she lost in the pleasure of the scene ? He quitted the company among which he was standing , and came , on the pretence that she was wanted for the next tableau , and spoke to her . She answered like one whose fancy was roaming abroad ; she was absent and preoccupied . When they entered the green - room to make some slight changes in her outward adornment which the tableau required , she did all in silence , as she was bid , not turning at the voice that spoke or appearing to distinguish the speaker . She took her place in the group of Launcelot and Guinevere , fixing her eyes , but yet absently , on Lady May , who bore with exceeding stateliness the character of the guilty Queen . Again , at the side of the painted forest , she looked on while the Countess Lutenieff , as the fay Vivien , charmed his secret out of Merlin ; and her feeling was that , in the old white - bearded man , to her a stranger , who enacted the magician 's part , she beheld Rupert yielding to the witchery of a maiden he did not love . When , from the floor of the Great Hall , she watched the scene of Tristram and Iseult , in which Lady May and the artist quaffed the love - philter which was to bind them in unfaithfulness , — a weird and powerful representation that stirred the spectators to demand it a second time,—she could hardly refrain from crying aloud , and the effort made her weak to fainting . She leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes to shut out the displeasing vision . But it would not leave her ; it was still there in vivid colour as on the stage , Iseult holding forth the enchanted golden cup , and Tristram in the glow of his beauty and strength bending over it , his lips couching the beaker 's brim that was to take away his reason for ever . The plaudits which rang through the hall , and were drowned in the strains of music overhead , piercing like the sea - bird 's scream and dying off as into the wash of a sullen sea , made a tumult within her which left no room for thought , which stamped upon her memory an impression that must be indelible , and urged her to resolve her doubts at once , without hesitation . She watched till Rupert came into the throng once more . He was moving her way , and their eyes met . In an instant he was by her side . '
117832	118171	117825	117825	You	2776	' she whispered , and ere long they were moving in the waltz . Her dream came back : she was floating on the waves of life to the sound of a mighty music ; its single tones shot through her like silvery arrows , its complex strains lifted her upon the thunderous roll of waters away and away , with Rupert , the only tenant of her universe , holding her fast . He belonged to her alone , and she was of another sphere than the multitude moving in cadence around them . Still , she did not speak . And lo ! the sudden vibration of a string which , for no more than a second , was heard through the music like a note of lamentation , turned her thoughts and her fancy . She beheld the world of suffering beneath the world of joy : on the barren shores lapped by these smiling waters an innumerable multitude were gathered from the four winds — all the poverty - stricken , the wretched , the homeless , the tear - besprent , the naked misery of those who crowded against one another to keep themselves warm , and who were reckoned by millions upon millions . She saw them clearly , with the mind 's eye , too humbled and cast down to envy the joy they might not share , benumbed in their great misery by the sense of a long despair even more than by frost and cold . The masquerade of life was for the few ; its bitter dismal reality , not tempered by dance or song , for the many . And what was she doing , Hippolyta , amid these splendours ? Her place was not there , but with her brothers and sisters pining in wretchedness . She awoke from the excitement of the evening with a start . The air was suffocating , the perfume of these flowers delirious . She could endure it no longer . '
118176	118187	117825	117825	You	2776	' she said to Rupert as the dance was ending ; '
118204	118354	118355	118355	Rupert	242	' He looked round for the nearest exit , and , with Hippolyta on his arm , moved as swiftly as the crowd would let him towards the conservatories , which opened on either side of the stage into the garden . It would be cooler there . They arrived at a spot where great cactus - like plants , mingled with creepers , stood up in the moonlight which shone through the glass roof with a cold , uncertain gleam . There was no one near . The feeling of comparative solitude refreshed Hippolyta ; and her thoughts began to take a definite shape . Rupert inquired tenderly whether she were better . She smiled , and did not speak for a little while ; then , drawing him close to the window where the plants screened them , she said , laying her hand on his breast , '
118366	118372	118363	118364	Lady May	244	' The question startled him . '
118375	118381	118363	118364	Lady May	244	' he said to himself , '
118388	118396	118363	118364	Lady May	244	' But he would be perfectly open . '
118401	118405	118399	118399	Hippolyta	367	' he answered , '
118431	118432	118428	118428	I	0	' '
118440	118450	118434	118434	you	242	' she asked . She felt an immense relief . '
118453	118457	118434	118434	you	242	' he replied ; '
118469	118470	118434	118434	you	242	' '
118489	118505	118506	118506	I	0	' Rupert , who had not expected this home thrust , turned red and pale . '
118513	118521	118506	118506	I	0	' he answered , though not immediately ; '
118571	118625	118629	118629	Rupert	242	' He tried to explain . Hippolyta did not interrupt him . It was difficult to enlarge on the behaviour of Lady May without attributing to her thoughts of which he had no evidence . When he came to a pause , Hippolyta , still looking at him , put a single question . '
118631	118635	118629	118629	Rupert	242	' she said , '
118638	118650	118629	118629	Rupert	242	' you think Lady may cared for you as I do ? '
118651	118656	118657	118657	he	242	' As you do , '
118662	118698	118699	118699	he	242	' ah , Hippolyta , who is like you in anything ? I do not know ; it is nothing to me what Lady May 's feelings have been . You do not distrust me ? '
118704	118715	118699	118699	he	242	' have I said or done anything to displease you ? '
118716	118719	118720	118720	she	2778	' No , '
118724	118748	118720	118720	she	2778	' you are the same as ever . But suppose she did love you , could you always resist , always remember Hippolyta ? '
118749	118753	118754	118754	he	242	' I see , '
118757	118863	118754	118754	he	242	' you are troubled about it . Very well , I can not blame a jealousy which comes of so great affection . Look here , Hippolyta , I also have been disquieted and not happy in this strange position ; for , though I do not know what she feels , I have an uneasy dread that all may not turn out well . I had made up my mind to leave Trelingham for a month or six weeks , that there might be a break and a fresh start under less difficult circumstances . If you wish I will go to - morrow . '
118864	118874	118875	118875	she	2779	' Are you not wanted here during the festivities ? '
118878	118898	118875	118875	she	2779	' Not in any way . My work is done when the last of the tableaux has been given . '
118972	119007	118955	118955	she	2779	' Go to - morrow , as you propose ; it will be best . Only let me hear from you , and if I have anything to write,—you must give me your address . '
119045	119051	119052	119052	he	242	' Write to my studio , '
119055	119087	119088	119088	he	242	' I shall be there oftener than at home , almost every day , in fact ; and there will be less chance of discovery . But I shall be glad , '
119092	119111	119088	119088	he	242	' when you allow me to end this concealment . It is a trial to both of us . '
119112	119115	119116	119116	she	367	' Yes , '
119142	119150	119152	119152	Rupert	242	' We must return to the ballroom , '
119154	119164	119152	119152	Rupert	242	' I shall be wanted for the next grouping . '
119192	119198	119199	119199	she	5855	' My dear Miss Valence , '
119202	119235	119199	119199	she	5855	' I have been looking for you this quarter of an hour . Here is a message from Falside which I have undertaken to deliver . I hope it is nothing unpleasant . '
119255	119261	119262	119262	she	5855	' My father 's writing , '
119310	119335	119336	119336	She	5855	' I must go home at once . My father is there , and thinks he may have only a few hours with me . '
119410	119418	119419	119419	she	5855	' Good - bye , Mr. Glanville , '
119422	119439	119441	119441	she	5855	' You will have to invent a lady of the lake for the Passing of Arthur , '
120296	120299	120300	120300	he	242	' What ! '
120303	120317	120300	120300	he	242	' you here , Hippolyta , darling ? I am mad or dreaming . '
120345	120357	120358	120358	she	367	' No , you are neither mad nor dreaming , Rupert , '
120362	120375	120358	120358	she	367	' it is Hippolyta , and I thought you would never come . '
120376	120392	120393	120393	he	242	' But you did not write , you sent me no word of your visit , '
120396	120422	120393	120393	he	242	' how could I imagine it ? When did you arrive ? Have you had anything to eat ? What can I get for you ? '
120438	120442	120443	120443	she	367	' Be quiet , '
120446	120495	120443	120443	she	367	' what an excitable person you are ! I have dined , and do not want anything except a cup of tea , which I will make by and by for both of us . You look tired , Rupert , where have you been spending the day ? '
120496	120504	120505	120505	he	242	' Oh , I do n't know , '
120508	120529	120505	120505	he	242	' it matters not . But are you staying in town ? or how is it you come so suddenly ? '
120530	120540	120541	120541	she	367	' I think you must have your tea first , '
120544	120560	120541	120541	she	367	' and then we will talk about it . At present not a word more . '
120576	120584	120586	120586	Rupert	242	' You must let me help you , '
120597	120608	120586	120586	Rupert	242	' You can not guess the geography of this place . '
120732	120810	120731	120731	painters	6104	' lay - figures , and pieces of shining armour , which made up the ensemble of Rupert 's abode . Sitting there with the dark night about them , the rich folds of crimson drooping to the floor , amid a stillness hardly broken by the far - off murmur of the London streets , Rupert and Hippolyta might have fancied themselves in a world from which reality was shut out . He said to her , '
120838	120839	120829	120829	you	367	' '
120844	120848	120840	120840	You	242	' said Hippolyta . '
120913	120914	120900	120900	you	242	' '
120917	120921	120900	120900	you	242	' cried Rupert ; '
120936	120937	120929	120929	you	367	' '
120944	120949	120929	120929	you	367	' she asked mischievously . '
120979	120980	120968	120968	I	0	' '
120985	120991	120968	120968	I	0	' he said with emotion , '
121016	121033	121007	121007	You	367	' His countenance glowed as he reflected on what she had suggested . She went on . '
121090	121091	121093	121093	you	242	' '
121117	121118	121108	121108	you	242	' '
121154	121198	121132	121132	I	0	' He looked at her in great surprise , as well as delight . There was a meaning in her words that he had yet to unravel . She spoke in clear firm tones , but her eyes were fixed on the ground . '
121205	121209	121201	121203	an extraordinary woman	2825	' he said , '
121266	121267	121268	121269	Dear Rupert	242	' '
121271	121275	121276	121276	you	242	' she said , '
121321	121331	121315	121316	A woman	6460	' she went on , smiling for a moment , '
121354	121365	121351	121351	you	242	' He did not know what to make of her . '
121371	121411	121366	121366	I	0	' he said . She folded her hands over her knees in a favourite attitude of hers , and lifted her eyes steadily to Rupert 's face . He could not help feeling excited , but he kept still . '
121416	121420	121412	121412	I	0	' she said , '
121666	121684	121660	121660	Rupert	242	' She was too much affected to go on . Rupert looked at her with pitying eyes . '
121690	121694	121660	121660	Rupert	242	' he inquired . '
121706	121707	121696	121696	you	0	' '
121712	121716	121696	121696	you	0	' she said ; '
121846	122167	121833	121833	Rupert	242	' I felt miserable indeed when he was gone . Towards evening the cottage looked so desolate that I resolved to avail myself of Lord Trelingham 's hospitality , and occupy the room which he calls mine , the dear old man . It was dark when I arrived , and the place looked strangely quiet after the brilliant spectacle of the birthday festivities , the dress ball , and the tableaux vivants . The music of the dance had been ringing in my ears incessantly till I entered the vestibule ; but there , under the sudden conviction that it was all over , that it had gone like a vision of the night , it seemed to stop . I felt that you were gone . Would not an instinct have drawn you from your upper chamber , brought you from the chalet , had you been there and Hippolyta at the door ? Ah yes , Rupert , you love this poor foolish maiden , and she loves you , I think . So they came out and made me welcome , and told me of the pleasures I had missed by going home ; and that you , to their astonishment , had not stayed out the festivities , but had been hurried away on they knew not what business to London . And then they praised the tableaux , and we were deep all that evening in questions of Celtic poetry and the significance of the San Greal . Lord Trelingham asked me when my father would come again . I told him I did not know ; that all was uncertain with him and consequently with me , but , as the truth was , that he had been pleased on hearing of my new life among these kind friends , and especially that I had witnessed the glories of the coming of age . '
122434	122479	122422	122422	she	5855	' Rupert gave an exclamation of surprise . He remembered the fragment of conversation he had heard , when walking on the front terrace , between the Countess and Lady May. The words came back to him as they had been uttered by Karina , '
122498	122516	122517	122517	You	2850	' Had Tom Davenant proposed to the Earl 's daughter ? He put the question to Hippolyta . '
122521	122525	122517	122517	You	2850	' she answered . '
123035	123054	123069	123069	she	5855	' Hippolyta looked about and stopped in her embarrassment . She did not see her way to continue . '
123057	123061	123069	123069	she	5855	' said Rupert , '
123071	123077	123069	123069	she	5855	' Hippolyta heaved a sigh . '
123085	123089	123069	123069	she	5855	' she said . '
123154	123155	123148	123148	I	0	' '
123161	123166	123156	123156	I	0	' said the artist ; '
123173	123174	123167	123167	she	2878	' '
123179	123248	123249	123249	She	2878	' replied Hippolyta ; and she rehearsed the conversation which had taken place at Falside between herself and Madame de Lutenieff , delivering , as she judged to be expedient , a round unvarnished tale . Rupert was very angry ; he saw now that his suspicions had been well founded . This woman would have set Hippolyta and Lady May at daggers drawn to achieve her purpose . '
123255	123263	123249	123249	She	2878	' said Hippolyta , almost in tears , '
123491	123492	123482	123483	one woman	2884	' '
123510	123514	123515	123515	they	2886	' said Rupert ; '
123553	123554	123548	123548	herself	7321	' '
123567	123573	123561	123561	I	0	' she answered very seriously . '
123890	124369	124376	124376	Glanville	242	' You have been telling Miss Valence that ? " exclaimed her cousin , drawing a step nearer . The Countess shrank away . " Well , why not ? " she asked , still bent on making mischief . The reply seemed to stagger Lady May. " Why not ? " she echoed absently . And then recovering herself , she looked straight into my eyes . " Would it make any difference to you , Miss Valence , if I did ? " she asked in her loftiest manner . My heart sank within me . " You are the best judge of your own actions , " I replied , showing as little feeling as I could . " Then you are not in love with Mr. Glanville ? " was her question , full of mockery and malice . Karina looked on , amused . I rose ; I would not wait to be further questioned . " Make my excuses , please , to Lord Trelingham , " I said , " and allow me to wish you good - morning . This is the last time I shall trouble you , Lady May. " I was going to the door when the Countess interposed . She begged me not to take offence ; it was her fault , her cousin meant nothing . Lady May stood perfectly silent , and I thought would not speak . But she felt , I suppose , that she had been guilty of a breach of good manners , and that it was due to herself to tender an apology . When she saw I was bent on going , she stepped forward and begged my pardon . She had not meant to be rude . She was excited ; would I forgive her ? I thought of the Earl , who had been so kind to me , and how my departure at that moment would make a reconciliation between the families more impossible than ever . And if I went , would it not seem a confession that you and I — ? In short , I did violence to myself and answered meekly . But I could not stay , as they wished me , beyond the next few hours . My head ached , and I was , you may imagine how wretched . Mr. Davenant did not appear at luncheon . He was busy , the Earl said , preparing for his journey to Foxholme , where he had to meet the tenantry next day . The Countess was radiant , Lord Trelingham serious , Lady May sullen , like one that can not forgive herself for seeming lowered in the eyes of a friend . I was glad to get home . I shall never , never visit Trelingham again . '
124370	124374	124376	124376	Glanville	242	' Nor I , '
124378	124404	124405	124405	He	242	' I will acquaint Lord Trelingham by the next post that our engagement is ended . My poor darling , how you must have suffered ! '
124444	124465	124466	124466	she	394	' But why did I not remain at home ? You do not ask me that . Oh , no , '
124470	124485	124466	124466	she	394	' give up your engagement at Trelingham you must not . Honour is honour . '
124486	124500	124502	124502	Rupert	242	' It will be only paying a forfeit which I can well afford , '
124504	124521	124502	124502	Rupert	242	' and I can not look Lady May in the face again after her atrocious behaviour . '
124522	124528	124530	124530	Hippolyta	394	' Yes , you can , '
124539	124545	124546	124546	he	242	' How is it possible ? '
124549	124572	124546	124546	he	242	' Do you think I could go on living at the Court while you were in a kind a exile at Falside ? '
124573	124582	124584	124584	her	394	' I shall not go back to Falside , '
124587	124590	124592	124592	Rupert	242	' What ! '
124596	124614	124592	124592	Rupert	242	' not go back ? Have you any other plan ? What is it ? tell me . '
124615	124624	124625	124625	she	394	' Then be quiet , as you promised , '
124643	124717	124639	124639	she	394	' Why do you think I came here tonight ? To inform you that Lady May had hurt my feelings ? No , not exactly . When a girl like me has lost father and mother , when she is her own mistress , alone in the world , without any one to look to for light or guidance except the man she loves , what do you suppose she ought to do ? '
124734	124739	124740	124740	he	242	' My darling Hippolyta , '
124743	124757	124740	124740	he	242	' do you mean to say that you will marry me at once ? '
124758	124762	124763	124763	she	394	' I mean , '
124774	124785	124763	124763	she	394	' that I am yours in life and in death . '
124840	124843	124845	124845	Rupert	242	' Then , '
124860	124881	124845	124845	Rupert	242	' I must get a special license as early as I can — to - morrow morning , if possible . '
124890	124898	124899	124899	she	394	' Who grants you the special license ? '
124902	124912	124913	124913	he	242	' I do n't know , I am sure , '
124916	124934	124913	124913	he	242	' I am not learned in these things . I fancy it is the Archbishop of Canterbury . '
124935	124945	124946	124946	she	394	' Do you believe in the Archbishop of Canterbury ? '
124968	124974	124975	124975	he	242	' Not a great deal , '
124978	124999	124975	124975	he	242	' but he is an institution , a piece of antiquity . And we can not be married without him . '
125000	125005	125006	125006	she	394	' Can we not ? '
125009	125037	125006	125006	she	394	' What a strange thing that would be ! No , Rupert , we do not want the Archbishop 's license , or any one else 's . '
125048	125055	125056	125056	he	242	' You are excited , Hippolyta , '
125059	125114	125056	125056	he	242	' and it makes you talk in a fanciful way . I care nothing for the license . We can be married by banns , in the old fashion , if you like ; but it will take more time , and you will have to be called by Mr. Truscombe in Trelingham Church . '
125115	125121	125123	125123	her	394	' Not in any church , '
125127	125263	125056	125056	he	242	' Listen , Rupert , I see you do not understand me yet . I love you with my whole heart , but I have not ceased to be Hippolyta Valence . Do you know how I have been brought up ? I am not a Christian ; I have no religion , except to follow my conscience ; to live the highest life and help towards realising the noblest ideas . My father has taught me that all religions debase them . And do you imagine it would become my father 's daughter , at the very moment he is staking his life in the battle for the future , to stand at a Christian altar and submit to institutions which he and I have renounced ? I will never do such a thing . '
125264	125272	125273	125273	he	2902	' But my dear , dear Hippolyta , '
125278	125292	125273	125273	he	2902	' it is only a ceremony . It can do you no harm . '
125293	125327	125056	125056	he	242	' Yes , it can do me this harm — that I shall be acting a falsehood . I have neither regard for the Christian ceremonies nor belief in the creed they express . '
125328	125339	125056	125056	he	242	' But surely you believe in the sacredness of wedlock . '
125340	125505	125056	125056	he	242	' I believe in the sacredness of love , but I will have no priest to utter his superstitious formulas over my head , or recite legends to which I must hearken while despising them , or pretend that you and I may not consecrate our hearts to one another without his leave . Nor will I submit to any civil ordinance . To bind myself before man would be more foolish even than to take an oath in the presence of a God I do not believe in . Why should you care , Rupert ? You think really as I do ; and yet you are the slave of old customs . Are we not alone in the world , simply given into each other 's hands by nature and destiny ? Can a priest bid you cease to love me , or change our feelings ? Here is the marriage of true minds . Can he allege an impediment against it ? '
125640	125643	125644	125644	he	242	' Oh , '
125678	125728	125660	125660	he	242	' oh , to pluck this rose , this sweet , pale rose , breathing out love and passion ! Oh , pale , sweet rose , to be trampled in the mire , its leaves rent , its fragrance gone , and I to be such a villain ! '
125775	125789	125790	125790	he	242	' How did you dare to come , you mad , impulsive child ? '
125798	125803	125805	125805	her	2903	' Dare to come ? '
125809	125837	125805	125805	her	2903	' Dare , Rupert ? Not come to you because I dare not ? Why , what risk am I running ? Rupert will not harm me . '
125849	125853	125854	125854	he	242	' Not Rupert , '
125868	125888	125854	125854	he	242	' not Rupert , but the wildness in him , the passion you have so cruelly , so thoughtlessly — '
126031	126164	126028	126028	he	242	' But , Hippolyta , for my sake , darling ; to please me , will you not do like the rest of the world ? You shall be free as air afterwards . I have never given a thought to your religious views . You learnt them from your father , and it is not for me to say I know more about such things than he does . I was brought up in the ordinary way ; I took my own line when I became a man , as you know . My friends would tell you , very likely , that I had not much of the Christian left in me , nor do I suppose I have . But some points we must observe till the world changes . '
126165	126172	126174	126174	her	2911	' My world has changed already , '
126177	126228	126028	126028	he	242	' it has ceased to be the world of lying conventions and foolish worn - out antiquities . It is the world of truth and honour and love . If I could not promise to be faithful , if I were not sure of my own heart and of yours — '
126229	126243	126244	126244	His	2912	' How can you be sure if we are not married , Hippolyta ? '
126254	126284	126285	126285	He	2912	' Might I not do as other men have done — be a scoundrel and desert the woman I had pretended to love ? Where would be her remedy ? '
126301	126345	126297	126297	Hippolyta	367	' And do you think the Archbishop 's license would give her a remedy ? What a charm for broken hearts ! Why , it would be a more powerful love - philter than Tristram and Iseult drank together on their fatal voyage . '
126377	126382	126384	126384	Rupert	242	' My dear child , '
126390	126408	126384	126384	Rupert	242	' you argue like a woman . It is not a question of feelings but of rights . '
126409	126440	126499	126499	Hippolyta	367	' I argue like my father , who has often told me that the great wrong on which all modern institutions are founded is the divorce between feeling and right . '
126441	126455	126384	126384	Rupert	242	' But he married Lady Alice . He submitted to the social ordinances . '
126456	126473	126384	126384	Rupert	242	' He was young then , and his principles were not fixed as they afterwards became . '
126474	126490	126499	126499	Hippolyta	367	' And your mother ? a man that marries twice must surely believe in matrimony . '
126491	126497	126499	126499	Hippolyta	367	' I can not tell , '
126513	126561	126562	126562	Rupert	242	' There was in the union of my father and mother all the sacredness which you , and I no less than you , prize in wedlock . But whether they went through civil or religious forms I never learnt . I do not think they did . '
126576	126591	126592	126592	he	242	' And is it possible , then , that your mother was not married ? '
126602	126606	126607	126607	she	2914	' Quite possible , '
126646	126647	126626	126626	she	2914	' '
126654	126662	126651	126651	I	0	' he said , being utterly baffled , '
126719	126730	126731	126731	I	0	' he cried , in a tone of vehement desire , '
126744	126745	126738	126738	You	2917	' '
126756	126760	126750	126750	he	277	' she answered ; '
126785	126786	126750	126750	he	277	' '
126792	126796	126788	126788	I	0	' asked Rupert . '
126859	126874	126855	126855	Rupert	422	' she went on , facing him now with her sweet and frank expression , '
127243	127302	127236	127236	Rupert	422	' He had listened like one amazed . She spoke with burning eloquence , and her eyes were bright and clear as she stood before him , her countenance glowing with enthusiasm , while with the fervent words her bosom heaved and fell . Rupert , in a taking of love and anger , was almost beside himself . '
127308	127313	127315	127315	you	367	' he burst out , '
127344	127352	127340	127340	Child	444	' he said , his face darkening , '
127414	127434	127407	127407	me	0	' he looked round as he spoke for his hat and overcoat . She laughed , no whit displeased . '
127442	127446	127435	127435	You	0	' she said . '
127452	127453	127435	127435	You	0	' '
127460	127464	127465	127465	I	0	' he inquired . '
127470	127474	127435	127435	You	0	' she replied ; '
127490	127491	127485	127485	I	0	' '
127496	127501	127485	127485	I	0	' he said uneasily , '
127522	127634	127635	127635	Rupert	422	' She did not stir from her place . With a long , earnest look she examined the expression of Rupert 's countenance , where he stood by the door . He was impatient ; he could think only that she ought to have an address in London and not be wandering about like this . He would devise some means of persuading her to be reasonable to - morrow , when she had got over the excitemtnt of the discussion . While he was in this mental confusion , she walked slowly across the hearth and came to him . He turned round . They were again face to face . '
127637	127641	127635	127635	Rupert	422	' she said , '
127686	127698	127678	127678	I	0	' She looked marvellously beautiful as she stood before him waiting . '
127703	127707	127711	127711	God	276	' he cried , '
127744	127752	127737	127737	yourself	422	' he said in an imploring voice ; '
127764	127784	127755	127755	I	0	' and he fell sobbing at her feet . She stooped and touched his cheek with her ungloved hand . '
127789	127795	127787	127787	Rupert	422	' she answered , weeping ; '
127821	127822	127817	127817	You	422	' '
127825	127838	127817	127817	You	422	' he said , rising with a groan that tore his heart , '
127855	127868	127849	127849	I	0	' He did not dare to lift his eyes to her face . '
127875	127883	127849	127849	I	0	' she said in a faint whisper . '
127906	127907	127903	127903	me	0	' '
127911	127918	127919	127919	You	422	' he said , detaining her . '
127942	127952	127939	127939	I	0	' Her look had a strange meaning in it . '
127957	127961	127939	127939	I	0	' she murmured ; '
127975	127976	127970	127970	I	0	' '
127985	127994	127978	127978	you	422	' He was resolved to go with her . '
128002	128041	127978	127978	you	422	' was the answer she made . She drew her cloak about her shoulders and attempted to pass him . Rupert had drawn the curtain aside which hung over the door , but he held the handle fast . '
128049	128053	128044	128044	you	422	' he said . '
128058	128062	128055	128055	you	422	' she replied , '
128123	128124	128099	128099	My	0	' '
128131	128144	128145	128145	Your	422	' he said eagerly . He felt the force of her words . '
128151	128155	128145	128145	Your	422	' she said . '
128175	128176	128167	128167	They	2958	' '
128183	128187	128180	128181	old Martha	445	' he answered , '
128194	128195	128180	128181	old Martha	445	' '
128203	128207	128197	128197	you	422	' replied Hippolyta . '
128257	128264	128265	128265	You	422	' He thought she was relenting . '
128271	128280	128268	128268	you	422	' he exclaimed with a feeling of relief . '
128309	128310	128307	128307	Hippolyta	367	' '
128316	128320	128311	128311	You	422	' she said . '
128368	128386	128364	128364	you	422	' There was a long pause , or else the minutes stretched out in this spiritual agony . '
128393	128408	128389	128389	I	0	' Rupert said slowly , as if coming to himself out of a sleep . '
128424	128428	128433	128433	you	422	' she answered . '
128437	128445	128433	128433	you	422	' He could not finish the sentence . '
128449	128456	128430	128430	you	422	' she said under her breath , '
128491	128500	128483	128483	you	422	' And again she endeavoured to pass him . '
128504	128509	128483	128483	you	422	' he cried out ; '
128521	128543	128515	128515	You	0	' And even as he spoke the thought of uttering such harsh language to the woman he loved smote upon him . '
128549	128557	128515	128515	You	0	' he said , taking her hand , '
128588	128589	128583	128583	I	0	' '
128596	128600	128593	128593	I	0	' she said . '
128630	128795	128796	128796	I	0	' She was calm and resolute . Her eyes had gathered a brilliant light in them during the moments of their altercation ; and Rupert , as he looked at her , thought she was the woman to do as she had said . If he let her go the river would be her restingplace ere morning . Then began a fresh scene of earnest , impassioned pleading on his part and resistance on hers . He begged , he entreated , he grew angry and gentle by turns , he employed the most caressing language and all the resources of the lover 's art , not as many a lover has done , to overcome the scruples of modesty , but to save this high and noble spirit , noble in its very aberrations , from shipwreck . He might as well have poured out his eloquence to the stones of the street . Hippolyta heard it all unmoved . She said once , '
128854	128855	128849	128849	you	2968	' '
128860	128864	128849	128849	you	2968	' he answered , '
128904	128905	128892	128892	you	367	' '
128911	128915	128892	128892	you	367	' she said , '
128922	129078	128892	128892	you	367	' and the contest broke out again . But it was not equal . Hippolyta , as she truly said , had thought over the contingencies of that strange situation , and was prepared for the worst . Her life , spent with those who were ever exposing themselves in the field or ready to mount the scaffold , had familiarised her with the idea not only of self - sacrifice , but of failure which has death for its price . The risk , she said , must have been undertaken some day , why not now ? To persuade Rupert in cold blood , or by the use of arguments , was , she knew , impossible . One weapon which not even he could pluck from her hand , one last resource there was which left the man and woman unequally matched — and the man inferior . She told him plainly . '
129085	129089	129082	129083	a tyrant	2970	' she said , '
129147	129162	129140	129140	you	2971	' What could avail against such resolution ? Rupert said to her at last , '
129197	129198	129191	129191	your	0	' '
129206	129210	129191	129191	your	0	' she said . '
129276	129281	129273	129273	My	0	' she said softly , '
129304	129305	129306	129306	I	0	' '
129309	129362	129306	129306	I	0	' he answered in a low voice . It was like consenting to death . The room swam before him . But when Hippolyta heard the words her countenance lightened wonderfully . She became a naive child instead of the resolute woman that had been pleading in that desperate and unparalleled cause . '
129366	129405	129406	129406	You	0	' she said , offering him her cheek to kiss . He touched it with his lips , almost shudderingly . She held the door open . He bethought himself for a moment before going , and said , '
129514	129515	129505	129505	you	0	' '
129520	129524	129517	129517	your	0	' she answered , '
129531	129626	129526	129526	I	0	' He fled down the steps and along the gardenpath . He heard the key turn in the lock . He did not venture even to glance back , but ran straight on , gave a quick , brief message to the woman who came out as he passed , and with head down and rapid step took the road towards London . More agitated he could not have been had he left a murdered body in his studio . It was worse , he said to himself ; he had murdered a soul . '
129635	129640	129633	129633	I	0	' he murmured repeatedly , '
129653	130053	129650	129650	his	671	' He walked on and on . The winds were still up , driving the clouds through a beautiful stormy sky in which the moon shone bright at intervals . It had ceased raining and the streets were dry underfoot for the most part , though here and there a pool of water gleamed on the roadway , and all the scene reminded one of a chill March night rather than the end of May. There was a high - strung feeling in the atmosphere which harmonised with Rupert 's excited mood , and gave him a vivid sense as though in comparison he had never lived till now . What had he promised ? Was there any retreat from it compatible with honour , nay , with the existence of Hippolyta ? And this , then , was the realising of all his hopes ! Oh , bitter mockery ! He went over the debate again and again . Why had he not urged this , why forgotten that ? He had been too tame , too yielding ; he might have pleaded more earnestly for himself . Hippolyta was generous , and if he had insisted on the injury to his own sense of rectitude , to his reputation , which had never endured a stain , to his happiness , which must be sacrificed if they were to live in concealment or come forth with shameless foreheads before the world,—but what did it avail ? The hour was past and his word given . To - morrow ? It wanted how few moments of the day when he and Hippolyta should become outcasts from the world in which he had been brought up ? And he was helpless , bound hand and foot by the devilish teaching of Colonel Valence . Who would have believed yesterday that the dreams of a revolutionist were henceforth to shape his life for Rupert Glanville ? He had been content to dwell in the regions of the ideal ; to put aside these questions , tossed to and fro by politicians and reformers , as vulgar , unworthy of the artist 's consideration , fit only for debating clubs . And they had broken into his retreat and were clustering about his hearthstone . On him — him — Rupert Glanville , the crisis of the modern world had fallen . '
130059	130071	129650	129650	his	671	' he said with a bitter laugh as he hurried along . '
130166	130511	130525	130525	Hippolyta	367	' He stopped and gazed up and down the silent road , bewildered to such a degree that he knew not whether to turn back and try to persuade Hippolyta , or to leave it all to chance and depart by the next mail for the Continent . He could be ready in a few hours . He was now nearing home , and terribly fatigued with the excitement and exhaustion of the day , for he had eaten nothing since noon . To pack a portmanteau , write a farewell note , telling Hippolyta that a bad promise ought to be broken and he could not bring himself to do her wrong , then to drive to Charing Cross and catch the Dover train,—all this was still possible . He had almost resolved on it , but for the memory of her resolute pale face and her steady words , which assured him that she had not been acting a part . What should he feel if she carried her threat into execution , and he learned in Florence or Dresden that her body had been found defiled in the mud of the Thames , her sweet eyes closed for ever ? No , he dared not risk it . Even death would not save her now ; after spending a night in that fatal studio she was to the world at large dishonoured . She had spoken the truth ; in paying such a visit her character was blown to the four winds . The falling snow was not more stainless , and yet she must bear about with her the penalty of guilt . His thoughts , as he wandered aimlessly under the fitful moon and the wild clouds , took a fresh turn . He would not go home yet . He stood looking through the railings of the Park , and studied with an absorbed gaze the misty lawns on which lay a film of uncertain moonlight , while the dark stems of the trees made a solemn background . '
130515	130521	130525	130525	Hippolyta	367	' so his meditation ran , '
130866	131639	131709	131709	you	3004	' He lost himself in the endless discussion . The sound of a distant cab hurrying along broke from time to time upon his ear ; but it died away into silence while he walked hither and thither , scanning the shapes and motions of the silvery clouds and the deep rifts of blue where the stars shone faintly . Was Hippolyta asleep at this hour , or pacing the studio in troubled thought as he was pacing up and down Park Lane ? Again he felt tempted to go back . He walked a few steps in the direction he had come ; then , with a strong effort , frightened and feeling a chill at his heart , like one who has heard the voice of an evil being near him , he turned again and went hastily along the deserted streets , not towards his studio , but towards the river . He could not have explained what lugubrious fancy it was that led him on , neither pausing nor looking back , nor assigning to himself a reason for the way he was travelling , but still moving , as by instinct , always towards the river . In the weird and silent light , shed by a moon which gradually drank up the clouds and seemed to grow larger and larger , he caught a glimpse of his shadow , now in advance , now moving sideways with him , now emerging from the deep gloom of enormous buildings as a drowning man rises for a moment from the waves which are to close over him again . He passed a solitary figure at the turn of a street , and could hardly refrain from asking it what business took it abroad at such an hour . He heard the steady march of a policeman pacing up and down , and the echo from the opposite side of the way , with something of the guilty apprehension that dogs an ill deed ; he would have felt easier had no one in the huge city been awake but himself . And still he made for the river . A fresh breeeze blew upon his forehead when he emerged from a narrow lane ; he saw the vast shadow of the Abbey , and the moon resting over it ; other shadows came , as it were to meet him and guide him on . In the quiet which had succeeded to the rush and tumult of a London day there was something inexpressibly awful and mysterious ; something as terrible as death , for it came upon him like the cessation of innumerable lives , of myriad activities , like the lying down to a rest which might never be broken , so profound was the silence over it , of millions upon millions . And then he was standing alone on Westminster Bridge . For that brief space of time , the river with its multiplied solemn lights stretching far away , the immense radiance of the moon quenching them in one place , contrasting with them in another , all that flood of dreary waters and still drearier memories belonged to him alone . It had no name , no associations with history , no taint of the vulgar day ; it was a broad river flowing by a great wicked city down to the unknown sea . And in its deeps were the secrets of wasted lives , a vision of horror not to be explored by the boldest . Yet he would force himself to think of those whom Hippolyta , the pure unsullied Hippolyta , had called her sisters , and with whom she had been willing to make her bed that night . Where he was standing , in another hour , let him but utter the word , she would be gazing her last on earth and sky . He saw her mounting the parapet , heard her cry of despair as the arches of the bridge echoed and re - echoed it in the stillness , watched her as she sprang , as she whirled through the air , as her body struck upon the rushing waters , and her golden hair floated in the light one instant , then was swallowed down into the deeps of death . Another of the pitiful sisterhood to whom suicide opens its ghastly arms , another folded in the embrace of the spectre that knows not how to help sorrow but by slaying ! And was that to be Hippolyta 's doom ? '
131643	131648	131709	131709	you	3004	' he said aloud , '
131680	131702	131709	131709	you	3004	' He looked steadfastly down at the river , and from a great distance the whisper was conveyed to his heart , '
131808	132857	132858	132858	Rupert	422	' The great light reflected beneath seemed to be gazing at him . Even as the fancy came he beheld — whether with the eyes of flesh or only with those of the spirit , who shall say?—the depths of the river lit up , its secret places opening ; he beheld its slimy banks and muddy , festering floor , which some indescribable vegetation clothed and made more horrible , and the dark yellow waters rushing along , ghastly in a pale flame , which gave them a half transparency , and which illuminated that pathway of the drowned as if it were a mausoleum wherein sacrifices to the dead , or on behalf of them , were to be offered that night . He saw the multitude crowding upon one another , and again they seemed to be each in its own solitude ; so that he was oppressed at one and the same time with contradictory feelings of a throng from which there was no escape save into the unlighted abysses beyond , and a loneliness where no voice came . His ear seemed to detect the sound of footsteps moving swiftly or slowly , but oftenest with the dragging gait of despair , moving from the distant city streets , from east and west , from north and south , from the ends of the earth , converging all towards the spot where he was standing,—a ceaseless , dreadful march of those that did not know one another , nor in this life ever should , but were contributing to swell one host , and precipitating themselves into a common grave . The river itself was peopled with the dead ; but still the dead came hurrying , crowding , rushing with maddened steps , or creeping as in a dream , along all the ways which led up to the bridge and into the flaming waters . There was no other sound than the march of innumerable feet , no outcry to pierce the ear of darkness and wake those that slept in their warm beds , oblivious of their brothers and sisters who , fainting under the weary load of life , came to cast it from them into depths where it should be found no more . He heard the steps behind him , around him ; the pavements were alive with them , but the host marching forward was already enrolled in the ranks of death . And as they pressed down into the river , breathless , hopeless , with wild eyes and haggard looks , he saw the numbers of them that had entered into this sabbath of suicides rise in their dripping garments to meet their associates in crime and desolation . The multitude grew and grew ; but there was ever fresh room as it moved downward to the remoter places , whence , as it seemed to him , the ascending tide was bringing a noise of the sea and of the night - winds struggling upon it . Here was the waste of the world , the human souls and bodies for which in life no room could be discovered nor a ransom given : here was a redemption wrought for others , for the happy among men , by suffering . But how unlike that redemption spoken of in the churches ! For upon this no resurrection followed ; it was an offering of victims whereof account was not made and whose pains had but one alleviation — that they were ended by death . Or was it possible that the great sea towards which the throng seemed to be moving might prove more dreadful than the river ? Had those old tales of the fiery deep , and the streams of lament and forgetfulness , any truth in them which made of suicide not only the dreariest but the deadliest of sins ? What did that stony look in the eyes , what did that scared hue upon the cheeks portend ? A wasted life might then be nothing in comparison with a self - inflicted death . The dark realms ; the infinite shadow ; the jaws which opened from beneath , in the deeps immeasurable ; the grave that was but an entrance to a lower grave , which would swallow the living soul as these waters had sucked down the body , — yes , it was more natural to believe in them here , when sin and death met face to face . And was Hippolyta to join this multitude , to dedicate her purity and her young affection to the powers of darkness , turning from the glory of the sun to go down such ways into the everlasting sea , whence no bark would bring her again or any mortal ? He could bear it no longer . With these pursuing thoughts behind him , he quitted his station on the bridge , and hastily descended into the streets once more . He fled from himself , from Hippolyta , from the night , from the morning , which had almost begun to dawn while he looked into that awful gallery of the dead . He was utterly bewildered and undone . Conscience smote him on one side and on the other ; whatever he should resolve would be wrong , and fatality was dogging his steps never to leave him . But for a little while , cost what it might , he must become blind and heedless . He would go home , to rest if it were possible , and let to - morrow bring what it pleased . In such confusion did he arrive , weary and chilled to the marrow , at his own house . He let himself in . The moon was still shining when he entered . Creeping noiselessly upstairs , he undressed in the light which came in at his window , and with a heavy sigh lay down to sleep . When he woke again it was broad day . A gleam of the early sunshine rested on his face ; and he rose with an instant remembrance of the scenes through which he had passed . '
132860	132870	132858	132858	Rupert	422	' he said to himself between scorn and pity , '
132894	132978	133790	133790	I	0	' He dressed quickly , swallowed a mouthful of breakfast , and went out . After walking through several streets , he looked round at a point where no one seemed to be in sight but the driver of a hansom cab , who was just then passing under the archway of a mews with his vehicle . Rupert hailed him , and bade him drive at his fastest pace to an address in the suburbs . It was a long way off . '
132987	133749	133790	133790	I	0	' said the artist as he sprang in . The time is a month or so since Rupert 's long drive out of town ; the scene an old - fashioned garden , shaded largely with elm and lime , but with sunny spaces too , where flowers and fruits and vegetables seem to be growing side by side in pleasant neighbourhood . A hot July sun is sending down its floods of splendour , but little tempered by the specks of cloud which hang timidly in the sky , and are the remnant of a glorious fleece that melted into the azure some hours ago . Three o'clock is striking from the church steeple , which can be seen at some distance peering up through the trees ; for , near as it is to London , timber of an honest , ancient sort is still plentiful all about , and especially on the long ascent of the main road , which within the memory of man was the High Street of a thriving village , but is now fresh named , to denote its absorption into the mighty maze of the great city . A second clock makes itself heard in a second church , more modern than the red brick edifice which has served the parish time out of mind — more modern and much nearer , since only the garden wall divides it from the garden . It is a large , handsome building of ragstone , and will look picturesque when the mosses and ivies have grown over it and taken from it the too fresh appearance as if it had been built yesterday . Other houses , of many shapes and varying dates , but most of them counting their century , are within view , each with its own garden , and with rows of plants in bloom at the upper windows — for we can not see the lower ones here . There is a quiet hum in the atmosphere as of business , which keeps the place alive and astir , but which has not overpowered its habit of retirement , of well - to - do leisure , of middle - class ease and plenty — perhaps one should rise to a higher strain and say , of refined gentility seeking to combine the neighbourhood of town with trim gardens , winding green lanes , a pathway beyond the palings over - arched with boughs like the boulevard of a foreign city , and detached residences , inherited from one 's grandfather , or taken at a handsome figure for a term of years . The prevailing tone is red brick , intermingled with dense green foliage ; the roads are hard and firm , with a layer of white sand just now overspreading them , from which rises an occasional cloud of summer dust . No railway station comes nearer than a mile ; and the omnibuses which convey the pilgrim hither are less gaudily painted than those which perambulate the leading thoroughfares of Town . Smart carriages roll from time to time up the ascent , which is now called in the street directory Bransmere Road ; and their brilliant lamps , when in winter they draw up before various of these fine old mansions towards the dinner - hour , or stand waiting at half - past ten to take their occupants home again , are a pleasant sight under the trees , like the hugest of fire - flies resting motionless in the shade . But why speak of winter on such a day ? It is over and forgotten . All the doors and windows stand open , and on the road outside , which is just visible over the garden - gate , one can see the vibration in the air which is caused by a long and steady heat , and is the beginning — and as far as we ever get in England — of the mirage that works such deluding miracles in the countries of the sun . But there is a pleasant feeling of coolness in the central alley with its screen of overhanging boughs . And there Rupert and Hippolyta are walking side by side , slowly , as if to take in the beauty around . They are under the spell of this exquisite summer afternoon , when to live is simply delightful , and to be in each other 's company the crown of joy . Hippolyta speaks . '

134790	134797	134777	134777	you	422	' concluded Rupert with a sigh . '

134820	134825	134811	134811	me	0	' she said affectionately ; '

134936	134937	134927	134927	you	422	' '
135095	135101	135102	135102	you	422	' she said , laughing , '

135120	135124	135113	135113	yourself	422	' persisted Rupert , '

135296	135305	135283	135283	my	0	' she went on , her voice sinking , '

135444	135522	135525	135525	you	422	' he said . Their meeting in the studio was a thing he did not wish to recall ; he had put it far from him , and not gone near the place except for a few hours , when he gave orders to have his pictures and painting materials carried elsewhither . He meant never to set foot in it again . For him it would be ever haunted with direful memories . He went on : '
135662	135663	135664	135664	I	0	' '
135670	135674	135667	135667	I	0	' she answered . '
135704	135710	135711	135711	We	3041	' she continued , brightening . '
135764	135765	135766	135766	I	0	' '
135772	135776	135766	135766	I	0	' he said . '
135801	136097	137675	137676	The solicitor	8401	' She ran up the garden with a fleet footstep , and was heard a moment after singing in her room above , as she moved hither and thither . Glanville , his eyes and his heart full of love , gave a glance at her window , where for an instant he saw her dress fluttering when she passed , and went round to the stables a happy yet preoccupied man . What an inexplicable fate was his ! The bright sky and summer hours , in which all things beautiful came forth to view , clad in their gayest attire , the very loveliness and wit of Hippolyta , seemed but to deepen his pensive mood . Their joy had been great — extreme ; too great to last , he would murmur , when he looked on the countenance , of his beloved , and observed in it the shade of some bitter or painful reflection , which , like a change in the evening lights , was gone ere he could decipher its meaning . But his own feelings were not unmixed either . He had spoken the truth when , in the long hours of that night - wandering about London , he described himself as no libertine . The record of his life held in it nothing that men count disgrace . It has been widely believed that genius implies or requires self - indulgence , and that only the Fornarina can inspire a Raffaelle . The creed , however , is uncertain , and Rupert 's autobiography would , on the whole , have tended to disprove it . I do not say that he was immaculate , that , more invincible than Samson , he had never been '
136101	136186	137675	137676	The solicitor	8401	' But if he had now and again yielded to the temptation of a lovely face , a certain fastidiousness of sense held him above the vulgar range of low desire . He was serious , enthusiastic , given to labour , well content with Ivor 's friendship instead of a thousand which were to be had for the asking . When love came , he said , he would make it welcome ; and he waited , not impatiently , till its day should '
136196	136670	137675	137676	The solicitor	8401	' He had not been thought the worse company for a little self - restraint , although in consequence he never went beyond civil terms with various great persons in the world of art . When , as will happen , he heard the moral code expounded with that liberty which is thought to betoken a mind above prejudice , he felt little inclination to assent . Ivor and he were agreed that a man may discard the official religion , yet be under strict orders from a higher court to respect human nature in himself . He did not pretend to be an ascetic or a Puritan , but at six and twenty , he thought , there was no need to be in a violent hurry ; he would not squander his youth nor drain a cup to which the great enchantment was lacking . It might be interesting to discover when and how he came upon the momentous truth that love is of the spirit rather than of earth and the senses , or by what process he had convinced himself that no warmth of affection will compensate for the absence of respect . He believed , too , in love at first sight , and discoursed wisely on the reciprocal attractions that Nature has put into hearts of flesh no less certainly than into threads of steel and amber . But he would have resisted his drawing towards Hippolyta had she not seemed in his eyes a lovely , innocent soul of which outward beauty was the fitting apparel . And now — ? I should be describing a phantasm , and not Rupert Glanville , did I pretend that when the cup which held this great enchantment , running over with love , was pressed to his lips , he did not drink deep of its sweetness . Enthusiasm was part of his nature , and he resolved to make Hippolyta happy , and himself through her,—happy as they could be in the abundance of their varied gifts , the freshness of youth , and the enjoyment of love . Putting the world out of view , dismissing every thought of the future , leaving his reputation as a man , his fame as an artist , to take care of itself , Rupert — not unlike the knight of love to whom Hippolyta compared him , but with eyes open and will determined — had come into the Venusberg and was willing to spend , not seven years , but his life to the very end with the lady of his devotion . If , on the one hand , he felt compunction for the daring step she had taken , on the other it was a dream of his earliest days to sacrifice himself to another . '
136680	137674	137675	137676	The solicitor	8401	' Those were words he would have inscribed on his stainless shield , and counted them a consecration . Had Hippolyta required only the ordinary sacrifice which men approve , because it is cast in moulds familiar to them ! But what was this new virtue rooted in something which to the common judgment looked like vice ? Well , he did not dwell upon it in the first days of their life together . He shut out the judgments of society . Away from Trelingham , from London , where his letters lay neglected , in a house that had few associations with his previous existence , and seeing every moment a companion whose charm grew with the increasing confidence of their intercourse , who suffered from no misgivings as to the legitimacy or the unchangeable character of their relations , but was tranquil , and modest , and delightfully original in whatever she said or did , it is easy to understand how Rupert , like a man carried out to sea upon a great wave , was unable to return upon his former thoughts or to resist the current which drove him onward . He might rue it bitterly afterwards , when the wave was spent or the returning tide had cast him on shore . But there is a strong fascination in the opinion of another when it confirms or excuses our own . Hippolyta did not move , she did not look like a being upon whom degradation had fallen . She kept in her eyes that gaze of seraphic astonishment , as it has well been termed , which , when Nature fixes it in the human countenance , would persuade us against our senses that innocence dwells within . Its light was subdued by melancholy at times ; and who , with the tender feelings of Rupert , could rebuke her then ? He melted into adoring pity , into a childlike devotion that knew no bounds , and that uttered itself in terms which breathed the affection , the seriousness , the playful , half - deliberate simplicity of the heart when it is touched to the core . The house to which he had taken her seemed made for a romantic chapter of existence such as they were going through . It had belonged to Rupert from the time he was at school , having been left him by an ancient lady , his grand - aunt , to whom he was very dear , though she seldom was in a state of health which permitted her to have a talkative and rather troublesome boy in the house . He had therefore seldom been on a visit at Forrest House , nor , it must be admitted , did he look forward to staying there ; for it seemed to his juvenile apprehension dark and gloomy , full of uninhabited corners , and not lightened up by the extremely white face and long trailing garments of black silk , and the black lace shawls , which made up for him the impression of his grand - aunt . He liked her in his general way of liking all who were kind to him . But he was glad to be out of doors whenever Miss Atterbury would allow him to run about , and at other times to stay with the Dutch pictures and explain in his own mind the scenes which they delineated . When his grand - aunt died he attended her funeral ; and he remembered , but not well , being told by a gentleman in black , who proved in after years to be the family solicitor , that Forrest House and the properties thereunto appertaining were his own , to be held in trust till he came of age . He thought little on the subject ; his father 's small estate , lying on the borders of Shropshire , and in a beautiful hilly region , pleased him much better than this old red mansion , nor did he for a long while understand that it brought him a not insignificant part of his annual income . Immediately on the old lady 's death it had been let , furniture and all just as it stood , to another lady not quite so old . She survived till Rupert was five and twenty ; but he never had occasion to make himself known to her , and did not see Forrest House for a good fourteen years . Her death left it vacant ; and the family solicitor was looking for a suitable tenant when Rupert , to his own great astonishment and with a feeling of shame , informed him that he might spare himself the trouble , and that the house was disposed of . What sort of person the incoming tenant was , or on what terms he had taken the place , Glanville did not say . On driving thither that morning he had dismissed the cabman at the door , and showing a card from his solicitor to the housekeeper , who had never set eyes on Glanville , he went over the principal rooms . They were in admirable condition , and needed but some few alterations to fit them for Hippolyta . He gave the orders at once , stating his intention of taking possession that very afternoon , and assuring the housekeeper that she should receive a telegram from the solicitor which would authorise these prompt measures as soon as he had reached that gentleman 's office . She inquired the new tenant 's name . He had not thought of one , and did not answer on the spur of the moment . To the housekeeper he seemed rather absent - minded ; but the fact was that he could think of no other name than his own . '
137681	139414	137675	137676	The solicitor	8401	' he said ; and he hurried away . He called the first cab which he saw going down the descent , and paid a hasty visit to his man of law , during which it appeared that Mr. and Mrs. Malcolm , intimate friends of his , wanted the house , and as they happened to be travelling in the neighbourhood would like to make trial of it at once . He was decisive and peremptory ; dictated the terms of the telegram lest there should arise difficulties at the other end ; left the solicitor 's office the moment all was concluded , and on the stroke of noon entered the studio . Hippolyta was expecting him . No words passed between them except the brief sentences in which he asked whether she was ready , and what she proposed to do with the luggage she had left on arriving from Falside . It was thought prudent to take it with them ; lost or relinquished luggage gives rise to inquiry ; and they drove together , for the first time — these engaged lovers — in a London cab , not speaking one word as they went along . They did not even clasp hands . A feeling of some decisive event taking place , too grave and solemn for the expression of any sentiment , was in the hearts of both . Thus they set out on what seemed the interminable drive to Forrest House , and arrived about six o'clock . It was not twenty - four hours since Hippolyta had alighted in Rupert 's studio . But with the change of scene and of name — for to the latter precaution Hippolyta , though very reluctantly , gave her consent,—with this , I say , their solemn feelings vanished . The artist had disappeared ; the young lady of Falside was known no more . Mr. and Mrs. Malcolm , a young married couple , ardently attached to one another , never seen apart by the neighbours who observed that Forrest House had been let , and unobserved by the rest of humankind , were living a fantastic , yet a real existence , which seemed to dispense with all ties of duty or obligations towards their fellows . They had but one duty , to be in each other 's company at all times ; but one obligation — which they did not appear to think a burden — that of loving one another . They fleeted the time carelessly , as in the golden age . They received no letters , read no journals , received no visits . The old housekeeper had strict injunctions not to admit callers beyond the gate ; and when Sunday came , she was perplexed and horrified on seeing that neither the young lady nor her husband went to church . They might indeed be Roman Catholics , and were perhaps ignorant that the Gothic edifice on the other side of the wall was of that persuasion . She gently hinted as much to Mrs. Malcolm on the Monday morning ; but no , Mrs. Malcolm said they were not Roman Catholics . And during the four Sundays of their stay hitherto they had not seen the inside of a sacred building . They spent the Day of Rest exactly like the other six days of the week , in painting and singing , and exploring the old house , and rambling about the garden hand in hand , or driving among the more sequestered lanes . Only once did Mr. Malcolm go up to town ; and Mrs. Malcolm passed the whole afternoon near the garden - gate , sometimes opening it to look down the road , as though by looking and wishing she could bring him home a little earlier . When he did arrive she was overcome with infantine joy , and laughed and sang , and danced a step or two about him as they went up the path together . Neither housemaid nor housekeeper — there were only these servants indoors — had seen a bride so unmistakably in love . And the bridegroom seemed equally enchanted . It was so indeed . Their attachment , sudden as on both sides it had been , like the outburst of birds in springtime under the influence of the newly - brightening sun and fresh warm air , was deep as their nature . Rupert , whose mobile temper and susceptibility of imagination added an intense earnestness to whatever he undertook , was now wrought up to a pure enthusiasm in which he felt like an actor in some great tragic movement , the dénoûment of which — as on the Roman stage when an emperor commanded — might become not acting but reality . He had lived much alone , and had acquired that turn for concealment or reserve which would have led him , without much pressing , to join in any kind of secret undertaking , provided it were not dishonourable . A secret marriage would certainly not have shocked him ; and in keeping acquaintance at bay , inventing expedients which might throw them out , or making covert journeys into the blue distance , he would have been as fertile as the heroes of Dumas or Eugène Sue . But then , a secret marriage need not be dishonourable . And was the loyalty which now engaged him to live under cloud of night a thing to be ashamed of ? or had he not done his best to persuade Hippolyta , and could he now by taking measures compel her to submit to the ways of the world ? He would not do it , he said to himself ; in all but name theirs was a true marriage ; and the sense of mystery heightened his passion . Great as is the force of public opinion , and in various respects more potent than ever it was , it has nothing sacred about it , and a man who chooses to live out of society , or to live in it and be wary , need not fear that his individual freedom will suffer or his comings and goings be severely scrutinised . There are so many standards in the field , that he who does battle against one is pretty sure to find the folds of another waving over him . Rupert , indeed , could not have explained to a man of the world on what conditions Hippolyta had become his without exposing her and himself to ridicule . He would have been asked in a bantering voice why he sought far - fetched reasons for what was the simplest thing imaginable . But very few would have inquired , and still fewer cared to know , why Miss Valence had accepted him . All that society demanded of Rupert was to keep his own counsel , go his way , and observe the proprieties . Whether he lived a double life — was Mr. Glanville the famous artist in Belgravia , and Mr. Malcolm the idle young gentleman at Forrest House — concerned nobody but himself . The penalty was for bringing these things on the stage . And Rupert , who was well acquainted with the rules of modern society , although hitherto not called on to practise this particular one , felt by turns amused and melancholy,—amused at lying perdu in such a way when he ought to have been cultivating life in London drawing - rooms and enjoying the season ; melancholy that it was for Hippolyta 's sake he had put on the outward seeming of an ill - regulated life . He shrank from the question how long it might continue . He was in the fairyland of first love , of reverie and romance , of innocence which took on the colour of guilt , and of guilt which seemed primeval innocence . The world of every day might be near , but it was on the other side of the mountains which made a steep inaccessible wall between it and them . The lovers had only to forget ; there came neither voice nor portent out of the rosy sky under which they roamed , or from the trees of the forest which grew up , friendly and large - leaved , around them . No portent out of the rosy sky ; but still , as we have seen , a something in Hippolyta which , like the thinnest cloud , was visible to another , to Rupert , not to herself whom it passed upon . She would be momentarily pensive , leaning her beautiful head upon her hand , with such tender , thoughtful grace as that of Juliet meditating in the balcony , while Romeo stands watching her . But she did not know why she should be less gay at one time than at another . It was a novel experience ; for though she had gone through suffering in childhood , she had not dreamt sad dreams as she did now . The explanation which lay close at hand , which indeed Rupert would have been almost glad to receive , that she repented of her daring , and was ready , though ashamed of confessing it , to go through the form of marriage , did not even occur to Hippolyta . It was not true . A universal nonconformist does not feel the shock of any one act which , by itself , would be a challenge to society at large . Why , then , was she melancholy ? She did not know . And , like the determined character she was , she formed a resolution to shake it off . Perhaps it came from having so little to do . She had not been taught to spend her days in amusement , but in labour ; and this life of silken ease did not agree with one whose care had been extended not only to the management of Falside , but to the large correspondence which she received or transmitted on behalf of Colonel Valence , and whose exercise had been riding over a wild country . '
139420	139437	139438	139438	I	0	' she said to Rupert , as they were driving after the conversation we have recorded . '
139569	139570	139571	139571	You	3052	' '
139574	139583	139571	139571	You	3052	' answered Rupert , with his ironical smile , '

139899	139903	139865	139865	Murder	457	' he said , '

139999	140003	139996	139996	My	0	' he answered , '
140036	140049	140026	140026	I	0	' he added with a smile which showed he was not serious , '
140098	140106	140107	140107	you	5845	' he sad , looking at her , '
140225	140226	140222	140222	you	5845	' '

140389	140417	140424	140427	The only human being	3081	' he asked , with the uncertain accent of a man who would like to refuse , and yet was willing to yield for love 's sake . '
140588	140596	140577	140577	you	5663	' She gave him a charming look . '
140619	140631	140632	140632	I	0	' he said in determined accents . She reflected before answering . '

140690	140694	140684	140684	you	0	' he replied , '

142632	142636	142622	142622	she	6122	' the mechanic , '
143296	143316	143272	143272	Rupert	242	' I think I shall ride to Falside when I have done this piece of the day 's work . '
143317	143321	143323	143324	the Countess	5855	' To Falside ? '
143331	143402	143272	143272	Rupert	242	' Oh , of course , to go on with your landscape , which , by the bye , we have never seen . What a pity it is that such a picturesque little demesne should be left in the charge of a couple of old servants ! It might as well belong to a ghost or a dead man as to Colonel Valence , who is never at home . '
143403	143412	143414	143414	Rupert	422	' But Miss Valence takes care of it , '
143440	143444	143446	143446	Karina	338	' Dear me ! '
143458	143475	143446	143446	Karina	338	' how odd that Mr. Glanville should not know that Miss Valence has disappeared from Falside ! '
143476	143479	143481	143482	the artist	5691	' Disappeared ! '
143485	143504	143481	143482	the artist	5691	' What do you mean , Countess ? Is that a term of romance for something very ordinary ? '
143505	143510	143511	143511	she	244	' Ordinary or extraordinary , '
143514	143534	143536	143536	herself	244	' it is true . A few days after you went to London — when was it , May ? '
143539	143544	143546	143547	Lady May.	394	' When was what ? '
143548	143568	143569	143569	She	244	' I ca n't help you to an answer if you break off in the middle of a sentence . '
143603	143610	143611	143611	he	242	' Take care , Lady May , '
143614	143642	143611	143611	he	242	' there is always danger of accident when people begin talking up in the air like this . They forget that they are not on the ground . '
143643	143647	143648	143648	she	244	' Thank you , '
143670	143675	143676	143676	she	244	' Well , Karina , '
143682	143688	143676	143676	she	244	' what were you saying ? '
143689	143741	143661	143661	She	244	' I was telling Mr. Glanville that Miss Valence had quitted Falside unexpectedly about a week after Cousin Tom 's birthday ; and that she did not inform us , in the brief note we received , either of her destination or of the causes which led to her sudden departure . '
143775	143814	143770	143770	he	242	' I did not know you were so much in Miss Valence 's confidence . Has she been in the habit of notifying her movements and their motives to her feminine acquaintance ? And has she really gone ? '
143815	143822	143824	143824	Karina	338	' We were not mere acquiantance , '
143826	143894	143824	143824	Karina	338	' you may remember , Sir Artist , how anxious she was to be received at Trelingham . One might have supposed it was the chief object of her life . And no sooner is she free of the house , than she vanishes into space without a word of explanation either to my cousin or to me , although we were both devotedly fond of her . '
143895	143902	143904	143905	Lady May	244	' Do n't exaggerate , Karina , '
143912	143998	143904	143905	Lady May	244	' you were as fond of her as you would be of a new plaything for three days and a half ; if she had not gone you would have got tired and found another plaything before long . As for me , I never pretended to be enthusiastic about Miss Valence . Her wish to put an end to the misunderstanding between papa and Colonel Valence was no doubt amiable . But I could not care for a young lady who held her principles . '
143999	144005	144007	144007	Rupert	422	' What sort of principles ? '
144042	144049	144050	144050	she	244	' Oh , dangerous principles enough , '
144053	144085	144050	144050	she	244	' I do not know that I can or ought to describe them ; but you may imagine that Colonel Valence would not teach his daughter the maxims of English society . '
144086	144092	144094	144095	the Countess	5855	' Now you are exaggerating , '
144097	144119	144120	144120	she	244	' they were not English maxims , I grant . But they were romantic . Do you think , Mr. Glanville , '
144124	144177	144120	144120	she	244	' that there is no morality out of England ? Miss Valence , my cousin , and I had a famous dispute on that subject before she went . I agreed with Miss Valence , and we were set down by Lady May as exceedingly naughty . Were we not , May ? '
144178	144183	144050	144050	she	244	' You misrepresent me , '
144188	144250	144251	144251	she	5855	' and you are doing injustice to Miss Valence . But I have no particular pleasure in discussing her views , even if I fully understood them . I am not sorry she has left Falside for what may prove a long time . It was a dangerous and difficult connection , as I saw at the beginning . Not indeed , '
144256	144292	144251	144251	she	5855	' that any one was to blame , except Colonel Valence for bringing up his daughter on such a system . I am glad we visited her , and glad the acquaintance is probably over . '
144293	144307	144309	144309	Rupert	422	' Did Miss Valence write that she should be away a long while ? '
144315	144346	144311	144312	The Countess	5855	' She spoke of leaving Falside and being uncertain whether she should return . It was a short note — two or three lines in haste , that was all . '
144347	144358	144360	144360	Rupert	422	' Something connected with her father 's plans , perhaps , '
144362	144369	144360	144360	Rupert	422	' he is a great traveller . '
144382	144388	144390	144392	Madame de Lutenieff	400	' And a great conspirator , '
144394	144473	144390	144392	Madame de Lutenieff	400	' I should like to know him . What an entertaining history he must have lived through , always plotting and going about in disguise for thirty or forty years , like the villain in a play ! But we do n't know whether Miss Valence followed him from home . She may have gone off with one of those dark Italians that used to be seen at Falside . We did fancy , just for a moment , '
144499	144525	144490	144490	she	3183	' she stopped and looked across at Lady May. But no help came from that quarter . Rupert felt the blood mounting in his cheeks . '
144531	144536	144490	144490	she	3183	' he said resolutely ; '
144546	144564	144537	144537	you	3184	' His tone of calm indifference disconcerted Madame de Lutenieff , who could not see his face . '
144572	144581	144537	144537	you	3184	' she said with less spirit than usual ; '
144654	144668	144651	144652	Mr. Glanville	242	' for he had now turned round with the brush in his hand ; '
144683	144684	144678	144678	I	0	' '
144692	144697	144690	144690	Countess	265	' replied the artist ; '
144768	144769	144759	144759	you	242	' '
144775	144896	144759	144759	you	242	' said Karina , somewhat crestfallen . She had not shaken Rupert 's equanimity ; nor was she further advanced on the subject of his relations to Hippolyta . But there was something else to be attempted , and Lady May 's leaving the Great Hall when their conversation reached this point gave her the opportunity she longed for . With that engaging openness which , from being really a part of her character , had been submitted without difficulty to cultivation , and was now a weapon of attack and defence , she contrived to let Rupert know that Tom Davenant had proposed for his cousin 's hand , but with the unexpected result which has been already chronicled . '
144899	144906	144759	144759	you	242	' went on the innocent Countess , '
144978	144985	144973	144973	her	3192	' she exclaimed with pathetic fervour ; '
145004	145028	145029	145029	I	0	' Her eyes , though not capable of a deep expression , were searching the artist through and through . He answered coolly , '
145072	145094	145118	145118	You	242	' He was returning good for evil , and the Countess smiled . Praise of her preux chevalier always melted her . '
145097	145101	145118	145118	You	242	' she said , '
145150	145157	145139	145139	I	0	' And her eyes gleamed brightly . '
145165	145176	145158	145158	I	0	' was his answer , partly serious and partly ironical , '
145200	145201	145190	145190	they	3202	' '
145208	145212	145213	145213	I	0	' she said . '
145228	145240	145241	145241	I	0	' She waited , but he would give her no encouragement . '
145251	145309	145241	145241	I	0	' at last he said . It was hardly courteous , but why would she linger there ? He went resolutely at his fresco again . The Countess thought a little while before setting her foot on the ladder by which she had come up ; and then , with a mischievous smile , said to him , '
145360	146699	146816	146817	The housekeeper	6186	' With which enigmatic sentence she descended to the floor of the Hall and went out . Glanville , I am sorry to say , was anything but grateful ; and his comments , delivered under his breath as he went on painting , would have astonished Madame de Lutenieff . For , though dissatisfied with her partial success , she had the witness of a good conscience , and would not have minded explaining to a female confidante the line of conduct she had pursued . There was only one rival in Mr. Tom Davenant 's affections whom she feared , and that was Lady May. So long as his cousin remained single , Tom was capable of renewing his offer . Were she married , or engaged , and out of the way , Karina trusted that the young man would have eyes for her own attractions , which were not inconsiderable . She had almost convinced herself that Lady May was in love with the artist ; that passionate scene in which Hippolyta had said so little and Lady May had been so vehement was ever present to her fancy ; and in the hope of a further unravelling of the threads she , instead of following Mrs. Davenant and her son to London , had waited for Rupert 's return . It was all important that he should know the offer had been made and rejected . She would help him to one of the most accomplished and stately of brides . It was of no consequence that Lady May would have to stoop a little in order to marry him , but of the utmost that he should understand she was there , waiting for him to fall on one knee and demand her hand . The Earl would not refuse , and the great danger would be averted . So the Countess reasoned , not foolishly from her point of view . It was a misfortune that Rupert would not accept her confidence , and that Lady May would endure no reference , on her part , to Rupert . How absurdly stiff and straitlaced was the morality of English people ! Even that daring Miss Valence had shown extreme reserve in their last interview at Falside , and was now departed on an errand which might have some romance in it , but would be sure after all to end , as English stories did , with perfect propriety . Karina sighed ; she was not made for this dull realm . She hoped , when the time came , she should persuade Tom to live abroad ; not so much at Paris — Paris was not itself under the Third Republic — but at Vienna , Venice , Naples , with an interval once in a way at Monte Carlo . The Countess did not play , but she took great pleasure in looking on while others played . The development of the drama which she desired to see at Trelingham was , however , interrupted a few days later . The Earl , never very strong , had been ailing for some time , and his physicians , after consultation , ordered him to take the waters at Schwalbach . He was unwilling to go , but they threatened him with the consequences ; and Lady May , who was really and devotedly attached to her father , added her persuasion . She would of course accompany him . The Countess thought she might join them later on ; and , as Glanville declared that he fully entered into Lord Trelingham 's mind on the subject of the decorations , and would write frequently and give ample details of the progress of the work , it was decided that a move should be made . Thus the artist and Mr. Truscombe would be lords of the domain during his absence ; but on Glanville 's suggesting that he must occasionally quit the Court for other engagements , Lord Trelingham begged him to use all the freedom he might wish . It had been stipulated at the beginning that Rupert should take a fair time over the work and not hurry . When , therefore , he had been some three weeks at the Court , and his impatience to see Hippolyta again was reaching a feverish height , they all , to his infinite content , bade him farewell one fine morning . That afternoon he rode to Falside , and , winning admittance to the library , wrote thence a glowing epistle to Mrs. Malcolm , in which he rejoiced over his new - found liberty , and promised to be at Forrest House within the week . He kept his word . Three days of unalloyed happiness passed like a flash of summer - lightning , lambent , swift , and beautiful . It seemed to Rupert that Hippolyta had subdued her melancholy . She was adorably candid and child - like , full of pretty fancies and loving conceits , reluctant to let him go , yet comforted with the hope of their union for good and all when the next few months were over . She had found occupation in gardening , and her list of the neighbouring poor was beginning to fill . Had she gone near an infected house , or exposed herself to danger ? No , she answered laughingly ; there was no infection within three miles . She had attended one sick - bed , and meant to attend it still , for it had gained her a pleasant intimacy . Further the story did not go . Rupert , too much in love with Hippolyta to hear all she said , hardly waited for the end of the sentence , but was bursting out , in the manner of happy mortals , with praises of her generosity and declarations of his unalterable affection . He went back to Trelingham more in love than ever ; and if he did not yield to home - sickness now , it was by dint of incessant occupation . The story which he would not let Hippolyta finish was pretty in its way . At Falside she had taken pleasure in her garden , and with help from Andres — who loved her as if he had been her mastiff , and took more care of her than she knew — the flower - beds had flourished gaily , and the wilderness above and below the cascade had blossomed like the rose . It was only to be expected that she should turn to the flowers again for consolation when Rupert went away . There was much to be done in the garden of Forrest House , for it had been neglected somewhat since Miss Foljambe 's death . But the more there was to do the more Hippolyta was pleased ; and every morning saw her in a costume that the work would not spoil , and in gardening gloves , engaged in weeding and trimming borders , and bringing back the straggling plants into some sort of order . The variety of flowers was unusual , and among them were lilies of all kinds , with many old - fashioned bulbs , tulips and hyacinths , which had been preserved in the greenhouse with more care than the rest . Hippolyta wanted no help ; but , for the rougher tasks , she might obtain it from the man who looked after the stables — a kind of miscellaneous groom and ostler , who did not sleep on the premises . She was alone in the garden , then , one pleasant forenoon , binding up some long creepers which had trailed over a bed of calceolarias , when the housekeeper , good Mrs. Leeming , came to her with a request . Might the gardener next door speak to her ? '
146703	146707	146709	146709	you	3204	' inquired Hippolyta ; '
146715	146730	146709	146709	you	3204	' Mrs. Leeming meant at the church , if it was giving no offence . '
146736	146741	146709	146709	you	3204	' said her mistress ; '
146746	146792	146816	146817	The housekeeper	6186	' Well , the housekeeper did not know , but some people were set against Roman Catholics . Not Miss Foljambe , to be sure ; that charitable lady had a kind word for all the world . And that was why the gardener came . '
146800	146812	146816	146817	The housekeeper	6186	' said Mrs. Malcolm , who had not learnt to tolerate servants '
146880	146893	146876	146877	The housekeeper	6186	' Now , Mr. Dauris , tell Mrs. Malcolm what you want , '
146977	146980	146981	146981	he	3209	' But , '
146984	147019	146981	146981	he	3209	' there is not much of a garden , only narrow strips on the other side of the building , and in a shady corner down by the lane where hardly anything will grow . '
147064	147084	147085	147085	she	367	' You would like me to give you some flowers for your church ? I will , with pleasure , '
147088	147110	147085	147085	she	367	' but the garden is in a rather backward condition . Look round and tell me what will suit you best . '
147163	147168	147169	147169	he	3209	' Yes , indeed , '
147172	147300	147169	147169	he	3209	' I know most of the poor about here . But it is not exactly a poverty - stricken place . On this side , along the Hill , you will not find any . You must cross the market and go down into the small streets beyond it , which are beginning to be crowded worse than I remember them . Our own people live there mostly . But it does n't matter which door you open ; you will find suffering and sin inside . The fathers at St. Cyprian 's are there day and night ; and I often hear them say that they can do no good . I do n't wonder at it , seeing how the people are compelled to live . '
147301	147308	147310	147310	Hippolyta	367	' No , nor do I , '
147370	147380	147381	147381	she	367	' What made you come to me for flowers ? '
147417	147472	147409	147409	she	367	' I thought you might be like Miss Foljambe , who was very good to us and sent in flowers every Saturday for the Lady altar . She was not a Catholic ; but she used to say that flowers were of God 's religion , and could do nothing but good to anybody . '
147473	147479	147481	147481	Hippolyta	367	' She was very right , '
147508	147558	147571	147572	the gardener	8560	' She was very right , indeed . A Spanish poet says , " Flowers are the thoughts of everlasting love . " I will send you some for the Lady altar every Saturday ; and lest I should forget , will you come to me next Saturday morning ? '
147559	147569	147571	147572	the gardener	8560	' I shall be much pleased to do so , '
147577	147584	147585	147585	he	8560	' But I beg your pardon , '
147594	147631	147585	147585	he	8560	' next Saturday I must take my poor wife , if she is well enough , to the infirmary'—he named one at a distance—'where the doctors have promised to see what they can do for her . '
147632	147641	147643	147643	Hippolyta	367	' Is your wife very ill , then ? '
147645	147663	147643	147643	Hippolyta	367	' You did not mention her when I was asking you about the sick in the neighbourhood . '
147664	147673	147674	147674	he	8560	' She has been ill this long while , '
147677	147704	147705	147705	he	8560	' but we are not in want , thank God . I earn a good income as a gardener — not here at St. Cyprian 's , '
147709	147738	147705	147705	he	8560	' the fathers could not afford it ; but a few doors down when you pass Church Lane . Our cottage is at the end of the lane . '
147739	147758	147760	147760	Hippolyta	367	' But I should like very much to be of service to your wife , if I could , '
147763	147771	147760	147760	Hippolyta	367	' What is the matter with her ? '
147772	147845	147705	147705	he	8560	' We call it a weak chest ; but I am afraid it is more serious . The doctor tells me — however , I keep it from my wife , so please do n't mention it , for fear it should frighten her — that one lung is quite gone and the other affected . She is obliged to lie down a good deal with pains in her head and back . '
147846	147853	147855	147855	Hippolyta	367	' Poor thing , poor thing , '
147857	147869	147855	147855	Hippolyta	367	' how sad for you both ! Have you any children ? '
147870	147875	147876	147876	he	3226	' Two little boys , '
147879	147893	147876	147876	he	3226	' and a girl . Annie is grown up , she is seventeen . '
147894	147912	147705	147705	he	8560	' And is she at home ? She ought to be a good help to her mother . '
147913	147920	147855	147855	Hippolyta	367	' She is generally at home , '
147925	147952	147855	147855	Hippolyta	367	' She has been in service , but we did not like it for her . It was in a lady 's house near Dorset Square . '
147973	147984	147986	147986	Hippolyta	367	' Well , I am glad you have told me , '
147988	148004	147986	147986	Hippolyta	367	' and do you think Mrs. Dauris would like me to come and see her ? '
148005	148035	148036	148036	he	3226	' Surely she would , if you were so kind ; and I should like it too . But we are not in want of anything , thank God , '
148039	148052	148036	148036	he	3226	' and we would not take your time from those that are . '
148053	148061	148062	148062	she	465	' Oh , I will find time , '
148066	148091	148062	148062	she	465	' may I come this afternoon , or will it be too soon ? I could come to - morrow , in that case . '
148092	148103	148104	148104	he	3226	' I will tell my wife at dinner - time , '
148107	148129	148104	148104	he	3226	' and you will be welcome at any hour . In the afternoon she does not suffer so much from headache . '
148583	148591	148598	148598	she	367	' There is sickness within , too , '
148756	148762	148763	148763	he	3252	' Do you want mother ? '
148766	148774	148763	148763	he	3252	' because she is in that room , '
148814	148824	148825	148825	she	367	' I daresay it is your mother I want , '
148828	148837	148825	148825	she	367	' but first tell me who you are ? '
148838	148843	148844	148844	he	3252	' I am Willie , '
148859	148863	148865	148867	the strange lady	3265	' Willie what ? '
148869	148873	148874	148874	he	3252	' Willie Dauris , '
148885	148896	148897	148897	He	3252	' Come in and see mother . You want mother . '
148943	148947	148949	148949	Willie	467	' Come in , '
148992	149002	149003	149003	he	3252	' The lady wants to see you , mother , '
149046	149052	149031	149031	her	1582	' Are you Mrs. Malcolm ? '
149066	149100	149062	149062	She	367	' I — I told Mr. Dauris this morning that I should like to come and see you . He mentioned that you were not well . Did he say I was coming ? '
149101	149104	149106	149107	the invalid	1592	' Yes , '
149109	149141	149106	149107	the invalid	1592	' he told me you would be so kind . You are very welcome , very welcome indeed . Willie , get Mrs. Malcolm a chair , and put it here , '
149150	149157	149158	149158	she	367	' I lose my voice almost , '
149162	149178	149158	149158	she	367	' when the pain keeps on , and my hearing too . Did you ring ? '
149179	149182	149184	149184	Hippolyta	367	' No , '
149186	149210	149184	149184	Hippolyta	367	' I was on the point of ringing when your boy — when Willie came . He tells me his name is Willie . '
149211	149214	149216	149217	Mrs. Dauris	466	' Yes , '
149219	149250	149216	149217	Mrs. Dauris	466	' he is called after his father . He is our youngest . He will be six on the Assumption . A beautiful birthday for him , is n't it ? '
149264	149267	149268	149268	she	466	' Oh , '
149271	149309	149268	149268	she	466	' the Assumption of the Virgin , a festival of your religion . Yes , I suppose you would like that . And are you feeling better this afternoon ? Your voice is quite clear and distinct . '
149310	149315	149317	149318	Mrs. Dauris	466	' A little better , '
149320	149354	149317	149318	Mrs. Dauris	466	' I hope to be so on Saturday and to go with my husband to the infirmary . It is a long way , but he can borrow a conveyance , he thinks . '
149471	149476	149477	149477	she	367	' The dinner things , '
149480	149540	149477	149477	she	367	' are lying on the table waiting for Annie to clear them away . It is a great trial to me , for I was an active young woman , and I never thought to have suffered from this complaint . It is not in my father 's or mother 's family . But God 's will be done . '
149541	149546	149548	149550	the little boy	3266	' I saw Annie , '
149566	149576	149577	149577	she	1582	' Where did you see her , my darling ? '
149580	149586	149587	149587	he	3266	' I do n't know , '
149621	149654	149613	149613	he	3266	' I saw Annie in the lane . She was talking to a gentleman . She cried . She said I was to go in . But I stayed in the garden . '
149668	149691	149665	149665	she	466	' That will do , my dear . Next time your sister tells you to come in , you must be obedient . '
149699	149705	149706	149706	he	467	' Have I been naughty ? '
149709	149717	149706	149706	he	467	' What makes me naughty , mother ? '
149800	149846	149790	149790	she	367	' I fear I am taking a great liberty , but if you do not mind , since your daughter is not here just now , I should be so glad to do anything you want . Let me put the room straight for you . '
149847	149857	149859	149860	Mrs. Dauris	466	' Oh no , you must not do that , '
149877	149892	149859	149860	Mrs. Dauris	466	' You are a lady , and it is not fit work for you . '
149904	149913	149914	149914	she	367	' Never mind if I am a lady , '
149917	149941	149914	149914	she	367	' I have not lost the use of my hands . I can assure you that I am an adept in washing dishes . '
150992	151001	151002	151002	she	466	' Oh , it is you , Annie , '
151005	151018	151002	151002	she	466	' We are very dark here . Will you bring the lamp ? '
151171	151173	151167	151167	herself	367	' brazen '

151325	151334	151336	151337	Mrs. Dauris	466	' You have never seen my daughter before , '
151339	151367	151336	151337	Mrs. Dauris	466	' but I daresay you would have known her in the street if you had . William says she is so like me when we first married . '
151416	151459	151413	151413	she	367	' No , I never saw your daughter till this evening . But you are right in saying I should recognise the likeness . I did so at once when I was on my way hither , and Annie was walking outside . '
151666	151676	151678	151679	Mrs. Malcolm	451	' If all you want is to learn dressmaking , '
151681	151741	151678	151679	Mrs. Malcolm	451	' I can give you some instruction myself , and you would be able to take care of your mother at the same time . Would you like to come and see me at Forrest House ? I have leisure on one or two days a week . What do you think , Mrs. Dauris ? Do you approve ? '
151754	151801	151802	151802	She	3305	' Annie must say her own word in the matter , or she may think we are forcing her . Now , my girl , which would you prefer — to go with Mrs. Malcolm , or to stay at home as you have been doing ? '
151821	151829	151802	151802	She	3305	' I should like to learn dressmaking . '
152012	152016	152059	152060	Mrs. Malcolm	451	' Good - night '
152051	152057	152059	152060	Mrs. Malcolm	451	' Well , my dear ? '
152092	152109	152063	152063	Annie	465	' Will you let me come to - morrow for the dressmaking , in the afternoon ? '
152139	152166	152119	152120	the girl	3332	' I like you ; it was good of you not to tell my father what you saw , and not to ask me about it . '
152573	152579	152581	152581	their	6804	' Mrs. Malcolm said not , '

152954	152959	152961	152961	Hippolyta	367	' No , darling , '
152969	152983	152961	152961	Hippolyta	367	' not now , I am busy . Some other time , perhaps . '
152996	153031	152990	152990	she	367	' Some other time , some other time ! Ought I to have said that ? I shall not go to see the flowers on the altar , let them look ever so pretty . '
153273	153277	153241	153241	she	465	' a lady . '
153593	153598	153599	153599	she	466	' It shames me , '
153602	154167	153599	153599	she	466	' to speak about such things in the hearing of a lady like you ; but Annie is not the child she was , and you ought to know her ways . I do n't know what came over her when she got to be a big girl . She was as good a child as you would wish to see , and the sisters were very fond of her , till she was twelve or thirteen . And then she took up with some of the bad characters in the school , and she was always going about with them at night instead of coming home , staying in the street , and staring into public - houses , and seeing what it was not right for her to see . I spoke to her often enough , God knows , but as soon as my back was turned away she would go , and not be home again till midnight perhaps , or later . I was afraid William would notice it ; for , though he is a peaceable , religious man , as you may see , he can be very angry , and once he gives way to his feeling I am afraid of what will happen . He did go after her once , and she was obstinate and would not come in ; it was when they were holding a fair in the market,—she said no , she had rather stay out all night ; and William took her and brought her home , and that time he beat her severely . Oh , dear me , I shall never , never forget it . And it did no good ; she was worse than ever . Many an hour I spent in search of her during the dark winter nights , when she would slip out and run off to her bad companions . And where did I find her , after all ? Standing at the bar of a gin palace , talking and laughing with grown men , or coming out of one of the low theatres in the neighbourhood . When she saw me she ran away or hid round a corner , and I have had to come home through rain and snow without Annie . My husband told me it was madness , that I should only kill myself ; but I had the feelings of a mother , and I could not see my child lost . It is a wonder that she never got into worse mischief , for the men and the women she made friends of were thieves , and well known to the police . I can not tell where she found a shelter the nights she stayed out . She would never say , and she seemed not to care . One night she would have spent in the station - house , for she was taken there with others that had been drinking and fighting ; but the sergeant knew my husband , and instead of taking down the charge , he sent round , like a good man , for William , and her father brought her home . That struck a wholesome fear into her during a week or two ; and then she went away again . We were at our wits '
154185	154226	154182	154183	Mrs. Malcolm	451	' she said , turning with wet eyes to Hippolyta , whose silence had deepened with her sympathy and horror . She could not speak , but she pressed the poor mother 's hand . There was a painful pause . '
154232	154243	154227	154227	I	0	' resumed Mrs. Dauris , when she recovered her breath , '
154505	154506	154492	154492	I	0	' '
154511	154515	154492	154492	I	0	' exclaimed Hippolyta ; '
154530	154576	154526	154526	he	3427	' Yes , he was a gentleman , and he had seen Annie walking home to her Cousin Harriet 's from Mark Tomlinson the draper 's near Oxford Street ; and he had fallen desperately in love with her . It was the most ordinary of '
154626	154633	154615	154615	workers	3435	' taken a fancy to Annie , '
154713	154729	154702	154703	the mother	3333	' at first full of wild fire , and then as full of sleep and stupidity '
155187	155194	155195	155195	she	367	' Oh , horrible , horrible , '
155219	155222	155212	155213	Mrs. Dauris	466	' Hush ! '
155226	155234	155212	155213	Mrs. Dauris	466	' I hear a noise this way . '
155245	155268	155237	155237	Annie	465	' They stopped to listen , and the girl entered , with a number of her favourite weekly novelette in her hand . '
155274	155278	155269	155269	I	0	' she said . '
155296	155335	155280	155280	you	3464	' Her face was flushed with the heat , but she looked less ill - tempered than usual . She was certainly pretty , with a sweet expression , something like her brother Charlie 's , just then . '
155341	155345	155338	155338	you	0	' said Hippolyta ; '
155350	155528	155347	155347	I	0	' She surrendered her novelette doubtingly . It was not badly printed , but rejoiced in illustrations of a most pronounced crudeness and vulgarity , which appeared on the reverse of the thin paper ; and its title was — but there is no reason why the title , though merely high - sounding and silly , should be advertised here . It used to glare from London hoardings in great red and green letters , for the delectation of the passing multitude not so many years ago , although it is now rarely to be met with — at least that is my experience — even in catalogues of second - hand rubbish . About a hundred and four numbers compose this sort of tale , which affects the dramatic suddenness and mysterious endings of Eugène Sue , dashed with the sentiment of Mr. G. W. M. Reynolds . There is a whole library of such fiction scattered broadcast by our freedom of the press . Hippolyta , better acquainted with Sophocles than with the purveyors of '
155534	155563	155564	155564	You	0	' turned over the pages in silent disgust , and gave them back without remark . Mrs. Dauris , meanwhile , said to Annie with her accustomed gentleness : '
155600	155601	155593	155593	I	0	' '
155608	155624	155605	155605	I	0	' returned Annie with great quickness , her cheeks lighting up and then turning pale ; '
155653	155772	155773	155773	her	3469	' And away she went , attempting , for the sake of bravado , to hum the notes of a comic street - song under her breath , but not succeeding in getting through it . On the contrary , when she reached the back - kitchen again and sat down by the ironing - board , such a sense of wretchedness overcame the unhappy girl that she burst into a fit of sobbing , and rocked herself to and fro in agony . She was miserable indeed ; far more so than she would have dared to let her mother know or any human creature . But , a few days later , she told as much of '
155779	155808	155812	155812	Annie	465	' as she judged expedient , sitting in Mrs. Malcolm 's boudoir , and in answer to the question which that lady put to her in the words , '
155820	155821	155816	155818	Mr. Maurice Regan	471	' '
155846	155850	155836	155836	she	1753	' cried Annie ; '
155883	155899	155874	155874	He	471	' She was confused and could get no further . Hippolyta came to her aid . '
155920	155928	155917	155917	I	0	' Annie looked down at her work . '
155934	155938	155931	155931	we	3475	' she said ; '
155956	155957	155960	155960	he	471	' '
155971	155991	155960	155960	he	471	' inquired Mrs. Malcolm , who thought she had better let Annie tell the story her own way piecemeal . '
155999	156004	155960	155960	he	471	' replied the girl . '
156016	156037	156013	156013	I	0	' she repeated , as if in answer to the look of sorrow and astonishment on the lady 's countenance . '
156055	156075	156051	156051	I	0	' she concluded vehemently . Hippolyta put her hand on the wicked lips of the child , saying softly , '
156101	156102	156097	156097	he	471	' '
156110	156131	156105	156105	he	471	' cried Annie in a shrill voice , pushing away the gentle hand which would fain have stilled her irreverence . '
156148	156191	156192	156192	I	0	' She spoke loud , as if there was some one in the next room that would hear what she said . Hippolyta was more grieved than shocked . How to bring back so wayward a being to the sense of duty ? '
156195	156236	156192	156192	I	0	' she said after a pause , when Annie had had time to reflect , and had begun to fear the consequences of speaking out loud in such a grand room and before such a fine lady as Mrs. Malcolm , '
156264	156265	156268	156268	I	0	' '
156271	156280	156268	156268	I	0	' said Annie , her spirit rising again ; '
156339	156340	156324	156324	Maurice	471	' '
156353	156407	156351	156351	Annie	465	' It was Hippolyta 's purpose to probe as deeply , and yet as delicately as she could , into the mind of this rebellious creature , and to discover , if possible , a remedy for the unhappiness she was causing herself and others . Annie did not hesitate . She replied : '
156501	156538	156494	156494	them	3490	' She stopped . She was going a step too far in her confidences , as she could perceive , being quick enough in her way , by the growing paleness of Mrs. Malcolm 's cheek . '
156541	156549	156494	156494	them	3490	' said Hippolyta in a low voice , '
156576	156596	156563	156563	you	0	' She turned a wistful glance towards Annie . That young lady , but little abashed , made answer : '
156635	156636	156616	156616	He	471	' '
156644	156652	156638	156638	you	0	' said Mrs. Malcolm , interrupting her ; '
156676	156738	156668	156669	Miss Thatchford	477	' While she spoke Annie was listening attentively , but she would not answer for some time . She seemed to be turning over a resolution in her mind . Once and again she studied the lady 's expression with a sharpness beyond her years , until at last , being apparently satisfied , she said somewhat less impetuously than usual : '
156817	156874	156813	156813	you	0	' She was very imploring . Hippolyta considered . Annie would keep her secret , as she had kept it hitherto , unless the promise was made that it should go no further . And might it not be the girl 's salvation for one of her own sex to become in this way her guardian ? '
156878	156884	156813	156813	you	0	' said Hippolyta at length . '
156914	156915	156885	156885	I	0	' '
156924	156928	156930	156930	you	0	' she replied , '
156945	156981	156941	156941	you	0	' Hippolyta repeated the assurance . Annie became very thoughtful , and broke down several times in trying to begin . It was with great difficulty that at last she said in a broken voice : '
157059	157095	157139	157139	I	0	' She gasped for breath and words failed her , as she put down the skirt she was working upon in a helpless way . She looked not only miserable , but ill and feverish . '
157099	157126	157139	157139	I	0	' said Hippolyta , moved with great commiseration towards her , and forgetting the circumstances which would have seemed to make this turn of events desirable , '
157137	157138	157132	157132	he	471	' '
157149	157153	157144	157144	I	0	' sobbed Annie . '
157278	157283	157275	157275	I	0	' she cried wildly . '
157300	157301	157291	157291	I	0	' '
157315	157367	157303	157303	you	0	' inquired Mrs. Malcolm , her heart touched at the sight of distress which it had evidently cost an extreme effort not to show at the cottage , in the presence of the unhappy girl 's parents . What a mockery was the so - called love of this Maurice Regan ! '
157385	157391	157396	157396	him	471	' said Annie with reluctance . '
157462	157466	157430	157430	he	471	' She paused . '
157482	157502	157503	157503	I	0	' Hippolyta felt she must ask this question . Annie 's thoughts seemed to wander while she was answering . '
157509	157513	157529	157529	he	471	' she said , '
157619	157740	157742	157742	you	0	' The tone of intense gravity with which Annie uttered these words , coming in the midst of real and undisguised trouble , would have amused Hippolyta at another time . Annie Dauris believed in the mockheroic , and had no doubt practised it diligently . She must be fancying herself just then one of the distressed damsels whose abandonment by their lovers made the middle chapters — as it were the third and fourth acts — of those melodramas in prose which were the staple of her reading . But , unluckily , all the wretchedness was real ; and the melodramatic winding - up was yet in the far distance , if it would ever come at all . '
157750	157757	157742	157742	you	0	' was Hippolyta 's next question . '
157897	157898	157872	157872	He	471	' '
157905	157925	157928	157928	he	471	' said Hippolyta , waiting for the answer . Annie did not return her glance , but answered quietly , '
158170	158171	158166	158166	you	3529	' '
158177	158198	158172	158172	I	0	' answered Hippolyta very slowly , and as if some unseen power were putting the words on her unwilling lips . '
158210	158211	158172	158172	I	0	' '
158220	158233	158213	158213	I	0	' cried Annie , in her desperation , rising to her feet , '
158287	158297	158278	158278	I	0	' she said , falling back into her chair . '
158379	158529	158357	158357	He	471	' She was pitiably in earnest now , not melodramatic . Hippolyta , divided between her early feelings and the rapidly growing conviction that , love or no love , Maurice Regan was a scoundrel , did not know how to reply . She sat in front of the hysterical , passionate girl in silence , dismayed and terrified , unable to put forth a syllable which should express her feelings . But where intellect failed the heart knew its way . Rising and going near to Annie , she drew the unfortunate child to her breast , and while Annie wept the bitter , hopeless tears of disappointed affection , Hippolyta mingled her own with them . For a while there was no other sound in the room . Then , lifting her face to the lady whose arms were clasping her , Annie said in a whisper , '
158619	158631	158616	158616	She	367	' But , Annie , would Mr. Regan ever marry you ? '
158778	158785	158787	158787	Annie	465	' Have you got a headache ? '
158813	158819	158821	158821	Hippolyta	367	' It is gone now , '
158860	158869	158870	158870	she	465	' What do you want me to do ? '
158901	158908	158909	158909	she	465	' I want Maurice 's address , '
158912	158993	158909	158909	she	465	' and you could get it from his brother the clergyman , Mr. Philip Regan , if you asked him , without saying who it was for . If I went to him he would perhaps give me in charge for coming about the house . At any rate he would never tell me , for he does n't want me to know ; he thinks I am Maurice 's ruin . He said so that night in Dorset Square . '
158994	159005	158870	158870	she	465	' But I am not acquainted with Mr. Philip Regan , '
159009	159026	158870	158870	she	465	' he would not be likely to tell a stranger who did not explain her purpose . '
159027	159134	159135	159135	Annie	465	' Oh , but you are a lady , and if you called on him the clergyman would very likely tell you anything you wanted very much to know . I can show you where he lives . He goes a good deal among the poor people in his neighbourhood . It is near Saffron Hill . I have been there ; I went with Charlotte once to hear the singing at the Italian church , and as we were coming home she pointed to the other church that Maurice 's brother belongs to . Maurice lives somewhere else , by himself , he told me . '
159359	159366	159370	159370	herself	367	' There is none but I , '
159372	159396	159370	159370	herself	367	' And how can one that has assumed the character of a Mrs. Malcolm be a protection to such a girl as Annie ? '
159454	159461	159462	159462	she	367	' It is Rupert,—Mr . Malcolm , '
159488	159560	159474	159474	she	367	' greetings reached the girl where she sat , and brought tears of rage and envy into her eyes . Why were other women to be so happy and she so miserable ? Mrs. Malcolm was good , but she could have hated Mrs. Malcolm ; she hated all the world . In a few minutes Hippolyta came back , radiant , glowing with the unexpected delight of Rupert 's presence . '
159570	159581	159561	159561	You	465	' she said , taking Annie affectionately round the neck ; '
159596	159619	159561	159561	You	465	' The other , rising up to go , turned her large eyes upon Hippolyta and only replied by repeating her question , '
159629	159653	159621	159621	you	465	' The happy woman , rapturous at her own lover 's arrival , could not be prudent or selfish then . She answered , '
159688	159872	159685	159685	he	422	' Annie lifted Hippolyta 's hand to her lips with sudden passion , and went away . Rupert 's coming was not due to any sudden event , either pleasant or the reverse , at Trelingham . It was simply the escapade of a young man who is very much in love , and who discovers , or makes , in his daily pursuits an occasion for running off to the well of golden water , and there taking long draughts of felicity when no one is looking . As soon as the feeling of Hippolyta 's presence which he carried with him into the West Country from Forrest House grew dim , a devouring melancholy seized upon him , a longing for which there was no anodyne , a weariness of all things which did not remind him of the maid of his heart , and a fever which seemed to infect him when he touched any trifle she had handled or come near . He wrought then like a man who is aware that one day 's labour will purchase seven days '
160154	160157	160205	160205	he	3558	' occasional causes '
160198	160204	160205	160205	he	3558	' Thine eyes are lodestars , '
160622	160638	160639	160639	he	422	' We do not want the palace to wake up , do we , Princess ? '
162047	162181	162183	162183	costermongers	3632	' low'—that is to say , not only poverty - stricken , but brutish - looking;—and though many of the houses were large and of massive construction , their general appearance was one of such pervading filth , misery , discomfort , and , she would have said , of such engrained wickedness , that she felt sure no minister of a Gospel dwelt in any of them . She bethought herself of reading the notices which were posted up on the church door , behind the rusty grating . They dealt with the things of this world , with dog taxes and carriage licenses — the latter absurdly out of place in a quarter which was traversed only by cabs in their flight east and west , or by great drays and butchers '
162184	162509	162183	162183	costermongers	3632	' carts . The only carriages likely to be seen within a large radius of St. Audry 's Church were , said Hippolyta to herself , the hearse and mourning - coach of the undertaker . Parochial announcements , too , stared her in the face ; but it would seem that in the modern significance a parish was not the fountain of heavenly grace to those who dwelt within its borders , so much as a corporate body bent on exacting two shillings in the pound under severest threats from the subjects over which it ruled . On other sheets were published the hours of service and the amount of the Sunday collection , distributed in columns according to the silver and copper pieces of which it was made up . In a corner of the last Hippolyta read the address of the church - wardens ; but , so far as she could conjecture , these gentlemen abode at a distance , and the morning would be spent in seeking either of them . Were the clergy always so difficult to discover ? She had thought of them as making a part of the buildings in which they officiated , but it would seem she was mistaken . What should she do next ? The way in which Colonel Valence had educated his daughter led to her being , in the presence of a trifling embarrassment like this , wild and shy . Clergymen were so closely bound up with that huge imposture called the social organism that Hippolyta , in endeavouring to find one of them , had something of the feeling which possesses a recruit who enters for the first time on a field of battle . She was excited and , perhaps it will be doing her no great injustice to add , slightly afraid . The medieval superstition which made men begin a story with the solemn announcement , '
162523	163297	162513	162514	the devil	3633	' was paralleled to a certain extent by Hippolyta 's shuddering reflection that she , a daughter of the Revolution , had come in search of that reverend vice , that sage iniquity , which , in the person of Mr. Philip Regan , was then stalking abroad through the streets of London . But she must find him ; and after some hesitation , she entered one of the nearest houses , the door of which stood open , and knocked timidly . There was no answer for a time , but the scudding of children 's feet was heard behind the partition , and by and by a room door opened and a tall , slatternly woman came out . She listened impatiently to Hippolyta 's questions , eyeing her elegantly - dressed visitor with marked disdain ; for there is the pride of Diogenes trampling on the pride of Plato in many an unkempt and ragged woman , when she brushes against another of her sex in silk attire . The only answer this virago made was that if the stranger would give Susan a penny , Susan would show the way to Mr. Regan 's . Hippolyta was willing to give Susan many pence when she saw the pale - faced little thing , with her miserable frock reaching hardly to her knees , and an old straw bonnet on her head as much too large for her as the shabby frock was too small . The slatternly woman , among whose goods and chattels Susan was evidently reckoned , told her daughter in a loud voice to show where Mr. Regan lived and come home straight when she had done so instead of playing in the gutter . Hippolyta spoke a word or two of kindness to the child , but she did not seem to notice it , and went on before , her head hanging a little on one side and her feet finding the way mechanically . It was no distance . In a side street about five hundred yards from St. Audry 's stood the small , dingy - looking house in which Mr. Regan had set up his modest establishment as a bachelor or celibate clergyman . Hippolyta kept the child with her till the bell was answered . A decently - attired elderly woman came to the door , and , in reply to inquiries , informed Hippolyta that Mr. Regan was out on his usual morning round ; that it was uncertain when he would come in , and that if her business was pressing the only chance of transacting it at once would be to follow the clergyman on his beat , which was fairly regular , and catch him as he went from house to house . Seeing the little girl by Hippolyta 's side , the good woman gave her some particular indications as to the quarter of the parish Mr. Regan was visiting ; and Susan , with the sharpness of her sex and bringing up , nodded intelligently and set out afresh , nothing loth to guide Hippolyta on her travels . Questions put at diverse points of their pilgrimage elicited the information that the minister had been seen a few minutes previously going into a house in what I will call Denzil Lane,—for the true name is too well known . Here , then , Hippolyta dismissed Susan after giving her a little more than she had promised . It was a fine old street was Denzil Lane , with noble but shamefully dilapidated houses , once the mansions of illustrious families , on both sides , interspersed with miserable tenements huddled one against another and in the last stages of decomposition . The house to which Hippolyta was shown had a large entrance - hall and magnificent oak staircase , which were both dimly lighted from a great window on the first landing , every third pane of which was broken , and the rest discoloured with smoke and festooned with antique cobwebs . Throughout the building one might catch the sound of voices in the different rooms and the movement of a numerous life , for it was densely populated from the cellars , which lay in darkness under Hippolyta 's feet , to the roof that covered in a multitude of dismal attics . Knocking gently at the door on her left hand , Mrs. Malcolm inquired again for the whereabouts of this troublesome Mr. Regan . This time she received a civil answer from the woman who appeared on the threshold . '
163330	163361	163324	163324	he	479	' Hippolyta looked at her in astonishment on hearing the name . Could it be Ivor Mardol ? What was he doing at such a time in such a place ? '
163370	163381	163363	163364	Mr. Mardol	277	' she demanded , anxious to hear further about him . '
163385	163390	163363	163364	Mr. Mardol	277	' was the reply ; '
163418	163486	163411	163411	They	3642	' And the civil , talkative woman proceeded to express her wonder that they agreed as they did , and that they never had high words between them , considering that Mr. Mardol , like Mr. Minns , the tailor upstairs whom he visited , was an infidel , and Mr. Regan not only was a clergyman , but wore vestments on Sundays . This was decisive . '
163493	163632	163411	163411	They	3642	' said Hippolyta to herself . But how extraordinary that , in making inquiries about a stranger like Mr. Regan , she should have come upon the man whom she had been instrumental in sending away from the Hermitage , and whose absence , during those eventful weeks , had determined the course of her whole life ! Should she endeavour to see and talk with him ? He might be able to tell her something of her father . But , on the other hand , she had never learnt , or indeed cared to learn , by what name Colonel Valence was known , if known he personally was , to Ivor Mardol . While she was debating in her own mind , a door opened above and some one began to descend the stairs quietly . '
163635	163640	163641	163642	Mr. Mardol	277	' said the woman , '
163653	163838	163646	163646	He	277	' It was impossible for Hippolyta in the obscurity of the entrance to discern more than the figure of a young man coming down the stairs . But as he drew near and the light from outside fell upon his face , she uttered a cry of amazement , and went back some paces , almost into the street . Her own face , which had been in deep shade , was now lighted up in turn ; and Ivor Mardol , for it was he , startled on hearing the voice and hastening to discover who it might be , when he saw Hippolyta paused , and for an appreciable space of time looked at her fixedly without saying a word . They both offered a picture of surprise and astonishment . Hippolyta was the first to recover . She held up her hand in a peculiar way . Ivor grasped it , let it fall , and whispered the only words he had yet thought of addressing to this strange young lady . She replied in the like whisper , adding aloud , '
163854	163864	163844	163845	Mr. Mardol	277	' He drew her back into the dark entrance . '
163871	163875	163844	163845	Mr. Mardol	277	' he said ; '
163885	163957	163877	163877	you	0	' He was calm , but exceedingly grave in voice and manner . No , she told him , their meeting was accidental ; she had intended to find Mr. Regan . Then , remembering what she had heard from the woman who was standing by , and who had viewed their introduction of themselves to one another with great admiration , Hippolyta asked him whether he knew Mr. Regan intimately . '
163961	163965	163967	163967	one	5661	' answered Mardol , '
164057	164058	164054	164054	I	0	' '
164063	164067	164054	164054	I	0	' answered Hippolyta ; '
164098	164124	164125	164125	I	0	' Ivor considered before replying . He scanned the unknown visitor from head to foot , looked down , and said in a serious tone , '
164162	164163	164158	164160	a dangerous man	3658	' '
164171	164175	164164	164164	You	0	' she exclaimed , '
164195	164196	164190	164190	You	0	' '
164205	164218	164197	164197	He	471	' said Ivor , with a look of mingled pain and displeasure ; '
164252	164253	164247	164247	I	0	' '
164257	164261	164247	164247	I	0	' said Hippolyta ; '
164279	164280	164281	164281	I	0	' '
164286	164290	164281	164281	I	0	' he replied . '
164296	164310	164293	164294	Mrs. Scruton	484	' turning to the civil person , who was still at her door , '
164330	164515	164293	164294	Mrs. Scruton	484	' Mrs. Scruton , after a minute or two of searching , handed him a large key , and he beckoned Hippolyta to follow him along the hall . When they were quite in the gloom of the staircase . Ivor found a door on their right which no eyes , save those accustomed to the darkness , would have perceived . The key turned easily in the lock , and they entered a vast but desolate apartment which may have served in happier days for a drawing - room , though now it was bare of all that could make it pleasant or habitable . Some wooden benches were ranged along the walls ; a table covered with motheaten baize stood at one end and beside it a wooden arm - chair , which Ivor presented to Hippolyta . She would have begged him to be seated , but there was not another chair visible . He laughed and drew one of the benches forward , and seating himself at a respectful distance from her , said in a low , earnest voice , '
164518	164729	164293	164294	Mrs. Scruton	484	' Sympathy is never a matter of words , nor can the utmost eloquence so easily convey an assurance of it as the tone , the look , which expressing that something in us that lies deeper than speech , are powerful enough to create in an instant the warm , comfortable atmosphere in which we disclose our very soul to the listener . So was it now with Ivor and Hippolyta . By a subtle , instant process she knew that she had found a friend , and Ivor knew equally well that the young lady in whose presence he sat , and whose every word and motion had the highest distinction , was sincere , unworldly , and simply intent on doing good . She unfolded to him the story , so far as she was acquainted with it , of Annie Dauris , her passionate folly and despairing love for a man who seemed to have abandoned her and gone his way . She added the dreadful suspicions which , from Annie 's behaviour at their last meeting , she could not but have formed . Ivor listened without interrupting the recital , asked no questions till it was ended , and said merely as Hippolyta concluded , '
164747	164748	164732	164732	you	3663	' '
164751	164755	164732	164732	you	3663	' said Hippolyta ; '
164837	164838	164825	164825	She	465	' '
164841	164848	164825	164825	She	465	' cried Ivor , standing up , '
165028	165029	165022	165022	he	471	' '
165073	165074	165102	165102	he	471	' '
165077	165088	165102	165102	he	471	' said Ivor , turning his serious glance towards Hippolyta , '
165120	165169	165113	165113	he	471	' Hippolyta trembled from head to foot . A feeling of sickness came over her , and she clung to the arms of the chair to keep herself from falling . What could she say ? in what way conceal her emotion ? There was a difficult pause . '
165176	165182	165113	165113	he	471	' she said at last ; '
165197	165206	165184	165184	you	0	' 89 , do we believe in marriage ? '
165218	165223	165224	165224	he	277	' I implore you , '
165232	165266	165224	165224	he	277	' tell me , assure me that this is indeed the story of a third person , that — pardon me , I am too bold — that you are not Annie Dauris . '
165271	165280	165281	165281	she	3677	' No , I am not Annie Dauris , '
165295	165310	165311	165311	she	3677	' it is another 's story , not mine . I should not dare , '
165317	165390	165311	165311	she	3677	' to suggest in the hearing of a clergyman like Mr. Philip Regan the view I have expressed to you . Surely , Mr. Mardol , there can be no mistake as to the teaching of our religion . The free union of equal men and women is incompatible with marriage . If it is not , we are riveting again the chains that were smitten asunder when the churches went down . '
165404	165408	165409	165409	he	3683	' I see , '
165413	165444	165445	165445	He	3683	' you are romantic . Excuse the word . I know the feeling , for I have gone through it . How shall I convince you that you are wrong ? '
165462	165467	165468	165468	she	3677	' Nay , rather , '
165471	165512	165468	165468	she	3677	' how convince me that you have not forsaken the very principles of liberty and equality , if you are prepared to defend the iniquitous traffic in the souls and bodies of women which goes by the name of marriage ? '
165513	165518	165519	165519	he	3683	' Nay , nay , '
165522	165544	165519	165519	he	3683	' Let us use a little patience . I will convince you , if you do not shrink from the proof . '
165545	165552	165553	165553	she	3677	' I shrink from no proof , '
165588	165659	165519	165519	he	3683	' Ah , but the proof I have in view is no less appalling than to plunge your arm up to the elbow in molten iron . There is but one cure for the stage of sentimentalism in which all Revolutionists find themselves sooner or later ; and that is contact with reality . It is very trying to the heart and the nerves , however good for the head . '
165660	165665	165667	165667	Hippolyta	367	' I had imagined , '
165670	165691	165667	165667	Hippolyta	367	' that it was contact with reality , with life , which created Revolutionists . Is not that your experience ? '
165692	165696	165698	165698	his	3683	' No doubt , '
165701	165753	165698	165698	his	3683	' but where many of us have mistaken , and constantly do mistake , is in being satisfied with our first knowledge , and losing touch of things when we go on to mould our philosophies , our Utopias . We look once , when we should look twice and thrice . '
165754	165781	165519	165519	he	3683	' What do you understand by looking twice and thrice ? Finding an excuse for the rulers of mankind and turning back to the ancien régime ? '
165782	165883	165667	165667	Hippolyta	367	' Not quite that , or I should have the courage , I hope , to declare that the Revolution and I had parted company . I mean , looking beyond to - day and to - morrow , considering what will happen when we have pulled down what is yet standing in our way . It is not enough to establish anarchy , as our friends now appear to have resolved . We must go on to establish that which , one day or other , ought to succeed anarchy — the kingdom of justice and of human brotherhood . '
165884	165892	165894	165894	Hippolyta	367	' I am still in the dark , '
165896	165938	165894	165894	Hippolyta	367	' apply your doctrine of second and third thoughts to marriage . The first thought , you will allow , is Free Love ; every man and woman to choose the manner , the length , and the terms of union . '
165939	165963	165964	165964	he	3686	' Yes , the romantic stage ; degenerating in men like Maurice Regan into the stage of libertinism . Oh , I know , '
165983	166016	165964	165964	he	3686	' You will say the abuse of Free Love is not greater , that its dangers are even less , than the abuse of marriage . But let me finish my prologue . '
166033	166210	166030	166030	Ivor	277	' When we turn our eyes upon life , as it is and has been , we are appalled at the multiplied serfdoms which go to make it up . Church , State , family , profession , rank in the world — what are these but names of long - established , deeply - rooted servitudes from which we can escape only by going into the wilderness ? The present order of things is founded upon manifest or disguised slavery . Neither those that command , nor those that obey , are free . The king wears a golden chain , the convict an iron one ; but the king can have his will as little as the convict . Yet all this heaping of serfdom upon serfdom does not end in happiness . Some internal disease appears to be eating out the vitals of civilisation ; and our Socialism and Nihilism are but desperate remedies for the universal gangrene . See how far I go with your first thoughts . Is it far enough ? '
166211	166214	166216	166216	Hippolyta	367	' Perhaps , '
166218	166230	166216	166216	Hippolyta	367	' I will tell you when I have heard your second . '
166231	166239	166240	166240	he	3687	' How wise women can be sometimes ! '
166245	166267	166240	166240	he	3687	' I am not sure that you will like my second thoughts . They may be brought under a single axiom — '
166268	166274	166216	166216	Hippolyta	367	' And that is — ? '
166275	166321	166216	166216	Hippolyta	367	' That man is a spiritual being , and can therefore be neither saved nor lost by a change of institutions which in their nature are mechanical . Or put it this way , man is made by character , not by laws or ordinances . '
166322	166328	166330	166330	Hippolyta	367	' My dear Mr. Mardol , '
166332	166374	166330	166330	Hippolyta	367	' that is the old Christian fallacy . Do not laws create , modify , and mould character ? What but a difference of institutions has made the Turk other than the German , or the Hindoo other than the Mussulman ? '
166393	166397	166398	166398	he	3687	' Excuse me , '
166401	166595	166398	166398	he	3687	' you are talking the dialect of the eighteenth century ; and that is the old leaven of Revolutionists . We should have made further progress if we had not yielded to that fallacy , which the Nihilists begin to see through . At the root of all institutions lies the national character . I admit that enormous changes ought to take place ; I am doing what I can , as an individual , to help on the transformation . But , when all possible changes have come to pass in the outer world of law and custom , nothing will have been done unless a change has taken place in the inner world of the spirit . And now I will tell you how this bears on Free Love . We want all institutions cleared away which fetter a woman 's power of saying no . We want every means bestowed upon her by which she shall come to a full freedom of choosing,—a matter with which law has hardly anything to do , and custom almost everything . But this can be provided only by a right education of women . '
166596	166600	166602	166602	Hippolyta	367	' Quite so , '
166604	166632	166602	166602	Hippolyta	367	' that is what I have always believed . But would you have marriage indissoluble except by the legal process that drags a woman in the mire ? '
166633	166668	166398	166398	he	3687	' Now you have touched my second thoughts . Are the difficulties surrounding marriage artificial , that is to say of man 's making , or do they exist in the nature of things ? '
166669	166676	166677	166677	she	3688	' How like a Socratic question ! '
166689	166703	166704	166704	he	277	' A strange sort of question in Denzil Lane , is it not ? '
166707	166731	166704	166704	he	277	' But this is one of the points on which my brethren and I can not agree . So they have excommunicated me . '
166732	166735	166737	166737	Hippolyta	367	' What ! '
166745	166765	166737	166737	Hippolyta	367	' you are jesting . It is impossible that you should speak so lightly if the thing had happened . '
166766	166811	166704	166704	he	277	' Well , it has happened . I do not wish to sail under false colours . I thought , in fact , when you disclosed to me your connection with the society , that you had brought me a message from the chiefs . '
166812	166822	166824	166824	Hippolyta	367	' And that was why you looked so grave , '
166832	166866	166824	166824	Hippolyta	367	' Oh no , no , I had rather be excommunicated myself . But do tell me , if it will not distress you , how such a deplorable misunderstanding can have arisen ? '
166867	167061	166704	166704	he	277	' It is no misunderstanding . In the society to which you and I belong , founded as it is on a social creed , speculative differences lead to very practical results . I must not disclose what is , after all , the secret of others ; and I could not tell it now in any case . The quarrel is that deep one between the century which gave birth to the Revolution and the century which is guiding it through infancy . I believe there are difficulties — mysteries , if you like to call them so — in the nature of things , which must ever limit our aspirations towards an earthly Paradise . And I do not believe that to revolutionise all our institutions will have the effect which the brethren anticipate . As I say , the multitude are romantic and sentimental ; they have not read , they will not study , the annals of the past . And they little see that when they have abolished Church , State , and family in the old forms , all three will spring up again in the new . '
167062	167069	167071	167071	Hippolyta	367	' Oh , this is melancholy , '
167073	167090	167071	167071	Hippolyta	367	' I know not if it is one degree better than my father 's gloomy prognostications . '
167091	167101	167103	167103	Ivor	277	' Who is your father , may I ask ? '
167149	167162	167132	167132	She	367	' My father is a philosopher and inclined to be a Pessimist . '
167171	167186	167132	167132	She	367	' But where is your proof that conventional marriages are better than Free Love . '
167187	167194	167195	167195	he	277	' I did not say that , '
167198	167249	167195	167195	he	277	' but if you would wish — I should say rather , if you can endure — to see a world where Free Love reigns supreme and unchecked , I can assign you such guides , good and worthy persons of your own sex , as will show it you . '
167250	167258	167260	167260	Hippolyta	367	' In what part of the world ? '
167262	167265	167266	167266	he	277	' Here , '
167269	167387	167388	167388	he	277	' on all sides , within a radius of a couple of miles . Have you the heart to go down into these depths ? You are romantic , and naturally so , since you have dedicated your youth to the Revolution , like those passionate , intellectual women — true Sibyls and Amazons of our modern world — who lead the van in Moscow and St. Petersburg . But the young are enthusiastic without knowledge , as the old have knowledge without enthusiasm . Come and study life where it may be seen in myriad forms , all strangely , dreadfully instructive ; and then tell me what you think of Free Love , Mrs. — ? '
167392	167396	167397	167397	she	367	' Mrs. Malcolm , '
167419	167429	167431	167431	her	367	' I am not afraid of truth or reality , '
167444	167454	167455	167455	she	367	' Can you get me Maurice Regan 's address ? '
167481	167494	167496	167496	Ivor	277	' I will inquire of his brother , and let you know , '
167498	167629	167630	167630	He	277	' but , if I may offer one final piece of advice , it would be that you do not communicate with your young friend until you have gone over some at least of the scenes to which you will be taken . A desperate girl is , no doubt , one of the most fearful responsibilities you could have . But , on my honour and conscience , I do not think she could do anything worse , let her do what she might , than fall again in the way of Maurice Regan . She has perhaps escaped ruin once ; but that sort of miracle is too rare to be looked for a second time . But you should watch over her as well as you can . '
168413	168419	168422	168422	her	486	' To succeed through failure , '
168438	168443	168432	168432	she	486	' Come and see , '
168662	168666	168669	168669	she	486	' Her children , '
168858	168862	168865	168865	she	3731	' the movement , '
169542	169546	169548	169549	the saint	982	' I see , '
169552	169572	169548	169549	the saint	982	' that I must deal with you in earnest . Kneel down and lay your head on my knee . '
169610	169620	169607	169607	he	487	' Now , get up and go your way . '
169997	170000	170001	170001	she	367	' Why , '
170006	170031	170001	170001	she	367	' how did life continue under these iron laws ? What hindered men and women from making an end of it all with themselves ? '
171521	171533	171534	171534	she	367	' But I can not agree with you , Mr. Mardol , '
171537	171559	171534	171534	she	367	' that I have witnessed the evil consequences of Free Love . I see no love anywhere in this frightful chaos . '
171560	171568	171569	171569	he	277	' It is exactly the same thing , '
171582	171606	171534	171534	she	367	' The same thing to love , and not to know its meaning ? You are bent on mystifying me , I perceive . '
171607	171699	171534	171534	she	367	' Not at all . Both are forms of infinite caprice , of desires not brought under reason . Free Love and unbridled passion will ever be one to the multitude at large . If by Free Love , indeed , you mean the choice by one man of the one woman in all the world that Nature destined for him , and passing by all others as objects only of chivalrous devotion , not of personal attachment , do you know what star will rise in the sky of humanity ? '
171700	171704	171705	171705	she	367	' Tell me , '
171712	171718	171719	171719	he	277	' The star of Duty , '
171722	171748	171719	171719	he	277	' There can be no rational freedom in love , or in aught else that belongs to our nature , when Duty is cast out . '
171749	171756	171757	171757	she	367	' And is it a duty , '
171767	171779	171757	171757	she	367	' to go on pretending to love when affection is dead ? '
171780	171856	171719	171719	he	277	' No ; but affection which has once taken on itself the yoke of duty will not die ; it partakes of the spirit 's immortality . You are still persuaded , I see , that instinct passion , and true love are but different names for one feeling . It is not so , believe me . The human element which transmutes instinct and passion to love is the will lighted up by reason . '
171857	171875	171757	171757	she	367	' Then love is never spontaneous , and your philosophy transforms it to a palace of ice . '
171876	171897	171757	171757	she	367	' Nothing was ever more spontaneous than love ; but not all that is spontaneous should be confounded with it . '
171898	171906	171908	171908	Hippolyta	367	' Ah , here comes Miss Desmond , '
171934	171966	171916	171916	she	367	' I will go with her , and leave you to your abstractions , which do not suit me at all . I am sure Miss Desmond is not a Stoic . '
171967	171974	171976	171976	Ivor	277	' And you think I am ? '
171982	172068	171978	171978	his	277	' well , never mind . Only apply what I have been saying to any cases you may meet in your excursion to - day , and let me know whether the idea of duty is not a key to unlock even a larger number of doors than your idea of sacred personality , — with which , observe , I have no quarrel . But we should beware of idols , and look life in the face . You will pardon my unmannerly presumption . '
172222	172225	172226	172226	he	277	' Freedom , '
172233	172273	172226	172226	he	277	' yes , the freedom to do right . That will carry us a little farther , I trow , than the freedom to destroy a man or an institution which happens to stand across the path of progress . '
172470	172478	172479	172479	he	277	' When you have got your anarchy , '
172486	172494	172479	172479	he	277	' what will you do with it ? '
172663	172672	172652	172652	she	2040	' Can you tell me anything of Maurice ? '
172979	172988	172990	172990	Hippolyta	367	' Does he say what it is about ? '
172998	173003	173005	173007	the good woman	8812	' No , ma'am , '
173009	173042	173005	173007	the good woman	8812	' I asked him , but he would not tell . He was crying , though ; and I have no doubt they are in trouble . Perhaps his mother is worse . '
173146	173154	173155	173155	she	367	' What is it , Charlie dear ? '
173159	173167	173155	173155	she	367	' Is your mother not so well ? '
173168	173174	173175	173175	he	490	' Mother is very ill , '
173178	173194	173195	173195	he	490	' but it is not that . It is Annie . Oh , Mrs. Malcolm , '
173204	173234	173195	173195	he	490	' Annie 's run away again , and she left this letter for you on her bed . Mother found it this morning when she went to call her . '
173447	173454	173424	173425	Mrs. Malcolm	451	' It will be her death , '
173463	173475	173424	173425	Mrs. Malcolm	451	' but I can not help it . I must go . '

174138	174171	174172	174172	I	0	' Hippolyta suggested that Maurice Regan might yet be found . If Annie did not come upon his traces , they , with his brother 's assistance , perhaps should fare better . '
174180	174191	174176	174176	I	0	' replied the gardener after a moment of sad reflection . '
174212	174318	174326	174326	he	3895	' It was impossible , in a house where the new ways of thought had not penetrated , to whisper that if the two young people were in love they might be happy together without marriage . To her intense surprise Hippolyta felt that the mere suggestion , though confined to her own breast , was not right . Would not perfect reciprocal affection , then , be enough unless marriage came to add its consecration ? She sat thinking over it . When a little while had passed , and they were still silent , considering what to do first , she said hesitatingly , '
174354	174355	174326	174326	he	3895	' '
174360	174371	174326	174326	he	3895	' echoed Mr. Dauris with deep disgust in his tones ; '
174428	174438	174411	174411	He	3895	' The gardener rose and went to the door . '
174445	174451	174411	174411	He	3895	' he said very bitterly ; '
174481	174482	174484	174484	Annie	465	' '
174488	174499	174484	174484	Annie	465	' sobbed the mother , as her husband went out , '
174520	174529	174484	174484	Annie	465	' she continued , turning to Mrs. Malcolm , '
174552	175349	174484	174484	Annie	465	' What could Hippolyta say ? She was stricken dumb . But there was little occasion for her to say anything . The question was what could be done . Mrs. Dauris became so affected by the thought of Annie 's past misconduct and present danger that she went from one fainting fit into another ; and it was all Hippolyta could do to attend upon her while Charlie went to Forrest House to fetch Mrs. Leeming . For there was no one but the elder boy to watch over his mother ; and it seemed advisable to communicate at once with Ivor Mardol , whose address Mrs. Malcolm fortunately knew . He was well acquainted with the ways of underground London ; he could induce Mr. Philip Regan to make inquiries for his brother , and at the same time could plant scouts in the neighbourhood which Annie Dauris had been wo nt to frequent . Hippolyta , therefore , made haste to leave Mrs. Dauris in competent hands , took a melancholy meal at home , standing up in her desire to have done with it , and ordered the carriage to take her to Mr. Mardol 's house , in Grafton Place . She had never been there previously , nor was she aware of the trade or profession , if any , to which Ivor belonged . It was so considerable a distance that the coachman , surprised , repeated the address to make sure he had not mistaken . She bade him impatiently drive on . The day was cold and the air brisk . To make sure of Mr. Mardol Hippolyta had despatched a message by telegraph , asking him not to leave Grafton Place till she arrived . During the long journey , wrapped in the costly furs that Rupert had presented to her when the cold set in , Hippolyta had leisure for thinking . Her thoughts were far from pleasant . She blamed herself for not having offered better advice to Annie Dauris , whom she had encouraged , it now seemed to her , in making sentiment the mainspring of all her actions . Why not have shown her the folly of such ill - assorted love ? Why , at least , not have put by the side of her wild romantic notions the stern truth which even at that moment she , Hippolyta , was learning under the guidance of Ivor Mardol and Miss Desmond ? Why not have made more strenuous efforts to elicit her secret ? But no , she had been absorbed in self , eager only to make out a strong case for that yielding to impulse which was the cause and explanation of Annie 's downfall . Oh , she could have reviled herself bitterly ; no words of condemnation could be too severe for her . If Annie had gone to such a friend as Miss Desmond , how differently matters might have fallen out . Then she began , as we all do when most occupied with the troubles of another , to look into her own situation . It was no longer so plain to her as it had been . True , she had wronged nobody , had brought no desolation to her father 's heart , nor dishonoured his gray hairs . What she had done and was doing , the manner of life to which she had given herself , would have received Colonel Valence 's approval , she knew quite well , had she been able to inform him of it . Her action was not the fruit of a passionate impulse ; it had been calm and deliberate . Nor was she prepared to allow that society had the best of the argument , in spite of Ivor Mardol 's demonstration from the chaotic deeps of life . It did not touch her , though it might be applicable to such as Annie Dauris . For all that she could not resist the uneasiness which seemed to be creeping over her , like a fog which makes the lights indistinct and the ways uncertain . She wished — and yet again how could she wish?—that Rupert were at home . He would have aided her to think as she ought . But not so , he would have encouraged her scruples , for he desired nothing so much as that they should marry like the rest of the world . There it was,—the rest of the world , the hardness , injustice , cruelty , luxury , unmanliness , the atheism of that most despicable and sordid kind which consists in blinding our eyes to the godlike which is in man . '
175352	175365	174484	174484	Annie	465	' said Hippolyta more than once as the carriage bore her along , '
175439	175475	175414	175414	I	0	' But again she asked herself whether she was not hurrying forward in the hope of finding Maurice Regan and persuading or compelling him to marry the girl whom he perhaps had ceased to love ? '
175482	176118	175414	175414	I	0	' said Hippolyta . The carriage stopped . Mrs. Malcolm looked out and saw a small , but rather quaint - looking house , two stories high , with a clean pavement in front of it , and a strip of open ground on each side , making with the wall of the adjoining houses a sort of passage leading probably to some enclosure beyond . She caught a glimpse of tall wooden beams standing upright , or slanting across one another at the end of the passage , and making that appearance against the sky which in a city always reminds one of shipbuilding . It was , in fact , a joiner 's yard , with saw - mills attached , and the smell of fresh wood had something in it briny and sea - like . Hippolyta alighted , and at that moment Ivor Mardol opened the door and bade her come in . She entered after a word to the coachman , whom she desired to wait , as there might still be need of him . The entrance - hall in which she found herself was square , with a low ceiling of some ancient woodwork ; and the walls were hung with engravings or decorated with exquisite specimens of carving . A low , broad staircase , dark and polished , with massive wooden rail , led to the upper apartments . To the right a curtain of gilt leather hung over and concealed the entrance to Ivor 's workroom . Holding it aside , the engraver , as that room would soon declare him to be , made way for Hippolyta , who was so tired that she threw herself into the first chair she saw , and being more agitated than at any former time in her life , more even than the night when she came to Rupert 's studio , on sitting down burst into tears . Ivor was alarmed and distressed . Ready , on receipt of Mrs. Malcolm 's telegram , to believe that something had happened , he did not know what to conjecture . But he had seen enough of the lady before him to be assured that she was of a high - strung , resolute nature ; and the fact that she kept her residence and the circumstances of her life a mystery , not only from himself , but from Miss Desmond , indicated that there were reasons for doing so of which her present visit to him might be the consequence . However , though Mrs. Malcolm wept , she did not faint . In a little while she recovered ; and begging pardon for an unseasonable exhibition of feeling , which , as she said , could only add to the trouble , not lessen it , she proceeded to tell him the story of Annie Dauris 's flight . To Ivor , who did not know Annie Dauris , but saw much in Mrs. Malcolm to draw forth his admiration and esteem , it came as a relief . He had feared for the lady herself ; the girl 's case , though pitiable in the extreme , was one of every day . She might not be found ; Maurice Regan , even when found , might decline to acknowledge or assist her . But Ivor would do all that lay in his power . He thanked Mrs. Malcolm for coming to him . It would save time if they drove at once to Mr. Philip Regan 's and let him know the circumstance under which his brother 's presence was immediately required . Hippolyta , who had anticipated all this , offered him a place in her carriage , and they set out . '
176133	176143	176144	176144	I	0	' said Hippolyta as soon as they were seated . '
176171	176180	176167	176167	I	0	' she added , smiling rather mournfully , — '
176190	176191	176192	176192	You	3911	' '
176197	176201	176192	176192	You	3911	' said Ivor ; '
176277	176278	176266	176266	I	0	' '
176285	176289	176291	176291	me	0	' asked Hippolyta ; '
176333	176334	176323	176323	I	0	' '
176340	176349	176323	176323	I	0	' he said , with his serious playfulness . '
176415	176423	176411	176413	a lapsed heretic	3915	' he went on half to himself , '
176431	176706	176707	176707	I	0	' It is next to impossible to carry on a conversation in any vehicle making its way through the streets of London ; and but few words passed between Ivor and Hippolyta as they went towards St. Audry 's . Their interview with Mr. Philip Regan was brief , and resulted only in their receiving the address of his brother Maurice 's chambers . For , though as a clergyman he was properly and profoundly shocked , he seemed to take it as a matter of course that Annie Dauris had been the tempter and Mr. Maurice Regan the tempted . He was too well acquainted , he said , with the character of young women of that class to have any doubt on the subject . It seemed to Hippolyta that she had come unexpectedly in contact with a Pharisee ; and , although she had heard of his kindness to the poor , and knew he spent much of his time in visiting them , she could not help fancying that he looked on himself as exceedingly clean , and on those to whom he stooped as exceedingly the opposite . With scornful amusement she pictured the surprise and disgust which would have taken hold of this handsome , clean - shaven , scrupulously fitted - up ecclesiastic , had he learned what manner of woman it was that came to plead the cause of Annie Dauris within his gates . He would write to his brother , certainly ; but he trusted that Mrs. Malcolm was quite sure of the facts on which she was now moving . Hippolyta replied immediately , '
176771	176778	176768	176768	I	0	' she added with some bitterness , '
176798	177170	176784	176785	Mr. Mardol	367	' The clergyman bowed stiffly and led them to the door . He gave less credit to Annie Dauris 's story than ever . Such was the first of her weary and fruitless journeys , undertaken by Hippolyta during that day and the next two or three , in search of her lost and fallen sister . Not finding Maurice Regan at his legal address — but , of course , they had not expected to find him there — Ivor sat down and wrote him a brief account of Annie 's disappearance , requesting him to let her parents know if he was acquainted with her whereabouts , as the police were already engaged in searching for her ; and if he were not , to take such steps as lay in his power towards her recovery from the danger into which she had plunged . The next point was to visit Charlotte Fraser , who either could not or would not give them any information , except the names of certain persons , lower than herself in the social scale , with whom Annie had been wo nt to consort . The places where these women abode did not seem fit for Mrs. Malcolm to approach . Ivor promised that he would make all needful inquiry , and let her know the result . She begged him to address her at the gardener 's cottage ; for , even in this crisis and bewilderment of her faculties , she was still uncertain whether Rupert would wish his friend to know that she lived at Forrest House . So far as Ivor was concerned she need have had no anxiety . He was ignorant of Rupert 's connection with that red - brick mansion , as of the extent and situation of his property altogether , except that of the house in town at which he had once stayed . They were three long and miserable days , while a bitter east wind was blowing under the darkened sky , and in Hippolyta 's heart there was a sense of growing distress and heaviness which she could not account for , even when she thought of the trouble in her friends '
177370	177374	177375	177375	he	462	' You see , '
177378	177414	177416	177416	himself	462	' Mrs. Malcolm , we have done our best , but Annie has proved too much for us . Her mother will die ; and what does it matter how I live ? But yes , '
177418	177451	177375	177375	he	462	' it does matter , and you do well to rebuke me with your looks . I beg your pardon . I ought to have more trust in the goodness of God . '
177554	177562	177563	177563	she	367	' It is little to be unhappy , '
177573	177615	177563	177563	she	367	' one may be unhappy , yet endure it . The horrible change is when one falls from the ideal and is willing to believe in universal disorder , as though it were no use to hold by what is good . '
177688	177694	177695	177695	she	367	' It seems very late , '
178671	178677	178678	178678	His	3978	' fasting from earthly joys . '
178746	178801	178727	178727	he	3978	' In the sixth chapter , twenty - third verse , of his Epistle to the Romans , St. Paul has written , " The wages of sin"—he paused , seemed to lift the crucifix ever so little , and to let it fall as he uttered the conclusion of his text—"is death . " '
178888	178897	178878	178878	she	367	' Speak on , what is your message ? '
179461	179466	179468	179469	the preacher	3978	' Was that all ? '
179480	179643	179472	179472	he	3978	' Was the cup drained to the dregs ? Not so ; there remained a bitter draught , compared with which all bodily pain was little . From His Cross Jesus , opening His eyes on the world , meditating on the years He had spent , saw words and works alike frustrate , the good defeated , evil triumphant ; power , and wealth , and dominion , and knowledge , and religion itself , in the service of a lie . He was hanging on the Cross , not worshipped on the throne of the world . Why ? Because the world was Satan 's and all it contained . Therefore Christ was made an outcast , and His efforts came to naught . Suffering and death were the penalty of rebelling against the dominion of crowned and sceptred evil . In this sense , too , the wages of sin is death . To resist sin is to die . '
179816	179821	179822	179822	he	3978	' Sorrow is universal , '
179825	179856	179822	179822	he	3978	' it is like the air of heaven , we can not live out of it . And what shall we say ? Has it no meaning , no purpose ? '
179865	179868	179869	179869	he	3978	' Brethren , '
179882	179918	179869	179869	he	3978	' it has a meaning and a purpose . Its meaning is the moral of the Cross — the wages of sin ; its purpose is the triumph of the Cross , it is redemption . '
179959	179963	179964	179964	he	3978	' Was there , '
179967	180038	179964	179964	he	3978	' any other way of winning mankind , or of overcoming the powers of darkness save by this supreme resignation ? And who was it that failed and suffered loss in the battle which cost Jesus of Nazareth His life , His earthly honour , His glory , nay , the very peace of His human soul ? Was it Jesus or Satan that came to naught on that day ? '
180163	180282	180142	180142	he	3978	' Is Jesus dead ? or does He not give the mightiest token of life by making all those live that believe in Him ? They conquer themselves by His indwelling spirit ; and when a man has become his own captive , he has subdued the world . Christ reigns in hearts innumerable of men and women ; on them , as on Him , sin has done its worst ; it has inflicted death , not once , but every time the cup of pitiless suffering has been held to their lips . But can it do more ? The pain which destroys only this lower happiness has become , for such , redemption without end . '
180565	181605	181607	181607	you	4012	' searching , she felt like one that , watching from the deck of a deserted vessel , beholds the dawn breaking over a wintry and wreck - strewn sea . The illusions of life were at an end . She was wounded to the heart 's core . Had she , then , chosen hitherto the service of darkness , imagining that it would usher in the kingdom of light ? She remembered the text of her own gospel , taken from Goethe , I m Ganzen , Guten , Schönen fest zu leben . If the preacher were not wholly wrong , what a mockery it was ! Not order but disorder ; not good but evil ; not the beautiful , but this monstrous thing called sin — such had been the deities worshipped in her ignorance . She bowed her head in her hands and wept hot tears beneath her veil . Suddenly , while the voice of the preacher still resounded in the pulpit , Hippolyta saw the vast congregation rising to their feet . Innumerable lights twinkled over the church ; almost every one present held a taper which seemed to have been lit at a preconcerted signal . The preacher 's face was half - turned away to the high altar . Hippolyta , doing mechanically like the others , rose from her seat ; and the devout woman next to whom she had been sitting put a lighted taper into her hand , which , not knowing why , she held aloft as she saw them all doing . The people began , with the thunder of their many voices , to repeat a solemn formula after the priest ; and Hippolyta , her ear more accustomed to what was going forward , could now distinguish words renouncing evil and dedicating those who uttered them to the service and the Cross of their Redeemer . She could not join in the words , but her tears fell fast . The good woman near looked at her very kindly . And while she was endeavouring to conceal her emotion , she happened to look across the church , and there , not a long way from the pulpit , she saw William Dauris standing with a taper in his hand , not bowed down with sorrow as when she parted from him the evening before , but erect and firm in attitude repeating the words of dedication and renouncement , while the tears ran down his cheeks . A sense of thankfulness relieved the fulness of Hippolyta 's heart ; if she , too , continued weeping it was not with such extreme desolation . There was one , at least , who had vanquished his great enemy . She could not tell what followed ; her mind was all absorbed . The twinkling tapers were put out ; lights appeared far away in the chancel blazing over the high altar and around it ; figures in strange raiment came and went ; the smoke of incense ascended clouding the lights ; and music seemed to be filling the high roof above and rolling its waves on every side . It did not soothe , it excited her . She became conscious that she was meditating a daring resolution . At that moment she thought of no one but herself and the Form that seemed to be gazing at her still from the crucifix . There was an interval of intense stillness ; the organ had stopped , all heads were bent , and she saw something — she could not tell what — going forward at the altar . Thrice she heard the tinkle of an unseen bell ; and the music broke out again . Then the congregation rose from their kneeling posture and began to move down the aisles towards the door . Many of the gas - jets were turned off ; but one or another in Hippolyta 's neighbourhood was still kept burning . She knelt and covered her face with her hands . Deep thought kept her immovable . But ere long , when she lifted her head , she saw the preacher in his black habit and white surplice coming with rapid step down the church towards where she was kneeling . When he had arrived within a few paces of her , he turned and opened the half - doors of a tall upright construction in dark wood , which somewhat marred the architectural beauty of the Gothic building and reminded Hippolyta of the confessionals to which she had on one or two occasions seen people resorting in the churches of Paris and Rome . It was , no doubt , a confessional . She watched the ecclesiastic enter and fasten the doors after him ; she heard the click with which he drew aside something within ; and she saw a man and a woman take up their position at each side , where a curtain more than half - concealed the kneeling figures . After a while one of them rose and went away , followed , at no great interval , by the other . No fresh arrivals came ; and the priest , opening one of the upper partitions into which the doors were divided , looked out into the church and saw Hippolyta . She was kneeling still . He drew back , opened the other partition , and appeared as if sitting in a tribunal waiting till Hippolyta should come . As the fancy struck her she rose hastily , and without considering what she was doing , threw herself on her knees in the confessional . There was a wire grating between her and the priest ; and all she could make out was the glimmering of his white surplice . In an almost inaudible whisper he muttered some words , the sense of which was lost on her . She did not speak ; and after that one brief sentence neither for a time did he . At last , finding her so silent , he bent his head near the grating and said very distinctly , '
181621	181622	181607	181607	you	4012	' '
181628	181634	181607	181607	you	4012	' replied Hippolyta , confused ; '
181654	181655	181656	181657	Poor child	4017	' '
181659	181670	181673	181673	you	4012	' said the priest , more grieved apparently than astonished ; '
181694	181709	181691	181691	we	4019	' Hippolyta felt encouraged by his calmness . But what had she to say ? '
181716	181720	181710	181710	I	0	' she answered . '
181748	181768	181739	181739	you	4020	' There was no possibility of going on , she was so agitated . The priest heard her sobbing . '
181771	181780	181783	181783	you	4012	' he said very gently after a while , '
181796	181797	181794	181794	me	0	' '
181800	181805	181794	181794	me	0	' she replied wildly , '

181850	181871	181843	181843	you	4012	' he said in the same calm voice , like that of a physician at the bedside of a patient , '
181879	181880	181881	181881	I	0	' '
181884	181893	181881	181881	I	0	' was the answer given with heaving breath , '
181926	181927	181922	181922	him	7770	' '
181935	181940	181929	181929	he	7770	' inquired the priest . '
181945	181952	181929	181929	he	7770	' she said , weeping again ; '
181987	181988	181989	181989	You	4012	' '
181993	181999	181989	181989	You	4012	' answered the priest gravely , '
182034	182035	182015	182015	you	4012	' '
182041	182060	182038	182038	Magdalene	503	' said Hippolyta , with a sudden flush upon her face which made itself felt in the darkness . '
182075	182083	182084	182084	She	503	' The answer came slow and distinct , '
182102	183201	182095	182095	She	503	' When Hippolyta heard these words she waited for no more . Rising and turning from the confessional , she ran with a lightning - like speed to the door , and was lost in the night . The priest looked sorrowfully after her fleeting figure and shook his head . What would become of the strange penitent ? · · · · · · Hippolyta did not go far . At first the violent agitation of her spirits made it seem stifling to enter a house , and she walked down the Hill until she reached the turn where it became the London Road . It was a cold raw evening , and chilled her to the bone ; but the physical discomfort did her good by recalling her to the things of the lower world ; and after wandering for some half hour , she retraced her steps till she arrived at her own door . It was open , and the housekeeper , who appeared to have just come in , was taking some letters out of the letterbox , which , on seeing her mistress , she handed to her . Hippolyta looked at one of them . It was in her father 's handwriting , redirected from Falside . The other was from Rupert . On seeing it a terrible feeling of sickness and misery took possession of her whole being . She stood under the lamp which hung in the middle of the hall ceiling , tore open the enclosure , and read its contents . They were brief . Rupert , in his usual tone of devoted affection , announced that he should be coming up to London that very day , but should arrive too late to come on to Forrest House . He would settle some little business next morning as early as possible , and she might expect him , at latest , by twelve o'clock . Hippolyta shivered , put the letter in her pocket , and on Mrs. Leeming 's inquiry whether she would now dine , as it was getting late , she merely shook her head , and went slowly upstairs to her room , in which lights were burning . When she reached it she looked round as if in search of some object . What it was soon appeared . Among the many costly ivories with which her boudoir was decked Hippolyta had one day noticed a crucifix of exceedingly noble and finished execution , due probably to the hand of a Flemish artist of the Renaissance . An instinct had led her to take it down from the wall where it was hanging , and put it away out of sight in a drawer . She had a touch , if not more , of that dislike for seeing the emblem of sorrow continually before one 's eyes which has distinguished various poets and poetic natures of the century ; but whether it was that or something deeper which had prompted her to hide it long ago — what a weary time it seemed — she would have been unable to say . Now she took it out again , and set it up where the strong and steady light of a lamp would fall upon it . Her next action was to lock the door of her chamber and draw the curtains across the window , so as to shut out the view of the garden,—a measure hardly needed , for the darkness outside was very great . Not a breath of wind stirred among the dry branches or the foliage of the evergreens . In the house , as all round , a perfect stillness reigned . And in the silent night , amid the solitude of her own room , Hippolyta paced up and down , hour after hour , with the same intense self - concentration , the same sense that time was flying on the wings of night never to return , the same overwhelming dread of the morrow , which the condemned criminal must have in his prison - cell when that morrow is to see him die . Her thoughts were deep , confused , and overwhelming , recurring ever to the one theme which the preacher had handled with such portentous effect , — the guilt , the awfulness of breaking through the divine order . She had been so confident of her cause ; and it was her cause that had turned against her . To spread the light had ever appeared the only ambition worthy of her heroic soul ; but the light in her was deceptive , a mere marsh - light guiding to ruin . Instead of mounting the heights to which she aspired , she had flung herself into the mire , and she was now become an object of loathing to every honest man and woman . She , Hippolyta Valence , so conscious , so proud of her rectitude , was fallen , polluted , horrible to think upon like the women whom she had styled , in the excess of a self - admiring sympathy , her sisters . The revelation of sin as no phantom , or superstition , or conventional metaphor , but a foul and loathsome reality , had come upon her like a whirlwind blackening the sky . Sin , the most unwomanly , the least admitting of excuse or palliation , was it then become a part of her being , a record in the past never to be blotted out ? As in her mind she went over these things again and again , questioning , denying , admitting , shrinking from herself , yet not knowing how to escape into the sweet fresh air that , after she had been breathing it for so many months , had suddenly changed to miasma , her feeling was like that of a trapped wild beast ; she could have raged against herself , and in the fury of her disdain rushed upon death as a relief . She turned with the thought of it flaming in her eyes ; but the steady light still showed her the crucifix , and when her gaze went out to it , she remembered the words which described it as the image of supreme resignation . To kill herself would not be resignation or victory ; it would be pride and defeat . What though she had fallen , might she not rise again ? '
183207	183214	182095	182095	She	503	' she cried in her anguish ; '
183228	183579	182095	182095	She	503	' Tears had been given in the church to ease her overflowing heart ; but now she had no tears . The sweet short dream of delight was over . She might in a few hours go forward to meet Rupert Glanville with a smile on her face , concealing the canker - worm within . Did she choose to follow a desperate course , she might still feed upon the honey of these poisoned flowers and dare retribution . But where was the tranquillity of heart , the peace and loving security , which , as she now perceived , had been the foundation of her previous happiness ? Gone , gone , never to return . Conscience had inflicted a deadly wound upon her , and she hung writhing on the spear . The hours fled on . But why believe in what she had heard by accident ? What was there in common between Hippolyta Valence and this religion that so imperiously divided the light from the darkness ? There was no Satan , and Christ was dead and buried many ages ago . Suppose it a fable , a children 's story , an arabesque on the skirt of the eternal night . Alas ! it was impossible . Her sin had found her out ; to lapse into the delusion of innocence was beyond her for evermore . In this fearful noonday glare she beheld the stain , as though it were the spilt blood of murder , spreading over her soul and soaking into it , deep , deep . When the murderer dipped his hands in water , they were none the less polluted , but the water became crimson , mixed with the blood that fell into it . So , she went on saying to herself , it would be with marriage following on the loss of innocence ; it could not bring back what was lost , it could only suffer degradation because of it . A woman was either angel or demon ; she must be pure or impure . '
183585	183698	183583	183583	I	0	' said Hippolyta , shuddering , as in her pacing to and fro she came to a standstill before that silent figure on the Cross . Her anguish became unendurable . She threw open the window and looked out . All was dark and wintry . Through the stained glass of the lancet nearest her she seemed to distinguish a faint gleam as of a light still burning somewhere in the church . There were lamps , perhaps , that kept in all night . She could not imagine any one was there at such an hour , past one o'clock . Not a star was to be seen in the sky . '
183709	183736	183583	183583	I	0	' she murmured with a sigh , as she closed the window and drew the curtain again . But a voice within seemed to make reply , '
183763	184051	184053	184053	thou	4028	' and she was compelled to make a confession , as humiliating as it was salutary , that she had dreamt of being a sufficient light to herself . And what , in those arrogant days , had she known of the mighty , mysterious world ? Now the veil was withdrawn , the tragic prospect clear . She had been made to fix her thoughts , her eyes , her memory , on the existences which were governed by passionate , evanescent impulses , whether of love or hate ; the blind world of instinct , she saw , stood in need of a divine reason to overrule its manifold contradictory tendencies . Was it not the same with the blind world of man ? And how much blinder had she proved herself than those in whom ignorance was the outcome of incapacity or lack of education ? Hers had been wanton , self - asserting , criminal . Was Annie Dauris not saved ? Whose sin was that but Hippolyta 's . Was Rupert , the generous , confiding , devoted Rupert , lowered in his own eyes , turned from the path of happiness and honour , made to share in turpitude of which he had never dreamt ? Whose sin , whose unpardonable , damning sin was that but Hippolyta 's ? Could the murderer , the suicide , have done worse ? Thinking these accusing thoughts , seeing these horrible shadows trooping around her , discerning no way of escape , with an impetuous burst of tears Hippolyta cast herself prostrate on the ground before the crucifix , crying aloud again and again , amid the solitude of the dismal winter night , '
184062	184150	184053	184053	thou	4028	' · · · · · · It was nearly twelve o'clock at noon , and the sun was shining high and bright in the heavens , when Rupert Glanville , his face radiant with love and happiness , dashed up in a hansom cab to the gates of Forrest House . He sprang out hastily , dismissed the cabman , and ran as if wings were carrying him along the garden path into the hall . When the housekeeper saw him she turned red and pale . '
184156	184161	184153	184154	Mrs. Malcolm	451	' he cried gaily . '
184168	184196	184163	184163	she	451	' The housekeeper stood motionless , looked at him compassionately , and made no reply . He was struck with her silence , and his mood altered . '
184201	184206	184199	184199	woman	6532	' he said sternly . '
184216	184231	184209	184209	you	6532	' She put up her hand with a pitying gesture , and faltered out , '
184241	184243	184236	184237	Mrs. Malcolm	451	' — '
184246	184252	184255	184255	you	5663	' he repeated in amaze . '
184261	184512	184255	184255	you	5663	' Then she told him that on sending the maid as usual to wake her mistress that morning , the girl had found the door of her bedroom wide open , the bed not slept in , and Mrs. Malcolm not there . It was seven o'clock when they missed her . They had searched all over the house and in the garden ; they had sent to William Dauris , but all in vain . Not a trace of her was to be discovered . She seemed to have taken nothing with her but her cloak and hat . Rupert ran madly upstairs , rushed into Hippolyta 's boudoir , saw that everything was in perfect order as the servants had told him , and looked round like a man bewildered when he found no Hippolyta there . What had become of her ? Was it a dream ? He went by a natural instinct to her writing - table and examined the papers lying on it . They were of no importance ; they yielded no clue . But the blotting - book was wide open , and a sealed envelope with his initials outside caught his eye . As he tore it crosswise , in his eagerness , a plain gold ring fell out which he had induced Hippolyta to wear as Mrs. Malcolm , and round it a slip of paper . Written on the latter , in a trembling hand , were only these words , '
184524	184863	184513	184513	Rupert	242	' It was too true . Hippolyta had disappeared . The blow which had thus been struck at the heart of Rupert Glanville was so unexpected , and its occasion so wrapt in mystery , that the young man , on reading Hippolyta 's brief sentence , announcing as it should seem an everlasting farewell , refused to believe and stood there incapable of realising it . His face was calm as that of a man who has just been shot dead . Hippolyta vanished ? But why ? he asked himself again . She must have simply been called away by a sudden emergency ; she would return in a few hours ; or she had heard from Colonel Valence and he was in danger , dying perhaps , and in need of his daughter 's presence . Surely it was that which , giving her an overwhelming shock , had disturbed her reason ; that or the attack of disease alone could have made her set down those few wild words which he read again and again , vainly striving to make them tell more than their own meaning . He drew a chair to the writing - table , and sat down by it , looking out of the window in a dazed and helpless fashion , not able to think or to act , every faculty benumbed and a weight like ice in his bosom . The entrance of the housekeeper roused him as from a stupor . Ought they to do anything ? Had Mr. Malcolm any orders to give ? Rupert laughed sardonically on hearing the name which had gone with his golden honeymoon . It was nine months , almost to the day , since he brought Hippolyta from his studio to Forrest House . Nine months ! good heavens , how happy they had been , how swift to come and go , like a broad stream of sunshine losing itself in the smiling ocean ! It was all over . '
184870	184913	184916	184916	you	4034	' he murmured to himself . Or was he dreaming now ? The housekeeper spoke again ; and he gave a start at the sound of a strange voice in Hippolyta 's boudoir . He had forgotten that any one was there . '
184919	185185	184916	184916	you	4034	' he inquired , passing his hand over his forehead . Orders ! No , he had no orders to give ; and he turned over the scrap of paper which he held between his fingers , vaguely imagining there might be some message on the back which he had not seen , to say that it was all a jest , all make - believe , and Hippolyta would come ere the day was spent . There was nothing except the fatal sentences written on the paper ; he knew it before he looked . But this slight action brought him to himself . Hippolyta must have been seen when she went away ; if not by the servants , yet by those who were passing along the street , by the neighbours , the police , by whatever people might be about in the early morning . What if a misfortune to her father had driven her out of her mind , and she were wandering somewhere without any one to take care of her ! The thought was terrible , inciting him to lose no time in seeking her traces , and allowing him , till she should be found , to believe that she had not known what she was doing when she wrote him farewell . Was it not a symptom of madness that people turned against those they loved most dearly , and fled from them ? This appalling comfort that Hippolyta might be out of her mind was a sad testimony to the overthrow of Rupert 's happiness . '
185191	185197	184916	184916	you	4034	' he cried in despair , '
185271	185913	185917	185917	you	4040	' He was eager and active now ; the stupor had passed for a while , because a ray of hope seemed to be dawning again . The more he considered the stronger he found those evidences of Hippolyta 's mental aberration which the circumstances of her flight seemed to give . She had not taken anything with her in the shape of money or clothing ; she had made no preparations for a journey , long or short . Her books , correspondence , wardrobe , were all in perfect order , as Mrs. Leeming had seen them only the day before . There was no sign of hurry or confusion in the room , nothing out of place , except in that pleasant way which betokened that some one had made a home of it . The note she had received from Rupert and had read in the hall when she came in last night was lying on her dressing - table with her keys . Only her hat and cloak were gone . Rupert questioned the servants closely . Had any one found a door or window open that morning ? No , but the housemaid , on going to unbolt the front door , was astonished to observe that it was unfastened . Some one must or might have left the house that way ; all other means of exit were as they had been left the last thing at night . Had Mrs. Malcolm appeared in any way strange during the past few days ? Had she received letters , or heard agitating news , or done or said anything unusual ? In answer to these inquiries the housekeeper mentioned the two letters received last night , told what she knew of the trouble and flight of Annie Dauris , and of Hippolyta 's anxiety to discover and bring her back . The girl , she added , was not yet found ; neither did they seem aware at the gardener 's cottage of anything peculiar in Mrs. Malcolm 's conduct . They were very much attached to her , and she had displayed great kindness towards them . Rupert sent for William Dauris . The gardener came immediately , with an expression of intense sorrow in his countenance , and so deeply grieved on hearing of Hippolyta 's disappearance from home that he could hardly reply to the questions which Rupert addressed to him . He was evidently as much in the dark as any one else . He could not think so feeling a lady as Mrs. Malcolm would have set out on a long journey , especially if it was connected with his daughter , and not come to say good - bye , or at least send them word that she had found a clue . She had certainly been much troubled when she heard of Annie 's misbehaviour ; he knew that she had made inquiries everywhere , and had even gone into the East End herself to help them on . How did she go , Rupert asked , by what conveyance ? William Dauris could not say ; he thought the coachman had driven her . The coachman was sent for , and gave his account , which was not much . It had been Mrs. Malcolm 's custom to have herself driven a couple of miles along the London Road and then dismiss him . He believed that she often engaged a cab to take her much farther , into town , he supposed . But he had never driven farther himself except three days ago , when she told him to take her to an address in Grafton Place , Strand,—a Mr. Mardol's,—and afterwards — Rupert almost leaped out of the chair in which he was sitting . '
185920	185924	185917	185917	you	4040	' he cried . '
185936	185985	185933	185933	you	4040	' The coachman was quite sure . Not only had he asked Mrs. Malcolm the address twice over , but he heard Mr. Mardol 's name several times when he drove on to the East End , whither Mrs. Malcolm was accompanied by a gentleman from Grafton Place . '
185992	186001	185933	185933	you	4040	' exclaimed Rupert with a sigh of relief ; '
186034	186083	186027	186027	you	4040	' Thomson had not felt certain that it mattered , or he would have spoken . He knew the house in Grafton Place , and the other off Saffron Hill . If Mr. Malcolm wished to see them himself , he could get the brougham ready at once . '
186091	186096	186089	186089	Thomson	505	' said his master ; '
186149	186189	186141	186141	I	0	' The coachman departed on his errand ; and William Dauris , who had been standing silently near during this conversation , took heart again on seeing how Rupert 's face brightened . He appeared like a changed man . '
186198	186204	186194	186195	Mrs. Malcolm	451	' said the gardener timidly . '
186210	186221	186194	186195	Mrs. Malcolm	451	' replied Rupert , shaking him warmly by the hand ; '
186239	186258	186229	186229	Ladies	718	' he said , smiling as one does to assure friends that one has escaped a great peril . '
186264	186268	186259	186259	I	0	' said William , '
186294	186442	186280	186280	She	8594	' He said no more , but went away quietly . Rupert , who had not taken off the travelling wraps in which he had alighted from the hansom , walked from the front door to the gate and back again , up and down the garden path , till the brougham came in sight . He at once ran to meet it , leaped in , and told the coachman to use his utmost speed till they reached Grafton Place . He would willingly have galloped with the horses , so great was his excitement . To have done with the journey and clasp Hippolyta in his arms again — he could think of nothing else . He would forgive her at the first word ; but she must never so frighten him again . In the midst of these disjointed reflections the thought presented itself , '
186452	186563	186445	186445	she	4046	' Why , he replied at once to himself , he had not fancied she would be there ; at least it could not signify ; Ivor would know where she was , what motive had induced her to leave home suddenly , and in what frame of mind she had come to him . The reason of their meeting was plain enough . Ivor , Hippolyta , and Colonel Valence were all mixed up in that mad revolutionary movement which appeared to delight in these mysterious vanishings and trap - door scenes ; there had been some plan afoot , and Hippolyta was required to take part in it . '
186566	186585	186586	186586	I	0	' said Rupert , in a gayer mood now that he was going to see her very soon , '
186627	186748	186612	186612	she	367	' The drive was horribly long , but it could not last for ever . At a little distance from the house Rupert pulled the check - string and got out . It might be an alarm or a warning to the conspirators , as he termed Ivor and Hippolyta in his recovered good - humour , if the carriage were to drive up to the door . Bidding Thomson , therefore , wait round the corner , he walked on briskly to his friend 's house , with which he was familiar from of old , and rang the bell as quietly as the agitation of his nerves would let him . The door was not opened at once . '
186751	186758	186612	186612	she	367	' he said under his breath , '
186782	186799	186774	186774	I	0	' He had hardly got the words out of his mouth when Ivor opened the door . '
186806	186811	186802	186802	you	0	' he cried joyously ; '
186863	186988	186859	186859	I	0	' And with delight overspreading his rugged features Ivor , lifting the curtain of stamped leather with one hand , pushed Rupert gently forward with the other into his workroom . A lad , who happened to be assisting him , retired at the sight of a stranger through another exit . Rupert was half - minded to call him back . He dreaded some trick of collusion , he knew not why . Ivor had never deceived him in his life ; but in the present excitement suspicion caught at a film of gossamer . The boy disappeared ; and Rupert , who could endure the suspense no longer , turned at once on his friend without preface or introduction , and cried , '
186996	187002	186991	186992	Miss Valence	367	' Ivor stared at him . '
187006	187028	187003	187004	Miss Valence	367	' he repeated . He seemed quite lost . Rupert thought he was dissembling , and he could not bear it . '
187034	187043	187031	187032	Miss Valence	367	' reiterated the artist in an angry voice . '
187056	187072	187050	187050	you	277	' And he took Ivor by the shoulder . The astonishment of the latter increased . '
187079	187096	187075	187077	my dear fellow	4052	' he said , looking for an explanation of this strange scene in Rupert 's eyes , '
187115	187122	187106	187106	I	0	' Rupert turned white with passion . '
187128	187132	187134	187134	she	367	' he exclaimed , '
187164	187176	187159	187159	you	277	' Ivor was bewildered still , but not quite so much . '
187179	187184	187159	187159	you	277	' was his reply , '
187201	187209	187194	187194	I	0	' And then , turning to Rupert , '
187250	187267	187244	187244	she	4054	' Rupert , listening impatiently , was now bewildered in his turn . He said slowly , '
187286	187287	187272	187272	you	277	' '
187302	187307	187296	187296	I	0	' said his friend ; '
187323	187350	187272	187272	you	277	' He made Glanville sit down , and , in drawing him towards the light , was disconcerted at seeing the ashy paleness of his cheek . '
187359	187433	187353	187353	Heaven	506	' he inquired with anxious affection . Rupert kept studying every expression that passed over his friend 's features , anticipating , somehow , that the mask would fall and the truth declare itself . But Ivor looked the soul of candour and innocence . The artist was staggered . He sat up , pulled himself together with an effort , and said , with an imploring accent in each of his words : '
187488	187489	187483	187483	she	4061	' '
187496	187500	187490	187490	I	0	' said Ivor , '
187557	187568	187546	187546	She	4061	' he hesitated for a moment , but continued deliberately , '
187625	187709	187710	187710	I	0	' Unless Ivor was playing a part with unparalleled sang froid and equal heartlessness , he must be speaking the truth . Still , he was not his own master ; there might be an obligation among Socialists to deceive one 's dearest friends for the good of the society , thought Rupert ; and in that case it would be in vain to persevere with his questions . The fear of losing Hippolyta returned with horrible force . He must try again . '
187722	187727	187720	187720	Ivor	277	' he began mildly ; '
187775	187854	187764	187764	I	0	' There was the sound of tears in his voice . Ivor , if not sincere , was a consummate villain , who did not need to learn from the greatest how to tear his friend 's heart . He stood seemingly in the uttermost bewilderment , incapable of answering a word , and trying to make sense of what had just been spoken by Rupert . When at length he found his voice he did but mutter , '
187861	187906	187855	187856	Miss Valence	367	' as though the two names were a subject of unmixed surprise and perplexity to him . Nay , the sight of Rupert 's affliction moved him almost to tears , and he said , forgetting apparently what had been asked by the latter : '
187970	188045	188047	188047	my	0	' The artist 's suspicions were not to be laid by kindness . He knew only too well that Hippolyta had conveyed the message to Ivor Mardol , which compelled him to quit Trelingham on a secret expedition . This questioning about his own interest in Miss Valence was to throw him off the scent . He cursed Socialism and the revolutionary ideas which made a friend like Ivor disloyal , as he answered : '
188109	188110	188111	188111	Rupert	242	' '
188124	188131	188132	188132	I	0	' exclaimed Ivor in unfeigned distress . '
188173	188174	188163	188163	I	0	' '
188193	188200	188176	188177	Miss Valence	367	' inquired Rupert with intense sternness . '
188204	188208	188176	188177	Miss Valence	367	' replied Ivor ; '
188224	188228	188216	188216	I	0	' he paused . '
188232	188236	188216	188216	I	0	' said Rupert . '
188274	188275	188265	188265	I	0	' '
188279	188289	188265	188265	I	0	' said Glanville sullenly , rising as he spoke . '
188308	188318	188319	188319	You	242	' He went to the door . Ivor followed . '
188332	188342	188327	188327	you	242	' he said tremulously , endeavouring to detain him . '
188348	188364	188345	188345	I	0	' he returned , shaking off the hand that was laid affectionately on his arm . '
188375	189147	188345	188345	I	0	' He threw open the front door and walked into the street . Ivor , wounded in his deepest feelings , and more sensitive to the change in Rupert 's affection than to the affront he had received , stood on the threshold watching him till he turned the corner . It would be no use calling him back while he was in such a mood . Ivor shut the door , went back to his workroom and took up the plate on which he was engaged . He could not go on with it ; his thoughts were all abroad , and his fingers would not serve him . After nearly a year 's absence to meet and part like this ! Rupert was not a good correspondent , resembling in that particular most men of genius , who find occupation without difficulty , and are loth to forego present delights for the monotonous work of recording the incidents of the day . But few letters , therefore , had passed between these friends ; and the nature of Ivor 's cosmopolitan interests on the one side , combined with Rupert 's desire to conceal Hippolyta 's residence and way of living on the other , had made intimate correspondence difficult , if not impossible . Love is the sworn foe of friendship , and puts out lesser lights , as the sun quenches the stars . Nor is cosmopolitan or religious enthusiasm , which you can not share with a friend , less likely to estrange you from him . In spite of all this , the devotion of Rupert to Ivor was intense and heartfelt ; while Ivor would have sacrificed their friendship to nothing less sacred than a sense of duty . Had he done so now ? His confession or the discovery of Hippolyta alone could decide . So Rupert might have argued in cold blood . But his blood was not cold ; it was boiling in his veins as he walked away in search of the brougham , convinced that Ivor had sheltered Hippolyta or was conversant with her design in quitting Forrest House . At that instant he cared not a jot for any man 's friendship ; and he flung Ivor 's from him as a thing soiled and worthless . He would be his own friend and seek Hippolyta till he found her . Who was the other she had called on ? Thomson would know . He stopped the carriage , which was slowly moving up and down , and before he entered it , made the coachman repeat what he had begun to say in the morning about driving Mrs. Malcolm to some place near Saffron Hill . Thomson had a good local memory , and knew the street near St. Audry 's Church . He had seen the clergyman , also , as he was handing Mrs. Malcolm to her carriage . Rupert told him to drive thither . He could not conceive how a clergyman should come into the story ; but it was so mad a world , and the rage of new opinions had spread into such unsuspected quarters , that his surprise by no means equalled his determination to find out the share which this apparently socialistic preacher had taken in decoying Hippolyta . It was late in the afternoon and already dusk when the brougham drew up as near Mr. Regan 's as it could be safely taken . Rupert , not venturing to give his card , whether as Mr. Glanville of Clarence Gardens , or Mr. Malcolm of Forrest House , merely said in answer to the servant who answered his knock , that he had urgent business with the clergyman . She had admitted that he was at home , although Rupert , not knowing his name , or whether there were one or more , had made a random guess in simply asking for him under that general designation . When he spoke of urgent business , she left him standing in the dark passage and disappeared . Returning not long after , she showed him into the sitting - room , which was almost as dark ; and there he waited , considering with himself how he should begin the cross - examination to which he intended to submit the unknown ecclesiastic . Mr. Regan came in , apologised for the want of light , turned on the gas , and made ready to listen . The artist judged it prudent to begin with Ivor Mardol 's name . '
189151	189158	189149	189149	me	0	' said Mr. Regan at once , '
189202	189208	189209	189209	I	0	' Rupert looked at him . '
189223	189228	189209	189209	I	0	' he said curtly ; '
189253	189254	189255	189255	I	0	' '
189261	189270	189255	189255	I	0	' exclaimed the clergyman in accents of dismay ; '
189307	189308	189309	189309	I	0	' '
189313	189321	189309	189309	I	0	' said Rupert , his face darkening ; '
189337	189384	189329	189330	the lady	722	' The murder was out , he said to himself . These were all meshes of a net in which , by whose fault it did not signify , Hippolyta had been entangled . Mr. Regan examined his visitor 's looks , and became more cautious . '
189431	189432	189412	189412	she	722	' '
189447	189455	189435	189435	you	4075	' inquired Rupert , moderating his tone . '
189471	189566	189435	189435	you	4075	' But the clergyman was not to be disarmed . He had a great regard for his brother , worthless though Maurice had proved himself . On many a previous occasion he had thrown the shield of silence over his delinquencies ; and the stern , serious manner of the artist , who gave no name and seemed to have business of an unpleasant sort in hand , determined him to say as little as possible . Instead , therefore , of disclosing the errand on which Hippolyta had come , he answered deliberately : '
189609	189779	189780	189780	My	0	' Except in Forrest House and among the acquaintance of his servants , who could not be expected not to talk of their master , Rupert had never assumed the style and title of Malcolm . What name should he give ? Would this suspicious clergyman tell him anything he did not know , even when he had run the risk — for a risk it was in either case — of appearing as Malcolm or in his own name ? It did not seem probable . Allowing , as was now evident , that the motive for Hippolyta 's leaving home — he still called it home — was connected with the designs of revolutionists , he might be certain that they would guard their secret jealously . He must try another means . These thoughts passed through his brain while he was putting on his glove . He had remained standing , and Mr. Regan had not come many steps inside the door . He now said : '
189836	190010	190011	190014	The Reverend Philip Regan	511	' He meant it for a threat of suicide , and Hippolyta , he thought , would so understand it . Mr. Regan answered , with much dignity , that he did not suppose the lady would call again . He was a frigidly - correct , not an inquisitive man ; and although , a few moments after Rupert left the house , he heard the sound of wheels driving away , he would not so much as look through the window to ascertain what species of conveyance it was that had brought his anonymous and unwelcome visitor . Rupert , on the other hand , when he had been driven the length of a street , bethought himself that it would be well to know the clergyman 's name . He got out , therefore , and inquired at a little shop hard by who it was that lived at the address he mentioned , for he had learnt that from Thomson . The shopman , not without pomposity , answered , '
190016	190025	190011	190014	The Reverend Philip Regan	511	' A light flashed across Rupert 's mind . '
190029	190033	190026	190027	Philip Regan	511	' he said , '
190146	190757	190759	190759	him	4097	' He groaned aloud when he thought of it . Was she the guileless creature he had loved and worshipped , or full of design and treachery ? Oh , it did not matter now , not now ; let her only come back and his heart would be open to her as of old . How could he live without Hippolyta ? The strong man leaned his head upon his hand , crying like a child , as the carriage rolled forward through the interminable London streets , the gas - lamps flaring on each side of it , and the noise of traffic and the roar of vehicles seeming to mock his grief with their soulless reverberations . Where was she now , when the night had drawn on , when every one that had home or shelter made towards it ? She was in peril and far from the heart that loved her best in all the world ; he knew no more , but alas , he could not be uncertain of that . She was surely miserable and a wanderer on the face of the earth . Perhaps she was alone ; or , if not , in the power of villains who would make of her , generous , confiding , ardent as she was , the tool of their murderous ambition . Other women , carried away by the frenzy of revolution , had whetted the knife or sharpened the dagger . And Hippolyta , with her wild enthusiasm , might think to emulate the Charlotte Cordays who had risen up throughout Europe in these anarchic times . When Rupert thought over it all , he cursed Edgar Valence and Ivor Mardol , to whose influence early or late he attributed the evil which had fastened on Hippolyta like a disease . But for Colonel Valence , the love which had innocently sprung up between them would ere now have been crowned with marriage , and Hippolyta be happy as the wife of one whose reputation , at any rate , was not altogether unmatched with her beauty and grace . Or , allowing the first false step , she might still have dwelt in seclusion , surrounded with every homage , her slightest wish anticipated , enjoying happiness and giving it in the way she had chosen . But no . What her father began , this false friend must accomplish . She had sacrificed the world to Rupert ; she had now been prevailed upon to sacrifice him and all his hopes and joys to the Revolution . Glanville was cut to the heart . What should he do to - morrow , when no Hippolyta was near him ? And would to - morrow be only the first of many days to be endured alone , without love , without friendship , all the light gone out of his life ? Surely he must find her or make an end . With these sad thoughts weighing on him , Rupert arrived , after his long journey through the lamp - lit streets and the straggling suburban lanes , at Forrest House . He sat alone at table and forced himself to eat , knowing how much was to be done , or attempted , on that morrow which he dreaded to see . It was like a meal at the side of the grave . His food choked him . There was no letter or message from any one . William Dauris had come round at nightfall and inquired whether Mrs. Malcolm were returned , or what news they had . '
190767	191426	190759	190759	him	4097	' said Rupert wearily . He did not desire to see the man ; he shrank from contact with any one that had known Hippolyta as from everything she had touched . But the latter feeling gave way to overpowering tenderness when , late at night , he entered her boudoir and sat down in her favourite place near the window . There the signs of her recent presence , the trinkets lying in a pretty feminine disorder , the scarf thrown carelessly down , were so many arrows to wound him . How well he remembered their bright caressing lovetalk during those long summer evenings , when they watched the stars rising like silent silver fires into the sky and shining down upon them peacefully ! How beautiful she looked when , her eyes seeming to kindle under her golden hair , she spoke in tender accents of the charm that love had cast over them both , and of its glamour which was life , and truth , and the heart of existence ! He had been delighted and amazed , during those hours of rapture , at her strange high poetry . Alas , alas , had she not been such a votaress of enthusiastic beliefs , had there been mingled in her some grains of vulgar commonplace , she would be now turning his solitude to heaven . But he rebuked the profane thought . Hippolyta might be impulsive , wild , demoniac in her headlong aspirations ; vulgar or commonplace she never could be . It was her unlikeness to other women , her supremacy of spirit as of outward loveliness , that had brought him to her feet . And the deity was vanished , the shrine broken . He sat during the night alone with his sorrow , going over these things till the repetition racked his brain . Alone , indeed , he was ; singularly , fatally alone , now that he had broken with Ivor Mardol . If Hippolyta was gone the way he supposed,—and what other way could she have gone?—but one man in London could aid in her recovery , and that man 's lips were sealed ; or rather , he was the criminal and would be the last to confess his crime . Ivor was daring and resolute ; he believed — like Robespierre , said Glanville to himself — in his own integrity , and behind him were the resources of a great association , pledged to second its agents in whatever they undertook , and hesitating at no turpitude . What was Rupert against such odds ? He might instruct his lawyer , call in the police , offer rewards ; and when he had done all this , the only result would be to publish Hippolyta 's disgrace to the light of day and blast his own character . What he did , therefore , must be done warily ; he could not take any one into his confidence . In the neighbourhood of Forrest House it would be incumbent on him to appear as Mr. Malcolm ; but he dared not present himself under a feigned name to the police authorities . Mardol and Hippolyta had doubtless weighed these things , and knew how difficult they made pursuit and discovery . The more he thought of them now , the less he was inclined to his first conjecture , that disaster had turned her brain , and her flight had taken place in an hour of madness . Nothing , it should seem rather , had been wanting to the deliberation of it . What cruel , cold words she had left behind , as her farewell to the man she loved ? They stabbed him again and again with their icy point ; he could bear almost anything else , but not to recall that line and a half . '
191431	191458	190759	190759	him	4097	' he said to himself with the curious aptitude we have for remembering well - known verses or sayings when our nerves are highly strung , — '
191481	192888	191479	191479	Hamlet	300	' he cried . But something must be done without delay . He would return to his house in Belgravia , to be nearer the scene of action , if action there should be . For it was not imaginable that Hippolyta would show herself in the vicinity of Forrest House , situate in an out - of - the - way , peaceable suburb , not known for its connection with aught more revolutionary than borough politics . Much more likely that she had left England and was travelling to Berlin , or St. Petersburg , or New York , to the centre of the storm - cloud that might be on the point of bursting on the head of Prince or President . What were the newspapers discussing ? They sometimes held out storm - warnings of this kind also , and might for once be useful to him . Glaville did not believe in journalism , and seldom read a line in the daily prints . But now he went to his club , and sitting down in the library , which at that time of day was solitary as an African wilderness , turned over the files of the week 's intelligence . Pah , how vapid it seemed ! Did the nations put this stale vinegar to their lips every morning , and take it as sent down overnight from the suppers of the gods ? What rinsings of Olympus ! He turned the pages to and fro , travelled down the leading articles , sounded the solemn depths of the Foreign Correspondence . It left him uncertain . There were plots and rumours of plots , meetings of European workmen , strikes at Breslau , at St. Etienne , at Barnsley , on the railroads of New England , and among the cotton - spinners in Italy . Signs of a possible storm he read everywhere , but from what quarter would the lightning flash out ? An infernal machine of the latest invention had been discovered at the Winter Palace , in the Emperor 's writing - desk , and several of his confidential aides - decamp had been arrested on suspicion . The police had dissolved a socialistic gathering of Free Czechs at Prague ; and the guard round the English Prime Minister was to be considerably strengthened in consequence of the last attempt to blow up his country seat . In yesterday 's Times Glanville read with a beating heart that two women had been stopped by the Belgian police on their way from London to Brussels , and that compromising documents had been found in their possession which indicated the outbreak of another dynamite enterprise , though whether in Moscow or St. Petersburg it was not as yet possible to say . The description given tallied in neither case with Hippolyta , and the news was too recent ; yet Glanville could hardly restrain himself from starting at once for Ostend . When , however , he reflected that his presence and the inquiries he must make would serve , in a foreign country , only to inculpate Hippolyta , if she were one of the women captured , and that more light would be thrown on the affair in the course of the next few days , he judged it prudent not to run after an uncertainty . One thing was clear , that Colonel Valence 's daughter , if disposed to thrust herself into peril , might find the occasion wherever she happened to cast her eyes . The battle seemed to be raging along the whole line . As he read on , not knowing what else to do , his attention was caught by one of the many advertisements which promise secrecy and success in the investigation of cases like Hippolyta 's . He wondered that he had not thought of it before . But Glanville was a man who would hardly stoop to pluck a jewel out of the mire if there was a likelihood of soiling his fingers . The idea of a private police was repugnant to him , and was associated in his mind with every form of vice and degradation . Truly , it might be said of this artist - temperament that he was gentlemanly to his very finger - tips . Now , however , when he required a search to be made , and could not turn to the authorities of Scotland Yard , he clutched at the only means which appeared feasible ; and taking the man 's name and address , went home and despatched thence a carefully worded letter , in which he begged him to come immediately to Clarence Gardens on a matter of the utmost urgency . He might name his own terms , but there must be as little delay as possible . Glanville , after reflection , had resolved to prosecute the search in his own name . It was well he did so , for Mr. Bernstein , when he appeared in the course of a couple of hours and was introduced into Rupert 's study , began the conversation easily with an allusion to the artist 's fame , and the pleasure it gave him to recognise the fidelity of the portrait which had created such a sensation in the Academy two years ago . Glanville , whose talent for self - mockery had been a good deal cultivated , said in reply , that to be famous was indeed a fine thing , and offered to paint Mr. Bernstein , if that gentleman would sit to him . The answer was a not unpleasant smile , which served as garnish to the aphorism , pronounced by the detective with a business - like air , that time was money . He preferred to sit on golden eggs rather than in the luxurious but expensive chair to which Glanville invited him . The artist , however , had been really struck with the capacities of Mr. Bernstein as a subject . As his name indicated , he was a German , or more accurately speaking , a Polish Jew . It is possible that in the sacred pages of the Almanach de Gotha — a volume never to be mentioned without reverence — there may be illustrious and even princely Bernsteins . But this was not one of them . Plebeian , not prince , was stamped on his yellow forehead , his starved and sallow countenance , and his drooping shoulders . He was of unusually small stature , though not a dwarf ; and the meagreness of his general appearance denoted either scant opportunities of eating , or a severe control over the grosser appetites . But it was the pear - shaped head , with its flaming coal - black eyes , and long , curling , coal - black hair , that had drawn Glanville 's admiration . The vitality in that dried - up organism must have been immense ; it seemed to pour out at the eyes and to overspread the parchment - like features ; it was suggested in the snaky curls which would doubtless , if one touched them , give out electric sparks like the back of a tiger . The man , though no patrician , was full of intellect and energy ; there could not have been a drop of Western blood in his veins , nor a fold of Teutonic dulness in his brain . Glanville beheld him with the same mingling of wonder , curiosity , and dislike which he had felt in reading the grimmest pages of the Old Testament . He was a leaf torn out of the Book of Judges . When he had taken a seat where he could observe Glanville closely , and the artist was reflecting how he could give sufficient information for the purpose of recovering Hippolyta , yet keep himself in the background of his narrative , Mr. Bernstein , who , with his head slightly bent on the right side , appeared to be looking him through and through , lifted his yellow hand impressively , and with forefinger held up as if to bespeak earnest attention , began in a strong penetrating voice , where the German accent made itself harshly felt , '
193060	193149	193054	193054	I	0	' He unbent his warning attitude and leaned back in his chair . Glanville , though in deep trouble of mind , could not refrain from smiling at the quotation , so quaintly borrowed for the purposes of private inquiry from Romeo and Juliet , as well as at the straightforward shrewdness of the old man , who spoke with official gravity . But the words came home . What should he disclose , what keep to himself ? He took the wa that promised the least difficulty . '
193153	193160	193054	193054	I	0	' he said to Mr. Bernstein , '
193181	193182	193178	193179	A lady	6422	' '
193186	193198	193178	193179	A lady	6422	' said Mr. Bernstein , taking out his pocket - book ; '
193204	193205	193206	193206	Her	6422	' '
193246	193247	193234	193234	I	0	' '
193253	193269	193250	193251	Mr. Malcolm	452	' inquired the Jew , scrutinising his every feature . Glanville was at a standstill . '
193273	193278	193234	193234	I	0	' said the other , '
193321	193322	193344	193345	Mr. Malcolm	452	' '
193325	193336	193344	193345	Mr. Malcolm	452	' said Rupert , forcing the words through his teeth , '
193347	193348	193344	193345	Mr. Malcolm	452	' '
193351	193356	193344	193345	Mr. Malcolm	452	' was the answer , '
193399	193400	193391	193392	the gentleman	7395	' '
193406	193415	193391	193392	the gentleman	7395	' returned the artist , blushing all over ; '
193424	193435	193391	193392	the gentleman	7395	' The Israelite shook his head in sign of doubt . '
193444	193461	193391	193392	the gentleman	7395	' he replied with a philosophic smile , and then shrugging his shoulders as he spoke ; '
193512	193658	193665	193665	he	4112	' Rupert , omitting the scene in the studio , which he despaired of making credible to this hard - headed cynic , as he appeared to be , told all the rest faithfully so far as knew it . There was so little , however , to tell . The Jew , as if he had been a Queen 's Counsel examining a hostile witness , obliged him to discriminate between the facts about which there could be no doubt , and the inferences which Glanville was inclined to draw from them . But he did so with a gentleness that encouraged and did not confuse the mind ; he was astonishingly observant of the artist all through , and seemed to take down his notes with a flash of lightning . When the flight of Annie Dauris was mentioned , followed at three days '
193672	193710	193665	193665	he	4112	' Have you searched out the antecedents of that young woman ? The case grows clearer . I daresay when we come upon the trace of Annie Dauris we shall discover the second gentleman not far off . '
193825	193854	193815	193816	the Jew	9372	' Why did you not begin at the beginning ? There may be two leading motives here . Was Miss Valence a Nihilist before you made her acquaintance ? '
193855	193863	193865	193865	Glanville	242	' She has been educated in revolution , '
193867	193899	193865	193865	Glanville	242	' it is her own and her father 's creed . Colonel Valence has taken a decided share in all the movements of the last thirty years against the social order . '
193911	193922	193923	193923	he	516	' Let me hear all you know about Colonel Valence , '
193926	193931	193923	193923	he	516	' especially his aliases . '
193932	193936	193938	193938	Glanville	242	' His what ? '
193945	193972	193974	193975	the Jew	9372	' The names under which he has travelled . You do not suppose a conspirator has only one set of visiting - cards in his pocket , '
193978	193986	193988	193988	Glanville	242	' I know nothing of all that , '
193990	194006	193988	193988	Glanville	242	' Miss Valence never talked to you of her father or of secret societies then ? '
194007	194040	194050	194051	Mr. Bernstein	516	' Never in that way . I did not wish for confidences about them . It was the same with Ivor Mardol . If he had an alias I never learnt it . '
194041	194048	194050	194051	Mr. Bernstein	516	' No , that is evident , '
194053	194071	194050	194051	Mr. Bernstein	516	' and Mrs. Malcolm , you say , took no money with her when she left you ? '
194072	194103	194050	194051	Mr. Bernstein	516	' Not a shilling , I believe ; not even what was in her purse , which I picked up next morning on the floor by her writing - table . '
194158	194385	194141	194141	his	9372	' There are several alternatives , of which the least probable is that Colonel Valence , acting alone , has sent for his daughter . That will be seen into , but for the present may be omitted . The others reduce themselves to these : Miss Valence , acting in collusion with Annie Dauris , which we may take for granted , has put herself under the protection either of Maurice Regan or Ivor Mardol , whichever of them she has fallen in love with . Your mistake , my dear sir , lay in your supposing that a lady , brought up in the principles of the Revolution and among revolutionists , would or could remain faithful to a man who did not satisfy that side of her temperament . No doubt her inclination for yourself was very powerful , but it was not rooted in the deepest passion of all , to which it has now yielded . You may be right in supposing that she has been engaged , or will be later on , in carrying out the Nihilist designs ; I should think it very likely . But it will always be under the orders of her lover . We have found the gentleman , you see . What makes it slightly embarrassing is that there are two of them . '
194386	194393	194395	194395	Rupert	242	' I can not believe it , '
194411	194427	194141	194141	his	9372	' I had rather see her dead than so shamefully dishonoured . It is impossible . '
194428	194433	194435	194436	the Jew	9372	' Yes , yes , '
194438	194456	194457	194457	he	9372	' you naturally feel so . And yet these impossible things are mostly true . À propos , '
194468	194481	194457	194457	he	9372	' there has been no search made in the dead - houses ? '
194482	194485	194487	194487	Rupert	242	' Where ? '
194495	194517	194487	194487	Rupert	242	' You — you must not say such things to me , or I shall do you or myself a mischief . '
194552	194561	194562	194562	he	242	' Why do you not go at once ? '
194577	194598	194562	194562	he	242	' Inquire everywhere . Put out a reward . Tell the police to have the canals , the Serpentine dragged . '
194599	194608	194610	194611	the Jew	9372	' Patience , patience , my dear sir , '
194616	194671	194610	194611	the Jew	9372	' everything shall be done as it ought . Is it not a proverb with you , the more haste the worse speed ? We can not inform the police like that . If they meddle , they will do as they have always done , and throw out the child with the bathwater . '
194672	194678	194680	194680	Glanville	242	' What do you mean ? '
194689	194741	194742	194742	he	242	' I mean that the Nihilists , or Socialists , call them what you will , have friends among the police , or among their acquaintance , and therefore can know when they are coming . It is not my way to employ the police . And see you , sir , '
194754	194921	194742	194742	he	242	' I will show you my mind as if you were reading it on paper . I do not feel sure that we shall recover Mrs. Malcolm . If it was only an affair of the heart , I could promise something . For love is very indiscreet and given to talk ; and he does not mind being found out , he is so proud of himself . But there is another passion here , nearly as strong , which desires concealment and knows many hiding - places all over Europe . More than that , I have not any business with secret societies . I am a stranger to politics and revolutions ; and the province I have assigned myself is entirely confined to private life . If I was to put my hand into politics I should be putting it into the wolf 's throat . One must not lie between the hammer and the anvil or it will go bad with one . '
194922	194931	194933	194933	Rupert	242	' But you will take up this inquiry , '
194935	194984	194933	194933	Rupert	242	' if I ask you , and pay whatever you demand . The politics are nothing to me — only bring back Miss Valence ; it is all I want . For what I care , the Nihilists may blow up the Tower of London to - morrow . '
194985	195001	195003	195004	the Israelite	4120	' That would not be my sentiment if I were an English citizen like you , '
195006	195248	195003	195004	the Israelite	4120	' But you do not understand my position . I have to live and move about in a subterranean region , which is full of mines and — how do you say?—countermines . Look , it is like a London street . Under the pavement which the carriages of the great people roll over , there are the water - pipes , and under them the gas is laid , and beneath that again is the main drainage , and deep down , in the bowels of the earth where all should be still as a mouse , there is the railway with the trains tearing along,—you say tearing ? — and there are stations with their lights , and the boys selling journals , and people eating and drinking at buffets , and I know not what . Such is the world to which I also belong . The police do not like me , for I take the bread out of their mouths ; the International does not like me , for it is impossible that I should not know of their doings one day or another ; and so my people encounter great risks . I tell you , then , that if Mrs. Malcolm has thrown herself under the ægis of the revolution , I may hunt out where she is , but to bring her back I can not give a pledge . Is it understood ? '
195298	195325	195326	195326	He	242	' For God 's sake , let me have tidings of her , and we will decide the rest then . Only lose no more time . '
195442	195448	195439	195439	he	516	' the basis of operations . '
196405	196409	196398	196398	Rupert	242	' Thank you , '
196890	196913	196914	196914	He	242	' Ask the question here ; it is a workhouse which you pass when you are driving to the station for Trelingham . '
196962	196967	196968	196968	he	242	' Bernstein , then , '
196973	196989	196968	196968	he	242	' is taking pains , as he promised . Why do I not go home ? '
197873	197963	197964	197964	he	516	' We have likewise examined Mr. Mardol 's connection with this strange affair . When I heard the story from you last time I could not satisfy myself as to which of the two gentlemen , Mr. Mardol or Mr. Regan , was principal , and which was accessory — to use the terms of the law . I am now confident that Mr. Mardol has directed the game all through , while Mr. Regan may have held the cards . I do not say otherwise as to that , '
197967	197974	197976	197976	Rupert	242	' I was sure of it , '
197982	197993	197976	197976	Rupert	242	' but could I think that Ivor was a villain ? '
197994	198001	198003	198004	the Jew	9372	' I did not say so , '
198006	198046	198003	198004	the Jew	9372	' it is not for me to make a moral appreciation of his acts . But , first of all , did he not say that he was unacquainted with Mrs. Malcolm until he saw her in Denzil Lane ? '
198047	198050	198052	198052	Rupert	242	' Certainly , '
198054	198067	198052	198052	Rupert	242	' he gave me his word of honour that it was so . '
198068	198201	197976	197976	Rupert	242	' Very well ; and perhaps it was clever of him to persist in a system of complete denial , for he may have dreamt to himself that you could not reach the evidence . But one has found in his desk a number of papers , written in cypher indeed , to which we have not the key — that can wait — but in the known characters of Miss Hippolyta Valence . I will show you one morsel . See'—and he laid on the table a long thin strip of foreign note - paper covered with writing , which Rupert instantly recognised as Hippolyta 's . He covered his face with his hands . She was lost to him for ever . Good heavens ! how had he been deceived ? '
198204	198210	198052	198052	Rupert	242	' said the Jew continuing , '
198298	198299	198288	198289	Mr. Mardol	277	' '
198308	198312	198303	198303	he	277	' exclaimed Rupert ; '
198320	198321	198313	198313	you	4220	' '
198331	198335	198313	198313	you	4220	' said Bernstein ; '
198394	198449	198390	198390	you	4220	' Rupert was fairly startled on hearing this slight but extraordinary proof of the completeness with which Mr. Bernstein conducted his investigations . He opened a drawer behind him and took out the letter . The Jew 's eyes glittered for a moment like those of a gamester sweeping the stakes into his pocket . '
198457	198467	198470	198470	you	4220	' said he , looking attentively at the artist ; '
198476	198477	198470	198470	you	4220	' '
198492	198496	198486	198486	you	4220	' cried Rupert . '
198524	198544	198548	198548	them	4229	' holding it out as he spoke . Bernstein quietly waved it back with a motion of his hand . '
198550	198554	198545	198545	I	0	' he said ; '
198593	198594	198561	198561	he	277	' '
198597	198635	198561	198561	he	277	' answered Rupert , more astonished than he chose to say . The Jew waited for him to continue , but as he seemed lost in thought , Mr. Bernstein himself resumed the thread of the conversation . '
198644	198648	198637	198637	I	0	' he said , '
198657	198658	198652	198653	Mr. Mardol	277	' '
198661	198666	198652	198653	Mr. Mardol	277	' exclaimed the artist ; '
198700	198701	198695	198695	He	277	' '
198708	198714	198695	198695	He	277	' said the Jew contemptuously ; '
198762	198763	198755	198755	you	4220	' '
198770	198802	198764	198764	I	0	' said Rupert slowly . Mr. Bernstein got up and came to within a foot of where he was seated . The artist in surprise eyed him , not without curiosity . '
198807	198817	198764	198764	I	0	' began the private detective in his hortatory voice , '
198863	198869	198860	198861	Mr. Glanville	242	' he went on sternly , '
198885	198886	198889	198889	you	0	' '
198892	198901	198889	198889	you	0	' said Rupert , rising in his astonishment . '
198905	198910	198889	198889	you	0	' said the Jew , '
199034	199066	199069	199069	Hippolyta	367	' Rupert felt the justice of his remarks and endeavoured to apologise . But it was a bitter draught , explaining the restlessness of a great sorrow to this vulgar Jew . '
199071	199077	199069	199069	Hippolyta	367	' he thought to himself , '
199099	199122	199069	199069	Hippolyta	367	' Mr. Bernstein was not unacquainted with the outward fashion of intense grief . He listened to the apology and seemed satisfied . '
199131	199135	199128	199128	I	0	' he said ; '
199178	199190	199173	199173	I	0	' he went on as if to anticipate Rupert 's objections , '
199358	199500	199503	199503	you	4248	' The last words told . It was quite true . Granting that Ivor Mardol was the agent who had put all this machinery in motion , there could be no method of gaining control over it so effectual as to be ever by his side on terms of close friendship . Treachery was it ? But who had been traitor first ? And if , as he pretended , Ivor was innocent , there could be no harm in accepting a proposal he had made himself . When the letter came containing his attempted exculpation , Rupert had been minded to fling it in the fire without opening it . He was now glad he had restrained his passion . There were signs of relenting in his attitude as he sat down once more and motioned Bernstein to his seat . '
199506	199514	199515	199515	I	0	' he asked , without looking up . '
199519	199523	199515	199515	I	0	' answered Bernstein , '
199567	199568	199569	199569	I	0	' '
199574	199583	199571	199572	a Nihilist	9385	' cried Rupert , with a mocking laugh . '
199605	199606	199592	199592	you	4248	' '
199613	199623	199608	199608	I	0	' replied the Jew , as calmly as before , '
199806	199890	199789	199789	He	277	' All this appeared plausible enough ; and to a desperate man , whose prospect in life without Hippolyta seemed like a long unbroken winter , the reasons which Bernstein urged with force and conviction might well prove decisive . They did so , in fact , although not until the Jew had presented them in the strongest light , adding that in the alternative of Glanville 's refusing , he would throw up the game and sweep the pieces from the board . '
199900	199904	199789	199789	He	277	' he continued , '
200097	200195	200089	200089	myself	0	' Rupert could not help admiring the combination of frankness and guile in Bernstein 's proposal . To make an anarchist of a free - thinking artist was by no means difficult ; and were example sufficient to justify that course it might be had for the asking . More than one well - known poet and painter had been enrolled in the Nihilist ranks . Nay , was it not the consummate littérateur , Turgenieff , who had invented the name ? But it might be too late . Would not Ivor suspect this instantaneous conversion ? '
200198	200203	200089	200089	myself	0	' answered the Jew , '
200292	200293	200295	200299	the women arrested at Brussels	4273	' '
200301	200305	200295	200299	the women arrested at Brussels	4273	' asked Rupert , '
200329	200330	200333	200333	their	4273	' '
200345	200365	200372	200372	them	4273	' replied Bernstein , taking a packet out of the valise he had brought with him into the room . '
200379	200505	200375	200377	Miss Hippolyta Valence	367	' Neither did the artist , when he had seen the portraits and studied the accounts sent with them . One of the faces was too old , the other too young ; and it was impossible that Hippolyta , however skilful in disguising herself , should have altered the very contour of her features . What was known of the women 's antecedents , though needing confirmation , made the non - identity yet more certain . He gave back the parcel to the Jew , promised he would send for Ivor that afternoon , and arranged the plan upon which , in the alternatives of success or failure , they were to proceed . When Bernstein was gone Rupert hastily scribbled the words , '
200513	201484	200375	200377	Miss Hippolyta Valence	367	' and sent them by a messenger to Grafton Place . In a short time the sound of wheels was heard at the door , and Glanville , watching from the dining - room window , saw Ivor Mardol alight and run up the steps . Determined to act his part thoroughly now he had taken it up , Rupert came out into the hall , shook Ivor by the hand — a pressure which his old friend warmly returned — and led him into the study , where Bernstein 's chair , standing in the middle of the room , testified that a visitor had not long departed . The sudden change in Rupert 's behaviour , which he had been far from expecting — or was it anything else ? — occasioned such uncontrollable emotion in Ivor that for some minutes he was unable to speak . I have said that Rupert had almost in excess the artistic quality which seizes upon the present with a passion and firmness of grasp , which are utterly beyond the reach of those in whom reason and memory are stronger than imagination . It is the endowment which makes a consummate actor . And another gift he had which does not so often accompany it , due rather to the melancholy underlying his everyday character,—I mean that of keeping a secret from friends who , in other respects , were admitted to the fullest confidence . He could be frank enough to win implicit trust for what he said , while he was giving in return only so much as he deemed expedient . These were dangerous power , and he knew it ; but the time seemed to have arrived when he must stake or lose all , and he resolved to play the game boldly . It roused an excitement within him which , like one fever driving out another , made his grief for Hippolyta , though not less real , in some degree less poignant . Towards Ivor Mardol , who had lied to him deliberately , who had for years been carrying on relations with Colonel Valence 's daughter which must have continued during her stay at Forrest House , Rupert 's feeling was that of the Red Indian who treads noiselessly in every footstep his intended victim has made , always seeing his murdered man — to quote Keats 's fine expression — a little ahead of him , and following with uplifted tomahawk until the moment is come to strike him dead . Treachery for treachery ! Be it so . What other way was there of recovering Hippolyta or avenging her loss ? With the caressing eloquence , therefore , which he knew so well how to practise , Rupert , waving aside his old friend 's attempt at exculpation as needless , and excusing the harsh words that had sundered them during these days on the ground of sudden , irresponsible passion , went straight to the point he intended . He might count on Ivor 's devotion , might he not ? On his help in the calamity which had befallen him ? Yes , he knew it . That was the reason he had sent for him . Rupert confessed , in terms of affection and self - rebuke , that he had been punished for keeping a secret from his dearest friend . That secret was the love which had sprung up , how , where , and when it mattered not , between himself and Hippolyta Valence . He watched for a change in Ivor 's countenance , but no , the dissembling was perfect . Well and good . Hippolyta , who had had her own motives for living under the name of Mrs. Malcolm , had disappeared and could no longer be found . She had not returned to Falside ; in London , what hope was there of coming upon her traces ? The speaker 's voice faltered as he went on to declare that he did not believe she was dead , or had met with a violent end . In the first outbreak of distress and fear he had charged Ivor with abducting her . It was , of course , absurd . He would not dwell upon the painful exhibition he had made of himself that morning . But , surely , some one had induced her to quit the house in which she had been residing and , without a moment 's notice , to abandon those to whom she was dearer than life . Who could it be ? After long meditation he had arrived at the belief that it was her father , Colonel Valence . What did Ivor think ? Ivor , who sat listening with his eyes fixed on Rupert , had not asked , and did not ask now , under what circumstances a young lady like Miss Valence was living away from home . It would have been an unpleasant query , though put by a friend . Rupert supposed that he was aware and did not require telling . Nor was he surprised when Ivor , instead of assenting to his theory about Colonel Valence , replied simply that he knew not what to think . He was evidently unwilling that Rupert should tear down the shelter afforded him by Hippolyta 's father,—a thing which might speedily have happened were the Colonel sought after and proved innocent . Rupert returned to the charge ; and Ivor , after making protestation that he did not wish to think evil of a man he had never seen ( Rupert almost ground his teeth on hearing him repeat the falsehood ) , at last yielded and said , '
201492	201493	201488	201488	he	4276	' '
201496	201507	201488	201488	he	4276	' cried Rupert , feigning more passion than he felt , '
201516	201579	201508	201508	I	0	' and he straightway proceeded with the second half of the scheme . When he spoke of joining the anarchists his friend smiled ; but , as he went on to assert with growing vehemence that he should certainly do it , cost what it might , Ivor turned pale . Did he see his plans checkmated ? But he merely said , '
201672	201673	201674	201676	Men like myself	4283	' '
201678	201683	201676	201676	myself	0	' repeated his friend . '
201724	201725	201726	201726	Readier	525	' '
201730	201739	201726	201726	Readier	525	' said Ivor , with a melancholy smile ; '
201761	201779	201821	201821	Ivor	277	' He spoke with much deliberation . Rupert looked at him . Was it a veiled threat ? '
201782	201788	201821	201821	Ivor	277	' he said to himself , '
201813	201818	201821	201821	Ivor	277	' And then aloud , '
201869	201870	201871	201871	Me	0	' '
201877	201888	201871	201871	Me	0	' exclaimed Ivor with agitation in his bearing and accent . '
201942	202007	201926	201926	I	0	' Glanville heard him with increasing hatred and admiration . He was an abominable liar and scoundrel , but how ready , how fertile in device ! It had not cost him a moment to strike out a double line of fortification between himself and the enemy . But it should not avail him . The artist affected not to take his words seriously . '
202014	202018	201926	201926	I	0	' he said , '
202053	202060	202020	202020	you	277	' Ivor seemed to feel embarrassed . '
202063	202072	202020	202020	you	277	' he replied , though with evident reluctance ; '
202096	202106	202094	202094	strangers	1579	' he added , as if to preclude offence , '
202161	202162	202158	202158	I	0	' '
202168	202193	202194	202194	You	277	' returned Glanville , who did not believe a syllable of what Ivor had just trumped up , as he scornfully whispered to himself . '
202229	202235	202255	202256	any man	7704	' Mardol shook his head . '
202242	202246	202255	202256	any man	7704	' he said . '
202312	202313	202304	202304	I	0	' '
202328	202379	202324	202324	he	5878	' was the mental commentary with which Glanville heard these words . He must strike the decisive blow . He stood up , walked across the study , and put his hand on Ivor 's shoulder . Ivor turned his head towards the face which was bent down over him . '
202385	202471	202383	202383	Mardol	277	' said Rupert in clear metallic tones . It was so seldom that he called his friend anything but Ivor that the young man put his hand to his heart with a sudden pang on hearing the colder designation . Rupert , who knew how sensitive his affection was , or had been , noticed the gesture with satisfaction . Was he still capable of being wounded ? So much the better . Glanville , hardly pausing , continued what he had intended to say . '
202477	202592	202593	202593	He	0	' — such were his words—'have come to a pass where friendship must show itself heroic or must cease altogether to exist . There is no method by which I can hope to recover Miss Valence , or even to learn whether she still breathes , but this of entering your association . You , and you alone , can open the door to me . Do so , and you shall have your fitting reward , if you require any beyond that of helping a friend . Refuse , and we part , not now in passion as we did ten days ago , but with our eyes open , and for ever . '
202628	202659	202625	202625	he	277	' Rupert , it is a hard battle . Will you give me your solemn promise not to betray the secrets , whether political or nonpolitical , of the society ? '
202660	202664	202666	202666	Glanville	242	' With pleasure , '
202675	202695	202666	202666	Glanville	242	' I will keep all the ordinances with the same fidelity which you would exact from the meanest member . '
202696	202703	202705	202705	Ivor	277	' There are no mean members , '
202707	202719	202705	202705	Ivor	277	' we are all equal once we have taken the oath . '
202720	202759	202666	202666	Glanville	242	' Very well ; then count me as your equal in this respect . I want to see Colonel Valence , and I am prepared to pay the price . Can I say fairer ? Come , decide . '
202760	202768	202770	202770	Ivor	277	' It shall be as you wish , '
202776	202785	202772	202772	his	277	' What would life be without your friendship ? '
202786	202791	202793	202794	the artist	5691	' What , indeed ? '
202867	202890	202858	202858	he	277	' And to which party among us do you suppose Colonel Valence to belong ? Is he a Spartan or an Athenian ? '
202891	202900	202902	202902	Rupert	242	' I am sure I can not tell , '
202904	202912	202902	202902	Rupert	242	' explain your meaning , my philosopher . '
202913	202917	202919	202920	his friend	6114	' Not now , '
202922	202958	202919	202920	his friend	6114	' this conversation has fatigued me horribly . By and by . I will take you first , however , to see the Athenians . Hold yourself free from engagements till you hear from me . '
202997	203043	202989	202989	he	242	' The curtain has drawn up , I have come before the footlights , and , so long as the play lasts , I must be true to the character I have assumed , not to Rupert Glanville , who lies in a magic sleep . '
203206	203226	203187	203187	he	277	' You are to meet the Athenians this evening ; how long will it take you to get ready ? '
203227	203232	203234	203234	Rupert	242	' Must I dress ? '
203236	203267	203234	203234	Rupert	242	' what do the Athenians wear — a chlamys or a chiton ? I have n't got either in the house ; we shall have to adjourn to my studio . '
203268	203279	203187	203187	he	277	' I am sorry to say there is no need , '
203283	203312	203313	203313	He	277	' they wear the ordinary evening dress of European gentlemen . But the distance is considerable . Do you know the Duke of Adullam 's house at — ? '
203332	203339	203341	203342	the artist	5691	' Are you acquainted with him ? '
203344	203355	203341	203342	the artist	5691	' I thought you never entered the society of Dukes . '
203356	203362	203234	203234	Rupert	242	' I have entered his , '
203367	203445	203234	203234	Rupert	242	' and must do so again . He invites you to dinner ; but I may as well warn you that after dinner , when the uninitiated have taken their leave , we shall hold open lodge for your benefit . I am keeping my ill - given promise to introduce you as a candidate . The rest you will look to yourself . A wrong answer , a slightly too conservative opinion , may ruin you . '
203446	203456	203458	203458	Rupert	242	' Then you must coach me before we start , '
203460	203497	203458	203458	Rupert	242	' I am quick at catching the sense , or nonsense , of a brief . Tell me what is expected , and I will mouth faithfully what madness would gambol from,—how do the verses run ? '
203498	203502	203507	203507	He	6114	' Be serious , '

204194	204823	204171	204171	He	526	' House the august depositary of the rights and liberties of Englishmen . He now turned completely round . In many a winged speech , barbed with truth and polished like the edge of a razor , he showed that if Parliament was the acme of respectabilities , it was , for that very reason , a bundle of vested interests bound round the axe or the tax - gatherer , as the rods were tied about the Roman lictor 's . His picturesque words and bold delivery drew cheers and laughter from the crowd , whom he was careful not to identify with a vulgar House of Commons . His epigrams , witty as they were cynical , made a stir in the languid air of society , and were relished by those who despised not only the degenerate Parliament of England , but all Parliaments and all peoples . His reputation rose higher than ever , and prophets were not wanting who spoke of the coming Tory Prime Minister as one that would bring back the days of Pitt and Chatham . They were in the wrong . After making a brilliant début in the House of Lords,—which , however , though he charmed never so wisely , could not be persuaded to sit over the dinner - hour — and when he might have spent his days in receiving informal deputations from all the interests at which he gibed , the Duke suddenly abandoned politics , and was seen no more on platforms . He had found , or was endeavouring , like Tiberius , to invent , a new excitement . When he was tired of attacking respectability he outraged it . Hitherto a man of average , if not of irreproachable conduct , he shocked every one by publicly professing , in modern London , the principles of the Regent Orléans . That he chose to practise them was , in comparison with this parade of belief in them , venial and trifling . Society has never thought it right to interfere with a man 's private pleasures , least of all with those of a great Duke . But it does insist , on this side of the English Channel , that vice shall pay due homage to virtue , whether in the shape of hypocrisy , or in that of reserve and a decent reticence . The Duke was not married ; and it would have contributed to the happiness of others in his own rank with whom he was on intimate terms , had they not been married either . It had been said , with some truth , that no woman could resist him . They did not always make the attempt . He was perfectly unscrupulous , foolhardy , and unblushing . His reputation among decent people was that of a man who had shamed his pedigree , his order , his relations , his acquaintance . He would have sought admittance in vain at doors which would be gladly thrown open , à deux battants , as the French say , to visitors that brought with them only the shadow of his strawberry leaves . But he did not seek admittance at such . He went into circles which gave him an affectionate welcome , and he sounded the almost unfathomable depths of refined and cultured vice . He was still in the prime of manhood . At twenty - five he had achieved fame in the House of Commons ; he was not seven and twenty when a malignant fate decreed that he should sink into inglorious ease among the peers of the realm . And he was now enjoying an evil reputation of some ten years '
204984	204987	205007	205007	he	242	' Cave . '
205401	205611	205391	205391	Ivor	277	' party . Rupert was introduced by his engraver friend , whom the Duke lightly rallied for having deserted the Cave so many months together . Ivor Mardol replied that business had taken him abroad for one thing , and that principle had kept him at home for another . His Grace of Adullam smiled . He was a singularly prepossessing man , though not exactly handsome . But Rupert liked a human being to show some individual traits of character , even at the cost of a little beauty , and not to be eternally reminding one of that sad , unsatisfying Antinous . The Duke 's figure was well proportioned and he seemed neither tall nor short , though he stood six feet in actual measurement . His motions were graceful as a panther 's , his voice lingered in the memory ; and the large dark eyes , flaming like a basilisk 's , told , no less than the melancholy passionate mouth , of a spirit that suffered the reverse of the pain of Tantalus , — not the longing before satiety , but the despair which comes after it . Ivor , when the Duke moved away , turned to his friend and said , '
205639	206111	205630	205630	I	0	' The artist assented , but thought he should like to hear more of the voice that corresponded to the countenance and figure . He was not to be baulked . When the number of guests was full they went rather silently into the dining - room , which was long and narrow , not unlike the picture - gallery at Trelingham , fitted up with a panelling of dark polished wood against which shone marble statues of exquisite loveliness . The lights were low and soft , except where they threw a blaze from above on the dinner - table ; and somewhere in the distance might be heard the sound of running water , a subdued ripple which seemed unconsciously to tone the conversation that ensued and fill up its pauses . Rupert was charmed and , he could not but allow , surprised . Not that he had imagined he was invited to a noisy rout ; the Duke was well known for his extreme refinement , and had never mixed with the rabble which stands on the outskirts of the highest society as on those of the lowest . But he had looked for something different . Were the guests around him anarchists ? He examined them one by one . There were sixteen at table counting the Duke , who , as Rupert was again astonished to observe , had seated Ivor in the place of distinction at his right hand , where he talked to him earnestly . The young man took his honours with unruffled mien and seemed entirely at his ease . There was now no shade of anxiety on his brow . Again Glanville marvelled that he should be so thorough an adept in dissimulation . Ivor , he said to himself , knew that he had taken Hippolyta from his friend , and that his friend knew it . And he was sitting with that friend at the same table as completely unmoved , as entirely master of himself , as though his loyalty had been unimpeached and unimpeachable . What a vile masquerade was life and friendship ! His thoughts reverted to the others . Were they indeed patrons or partisans of anarchy ? The table at which they were met was a Duke 's ; the wines , the viands , the flowers that bloomed around them , were each in their kind rare and exquisite . Life in these climates had nothing more perfect to show on its material side ; the senses were gratified to their highest , and every crumpled rose - leaf that could trouble their enjoyment was swept away . He noted the conversation . It was clever and ingenious , but at times something too searched - out,—he found himself saying with Holofernes , '
206777	206785	206786	206786	he	242	' I can not thank you enough , '
206796	206806	206786	206786	he	242	' for bringing our John the Baptist back again . '

206819	206845	206816	206817	the artist	5691	' I was not aware that he had been preaching in the wilderness . I thought he was always sure of a good audience among — '

206863	206888	206851	206852	the Duke	4320	' it matters not among whom . But look at the glasses standing by him ; you will see that he deserves his name . '
206913	206917	206919	206920	the Duke	4320	' You see , '
206922	207008	206919	206920	the Duke	4320	' such is the defiance held out by our friend on the first night of our restored amity . He will not touch wine or strong drink . Like another Baptist — though I may have my doubts whether he is heralding a fresh Gospel — he symbolically rebukes the New Paganism , of which wine is the emblem and Dionysus the father . You , I know , will be on our side . Your paintings have nothing of John the Baptist in them . '
207009	207014	207016	207017	the artist	5691	' Truly not much , '
207021	207041	207042	207042	he	5691	' but I have long since given up the thought of persuading my friend to enjoy life . Lately , '
207054	207076	207042	207042	he	5691	' he may have come to view things in a more joyous mood , and to find nectar in the rosebud . '
207077	207080	207082	207083	the Duke	4320	' Indeed ? '
207086	207109	207042	207042	he	5691	' What , the Spartan turned Epicurean ! Pray take off his pallium and show us the man of pleasure beneath it . '

208034	208039	208028	208028	your	4437	' said the Duke . '
208107	208108	208109	208109	He	4464	' '
208117	208121	208109	208109	He	4464	' said Ivor , '
208132	208133	208137	208137	him	4464	' '
208139	208144	208137	208137	him	4464	' answered the Duke , '
208296	208297	208299	208299	you	4472	' '
208308	208337	208299	208299	you	4472	' inquired Rupert , whose mind went back to the days and nights he had been spending among its hospitals , workhouses , back lanes , and mortuaries . '
208354	208355	208340	208340	you	4472	' '
208362	208370	208359	208360	Ivor Mardol	277	' inquired the Duke in his turn , '
208389	208412	208413	208413	I	0	' and he addressed himself to the morsel of woodcock on his plate while waiting for an answer . But Ivor interposed . '
208421	208426	208413	208413	I	0	' he replied calmly , '
208508	208509	208930	208932	your Nihilist conclave	4483	' '
208512	208519	208930	208932	your Nihilist conclave	4483	' said the Duke , laughing , '
208540	208583	208530	208531	the Baptist	4481	' Coffee was served , and they adjourned to the salon in which the Duke had received his guests on arriving . In no long while about half of those present took their leave . Rupert , who could not tell whether his '
208586	208927	208530	208531	the Baptist	4481	' as Ivor called it , had begun or was already over , kept his eye on that suspicious friend , whose reserve had hitherto concealed from him this extraordinary acquaintance with the Duke of Adullam . All reticence between intimates — though some must be unavoidable — has this inconvenience : when one secret has come to light a hundred may be suspected , and , like a casket in which a false bottom has been discovered , the friendship will seem to be lined with reserves innumerable . If Mardol could be on such terms with the Duke , yet his nearest friend not know it , why should he not have been acting throughout on principles which would make his loyalty a pretence and his affection a snare ? But while Glanville was chewing the cud of this bitter fancy , the Duke approached and invited him to the smoking - room . Ivor , who was standing at no great distance and saw the motion , nodded approval and prepared to follow . The way led up a flight of marble steps , along a closed verandah , and into a room illuminated from above with a mellow radiance . It was the electric light glowing through yellow and crimson roses which seemed to hang from the trellis of an arbour , while mats of gorgeous colours strewed the floor , Indian shawls of dead golden hue fell over the entrance and the windows , and a divan of softest texture , covered with pale yellow satin , ran round the walls . As in the dining - chamber , so here was audible the sound of rippling water mingled with the plash of a fountain . The air was not heavy with perfume , but there hung about it the faint , yet pungent , fragrance of Eastern tobacco , in which a whole world of reminiscences — Cairo and the Golden Horn , and far - off Hindustan — seemed to dose and dream . '
208934	208959	208930	208932	your Nihilist conclave	4483	' whispered Rupert to his companion , as they passed the enchanted gateway , and the crimson and golden light came streaming over them . '
208963	208967	208969	208969	you	4482	' returned Ivor ; '
208993	209002	208981	208982	the men	6002	' They flung themselves on the silken divan . '
209005	209012	208981	208982	the men	6002	' said Rupert under his breath , '
209017	209164	209165	209165	You	4486	' He meant the apparition of a brown - skinned Nubian boy , of exquisitely regular features , and in Oriental costume of crimson , with a yellow turban round his head , who advanced towards them silently when they sat down , and offered them in turn a bowl of meerschaum with twisted tube and tobacco of their choice . Ivor looked at the boy and laughed , at the same time putting the narghileh away with his hand . The Nubian , if such he was , laughed back to him , and in doing so displayed a range of pearly teeth between his beautiful lips . He , too , must be familiar with Ivor 's ways , said Rupert to himself . At that moment the Duke , turning round , caught sight of the pantomime , and shook his head mournfully . '
209172	209178	209165	209165	You	4486	' he said to Rupert . '
209196	209200	209190	209194	This frost - bound philosopher	4487	' indicating Ivor , '
209217	209222	209225	209234	the man that has learned to smoke from his youth	4489	' he went on , '
209270	209271	209260	209260	You	242	' '
209278	209282	209274	209274	I	0	' answered Glanville . '
209308	209309	209302	209302	I	0	' '
209312	209317	209302	209302	I	0	' replied the Duke , '
209364	209376	209353	209353	she	4487	' Then changing his tone and becoming all at once serious , '
209398	209399	209387	209387	you	4494	' '
209405	209416	209402	209402	I	0	' said Rupert , taking the narghileh from his lips . '

209425	209430	209402	209402	I	0	' answered the Duke , '
209460	209562	209454	209454	you	4494	' At this juncture Rupert 's friend rose from the divan , and went over to a group of guests who were smoking at a little distance . Glanville and the Duke were in some sense alone , but if either raised his voice the conversation would reach listening ears . At present the Duke 's subdued tones were a hint that he desired the colloquy to be carried on between himself and Rupert only . The latter , with an inquiring look in his eyes , faced the Duke , who sat sideways on the divan and smoked very placidly . '
209565	209570	209454	209454	you	4494	' said his Grace . '
209584	209588	209581	209581	you	4494	' said Glanville , '
209596	209597	209581	209581	you	4494	' '
209610	209615	209581	209581	you	4494	' replied the Duke . '
209630	209639	209618	209618	you	4494	' Rupert gave a short , bitter laugh . '
209644	209648	209649	209649	I	0	' he said . '

209672	209683	209665	209665	you	4494	' replied the Duke simply . And when Glanville stared , '
209686	209694	209695	209696	this gentleman	4496	' he said , raising his voice , '
209702	209715	209716	209721	Four or five of the others	4497	' duke can be a Nihilist . How shall I convince him ? '
209779	209787	209789	209789	one	5661	' Tell him your life and adventures , '
209791	209795	209801	209801	he	4506	' Too long , '
209809	209816	209818	209819	the first	4507	' Tell him mine , then , '
209821	209831	209833	209834	the second	4508	' Yours is too singular to have a moral , '
209836	209851	209833	209834	the second	4508	' It is horrible besides , and one must not begin with a nightmare . '
209852	209859	209861	209869	the man whose story , apparently with his consent	4509	' The rest are little better , '
209884	209887	209889	209890	the Duke	4320	' But , '
209892	209907	209889	209890	the Duke	4320	' we can not stay here all night . What is to be done ? '
210095	210105	210106	210106	he	4320	' You are falling asleep with your eyes open , '
210109	210115	210106	210106	he	4320	' look up and listen . '
210145	210149	210150	210150	he	242	' All right , '
210153	210158	210150	210150	he	242	' I am listening . '
210159	210165	210172	210172	his	4320	' Look round you also , '
210178	210207	210208	210208	He	4320	' You wish to be one of us . Here , then , are seven men who have joined the party of despair . Can you tell why ? '
210221	210237	210212	210212	Rupert	242	' How should I know ? I never saw one of them before except Ivor . '
210238	210242	210244	210245	the Duke	4320	' And he , '
210248	210261	210244	210245	the Duke	4320	' like the rest of this company , has a shattered existence . '
210262	210268	210270	210270	Rupert	242	' It is a lie , '
210275	210287	210270	210270	Rupert	242	' he has shattered mine ; he has broken my heart . '
210301	210306	210308	210309	the Duke	4320	' Right , right , '
210314	210330	210331	210331	he	4320	' at last I hear the cry of a wounded spirit . Why , man , '
210349	210383	210331	210331	he	4320	' do you suppose we are playing for amusement ? If your friend had not assured me that a great grief had smitten you through , these doors had never opened to you . '
210466	210703	210462	210462	he	526	' You have perhaps , my dear friend , confounded us with the ornamental mysteries of the last century . I do not mind being taken for a Rosicrucian , or Mesmerist , or what not , by the crowd standing and staring about the doors . It is as well they should think we are not much in earnest . But with you it is different . If you enter , you belong to us . And you ought to know what binds us together . It is not the flimsy threads of sentiments , or philosophy learned by rote , or political clap - trap . Every man here brings a ruined life in his hand . The rank and file of our societies , which number hundreds of thousands , are made up of those who by hunger , want , misery — and by reflection on all that — have been driven to join us . We , I do not say the élite , but the few , have suffered neither hunger , nor thirst , nor nakedness . But we have suffered worse . We have lost , one in this way , another in that , the good of life . We , too , are stricken so deeply that only in the destruction of society , if at all , can we hope for a glimpse of happiness . '
210733	210743	210744	210744	he	4320	' I see that you can not believe me , '
210747	210788	210744	210744	he	4320	' You want ocular demonstration . You shall have it in good time . Now I will only say this . I am acquainted with the story of every one here , though not every one here knows his own . '
210789	210799	210801	210801	Rupert	242	' Do you know Ivor 's parentage , then ? '
210804	210811	210813	210814	the Duke	4320	' I knew it long ago , '
210816	210856	210813	210814	the Duke	4320	' before I had set eyes on him . But I have not informed him , nor shall , until it is likely to do him good . Ivor has other things now to trouble about besides his parentage . '
210907	210912	210914	210917	this tamer of men	4527	' You perhaps thought , '
210931	211139	210914	210917	this tamer of men	4527	' that by taking a few oaths and professing general principles you might be free of the brotherhood . You must now realise that our bond is not so easily put on , and that it never can be taken off . There is , or has been , in the life of each one here — and of those outside who belong to us — a personal reason why he should despair of the society that has made him what he is . Those only give up the past who have nothing more to hope from it . Tell me , then , what injury has society inflicted on you ? The artist thought of Hippolyta , and was beside himself with rage . What but the stupid , immoral , mercenary , polluting conventions of the world had first made their marriage impossible , and now flung her out into danger and loneliness , far from his love and care ? That pure and lofty spirit had been immolated to the crying social sin which makes of wedlock the worst prostitution . From first to last she had been a victim whose innocence did but make her the easier prey . What had he lost ? '
211154	211167	211148	211152	a wrecked and miserable man	4529	' he replied , with a firmness equal to the Duke 's . '
211263	211272	211248	211248	I	0	' he concluded with a glance towards Ivor , '
211284	211285	211286	211287	Your friend	1390	' '
211289	211294	211286	211287	Your friend	1390	' said Ivor quietly , '
211317	211318	211323	211323	Ivor	277	' '
211325	211337	211323	211323	Ivor	277	' said the Duke , laying a hand on his shoulder . '
211389	211437	211383	211383	I	0	' Ivor hung down his head . He was ashamed of his resentment . After a few moments he came forward to where Rupert was seated and took his hand , which the artist , overcome by conflicting emotions , did not refuse . The Duke smiled , '
211447	211451	211438	211438	You	277	' he said , '
211463	211464	211460	211461	Ivor Mardol	277	' '
211468	211486	211460	211461	Ivor Mardol	277	' he exclaimed after a pause , in the lighter tone which he had affected during dinner ; '
211503	211510	211511	211512	a Nihilist	9385	' he said , smiling maliciously , '
211521	211540	211515	211515	you	277	' Rupert shook his head . He wanted the Duke to go on . Then said his Grace , '
211597	211598	211584	211584	I	0	' '
211605	211609	211600	211600	you	277	' said Rupert . '
211725	211731	211692	211692	Leader	4540	' he concluded , laughing , '
211776	211777	211692	211692	Leader	4540	' '
211782	211789	211692	211692	Leader	4540	' observed Glanville , smiling gravely . '
211802	211803	211792	211792	you	0	' '
211806	211811	211792	211792	you	0	' replied his host ; '
211854	211910	211911	211912	The Duke	4320	' When he had reached this point in his half - serious , half - satirical remarks , the Duke rose and , taking one of the guests with him , went away . Another who had been standing near in silence addressed Rupert , as he seemed hesitating whether to follow them or remain . '
211918	211929	211911	211912	The Duke	4320	' he said . And then , after a while , '
211959	211960	211943	211943	you	4552	' '
211971	211975	211943	211943	you	4552	' inquired Rupert . '
212323	212324	212325	212325	You	4572	' '
212331	212335	212325	212325	You	4572	' said Rupert ; '
212367	212368	212325	212325	You	4572	' '
212373	212378	212325	212325	You	4572	' replied the other ; '
212430	212431	212432	212432	Ridley	550	' '
212440	212447	212436	212436	I	0	' answered the artist ; adding , '
212483	212484	212485	212485	I	0	' '
212490	212506	212485	212485	I	0	' said Ivor , who had been sitting by all this while without a word , '
212540	212541	212523	212523	He	4320	' '
212545	212554	212555	212555	he	4320	' said the stranger , taking him up , '
212578	212579	212555	212555	he	4320	' '
212591	212595	212585	212587	the French noblesse	4582	' said Rupert ; '
212609	212660	212604	212607	the Fourth of August	4583	' While they were talking , the subject of their conversation returned . He took Ivor affectionately by the arm and , whispering some words in his ear , seemed to be sending him away . Ivor left the room ; and the Duke , approaching Rupert , said graciously , '
212671	212854	212662	212662	you	4584	' The artist bowed and followed him as he led the way through the verandah . They traversed several rooms , which were brilliantly lighted , and only looked the more solitary for the air of expectation that seemed to hang over them . Glanville as he passed could not forbear the tribute of an admiring glance at the paintings , statuary , and curious furniture with which they were adorned . The Duke 's study , in comparison , was plain and simple , containing all the requisites , daintily mounted , of that extensive correspondence , much of it in cypher , which his Grace of Adullam carried on . At no time had he been indolent ; perhaps the secret of his unhappiness lay , as he said , in the excess of energy for which he could find neither scope nor occasion . He motioned the artist to a chair , took one himself , and while the fire sparkled in front of them , turned down the lamp till only a ruddy twilight reigned in the room . '
212857	212861	212662	212662	you	4584	' he said , '
212908	213153	212881	212881	you	4587	' While he had been following the Duke , Rupert 's mind had not ceased to busy itself with the question whether he should still try to fence , or surrender , and throw himself on his opponent 's generosity . The figure of the Jew , Bernstein , seemed to rise and mock his hesitation . Confide in the Duke ? But that would be the same thing as confessing to Ivor . How could he possibly tell that they were not in collusion ? Nay , the horrible thought crossed his mind that Hippolyta might be in that very house , hidden where he was least likely to seek her out . His blood turned cold as he dwelt on it . However , he was sick of dissembling . He did not doubt that if he chose he could go on playing his part as hitherto , but the recoil when the play was at an end would be terrible . Why should he not speak and have done with it ? Were these men guilty of the abduction ? Had Hippolyta consented to be taken away ? In that case they would know already as much as he could tell them . He resolved to fling his cards on the table , and let them decide the contest as they fell . The Duke waited , without a sign of impatience . He was mild and calm , and imperturbable . '
213161	213167	213155	213155	I	0	' Rupert at last began , '
213184	213185	213186	213186	I	0	' '
213198	213203	213193	213193	you	0	' replied the Duke . '
213208	213212	213213	213213	I	0	' said Glanville , '
213223	213228	213230	213233	the Duke of Adullam	4329	' A picturesque locale , '
213235	213268	213230	213233	the Duke of Adullam	4329	' as I remember it when I stayed with the Earl some years ago , in my Tory days . Something quaintly conceived , with the water and the hills round it . '
213269	213282	213284	213284	Rupert	242	' And do you know Colonel Valence as well as the Hermitage ? '
213286	213293	213294	213295	the Duke	4320	' He was not at Trelingham , '
213299	213308	213294	213295	the Duke	4320	' however , yes , I know him . '
213309	213312	213316	213316	himself	242	' Good , '
213318	213345	213316	213316	himself	242	' now we are coming on the track . I will give him every bit of the chronicle , from the Madonna of San Lucar onward . '
213568	213576	213561	213564	the Duke of Adullam	4329	' Have you Miss Valence 's portrait ? '
213636	213639	213640	213640	he	5691	' No , '
213644	213664	213640	213640	he	5691	' your Grace will have to draw on your memory if you desire to know what she is like . '
213665	213672	213674	213675	the Duke	4320	' I have hardly any memory , '
213696	213704	213705	213705	he	4320	' I never saw her but once , '
213708	213734	213705	213705	he	4320	' and that was some years ago , when she was a mere child . But she knows I am her father 's sincere friend . '
213760	213843	213757	213757	he	4320	' Your suspicions of Ivor Mardol are absurd and unjust . I am sure that he knows nothing of Miss Valence . To conjecture , as you did in the first instance , that she had gone under his directions on a revolutionary errand was ingenious ; but you should have accepted his denial . You have been very near losing your other self , who will be true when all the women you have ever cared for have turned out false . '
213844	213854	213856	213857	the artist	5691	' But , except Ivor , she saw nobody , '
213859	213886	213757	213757	he	4320	' What reason , unconnected with the movement , as he calls it , can she have had for flying in a moment from Forrest House ? '
213887	213896	213898	213899	the Duke	4320	' It is idle to talk of reasons , '
213901	213944	213898	213899	the Duke	4320	' where a woman is concerned . Find me a passion , and I will unravel the knot , which at present , I confess , is insoluble . Enthusiasm — we want some infusion of enthusiasm to account for the madness . '
213945	213951	213953	213953	Rupert	242	' Ah , good heavens ! '
213955	213989	213990	213990	he	242	' there was no lack of enthusiasm . Hippolyta was capable of going the length of England to discover Annie Dauris , or of joining her father in Siberia . Do you think , '
213998	214010	213990	213990	he	242	' that she has done it ? Where is Colonel Valence ? '
214011	214017	214019	214020	the Duke	4320	' Not in Siberia yet , '
214027	214043	214044	214044	he	4320	' I believe I can find him for you . But oh , young man , '
214052	214297	214044	214044	he	4320	' how happy are you to feel such a human , such a natural grief and excitement ! Do not be in a hurry to extinguish them . You are living through the most delectable chapters of your romance . You have come to the thrilling part where one - third is love , and another third anguish , and the last third uncertain hope and longing mixed in about equal proportions . Believe me , you will never live it through a second time . What would I not give for the despair , the active , poignant despair , no mere dull and chronic feeling , which I underwent in the days of my first abandonment,—not where I forsook , that would have been tame — but where I was forsaken ? The throbbing of exquisite pain , the life in all its fiery ebullition , the changing dread and sudden palpitations of joy as the heavens above me closed or opened ! That was a divine anguish . And will you hasten to bring in the heavy father from a side - scene , where the old man is waiting in hat and cloak , leaning on his absurd staff , merely that you and Miss Hippolyta may go down on your knees before him for his blessing , and live happy — that is to say , bored to death — ever after ? Foolish , foolish young man . ! '
214357	214448	214343	214345	the eccentric peer	4609	' But I perceive what I suspected to be true ; you are not miserable enough to join us at this stage of your experience . The evil done to you may be repaired , Miss Valence may come back , and your discontent with social institutions will give place to an ardent desire for the delights of a fashionable wedding . St. George 's , Hanover Square , will quite satisfy your aspirations towards the Ideal , and serve as your Rome and Mecca . " Journeys end in lovers '
214618	214660	214661	214661	I	0	' Glanville heard , but he was scarcely attending . When the Duke stopped in his talk he seemed to wake from a reverie in which he had been plunged during the last few moments , and he said with decision , '
214702	214703	214700	214700	Hippolyta	367	' '
214707	214712	214715	214715	I	0	' sighed the Duke ; '
214826	214990	214815	214815	I	0	' The conference was at an end . Returning to the salon which he had first entered , Rupert , after bidding farewell to the Duke , who accompanied him so far , was joined by Ivor Mardol . The other guests had vanished . It was brilliant starlight as they drove to the artist 's abode , where Ivor was to take up his quarters that night . The Duke 's conversation , sarcastic and odd though it had been , did not fail to do Rupert one good service . It almost persuaded him that , in suspecting Ivor , he had committed an injustice . His heart was not so heavy . On the other hand , his friend made no inquiries , did not appear to feel resentment , and spoke at intervals in his usual affectionate tone , remarking , with some degree of malice , on the unexpected nature of the initiation which Rupert had gone through . '
215010	215014	215006	215006	I	0	' observed Mardol , '
215030	215031	215020	215022	the dusky page	4631	' '
215045	215049	215032	215032	I	0	' said Rupert . '
215065	215066	215056	215059	your Duke of Adullam	4632	' '
215069	215103	215105	215106	the coachman	8962	' exclaimed Ivor . They were driving along the Knightsbridge Road , and sound of belated newsboys crying out an extraordinary edition of the evening journals came through the open carriage - window . '
215114	215123	215105	215106	the coachman	8962	' The coachman stopped . They heard the word '
215125	215155	215105	215106	the coachman	8962	' repeated many times . Ivor got out , caught hold of a newsboy , and held up the paper under the street lamp . He came running back . '
215160	215182	215183	215183	They	4634	' inquired Rupert languidly . His friend sprang in , pulled up the window , and said in a low voice , '
215190	215191	215183	215183	They	4634	' '
215195	215229	215230	215230	He	4635	' said the artist . At that moment he caught the announcement distinctly which was filling the air , and he heard the words , again and again,'Assassination of the Emperor of Russia . '
215253	215258	215259	215259	he	4635	' Ivor , Ivor , '
215262	215280	215259	215259	he	4635	' did you know this was going to happen ? Tell me , for God 's sake . '
215281	215290	215292	215292	Ivor	277	' Do n't ask me what I knew , '
215294	215301	215292	215292	Ivor	277	' it is unspeakable , appalling . '
215347	215449	215337	215337	He	277	' Rupert , I am not in any way acquainted with your Colonel Valence . But I heard to - night that he was in Russia . If he is mixed up in this , there will shortly be news of him . He may escape , and he will come , as they all do , to London . If , on the contrary , he is captured , we shall have the photographs of the prisoners sent over to us , and you will be allowed to see them and discover his features , should he be among them . '
215450	215455	215457	215457	Rupert	242	' Do you think , '
215467	215485	215457	215457	Rupert	242	' that he would have exposed Hippolyta , his own child , to a danger like this ? '
215486	215498	215500	215500	Ivor	277	' A Nihilist has no children where the society is concerned , '
215502	215570	215571	215571	he	277	' I fear from your description of Miss Valence that her daring and enthusiasm would have pointed her out as the very one to be selected for the post of danger . Anyhow , if her father is not dead or in the hands of the Russian police , you will soon be in the way of meeting him . I must say good - night here , '
215590	215593	215595	215595	Rupert	242	' Why , '
215597	215604	215595	215595	Rupert	242	' you promised to sleep here . '
215605	215638	215639	215639	he	277	' Yes , but'—he paused and looked round—'I may be wanted at home . There will be letters , — visitors,—early in the morning . Oh , you need not take alarm , '
215649	215702	215704	215704	he	277	' This was none of my doing . I am only an ambulance officer , one of the Geneva Red Cross , on the battlefield . But I ought to be at my post . Good - night , Rupert . Do not distrust me again . I could not bear it . '
216191	216201	216202	216202	he	521	' What is the use of my telling you ? '
216205	216221	216202	216202	he	521	' you will not find out anything . You have failed utterly up to this . '
216222	216225	216227	216227	Bernstein	521	' Yes , '
216230	216328	216330	216330	he	521	' I have failed . Did I not warn you that so it might be , when I heard of the twofold motive ? I said , " To find Mrs. Malcolm I can not promise . " But , we say in German , no thread so fine is spun that it comes not to the sun . And thus it will prove . I have caused to be inserted your advertisements in the Times . There is no answer yet . Perhaps the true answer was the news from Russia . We must wait But , '
216332	216400	216330	216330	he	521	' two things I have found . One is that there is search going on for Miss Valence by the side of ours . My people have met other people below , in the under - world of which I did speak to you when first I came . And the second , I can tell you what has happened to the young woman , Annie Dauris . '
216401	216404	216406	216406	Rupert	242	' What ? '
216421	216426	216428	216429	the Jew	9372	' She is dead , '
216432	216435	216437	216438	the artist	5691	' Dead ? '
216444	216456	216437	216438	the artist	5691	' it was soon over then . How do you know ? '
216457	216468	216504	216505	the Jew	9372	' Because I saw her lying dead in — Hospital , '
216477	216480	216481	216481	he	242	' Ah , '
216484	216498	216499	216499	he	242	' it was the first hospital I went into that night . Stay , '
216507	216544	216499	216499	he	242	' was Annie Dauris fair , light - haired , rather pretty , but with a careworn expression ? Can it have been the patient I saw that could not speak and looked at me attentively ? '
216545	216548	216550	216550	Bernstein	521	' Yes , '
216552	216641	216550	216550	Bernstein	521	' yes , it is the same . She was brought from the lodging - house poisoned , and was , in a manner , restored to life . But she was never able to speak . While she had the fever her child was born . The mother and the child are dead . The inquest was yesterday . Her father and her companion , Charlotte Fraser , identified the body . It was Annie Dauris , and I think she knew too much and was murdered . '
216642	216646	216648	216648	Rupert	242	' By whom ? '
216656	216663	216664	216664	he	9372	' You would not believe me , '
216667	216752	216664	216664	he	9372	' therefore I hold my tongue . You are not a strong character , Mr. Glanville . Your friend Mr. Mardol is the strong character . He can and will turn you round his finger , and lead you about by the nose . Pardon me , but is it not so ? You go to him twice daily ; you sit long with him . You do not send me a memorandum . It is clear that you believe him your friend again . '
216753	216759	216761	216761	Rupert	242	' What if I do ? '
216763	216785	216786	216786	he	242	' you can go on searching , all the same . Who else , I wonder , is looking for Hippolyta ? '

216823	216829	216830	216830	he	521	' I know that name , '
216833	216872	216830	216830	he	521	' it is a mock - name of a great noble who does much in my world . You and Mr. Mardol went to his house and stayed there many hours such a night . Why went you ? '
216873	216879	216881	216881	Rupert	242	' That is my business , '
216883	216921	216881	216881	Rupert	242	' and now , Mr. Bernstein , understand that I give you full permission to go on with your search , but I have no longer the assurance that my friend Mardol has done me an injury . '
216922	216935	216937	216937	Bernstein	516	' Your friend Mardol , I say , is the clever man , '
216939	216972	216973	216973	he	516	' I will search , for it is a strange case . But if I make clear to myself that Mrs. Malcolm was in Petersburg , and is taken , or — , '
216983	216998	216973	216973	he	516	' shall I bring you the news , whatever it may happen to be ? '
216999	217002	217004	217004	Rupert	242	' Yes , '
217012	217019	217004	217004	Rupert	242	' let me know the worst . '
217181	217188	217189	217189	he	516	' Not yet , not yet , '
217274	217286	217261	217263	an old friend	4675	' , in Denzil Lane . He proposed to take Rupert . '
217294	217298	217261	217263	an old friend	4675	' Ivor continued , '
217394	217466	217383	217386	the Duke of Adullam	4329	' The low fever that had taken possession of Rupert grew upon him every hour . He did not talk ; and when dinner came , eating was impossible . His friend began to think he had better go to Denzil Lane by himself and bring back what news there might be . But he no sooner proposed it than the artist , rising up , said in a melancholy tone , '
217508	217803	217501	217501	I	0	' They left the house late , in silence , walking along the crowded streets without exchanging an observation . Ivor had his own sad thoughts , apart from the anguish of his friend . He did not know whose fate trembled in the balance that evening , his or Rupert 's . The strange acquaintance between himself and the Duke of Adullam had made it comparatively easy to face the so - called Athenians , with whom he had never entirely broken . The Spartans , as their name denoted , were much less tolerant of private opinion , and ready to inflict the severest penalties on dissentients or renegades . Ivor was walking up to the cannon 's mouth . He knew his men , and did not promise himself a speedy reconciliation with them or an untroubled lease of life . And the reception he met on entering would have discouraged a bolder man . It was the large , bare committee - room , which we remember , in the decayed house at Denzil Lane , where Hippolyta and Ivor held their first conversation . The passage was not lighted , and Ivor , leading Rupert in the dark , had to knock twice ere he gained admission . A species of warder , wearing a red sash across his breast , stood inside , jealously guarding the entrance . On opening he recognised the engraver , drew back , and seemed uncertain whether he should be allowed to pass . But at the sight of Rupert closely following on the heels of his friend the warder put out his hand , laying it rather heavily on the artist 's shoulder , and said in a quick , rough undertone , '
217810	218502	217806	217806	you	4683	' Rupert stood perfectly still . Ivor , just looking at the doorkeeper , said two or three words and held out a scrap of paper . The effect was instantaneous . The grim warder drew aside ; Rupert passed in ; and the two friends , making their way up the room , seated themselves , by Ivor 's choice , where they could see all that was going forward and keep an eye on the door . Rupert , somewhat roused from his lethargy , looked round and thought he had never been in such a place before . The scene resembled a night - school rather than a Socialist meeting . The great windows at either end were closed with wooden shutters and iron bars ; three jets of gas hanging from the plastered ceiling threw a crude light on the benches occupied by some thirty or forty men , who seemed , by their dress and general appearance , to belong to the steadier sort of mechanics . There was a tribune , or master 's pulpit , at the upper end away from the door , which was at present empty . Near it was the table , covered with green baize , at which Hippolyta had seated herself while Ivor uttered his thoughts to her the first morning they met . But Rupert did not know that Hippolyta had ever been in the room . He felt almost as much surprise here as at the Duke of Adullam 's . He had expected a larger meeting , and not this kind of people . In his mind there went with Socialism something squalid , frowsy , unkempt , and forlorn . But these men seemed to be in receipt of wages enabling them to dress decently ; they had an educated look ; and many of them were turning over the journals or reading written documents . Among them were evidently a certain number of foreigners . They all looked up on the entrance of Ivor Mardol . Seeing Rupert , they looked inquiringly at one another ; and a second officer , in red sash like the doorkeeper , came up and asked him who he was . Rupert pointed to Ivor ; again the scrap of paper was shown , again the magic working followed . The men bent over their journals and documents . There was apparently no business going on , or it had not begun . In the midst of the silence a slight young man went from his place at the side of the hall into the pulpit , carrying with him a bundle of papers . The rest laid down what they were reading , and threw themselves into listening attitudes . The secretary , if such he was , began to run over what seemed an interminable list of meetings , resolutions , and subscriptions — a recital which , tedious though it proved to Rupert , had clearly a deep interest for the assembly , Ivor himself appearing to follow it point by point . More than once the reader was interrupted , now by low earnest murmurs of approbation , and now by marks of the reverse . A bystander would have said that in this committee of anarchists the old sections of the Revolution had renewed themselves . But the artist , weary of these monotonous proceedings , and attending but little to the hum of conversation , which by degrees grew louder , could hardly have told when the secretary ended , or what shape of man took his place in the pulpit . He did not suppose Colonel Valence would haunt assemblies of this species ; and Ivor 's friend apparently was yet to arrive . From such stupor , consequent partly on the illness he was feeling , Rupert awakened at the sound of Ivor 's voice . He opened his eyes and looked about . His friend had arisen in his place , and the speaker in the pulpit had come to a pause . The rest were dead silent . '
218505	218519	217806	217806	you	4683	' said Ivor , with a fine ring of scorn in his accents , '
218570	218581	218568	218568	You	4684	' he continued , facing the man in the pulpit , '
218623	218624	218600	218600	I	0	' '
218632	218642	218643	218643	your	4684	' shouted one of the men across the room ; '
218660	218661	218656	218657	the man	5814	' '
218666	218670	218656	218657	the man	5814	' said Ivor . '
218692	218871	218687	218690	a company of assassins	4688	' And he sat down , flushed and excited . Rupert pressed his hand . The other took up his interrupted speech ; and the artist for the first time heard a sermon , in well - chosen language and with apposite illustrations , on the text of dynamite . A stern gospel , which the fanatic standing before them clearly believed in . He was a thoughtful , mild - looking man , young , well educated , and fluent in address , a foreigner , or of foreign descent . He was much applauded , though not by all ; and he knew when to leave off . The impression made was deep and solemn , like that which a High Calvinist might have produced in his epoch by proclaiming that hardly any one present would be saved , and by adding that the more of them were lost the greater would be God 's glory . As soon as he turned to come down from the pulpit , Ivor stood up again . Voices cried , '
218880	218907	218687	218690	a company of assassins	4688	' but he did not stir . The noise died away . Looking very steadily at the brethren who crowded nearer to him , he said , '
218925	218941	218922	218922	your	4689	' There was a strong murmur of disapproval , which seemed to loosen his tongue . '
218949	218953	218947	218947	you	4689	' he cried , '
219042	219049	219021	219021	You	4689	' There was a great outcry . '
219054	219058	219059	219059	renegade	4700	' exclaimed some ; '
219061	219062	219021	219021	You	4689	' '
219065	219066	219059	219059	renegade	4700	' '
219069	219156	219158	219158	you	4701	' came hurled from the lips of others , while Ivor stood unmoved amid the commotion he had excited . He smiled disdainfully , and lifted his hand to command silence , but for a time it seemed as if the meeting would break up in confusion . There were two or three , however , bent on restoring order and hearing what he had to say . The tumult grew less , and Ivor , as soon as he could make himself audible , exclaimed , '
219333	219334	219325	219326	Victor Hugo	557	' '
219337	219350	219325	219326	Victor Hugo	557	' said a thickset , deep - toned German , interrupting him . '
219357	219358	219360	219360	they	4711	' '
219374	219378	219380	219380	they	4711	' returned Ivor ; '
219411	219412	219380	219380	they	4711	' '
219416	219420	219380	219380	they	4711	' retorted another , '
219427	219428	219380	219380	they	4711	' '
219437	219441	219442	219442	You	4708	' said Ivor . '
219479	219480	219481	219481	We	4704	' '
219494	219499	219500	219500	we	4704	' interrupted a third ; '
219520	219521	219522	219522	I	0	' '
219525	219533	219522	219522	I	0	' said Ivor , his face kindling ; '
219660	219671	219654	219654	you	8153	' he went on , as the interruptions began again . '
219712	219713	219715	219715	we	4729	' '
219717	219722	219715	219715	we	4729	' was the cry . '
219730	219731	219715	219715	we	4729	' '
219738	219742	219735	219736	Victor Hugo	557	' he replied , '
219786	219794	219783	219784	my brothers	4730	' said Ivor , his voice softening , '
219846	219847	219895	219897	the governing classes	4731	' '
219850	219859	219895	219897	the governing classes	4731	' exclaimed one who had not yet spoken ; '
219878	219879	219880	219880	Your	8153	' '
219887	219891	219880	219880	Your	8153	' said Ivor , '
219964	219965	219966	219966	Robespierre	513	' '
219979	219999	219977	219977	Marat	561	' answered the other sullenly . Ivor was not to be daunted . He went on with his theme . '
220007	220011	220005	220005	Torquemada	562	' he inquired . '
220055	220059	220061	220061	you	8153	' he exclaimed , '
220151	220157	220171	220171	you	8153	' 89 by the guillotine of '
220194	220207	220191	220191	I	0	' he said , raising his voice and speaking with impassioned earnestness , '
220253	220254	220257	220257	you	0	' '
220263	220424	220257	220257	you	0	' The question rang out clear through the room , drawing every eye towards the speaker , who had come in while Ivor was replying to the interruptions of his opponents . He was a tall man , wrapped in a cloak with which until now he had covered his face where he sat by the door . At the sound of his voice Ivor gave a start . Rupert , looking that way , saw the man rise from his seat and press towards the tribune . He let his cloak fall , and from that moment the artist 's eyes were rivetted on his pale and haughty countenance . Again , as at the beginning of Ivor 's speech , there was complete silence , and the men present looked at one another in expectation of something unusual . Ivor , standing up while the stranger passed , made no attempt to resume . The stillness became intense . '
220434	220451	220425	220425	You	4745	' said the stranger , as he looked at them from the tribune he had mounted , '
220511	220576	220577	220577	he	0	' 93 . Anarchy first , then order . When France challenged the kings to battle , it flung them the head of a king . We have done more ; we are going to pull down the Europe of the kings , with all its wealth , feudalism , ranks , and classes , till we have swept the place clean . And , '
220580	220593	220577	220577	he	0	' our gage of battle is the shattered body of the Tsar . '
220642	220654	220655	220655	he	0	' When I was a boy I too had my dreams , '
220664	220713	220714	220714	his	0	' I believed in Goethe and Voltaire , in Victor Hugo and the sentimentalists . I thought the struggle was for light . I see it is for bread . Look out in the streets to - night and consider the faces that pass . Beyond these walls , '
220726	220830	220714	220714	his	0	' lies the anarchy of London . Rags , hunger , nakedness , tears , filth , incest , squalor , decay , disease , the human lazar - house , the black death eating its victims piecemeal,—that is three - fourths of the London lying at these doors . Whose care is it ? Nay , who cares for it ? The piles of the royal palace are laid deep in a lake of blood . And you will leave it standing ? You talk of light ; you prefer sentiment to dynamite and assassination ! What a meek Christian you are ! '
220831	220834	220836	220836	Ivor	277	' No , '
220845	220882	220883	220883	he	277	' I am neither meek nor a Christian . The lake of blood is a terror to me as to you . That is not the question . You know me too well to imagine it , '
220888	220941	220883	220883	he	277	' The question is whether a second anarchy will cure a first . I say no . I prefer sentiment to assassination ? Very well , why should I not ? But I prefer reason and right even to sentiment . I appeal to what is deepest in the heart of man . '
220955	220961	220962	220962	he	277	' I have seen battles , '
220965	221059	220962	220962	he	277	' in which there were heroism , and madness , and the rush of armies together , and the thunder of cannon , and wild , raging cries in the artillery gloom , enough to intoxicate a man with the bloody splendours of war . But I never beheld anything more heroic or glorious'—he smiled , his voice fell , and he gave a long , peculiar glance down the hall—'than the overture to our great enterprise . It cost many days to think it out ; it was accomplished in a moment . '
221077	221116	220962	220962	he	277	' I saw him stagger , lean his arm against the parapet , and fall , shattered as with a thunderbolt . It was not the death of a man ; it was the annihilation of a tyranny . '
221117	221130	221132	221132	Ivor	277	' And the springing up of a fresh tyranny from his blood , '
221147	221156	221158	221159	the speaker	1449	' Ah , it was a fine sight , '
221169	221219	221158	221159	the speaker	1449	' and new in its kind . The great White Tsar has often been murdered — by his wife , his son , his brother ; Nicholas committed suicide , and so did Alexander the First . But never until now have the people done justice on their executioner . '
221440	221452	221453	221453	he	1449	' That was not all the blood spilt in the tragedy , '
221456	221491	221453	221453	he	1449	' We , too , lost our soldiers , but they were willing to die . And now that you have seen the deed through my eyes , judge whether it was rightly done . '
221492	221495	221497	221497	Ivor	277	' Stay , '
221513	221545	221504	221504	his	277	' before you judge let me ask on what principles your verdict is to be founded . Will you take those of the Revolution , or return to those of Absolutism ? '
221546	221553	221453	221453	he	1449	' The Revolution , the Revolution , '
221558	221563	221565	221567	the young man	5843	' One of them , '
221569	221754	221755	221755	He	4763	' is fraternity . Where did his murderers show pity to the Tsar ? Another is humanity , to employ the arms of reason , to enlighten blindness , not strike it with the sword . Must war be perpetual , or where is retaliation to cease ? I have always thought that pardon , light , and love were the watchwords of our cause ; and I looked forward to the day when men should live in peace with one another . To be a man , I understood , was to bear a charmed life , on which no other man should lay a daring hand . Murder , I was told , is sacrilege . Am I now to unlearn all these truths , and join the crusade of dynamite - throwers instead of the crusade of reason ? That is the counter - revolution indeed . I , for one , will have nothing to do with it . Take my vote , which condemns anarchy , whether in the heights or in the depths , and let me go . '

223658	223755	223655	223656	the Colonel	1272	' announcing that I should probably return to Falside in the course of three weeks . I allowed a margin for accidents , and the time is out . I told her where I was . It is conceivable that she went abroad in the hope of meeting me , or of helping me in Petersburg . Hippolyta was always a creature of impulse . She must be at Falside . Lost ! No , my dear Glanville , do not think it . We will all three go down to the West to - morrow . '
223756	223760	223762	223762	Ivor	277	' Not I , '
223767	223771	223773	223774	his guardian	6831	' Why not ? '
223780	223812	223813	223813	he	277	' Because I have done with you , Mr. Felton . I said so to myself a hundred times while you were speaking , and I mean it . You are — '
223816	223821	223823	223824	the other	618	' What am I ? '
223835	223849	223851	223852	Ivor Mardol	277	' You are worse than a murderer , that is what you are , '
223857	223871	223851	223852	Ivor Mardol	277	' Others commit bloody deeds , but you make a religion of them . '
223876	223891	223892	223892	he	274	' Boy , boy , you must not talk to me in that fashion , '
223895	223922	223892	223892	he	274	' What I have advocated is justice , not murder . Have done with your tenderness for crowned criminals , and come with me to Falside . '
223923	223931	223933	223933	Ivor	277	' I shall do no such thing , '
223935	223951	223933	223933	Ivor	277	' Goodnight , Rupert . When you have found Mrs. Malcolm , let me know . '
223962	223966	223967	223967	he	242	' Dear Ivor , '

224068	224092	224065	224065	Ivor	277	' I will never come under the same roof again with Mr. Felton'—the old man winced slightly , but was silent as before ; '
224095	224099	224065	224065	Ivor	277	' continued Ivor , '
224137	224146	224134	224134	I	0	' he concluded , shaking his head mournfully , '
224153	224154	224148	224148	you	242	' '
224160	224164	224157	224157	you	242	' asked Glanville . '
224174	224179	224180	224180	She	367	' replied his friend . '
224223	224224	224213	224213	she	367	' '
224231	224240	224225	224225	She	367	' repeated Colonel Valence in a low voice . '
224245	224250	224243	224243	Ivor	277	' said Rupert entreatingly . '
224258	224263	224255	224255	you	242	' answered his friend . '
224287	224303	224304	224304	Ivor	277	' Colonel Valence , in a gentler way than he had hitherto shown , said , '
224356	224431	224438	224438	you	277	' Such language from the stern Mr. Felton surprised Ivor . It was unlike him , not in his character . But this night had made him odious . The scent of murder hung about him yet . It was impossible that any change in his bearing could take away the guilt of what he had said and done . As a final answer , Mardol turned to the artist and said with decision , '
224463	224563	224456	224456	you	277	' And so saying he went out of the room , without looking round . He supposed Rupert would stay , to make arrangements for the journey of to - morrow . When he gained the street he paused , considered for a moment , and walked hastily towards Grafton Place . His thoughts were in a tumult ; he scarcely knew which way he was going . In the midst of his painful and distracted musings he heard steps behind him , as of some one coming rapidly on . A moment after Rupert was by his side . '
224570	224578	224566	224566	you	277	' he said , out of breath . '
224609	224610	224606	224606	you	277	' '
224618	224622	224611	224611	I	0	' replied Ivor . '
224642	224643	224636	224637	Miss Valence	367	' '
224657	224665	224666	224666	I	0	' inquired the artist , half angrily . '
224776	225021	224768	224768	You	242	' Rupert accompanied Ivor in silence to his own door , and went home . The journey from London , which Rupert and Colonel Valence undertook next day , was melancholy . In spite of his indomitable vigour and iron frame , the Colonel looked tired , said but little , and appeared to be sunk in his own reflections , which could hardly be of a cheerful cast . There were moments when he seemed dispirited . A curious experience , which he knew not whether to call pain or pleasure , was that of Rupert , as he sat opposite the gray - haired man and traced in the lines of his weather - beaten countenance the far - off likeness of Hippolyta . At a word , sometimes , the mask would seem to change , the whole expression would be soft and gentle , like that of his daughter when a pleasant thought came into her mind ; but again , it vanished and the stern lines were fixed as ever . The Colonel asked no questions ; he had gathered the story last night from Rupert 's confused narrative , all except the motive which could have brought to so sudden a conclusion the idyll they seemed to have begun . On the other hand , he spoke without prompting of Ivor Mardol , whose resolution to break their long friendship seemed to afflict rather than to anger him . '
225024	225028	224768	224768	You	242	' he said , '
225105	225361	225100	225100	he	277	' The artist replied at random . He felt the old affection for his schoolboy friend reviving ; but of the argument last night he remembered nothing distinctly . He was suffering almost as on the morning when Hippolyta left him , when he sat , a ruined man , in her boudoir . The mind was torturing the body . One fear hung upon him and from time to time shook him with a passionate thrill ; what if she were not at Falside , or had never been there ? The journey was a forlorn hope . All he could say was that she must , in any case , have written to her father . The old man was not dissembling , he thought ; had Hippolyta gone from Forrest House with his approval , he would not be taking all these pains to convince Rupert that she was lost to him . He would be following her to the Continent . She had , then , fled of her own accord . But why ? It was an impenetrable mystery . They passed through the scenery which his frequent expeditions to and from Trelingham had made familiar ; at a certain junction they changed for Toxenden , which was the station nearest Falside . They saw nobody of their acquaintance . When they alighted at the small country station , looking pretty even in the lap of winter , Colonel Valence ordered a vehicle , remarking , as they entered it , '
225444	225445	225437	225437	Valence	274	' '
225455	225459	225446	225449	The Duke of Adullam	4329	' said Rupert . '
225468	225473	225463	225463	he	4329	' returned the other ; '
225480	225481	225475	225476	the Duke	4320	' '
225489	225494	225495	225495	I	0	' observed the artist . '
225498	225775	225495	225495	I	0	' was the careless reply , as Colonel Valence settled down in the carriage . The evening was dark and cold . The way seemed long , although Glanville knew it from his frequent riding over the country in those happy days when he was learning more and more the worth of Hippolyta , to be , in fact , but a couple of miles . It went uphill towards the moor , then turned again rather abruptly , and kept on the bare hillside . And now the sky seemed a huge cloud resting on another , which was the dark sullen waste , heavy and dismal in the gloom . They turned in at the steep gate of Falside . The evergreens would have hidden the lights had any been shining in the library windows . But there were none . That side of the house was quite dark . When they reached the second gate they dismounted , and Rupert stood there all impatient while the Colonel paid and dismissed the driver . No one came at their approach , although the sounds of their wheels must surely , said Rupert to himself , have been audible on the gravel - path . He followed Colonel Valence round the cottage , where all seemed deadly still , to the housekeeper 's room at the back . There was a light in the window . The Colonel tapped in a peculiar way ; and Dolores , the aged nurse of Hippolyta , came at once to the door . On seeing her master she began to explain that Andres had gone to the village . '
225781	225848	225849	225849	She	5906	' inquired the Colonel . She looked at Glanville , whom she had not before noticed , and seeing the expression on his face , screamed out some words in her own language . Colonel Valence , answering apparently in the same — for Rupert , though he could read Spanish , had no practice in hearing it — turned to the artist , and said , '
225864	226040	226041	226042	Mr. Glanville	242	' And he took the light which Dolores offered . The two men ran down the steps , through the covered way , and into the house , each disquieted , but neither stopping to utter his thought . The library was in perfect order , but had that woebegone appearance which comes over a room where no one has dwelt for some time . Colonel Valence , setting down the light , began , with uneasy looks , to turn over the pile of miscellaneous correspondence that lay undisturbed on the table . There were many letters , which he tore open and flung from him , when he saw they had not the enclosure he was expecting . He came to the end of them , turned back , shook them out carefully again , and sat down , fixing his eyes on the floor and not uttering a word . Glanville was equally silent . At last Colonel Valence looked up , haggard , with the deep veins on his forehead swollen . '
226044	226052	226041	226042	Mr. Glanville	242	' he said , with curious formality , '
226065	226541	226542	226542	My	0	' Under that dreadful shock the artist reeled and had almost fallen , but recovering himself he went to the table ; and , for the third time , the correspondence was turned and examined , in the vain hope of finding a trace of Hippolyta . She had not written ; there was nothing there . The two men , when Rupert laid down the last of the papers , sank into a stillness that resembled apathy . Neither stirred nor spoke . The Colonel sat with his eyes on the ground ; Rupert , grasping the table with one hand , stood like a man in a dream . The candle burnt to the socket , flickered , and went out . There was darkness in the room , and far down the valley a star or two seemed to twinkle . The sound of Andres returning on horseback struck upon their ears and woke Colonel Valence from his overwhelming grief . He rose and went to the door , calling out to Andres in Spanish . The old servant stopped . There was brief colloquy between them ; the Colonel did not return ; and by and by lights were brought into the room , and Dolores set down a tray with supper on it by the side of Glanville . Her husband , who brought the lights , said that Colonel Valence would not appear again that night , but the stranger 's room would be made ready as soon as possible . Both the old servants were in great consternation and shedding tears ; but Glanville hardly noticed them , and the supper remained untasted where it had been laid . He heard the sound of Colonel Valence 's footstep as he paced up and down outside on the terrace . It was a slight thing , but intolerable . Seizing his hat he ran up the steps once more , and let himself out by the little postern - gate leading to the bridge . How well he remembered that afternoon when Hippolyta brought him through it for the first time , and he followed like her dog , or some poor thing she cherished ! Gone , gone ! She was dead , or worse than dead , to him . He wandered on the edge of the moor , stumbling over the great stones , but , by some instinct , never going beyond the sound of the waterfall , which made a strange monotonous music in the night , like a sobbing ghost , he said to himself . When some hours were past Andres found him , and persuaded him to go in , speaking to the proud English gentleman with soothing words as to a child . He showed him the stranger 's room . '
226554	226564	226542	226542	My	0	' murmured Glanville , as he looked round him . '
226587	226749	226583	226583	I	0	' He crept into bed and fell asleep . Next morning , when he woke , the fever was upon him , but he would take no heed of it . He came downstairs . Colonel Valence was gone,—to London , said the note which he had written and left for Glanville . He might be compelled to seek his daughter on the Continent . He would let the artist know if he heard anything . A fire was blazing on the hearth , looking clear as in frosty weather . Dolores , when she had laid the table for breakfast , lingered until Rupert sat down , and then , with the tenderness of the kind old creature she was , induced him to eat . He made a hasty meal , and at its conclusion was setting out from the cottage , when she asked him at what hour he would come back . He echoed the words wonderingly . '
226753	226757	226583	226583	I	0	' he said , '
226760	226784	226583	226583	I	0	' She insisted , and begged him to say in what direction he was going . In the same absent way he replied , '
226788	227012	226583	226583	I	0	' Upon hearing that she called Andres , and between them they made Glanville stay until the pony - chaise could be got ready . He waited by the garden wall ; he would not enter the house , nor even look towards it , a second time . He seemed to have no interest in himself , no purpose save that of reaching Trelingham at the earliest . When Andres appeared with the carriage he mounted silently , drew his ulster about him , and sat upright , gazing straight on before him , but speaking not a syllable , and seeming not to remark the way they went . His thoughts , meanwhile , were busy enough with it , going over the dreams , the vanished illusions of that night on which he had been driven along these very paths , in the dark , but with Hippolyta 's remembrance to light up all within . Now the darkness had entered his soul . He did not dare to whisper the name which , barely thought of , pierced him like a sword . He wanted to get away from it , to see no more of Falside , to be only the artist whose work was to be done at Trelingham . Plans for the future he had none . '
227018	227022	227013	227013	I	0	' he said , '
227032	227291	227292	227292	She	4873	' He tried to think of the frescoes , but the exertion sickened him . It seemed to him that he was neither living nor dead . He was stunned and yet suffering . The well - known trees rose up to greet him as they came in view of Trelingham Chase . The winter- landscape , though bare in places , and taking in the wild moor with its belt of dark - blue sea , was soothing and gentle . The great house stretched its wings over the silent terrace , where no figure was to be seen . They passed the lodge , drove slowly up the winding walk by which Hippolyta had always come when she visited Lady May Davenant , and arrived at the chief entrance . The butler , who was at hand , observed Glanville 's extraordinary pallor , but , with his usual discretion , said nothing except that Mr. Mardol had come the evening before , and was at the chalet . Rupert sent him a message , shook Andres by the hand , and let him go . It was a relief to see the pony - chaise depart ; it had belonged to her . While he was taking off his wraps , Ivor , who had been walking near the house , came in and ran up , catching him by both hands , and , by a look , inquiring what news there might be . The artist bit his lip nervously and turned away . '
227297	227805	227292	227292	She	4873	' he whispered . That was all . They understood one another , and said no more . It was a bad sign that Rupert would neither eat nor lie down . Capable , like all great artists , of working for many hours on end , he was also , like them , subject to fits of weariness during which he slept the day through . But now he was fatigued , and he wrought on . He made the Great Hall his abode , leaving it only to retire late in the evening to his own room , where he would throw himself on the bed , sometimes without undressing , and lie , not knowing how his thoughts went , in a state of semi- consciousness that left him more tired than the day before . His work , however , showed no trace of fatigue . Ivor looked on with grave misgivings , astonished that he would not unburden his heart , seeing the fever on his brow , but powerless to influence him . Rupert , silent for hours , kept his friend in the Great Hall , and seemed disquieted if he went away ; which led to Ivor 's giving up the chalet and sleeping in his old room at the Court , next to Glanville 's . He received , a few days after his arrival , a most gracious letter from Lord Trelingham , who , with his daughter and the Countess Lutenieff , was staying in Paris at the house of a Legitimist noble , M. de Flamas . In his own epistle Ivor had said that Rupert had wanted him immediately , and he had ventured to anticipate the Earl 's permission to spend the necessary time at Trelingham . The Earl , in reply , hoped that Mr. Glanville was in his usual health , regretting that he had not heard from him for more than a month . Rupert , in fact , could not have said when he last wrote to Lord Trelingham . He had forgotten the name of Lady May. And so he continued to paint the Morte d'Arthur , working from his own designs as though they had been another 's , not creating but remembering , and with the refrain of his sad thoughts for an accompaniment . One evening as he was coming down the ladder from his high scaffold a fit of giddiness seized him , and but for his friend , who caught him as he slipped , the accident might have proved serious . He walked occasionally on the terrace ; but he would never visit any point from which the Hermitage was visible . When the letters came he inspected them eagerly . There was nothing from Colonel Valence Bernstein wrote several times , and Rupert did not answer . At last , when he had been working some ten days with despairing eagerness , he laid his brush down and said to Ivor , '
227835	229189	227829	227830	no one	5671	' Next day he was unable to rise . He slept a little , woke with a throbbing brow , and hardly knew who it was that sat by his bedside . Ivor sent for the physician that had attended Tom Davenant . When he came the patient was wandering in his mind , talking much but unintelligibly in a low tone , and stretching out his hands every moment for water . The attack , which had been delayed by Rupert 's energy for so many days , now came in full force . His reason , his life were in danger . There could be no thought of moving him . Ivor telegraphed to Lord Trelingham , and the same evening received an answer from Lady May announcing that they were coming home , and recommending the utmost care of Rupert . Though it was an abrupt termination to a visit that the Earl had long resolved to pay and was now enjoying , the good man , who liked Glanville exceedingly , at once complied with his daughter 's suggestion ; and they crossed the Channel twenty - four hours after the telegram had acquainted them with Rupert 's situation . The Countess , not so much interested as inquisitive , and just then at a loss what to do , accompanied them . I shall say little of Lady May 's feelings . They are easy to imagine ; they would take long to describe . How had she lived since her father 's illness had compelled her to quit Trelingham and Rupert Glanville ? As we all do when despair of some pleasant prospect has fallen upon us,—from day to day , without hope , letting the hours creep on , and finding existence like sand in the mouth . Rupert had never so much as addressed a line to her , though occasions were not wanting . He had sent the usual unmeaning messages through Lord Trelingham ; but , writing at length on subjects connected with painting , and diverging now and then to social topics , he did not wear his heart upon his sleeve . To guess at his inner life was impossible . He seemed happy ; the tone in which he indited these pleasant nothings was a sign of it . Had the Earl 's health been less uncertain , less dependent on clear skies and medicinal waters , she would have urged him to return home , to take up his residence in town , at any rate , during the season , where they must from time to time have had a visit from Glanville . But she was tired of devising schemes which brought her no nearer the goal . She lived a proud solitary life , making the most of her music as the channel of emotions she must otherwise conceal , and conscious every day that she was walking in a vain shadow . Of such an existence there is nothing to tell , except how long it lasted . For while there were endless changes of feeling , they bore no harvest . And now Glanville was down with brain fever , how brought on she could not imagine . Who was to nurse him while it lasted ? Any misfortune that left him helpless in her hands was welcome . They must hasten back , and keep him at Trelingham . the journey was accomplished slowly , because of the Earl ; but it could last only a short time at the outside . Lady May kept down her trouble . Karina , always watching , saw nothing to lay hold of . And soon they were all once more at home . The meeting between Lady May and Ivor was on both sides full of emotion . But the lady cared only for Rupert,—and his friend , at such a time , could not indulge in the self - torment of unrequited love . The patient 's delirium had increased ; he recognised no one , and he talked incessantly of the dreadful sights he had looked upon during his night - wanderings in London . Ivor thought himself bound by his injunction to let none pass the threshold of the sick - room , save the doctor and the nurse . He did not desire that Rupert 's secret should get abroad ; and his former suspicion that Lady May had some thought of marrying the artist , made him doubly unwilling that her presence should trouble him . But he had to deal with a determined woman . She satisfied Lord Trelingham by getting the physician to assure him that there was no risk of infection ; she submitted to the jealous surveillance exercised by Mardol over every one that came near his friend ; and she insisted on her right as hostess and a good Samaritan to see that all was as it should be about the invalid . She went and came , but Glanville did not look her way . Ivor gave him his medicine , contrived , with the nurse 's aid , to pour liquid nourishment down his throat ; and never left him day or night . It was an extraordinary thing that , in all his raving , one name never crossed the patient 's lips . It seemed to be erased from the folds of his brain , or to have sunk into the dim recesses whence fever could not pluck it forth . None but Ivor could have told how he came to be ill . He had overworked himself and undergone exposure to cold ; he must have been sickening when he left London . That was all Ivor would say . And the name of Hippolyta was never pronounced . Rupert , living over again the scenes which had followed her disappearance , recurred continually to the vision of the gray - haired woman whose form he had beheld in the dead - house — wherever it was , for he did not know . And by and by another took its place . All day long he murmured the name of Annie Dauris ; he described the wild look in her eyes with which she had started up in her bed at the hospital on seeing him . When the Jew acquainted him with her death he had made no remark ; his own trouble absorbed his fancy . But now he did not speak of Hippolyta . The unknown girl of seventeen , with her fair hair and pallid eyes , seemed to be staring at him terrifying him with the thoughts of muddy death , recounting the horrors of the wicked river flowing to the sea . A stranger would have guessed some story from his words , and guessed all wrong . But Ivor took care that Lady May should not overhear them . For weeks Rupert hung between life and death . His friend , on some pretext or other , twice drove to Toxenden,—the only occasions on which he quitted his bedside,—and walking by roundabout ways arrived at Falside . There was no news of Hippolyta . Colonel Valence had gone abroad . Ivor was thankful to have missed him . · · · · · · Such an one lives , says the Greek poet , that would be glad to die ; and Rupert Glanville 's story was not ended . Could he have chosen he would never have come back to a sense of misery . But neither of his life nor his death was he master . When the fever had brought him to the brink of the grave it left him . He awoke to a dull feeling of pain ; he looked round , saw Ivor , and called him . The loving fellow wept tears of gratitude . Rupert stretched a white hand out of the bedclothes and asked , as men do on recovering from a swoon , '
229197	229279	229193	229193	I	0	' He was told to keep still and to refrain from talking . He slept once more . Next day when he woke there was no pain , but extreme weakness , and in that state he lay for a long time . Lady May came frequently , as often as she dared . He showed no sign of displeasure ; he hardly noticed . Later on , when he was convalescent , he saw that she looked worn and thin . '
229287	229964	229965	229965	He	4877	' he asked , with the naïve manner which comes back at that stage , a reminiscence of childhood . She smiled rather sadly , and answered that it was gone . Lord Trelingham 's presence gave him evident pleasure ; but he did not talk much . He would fix his eyes on Lady May as long as she stayed in the room ; and when she disappeared , he gazed after her . He did not ask who she was , but Ivor sometimes thought his memory must be affected ; for he seemed not to recall her name , and when he spoke , it was either of their schooldays or of the unfinished frescoes which he was anxious to go on with . Had he forgotten Hippolyta ? His friend , dreading a relapse , did not venture to come near the subject . But one day , before he could prevent himself , the name slipped out . Rupert gave no sign . His countenance did not change . He answered the question that had been put to him , but it was about the Hermitage , and he passed over the once - loved name as though it had been some foreign term , or he had not heard it . During his long illness Ivor , who opened all the letters that came , read several from Mr. Bernstein , the last of which declared that he looked on Mrs. Malcolm 's recovery as impossible , and declined to prosecute the search any longer . He enclosed a formidable account . Ivor went to Lord Trelingham , borrowed the money ( for Rupert was still delirious ) , and sent it by return of post to Mr. Bernstein . Now he did not know what to do with the receipt . Money of his own would be shortly due , enough to repay Lord Trelingham , though leaving himself poor enough for the next twelve months . But if Rupert had forgotten , why recall this frightful business ? He thrust the Jew 's epistles into the fire ; he locked away the receipt among his own papers ; and the artist , who put no questions , did not hear from the private inquiry office again . It was midsummer , and one of the pleasantest days of the year , when Rupert came down , recovered in health , but somewhat changed , it would appear , in disposition . He was no longer melancholy or fantastic , neither was there the same brightness about him . He seemed grateful to every one for a kind word . He sat and walked a great deal with Ivor in the course of the next few days ; then he would stay longer in the drawing - room , and Lady May observed , with the most exquisite delight , that he seemed to depend on her for his comfort , and asked her often to improvise on the piano , while he sat and listened . The Countess had gone away at an early stage of his illness ; she could not endure invalids . She said the thought of one in the house made her unwell . Tom Davenant , when he knew that Ivor was back again at Trelingham , wrote to him often , and in the most affectionate terms ; but he was still smarting under his disappointment , and paid them no visit . So that Rupert and Lady May were almost as much alone as when they spent their mornings in the picture - gallery . Ivor , looking on with kinder and sadder eyes than the Countess had done,—now nearly two years ago , — considered how these things might end . He spoke to Rupert casually of Falside . There was no tremor in return . He went so far , in his experiment , as to remark that Colonel Valence must be from home , and the artist replied , '
229974	230102	229965	229965	He	4877	' Could it be possible that the episode of his affection for Hippolyta , with all its incidents , was blotted from his memory ? Full of the idea , and ready to encourage it in Rupert 's interest , Ivor did a bold thing . When Mr. Bernstein wrote to resign his commission , he added that Mrs. Malcolm 's portrait had been returned to Mr. Glanville 's house in Belgravia . Not long after , an epistle from his solicitor , which Ivor opened , apprised him of the place where Rupert and Hippolyta had lived during their brief union . The man of business required instructions as to Forrest House . Mr. and Mrs. Malcolm , it appeared , had left suddenly ; the servants '
230292	230302	230289	230289	he	4888	' Would it be well for Rupert to marry ? '
230303	230306	230308	230309	the physician	1406	' Yes , '
230311	230494	230495	230495	Rupert	242	' but not to live in the neighbourhood of his disaster . Let him marry and go abroad , practise his profession , and be kept from everything which would remind him of the lost Hippolyta . From that moment Ivor resolved that the marriage should take place , cost what it might to himself or to any one else . He felt a choking sensation in his throat ; it was surrendering his dearest illusions . But let them go , he said , provided Rupert were safe . On his return he found matters unchanged , the lady devoted to the gentleman , and the gentleman strangely dependent on the lady . He took Rupert aside one bright afternoon , as they were walking on the terrace , when the air was full of sweetness , the moor glorious under floating clouds , the sea flashing upon the horizon . There was a party of lawn - tennis at Trelingham , and the laughing voices of young people and the sound of their playing came up where the friends paused . '
230497	230501	230507	230508	Lady May	244	' said Ivor , '
230510	230526	230527	230527	I	0	' He waited with intense anxiety for the answer , but it was not long . '
230533	230543	230545	230545	you	242	' replied his friend , in a calm voice ; '
230552	230554	230547	230547	she	244	' — '
230560	230567	230568	230568	she	244	' said the chivalrous young man ; '
230579	230627	230568	230568	she	244	' Glanville raised his eyes . She was alone , pacing up and down thoughtfully . He quitted Ivor , went slowly along , looking neither to the right nor to the left , until he approached within a yard of her . She stopped and turned . '
230631	230642	230628	230629	Lady May	244	' he said , holding his hat in his hand , '
230659	230673	230676	230676	you	277	' Her heart gave a great leap . She put out her hand . '
230682	230705	230676	230676	you	277	' she said . And they walked back along the terrace together . Ivor was watching them and saw what had passed . '
230710	230730	230676	230676	you	277	' he murmured in a half - groan as he turned away . But they were by his side . '
230737	230761	230735	230735	Ivor	277	' said his friend , with a subdued tenderness that had something marvellously strange in it to one who knew his fiery temperament . '
230777	230787	230771	230771	you	277	' The promise was given . Rupert continuing said , '
230823	230841	230804	230804	he	0	' She was surprised ; but Ivor thought,'What good genius inspired him to say that at once ? '
230940	230948	230949	230949	she	722	' Karina knew my secret long ago , '
230952	230963	230949	230949	she	722	' this gentleman has kept his till to - day . '
230979	230999	230964	230964	Rupert	242	' I meant to ask you when I finished the Madonna of the Seraphim ; but I went away . '
231000	231005	231006	231006	she	722	' Ah , yes , '
231015	231026	231006	231006	she	722	' you went away . But you never shall again . '
231033	231045	231046	231046	he	243	' Are you sure that you can make Mr. Glanville happy ? '
231052	231065	231006	231006	she	722	' in a marriage like this so much depends on the wife . '—'I
231073	231085	231069	231069	I	0	' she answered , and Rupert thanked her with his eyes . '
231089	231094	231104	231104	You	5673	' said the Earl , '
231123	231125	231126	231126	she	4904	'—'Oh , '
231130	231173	231126	231126	she	4904	' because of the horoscope . But are you quite certain it was Tom 's and not mine ? Mistakes will happen , I suppose , even in astrology . But we believe in happy stars , do n't we , Rupert ? '
231192	231211	231179	231179	she	4904	' What was that about Tom Davenant 's horoscope ? he inquired , as they left the library . '
231217	231221	231179	231179	she	4904	' she said ; '
231247	231262	231228	231228	I	0	' They heard the tennis - players coming from their game , laughing merrily . '
231272	231948	231228	231228	I	0	' murmured Rupert , as they stood once more on the terrace , with the sea in front of them . May put her hand in his , and they continued gazing in silence , side by side . The announcement which Madame de Lutenieff had mockingly foretold — of a marriage between the well - known artist and the daughter of a great peer — was delayed until Rupert had fulfilled his task and the frescoes were complete . They made a magnificent show , but he entreated that their formal exhibition to the world might not take place until Lady May and himself had quitted Trelingham . He could not bear to be congratulated . He knew that the work was equal to anything achieved in England of late years ; and he thought it would speak for itself to those who had eyes in their heads . It was part of his strangeness that he never referred to the memorable evening of the ball at which , for the first and last time , he had danced with Hippolyta . Some allusion was necessarily made to the tableaux vivants , but from him it drew no response . Had he forgotten , or was he acting a part ? Ivor , staying by express invitation from the Earl , who perceived that Glanville derived much benefit from his company , was convinced that the fever had passed a sponge not only over Hippolyta 's name , but over the scenes wherein she had appeared . He dreaded accidental references to her , and sought occasion one day to whisper in the ear of the Earl 's daughter that if she desired Rupert 's continuance in the health he was enjoying , she must be careful not to mention Falside , or any one connected with it . In surprise she asked the reason . He thought it best to reply , with seeming frankness , that Glanville 's attack of fever was due to an accident he had sustained near the cottage ; that during his delirium the least allusion to place or people made him much worse ; and that she might notice for herself how completely he kept silence about them since he had recovered . Lady May thanked him . She remembered now that the name of Colonel Valence or his daughter had not been heard from Rupert 's lips during the past months . Ivor begged her to warn Lord Trelingham . She did so , and the tacit consent was renewed which for years had banished the name of Valence from conversation at the Court . There was considerable stir in the great world when their engagement became known . It had then existed nearly six months , and the marriage was to take place before Lent . This was a stipulation of Lord Trelingham 's , to which his daughter willingly acceded , as likewise to the arrangement whereby all the glory of it was to overshadow his favourite church , St. Ethelfleda 's , in Duke 's Lane . The ecclesiastical ceremonies would be elaborate , and some of them , it was thought , illegal ; but on these points the Earl admitted of no compromise . Rupert assented languidly . He could have wished to be married on the Continent ; but if that might not be , anywhere was better than Trelingham . The settlements involved less delay than usual . Lady May 's interest in the Earl 's entailed property was slight ; and her personal fortune , though smaller than it would have been in more skilful hands than her father 's , was perfectly safe , and included neither land nor houses . Rupert was , if anything , the wealthier of the two . His solicitor drew up a lucid inventory of his goods and belongings ; among them was Forrest House , now let at a handsome figure to a tenant who held it on a seven years '
232009	232017	232018	232018	she	244	' It must be worth a visit , '
232021	232024	232018	232018	she	244	' No , '
232086	232089	232097	232112	that particular one of his confrères who had first given Lady May an account of him	4913	' best men '
232176	232183	232185	232186	a cynic	4918	' He is subdued before marriage , '
232188	232204	232185	232186	a cynic	4918	' well , as lief sune as syne ; all men are subdued after it . '
232923	232947	232910	232911	The artist	5691	' Pardon me , sir . I seem to recollect your face , but I can not tell where it was we met . '
232985	232994	232974	232974	He	4320	' then raising his voice , said pleasantly , '
233000	233005	232974	232974	He	4320	' and passed on . '
233010	233017	233018	233021	The Duke of Adullam	4329	' inquired the artist of Lady May. '
233023	233040	233018	233021	The Duke of Adullam	4329	' she answered , wondering in her own mind where they could have known one another . '
233050	233125	233018	233021	The Duke of Adullam	4329	' said her husband . It was the only time they met abroad . May Glanville was jealous of her husband 's fame , and , while they were at Nice expecting Tom Davenant , she began to urge him , somewhat vehemently , to resume his painting . He replied,'I have no inspiration . The spirit has gone out of me . I could not design a fresh drawing to save my life . '—'Why
233133	233137	233129	233129	you	0	' she said ; '
233153	233177	233148	233148	I	0	' He was willing , but not interested . The drawings were brought down , and Lady May began to turn them over . '
233183	233209	233148	233148	I	0	' she said , holding the largest of them out to him . He took it in silence . It was a water - colour . '
233216	233222	233223	233223	May	575	' he muttered to himself . '
233233	233243	233244	233245	No one	5671	' He seemed to be searching in his memory . '
233250	233254	233244	233245	No one	5671	' she answered ; '
233269	233271	233257	233257	you	0	' — '
233274	233282	233257	233257	you	0	' he said , shaking his head ; '
233302	233546	233286	233286	I	0	' His wife , mindful of Ivor 's warning , and terrified at the change in his expression , took the sketch and hid it away . He would not paint that morning , and they went down to the sea . After dinner he asked to look at the drawing again , but it could not be found . His mind seemed busy with it while he slept , and he awoke several times in the night with sobs choking him . Lady May was in consternation . She never urged him to paint again . Tom Davenant 's arrival gave them pleasanter occupation . He was still the wild huntsman , nor had he lost that boyish innocence which made his talk , though neither witty nor profound , so engaging . A life of adventure could not take away the ruddy and white of his countenance ; the feminine beauty and the open beaming eyes had in nothing altered . But his bearing was more manly ; he dwelt a little on the social aspect of landed property , and said he should take Ivor Mardol 's advice what to do about his tenants when he got back to Foxholme . He was reserved and courteous with Lady May , spent most of his time with the Earl , and seemed struck with the alteration in Glanville , whom he had never set eyes on since the coming of age . '
233555	233559	233560	233560	I	0	' he remarked ; '
233567	233917	233565	233565	Glanville	575	' He readily consented to accompany them on their tour . You could get riding and shooting in Spain of an uncommonly good sort ; and the fishing , a man told him in America , was superb , if you knew where to look for it . They must be careful of the season , that was all . And he helped Glanville to draw out what they called a fever time - table , showing when the air was deadly to foreigners in the various provinces . Lord Trelingham , though not a rapid , was a good traveller . Rupert did not care how long the journeys took . His sole desire was not to return to England . He would have liked Ivor to join them ; but Ivor was now working hard to keep himself alive and had sold his genius to a newspaper . He did not meddle with Socialism , nor had he entered a lodge since the fatal night in Denzil Lane They were still at Nice , when Rupert one afternoon , being too fatigued to go out on the beach , stayed in to write a letter or two , and was resting by the open window . It was a lovely winter 's day , the sea tranquil , and the lights subdued and pensive , while the air came in warm gusts through the casement , which was completely framed in leaves . Glanville felt very weak ; his mind , too , was distracted , he could not tell why . The letter he was writing would not get itself finished . He let his pen drop , took up a paper - knife , and began to make imaginary drawings on the desk . While he was playing idly with it , and the confused memories of the last three years were passing through his brain , a thought struck him , and he looked attentively at the desk , almost as though it were a living thing which could tell him what he wanted . '
233931	233947	233927	233927	he	0	' I know there must be a reason . Did it belong to any one ? '
233985	233990	233991	233991	he	0	' Looking for letters , '
233995	234038	233991	233991	he	0	' who was it that turned over a great pile of correspondence , looking for letters ? I was standing by . And there was only a candle burning . At night it was , surely . I wish I could remember . '
234212	234215	234196	234196	he	0	' Hippolyta . '
234365	234378	234379	234379	he	0	' What if the fever should return , and I forget again ! '
234481	234489	234490	234490	she	575	' Where are you going , dear ? '
234498	234503	234490	234490	she	575	' For a walk , '
234508	234520	234490	234490	she	575	' I shall not dine . Do n't wait for me . '
234545	234548	234550	234551	Lady May	575	' Tom , '
234556	234582	234550	234551	Lady May	575	' something has happened . Rupert is not well . Follow him , please , and keep him in sight till he comes home again . '
234766	234771	234772	234772	she	575	' Are you better ? '
234779	234788	234789	234789	he	242	' As well as I ever shall be , '
235061	235068	235058	235058	He	5691	' I do not love her , '
235315	235324	235325	235325	she	400	' Have you heard of Miss Valence lately ? '
235343	235355	235335	235335	He	6183	' Never mention that name in my hearing , you witch , '
235371	235393	235360	235360	She	400	' I knew it was not all fancy . Take care they never meet , or you will suffer the consequences . '
235617	235624	235964	235965	no conqueror	5008	' Last Sigh of the Moor , '
235651	235731	235964	235965	no conqueror	5008	' riding such as Tom Davenant had not enjoyed in his life ; for he delighted in landscape , though he never spoke of it . The third day had been allowed for the sake of his cousin and her two invalids . Rupert , still fighting with madness , saw the beautiful things of their pilgrimage as in a dream . But the Sierra Nevada , with its glittering snows , made him lift his eyes to it . '
235742	235751	235735	235735	I	0	' he murmured in the sweet familiar words , '
235761	235961	235753	235753	I	0	' They had come through Barcelona , but he had prevailed on them not to explore what sights it possessed . He could not bear anything that reminded him of Hippolyta ; the remembrance that she was born in this land of the sun made it melancholy to him . But he would have been sorry to leave it were the moment of departure at hand . Which this of our travellers was self - controlled enough to find due pleasure in the walks by Genil and Darro , in the endless unfolding dream of Alhambra and Alameda , with their thousand reminiscences from a dead and gone time ? Not Rupert . The green Vega , the rosy - tinted snows , the silence as of eternal mourning for a past that could never be restored , the pathos , the desolation,—these spoke to his heart , soothing it a little . They went on to Cordova , built by the Moslems in their ages of faith and high fortune , when their sword carved out empire and their chisel smoothed the marble blocks into symmetry , making of them sanctuaries wherein stood the golden - fretted inscription , '
235969	236542	235967	235967	Allah	578	' The artist - soul began to stir in Glanville . He felt a desire to sketch these Oriental - looking houses , to visit the great mosque under changing lights , to steal its colour from the Sierra for his canvas . But a very slight excursion with Tom Davenant in the vicinity — Tom pursuing the sport which abounds here , and Rupert loitering to fill his sketch - book — convinced him that he must lay aside the pencil again and fight his ghostly enemy with other weapons . He was too weak to paint . The spring was not much advanced when they came to Seville , which they proposed to make their resting - place till the first heats should compel them to go on . The bright city , beloved of Moor and Christian , pleased them more than all they had seen . Situate in the midst of a watered garden , sheltered to north and south by a double parapet of hills , lit up with a clear sun which makes the air transparent like glass and brings out all delicate and fervent colour , with a gay and smiling population moving in the shade of the narrow , winding streets , or basking in the warm sunshine , it might well have seemed a Paradise for the convalescent spirit , that could be cheered and strengthened only by surrendering itself to gentle influences . The nights were fresh ; the air exhilarated like wine . For Rupert , the physician said , if he would not expose himself to the levante — the wind from the African deserts — there was no climate more suited . His prostration of spirits would cease ; work would again be possible . Lady May devoutly hoped they should witness a change in him for the better ere they set out travelling again . The pictures , the glories of Murillo , the Herreras , and Zurbaran that made Seville a treasury , ought to rouse his enthusiasm , his emulation . Surely he would not renounce his splendid calling ? And she quoted many of his sayings in the gallery at Trelingham,—how art itself , pursued in a spirit of truth , demanded and drew forth a heroism equal to the highest . He listened , he assented , but he was cold . Yet there came refreshment to his weary spirit , though the star of hope had set never to rise again . He was glad to have lapsed , as it were , out of the busy modern life into a realm where all that was living belonged to the past , like a vision made palpable to the sense , but remaining a vision still . The memories of those London nights did not vex him so keenly . He strolled about alone , crossed the river frequently to explore Triana , the gipsy suburb , and distract himself with the strange costumes , dilapidated , picturesque lanes , and odd - looking bits of colour which seemed quainter and more out of the world the more he studied them . His health improved . But with returning strength came a feeling of estrangement from Lady May that , conceal it as he might , would make its presence known by imperceptible channels . She was alarmed , indignant , at her wits '
236589	236663	235967	235967	Allah	578	' quarrels ; but they were sometimes near quarrelling now , and the atmosphere was charged with thunder . May Glanville was jealous . Of whom or what ? Of a dead love , a memory , a regret ? Suppose , after all , he had once cared for Hippolyta Valence , what did it signify ? All men had such things in their lives . Was he not a devoted husband ? '
236672	236750	235967	235967	Allah	578	' she answered with a sigh . Tom Davenant was sorry that they had not stayed at Cordova , the country round which , with its pine forests and wild - wooded hollows , he preferred to the environs of Seville . But coming in after a long day 's rambling , he upbraided his friends at dinner for not having paid a visit which , he supposed , they would have undertaken at the earliest opportunity . '
236755	236760	235967	235967	Allah	578	' Lady May inquired . '
236784	236790	235967	235967	Allah	578	' he asked in turn . '
236798	236803	235967	235967	Allah	578	' replied his cousin , '
236812	236816	236817	236817	I	0	' said Tom ; '

236889	236936	236887	236887	Tom	250	' and I thought it looked as gloomy as any place I ever saw . But the country all about is fine . Why do n't you make an expedition to the convent ? You could get there by driving in three days at the outside . '
236937	236945	236947	236948	the Earl	663	' It would be an agreeable diversion , '
236950	236961	236947	236948	the Earl	663	' Do you suppose we could put up at Sepúlveda ? '
236962	236971	236973	236973	Tom	250	' I will tell you the best way , '
236975	237075	236973	236973	Tom	250	' I came round on Sepúlveda — what a name!—by cross - roads , and I saw the convent , standing out very clear on one side of the valley , and a large white house , which I took to be a sort of paseo , if it was not an inn , on the other . Let us look in the guide - book . An inn at that spot would be exactly what you want . You could sleep the night there , go over your convent next morning , and come back when you pleased . '
237900	237910	237912	237913	Lady May.	394	' I am glad we are not staying here , '
238262	238269	238271	238271	Rupert	242	' The landscape has fallen asleep , '

240622	240627	240618	240619	the nun	5197	' I am Hippolyta . '
240694	240717	240688	240688	he	242	' What has become of your golden hair ? It was so beautiful . Why do you hide it under that veil ? '
240728	240735	240736	240737	the nun	5197	' I have cut it off , '
240756	240772	240773	240773	he	242	' I saw a woman in the hospital that they told me had golden hair , '
240776	240854	240855	240855	He	242	' when I was looking for you the first night ; but they had never seen yours , Hippolyta , or they would not have said so . The woman came back when I was ill , when I had brain fever . She was dead then , I think . Her name was Annie Dauris . Her hair was not like yours , Hippolyta . Why did you cut it off ? Are you a nun ? '
240869	240878	240880	240880	Hippolyta	394	' Oh , must I suffer this again ! '
240888	240913	240880	240880	Hippolyta	394	' Rupert , Rupert , be a man . I have left you , I am nothing to you . Are you not married ? '
240914	240917	240918	240918	he	242	' Yes , '
240922	240941	240942	240942	He	242	' Would you believe it , darling , that I forgot even your name when I was ill ? '
240959	241040	240942	240942	He	242	' I did n't remember that I had seen you till one day , one winter 's afternoon , when I found your letters , and it all came back . Why did you leave me ? Was I unkind to you ? I never meant to be . It made me ill for a long while ; it made me forget everything . I married — you know who it is , you were friends once — May Davenant . '
241107	241113	241114	241114	he	242	' Why did you go ? '
241133	241142	241143	241143	she	394	' Because it was wrong from the beginning , '
241146	241269	241143	241143	she	394	' because I sinned and made you to sin ; because He spoke to me from the Cross and chided me , and my heart broke . I could not , I could not , Rupert , stay with you when I was so guilty . I went because the sound was in my ears of lost souls , and polluted children , and murdered maidens . I was worse than all ; I had believed in sin , dedicated myself to sin ; how could I face you when the light broke on me and I saw myself — stained , stained ? Oh , I went . I would have thrown myself into the fire if it might cleanse me . '
241270	241276	241277	241277	he	5205	' You were never stained , '
241288	241304	241277	241277	he	5205	' you were my own Hippolyta . I loved you . Did you love me ? '
241305	241310	241311	241311	she	5206	' Ah , Rupert , '
241326	241333	241334	241334	he	5205	' Never mind , never mind , '
241347	241375	241334	241334	he	5205	' But I would have married you — I told you so at the beginning — when you pleased . It was only to say the word . '
241376	241384	241385	241385	she	5206	' There was no marriage for me , '
241388	241408	241385	241385	she	5206	' the past could never be undone . I sinned with Magdalene . I must do penance with Magdalene . '
241409	241417	241419	241419	Rupert	242	' And you would not marry me ? '
241459	241489	241456	241456	Hippolyta	394	' I had fallen below marriage . My sin spoilt our affection ; it took away its sacredness . It made me unfit to be any man 's wife . '
241490	241499	241500	241500	he	242	' Who taught you it was a sin ? '
241571	241577	241578	241578	she	394	' Look who taught me , '
241601	241612	241613	241613	he	242	' I do not like that symbol to be everywhere , '
241617	241632	241613	241613	he	242	' Spain is covered with it . You ought to have stayed in England . '
241633	241644	241645	241645	she	394	' I made it my book before I left England , '
241648	241671	241672	241672	she	394	' Will you hear my story , Rupert ? It will reconcile you to our separation — if you ever loved me , '
241687	241696	241697	241697	he	242	' Must we separate because I love you ? '
241700	241713	241714	241714	his	242	' Hippolyta , be merciful . I have suffered — so much , '
241718	241744	241714	241714	his	242	' not pain only and fever , but madness , despair , a gnawing at the heart that will not , will not leave me . '
241824	241834	241835	241835	she	394	' How could I be the same to you ? '
241861	241947	241835	241835	she	394	' How to meet you next morning ? I cast myself on the mercy of God , whom I did not know , who was hidden , yet had sent this message to me . I had but an hour to decide . When the light came , in the gray cheerless dusk , I wrote — oh , they were hard words ; I made them so . I wanted you to despise , not to search for me . I made them hard . '
241948	241954	241956	241956	Rupert	242	' They almost killed me , '
241958	241973	241956	241956	Rupert	242	' do not be afraid , they were cruel enough . Look at them . '
241993	242005	242006	242006	he	242	' I have always carried them since the day at Nice , '
242009	242020	242006	242006	he	242	' They are poison , the antidote to lesser grief . '
242030	242042	242043	242043	she	394	' How can you be so harsh to yourself , Rupert ? '
242047	242054	242043	242043	she	394	' Let this be the end . '
242055	242060	242061	242061	he	242	' It shall be , '
242107	242128	242093	242093	She	5211	' There are two gentlemen , foreigners , inquiring for you , sister . They say they are from England . '
242129	242137	242139	242139	Hippolyta	394	' Two strangers , did you say ? '
242148	242160	242167	242167	she	394	' Who can they be ? One I might have expected . '
242175	242197	242167	242167	she	394	' Take them to the other guest - room and say I will come . Ask them to wait a little . '
242220	242228	242232	242232	herself	394	' I thought I heard some one , '
242234	242254	242232	242232	herself	394	' it must have been the lay - sister moving about . Why did she not come in immediately ? '
242551	242556	242557	242557	she	575	' This , this , '
242562	242571	242557	242557	she	575	' is the secret ; this explains all . '
242848	242858	242860	242862	her poor rival	5237	' I wrote those words as an everlasting farewell , '
242872	243048	242860	242862	her poor rival	5237	' and I put them in the blotting - book , and crept downstairs and out by the front door . No one saw me . The street was empty . There was only one place in which I could take shelter . I thought they would receive me at the convent , if I told them — if I might speak again to the priest whose sermon I had heard . It was but a little way , and I kept in the shadow of the houses ; and then the morning was dark , and I came to the convent door without being noticed , and I stood there awhile , not daring to ring . But there was no time to consider . I rang twice and thrice ; nobody came . Oh , it was a terrible moment ; yet I could think of nothing except that perhaps they would not open . Rupert , if the grave had been my only refuge , I had no power to go back . '
243049	243055	243056	243056	he	5238	' Do n't torture me , '
243060	243068	243056	243056	he	5238	' do you think I am adamant ? '
243069	243075	243076	243076	she	5239	' Do n't be angry , '
243085	243099	243076	243076	she	5239	' oh , how happy we might have been but for my wickedness ! '
243100	243107	243108	243108	he	5238	' We shall be happy yet , '
243147	243151	243152	243152	she	5239	' At last , '
243155	243298	243152	243152	she	5239	' I could hear footsteps as of several passing along , and I rang loudly . This time the door opened . The sisters were coming from an early mass in their own chapel . I stood inside near the door waiting till they had passed . The portress , I could see , was startled at my appearance . I did not know what to say . But I told her that I wanted to see the Mother ; that I was in great trouble ; I persuaded her to take my message . Oh , what a morning it was ! The Mother came ; I went into a private room with her , and she was good and compassionate , and I confessed everything . She pitied , she did not despise me , as I thought she would . '
244315	244318	244320	244320	Hippolyta	367	' No , '
244322	244474	244320	244320	Hippolyta	367	' I asked them to let me work in London , but they refused . I wanted to be a lay - sister at the convent , and that , too , they said was unfit for me . I had been with them nearly a year when Father Laurence came to me , and proposed I should join the new order of which this is the noviciate . It has been founded to help towards the elevation and conversion of women in the East — a work that can be attempted only by women . It is an active order , not cloistered . I was glad to come , though it has made my penance more dreadful to be at San Lucar , reminded always of the past . But in a few months I shall sail for India . I am professed and acquainted with my new duties . '
244475	244481	244483	244483	Rupert	242	' Does Colonel Valence know ? '
244492	244500	244501	244501	she	5282	' He will soon , I think , '
244524	244573	244574	244574	she	5282	' When I knew that I was to leave Europe I sent him a message through his old friend , the Duke of Adullam , telling him where I was and what I thought of doing . There was no danger in that , now you are married , '
244579	244582	244584	244584	Glanville	242	' None , '
244625	244647	244608	244608	he	242	' You have explained all , darling , and there is nothing to forgive . When shall we return to England ? '
244652	244660	244661	244661	she	5282	' If Lady May is with you , '
244664	244702	244661	244661	she	5282	' it might be well for you to go immediately . She ought not to guess at what has passed ; and to meet would be too painful . I do not think I could bear it . '
244703	244711	244712	244712	he	242	' Who was talking of Lady May ? '
244715	244815	244712	244712	he	242	' I meant you and me , Hippolyta . We have met ; I know what you have been doing away from me ; and it is all as it should be . We shall never part again . The listener , so many times torn with anguish during Hippolyta 's narrative , was sick unto death . But she must endure a little longer . The nun , the fallen woman , was speaking — oh , how tender she could be ! Yes , she called him Rupert , in spite of her self - chosen penances . '
244819	244824	244712	244712	he	242	' Hippolyta was saying , '
244852	244853	244846	244846	I	0	' '
244856	244860	244861	244861	you	5283	' he exclaimed ; '
244903	244947	244901	244901	you	5283	' His voice sank . Had he taken her hand or knelt to her ? The listening woman dared not move , though she would have given worlds to see with her own eyes the degradation into which both of them were falling . '
244967	244971	244977	244977	man	6250	' Hippolyta replied ; '
244987	244988	244981	244981	You	242	' '
244992	245004	244981	244981	You	242	' he said with a ring of desperation in his voice ; '
245079	245098	245077	245077	you	394	' The accents of the speaker were high and piercing . They filled the room with their echo . '
245104	245221	245099	245099	He	5290	' said Lady May in a dull whisper . She left her hiding - place and went slowly and noiselessly out on the terrace , then moved with unequal but hasty steps along the narrow track by which Rupert and herself had come up . It lay out of sight of the cell - window a high , narrow grating , through which the lake was visible , as I have said , only in the farther distance . Glanville , utterly oblivious that he had left Lady May in the church , continued to plead his cause with passionate vehemence , while Hippolyta , though not to be moved , became every moment more wretched . '
245224	245235	245099	245099	He	5290	' she said at last , as her tears fell , '
245291	245292	245285	245285	you	5291	' '
245300	245336	245293	245293	I	0	' he cried wildly . He had no sooner uttered the words than they heard a woman 's scream from the water , echoed by confused exclamations and the rush of feet on the terrace . '
245341	245708	245725	245725	they?'—'Look	5296	' said Hippolyta , running out , followed by Glanville . A dreadful sight met their gaze . The boat in which Rupert had come was floating in the middle of the lake , apparently adrift ; and in the water they saw a form rising to the surface , which , with cries of horror , they both recognised as Lady May. Her face , turned towards them , was distinctly visible . Then it disappeared in the depths . As it did so , a second figure which they had seen running to the lake - side leaped in , and swam rapidly to the place where the body had gone down . Hippolyta and Rupert , out of themselves with anguish , ran headlong through the low underwood and arrived on the bank just as the stranger who had plunged in turned round towards the shore , keeping himself afloat as well as he could while holding the inanimate form of May Glanville . Others came running at the same time , fishermen from the upper stream , men and women from the church and the convent . The disaster had been viewed from all sides ; it could not have been in a more conspicuous part of the river or the valley . But assistance had come apparently too late . The young man who had rescued Lady May was seen to pause ere he reached the bank , exhausted ; he gave a faint cry ; and rescued and rescuer sank into the waters again . Several of the fishermen leaped in bravely , and between them brought the bodies to land , clinging in a close embrace . But there seemed no life in either . It was a moment of awful confusion . For hardly were they laid on the sand than an old man who had been standing by motionless , watching all , but unable to stir from his place , rushed suddenly forward , and flinging his arms round the young man 's body , fainted . Rupert drew near , gave one startled glance , uttered an exclamation , and would have led Hippolyta away . '
245713	245717	245725	245725	they?'—'Look	5296	' she said ; '
245727	245794	245725	245725	they?'—'Look	5296	' he said in a terrified whisper . She bent over the old man . It was Colonel Valence . He held Ivor Mardol in his arms . Then it was that Hippolyta 's heroic nature showed itself . She did not fall or faint ; but while those around stood frightened and bewildered , she took Rupert by the arm , and said to him , '
245808	245954	245955	245955	He	5298	' Unlocking Lady May 's arms from the neck of the unhappy Ivor , whom she had dragged down with her into the depths , she and Rupert between them lifted her from the ground and put her gently into the arms of the rough fishermen , who carried their sad burden , lifeless as it still appeared , through the door from which a short while ago she had issued in her madness , to the cell where the fatal conversation had taken place . The nuns came about her . A bed was hastily strewn on the floor , and all possible efforts were made to restore the spirit which had seemingly fled . Ivor lay on the sand , his eyes closed and his limbs motionless , but a faint pulsation could be detected when Rupert put his hand to his heart . '
245960	246051	245955	245955	He	5298	' said he , bursting into tears . Colonel Valence was some time in coming to himself ; nor was it without difficulty that his arms could be disentangled from the embrace in which he clasped Ivor Mardol . Till that was done there was no moving them . Hippolyta knelt by her father and put a cordial to his lips . He drew a deep breath , as if awaking from a sleep , opened his eyes , looked round , and did not seem to know any one . '
246057	246067	246068	246068	Ivor	277	' he said in a stifled , unnatural tone . '
246074	246151	246068	246068	Ivor	277	' whispered Hippolyta . She was too much intent on recovering him from his swoon to notice what he had said . Colonel Valence rose , took Ivor once more into his arms , and turned towards the house . No one could hinder him . Walking steadily under the corpse - like weight , he went up through the brushwood and did not pause till he reached the terrace , Hippolyta and the rest following . '
246159	246175	246068	246068	Ivor	277	' he said , always in the same unnatural voice . Don Ramiro , the nuns '
246193	246206	246068	246068	Ivor	277	' In my room ; let me help you to carry him . '
246662	246674	246676	246677	the Earl	663	' She is dead — she is dead , I know , '
246680	246696	246676	246677	the Earl	663	' but let me see her . I implore you to let me see her . '
246702	246714	246716	246717	Colonel Valence	274	' She is not dead , and she shall not die , '
246739	246749	246750	246750	he	243	' If she is living , I can wait , '
246784	246790	246791	246791	he	250	' Are you Miss Valence ? '
246797	246802	246803	246803	she	5328	' Yes , yes , '
246807	246830	246831	246832	The Earl	663	' But take Lord Trelingham away , see , into that other room . Make him sit down till I come again . '
246835	246843	246844	246844	he	663	' I saw it from the hotel , '
246848	246910	246844	246844	he	663	' she slipped from the prow of the boat into the water . It was an accident , was it not ? Tell me it was an accident . Tell me she is not dead . But oh , it was so strange to see her fall over the edge of the boat and no one near . Where was Rupert ? '
246911	246921	246923	246923	Hippolyta	367	' Do take him away , dear Mr. Davenant , '
246928	246952	246923	246923	Hippolyta	367	' if his daughter should hear the voice , it may kill her . I will come again the moment she is restored . '
247142	247147	247138	247138	Hippolyta	367	' She shall live ; '
247432	247444	247424	247425	Tom Davenant	250	' Wait for Miss Valence ; she said she would come . '
247445	247451	247453	247454	the Earl	663	' Where is Miss Valence ? '
247457	247464	247453	247454	the Earl	663	' I have not seen her . '
247465	247474	247476	247476	Tom	250	' It was she that spoke to us , '
247478	247489	247476	247476	Tom	250	' the sister . She will come . Be patient . '
247645	247652	247653	247653	she	575	' Oh , the horrible vision ! '
247672	247677	247678	247678	she	575	' Is it gone ? '
247684	247752	247678	247678	she	575	' I thought it might be there still and haunt me for ever . They say hell is made of such visions ; they come in fire , and will not depart . Merciful God , grant me another hell than that . The fire I will endure , I will not complain . I have deserved it . Only do not let the vision come back . '
247818	247840	247797	247803	the penitent , heart - broken Hippolyta	5362	' Lady May , forgive me . As you hope to be forgiven , do not speak those frightful words again . '
247841	247847	247849	247850	the other	618	' Are you still there ? '
247866	247915	247849	247850	the other	618	' Are we both in hell — you for being a harlot , and I for killing myself ? I should be happy if I thought the fire had got hold of you . I hate you , Hippolyta Valence . I ought to have killed you first . '
248002	248016	248018	248019	the nun	5197	' Your daughter has recovered from her swoon , but she is wandering , '
248027	248040	248018	248019	the nun	5197	' If you would sit by her bedside it might calm her . '
248050	248058	248041	248042	Lord Trelingham	243	' You are Lady May 's saviour . '—'Ah
248061	248074	248075	248075	Rupert	242	' said Hippolyta , her glance sinking ; I have saved nobody . '
248079	248086	248087	248087	he	242	' Will you always malign yourself ? '
248135	248150	248122	248123	Tom Davenant	250	' Is there anything I can do for you , Glanville?'—'Try to save Ivor , '
248401	248414	248415	248416	The doctor	1301	' How long will my boy live ? I am his father . '
248422	248437	248438	248438	he	1301	' Why did you not tell me , then ? am I an executioner ? '

248468	248682	248459	248459	his	1301	' Colonel Valence sat down and took Ivor 's hand again . It was resting on the coverlet , for he had now been transferred to the chaplain 's bed . The case of Lady May proved less desperate . She had thrown herself into the deepest part of the lake , and would have been washed down by the current of the Guadalete — which was there running at a great speed — had not Ivor Mardol seized her as she rose the second time and carried her within a few yards of the shore . Thus she had escaped unhurt , while he , striking , as he last went down , on the sunken rocks , had received his deathblow . When the doctor came Lady May was sitting upright with her arms round her father 's neck , weeping and imploring his forgiveness . She told him it was a sudden frenzy for which she could not account that tempted her to stand on the edge of the boat when it drifted . The name of Hippolyta she kept in her bosom , nor did she inquire for Rupert . The doctor at once insisted on her lying down . He prescribed rest for several days and light nourishment . '
248688	248861	248459	248459	his	1301	' she asked . The doctor did not know his name ; and would not of course mention the dangerous state in which her preserver lay . Thus the evening closed in . None of the strangers returned to the Fonda d'Oro . Accommodation was found for them in the dismantled wing at San Lucar . But there was little sleep that night for any . Ivor , kept awake by intense pain , but scarcely conscious , refused to take the narcotic . He did not want to die yet ; such was his constant cry . There was so much to be done . He must have time . And by the mercy of Heaven time was given . The pain grew less towards morning . He slept without morphia , and passed a comparatively easy day . In the afternoon he sent for Hippolyta , who , fatigued with the horrible scenes through which she had gone , had been ordered by the Mother Superior to take a few hours '
248881	248888	248889	248889	he	5386	' My sister , my sister ! '
248903	248911	248912	248912	she	5386	' I am every one 's sister , '
248921	248929	248930	248930	He	5386	' Are you in less pain now ? '
248936	248949	248950	248950	he	5386	' You are not every one 's sister as you are mine , '
248972	248978	248979	248979	he	5386	' Tell her , father , '
248986	249000	248979	248979	he	5386	' she does not know . Why did n't you tell her yesterday ? '
249113	249134	249135	249135	He	671	' This is your brother , my dear . He is the son of my first wife , Alice Davenant . '

The Colonel had heard every word , smiling a little , a very little , but not interrupting . His eyes now met Hippolyta 's . She went over to him and kissed him . '
250996	251000	251003	251003	you	476	' she said , '
251068	251166	251167	251167	I	0	' Her thoughts turned to Rupert and Lady May , and she ended with a sigh . Then , recovering herself , she persuaded her brother to take some of the morphia prescribed . It soothed the pain ; it did not make him sleep . He would have continued talking , but she put her finger on her lip , and sat near him , and they were again in the sweet heaven where all that we love is restored . He turned his head on the pillow , and , looking at her , said , '
251222	251226	251227	251227	Dear	2772	' he stopped . '
251229	251233	251227	251227	Dear	2772	' she said , '
251271	251272	251262	251262	We	5491	' '
251280	251286	251275	251275	I	0	' was the simple answer ; '
251306	251315	251316	251316	I	0	' he went on , making an effort , '
251333	251374	251324	251324	May	575	' Hippolyta looked at him in complete surprise . Did he not know whom he had rescued ? She was afraid to reply . How to question him without giving him a shock ? It was a most unexpected difficulty . '
251384	251401	251375	251375	You	575	' he said , smiling . He liked to call her sister . She must speak . '
251411	251415	251405	251405	you	0	' she began . '
251420	251424	251405	251405	you	0	' he inquired . '
251431	251436	251437	251437	I	0	' she said hesitatingly . '

251623	251640	251645	251645	I	0	' she went on , with a meaning look which he somehow failed to make out . '
251647	251676	251645	251645	I	0	' He caught the look now , stopped , grasped Hippolyta 's hand tighter , and said , with a most innocent confusion , blushing like a girl , '

251693	251698	251690	251691	Lady May	575	' she whispered gently . '
251705	251709	251701	251701	God	276	' he said . '

251782	251868	251764	251764	I	0	' said his sister , pointing to Colonel Valence . Her heart was torn at the expectation of so near a calamity , but she dreaded even more for her father than herself . She knew what ardent passions were concealed under that imperturbable appearance of calm . It was lava beneath snow , and in a moment the surface might melt . But Colonel Valence , who sat a silent listener while Ivor gloried in death , now broke in upon their dangerous conversation . '
251880	251884	251875	251876	Lord Trelingham	243	' he said , '
251910	251915	251904	251904	Davenant	275	' he asked bitterly . '
251936	251945	251928	251928	I	0	' He controlled himself with a strong effort . '
251952	251956	251950	251950	Ivor	277	' he said ; '
251981	251982	251950	251950	Ivor	277	' '
251993	251997	251950	251950	Ivor	277	' said he ; '
252023	252088	252015	252015	you	5513	' His head fell on the pillow and he slept , breathing heavily at times and starting with pain , but with an expression of the most perfect happiness on lips and brow . Hippolyta watched him , her own lips moving occasionally in prayer . She thought of Electra in the touching story , who did the like office for a stricken brother . '
252095	252228	252229	252230	Miss Valence	367	' she said . For him there could be none . Was it so as regarded Rupert and the other poor thing , who had nearly cast away her life and had sacrificed Ivor 's ? The next morning brought Hippolyta a task which she would have deemed the most malignant stroke of destiny had she not learned , like her brother , to believe in God . As she came from the early mass , celebrated where San Lucar 's shrine had formerly stood , Tom Davenant , waiting in the cloister bareheaded , besought a moment 's audience . She had conventual duties to perform , but his speech was urgent , and she had leave to hear him . Taking her out on the terrace , he said abruptly , '
252444	252496	252432	252432	I	0	' This was the longest speech Tom had made in his life . To Hippolyta its import was overwhelming . She lost all sense of her situation . It was the suicide over again ; her own sin avenged on Rupert by Lady May. She stared at Tom Davenant without replying . '
252506	252515	252499	252499	you	5528	' said the kind - hearted young man ; '
252584	252585	252601	252602	Mr. Glanville	242	' '
252589	252593	252601	252602	Mr. Glanville	242	' said Hippolyta , '
252604	252616	252617	252617	He	242	' and she drew herself together as for a violent effort . '
252623	252627	252617	252617	He	242	' said Tom ; '
252635	252655	252629	252629	me	0	' He led her along the passages , up several flights of stairs , and into the disused wing . '
252660	252689	252629	252629	me	0	' he said , and made his way back to the terrace , leaving her tremulous and undecided before the door . She knocked . Rupert 's voice said '
252693	252780	252629	252629	me	0	' and she entered . He was sitting at a table , his head bent down , a picture of fatigue and misery . Since the accident , though he had eaten what was set before him , he seemed to have neither slept nor washed . He was haggard and forlorn,—a contrast indeed to the brilliant Rupert Glanville for whom nothing could be too refined , and no living too delicate . Hippolyta looked at him with unspeakable pity . He started on seeing her . '
252783	252787	252789	252789	May	575	' he cried , '
252809	252825	252789	252789	May	575	' and he laughed . The sound was like a knife driven into her side . '
252833	252837	252789	252789	May	575	' she exclaimed , '
252852	252853	252854	252854	I	0	' '
252857	252862	252854	252854	I	0	' he said grimly . '
252945	252977	252942	252942	I	0	' She could not understand that Rupert , Rupert Glanville , was saying such things Whither had the man vanished to whom she once gave herself ? This was not he . '
252984	253002	252942	252942	I	0	' she said , trembling . He laughed again , and struck his hand on the table . '
253011	253015	253018	253018	she	5540	' he cried , '
253142	253143	253144	253144	Rupert	242	' '
253146	253163	253144	253144	Rupert	242	' she said once more , in the gentlest tones she had ever used towards him , '
253168	253204	253144	253144	Rupert	242	' The subdued tenderness effected more than a torrent of eloquence would have done . He stopped in the midst of his wild words and fixed his eyes on Hippolyta 's grief - stained face . '
253209	253223	253205	253205	You	0	' he said more quietly . She put her hand to her heart . '
253230	253234	253235	253235	I	0	' she said , '
253401	253406	253395	253395	you	242	' she continued sorrowfully , '
253429	253514	253423	253423	you	242	' She could speak no more . But Rupert was coming to himself , and he began to see the character of the woman who , if she had sinned , was nobly repentant , in the divine light which shone round it . Rising from his seat with a sudden motion , and passing his hand over his forehead as though to brush away the illusions which had clouded his fancy , he said , taking her hand,—nor did she refuse it , — '
253540	253541	253534	253534	I	0	' '
253548	253825	253546	253546	me	0	' she said . And they went down to the river side . Several boats were lying there , into one of which Hippolyta entered , signing to Rupert that he should take the oars . He did so , not reluctantly , for he had now determined that he would obey , at all costs , whatever directions she should give . But a great wonder came upon him when she bade him row towards the Fonda d'Oro . He was not aware of Lady May 's departure . Tom Davenant , standing at an upper window , saw them push off from shore ; but , mindful of Hippolyta 's command , made no attempt to follow them . Rupert , pulling a silent stroke , thought of the one occasion , and one only , on which he had conveyed Hippolyta over a broad sheet of water like this , after their first meeting in the Hermitage . They had been as voiceless and recollected then , her eyes directed towards the bank , and eager to gain it . When they touched land , at the side of the hotel , he thought it was time to ask the reason of their crossing ; but she did not reply . She left him to fasten the boat ; put a question to the hotel - keeper who had come forth to welcome them , and , on hearing his answer , motioned Rupert to enter the house , which he did in the same state of amazement as before . She pushed a door open . It was the dining - room . '
253829	253833	253546	253546	me	0	' she said , '
253848	253849	253843	253843	I	0	' '
253855	253864	253865	253865	I	0	' he inquired . She shook her head . '
253870	253875	253865	253865	I	0	' was her answer ; '
253879	253961	253865	253865	I	0	' She went noiselessly upstairs . Again she was venturing a hazardous experiment . She tapped at Lady May 's door . There seemed to be no answer , but without hesitation she opened and went in . The woman she sought was lying on the coarse sofa which the place afforded as a couch , half - asleep , and sprang up at her entrance . When she saw Colonel Valence 's daughter , she pointed imperiously to the door . '
253970	253978	253979	253979	you	5552	' she said in her haughtiest tones ; '
253990	253991	253979	253979	you	5552	' '
254001	254017	253993	253993	I	0	' answered her visitor firmly , taking no offence at the rudeness of her reception . '
254037	254041	254042	254042	You	5552	' Hippolyta coloured . '
254047	254051	254042	254042	You	5552	' she said ; '
254064	254065	254059	254059	I	0	' '
254072	254076	254077	254077	You	5552	' exclaimed Lady May. '
254169	254288	254163	254163	Your	5557	' Shame burnt in her victim 's face , crimson , hectic . Hot tears rained from her eyes , and the heart of Hippolyta seemed almost broken as she sobbed aloud . Rupert 's step made itself audible in the room below . He could not help fancying that a quarrel was going on somewhere in the house , though he knew not where ; and it made him uneasy . He began to walk up and down . At the sound Hippolyta stilled her weeping . She was afraid he would come up . It was no time to think of herself . But she understood the character of Lady May , and she replied deliberately , '
254448	254449	254450	254451	Your brother	876	' '
254461	254563	254453	254453	I	0	' said Lady May , feeling unexpectedly weak where she had thought to be irresistible . It is the way with these proud natures . They must be attacked in front if you would conquer them . May Davenant was accustomed to follow her own will , to think every one weak compared with herself , and to take their compliance for granted . Even Rupert , since their marriage , had been as yielding as the rest . But Hippolyta had not studied her rival in vain . She knew that she must strike hard . And she went on , '
254618	254619	254612	254612	you	5558	' '
254626	254661	254623	254623	I	0	' replied May , with a strange feeling of perplexity , sitting down on the sofa from which she had risen . There was a soft expression in Hippolyta 's looks which troubled her . '
254667	254671	254672	254672	You	5558	' she repeated . '
254679	254685	254672	254672	You	5558	' said Ivor 's sister ; '
254733	254749	254727	254727	I	0	' her voice trembled , sank , and grew firm again , as she continued , '
254797	254867	254792	254792	I	0	' She was there , kneeling on the ground , an image of humble supplication . May did not know what to say or think . Was this the woman she had insulted ? She was overcome ; she had no argument left . Putting her arms round Hippolyta , with a burst of weeping , she whispered faintly , as she bent down her face to the other , '
254875	254876	254869	254869	he	6387	' '
254881	254896	254869	254869	he	6387	' answered the noble creature , making a supreme act of self - renunciation ; '
254939	254980	254936	254936	my	0	' She rose , but continued longer in the same strain , pleading as if for her own soul . The scales fell from May Davenant 's eyes ; and in the moment that she was humbled she saw light . '
254986	254992	254936	254936	my	0	' she said at last , '
255035	255036	255037	255037	He	242	' '
255041	255055	255037	255037	He	242	' replied Hippolyta in a soft whisper . Lady May flushed with delight . '
255063	255067	255059	255059	him	242	' she cried . '
255070	255077	255059	255059	him	242	' said Hippolyta , smiling mournfully , '
255101	255150	255097	255097	he	242	' She took Lady May by the hand . They descended the stairs with beating hearts , united , yet how different from one another ! When they reached the door of the dining - room Hippolyta opened it , and pushing Lady May gently forward , said , '
255162	255301	255097	255097	he	242	' She saw the door close , and grasping her crucifix tightly , went down to the boat . Lady May , on entering and seeing Rupert , threw herself into his arms . They held one another fast for a long while without speaking . It seemed as if a cloud had melted and left them face to face and soul to soul . As they stood in that silent embrace , the sound of plashing oars broke upon them . They looked out , still holding one another , and beheld the veiled figure in the boat , which one of the hotel servants was rowing to San Lucar . Hippolyta 's face was turned from them and her head bent . The great solemn light seemed to move with her . It was almost noon . '
255307	255329	255302	255302	She	5578	' said Rupert devoutly . And he told how she had come to him and brought him to the Fonda d'Oro . '
255339	255343	255330	255330	She	5578	' answered Lady May. '
255353	255354	255345	255345	she	5578	' '
255360	256139	255355	255355	She	5578	' he murmured . And his wife understood now what was meant by the feeling that transcended love , of which she had dreamt long ago in the picture - gallery at Trelingham . The love was her own . The something higher had been given to Hippolyta . They spent the evening in quiet , restored to one another . Lord Trelingham , exhausted by all he had gone through , and unable to comprehend his daughter 's abrupt changes of disposition , looked on , mildly thankful that husband and wife were again as he had seen them before coming to San Lucar . Late at night Tom Davenant came in . He had been informed of the reconciliation by Hippolyta , learning at the same time , to his great amaze , the relation in which they all stood to Ivor . He begged earnestly for admittance to his friend 's presence . He could not be refused ; and the meeting was another draught of happiness to the agonised patient , whose sufferings increased from hour to hour , but whose joy could not be diminished . Tom sat by him till the clock struck ten . He then bethought himself of the party at the Fonda d'Oro , who would be waiting for intelligence from the sick chamber ; and he rowed across in the moonlight . By that time Lord Trelingham had learnt nearly all that they could tell him of Ivor 's life and parentage . It was an utter surprise , but an equal pleasure . He was ready to love the young man , for whom he had conceived a high esteem at Trelingham ; and his daughter 's preserver could not be too near or too dear to him . The news which Tom brought of his sufferings threw a gloom over their lately - restored happiness . He left them , for he would not stay from Ivor a moment more than he could help . Lady May began to dread the Nemesis of her ill deeds which seemed to threaten ; her nerves were shattered by continual emotion ; she passed a feverish night , and could not rise next morning . It was Sunday . A cloudless tranquil sky overhead , the water rippling on the lake , the church bells sounding from Sepúlveda and San Lucar , the gardens and the cornfields rejoicing together , made a world in which sorrow might seem to have no place . Rupert tended Lady May with the exceeding gentleness he knew how to use ; Lord Trelingham came and went , said little , but was happy . Several times they cast anxious glances towards the convent . What was going on within its walls ? But the afternoon passed , and they had no tidings . Was their friend better ? Why did not Tom Davenant come ? Rupert and May knew well , though they could not whisper it , that Hippolyta would come no more . As the lovely sunset was flushing the waters and irradiating height and hollow , they saw a boat traversing the stream . When it touched , a messenger sprang out and ran up to them where they sat in the verandah . They must come at once . Ivor Mardol was dying . He looked up as they entered , knew them , and smiled , but could not speak . For many hours the pain had been intense ; and though drenched with narcotics , he lay wide awake and conscious . Now he was lying supported with pillows on the low bed , his head resting in Colonel Valence 's arms . It gave him a little relief to stay in this position . His father neither moved nor spoke , though on seeing Lord Trelingham a mist came over his eyes , and his lips quivered . Hippolyta , who was seated on the other side of the bed , came round and took the Earl 's hand ; she seemed not to observe the two that accompanied him . But when Lady May took the hand that was disengaged and pressed it warmly , she smiled without raising her eyes . Tom Davenant stood at the foot of the bed . He had a tired expression , not having slept the previous night and being more affected than he was aware at the sight of Ivor 's sufferings . The chaplain , Don Ramiro , was likewise in the room , but they scarcely observed his presence , and he did not come forward . '
256146	256150	255355	255355	She	5578	' said Ivor , '
256157	256163	255355	255355	She	5578	' Hippolyta moistened his lips . '
256170	256208	255355	255355	She	5578	' he went on , clenching his fingers like a man who is intent on some difficult task . The pillows were rearranged . It was slow work , for the least movement caused him exquisite agony . '
256216	256240	256241	256241	Father	476	' he said , and he smiled a little , fixing his gaze , which was bright and clear , on Colonel Valence . '
256243	256247	256241	256241	Father	476	' he continued , '
256262	256263	256241	256241	Father	476	' '
256270	256283	256241	256241	Father	476	' said his father ; and then , turning to the Earl , '
256372	256381	256405	256405	Alice	275	' Lord Trelingham put forth a trembling hand . '
256389	256393	256387	256387	Valence	274	' he said ; '
256420	256431	256405	256405	Alice	275	' Colonel Valence touched the hand held out to him . '
256437	256441	256405	256405	Alice	275	' he repeated , '
256470	256476	256467	256468	my boy	1796	' turning to his son . '
256482	256488	256478	256478	I	0	' was the contented answer . '
256510	256520	256478	256478	I	0	' A shade of sadness came over his countenance . '
256525	256535	256536	256536	I	0	' said Colonel Valence , stooping to kiss him . '
256544	256556	256536	256536	I	0	' The dying eyes , still bright , glanced towards Rupert . '
256561	256573	256558	256558	you	0	' said Ivor , trying not to seem over - agitated , '
256586	256594	256597	256597	Ivor	277	' Rupert looked at him in surprise . '
256599	256603	256597	256597	Ivor	277	' he said ; '
256608	256609	256610	256610	I	0	' '
256629	256642	256612	256612	father	5898	' The words were slow in coming . Colonel Valence was silent . '
256646	256651	256644	256644	me	0	' pleaded his son ; '
256661	256673	256674	256674	Ivor	277	' The others , except Rupert , thought he was wandering . '
256676	256692	256694	256694	you	277	' said the old man , with an evident struggle to keep down his feelings , '
256702	256703	256694	256694	you	277	' '
256718	256723	256712	256712	I	0	' answered his son ; '
256737	256766	256767	256767	You	5898	' His voice failed him . Again Hippolyta moistened his lips ; she stroked his cheek and smiled at him . The caress seemed to give him courage . '
256772	256793	256770	256770	father	5898	' he said , his strength returning as it sometimes will at the last , and his accents growing clear , '
256837	256838	256833	256833	you	5898	' '
256845	256850	256824	256824	He	277	' murmured his father , '
256890	256891	256901	256903	the old creed	5602	' '
256896	256900	256901	256903	the old creed	5602	' cried Ivor ; '
256947	256961	256967	256967	father	5898	' His face glowed , and he saw Lady May looking at him . '
257017	257018	257014	257014	Hippolyta	394	' '
257025	257037	257023	257023	father	5898	' she said tremulously . He looked long at them both . '
257041	257053	257038	257038	I	0	' he said , and the tears ran down his cheeks . '
257059	257066	257067	257067	I	0	' said Ivor , sinking back . '
257109	257172	257106	257107	Lady May	244	' She was weeping silently . He closed his eyes and lay still . They waited for the coming of death , voiceless , recollected , as when a great storm is gathering in the distance . Not a leaf stirred at the window ; the sunset light was streaming in . But there remained something else . He called Rupert faintly . '
257178	257182	257188	257188	You	250	' he said , '
257222	257230	257231	257231	May	244	' Rupert whispered assent . Another pause . '
257236	257252	257253	257253	May	244	' his voice murmured more faintly , and a smile lit up the darkling eyes . '
257259	257312	257253	257253	May	244	' The voice failed altogether . He was gone . A great calm lay on the dead face . · · · · · · They buried him outside the convent walls , in a sheltered nook by the stream . It was unconsecrated ground , and there was no burial service . '
257319	257341	257316	257317	a Christian	6052	' inquired Don Ramiro , when Hippolyta told him a little of their story , and asked what should be done . '
257347	257351	257316	257317	a Christian	6052	' she said . '
257361	257366	257316	257317	a Christian	6052	' replied the priest . '
257370	257437	257438	257438	She	5615	' she said absently . He thought she was grieving over it , and he added with the kindness which was a part of him — for he was a feeling man—'But you need not distress yourself so much ; all the land is consecrated ; wherever he lies will be holy ground ; it is la tierra de Maria Santisima , this Andalusia of ours . '
257622	257674	257617	257617	she	394	' You are leaving San Lucar , and I am setting out for India . We shall never meet again , until they come back to us'—she pointed towards the sheltered nook where the nightingales were singing , and the scattered rays of sunlight making their way in among the leaves . '
257678	257682	257617	257617	she	394	' she said . '
257698	257707	257695	257696	Annie Dauris	465	' He assented silently , and she continued , '
257791	258171	257779	257779	him	242	' She held out her hands to both of them , gave them one last look of farewell , and went out of the room . · · · · · · The new Earl of Trelingham does not live at the Court . It is shown to visitors , and the frescoes of the Great Hall have won universal admiration , and will hand down the artist 's name to a late posterity . But since their return to England Tom Davenant is much with Rupert and his cousin . I fancy he will sooner or later accept the devotion of the Countess Lutenieff , and that Karina 's one sincere and enduring affection will meet with its reward . Lady May is an artist 's wife , and seems to have forgotten that she was once an Earl 's daughter . She is happy . Rupert 's genius , chastened and glorified , promises to achieve greater things than ever ; but he has deep thoughts which he does not share with any one . Colonel Valence , reconciled to Lord Trelingham , returned after his death to Falside , and lives there a lonely man , but not altogether unhappy . He spends many hours near Lady Alice 's tomb in the gray old churchyard by the sea , and they bring him strange thoughts . Faith ? Ah no , he does not believe yet in divine realities , but in his ears the Percy motto , Espérance , seems often ringing . Hippolyta writes to him from the Far East , where she is fulfilling her vow . Looking in at Rupert 's studio one afternoon , the Duke of Adullam found him absorbed in Ivor 's diary , with the picture of Hippolyta lying before him . Charlie Dauris , seated at the farther end of the room , was drawing and did not look up or attend to the conversation which ensued . The Duke recognised Ivor 's handwriting . He asked about the portrait , and Rupert , who remembered the familiar interchange of thought which had passed between them on a certain evening , told him how both portrait and diary had been discovered in a desk at Grafton Place . '
258174	258186	257779	257779	him	242	' replied the Duke , with a peculiar expression of countenance , '
258246	258255	258221	258221	I	0	' Rupert smiled gravely and shook his head . '
258264	258268	258270	258270	you	5632	' he replied , '
258424	258434	258437	258438	the boy	864	' he went on , pointing across the studio , '
258450	258505	258443	258444	his mother	1582	' It was a lovely sketch , the cherub in the dawn of existence , glowing with infantine joy ; fair - haired , dark - eyed , rosy . He seemed to look out on the future as if it were a sunlit prospect , with hope and laughter on his murmuring lips . '
258508	258523	258443	258444	his mother	1582	' said the Duke , while he fixed his searching gaze on the picture ; '
258627	258628	258610	258610	I	0	' '
258634	258639	258641	258641	you	5644	' inquired the artist . '
258644	258667	258727	258728	the Duke	4320	' said the Duke of Adullam , his proud lips trembling a little and a slight blush over - spreading his features ; '
258695	258720	258727	258728	the Duke	4320	' A tender light came into Rupert 's eyes . The sound of a carriage was heard outside , and voices at the door . '
