106	125	126	127	the wife	108	“ He has been out since seven , and I do n’t think he ’s had a mouthful , ”
132	143	144	144	she	108	“ Oh , Harry , you must be half starved , ”
162	169	170	170	he	102	“ I ’m about whole melted , ”
178	264	170	170	he	102	“ In the name of charity give me a nobbler . I did get a bit of damper and a pannikin of tea up at the German ’s hut ; but I never was so hot or so thirsty in my life . We ’re going to have it in earnest this time . Old Bates says that when the gum leaves crackle , as they do now , before Christmas , there wo n’t be a blade of grass by the end of February . ”
265	271	273	274	the wife	108	“ I hate Old Bates , ”
276	288	273	274	the wife	108	“ He always prophesies evil , and complains about his rations . ”
289	304	306	307	her husband	116	“ He knows more about sheep than any man this side of the Mary , ”
1553	1557	1558	1558	he	149	“ By George ! ”
1561	1571	1558	1558	he	149	“ old fellow , you sha’n’t be a squatter . ”
1572	1578	1580	1581	his wife	104	“ Why not , Harry ? ”
1583	1600	1580	1581	his wife	104	“ Because I do n’t want him to break his heart every day of his life . ”
1601	1618	1558	1558	he	149	“ Are you always breaking yours ? I thought your heart was pretty well hardened now . ”
1619	1641	1580	1581	his wife	104	“ When a man talks of his heart , you and Kate are thinking of loves and doves , of course . ”
1642	1654	1656	1656	Kate	41	“ I was n’t thinking of loves and doves , Harry , ”
1658	1697	1656	1656	Kate	41	“ I was thinking how very hot it must have been to - day . We could only bear it in the veranda by keeping the blinds always wet . I do n’t wonder that you were troubled . ”
1698	1779	1580	1581	his wife	104	“ That comes from heaven or Providence , or from something that one knows to be unassailable , and therefore one can put up with it . Even if one gets a sun - stroke one does not complain . The sun has a right to be there , and is no interloper , like a free - selector . I ca n’t understand why free - selectors and mosquitoes should have been introduced into the arrangements of the world . ”
1780	1794	1806	1806	she	45	“ I s’pose the poor must live somewheres , and ‘ squiters too , ”
1817	1843	1806	1806	she	45	“ Now , Mr. Harry , if you ’re hungered , there ’s something for you to eat in spite of the free - selectors . ”
1844	1848	1850	1851	the master	193	“ Mrs. Growler , ”
1853	1864	1850	1851	the master	193	“ excuse me for saying that you jump to conclusions . ”
1865	1875	1877	1879	the old woman	194	“ My jumping is pretty well - nigh done , ”
1881	1966	1877	1879	the old woman	194	“ By no means . I find that old people can jump quite as briskly as young . You have rebuked me under the impression that I was grudging something to the poor . Let me explain to you that a free - selector may be , and very often is , a rich man . He whom I had in my mind is not a poor man , though I wo n’t swear but what he will be before a year is over . ”
1967	2015	1850	1851	the master	193	“ I know who you mean , Mr. Harry ; you mean the Medlicots . A very nice gentleman is Mr. Medlicot , and a very nice old lady is Mrs. Medlicot . And a deal of good they ’re going to do , by all accounts . ”
2016	2026	2028	2029	the wife	108	“ Now , Mrs. Growler , that will do , ”
2107	2116	2118	2119	his wife	104	“ I know you are tired to death , ”
2121	2132	2118	2119	his wife	104	“ when I see you eat your dinner like that . ”
2133	2159	2118	2119	his wife	104	“ It is n’t being tired , Mary ; I ’m not particularly tired . But I must be off again in about an hour . ”
2160	2167	2118	2119	his wife	104	“ Out again to - night ? ”
2168	2173	2118	2119	his wife	104	“ Yes , indeed . ”
2174	2178	2118	2119	his wife	104	“ On horseback ? ”
2179	2295	2118	2119	his wife	104	“ How else ? Old Bates and Mickey are in their saddles still . I do n’t want to have my fences burned as soon as they ’re put up . It ’s a ticklish thing to think that a spark of fire any where about the place might ruin me , and to know at the same time that every man about the run and every swagsman that passes along have matches in their pocket . There is n’t a pipe lighted on Gangoil this time of the year that might n’t make a beggar of you and me . That ’s another reason why I would n’t have the young un a squatter . ”
2296	2314	2316	2317	Kate Daly	41	“ — I declare I think that squatters have more trouble than any people in the world , ”
2319	2332	2334	2334	he	201	“ — Free - selectors have their own troubles too , Kate , ”
2448	2460	2461	2461	she	41	“ The Medlicots ’ troubles will never trouble me , Harry , ”
2464	2480	2461	2461	she	41	“ I hope not , Kate ; nor mine either more than we can help . ”
2481	2486	2488	2488	Mary	40	“ But they do , ”
2490	2502	2488	2488	Mary	40	“ They trouble me , and her too , very much . ”
2503	2519	2521	2521	Harry	65	“ A man ’s back should be broad enough to bear all that for himself , ”
2523	2550	2521	2521	Harry	65	“ I get ashamed of myself when I grumble , and yet one seems to be surly if one does n’t say what one ’s thinking . ”
2551	2566	2488	2488	Mary	40	“ I hope you ’ll always tell me what you ’re thinking , dear . ”
2567	2600	2488	2488	Mary	40	“ Well , I suppose I shall — till this fellow is old enough to be talked to , and to be made to bear the burden of his father ’s care . ”
2601	2625	2521	2521	Harry	65	“ By that time , Harry , you will have got rich , and we shall all be in England , sha’n’t we ? ”
2626	2682	2488	2488	Mary	40	“ I do n’t know about being rich , but we shall have been free - selected off Gangoil.—Now , Mrs. Growler , we ’ve done dinner , and I ’ll have a pipe before I make another start . Is Jacko in the kitchen ? Send him through to me on to the veranda . ”
2726	2730	2521	2521	Harry	65	“ bush life . ”
2752	2755	2521	2521	Harry	65	“ bush , ”

4165	4168	4192	4192	Harry	65	“ Shires . ”
4196	4208	4192	4192	Harry	65	“ cut their own bread - and - butter for themselves . ”
4637	4648	4650	4650	Jacko	51	“ The old woman says as you was wanting me ? ”
4652	4663	4650	4650	Jacko	51	“ Going to be fine to - night , Jacko ? ”
4679	4689	4690	4690	he	51	“ My word ! little squall a - coming , ”
4693	4704	4706	4707	the master	193	“ I wish it would come from ten thousand buckets , ”
4709	4715	4717	4717	Jacko	51	“ No buckets at all , ”
4719	4726	4717	4717	Jacko	51	“ Want the horses , master ? ”
4727	4757	4758	4758	Harry	65	“ Of course . I want the horses , and I want you to come with me . There are two horses saddled there ; I ’ll ride Hamlet . ”
4770	4774	4777	4777	her	104	“ old girl , ”
4804	4812	4814	4815	Kate Daly	41	“ It ’s as dark as pitch , ”
4817	4830	4814	4815	Kate Daly	41	“ That ’s because you have just come out of the light . ”
4831	4849	4851	4852	the wife	108	“ But it is dark — quite dark . You wo n’t be late , will you ? ”
4854	4876	4851	4852	the wife	108	“ I ca n’t be very early , as it ’s near ten now . I shall be back about twelve . ”
4901	4909	4910	4910	Kate	41	“ Why should he go out now ? ”
4916	4923	4910	4910	Kate	41	“ He is afraid of fire . ”
4924	4948	4913	4914	her sister	180	“ But he ca n’t prevent the fires by riding about in the dark . I suppose the fires come from the heat . ”
4949	4986	4910	4910	Kate	41	“ He thinks they come from enemies , and he has heard something . One wretched man may do so much when every thing is dried to tinder . I do so wish it would rain . ”
5126	5136	5137	5137	he	51	“ You can sit your horse jumping , Jacko ? ”
5140	5148	5150	5150	Jacko	51	“ My word ! jump like glory , ”
5224	5228	5230	5230	Jacko	51	“ My word ! ”
5239	5248	5230	5230	Jacko	51	“ who ever saw the like of that ? ”
5249	5264	5230	5230	Jacko	51	“ Why do n’t you sit in your saddle , you stupid young duffer ? ”
5265	5301	5230	5230	Jacko	51	“ Sit in my saddle ! Why do n’t he jump proper ? Well , you go on . I do n’t know that I ’m a duffer . Duffer , indeed ! My word ! ”
5477	5497	5471	5471	he	65	“ My word ! why do n’t you jump away , Mr. Harry ? Who ’s a duffer now ? ”
5498	5534	5535	5535	Jacko	51	“ Hold your tongue , or I ’ll put my whip across your back . Get down and help me pull a log away . The horses could n’t see where to put their feet . ”
5578	5590	5592	5592	Jacko	51	“ I thought you were making for the wool - shed , ”
5594	5605	5607	5607	Harry	37	“ We ’re eight miles beyond the wool - shed , ”
5681	5693	5694	5694	he	37	“ Hold the horses , Jacko , till I come back , ”
5780	5784	5788	5788	himself	51	“ My word ! ”
5790	5798	5788	5788	himself	51	“ it ’s easy done , anyway . ”
6073	6078	6079	6079	he	47	“ Who ’s that ? ”
6110	6115	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ Who are you ? ”
6123	6129	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ My name is Medlicot . ”
6130	6139	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ Oh , Mr. Medlicot , is it ? ”
6140	6165	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ Is that Mr. Heathcote ? Good - night , Mr. Heathcote . You are going about at a late hour of the night . ”
6166	6184	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ I have to go about early and late ; but I ai n’t later than you . ”
6185	6192	6194	6194	Medlicot	47	“ I ’m close at home , ”
6196	6209	6211	6211	Harry	37	“ I am , at any rate , on my own run , ”
6213	6223	6225	6226	the other	388	“ You mean to say that I am trespassing ? ”
6228	6240	6225	6226	the other	388	“ because I can very soon jump back over the fence . ”
6241	6272	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ I did n’t mean that at all , Mr. Medlicot ; any body is welcome on my run , night or day , who knows how to behave himself . ”
6273	6283	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ I hope I ’m included in that list . ”
6284	6324	6225	6226	the other	388	“ Just so ; of course . Considering the state that every thing is in , and all the damage that a fire would do , I rather wish that people would be a little more careful about smoking . ”
6325	6341	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ My canes , Mr. Heathcote , would burn quite as quickly as your grass . ”
6342	6379	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ It is not only the grass . I ’ve a hundred miles of fencing on the run which is as dry as tinder , not to talk of the station and the wool - shed . ”
6380	6391	6225	6226	the other	388	“ They sha’n’t suffer from my neglect , Mr. Heathcote . ”
6392	6472	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ You have men about who may n’t be so careful . The wind , such as it is , is coming right across from your place . If there were light enough , I could show you three or four patches where there has been fire within half a mile of this spot . There was a log burning there for two or three days , not long ago , which was lighted by one of our men . ”
6473	6499	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ That was a fortnight since . There was no heat then , and the men were boiling their kettle . I spoke about it . ”
6500	6556	6225	6226	the other	388	“ A log like that , Mr. Medlicot , will burn for weeks sometimes . I ’ll tell you fairly what I ’m afraid of . There ’s a man with you whom I turned out of the shed last shearing , and I think he might put a match down — not by accident . ”
6557	6590	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ You mean Nokes . As far as I know , he ’s a decent man . You would n’t have me not employ a man just because you had dismissed him ? ”
6591	6611	6117	6121	the man on the fence	387	“ Certainly not ; that is , I should n’t think of dictating to you about such a thing . ”
6612	6654	6225	6226	the other	388	“ Well , no , Mr. Heathcote , I suppose not . Nokes has got to earn his bread , though you did dismiss him . I do n’t know that he ’s not as honest a man as you or I. ”
6655	6704	6708	6708	he	389	“ If so , there ’s three of us very bad ; that ’s all , Mr. Medlicot . Good - night ; and if you ’ll trouble yourself to look after the ash of your tobacco it might be the saving of me and all I have . ”
6771	6790	6791	6791	he	47	“ I believe in his heart he thinks that I ’m going to set fire to his run , ”
6797	6885	6791	6791	he	47	“ And because he grows wool he thinks himself above every body in the colony . He occupies thousands of acres , and employs three or four men . I till about two hundred , and maintain thirty families . But he is such a pig that he ca n’t understand all that ; and he thinks that I must be something low because I ’ve bought with my own money a bit of land which never belonged to him , and which he could n’t use . ”
6933	6949	6929	6929	his	65	“ I would n’t swear that he would n’t do it himself , after all ; ”
7154	7158	7152	7152	he	65	“ a hand , ”
7187	7189	7152	7152	he	65	“ hands ”
7305	7315	7316	7316	Harry	65	“ Why should any one want to ruin me ? ”
7320	7331	7316	7316	Harry	65	“ Did I ever wrong a man of a shilling ? ”
7394	7405	7407	7408	the German	415	“ You like too much to be governor over all , ”
7432	7447	7449	7449	Harry	65	“ Somebody must be governor , or every thing would go to the devil , ”
7451	7466	7468	7469	the German	415	“ Dat ’s true — only fellows do n’t like be made feel it , ”
7471	7487	7468	7469	the German	415	“ Nokes , he was made feel it when you put him over de gate . ”
7505	7507	7493	7494	the German	60	“ hands ”
7584	7589	7591	7591	he	51	“ You young monkey , ”
7593	7600	7591	7591	he	51	“ have you been using matches ? ”
7601	7621	7653	7653	Jacko	51	“ Why not , Mr. Harry ? Do n’t the grass burn ready , Mr. Harry ? My word ! ”
7638	7646	7647	7647	Harry	37	“ Was it so when we came ? ”
7686	7694	7671	7671	his	51	“ You dropped the match by accident ? ”
7695	7720	7721	7721	Harry	37	“ My word ! no . Did it o ’ purpose to see . It ’s all just one as gunpowder , Mr. Harry . ”
8039	8043	8037	8037	Harry	65	“ ten thousand buckets ”
8053	8063	8065	8065	Jacko	51	“ God A’mighty has put out the fires now , ”
8095	8098	8099	8099	he	65	“ Yes , ”
8102	8149	8099	8099	he	65	“ we may go to bed for a week , and let the grass grow , and the creeks fill , and the earth cool . Half an hour like this over the whole run , and there wo n’t be a dry stick on it . ”
8184	8195	8099	8099	he	65	“ We might have too much of this , Jacko . ”
8196	8202	8099	8099	he	65	“ My word ! yes . ”
8203	8215	8099	8099	he	65	“ I do n’t want to have the Mary flooded again . ”
8216	8222	8099	8099	he	65	“ My word ! no . ”
8450	8458	8460	8460	Jacko	51	“ By Jimini ! what ’s that ? ”
8462	8469	8470	8470	Jacko	51	“ Did you hear any thing ? ”
8638	8647	8648	8648	he	65	“ I knew there was a fellow about , ”
8651	8664	8648	8648	he	65	“ one of our own men would not have run like that . ”
8675	8698	8699	8699	Jacko	51	“ He has got in here for shelter out of the rain , but he was doing no good about the place . ”
8705	8712	8702	8702	his	51	“ I wonder who he was ? ”
8722	8726	8713	8713	Jacko	51	“ Bill Nokes . ”
8727	8734	8699	8699	Jacko	51	“ You could n’t see him . ”
8735	8743	8713	8713	Jacko	51	“ Seed the drag of his leg . ”
8768	8787	8750	8752	the man Nokes	452	“ I do n’t think you could have been sure of him by such a glimpse as that . ”
8788	8792	8794	8795	the boy	375	“ Maybe not , ”
8797	8805	8794	8795	the boy	375	“ only I ’m sure as sure . ”
8856	8859	8861	8861	Harry	65	“ Wet ! ”
8863	8901	8861	8861	Harry	65	“ if you could only know how much I prefer things being wet to dry just at present ! But give Jacko some supper . I must keep that young fellow in good humor if I can . ”
9346	9352	9353	9353	she	42	“ It is n’t Christian , ”
9356	9378	9353	9353	she	42	“ for people living out in the bush as we are to quarrel with their neighbors just because they are neighbors . ”
9379	9382	9384	9384	Harry	65	“ Neighbors ! ”
9386	9434	9384	9384	Harry	65	“ I do n’t know any word that there ’s so much humbug about . The Samaritan was the best neighbor I ever heard of , and he lived a long way off , I take it . Anyway , he was n’t a free - selector . ”
9435	9442	9353	9353	she	42	“ Harry , that ’s profane . ”
9443	9473	9353	9353	she	42	“ Every thing I say is wicked . You can go , of course , if you like it . I do n’t want to quarrel with any body . ”
9474	9480	9482	9483	his wife	104	“ Quarreling is so uncomfortable , ”
9485	9539	9482	9483	his wife	104	“ That ’s a matter of taste . There are people whom I find it very comfortable to quarrel with . I should n’t at all like not to quarrel with the Brownbies , and I ’m not at all sure it may n’t come to be the same with Mr. Giles Medlicot . ”
9540	9553	9353	9353	she	42	“ The Brownbies live by sheep - stealing and horse - stealing . ”
9554	9594	9482	9483	his wife	104	“ And Medlicot means to live by employing sheep - stealers and horse - stealers . You can go if you like it . You wo n’t want me to go with you . Will you have the baggy ? ”
10281	10286	10288	10288	Harry	65	“ Upon my word , ”
10290	10333	10288	10288	Harry	65	“ I sometimes think that friendship is more so . I suppose I ’m fitted for bush life , for I want to see no one from year ’s end to year ’s end but my own family and my own people . ”
10494	10511	10512	10512	she	524	“ This is gey kind of you to run so far to see an auld woman , ”
10536	10548	10549	10549	she	524	“ You ’re two bright lassies , and you ’re hearty , ”
10552	10591	10549	10549	she	524	“ I ’m auld , and just out of Cumberland , and I find it ’s hot enough — and I ’m no guid at horseback at all . I dinna know how I ’m to get aboot . ”
10611	10636	10593	10594	Mrs. Heathcote	42	“ Giles is aye telling me that I ’m to gang aboot in a bouggey , but I dinna feel sure of thae bouggeys . ”
10705	10714	10715	10715	she	524	“ Did ye ever see rain like that ! ”
10723	10740	10715	10715	she	524	“ I thought the Lord was sending his clouds down upon us in a lump like . ”
11110	11129	11131	11132	his mother	488	“ The leddies from Gangoil , Giles , have been guid enough to ride over and see me , ”
11176	11187	11188	11188	he	47	“ Mr. Heathcote must have been very wet last night , ”
11210	11224	11188	11188	he	47	“ Indeed he was — wet to the skin . Were you not ? ”
11225	11268	11200	11200	himself	47	“ I saw him at about eleven , before the rain began . I was close home , and just escaped . He must have been under it all . Does he often go about the run in that way at night ? ”
11269	11278	11280	11280	Kate	41	“ Only when he ’s afraid of fires , ”
11282	11310	11280	11280	Kate	41	“ Is there much to be afraid of ? I do n’t suppose that any body can be so wicked as to wish to burn the grass . ”
11320	11350	11312	11313	the ladies	471	“ The fires might be caused from negligence or trifling accidents , or might possibly come from the unaided heat of the sun ; or there might be enemies . ”
11351	11361	11363	11363	Jacko	51	“ My word ! yes ; enemies , rather ! ”
11407	11412	11414	11414	Jacko	51	“ Free - selectors , ”
11416	11424	11426	11426	Medlicot	47	“ I ’m a free - selector , ”
11428	11435	11437	11437	Jacko	51	“ Did not jist mean you , ”
11439	11449	11451	11452	Mrs. Heathcote	42	“ Jacko , you ’d better hold your tongue , ”
11454	11468	11451	11452	Mrs. Heathcote	42	“ Hold my tongue ! My word ! Well , you go on . ”
11619	11628	11630	11630	Kate	41	“ You ’ll never find your way back , ”
11632	11641	11630	11630	Kate	41	“ if you ’ve not been here before . ”
11642	11659	11692	11692	Heathcote	42	“ I never was here before , and I suppose I must find my way back . ”
11777	11796	11797	11797	he	47	“ I ’m not such a bad bushman but what I can find my way to the river , ”
11800	11805	11807	11807	Jacko	51	“ Find it blindful , ”
11911	11966	11883	11883	He	65	“ We have been very jolly , have n’t we , Kate ? Of course it has been hot , but every thing is not so frightfully parched as it was before the rain . As Mr. Medlicot has come back so far with us , we want him to come on and dine . ”
11967	11974	11976	11976	Harry	65	“ Pray do , Mr. Medlicot , ”
11997	12022	12030	12030	his	65	“ Thanks , no : I think I ’ll hardly do that.—Good - night , Mrs. Heathcote ; good - night . Miss Daly ; ”
12048	12058	12060	12060	Heathcote	42	“ I am very glad he has gone back , ”
12062	12096	12060	12060	Heathcote	42	“ Why do you say so , Harry ? You are not given to be inhospitable , and why should you grudge me and Kate the rare pleasure of seeing a strange face ? ”
12097	12141	12184	12184	Harry	65	“ I ’ll tell you why . It ’s not about him at this moment ; but I ’ve been disturbed.—Jacko , go on to the station , and say we ’re coming . Do you hear me ? Go on at once . ”
12154	12164	12165	12165	He	51	“ Get off your horses , and come in . ”
12269	12279	12281	12281	Harry	65	“ The fellow who did that was an ass , ”
12283	12339	12281	12281	Harry	65	“ a greater ass than I should have taken him to be , not to have known that if he could have gotten the grass to burn outside , the wool - shed must have gone without all that preparation . But there is n’t much difficulty now in seeing what the fellow has intended . ”
12340	12347	12349	12349	Kate	41	“ Was it for a fire ? ”
12351	12412	12349	12349	Kate	41	“ Of course it was . He would n’t have been contented with the grass and fences , but wanted to make sure of the shed also . He ’d have come to the house and burned us in our beds , only a fellow like that is too much of a coward to run the risk of being seen . ”
12413	12430	12432	12433	Mrs. Heathcote	42	“ But , Harry , why did n’t he light it when he ’d done it ? ”
12435	12447	12449	12449	Harry	65	“ Because the Almighty sent the rain at the very moment , ”
12464	12485	12449	12449	Harry	65	“ I ’m not much given to talk about Providence , but this looks like it , does it not ? ”
12486	12498	12349	12349	Kate	41	“ He might have put a match in at the moment ? ”
12499	12567	12349	12349	Kate	41	“ Rain or no rain ? Yes , he might . But he was interrupted by more than the rain . I got into the shed myself just at the moment — I and Jacko . It was last night , when the rain was pouring . I heard the man , and dark as was the night , I saw his figure as he fled away . ”
12568	12575	12577	12578	Miss Daly	66	“ You did n’t know him ? ”
12580	12597	12577	12578	Miss Daly	66	“ But that boy , who has the eyes of a cat , he knew him . ”
12598	12601	12349	12349	Kate	41	“ Jacko ? ”
12602	12642	12349	12349	Kate	41	“ Jacko knew him by his gait . I should have hardly wanted any one to tell me who it was . I could have named the man at once , but for the fear of doing an injustice . ”
12643	12649	12349	12349	Kate	41	“ And who was it ? ”
12650	12701	12349	12349	Kate	41	“ Our friend Medlicot ’s prime favorite and new factotum , Mr. William Nokes . Mr. William Nokes is the gentleman who intends to burn us all out of house and home , and Mr. Medlicot is the gentleman whose pleasure it is to keep Mr. Nokes in the neighborhood . ”
12725	12732	12733	12733	she	108	“ That may be all true , ”
12736	12762	12733	12733	she	108	“ Perhaps it is as you say about that man . But you would not therefore think that Mr. Medlicot knows any thing about it ? ”
12763	12769	12771	12771	Kate	41	“ It would be impossible , ”
12773	12780	12782	12782	Harry	65	“ I have not accused him , ”
12784	12808	12782	12782	Harry	65	“ but he knows that the man was dismissed , and yet keeps him about the place . Of course he is responsible . ”
13138	13148	13150	13151	Mrs. Heathcote	42	“ Ought we not to have dispersed the heap ? ”
13175	13184	13186	13186	Harry	65	“ I ’ll leave it as it is , ”
13212	13232	13195	13195	He	65	“ Come , let ’s get on ; you ’ll want your dinner , and it ’s getting dark . ”
13599	13608	13609	13610	his wife	104	“ Speak a word to me about it , ”
13625	13666	13609	13610	his wife	104	“ My darling , if there were a word to say , I would say it . I must be on the watch , and do the best I can . At present the earth is too damp for mischief . ”
13667	13675	13609	13610	his wife	104	“ Oh that it would rain again ! ”
13676	13734	13609	13610	his wife	104	“ There will be heat enough before the summer is over ; we need not doubt that . But I will tell you of every thing as we go on . I will endeavor to have the man watched . God bless you ! Go to sleep , and try to get it out of your thoughts . ”
13998	14003	14005	14005	Harry	65	“ Well , Nokes , ”
14007	14019	14005	14005	Harry	65	“ how are you getting on ? Is Mr. Medlicot here ? ”
14175	14214	14215	14215	Picky	68	“ I ’m pretty well , thank ye , Mr. Heathcote . I hope you ’re the same , and the ladies . The master ’s about somewhere , I take it.—Picky , go and find the master . ”
14230	14242	14244	14244	Harry	65	“ Have you been over to Gangoil since you left it ? ”
14254	14297	14244	14244	Harry	65	“ Not I , Mr. Heathcote . I never go where I ’ve had words . And , to tell you the truth , sugar is better than sheep . I ’m very comfortable here , and I never liked your work . ”
14298	14309	14244	14244	Harry	65	“ You have n’t been at the wool - shed ? ”
14310	14337	14244	14244	Harry	65	“ What , the Gangoil shed ! What the blazes ‘ d I go there for ? It ’s a matter of ten miles from here . ”
14338	14343	14244	14244	Harry	65	“ Seven , Nokes . ”
14344	14401	14244	14244	Harry	65	“ Seven , is it ? It is a longish seven miles , Mr. Heathcote . How could I get that distance ? I ai n’t so good at walking as I was before I was hurt . You should have remembered that , Mr. Heathcote , when you laid hands on me the other day . ”
14402	14438	14244	14244	Harry	65	“ You ’re not much the worse for what I did ; nor yet for the accident , I take it . At any rate , you ’ve not been at Gangoil wool - shed ? ”
14439	14446	14448	14449	the man	451	“ No , I ’ve not , ”
14453	14469	14448	14449	the man	451	“ What the mischief should I be doing at your shed at night - time ? ”
14470	14479	14244	14244	Harry	65	“ I said nothing about night - time . ”
14480	14524	14448	14449	the man	451	“ I ’m here all day , ai n’t I ? If you ’re going to palm off any story against me , Mr. Heathcote , you ’ll find yourself in the wrong box . What I does I does on the square . ”
14695	14701	14703	14703	Nokes	58	“ There ’s the master , ”
14705	14726	14703	14703	Nokes	58	“ If you ’ve got any thing to say about any thing , you ’d better say it to him . ”
14813	14825	14826	14826	he	65	“ You ’ve a deal of machinery here , Mr. Medlicot , ”
14829	14839	14841	14842	the other	388	“ It ’s a small affair , after all , ”
14844	14857	14841	14842	the other	388	“ I hope to get a good plant before I ’ve done . ”
14858	14867	14841	14842	the other	388	“ Can I speak a word with you ? ”
14868	14887	14888	14888	Harry	65	“ Certainly . Will you come into the office , or will you go across to the house ? ”
14914	14934	14888	14888	Harry	65	“ Not much of an office , is it ? What can I do for you , Mr. Heathcote ? ”
15123	15132	15134	15134	Medlicot	47	“ Do you want me to dismiss him ? ”
15154	15162	15134	15134	Medlicot	47	“ You have n’t heard me yet . ”
15209	15216	15218	15218	Medlicot	47	“ I can believe it all , ”
15220	15272	15218	15218	Medlicot	47	“ and am very sorry that it should be so . But I can not see the justice of punishing a man on the merest , vaguest suspicion . Your only ground for imputing this crime to him is that your own conduct to him may have given him a motive . ”
15296	15305	15306	15306	he	65	“ I was going on to tell you , ”
15309	15323	15306	15306	he	65	“ what occurred that night after I saw you up by the fence . ”
15411	15420	15396	15396	Nokes	58	“ Is he the boy you call Jacko ? ”
15421	15430	15362	15362	Nokes	58	“ That ’s the name he goes by . ”
15431	15440	15396	15396	Nokes	58	“ You do n’t know his real name ? ”
15441	15450	15396	15396	Nokes	58	“ I have never heard any other name . ”
15451	15458	15362	15362	Nokes	58	“ Nor any thing about him ? ”
15512	15520	15522	15522	Medlicot	47	“ You admit it was quite dark , ”
15545	15559	15536	15536	his	65	“ I told you that I saw myself the figure of a man . ”
15560	15585	15586	15587	Harry Heathcote	65	“ But that you barely saw a figure . You did not form any opinion of your own as to the man ’s identity . ”
15621	15663	15536	15536	his	65	“ Certainly not . I barely saw a glimpse of a figure , and , till I spoke to Nokes just now , I almost doubted whether the lad could have distinguished him . I am sure he was right now . ”
15664	15751	15536	15536	his	65	“ Really , Mr. Heathcote , I ca n’t go along with you . You are accusing a man of committing an offense , which I believe is capital , on the evidence of a boy of whom you know nothing , who may have his own reasons for spiting the man , and whom you yourself did not believe till you had looked this man in the face . I think you allow yourself to be guided too much by your own power of intuition . ”
15752	15759	15761	15761	Harry	65	“ No , I do n’t , ”
15771	15820	15761	15761	Harry	65	“ At any rate , I ca n’t consent to take a man ’s bread out of his mouth , and to send him away tainted as he would be with this suspicion , either because Jacko thought that he saw him in the dark , or because — ”
15821	15832	15536	15536	his	65	“ I have never asked you to send him away . ”
15833	15842	15536	15536	his	65	“ What is it you want , then ? ”
15843	15870	15761	15761	Harry	65	“ I want to have him watched , so that he may feel that if he attempts to destroy my property his guilt will be detected . ”
15871	15878	15536	15536	his	65	“ Who is to watch him ? ”
15879	15886	15536	15536	his	65	“ He is in your employment . ”
15887	15912	15761	15761	Harry	65	“ He lives in the hut down beyond the gate . Am I to keep a sentry there all night , and every night ? ”
15913	15920	15536	15536	his	65	“ I will pay for it . ”
15921	16050	15536	15536	his	65	“ No , Mr. Heathcote . I do n’t pretend to know this country yet , but I ’ll encourage no such espionage as that . At any rate , it is not English . I dare say the man misbehaved himself in your employment . You say he was drunk . I do not doubt it . But he is not a drunkard , for he never drinks here . A man is not to starve forever because he once got drunk and was impertinent . Nor is he to have a spy at his heels because a boy whom nobody knows chooses to denounce him . I am sorry that you should be in trouble , but I do not know that I can help you . ”
16291	16296	16298	16298	Harry	65	“ Good - morning , ”
16607	16616	16617	16617	he	47	“ Do the squatters suffer much from fires ? ”
16620	16630	16632	16633	the man	451	“ Heathcote has been talking to you about that , ”
16635	16654	16632	16633	the man	451	“ Ca n’t you say Mr. Heathcote when you speak of a gentleman whose bread you have eaten ? ”
16655	16690	16599	16599	he	47	“ Mr. Heathcote , if you like it . We ai n’t particular to a shade out here as you are at home . He has been telling you about fires , has he ? ”
16691	16697	16599	16599	he	47	“ Well , he has . ”
16698	16707	16632	16633	the man	451	“ And talking of me , I suppose ? ”
16708	16736	16599	16599	he	47	“ You were talking of having a turn at mining some day . How would it be with you if you were to be off to Gympie ? ”
16737	16750	16599	16599	he	47	“ You mean to say I ’m to go , Mr. Medlicot ? ”
16751	16760	16632	16633	the man	451	“ I do n’t say that at all . ”
16761	16840	16599	16599	he	47	“ Look here , Mr. Medlicot . My going or staying wo n’t make any difference to Heathcote . There ’s a lot of ’em about here hates him that much that he is never to be allowed to rest in peace . I tell you that fairly . It ai n’t any thing as I shall do . Them ’s not my ways , Mr. Medlicot . But he has enemies here as’ll never let him rest . ”
16841	16846	16599	16599	he	47	“ Who are they ? ”
16847	16870	16632	16633	the man	451	“ Pretty nigh every body round . He has carried himself that high they wo n’t stand him . Who ’s Heathcote ? ”
16871	16879	16632	16633	the man	451	“ Name some who are his enemies . ”
16880	16886	16599	16599	he	47	“ There ’s the Brownbies . ”
16887	16904	16632	16633	the man	451	“ Oh , the Brownbies . Well , it ’s a bad thing to have enemies . ”
17148	17154	17155	17155	Harry	65	“ What brought him here ? ”
17202	17207	17209	17209	Harry	65	“ Confound his hypocrisy ! ”
17213	17223	17225	17226	the wife	108	“ I do n’t think he ’s a hypocrite , ”
17228	17236	17238	17239	Kate Daly	41	“ I ’m sure he ’s not , ”
18086	18094	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ You ’re late , Mr. Bates , ”
18098	18110	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ you take too much out of yourself this hot weather . ”
18111	18143	18145	18146	Mr. Bates	71	“ I ’ve got to move slower , Mr. Heathcote , as I grow older . That ’s about it . And the beast I ’m on is not much good . ”
18169	18184	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ If you do n’t like him , why do n’t you take another ? ”
18185	18233	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ There ai n’t much difference in ’em , Mr. Heathcote . Better the devil you know than the devil you do n’t . It ’s getting uncommon close shaving for them wethers in the new paddock . They ’re down upon the roots pretty well already . ”
18234	18246	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ There ’s grass along the bush on the north side . ”
18247	18323	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ They wo n’t go there ; it ’s rank and sour . They wo n’t feed up there as long as they can live lower down and nearer the water . Weather like this , they ’d sooner die near the water than travel to fill their bellies . It ’s about the hottest day we ’ve had , and the nights a’most hotter . Are you going to be out , Mr. Heathcote ? ”
18324	18329	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ I think so . ”
18330	18366	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ What ’s the good of it , Mr. Heathcote ? There is no use in it . Lord love you , what can yon do ? You ca n’t be every side at once . ”
18367	18379	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ Fire can only travel with the wind , Mr. Bates . ”
18380	18433	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ And there is n’t any wind , and so there ca n’t be any fire . I never did think , and I do n’t think now , there ever was any use in a man fashing himself as you fash yourself . You ca n’t alter things , Mr. Heathcote . ”
18434	18500	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ But that ’s just what I can do — what a man has to do . If a match were thrown there at your feet , and the grass was aflame , could n’t you alter that by putting your foot on it ? If you find a ewe on her back , ca n’t you alter that by putting her on her legs ? ”
18501	18512	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ Yes , I can do that , I suppose . ”
18513	18541	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ What does a man live for except to alter things ? When a man clears the forest and sows corn , does he not alter things ? ”
18542	18552	18554	18557	the cunning old man	764	“ That ’s not your line , Mr. Heathcote , ”
18559	18571	18554	18557	the cunning old man	764	“ If I send wool to market , I alter things . ”
18572	18595	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ You ’ll excuse me , Mr. Heathcote . Of course I ’m old , but I just give you my experience . ”
18596	18637	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ I ’m much obliged to you ; though we ca n’t always agree , you know . Good - night . Go in and say a word to my wife , and tell them you saw me all right . ”
18638	18655	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ I ’ll have a crack with ’em , Mr. Heathcote , before I turn in . ”
18656	18665	18096	18096	Harry	65	“ And tell Mary I sent my love . ”
18666	18676	18677	18677	He	765	“ I will , Mr. Heathcote ; I will . ”
19069	19072	19074	19075	the squatter	503	“ Bos , ”
19092	19103	19074	19075	the squatter	503	“ I thought you were watching at Brownbie ’s boundary ? ”
19121	19137	19104	19104	Boscobel	53	“ You are drawing three shillings a night for watching ; is n’t that so ? ”
19138	19152	19074	19075	the squatter	503	“ Yes , that ’s so . Anyways , I shall draw it . ”
19153	19161	19074	19075	the squatter	503	“ Then why ai n’t you watching ? ”
19162	19177	19104	19104	Boscobel	53	“ There ’s nothing to watch that I knows on — not just now . ”
19178	19202	19104	19104	Boscobel	53	“ Then why should I pay you for it ? I ’m to pay you for ringing these trees , ai n’t I ? ”
19203	19209	19074	19075	the squatter	503	“ Certainly , Mr. Heathcote . ”
19210	19258	19104	19104	Boscobel	53	“ Then you ’re to make double use of your time , and sell it twice over , are you ? Do n’t try to look like a fool , as though you did n’t understand . You know that what you ’re doing is n’t honest . ”
19259	19270	19104	19104	Boscobel	53	“ Nobody ever said as I was n’t honest before . ”
19271	19300	19074	19075	the squatter	503	“ I tell you so now . You ’re robbing me of the time you ’ve sold to me , and for which I ’m to pay you . ”
19301	19329	19104	19104	Boscobel	53	“ There ai n’t nothing to watch while the wind ’s as it is now , and that chap ai n’t any where about to - night . ”
19330	19334	19104	19104	Boscobel	53	“ What chap ? ”
19335	19366	19074	19075	the squatter	503	“ Oh , I know . I ’m all right . What ’s the use of dawdling about up there in the broad moonlight , and the wind like this ? ”
19367	19419	19104	19104	Boscobel	53	“ That ’s for me to judge . If you engage to do my work and take my money , you ’re swindling me when you go about another job as you are now . You need n’t scratch your head . You understand it all as well as I do . ”
19420	19482	19074	19075	the squatter	503	“ I never was told I swindled before , and I ai n’t a - going to put up with it . You may ring your own trees , and watch your own fences , and the whole place may be burned for me . I ai n’t a - going to do another turn in Gangoil . Swindle , indeed ! ”
19920	19924	19901	19902	another enemy	795	“ that chap , ”
20086	20111	20077	20077	he	57	“ If fires must come , they will come ; and if they are not to come , you are simply losing your labor . ”
20235	20243	20224	20224	he	38	“ Let there be no steps backward . ”
20397	20408	20409	20409	he	38	“ There ’s been no one about , I suppose ? ”
20412	20417	20419	20420	the man	451	“ Not a one , ”
20422	20432	20419	20420	the man	451	“ You ’ve been across on Brownbie ’s run ? ”
20433	20444	20445	20445	They	816	“ We ’re on it now , Mr. ‘ Eathcote . ”
20459	20497	20445	20445	They	816	“ I do n’t know how that is , Karl . I think Gangoil goes a quarter of a mile beyond this . But we did not quite strike the boundary when we put up the fence . ”
20498	20534	20419	20420	the man	451	“ Brownbie ’s cattle is allays here , Mr. ‘ Eathcote , and is knocking down the fence every day . Brownbie is a rascal , and ‘ is cattle as bad as ‘ isself . ”
20535	20569	20445	20445	They	816	“ Never mind that , Karl , now . When we ’ve got through the heats , we ’ll put a mile or two of better fencing along here . You know Boscobel ? ”
20570	20577	20445	20445	They	816	“ In course I know Bos . ”
20578	20587	20419	20420	the man	451	“ What sort of a fellow is he ? ”
20606	20618	20620	20620	Karl	59	“ He ’s in and in wid all them young Brownbies , ”
20622	20644	20646	20646	Harry	65	“ The Brownbies are a bad lot , but I do n’t think they ’d do any thing of this kind , ”
20659	20668	20646	20646	Harry	65	“ They likes muttons , Mr. ‘ Eathcote . ”
20669	20694	20734	20735	the man	451	“ I suppose they do take a sheep or two now and then . They would n’t do worse than that , would they ? ”
20695	20708	20710	20710	Karl	59	“ Not’ing too ‘ ot for ’em ; not’ing too ‘ eavy , ”
20716	20732	20710	20710	Karl	59	“ The vind , vat there is , comes just here , Mr. ‘ Eathcote . ”
20752	20762	20734	20735	the man	451	“ And you do n’t think much of Boscobel ? ”
20769	20777	20779	20779	Harry	65	“ He was always well treated here , ”
20781	20805	20779	20779	Harry	65	“ and has had plenty of work , and earned large wages . The man will be a fool to quarrel with me . ”
20876	20886	20887	20887	he	65	“ Did Bates tell you he ’d met me ? ”
20892	20930	20887	20887	he	65	“ Yes , Harry ; kiss me , Harry . I was so glad you sent a word . Promise me , Harry , not to think that I do n’t agree with you in every thing . ”

I ’ll be even with him some of these days ! He had the impudence to send a man of his up here last week looking for sheep - skins . ”
22985	23037	23038	23040	The old man	763	“ He was n’t that soft , Mr. Jerry , was he ? Well , I ’ve dropped working for him.—How are you , Mr. Brownbie ? I hope I see you finely , Sir . It ’s stiffish sort of weather , Mr. Brownbie , ai n’t it , Sir ? ”
23054	23083	23084	23085	Old Brownbie	74	“ I ’ll just hang about for the day , Mr. Brownbie , and get a little grub . You never begrudged a working - man that yet . ”
23113	23119	23121	23121	Boscobel	53	“ No , Mr. Jerry , ”
23123	23131	23121	23121	Boscobel	53	“ I ’ve done with that fellow . ”
23132	23141	23038	23040	The old man	763	“ And so has Nokes done with him . ”
23142	23160	23121	23121	Boscobel	53	“ Nokes is at work on Medlicot ’s Mill . That sugar business would n’t suit me . ”
23161	23176	23121	23121	Boscobel	53	“ An axe in your hand is what you ’re fit for , Bos . ”
23177	23242	23038	23040	The old man	763	“ There ’s a many things I can turn my hand to , Mr. Jerry . You could n’t give a fellow such a thing as a nobbler , Mr. Jerry , could you ? I ’d offer money for it , only I know it would be taken amiss . It ’s that hot that a fellow ’s very in’ards get parched up . ”
23294	23299	23301	23303	the old man	763	“ Come , Jerry , ”
23311	23327	23301	23303	the old man	763	“ you might as well give us a drop , as it ’s going about . ”
23365	23380	23382	23382	Jerry	82	“ Heathcote ’s in an awful state about them fires , ai n’t he ? ”
23405	23419	23421	23421	Jerry	82	“ I wish he was clean burned out — over head and ears , ”
23439	23450	23452	23452	Jerry	82	“ If he treated me like he does you fellows , ”
23454	23533	23452	23452	Jerry	82	“ he should n’t have a yard of fencing or a blade of grass left — nor a ewe , nor a lamb , nor a hogget . I do hate fellows who come here and want to be better than any one about ’em — young chaps especially . Sending up here to look for sheep - skins , cuss his impudence ! I sent that German fellow of his away with a flea in his ear . ”

23539	23548	23452	23452	Jerry	82	“ It ’s some such name as that . ”
23549	23560	23562	23562	Boscobel	53	“ He ’s all in all with the young squire , ”
23564	23627	23562	23562	Boscobel	53	“ And there ’s a chap there called Jacko — he ’s another . He gets ’em down there to Gangoil , and the ladies talks to ’em , and then they ’d go through fire and water for him . There ’s Mickey — he ’s another , jist the same way . I do n’t like them ways , myself . ”
23628	23644	23452	23452	Jerry	82	“ Too much of master and man about it , ai n’t there , Bos ? ”
23645	23693	23713	23713	his	53	“ Just that , Mr. Jerry . That ai n’t my idea of a free country . I can work as well as another , but I ai n’t going to be told that I ’m a swindler because I ’m making the most of my time . ”
23694	23706	23708	23708	Jerry	82	“ He turned Nokes out by the scruff of his neck ? ”
23716	23731	23713	23713	his	53	“ I did n’t think Nokes was the sort of fellow to stand that . ”
23732	23739	23741	23741	Boscobel	53	“ No more he ai n’t , ”
23743	23754	23756	23756	Joe	79	“ Heathcote ’s a good plucked un all the same , ”
23758	23773	23775	23775	Jerry	82	“ It ’s like you to speak up for such a fellow is that , ”
23777	23831	23775	23775	Jerry	82	“ I say he ’s a good plucked un . I ’m not standing up for him . Nokes is half a stone heavier than him , and ought to have knocked him over . That ’s what you ’d ’ve done , would n’t you , Bos ? I know I would . ”
23832	23844	23846	23846	Boscobel	53	“ He ’d ‘ ve had my axe at his head , ”
23848	23859	23861	23861	Jerry	82	“ We all know Joe ’s game to the backbone , ”

23878	23890	23875	23876	the brother	960	“ And you can try it out any time you like . ”
23891	23902	23904	23906	the old man	763	“ That ’s right ; fight like dogs , do , ”
24250	24253	24254	24254	Jerry	82	“ blowing . ”
24291	24304	24306	24306	Joe	79	“ There is n’t one of you man enough to touch him , ”
24320	24330	24332	24332	Jerry	82	“ And you ’d eat him , I suppose , ”
24334	24345	24347	24347	Joe	79	“ He ’s not likely to come in my way , ”
24349	24368	24347	24347	Joe	79	“ but if he does , he ’ll get as good as he brings . That ’s all . ”
24454	24457	24447	24447	himself	53	“ grub . ”
24698	24702	24704	24704	Jerry	84	“ Battle - Axe ”
24931	24937	24939	24941	the old man	763	“ There ’s something up , ”
24950	24958	24960	24960	Joe	79	“ Of course there ’s something up , ”
24962	24976	24960	24960	Joe	79	“ Those fellows did n’t come all the way to Boolabong for nothing . ”
24977	24985	24987	24988	the father	908	“ It ’s something about young Heathcote , ”
24990	24995	24997	24997	Jack	78	“ If it is , ”
24999	25006	24997	24997	Jack	78	“ what ’s that to you ? ”
25007	25020	24960	24960	Joe	79	“ They ’ll get themselves hanged , that ’s all about it . ”
25021	25026	25028	25028	Jack	78	“ That be blowed , ”
25030	25049	25028	25028	Jack	78	“ you go easy and hold your tongue . If you know nothing , nobody can hurt you . ”
25050	25055	25057	25057	Joe	79	“ I know nothing , ”
25059	25129	25057	25057	Joe	79	“ and do n’t mean . If I had scores to quit with a fellow like Harry Heathcote , I should do it after my own fashion . I should n’t get Boscobel to help me , nor yet such a fellow as Nokes . But it ’s no business of mine . Heathcote ’s made the place too hot to hold him . That ’s all about it . ”
25273	25286	25288	25289	Mr. Medlicot	47	“ Is that you , Nokes , at this time of night ? ”
25321	25326	25328	25328	Nokes	58	“ Just amusing myself , ”
25330	25336	25328	25328	Nokes	58	“ It ’s very late . ”
25337	25351	25377	25378	Mr. Medlicot	47	“ It ’s not later for me than for you , Mr. Medlicot . ”
25352	25363	25328	25328	Nokes	58	“ That ’s true . I ’ve just ridden home from “
25380	25381	25377	25378	Mr. Medlicot	47	” “
25388	25389	25377	25378	Mr. Medlicot	47	” “
25403	25666	25400	25401	Mr. Medlicot	47	” Then the man took himself into his hut , and was safe from further questioning that night . All the Saturday night Heathcote had been on the run , and he did not return home to bed till nearly dawn on the Sunday morning . At about noon prayers were read out on the veranda , the congregation consisting of Mrs. Heathcote and her sister , Mrs. Growler , and Jacko . Harry himself was rather averse to this performance , intimating that Mrs. Growler , if she were so minded , could read the prayers for herself in the kitchen , and that , as regarded Jacko , they would be altogether thrown away . But his wife had made a point of maintaining the practice , and he had of course yielded . The service was not long , and when it was over Harry got into a chair and was soon asleep . He had been in the saddle during sixteen hours of the previous day and night , and was entitled to be fatigued . His wife sat beside him , every now and again protecting him from the flies , while Kate Daly sat by with her Bible in her hand . But she , too , from time to time , was watching her brother - in - law . The trouble of his spirits and the work that he felt himself bound to do touched them with a strong feeling , and taught them to regard him for the time as a young hero . “
25672	25676	25669	25669	he	1012	” Kate said . “
25688	25689	25690	25690	He	1012	” “
25698	25703	25690	25690	He	1012	” said the wife . “
25712	25722	25704	25704	I	0	” said Harry , jumping up from his chair . “
25737	25738	25735	25735	I	0	” “
25744	25745	25742	25742	dear	1452	” “
25778	25779	25769	25770	Old Bates	38	” “
25790	25795	25784	25784	he	38	” said Mrs. Heathcote . “
25827	25828	25811	25811	I	0	” “
25835	25836	25811	25811	I	0	” “
25895	25896	25889	25889	they	1016	” “
25902	25903	25900	25900	Harry	65	” “
25932	25933	25934	25934	You	0	” “
25940	25941	25938	25938	Nokes	58	” “
26093	26094	26090	26090	his	1028	” “
26107	26116	26102	26102	you	1031	” said Kate , with good feminine logic . “
26177	26178	26185	26185	Harry	65	” “
26187	26192	26185	26185	Harry	65	” said his wife , “
26202	26203	26185	26185	Harry	65	” “
26244	26245	26237	26238	Mr. Bates	71	” “
26251	26252	26249	26249	Sir	1648	” “
26271	26272	26260	26260	You	1031	” “
26313	26314	26292	26292	They	1039	” “
26330	26331	26327	26327	their	1044	” “
26361	26468	26469	26469	You	57	” Then the young master and his old superintendent sauntered out to his back premises to talk about sheep and fires , and plans for putting out fires . And no doubt Mr. Bates had the glass of brandy - and - water which he had come to regard as one of his Sunday luxuries . From the back premises they went down to the creek to gauge the water . Then they sauntered on , keeping always in the shade , sitting down here to smoke , and standing up there to discuss the pedigree of some particular ram , till it was past six . “
26483	26551	26480	26481	Mr. Bates	71	” Harry suggested , as they returned toward the station . Mr. Bates said that he thought that he would . As the same invitation was given on almost every Sunday throughout the year , and was invariably answered in the same way , there was not much excitement in this . But Mr. Bates would not have dreamed of going in to dinner without being asked . “
26558	26569	26554	26554	Medlicot	47	” said Mr. Bates , as they entered the yard . “
26581	26736	26574	26574	they	1047	” Harry looked at the trap , and then went quickly into the house . He walked with a rapid step onto the veranda , and there he found the sugar grower and his mother . Mrs. Heathcote looked at her husband almost timidly . She knew from the very sound of his feet that he was perturbed in spirit . Under his own roof - tree he would certainly be courteous ; but there is a constrained courtesy very hard to be borne , of which she knew him to be capable . He first went up to the old lady , and to her his greeting was pleasant enough . Harry Heathcote , though he had assumed the bush mode of dressing , still retained the manners of a high - bred gentleman in his intercourse with women . Then , turning sharply round , he gave his hand to Mr. Medlicot . “
26746	26750	26737	26737	I	0	” he said ; “
26780	26840	26767	26768	Mrs. Medlicot	48	” His wife was still looking into his face , and was reading there , as in a book , the mingled pride and disdain with which her husband exercising civility to his enemy . Harry ’s countenance wore a look not difficult of perusal , and Medlicot could read the lines almost as distinctly as Harry ’s wife . “
26853	26857	26841	26841	I	0	” she said , “
26870	26871	26860	26860	she	48	” “
26882	26888	26872	26872	I	0	” said the old woman . “
26896	26900	26889	26889	You	48	” said Harry ; “
26909	27027	27028	27028	I	0	” So that was settled . Heathcote thought it odd that the man whom he regarded as his enemy , whom he had left at their last meeting in positive hostility , should consent to accept a dinner under his roof ; but that was Medlicot ’s affair , not his . They dined at seven , and after dinner strolled out into the horse paddock , and down to the creek . As they started , the three men went first , and the ladies followed them ; but Bates soon dropped behind . It was his rest day , and he had already moved quite as much as was usual with him on a Sunday . “
27041	27051	27030	27030	I	0	” said Medlicot , when they were alone together . “
27062	27158	27054	27054	we	1054	” said Harry . He spoke with a constrained voice , and with an almost savage manner , engendered by a determination to hold his own . He would forgive any offense for which an apology was made , but no apology had been made as yet ; and , to tell the truth , he was a little afraid that if they got into an argument on the matter Medlicot would have the best of it . And there was , too , almost a claim to superiority in Medlicot ’s use of the word “
27161	27190	27054	27054	we	1054	” When one man says that he has been hard to another , he almost boasts that , on that occasion , he got the better of him . “
27196	27200	27054	27054	we	1054	” said Medlicot ; “
27246	27247	27234	27234	I	0	” “
27254	27255	27234	27234	I	0	” “

27579	27746	27569	27571	no one else	1078	” Harry was silent for a moment . What right had this man to cross - examine him about his enmities — the man whose own position in the place had been one of hostility to him , whom he had almost suspected of harboring Nokes at the mill simply because Nokes had been dismissed from Gangoil ? That suspicion was , indeed , fading away . There was something in Medlicot ’s voice and manner which made it impossible to attribute such motives to him . Nevertheless the man was a free - selector , and had taken a bit of the Gangoil run after a fashion which to Heathcote was objectionable politically , morally , and socially . Let Medlicot in regard to character be what he might , he was a free - selector , and a squatter ’s enemy , and had clinched his hostility by employing a servant dismissed from the very run out of which he had bought his land . “
27753	27759	27569	27571	no one else	1078	” he replied at length , “
27797	27798	27790	27790	I	0	” “
27806	27807	27802	27802	you	1079	” “

27925	27976	27903	27904	the men	292	” The conversation then dropped , and in a little time Harry made some excuse for leaving them , and returned to the house alone , promising , however , that he would not start for his night ’s ride till after the party had come back to the station . “
27984	27988	27989	27989	I	0	” he said ; “
28012	28013	27999	27999	Mickey	49	” “

28077	28081	28075	28075	you	1085	” said Harry , “
28103	28298	28075	28075	you	1085	” The old lady and Mrs. Heathcote were soon seated on the grass , while Medlicot and Kate Daly roamed on together . Kate was a pretty , modest girl , timid withal and shy , unused to society , and therefore awkward , but with the natural instincts and aptitudes of her sex . What the glass of brandy - and - water was to Mickey O’Dowd after a fortnight ’s solitude in a bush hut , with tea , dampers , and lumps of mutton , a young man in the guise of a gentleman was to poor Kate Daly . A brother - in - law , let him be ever so good , is after all no better than tea without milk . No doubt Mickey O’Dowd often thought about a nobbler in his thirsty solitude , and so did Kate speculate on what might possibly be the attractions of a lover . Medlicot probably indulged in no such speculations ; but the nobbler , when brought close to his lips , was grateful to him as to others . That Kate Daly was very pretty no man could doubt . “
28315	28342	28343	28343	I	0	” said Kate , to whom , as was proper , Harry Heathcote at the present moment was of more importance than any other human being . “

28828	28856	28811	28811	Harry	65	” Kate merely chucked up her head and pouted her lips , as though to show that the proposition was one which did not deserve an answer . “
28869	28870	28866	28867	Miss Daly	66	” “
28885	28886	28882	28883	Mr. Medlicot	47	” “
28918	28919	28920	28920	I	0	” “
28936	28950	28920	28920	I	0	” Both Medlicot and Kate Daly meant England when they spoke of home . “
28985	29020	28971	28971	I	0	” In answer to this , Kate asserted with innocent eagerness that she was not at all exclusive , and that if ever she married any one she ’d marry the man she liked . “
29028	29032	29023	29023	you	1123	” said Medlicot . “
29037	29215	29023	29023	you	1123	” said Kate , in a low , timid whisper , hurrying away to rejoin the other ladies . She could speculate on the delights of the beverage as would Mickey O’Dowd in his hut ; but when it was first brought to her lips she could only fly away from it . In this respect Mickey O’Dowd was the more sensible of the two . No other word was spoken that night between them , but Kate lay awake till morning thinking of the one word that had been spoken . But the secret was kept sacredly within her own bosom . Before the Medlicots started that night the old lady made a proposition that the Heathcotes and Miss Daly should eat the Christmas dinner at Medlicot ’s Mill . Mrs. Heathcote , thinking perhaps of her sister , thoroughly liking what she herself had seen of the Medlicots , looked anxiously into Harry ’s face . If he would consent to this , an intimacy would follow , and probably a real friendship be made . “
29223	29246	29023	29023	you	1123	” he said . The very firmness , however , with which he spoke gave a certain cordiality even to his refusal . “
29271	29281	29023	29023	you	1123	” Then , after a pause , he continued , “
29298	29410	29292	29292	you	1127	” So it was at last decided , much to Harry ’s own astonishment , much to his wife ’s delight . Kate , therefore , when she lay awake , thinking of the one word that had been spoken , knew that there would be an opportunity for another word . Medlicot drove his mother home safely , and , after he had taken her into the house , encountered Nokes on his return from Boolabong , as has been told at the close of the last chapter . On the Monday morning Harry came home as usual , and , as usual , went to bed after his breakfast . “
29426	29439	29411	29411	I	0	” he said to his wife , as he threw himself down . “
29449	29450	29446	29446	I	0	” “
29478	29479	29484	29484	you	0	” “

29515	29516	29501	29501	they	1128	” “
29521	29522	29501	29501	they	1128	” “
29621	29819	29820	29821	George Brownbie	43	” In spite of this injunction , Mrs. Heathcote determined that he should sleep all day if he would . Even the nights were fearfully hot and sultry , and on this Monday morning he had come home much fatigued . He would be out again at sunset , and now he should have what rest nature would allow him . But in this resolve she was opposed by Jacko , who came in at eleven , and requested to see the master . Jacko had been over with the German ; and , as he explained to Mrs. Heathcote , they two had been in and out , sometimes sleeping and sometimes watching . But now he wanted to see the master , and under no persuasion would impart his information to the mistress . The poor wife , anxious as she was that her husband should sleep , did not dare in these perilous times to ignore Jacko and his information , and therefore gently woke the sleeper . In a few minutes Jacko was standing by the young squatter ’s bedside , and Harry Heathcote , quite awake , was sitting up and listening . “
29826	29838	29820	29821	George Brownbie	43	” That at first was the gravamen of Jacko ’s news . “
29846	29847	29844	29844	Jacko	51	” “
29851	29909	29844	29844	Jacko	51	” exclaimed Jacko . In those parts Georgie Brownbie was regarded almost as the Evil One himself , and Jacko , knowing what mischief was , as it were , in the word , thought that he was entitled to bread and jam , if not to a nobbler itself , in bringing such tidings to Gangoil . “
29914	29918	29920	29920	Bos	72	” asked Heathcote . “

30045	30046	30042	30042	they	1132	” “
30082	30083	30085	30086	Bill Nokes	58	” “
30091	30092	30088	30089	Mr. Harry	37	” “
30115	30116	30110	30110	I	0	” “
30125	30126	30122	30123	Mr. Harry	37	” “
30138	30144	30128	30128	you	37	” Jacko shook his head . “
30169	30425	30161	30161	I	0	” Though Heathcote had made light of the assemblage of evil spirits at Boolabong which had seemed so important to Jacko , he by no means did regard the news as unessential . Of Nokes ’s villany he was convinced . Of Boscobel he had imprudently made a second enemy at a most inauspicious time . Georgie Brownbie had long been his bitter foe . He had prosecuted and , perhaps , persecuted Georgie for various offenses ; but as Georgie was supposed to be as much at war with his own brethren as with the rest of the world at large , Heathcote had not thought much of that miscreant in the present emergency . But if the miscreant were in truth at Boolabong , and if evil things were being plotted against Gangoil , Georgie would certainly be among the conspirators . Soon after noon Harry was on horseback and Jacko was at his heels . The heat was more intense than ever . Mrs. Heathcote had twisted round Harry ’s hat a long white scarf , called a puggeree , though we are by no means sure of our spelling . Jacko had spread a very dirty fragment of an old white handkerchief on his head , and wore his hat over it . Mrs. Heathcote had begged Harry to take a large cotton parasol , and he had nearly consented , being unable at last to reconcile himself to the idea of riding with such an accoutrement even in the bush . “
30432	30436	30161	30161	I	0	” he said , “
30502	31232	30490	30490	I	0	” He rode straight away to the German ’s hut , which was on the northwestern extremity of his further paddock in that direction . From thence the western fence ran in a southerly direction , nearly straight to the river . Beyond the fence was a strip of land , in some parts over a mile broad , in others not much over a quarter of a mile , which he claimed as belonging to Gangoil , but over which the Brownbies had driven their cattle since the fence had been made , under the pretense that the fence marked the boundary of two runs . Against this assumption Heathcote had remonstrated frequently , had driven the cattle back , and had exercised the ownership of a Crown tenant in such fashion as the nature of his occupation allowed . Beyond this strip was Boolabong ; the house at Boolabong being not above three miles distant from the fence , and not above four miles from the German ’s hut . So that the Brownbies were in truth much nearer neighbors to the German than was Heathcote and his family . But between the German and the Brownbies there raged an internecine feud . No doubt Harry Heathcote , in his heart , liked the German all the better on this account ; but it behooved him both as a master and a magistrate to regard reports against Boolabong coming from the German with something of suspicion . Now Jacko had been introduced to Gangoil under German auspices , and had soon come to a decision that it would be a good thing and a just to lock up all the Brownbies in the great jail of the colony at Brisbane . He probably knew nothing of law or justice in the abstract , but he greatly valued law when exercised against those he hated . The western fence of which mention has been made ran down to the Mary River , hitting it about four miles west of Medlicot ’s Mill ; so that there was a considerable portion of the Gangoil run having a frontage to the water . As has been before said , Medlicot ’s plantation was about fourteen miles distant from the house at Boolabong , and the distance from the Gangoil house to that of the Brownbies was about the same . The oppressiveness of the day was owing more to the hot wind than to the sun itself . This wind , coming from the arid plains of the interior , brought with it a dry , suffocating heat . On this occasion it was odious to Harry Heathcote , not so much on account of its own intrinsic abominations , as because it might cause a fire to sweep across his run from its western boundary . Just beyond the boundary there lay Boolabong , and there were collected his enemies . A fire that should have passed for a mile or so across the pastures outside and beyond his own farm would be altogether unextinguishable by the time that it had reached his paddock . The Brownbies , as he knew well , would care nothing for burning a patch of their own grass . Their stock , if they had any at the present moment , were much too few in number to be affected by such a loss . The Brownbies had not a yard of fencing to be burned ; and a fire , if once it got a hold on the edge of their run , would pass on away from them , right across Harry ’s pastures and Harry ’s fences . If such were the case , he would have quite enough to do to drive his sheep from the fire , and it might be that many of them also would perish in the flames . The catastrophe might even be so bad , so frightful , that the shed and station and all should go ; though , in thinking of all the fires of which he had heard , he could remember none that had spread with fatality such as that . He found Karl Bender in his hut asleep . The man was soon up , apologizing for his somnolence , and preparing tea for his master ’s entertainment . “
31267	31329	31330	31330	I	0	” Then he told how he had boldly ridden up to Boolabong that morning , and had seen Georgie and Boscobel with his own eyes . When asked what they had said to him , he replied that he did not wait till any thing had been said , but had hurried away as fast as his horse could carry him . “
31338	31342	31343	31343	My	0	” said Harry . “
31355	31393	31346	31346	They	1142	” suggested Jacko . Karl Bender also thought that the making of such a visit would be a source of danger . But Heathcote explained that any personal attack was not to be apprehended from these men . “
31400	31889	31397	31397	their	1142	” he said , arguing that men who premeditated a secret outrage would not probably be tempted into personal violence . The horror of the position lay in this — that though a fire should rise up almost under the feet of men who were known to be hostile to him , and whose characters were acknowledged to be bad , still would there be no evidence against them . It was known to all men that , at periods of heat such as that which was now raging , fires were common . Every day the pastures were in flames , here , there , and every where . It was said , indeed , that there existed no evidence of fires in the bush till men had come with their flocks . But then there had been no smoking , no boiling of pots , no camping out , till men had come , and no matches . Every one around might be sure that some particular fire had been the work of an incendiary , might be able to name the culprit who had done the deed ; and yet no jury could convict the miscreant . Watchfulness was the best security , watchfulness day and night till rain should come ; and Heathcote calculated that it would be better for him that his enemies should know that he was watchful . He would go up among them and show them that he was not ashamed to speak to them of his anxiety . They could hear nothing by his coming which they did not already know . They were well aware that he was on the watch , and it might be well that they should know also how close his watch was kept . He took the German and Jacko with him , but left them with their horses about a mile on the Boolabong side of his own fence , nigh to the extreme boundary of the Debatable Land . They knew his whistle , and were to ride to him at once should he call them . He had left the house about noon , saying that he would be home to dinner — which , however , on such occasions , was held to be a feast movable over a wide space of time . But on this occasion the women expected him to come early , as it was his intention to be out again as soon as it should be dark . Mrs. Growler was asked to have the dinner ready at six . During the day Mrs. Heathcote was backward and forward in the kitchen . Then was something wrong she knew , but could not quite discern the evil . Sing Sing , the cook , was more than ordinarily alert ; but Sing Sing , the cook , was not much trusted . Mrs. Growler was “
31896	31993	31397	31397	their	1142	” as far as that went , having lived with old Mr. Daly when he was prosperous ; but she was apt to be downhearted , and on the present occasion was more than usually low in spirits . Whenever Mrs. Heathcote spoke , she wept . At six o’clock she came into the parlor with a budget of news . Sing Sing , the cook , had been gone for the last half hour , leaving the leg of mutton at the fire . It soon became clear to them that he had altogether absconded . “
32003	32248	31397	31397	their	1142	” said Mrs. Growler . At seven o’clock the sun was down , though the gloom of the tropical evening had not yet come . The two ladies went out to the gate , which was but a few yards from the veranda , and there stood listening for the sound of Harry ’s horse . The low moaning of the wind through the trees could be heard , but it was so gentle , continuous , and unaltered that it seemed to be no more than a vehicle for other sounds , and was as death - like as silence itself . The gate of the horse paddock through which Heathcote must pass on his way home was nearly a mile distant ; but the road there was hard , and they knew that they could hear from there the fall of his horse ’s feet . There they stood from seven to nearly eight , whispering a word now and then to each other , listening always , but in vain . Looking away to the west every now and then , they fancied that they could see the sky glow with flames , and then they would tell each other that it was fancy . The evening grew darker and still darker , but no sound was heard through the moaning wind . From time to time Mrs. Growler came out to them , declaring her fears in no measured terms . “
32267	32268	32256	32256	I	0	” “
32284	32285	32272	32273	Mrs. Growler	45	” “
32311	32312	32304	32305	Mrs. Medlicot	48	” “
32321	32325	32315	32315	you	1151	” said Kate . “
32386	32427	32377	32377	He	1157	” Mrs. Heathcote took her husband ’s part very strongly , and gave Mrs. Growler as hard a scolding as she knew how to pronounce . But her own courage was giving way much as Mrs. Growler ’s had done . “
32435	32439	32428	32428	We	1147	” she said ; “
32457	32477	32480	32480	Kate	41	” Then Mrs. Growler was very sulky , and , retreating to the kitchen , sobbed there in solitude . “
32489	32495	32480	32480	Kate	41	” said the elder sister . “
32500	32501	32497	32497	you	41	” “
32533	32628	32631	32631	him	1157	” Then they were again silent , and remained without exchanging more than a word or two for nearly half an hour . They took hold of each other , and every now and then went to the kitchen door that the old woman might be comforted by their presence , but they had no consolation to offer each other . The silence of the bush , and the feeling of great distances , and the dread of calamity almost crushed them . At last there was a distant sound of horse ’s feet . “
32633	33101	32631	32631	him	1157	” said Mrs. Heathcote , rushing forward toward the outer gate of the horse paddock , followed by her sister . Her ears were true , but she was doomed to disappointment . The horseman was only a messenger from her husband — Mickey O’Dowd , the Irish boundary rider . He had great tidings to tell , and was so long telling them that we will not attempt to give them in his own words . The purport of his story was as follows : Harry had been to Boolabong House , but had found there no one but the old man . Returning home thence toward his own fence , he had smelled the smoke of fire , and had found within a furlong of his path a long ridge of burning grass . According to Mickey ’s account , it could not have been lighted above a few minutes before Heathcote ’s presence on the spot . As it was , it had got too much ahead for him to put it out single - handed ; a few yards he might have managed , but — so Mickey said , probably exaggerating the matter — there was half a quarter of a mile of flame . He had therefore ridden on before the fire , had called his own two men to him , and had at once lighted the grass himself some two hundred yards in front , making a second fire , but so keeping it down that it should be always under control . Before the hinder flames had caught him , Bender and Jacko had been with him , and they had thus managed to consume the fuel which , had it remained there , would have fed the fire which was too strong to be mastered . By watching the extremities of the line of fire , they overpowered it , and so the damage was for the moment at an end . The method of dealing with the enemy was so well known in the bush , and had been so often canvassed in the hearing of the two sisters , that it was clearly intelligible to them . The evil had been met in the proper way , and the remedy had been effective . But why did not Harry come home ? Mickey O’Dowd , after his fashion , explained that too . The ladies were not to wait dinner . The master felt himself obliged to remain out at night , and had gotten food at the German ’s hut . He , Mickey , was commissioned to return with a flask full of brandy , as it would be necessary that Harry , with all the men whom he could trust , should be “
33105	33198	33199	33199	I	0	” all night . This small body was to consist of Harry himself , of the German , of Jacko , and , according to the story as at present told , especially of Mickey O’Dowd . Much as she would have wished to have kept the man at the station for protection , she did not think of disobeying her husband ’s orders . So Mickey was fed , and then sent back with the flask — with tidings also as to the desertion of that wretched cook , Sing Sing . “
33206	33214	33199	33199	I	0	” said Mrs. Heathcote to her sister . “
33228	33855	33219	33219	I	0	” Kate declared that she would also sit in the veranda all night ; and , as a matter of course , they were joined by Mrs. Growler . They had been so seated about an hour when Kate Daly declared that the heavens were on fire . The two young women jumped up , flew to the gate , and found that the whole western horizon was lurid with a dark red light . Harry Heathcote had on this occasion entertained no doubt whatever that the fire had been intentional and premeditated . A lighted torch must have been dragged along the grass , so as to ignite a line many yards long all at the same time . He had been luckily near enough to the spot to see almost the commencement of the burning , and was therefore aware of its form and circumstances . He almost wondered that he had not seen the figure of the man who had drawn the torch , or at any rate heard his steps . Pursuit would have been out of the question , as his work was wanted at the moment to extinguish the flames . The miscreant probably had remembered this , and had known that he might escape stealthily without the noise of a rapid retreat . When the work was over , when he had put out the fire he had himself lighted , and had exterminated the lingering remnants of that which had been intended to destroy him , he stood still a while almost in despair . His condition seemed to be hopeless . What could he do against such a band of enemies , knowing as he did that , had he been backed even by a score of trusty followers , one foe might still suffice to ruin him ? At the present moment he was very hot with the work he had done , as were also Jacko and the German . O’Dowd had also come up as they were completing their work . Their mode of extinguishing the flames had been to beat them down with branches of gum - tree loaded with leaves . By sweeping these along the burning ground the low flames would be scattered and expelled . But the work was very hard and hot . The boughs they used were heavy , and the air around them , sultry enough from its own properties , was made almost unbearable by the added heat of the fires . The work had been so far done , but it might be begun again at any moment , either near or at a distance . No doubt the attempt would be made elsewhere along the boundary between Gangoil and Boolabong — was very probably being made at this moment . The two men whom he could trust and Jacko were now with him . They were wiping their brows with their arms and panting with their work . He first resolved on sending Mickey O’Dowd to the house . The distance was great , and the man ’s assistance might be essential . But he could not bear to leave his wife without news from him . Then , after considering a while , he made up his mind to go back toward his own fence , making his way as he went southerly down toward the river . They who were determined to injure him would , he thought , repeat their attempt in that direction . He hardly said a word to his two followers , but rode at a foot - pace to the spot at his fence which he had selected as the site of his bivouac for the night . “
33865	33872	33863	33863	Bender	59	” he said to the German ; “
33889	33983	33984	33984	Karl	59	” The German made a motion with his arms intended to signify his utter indifference . One place was the same as another to him . Jacko uttered his usual ejaculation , and then , having hitched his horse to the fence , threw himself on his back upon the grass . No doubt they all slept , but they slept as watchers sleep , with one eye open . It was Harry who first saw the light which a few minutes later made itself visible to the ladies at the home station . “
33986	33993	33984	33984	Karl	59	” he exclaimed , jumping up , “
34003	34157	33994	33994	they	1165	” In less than half a minute , and without speaking another word , they were all on their horses and riding in the direction of the light . It came from a part of the Boolabong run somewhat nearer to the river than the place at which they had stationed themselves , where the strip of ground between Harry ’s fence and the acknowledged boundary of Brownbie ’s run was the narrowest . As they approached the fire , they became aware that it had been lighted on Boolabong . On this occasion Harry did not ride on up to the flames , knowing that the use or loss of a few minutes might save or destroy his property . He hardly spoke a word as he proceeded on his business , feeling that they upon whom he had to depend were sufficiently instructed , if only they would be sufficiently energetic . “
34168	34393	34394	34394	You	1166	” was all he said , as , lighting a dried bush with a match , he ran the fire along the ground in front of the coming flames . A stranger seeing it all would have felt sure that the remedy would have been as bad as the disease , for the fire which Harry himself made every now and again seemed to get the better of those who were endeavoring to control it . There might perhaps be a quarter of a mile between the front of the advancing fire and the line at which Harry had commenced to destroy the food which would have fed the coming flames . He himself , as quickly as he lighted the grass , which in itself was the work but of a moment , would strain himself to the utmost at the much harder task of controlling his own fire , so that it should not run away from him , and get , as it were , out of his hands , and be as bad to him as that which he was thus seeking to circumvent . The German and Jacko worked like heroes , probably with intense enjoyment of the excitement , and , after a while , found a fourth figure among the flames , for Mickey had now returned . “
34398	34407	34394	34394	You	1166	” Harry said , panting with his work . “
34413	34424	34408	34408	They	1167	” said Mickey , flopping away with a great bough ; “
34433	34434	34428	34428	Chinese	90	” “
34446	34883	34884	34884	We	1168	” said Jacko . The German , whose gum - tree bough was a very big one , and whose every thought was intent on letting the fire run while he still held it in hand , had not breath for a syllable . But the back fire was extending itself , so as to get round them . Every now and then Harry extended his own line , moving always forward toward Gangoil as he did so , though he and his men were always on Brownbie ’s territory . He had no doubt but that where he could succeed in destroying the grass for a breadth of forty or fifty yards he would starve out the inimical flames . The trees and bushes without the herbage would not enable it to travel a yard . Wherever the grass was burned down black to the soil , the fire would stop . But should they , who were at work , once allow themselves to be outflanked , their exertions would be all in vain . And then those wretches might light a dozen fires . The work was so hard , so hot , and often so hopeless , that the unhappy young squatter was more than once tempted to bid his men desist and to return to his homestead . The flames would not follow him there . He could , at any rate , make that safe . And then , when he had repudiated this feeling as unworthy of him , he began to consider within himself whether he would not do better for his property by taking his men with him on to his run , and endeavoring to drive his sheep out of danger . But as he thought of all this , he still worked , still fired the grass , and still controlled the flames . Presently he became aware of what seemed to him at first to be a third fire . Through the trees , in the direction of the river , he could see the glimmering of low flames and the figures of men . But it was soon apparent to him that these men were working in his cause , and that they , too , were burning the grass that would have fed the advancing flames . At first he could not spare the minute which would be necessary to find out who was his friend , but , as they drew nearer , he knew the man . It was the sugar planter from the mill and with him his foreman . “
34891	34895	34884	34884	We	1168	” said Medlicot , “
34911	34912	34884	34884	We	1168	” “
34919	34952	34884	34884	We	1168	” said Harry , too much excited at the moment to ask questions as to the cause of Medlicot ’s presence so far from his home at that time of the evening . “
34967	34968	34959	34959	I	0	” “
34991	34992	34959	34959	I	0	” “
34997	35001	34959	34959	I	0	” said Harry . “
35041	35070	35072	35072	you	0	” He had paused as he spoke , leaning on the great battered bough which he held , but in an instant was at work with it again . “
35112	35173	35106	35106	they	292	” So saying , he rushed on with a lighted bush torch in his band . Suddenly he found himself confronted in the bush by a man on horseback , whom he at once recognized as Georgie Brownbie . He forgot for a moment where he was and began to question the reprobate as to his presence at that spot . “
35180	35184	35177	35177	your	0	” said Georgie . “
35218	35243	35211	35216	a nice sort of young man	1176	” Harry , checked for a moment by the remembrance that he was in truth upon Boolabong run , did not at once answer . “
35256	35260	35262	35262	you	0	” continued Georgie , “
35279	35280	35273	35273	you	0	” “
35286	35287	35288	35288	It	1177	” “
35315	35362	35308	35308	I	0	” Harry ’s men and Medlicot were advancing toward him , trampling out their own embers as they came ; and Georgie Brownbie , who was alone , when he saw that there were four or five men against him , turned round and rode back . “
35371	35375	35376	35376	He	1179	” said Harry . “
35398	35399	35389	35389	he	1179	” “
35413	35419	35404	35404	he	1179	” said Medlicot , quietly ; “
35427	35428	35404	35404	he	1179	” “
35433	35434	35435	35436	My man	1182	” “
35450	35451	35442	35442	him	1182	” “
35456	35457	35460	35461	Mr. Heathcote	57	” “
35484	35551	35479	35479	I	0	” Harry had not a word to say , unless it were tell the man that he loved him for the frankness of his confession . But the moment was hardly auspicious for such a declaration . There was no excuse for them to pause in their work , for the fire was still crackling at their back , and they did no more than pause . “
35554	35558	35479	35479	I	0	” said Harry , “
35570	36087	36088	36088	My	0	” For he saw that he was being outflanked by the advancing flames . But still they worked , drawing lines of fire here and there , and still they hoped that there might be ground for hope . Nokes had been seen ; but , pregnant as the theme might be with words , it was almost impossible to talk . Questions could not be asked and answered without stopping in their toil . There were questions which Harry longed to ask . Could Medlicot swear to the man ? Did the man know that he had been seen ? If he knew that he had been watched while he lit the grass , he would soon be far away from Medlicot ’s Mill and Gangoil . Harry felt that it would be a consolation to him in his trouble if he could get hold of this man , and keep him , and prosecute him — and have him hung . Even in the tumult of the moment he was able to reflect about it , and to think that he remembered that the crime of arson was capital in the colony of Queensland . He had endeavored to be good to the men with whom he had dealings . He had not stinted their food , or cut them short in their wages , or been hard in exacting work from them . And this was his return ! Ideas as to the excellence of absolute dominion and power flitted across his brain — such power as Abraham , no doubt , exercised . In Abraham ’s time the people were submissive , and the world was happy . Harry Heathcote , at least , had never heard that it was not happy . But as he thought of all this he worked away with his bush and his matches , extinguishing the flames here and lighting them there , striving to make a cordon of black bare ground between Boolabong and Gangoil . Surely Abraham had never been called on to work like this ! He and his men were in a line covering something above a quarter of a mile of ground , of which line he was himself the nearest to the river , and Medlicot and his foreman the farthest from it . The German and O’Dowd were in the middle , and Jacko was working with his master . If Harry had just cause for anger and sorrow in regard to Nokes and Boscobel , he certainly had equal cause to be proud of the stanchness of his remaining satellites . The men worked with a will , as though the whole run had been the personal property of each of them . Nokes and Boscobel would probably have done the same had the fires come before they had quarreled with their master . It is a small and narrow point that turns the rushing train to the right or to the left . The rushing man is often turned off by a point as small and narrow . “
36091	36099	36088	36088	My	0	” said Jacko , on a sudden , “
36109	36132	36088	36088	My	0	” And as he spoke , there was the sound of half a dozen horsemen galloping up to them through the bush . “
36143	36494	36137	36137	Bos	72	” said Jacko . The two leading men were Joe and Jerry Brownbie , who , for this night only , had composed their quarrels , and close to them was Boscobel . There were others behind , also mounted — Jack Brownbie and Georgie , and Nokes himself ; but they , though their figures were seen , could not be distinguished in the gloom of the night . Nor , indeed , did Harry at first discern of how many the party consisted . It seemed that there was a whole troop of horsemen , whose purpose it was to interrupt him in his work , so that the flames should certainly go ahead . And it was evident that the men thought that they could do so without subjecting themselves to legal penalties . As far as Harry Heathcote could see , they were correct in their view . He could have no right to burn the grass on Boolabong . He had no claim even to be there . It was true that he could plead that he was stopping the fire which they had purposely made ; but they could prove his handiwork , whereas it would be almost impossible that he should prove theirs . The whole forest was not red , but lurid , with the fires , and the air was laden with both the smell and the heat of the conflagration . The horsemen were dressed , as was Harry himself , in trowsers and shirts , with old slouch hats , and each of them had a cudgel in his hand . As they came galloping up through the trees they were as uncanny and unwelcome a set of visitors as any man was ever called on to receive . Harry necessarily stayed his work , and stood still to bear the brunt of the coming attack ; but Jacko went on with his employment faster than ever , as though a troop of men in the dark were nothing to him . Jerry Brownbie was the first to speak . “
36519	36520	36513	36513	You	1187	” “
36529	36539	36521	36521	I	0	” said Harry , turning to his work again . “
36562	36640	36556	36556	I	0	” The Brownbies had been aware that Harry ’s two boundary riders were with him , but had not heard of the arrival of Medlicot and the other man . Nokes was aware that some one on horseback had been near him when he was firing the grass , but had thought that it was one of the party from Gangoil . By the time that Jerry Brownbie had reached the German , Medlicot was there also . “
36647	36651	36642	36643	the deuce	1192	” asked Jerry . “
36659	36663	36657	36657	yours	72	” said Medlicot . “
36685	36686	36689	36690	that fellow	1651	” “
36700	36704	36689	36690	that fellow	1651	” said Joe ; “
36712	36713	36714	36714	I	0	” “
36724	36741	36716	36716	you	72	” continued Jerry , who had been given to understand that Medlicot was Heathcote ’s enemy . “
36799	37113	36794	36794	you	72	” As Medlicot still went on putting out the fire , Jerry attempted to ride him down . Medlicot caught the horse by the rein , and violently backed the brute in among the embers . The animal plunged and reared , getting his head loose , and at last came down , he and his rider together . In the mean time Joe Brownbie , seeing this , rode up behind the sugar planter , and struck him violently with his cudgel over the shoulder . Medlicot sank nearly to the ground , but at once recovered himself . He knew that some bone on the left side of his body was broken ; but he could still fight with his right hand , and he did fight . Boscobel and Georgie Brownbie both attempted to ride over Harry together , and might have succeeded had not Jacko ingeniously inserted the burning branch of gum - tree with which he had been working under the belly of the horse on which Boscobel was riding . The animal jumped immediately from the ground , bucking into the air , and Boscobel was thrown far over his head . Georgie Brownbie then turned upon Jacko , but Jacko was far too nimble to be caught , and escaped among the trees . For a few minutes the fight was general , but the footmen had the best of it , in spite of the injury done to Medlicot . Jerry was bruised and burned about the face by his fall among the ashes , and did not much relish the work afterward . Boscobel was stunned for a few moments , and was quite ready to retreat when he came to himself . Nokes during the whole time did not show himself , alleging as a reason afterward the presence of his employer Medlicot . “
37124	37135	37114	37114	I	0	” said Joe Brownbie to him on their way home . “
37161	37162	37159	37159	himself	1200	” “
37171	37175	37163	37163	I	0	” answered Nokes , “
37216	37844	37211	37214	some folks at Boolabong	1202	” We may imagine , therefore , that the night was not spent pleasantly among the Brownbies after these adventures . There were , of course , very much cursing and swearing , and very many threats , before the party from Boolabong did retreat . Their great point was , of coarse , this — that Heathcote was willfully firing the grass , and was , therefore , no better than an incendiary . Of course they stoutly denied that the original fire had been intentional , and denied as stoutly that the original fire could be stopped by fires . But at last they went , leaving Heathcote and his party masters of the battle - field . Jerry was taken away in a sad condition ; and , in subsequent accounts of the transaction given from Boolabong , his fall was put forward as the reason of their flight , he having been the general on the occasion . And Boscobel had certainly lost all stomach for immediate fighting . Immediately behind the battle - field they come across Nokes , and Sing Sing , the runaway cook from Gangoil . The poor Chinaman had made the mistake of joining the party which was not successful . But Harry , though the victory was with him , was hardly in a mood for triumph . He soon found that Medlicot ’s collar - bone was broken , and it would be necessary , therefore , that he should return with the wounded man to the station . And the flames , as he feared , had altogether got ahead of him during the fight . As far as they had gone , they had stopped the fire , having made a black wilderness a mile and a half in length , which , during the whole distance , ceased suddenly at the line at which the subsidiary fire had been extinguished . But while the attack was being made upon them the flames had crept on to the southward , and had now got beyond their reach . It had seemed , however , that the mass of fire which had got away from them was small , and already the damp of the night was on the grass ; and Harry felt himself justified in hoping not that there might be no loss , but that the loss might not be ruinous . Medlicot consented to be taken back to Gangoil instead of to the mill . Perhaps he thought that Kate Daly might be a better nurse than his mother , or that the quiet of the sheep station might be better for him than the clatter of his own mill - wheels . It was midnight , and they had a ride of fourteen miles , which was hard enough upon a man with a broken collarbone . The whole party also was thoroughly fatigued . The work they had been doing was about as hard as could fall to a man ’s lot , and they had now been many hours without food . Before they started Mickey produced his flask , the contents of which were divided equally among them all , including Jacko . As they were preparing to start home Medlicot explained that it had struck him by degrees that Heathcote might be right in regard to Nokes , and that he had determined to watch the man himself whenever he should leave the mill . On that Monday he had given up work somewhat earlier than usual , saying that , as the following day was Christmas , he should not come to the mill . From that time Medlicot and his foreman had watched him . “
37847	37859	37211	37214	some folks at Boolabong	1202	” said he , in answer to a question from Heathcote , “
37901	37964	37894	37894	they	1204	” When the fight was quite over , and Heathcote ’s party had returned to their horses , Medlicot for a few minutes was faint and sick , but he revived after a while , and declared himself able to sit on his horse . There was a difficulty in getting him up , but when there he made no further complaint . “
37967	37979	37894	37894	they	1204	” said he , as he settled himself in his saddle , “
38009	38010	37998	37998	I	0	” “
38020	38024	37998	37998	I	0	” said Harry . “

38131	38135	38122	38122	We	1208	” Harry pleaded . “
38232	38244	38229	38230	a lady	568	” Medlicot declared that the pain did not trouble him much . “
38256	38260	38245	38245	They	1218	” continued Harry . “
38268	38284	38285	38285	I	0	” said Jacko , who was very proud of his own part in the battle . “
38339	38340	38341	38341	I	0	” “
38345	38349	38350	38350	He	72	” said Harry . “

38424	38429	38416	38416	You	1220	” said the German . “

38765	38822	38751	38751	I	0	” They all understood him very well — the German , the Irishman , Medlicot ’s foreman , Medlicot himself , and even Jacko ; and though , no doubt , there was a feeling within the hearts of the men that Harry Heathcote was imperious , still they respected him , and they believed him . “
38833	38838	38827	38828	the masther	1238	” said the Irishman . “
38853	38860	38827	38828	the masther	1238	” said the German , slowly . “
38872	38880	38869	38870	Karl Bender	59	” asked the squatter , with energy . “
38947	38948	38949	38949	I	0	” “
38955	38959	38949	38949	I	0	” said Medlicot . “

39012	39013	38994	38995	a man	128	” “
39018	39019	39016	39016	Sir	1648	” “

39088	39089	39066	39066	you	0	” “
39105	39355	39066	39066	you	0	” They had by this time reacted the Gangoil fence , having taken the directest route for the house . But Harry , in doing this , had not been unmindful of the fire . Had Medlicot not been wounded , he would have taken the party somewhat out of the way , down southward , following the flames ; but Medlicot ’s condition had made him feel that he would not be justified in doing so . Now , however , it occurred to him that he might as well ride a mile or two down the fence , and see what injury had been done . The escort of the men would be sufficient to take Medlicot to the station , and he would reach the place as soon as they . If the flames were still running ahead , he knew that he could not now stop then , but he could at least learn how the matter stood with him . If the worst came to the worst , he would not now lose more than three or four miles of fencing , and the grass off a corner of his run . Nevertheless , tired as he was , he could not bear the idea of going home without knowing the whole story . So he made his proposal . Medlicot , of course , made no objection . Each of the men offered to go with him , but he declined their services . “
39362	39366	39368	39370	nobody to catch	1250	” said he , “
39383	39471	39472	39472	You	1251	” So he went alone . The words that he had uttered among his men had not been lightly spoken . He had begun to perceive that life would be very hard to him in his present position , or perhaps altogether impossible , as long as he was at enmity with all those around him . Old squatters whom he knew , respectable men who had been in the colony before he was born , had advised him to be on good terms with the Brownbies . “
39496	39519	39491	39491	them	1252	” an old gentleman had said to him . He certainly had n’t taken the old gentleman ’s advice , thinking that to “
39523	40223	40224	40224	I	0	” so great a reprobate as Jerry Brownbie would be holding a candle to the devil . But his own plan had hardly answered . Well , he was sure , at any rate , of this — that he could do no good now by endeavoring to be civil to the Brownbies . He soon came to the place where the fire had reached his fence , and found that it had burned its way through , and that the flames were still continuing their onward course . The fence to the north , or rather to the northwestward — the point whence the wind was coming — stood firm at the spot at which the fire had struck it . Dry as the wood was , the flames had not traveled upward against the wind . But to the south the fire was traveling down the fence . To stop this he rode half a mile along the burning barrier till he had headed the flames , and then he pulled the bushes down and rolled away the logs , so as to stop the destruction . As regarded his fence , there was less than a mile of it destroyed , and that he could now leave in security , as the wind was blowing away from it . As for his grass , that must now take its chance . He could see the dark light of the low running fire ; but there was no longer a mighty blaze , and he knew that the dew of the night was acting as his protector . The harm that had been as yet done was trifling , if only he could protect himself from further harm . After leaving the fire , he had still a ride of seven or eight miles through the gloom of the forest — all alone . Not only was he weary , but his horse was so tired that he could hardly get him to canter for a furlong . He regretted that he had not brought the boy with him , knowing well the service of companionship to a tired beast . He was used to such troubles , and could always tell himself that his back was broad enough to bear them ; but his desolation among enemies oppressed him . Medlicot , however , was no longer an enemy . Then there came across his mind for the first time an idea that Medlicot might marry his sister - in - law , and become his fast friend . If he could have but one true friend , he thought that he could bear the enmity of all the Brownbies . Hitherto he had been entirely alone in his anxiety . It was between three and four when he reached Gangoil , and he found that the party of horsemen had just entered the yard before him . The sugar planter was so weak that he could hardly get off his horse . The two ladies were still watching when the cavalcade arrived , though it was then between three and four in the morning . It was Harry ’s custom on such occasions to ride up to the little gate close to the veranda , and there to hang his bridle till some one should take his horse away ; but on this occasion he and the others rode into the yard . Seeing this , Mrs. Heathcote and her sister went through the house , and soon learned how things were . Mr. Medlicot , from the mill , had come with a bone broken , and it was their duty to nurse him till a doctor could be procured from Maryborough . Now Maryborough was thirty miles distant . Some one must be dispatched at once . Jacko volunteered , but in such a service Jacko was hardly to be trusted . He might fall asleep on his horse , and continue his slumbers on the ground . Mickey and the German both offered ; but the men were so beaten by their work that Heathcote did not dare to take their offer . “
40234	40241	40232	40232	Mary	40	” he said to his wife , “
40255	40261	40253	40253	Jackson	85	” Jackson was the doctor . “
40273	40274	40253	40253	Jackson	85	” “
40293	40294	40253	40253	Jackson	85	” “
40341	40347	40348	40348	you	0	up”—Yorkie was a favorite horse he had—“while
40357	40367	40368	40368	Jackson	85	Colonel”—Colonel was another horse , well esteemed at Gangoil . “
40384	40610	40611	40612	Miss Daly	66	” And so it was arranged , in spite of the wife ’s tears and entreaties . Harry had his coffee and some food , and started , with his two horses , for the doctor . Nature is so good to us that we are sometimes disposed to think we might have dispensed with art . In the bush , where doctors can not be had , bones will set themselves ; and when doctors do come , but come slowly , the broken bones suit themselves to such tardiness . Medlicot was brought in and put to bed . Let the reader not be shocked to hear that Kate Daly ’s room was given up to him , as being best suited for a sick man ’s comfort , and the two ladies took it in turn to watch him . Mrs. Heathcote was , of course , the first , and remained with him till dawn . Then Kate crept to the door and asked whether she should relieve her sister . Medlicot was asleep , and it was agreed that Kate should remain in the veranda , and look in from time to time to see whether the wounded man required aught at her hands . She looked in very often , and then , at last , he was awake . “
40614	40618	40611	40612	Miss Daly	66	” he said , “
40630	40631	40611	40612	Miss Daly	66	” “
40658	40678	40679	40679	You	66	” When the words were spoken she felt that they were not as complimentary as she would have wished . “
40705	40706	40707	40707	I	0	” “
40722	40723	40724	40725	The doctor	2065	” “
40799	40800	40766	40766	Harry	65	” “
40806	40807	40808	40808	He	65	” “
40862	40878	40849	40849	You	66	” It suited Kate ’s feelings that Medlicot should be the hero of this occasion . “
40891	40892	40879	40879	We	1261	” “
40937	40938	40929	40930	My sister	1095	” “
40950	40951	40947	40948	Miss Daly	66	” “
40958	41160	40947	40948	Miss Daly	66	” She was still thinking of the one word he had spoken when he had — well , not asked her for her love , but said that which between a young man and a young woman ought to mean the same thing . Perhaps it had meant nothing ! She had heard that young men do say things which mean nothing . But to her , living in the solitude of Gangoil , the one word had been so much ! Her heart had melted with absolute acknowledged love when the man had been brought through into the house with all the added attraction of a broken bone . While her sister had watched , she had retired — to rest , as Mary had said , but in truth to think of the chance which had brought her in this guise into familiar contact with the man she loved . And then , when she had crept up to take her place in watching him , she had almost felt that shame should restrain her . But was her duty ; and , of course , a man with a collar - bone broken would not speak of love . “
41171	41175	40947	40948	Miss Daly	66	” he said . “
41198	41199	41191	41191	We	1271	” “
41205	41206	41201	41201	you	1270	” “
41247	41248	41249	41249	We	1271	” “
41259	41260	41249	41249	We	1271	” “
41270	41301	41263	41263	I	0	” said Kate , putting her hands together in her energy , and then retreating from her energy with sad awkwardness when she remembered the personal application of her wish . “
41311	41319	41307	41307	you	1270	” she added , in a whisper . “
41328	41329	41307	41307	you	1270	” “
41384	41385	41386	41386	I	0	” “
41394	41395	41388	41388	you	0	” “
41410	41411	41405	41405	she	40	” “
41430	41462	41419	41420	a wife	1097	” Kate had no answer to make , but she thought that it would be his own fault if he did not have a wife to stand up for him thoroughly . “
41472	41473	41476	41476	he	65	” “
41524	41605	41511	41511	he	65	” She jumped up from her chair , which was close to his bed , and as she did so just touched his hand with hers . It was involuntary on her part , having come of instinct rather than will , and she withdrew herself instantly . The hand she had touched belonged to the arm that was not hurt , and he put it out after her , and caught her by the sleeve as she was retreating . “
41628	41733	41608	41609	Mr. Medlicot	47	” And so she escaped , and left the room , and did not see him again till the doctor had gone from Gangoil . The bone had been broken simply as other bones are broken ; it was now set , and the sufferer was , of course , told that he must rest . He had suggested that he should be taken home , and the Heathcotes had concurred with the doctor in asserting that no proposition could be more absurd . He had intended to eat his Christmas dinner at Gangoil , and he must now pass his entire Christmas there . “
41745	41750	41608	41609	Mr. Medlicot	47	” Harry had said . “
41770	41782	41763	41763	I	0	” To this , however , Mrs. Heathcote had demurred successfully . “
41797	41826	41788	41788	Harry	65	” she said . Bender , therefore , was sent in the buggy for the old lady , and at last Harry Heathcote consented to go to bed . “
41838	41858	41831	41831	I	0	” he said , as he turned in . But he did n’t begin his sleep quite at once . “
41868	41881	41863	41863	I	0	” he said to his wife , rising up from his pillow . “
41946	41947	41972	41972	Mary	40	” “
41954	41958	41972	41972	Mary	40	” she said . “
42018	42245	42008	42009	that fellow	1651	” Mrs. Heathcote , with some little inward chuckle at her husband ’s assumed quickness of apprehension , reminded herself that the same idea had occurred to her some time ago . Mrs. Heathcote gave her husband full credit for more than ordinary intelligence in reference to affairs appertaining to the breeding of sheep and the growing of wool , but she did not think highly of his discernment in such an affair as this . She herself had been much quicker . When she first saw Mr. Medlicot , she had felt it a godsend that such a man , with the look of a gentleman , and unmarried , should come into the neighborhood ; and , in so feeling , her heart had been entirely with her sister . For herself it mattered nothing who came or did not come , or whether a man were a bachelor , or possessed of a wife and a dozen children . All that a girl had a right to want was a good husband . She was quite satisfied with her own lot in that respect , but she was anxious enough on behalf of Kate . And when a young man did come , who might make matters so pleasant for them , Harry quarreled with him because he was a free - selector . “
42252	42279	42280	42280	Harry	65	” she had once said to Kate — not , however , communicating to her innocent sister the ambition which was already filling her own bosom . “
42319	42326	42314	42317	a very nice fellow	1298	” Kate had remarked that he was “
42331	42399	42314	42317	a very nice fellow	1298	” and nothing more had been said . But Mrs. Heathcote , in spite of Harry ’s aversion , had formed her little project — a project which , if then declared , would have filled Harry with dismay . And now the young aristocrat , as he turned himself in his bed , made the suggestion to his wife as though it were all his own ! “
42411	42417	42400	42400	I	0	” she said , innocently . “
42425	42429	42418	42418	I	0	” said Harry ; “
42450	42451	42452	42452	Kate	41	” “
42461	42466	42452	42452	Kate	41	” said Mrs. Heathcote . “
42475	42758	42759	42759	My	0	” His rest , however , was not of long duration . As he had himself suggested , two policemen reached Gangoil at about three in the afternoon , on their way from Maryborough to Boolabong , in order that they might take Mr. Medlicot ’s deposition . After Heathcote ’s departure it had occurred to Sergeant Forrest of the police — and the suggestion , having been transferred from the sergeant to the stipendiary magistrate , was now produced with magisterial sanction — that , after all , there was no evidence against the Brownbies . They had simply interfered to prevent the burning of the grass on their own run , and who could say that they had committed any crime by doing so ? If Medlicot had seen Nokes with a lighted branch in his hand , the matter might be different with him ; and therefore Medlicot ’s deposition was taken . He had sworn that he had seen Nokes drag his lighted torch along the ground ; he had also seen other horsemen — two or three , as he thought — but could not identify them . Jacko ’s deposition was also taken as to the man who had been heard and seen in the wool - shed at night . Jacko was ready to swear point - blank that the man was Nokes . The policemen suggested that , as the night was dark , Jacko might as well allow a shade of doubt to appear , thinking that the shade of doubt would add strength to the evidence . But Jacko was not going to be taught what sort of oath he should swear . “
42762	42766	42759	42759	My	0	” he said . “
42779	42825	42775	42775	You	1301	” Armed with these depositions , the two constables went on to Boolabong in search of Nokes , and of Nokes only , much to the chagrin of Harry , who declared that the police would never really bestir themselves in a squatter ’s cause . “
42843	42887	42830	42830	he	58	” The Brownbie party returned , after their midnight raid , in great discomfiture to Boolabong . Their leader , Jerry , was burned about his hands and face in a disagreeable and unsightly manner . Joe had hardly made good that character for “
42894	42976	42977	42977	You	1302	” for which he was apt to claim credit . Boscobel was altogether disconcerted by his fall . And Nokes , who had certainly shown no aptitude for the fray , was abused by them all as having caused their retreat by his cowardice ; while Sing Sing , the runaway cook , who knew that he had forfeited his wages at Gangoil , was forced to turn over in his heathenish mind the ill effects of joining the losing side . “
42983	43006	42977	42977	You	1302	” he said more than once to his friend the woodsman , who had lured him away from the comforts of Gangoil . “
43023	43053	43054	43054	You	1302	” Boscobel would reply . But Sing Sing went on with his reproaches , and , before they had reached Boolabong , Boscobel had punched the Chinaman ’s head . “
43061	43074	43054	43054	You	1302	” Jerry said to Nokes , when they reached the yard gate . “
43104	43105	43083	43083	you	1302	” “
43214	43396	43201	43201	they	1255	” Georgie grumbled when he heard this , but he knew that the advice given him was good , and he did not attempt to enter the house . So Nokes and he vanished , away into the bush together — as such men do vanish — wandering forth to live as the wild beasts live . It was still a dark night when they went , and the remainder of the party took themselves to their beds . On the following afternoon they were lying about the house , sometimes sleeping , and sometimes waking up to smoke , when the two policemen , who had already been at Gangoil , appeared in the yard . These men were dressed in flat caps , with short blue jackets , hunting breeches , and long black boots — very unlike any policemen in the old country , and much more picturesque . They leisurely tied their horses up , as though they had been in the habit of making weekly visits to the place , and walked round to the veranda . “
43407	43583	43399	43400	Mr. Brownbie	83	” said the sergeant to the old man . The head of the family was gracious , and declared himself to be pretty well , considering all things . He called the sergeant by his name , and asked the men whether they ’d take a bit of something to eat . Joe also was courteous , and , after a little delay in getting a key from his brother , brought out the jar of spirits , which , in the bush , is regarded as the best sign known of thorough good - breeding . The sergeant said that he did n’t mind if he did ; and the other man , of course , followed his officer ’s example . So far every thing was comfortable , and the constables seemed in no hurry to allude to disagreeable subjects . They condescended to eat a bit of cold meat before they proceeded to business . And at last the matter to be discussed was first introduced by one of the Brownbie family . “
43598	43649	43586	43586	you	1310	” said Joe . The Brownbie party present consisted of the old man , Joe and Jack Brownbie , and Boscobel , Jerry keeping himself in the background because of his disfigurement . The sergeant , as he swallowed his food , acknowledged that he had heard something about it . “
43658	43662	43655	43655	you	1310	” continued Joe . “
43670	43675	43676	43676	I	0	” said old Brownbie . “
43683	43688	43680	43681	Mr. Brownbie	83	” said the sergeant . “
43706	43783	43693	43693	We	1311	” Sergeant Forrest was a graduate of Oxford , the son of an English clergyman , who , having his way to make in the world , had thought that an early fortune would be found in the colonies . He had come out , had failed , had suffered some very hard things , and now , at the age of thirty - five , enjoyed life thoroughly as a sergeant of the colonial police . “
43798	43802	43794	43794	I	0	” said Joe . “
43813	43817	43794	43794	I	0	” said Jack , “
43833	43834	43827	43827	you	83	” “
43841	43846	43839	43839	Jack	78	” said his brother . “
43860	43975	43847	43848	Sergeant Forrest	96	” Then the sergeant asked a string of questions as to the nature of the fight ; who had been hurt ; and how badly had any body been hurt ; and what other harm had been done . The answers to all these questions were given with a fair amount of truth , except that the little circumstance of the origin of the fire was not explained . Both Boscobel and Joe had seen the torch put down , but it could hardly have been expected that they should have been explicit as to such a detail as that . Nor did they mention the names of either their brother George or Nokes . “
43984	43989	43847	43848	Sergeant Forrest	96	” asked the sergeant . “
44063	44064	44036	44036	They	1316	” “
44071	44072	44036	44036	They	1316	” “
44124	44125	44119	44119	he	43	” “
44132	44149	44119	44119	he	43	” Of course they all knew that the sergeant knew that Nokes had been with them . “
44159	44164	44165	44166	Bill Nokes	58	” said old Brownbie . “
44199	44200	44194	44194	he	65	” “
44210	44214	44215	44216	Every body	1260	” said Jack . “
44242	44243	44231	44231	he	65	” “
44255	44259	44245	44245	he	65	” said Joe . “
44327	44328	44318	44318	us	1331	” “
44334	44357	44332	44332	Nokes	58	” asked the sergeant , paying no attention to the application made by Mr. Brownbie , junior , for redress to himself . “
44360	44364	44365	44365	Nokes	58	” said Joe , “
44373	44374	44375	44375	He	65	” “
44383	44384	44375	44375	He	65	” “
44390	44394	44385	44385	I	0	” said Joe . “
44407	44412	44404	44404	you	0	” said the sergeant . “
44422	44423	44413	44414	A man	128	” “
44433	44437	44428	44429	young Heathcote	65	” demanded Jack . “
44532	44533	44530	44530	he	65	” “
44541	44545	44534	44534	He	65	” said Joe . “
44567	44568	44559	44559	We	1341	” “
44574	44579	44559	44559	We	1341	” said the sergeant . “
44593	44615	44616	44616	He	65	” So the two policemen , with the two young Brownbies , rode away , leaving Boscobel with the old man . “
44623	44628	44616	44616	He	65	” said old Brownbie . “
44633	44637	44616	44616	He	65	” said Boscobel , “
44644	44645	44616	44616	He	65	” “
44652	44664	44616	44616	He	65	” said Jerry , coming out of his hiding - place . “
44686	44687	44688	44688	He	65	” “
44699	44705	44706	44706	Bother	98	” said the old man . “
44761	44998	44748	44748	Heathcote	65	” Sergeant Forrest inspected the ground on which the fire had raged , and the spot on which the men had met ; but nothing came of his inspection , and he had not expected that any thing would come of it . He could see exactly where the fire had commenced , and could trace the efforts that had been made to stop it . He did not in the least doubt the way in which it had been lit . But he did very much doubt whether a jury could find Nokes guilty , even if he could catch Nokes . Jacko ’s evidence was worth nothing , and Mr. Medlicot might be easily mistaken as to what he had seen at a distance in the middle of the night . All this happened on Christmas - day . At about nine o’clock the same evening the two constables re - appeared at Gangoil , and asked for hospitality for the night . This was a matter of course , and also the reproduction of the Christmas dinner . Mrs. Medlicot was now there , and her son , with his collar - bone set , had been allowed to come out on to the veranda . The house had already been supposed to be full , but room , as a matter of course , was made for Sergeant Forrest and his man . “
45015	45041	45012	45013	Mr. Heathcote	57	” said the sergeant , as the remnant of a real English plum - pudding was put between him and his man by Mrs. Growler . “
45053	45054	45012	45013	Mr. Heathcote	57	” “
45070	45071	45075	45075	sergeant	1335	” “
45092	45093	45077	45077	We	1348	” “
45107	45108	45111	45111	me	0	” “
45113	45118	45111	45111	me	0	” said Mrs. Medlicot . “
45147	45148	45150	45150	you	57	” “
45158	45162	45150	45150	you	57	” Harry asked . “
45233	45234	45225	45225	you	57	” “
45256	45257	45258	45258	He	1354	” “
45325	46488	46494	46494	him	1362	” After this the sergeant and his man discreetly allowed themselves to be put to bed in the back cottage ; for in truth , when they arrived , things had come to such a pass at Gangoil that the two additional visitors were hardly welcome . But hospitality in the bush can be stayed by no such considerations as that . Let their employments or enjoyments on hand be what they may , every thing must yield to the entertainment of strangers . The two constables were in want of their Christmas dinner , and it was given to them with no grudging hand . As to Nokes , we may say that he has never since appeared in the neighborhood of Gangoil , and that none thereabouts ever knew what was his fate . Men such as he wander away from one colony into the next , passing from one station to another , or sleeping on the ground , till they become as desolate and savage as solitary animals . And at last they die in the bush , creeping , we may suppose , into hidden nooks , as the beasts do when the hour of death comes on them . The constables had started from Gangoil , on their way to Boolabong , a little after four , and from that time till he was made to get out of bed for his dinner Harry Heathcote was allowed to sleep . He had richly earned his rest by his work , and he lay motionless , without a sound , in the broad daylight , with his arm under his head , dreaming , no doubt , of some happy squatting land , in which there were no free - selectors , no fires , no rebellious servants , no floods , no droughts , no wild dogs to worry the lambs , no grass seeds to get into the fleeces , and in which the price of wool stood steady at two shillings and sixpence a pound . His wife from time to time came into the room , shading the light from his eyes , protecting him from the flies , and administering in her soft way to what she thought might be his comforts . His sleep was of the kind which no light , nor even flies , can interrupt . Once or twice she stooped down and kissed his brow , but he was altogether unconscious of her caress . During this time old Mrs. Medlicot arrived ; but her coming did not awake the sleeper , though it was by no means made in silence . The old woman sobbed and cried over her son , at the same time expressing her thankfulness that he should have turned up in the forest so exactly at the proper moment , evidently taking part in the conviction that her Giles had saved Gangoil and all its sheep . And then there were all the necessary arrangements to be made for the night , in accordance with which almost every body had to give up his or her bed and sleep somewhere else . But nothing disturbed Harry . For the present he was allowed to occupy his own room , and he enjoyed the privilege . Kate Daly during this time was much disturbed in mind . The reader may remember — Kate , at any rate , remembered well — that , just as the doctor had arrived to set his broken bone , Mr. Medlicot , disabled as he was , had attempted to take her by the arm . He had certainly chosen an odd time for a declaration of love , just the moment in which he ought to have been preparing himself for the manipulation of his fractured limb ; but , unless he had meant a declaration of love , surely he would not have seized her by the arm . It was a matter to her of great moment . Oh , of what vital importance ! The English girl living in a town , or even in what we call the country , has no need to think of any special man till some special man thinks of her . Men are fairly plentiful , and if one man does not come , another will . And there have probably been men coming and going in some sort since the girl left her school - room and became a young lady . But in the bush the thing is very different . It may be that there is no young man available within fifty miles — no possible lover or future husband , unless Heaven should interfere almost with a miracle . To those to whom lovers are as plentiful as blackberries it may seem indelicate to surmise that the thought of such a want should ever enter a girl ’s head . I doubt whether the defined idea of any want had ever entered poor Kate ’s head . But now that the possible lover was there — not only possible , but very probable — and so eligible in many respects , living so close , with a house over his head and a good business ; and then so handsome , and , as Kate thought , so complete a gentleman ! Of course she turned it much in her mind . She was very happy with Harry Heathcote . There never was a brother - in - law so good ! But , after all , what is a brother - in - law , though he be the very best ? Kate had already begun to fancy that a house of her own and a husband of her own would be essential to her happiness . But then a man can not be expected to make an offer with a broken collar - bone — certainly can not do so just when the doctor has arrived to set the bone . Late on in the day , when the doctor had gone , and Medlicot was , according to instructions , sitting out on the veranda in an armchair , and his mother was with him , and while Harry was sleeping as though he never meant to be awake again , Kate managed to say a few words to her sister . It will be understood that the ladies ’ hands were by no means empty . The Christmas dinner was in course of preparation , and Sing Sing , that villainous Chinese cook , had absconded . Mrs. Growler , no doubt , did her best ; but Mrs. Growler was old and slow , and the house was full of guests . It was by no means an idle time ; but still Kate found an opportunity to say a word to her sister in the kitchen . “
46498	46503	46491	46491	you	1361	” To the married sister “
46505	46547	46548	46548	him	1362	” would naturally mean Harry Heathcote , of whom , as he lay asleep , the young wife thought that he was the very perfection of patriarchal pastoral manliness ; but she knew enough of human nature to be aware that the “
46549	46563	46564	46564	I	0	” of the moment to her sister was no longer her own husband . “
46590	46591	46585	46585	we	1363	” “
46635	46636	46608	46608	He	65	” “

46742	46743	46735	46735	I	0	” “
46752	46756	46744	46744	I	0	” said Kate . “

46939	46940	46934	46934	Kate	41	” “
46975	46976	46968	46968	I	0	” “
47017	47018	47019	47019	I	0	” “
47032	47033	47022	47022	Harry	65	” “
47045	47046	47022	47022	Harry	65	” “
47087	47088	47085	47085	Harry	65	” “
47098	47115	47085	47085	Harry	65	” said the wife , feeling that she had to apologize for her husband ’s prejudices . “
47160	47161	47162	47162	He	47	” “
47178	47179	47162	47162	He	47	” “
47240	47241	47233	47233	he	418	” “
47245	47287	47233	47233	he	418	” said Kate , giving her maidenly assurance when it was so much too late ! Just at this moment Mrs. Growler came into the kitchen , and Kate ’s promises and her sister ’s cautions were for the moment silenced . “
47310	47315	47301	47301	I	0	” said Mrs. Growler . “
47404	47672	47673	47673	We	1395	” All of which was very well understood to mean nothing at all . Household deficiencies — and , indeed , all deficiencies — are considerable or insignificant in accordance with the aspirations of those concerned . When a man has a regiment of servants in his dining - room , with beautifully cut glass , a forest of flowers , and an iceberg in the middle of his table if the weather be hot , his guests will think themselves ill used and badly fed if aught in the banquet be astray . There must not be a rose leaf ruffled ; a failure in the attendance , a falling off in a dish , or a fault in the wine is a crime . But the same guests shall be merry as the evening is long with a leg of mutton and whisky toddy , and will change their own plates , and clear their own table , and think nothing wrong , if from the beginning such has been the intention of the giver of the feast . In spite of Mrs. Growler ’s prognostications , though the cook had absconded , and the chief guest of the occasion could not cut up his own meat , that Christmas dinner at Gangoil was eaten with great satisfaction . Harry had been so far triumphant . He had stopped the fire that was intended to ruin him , he had beaten off his enemies on their own ground , and he was no longer oppressed by that sense of desolation which had almost overpowered him . “
47682	47704	47679	47680	Mrs. Medlicot	48	” he said , when Mrs. Growler and Kate between them had taken away the relics of the plum - pudding . “
47710	47721	47679	47680	Mrs. Medlicot	48	” The poor lady drank the toast with a sob . “
47768	47903	47904	47904	I	0	” Nevertheless , the old lady ate her dinner and drank her toddy , and made much of the occasion , going in and out to her son upon the veranda . Soon after dinner Heathcote , as was his wo nt , strayed out with his prime minister Bates to consult on the dangers which might be supposed still to threaten his kingdom , and Mrs. Heathcote , with her youngest boy in her lap , sat talking to Mrs. Medlicot in the parlor . Such was not her custom in weather such as this . Kate had been sent out on to the veranda , with special commands to attend to the wants of the sufferer , and Mrs. Heathcote would have followed her had she not remembered her sister ’s appeal , “
47913	48157	47904	47904	I	0	” In those happy days Kate had been very good , and certainly deserved requital for her services . And therefore , when the men had gone out , Mrs. Heathcote , with her guest , remained in the warm room , and went so far as to suggest that at that period of the day the room was preferable to the veranda . Poor Mrs. Medlicot was new to the ways of the bush , and fell into the trap ; thus Kate Daly was left alone with her wounded hero . When told to take him out his glass of wine , and when conscious that no one followed her , she felt herself to have been guilty of some great sin , and was almost tempted to escape . She had asked her sister for help ; and this was the help that was forth - coming — help so palpable , so manifest , as to be almost indelicate ! Would he think that plans were being made to catch him , now that he was a captive and impotent ? The thought that it was possible that such an idea might occur to him was terrible to her . She would rather lose him altogether than feel the stain of such a suggestion on her own conscience . She put the glass of wine down on the little table by his side , and then attempted to withdraw . “
48164	48168	47904	47904	I	0	” he said . “
48174	48175	48176	48176	Mary	40	” “
48196	48197	48185	48186	Mr. Bates	71	” “
48209	48210	48185	48186	Mr. Bates	71	” “
48262	48263	48249	48249	I	0	” “
48280	48281	48269	48269	I	0	” “
48285	48291	48292	48292	Kate	41	” asked Kate , blushing . “
48300	48301	48298	48298	Kate	41	” “
48307	48311	48302	48302	I	0	” she said . “
48339	48425	48327	48328	Dearest Kate	101	” His left arm was bound up , and was in a sling , but he put out his right hand to take hers , if she would give it to him . Kate Daly had never had a lover before , and felt the occasion to be trying . She had no doubt about the matter . If it were only proper for her to declare herself , she could swear with a safe conscience that she loved him better than all the world . “
48433	48456	48427	48427	your	41	” he said . As the request was not exactly for the gift of her hand , she placed it in his . “
48463	48478	48458	48458	I	0	” She could only whisper something which was quite inaudible , even to him . “
48507	48852	48853	48854	Mrs. Heathcote	42	” She hesitated for a moment , trying to collect her thoughts . She did love him , and was his own ; still , to stoop and kiss a man who , if such a thing were to be allowed at all , ought certainly to kiss her ! She did not think she could do that . But then she was bound to protect him , wounded and broken as he was , from his own imprudence ; and if she did not stoop to him , he would rise to her . She was still in doubt , still standing with her hand in his , half bending over him , but yet half resisting as she bent , when , all suddenly , Harry Heathcote was on the veranda , followed by the two policemen , who had just returned from Boolabong . She was sure that Harry had seen her , and was by no means sure that she had been quick enough in escaping from her lover ’s hand to have been unnoticed by the policemen also . She fled away as though guilty , and could hardly recover herself sufficiently to assist Mrs. Growler in producing the additional dinner which was required . The two men were quickly sent to their rest , as has been told before ; and Harry , who had in truth seen how close to his friend his sister - in - law had been standing , would , had it been possible , have restored the lovers to their old positions ; but they were all now on the veranda , and it was impossible . Kate hung back , half in and half out of the sitting - room , and old Mrs. Medlicot had seated herself close to her son . Harry was lying at full length on a rug , and his wife was sitting over him . Then Giles Medlicot , who was not quite contented with the present condition of affairs , made a little speech . “
48856	48860	48853	48854	Mrs. Heathcote	42	” he said , “
48870	48871	48861	48861	I	0	” “
48877	48932	48875	48875	Giles	47	” said Mrs. Medlicot . Kate remained no longer half in and half out of the parlor , but retreated altogether and hid herself . Harry turned himself over on the rug , and looked up at his wife , claiming infinite credit in that he had foreseen that such a thing might happen . “
48941	48946	48937	48937	she	1109	” said Mrs. Heathcote . “
48967	48968	48959	48959	you	42	” “
48979	48985	48970	48970	Kate	41	” replied the discreet sister . “
48994	49001	48986	48986	I	0	” said Harry , jumping up . “
49053	49054	49045	49045	I	0	” “
49061	49065	49059	49059	Nokes	58	” said Medlicot , “
49097	49098	49090	49090	Kate	41	” “
49136	49179	49130	49130	him	47	” So saying , he dragged her forth , and I fear that , as far as she was concerned , something of the sweetness of her courtship was lost by the publicity with which she was forced to confess her love . “
49231	49232	49237	49237	Kate	41	” “
49239	49253	49237	49237	Kate	41	” said Mrs. Heathcote , with her arm round her sister ’s waist . “
49263	49268	49256	49256	she	41	” said Mrs. Medlicot . “
49279	49342	49272	49272	Kate	41	” pleaded the lover . She came up to him and leaned over him , and whispered one word which nobody else heard . But they all knew what the word was . And before they separated for the night she was left alone with him , and he got the kiss for which he was asking when the policemen interrupted them . “
