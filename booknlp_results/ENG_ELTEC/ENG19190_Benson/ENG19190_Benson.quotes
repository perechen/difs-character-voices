525	531	532	532	she	263	" I stole this bun , "
536	546	532	532	she	263	" There is an uninterned German baker after me . "
547	555	557	558	Miss Ford	96	" And why did you steal it ? "
564	566	532	532	she	263	" why "
580	590	576	577	The Stranger	99	" Because I could n't afford to buy it . "
591	603	605	606	Miss Ford	96	" And why could you not afford to buy the bun ? "
608	616	605	606	Miss Ford	96	" A big strong girl like you . "
637	659	633	634	The Stranger	263	" Up till ten o'clock this morning I was of the leisured classes like yourselves . I had a hundred pounds . "
696	700	691	692	Lady Arabel	97	" too dretful . "
751	754	768	768	one	277	" set , "
772	780	782	783	Miss Ford	96	" You have squandered all that money ? "
785	792	782	783	Miss Ford	96	" Yes . In ten minutes . "
805	812	814	815	Miss Ford	96	" I am ashamed of you , "
817	856	814	815	Miss Ford	96	" I hope the baker will catch you . Do n't you know that your country is engaged in the greatest conflict in history ? A hundred pounds ... you might have put it in the War Loan . "
857	860	862	863	the Stranger	99	" Yes , "
865	876	862	863	the Stranger	99	" I did . That 's how I squandered it . "
911	916	917	917	she	96	" You behaved foolishly , "
920	953	917	917	she	96	" We are all too dretfully anxious to subscribe what we can spare to the War Loan , of course . But the State does not expect more than that of us . "
954	959	961	962	the Stranger	263	" God bless it , "
970	998	961	962	the Stranger	263	" Of course it does n't . But it is fun , do n't you think , when you are giving a present , to exceed expectations ? "
999	1003	1005	1006	Lady Arabel	97	" The State — "
1017	1034	1014	1015	Miss Ford	96	" Of course it 's all untrue . Do n't let her think we believe her . "
1053	1060	1061	1061	she	96	" You shall see the receipt , "
1096	1100	1101	1101	she	96	" Frightfully explosive , "
1104	1111	1113	1114	Miss Ford	96	" I believe you 're drunk , "
1139	1151	1152	1153	Lady Arabel	97	" Miss Hazeline Snow , The Bindles , Pymley , Gloucestershire . "
1183	1192	1193	1193	she	97	" So this is your name and address , "
1196	1199	1201	1202	the Stranger	263	" No , "
1205	1213	1215	1216	Lady Arabel	97	" This is your name and address , "
1220	1223	1225	1226	the Stranger	263	" No , "
1228	1249	1225	1226	the Stranger	263	" I made it up . Do n't you think ' The Bindles , Pymley , ' is too darling ? "
1250	1254	1256	1257	Miss Ford	96	" Quite drunk , "
1268	1279	1281	1282	Lady Arabel	97	" S — s — s — sh , Meta , "
1297	1317	1284	1284	She	97	" You gave a false name and address . My dear , I wonder if I can guess why . "
1318	1325	1327	1328	the Stranger	263	" I dare say you can , "
1330	1451	1327	1328	the Stranger	263	" It 's such fun , do n't you think , to get no thanks ? Do n't you sometimes amuse yourself by sending postal orders to people whose addresses look pathetic in the telephone book , or by forgetting to take away the parcels you have bought in poor little shops ? Or by standing and looking with ostentatious respect at boy scouts on the march , always bearing in mind that these , in their own eyes , are not little boys trotting behind a disguised curate , but British Troops on the Move ? Just two pleased eyes in a crowd , just a hundred pounds dropped from heaven into poor Mr. Bonar Law 's wistful hand .... "
1464	1469	1470	1470	she	96	" You amuse me , "
1534	1544	1545	1545	she	96	" Did n't you like what I was saying ? "
1554	1557	1559	1560	Miss Ford	96	" Oh ! "
1562	1579	1559	1560	Miss Ford	96	" You seem to be — if not drunk — suffering from some form of hysteria . "
1580	1591	1593	1594	the Stranger	263	" Do you think youth is a form of hysteria ? "
1596	1605	1593	1594	the Stranger	263	" Or hunger ? Or magic ? Or — "
1606	1621	1623	1624	Miss Ford	96	" Oh , do n't recite any more lists , for the Dear Sake ! "
1687	1718	1719	1719	she	96	" I wish you could see yourself , trying to be uplifting between the munches of a stolen bun . You 'd laugh too . But perhaps you never laugh , "
1726	1733	1735	1736	the Stranger	263	" How d'you mean — laugh ? "
1738	1761	1735	1736	the Stranger	263	" I did n't know that noise was called laughing . I thought you were just saying ' Ha — ha . ' "
1909	1918	1919	1919	she	96	" May I just finish with this applicant ? "
1938	1998	1919	1919	she	96	" It 's no use talking nonsense . We all see through you , you can not deceive a committee . But to a certain extent we believe your story , and are willing , if the case proves satisfactory , to give you a helping hand . I will take down a few particulars . First your name ? "
1999	2004	2006	2007	the Stranger	263	" M — m , "
2009	2048	2006	2007	the Stranger	263	" Let me see , you did n't like Hazeline Snow much , did you ? What d'you think of Thelma ... Thelma Bennett Watkins ? ... You know , the Rutlandshire Watkinses , the younger branch — — "
2056	2065	2052	2052	her	96	" But that is n't your real name . "
2066	2074	2076	2077	the Stranger	263	" How d'you mean — real name ? "
2080	2117	2076	2077	the Stranger	263	" Wo n't that do ? What about Iris ... Hyde ? ... You see , the truth is , I was never actually christened ... I was born a conscientious objector , and also — — "
2118	2129	2131	2132	Miss Ford	96	" Oh , for the Dear Sake , be silent ! "
2136	2141	2076	2077	the Stranger	263	" Thelma Bennett Watkins , "
2147	2167	2131	2132	Miss Ford	96	" This , I take it , is the name you gave at the time of the National Registration . "
2168	2172	2174	2175	the Stranger	263	" I forget , "
2177	2212	2174	2175	the Stranger	263	" I remember that I put down my trade as Magic , and they registered it on my card as ' Machinist . ' Yet Magic , I believe , is a starred profession . "
2213	2220	2222	2223	Miss Ford	96	" What is your trade really ? "
2225	2231	2233	2234	the Stranger	263	" I 'll show you , "
2601	2606	2591	2592	The Mayor	110	" Puss , Puss . "
2625	2642	2621	2622	The Mayor	306	" Splendid , miss , quite splendid . You 'd make a fortune on the stage . "
2766	2794	2750	2752	The sixth member	291	" Now you mention it , I think I 'll go down there again for the week - end . I can pawn my ear - rings . "
2925	2941	2917	2917	she	96	" Will you kindly answer my questions ? I asked you what your trade was . "
2942	2952	2954	2955	Lady Arabel	97	" It 's too dretful of me to interrupt , "
2958	2986	2987	2987	She	96	" But , do you know , Meta , I feel we are wasting this committee 's time . This young person needs no assistance from us . "
2996	3017	2987	2987	She	96	" My dear , I am dretfully ashamed . You must meet my son Rrchud .... My son Rrchud knows .... "
3029	3046	3047	3047	she	96	" I should like awfully to meet Rrchud , and to get to know you better , "
3055	3071	3050	3050	She	96	" I say , I should be awfully pleased if you would call me Angela . "
3102	3105	3107	3108	the Mayor	306	" Lawdy , "
3110	3140	3107	3108	the Mayor	306	" I did n't expect she 'd go out by the door , somehow . Look — she 's left some sort of hardware over there in the corner . "
3688	3691	3643	3645	The sixth member	291	" organising work "
3857	3871	3888	3891	the shop - lady	408	" Sorry , it 's no use waiting . I have n't any . "
4175	4184	4186	4187	Sarah Brown	115	" Is Miss Thelma Bennett Watkins at home ? "
4208	4211	4213	4214	the other	424	" No , "
4216	4273	4213	4214	the other	424	" But do take a seat . We met last night , you may remember . Perhaps you would n't mind lending me one - and - twopence to buy two chops for our luncheon . I 've got an extra coupon . There 's tinned salmon in stock , but I do n't advise it . "
4274	4288	4290	4291	Sarah Brown	115	" I 've only got sevenpence , just enough to take me home , "
4293	4303	4290	4291	Sarah Brown	115	" But I can pawn my ear - rings . "
4424	4429	4435	4435	she	115	" Now look here , "
4445	4503	4435	4435	she	115	" Would you mind telling me — are you a fairy , or a third - floor - back , or anything of that sort ? I wo n't register it , or put it on the case - paper , I promise , though if you are superhuman in any way I shall be seriously tempted . "
4504	4510	4512	4513	the witch	432	" I am a Witch , "
5028	5032	5034	5035	Sarah Brown	115	" A witch , "
5037	5070	5034	5035	Sarah Brown	115	" Of course . I have been trying to remember what broomsticks reminded me of . A witch , of course . I have always wished to be friends with a witch . "
5083	5108	5109	5109	She	432	" Oh , my Dear , do let 's . Do you know I had quite a crush on you from the first minute . "
5148	5169	5140	5140	she	432	" Of course I do n't believe friendship is an end in itself . Only a means to an end . "
5170	5179	5181	5182	the witch	432	" I do n't know what you mean , "
5194	5216	5181	5182	the witch	432	" Do tell me — do you know yourself , or are you just saying it to see what it means ? "
5231	5245	5226	5227	the witch	432	" I bet you twopence you do n't know what this place is . "
5246	5250	5252	5253	Sarah Brown	115	" A shop , "
5262	5273	5275	5276	the witch	432	" It is a sort of convent and monastery mixed , "
5278	5309	5275	5276	the witch	432	" I am connected with it officially . I undertook to manage it , yet I forget what the proper word for me is . Not undertaker , is it ? "
5310	5315	5317	5318	Sarah Brown	115	" Superintendent or secretary , "
5321	5327	5329	5330	the witch	432	" Superintendent , I think , "
5332	5347	5329	5330	the witch	432	" At least I know Peony calls me Soup . Do you live alone ? "
5348	5351	5275	5276	the witch	432	" Yes . "
5352	5388	5389	5389	She	432	" Then you ought to live here . This is the only place in the world of its kind . The name of this house is Living Alone . I 'll read you the prospectus . "
5450	5457	5459	5460	the witch	432	" My employer made up this , "
5462	5472	5459	5460	the witch	432	" And the ferryman wrote it out for us . "
5947	5955	5957	5958	Sarah Brown	115	" It certainly sounds an unusual place , "
5960	5967	5957	5958	Sarah Brown	115	" Is the house always full ? "
5968	5971	5973	5974	the witch	432	" Never , "
5976	5999	6000	6000	She	432	" A lot of people can swallow everything but the last clause . We have at present one guest , called Peony . "
6050	6059	6060	6060	she	432	" What do you do with your magic ? "
6063	6103	6060	6060	she	432	" Oh , many things . Chiefly I use it as an ingredient for happiness , sometimes to remind people , and sometimes to make them forget . It seems to me that some people take happiness rather tragically . "
6104	6108	6110	6111	Sarah Brown	115	" I find , "
6116	6130	6110	6111	Sarah Brown	115	" that I always owe my happiness to earth , never to heaven . "
6131	6137	6139	6140	the witch	432	" How d'you mean heaven ? "
6142	6190	6139	6140	the witch	432	" I know nothing about heaven . When I used to work in the City , I bought a little book about heaven to read in the Tube every morning . I thought I should grow daily better . But I could n't see that I did . "
6286	6306	6307	6307	she	115	" Heaven has given me wretched health , but never gave me youth enough to make the wretchedness adventurous , "
6311	6535	6307	6307	she	115	" Heaven gave me a thin skin , but never gave me the natural and comforting affections . Heaven probably meant to make a noble woman of me by encrusting me in disabilities , but it left out the necessary nobility at the last moment ; it left out , in fact , all the compensations . But luckily I have found the compensations for myself ; I just had to find something . Men and women have given me everything that such as I could expect . I have never met with reasonless enmity , never met with meanness , never met with anything more unbearable than natural indifference , from any man or woman . I have been , I may say , a burden and a bore all over the world ; I have been an ill and fretful stranger within all men 's gates ; I have asked much and given nothing ; I have never been a friend . Nobody has ever expected any return from me , yet nothing was grudged . Landladies , policemen , chorus girls , social bounders , prostitutes , the natural enemies , one would say , of such as I , have given me kindness , and often much that they could not easily spare , and always amusement and distraction .... "
6536	6546	6548	6549	the witch	432	" Ah , how you interest and excite me , "
6558	6572	6548	6549	the witch	432	" You are exactly the sort of person we want in this house . "
6573	6578	6580	6581	Sarah Brown	115	" But — ill ? "
6584	6634	6580	6581	Sarah Brown	115	" Oh , witch , I have been so wearisome to every one , so constantly ill . The first thing I get to know about a new hostess or a landlady is always the colour of her dressing - gown by candlelight , or whether she has one . "
6635	6642	6644	6645	the witch	432	" Illnesses are never bad here , "
6647	6677	6644	6645	the witch	432	" I bet you twopence I 've got something in the shop that would make you well . Three fingers of happiness , neat and hot , at night — "
6678	6707	6548	6549	the witch	432	" But , witch — oh , witch — this is the worst of all . My ears are failing me — I think I am going deaf .... "
6708	6716	6718	6719	the witch	432	" You can hear what I say , "
6721	6769	6718	6719	the witch	432	" Yes , I can hear what you say , but when most people talk I am like a prisoner locked up ; and every day there are more and more locked doors between me and the world . You do not know how horrible it is . "
6770	6775	6777	6778	the witch	432	" Oh , well , "
6780	6821	6777	6778	the witch	432	" as long as you can hear magic you will not lack a key to your prison . Sometimes it 's better not to hear the other things . You are the ideal guest for the House of Living Alone . "
6822	6838	6840	6841	Sarah Brown	115	" I 'll go and fetch David my Dog and Humphrey my Suit - case , "
6869	6885	6861	6862	the ferryman	1384	" All right , all right , I 'll be there in half a tick . "
6886	6897	6899	6900	the witch	432	" I hope this is n't Peony in a taxi , "
6902	6924	6899	6900	the witch	432	" I get so tired of expelling guests . She 's been drawing her money , which may have been tempting . "
6950	6973	6942	6945	Miss Meta Mostyn Ford	96	" Do you know anything about a young woman of the name of Watkins , living at Number 100 Beautiful Way — — "
6974	6981	6983	6984	the witch	432	" No , he does n't , "
6991	7040	6983	6984	the witch	432	" But do step in . We met yesterday , you may remember . I 'll ask the ferryman to get half - a - dozen halfpenny buns for tea , if you will be so kind as to lend me threepence . We do n't bake ourselves . "
7041	7050	7052	7053	Miss Ford	96	" I have had tea , thank you , "
7055	7093	7094	7094	She	96	" I have just come from a little gathering of friends on the other side of the river , and I thought I would call here on my way home . I had noted your address — — "
7112	7135	7108	7108	her	96	" I had noted your address , because I never mind how much trouble I take in following up a promising case . "
7176	7190	7192	7193	the witch	432	" How good of you to go to a little gathering of friends , "
7205	7268	7192	7193	the witch	432	" I never do , except now and then by mistake . And even then I only stay when there are grassy sandwiches to eat . Once there were grassy sandwiches mixed with bits of hard - boiled egg , and then I stayed to supper . You did n't have such luck , I see , or you would look happier . "
7269	7286	7288	7289	Miss Ford	96	" I do n't go to my friends for their food , but for their ideas , "
7299	7306	7308	7309	the witch	432	" Oh , do n't go , "
7321	7379	7308	7309	the witch	432	" I have sent Harold the Broomstick for your Dog David and your Suit - case Humphrey . He is an excellent packer and very clean in his person and work . Please , please , do n't go . Do you know , I live in constant dread of being left alone with a clever person . "
7380	7392	7394	7395	Miss Ford	96	" I must apologise for my intrusion , in that case , "
7400	7416	7394	7395	Miss Ford	96	" I repeat , I only came because I saw yours was an exceptional case . "
7539	7544	7546	7547	Miss Ford	96	" Oh , God , "
7549	7622	7546	7547	Miss Ford	96	" I have come because I am hungry , hungry for what you spoke of last night , in the dark .... You spoke of an April sea — clashing of cymbals was the expression you used , was n't it ? You spoke of a shore of brown diamonds flat to the ruffled sea ... and white sandhills under a thin veil of grass ... and tamarisks all blown one way .... "
7623	7626	7628	7629	the witch	432	" Well ? "
7631	7634	7628	7629	the witch	432	" Well , "
7639	7667	7636	7637	Miss Ford	96	" I think I came to ask you ... whether you knew of nice lodgings there ... plain wholesome bath ... respectable cooking , hot and cold ... "
7702	7711	7713	7714	Miss Ford	96	" I am so sorry , Miss Watkins , "
7732	7777	7778	7778	She	96	" I am so sorry if I have talked nonsense . I am rather run down , I think , too much work , four important meetings yesterday . I sometimes think I shall break down . I have such alarming nerve - storms . "
7875	7881	7883	7884	Miss Ford	96	" You must not think , "
7886	8025	7883	7884	Miss Ford	96	" that because I am a practical worker I have no understanding of Inner Meanings . On the contrary , I have perhaps wasted too much of my time on spiritual matters . That is why I take quite a personal and special interest in your case . I had a great friend , now in the trenches , alas , who possessed Power . He used to come to my Wednesdays — at least I used to invite him to come , but he was dreamy like you and constantly mistook the date . He helped me enormously , and I miss him .... Well , the truest charity should be anything but formal , I think , and I saw at a glance that your case was exceptional , and that you also were Occult — — "
8026	8033	8035	8036	the witch	432	" How d'you mean — occult ? "
8038	8046	8035	8036	the witch	432	" Do you mean just knowing magic ? "
8047	8052	8054	8055	Miss Ford	96	" A strange mixture , "
8071	8158	8035	8036	the witch	432	" A strange and rather interesting mixture of naïveté and power . The question is — power to what extent ? Miss Watkins , I want you to come to one of my Wednesdays to meet one or two people who might possibly help you to a job — lecturing , you know . Lectures on hypnotism or spiritualism , with experiments , are always popular . You certainly have Power , you only want a little advertisement to be a real help to many people . "
8159	8166	8168	8169	the witch	432	" How d'you mean — advertisement ? "
8171	8239	8168	8169	the witch	432	" This new advertisement stunt is one of the problems that tire my head . I am awfully worried by problems . The world seems to be ruled by posters now . People look to the hoardings for information about their duty . Why do n't we paste up the ten commandments on all the walls and all the ' buses , and be done with it ? "
8240	8247	8249	8250	Miss Ford	96	" Now listen , Miss Watkins , "
8252	8307	8249	8250	Miss Ford	96	" I want you to meet Bernard Tovey , the painter , and Ivy MacBee , who founded the Aspiration Club , and Frere , the editor of I Wonder , and several other regular Wednesday friends of mine , all interested in the Occult . It would be a real opportunity for you . "
8308	8320	8322	8323	the witch	432	" I am afraid you will be very angry with me , "
8330	8374	8322	8323	the witch	432	" If I was occult last night — I 'm awfully sorry , but it must have been a fluke . I seem to have said so much last night without knowing it . I 'm afraid I was showing off a little . "
8393	8399	8386	8386	she	432	" Do you live alone ? "
8400	8405	8407	8408	Miss Ford	96	" Yes , absolutely , "
8410	8439	8407	8408	Miss Ford	96	" My friends call me a perfect hermit . I hardly ever have visitors in my spare room , it makes so much work for my three maids . "
8440	8458	8460	8461	the witch	432	" I suppose you would n't care to divorce your three maids and come and live here , "
8463	8532	8460	8461	the witch	432	" I could of course cure you of the nerve - storms you speak of . Or rather I could help you to have nerve - storms all the time , without any stagnant grown - upness in between . Then you would n't notice the nerve - storms . This house is a sort of nursing home and college combined . I 'll read you the prospectus . "
8533	8537	8539	8540	Miss Ford	96	" Very amusing , "
8580	8617	8557	8557	She	96	" But why all those uncomfortable rules ? And why that discouragement of social intercourse ? I am afraid the average person of the class you cater for does not recognise the duty of social intercourse . "
8618	8622	8624	8625	the witch	432	" This house , "
8627	8693	8624	8625	the witch	432	" caters for people who are outside averages . The ferryman says that people who are content to be average are lowering the general standard . I wish you could have met Peony , the only guest up to now , but she is out , and may be a teeny bit drunk when she comes in . She has gone to draw her money . "
8694	8700	8702	8703	Miss Ford	96	" What sort of money ? "
8718	8726	8730	8731	Miss Ford	96	" Soldier 's allotment . Unmarried wife . "
8748	8760	8761	8761	she	96	" And how do you make your boarding - house pay , "
8764	8773	8761	8761	she	96	" if there is no charge for residence ? "
8774	8781	8783	8784	the witch	432	" How d'you mean — pay ? "
8786	8884	8783	8784	the witch	432	" Pay whom ? And what with ? Look here , if you will come and live here you shall have a little Wednesday every week on the stairs , under license from me . Harold the Broomstick is apt to shirk cleaning the stairs , but as it happens , he is keeping company with an O - Cedar Mop in Kentish Town , and I 've no doubt she would come over and do the stairs thoroughly every Tuesday night . Besides , we have overalls in stock at only two and eleven three — — "
8885	8894	8896	8897	Miss Ford	96	" Oh , I like your merry mood , "
8902	8950	8896	8897	Miss Ford	96	" You must remember to talk like that when you come to my Wednesdays . Most of my friends are utter Socialists , and believe in bridging as far as possible the gulf between one class and another , so you need n't feel shy or awkward . "
8987	9011	8981	8982	The ferryman	1384	" I do n't know any party of that name , but I believe the young woman at the shop can help you . "
9019	9107	9012	9014	Lady Arabel Higgins	97	" What , Meta , you here ? And Sarah Brown ? What a too dretfully funny coincidence . Well , Angela dear , I made a note of your address yesterday , and then lost the note — too dretfully like me . So I rang up the Mayor , and he said he also had made a note , and he would come and show me the way . But I did n't wait for him . I wanted to talk to you about — — "
9108	9117	9119	9120	Sarah Brown	115	" Well , I must truly be going , "
9122	9142	9119	9120	Sarah Brown	115	" I 'll just nip across to the Brown Borough and find a pawn - shop , being hungry . "
9143	9157	9159	9160	Lady Arabel	97	" There is no need for any one to move on my account , "
9162	9248	9249	9249	She	97	" You all heard what Angela said last night in her little address to the committee in the dark . I do n't know why she addressed her remarks particularly at me , but as she did so , there is no secret in the matter . Of course , just at first , it seemed dretful to me that any one should know or speak about it . I can not understand how you knew , Angela ; I am trying not to understand .... "
9272	9521	9249	9249	She	97	" Yes , it is true that Rrchud is n't like other women 's boys . You know it , Meta . Angela evidently knows it , and — at least since yesterday — I know that I know it . His not being able to read or write — I always knew in my heart that my old worn - out tag — ' We ca n't all be literary geniuses ' — did n't meet the case . His way of disappearing and never explaining .... Do you know , I have only once seen him with other boys , doing the same as other boys , and that was when I saw him marching with hundreds of real boys ... in 1914 .... It was the happiest day I ever had , I thought after all that I had borne a real boy . Well , then , as you know , he could n't get a commission , could n't even get his stripe , poor darling . He deserted twice — pure absence of mind — it was always the same from a child — ' I wanted to see further , ' he 'd say , and of course worse in the trenches . Why , you know it all , Angela dear — at least , perhaps not quite all . I should like to tell you — because you said that about the splendour of being the mother of Rrchud .... "
10055	10056	10057	10057	You	557	" "
10063	10141	10057	10057	You	557	" said the witch . Lady Arabel did not seem to hear . For a long time there was nothing to be heard but Sarah Brown , murmuring to her Dog David . You must excuse her , and remember that she lived most utterly alone . She was locked inside herself , and the solitary barred window in her prison wall commanded only a view of the Dog David . Rrchud 's mother said at last : "
10165	10166	10160	10160	you	557	" "
10170	10175	10160	10160	you	557	" exclaimed Miss Ford . "
10207	10222	10192	10192	she	104	" Lady Arabel , ignoring Miss Ford by mistake , said to the witch : "
10233	10234	10224	10224	you	557	" "
10239	10260	10224	10224	you	557	" said the witch instantly . Tact , I repeat , was a stranger to her , so she added : "
10282	11005	10272	10272	she	115	" And then the Mayor arrived . The witch saw at once that there was some secret understanding between him and her that she did not understand . Her magic escapades often left her in this position . However , she winked back hopefully . But she was not a skilled winker . Everybody — even the Dog David — saw her doing it , and Miss Ford looked a little offended . Mitten Island is a place of fine weather , its air is always like stained glass between you and perfection . Always you will find in the happy ways of Mitten Island a confidence that the worst is left behind , and that even the worst was not so very bad . You can afford to remember the winter , for even the winter was beautiful ; you can smile in the sun and think of the grey flush that used to overspread the island under its urgent crises of snow , and it seems that always there was joy running quickly behind the storms , joy looking with the sun through a tall window in a cloud . Even the most dreadful curtain of a winter 's day was always drawn up at sunset ; its straight edge rose slowly , disclosing flaming space , and the dramatic figures of the two island churches , exulting and undying martyrs in the midst of flames . It is a place of fine weather , and this is a book of fine weather , a book written in Spring . I will not remember the winter and the rain . It was the Spring that brought Sarah Brown to Mitten Island , and the Spring that first showed her magic . It was the Spring that awoke her on her first morning in the House of Living Alone . She awoke because it was so beautiful outside , and because there was a beautiful day coming . You could see the day secretly making preparations behind a shining mist . She heard a sound of breathless singing , and the whipping of stirred grass in the garden , the sound of some one unbearably happy , dancing . Now there is hardly anything but magic abroad before seven o'clock in the morning . Only the disciples of magic like getting their feet wet , and being furiously happy on an empty stomach . Sarah Brown went to her window . The newborn trembling slants of smoke went up from the houses of the island . There was a sky of that quiet design which suffices half a day unchanged . A garden of quite a good many yards lay behind the house ; it contained no potatoes or anything useful , only long , very green grass , and a may tree , and a witch dancing . The extraordinary music to which she was dancing was partly the braying of a neighbouring donkey , and partly her own erratic singing . She danced , as you may imagine , in a very far from grown - up way , rather like a baby that has thought of a new funny way of annoying its Nana ; and she sang , too , like a child that inadvertently bursts into loud tuneless song , because it is morning and yet too early to get up . A little wandering of the voice , a little wandering of the feet .... The may tree in the middle of the garden seemed to be her partner . A small blot moved up and down the chequered trunk of the tree , and that was the shadow of a grey squirrel , watching the dancing . The squirrel wore the same fur as the two - and - a - half - guinea young lady wears , and sometimes it looked with a tilted head at the witch , and sometimes it buried its face in its hands and sat for a while shaken with secret laughter . There was certainly something more funny than beautiful about the witch 's dancing . She laughed herself most of the time . She was wearing a mackintosh , which was in itself rather funny , but her feet were bare . A voice broke in : "
11012	11408	11010	11010	cully	573	" It was Sarah Brown 's fellow - lodger leaning from her window . The squirrel rippled higher up the may tree . The pleasure of the thing broke like an eggshell . Sarah Brown turned back towards her bed . It was too early to get up . It was too late to go to sleep again . Eunice , her hot - water bottle , she knew , lay cold as a serpent to shock her feet if she returned . Besides , the Dog David was asleep on the middle of the counterpane , and she was too good a mother to wake him . There are a good many things to do when you find yourself awake too early . It is said that some people sit up and darn their stockings , but I refer now to ordinary people , not to angels . Utterly resourceless people find themselves reduced to reading the penny stamps on yesterday 's letters . There is a good deal of food for thought on a penny stamp , but nothing really uplifting . Some people I know employ this morning leisure in scrubbing their consciences clean , thus thriftily making room for the sins of the coming day . But Sarah Brown 's conscience was dreadfully receptive , almost magnetic ; little sins like smuts lay always deep upon it . There were a few regrettable seconds in every minute she lived , I think , though she never enjoyed the compensations attached to a really considerable sin . Anyway her conscience would have been a case for pumice - stone , and when she was happy she always tried to forget it . Yet she was not without a good many very small and unessential resources for sleepless moments . Often she wrote vague comments on matters with which she was not familiar , in an exercise - book , always eventually mislaid . She would awake from dear and unspeakable dreams full of hope , and tell herself stories about herself , trying on various lives and deaths like clothes . The result was never likely enough even to laugh at . To - day she had watched magic dancing in a mackintosh , and she was at a loss . There was a knock upon her door , and a voice : "
11438	11439	11429	11429	I	0	" "
11444	11453	11442	11442	I	0	" said Sarah Brown , opening the door . "
11459	11460	11455	11455	I	0	" "
11469	11476	11467	11467	Cuffbut	132	" said the fellow - lodger . "
11546	11547	11535	11535	I	0	" "
11556	11557	11552	11554	the other lodger	578	" "
11564	11727	11552	11554	the other lodger	578	" Peony was not in her first youth , in fact she was comfortably into her second . Her voice was so beautiful that it almost made one shy , but her choice of language , tending as it did in the other direction , reassured one . She had fine eyes of an absolute grey , and dark hair parted in the middle and drawn down so as to make a triangle of a face which , left to itself , would have been square . Her teeth spoilt her ; the gaps among them looked like the front row of the stalls during the first scene of a revue , or the last scene of a play by Shakspere . On the whole , she looked like the duckling of the story , serenely conscious of a secret swanhood . She showed unnatural energy even in repose , and lived as though she had a taxi waiting at the door . "
11732	11756	11730	11730	Elbert	133	" asked Sarah Brown , and then wished she had not asked , for even without Peony 's flush she should have guessed . "
11798	11853	11789	11789	I	0	" Harold the Broomstick was desultorily sweeping the stairs . He worked harder when first conscious of being watched , but seeing that they intended to stay there , on the top step , he made this the excuse to disappear indolently , leaving little heaps of dust on several of the lower steps . "
11868	11894	11895	11895	Elbert	133	" said Peony , when Sarah Brown , in rather a loud dressing - gown , had taken her seat on the stairs beside her . "
14583	14758	14580	14580	e	0	" Well , dearie , take it ' ow you will , thet 's ' ow I met my Sherrie . A magic man ' e was , for ' e ' ad my ticket taken , an ' never seemed surprised . Ten days leave ' e ' ad , an ' we spent it at an inn in a village on a moor , jest a mile out o ' sound of the sea . The moor an ' the sea , touchin ' each other . ... Oh Gawd ! ... The sea was like my sky at night come nearer — come near enough to know better , like . In between the moor an ' the sea there was the beach — it looked like a blessed boundary road between two countries , an ' it led away to where you could n't see nothing more except a little white town , sort of built ' igh upon a mist , more like a star .... Oh Gawd ! ... "
14939	14966	14931	14931	e	674	" She spoke of Sherrie as a naturalist would speak of a new animal , gradually finding out the pretty and amusing ways of the creature . "
15318	15319	15313	15313	e	674	" "
15325	15330	15323	15323	Sherrie	145	" asked Sarah Brown . "
15376	15377	15336	15336	e	674	" "
15383	15388	15336	15336	e	674	" said Sarah Brown . "
15394	15398	15336	15336	e	674	" repeated Peony . "
15457	16057	16070	16070	She	694	" While Sarah Brown 's unenviable leisure was spent in acting as slave to committees , she had at the same time a half - time profession which , when she was well enough to follow it , brought twenty shillings a week to her pocket . She was in the habit of sitting every morning in a small office , collecting evidence from charitable spies about the Naughty Poor , and , after wrapping the evidence in mysterious ciphers , writing it down very beautifully upon little cards , so that the next spy might have the benefit of all his forerunners ' experience . Sarah Brown never thought about the theory of this work , because the different coloured inks and the beautiful writing pleased her so . There are people to whom a ream of virgin paper is an inspiration , who find the first sharpening of a pencil the most lovable of all labours , who see something almost holy in the dedication of green and red penholders to their appropriate inks , in whose ears and before whose eyes the alphabet is like a poem or a prayer . Touch on stationery and you touched an insane spot in Sarah Brown 's mind . Her dream of a perfect old age was staged in a stationer 's shop in a quiet brown street ; there she would spend twilit days in stroking thick blotting - paper , in drawing dogs — all looking one way — with new pen - nibs , in giving advice in a hushed voice to connoisseur customers , who should come to buy a diary or a book - plate or a fountain - pen with the same reverence as they now show who come to buy old wine . Therefore Sarah Brown 's hand had found ideal employment on a charity register . As for her mind , it usually shut its eye during office hours . Her Dog David liked the work too , as the hearth - rug was a comfortable one , and Charity , though it may suffer long in other directions , is rather particular about its firing . On the Monday after her change of home , Sarah Brown found that the glory had gone out of the varied inks , and even a new consignment of index - cards , exquisitely unspotted from the world , failed to arouse her enthusiasm . This was partly because the first name in the index that she looked up was that of Watkins , Thelma Bennett , single , machinist . The ciphers informed the initiated that Watkins had called on the War Association , to ask for Help and Advice , See Full Report . Sarah Brown felt sad and clumsy , and made two blots , one in green on the Watkins card , and the other in ordinary Stephens - colour on the card of one Tonk , chocolate - box - maker , single , to whom a certain charity was obstinately giving a half - pint of milk daily , regardless of the fact that last month she had received a shilling's - worth of groceries from the Parish . The air of that office rang with the name of Tonk that morning . Hardly had the industrious Sarah Brown finished turning the blot upon her card into the silhouette of a dromedary by a few ingenious strokes of the pen , when the lady representing the obstinate charity came in , her lips shaped to the word Tonk . "
16060	16064	16070	16070	She	694	" she said . "
16136	16137	16131	16131	you	699	" "
16148	16154	16138	16138	Our	698	" answered Sarah Brown coldly . "
16190	16191	16192	16192	Tonk	147	" "
16199	16223	16192	16192	Tonk	147	" said the Happy Heart delicately in an undertone , so that the blushing masculine ear of the Dog David might be spared . "
16252	16253	16255	16255	you	699	" "
16272	16292	16260	16260	Tonk	147	" Sarah Brown was rapidly becoming exasperated with everybody concerned , but not least with the evidently camouflaging Tonk . "
16301	16307	16293	16293	She	700	" said the Happy Heart . "
16333	16354	16355	16355	I	0	" Sarah Brown wrote down on Miss Tonk 's card the small purple cipher that stood for hm — hm . "
16363	16389	16355	16355	I	0	" she said . But that was not the last of Tonk . Presently the red face of the Relieving Officer loomed over the index . "
16396	16401	16394	16394	Plummett	150	" he began loudly . "
16408	16469	16406	16406	Tonk	147	" interrupted Sarah Brown , to whom , in her present mood , Plummett could only have been a last straw . She hated the Relieving Officer unjustly , because he knew she was deaf and raised his voice , with the best intentions , to such a degree that the case papers on the index were occasionally blown away . "
16502	16503	16504	16504	We	705	" "
16509	16515	16504	16504	We	705	" roared the Relieving Officer . "
16523	16524	16521	16521	Plummett	150	" "
16531	16536	16529	16529	Tonk	147	" persisted Sarah Brown . "
16552	16553	16545	16545	you	706	" "
16666	16667	16657	16658	The children	714	" "
16675	16692	16693	16693	I	0	" asked Sarah Brown , who had been a changed woman since Mitten Island was mentioned . "
16758	16759	16738	16738	She	700	" "
16765	16770	16763	16763	P	152	" said Sarah Brown . "
16781	17353	17354	17354	I	0	" The Relieving Officer went away , for it was dinner - time . Sarah Brown absently unwrapped the little dinner which she had brought hanging by a thin string from a strangled finger . Mustard sandwiches with just a flavouring of ham , and a painfully orthodox 1918 - model bun , made of stubble . Sarah Brown almost always forgot the necessity of food until she was irrevocably in the ' bus on her way to work . But this morning , as she had taken her seat with David in the bouncing ferry - boat , there had been a panting rustling noise behind her , and Harold the Broomstick had swept a little packet of sandwiches into her lap . He had disappeared before she had been able to do more than turn over in her mind the question whether or no broomsticks ever expect to be tipped . Now I could not say with certainty whether the witch , in making up this packet of sandwiches , had included the contents of one of her own little packets of magic . Sarah Brown would have been very susceptible to such a drug ; her mind was always on the brink of innocent intoxication . Perhaps she was only half a woman , so that half a joy could make her heart reel and sing , and half a sorrow break it . She was defenceless against impressions , and too many impressions make the heart very tired . Therefore , I think , she was a predestined victim of magic , and it seems unlikely that the witch should have missed such an opportunity to dispense spells . After the first bite at the first sandwich , Sarah Brown was conscious of a Joke somewhere . This feeling in itself was akin to delirium , for there are no two facts so remote as a Joke and a Charity Society . The office table confronted Sarah Brown , and she wondered that she could ever have seen it as anything but a butt . She wondered how she had been able to sit daily in front of that stout and earnest index without poking it in the ribs and making a fool of it . The office clock , alone among clocks , had never played a practical joke . The sad fire below it , conscious of a Mission , was overloaded with coal and responsibility . The second bite , ten minutes later , caused Sarah Brown to be tired and distrustful of a room that had no smile . Her eyes turned to seek the hidden Joke beyond the limits of that lamentable room . There was a spring - coloured tree in the school - ground opposite , and above the tree a rough blue and silver sky contradicted all the doctrines preached in offices . There was in the wind something of the old raw simplicity and mirth that always haunts the sea , and penetrates inland only on rare spring days . The high white clouds crossed the sky like galleons , like old stories out of the innocent Eden - like past of the sea , before she learnt the ways of steam and secret killing . Old names of ships came to Sarah Brown 's mind ... Castle - of - Comfort ... Cloud - i'-the - Sun .... "
17359	17535	17354	17354	I	0	" said Sarah Brown . She took a third bite . And then she felt the spirit of the Naughty Poor in the room ; there was laughter , as of the registered , in the ears of the Registrar . It is not really permissible for the Naughty Poor to invade offices which exist to do them good . The way of charity lies through suspicion , but the suspicion of course must be all on one side . We have to judge the criminal unheard ; if we called him as a witness in his case we might become sentimental . The Charity Society may be imagined as keeping two lists of crimes , a short one for Registrars and Workers , and a very long one for the registered . High on the list of crimes possible to Registrars and Workers is Sentimentality . It is sentimental to feel personal affection for a Case , or to give a child of the Naughty Poor a penny without full enquiry , or to say "
17539	17670	17671	17671	I	0	" to a grey pensive baby eating dirt on the pavement , or to acknowledge the right of a Case to ask questions sometimes instead of answering them , or to disapprove of spying and tale - bearing , or to believe any statement made by any one without an assured income , or to quote any part of the New Testament , or in fact to confuse in any way the ideas of charity and love . Christ , who , by the way , unfortunately omitted to join any reputable philanthropic society , commanded seekers of salvation to be poor and to despise themselves . But this was sentimental , and the Charity Society decrees that only the prosperous and the self - respectful shall deserve a hearing . "
17675	18015	17671	17671	I	0	" said Sarah Brown to her Dog David in a broken voice . She turned again to her enchanted sandwich . There was increased laughter in the air , and through it she heard the hoarse and happy shouting of the sparrows in the spring - coloured tree opposite . Sparrows are the ideal Naughty Poor , the begging friars , the gypsies of the air , they claim alms as a right and as a seal of friendship ; with their mouths full of your crumbs they share with you their innocent and vulgar wit , they give you in return no I.O.U. , and no particulars for your case - paper . When they have got from you all that you will give , they wink and giggle and shake the dust of your window - sill from off their feet . Sarah Brown opened the office window , and the air of the office began at once to dance with life and the noise of children and birds . She thought perhaps these were magic noises , for she heard them so clearly . She broke her second sandwich upon the window - sill , and the sparrows crossed the street and stood on the area railing in a row below her , all speaking at once in an effort to convey to her the fact that a retreat on her part would be tactful . The sparrow obviously buys all his clothes ready - made , probably at Jumble Sales , and he always seems to choose clothes made for a stouter bird . There is no reason why he should never look chic ; he has a slimmer figure than the bullfinch , for instance , who always manages to look so well - tailored . It is just arrogance , pure Londonism , on the part of the sparrow , just that impudent socialistic spirit that makes it so difficult for us to reform the Naughty Poor . Sarah Brown retreated one step . "
18038	18052	18034	18034	you	721	" The sparrows whispered together for a moment , saying to each other , "
18057	18283	18284	18284	CHARITY	146	" They obviously knew that it was a charity window - sill , and were afraid Sarah Brown might intend to rebuke them for not shutting their beaks while chewing , or for neglecting to put any crumbs into the Savings Bank . But after a minute one sparrow moistened his beak and came .... He ate , they all ate , and did not seek to escape as the door of the office opened and the witch came in . She went straight to the window and picked up from among the stooping sparrows a piece of the broken sandwich , and ate it . The Dog David was making sure that there was no surviving crumb on the floor to tell the tale of his mother 's sentimental weakness . Almost instantly , therefore , that sandwich was but a memory , a fading taste in about twenty beaks and two mouths . But still the window stood open , and the air danced , and the white reflections of the ship - like clouds lay on the oilcloth floor . Sarah Brown in the meanwhile , disregarding the witch , had returned to the index , and had taken from its drawer a notification form . In the space given for Name of Case she had written in her irreproachable printing hand : "
18386	18387	18390	18390	me	0	" "
18392	18403	18390	18390	me	0	" said the witch , looking out of the window , "
18458	18459	18460	18460	Witch	157	" "
18462	18467	18460	18460	Witch	157	" said Sarah Brown , "
18475	18476	18480	18480	you	0	" "
18482	18494	18480	18480	you	0	" said the witch , a little disappointed at being interrupted . "
18516	18552	18460	18460	Witch	157	" The Dog David , who was really a good and attentive son to Sarah Brown , came and laid his chin , with an exaggerated look of interest , on her knee - cap . "
18558	18563	18460	18460	Witch	157	" said Sarah Brown , "
18618	18619	18641	18641	I	0	" "
18625	18631	18641	18641	I	0	" said the witch impatiently . "
18647	18648	18643	18643	everybody	289	" "
18655	18660	18643	18643	everybody	289	" chanted Sarah Brown . "
18714	18715	18702	18702	Love	158	" "
18722	18727	18728	18729	Sarah Brown	115	" sighed the witch . "
18750	18757	18742	18742	you	115	" But Sarah Brown went on . "
18813	18859	18803	18803	she	734	" The Dog David grunted a little , by way of rather dubious applause . Sarah Brown , with her own voice printed loud and stark upon the retina of her hearing , felt a little abashed . But presently she added in a whisper : "
19025	19026	18998	18998	He	748	" "
19035	19040	19032	19033	Sarah Brown	115	" said the witch . "
19122	19132	19102	19102	she	754	" Sarah Brown talked on , louder and louder . "
19273	19274	19276	19276	God	126	" "
19278	19288	19276	19276	God	126	" said Sarah Brown , pushing David from her . "
19300	19328	19295	19295	I	0	" The room seemed to her wild imagination to be full of the spirits of parsons and social workers with flaming swords , pointing at the door . "
19339	19344	19345	19345	I	0	" said the witch . "
19380	19381	19382	19382	I	0	" "
19392	20080	19388	19390	a Cautionary Case	772	" cried Sarah Brown , and she slunk behind the witch through the frowning gate of her Eden of fair inks and smooth white surfaces . She had shared with David the remains of her Sandwich of Knowledge ; she had left on the table her puny paper defiance . David , except that he had required but little temptation , had played Adam 's part very creditably in the affair . For him Eden had been a soft warm place , and he was anxious to blame somebody — the woman for choice — for the loss of his comfort . He followed her out into the cold , to become , as you shall hear , like Adam , a tiller of the soil . Magic is a disconcerting travelling companion . While seldom actually conspicuous , it seems to have a mysterious and varying effect on the surrounding public . I have met travellers by Tube who tell of strange doings in those regions , when the conductor of one compartment fell suddenly in love with the conductress of the next , and they ran to each other and met in the middle of the car . As nobody opened the gates or rang the bells , the bewildered train stood for hours at Mornington Crescent before any member of the watching public could find the heart to interrupt the pretty scene . It is patent that a magic person must have been the more or less deliberate cause of this episode . Then again , there is the story of the ' bus that went mad , just as it was leaving its burrow at Dalston . It got the idea that the kindly public was its enemy . You should have seen the astonishment of Liverpool Street and the Bank as it rushed by them . Old ladies about to ask it whether it went to Clapham — its label said it was bound for Barnes — stood aghast , and their questions died on their lips . Policemen put up their hands against it , — it ran over them . It even learned the trick of avoiding the nimble business man by a cunning little skid just as he thought he had caught it . You will hardly believe me , but that ' bus ran seven times round Trafalgar Square , until the lions ' tails twisted for giddiness , and Nelson reeled where he stood . I do n't know where it went to that day , certainly not to Barnes , but late in the evening it burst into another ' bus 's burrow at Tooting , its sides heaving , its tyres worn to the quick , its windows streaming with perspiration , and a great bruise on its forehead where a chance bomb had struck it . I believe the poor thing had to be put out of its misery in the end . And what was the reason of all this ? It was found that a wizard , called Innocent , of Stoke Newington , had been asleep on the top all the time , having forgotten to alight the night before , on his return from the City . Sarah Brown , on the night of Lady Arabel 's supper party , was unaware of the risk she ran in entering a public conveyance in company with a witch . But she was spared to a merciful extent , for nothing happened on any of the ' buses they boarded , except that , as they crossed the Canal , a cloud of sea - gulls swooped and swirled into the ' bus , resting awhile on the passengers ' willing shoulders before disappearing again . Also the passengers on the Baker Street stretch sang part - songs , all the way down to Selfridge 's . The conductor turned out to have rather a pleasing tenor voice . The witch and Sarah Brown knocked at the Higgins ' door five minutes before supper - time . Lady Arabel herself opened it . "
20111	20120	20108	20108	his	112	" The tactful Sarah Brown nudged the witch . "
20125	20129	20132	20132	we	774	" she murmured . "
20136	20142	20143	20143	I	0	" replied the witch loudly . "
20157	20158	20143	20143	I	0	" "
20163	20168	20169	20169	I	0	" added Lady Arabel . "
20221	20287	20217	20218	a bullock	777	" The house of Higgins had an enormous hall to which a large number of high windows gave the impression of a squint . I should think two small Zeppelins could have danced a minuet under its dome . Sarah Brown and the witch put on their cathedral look at once , by mistake , and propping their chins upon their umbrellas gazed reverently upward . "
20299	20304	20217	20218	a bullock	777	" said Lady Arabel . "
20386	20584	20372	20372	I	0	" Sarah Brown and the witch were left in a small room that opened on to the great hall . It was furnished rather like a lodging - house parlour . There was a thermometer elaborately disguised as a model of the Eddystone Lighthouse on the mantelpiece , flanked on each side by a china boot in pink , with real bootlaces , and a pig looking out of the top of each . There were pictures on the walls , mostly representing young ladies , more or less obviously in love , supported by rustic properties . I have noticed that the girl 's first love is the monopoly of the Victorian painter , whereas the boy 's is that of the novelist , but I do not know the reason of this . There was a slight clap of thunder and Richard entered . He would have been very obviously a wizard even without the thunder , and seemed much less innocent about his magic than the witch . He had pale hair , a pale face , and eyes that did not open wide without a certain effort on the part of the brows . "
20591	20598	20599	20599	I	0	" he said to Sarah Brown . "
20621	20742	20613	20613	you	787	" Directly he spoke , one saw that he was making the usual effort of magic to appear real . Witches and wizards lead difficult lives because they have no ancestry working within them to prompt them in the little details . Whenever you see a person being unusually grown - up , suspect them of magic . You can always notice witches and wizards , for instance , after eight o'clock at night , pretending that they are not proud of sitting up late . It is all nonsense about witches being night birds ; they often fly about at night , indeed , but only because they are like permanent children gloriously escaped for ever from their Nanas . "
20746	20750	20613	20613	you	787	" added Richard , "
20757	20843	20613	20613	you	787	" The picture might have cost a shilling originally , framed , or it might have been attached to a calendar once . It was a landscape so thick in colouring and so lightless that it failed to give an outdoor impression at all . There was a river and waterfall like well - combed hair in the middle , and a dozen leaden mountains lying about with — apparently — pocket - handkerchiefs on their tops , and a dropsical - looking stag drinking . "
20849	20853	20613	20613	you	787	" insisted Richard , "
21018	21447	21448	21448	You	796	" A stave played by a ' cello called them to supper , and , as they returned to the hall , a burst of earnest music from the whole orchestra partially drowned the clap of thunder that again marked Richard 's passage through the door . Sarah Brown felt sure that Lady Arabel arranged this on purpose . The wizard 's mother obviously had great difficulty in not noticing the phenomena connected with her son , and she wore a striving smile and a look of glassy and well - bred unconsciousness whenever anything magic happened . At the end of the hall the orchestra , arranged neatly in a crescent , was busily employing its violins in a unanimous melody of so rude and destructive a nature that it seemed as if every string must be broken . This mania spread until even the outlying bassoons , triangles , and celestas were infected . A piercing note of command , however , from a clarinet caused a devastating dumbness to fall suddenly on every instrument except the piano , which continued self - consciously alone . The pianist looked at the ceiling mostly , but one note seemed to be an especial favourite with him , and whenever he played it he looked closely and paternally at it , almost indeed applying his nose to it . All at once , just as Sarah Brown was beginning to imagine that she could catch the tune and the time , the music ceased , apparently in the middle of a bar . Richard sneezed once or twice . That unsophisticated wizard was evidently enjoying himself in the practice of his art . One felt that magic was not encouraged in the Army , and that the supernatural orgy in which he was now indulging was the accumulated reaction after long self - control . Strange noises of unnatural laughter , for instance , proceeded from distant corners of the hall , and each of the electric lights in turn winked facetiously . The string of the double bass broke loudly , and the new string which its devotee laboriously inserted also broke at once . The performer looked appealingly at Lady Arabel , but she refrained from meeting his eye . A blizzard of butterflies enveloped the table . This was evidently rather a difficult trick , for the spell collapsed repeatedly , and from one second to another Sarah Brown was never quite sure whether there were really Purple Admirals drowning in her soup or not . "
21453	21458	21448	21448	You	796	" sighed the witch , "
21497	21498	21475	21475	I	0	" "
21503	21507	21475	21475	I	0	" said Richard . "
21617	21662	21608	21608	I	0	" To this discussion , and indeed to all the enchantments , Lady Arabel paid no attention , but continued to talk a little nervously on very insipid subjects . Her eyes had the pathetic look often seen in stupid people 's eyes , the "
21670	21673	21674	21674	I	0	" look , "
21693	21802	21687	21687	Me	0	" Finally Richard indulged in a trick that was evidently a stock joke among magic people , for the witch laughed directly it began . Just as the hostess , with poised fork and spoon , was about to distribute the whitebait , the round table began to spin , and the whitebait were whisked away from her . The table continued to spin for a moment , with a deep thrilling organ sound , and when it stopped , the whitebait were found to have assembled opposite to Richard 's place . He distributed them gravely . Lady Arabel turned scarlet , and murmured to Sarah Brown : "
21811	21846	21687	21687	Me	0	" Sarah Brown took pity on her , and began talking at random . The orchestra was busy again , and to the tune of a loud elusive rag - time , she shouted : "
21933	21934	21924	21924	I	0	" "
21938	21946	21924	21924	I	0	" said Lady Arabel , instantly motherly . "
22022	22023	22025	22025	you	0	" "
22028	22032	22035	22035	she	0	" asked Richard . "
22038	22044	22035	22035	she	0	" said the witch proudly . "
22125	22126	22121	22121	me	0	" "
22144	22187	22137	22137	I	0	" said Richard , who with a rather tiresome persistence was now levitating the chicken , so that , invisibly suspended at a height of eighteen inches above the middle of the table , it dripped gravy into a bowl of daffodils . "
22376	22377	22378	22378	I	0	" "
22386	22391	22378	22378	I	0	" said Sarah Brown . "
22427	22455	22424	22424	my	0	" At that moment there was a loud report . Every one looked at the double bass , but all his strings were for the moment intact . "
22459	22464	22424	22424	my	0	" said the witch . "
22468	22485	22424	22424	my	0	" exclaimed Lady Arabel , much relieved to hear that this new sensation was not supernatural . "
22662	22691	22638	22640	A nice man	835	" They all waited patiently while the piece continued . It was a plain uneventful piece , composed by a Higgins relative and therefore admired in the household . "
22698	22722	22638	22640	A nice man	835	" said the witch , taking advantage of an emotional pause while one violin was wheezing a very long small note by itself , "
22787	22822	22823	22823	I	0	" She was interrupted by a scuffling sound in the umbrella - stand , and Harold the Broomstick , after a moment 's rather embarrassing entanglement with a butterfly net , approached , panting . "
22827	22832	22823	22823	I	0	" said the witch . "
22862	22882	22846	22847	Sarah Brown	115	" Lady Arabel and Sarah Brown crossed the road to the church , Richard following a few yards behind . "
22897	22903	22904	22904	Rrchud	112	" said Lady Arabel confidentially . "
22970	23016	23017	23018	The Vicar	167	" There was a distant blot of gunfire on the air , just as they reached the door of the crypt . The very stout dog of the Vicar ( are not all reverend dogs fat ? ) was waiting there with a bored look . "
23062	23279	23280	23280	I	0	" That district of London happened to be rather a courageous one . The inhabitants felt that if the War had to be brought home to them , common politeness dictated that it should find them at home . There were not more than a dozen people in the crypt therefore . Most of them were old ladies from the district 's less respectable quarter , knitting . The Vicar was trying to press comfort upon them , but without much success , for they were all quite content , discussing the deaths in their families . The noise of gunfire was coming nearer , shaking the ground like the uneven tread of a drunken giant . Sarah Brown concentrated on an evening newspaper , busily reading again and again one of those columns of confidential man - to - man advertisement , which everybody reads with avidity while determining the more never to buy the article advertised . But presently the fidgeting hands of Richard caught her eye , and she looked at him . He was sitting next to his mother on a stone step . He seemed to be in a quieter mood and attempted no manifestation . Sarah Brown thought he was suppressing excitement , however , and indeed he presently said : "
23302	23462	23463	23463	Boys	848	" Opposite to them , on two campstools , sat a young bridling mother of fifty , with her old hard daughter of sixteen or so . Hard was that daughter in every way ; you would have counted her age in winters , not in summers , so obviously untender were her years . An iron plait of hair lay for about six inches down her spine ; her feet and ankles made the campstool on which she sat , looking pathetically ethereal . Of such stuff as this is the backbone of England made , which is perhaps why the backbone of England sometimes seems so sadly inflexible . There was a screeching noise outside , followed by an incredible crash . It seemed to cleave a bottomless abyss between one second and the next , so that one seemed to be conscious for the first time in an astonished and astonishing world . Lady Arabel said : "
23491	23509	23510	23511	The villains	850	" The campstooled mother gave a luxurious little shriek as soon as the crash was safely over . "
23513	23518	23510	23511	The villains	850	" she said kittenishly . "
23547	23548	23534	23534	Mary	170	" "
23553	23620	23621	23621	RUPERT	171	" replied her firm daughter , in not unnatural error . One could easily see that she was beloved at home , and one wondered why . The sound of the guns seemed only a negative form of sound after the bomb , and clearly above the firing could be heard a howl . The Vicar 's dog , still howling , ran into the crypt . "
23623	23781	23621	23621	RUPERT	171	" said the Vicar , in a terrible voice , interrupting himself in the middle of a cheering platitude . But he had no time to say anything more , for behind Rupert came a procession of perhaps a dozen people , all dressed in sheets . Everybody saw at one pitiful glance that these were unfortunate householders , so suddenly roused from oblivion as to forget all their ordinary suburban dignity , probably barely escaping from ruined homes with their lives and a sheet each . There was a very old man , a middle - aged spinster , and then an enormous group of children of ages varying from two months to twenty years , followed by their parents , teachers , or guardians . A nearer gun began to fire , and one of the old ladies on the other side of the crypt suddenly threw down her knitting and began confessing her sins . "
23791	23796	23784	23784	I	0	" she shouted dramatically . "
23839	23840	23828	23828	I	0	" "
23848	23859	23860	23860	I	0	" said the sheeted spinster sitting down beside Lady Arabel . "
23892	23893	23884	23884	I	0	" "
23897	23918	23884	23884	I	0	" asked Lady Arabel , who was rather deeply engrossed in turning the heel of the sock she was knitting . "
23933	23934	23921	23921	I	0	" "
23941	23947	23921	23921	I	0	" said kind Lady Arabel . "
23966	23967	23958	23958	You	0	" "
23972	23980	23968	23968	You	0	" said the sheeted lady , bridling . "
24031	24045	24025	24025	I	0	" The old knitter had been rather annoyed to find her confession interrupted . "
24054	24061	24046	24049	A wicked ol' woman	853	" she said with more dignity . "
24099	24100	24091	24091	I	0	" "
24107	24115	24091	24091	I	0	" Lady Arabel 's neighbour broke in . "
24171	24172	24173	24173	You	0	" "
24179	24185	24173	24173	You	0	" replied Lady Arabel pleasantly . "
24235	24236	24173	24173	You	0	" "
24243	24272	24173	24173	You	0	" said the ladylike creature . ( One could see she was a Real Lady even through the sheet . Obviously she read the Morning Post daily . ) "
24343	24344	24335	24341	the late churchwarden who eloped with —	860	" "
24351	24356	24396	24396	you	0	" said Lady Arabel , "
24385	24386	24375	24375	I	0	" "
24400	24411	24396	24396	you	0	" said the elderly lady , coldly drawing herself up . "
24430	24431	24418	24418	I	0	" "
24435	24441	24418	24418	I	0	" shrieked the kittenish mother . "
24473	24474	24458	24462	those fiends in the sky	863	" "
24480	24486	24458	24462	those fiends in the sky	863	" exclaimed the sheeted lady . "
24501	24502	24488	24488	you	0	" "
24511	24517	24488	24488	you	0	" implored the hard flapper . "
24530	24531	24532	24535	Responsible for the crash	864	" "
24537	24554	24532	24535	Responsible for the crash	864	" said the other , whose tones were becoming more and more alive with exclamation marks . "
24572	24607	24568	24570	the Evil One	867	" A series of crashes interrupted her , the work of the adjacent gun . The earth shook , and each report was followed by the curious ethereal wail of shells on their way . "
24612	24620	24568	24570	the Evil One	867	" exclaimed Lady Arabel 's sheeted neighbour . "
24674	24675	24652	24652	myself	0	" "
24679	24684	24652	24652	myself	0	" said Lady Arabel , "
24703	24783	24701	24701	myself	0	" Sarah Brown happened to look at Richard . His eyes were shut , but he was smiling very broadly with tight lips , and his face was turned towards the ceiling . His fingers were very tense and busy on his lap , as though he were still fidgeting with magic . But her study of him was interrupted by the loud denouncing voice of the very venerable man who had led the procession of late - comers . "
24791	24815	24701	24701	myself	0	" he said , pointing at the deeply disconcerted Rupert who was weaving himself nervously in and out of his master 's legs . "
24834	24835	24827	24827	I	0	" "
24844	24853	24827	24827	I	0	" protested the Vicar , a little roused . "
24896	24910	24891	24891	Rupert	171	" Rupert howled again , and lay down as if about to faint . "
24921	24926	24914	24914	I	0	" said the veteran , "
24931	24932	24914	24914	I	0	" "
24935	24940	24914	24914	I	0	" interrupted the Vicar , "
24973	25038	24965	24965	he	173	" He approached the old man and strove to button - hole him . The sheet at first foiled him in this intention , but he presently contented himself with seizing a little corner of it , by which he led his aged brother vicar into a corner . There they could be heard for some time misunderstanding each other in low earnest tones . "
25052	25061	25062	25062	I	0	" suddenly burst forth again the repentant knitter . "
25122	25376	25377	25378	The Trump	881	" Sarah Brown was becoming sleepy . A blankness was invading her mind , and the talk in the crypt seemed to lose its meaning , and to consist chiefly of S 's . She pondered idly on the family of children with their elders , all of whom were now studying each other with a certain look of disillusionment . It was a group whose relationships were difficult to make out , the ages of many of the children being unnaturally approximate . There seemed to be at least seven children under three years old , and yet they all bore a strong and regrettable family likeness . Several of the babies would hardly have been given credit for having reached walking age , yet none had been carried in . The woman who seemed to imagine herself the mother of this rabble was distributing what looked like hurried final words of advice . The father with a pensive eye was obviously trying to remember their names , and at intervals whispering to a man apparently twenty years his senior , whom he addressed as Sonny . It was all very confusing . A long dim stretch of time seemed to have passed when suddenly the note of a bugle sprang out across space . Somehow the air at once felt cooler and more wholesome , the sound of the All - clear had something akin to the sight of the sun after a thunderstorm , lighting up a crouching whipped world . "
25382	25403	25377	25378	The Trump	881	" said Lady Arabel 's garrulous neighbour , rising with alacrity , and twitching her sheet into more becoming folds . "
25410	25445	25404	25404	I	0	" But at that moment the two Vicars approached , and the elder one , including both the spinster and the mysterious family in one glance , spoke in a clerical yet embarrassed voice . "
25506	25527	25529	25529	me	0	" The spinster interrupted , and , by the way she did it , one saw that she was Chapel . "
25533	25538	25529	25529	me	0	" she said acidly , "

25644	25691	25639	25639	me	0	" said the other , much ruffled , as she gathered her sheet about her . By the way she said it , one saw that she and Mrs. Parachute did not call . She bowed to Lady Arabel , and became satirical , even arch . "
25783	25844	25847	25847	my	0	" The pale party filed out of the crypt and disappeared . The remaining Vicar smote his brow , and addressed the now calm Rupert in a low voice , but with such unaccountable warmth that that harassed animal disappeared precipitately in the direction of his home . Lady Arabel , Sarah Brown , and Richard crossed the churchyard together . "
25852	25857	25847	25848	my dears	555	" said Lady Arabel . "
25880	26004	26376	26377	Another witch	893	" The moonlight lay like cream upon the pavement when the witch and Harold her broomstick left the Higgins ' doorstep . London was a still Switzerland in silver and star - grey , unblotted by people . There was a hint of pale green about the moonlight , and the lamps with their dim light downcast were like daffodils in faery fields . The witch mounted . Harold , who was every inch a thoroughbred and very highly strung , trembled beneath her , but not with fear . They reached Piccadilly Circus with supernatural speed , and flashed across it . The sound of people singing desultorily while taking shelter in the Tube floated up to them . Here the witch said "
26006	26375	26376	26377	Another witch	893	" to Harold , and he reared and shot upwards , narrowly missing the statue of One In A Bus - catching Attitude , which marks the middle of the Circus . As soon as the witch had out - distanced the noise of expectant London , she heard quite distinctly the approach of London 's guests . They came with a chorus of many notes , all deep and dangerous . There were a few clouds wandering about among the stars , and to one of these the witch and her faithful Harold repaired . A cloud gives quite reasonable support to magic people , and most witches and wizards have discovered the delight of paddling knee - deep about those quicksilver continents . They wander along shining and changing valleys under a most ardent sky ; they climb the purple thunderclouds , or launch the first snowflake of a blizzard ; they spring from pink stepping - stone to pink stepping - stone of clouds each no bigger than a baby 's hand , across great sunsets . Often when in London I am battling with a barrage of rain , or falling over unseen strangers into gutters during fogs , I think happily of the sunlit roof of cloud above my head , and of the witches and wizards , lying on their backs with their coats off , among cloud - meadows in a glory of perfect summer and sun . The witch , with one soothing hand on the bristling mane of her Harold , lay on her front on the cloud she had chosen , and looked down through a little hole in it . It was practically the only cloud present that would have afforded reasonable cover ; the others were mere wisps of sky - weed floating in the moonlight . There was a greater chorus of aeroplanes below her now ; the whole sky was ringing with it . The witch could hear a deep bass - voiced machine , a baritone , a quavering tenor , and — thin and sharp as a pin — a little treble sound that made Harold rear and struggle to be free . "
26379	26384	26376	26377	Another witch	893	" said the witch . "
26400	26819	26389	26390	the Huns	177	" She mounted her Harold and slipped off the cloud . The guns were shouting now , and the shells wailed and burst not so very far below them , but Harold trembled no longer . More quickly than a falling star he swooped , and in a second the alien witch was in sight , an unwieldy figure whose broomstick sounded rather broken - winded , probably owing to the long - distance flight and to the fourteen stone of Teutonic magic on its back . There was a wicked - looking apparatus attached to the collar of the German broomstick , obviously designed to squirt unpleasant enchantments downward . This contrivance was apparently giving some trouble , for the German was so busy attending to it that at first she did not see or hear the approach of Harold and his rider . She was aroused to her danger by a heavy chunk of magic which struck and nearly unseated her . In a second , however , she was ready with a parrying enchantment , and the fight began . The two broomsticks reared and circled round each other , and over and under each other . From their riders ' finger - tips magic of the most explosive kind crackled , and incantations of such potency were exchanged that , I am told , the tiles and chimney - pots of the streets below suffered a good deal . Round and round and over and under whirled the broomsticks , till the very spaces went mad , and London seemed to rush down nightmare slopes into a stormy sky , while its lights swung from pole to pole and were entangled with the stars . Both broomsticks were by now so uproariously excited that neither witch was able to aim her magic missiles very carefully , and indeed it was not long before Harold passed entirely beyond control . After bucking violently once or twice , he gave a wild high cry that was like the wind howling through the fierce forest past of his race , and fell upon the other broomstick , fixing his bristles into its throat . The shock of the collision was too much for both witches . Our witch — if I may call her so — was shot over Harold 's head , and landed on the ample breast of her adversary , who , in consequence , lost her balance . They fell together into space . "
26827	27140	26389	26390	the Huns	177	" cried our witch , and thoughts rushed through her mind of green safe places , and old safe years , and the little hut in a pale bluebell wood , where she was born . She had time to remember the blue ground , dimpled and starred with sunlight , and the way the bees pulled over the bluebells and swung on them to the tune of cuckoos in a May mist ; she had time to think of the green globe ghosts of the bluebells that haunted the wood after the spring was dead . Bluebells and being young were in all her thoughts , and it was some time before she noticed how slowly she and her enemy were falling . For they were locked together . And the enemy witch 's cloak , an orthodox witch cloak except for its colour , which was German field - grey instead of red , was spread out like a parachute , and was supporting them upon their peaceful and almost affectionate descent . For all I know they might have alighted gently in the Strand , and the authorities might by now be regretting the capture of a most embarrassing and unaccountable prisoner . But something intervened . The cloud , like a sheep suffering from the lack of other sheep to follow , had not yet quitted the scene . The witches ' battle had tended upward , and it had ended several hundred feet above the level of the cloud , which was apparently sinking . The downward course of the combatants ' fall was therefore arrested , and they found themselves still interlocked , prostrate and embedded , with their eyes and mouths full of woolly wisps of cloud . Our witch was the first to recover herself . She stood up and brushed herself , remarking : "
27197	27894	27895	27896	Great Scott	180	" The German was an older woman , and less adaptable to the strange chances of War . She was silent for a few minutes , seated in the small crater made in the cloud by her fall . She was not exactly ugly . She had the sort of face about which one could not help feeling that one could have done it better oneself , or at least that one could have taken more trouble . It seemed moulded — even kneaded — carelessly , in very soft material . Beneath her open cloak her dress was of the ordinary German Reform - Kleid type , and her figure had the rather jelloid appearance of those who affect this style . Her regulation witch 's hat was by now , probably , in the Serpentine , and her round head was therefore disclosed , with two stout sand - coloured plaits pursuing each other round it . The witches faced each other for some seconds . A long way away they could hear the spitting and crackling sound of the two broomsticks fighting . Looking up , they could see the combatants , like black comets in collision . Our witch , who had good sight , saw that the enemy broomstick was upper - most , and that the writhing Harold was being shaken like a mouse . Their bristles were interlocked . One twig floated down between the witches , and our witch recognised it as coming from her poor Harold 's mane . As , for this purpose , she brought her eyes to her immediate surroundings , it seemed to her suddenly that the sky was growing larger , and then she realised that this was because their refuge was growing smaller . The edges of the cloud were dissolving . She saw at last her peril and her disadvantage . If Harold should be killed or disabled she could never reach the earth again , except by means of a fatal fall of several thousand feet . The enemy witch , with her ingenious cloak contrivance strapped securely about her , stood a reasonable chance of escape . But our witch was an amateur in War , she was without support , forlornly dressed in her faithful blue serge three - year - old , and her little squirrel tippet . Magic , as you know , has limitations . Fire is of course a plaything in magic hands . Water has its docile moments , the earth herself may be tampered with , and an incantation may call man or any of his possessions to attention . But space is too great a thing , space is the inconceivable Hand , holding aloft this fragile delusion that is our world . There is no power that can mock at space , there is no enchantment that is not lost between us and the moon , and all magic people know — and tremble to know — that in a breath , between one second and another , that Hand may close , and the shell of time first crack and then be crushed , and magic be one with nothingness and death and all other delusions . This is why magic , which treats the other elements as its servants , bows before space , and has to call such a purely independent contrivance as a broomstick to its help in the matter of air - travel . The witches faced each other on their little unstable sanctuary in the kingdom of space . Our witch felt secretly sick , and at the same time she tore fear from her mind , and knew that death was but an imperfectly kept secret , and that not an evil one . After all , we have condemned it unheard . Both witches could talk a magic tongue , and make themselves mutually understood . Neither knew the other 's natural tongue . But when our witch noticed several large ferocious tears rolling down her opponent 's cheeks , she was able , by means of magic , to say : "
27908	27909	27895	27896	Great Scott	180	" "
27915	27921	27895	27896	Great Scott	180	" replied the German witch . "
27953	27954	27948	27948	I	0	" "
27958	27965	27948	27948	I	0	" echoed the astounded English witch . "
27995	27996	27988	27988	you	897	" "
28003	28020	27988	27988	you	897	" said the German , evidently pleased to meet someone to whom this information was fresh . "
28058	28069	28024	28024	she	59	" Our witch laughed . She was forgetting her danger . "
28076	28080	28024	28024	she	59	" she said . "
28134	28157	28128	28128	I	0	" The German took no notice of this . The past three years had made her an adept in taking no notice . "
28161	28165	28128	28128	I	0	" she added . "
28255	28256	28246	28252	a paltry and treacherous non - combatant	903	" "
28261	28440	28246	28252	a paltry and treacherous non - combatant	903	" breathed our witch , remembering . She looked up . The broomsticks were closer now , and through the breathless air , amidst the dream - like firing of the guns below , she could hear the difficult gasping of the hard - pressed Harold , still fighting bravely but with hardly a twig on his head . The tide of space was coming in . The edge of the cloud was barely six inches from her hand . Our witch 's mind overflowed with the thought of invasions and the coming in of tides . It seemed that all her life she had been living on a narrowing shore . She remembered all her dawns as precarious footholds of peace on a threatened rock , and all her evenings as golden sands sloping down into encroaching sleep . She realised Everything as a little hopeless garrison against the army of Nothing . She clutched a pinch of cloud nervously , and it broke off in her hand . She recalled her senses with a devastating effort . "
28447	28455	28442	28442	you	904	" she said , after a moment , "
28510	28511	28512	28512	We	906	" "
28516	28521	28514	28514	Crusaders	908	" said the German . "
28528	28529	28514	28514	Crusaders	908	" "
28539	28544	28537	28537	we	906	" said our witch . "
28572	28573	28574	28574	We	906	" "
28578	28584	28574	28574	We	906	" recited the German glibly , "
28602	28635	28595	28595	she	905	" There was a violent explosion quite close to them , and the cloud reeled and shook . About a foot of the German end of it broke off and was dissolved . "
28644	28652	28636	28636	We	906	" said our witch , looking down . "
28659	28660	28595	28595	she	905	" "
28670	28919	28595	28595	she	905	" said the German , trying to conceal the nervousness with which she rearranged her rigid - looking cloak round her . She seemed to be sinking herself to a certain extent ; perhaps the warmth of her emotions was melting the cloud beneath her . Certainly she now sat , apparently squat as an idol , her figure submerged in cloud to the waist . The English witch looked down , singing a little to keep up her morale . London looked exactly like the maps you buy for sixpence from sad - looking gentlemen in the Strand , only it was sown with a thin crop of lights , and was chiefly designed in grey and darker grey , and the Tubes did not show so indecently . With surprising clearness the rhythmic whispering of the trains and the scanty traffic could be heard , and once even the shrill characteristic voice of an ambulance . Somehow space did not seem disturbed by these sounds ; its quietness pressed upon the listeners ' minds like a heavy dream , and there was no real believing in anything but space . Our witch felt she could have smudged London off the face of space with her finger , and the thought of seven million lives involved in the fate of that sliding chart carried no conviction to her . She forced into her mind the realisation of humanity , and of little lives lived in little rooms . "
28926	28930	28921	28922	one Crusader	913	" she said , "
28973	28974	28964	28967	soldiers when on leave	918	" "
28986	29016	28964	28967	soldiers when on leave	918	" said the German , trying restlessly to raise herself more to the level of her lighter companion , who was still perched on the surface of the cloud . "
29078	29079	29073	29074	the scourge	930	" "
29086	29092	29073	29074	the scourge	930	" said our witch eagerly . "
29181	29235	29170	29170	they	341	" The cloud was very small now . The filmy edges of it were faintly rising and falling like the seaweed frill of a rock in the sea . The witch kept her eyes on her opponent 's face , because to look anywhere else gave her a white feeling in her head . "
29243	29247	29170	29170	they	341	" she said , "
29289	29290	29291	29291	I	0	" "
29297	29303	29294	29294	I	0	" wept the German witch . "
29311	29312	29313	29313	You	0	" "
29320	29325	29313	29313	You	0	" said our witch . "
29400	29401	30787	30787	you	952	" "
29405	29413	30787	30787	you	952	" said the German , recovering herself . "
29437	30772	29427	29427	she	59	" But she had little luck . Once more she was interrupted by an explosion , a much louder one , directly above them . Our witch hardly heard the noise ; she seemed suddenly to have found the climax of her life , and the climax was pain . There was pain and a feeling of terrible change all over her , smothering her , and a super - pain in her shoulder . After a second or two as long as death , she realised dimly that she was all tensely strung to an attitude , like a marionette . Her hands were up trying to shield her head , her chin was pressed down to her drawn - up knees . Her blue serge shoulder was extraordinarily wet and immovable . She looked along the cloud . Her enemy was not there . There was a round hole in the cloud , and as she leaned painfully towards it , she could see a few of the lights of London , and something falling spasmodically towards them . The cloud had been shaken to its foundations by the two explosions , and the German witch , who had been seated perhaps on a seam in the material , or at any rate on one of the less stable parts of the fabric , had fallen through . Her parachute cloak , in passing through the hole in the cloud , had been turned inside out above her head , and rendered useless . Over and about her falling figure her broomstick darted helplessly , uttering curious sad cries , like a seagull 's . Even as the English witch watched her enemy 's disaster , the larger part of the cloud , weakened by all the shock and movement , broke away with a hissing sound . The witch 's feet hung now over space , she dared not move ; she had difficulty in steadying herself with her unwounded arm , for her hand could find only a quicksand of dissolving cloud to lean on . She had no thoughts left but thoughts of danger and of pain . But Harold the Broomstick came back . The witch heard a rustling sound close to her , and it startled her more than all the noise of the guns , which had come , as it seemed , from the forgotten other side of eternity . The rough head of Harold appeared over the cloud 's edge , and insinuated itself pathetically under her arm . Very carefully and very painfully the witch reached a kneeling position , damaging her refuge with every movement in spite of her care . She gasped with pain , and Harold tried to look very strong and hopeful to comfort her . He straightened his back , and she crawled into the saddle . The tremor of their launching split the cloud into several parts , which disintegrated . There was no more foot - hold on it ; the tide had come up and submerged it . Harold the Broomstick was crippled , he stumbled as he flew , sometimes he dropped a score of feet , and span . He did stunts by mistake . They had not strength enough between them to get home . They made a forced landing in the silver loneliness of Kensington Gardens . It was a fortunate place , for there is much magic there . Wherever there are children who pretend , there grows a little magic in the air , and therefore the wind of Kensington Gardens thrills with enchantment , and the Round Pond , full of much pretence of great Armadas , crossed and re - crossed with the abiding wakes of ships full of treasure and romance , is a blessed lake to magic people . The witch bathed Harold , her broomstick , in the Round Pond . He evidently felt its healing quality at once , for after the first minute of immersion , he swam about exultantly , and shook drops full of moonlight out of his mane . The bugles sounded All - clear in many keys all round the ear 's horizon ; their sound matched the waning moonlight . The witch bathed her shoulder , and then she found her way to a little quiet place she knew of , where no park - keeper ever looks , a place where secret and ungardened daffodils grow in springtime , a place where all the mice and birds play unafraid , because no cat can find the way thither . You can see the Serpentine from that place , and the bronze shadows under its bridge , but no houses , and no railways , and no signs of London . Here the witch made a little fire , and leaned three sticks together over it ; she lighted the fire with her finger - tip and hung over it the little patent folding cauldron , which she always carried on a chatelaine swinging from her belt . And she made a charm of daisy - heads , and spring - smelling grasses , and the roots of unappreciated weeds , and the mosses that cover the tiny faery cliffs of the Serpentine . Over the mixture she shook out the contents of one of her little paper packets of magic . All this she boiled over her fire for many hours , sitting beside it in the silver darkness , with her knees drawn up and her hands clasped in front of them . The trees sprang up into the moonlight like dark fountains from the pools of their own shadows . Little shreds of cloud flowed wonderfully across the sky . There was no sound except the sound of the water , like an uncertain player upon a little instrument . The charm was still unfinished when the dawn passed over London , and the sun came up , the seed of another day , sown in a rich red soil . The trees of the Gardens remembered their daylight shadows again , and forgot their mystery . The water - birds , after examining their shoulder - blades with minute care for some moments , launched themselves upon a lake of diamonds . There seemed a veil of mist and bird - song over the world . The sudden song of the birds was like finding the hearing of one 's heart restored , after long deafness . The witch anointed her shoulder with the charm , after having first made a drop of potion out of the bubbles in it . This potion she drank , and was healed of her wound and her weariness , and of all desires except a desire to sleep with her face among the daffodils . She was the most beautifully alone person in the world that morning ; nobody could have found her . A thin string of very blue smoke went up from her faint fire and was tangled among the boughs of a flowering tree , but the coarse eye of a park - keeper could never have seen it . She had escaped from the net of the cruel hours ; for her the stained world was washed clean ; for her all horror held its breath ; for her there was absolute spring , and an innocent sun , and the shadows of daffodils upon closed eyes .... Sarah Brown , finding herself unfetched by the witch , went home alone as soon as the ' buses began putting out to sea after the storm . She expected to find the witch at home , but only the Dog David and Peony were in the House of Living Alone . David lay on Peony 's bed , and Peony under it . Sarah Brown saw them as she passed their open door . "
30776	30780	29427	29427	she	59	" said Peony , "
30840	30882	30802	30802	they	953	" Peony , with a touching faith in the combined protective powers of twelve inches of mattress and nine inches of dog , had been reading a little paper book called Love in Society by the light of an electric torch . "
30889	30904	30802	30802	they	953	" said Sarah Brown , who had come home through a roar of rumour . "
30952	30953	30946	30947	the witch	432	" "
30957	30961	30946	30947	the witch	432	" replied Peony . "
31003	31004	30979	30979	she	432	" "
31012	31017	30979	30979	she	432	" said Sarah Brown . "
31047	31382	31043	31043	she	432	" The night was by then far from young , in fact it was well into its second childhood . But Sarah Brown and the Dog David sought and tried on land outfits for several hours . The shop was divided into three horizontal departments . Nearest the floor were the foodstuffs ; biscuit tins buttressed the counter on every side ; regiments of Grape - nuts , officered by an occasional Quaker Oat , stood in review order all round the lower shelves . On the counter little castles of tinned fruit were built , while bins beneath it held the varied grain , cereal , and magic stock . About on a level with one 's head the hardware department began : frying - pans lolled with tin coffee - pots over racks , dust - pans divorced from their brushes were platonically attached to flat - irons or pie - dishes , Stephen 's Inks were allied with penny mugs or tins of boot polish in an invasion of the middle shelves , and a wreath of sponges crowned the champion of a row of kettles in shining armour . Against the ceiling the drapery section was found . Overalls , ready - made breeches , babies ' socks , and pink flannelette mysteries hung doubled up as if in pain over strings nailed to the rafters . From this department Sarah Brown , balanced upon three large biscuit tins placed on the counter , chose her outfit with vanity and care . The general effect was not good , but she did not know this , for she studied the parts separately in a six - inch mirror . She was filled with a simple pleasure . For she was always absurdly moved by little excitements , and by any prospect of a changed to - morrow . She was not really used to being alive at all , and that is what made her take to magic so kindly . "
31387	31391	31392	31392	I	0	" she said , "
31403	32631	32661	32662	the foreman	964	" And in six hours she was on her way , whistling , across the Parish of Faery . The Dog David ran in front of her among the daisies . The rabbits can never be caught in this land of happy animals , but they give good sport and always play fair . David Blessing Brown , a dog of independent yet loving habit , had spent about four - fifths of his life in the Brown family . He was three years old , and though ineligible for military service , made a point of wearing khaki about his face , and in a symmetrical heart - shaped spot near his tail . To Sarah Brown he was the Question and the Answer , his presence was a constant playtime for her mind ; so well was he loved that he seemed to her to move in a little mist and clamour of love . With every one else she held but lame intercourse , but her Dog David and she withheld no passing thought from each other . They could often be heard by unmattering landladies and passers - by exchanging views in the strong Suffolk accent that was a sort of standing joke between them . I believe that Sarah Brown had loved the Dog David so much that she had given him a soul . Certainly other dogs did not care for him . David said that they had found out that his second name was Blessing , and that they laughed at him for it . His face was seamed with the scars of their laughing . But I know that the enmity had a more fundamental reason than that . I know that when men speak with the tongues of angels they are shunned and hated by men , and so I think that when dogs approach humanity too nearly they are banished from the love of their own kind . Sarah Brown was not altogether unfamiliar with the Parish of Faery , but she never failed to be surprised by the enchantment of the Enchanted Forest . The Green Ride runs straight through it , so incredibly straight that as you walk along it the end of it is at the end of your sight , and is like a star in a green sky . There is a dream that binds your mind as you cross the forest ; it is like an imitation of eternity , so that , as you pass into the forest 's shade , time passes from before you , and , as you pass out of it , you seem to have lived a thousand quiet and utterly forgotten lives . Clocks and calendars have no meaning in the forest ; the seasons and the hours haunt it at their will , and abide by no law . Just as the sun upon a stormy day makes golden a moving and elusive acre in our human woods , so the night in the Enchanted Forest comes and goes like a ghost upon the sight of lovers of the night . For there you may step , unastonished , from the end of a day into its beginning ; there the summer and the winter may dodge each other round one tree ; there you may see at one glance a spring hoar frost and an autumn trembling of airs , a wild cherry tree blossoming beside a tawny maple . The forest is so deep and so thick that it provides its own sky , and can enjoy its own impulses , and its own quiet anarchy . There you forget that sky of ours across whose face some tyrant drives our few docile seasons in conventional order . I think the Dog David in his own way shared the dream that leads wayfarers through the Enchanted Forest . When he came out with Sarah Brown under the tasselled arch of Travellers ' Joy that crosses the end of the Green Ride , he was all shining and dewy with adventure , and his tail was upright , as though he were pretending that it carried a flag . On an abrupt hill in the middle of an enormous green meadow a Castle stood , just as Richard had predicted . It was To Let , and was not looking its best . Some man of enterprise , taking advantage of its forlorn condition , had glued an advertisement upon its donjon keep . You could almost have measured that advertisement in acres ; it recommended a face cream , and represented a lady with a face of horrible size , whose naturally immaculate complexion was marred by the rivets and loopholes of the donjon keep itself , which protruded in rather a distressing way . Oak trees stood round the foot of that pale hill , and the general effect was rather that of parsley round a ham . Between two oaks Sarah Brown , following directions , found the beginning of the Daisified Path . There were not only daisies all over the path but real violets on either side of it . The daisies looked one in the face , but the violets did not , because they had morbidly bad manners . Still of course manners are very small change and count for very little ; the violet , being an artist , is entitled to any manners it likes , while the daisy has no temperament whatever , and no excuse for eccentricity . Grasshoppers tatted industriously and impartially among the daisies and the violets . Here outside the forest there was weather again , and the weather was more promising than generous . It continued to promise all day without exactly explaining what its promise was , and without achieving any special fulfilment . Fine silver lines of sunlight were ruled at a steep angle across a grey slate view . At the gate of Higgins Farm , Sarah Brown was a little disconcerted to find a small dragon . It was coiled round a tree beside the clipped box archway . It was not a very fine specimen , being of a brownish - green colour , and having lost the tip of one wing . Its spine was serrated , especially deeply between its shoulder blades , where it could raise a sort of crest if angered or excited . But at present it was asleep , its saturnine and rather wistful face rested upon one scaly paw . Sarah Brown was uncertain what to do , but the Dog David took the matter into his own paws by mistake . He had just met one of the castle dogs , one of those tremulous - tailed creatures who spend themselves in a rather pathetic effort to sustain an imaginary reputation for humour . David retorted to this dog 's first facetious onslaught with a kindly quip , they trod on each other once or twice with extravagant gestures , and then parted hysterically , each supposing himself to be pursued by the other . It was then that David tripped over the dragon 's barbed tail . David squeaked , and the dragon awoke . It uncoiled itself suddenly like a broken spring . "
32634	32638	32661	32662	the foreman	964	" it said . "
32671	32939	32664	32664	Higgins	164	" It preceded her through the little green archway that led to the farm . The sight reminded Sarah Brown of watching from Golders Green Tube Station the train one has just missed dive into the tunnel . She followed . On the other side of the archway the whole view of the plain called Higgins Farm met the adventurer . The farm - buildings were heaped graciously together on a little wave in the sea of ploughed fields . Except for two pale ricks in their midst , they exactly matched their surroundings , they were plastered dark red , and thatched with very old green and brown thatch . Beyond the buildings was a little wood , its interior lighted up with bluebells , and this wood merged into an orchard , where a white pony and an auburn pig strove apparently to eat the same blade of grass . The various sections of the farm land lay mapped out in different intensities of brown , very young green , and maturer green , and each section was dotted with people . They seemed small people even from a distance , and , as Sarah Brown advanced at the tail of the dragon , she saw that the workers were all indeed under ordinary human size . The tallest , a man guiding a miniature plough behind a tall horse , might have reached Sarah Brown 's shoulder . None of them seemed hard at work , they stood talking in little groups . One group as they passed it was trafficking in cigarette cards . "
32953	32960	32962	32962	nobody	341	" a voice was saying tragically . "
32968	32979	32964	32966	Edward the Confessor	187	" None of them took any notice of the foreman . "
32992	32997	32983	32983	I	0	" sighed the dragon . "
33075	33092	33070	33072	the good niggers	975	" I find that there are quite a lot of people who can not say the word "
33094	33123	33045	33045	they	973	" without adding the clause about the good niggers . These people have vague minds , sown like an allotment with phrases in grooves . Directly the dragon said "
33127	33143	33144	33144	I	0	" without qualifying the extent , one saw why it had no gift of discipline . "
33151	33162	33144	33144	I	0	" it continued , winding breathlessly along the rutty road , "
33331	33352	33320	33320	I	0	" They reached a part of a field in which broad beans were enjoying an innocent childhood among white butterflies . "
33359	33365	33320	33320	I	0	" said the dragon shyly , "
33400	33476	33394	33394	I	0	" All the other rows were occupied by fairy women with their skirts tucked up — for only your amateur land - woman wears breeches . They all had hoes , but were not using them much . They were singing curious old round songs like summer dreams ; you could hear strange fragments of phrases passing from voice to voice . They took no notice of Sarah Brown , and she began to work . "
33482	33488	33394	33394	I	0	" she said to David . "
33544	33884	33516	33518	the Shropshire Lad	986	" David sat uncomfortably on a broad bean , protesting against this new mania . For a moment he had thought that she was seeking for a mouse with some patent mouse - finding implement . He had even tried to help her , and turned over a clod with a critical paw , but one sniff had showed him the empty futility of the thing . Sarah Brown hoed rather happily for a couple of hours , and then she began to count the beans still waiting trustfully in the queue , waiting to be attended to and freed from their embarrassments . There were ninety - six , she decided , standing up ostensibly to greet an aeroplane . She became very glad of the occasional aeroplanes that crossed above her field , and gave her an excuse for standing with a straight back to watch them . Aeroplanes , crossing singly or in wild - bird formations , are so common in the sky of Faery that every one in those parts , while turning his own eyes inevitably upwards , secretly thinks his neighbour lamentably rustic and unsophisticated for looking at them . Every aeroplane that crosses Faery feels , I suppose , the reflected magic from the land below , for there is never one with the barest minute to spare that does not pause and try to be clever over Higgins Farm . You may see one industriously climbing the clouds over the Enchanted Forest , evidently trying hard to be intent on its destination . You may see it falter , struggling with its sense of duty , and then break weakly into a mild figure eight . The ragged rooks of Faery at once hurry into the air to show their laborious imitator how this should be done . The spirit of frivolous competition enters into the aeroplane , its duty is flung to the winds . It flaunts itself up and down once or twice , as if to say : "
33897	34343	33890	33890	I	0	" Then it goes mad . It leaps upon imaginary Boches , it stands upon its head and falls downward until the very butterflies begin to take cover , it stands upon its tail and falls upward , it writes messages in a flowing hand across the sky and returns to cross the t 's . It circles impertinently round your head , fixing its bold tricolour eye upon you until you begin to think there must be something wrong with your appearance . It bounds upon a field of onions and rebounds in the same breath from the topmost cloud of heaven . The rooks return disconsolately to their nests . Then you may see the erring machine suddenly remember itself , and check itself in the act of some new paroxysm . It remembers the European War that gave it birth ; it thinks of its mates scanning the sky for its coming ; its frivolity ebbs suddenly . The eastern sky becomes once more its highway instead of its trapeze . It collects its wits , emits a few contrite bubbles of smoke , and leaps beyond sight . Whenever this happened , the female fairies behaved in a very plebeian and forward manner , waving their hoes at each machine , encouraging it by brazen gestures to further extravagances , and striving to reach its hearing with loud shrill cries . There was very little difference between these fairies and other lady war - workers . In fact they were only distinguishable by their stature and by the empty and innocent expression of their faces . Also perhaps by their tuneful singing , and by a habit of breaking out suddenly into country dances between the bean - rows . Sarah Brown , who worked a great deal more industriously than any one else in sight , soon overtook them , and while conscious of that touch of interested scorn always felt by the One towards the Herd , found relief in watching their vagaries , and presently in speaking to them . For she needed relief , poor Sarah Brown , her disabilities were catching her up ; a hoarse contralto cough was reminding her of many doctors ' warnings against manual work . She could feel , so to speak , the distant approaching tramp of that pain in her side under whose threat she had lived all her life . But there were seventy - five beans yet . The note of her hoe , a high note not quite true pitched , clamoured monotonously upon her brain . Three blisters and a half were persecuting her hands . "
34348	34353	33890	33890	I	0	" she said defiantly . "
34374	34458	33890	33890	I	0	" She could almost imagine she saw Death , waiting for her tactfully beyond the last bean . She had no sense of proportion . She was so very weary of having her life interrupted by her weakness that anything that she had begun to do always seemed to her worth finishing , even under torture . To finish every task , in spite of all hindrance , was her only ambition , but it was almost always frustrated . Seventy more beans . "
34464	34469	33890	33890	I	0	" thought Sarah Brown . "
34478	34514	33890	33890	I	0	" She bent to her work . A great clump of buttercups bestrode her bean row , and as after a struggle she dragged its protesting roots from the earth , something fell from it . "
34520	34524	33890	33890	I	0	" she gasped . "
34534	34535	34527	34527	I	0	" "
34539	34544	34527	34527	I	0	" exclaimed a fairy . "
34580	34636	34572	34572	Clement	193	" Cries of consternation were heard from every bean - row . Clement 's nest was really almost more than semi - detached . It had been but lightly wedged between two buttercup stalks . The two eggs in it were at once unseated , and one was broken . Sarah Brown was deeply distressed . "
34644	34655	34638	34640	a blind fool	992	" she said , trying helplessly to replace the nest . "
34663	34664	34665	34666	Mrs. Clement	193	" "
34670	34676	34677	34677	She	193	" said the nearest fairy . "
34700	34701	34692	34692	She	193	" "
34710	34715	34708	34708	Clement	193	" said Sarah Brown . "
34723	34724	34726	34726	he	990	" "
34729	34737	34726	34726	he	990	" replied the fairy , pointing upward . "
34751	34752	34753	34753	Clement	193	" "
34757	34762	34753	34753	Clement	193	" exclaimed Sarah Brown . "
34774	34775	34769	34769	he	990	" "
34779	34784	34769	34769	he	990	" mocked the fairy . "
34810	34830	34802	34802	you	0	" Sarah Brown with despairing care tucked the nest up under a bean , and replaced the unbroken egg . "
34840	34850	34832	34832	you	0	" she said , after a busy painful pause , "
34885	34886	34878	34878	you	0	" "
34890	34895	34878	34878	you	0	" said the fairy . "
34931	35323	34913	34913	Shelley	194	" Sarah Brown , with a deep sigh , began hoeing again . Fifty beans yet . She had altogether ceased to find pleasure in the day . Pain is an extinguisher that can put out the sun . She had ceased to find pleasure in the singing of the birds , the voice of the pigeon sounded to her no more than an unbeautiful falsetto growl . She was irritated by the fact that the cuckoo had only one song to sing . She tried not to hoe in time to that song , but the monotony of it possessed her . Her row of beans stretched in front of her right across the world ; every time she looked along it the end seemed farther away . Every time she raised her hoe the sword of pain slipped under her guard . The Dog David , impatient of her unnatural taste in occupations , had forsaken her . She could trace his course by a moving ripple across the potato patch , just as a shark 's movement seams the sea . Forty beans . Time wears a strangely different guise out of doors . Under the sun time stands almost still . Only when every minute is a physical effort do you discover that there really are sixty minutes in an hour , and that one hour is very little nearer to the evening than another . People who work indoors under the government of clocks never meet time face to face . Their quick seconds are dismissed by the clicking of typewriters , and when their typewriters fall silent , their day is over . We of Out of Doors have a daily eternity to contend with during which only our hands are busy ; our minds may grow old and young again between sunrise and sunset ; the future may be remade in an hour , hope killed and reborn before a blackbird 's song is over . We know the length of days . And after many slow months of stress we come back again , old and bewildered with much silence and much wondering , to our friends in offices , and find them unchanged , floating innocently on the surface of time . Sarah Brown dropped her hoe and fell upon her knees . "
35331	35335	35324	35324	I	0	" she said . "
35351	35352	35345	35345	I	0	" "
35357	35364	35355	35355	you	0	" asked the nearest fairy indifferently . "
35377	35378	35379	35379	I	0	" "
35387	35392	35379	35379	I	0	" said Sarah Brown . "
35411	35419	35420	35420	I	0	" Even in affliction she was prosy . "
35431	35436	35420	35420	I	0	" another fairy said . "
35467	35468	35469	35469	I	0	" "
35474	35479	35469	35469	I	0	" said Sarah Brown . "
35484	35547	35469	35469	I	0	" said the fairies , and passed on , tickling but not uprooting the weeds in their rows . Fairies are never ill . They have immortal bodies , but no souls . If they see you in pain , they simply think you are flaunting your superiority and your immortal soul in their faces . The dragon undulated up the field . "
35552	35564	35469	35469	I	0	" he said , looking vaguely at Sarah Brown 's row . "
35580	35660	35672	35674	The said mind	1000	" He never noticed the twenty - five unhoed beans . Sarah Brown sat on the edge of a shore of green shadow , and a sea of sun speckled with buttercups was before her . David Blessing came and leaned against her . His first intentions were good , he kissed her hurriedly on the chin , but after that he kissed the sandwich bag . Sarah Brown wondered whether she could cut her throat with a hoe . "
35667	35671	35672	35674	The said mind	1000	" she said . "
35683	36171	35672	35674	The said mind	1000	" If she sat absolutely still and upright the pain was bearable . But even to think of movement brought tears of pain to her eyes . She detached her mind from her predicament , and sank into a warm tropical sea of thought . She was no real thinker , but she thought much about thinking , and was passionately interested in watching her own mind at work . Thought was like sleep to her , she sank deeply into it without reaching anything profound , nothing resulted but useless dreams , and a certain comforting and defiant intimacy with herself . She thought of Richard , and wished that she could have hoed a blessing into every bean of his that she had hoed . She noted half - consciously and without surprise that the thought of him was beautiful to her . She could not conjure up his face before her mind , because she always forgot realities , and only remembered dreams . She could not imagine the sound of his voice , she could not recall anything that he had said . Yet she felt again the magic feeling of meeting him , and dreamt of all the things that might have happened , and that might yet happen , yet never would happen , between him and her . All the best things that she remembered had only happened in her dreams , her imagination no sooner sipped the first sip of an experience than it conjured up for her great absurd satisfying draughts of nectar , for which the waking Sarah Brown might thirst in vain . But there was no waking Sarah Brown . Her life was only a sleep - walking ; only very rarely did she awake for a moment and feel ashamed to see how alert was the world about her . So she thought of Richard , not of Richard 's Richard , but of some pale private Richard of her own . The approach of Richard upon a white horse for some time seemed only an extension of her dream . It was only when she realised that he was riding up her bean - row , and partially undoing the work of her hoe , that she awoke suddenly with a start , and caught and tore her breath upon a pin of pain . It seemed that the afternoon had now long possessed the fields , it had wakened into a live and electric blue the Enchanted Forest which she had last noticed shimmering in its noon green . All the workers at the approach of Richard were working busily , bent ostentatiously in the form of hairpins up and down their rows . The dragon was rippling anxiously along at the heels of the white horse ; a helpless hoping for the best expressed itself in every spike along his spine . "
36184	36196	36197	36197	I	0	" Sarah Brown heard him say in his breathy pathetic voice . "
36228	36229	36225	36225	his	979	" "
36247	36271	36235	36235	Leverhulme	195	" asked Richard politely of Sarah Brown , in the manner of an advertisement of a cure for indigestion , as he approached . "
36289	36290	36291	36291	I	0	" "
36296	36305	36291	36291	I	0	" replied Sarah Brown candidly , if faintly . "
36328	36329	36322	36322	my	0	" "
36344	36355	36358	36358	you	0	" said Richard , slapping himself enquiringly over several pockets . "
36386	36387	36375	36375	I	0	" "
36400	36539	36540	36540	I	0	" said Sarah Brown . The pain was like a wave breaking upon her , carrying her away from her safe shore of shadow , to be lost in seething and suffocating seas without rest . Her eyes felt dried up with fever , and whenever she shut them , the darkness was filled with a jumble of nauseating squares in blue upon a mustard - coloured background . The smell of beans was terrible . Richard fumbled with something very badly folded up in newspaper . He also tried ineffectively to light a match by wiping it helplessly against his riding breeches . He seemed to have none of the small skill in details that comes to most people before they grow up . He did everything as if he were doing it for the first time . "
36552	36556	36540	36540	I	0	" he murmured . "
36569	36597	36599	36599	me	0	" It was the dragon finally who produced the necessary light . After watching Richard with the anxious sympathy of one ineffectual for another , it said : "
36601	37073	36599	36599	me	0	" and kindly breathed out a little flame , which set the packet aflare for a moment . The ashes fluttered down from Richard 's hand among the beans , and a thin violet stalk of smoke went up . Sarah Brown smelt the unmistakable sour smell of magic , and saw soundless words moving Richard 's little khaki moustache . Then she found that she had disappeared . She had never done this before , she had always been present to disturb and interrupt herself . She had never seen the world before , except through the little glazed peepholes , called eyes , through which her everyday self rather wistfully believed that it could see . Now , of course , she knew what seeing was , and for the first time she was aware of the real sizes of things . Poor man measures all things by the size of his own foot . He looks complacently at the print of his boot in the mud , and notices that the ant which he crushed was not nearly as big as his foot , therefore the ant does not matter to him . He also notices that those same feet of his would not be able to walk to the moon within a reasonable time , therefore the moon does not matter to him . But Sarah Brown had disappeared , and therefore could not measure anything . The spider strode from hill to hill , with the wind rushing through the hair on his back . The blue sky was just a lampshade , clipped on to the earth to shield it from the glare of the gods , beyond it was a mere roof of eternity , pricked with a few billion stars to keep it well ventilated . Sarah Brown had for a while all the fun of being a god . She was nowhere and she was everywhere . She could have counted the hairs on David 's head . The world waved like a flower upon a thin purple stalk of smoke .... Her eyes began to see again . She was aware , of the hollowed tired eyes of Richard fixed upon her . The dragon dawned once more upon her sight , it was inquisitively watching developments , while pretending to claw a weed or two out of a neighbouring bean - row . The horizon was rusty with a rather heavy sunset . The fields were full of twilight and empty of fairies . Sarah Brown came to herself with a start , she was shocked to find that she had opened her mouth to say something absolutely impossible to Richard . David 's chin was resting on her hand . Her side felt frozen and dangerous but not painful . "
37080	37084	37085	37085	I	0	" said Richard . "
37123	37678	37121	37121	Vivian	196	" The Horse Vivian , who was so white as to be almost phosphorescent in the dusk , was now further illuminated by a little red light on his breast , and a little green light on his tail . Richard was fond of making elaborate and unnecessary arrangements like this , while neglecting to acquire skill in the more usual handicrafts . Sarah Brown , a person of little weight , was placed astride on the back of the Horse Vivian . Richard walked beside . The dragon nodded good - bye , and disappeared into its home , a low tunnel - like barn , evidently built specially for it , with a door at each end , and a conveniently placed chimney which enabled it to breathe enough fire to cook its meals without suffocating itself . Sarah Brown never saw the dragon again , but it stayed always in her memory as a puzzled soul born tragically out of its time , a shorn lamb , so to speak , to whom the wind had not been sufficiently tempered . Now this ride home , through the Enchanted Forest , on a tall horse , with Richard walking beside her , was the most perfect hour of Sarah Brown 's life . The Enchanted Forest is only an accumulation of dreams , and from every traveller through it it exacts toll in the shape of a dream . By way of receipt , to every traveller it gives a darling memory that neither death nor hell nor paradise can efface . Sarah Brown knew that her dream and Richard 's could never meet . The fact that he was thinking of some one else all the way home was not hidden from her . But she was a person used to living alone , she could enjoy quite lonely romances , and never even envy real women , whose romances were always made for two . She was not a real woman , she was morbidly bodiless . Strange though it may seem , the kind , awkward , absent - minded touch of Richard as he had lifted her on to the Horse Vivian 's back had been for her the one flaw in that enchanted ride . She could not bear touch . She had no pleasure in seeing or feeling the skin and homespun that encloses men and women . She hated to watch people feeding themselves , or to see her own thin body in the mirror . She ought really to have been born a poplar tree ; a human body was a gift wasted on her . As they passed along the Green Ride , the red light from the Horse Vivian 's neck made a sort of heralding ghost before them on the grass . Bats darted above them for a few yards at a time , and were twitched aside as though by a string or a reminding conscience . The telegraph wires , bound for the post office of Faery , run through the Enchanted Forest , and the poles in the faint light were like tall crucifixes . A long way off , through the opening at the end of the Forest , were the little lights of Mitten Island . "
37683	37706	37680	37680	you	1011	" said Richard — and this is unfortunately the sort of thing that young men do say at silent and enchanted moments — "
37737	37738	37739	37739	My	0	" "
37742	37747	37739	37739	My	0	" said Sarah Brown . "
37752	37753	37739	37739	My	0	" "
37758	37759	37760	37760	My	0	" "
37763	37768	37760	37760	My	0	" said Sarah Brown . "
37783	37787	37788	37788	I	0	" said Richard . "
37798	37820	37821	37822	Good Lord	197	" suggested Sarah Brown , trying to talk intelligently and to be faithful to her own thoughts at the same time . "
37826	37830	37821	37822	Good Lord	197	" replied Richard . "
37911	37912	37879	37879	you	1011	" "
37921	37926	37879	37879	you	1011	" sighed Sarah Brown . "
37930	37934	37879	37879	you	1011	" said Richard , "
37969	37970	37998	37999	This century	1015	" "
37996	37997	37998	37999	This century	1015	" "
38008	38012	37998	37999	This century	1015	" said Richard . "
38191	38514	38597	38597	I	0	" Richard seemed to be becoming less and less of a man and more and more of a wizard the farther he penetrated into the Enchanted Forest . He was saying things that would have embarrassed him very much had they been said in the Piccadilly Restaurant , even after three glasses of champagne . For this reason , although the borders of the Enchanted Forest are said to be widening , it is to be hoped that they will not encroach beyond the confines of the Parish of Faery . What would happen if its trees began to seed themselves in the Strand ? Imagine the Stock Exchange under the shadow of an enchanted oak , and the consequent disastrous wearing thin of the metal casing in which all good business men keep their souls . Sarah Brown thought if rather a curious coincidence that so soon after they had spoken of the dead Keats they should see him alive . They saw him framed in a little pale aisle of the Forest , a faintly defined fragile ghost , crouched against the trunk of a tree , bent awkwardly into an attitude of pain forgotten and ecstatic attention . It was his dearest moment that they saw , a moment without death . For he was a prisoner in a perfect spell ; he was utterly entangled in the looped and ensnaring song of a nightingale . The song was like beaten gold wire . Never again in her life did Sarah Brown profane with her poor voice the words that a perfect singer begot in a marriage with a perfect song . But in unhappiness , and in the horrible nights , the song came to her , always .... The travellers were approaching the end of the Green Ride , but that did not matter to Sarah Brown , for there had been nothing lacking all the way . "
38519	38554	38597	38597	I	0	" began Richard in a loud exalted voice , and then suddenly a searchlight glared diagonally across the end of the Ride , over Mitten Island , and quenched the magic of the moment . "
38557	38561	38562	38562	I	0	" said Richard . "
38572	38573	38564	38564	I	0	" "
38581	38593	38594	38594	I	0	" said Sarah Brown , as they emerged from the Forest . "

38617	38653	38603	38603	me	0	" said the Mayor , meeting the witch towards three o'clock in the afternoon , as she came down the Broad Walk towards Kensington , having slept invisibly among the daffodils for nearly twelve hours . "
38687	38691	38681	38681	I	0	" He winked . "
38702	38712	38681	38681	I	0	" said the witch , winking busily in return . "
38724	38729	38719	38719	you	0	" said the Mayor . "
38734	38735	38736	38736	You	0	" "
38743	38748	38740	38740	your	0	" he retorted indulgently . "
39168	39169	39161	39161	I	0	" "
39176	39181	39170	39170	You	1031	" said the witch . "
39259	39260	39261	39261	You	1031	" "
39268	39273	39261	39261	You	1031	" murmured the Mayor . "
39300	39301	39275	39275	I	0	" "
39304	39309	39275	39275	I	0	" said the witch . "
39336	39384	39323	39323	I	0	" They found themselves presently seated at the marble - topped table of an A.B.C. After an interval that could hardly be accurately described as presently , sausages and mash dawned on the horizon , and the witch waved her fork rudely at it as it approached . "
39393	39413	39323	39323	I	0	" she said , roughing in a ground plan upon her plate with the sure carelessness of the artist . "
39457	39458	39446	39448	the emprisoned princess	1043	" "
39466	39471	39463	39464	Miss Watkins	104	" interrupted the Mayor . "
39492	39493	39483	39483	I	0	" "
39500	39505	39506	39506	You	0	" asked the witch . "
39554	39555	39545	39545	I	0	" "
39562	39567	39558	39558	I	0	" exclaimed the Mayor . "
39577	39589	39574	39574	I	0	" He laid a large meat - like hand upon hers . "
39684	39720	39721	39721	I	0	" He seemed very persistent in applying negatived adjectives to himself . It was not his fault if the world failed to grasp exactly what he was , or rather exactly what he was not . "
39726	39731	39721	39721	I	0	" interrupted the witch , "
39766	39767	39815	39815	you	0	" "
39772	39778	39815	39815	you	0	" ordered the Mayor irritably . "
39789	39790	39815	39815	you	0	" "
39803	39808	39793	39793	you	0	" said the witch . "
39827	39828	39818	39818	I	0	" "
39834	39844	39832	39832	miss	1354	" said the Mayor ungraciously to a passing whirlwind . "
39850	39851	39832	39832	miss	1354	" "
39857	39944	39832	39832	miss	1354	" echoed the whirlwind to a little hole in the wall . The witch had a silly vision of two distressed dumplings , like dilatory chorus girls , mad with the nightmare feeling of not being dressed in time , hearing their cue called in a heartless voice from the inexorable sky , desperately applying the last dab of flour to their imperfect complexions . But the witch found no fault with them when they came . She gave them her whole attention for some minutes . "
39949	39960	39832	39832	miss	1354	" she said , laying down her fork and spoon , "
40054	40055	40056	40056	You	1058	" "
40063	40072	40056	40056	You	1058	" said the Mayor in a hollow voice . "
40098	40167	40087	40087	I	0	" There , of course , he was right . A heart is a sort of degree conferred by Providence on those who have passed a certain examination . Magic people are only freshmen in our college , and it is useless for us — secure in the possession of many learned letters after our names — to despise them . They will become sophisticated in due course . "
40174	40180	40087	40087	I	0	" asked the witch therefore . "
40225	40761	40219	40219	She	96	" There was a most abrupt and disturbing draught in Miss Ford 's sleek and decorous flat as the witch and the Mayor entered it . The serenity of the night and the morning had been suddenly obliterated , and Kensington suffered a gust or two of gritty wind which blew the babies home from the Gardens , and kept all the window - gazers in the High Street on the alert with their fingers on the triggers of their umbrellas . But no rain fell . Rain can not fall in this book of fine weather . The draught that intruded into the flat ruffled the neat hair of five persons , Miss Ford herself , Lady Arabel Higgins , Miss Ivy MacBee , Mr. Bernard Tovey , and Mr. Darnby Frere . Miss MacBee always seemed to be seated on tenterhooks , even in the most comfortable of chairs . Her Spartan spine never consented graciously to the curves of cushions . She had smooth padded hair and smooth padded manners , and her eyes were magnified by thick pince - nez to a cow - like size . Most people , especially most women , were instinctively sorry for her , because she always looked a little clever and very uncomfortable . Mr. Bernard Tovey was a blunt - nosed beaming person . He leaned forward abruptly whenever he spoke , thereby swinging a lock of hair into his right eye . He agreed so heartily with everything that was said that people who addressed him were left with the happy impression that they had said something Rather Good . This habit , combined with the fact that he never launched an independent remark , had given him the reputation of being one of the best talkers in Kensington . Mr. Darnby Frere was the editor of an advanced religious paper called I Wonder , but he never wondered really . He knew almost everything , and therefore , while despising the public for knowing so little , he encouraged it to continue wondering , so that he might continue despising and instructing it . Now it was an almost unprecedented thing for two members of the small trades - man class to come into Miss Ford 's drawing - room , especially on a Wednesday . The utmost social mingling of the classes that those walls had ever seen was the moment when Miss Ford asked the electric light man what he thought of the war . The electric light man 's reply had been quoted in the dialect on two or three of the following Wednesdays , as a proof of Miss Ford 's daring intimacy with men in Another Station of Life . Really it would have been simpler , though of course not so picturesque , to have quoted it direct from its original source , John Bull , the electric light man 's Bible . The entrance of the witch and the Mayor was to a certain extent a crisis , but Miss Ford kept her head , and her three friends , though grasping at once the extraordinary situation , did not give way to panic . "
40768	40780	40219	40219	She	96	" said the Mayor , looking round and breathing very loudly . "
40793	41011	40219	40219	She	96	" He was not at all at his ease , but being a business man , and being also blessed with a peculiarly inexpressive face , he was successfully dissembling his discomfort . For it had happened that the lift had been one of those lifts that can do no wrong , the kind that the public is indulgently allowed to work by itself . And the Mayor , looking upon this fact as specially planned by a propitious god of love , had tried to kiss the witch as they shot up the darkened shaft . If I remind you that the witch was still accompanied by her broomstick , Harold , a creature of unreasoning fidelity , I need hardly describe the scene further . The Mayor stepped out of the lift with a tingling scraped face , and if he had possessed enough hair on his head , it would have been on end . As it was , when the lift stopped , he retrieved his hat from the floor with a frank oath , and , as the witch had at once rung the bell of Miss Ford 's flat , he instinctively followed her across that threshold . She looked round in the hall , and said with a friendly smile : "
41044	41060	41040	41040	he	117	" I am afraid the angry Mayor did not give Harold credit for much initiative . "
41072	41085	41086	41086	I	0	" said the witch briskly as she shook Miss Ford 's hand . "
41109	41136	41105	41105	I	0	" She interrupted herself as her eyes fell on some green sandwiches which were occupying the third floor of a wicker Eiffel Tower beside Miss Ford . "
41141	41145	41105	41105	I	0	" she said . "
41162	41189	41190	41190	You	1063	" Nobody present had ever been obliged to miss a meal , so this statement seemed to every one to be a message from another world . "
41204	41251	41201	41202	Miss Watkins	104	" said Miss Ford , leading the witch towards a chair by the fire . The witch sat down suddenly cross - legged on the hearth - rug , leaving her rather embarrassed hostess in the air , so to speak , towering rigidly above her . "
41258	41271	41272	41272	I	0	" said the witch , after eating one sandwich in silent ecstasy . "
41291	41292	41320	41320	she	1066	" "
41305	41314	41320	41320	she	1066	" said Mr. Frere with rather sour joviality . "
41323	41329	41320	41320	she	1066	" said Miss MacBee earnestly . "
41341	41342	41330	41330	I	0	" "
41346	41351	41343	41344	Great Scott	180	" exclaimed the witch . "
41355	41356	41359	41359	I	0	" "
41362	41367	41359	41359	I	0	" persisted Miss MacBee . "
41431	41432	41433	41433	I	0	" "
41441	41454	41433	41433	I	0	" sighed the witch , who had been looking a little puzzled . "
41509	41527	41492	41492	she	1071	" It was Miss MacBee 's turn to look puzzled , but she said to Miss Ford : "
41539	41580	41531	41531	you	1340	" Mr. Frere , though emitting an applauding murmur , leaned back and fixed his face in the ambiguous expression of one who , while listening with interest to the conversation of liars , is determined not to appear deceived . "
41587	41592	41593	41593	I	0	" asked the witch . "
41607	41614	41605	41605	me	0	" she added to Miss Ford , "
41644	41645	41630	41630	you	1340	" "
41651	41657	41646	41646	We	1074	" said Miss Ford indulgently . "
41664	41940	41659	41659	I	0	" The witch did not answer ; she rose , and as she rose she threw a little white paper packet into the fire . She danced round the sofa and the chairs . The floor shook a little , and all her watchers twisted their necks gravely , like lizards watching an active fly . The parlour - maid , by appearing in the doorway with an inaudible announcement , diverted their attention , though she did not interrupt the witch 's exercises . A very respectable - looking man came in . Darnby Frere , who was a student of Henry James 's works , and therefore constantly made elaborate guesses on matters that did not concern him , and then forgot them because — unlike Mr. James 's guesses — they were always wrong , gave the newcomer credit for being perhaps a shopwalker , or perhaps a South - Eastern and Chatham ticket - collector , but surely a chapel - goer . At any rate the stranger looked ill at ease , and especially disconcerted by the sight of the dancing witch . Miss Ford realised by now that her Wednesday had for some reason gone mad . She had lost her hold on the reins of that usually dignified equipage ; there was nothing now for her to do but to grip tight and keep her head . She therefore concealed her ignorance of her newest guest 's identity , she stiffened her lips and poured out another cup of tea with a nerveless hand . The stranger took the cup of tea with some relief , and said : "
41946	41962	41942	41942	you	1078	" The witch stopped dancing , and stood in front of the newcomer 's chair . "
41972	41978	41965	41965	yours	1080	" she said to him . "
42136	42137	42128	42128	you	1080	" "
42148	42154	42146	42146	miss	1354	" said the newcomer coldly . "
42176	42183	42167	42167	I	0	" he added to Miss Ford . "
42223	42224	42212	42212	you	1354	" "
42230	42264	42212	42212	you	1354	" said Miss Ford , who was staring vaguely into the fireplace . A rather fascinating thread of lilac smoke was spinning itself out of the ashes of the little white paper packet . "
42454	42527	42528	42528	You	1354	" There was a stunned silence in the room , broken only by the pastoral sound of the witch eating grassy sandwiches . After a moment Miss Ford , the Mayor , and Lady Arabel all began speaking at once , and each stopped with a look of relief on hearing that some one else was ready to take the responsibility of speaking . Then the witch began with her mouth full : "
42533	42540	42528	42528	You	1354	" but Lady Arabel interrupted her . "
42589	42590	42582	42583	Our committee	1109	" "
42601	42607	42593	42596	Lady A. ' Iggins	207	" said the policeman impassively . "
42675	42703	42704	42704	I	0	" The threads of curious smoke in the fireplace were increasing . They shivered as though with laughter , and flowed like crimped hair up the chimney . "
42714	42769	42704	42704	I	0	" stammered Lady Arabel . A trembling seized the sock she was knitting . She had turned the heel some time ago , but in the present stress had forgotten all about the toe . The prolonged sock grew every minute more and more like a drain - pipe with a bend in it . "
42818	42819	42798	42800	this young lady	1117	" "
42830	42841	42798	42800	this young lady	1117	" asked the policeman , glancing haughtily at the witch . "
42884	42885	42917	42921	Depend - on - able	1123	" "
42888	42893	42917	42921	Depend - on - able	1123	" said the witch , "
42924	42925	42917	42921	Depend - on - able	1123	" "
42939	42944	42933	42933	you	0	" interrupted the policeman . "
42952	42959	42933	42933	you	0	" answered Lady Arabel , wincing . "
42978	42979	42933	42933	you	0	" "
42984	42993	42933	42933	you	0	" spelt the policeman aloud into his notebook . "
43010	43011	43012	43012	I	0	" "
43015	43030	43012	43012	I	0	" said the witch . The policeman withered her once more with a glance . "
43053	43054	43036	43036	you	0	" "
43060	43061	43063	43063	you	0	" "
43068	43069	43063	43063	you	0	" "
43077	43082	43070	43070	You	0	" said Lady Arabel . "
43109	43110	43093	43093	Rrchud	112	" "
43117	43129	43112	43112	you	0	" repeated the policeman coldly , and turned to Miss Ford . "
43145	43151	43133	43134	the cherecter	1100	" he asked of her . "
43154	43158	43133	43134	the cherecter	1100	" she replied . "
43186	43187	43177	43177	you	0	" "
43190	43195	43198	43198	you	0	" said Miss Ford . "
43206	43207	43198	43198	you	0	" "
43210	43215	43216	43216	I	0	" said Miss Ford . "
43219	43228	43216	43216	I	0	" said the witch . The policeman bridled . "
43264	43265	43242	43242	you	0	" "
43268	43273	43242	43242	you	0	" said Miss Ford . "
43277	43299	43242	43242	you	0	" said Lady Arabel . The fumes from the fireplace were very strong indeed , but nobody called attention to them . "
43305	43315	43242	43242	you	0	" said Miss Ford pres ently , very slowly , "
43341	43362	43416	43416	sir	1140	" The policeman fixed his ominous gaze upon her for quite a minute before he wrote something in his notebook . "
43374	43385	43365	43365	Richard	164	" he asked of Lady Arabel in a casual voice . "
43390	43394	43365	43365	Richard	164	" she replied . "
43405	43413	43416	43416	sir	1140	" The policeman turned to the Mayor . "
43418	43422	43416	43416	sir	1140	" he said . "
43432	43433	43424	43424	you	1140	" "
43437	43444	43424	43424	you	1140	" said the witch , rising . "
43501	43509	43492	43492	I	0	" Mr. Tovey mechanically produced a coin . "
43514	43561	43512	43512	Harold	117	" called the witch , and holding Harold 's collar she stepped out on to the balcony , mounted , and flew away . She left a room full of noise behind her . The policeman , who was intoxicated with the strange fumes , said : "
43568	43575	43576	43576	Angela	113	" Lady Arabel called in vain : "
43587	43619	43576	43576	Angela	113	" Mr. Tovey , now afflicted with a lock of hair in each eye , seized the policeman by the shoulder thinking to prevent him from jumping out of the window . "
43623	43637	43620	43621	You fool	1143	" he shouted . The Mayor slapped his thigh with a loud report . "
43640	43644	43638	43638	Lawdy	114	" he yelled . "
43658	43671	43650	43650	She	114	" Miss MacBee laughed hysterically and very loudly . Mr. Darnby Frere said "
43674	43787	43788	43788	You	1145	" rather cautiously several times , and rubbed the bridge of his nose . He rather thought everybody was pulling his leg , but could not be sure . Only Miss Ford sat silent . When Sarah Brown and Richard , followed by the Dog David , reached the Mitten Island Ferry , after travelling slowly by moonlight , they were surprised to see a great crowd of people banked up on the Island , and one man in the uniform of a policeman , standing alone on the mainland . About ten yards from land the ferryman sat in his boat , rowing gently to keep himself stationary in the current . "
43798	43813	43788	43788	You	1145	" said the policeman , in the tone of one exhausted by long argument . "
43824	43830	43817	43822	some more parties wanting to cross	1147	" He turned to Richard . "
43837	43841	43835	43835	mate	1148	" he said . "
43861	43862	43863	43863	Deah	210	" "
43867	43875	43863	43863	Deah	210	" said Richard . The ferryman said : "
43927	43946	43947	43947	Yah	1152	" The crowd across the river , divining that a climax of defiance was being reached , shouted : "
43951	43955	43947	43947	Yah	1152	" in unison . "
43968	43978	43979	43979	I	0	" asked the policeman of Sarah Brown and Richard . "
43982	43992	43979	43979	I	0	" said Richard , to his companion 's surprise . "
44045	44046	44019	44021	Hangela the Witch	1156	" "
44056	44060	44019	44021	Hangela the Witch	1156	" said Richard . "
44132	44196	44197	44198	That party	1165	" The policeman seemed to be troubled all the time by mosquitoes . He slapped his face and his ears and the back of his neck . He succeeded in killing one insect upon the bridge of his nose , and left it there by mistake , a strangely ignoble corpse . Sarah Brown suspected Richard of some responsibility for this untimely persecution . "
44212	44218	44263	44263	Deah	210	" said the policeman , — "
44251	44252	44197	44198	That party	1165	" "
44258	44262	44197	44198	That party	1165	" said Richard . "
44269	44270	44263	44263	Deah	210	" "
44283	44373	44274	44274	you	1168	" persisted the policeman . Attacked on every side by insects , he was becoming rather pathetic in his discomfort and indignity . His small eyes , set in red fat , stared with uncomprehending protest ; his fat busy hands were not agile enough to defend him . He felt unsuccessful and foolish , and very near the ground . He wished quite disproportionately to be at home with his admiring wife in Acton . Sarah Brown shook her head in reply , and Richard could say nothing but "
44379	44380	44274	44274	you	1168	" "
44400	44410	44397	44398	young man	1170	" said the policeman , after a baffled pause . "
44415	44423	44412	44412	my	0	" said Richard , with genuine shame , "
44559	44560	44561	44561	You	1168	" "
44573	44587	44569	44571	my fine feller	1176	" said the distressed policeman , almost with a break in his voice . "
44637	44715	44629	44629	I	0	" He raised his whistle to his lips , but before he could blow it , the climax of this the least successful evening of his life , overwhelmed him . A shadow swept over the party , a large flying substance caught him full on the back of the neck and knocked him off the landing - stage into the river . The witch on Harold her Broomstick landed on the spot vacated by the policeman . "
44730	44760	44726	44726	I	0	" she exclaimed in an ecstasy of vexation . There was no need to tell anybody to look . Five hundred odd people were already doing so with enthusiasm . "
44780	44810	44771	44771	Harold	117	" She took the cringing Harold by the mane and slapped him violently once or twice . Richard stretched out his riding- crop to the splashing policeman , murmuring : "
44816	44817	44771	44771	Harold	117	" "
44823	44831	44832	44832	We	1180	" said the witch to the policeman . "
44901	44911	44891	44891	rats	1184	" Sarah Brown seized the witch by the shoulder . "
44917	44921	44915	44915	witch	1417	" she said . "
44929	44934	44935	44935	I	0	" asked the witch . "
44943	44944	44935	44935	I	0	" "
44951	44962	44935	44935	I	0	" was all that Sarah Brown could manage to repeat . "
44968	44980	44935	44935	I	0	" said the witch in her offended grown - up voice . "
44999	45048	44995	44995	I	0	" She seated herself with an irritable flouncing movement on Harold 's saddle , and flew away . The policeman climbed out of the water , looking like an enraged seal . Peals of laughter from the other side of the moonlit river robbed him of adequate words . "
45057	45076	45053	45055	my fine feller	1176	" he roared , seeing Richard kissing the Horse Vivian on the nose , preparatory to riding away . "
45097	45098	45084	45084	I	0	" "
45111	45124	45099	45099	You	1176	" said Richard , lifting one foot with dignity to the stirrup . "
45160	45203	45204	45205	Dear policeman	1188	" He twined one finger negligently into the mane on the Horse Vivian 's neck , and pulled himself slowly into the saddle . The policeman stood mysteriously impotent . Water dripped loudly from his clothes and punctuated Richard 's quiet speech . "
45207	45211	45204	45205	Dear policeman	1188	" continued Richard . "
45359	45386	45387	45387	I	0	" He shook the reins , and the Horse Vivian moved , treading quietly on the strip of grass that borders the path to the ferry . "
45398	45410	45411	45411	My	0	" said Richard , his voice fading away as he rode . "
45431	45507	45516	45517	my One	982	" For a moment he looked every inch a wizard . Every button on his uniform and every buckle on the Horse Vivian 's harness caught the moonlight , and changed into faery spangles as he turned and waved his hand before disappearing . The policeman seemed quieted , as he looked at Sarah Brown sitting , white and haggard with pain , on the river bank , with her arm round the shivering David . "
45519	45526	45516	45517	my One	982	" she was saying to David . "
45540	45553	45554	45554	I	0	" There was always something startlingly inoffensive about Sarah Brown 's appearance . "
45571	45587	45590	45590	I	0	" said the policeman . Sarah Brown did not hear him , but she said : "
45661	45666	45667	45667	I	0	" The ferryman shouted : "
45728	45729	45717	45720	that crowd over there	1201	" "
45740	45745	45730	45730	I	0	" said the policeman . "
45785	45811	45812	45812	They	1203	" As Sarah Brown landed on Mitten Island she could not distinguish the faces of the waiting crowd , but she heard sharp anxious voices . "
45827	45828	45829	45829	She	1204	" "
45839	45840	45835	45837	the dear lamb	1205	" "
45853	45854	45855	45855	She	1204	" "
45885	45886	45887	45887	She	1204	" "
45896	45897	45898	45898	She	1204	" "
45924	45925	45898	45898	She	1204	" "
45940	45941	45898	45898	She	1204	" "
45951	45952	45898	45898	She	1204	" "
45960	45965	45898	45898	She	1204	" said Sarah Brown . "
45975	45986	45898	45898	She	1204	" She staggered through the open door of the Shop . "
45993	46135	45989	45989	Richard	164	" she said to herself as she entered , and felt doubly alone because Richard was far away , riding to his True Love . She struck her last match , lit the lantern , and looked round . There was no sound in the house of Living Alone , she thought there would never again be any magic sound there to penetrate to her imprisoned hearing . The aprons hanging from the ceiling near the door flapped in the cold wind , and she thought they were like grey bats in a cave . The breeze blew out the open lantern . Ah , how desolate , how desolate .... A piece of paper was impaled upon the counter by means of a headless hatpin . There was something very largely and badly written on it . Sarah Brown read : "
46191	46610	46611	46611	I	0	" Sarah Brown climbed up the short stairway , painful step by painful step , to her cell . She sat on her bed holding her throbbing side , and breathing with fearful caution . She looked at the empty grate . She put a cigarette in her mouth , the unconscious and futile answer of the Dweller Alone to that blind hunger for comfort . But she had no matches , and presently , dimly conscious that her groping for comfort had lacked result , she absently put another cigarette into her mouth , and then felt a fool . She stared at the cold window . The sky seemed to be nailed carelessly to it by means of a crooked star or two . These are the terrible nights of Living Alone , when you have fever and sometimes think that your beloved stands in the doorway to bring you comfort , and sometimes think that you have no beloved , and that there is no one left in all the world , no word , no warmth , nor ever a kindly candle to be lighted in that spotted darkness that walls up your hot sight . Again on those nights you dream that you have already done those genial things your body cries for , or perhaps That Other has done them . The fire is built and alight at last , a cup of something cool and beautifully sour stands ready to your hand , you can hear the delicious rattle of china on a tray in the passage — someone coming with food you would love to look at , and presently perhaps to eat ... when you feel better . But again and again your eyes open on the cold dumb darkness , and there is nothing but the wind and strange sinister emptiness creaking on the stair . These are the terrible nights of Living Alone , yet no real lover of that house and of that state would ever exchange one of those haunted and desert nights for a night spent watched , in soft warm places . Sarah Brown was not long left alone that night to look at the strip of moonlight on the cold ashes of her fireplace . The Shop below shook suddenly with many footfalls , and the metallic officious barking of the Dog David rent the still air of her cell . A man 's voice at the foot of the stairs said : "
46618	46627	46611	46611	I	0	" And a woman 's voice followed it : "
46636	46662	46634	46634	you	113	" Sarah Brown was only aware of a vague and irksome disturbance . She groped to her door , opened it , and shouted miserably : "
46676	46687	46671	46671	She	113	" Lady Arabel came up , flashing an electric torch . "
46732	46733	46722	46722	we	1226	" "
46737	46738	46741	46741	Meta	96	" "
46779	46780	46771	46771	You	1106	" "
46785	46791	46771	46771	You	1106	" said Sarah Brown ungraciously . "
46805	46806	46792	46792	You	1106	" "
46815	46820	46792	46792	You	1106	" sighed Lady Arabel . "
46925	47032	46910	46910	Meta	96	" She led the way downstairs . Mr. Tovey and the Mayor were talking at the foot of the stairs , Mr. Frere was listening sardonically . As Sarah Brown went past them into the Shop , she smelt the unflower - like scent that always denoted the presence of Miss Ford . Sarah Brown herself was accompanied by nothing more seductive than a faint smell of gasoline , showing that her clothes had lately been home - cleaned . In the darkness of the Shop she saw Miss Ford stooping , trying to shut the big difficult drawer in which the witch kept her magic . "
47038	47051	46910	46910	Meta	96	" said Sarah Brown . Miss Ford started and straightened her back . "
47063	47088	47057	47057	I	0	" Sarah Brown sat gasping on the counter , and the rest of the party re - entered the Shop , bringing the lantern . "
47096	47103	47057	47057	I	0	" said Miss Ford nervously , — "
47116	47117	47057	47057	I	0	" "
47124	47129	47057	47057	I	0	" said Lady Arabel . "
47190	47191	47180	47180	Babel	220	" "
47199	47216	47192	47192	You	1244	" said Mr. Darnby Frere , who was the only person present really conscious of sanity . "
47235	47236	47192	47192	You	1244	" "
47244	47266	47267	47267	We	1238	" said Sarah Brown . Miss Ford moved instinctively behind the counter towards the open drawer full of ingredients for happiness . "
47271	47276	47267	47267	We	1238	" added Mr. Frere , "
47306	47307	47302	47302	we	1238	" "
47316	47321	47310	47310	Darnby	129	" said Miss Ford . "
47351	47352	47341	47341	I	0	" "
47359	47364	47367	47367	you	129	" said Sarah Brown . "
47370	47371	47367	47367	you	129	" "
47388	47389	47386	47386	yourself	1247	" "
47429	47451	47393	47427	some of you ladies , movin ' in the ' ighest circles , knows of gentlemen in the Foreign Office that would do a little shut - eye job , for old times ' sake	1248	" suggested the Mayor . This was a challenge to Miss Ford . She ceased to gaze haughtily on Sarah Brown . "
47468	47472	47464	47466	friends of mine	1254	" she said . "
47490	47517	47474	47474	I	0	" There was silence , while Miss Ford toyed gingerly with one of the paper packets out of the witch 's drawer . Presently she said : "
47522	47529	47520	47520	Richard	164	" Lady Arabel showed sudden irritation . "
47579	47580	47568	47568	One	277	" "
47590	47596	47581	47581	You	1247	" said Miss Ford coldly . "
47618	47637	47581	47581	You	1247	" As if unconsciously she tore off one corner of the packet of magic she held before adding : "
47668	47696	47697	47697	Richard	164	" Sarah Brown , who was burying her face in her hands and missing much of the conversation , caught the name of Richard , and said : "
47705	47713	47697	47697	Richard	164	" A tempest of restrained embarrassment arose . "
47718	47726	47714	47714	She	1259	" murmured Miss Ford , turning scarlet . "
47731	47737	47729	47729	Sarah	115	" said Lady Arabel tartly . "
47783	47784	47778	47778	Rrchud	112	" "
47792	47808	47785	47785	I	0	" said Miss Ford , deciding to ignore Sarah Brown both now and in future . "
47814	47815	47764	47764	his	112	" "
47820	47825	47764	47764	his	112	" replied Sarah Brown . "
47834	47850	47854	47854	people	357	" Miss Ford was pouring a grain or two of the magic into her palm . "
47857	47867	47854	47854	people	357	" she said with a self - conscious smile . "
47881	47919	47874	47874	she	104	" She stopped , for an astonishing sharp smell filled the Shop . Almost immediately a curious wheezy sound , punctuated by taps , proceeded from the corner . It was Mr. Bernard Tovey trying to sing , "
47928	47962	47963	47963	I	0	" and beating time by swinging his heels against the counter on which he sat . Sarah Brown felt suddenly well . She trembled but was well . She jumped off the counter . "
47972	47976	47963	47963	I	0	" she said , "
48012	48052	48005	48006	the ferryman	1384	" As she left , the smell of magic was getting stronger and stronger . Mr. Tovey , still impersonating Delilah in the corner , was approaching the more excitable passages of the song . Miss Ford was saying , "
48057	48271	48055	48055	Bernard	127	" Sarah Brown felt a slight misgiving . A warm and rather dramatic - looking light was shining behind the red curtain of the ferryman 's lattice window , as Sarah Brown crossed the moonlit road . She delighted , after her recent black hours , to think of all those people in the world who were sitting stuffily and pleasantly in little ugly rooms that they loved , doing quiet careful things that pleased them . And she told herself that the thought of Richard 's little office , alone and alight in the deserted City every night , would comfort her often in the darkness . The ferryman opened his door , and invited her genially to his telephone . He had been sitting at his table , surrounded by the snakes that for him took the place of a family . On the table was a bowl of milk from which a large bull - snake , in a gay Turkey - carpet design , was drinking . A yellow and black python lay coiled in several figures of eight in the armchair , and an intelligent - looking small dust - coloured snake with a broad nose and an active tongue leaned out of the ferryman 's breast pocket . "
48277	48328	48055	48055	Bernard	127	" he said , with shy and paternal pride , as Sarah Brown tried to find a place on which the python would like to be tickled or scratched . Somehow the python has a barren figure , from a caresser 's point of view . The ferryman went on : "
48388	48573	48599	48599	he	1275	" Sarah Brown rang up Richard 's office , and the over - refined voice of a young gentleman clerk answered her . Mr. Higgins was not in the office . Mr. Higgins had left particular word that if any one wanted him they were to be told that he had — er — gone to his True Love . But any minor business matter connected with magic could be attended to in his absence . Mr. Higgins spending so much of his time on the battlefield at present , a good deal of the routine work had to be done in any case by the speaker , his confidential clerk . Passports to America ? Perfectly simple . The office had simply to issue blank sheets treated in a certain way , and every official to whom the sheet should be presented would read upon it what he would want . But Mr. Higgins would have to affix his mark and seal . Mr. Higgins would be in the office sometime to - night , probably within the hour . How many passports ? "
48576	48581	48599	48599	he	1275	" said Sarah Brown . "
48629	48641	48643	48643	you	0	" As she hung up the receiver , the ferryman asked : "
48658	48659	48643	48643	you	0	" "
48663	48668	48643	48643	you	0	" replied Sarah Brown . "
48671	48672	48643	48643	you	0	" "
48695	48822	48823	48824	Great Scott	180	" Sarah Brown 's misgivings returned like a clap of thunder . She rushed back to the Shop . The lantern was standing in the middle of the floor , its glass was shattered , and out of each of its eight panels streamed a great flame six or seven feet high , like the petal of an enormous flower . Facing these flames stood Miss Ford and Mr. Tovey , hand in hand , each singing a different song very earnestly . Lady Arabel had found somewhere a patent fire extinguisher , and was putting on her glasses in order to read the directions . Mr. Frere was hesitating in the background with a leaking biscuit tin full of water . The Mayor was gone . "
48826	48859	48823	48824	Great Scott	180	" said Sarah Brown . You 'll burn the place down . Look at that row of petticoats up there , catching fire already . What have you done with the Mayor ? "
48860	48868	48870	48871	Mr. Tovey	127	" We made him invisible by mistake , "
48873	48886	48870	48871	Mr. Tovey	127	" But sh — sh , he does n't know it yet . "
48887	48891	48893	48894	Miss Ford	96	" Nothing matters , "
48896	48904	48893	48894	Miss Ford	96	" We are all going to America . "
48920	48934	48936	48937	Sarah Brown	115	" But that 's no reason why you should burn the house down , "
48939	48946	48936	48937	Sarah Brown	115	" That 's what I thought , "
48951	48961	48948	48949	Mr. Frere	129	" But water wo n't put out that flame . "
48980	48988	48971	48973	the invisible Mayor	1281	" If those lips could only speak , "
49005	49015	49017	49018	Sarah Brown	115	" You 've been putting magic into that flame , "
49021	49045	49017	49018	Sarah Brown	115	" I told you it was dangerous . Nothing will put magic out , except more magic . What will the witch say ? "
49046	49055	49057	49058	Miss Ford	96	" It does n't matter what anybody says , "
49060	49141	49057	49058	Miss Ford	96	" We are all going to America . No place and no person matters when I am not there . There are no places and no people existing where I am not . I have suspected it before , and now I am sure that everything is all a pretence , except me . Look how easy it was to dismiss that gross grocer from sight . He was just a bit of background . I have painted him out . "
49170	49178	49180	49181	Sarah Brown	115	" I will go and get help , "
49290	49295	49297	49298	Sarah Brown	115	" Come at once , "
49300	49319	49297	49298	Sarah Brown	115	" The House of Living Alone is on fire . Someone has been tampering with the magic drawer . "
49320	49326	49328	49328	Richard	164	" Oh deah , deah , "
49330	49359	49328	49328	Richard	164	" And this is such a busy night at the office too . Do you think it is really important ? It is my house , you know . "
49360	49412	49297	49298	Sarah Brown	115	" Well , I do n't see what is to prevent Mitten Island from being burnt to the water 's edge . In fact I do n't see why , being a magic fire , it should stop at the water 's edge . Not to mention that the Mayor — — "
49413	49421	49423	49423	Richard	164	" Very well , I 'll come , "
49435	49443	49444	49444	he	164	" I came by flash of lightning , "
49468	49523	49444	49444	he	164	" The lightning service is getting very bad . I was held up for quite three - quarters of a second over Whitehall . There was some wireless war - news coming in , and the lightning had to let it pass . Now , what 's all this fuss about , Sarah Brown ? "
49572	49581	49583	49583	Richard	164	" The faggots round the stake are lighted , "
49585	49592	49583	49583	Richard	164	" But the witch has fled . "
49629	49634	49636	49637	Sarah Brown	115	" Oh , Richard , "
49639	49648	49636	49637	Sarah Brown	115	" Your mother and Miss Ford and — — "
49649	49655	49657	49657	Richard	164	" Was mother in there ? "
49660	49684	49657	49657	Richard	164	" Wonders will never cease . Well , well , it is fortunate that no magic of any sort could ever touch mother . "
49710	49717	49718	49719	Mr. Tovey	127	" I did n't blow it , "
49727	49735	49718	49719	Mr. Tovey	127	" I was singing , not blowing . "
49736	49767	49769	49771	Mr. Darnby Frere	129	" Well , all I know is that while you were on that high note something seemed to scatter the flames , and the drawer full of explosives caught fire , "
49780	49786	49788	49789	Miss Ford	96	" It does n't matter , "
49792	49804	49788	49789	Miss Ford	96	" We are all going across the sea to - morrow . "
49820	49839	49805	49805	She	96	" You know , I inherit the sea tradition . My father commanded H.M.S. Indigestible in ' 84 . "
49840	49851	49853	49854	Mr. Tovey	127	" I wonder what put out the flame so suddenly ? "
49869	49875	49877	49877	Richard	164	" I put it out , "
49879	49887	49889	49890	Mr. Tovey	127	" I wonder whose house it is ? "
49898	49904	49906	49906	Richard	164	" It is my house , "
49914	49921	49923	49924	Lady Arabel	97	" Your house , dear Rrchud ? "
49926	49945	49923	49924	Lady Arabel	97	" Are you sure ? I did n't know the Higginses had any house property on Mitten Island . "
49946	49952	49954	49954	Richard	164	" They have n't now , "
49956	50037	49954	49954	Richard	164	" But never mind . It has always seemed to me that there were too many houses in the world . Most houses are traps into which everything enters , and out of which nothing comes . It always grieves me to see tradesmen pouring sustenance in at the back door , and no result or justification coming out of the front door . I often think that only the houses that men 's bodies have deserted are really inhabited . "
50038	50050	50052	50053	Miss Ford	96	" It was I who burnt your house down , Richard , "
50055	50069	50052	50053	Miss Ford	96	" But it does n't matter . It was n't a real house . "
50070	50075	50077	50077	Richard	164	" You are right , "
50079	50161	50162	50162	He	164	" To such as you , dear Meta , it was not a real house . It was the House of Living Alone , and only to people who live alone was it real . It is dark and deserted now , and levelled with the cold ground ; it is as though it were a tent , being moved from its position to follow the fortunes of those dwellers alone who wander continually in silence up and down the world .... "
50168	50173	50175	50176	Miss Ford	96	" Talking of wandering , "
50178	50194	50175	50176	Miss Ford	96	" We are all going to America , Richard . Can you get us passports ? "
50195	50198	50200	50200	Richard	164	" Certainly , "
50202	50234	50200	50200	Richard	164	" To America , eh ? A nice little trip for you all . America , you know , would be entirely magic , if it were n't for the Americans .... "
50235	50247	50249	50250	Miss Ford	96	" I have quite a circle of friends in New York , "
50263	50266	50268	50268	Richard	164	" Beware , "
50270	50289	50268	50268	Richard	164	" lest you all forget the magic of to - night , and change from adventurers to tourists . "
50290	50298	50300	50301	Lady Arabel	97	" I am not going to America , "
50303	50328	50300	50301	Lady Arabel	97	" I am going home . I never heard such dretful nonsense . I was only in fun when I agreed to the plan . "
50329	50339	50341	50342	Mr. Frere	129	" I never agreed to the plan at all , "
50344	50379	50341	50342	Mr. Frere	129	" I shall be truly thankful to get to bed , and wake up to - morrow sober . I will never go out to tea in Kensington again if this is the result . "
50380	50387	50389	50390	Mr. Tovey	127	" I am going to America , "
50405	50412	50414	50416	the unseen Mayor	1297	" I am going to America , "
50437	50467	50422	50422	Nobody	341	" I 'll give up this Mayor job to - morrer . Catch me stayin ' be'ind if — oh , by the way , that reminds me — — "
50468	50475	50477	50478	Sarah Brown	115	" I did n't need reminding , "
50480	50510	50477	50478	Sarah Brown	115	" It seems to me that everybody has forgotten why they came here . Please , Richard , do you know of a spell to find a missing person ? "
50511	50516	50518	50518	Richard	164	" Yes , several , "
50534	50627	50518	50518	Richard	164	" There is an awfully ingenious little spell I can show you , if you happen to have a telephone book and a compass and a toad 's heart and a hair from a black goat 's beard about you . Or again , if you stand on a sea - beach at low tide on Christmas night with the moon at your back and a wax candle in your left hand , and write upon the sand the name — by the way , who is it you want to find ? "
50628	50632	50634	50635	Sarah Brown	115	" The witch , "
50642	50649	50650	50650	he	164	" Oh , only the witch ? "
50653	50698	50650	50650	he	164	" I can tell you where she is without any spell at all . She 's with my True Love at Higgins Farm , helping — oh , by the way , mother , I forgot to tell you . You are a grandmother . "
50699	50702	50704	50705	Lady Arabel	97	" RRCHUD ! "
50724	50732	50733	50733	she	97	" Ah , it is too cruel , "
50743	50821	50733	50733	she	97	" It is too cruel . Is this my son ? I meant so well , and all my life I did the things that other people did , the natural things . Except just once . And for that once , I am so cruelly punished .... I am given a son who is no son to me , who says only things I must n't understand ... who does only things I must n't see .... "
50853	50858	50859	50859	she	97	" A faery son ... "
50873	50881	50859	50859	she	97	" Ah , it is too cruel .... "
50891	50909	50910	50910	he	164	" Yes , mother , and Peony , my True Love , insists on calling him Elbert , "
50913	50923	50910	50910	he	164	" Mother , listen , Elbert your faery grandson .... "
50930	50940	50942	50943	the witch	432	" Well , Sarah Brown , here we are , "
51056	51058	51032	51032	She	432	" magic "
51170	51175	51177	51178	the witch	432	" Here we are , "
51183	51234	51177	51178	the witch	432	" At least , I suppose this City on its Tiptoes is New York . Do you think I ought to call the attention of the Captain to that largish lady on our left , who seems to be marooned upon a rock , and signalling to us for help ? "
51235	51243	51245	51249	three neighbouring Americans in chorus	1318	" That is the Statue of Liberty , "
51251	51258	51260	51261	the witch	432	" How d'you mean — Liberty ? "
51272	51280	51281	51281	they	1320	" America is the home of Liberty , "
51286	51298	51300	51301	the witch	432	" Oh yes , of course , how stupid of me , "
51303	51565	51300	51301	the witch	432	" I ought to have remembered that every country is the Home of Liberty . Such a pity that Liberty never seems to begin at home . Every big shop in London , you know , is labelled Patronised by Royalty , yet I have bought haberdashery by the hour without running across a single queen . I suppose if you did n't have this big label sticking up in your harbour , you Americans might forget that America is the Home of Liberty . I know quite a lot about America from a grey squirrel who rents my may - tree on Mitten Island . It is a long time since he came over , but he still chitters with a strong New England accent . He came away because he was a socialist . I gather America is too full of Liberty to leave room for socialism , is n't that so ? My squirrel says there are only two parties in America , Republicans and Sinners — at least I think that was what he said — and anybody who belongs to neither of these parties is given penal servitude for life . So I understood , but I may be wrong . I am not very good at politics . Anyway , my squirrel had to leave the Home of Liberty and come to England , so as to be able to say what he thought . I wish I were there too . Sarah Brown , I do n't yet know why you brought me here . "
51566	51576	51578	51579	Sarah Brown	115	" I brought you here to escape the Law , "
51581	51642	51578	51579	Sarah Brown	115	" How d'you mean — escape the Law ? Did n't you know that all magic lives and thrives on the wrath of the Law ? Have you forgotten our heroic tradition of martyrdom and the stake ? Is n't the world tame enough already ? What do you want Magic to become ? A branch of the Civil Service ? "
51643	51654	51656	51657	Sarah Brown	115	" I spent all I had in bringing you here , "
51659	51700	51656	51657	Sarah Brown	115	" I left all I loved to bring you here . I am as if dead in England now . Nobody there will ever think of me again , except as a thing that has been heard the last of . "
51708	51712	51713	51713	she	432	" You know , "
51716	51951	51713	51713	she	432	" when you first told me to go away , after Harold made that bad landing on a policeman , I thought perhaps you were a sort of cinema villainess , driving me away from my house and heritage . At first I thought of arguing the matter , but then I remembered that villains always have a rotten time , without being bullied and persecuted by the rest of us . Besides solid things are never worth fighting over . So I have been patient with you all this time , and have fallen in courteously with all your fiendish plans — as I thought — and now I am glad I was patient , for I see you meant well . Dear Sarah Brown , you did mean well . How sad it is that people who have once lived in the House of Living Alone can never make a success of friendship . You say you left all you loved — what business have you with love ? Thank you , my dear , for meaning so well , and for these fair days at sea . But I must n't stay with you . I must n't set foot on this land — I can smell cleverness and un - magic even from here . I must go back to my little Spring island , and my parish of Faery .... "
51952	51978	52029	52030	the witch	432	" Ah , witch , do n't leave me , do n't leave me like this , ill and bewildered and so far from home .... "
51979	52021	52022	52023	Sarah Brown	115	" How can you ever be far from home , you , a dweller in the greatest home of all . Did you think you had destroyed the House of Living Alone ? Did you think you could escape from it ? "
52208	52215	52217	52218	Sarah Brown	115	" I can not hear you , "
52220	52226	52217	52218	Sarah Brown	115	" I am stone deaf . "
