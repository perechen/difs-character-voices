249	260	262	264	Mrs. Reginald Routh	30	" Is n't it a beautiful thing ? Such depth , "
408	412	413	413	she	30	" Is it ? "
425	468	469	469	she	30	" I suppose it is quite good , of course . Who is it by ? I suppose you ca n't say , though , without looking ; and I have n't really the least desire to know . Talking of music , "
482	620	469	469	she	30	" I have really had a treat this afternoon at St. James 's Hall . Of course you have often heard Sapolienski ? Do n't ask me how to pronounce him ; I think another of the horrors added to modern composers is the length of their names . But I 'm ashamed to say I have never heard him before ; I have been abroad , you see , and I am not a bit musical either . I enjoyed it much more than I expected though , and you should have seen the ovation he received at the end , ladies crowding on to the platform and throwing their rings at him ! Oh , no , I am clearly not musical . But still , as he is the greatest musician of the day .... "
633	721	722	722	she	30	" Oh , indeed ? I have never heard of a player of that name , but really there are so many third - rate ' eskis ' now that we can not be expected to know them all . I dislike all kinds of sentimental effusion , and society lions , especially when they are musical ones , are singularly unpleasing to me . There can be no flattery where true genius exists , and if we were to reserve our praise for real hidden talent , "
740	767	722	722	she	30	" real hidden talent , music would at last find her rightful place of honor among us . Do you not think so , Mr. Digby ? "
899	913	914	914	he	106	" Not yet , Mrs. Routh , no , no , not yet , "
918	1041	914	914	he	106	" we are not ready , not fit for it yet . Socialism has to come first ; the people must be taught the meaning of life and humanity before they can be made ready for music . Music is the end and aim of every intelligent Socialist . The people must suffer first , as we have all had to suffer , we who do understand and are waiting for the light which can not shine because of the materialists who do not even feel the need of it . Life is a problem , but we at least are happiest who see that it is so , and seek for the solution with our — with our heart 's blood . "
1192	1235	1172	1174	Mrs. Reginald Routh	30	" It is not Parliamentary reform , it is not any revolution , or series of revolutions , that will bring Socialism . It is we ourselves who must give it birth after much pain and sorrow , even as a mother — "
1269	1430	1439	1459	the gray - eyed girl , who had painted certain hot sunsets and purple mists during her travels on the Continent	149	impropriety—"even as a mother brings forth the child who is to become her joy and her comfort . It is the spirit of altruism that has to be diffused among us , and when we have once realized that the ' will to live ' as Schopenhauer puts it , is the one to be controlled , and that the finest of all things is to die,—that is , of course , to live,—to live for the good of the Commonwealth , then shall we be prepared for the enjoyment of perfect art , and then shall the musician,—that is , of course , the art of the musician,—be allowed to exist without such sordid considerations as bread and butter and a roof . I use art in its highest , its only real sense , as meaning music only ; such imitative branches as literature and painting will not then be practised . I — I beg your pardon ? "
1431	1437	1468	1468	she	149	" Please do n't stop , "
1477	1521	1468	1468	she	149	" I would not interrupt for the world . I do n't know anything about Socialism , or any of the other things you mention except painting , which is evidently doomed . So pray go on , I find it most entertaining . "
1667	1680	1681	1681	he	106	" Do you not see that the language of painting is limited ? "
1684	1754	1681	1681	he	106	" It has told us all it had to tell ; it is not adapted to modern needs and modern craving , though the impressionists have made a fine attempt , a noble attempt , to make it express more than it can . Do you not see that while music is purely spiritual , purely intellectual , painting is a mere imitation of the common objects of nature ? "
1755	1765	1767	1768	the girl	156	" Man and woman being among the common objects ? "
1784	1845	1681	1681	he	106	" Is not art finer , ten times finer than nature ? You can not see below the surface , you painters who copy nature , poor ignorant nature , who is only on the threshold of knowledge herself . You say you can paint a tree ; but when it is done , what is it ? A tree ! "
1846	1856	1858	1859	the other	157	" No , it is not only the tree , "
1861	1914	1858	1859	the other	157	" it is the picture in the artist 's mind that the tree makes . When you and I look at a tree we see two different things,—apparently ; and as I live in the country most of the year , I am thankful I am not a musician . Voilà tout ! "
1915	2000	1681	1681	he	106	" But even then ? You can put into your picture none of the workings of the human mind , none of the aspirations of the human soul . When you have a great happiness or a great sorrow , does it help you to paint your pictures ? No , no , your painting is apart from your existence , your mind has no place there . In the future we shall have but one art , and that art will be music ! "
2001	2007	2009	2010	the girl	156	" Oh , Mr. Raleigh ! "
2012	2051	2009	2010	the girl	156	" you are making a world for one kind of people . What will happen to the poor luckless ones like myself who are not musical ? I suppose there will have to be some in your world ? "
2052	2060	2062	2063	the musician	106	" Je n'en vois pas la nécessité , "
2157	2167	2169	2170	the chorus	120	" Oh , no , something of your own , "
2172	2197	2199	2200	the girl	156	" Yes , please , Mr. Raleigh , something full of the workings of the human mind and the aspirations of the human soul , "
2229	2236	2215	2215	she	30	" How exquisite , how emotional ! "
2248	2257	2259	2263	the other upholders of altruism	168	" Is he not bound to get on ? "
2286	2291	2292	2292	she	30	" Now tell me , "
2300	2382	2292	2292	she	30	" is it possible to compose anything that would express the aspirations of Mrs. Reginald Routh 's soul ? That is she , is it not , the one in the black silk who glares at me and is so maternal to you ? Oh , I shall never understand the language of music ; I wonder if you find the language of painting as difficult , and if that is why you have acquired such an unflattering opinion of it ? "
2383	2399	2400	2400	he	106	" May it not be because I have as yet seen none of your sketches ? "
2413	2497	2405	2405	she	30	" What stacks of photographs you have . Cleverly arranged too , I see : pupils in evening dress from twenty to twenty - five on the piano ; pupils with long hair and pinafores on the mantelshelf with the pipe - racks ; mammas in velvet and fur behind the fern - pots . Ah , the workings of the musical mind are most subtle . Good - bye ; I suppose I shall see you down at the Manor on Saturday ? "
2498	2535	2566	2567	Mrs. Reginald	30	" I hope to run down for the week end ; I have not seen my people for months . And perhaps I may have an opportunity of converting you yet ! Is your carriage here ? "
2536	2541	2543	2544	some one	171	" Who is she ? "
2556	2564	2570	2570	her	30	" Do n't ask me , dear , "
2574	2583	2566	2567	Mrs. Reginald	30	" I am quite unacquainted with the person . "
2584	2595	2597	2597	another	174	" Poor Mr. Raleigh , I quite felt for him , "
2599	2621	2597	2597	another	174	" but how chivalrous he is ! No one would have suspected how much her impertinence was torturing his sensitive nature . "
2622	2631	2633	2634	Mrs. Reginald	30	" I should not call her impertinent myself , "
2638	2713	2633	2634	Mrs. Reginald	30	" I think it is merely want of breeding . Provincial , I should say . Some friend of the family perhaps ; I have heard — that is to say , Mr. Digby has often talked to me of his home in the country . Strange that so many of our greatest men should have come up from the provinces . Take — take Händel , for instance , or even Charlotte Brontë . "
2714	2727	2729	2731	the first speaker	175	" What a pretty girl , Mr. Raleigh ; who is she ? "
2747	2809	2810	2810	he	175	" Ah , yes , charming , is n't she ? She is Lady Joan Relton , the Relton Court family , you know ; came into the title unexpectedly through the death of a great - uncle . Not much wealth , I believe ; no doubt , all the money has been squandered by her worthless and immoral ancestors , "
2829	2840	2810	2810	he	175	" Will you give us another song , Mrs. Routh ? "
3373	3394	3351	3353	The handy man	218	" pony , cart , garden , boots , knives , fifteen shillings a week , Sundays , and beer , "
3791	3797	3799	3800	the Squire	205	" to try his luck , "
4383	4387	4388	4388	Digby	32	" After all , "
4437	4469	4418	4418	he	32	" after all , it does not matter how bad a fellow is , if he is only artistically so , I mean if he will only be thorough over it . "
4470	4504	4506	4507	Lady Joan	38	" It does not matter how wicked we all are , so long as we can see the humor of sin . To be able to laugh at ourselves is the great thing , "
4509	4516	4518	4519	the musician	106	" There is nothing so depressing , "
4526	4579	4518	4519	the musician	106	" as the spectacle of a man who will not face his own wickedness — or even his own goodness . It is a sign of the age , this wretched spirit of compromise ; we do n't live in town because it is unhealthy , and the fogs are so bad — "
4580	4590	4591	4592	Lady Raleigh	45	" My dear , that was not the reason , "
4598	4742	4591	4592	Lady Raleigh	45	" — and we do n't live in the country because it is too far to come up to the concerts ; so we live at Crouch End or Putney , where an exasperating local railway lies between us and St. James 's Hall , and where the ends of the fogs hang about for days . We have n't the pluck to say yea or nay ; we leave all our decisions to the gods , who throw them back upon us again , or to — to fate , who only plays with us at will ; we would do anything to shirk the responsibility of the ego . Look at Helen , now ; the bent of her character is towards religion , yet she hesitates to go into a convent . Therefore her religion does not make her picturesque . "
4743	4770	4772	4772	Helen	43	" Digby ! How can you argue at breakfast time ? And I think you might keep your horrid atheistical notions to yourself before the children , "
4799	4864	4789	4789	Digby	32	" We are all the same , as a family . Take the father : he would lay down his life for the working - man , or he thinks so ; and yet he is afraid to go in for Socialism , which offers the only solution to the labor question . It is an age of compromise ; we are all cowards . "
4865	4880	4885	4885	Helen	43	" Digby is so fond of taking his own particular failings and generalizing them , "
4891	4917	4919	4920	Lady Joan	38	" People with decided opinions , picturesque people , as you call them , are people with fads ; and I hate people with fads , "
4922	5000	4919	4920	Lady Joan	38	" they are ten times more uninteresting than the weathercock sort of people who make compromises . Why should you always behave as if you went by clockwork ? It is far too much trouble when , after all , nothing matters . And why do you want to be quarrelling with the age perpetually ? It seems a nice comfortable sort of age to me ; I suppose it has a different aspect for musical people . "
5159	5199	5156	5157	Lady Joan	38	" Of all forms of self - indulgence , unintelligent self - sacrifice is the most degrading . Somebody says that the time of the clever people is taken up in undoing the harm done by the good people . "
5200	5206	5208	5208	Helen	43	" By the stupid people , "
5211	5218	5220	5220	Digby	32	" That is just the point , "
5236	5298	5220	5220	Digby	32	" What is to be done , Helen ? Have you heard , my dear ? Mrs. Bates says she can not let me have more than three pounds of butter a week . Did you ever know anything more provoking ? Oh , the difficulty of getting dairy produce in the country ! Why did we ever leave Cadogan Square ? "
5449	5459	5460	5460	he	205	" Why did we leave Cadogan Square , Lettice ? "
5469	5559	5460	5460	he	205	" I will tell you why , if you ca n't see for yourself by merely looking down the table . Because I am a poor man , Lettice ; because I have a large family that would swallow up any income ; because it is money , money , all day long , until I feel I ca n't give a shilling to a poor laboring man to — to improve his mind and — and his position , without feeling , without feeling extravagant , in short . "—The
5618	5700	5609	5609	him	39	" Do you ask me why , when I receive a letter like this from the son I have loved and educated and denied myself for ? I will tell you why , if you like , Lettice . Because I am not a millionnaire , Lettice ; because I have four sons doing nothing but spend money ; because Jack , confound the fellow , is in England at the present moment , and may be here to - day — "
5770	5780	5782	5783	Lady Raleigh	45	" He does not say he is in debt , "
5807	5810	5811	5811	he	40	" Say ? "
5819	5959	5811	5811	he	40	" do n't I know what he means , the rascal ? I tell you I 've done with him for once and for always ; he shall enter my house no more ; and if he comes here with his intolerable impudence , I shall show him the door . It is right that I should make an example of him , whatever it costs me to do it ; and though he is my own son I will harden my heart and do it . Not a penny more shall he get out of me ; I wash my hands of him and his debts ; it is my — my duty as a father to — to do it , in short , and you may tell him so when he comes , the young scapegrace ! "
6011	6032	6034	6036	the implacable Helen	43	" Jack ought to be ashamed of himself ; how can he expect papa to do any more for him ? "
6068	6076	6078	6079	her mother	283	" Helen , do n't be unjust , "
6099	6273	6078	6079	her mother	283	" the dear boy can not help being fond of his home , so sweet and affectionate of him . Dear Lady Joan , you must pay no heed to what Sir Marcus said just now ; he does not mean all he says , you know , and he was just a little startled by the suddenness of dear Jack 's decision ; it is my husband 's way of hiding his real emotion . I 'm sure I do n't know why he should make so much fuss over a trifle when we have so many real troubles to bear.—Now , my dear Digby , you know I do not allow smoking in the dining - room ; how can you be so unkind as to add wilfully to all my worries ? I shall have a headache for certain , now.—Tom , darling , open the window , and try to get the horrid smell out ; I feel distracted ! And has any one seen my key - basket ? "
6274	6284	6286	6286	Digby	32	" When will Jack be here , I wonder ? "
6351	6358	6360	6361	Lady Raleigh	45	" Oh , the dear boy , "
6370	6564	6360	6361	Lady Raleigh	45	" to think that he may come at any moment , and there is no ale in the house . Helen , you must write at once , and , dear me ! we must watch for every footstep all day ; and there are the sheets too,—where is Nurse ? Dear Lady Joan , you must forgive the emotions of a foolish old mother ; I assure you I am never flurried like this ; but even the best of housekeepers would be disturbed by such a sudden event . And he really must not have damp sheets ; he has slept in a blanket for two years , he tells me , and damp sheets are so dangerous ; but he shall have them to - night , bless him ! Oh , children ! look , look ! who is that coming along behind the hedge ? Move out of the way , Digby , and do n't make so much noise , everybody . Why ca n't I make myself heard in my own house ? Is it — can it — oh , tell me who it is ! "
6589	6597	6599	6600	Lady Raleigh	45	" George , George , come here , "
6602	6710	6599	6600	Lady Raleigh	45	" you must not leave this spot all day long , as Master Jack may be here at any minute . Do you understand ? So go into the field at once and get the pony in , and you had better have him harnessed , all ready to go to the station . And will you go now to the post - office and see if there is a telegram ? You might wait there on the chance , or at all events be in readiness . But do n't go beyond the grounds , whatever you do . Dear boy , how I love him ! "
6744	6760	6762	6764	the bewildered George	49	" Please , Mr. Digby , be I to stop here till Master Jack comes ? "
6777	6823	6766	6766	Digby	32	" If you take my advice , George , do your work as usual , and do n't bother about Master Jack . When he does come he wo n't dream of sending a telegram to say so . That is not Jack 's way . "
6824	6832	6834	6835	Lady Joan	48	" Will he walk from the station ? "
6907	6974	6983	6983	she	48	" Not he ! That is not Jack 's way either . He will drive up in a coach and four when we have given up expecting him , and want to know why we did not all go down to the station in a body to meet him . Then there will be a hubbub , and Jack will be king of the house again . "
6975	6982	6983	6983	she	48	" And you will be dethroned ? "
7001	7021	7022	7022	he	32	" Only until he begins to say why he has come , and the rain has spoiled the hay , "
7171	7182	7183	7183	he	40	" Interested in duck - breeding , did you say ? "
7187	7209	7183	7183	he	40	" then you shall see something you ca n't see in Pont Street or any of your swell West End places , "
7225	7473	7183	7183	he	40	" You shall come over one of our famous duckeries , and see what you 've been eating with green peas all the season , and learn how we breed ducks in Murville . It is n't every one who gets the opportunity of coming to the very centre of the most important village industry in the home counties , and it is quite time you saw how the laboring man is kept from starvation by a little help and a little encouragement . Why , let me tell you , though I am a modest man , God knows , and it is not I who should say it , that if it had not been for my letters to the papers , the duck interest would have completely died out in Murville long ago . And where would the working - man have been then ? Do you know , my dear young lady , that I , that is , Murville , or rather , I should say , my letter to the county paper has been quoted in the ' Daily Liberal ' ? There 's fame for you ! You did n't know you had come to such a world - renowned place , eh ? Ah , we are not so hidden in Murville , after all ; that is , the — the cause of the elevation of the laborer has its opportunities even in a small village like this . "
7474	7487	7489	7490	Lady Joan	48	" Even a duck has its portion in the scheme of Providence , "
7497	7547	7489	7490	Lady Joan	48	" I wish I could find out all these wonderful things for myself , they are so improving . For instance , I shall never mind paying a guinea a couple in February , now that I know I shall be doing a great national good by buying them . "
7548	7559	7561	7561	Digby	32	" You have got hold of quite the wrong idea , "
7563	7597	7561	7561	Digby	32	" a most anti - socialistic idea , of which I could not believe even you to be capable . As if the luxury of the rich could be of the least avail — "
7619	7632	7561	7561	Digby	32	" play lightly , as they had heard that old wheeze before , "
7655	7780	7782	7783	Sir Marcus	40	" Eh , what ? Socialism , did you say ? Of course it is Socialism in its noblest form , when — when we get a notice in the ' Daily Liberal , ' and without paying for it too ! It was none of your cooked - up jobs , carried through with bribery and corruption , let me tell you , it was all fair and above board ; Editor 's a personal friend of mine , do n't you see , and he would n't have quoted from my letter if he had n't thoroughly appreciated it . You ca n't get over facts with any amount of Socialism ; give me facts , that 's what I always say , "
7809	7815	7817	7818	Lady Raleigh	45	" I can hear wheels , "
7892	7901	7902	7902	she	45	" I can feel it is my boy , "
7912	7927	7902	7902	she	45	" come to him , Marcus , come to our long - lost child . "
7928	7937	7939	7940	Sir Marcus	40	" Do n't make a fool of yourself , "
7969	8001	7944	7944	he	40	" he 's only been away two years , and there 's no more chance of his being lost than there is of your going on a five - mile walk . "
8047	8064	8066	8067	Lady Raleigh	45	" Leave him to me , children ; let me have my boy 's first kiss , "
8073	8077	8079	8081	the practical Helen	43	" Just look , "
8087	8107	8079	8081	the practical Helen	43	" he has hired Bunce 's best trap , and we have n't paid his bill for two quarters . "
8193	8203	8205	8205	Digby	32	" Had n't you better come out , sir ? "
8207	8218	8220	8221	Sir Marcus	40	" No , sir , I will not come out , "
8229	8278	8220	8221	Sir Marcus	40	" Have I not already told you that I have done with the rascal forever ? I meant what I said , sir , and I will not see him nor speak to him ; he — he can go to some one else to pay his debts ! "
8416	8504	8405	8405	he	32	" Do n't you see the trouble and the misery that is coming upon me through the extravagance of this young scamp ? How is it you are so short - sighted , so dense about it ? I tell you he is ruining me , this Jack you are all so fond of ; and in ruining me he is taking the bread out of your own mouths , and out of the mouths of your brothers and sisters . Hey ? Do you see now ? "
8546	8551	8553	8553	Digby	32	" It is curious , "
8560	8653	8553	8553	Digby	32	" how the father can forgive anything but want of solid success . He does n't care a hang that Jack has been the most popular fellow in the colony , but if he had made his pile and had something to show for his popularity , then he would proclaim it on the housetops . What a curious age it is , and how we love to judge by results ! By the way , Jack will have a warm time if the father keeps it up , wo n't he ? "
8665	8676	8680	8680	Helen	43	" Good thing too , it 's what he wants , "
8699	8703	8705	8705	they	331	" Chinese architecture , "
8786	8793	8794	8794	he	40	" Capital speech , capital speech , "
8807	8841	8794	8794	he	40	" what I have always said myself in fact , but I never could get anybody to listen to me . Why — why the devil are they making such a row in the garden?"—as
8851	9063	8794	8794	he	40	figures—"coming into the hall , are they ? Let them come into the hall by all means , I ca n't stop them , it 's no longer my own house , I suppose ; but they sha'n't come in here anyhow ; I hope I have a remnant of authority left — and — eh , what ? is that the beggar laughing ? bless him!—that is , confound his impudence ! what right has he to laugh when I do n't mean to forgive him ? I — I've been a weak fool all my life , but I 'm not going to give in this time ; it — it 's a duty I owe to the younger ones to make an example of him , whatever it costs me to do it ; not that it costs me anything , of course , not anything at all , of course ; he — he has forfeited my love , the — the rascal , and I wo n't give in this time . Why — why the devil do n't they stop his laughing when I mean to cast him off ? Pack of women and children , with no sense of the responsibilities of life ! — "
9088	9280	9083	9084	the Squire	205	himself—"It 's my duty as a father to withhold my forgiveness ; what else is a poor man to do when he has such an enormous family ? A mountain of debts at his back , I 'll be bound , and he thinks he is going to get round me to pay them all — as if I would n't help him if I could , bless his — hang his improvidence ! but when there are eleven of them — such absurdity on the part of Lettice , always told her it was an unnecessary thing to have such a tribe of them ; but there ! no one ever has listened to me , and now they must bear the consequences among them . Wh — what ? who 's that at the door ? There 's no one in here , I tell you , the — the room 's empty , and I do n't mean to see you — I'm not going to be made a fool of when I 've kept it up all day — why does n't he go away , eh ? "

9338	9416	9083	9084	the Squire	205	" I tell you this is my room ; it is n't much that belongs to me , except five sons doing nothing , and six unmarried daughters , but — but this room is my property , and I wo n't have any one in , I tell you — what a fool I was not to lock the door — eh , what ? who 's that , eh ?

10678	10818	10665	10665	he	32	" Some fellows ought never to marry ; I told Dick Stephens so when he got engaged , and he was separated from his wife within a year of their marriage . But I am not like Dick Stephens . I am really a most domesticated sort of man , and it is time I settled down . I am tired of being a Bohemian ; every wretched little pygmy who writes ballads and lets his hair grow and does n't wash , is a Bohemian . And there is the boy , too ; he ought to have a mother of course , poor little chap : we both want a woman about us , do n't we , Sonny ? Yes , there is no doubt that it is my duty to Sonny to marry very soon . "
10870	10954	10956	10956	she	38	" I like him . He is fresh , and original , and amusing . He does n't bore me , and I can flirt with him — safely . He has no theories about things , and he does not want to upset creation , and he does n't take life so desperately seriously . It is such a blessing to meet some one who is content with the age as it is — bah ! what a smell of tobacco smoke ! "

10993	11074	10986	10987	the musician	106	" how Fate seems to have propelled her towards me at every crisis of my life ; just after Mary died , for instance , and again before I met Norah!—poor little Norah ! and then again the other day , when I really had made up my mind to go to Africa , and she came back from the Continent in time to prevent me . And now — ah , I believe I could write that song now . "

11927	12040	11919	11920	her mother	283	" Lady Relton 's Dick ? Eh , but he come along nigh after sunset , he did , and he says to my man , he says , ' Seen Muster Brill ? ' he says . And my man told him , he did , as ye worn't long gone home , not to call it short neither , nor yet very long ; leastways ye were gone along home , he said , did n't ye , Pete ? Speak up , man , and say what ye know , and doan't sit starin ' as though heavin and earth worn't big enough for your eyes to look into . "

12089	12212	12084	12084	Roger	62	" Lady Relton 's Dick said the rats in the stable worn't worth their keep . Lady Relton told him she 'd pay the corn for the horses , but the rats would have to go elsewhere if they wanted good grain , as she did n't intend for 'em to have hers . I said I 'd go to - morrow , being promised to Farmer Wadsden 's ricks to - day ; but Dick , he says the world has to stop a turnin ' round for my lady , he says , and she were in a taking along of them rats , so to - day I took the pup along and I went up to the Court . "

12269	12343	12261	12261	she	422	" Lady Relton 's Dick fetched a gentleman from the station this mornin ' , and he took him back again an hour past . I knows he did , seeing as I was washing the precious baby 's face , or was I hanging out Mrs. Walker 's wash ? when the dog - cart come by . Was it the gentleman as ye saw up at the Court , Muster Brill ? "
12390	12452	12382	12382	his	62	" If ye want to have the talkin ' to yourself , missus , I be going to clear out . Cause why ? It bain't reasonable to tell a body somethin' fresh when the body have heard it afore , and I ai n't the man to spoil t ' other body 's tale , so good arternoon to ye . "
12459	12489	12455	12455	Peter	65	" Sit ye down , lad , and doan't heed her clapperin ' tongue . I doan't , and it 's clipper - clappered at me this twenty year . "

12550	12664	12665	12665	He	426	" I never could have thought so well of my lady as that she 'd leave 'em to get to that pitch before calling me in . Why , Peter , man , if she 'd called me in only a month ago she 'd have spoilt the sport summat ! but here they was , eaten to bustin ' with corn , and no thought of the morrow , as the Holy Scripture says . Eh , but that was a mornin ' , that was ; well , I reckon I 'd laid out some dozen or more in the stable yard , when up comes Lady Relton and Mr. Jack . "
12688	12693	12665	12665	He	426	" That 's him , "
12698	12732	12665	12665	He	426	" I doan't know no more than the dead what business it was of his to come hangin ' round my lady , what 's all unprotected and alone like , bless her ! "

12744	12748	12750	12750	Roger	62	" More partickler , "
12769	12829	12756	12756	his	62	" more partickler as Mr. Jack be Mr. Raleigh 's own brother , and my lady belongs to Mr. Raleigh if ever she belonged to anybody ; and no one ca n't deny as it 's been my intention to put 'em together this four year come harvest time . No one ca n't deny it , no one . "
12830	12837	12839	12839	Peter	65	" True , lad , true , "
12866	12875	12877	12878	Mrs. Haxtell	64	" And to think of his precious baby , "
12888	12982	12881	12881	herself	64	" to think of the dear lamb , with no mother and not much father to speak of , passing of his innocent childhood without the woman 's care his father ought to give him . I 've no patience with such neglect , though I 'm sure I hope I 've done my best by the child , as I thought to myself only this mornin ' when I saw him stuffin ' his precious fat cheeks with green plums . It ai n't every one would let a child do that ! "
12991	13000	13001	13001	she	66	" Tell about Mr. Jack , Muster Brill , "
13005	13008	13010	13011	old Peter	65	" Daughter , "
13015	13059	13010	13011	old Peter	65	" it ai n't the part of a well - meanin ' , God - fearin ' lass to ask such a question , and if you worn't your mother 's own daughter you would n't have such sinful desires to ask 'em . "
13089	13236	13085	13085	Roger	62	" Well , up they comes together , talkin ' and laughin ' quite friendly like , and my lady says to him , she says , ' Here 's the rats you said I was to have killed , ' she says , ' and is n't it a dear little dog ? ' she says . So I says to her , ' Aye , it be a good pup ; it 's killed fourteen since breakfast , ' and I seemed to offend her like , for up she gets from where she 'd been patting him , and she looks at Mr. Jack all in a blaze , and she says all angry like , ' That 's what you call sport , is it ? ' she says . ' Mr. Digby would n't call it sport , ' she says . "
13237	13244	13246	13248	both the women	433	" No more he would n't , "
13251	13257	13259	13259	Roger	62	" That 's true enough , "
13263	13402	13259	13259	Roger	62	" but Lady Relton , she bain't the smirking soft kind o ' woman what likes to spare the rat and spoil the corn , and I ca n't rightly make out what 's come over her to - day . She did n't seem herself to - day , not anyhow , and she seemed to take a pleasure in quarrelin ' over everything Mr. Jack said , and then she laughed of him , she did . It worn't like my lady , it worn't , to talk soft stuff about killin ' rats ; that be more like t ' other one what come after Mr. Raleigh last springtime , the one what had saucer eyes , and pretended to be fond of the child , with her nasty clingin ' , pretendin ' ways . "
13431	13434	13439	13439	he	65	" other one "
13447	13518	13439	13439	he	65	" Eh , lad , but you be proper hard upon poor Miss Norah , proper hard you be , for sure . I would n't be saying as ye have n't your reasons for it , but she seemed a quiet sort of maiden enough , what did n't mean no harm to speak of , and what 's suffered enough for her foolishness , I 'll be bound . "
13519	13530	13532	13532	Roger	62	" I hope she has , I hope she has , "
13536	13658	13532	13532	Roger	62	" Those as comes with their sneaking ways tryin ' for to corrupt honest folk deserves to suffer for it . No one doan't know why she did n't come back when Mr. Raleigh sent that letter after her , and no one doan't know why she did n't even answer it ; but you take my word for it , it was Providence as interposed and would n't have nothink to do with her , and it 's Providence as opens the way now to Mr. Raleigh if he 'd only see it , and not want Providence to come down from heaven and poke him into it , so to speak . Who be that coming across the street ? "
13659	13673	13675	13676	Lily Eliza	66	" Why , that be Mr. Raleigh his own self , that be , "
13808	13820	13821	13821	he	65	" Well , Mrs. Haxtell , and how 's the boy ? "
13834	13877	13821	13821	he	65	" I 've brought you a new kind of baccy to try , sir ; hope the youngster has been behaving himself , eh ? Ah , Roger , how does the world go with you ? And where 's my Sonny ? "
13878	13912	13914	13915	the landlady	422	" There , now , to think of his father coming so unfortunate like , and he that 's never out at tea - time more than twice in a twelve - month , "
13934	14095	13914	13915	the landlady	422	" that do seem hard , that do ; but there , Lady Relton she come down and asked so coaxing like for him to go that I could n't find it in my heart to refuse her ; but that be the first time I 've let him out o ' my sight this many weeks . And I 'm sure I 've been so doleful like all the time he 's been gone that I wo n't never let him go again , that I wo n't ; I kept on thinkin ' somethin' was going to happen to the precious , and I would n't never see him again , and what would his father say then , when I 'd promised to look after him like my own — there , Mr. Raleigh , I feel as if somethin' terrible might come to Master Sonny afore we set eyes on him again , that I do ! "
14096	14108	14110	14110	Digby	32	" I hope not , Mrs. Haxtell , I hope not , "
14137	14242	14124	14124	he	32	" It would take a good deal to hurt Master Sonny , I fancy , and he will be in here directly turning everything upside down again to your heart 's content . Are you off , Mr. Roger ? Then I 'll walk home with you , and have a pipe to get rid of the London smoke . Ah ! London is not fit for a dog this weather ! And will you send the boy down to the castle meadow when he comes in , Mrs. Haxtell ? Thanks ; let him come alone , and learn to be a man . "
14262	14266	14248	14249	Lady Joan	38	" Relton Arms , "
14275	14342	14248	14249	Lady Joan	38	" Here we are , Mrs. Haxtell ; did you think I was going to keep him altogether ? I nearly did , he was so fascinating , and we had such a delightful flirtation together . He is the most charming little gentleman to flirt with , because he is never stupid enough to take it in for a moment . Look at him now , "
14356	14419	14344	14345	the boy	241	" Oh , you ungrateful little beggar , after all the cake and the jam I have been giving you ! Here , give me a kiss , Sonny , and I 'll be off . What is it , Mrs. Haxtell ? His father , did you say ? Oh — yes — to be sure , his father — yes ! "
14462	14525	14442	14442	she	422	" Aye , my lady , and the child was to go down to the castle meadow all along of himself to find his father , to learn to be a man , was what he said . I bain't one to make a fuss over trifles , but I do n't like to let the child go quite , and yet — "
14526	14539	14541	14542	Lady Joan	38	" What nonsense ! of course not ; how like a man , "
14546	14622	14541	14542	Lady Joan	38	" besides , the child is much too tired to walk all that way . Now for my two kisses , Sonny ; I will make it three if you do n't give me them at once , sir ! I will go and make it right with his father , Mrs. Haxtell , if you will tell Dick to take the ponies quietly home , please . And may I go across the orchard ? "
14623	14640	14648	14648	she	64	" Eh , but she doan't care what the towns - folk say , do she ? "
14658	14666	14671	14671	herself	38	" I wonder what made me come , "
14762	14767	14768	14769	the musician	106	" Then marry me , "
14796	14810	14812	14813	Lady Joan	38	" But I have already told you that I do not love you , "
14821	14850	14818	14818	herself	38	" What does that matter ? It will come in time , it is sure to come . Besides , I love you ; is not that enough ? "
14878	14893	14894	14894	he	452	" You think you are going to put me off by pretending to laugh , "
14910	14946	14894	14894	he	452	" but the truth is that you dare not be serious , Lady Joan ; why do n't you give in to your real feelings and stop making a joke of life just this once ? "
14947	14955	14956	14956	she	38	" I make a joke of life ? "
14966	15042	14959	14959	she	38	" how is that possible unless one has realized its sadness ? You enthusiasts who have never laughed at anything , and are always talking about taking life seriously , you have never gone deep enough to see that it is serious . If you had , you would only laugh for the rest of your life , because — it would be impossible after you had once realized that to keep serious and live . "
15058	15085	15086	15086	he	106	" Do n't you see that I love you as I have never loved any one before , as I could never love any one again ? "
15090	15098	15099	15099	she	38	" How am I to believe that ? "
15108	15165	15099	15099	she	38	" Is that quite fair of you ? Have I not been always perfectly open with you ? I told you the story of my marriage the first time I ever met you , and I have told you to - day about poor little No — about Miss Bisley . Could any man do more ? "
15166	15169	15170	15170	she	38	" No , "
15174	15228	15170	15170	she	38	" but you might very well have done less,—I mean , the whole town told me about Miss Bisley directly I came home from abroad , though , except for the name , the two accounts do not tally in the least . But then , nothing in Relton shrinks in the washing . "
15238	15283	15229	15230	The musician	106	" Then I suppose you merely think I am a brute who is taking advantage of your loneliness to profess an affection for you which he does not feel ? A man has to pay a big penalty for your friendship , Lady Joan . "
15316	15331	15332	15332	she	38	" It is not that ; I am afraid of myself , I think , "
15351	15354	15355	15355	he	106	" Then — "
15371	15530	15360	15360	she	38	" No , no , you mistake me ; I do not believe that it is in me to love anybody — for long . My friends say it is because I have never known a mother 's love ; but if my parents had lived they would simply have made me fight with them through their tiresome affection for me . Now , I know what you are going to say — that I am speaking with the spirit of the age , or some of that twaddle I have heard before . If I am , it is you who have taught it me , for I do n't allow anybody else to mention the age to me ; I am sick of it and the people who make their living out of abusing it . I could never love you , or anybody . That 's the truth , and — don't you believe me ? "
15531	15535	15536	15536	he	460	" Not quite , "
15549	15552	15553	15553	she	461	" Besides , "
15566	15585	15553	15553	she	461	" there is this Norah Bisley : how am I to know that she will not come back ? "
15601	15618	15592	15592	she	461	" I do n't think it is possible . You see , I wrote three times — "
15619	15627	15588	15588	his	460	" The letters may have gone astray . "
15628	15763	15588	15588	his	460	" The third one I sent by hand , and it was returned to me unopened . I can see now that it is only what I might have expected ; she did not have a thought apart from her father , and her father never liked me well enough to look on me in the light of a son - in - law . He took her away directly he suspected our liking for one another , and when they got together and away from me he must have persuaded her to give me up . I wrote to him and I wrote to her , but , as you know , with no avail . She was a lovable little thing , spoiled by her weakness of will , poor little Norah ! "
15764	15769	15770	15770	she	462	" Poor little Norah ! "
16067	16079	16080	16080	she	462	" I am not livable with , that is the truth , "
16206	16210	16211	16211	he	41	" Lady Joan , "
16215	16226	16211	16211	he	41	" is it me that you dislike , or marriage ? "
16227	16230	16231	16231	she	475	" Both , "
16266	16474	16475	16475	He	477	" do n't you see , my dear friend , that if we were to marry I should plague your life out , and you would never write another note of music , and Mrs. Reginald Routh and all the others would point at me with invective ? And you would bore me to the verge of extinction in a month ! Of course if you did n't like me it might work better , because then I should have to make you fall in love with me , and that would prevent it from being such a deadly dull affair . Or if I hated you I might do it , because then we could live our separate lives , and there would be nothing to spoil . Do n't you see how marriage always spoils things ? It is never romantic ; it is expedient , that 's all . It does for people who are not fond of one another , or for people who do not feel such things ; but for two people who are in love , and one of them a hypersensitive musician — bah ! it would be madness ! Not that I am in love , of course . "
16526	16534	16535	16535	he	477	" Then you believe in perpetual engagements ? "
16545	16552	16553	16553	she	478	" Not a bit of it , "
16571	16607	16553	16553	she	478	" engagements simply mean all the conventional drawbacks without the moral conveniences . No , there is only one way out of it , and that wo n't work when you come to examine it . "
16608	16614	16615	16615	he	477	" And what is that ? "
16624	16643	16644	16644	she	478	" To marry some one who does n't matter , and be in love with some one else , "
16683	16695	16696	16696	he	477	" No , it would hardly work , I am afraid , "
16700	16735	16696	16696	he	477	" Lady Joan , it is an absurdly old - fashioned thing to say , but do you know I fancy , after all , that marriage is the only way out of it ? "
16749	16762	16763	16763	she	478	" I think you are merely abusing your privilege as my friend , "
16766	16836	16763	16763	she	478	" I am not going to stay here for you to draw me out and then — then laugh at me . It is time we closed this — this absurd interview , and I wish — I wish I had known you were here before I started for my walk . Do you suppose that I would say anything to you that the whole world might not hear ? "
16922	16932	16933	16933	he	106	" My engagements never do seem to go right , "
16976	17061	17079	17080	the boy	241	" Here I are , daddy ! Where is you , daddy ? I 've been a naughty boy , welly naughty Nanny says , 'cos I did n't say grace at tea - time . Why do n't you never say grace , my daddy ? When I are a big man I are n't never going to say grace no more ! Nanny says I are to kiss you free times , and did you bring any sweets for me , daddy ? "
17062	17072	17074	17074	Digby	32	" That will do , my son , yes , "
17094	17141	17079	17080	the boy	241	" Nanny is always right , of course , but I think twice will be enough . Thanks . The sweets are in this pocket , so you need not turn out all the others . And you must not have any unless you stop jumping . "
17231	17240	17241	17241	he	57	" And now for my story , daddy , "
17253	17271	17241	17241	he	57	" Be quick please , my daddy ; once upon a time — go on , daddy ! "
17272	17278	17280	17281	the musician	106	" Once upon a time , "
17318	17345	17280	17281	the musician	106	" Yes , daddy , yes ; go on , please , my daddy : are you forgotten the end of my story , daddy dear ? "
17354	17385	17386	17386	he	106	" Oh , dear , once upon a time there was — there was — oh , confound it all , there was a beautiful lady , was n't there ? "
17390	17400	17386	17386	he	106	" A booful lady ? Welly booful , daddy ? "
17401	17408	17443	17444	the musician	106	" Very beautiful , my son . "
17409	17412	17386	17386	he	106	" Oh , "
17415	17425	17386	17386	he	106	" and what sort of daddy did she have ? "
17426	17441	17443	17444	the musician	106	" Eh , what ? Daddy ? Oh — she did n't have one , "
17479	17482	17484	17485	the baby	500	" Oh , "
17493	17504	17484	17485	the baby	500	" did n't she never have no daddy at all ? "
17535	17540	17542	17542	Sonny	57	" Daddy , dear , "
17550	17559	17561	17562	the musician	106	" Oh , the devil take the story ! "
17564	17585	17561	17562	the musician	106	" did n't I tell you she never had a daddy ? Do n't ask so many questions , Sonny . "
17616	17627	17629	17630	the child	1323	" I are n't crying , only little girls cry , "
17637	17657	17629	17630	the child	1323	" I was only just thinking , daddy , what a welly funny booful lady she were , daddy . "
17658	17664	17666	17667	the musician	106	" Yes , my son , "
17695	17751	17752	17753	The musician	106	" yes , my son , she was a very funny beautiful lady , so funny that daddy could not understand her at all , although he loved her so much . And she laughed at daddy , and would n't be kind to him , though she was kind to the whole world besides . "
17785	17815	17764	17764	Sonny	57	" Oh , so she were a naughty booful lady , daddy ? Then she wo n't have jam for tea next Sunday , will she , daddy dear ? "
17842	18018	18020	18021	Lady Joan	38	" Yes , Sonny , of course , she was a naughty beautiful lady , that 's just what she was ! But do you know I 've come back to say that I wo n't be naughty any more just yet , at least if daddy lets me , and I 'm going to be kind to him — at least , if daddy wants me . Daddy , do say something . May I be good for a change , and will you let me be kind to you ? I 've come to say I am sorry , like a good little girl ; and — I may have jam for tea next Sunday , may n't I ? Oh , daddy , do say something , and do n't look so doleful ! Do n't you understand ? I was wrong , and you were right , and — oh , how stupid it all is ! Why — daddy — I — I do n't believe you want me now ! "
18105	18190	18058	18059	the musician	106	" We both want our beautiful lady , do n't we , Sonny ? And may I make my confession too , Lady Joan ? I was not sure that I did want you so desperately after you sent me away just now . But I found that I did directly you opened the door and the sunshine came in , and I can never do without you again . But it is better to understand one another at starting , is n't it ? "
18191	18408	18413	18413	her	515	" Much better . And ideals are such bosh when we have grown out of our short frocks . So the understanding is quite complete ; you do n't know how much you love me , so we will call it desperately , and I do n't know how much I love you , so we will call it desperately too . You have been in love shoals of times before , and I — well , I am capable of falling in love with some one else on my wedding - day . So neither of us will be disappointed if it does not answer , but we have agreed to try . Hey - day , what fun it is ! The lonely lady at the Court marrying the musician at the inn ; the lady has the establishment , and the musician has the money to keep it up : if you were truly modern you would have both , and be a risen cabinet - maker . Relton will have enough to talk about for a year . But you will not behave as if we were engaged , just yet , will you ? I — I do n't feel as if I could quite stand it ; do you understand ? "
18463	18506	18508	18508	she	515	" What wickedness to keep this child up so late ; come along , Sonny lad , I told Nanny that I would put you to bed for a treat , and daddy is going to stay here and smoke his pipe . "
18737	19056	19057	19057	He	527	" Digby , I 've come at last . You said you would not mind waiting ten years for me , and it has only been one ; yet , oh ! such a weary long one to me , Digby ! But it has not been my fault , it has n't really , dear ; they never told me , and papa stopped your two first letters , and Roger Brill — it was Roger , was n't it?—never brought me the last one at all . It was all a mistake , I ca n't tell you now , but I found it out and gave them the slip , and came straight here . Oh , Digby , you are not angry with me , are you ? I never meant to keep you waiting so , but I did not find it all out till yesterday , so I could not come before . Oh , it has been so sad , waiting for you . And I have been so ill too , Digby ; they did not know what was the matter with me , but I knew all the time . It is all over now , though , and we are going to be happy at last , are n't we ? And may I have my kiss now , the one you promised me ? I think if you had kissed me before I went away I should never have been ill . But I am going to be happy now , so happy . Oh , Digby , I feel so greedy over my happiness that I am frightened of its slipping away again . Is it because I have startled you that you are so silent ? Tell me you are not angry with me , Digby,—and — when may I have my kiss , please ? "
19170	19194	19163	19164	Lady Joan	38	" No , Norah child , of course I am not angry with you ; how could any one be that ? But — "
19195	19233	19128	19129	Lady Joan	38	" I do n't mind anything if you are not angry with me . Only , why are you so quiet ? Have you been suffering too , Digby ; have n't they been kind to you ? "
19234	19259	19323	19323	her	536	" Who ? the fates ? No , I fancy they have not been kind to me . Did you come alone , childie ? "
19260	19283	19323	19323	her	536	" I came with old nurse ; she is at the station . Digby , tell me , have you been ill ? "
19284	19320	19321	19321	She	536	" No , I have not been ill ; I have been working rather hard , and perhaps worrying as well . Forgive me , dear ; you must own it is all rather startling ? "
19359	19427	19345	19346	Lady Joan	38	" Of course it is ; I feel as if I had begun to live all over again after being asleep in a cold , dark place ever since last year . Have you ever felt like that , Digby ? Oh , I have never asked after Sonny ; how is he ? Has he gone to bed ? May I go up and kiss him ? "
19428	19434	19435	19435	he	537	" No , stay here , "
19462	19503	19455	19455	he	537	" he is quite bonny , but we — we wo n't disturb him yet . There is a lady with him who — who has been kind to me , and — and she will be coming down perhaps — "
19504	19513	19455	19455	he	537	" A lady ? Oh , I see , "
19516	19534	19455	19455	he	537	" I am glad she has been kind to you — very . Do you like her ? "
19548	19555	19556	19556	he	537	" Yes , I like her , "
19573	19598	19556	19556	he	537	" I should like to see her , then . Hark , she is coming downstairs ; how merry she is , your friend ! "
19673	19676	19677	19677	he	537	" Norah , "
19694	19774	19677	19677	he	537	" I have something to say to you . Will you be brave and hear me ? It may all come right , of course , but — this lady was kind to my boy — and to me , when no one else would hold out a hand to us ; and I thought you had forgotten me , and so — I asked her to marry me . It was only this afternoon , and of course — "
19807	19827	19791	19792	Lady Joan	38	" Oh , daddy , what do you think Sonny said ? Why — who — what is it ? "
19885	19895	19897	19898	the musician	106	" My engagements never do seem to go right , "
19955	19965	19967	19968	the musician	106	" There is a curse upon my love affairs , "
19970	20097	19967	19968	the musician	106	" Why should those letters never reach her ? And why did she choose that moment of all others to come back ? Another man might do a dirty trick and not be found out . God knows I never wanted to harm a woman in my life , least of all those two ; and yet I 've blundered in and got engaged to both of them at once ; and I 've broken the heart of the purest and most innocent child — merciful heavens , what have n't I done ? And here I am , left up here like a great fool , while they are tearing my character to ribbons downstairs . Was there ever such an unfortunate brute as myself ? "
20142	20150	20152	20153	the musician	106	" Women are such deuced odd things , "
20157	20213	20152	20153	the musician	106	" they expect you to look on while they scratch one another 's eyes out , and then if you touch a hair of their heads you have the whole lot of them against you . Bless her ! I would give my life to undo what I have done to her to - day . "
20259	20263	20265	20266	the musician	106	" Happy Sonny , "
20270	20344	20265	20266	the musician	106	" your turn has yet to come . Why ca n't children always remain children ? Norah ought never to have grown up ; she was meant for eternal childhood . It was a mistake to make Lady Joan a child at all , she ought to have been born a full - grown woman . I ought never to have been born at all , of course . Who arranges these things ? "
20429	20435	20437	20438	Lady Joan	38	" Men are always brutes , "
20440	20532	20437	20438	Lady Joan	38	" but this one has only become so by accident . Stupid people do more harm than bad ones , ever so much . The fates will help you out of a hole if you have been a clever sinner , but they will lay a pitfall for you if you are a blundering , good - intentioned sort of creature . The fact is , this world of ours was made for clever people , and the fools have n't a chance . That is why he has gone wrong . "
20533	20540	20542	20547	the weary voice on the sofa	556	" Is he a fool then ? "
20564	20700	20542	20547	the weary voice on the sofa	556	" He lives by his emotions , and he has no sense of proportion . It comes to the same thing . He had no intention of being faithless to you , and if you had not gone away he would have married you , and remained dull and virtuous to the end of his days . But you did go away , and I came home ; and he ca n't live without a woman , and so he persuaded himself that his friendship for me was love . That was how it was done . Perhaps I encouraged him too . He was interesting to me , and he was never in love with me , so I amused myself by trying to fascinate him . I ca n't help being a woman . "
20701	20708	20710	20711	the other	157	" Are women like that too ? "
20719	20728	20714	20714	she	157	" I am a woman too , but — "
20735	20750	20752	20753	Lady Joan	38	" No , you are not a woman , you are only a child , "
20755	20789	20752	20753	Lady Joan	38	" the world is a place for you to play in . You were born to be happy , and you will never have to realize the things I have been telling you . "
20790	20798	20542	20547	the weary voice on the sofa	556	" I shall never be happy again , "
20808	20893	20542	20547	the weary voice on the sofa	556	" We all say that at eighteen ; it comforts us sometimes to be the most miserable person in the world . Then we turn round a bit , and the sun comes out again , and some one gives us a tonic , and we endow a cot at the hospital , or give a farthing meal to five hundred brats in the East End , and then we go on again . You have never been in love before , of course ? "
20894	20898	20915	20915	her	558	" Do n't , "
20921	21044	20915	20916	her Mentor	559	" I do n't want to hurt you , Norah ; I only mean that if you go in for loving once in a lifetime and that sort of thing , you really can not properly understand the utter insouciance of an emotional man like Digby . He will love you more than ever now that you have come back , and you will be ten times happier than if you had been married straight off without any drawbacks . You have got rid of your ideals , to begin with , which most of them do not accomplish until after marriage , and that is always a risk . And you will find there is lots of time to be happy . "
21045	21048	21050	21051	the other	157	" Oh , "
21067	21084	21050	21051	the other	157	" and do you really mean to say that you think I should marry him now ? "
21132	21210	21212	21212	she	38	" You are to come home with me now , and I will send down for your maid , and you shall stay the night and get rested . I suppose you have eaten nothing for hours ? Then how can you expect to take a proper view of things ? Half the troubles of life come from a bad digestion ; it 's not romantic , but then I do n't belong to your musical set . "
21258	21267	21268	21268	he	106	" That is the cleverest woman I know , "
21295	21319	21291	21291	he	106	" I suppose she will tell me which one I am to marry . And I am not in a position to object . "
21468	21519	21520	21521	Mr. Johnson	80	" Of course , indifference is the characteristic of the times , as you say , Mr. Johnson , but I am not sure that it matters much . There is not much to choose between the negative virtue of the present day and the positive wickedness of our forefathers . "
21540	21576	21578	21579	Lady Joan	38	" That is true , but we must continue to be miserable sinners in some way or other , or else the Litany would have to be expunged , and that would offend the Conservatives , "
21617	21666	21601	21601	she	38	" Ah , Mr. Raleigh , how do you do ? How good of you to come on such a short notice . You have seen Norah to - day , I think ? Our new curate , Mr. Johnson . We were just longing for some music . "
21717	21747	21688	21688	he	32	" And may we have some music , please ? Mr. Raleigh is a musician , you know , Mr. Johnson ; perhaps you know his songs , though ? "
21777	21783	21759	21759	he	80	" Love 's Sweet Illusions . "
21784	21800	21802	21803	the musician	106	" I have not written a song of that name ; I never write ballads , "
21813	21819	21821	21822	Lady Joan	38	" Something stormy , please , "
21826	21847	21821	21822	Lady Joan	38	" it is so hot that if you played anything sentimental I think it might affect even my unmusical nerves . "
21848	21854	21856	21856	Norah	60	" Something of your own , "
21903	21908	21876	21876	He	106	" Shaving of Shagpat , "
22141	22147	22148	22148	he	585	" Very sweet and pretty , "
22151	22183	22148	22148	he	585	" it quite reminds me of a little Italian thing I once heard on a military band at Leamington . Have you ever taken the waters at Leamington , Mr. Raleigh ? "
22184	22189	22191	22192	Lady Joan	38	" Play something else , "
22234	22246	22247	22247	she	38	" Have you seen the lake in moonlight , Mr. Johnson ? "
22286	22289	22290	22290	he	106	" Norah , "
22297	22310	22290	22290	he	106	" do you know when I wrote the last thing I played ? "
22320	22344	22316	22316	her	38	" I wrote it when you went away , last time , with your father . It was full of tears for you . "
22362	22370	22355	22355	she	38	" And the other ? The song ? "
22371	22374	22375	22375	he	106	" Guess , "
22395	22404	22383	22383	She	38	" Was it this evening — after — ? "
22419	22432	22411	22411	Her	38	" Oh , Digby , did it make you feel all that ? "
22433	22439	22441	22442	Lady Joan	38	" There is no doubt , "
22446	22646	22441	22442	Lady Joan	38	" that our sympathies or our antipathies make us sometimes imagine a likeness where it can not exist . I remember when I was a small child and came to stay with my great - uncle here , I used to invent every kind of excuse for going down to the post - office , because I thought the boy behind the counter was like a cousin of mine I had a romantic admiration for at the time . And of course you know how there are some days when everybody in the street reminds you of some one you do n't want to meet , and others when you feel you have not the least affinity to your own sister . The fact is , family likeness is all rubbish , like most of the traditions we have grown up with ; I mean , there is just as much chance of two strangers being alike , which you have just proved yourself , Mr. Johnson , by supposing Mr. Raleigh and my little friend Norah to be brother and sister . Shall we go in , now , or would you like another turn round the garden ? "
22711	22718	22720	22721	Lady Joan	38	" What a horrid little man , "
22729	22733	22735	22735	Norah	60	" Is he ? "
22739	22750	22752	22753	the musician	106	" Oh , I do n't think he 's bad , "
22769	22780	22781	22781	she	597	" It may be because I had to entertain him , "
22792	22801	22802	22802	they	593	" Why did n't you leave him alone ? "
22813	22821	22822	22822	she	597	" Because that was what you did , "
22825	22840	22842	22842	Norah	60	" Oh , but we thought you were getting on so well with him , "
22844	22847	22849	22849	Digby	32	" Besides , "
22851	22862	22849	22849	Digby	32	" you need not have asked him into the garden . "
22863	22869	22871	22872	Lady Joan	38	" Perhaps I need n't , "
22879	22888	22889	22889	she	38	" I am so dreadfully worried about something , "
22894	22898	22889	22889	she	38	" What about ? "
22915	22970	22899	22899	they	593	" The dilapidation of my pig - styes ; Jones says two of them will go on for some time , but the others want repairing . Now , is it worth while to have two repaired , or shall I wait until they all fall to pieces , and put up brick ones ? "
22971	22977	22979	22979	Norah	60	" That is a question , "
22988	23007	22983	22984	The musician	106	" What a fuss ladies make about trifles . If you had a man to manage your affairs — "
23008	23014	23015	23015	she	38	" But I have n't , "
23027	23041	23015	23015	she	38	" I thought of getting one , but — it has fallen through . "
23143	23196	23115	23115	she	38	" It has been the longest day I have ever spent . I suppose it is the weather . Would you shut the piano , Mr. Raleigh ? You look tired to death , Norah , and I am going to take you to bed . Come along at once , please . "
23240	23270	23224	23224	her	38	" You will come to breakfast to - morrow , and bring Sonny with you ? Say good - night and come , Norah , I am so sleepy . "
23337	23347	23348	23348	he	106	" You are the finest woman I ever met , "
23360	23378	23379	23379	she	38	" Do n't cover me with virtues I do n't possess ; I ca n't stand it , "
23393	23510	23383	23383	she	38	" Do n't you know that my god is expediency ? It is the only one that is any good for this world . I do n't want you to marry Norah , or I should not have come back to the inn to ask you to marry me . Do you suppose my pride suffered nothing by that ? However , you are going to marry her because it is absolutely the only way out of it , and I have been obliged to give in to you both . But for Heaven 's sake do n't imagine I am doing it from unselfishness , or any of that bosh , because I 'm not . "
23511	23519	23520	23520	he	606	" Then you have not forgiven me ? "
23524	23531	23533	23534	Lady Joan	38	" I shall never forgive you , "
23538	23553	23533	23534	Lady Joan	38	" is it not an insult that you should suppose me capable of forgiveness ? "
23554	23559	23561	23562	the musician	106	" Perhaps it is , "
23566	23575	23561	23562	the musician	106	" Why was I born so accursedly unlucky ? "
23576	23757	23758	23759	The musician	106	" I 'm afraid I ca n't tell you . But you seem to be going to have all you want now , so it is about time you ceased railing at your fate . I suppose if I were properly unselfish I should efface myself at once , and part from you in an affecting scene . But the people who make affecting scenes are apt to forget that they have got to meet again afterwards as ordinary actors in an ordinary play , and then the memory of the affecting scene makes them sheepish ; so I prefer to tell you that I am merely and vulgarly angry with you for inviting me to make a fool of myself . Not that I envy that poor child upstairs either ; she does n't understand you a bit , and you will wound her half - a - dozen times a day . It is not my affair , however , and you will have to get through it together somehow ; I wash my hands of you both . "
23796	23807	23786	23786	He	106	" Good - night . You will come to breakfast ? "
23808	23822	23823	23823	he	106	" Since you say so ; I always do what you tell me , "
23829	23836	23837	23837	she	38	" No , you do n't , "
23840	23880	23837	23837	she	38	" or you would never have cajoled me into saying I would marry you . If you had done what I told you to - day all this trouble would not have arisen . How brutally forgetful men are ! "
23957	23961	23921	23921	she	38	" Relton Arms , "
24009	24016	24026	24029	the worldly wise woman	613	" How brutally forgetful men are ! "
24236	24252	24255	24255	she	30	" It has been the wish of my heart to see dear Mr. Digby married , "
24265	24582	24255	24255	she	30	" indeed , I have been trying to get him a wife for some years now , only it was so impossible to find one good enough . I have no doubt that Miss Bisley is all that could be desired , and one must leave something to a higher power sometimes ; but I can not help taking a little to my own credit as well , and I am convinced that Mr. Digby would never have thought of looking out for a wife at all if it had not been for my persuasions ; he was far too fond of Ibsen , and Schopenhauer , and Bernard Shaw , and all those tiresome people . At all events , I never allowed a week to pass without asking him to dinner , and the picture of my domestic happiness must have done something for him . Ah , well , my work is done now ; and thank God my ideal of friendship is too high to stand in the way of his marrying , though I have felt towards him like a sister , and it is hard at first to give up my place to another . But at least I know how to be generous , and she shall come and stay with me at once , so that there may be one friend in London for her when she is married . She will have to let me call then ! And I shall be able to give her a hint or two about her future husband ; I 'm sure no one could know him better than I do . No doubt she is one of those artful little dolls who will annoy him until every nerve of his musical soul is on end , and he has to give up composing ; and what will posterity do then ? "

He has been like a dear brother , an elder brother , to me ever since I have known him , and it is natural that I should have the jealous feeling of a sister in seeing him belong to another . It is only at first , of course — dear me ! what a terrible tyrant deep affection is , to be sure ! Do n't mind me dear , I shall be better directly ; "
25694	25715	25716	25716	she	30	" Why , there is that forward person who used to throw herself at Mr. Digby 's head last season , "
25723	25778	25716	25716	she	30	" Lady something or another,—came into the title by a fluke , I believe . Who is the handsome fellow she is flirting with now , eh ? So that 's Jack Raleigh , is it ? Oh ! I 've heard about him . Not at all like his brother , is he ? "
25779	25785	25787	25787	Norah	60	" He 's very nice , "
25791	25840	25787	25787	Norah	60	" Nice , is he ? Then he does n't know what he 's got hold of in that young woman . I suppose she thinks as she ca n't get one , she 'll have the other . Have you been introduced to her , my dear ? "
25841	25861	25716	25716	she	30	" Yes — I have . That is , I — I stayed with her — for a night . "
25862	25998	25999	26000	The musician	106	" I 'm not surprised at that . She wants to know you after your marriage , my dear . That is where you will feel your inexperience , when these designing clever women come and play upon your ignorance in order to get at your husband . You will feel the want of some nice sensible married woman , not too old , who has been through it all , and can help you to see through them . I 've no patience with these women who wo n't have husbands of their own , but must needs go running after other people 's . Ah - h , Mr. Digby , is it really true that we are to hear the last movement of the trio this afternoon ? How quite too lovely ! "
26078	26089	26090	26091	Jack Raleigh	41	" You 're feeling played out , are n't you ? "
26104	26136	26090	26091	Jack Raleigh	41	" Oh , no , only bored to death . I wonder which is the worst , to be married or musical ? But both at once — poor Mr. Raleigh ! "
26229	26243	26245	26245	Jack	41	" So you 're off already ? I knew you were played out , "
26257	26266	26245	26245	Jack	41	" shall I let fly for a hansom ? "
26267	26284	26286	26287	Lady Joan	38	" Oh , no ; did n't I tell you before that I had the carriage ? "
26308	26319	26292	26292	she	38	" And I can see myself out , thank you . "
26320	26412	26429	26429	his	684	" But — you will let me come with you ? It 's beastly foggy out , and something might easily happen , do n't you know . You said you had n't brought the man along , and I 'd sooner see you through , ' pon my honor I would . I wo n't bother , I wo n't really , do n't you know , and you can fire me at the next block if I 'm in the way . That 's straight , is n't it ? "
26469	26479	26480	26480	she	685	" If you like , I shall be delighted , "
26496	26583	26480	26480	she	685	" you will see if the brougham is there ? Good - bye , Mrs. Routh ; so glad to see you looking so well . I suppose I ca n't give you a lift ? Auf Wiedersehen , Norah ; shall expect you both to lunch to - morrow ; do n't forget . What detestable weather it is ; I shall go and vegetate at Relton if this fog goes on . Is it there , Mr. Jack ? Oh , thanks very much . "
26679	26699	26700	26700	he	50	" I say , you — you did n't rightly mean what you said just now , did you ? "
26719	26737	26700	26700	he	50	" What did I say ? I 've forgotten long ago . You promised not to bother , "
26756	26770	26771	26771	he	50	" You said that marriage was tommy rot , do n't you know , "
26785	26798	26775	26775	She	685	" I did n't say so . But it is . Why ? "
26799	26834	26777	26777	her	685	" Oh , well , you know , because I do n't think it is exactly . At least I mean I do n't see why it should be , do n't you know . "
26835	26859	26775	26775	She	685	" Then perhaps it is n't . It does n't matter , does it ? Oh , why do n't we go on ? "
26860	26873	26874	26874	he	50	" I say , how jolly smart you are to - day , "
26883	26957	26874	26874	he	50	" Why ? Because I do n't wish to discuss the marriage question ? I am so sick of it . If that is all you want , go and read Björnson and all the others . Modern fiction is crammed with it , so is the modern drama . Your brother can lend you crowds of books about the marriage question — he wo n't want them for a year or two . "
26966	26980	26981	26981	he	50	" You know I do n't care a hang for the marriage question , "
26985	26991	26992	26992	she	685	" No more do I , "
26996	27024	26992	26992	she	685	" so we 'll let it drop . I am so glad you are not modern . Do you know , the first night I saw you — "
27025	27028	27029	27029	he	50	" Yes ? "
27055	27058	27059	27059	she	685	" Oh , "
27063	27119	27059	27059	she	685	" I only felt relieved that you had no views and no ideas , and did n't want a revolution like your brother , and never fell in love with people . It made you so nice to flirt with , that was all . Thank Heaven , we are going on again at last . "
27159	27166	27167	27167	he	50	" Do listen seriously for once , "
27170	27179	27167	27167	he	50	" why should n't marriage between two fellows — "
27180	27191	27192	27192	she	685	" I thought we had agreed to let it drop , "
27196	27212	27213	27213	he	50	" But it is n't the marriage question . It — it 's marriage itself , "
27318	27487	27488	27488	She	696	" Do n't you see how I 've loved you all the time ? It 's not my form to gas like Digby , and I suppose I 'm a bally idiot , because the guvnor always says I am , and of course I have n't any oof ; so it 's all confounded cheek on my part , it is really , do n't you know . But — you said you hated to be married , so why should n't we be engaged , just enough to stop people from talking , do n't you know , so that we could belong , sort of ; do you twig ? I 'd give you my word of honor to go back to the States , and work like a nigger till — till you sent for me again . That would n't bother you , and it might be rather jolly , do n't you know . And that 's all there is to it . "
27580	27588	27589	27589	he	696	" I do love you , dear , "
27603	27612	27589	27589	he	696	" do n't you think — we might — "
27670	27676	27677	27677	he	696	" May I kiss you ? "
27702	27706	27677	27677	he	696	" Relton Arms , "

27948	27974	27976	27977	his wife	129	" Because you said the eggs at the Stores were just as good , dear , and they are cheaper ; do n't you remember ? "
27997	28032	27991	27991	her	129	" Well , at any rate , the milk is a different thing ; just look at the cream on it . Baby ought to thrive on stuff like that , ought n't she ? "
28033	28081	28093	28094	the musician	106	" That is just what I am anxious about ; It has only upset her so far . Hark ! is that baby crying ? Precious thing ! Do you mind managing Sonny 's egg and pouring out the coffee , Digby , while I run upstairs ? "
28082	28091	28093	28094	the musician	106	" I am inclined to agree with Plato , "
28141	28148	28150	28150	Sonny	79	" Auntie Joan , Auntie Joan , "
28243	28246	28247	28247	she	38	" Well ? "
28257	28278	28247	28247	she	38	" how soon will you be tired of picknicking and ready to come to terms ? And where 's Norah ? "
28279	28323	28325	28325	he	106	" Upstairs . There 's a draught under the bedroom door , and Mrs. Haxtell has quarrelled violently with nurse . Baby cries perpetually — teeth . And I ca n't get any breakfast . That 's all so far , I think ; "
28366	28458	28357	28357	Norah	60	" Oh , is it you , Joan ? So glad to see you , dear ; sit down and have some breakfast . Why have n't you poured out the coffee , Digby ? How helpless men are ! Take baby a minute , will you ? There , you have set her off again , just when I had quieted her . She has taken cold in the night , that 's what it is . Hush , hush ! There then , it sha'n't , that it sha'n't ! "
28459	28463	28465	28466	the musician	106	" After all , "
28472	28478	28465	28466	the musician	106	" I do think Plato — "
28479	28492	28494	28494	Norah	60	" Will you give Digby something to eat , Joan , dear ? "
28506	28518	28520	28520	Sonny	79	" The lambs is fat , is n't they , daddy ? "
28528	28544	28520	28520	Sonny	79	" How does the lambs know , daddy , which sheep is their right mother ? "
28545	28550	28552	28553	the musician	106	" Confound his precocity , "
28555	28581	28552	28553	the musician	106	" what is one to do with a son like that ? Besides , I ca n't tell him myself ; how do they know ? "
28582	28587	28589	28590	Lady Joan	38	" They do n't , "
28594	28649	28589	28590	Lady Joan	38	" it 's a fact I used to dispute with my governess in my youth . It is only we who take it upon ourselves to say that they do ; we have no means of proving it . The sheep takes them as they come , and looks equally bored with them all . "
28666	28673	28675	28676	Lady Joan	38	" All nonsense , my dear , "
28680	28727	28675	28676	Lady Joan	38	" no amount of maternal instinct could help a sheep to tell her own lamb from any other sheep 's lamb . Besides , why should she want to ? As it is , she can have a change without being called fickle . Happy sheep ! "

28865	28896	28857	28857	he	106	" we have n't been chums all these years for nothing . Tell me what 's up , dear . Has n't Jack been writing to you , the scamp ? "
28897	28944	28945	28945	They	731	" Oh , yes . He always writes . He is quite good . I am the naughty one ; I always have been , I think . I am not fit to be engaged ; it is true what I told you — that day . "
29018	29031	29033	29033	Digby	32	" And what dreadful thing have you been doing now , please ? "
29050	29092	29045	29045	she	732	" Do you remember telling me that marriage was the only way out of it ? I am half inclined to agree with you now , though I wrote to Jack yesterday to break off our engagement . That is all . "
29120	29127	29128	29128	he	106	" You — did — that ? "
29136	29146	29128	29128	he	106	" what a wonderful creature you are , Joan ! "
29147	29151	29152	29152	she	732	" Only wonderful ? "
29156	29166	29152	29152	she	732	" are you sure you do n't mean heartless ? "
29167	29178	29179	29179	he	106	" Why did you do it ? Do stop laughing , "
29188	29194	29195	29195	she	732	" What do you mean ? "
29198	29206	29195	29195	she	732	" do you think I am heartless ? "
29207	29211	29213	29214	the musician	106	" Surely not , "
29232	29241	29213	29214	the musician	106	" Then why do you say I am ? "
29242	29263	29195	29195	she	732	" I — I did n't say so , if you remember , Joan . The word entirely originated with — "
29264	29270	29271	29271	she	732	" Oh , I know , "
29275	29294	29271	29271	she	732	" but why do n't you think so ? You ought to — everybody does — Norah would . "
29295	29326	29328	29329	the musician	106	" Norah isn't — Norah ca n't understand — that is , Norah does not know you so well as I do , and she is a little prejudiced sometimes — "
29331	29337	29339	29340	Lady Joan	38	" Just so , yes , "
29350	29371	29372	29372	she	732	" Then you agree with me that I have done the best thing under the circumstances , the miserable circumstances ? "
29380	29387	29389	29390	the musician	106	" I always agree with you , "
29392	29419	29389	29390	the musician	106	" but you must own that — not knowing the circumstances which — which led to your course of action , it — it becomes difficult — "
29452	29460	29461	29461	he	106	" Tell me why you did it , "
29496	29625	29626	29626	He	740	" I could n't help it , it came over me yesterday that I could n't stand it any longer . I 've always said perpetual engagements would not answer , because people could never stand the awful monotony of them . It is only the monotony of Jack 's love for me that has exhausted my patience now . If he had really been at all wild after we were engaged , which every one was so fond of prophesying to me , I think I might have got to love him too much to give him up . But — oh ! it is the badness in me I think , Digby . Why do n't you scold me instead of looking at me like that ? "
29648	29679	29626	29626	He	740	" I always told you I wanted our engagement kept secret ; it would have been much better . It was an experiment , rather a disastrous one for Jack — "
29680	29685	29859	29860	the musician	106	" And for you ? "
29686	29851	29852	29852	She	742	" — and it should never have been made public . Engagements never ought to be made public , and if they were what they claim to be they never would be . It is because they are such miserable , heartless arrangements that we have to take refuge in the approbation of society to make them a success at all ; if it were not for the connivance of their friends I do n't believe people would ever get to the marriage service at all . No wonder men say such hard things about women ; we simply destroy all the sentiment that is in them by our eagerness to cash it at once , and then we go in for a cheap cynicism and call them heartless brutes . If I were a man I would never ask a woman to be my wife , never , never , never ! At least , not if I were in love with her . "
29876	29880	29881	29881	he	106	" Poor Jack ! "
29886	29893	29894	29894	she	742	" Why do you say that ? "
29902	29917	29918	29918	he	106	" Because he might have married you , and he has just missed it , "
29972	29981	29982	29982	she	742	" Why are you so good to me ? "
29985	29989	29990	29990	he	106	" Am I ? "
30012	30032	29997	29997	he	106	" I am only what you make me . I have always been in your hands , you know . "
30033	30036	30037	30037	she	742	" Rubbish ! "
30255	30258	30259	30259	she	742	" Yes ? "
30279	30328	30271	30271	He	106	" Joan , dear , can you bear to hear something ? I — I know I am a weak fool , but some one must tell you , and Norah wo n't , and I would sooner die than give you any pain , but — Joan — "
30341	30350	30351	30351	she	742	" Tell me what there is to tell , "
30374	30380	30381	30381	she	742	" No , do n't ! "
30387	30396	30381	30381	she	742	" I think I know it . Jack — "
30397	30417	30419	30420	the musician	106	" Yes , dear . That is it . Jack will never — Jack will never have your letter , "
30438	30451	30452	30452	he	106	" It was a railway accident — they have not cabled much , "
30490	30503	30504	30504	she	742	" What a pity I did not wait for the next mail , "
30507	30518	30504	30504	she	742	" what a character for constancy I might have had ! "
30537	30548	30549	30549	Norah	60	" It is extraordinary how quietly Joan has taken it , "
30559	30742	30549	30549	Norah	60	" I often wonder if she does feel things as we do , or whether Mrs. Reginald Routh is not right about her after all . You know , she always did say that Joan 's hatred of music meant a lack of heart ; of course , that is putting it rather strongly , and I should n't call her heartless myself — because nobody is quite that ; but still , she has been strangely cool about poor Jack , and she has not even mentioned the mourning . I should not be surprised if she did not wear black at all , she is so inclined to be eccentric . I am glad I wrote to Peter Robinson 's in time for the post ; I shall get the patterns to - morrow . I do n't know when I have felt so upset , though of course it does not do to talk about it . I wish there were a piano here ; it would do us both so much good , would n't it , dear ? "
30794	30811	30812	30812	she	129	" I can not conceive what it must be to live without the love of music , "
30822	30873	30812	30812	she	129	" Music is like religion in that way , I think ; we may try to do without it when we are happy , but we want it terribly when the trials come . Now , what has Joan to fall back upon to - night , do you suppose ? "
30874	30887	30889	30890	the musician	106	" I do n't know , but I will go and see , "
30931	30940	30972	30972	he	32	" What was that you said , Digby ? "
30941	30967	30969	30969	Digby	32	" I will go and make her come down here to be cheered up . You are too tired to come , eh , childie ? "
31034	31161	31018	31018	he	32	" How nice of you to come , and what a cold creature you are ! Come and sit near the fire ; I waged a war with Mrs. Binks and had a wood fire lighted because I felt chilly , which shocked the conventional old thing very much indeed , because there never has been a fire lighted in here between spring - cleaning and Michaelmas , since the memory of man . But why should I listen to Mrs. Binks or any one else if I do n't choose ? At all events , it is nice and cosey , and I am going to tell you all my ideas . But tell me first why you came . What are you laughing at ? "
31189	31211	31172	31172	she	1067	" I am not laughing , Joan . I came to take you back to Norah — to be cheered up . "
31212	31229	31231	31231	she	1067	" Oh . It was very kind of you — both . How is the baby ? "
31258	31320	31231	31231	she	1067	" The baby is — ah — quiescent . Mrs. Haxtell is not . I think on the whole you had better not go there for amusement . My family affairs are only funny from the outside just at present . I think you had better give me your new ideas instead . What have you been thinking about all day ? "
31321	31332	31333	31333	She	1067	" That is what I am going to tell you . "
31354	31475	31333	31333	She	1067	" First of all , I hated myself for a whole hour . I thought I had got outside myself and was looking at myself like — oh , like another woman would look at me , Norah for instance . And I did n't enjoy myself for that hour at all . I almost made up my mind to go abroad again ; but it was lunchtime , and over the mayonnaise , which was particularly good to - day , I came to the conclusion that it was like running away , and everybody would say I had gone ' to get over it , ' and I could not tolerate that for a moment , could I ? "
31476	31496	31231	31231	she	1067	" Of course not , no . I know I may smoke , may n't I ? And then ? "
31497	31500	31501	31501	she	766	" Then — "
31519	31670	31501	31501	she	766	" oh , then it became very apparent from the attitude of all the servants that they had heard the news about — Jack . That is to say , Thomas spoke to me in a whisper at lunch , and never handed me anything twice , and the coachman never sent up for orders at all , and I only just stopped the maids in time from pulling down all the blinds , and Mrs. Binks has been drinking tea in the servants ' hall in her black silk dress ever since three o'clock , and did not answer my bell until I rang the second time , and then she appeared with a clean handkerchief in her hand , and a face as long as a fiddle . Are n't servants fond of a tragedy ? And am I very heartless to notice all these things , Digby ? "
31671	31676	31677	31677	he	767	" Heartless ? No , "
31692	31699	31677	31677	he	767	" and after lunch , please ? "
31700	31745	31501	31501	she	766	" Oh , after lunch I went to sleep . And when I woke up I felt better . I was able to think without getting sentimental over it . Do n't you see , it is like this . There is n't anybody . "
31746	31752	31754	31755	the musician	106	" I do n't understand , "
31757	31765	31766	31766	she	129	" I could hardly expect you to , "
31770	32012	31766	31766	she	129	" there is somebody for you . But for me there is nobody , and I am getting old , and I feel frightened sometimes . Remember , that is an admission . I do n't know why I am telling you all this , because I want to get to the end . At all events , I had a sort of sensation that I had tried more than most women to gain something , and I had hopelessly missed it ; so it was time to turn round and do something , as I should have to go on living all the same . Now , there were two courses open to me : one was to turn the literary cynic and write a novel in which I could vent my spite against my own particular Fate by personifying myself in an ill - used heroine , who talks epigrams from the moment she gets out of bed in the morning , and who loves to assure her men acquaintances that they may mention questionable topics before her if they like . And the other was to repent and do good works , and become the fashionable philanthropist , and tell the poor and fatherless that they have got to be improved in their condition whether they think they want improving or not . Guess which I chose ! Oh , I do wonder if you will guess right ; "
32027	32044	32045	32045	he	772	" If you were any ordinary clever woman , I should guess the first ; but — "
32061	32124	32059	32059	himself	772	" no , that would n't do for you , Joan . And yet , neither would the other . I ca n't imagine you walking through the village in awful , hideous garments , carrying a rice pudding and a Bible . Oh , Joan , surely you are not going in for that self - indulgent bosh known as charity ? "
32125	32136	32137	32137	She	771	" That is where you are so like a man ! "
32154	32371	32139	32139	herself	771	" You are right about the novel , yes . You see , if I were to write a book it would be so frightfully personal that I should have to take a pseudonym to begin with . And where is the satisfaction of jeering at your friends when they do n't know you are doing it ? But I do n't know why you should take up the old , played - out notion of charity as the only alternative . Who wants to go about with Bibles and rice puddings ? Nous avons changé tout cela , mon ami ! Why , there is no such thing as charity left now ; have n't you learnt that from Sir Marcus ? It is philanthropy nowadays , my good sir , equally self - indulgent , of course , but more modern and ten times more entertaining . The Bible never need come in at all , and no one sees the rice puddings , they 're all managed by committees ; all you have to do is to lend your name for the circulars of the league , and hold meetings over afternoon tea in your drawing - room , and talk . That is all . Now do you see what I mean ? "
32372	32410	32059	32059	himself	772	" I gather that you mean to take up philanthropy as a new form of diversion ; but I am afraid I do not quite recognize the full advantages of the scheme . I do n't see — "
32411	32418	32420	32421	Lady Joan	38	" Of course you do n't , "
32425	32785	32420	32421	Lady Joan	38	" you have no cause to see . I do n't see the full advantages of married life , for instance . But I am really going to be serious now , so do n't interrupt . In the first place , I am not going to be philanthropic in the country ; that only means being hopelessly under the thumb of one 's rector , or hopelessly at variance with him ; besides , it is so mortally dull , and — I do n't mean to be dull just now . So I am going up to Pont Street in October , and I shall organize a regular philanthropic campaign . Oh , I am going to have a fine time ! I shall sing for concerts in the East End , I shall paint match - boxes and gridirons and send them to fancy fairs , I shall play with the children in the hospitals , and teach the children of Whitechapel — thank Heaven ! no amount of philanthropy can ever spoil the children — I shall even give sumptuous receptions , at which we shall discuss the evils of the sweating - system and the possibility of distributing certain portions of bread and soup to the deserving poor during the cold weather . Who knows that I may not speak on a platform before long ? There is always the bearing - rein to fall back upon , if all the others fail ; or the prevention of cruelty to birds , now that wearing feathers is out of fashion ; or compulsory vaccination , or hygiene and rational dress and other horrors which are so excellent for the poor . Think of my reputation , Digby ! It will be so assured that even Mrs. Reginald Routh will not dare to cast a stone at me , and I shall be able to say just what I choose about anybody . Why , philanthropy , properly managed , is as telling as music ! Wo n't it be glorious fun , Digby ? Hey - day , what a noise I am making ! "
32812	32825	32826	32826	she	775	" Well , have you nothing to say to my beautiful idea ? "
32839	32844	32845	32845	he	106	" It is surprising , "
32857	32874	32845	32845	he	106	" how difficult it is to make ourselves understood , especially in our most intimate relations . "
32875	32882	32884	32885	Lady Joan	38	" What are you talking about ? "
32887	32891	32894	32895	the musician	106	" I mean , "
32899	32969	32894	32895	the musician	106	" that I do n't know how to tell you all that is in my mind , dear . Perhaps it is best left unsaid . I do n't know ; but — when you ask me what I think of it , I can only feel that it is all sad , dreadfully sad . I 'm afraid I have not made it very clear , have I ? "
32988	32998	32999	32999	she	38	" Tell me what it is that is sad , "
33009	33022	33023	33023	he	106	" What you have been saying , that there is n't anybody , "
33043	33050	33051	33051	she	38	" No more there is,—except you , "
33110	33144	33098	33098	she	38	" Do you know it is nearly eleven ? Norah had a bad night with the baby last night , and you look awfully tired too . Had n't you better be moving ? "
33154	33174	33175	33175	she	38	" You have not told me what you think yet . I suppose you are only laughing at me , "
33202	33220	33221	33221	he	106	" Oh , no , why should I ? I think it is very wise of you , "
33231	33250	33221	33221	he	106	" and when I tell Norah she will say ' Just like Joan ! ' Good - night . "
33260	33274	33252	33252	she	38	" Good - night , and mind you tell Norah all about it ! "
33275	33284	33286	33287	the musician	106	" I 'll be hanged if I do , "
33313	33323	33325	33326	Lady Joan	38	" I 'm sure I hope he wo n't , "
34100	34120	34121	34121	she	38	" Philanthropy is the selfish pastime of the great , and I was an owl to meddle with it , "
34296	34308	34309	34309	he	40	" Philanthropy in town is all a mistake , my dear , "
34315	34427	34309	34309	he	40	" it 's nothing but a trumped - up job among the swells , that 's what it is , of course . In my time , you know , before there were such a lot of them in the nursery , and when I was pitching my thousands right and left,—that was philanthropy if you like ! But now philanthropists are merely commercial contractors,—you mark my words , my dear , commercial contractors running the whole concern for profit ; and what good can come out of that , eh ? Ah , you must come down into the country for morals ; Londoners are the biggest thieves in existence . "
34428	34438	34439	34439	she	38	" Not so bad as that , Sir Marcus , "
34442	34476	34439	34439	she	38	" I do n't think philanthropists are commercial contractors exactly , at least not the ones I 've met . They are mostly egoists and mostly unbusinesslike , but not thieves , no . "
34477	34485	34487	34488	Sir Marcus	40	" Is n't that what I said ? "
34729	34738	34715	34716	his wife	129	" Hush - a - by - baby , "
34972	34975	34976	34976	she	60	" Yes ? "
35006	35062	34976	34976	she	60	" it is very unfortunate he should miss you so often ; but Joan has wanted him a good deal lately , and I have been only too glad , when baby has been fretful , to send him round to see her . There is such a platonic friendship between them , you know . "
35063	35074	35080	35080	her	854	" Platonic , do you call it , Mrs. Digby ? "
35084	35207	35080	35080	her	854	" Do you know , my dear Mrs. Digby , that from what I know of Plato,—and I attended all Mr. Digby 's lectures on Plato and Schopenhauer , and their relation to music and Socialism , which was before you knew him , of course,—I do n't fancy he would have countenanced such goings on in his ideal Republic ? Of course you know best , and I should not dream of interfering between a wife and a husband ; but I should certainly say myself , if I were asked , that that young woman 's behavior in Pont Street is more fit for the Old Testament than for Plato . Perhaps you have not read any Plato , though ? "
35208	35237	35244	35244	she	60	" No ; only the Old Testament ; and that I was obliged to do for myself , you see , because there were no lectures upon it , "
35278	35321	35323	35323	she	60	" Of course I should not speak so strongly , dear Mrs. Digby , if I had not known your husband so well and so intimately before he met you at all . And perhaps if I had had your good fortune , "
35337	35400	35323	35323	she	60	" and could have had a small soul to develop , I , too , should have become a womanly woman , with no desire for intellectual improvement . Ah , Mrs. Digby , you have in your child what we childless wives have failed to find in our search after wisdom . I frankly own that you are to be envied . "
35420	35455	35412	35412	Digby	97	" Joan has sent round for me to help her out of a difficulty . Any message , childie ? I shall be back to dinner . And have you seen my warm gloves ? "
35456	35500	35404	35404	her	60	" I mended them and put them in your drawer , dear . That 's just like a man to be surprised at finding them in the right place ! Oh , I wish you would write about the bath - room pipe — "
35501	35504	35506	35506	Digby	97	" Damn , "
35510	35530	35506	35506	Digby	97	" Do n't , Digby . It really is important , because the wall is getting damp , and — "
35531	35546	35404	35404	her	60	" That does n't matter , does it ? I 've moved the piano . "
35547	35559	35404	35404	her	60	" But it is coming through into the nursery , Digby . "
35560	35575	35506	35506	Digby	97	" Oh , all right . I 'll do it when I come in . "
35576	35583	35404	35404	her	60	" Mrs. Reginald has been here . "
35584	35600	35404	35404	her	60	" I know ; that 's why I have n't . What did she say ? "
35601	35622	35506	35506	Digby	97	" She seemed to think that you and Joan were enacting an Old Testament episode without the sanction of inspiration . "
35623	35628	35506	35506	Digby	97	" What awful cheek ! "
35629	35648	35404	35404	her	60	" Oh , she only meant to be friendly , I think . She seemed to admire baby . "
35649	35668	35506	35506	Digby	97	" Deuced clever woman , Mrs. Reginald . I 'll write about the pipe when I come in . "
36049	36052	36054	36058	the man with the beard	872	" Digby ! "
36172	36198	36199	36199	he	856	" You — you must not go into her suddenly like this ; it might kill her , the shock , do n't you know , "
36353	36362	36363	36363	he	856	" I — I feel quite queer myself , "
36378	36439	36363	36363	he	856	" why on earth did n't you let us know that the wrong man — that the other man was killed ? You always did imagine that we knew all about you without your troubling to write to us , Jack . Never was so surprised in my life,—delighted , I should say . But what does it all mean ? "
36440	36587	36363	36363	he	856	" Eh , what ? Why , do n't you see , I thought it was all bally rot to write and explain that they had cabled my name instead of Jack Rackstraw 's , because I meant to come over that next mail . And then , when I got another berth offered me with an elegant screw , I reckoned I 'd take it and go on being dead for a space , rather a scheme , do n't you twig ? And besides , I thought if I lay low till next fall Joan might find out she cared for me a bit more than she calculated , eh ? Has n't it been hard work , though , just sitting tight and not hearing from her ! Now , fire yourself , Digby , and let me freeze on to that bell . "
36588	36596	36598	36599	the musician	106	" But look here , old man , "
36603	36659	36598	36599	the musician	106	" let me go in first and explain . You go round to Norah and wait till I come for you . These — these shocks are too much for women ; they ca n't always stand them ; women ca n't , you know . Surely you must see the folly of frightening her — "
36660	36719	36720	36720	He	883	" You old woman , Digby ; what by all that 's holy are you playing at ? Joan 's not that sort ; besides , if you 'd been away three years , old chap , I guess you 'd run the risk of seeing a girl turn pale for you . Eh ? So clear out . "
36780	36837	36769	36769	Jack	41	" ' Pon my word , if Joan 's half as frightened as you look now , I shall begin to believe it is a shock to meet some one who 's supposed to have kicked . You want a drink , old man , and if you do n't go and get it now I — "
36838	36941	36769	36769	Jack	41	" I know , I ' m going , I am really , Jack . It 's purely for your own good I am speaking ; why should it matter to me ? But you 're such an unsuspecting chap , and I do n't want to see you made a fool of ; and look here , Jack , I 'm a brute to suggest it , I know , but women are fickle , as all the world knows , and she thought you were dead , and after all no one could blame her if — don't you see ? "
36979	37081	37082	37082	Jack	41	" Of course , I 'm not insinuating that there 's some one else , I do n't know his name if there is ; but knowing their nature as I do , I think it 's wiser not to — not to give them a clean bill of constancy always — eh ? At all events , how would it be for me to meet you at the flat when I 've sounded the ground a bit with Joan ? It would only make a delay of half - an - hour or so , and — my dear fellow ! "
37127	37205	37206	37206	Digby	97	" You brute — you ! Why do you want to keep me from her ? If you were any one else standing between her and me I would wipe the floor with you . There — clear out , ca n't you ? Oh , hang it , I 've been half crazed to meet her all day , and now — that devilish suggestion of yours — ah ! ca n't you go , you ? "
37240	37281	37225	37225	he	890	" Poor chap , I forgive you when I think of the hash you are going to make of it . You were n't born to deal with wily women , and when to - morrow comes , ah ! — "
37313	37321	37323	37324	Lady Joan	38	" What is it ? Anything wrong ? "
37328	37383	37323	37324	Lady Joan	38	" No , no , nothing . Only I feel as though I had been persuading you against your will and for my own selfish reasons , and I came back to say so . There is nothing to keep you in England — nothing . Why not go abroad — to - morrow ? "
37384	37435	37436	37436	He	894	" Oh . Is that all ? How stupid of you to come back and look tragic just for that . And as if I should not go without waiting for your permission , Monsieur ! Why , I have just been making out a route . Come and look . "
37500	37520	37492	37492	He	894	" I wish you 'd say something , Digby . You look as if you 'd seen a ghost . "
37521	37525	37526	37526	he	894	" I have , "
37541	37546	37547	37547	she	38	" Whose was it ? "
37556	37567	37547	37547	she	38	" My brother Jack 's . He is in London . "
37613	37620	37621	37621	she	38	" Is — it — true ? "
37640	37654	37621	37621	she	38	" I have spoken to him . Would to God it were not ! "
37708	37725	37726	37726	she	38	" I 've always known that he must come back . Jack could never be dead , "
37735	37759	37726	37726	she	38	" he is overflowing with life , crude , arrogant life . Why did I believe them when they said he was dead ? "
37760	37768	37770	37771	the musician	106	" Perhaps you wished to believe it , "
37812	37819	37820	37820	he	894	" Shall we resume our conversation ? "
37828	37909	37820	37820	he	894	" How can we ? I must wait a little , see Jack , no , no , not see him , but — but write to him — if it is possible he never had my other letter ? Why has he come back to torment me just when I was beginning to feel happy ? And — oh , drop that book , ca n't you ? Do n't you understand that I can not go abroad now ? "
37910	37914	37800	37800	her	38	" Why not ? "
37915	37984	38032	38032	He	898	" Because , oh , how dense you are ! Even if I can get away from Jack , and I feel as if I never should be free again , but even supposing I can break his heart and leave him , how can I go away and be by myself interminably ? You do n't know me if you think that would do me any good . "
37985	38015	38016	38016	She	897	" I do n't think so . I did not suggest your going alone . You do n't know me if — you think I could let you go . "
38044	38050	38032	38032	He	898	" What do you mean ? "
38051	38077	38078	38078	She	897	" What I have said . You do n't want to see Jack . I will take you away from him . Will you come ? "
38098	38106	38107	38107	he	898	" I believe you like him still , "
38142	38161	38129	38129	She	897	" I should hate him — if he were worth it . But I have never loved him . "
38162	38172	38173	38173	She	897	" Then answer my question . Will you come ? "
38183	38198	38173	38173	She	897	" We were so happy as it was . Ca n't it go on ? "
38199	38223	38224	38224	She	897	" No , it can not go on . If you were a man you would not ask that . Will you come ? "
38257	38266	38267	38267	he	899	" You are frightened , are you not ? "
38270	38286	38267	38267	he	899	" Of you ? No , I do n't think I am frightened of you . "
38302	38328	38295	38295	his	899	" Not of me , oh , no . But , all the same , you are frightened , or else you would not hesitate . "
38344	38350	38335	38335	she	897	" You are not going ? "
38351	38360	38361	38361	he	899	" Not if you wish me to stay , "
38371	38389	38361	38361	he	899	" I do want you to stay — give me time to think , Digby — I — "
38460	38465	38466	38466	she	897	" I will come , "
38680	38684	38692	38692	They	910	" Welcome home ! "
39017	39026	39028	39029	Tom Clarke	95	" Tell ye what it is , George , "
39054	39112	39039	39039	he	929	" I be altogether flustered along o ' them new fancies of the Squire , I be . What be rabbits , hey , man ? Can ye tell me that , now ? Ye be oop at the Manor all day , along o ' the Squire hisself , so ye ought to know for sure . "
39162	39441	39442	39444	Mrs. Tom Clarke	95	" Rabbits beats me altogether , I be bound to own . They bain't poultry , and they bain't butcher 's meat neither . What be they , anyhow ? The Squire be a proper kind gentleman for sure , but when he takes up with them okkard new fancies what no one ca n't explain , it be proper hard to know how to treat ' un . Why , George man , when the parson was readin ' of the Litany , Sunday past , and come to the ' kindly fruits of the earth , ' I thinks to myself , ' that 's rabbits , that is , ' and I shuts my mouth tight , I does ! And me what 's never missed sayin ' and singin ' all the prayer - book allows ' un to do , this forty year that I 've sat in the choir up agin poor Jack Priest 's tablet . ' T ai n't as though I be an unreligious body what sings an ' do n't pray , as I 've known some do ; but there 's never a Amen that I do n't take part in , and there bain't a trap in the service as can catch me now , allays allowin ' for the reply to the tenth commandment what were put in by the devil or the chapel people , and caught on by the parsons accidental , so to speak . So you see how a man be upset all along o ' them beasts , if ye can call a thing a beast what eats like string . "
39737	39748	39750	39751	Sir Marcus	40	" I must have Joan down ; she would sympathize , "
39770	39827	39750	39751	Sir Marcus	40	" Splendid woman , Joan , never laughs at my little ideas , and takes such an interest in them . Shows what intelligence can do for a girl . She 'd have made Jack realize the responsibilities of existence , she would . Devil take my head , why is it swimming so this afternoon ? "
39868	39870	39859	39859	he	264	" duck "
39873	39876	39859	39859	he	264	" rabbit , "
39900	39915	39917	39918	Sir Marcus	40	" Digby used to come down and see me oftener than he does now , "
39933	40232	39917	39918	Sir Marcus	40	" I do n't like his being away so long , and the dear little boy too ; why do n't they come and see me ? Got a wife ? Oh , to be sure , yes ; my memory do n't seem so strong as it was , somehow : to be sure , a wife , yes . Nice little thing , very ; wonder if she would know how many we get yearly from Holland ? My hand gets more tired than it used , though it would n't do to say so ; people are so ready to talk about an old man breaking up before he 's out of the sixties . Why , I walked up from the post - office in eight minutes and a half this morning ; I can beat the youngsters now , eh ? I wish Joan would come and catch hold of this accursed letter , it keeps drifting so far away . I always wonder what made her take Digby ; funny fellow , Digby . What am I saying ? It 's Jack who is her husband , is n't it ? I 've been writing too much to - day , that 's what it is . I 'm only a little queer , but — I wish Joan would come and finish my letter for me . Why wo n't Digby bring her down now ? Let 's get hold of the whiskey ; that 's what I want to set me straight , of course . What nonsense they are talking ; men do n't fall to pieces when they are sixty - four . I can walk with the best of them , eh , Joan , my dear ? "
40397	40512	40513	40513	Joan	38	" I think on consideration that the new form of diversion you proposed to me the other night would not work so well as we thought . So I am not going to entertain it any longer . You will probably blame me for my vacillation ; but then , you should not have established a precedent for vacillation in the ' Relton Arms , ' four years ago . After all , there is nothing left but the book ; and I am going to be away , and alone , until I have written it . Do n't be alarmed . I am not going to soak it with my own experiences . "
40515	40570	40513	40513	Joan	38	" His younger brother , in the other carriage , did not look at any one when he took his letter from his breast - pocket and unfolded it . It was very limp , and looked as though it had been unfolded many times before . It was dated two days earlier : — "
40696	40700	40684	40684	I	0	" Joan Relton . "
40834	40842	40844	40844	Jack	102	" Stupid of George to be late , "
40871	40884	40885	40885	she	38	" It was odd that we should all catch the same train , "
40898	40908	40885	40885	she	38	" I suppose you have not been down before ? "
40909	40930	40931	40931	he	102	" No ; they only knew of my arrival in time to cable to me that my father was dying , "
40943	40954	40931	40931	he	102	" life is very rum sometimes , is n't it ? "
40955	40958	40959	40959	she	38	" Always , "
41003	41031	41033	41033	Jack	102	" I say , wo n't you let fly for the fire in the booking - office till George comes ? I reckon you 're cold some , "
41038	41050	41051	41051	she	38	" Oh , no , please do n't trouble about me , "
41076	41082	41083	41083	he	49	" He 's always late , "
41105	41114	41116	41117	Lady Joan	38	" He is a countryman , you see , "
41122	41134	41136	41136	Jack	102	" And the mother has been at him for six years , "
41215	41223	41236	41236	Joan	38	" How is your master , George ? "
41224	41234	41236	41236	Joan	38	" Yes , how is Sir Marcus , George ? "
41240	41254	41257	41261	the solitary porter from behind	987	" Aye , how be the Squire , for sure , poor gentleman ? "
41263	41278	41280	41280	Digby	97	" And what on earth possessed you to bring the luggage cart , George ? "
41306	41515	41533	41533	he	989	" He be proper bad , he be ; leastways so the cook told me when I come by the larder window with the sprouts , or I should say the celery for dinner it was , an ' Lady Raleigh , she would have it as it were too slippy to bring the dog - cart , notwithstandin ' as it bain't the cart what falls down , but the animal for sure , an ' he wo n't last till mornin ' , poor gentleman , though the best London doctor come down by the five - forty o ' purpose to have a last look of him , what went far towards killin ' of ' i m off in my thinkin ' . An ' the luggage is to be sent on afterwards , if ye please , Mr. Jack ; an ' Tom Clarke he says as how he means to put off his visit to his sister , what 's married into the grocery business at Reading , till he be sure how things means to turn out , cos he says he bain't a - goin' of to miss a choreal funeral , what has n't been for nigh upon thirty — "
41516	41526	41528	41528	Digby	97	" Go to the horse 's head , George , "
41543	41569	41533	41533	he	989	" it is not very comfortable , I am afraid , but Jack and I will walk on , which will give you more room . "
41579	41590	41591	41591	she	38	" You had better come too , had n't you ? "
41594	41603	41591	41591	she	38	" it would be much quicker , and — "
41604	41616	41619	41620	the porter	991	" Aye , sir , there be room and to spare , "
41624	41686	41619	41620	the porter	991	" you 've only got to put your arms round one another all tidy an ' comfortable like , an ' there ai n't no fear o ' tumbling out . Bless ye , sir , there be as many as six together in a cart like this on market days , all as safe and as pleasant as can be . "
41687	41700	41702	41702	George	49	" An ' there bain't no time to lose , Mr. Digby , "
41710	41732	41702	41702	George	49	" leastways , the end might come while we be gossipin ' here , and the Lord grant him a peaceful — "
41733	41742	41744	41745	Lady Joan	38	" Come and take the reins , George , "
41757	41775	41744	41745	Lady Joan	38	" and get in quickly , you two ; there 's loads of room , of course . "
41831	41850	41851	41851	he	995	" Hold on tight to the lady , sirs ; that be the only way of doin' it , "
41989	41995	41996	41997	Lady Joan	38	" Soon , quite soon , "
42062	42076	42077	42077	he	50	" I was a fool ever to think you could care for me , "
42136	42163	42164	42164	she	38	" I let you think I did . It was my fault , as I told you before . Had n't we better let it drop ? "
42168	42181	42182	42182	she	38	" Oh , heavens ! how old I am beginning to look , "
42199	42208	42209	42209	he	1007	" It is only because you are tired , "
42219	42226	42227	42227	she	38	" At least you are truthful , "
42232	42349	42227	42227	she	38	" tell me you are not wild with me , Jack . I have treated you abominably , have n't I ? If only you were not so provokingly good - tempered about it , I should feel much better , I think . I always did hate whipping a dog that did n't howl . Ah , you do n't understand a bit ! I believe I am rotten all through , and that is why I have dished my life so effectually . And I 'm not a bit sorry , and I mean to have a good time still . Hey - day ! But tell me you 're not wild , Jack . "
42350	42372	42373	42373	he	1008	" Oh , that 's all straight now . And it 's much worse for you , do n't you know , "
42385	42422	42381	42381	his	1008	" I shall do all right ; do n't you fret yourself about me . I ought to have known I should n't do for you . Digby will take you to the station , eh ? "
42423	42429	42430	42430	she	1009	" I am going alone , "
42575	42799	42544	42546	Poor Lady Raleigh	45	" You wo n't take anything to heart , dear , that Jack has said to you ? He does n't mean anything he says , you know , so you must believe him when he says he loves you as much as ever . He tells me it is all right , so I am not going to say anything about it ; but of course you 'll look on this as your home until he marries you , wo n't you , dear ? And I assure you Jack can not bear to be away from you a single hour , but he does like to stay in his home best , so you wo n't think anything of his not walking to the station with you . Of course Digby is only too pleased to go with you , and all the fields about here are crowded with dangerous bulls , and if you are not quick you will lose the train , and they never keep it for you at these country stations , you know . So you must have Digby , of course . And you are sure you understand about dear Jack ? You must n't listen to him , that 's all ; he says he is so fond of you still , dear boy . "
42800	42836	42839	42839	Helen	43	" Do have Digby , Joan ; he does n't leave till to - morrow , and he only hangs about the place doing nothing , and it will take him out for an hour . "
42841	42849	42851	42852	Lady Joan	38	" I am sorry to disappoint everybody , "
42862	42916	42918	42918	she	38	" but if I did lose the train , Digby would not be of the least use to me in producing another one ; and I 'm afraid I am not nearly unselfish enough to burden myself with his company for the good of the community ; so good - bye , sir ; "
42962	42982	42983	42983	he	1019	" Good - bye . They seem very anxious to burden you with my presence , do n't they ? "
42991	42998	42983	42983	he	1019	" all luck to the book . "
42999	43013	43014	43014	He	1019	" Thanks . I will send it to you in instalments for criticism . "
43052	43068	43069	43069	he	1019	" I shall go up to - night , I think , and surprise Norah , "
43135	43144	43145	43145	she	60	" Why are you here to - night ? "
43190	43202	43203	43203	she	60	" So Joan went away to - day , did she ? "
43206	43215	43216	43216	he	1019	" Joan ? Did she write to you ? "
43220	43229	43216	43216	he	1019	" Oh , no . But I knew , "
43236	43245	43246	43246	he	1019	" How did you know , wise woman ? "
43250	43260	43261	43261	she	60	" Because you have come home , of course , "
43289	43298	43299	43299	he	1019	" What has come over you , childie ? "
43324	43365	43366	43366	she	60	" Oh , nothing . Only it is a pity you leave your coats about . I should never have known if you had not been so careless . At least , I fancy I have known all the winter , "
43375	43379	43380	43380	he	1019	" Known what ? "
43418	43426	43427	43427	he	1019	" What a hellish sport marriage is ! "
43445	43448	43434	43434	She	60	" Digby . "
43449	43467	43468	43468	he	1019	" Well ? I do n't want you to touch me , if you would rather not , "
43479	43486	43487	43487	she	60	" I want to tell you , "
43492	43568	43487	43487	she	60	" I found Joan 's letter , and I read it as a matter of course ; I thought it was about — oh , never mind what . That was the day you went down to Murville ; and I could not speak to you then . It has been so dreadful waiting for you to come back , Digby . Are you not going to look at me , now you have come ? "
43582	43599	43569	43569	He	1019	" Good God , Norah , do you mean you can know that , and — ? "
43600	43766	43487	43487	she	60	" Yes , dear . I think I know more than you . I think I know how you have been feeling lately , and all the winter . But I did not know it was as bad as this , and when I read that letter — do you know how I felt ? I think I must tell you , Digby ; I have had something to bear too , you know . I felt first that something terrible had come between you and me , something that wanted pushing away with all my might ; and I could n't do it alone , Digby , and you — you were not there to help me . And then — I only felt sorry for you . I have just longed for you to come back that I might put my arms round you and comfort you , and tell you that I knew . Digby , do n't turn away like that . "
43767	43799	43800	43800	He	1032	" But — it is inconceivable — do you know what you are saying ? Do you know that if that letter had not been written , I should have — ? "
43855	43863	43864	43864	she	1033	" No , no , not that ! "
43867	43974	43864	43864	she	1033	" never that ! I knew it could not be . If I had thought you capable of that , should I be speaking to you now like this ? Do you think women are such fools then ? I know , she knew — that you were not capable of it , that you never meant it , that it was one of your queer impulses that make me love you so madly , and that she can never forgive in you . That is why she wrote you that letter . That is why you are mine now , mine , mine , mine ! "
44002	44030	44032	44032	Norah	60	" We must have Joan up to stay with us ; she could write nicely at the table in the dining - room , could n't she ? "
44051	44073	44074	44074	he	106	" Oh , do you think so ? I fancy she 'll be all right down at Relton for the present , "
44094	44150	44152	44152	she	129	" It 's just as you like , dear . And do you know , baby is so wonderfully good now she has nearly all her teeth , that I believe you would find the study quiet enough to write music in . It has been very uncomfortable for you lately , has n't it ? "
44154	44188	44190	44190	he	106	" Oh , it 's been all right . And I do n't think I want to write music much . I say , do you think baby will take to me now ? "
44205	44240	44241	44241	she	129	" I was thinking how Joan once said that I should never be able to understand your nature , and that you would be wounding me half - a - dozen times a day , "
44248	44254	44255	44255	he	106	" How absurd of her , "
44264	44289	44262	44262	himself	106	" but then you know , childie , Joan has always been possessed with the idea that we were not born for each other . "
44290	44297	44299	44299	Norah	60	" Could anything be more ridiculous ? "
44366	44370	44371	44371	he	106	" Good heavens ! "
44376	44400	44371	44371	he	106	" if it were not for habit what chance would there be for marriage ? Next time I see Joan , I 'll — "
