1963	1980	1981	1981	he	24	" I hope it was but a friendly call on the part of the old gentleman ! "
3220	3227	3228	3228	I	0	" How did I get here ? "
3241	3248	3228	3228	I	0	" You came through the door , "
3622	3631	3632	3632	I	0	" I did not come through any door , "
3635	3649	3651	3652	the raven	233	" I saw you come through it!—saw you with my own ancient eyes ! "
3659	3666	3667	3667	I	0	" I never saw any door ! "
3670	3675	3676	3676	he	232	" Of course not ! "
3679	3713	3714	3714	he	232	" all the doors you had yet seen — and you have n't seen many — were doors in ; here you came upon a door out ! The strange thing to you , "
3719	3738	3714	3714	he	232	" will be , that the more doors you go out of , the farther you get in ! "
3739	3749	3651	3652	the raven	233	" Oblige me by telling me where I am . "
3750	3780	3714	3714	he	232	" That is impossible . You know nothing about whereness . The only way to come to know where you are is to begin to make yourself at home . "
3781	3794	3714	3714	he	232	" How am I to begin that where everything is so strange ? "
3795	3800	3651	3652	the raven	233	" By doing something . "
3801	3804	3714	3714	he	232	" What ? "
3805	3839	3714	3714	he	232	" Anything ; and the sooner you begin the better ! for until you are at home , you will find it as difficult to get out as it is to get in . "
3840	3862	3714	3714	he	232	" I have , unfortunately , found it too easy to get in ; once out I shall not try again ! "
3863	3889	3651	3652	the raven	233	" You have stumbled in , and may , possibly , stumble out again . Whether you have got in unfortunately remains to be seen . "
3890	3899	3714	3714	he	232	" Do you never go out , sir ? "
3900	3956	3714	3714	he	232	" When I please I do , but not often , or for long . Your world is such a half - baked sort of place , it is at once so childish and so self - satisfied — in fact , it is not sufficiently developed for an old raven — at your service ! "
3957	3975	3714	3714	he	232	" Am I wrong , then , in presuming that a man is superior to a bird ? "
3976	4014	3651	3652	the raven	233	" That is as it may be . We do not waste our intellects in generalising , but take man or bird as we find him.—I think it is now my turn to ask you a question ! "
4015	4023	4024	4024	I	0	" You have the best of rights , "
4027	4037	4024	4024	I	0	" in the fact that you can do so ! "
4038	4042	4043	4043	he	234	" Well answered ! "
4046	4062	4043	4043	he	234	" Tell me , then , who you are — if you happen to know . "
4063	4078	3651	3652	the raven	233	" How should I help knowing ? I am myself , and must know ! "
4079	4126	4127	4127	I	0	" If you know you are yourself , you know that you are not somebody else ; but do you know that you are yourself ? Are you sure you are not your own father?—or , excuse me , your own fool?—Who are you , pray ? "
4285	4290	4291	4291	he	239	" Look at me , "
4294	4302	4291	4291	he	239	" and tell me who I am . "
4359	4368	4369	4369	I	0	" I have seen you before , sir , "
4378	4389	4390	4390	he	239	" How can you say so from seeing me behind ? "
4393	4417	4390	4390	he	239	" Did you ever see yourself behind ? You have never seen yourself at all!—Tell me now , then , who I am . "
4418	4425	4426	4426	I	0	" I humbly beg your pardon , "
4429	4449	4426	4426	I	0	" I believe you were once the librarian of our house , but more who I do not know . "
4450	4458	4390	4390	he	239	" Why do you beg my pardon ? "
4459	4468	4469	4469	I	0	" Because I took you for a raven , "
4487	4494	4495	4495	he	242	" You did me no wrong , "
4498	4683	4684	4684	He	244	" Calling me a raven , or thinking me one , you allowed me existence , which is the sum of what one can demand of his fellow - beings . Therefore , in return , I will give you a lesson:—No one can say he is himself , until first he knows that he is , and then what himself is . In fact , nobody is himself , and himself is nobody . There is more in it than you can see now , but not more than you need to see . You have , I fear , got into this region too soon , but none the less you must get to be at home in it ; for home , as you may or may not know , is the only place where you can go out and in . There are places you can go into , and places you can go out of ; but the one place , if you do but find it , where you may go out and in both , is home . "

5389	5453	5386	5386	I	0	" what is there to secure me against my own brain ? Can I tell what it is even now generating?—what thought it may present me the next moment , the next month , or a year away ? What is at the heart of my brain ? What is behind my think ? Am I there at all?—Who , what am I ? "

6318	6323	6302	6302	his	269	" You hear that ? "
6362	6372	6357	6357	I	0	" Fine weather for the worms , Mr. Raven ! "
6373	6376	6377	6377	he	269	" Yes , "
6391	6415	6416	6416	he	269	" the ground will be nice for them to get out and in!—It must be a grand time on the steppes of Uranus ! "
6424	6441	6416	6416	he	269	" I believe it is raining there too ; it was , all the last week ! "
6442	6452	6453	6453	I	0	" Why should that make it a grand time ? "
6456	6465	6466	6466	he	269	" Because the animals there are all burrowers , "
6469	6488	6466	6466	he	269	" — like the field - mice and the moles here.—They will be , for ages to come . "
6489	6503	6504	6504	I	0	" How do you know that , if I may be so bold ? "
6507	6519	6520	6520	he	269	" As any one would who had been there to see , "
6523	6626	6520	6520	he	269	" It is a great sight , until you get used to it , when the earth gives a heave , and out comes a beast . You might think it a hairy elephant or a deinotherium — but none of the animals are the same as we have ever had here . I was almost frightened myself the first time I saw the dry - bog - serpent come wallowing out — such a head and mane ! and such eyes!—But the shower is nearly over . It will stop directly after the next thunder - clap . There it is ! "
6648	6655	6657	6658	the raven	233	" Now we should be going ! "
6669	6673	6674	6674	I	0	" Going where ? "
6677	6685	6686	6686	he	269	" Going where we have to go , "
6689	6718	6686	6686	he	269	" You did not surely think you had got home ? I told you there was no going out and in at pleasure until you were at home ! "
6719	6727	6728	6728	I	0	" I do not want to go , "
6731	6744	6745	6745	he	269	" That does not make any difference — at least not much , "
6748	6754	6728	6728	I	0	" This is the way ! "
6755	6764	6686	6686	he	269	" I am quite content where I am . "
6765	6778	6779	6779	He	269	" You think so , but you are not . Come along . "
6793	6804	6805	6805	I	0	" I will not leave the house to - day , "
6810	6818	6820	6821	the raven	233	" You will come into the garden ! "
6823	6830	6831	6831	I	0	" I give in so far , "
6866	6873	6874	6874	I	0	" You will wet your feet ! "
6877	6883	6884	6884	he	269	" And mire my beak , "
6932	6937	6938	6938	I	0	" Tut ! tut ! "
6941	6956	6938	6938	I	0	" you mistake , Mr. Raven : worms are not the larvæ of butterflies ! "
6957	6961	6962	6962	he	269	" Never mind , "
6965	7004	6962	6962	he	269	" it will do for once ! I 'm not a reading man at present , but sexton at the — at a certain graveyard — cemetery , more properly — in — at — no matter where ! "
7005	7058	6938	6938	I	0	" I see ! you ca n't keep your spade still : and when you have nothing to bury , you must dig something up ! Only you should mind what it is before you make it fly ! No creature should be allowed to forget what and where it came from ! "
7059	7062	7064	7065	the raven	233	" Why ? "
7067	7081	7064	7065	the raven	233	" Because it will grow proud , and cease to recognise its superiors . "
7095	7103	7105	7106	the raven	233	" Where do the worms come from ? "
7116	7129	7130	7130	I	0	" Why , from the earth , as you have just seen ! "
7133	7138	7139	7139	he	233	" Yes , last ! "
7142	7162	7163	7163	he	233	" But they ca n't have come from it first — for that will never go back to it ! "
7200	7209	7210	7210	I	0	" Surely the sun is not going down ! "
7217	7222	7224	7225	the raven	233	" Oh , no ! "
7227	7235	7224	7225	the raven	233	" That red belongs to the worm . "
7236	7248	7249	7249	I	0	" You see what comes of making creatures forget their origin ! "
7255	7272	7273	7273	he	233	" It is well , surely , if it be to rise higher and grow larger ! "
7276	7287	7273	7273	he	233	" But indeed I only teach them to find it ! "
7288	7298	7323	7323	his	233	" Would you have the air full of worms ? "
7299	7320	7321	7321	In	26	" That is the business of a sexton . If only the rest of the clergy understood it as well ! "
7386	7399	7400	7400	I	0	" What right have you to treat me so , Mr. Raven ? "
7406	7419	7400	7400	I	0	" Am I , or am I not , a free agent ? "
7420	7438	7440	7441	the raven	233	" A man is as free as he chooses to make himself , never an atom freer , "
7443	7457	7440	7441	the raven	233	" You have no right to make me do things against my will ! "
7458	7473	7400	7400	I	0	" When you have a will , you will find that no one can . "
7474	7486	7487	7487	I	0	" You wrong me in the very essence of my individuality ! "
7490	7515	7487	7487	I	0	" If you were an individual I could not , therefore now I do not . You are but beginning to become an individual . "
7590	7597	7599	7600	the raven	233	" Perhaps it may comfort you , "
7602	7637	7599	7600	the raven	233	" to be told that you have not yet left your house , neither has your house left you . At the same time it can not contain you , or you inhabit it ! "
7638	7645	7646	7646	I	0	" I do not understand you , "
7649	7654	7646	7646	I	0	" Where am I ? "
7655	7664	7665	7665	he	233	" In the region of the seven dimensions , "
7683	7702	7673	7673	his	233	" You had better follow me carefully now for a moment , lest you should hurt some one ! "
7703	7725	7646	7646	I	0	" There is nobody to hurt but yourself , Mr. Raven ! I confess I should rather like to hurt you ! "
7726	7752	7646	7646	I	0	" That you see nobody is where the danger lies . But you see that large tree to your left , about thirty yards away ? "
7753	7764	7765	7765	I	0	" Of course I do : why should I not ? "
7769	7789	7765	7765	I	0	" Ten minutes ago you did not see it , and now you do not know where it stands ! "
7790	7794	7646	7646	I	0	" I do . "
7795	7803	7646	7646	I	0	" Where do you think it stands ? "
7804	7814	7646	7646	I	0	" Why there , where you know it is ! "
7815	7820	7646	7646	I	0	" Where is there ? "
7821	7830	7831	7831	I	0	" You bother me with your silly questions ! "
7834	7842	7831	7831	I	0	" I am growing tired of you ! "
7843	7862	7863	7863	he	300	" That tree stands on the hearth of your kitchen , and grows nearly straight up its chimney , "
7866	7877	7863	7863	he	300	" Now I know you are making game of me ! "
7887	7907	7878	7878	I	0	" Was I making game of you when you discovered me looking out of your star - sapphire yesterday ? "
7908	7919	7831	7831	I	0	" That was this morning — not an hour ago ! "
7920	7938	7831	7831	I	0	" I have been widening your horizon longer than that , Mr. Vane ; but never mind ! "
7939	7951	7952	7952	I	0	" You mean you have been making a fool of me ! "
7959	7971	7952	7952	I	0	" Excuse me : no one can do that but yourself ! "
7972	7980	7831	7831	I	0	" And I decline to do it . "
7981	7985	7831	7831	I	0	" You mistake . "
7986	7989	7952	7952	I	0	" How ? "
7990	8018	7831	7831	I	0	" In declining to acknowledge yourself one already . You make yourself such by refusing what is true , and for that you will sorely punish yourself . "
8019	8024	7831	7831	I	0	" How , again ? "
8025	8033	7952	7952	I	0	" By believing what is not true . "
8034	8056	7831	7831	I	0	" Then , if I walk to the other side of that tree , I shall walk through the kitchen fire ? "
8057	8094	7831	7831	I	0	" Certainly . You would first , however , walk through the lady at the piano in the breakfast - room . That rosebush is close by her . You would give her a terrible start ! "
8095	8104	7952	7952	I	0	" There is no lady in the house ! "
8105	8135	7831	7831	I	0	" Indeed ! Is not your housekeeper a lady ? She is counted such in a certain country where all are servants , and the liveries one and multitudinous ! "
8136	8146	7831	7831	I	0	" She can not use the piano , anyhow ! "
8147	8166	7952	7952	I	0	" Her niece can : she is there — a well - educated girl and a capital musician . "
8167	8187	7952	7952	I	0	" Excuse me ; I can not help it : you seem to me to be talking sheer nonsense ! "
8188	8230	7831	7831	I	0	" If you could but hear the music ! Those great long heads of wild hyacinth are inside the piano , among the strings of it , and give that peculiar sweetness to her playing!—Pardon me : I forgot your deafness ! "
8231	8235	8236	8236	I	0	" Two objects , "
8239	8252	8236	8236	I	0	" can not exist in the same place at the same time ! "
8253	8302	7831	7831	I	0	" Can they not ? I did not know!—I remember now they do teach that with you . It is a great mistake — one of the greatest ever wiseacre made ! No man of the universe , only a man of the world could have said so ! "
8303	8313	8314	8314	I	0	" You a librarian , and talk such rubbish ! "
8317	8332	8314	8314	I	0	" Plainly , you did not read many of the books in your charge ! "
8333	8418	7831	7831	I	0	" Oh , yes ! I went through all in your library — at the time , and came out at the other side not much the wiser . I was a bookworm then , but when I came to know it , I woke among the butterflies . To be sure I have given up reading for a good many years — ever since I was made sexton.—There ! I smell Grieg 's Wedding March in the quiver of those rose - petals ! "
8489	8493	8494	8494	I	0	" Mr. Raven , "
8497	8541	8494	8494	I	0	" forgive me for being so rude : I was irritated . Will you kindly show me my way home ? I must go , for I have an appointment with my bailiff . One must not break faith with one 's servants ! "
8542	8553	8554	8554	he	301	" You can not break what was broken days ago ! "
8557	8564	8565	8565	I	0	" Do show me the way , "
8568	8573	8574	8574	he	301	" I can not , "
8577	8597	8574	8574	he	301	" To go back , you must go through yourself , and that way no man can show another . "
8809	8815	8876	8876	he	311	" There is no hurry , "
8825	8861	8876	8876	he	311	" we do not go much by the clock here . Still , the sooner one begins to do what has to be done , the better ! I will take you to my wife . "
8862	8870	8871	8871	I	0	" Thank you . Let us go ! "
8935	8941	8950	8950	his	200	" You see that hawthorn ? "
8968	8982	8983	8983	I	0	" I see a gnarled old man , with a great white head , "
8986	8990	8991	8991	he	200	" Look again , "
8994	9000	8991	8991	he	200	" it is a hawthorn . "
9001	9021	9022	9022	I	0	" It seems indeed an ancient hawthorn ; but this is not the season for the hawthorn to blossom ! "
9025	9034	9035	9035	he	311	" The season for the hawthorn to blossom , "
9038	9084	9035	9035	he	311	" is when the hawthorn blossoms . That tree is in the ruins of the church on your home - farm . You were going to give some directions to the bailiff about its churchyard , were you not , the morning of the thunder ? "
9085	9116	8991	8991	he	200	" I was going to tell him I wanted it turned into a wilderness of rose- trees , and that the plough must never come within three yards of it . "
9117	9120	9122	9123	the raven	233	" Listen ! "
9168	9174	9176	9177	the raven	233	" They go there still , "
9179	9190	9191	9191	I	0	" Who goes there ? and where do they go ? "
9194	9211	9212	9212	he	233	" Some of the people who used to pray there , go to the ruins still , "
9215	9227	9212	9212	he	233	" But they will not go much longer , I think . "
9228	9235	9329	9329	He	233	" What makes them go now ? "
9236	9287	9176	9177	the raven	233	" They need help from each other to get their thinking done , and their feelings hatched , so they talk and sing together ; and then , they say , the big thought floats out of their hearts like a great ship out of the river at high water . "
9288	9298	9212	9212	he	233	" Do they not pray as well as sing ? "
9299	9328	9329	9329	He	233	" No ; they have found that each can best pray in his own silent heart.—Some people are always at their prayers.—Look ! look ! There goes one ! "
9370	9376	9377	9377	I	0	" I see a pigeon ! "
9380	9388	9390	9391	the raven	233	" Of course you see a pigeon , "
9393	9427	9390	9391	the raven	233	" for there is the pigeon ! I see a prayer on its way.—I wonder now what heart is that dove 's mother ! Some one may have come awake in my cemetery ! "
9428	9437	9438	9438	I	0	" How can a pigeon be a prayer ? "
9441	9471	9438	9438	I	0	" I understand , of course , how it should be a fit symbol or likeness for one ; but a live pigeon to come out of a heart ! "
9472	9486	9390	9391	the raven	233	" It must puzzle you ! It can not fail to do so ! "
9487	9498	9499	9499	I	0	" A prayer is a thought , a thing spiritual ! "
9502	9624	9499	9499	I	0	" Very true ! But if you understood any world besides your own , you would understand your own much better.—When a heart is really alive , then it is able to think live things . There is one heart all whose thoughts are strong , happy creatures , and whose very dreams are lives . When some pray , they lift heavy thoughts from the ground , only to drop them on it again ; others send up their prayers in living shapes , this or that , the nearest likeness to each . All live things were thoughts to begin with , and are fit therefore to be used by those that think . When one says to the great Thinker:—"Here
9637	9661	9667	9667	his	320	" that is a prayer — a word to the big heart from one of its own little hearts.—Look , there is another ! "
9758	9766	9768	9769	the raven	233	" That is a prayer - flower , "
9771	9780	9781	9781	I	0	" I never saw such a flower before ! "
9784	9802	9803	9803	he	233	" There is no other such . Not one prayer - flower is ever quite like another , "
9806	9817	9818	9818	I	0	" How do you know it a prayer - flower ? "
9821	9828	9829	9829	he	233	" By the expression of it , "
9832	9860	9829	9829	he	233	" More than that I can not tell you . If you know it , you know it ; if you do not , you do not . "
9861	9878	9879	9879	I	0	" Could you not teach me to know a prayer - flower when I see it ? "
9882	9966	9879	9879	I	0	" I could not . But if I could , what better would you be ? you would not know it of yourself and itself ! Why know the name of a thing when the thing itself you do not know ? Whose work is it but your own to open your eyes ? But indeed the business of the universe is to make such a fool of you that you will know yourself for one , and so begin to be wise ! "
10092	10099	10101	10102	the raven	233	" Here we are at last ! "
10104	10148	10101	10102	the raven	233	" What a long way it is ! In half the time I could have gone to Paradise and seen my cousin — him , you remember , who never came back to Noah ! Dear ! dear ! it is almost winter ! "
10149	10152	10153	10153	I	0	" Winter ! "
10156	10168	10153	10153	I	0	" it seems but half a day since we left home ! "
10169	10179	10181	10182	the raven	233	" That is because we have travelled so fast , "
10184	10238	10101	10102	the raven	233	" In your world you can not pull up the plumb - line you call gravitation , and let the world spin round under your feet ! But here is my wife 's house ! She is very good to let me live with her , and call it the sexton 's cottage ! "
10239	10258	10260	10260	I	0	" But where is your churchyard — your cemetery — where you make your graves , I mean ? "
10830	10838	10840	10841	the raven	233	" Here is Mr. Vane , wife ! "
10843	10848	10849	10849	she	344	" He is welcome , "
10880	10891	10893	10894	the raven	233	" I knew you would be glad to see him ! "
10915	10920	10921	10921	she	344	" Will he sleep ? "
10924	10929	10930	10930	he	33	" I fear not , "
10933	10942	10930	10930	he	33	" he is neither weary nor heavy laden . "
10943	10951	10982	10982	she	344	" Why then have you brought him ? "
10952	10962	10982	10982	she	344	" I have my fears it may prove precipitate . "
10963	10971	10972	10972	I	0	" I do not quite understand you , "
10993	11005	10972	10972	I	0	" Surely a man must do a day 's work first ! "
11028	11035	11036	11036	I	0	" Let me first go home , "
11039	11058	11036	11036	I	0	" and come again after I have found or made , invented , or at least discovered something ! "
11059	11072	11074	11075	the woman	348	" He has not yet learned that the day begins with sleep ! "
11082	11094	11074	11075	the woman	348	" Tell him he must rest before he can do anything ! "
11095	11098	11099	11099	he	350	" Men , "
11102	11134	11099	11099	he	350	" think so much of having done , that they fall asleep upon it . They can not empty an egg but they turn into the shell , and lie down ! "
11270	11279	11280	11280	he	245	" You knew I was not a raven ! "
11286	11294	11280	11280	he	245	" I knew you were Mr. Raven , "
11298	11308	11295	11295	I	0	" but somehow I thought you a bird too ! "
11309	11318	11545	11546	the sexton	357	" What made you think me a bird ? "
11319	11339	11522	11528	The woman , moveless as a statue	356	" You looked a raven , and I saw you dig worms out of the earth with your beak . "
11340	11344	11295	11295	I	0	" And then ? "
11345	11352	11295	11295	I	0	" Toss them in the air . "
11353	11357	11545	11546	the sexton	357	" And then ? "
11358	11367	11522	11528	The woman , moveless as a statue	356	" They grew butterflies , and flew away . "
11368	11386	11295	11295	I	0	" Did you ever see a raven do that ? I told you I was a sexton ! "
11387	11403	11295	11295	I	0	" Does a sexton toss worms in the air , and turn them into butterflies ? "
11404	11407	11545	11546	the sexton	357	" Yes . "
11408	11416	11522	11528	The woman , moveless as a statue	356	" I never saw one do it ! "
11417	11452	11295	11295	I	0	" You saw me do it!—But I am still librarian in your house , for I never was dismissed , and never gave up the office . Now I am librarian here as well . "
11453	11465	11545	11546	the sexton	357	" But you have just told me you were sexton here ! "
11466	11501	11522	11528	The woman , moveless as a statue	356	" So I am . It is much the same profession . Except you are a true sexton , books are but dead bodies to you , and a library nothing but a catacomb ! "
11502	11507	11295	11295	I	0	" You bewilder me ! "
11508	11514	11545	11546	the sexton	357	" That 's all right ! "
11539	11543	11545	11546	the sexton	357	" Upon occasion , "
11550	11662	11663	11663	He	355	" it is more convenient to put one 's bird - self in front . Every one , as you ought to know , has a beast - self — and a bird - self , and a stupid fish - self , ay , and a creeping serpent - self too — which it takes a deal of crushing to kill ! In truth he has also a tree - self and a crystal - self , and I do n't know how many selves more — all to get into harmony . You can tell what sort a man is by his creature that comes oftenest to the front . "
11756	11770	11771	11771	he	355	" We are in want of something to eat and drink , wife , "
11774	11782	11771	11771	he	355	" we have come a long way ! "
11783	11789	11790	11790	she	358	" You know , husband , "
11793	11803	11804	11804	She	358	" we can give only to him that asks . "
11815	11826	11827	11827	I	0	" Please give me something to eat , Mrs. Raven , "
11830	11843	11827	11827	I	0	" and something — what you will — to quench my thirst . "
11844	11859	11860	11860	she	358	" Your thirst must be greater before you can have what will quench it , "
11863	11875	11860	11860	she	358	" but what I can give you , I will gladly . "
11947	11959	11960	11960	I	0	" I have earned neither food nor sleep , Mrs. Raven , "
11963	11990	11960	11960	I	0	" but you have given me the one freely , and now I hope you will give me the other , for I sorely need it . "
11991	12003	12005	12006	the sexton	357	" Sleep is too fine a thing ever to be earned , "
12008	12050	12005	12006	the sexton	357	" it must be given and accepted , for it is a necessity . But it would be perilous to use this house as a half - way hostelry — for the repose of a night , that is , merely . "
12102	12111	12112	12112	he	357	" Here is one of Mara 's kittens ! "
12118	12134	12112	12112	he	357	" will you give it something and put it out ? she may want it ! "
12163	12175	12176	12176	I	0	" How then am I to make use of your hospitality ? "
12179	12187	12188	12188	he	357	" By accepting it to the full , "
12191	12197	12188	12188	he	357	" I do not understand . "
12198	12208	12135	12136	The woman	348	" In this house no one wakes of himself . "
12209	12212	12188	12188	he	357	" Why ? "
12213	12235	12188	12188	he	357	" Because no one anywhere ever wakes of himself . You can wake yourself no more than you can make yourself . "
12236	12248	12249	12249	I	0	" Then perhaps you or Mrs. Raven would kindly call me ! "
12263	12268	12249	12249	I	0	" We can not . "
12269	12278	12279	12279	I	0	" How dare I then go to sleep ? "
12282	12312	12279	12279	I	0	" If you would have the rest of this house , you must not trouble yourself about waking . You must go to sleep heartily , altogether and outright . "
12334	12341	12328	12328	His	357	" Will you not trust me ? "
12350	12354	12342	12342	I	0	" I will . "
12355	12359	12360	12360	he	357	" Then come , "
12363	12371	12360	12360	he	357	" I will show you your couch . "
12520	12525	12511	12511	her	348	" pearl - shell helmet "
12816	12827	12829	12830	Mr. Raven	24	" One of the cellars I am placed to watch ! "
12846	12861	12862	12862	he	24	" Much wine is set here to ripen!—But it is dark for a stranger ! "
12865	12877	12883	12883	her	358	" The moon is rising ; she will soon be here , "
13249	13257	13299	13303	The most beautiful of all	402	" killing care or grief of heart : "
13418	13427	13406	13413	every one that bore such brand of pain	405	" Pardon me : I died only yesterday ! "
13430	13441	13406	13413	every one that bore such brand of pain	405	" Pardon me : I died but a century ago ! "
13577	13587	13589	13590	the sexton	357	" Will you hold the candle nearer , wife ? "
13601	13606	13607	13607	he	357	" It heals well , "
13612	13622	13610	13610	himself	357	" the nail found in her nothing to hurt ! "
13630	13636	13637	13637	I	0	" Are they not dead ? "
13641	13648	13649	13649	he	357	" I can not answer you , "
13656	13698	13699	13699	he	357	" I almost forget what they mean by dead in the old world . If I said a person was dead , my wife would understand one thing , and you would imagine another.—This is but one of my treasure vaults , "
13703	13769	13699	13699	he	357	" and all my guests are not laid in vaults : out there on the moor they lie thick as the leaves of a forest after the first blast of your winter — thick , let me say rather , as if the great white rose of heaven had shed its petals over it . All night the moon reads their faces , and smiles . "
13770	13780	13781	13781	I	0	" But why leave them in the corrupting moonlight ? "
13784	13788	13789	13789	he	357	" Our moon , "
13792	13918	13789	13789	he	357	" is not like yours — the old cinder of a burnt - out world ; her beams embalm the dead , not corrupt them . You observe that here the sexton lays his dead on the earth ; be buries very few under it ! In your world he lays huge stones on them , as if to keep them down ; I watch for the hour to ring the resurrection - bell , and wake those that are still asleep . Your sexton looks at the clock to know when to ring the dead - alive to church ; I hearken for the cock on the spire to crow ; ` Awake , thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead ! ' "
14028	14041	14042	14042	I	0	" You seem in your dead to see differences beyond my perception ! "
14047	14054	14055	14055	he	413	" None of those you see , "
14058	14146	14147	14147	he	413	" are in truth quite dead yet , and some have but just begun to come alive and die . Others had begun to die , that is to come alive , long before they came to us ; and when such are indeed dead , that instant they will wake and leave us . Almost every night some rise and go . But I will not say more , for I find my words only mislead you!—This is the couch that has been waiting for you , "
14157	14162	14163	14163	I	0	" Why just this ? "
14177	14190	14191	14191	he	413	" For reasons which one day you will be glad to know , "
14194	14201	14191	14191	he	413	" Why not know them now ? "
14202	14212	14147	14147	he	413	" That also you will know when you wake . "
14213	14225	14226	14226	I	0	" But these are all dead , and I am alive ! "
14231	14235	14237	14238	the sexton	357	" Not much , "
14243	14264	14237	14238	the sexton	357	" — not nearly enough ! Blessed be the true life that the pauses between its throbs are not death ! "
14265	14276	14277	14277	I	0	" The place is too cold to let one sleep ! "
14280	14287	14288	14288	he	413	" Do these find it so ? "
14291	14362	14363	14364	The sexton	357	" They sleep well — or will soon . Of cold they feel not a breath : it heals their wounds.—Do not be a coward , Mr. Vane . Turn your back on fear , and your face to whatever may come . Give yourself up to the night , and you will rest indeed . Harm will not come to you , but a good you can not foreknow . "
14414	14430	14431	14431	I	0	" Would they have me make of a charnel - house my bed - chamber ? "
14435	14455	14431	14431	I	0	" I will not . I will lie abroad on the heath ; it can not be colder there ! "
14456	14473	14474	14474	I	0	" I have just told you that the dead are there also , said the librarian . "
14478	14517	14474	14474	I	0	" I cried again ; and in the compassing dark , the two gleamed out like spectres that waited on the dead ; neither answered me ; each stood still and sad , and looked at the other . "
14532	14546	14528	14530	the great shepherd	423	" said the sexton to his wife . Then he turned to me . "
14564	14568	14528	14530	the great shepherd	423	" he asked . "
14577	14581	14528	14530	the great shepherd	423	" I answered . "
14585	14595	14528	14530	the great shepherd	423	" he returned , and his voice was stern , "
14630	14940	15312	15312	your	429	" They went farther into the great chamber , and I was left alone in the moonlight with the dead . I turned to escape . What a long way I found it back through the dead ! At first I was too angry to be afraid , but as I grew calm , the still shapes grew terrible . At last , with loud offence to the gracious silence , I ran , I fled wildly , and , bursting out , flung - to the door behind me . It closed with an awful silence . I stood in pitch - darkness . Feeling about me , I found a door , opened it , and was aware of the dim light of a lamp . I stood in my library , with the handle of the masked door in my hand . Had I come to myself out of a vision?—or lost myself by going back to one ? Which was the real — what I now saw , or what I had just ceased to see ? Could both be real , interpenetrating yet unmingling ? I threw myself on a couch , and fell asleep . In the library was one small window to the east , through which , at this time of the year , the first rays of the sun shone upon a mirror whence they were reflected on the masked door : when I woke , there they shone , and thither they drew my eyes . With the feeling that behind it must lie the boundless chamber I had left by that door , I sprang to my feet , and opened it . The light , like an eager hound , shot before me into the closet , and pounced upon the gilded edges of a large book . "
14944	14948	15312	15312	your	429	" I cried , "
14960	14996	15312	15312	your	429	" But the gilded edges , reflecting the light a second time , flung it on a nest of drawers in a dark corner , and I saw that one of them was half open . "
15000	15308	15312	15312	your	429	" I cried , and went to close the drawer . It contained old papers , and seemed more than full , for it would not close . Taking the topmost one out , I perceived that it was in my father 's writing and of some length . The words on which first my eyes fell , at once made me eager to learn what it contained . I carried it to the library , sat down in one of the western windows , and read what follows . I AM filled with awe of what I have to write . The sun is shining golden above me ; the sea lies blue beneath his gaze ; the same world sends its growing things up to the sun , and its flying things into the air which I have breathed from my infancy ; but I know the outspread splendour a passing show , and that at any moment it may , like the drop - scene of a stage , be lifted to reveal more wonderful things . Shortly after my father 's death , I was seated one morning in the library . I had been , somewhat listlessly , regarding the portrait that hangs among the books , which I knew only as that of a distant ancestor , and wishing I could learn something of its original . Then I had taken a book from the shelves and begun to read . Glancing up from it , I saw coming toward me — not between me and the door , but between me and the portrait — a thin pale man in rusty black . He looked sharp and eager , and had a notable nose , at once reminding me of a certain jug my sisters used to call Mr. Crow . "
15327	15339	15318	15318	I	0	" he said , in a peculiar but not disagreeable voice . "
15368	15384	15363	15366	his father 's librarian	434	" It did not strike me at the time how old the man must be . "
15396	15406	15407	15407	You	429	" I said . He smiled an amused smile . "
15413	15417	15407	15407	You	429	" he rejoined , "
15442	15443	15424	15424	You	429	" "
15448	15449	15424	15424	You	429	" "
15463	15496	15458	15459	a child	106	" I could not be sure that I remembered him , but for a moment I fancied I did , and I begged him to set me right as to his name . "
15511	15515	15458	15459	a child	106	" he remarked . "
15532	15547	15530	15530	Raven	24	" I had heard the name , for marvellous tales had brought it me . "
15560	15564	15553	15553	you	0	" I said . "
15571	15578	15566	15566	you	0	" He seated himself at once . "
15589	15590	15593	15593	him	105	" "
15595	15603	15593	15593	him	105	" he answered with a curious smile , "
15621	15630	15617	15617	gentleman	439	" he added , pointing to the portrait , "
15656	15698	15699	15699	I	0	" Then at length I began to think the interview a strange one . But in truth it was hardly stranger that my visitor should remember Sir Upward , than that he should have been my great - grandfather 's librarian ! "
15704	15708	15699	15699	I	0	" he continued ; "
15762	15763	15731	15731	he	105	" "
15773	15777	15765	15765	you	0	" I said . "
15800	15808	15765	15765	you	0	" he answered — and went on . "
16028	16114	16019	16019	I	0	" Many years after , when the tower had long disappeared , I taught one of his descendants what Sir Upward had taught me ; and now and then to this day I use your house when I want to go the nearest way home . I must indeed — without your leave , for which I ask your pardon — have by this time well established a right of way through it — not from front to back , but from bottom to top ! "
16115	16126	16127	16127	I	0	" You would have me then understand , Mr. Raven , "
16130	16146	16127	16127	I	0	" that you go through my house into another world , heedless of disparting space ? "
16147	16160	16162	16164	the old librarian	180	" That I go through it is an incontrovertible acknowledgement of space , "
16166	16175	16176	16176	I	0	" Please do not quibble , Mr. Raven , "

16193	16217	16019	16019	I	0	" There is in your house a door , one step through which carries me into a world very much another than this . "
16218	16222	16127	16127	I	0	" A better ? "
16223	16264	16176	16176	I	0	" Not throughout ; but so much another that most of its physical , and many of its mental laws are different from those of this world . As for moral laws , they must everywhere be fundamentally the same . "
16265	16273	16274	16274	I	0	" You try my power of belief ! "
16277	16287	16274	16274	I	0	" You take me for a madman , probably ? "
16288	16296	16176	16176	I	0	" You do not look like one . "
16297	16302	16176	16176	I	0	" A liar then ? "
16303	16314	16274	16274	I	0	" You give me no ground to think you such . "
16315	16323	16176	16176	I	0	" Only you do not believe me ? "
16324	16348	16176	16176	I	0	" I will go out of that door with you if you like : I believe in you enough to risk the attempt . "
16349	16357	16358	16358	he	457	" The blunder all my children make ! "
16361	16371	16358	16358	he	457	" The only door out is the door in ! "
16410	16414	16415	16415	he	457	" A book , "
16419	16435	16436	16436	he	457	" is a door in , and therefore a door out.—I see old Sir Up'ard , "
16444	16458	16436	16436	he	457	" and my heart swells with love to him:—what world is he in ? "
16459	16466	16467	16467	I	0	" The world of your heart ! "
16470	16482	16436	16436	he	457	" — that is , the idea of him is there . "
16483	16501	16436	16436	he	457	" There is one world then at least on which your hall - door does not open ? "
16502	16524	16436	16436	he	457	" I grant you so much ; but the things in that world are not things to have and to hold . "
16525	16531	16532	16532	he	457	" Think a little farther , "
16535	16579	16532	16532	he	457	" did anything ever become yours , except by getting into that world?—The thought is beyond you , however , at present!—I tell you there are more worlds , and more doors to them , than you will think of in many years ! "
16719	16728	16729	16729	he	457	" That is the door I spoke of , "
16805	16810	16812	16813	the librarian	245	" As a mirror , "
16815	16836	16812	16813	the librarian	245	" it has grown dingy with age ; but that is no matter : its doorness depends on the light . "
16837	16840	16841	16841	I	0	" Light ! "
16844	16851	16841	16841	I	0	" there is no light here ! "
16901	16909	16910	16910	he	457	" We arrive almost to the moment ! "
16913	16923	16910	16910	he	457	" it is on the very stroke of noon ! "
17031	17038	17039	17039	I	0	" Where are the sunrays gone ? "

17054	17083	17084	17084	He	457	" — back , perhaps , to where they came from first . They now belong , I fancy , to a sense not yet developed in us . "
17625	17646	17620	17620	I	0	" I will go and tell them I am ashamed , and will do whatever they would have me do ! "
17771	17777	17778	17778	I	0	" a small pipling wind ! "
17953	17967	17968	17968	I	0	" I beg your pardon , sir , for my rudeness last night , "
17971	17989	17968	17968	I	0	" Will you take me with you now ? I heartily confess I do not deserve it . "
17990	17993	17994	17994	he	502	" Ah ! "
18008	18019	18020	18020	he	502	" My wife does not expect you to - night , "
18023	18036	18020	18020	he	502	" She regrets that we at all encouraged your staying last week . "
18037	18052	18053	18053	I	0	" Take me to her that I may tell her how sorry I am , "
18057	18064	18065	18065	he	502	" It is of no use , "
18068	18181	18065	18065	he	502	" Your night was not come then , or you would not have left us . It is not come now , and I can not show you the way . The dead were rejoicing under their daisies — they all lie among the roots of the flowers of heaven — at the thought of your delight when the winter should be past , and the morning with its birds come : ere you left them , they shivered in their beds . When the spring of the universe arrives,—but that can not be for ages yet ! how many , I do not know — and do not care to know . "
18182	18212	18020	18020	he	502	" Tell me one thing , I beg of you , Mr. Raven : is my father with you ? Have you seen him since he left the world ? "
18213	18241	18020	18020	he	502	" Yes ; he is with us , fast asleep . That was he you saw with his arm on the coverlet , his hand half closed . "
18242	18263	18065	18065	he	502	" Why did you not tell me ? That I should have been so near him , and not know ! "
18264	18272	18274	18275	the raven	233	" And turn your back on him ! "
18277	18289	18274	18275	the raven	233	" I would have lain down at once had I known ! "
18290	18311	18312	18312	he	233	" I doubt it . Had you been ready to lie down , you would have known him!—Old Sir Up'ard , "
18316	18369	18312	18312	he	233	" and your twice great - grandfather , both are up and away long ago . Your great - grandfather has been with us for many a year ; I think he will soon begin to stir . You saw him last night , though of course you did not know him . "
18370	18375	18274	18275	the raven	233	" Why of course ? "
18376	18397	18274	18275	the raven	233	" Because he is so much nearer waking than you . No one who will not sleep can ever wake . "
18398	18407	18312	18312	he	233	" I do not at all understand you ! "
18408	18418	18274	18275	the raven	233	" You turned away , and would not understand ! "
18434	18445	18446	18446	I	0	" And my grandfather — is he also with you ? "
18449	18464	18446	18446	I	0	" No ; he is still in the Evil Wood , fighting the dead . "
18465	18478	18312	18312	he	233	" Where is the Evil Wood , that I may find him ? "
18479	18518	18274	18275	the raven	233	" You will not find him ; but you will hardly miss the wood . It is the place where those who will not sleep , wake up at night , to kill their dead and bury them . "
18519	18526	18446	18446	I	0	" I can not understand you ! "
18527	18577	18312	18312	he	233	" Naturally not . Neither do I understand you ; I can read neither your heart nor your face . When my wife and I do not understand our children , it is because there is not enough of them to be understood . God alone can understand foolishness . "
18578	18581	18582	18582	I	0	" Then , "
18591	18623	18582	18582	I	0	" will you be so good as show me the nearest way home ? There are more ways than one , I know , for I have gone by two already . "
18624	18631	18312	18312	he	233	" There are indeed many ways . "
18632	18644	18312	18312	he	233	" Tell me , please , how to recognise the nearest . "
18645	18650	18652	18653	the raven	233	" I can not , "
18655	18798	18652	18653	the raven	233	" you and I use the same words with different meanings . We are often unable to tell people what they need to know , because they want to know something else , and would therefore only misunderstand what we said . Home is ever so far away in the palm of your hand , and how to get there it is of no use to tell you . But you will get there ; you must get there ; you have to get there . Everybody who is not at home , has to go home . You thought you were at home where I found you : if that had been your home , you could not have left it . Nobody can leave home . And nobody ever was or ever will be at home without having gone there . "
18799	18805	18806	18806	I	0	" Enigma treading on enigma ! "
18809	18820	18806	18806	I	0	" I did not come here to be asked riddles . "
18821	18860	18652	18653	the raven	233	" No ; but you came , and found the riddles waiting for you ! Indeed you are yourself the only riddle . What you call riddles are truths , and seem riddles because you are not true . "
18861	18866	18867	18867	I	0	" Worse and worse ! "
18870	18878	18879	18879	he	506	" And you must answer the riddles ! "
18882	18914	18879	18879	he	506	" They will go on asking themselves until you understand yourself . The universe is a riddle trying to get out , and you are holding your door hard against it . "
18915	18934	18652	18653	the raven	233	" Will you not in pity tell me what I am to do — where I must go ? "
18935	18951	18994	18994	his	507	" How should I tell your to - do , or the way to it ? "
18952	18971	18879	18879	he	506	" If I am not to go home , at least direct me to some of my kind . "
18972	18990	18991	18991	He	507	" I do not know of any . The beings most like you are in that direction . "
19010	19013	19014	19014	I	0	" Well , "
19018	19055	19014	19014	I	0	" I can not help feeling hardly treated — taken from my home , abandoned in a strange world , and refused instruction as to where I am to go or what I am to do ! "
19056	19060	19062	19063	the raven	233	" You forget , "
19065	19097	19098	19098	He	233	" that , when I brought you and you declined my hospitality , you reached what you call home in safety : now you are come of yourself ! Good night . "

25281	25298	25274	25279	the girl who had freed me	642	" a crush of one of their horrid stumpy feet might kill a very little one ! "

26595	26602	26603	26603	she	676	" No mother would do that , "
26606	26617	26603	26603	she	676	" I should n't be fit to have a baby ! "

27375	27406	27407	27407	She	696	" Is there always the same number of the giants then ? I thought , before I had time to know better , that they were your fathers and mothers . "
27417	27428	27407	27407	She	696	" No , good giant ; we are their firsters . "
27458	27464	27465	27465	I	0	" How can that be ? "
27468	27479	27480	27480	she	696	" I do not say ; I do not understand , "
27483	27514	27480	27480	she	696	" But we were here and they not . They go from us . I am sorry , but we can not help it . They could have helped it . "
27515	27523	27524	27524	I	0	" How long have you been here ? "
27544	27550	27551	27551	she	696	" Always , I think , "
27554	27562	27551	27551	she	696	" I think somebody made us always . "
27576	27584	27585	27585	she	696	" The giants were not made always , "
27588	27678	27585	27585	she	696	" If a Little One does n't care , he grows greedy , and then lazy , and then big , and then stupid , and then bad . The dull creatures do n't know that they come from us . Very few of them believe we are anywhere . They say Nonsense!—Look at little Blunty : he is eating one of their apples ! He will be the next ! Oh ! oh ! he will soon be big and bad and ugly , and not know it ! "
27718	27728	27729	27729	I	0	" I will take the horrid thing from him ! "
27732	27738	27739	27739	she	699	" It is no use , "
27743	27816	27739	27739	she	699	" We have done all we can , and it is too late ! We were afraid he was growing , for he would not believe anything told him ; but when he refused to share his berries , and said he had gathered them for himself , then we knew it ! He is a glutton , and there is no hope of him.—It makes me sick to see him eat ! "
27817	27836	27739	27739	she	699	" Could not some of the boys watch him , and not let him touch the poisonous things ? "
27837	27903	27739	27739	she	699	" He may have them if he will : it is all one — to eat the apples , and to be a boy that would eat them if he could . No ; he must go to the giants ! He belongs to them . You can see how much bigger he is than when first you came ! He is bigger since yesterday . "
27904	27921	27739	27739	she	699	" He is as like that hideous green lump in his hand as boy could look ! "
27922	27931	27739	27739	she	699	" It suits what he is making himself . "
27932	27941	27739	27739	she	699	" His head and it might change places ! "
27942	27947	27739	27739	she	699	" Perhaps they do ! "
27948	27957	27739	27739	she	699	" Does he want to be a giant ? "
27958	27997	27739	27739	she	699	" He hates the giants , but he is making himself one all the same : he likes their apples ! Oh baby , baby , he was just such a darling as you when we found him ! "
27998	28011	27739	27739	she	699	" He will be very miserable when he finds himself a giant ! "
28012	28031	27739	27739	she	699	" Oh , no ; he will like it well enough ! That is the worst of it . "
28032	28040	27739	27739	she	699	" Will he hate the Little Ones ? "
28041	28076	27739	27739	she	699	" He will be like the rest ; he will not remember us — most likely will not believe there are Little Ones . He will not care ; he will eat his apples . "
28077	28104	27739	27739	she	699	" Do tell me how it will come about . I understand your world so little ! I come from a world where everything is different . "
28105	28131	27739	27739	she	699	" I do not know about world . What is it ? What more but a word in your beautiful big mouth?—That makes it something ! "
28132	28148	27739	27739	she	699	" Never mind about the word ; tell me what next will happen to Blunty . "
28149	28267	27739	27739	she	699	" He will wake one morning and find himself a giant — not like you , good giant , but like any other bad giant . You will hardly know him , but I will tell you which . He will think he has been a giant always , and will not know you , or any of us . The giants have lost themselves , Peony says , and that is why they never smile . I wonder whether they are not glad because they are bad , or bad because they are not glad . But they ca n't be glad when they have no babies ! I wonder what bad means , good giant ! "
28268	28280	27739	27739	she	699	" I wish I knew no more about it than you ! "
28284	28299	28281	28281	I	0	" But I try to be good , and mean to keep on trying . "
28300	28315	27739	27739	she	699	" So do I — and that is how I know you are good . "
28321	28336	28337	28337	I	0	" Then you do not know where the babies come from into the wood ? "
28345	28353	28354	28354	she	700	" There is nothing to know there , "
28357	28368	28354	28354	she	700	" They are in the wood ; they grow there . "
28369	28384	28385	28385	I	0	" Then how is it you never find one before it is quite grown ? "
28398	28408	28409	28409	she	700	" They 're not there till they 're finished , "
28412	28433	28434	28434	I	0	" It is a pity the little sillies ca n't speak till they 've forgotten everything they had to tell ! "
28437	28534	28434	28434	I	0	" Little Tolma , the last before this baby , looked as if she had something to tell , when I found her under a beech - tree , sucking her thumb , but she had n't . She only looked up at me — oh , so sweetly ! She will never go bad and grow big ! When they begin to grow big they care for nothing but bigness ; and when they can not grow any bigger , they try to grow fatter . The bad giants are very proud of being fat . "
28535	28543	28544	28544	I	0	" So they are in my world , "
28547	28560	28544	28544	I	0	" only they do not say fat there , they say rich . "
28561	28568	28570	28570	Lona	44	" In one of their houses , "
28572	28630	28570	28570	Lona	44	" sits the biggest and fattest of them — so proud that nobody can see him ; and the giants go to his house at certain times , and call out to him , and tell him how fat he is , and beg him to make them strong to eat more and grow fat like him . "
28674	28698	28667	28667	Lona	44	" Look ! look there — by that quince - tree : that is the giant that was Blunty!—Would you have known him ? "
28699	28702	28703	28703	I	0	" Never , "
28706	28731	28703	28703	I	0	" — But now you tell me , I could fancy it might be Blunty staring through a fog ! He does look stupid ! "
28732	28742	28743	28743	she	44	" He is for ever eating those apples now ! "
28746	28760	28743	28743	she	44	" That is what comes of Little Ones that wo n't be little ! "
28761	28772	28773	28773	I	0	" They call it growing - up in my world ! "
28778	28805	28773	28773	I	0	" If only she would teach me to grow the other way , and become a Little One!—Shall I ever be able to laugh like them ? "
29161	29164	29169	29169	his	709	" good giant "
29515	29522	29523	29523	they	47	" Take care , good giant ! "
29589	29599	29586	29586	they	2965	" such a many bumps of big apples and stones "
29777	29786	29787	29787	they	725	" You must go away , good giant , "
29790	29806	29787	29787	they	725	" When the bad giants see you hurt , they will all trample on you . "
29807	29813	29814	29814	I	0	" I think I must , "
29817	29827	29828	29828	they	725	" Go and grow strong , and come again , "
29831	29835	29828	29828	they	725	" I will , "
29843	29851	29853	29853	Lona	44	" Indeed you must go at once ! "
29867	29874	29876	29880	one of the bigger boys	726	" I listened at his door , "
29882	29940	29876	29880	one of the bigger boys	726	" and heard the bad giant say to his wife that he had found you idle , talking to a lot of moles and squirrels , and when he beat you , they tried to kill him . He said you were a wizard , and they must knock you , or they would have no peace . "
29941	29948	29949	29949	I	0	" I will go at once , "
29952	29973	29949	29949	I	0	" and come back as soon as I have found out what is wanted to make you bigger and stronger . "
29974	29983	29984	29984	they	728	" We do n't want to be bigger , "
29991	30010	29984	29984	they	728	" We wo n't grow bad giants!—We are strong now ; you do n't know how much strong ! "
30080	30085	30086	30086	they	728	" You are broken , "
30089	30104	30086	30086	they	728	" and much red juice has run out of you : put some in . "
30129	30145	30147	30147	Lona	44	" She has come to take care of you , and show you the way , "
30294	30321	30290	30290	they	728	" No , no ! she will kill you , good giant ; she will kill you ! She is an awful bad - giant witch ! "
30379	30389	30390	30390	they	728	" The moon will tell you , we think , "
30422	30434	30435	30435	they	728	" We have never gone so far from our trees before , "
30438	30461	30435	30435	they	728	" Now mind you watch how you go , that you may see inside your eyes how to come back to us . "
30462	30476	30478	30482	one of the bigger girls	636	" And beware of the giant - woman that lives in the desert , "
30488	30497	30478	30482	one of the bigger girls	636	" I suppose you have heard of her ! "
30498	30501	30502	30502	I	0	" No , "
30505	30531	30502	30502	I	0	" Then take care not to go near her . She is called the Cat - woman . She is awfully ugly — and scratches . "
30586	30596	30570	30570	Lona	44	" The Cat - woman will not hurt you , "
30729	30736	30726	30726	they	728	" But that would be to not ourselves!"—so
31185	31193	31202	31203	a woman	344	" Will you not come with me ? "
31214	31219	31220	31220	I	0	" I thank you , "
31223	31246	31220	31220	I	0	" but I am not uncomfortable here . Where would you have me go ? I like sleeping in the open air . "
31247	31256	31202	31203	a woman	344	" There is no hurt in the air , "
31260	31286	31257	31257	she	344	" but the creatures that roam the night in these parts are not such as a man would willingly have about him while he sleeps . "
31287	31294	31295	31295	I	0	" I have not been disturbed , "
31298	31313	31295	31295	I	0	" No ; I have been sitting by you ever since you lay down . "
31314	31339	31257	31257	she	344	" That is very kind of you ! How came you to know I was here ? Why do you show me such favour ? "
31340	31345	31346	31346	she	344	" I saw you , "
31356	31459	31346	31346	she	344	" in the light of the moon , just as she went down . I see badly in the day , but at night perfectly . The shadow of my house would have hidden you , but both its doors were open . I was out on the waste , and saw you go into this hollow . You were asleep , however , before I could reach you , and I was not willing to disturb you . People are frightened if I come on them suddenly . They call me the Cat - woman . It is not my name . "
31499	31508	31509	31509	I	0	" You shall not hear it from me , "
31512	31522	31509	31509	I	0	" Please tell me what I may call you ! "
31523	31542	31543	31543	she	782	" When you know me , call me by the name that seems to you to fit me , "
31546	31573	31543	31543	she	782	" that will tell me what sort you are . People do not often give me the right one . It is well when they do . "
31574	31594	31509	31509	I	0	" I suppose , madam , you live in the cottage I saw in the heart of the moon ? "
31595	31635	31636	31636	Her	784	" I do . I live there alone , except when I have visitors . It is a poor place , but I do what I can for my guests , and sometimes their sleep is sweet to them . "
31649	31658	31659	31659	I	0	" I will go with you , madam , "
31848	31856	31857	31857	I	0	" I want to find my way , "
31860	31885	31857	31857	I	0	" to a place I have heard of , but whose name I have not yet learned . Perhaps you can tell it me ! "
31886	31913	31843	31843	I	0	" Describe it , then , and I will direct you . The stupid Bags know nothing , and the careless little Lovers forget almost everything . "
31914	31920	31857	31857	I	0	" Where do those live ? "
31921	31929	31857	31857	I	0	" You are just come from them ! "
31930	31938	31843	31843	I	0	" I never heard those names before ! "
31939	31953	31857	31857	I	0	" You would not hear them . Neither people knows its own name ! "
31954	31957	31857	31857	I	0	" Strange ! "
31958	31991	31992	31992	I	0	" Perhaps so ! but hardly any one anywhere knows his own name ! It would make many a fine gentleman stare to hear himself addressed by what is really his name ! "
32006	32014	32015	32015	she	787	" What now do you fancy yours ? "
32026	32040	32015	32015	she	787	" But , pardon me , it is a matter of no consequence . "
32090	32094	32095	32095	she	787	" Never mind , "
32098	32154	32095	32095	she	787	" it is not wanted . Your real name , indeed , is written on your forehead , but at present it whirls about so irregularly that nobody can read it . I will do my part to steady it . Soon it will go slower , and , I hope , settle at last . "
32184	32191	32192	32192	I	0	" The Little Ones told me , "
32197	32209	32192	32192	I	0	" of a smooth green country , pleasant to the feet ! "
32210	32213	32214	32214	she	787	" Yes ? "
32217	32237	32192	32192	I	0	" They told me too of a girl - giantess that was queen somewhere : is that her country ? "
32238	32248	32249	32249	she	787	" There is a city in that grassy land , "
32252	32727	32249	32249	she	787	" where a woman is princess . The city is called Bulika . But certainly the princess is not a girl ! She is older than this world , and came to it from yours — with a terrible history , which is not over yet . She is an evil person , and prevails much with the Prince of the Power of the Air . The people of Bulika were formerly simple folk , tilling the ground and pasturing sheep . She came among them , and they received her hospitably . She taught them to dig for diamonds and opals and sell them to strangers , and made them give up tillage and pasturage and build a city . One day they found a huge snake and killed it ; which so enraged her that she declared herself their princess , and became terrible to them . The name of the country at that time was The Land of Waters ; for the dry channels , of which you have crossed so many , were then overflowing with live torrents ; and the valley , where now the Bags and the Lovers have their fruit - trees , was a lake that received a great part of them . But the wicked princess gathered up in her lap what she could of the water over the whole country , closed it in an egg , and carried it away . Her lap , however , would not hold more than half of it ; and the instant she was gone , what she had not yet taken fled away underground , leaving the country as dry and dusty as her own heart . Were it not for the waters under it , every living thing would long ago have perished from it . For where no water is , no rain falls ; and where no rain falls , no springs rise . Ever since then , the princess has lived in Bulika , holding the inhabitants in constant terror , and doing what she can to keep them from multiplying . Yet they boast and believe themselves a prosperous , and certainly are a self - satisfied people — good at bargaining and buying , good at selling and cheating ; holding well together for a common interest , and utterly treacherous where interests clash ; proud of their princess and her power , and despising every one they get the better of ; never doubting themselves the most honourable of all the nations , and each man counting himself better than any other . The depth of their worthlessness and height of their vainglory no one can understand who has not been there to see , who has not learned to know the miserable misgoverned and self - deceived creatures . "
32728	32792	33178	33178	her	348	" I thank you , madam . And now , if you please , will you tell me something about the Little Ones — the Lovers ? I long heartily to serve them . Who and what are they ? and how do they come to be there ? Those children are the greatest wonder I have found in this world of wonders . "
32793	32868	32249	32249	she	787	" In Bulika you may , perhaps , get some light on those matters . There is an ancient poem in the library of the palace , I am told , which of course no one there can read , but in which it is plainly written that after the Lovers have gone through great troubles and learned their own name , they will fill the land , and make the giants their slaves . "
32869	32884	32885	32885	I	0	" By that time they will have grown a little , will they not ? "
32888	32939	32885	32885	I	0	" Yes , they will have grown ; yet I think too they will not have grown . It is possible to grow and not to grow , to grow less and to grow bigger , both at once — yes , even to grow by means of not growing ! "
32940	32948	32949	32949	I	0	" Your words are strange , madam ! "
32952	32973	32949	32949	I	0	" But I have heard it said that some words , because they mean more , appear to mean less ! "
32974	33024	32885	32885	I	0	" That is true , and such words have to be understood . It were well for the princess of Bulika if she heard what the very silence of the land is shouting in her ears all day long ! But she is far too clever to understand anything . "
33025	33044	32885	32885	I	0	" Then I suppose , when the little Lovers are grown , their land will have water again ? "
33045	33088	32949	32949	I	0	" Not exactly so : when they are thirsty enough , they will have water , and when they have water , they will grow . To grow , they must have water . And , beneath , it is flowing still . "
33089	33097	33098	33098	I	0	" I have heard that water twice , "
33101	33150	33098	33098	I	0	" — once when I lay down to wait for the moon — and when I woke the sun was shining ! and once when I fell , all but killed by the bad giant . Both times came the voices of the water , and healed me . "
33374	33383	33384	33384	she	780	" You are very welcome , Mr. Vane ! "
33396	33444	33384	33384	she	780	" Your entertainment will be scanty , but , as the night is not far spent , and the day not at hand , it is better you should be indoors . Here you will be safe , and a little lack is not a great misery . "
33445	33453	33454	33454	I	0	" I thank you heartily , madam , "
33457	33478	33454	33454	I	0	" But , seeing you know the name I could not tell you , may I not now know yours ? "
33479	33485	33486	33486	she	780	" My name is Mara , "
33500	33504	33505	33505	she	780	" Some people , "
33509	33540	33505	33505	she	780	" take me for Lot 's wife , lamenting over Sodom ; and some think I am Rachel , weeping for her children ; but I am neither of those . "
33541	33549	33550	33550	I	0	" I thank you again , Mara , "
33553	33566	33550	33550	I	0	" — May I lie here on your floor till the morning ? "
33567	33575	33576	33576	she	780	" At the top of that stair , "
33579	33635	33576	33576	she	780	" you will find a bed — on which some have slept better than they expected , and some have waked all the night and slept all the next day . It is not a very soft one , but it is better than the sand — and there are no hyenas sniffing about it ! "
33732	33741	33742	33743	my hostess	780	" I must leave you in the dark , "

33787	33809	33784	33784	I	0	" To eat and drink , to lie down and sleep , are things that can be done in the dark . "

34461	34468	34442	34442	she	780	" How wonderfully intelligent she looked ! "
34469	34483	34484	34484	she	780	" Astarte knows her work well enough to be sent to do it , "
34487	34495	34442	34442	she	780	" Have you many messengers like her ? "
34496	34503	34442	34442	she	780	" As many as I require . "
34504	34511	34442	34442	she	780	" Are they hard to teach ? "
34512	34548	34442	34442	she	780	" They need no teaching . They are all of a certain breed , but not one of the breed is like another . Their origin is so natural it would seem to you incredible . "
34549	34556	34442	34442	she	780	" May I not know it ? "
34557	34574	34575	34575	I	0	" A new one came to me last night — from your head while you slept . "

39034	39050	39025	39026	the other	2867	" You would do nothing to help me , and this cursed knee is out ! "
39051	39060	39025	39026	the other	2867	" I did my best , my lord . "
39061	39096	39097	39097	She	948	" No doubt , my lady , for it was bad ! I thought I should never find my feet again!—But , bless my soul , madam ! are you out in your bones ? "
39104	39114	39115	39115	she	948	" I have nothing else to be out in , "
39118	39140	39115	39115	she	948	" — and you at least can not complain ! But what on earth does it mean ? Am I dreaming ? "
39141	39226	39025	39026	the other	2867	" You may be dreaming , madam — I can not tell ; but this knee of mine forbids me the grateful illusion.—Ha ! I too , I perceive , have nothing to walk in but bones!—Not so unbecoming to a man , however ! I trust to goodness they are not my bones ! every one aches worse than another , and this loose knee worst of all ! The bed must have been damp — and I too drunk to know it ! "
39227	39235	39025	39026	the other	2867	" Probably , my lord of Cokayne ! "
39236	39331	39025	39026	the other	2867	" What ! what!—You make me think I too am dreaming — aches and all ! How do you know the title my roistering bullies give me ? I do n't remember you!—Anyhow , you have no right to take liberties ! My name is — I am lord —— tut , tut ! What do you call me when I'm — I mean when you are sober ? I cannot — at the moment,—Why , what is my name?—I must have been very drunk when I went to bed ! I often am ! "
39332	39358	39025	39026	the other	2867	" You come so seldom to mine , that I do not know , my lord ; but I may take your word for that ! "
39359	39364	39025	39026	the other	2867	" I hope so ! "
39365	39372	39025	39026	the other	2867	" — if for nothing else ! "
39373	39387	39025	39026	the other	2867	" Hoity toity ! I never told you a lie in my life ! "
39388	39397	39025	39026	the other	2867	" You never told me anything but lies . "
39398	39410	39025	39026	the other	2867	" Upon my honour!—Why , I never saw the woman before ! "
39411	39424	39025	39026	the other	2867	" You knew me well enough to lie to , my lord ! "
39425	39490	39025	39026	the other	2867	" I do seem to begin to dream I have met you before , but , upon my oath , there is nothing to know you by ! Out of your clothes , who is to tell who you may not be?—One thing I may swear — that I never saw you so much undressed before!—By heaven , I have no recollection of you ! "
39491	39512	39513	39513	She	949	" I am glad to hear it : my recollections of you are the less distasteful!—Good morning , my lord ! "
39529	39566	39567	39567	He	950	" You are just as heartless as — as — any other woman , madam!—Where in this hell of a place shall I find my valet?—What was the cursed name I used to call the fool ? "
39589	39601	39603	39604	the lady	951	" I will be your valet for once , my lord , "
39612	39628	39603	39604	the lady	951	" — What can I do for you ? It is not easy to tell ! "
39629	39657	39658	39658	She	951	" Tie my leg on , of course , you fool ! Ca n't you see it is all but off ? Heigho , my dancing days ! "
39703	39714	39715	39715	she	951	" You used to stamp rather differently , my lord ! "
39725	39745	39715	39715	she	951	" Eh ? what!—Now I look at you again , it seems to me I used to hate you!—Eh ? "
39746	39767	39694	39694	he	950	" Naturally , my lord ! You hated a good many people!—your wife , of course , among the rest ! "
39768	39812	39694	39694	he	950	" Ah , I begin , I be - gin — — But — I must have been a long time somewhere!—I really forget!—There ! your damned , miserable bit of grass is breaking!—We used to get on pretty well together — eh ? "
39813	39841	39715	39715	she	951	" Not that I remember , my lord . The only happy moments I had in your company were scattered over the first week of our marriage . "
39842	39862	39715	39715	she	951	" Was that the way of it ? Ha ! ha!—Well , it 's over now , thank goodness ! "
39863	39885	39694	39694	he	950	" I wish I could believe it ! Why were we sitting there in that carriage together ? It wakes apprehension ! "
39886	39896	39715	39715	she	951	" I think we were divorced , my lady ! "
39897	39906	39715	39715	she	951	" Hardly enough : we are still together ! "
39907	39924	39715	39715	she	951	" A sad truth , but capable of remedy : the forest seems of some extent ! "
39925	39932	39694	39694	he	950	" I doubt ! I doubt ! "
39933	40048	39715	39715	she	951	" I am sorry I can not think of a compliment to pay you — without lying , that is . To judge by your figure and complexion you have lived hard since I saw you last ! I can not surely be quite so naked as your ladyship!—I beg your pardon , madam ! I trust you will take it I am but jesting in a dream ! It is of no consequence , however ; dreaming or waking , all 's one — all merest appearance ! You ca n't be certain of anything , and that 's as good as knowing there is nothing ! Life may teach any fool that ! "
40049	40062	39715	39715	she	951	" It has taught me the fool I was to love you ! "
40063	40093	39715	39715	she	951	" You were not the only fool to do that ! Women had a trick of falling in love with me:—I had forgotten that you were one of them ! "
40094	40110	39715	39715	she	951	" I did love you , my lord — a little — at one time ! "
40111	40182	39715	39715	she	951	" Ah , there was your mistake , my lady ! You should have loved me much , loved me devotedly , loved me savagely — loved me eternally ! Then I should have tired of you the sooner , and not hated you so much afterward!—But let bygones be bygones!—Where are we ? Locality is the question ! To be or not to be , is not the question ! "
40183	40194	39715	39715	she	951	" We are in the other world , I presume ! "
40195	40212	39715	39715	she	951	" Granted!—but in which or what sort of other world ? This ca n't be hell ! "
40213	40232	39715	39715	she	951	" It must : there 's marriage in it ! You and I are damned in each other . "
40233	40254	39715	39715	she	951	" Then I 'm not like Othello , damned in a fair wife!—Oh , I remember my Shakspeare , madam ! "
40282	40289	40291	40293	her late husband	953	" Give that stick to me , "
40295	40303	40304	40304	She	952	" I want it more than you . "
40310	40320	40304	40304	She	952	" You mean to make me beg for it ? "
40321	40335	40336	40336	she	952	" Not at all , my lord . I mean to keep it , "
40344	40361	40340	40340	her	952	" Give it me at once ; I mean to have it ! I require it . "
40362	40372	40374	40375	the lady	951	" Unfortunately , I think I require it myself ! "
40424	40432	40433	40433	he	953	" Come and tie it up properly ! "
40452	40460	40461	40461	he	953	" Come and tie it up instantly ! "
40474	40483	40484	40484	he	953	" I swear I will not touch you ! "
40487	40542	40484	40484	he	953	" Swear on , my lord ! there is no one here to believe you . But , pray , do not lose your temper , or you will shake yourself to pieces , and where to find string enough to tie up all your crazy joints , is more than I can tell . "
40609	40612	40613	40613	he	953	" Disgusting ! "
40626	40632	40633	40633	she	951	" You will break it ! "
40642	40648	40649	40649	he	953	" I will , then ! "
40659	40674	40675	40675	she	951	" I shall not tie your leg again the next time it comes loose ! "
40707	40717	40718	40718	he	953	" That 's right : reach me the stick ! "
40751	40761	40762	40762	she	951	" Now you will have to wear splints always ! "
40765	40772	40762	40762	she	951	" such dry bones never mend ! "
40773	40777	40778	40778	he	953	" You devil ! "
40781	40808	40809	40809	He	953	" At your service , my lord ! Shall I fetch you a couple of wheel - spokes ? Neat — but heavy , I fear ! "
40853	40860	40861	40861	I	0	" What can come of it ? "
40866	40909	40861	40861	I	0	" These are too wretched for any world , and this can not be hell , for the Little Ones are in it , and the sleepers too ! What can it all mean ? Can things ever come right for skeletons ? "
40910	40932	40950	40951	the speaker	957	" There are words too big for you and me : all is one of them , and ever is another , "
40953	40960	40950	40951	the speaker	957	" You are not in hell , "
40964	40978	40980	40980	he	953	" Neither am I in hell . But those skeletons are in hell ! "
41031	41039	41040	41040	he	953	" The male was never a gentleman , "
41044	41105	41040	41040	he	953	" and in the bony stage of retrogression , with his skeleton through his skin , and his character outside his manners , does not look like one . The female is less vulgar , and has a little heart . But , the restraints of society removed , you see them now just as they are and always were ! "
41106	41119	41120	41120	I	0	" Tell me , Mr. Raven , what will become of them , "
41123	41128	41129	41129	he	953	" We shall see , "
41132	41302	41129	41129	he	953	" In their day they were the handsomest couple at court ; and now , even in their dry bones , they seem to regard their former repute as an inalienable possession ; to see their faces , however , may yet do something for them ! They felt themselves rich too while they had pockets , but they have already begun to feel rather pinched ! My lord used to regard my lady as a worthless encumbrance , for he was tired of her beauty and had spent her money ; now he needs her to cobble his joints for him ! These changes have roots of hope in them . Besides , they can not now get far away from each other , and they see none else of their own kind : they must at last grow weary of their mutual repugnance , and begin to love one another ! for love , not hate , is deepest in what Love ` loved into being . ' "
41303	41321	41322	41322	I	0	" I saw many more of their kind an hour ago , in the hall close by ! "
41325	41336	41337	41337	he	959	" Of their kind , but not of their sort , "
41340	41446	41337	41337	he	959	" For many years these will see none such as you saw last night . Those are centuries in advance of these . You saw that those could even dress themselves a little ! It is true they can not yet retain their clothes so long as they would — only , at present , for a part of the night ; but they are pretty steadily growing more capable , and will by and by develop faces ; for every grain of truthfulness adds a fibre to the show of their humanity . Nothing but truth can appear ; and whatever is must seem . "
41447	41455	41456	41456	I	0	" Are they upheld by this hope ? "
41459	41487	41456	41456	I	0	" They are upheld by hope , but they do not in the least know their hope ; to understand it , is yet immeasurably beyond them , "
41515	41525	41526	41526	I	0	" Did you come to find me , sir ? "
41529	41534	41535	41535	he	959	" Not at all , "
41538	41555	41535	41535	he	959	" I have no anxiety about you . Such as you always come back to us . "
41556	41568	41569	41569	I	0	" Tell me , please , who am I such as ? "
41572	41584	41585	41585	he	959	" I can not make my friend the subject of conversation , "
41592	41600	41601	41601	I	0	" But when that friend is present ! "
41604	41611	41612	41612	he	959	" I decline the more strongly , "
41615	41623	41624	41624	I	0	" But when that friend asks you ! "
41627	41634	41635	41635	he	959	" Then most positively I refuse , "
41638	41641	41635	41635	he	959	" Why ? "
41642	41675	41679	41679	his	959	" Because he and I would be talking of two persons as if they were one and the same . Your consciousness of yourself and my knowledge of you are far apart ! "
41725	41754	41718	41718	he	959	" In this world never trust a person who has once deceived you . Above all , never do anything such a one may ask you to do . "
41755	41762	41763	41763	I	0	" I will try to remember , "
41766	41773	41763	41763	I	0	" — but I may forget ! "
41774	41786	41718	41718	he	959	" Then some evil that is good for you will follow . "
41787	41793	41718	41718	he	959	" And if I remember ? "
41794	41808	41809	41811	The old man	961	" Some evil that is not good for you , will not follow . "
41906	41915	41916	41916	she	963	" Is this going to last for ever ? "
42047	42051	42052	42052	I	0	" Another skeleton ! "
42812	42815	42816	42816	I	0	" Doubt , "
42821	42841	42816	42816	I	0	" may be a poor encouragement to do anything , but it is a bad reason for doing nothing . "

46771	46775	46776	46776	I	0	" How big ? "
46785	46797	46798	46798	she	1056	" Not far from six feet long , I should think , "
46801	46822	46823	46823	I	0	" You have saved my life , perhaps!—But how could you touch the horrid thing ! How brave of you ! "
46826	46830	46833	46833	her	1056	" I did ! "
46842	46856	46839	46839	she	1056	" Where is it ? What could you do with such a monster ? "
46857	46865	46833	46833	her	1056	" I threw it in the river . "
46866	46876	46839	46839	she	1056	" Then it will come again , I fear ! "
46877	46945	46839	46839	she	1056	" I do not think I could have killed it , even had I known how!—I heard you moaning , and got up to see what disturbed you ; saw the frightful thing at your neck , and pulled it away . But I could not hold it , and was hardly able to throw it from me . I only heard it splash in the water ! "
46946	46954	46955	46955	I	0	" We 'll kill it next time ! "
47059	47065	47066	47066	I	0	" We must be going ! "

47089	47096	47097	47097	she	951	" Did you find me there ? "
47105	47113	47114	47114	I	0	" No ; I brought you there , "
47117	47122	47097	47097	she	951	" You brought me ? "
47123	47126	47066	47066	I	0	" Yes . "
47127	47131	47066	47066	I	0	" From where ? "
47132	47137	47097	47097	she	951	" From the forest . "
47138	47151	47066	47066	I	0	" What have you done with my clothes — and my jewels ? "
47152	47161	47066	47066	I	0	" You had none when I found you . "
47162	47171	47097	47097	she	951	" Then why did you not leave me ? "
47172	47181	47066	47066	I	0	" Because I hoped you were not dead . "
47182	47189	47066	47066	I	0	" Why should you have cared ? "
47190	47203	47097	47097	she	951	" Because I was very lonely , and wanted you to live . "
47204	47215	47216	47216	she	1059	" You would have kept me enchanted for my beauty ! "
47232	47241	47242	47242	I	0	" There was no beauty left in you , "
47245	47259	47242	47242	I	0	" Why , then , again , did you not let me alone ? "
47260	47269	47097	47097	she	951	" Because you were of my own kind . "
47270	47275	47276	47276	she	1059	" Of your kind ? "
47286	47297	47276	47276	she	1059	" I thought so , but find I was mistaken ! "
47298	47304	47097	47097	she	951	" Doubtless you pitied me ! "
47305	47321	47334	47334	she	1059	" Never had woman more claim on pity , or less on any other feeling ! "
47374	47388	47389	47389	she	1059	" Had you failed to rouse me , what would you have done ? "
47395	47402	47389	47389	she	1059	" I would have buried it . "
47403	47412	47413	47413	she	1059	" It ! What?—You would have buried this ? "
47439	47461	47413	47413	she	1059	" Nay ; that I saw not ! That , weary weeks of watching and tending have brought back to you , "
47475	47493	47501	47501	she	1059	" Had I seen the smallest sign of decay , I would at once have buried you . "
47494	47500	47501	47501	she	1059	" Dog of a fool ! "
47504	47531	47501	47501	she	1059	" I was but in a trance — Samoil ! what a fate!—Go and fetch the she - savage from whom you borrowed this hideous disguise . "
47532	47549	47550	47550	She	1059	" I made it for you . It is hideous , but I did my best . "
47559	47567	47568	47568	she	1059	" How long have I been insensible ? "
47571	47584	47550	47550	She	1059	" A woman could not have made that dress in a day ! "
47585	47591	47592	47592	I	0	" Not in twenty days , "
47595	47600	47592	47592	I	0	" hardly in thirty ! "
47601	47617	47550	47550	She	1059	" Ha ! How long do you pretend I have lain unconscious?—Answer me at once . "
47618	47668	47550	47550	She	1059	" I can not tell how long you had lain when I found you , but there was nothing left of you save skin and bone : that is more than three months ago.—Your hair was beautiful , nothing else ! I have done for it what I could . "
47669	47674	47675	47675	she	1059	" My poor hair ! "
47690	47724	47675	47675	she	1059	" — it will be more than a three - months ' care to bring you to life again!—I suppose I must thank you , although I can not say I am grateful ! "
47725	47751	47550	47550	She	1059	" There is no need , madam : I would have done the same for any woman — yes , or for any man either ! "
47752	47762	47763	47763	she	1059	" How is it my hair is not tangled ? "
47769	47777	47763	47763	she	1059	" It always drifted in the current . "
47778	47784	47550	47550	She	1059	" How?—What do you mean ? "
47785	47805	47806	47806	She	1059	" I could not have brought you to life but by bathing you in the hot river every morning . "
47833	47840	47841	47841	she	1059	" We must understand each other ! "
47844	47874	47828	47828	she	1059	" — You have done me the two worst of wrongs — compelled me to live , and put me to shame : neither of them can I pardon ! "
48073	48082	48083	48083	I	0	" Is this , then , the end ? "
48200	48203	48204	48204	I	0	" No , "
48208	48270	48206	48206	myself	0	" beauty must have a heart ! However profoundly hidden , it must be there ! The deeper buried , the stronger and truer will it wake at last in its beautiful grave ! To rouse that heart were a better gift to her than the happiest life ! It would be to give her a nobler , a higher life ! "
48452	48459	48460	48460	she	1059	" Why do you follow me ? "
48477	48484	48470	48470	she	1059	" I have lived so long , "
48488	48506	48485	48485	I	0	" on the mere hope of your eyes , that I must want to see them again ! "
48507	48514	48515	48515	she	1059	" You will not be spared ! "
48519	48529	48515	48515	she	1059	" I command you to stop where you stand . "
48530	48546	48547	48547	I	0	" Not until I see you in a place of safety will I leave you , "
48550	48556	48557	48557	she	1059	" Then take the consequences , "
48619	48625	48626	48626	I	0	" Have pity upon me ! "
48647	48654	48655	48655	I	0	" I will be your slave ! "
48692	48696	48697	48697	I	0	" Pity me , "
48869	48878	48879	48879	she	1059	" Begone ! Do not dare touch me , "
49081	49084	49085	49085	she	951	" Down ! "
49095	49104	49085	49085	she	951	" Follow me a step if you dare ! "

49409	49420	49406	49406	I	0	" is the terrible creature speeding to the night - infolded city?"—and
49534	49539	49540	49540	I	0	" It was well , "
49543	49564	49540	49540	I	0	" that I could not cry out : if she had risen , the monster would have been upon her ! "
49816	49821	49822	49822	I	0	" She is chased ! "
49827	49838	49822	49822	I	0	" Some prowler of this terrible night is after her ! "
50105	50110	50111	50111	I	0	" It is blood ! "
50116	50127	50111	50111	I	0	" some readier champion than I has wounded the beast ! "
50202	50211	50212	50212	I	0	" If it go on bleeding like that , "
50215	50222	50223	50223	I	0	" it will soon be hurtless ! "
50265	50273	50274	50274	I	0	" Can I do anything for you ? "
50299	50306	50307	50307	I	0	" You need not be frightened , "
50310	50345	50307	50307	I	0	" I was following the beast when happily you found a nearer protector ! It passed me now with its foot bleeding so much that by this time it must be all but dead ! "
50346	50354	50355	50355	she	348	" There is little hope of that ! "
50360	50370	50355	50355	she	348	" Do you not know whose beast she is ? "
50398	50402	50403	50403	she	348	" What champion ? "
50406	50413	50403	50403	she	348	" I have seen no one . "
50414	50423	50386	50387	the brute	1095	" Then how came the monster to grief ? "
50424	50447	50403	50403	she	348	" I pounded her foot with a stone — as hard as I could strike . Did you not hear her cry ? "
50448	50457	50458	50458	I	0	" Well , you are a brave woman ! "
50461	50471	50458	50458	I	0	" I thought it was you gave the cry ! "
50472	50478	50403	50403	she	348	" It was the leopardess . "
50479	50504	50403	50403	she	348	" I never heard such a sound from the throat of an animal ! it was like the scream of a woman in torture ! "
50505	50546	50458	50458	I	0	" My voice was gone ; I could not have shrieked to save my baby ! When I saw the horrid mouth at my darling 's little white neck , I caught up a stone and mashed her lame foot . "
50547	50554	50555	50555	I	0	" Tell me about the creature , "
50558	50567	50555	50555	I	0	" I am a stranger in these parts . "
50568	50582	50583	50583	she	1097	" You will soon know about her if you are going to Bulika ! "
50586	50596	50583	50583	she	1097	" Now , I must never go back there ! "
50597	50606	50607	50607	I	0	" Yes , I am going to Bulika , "
50610	50617	50607	50607	I	0	" — to see the princess . "
50618	50643	50644	50644	I	0	" Have a care ; you had better not go!—But perhaps you are — ! The princess is a very good , kind woman ! "
50679	50691	50692	50692	I	0	" You are in no danger of any sort from me , "
50695	50705	50692	50692	I	0	" What oath would you like me to take ? "
50706	50722	50723	50723	she	475	" I know by your speech that you are not of the people of Bulika , "
50726	50783	50784	50784	she	475	" I will trust you!—I am not of them , either , else I should not be able : they never trust any one.—If only I could see you ! But I like your voice!—There , my darling is asleep ! The foul beast has not hurt her!—Yes : it was my baby she was after ! "
50792	50815	50816	50816	she	475	" And then she would have torn her mother to pieces for carrying her off!—Some say the princess has two white leopardesses , "
50819	50946	50816	50816	she	475	" I know only one — with spots . Everybody knows her ! If the princess hear of a baby , she sends her immediately to suck its blood , and then it either dies or grows up an idiot . I would have gone away with my baby , but the princess was from home , and I thought I might wait until I was a little stronger . But she must have taken the beast with her , and been on her way home when I left , and come across my track . I heard the sniff - snuff of the leopardess behind me , and ran;—oh , how I ran!—But my darling will not die ! There is no mark on her ! "
50947	50954	50784	50784	she	475	" Where are you taking her ? "
50955	50962	50784	50784	she	475	" Where no one ever tells ! "
50963	50971	50816	50816	she	475	" Why is the princess so cruel ? "
50972	51003	50784	50784	she	475	" There is an old prophecy that a child will be the death of her . That is why she will listen to no offer of marriage , they say . "
51004	51019	50784	50784	she	475	" But what will become of her country if she kill all the babies ? "
51020	51150	50816	50816	she	475	" She does not care about her country . She sends witches around to teach the women spells that keep babies away , and give them horrible things to eat . Some say she is in league with the Shadows to put an end to the race . At night we hear the questing beast , and lie awake and shiver . She can tell at once the house where a baby is coming , and lies down at the door , watching to get in . There are words that have power to shoo her away , only they do not always work.—But here I sit talking , and the beast may by this time have got home , and her mistress be sending the other after us ! "
51161	51178	51179	51179	I	0	" I do not think she will ever get home.—Let me carry the baby for you ! "
51207	51213	51214	51214	I	0	" I can not think , "
51222	51232	51214	51214	I	0	" how the brute could be bleeding so much ! "
51233	51246	51247	51247	she	1100	" Take my advice , and do n't go near the palace , "
51250	51274	51247	51247	she	1100	" There are sounds in it at night as if the dead were trying to shriek , but could not open their mouths ! "
53142	53156	53157	53157	I	0	" If the brute come here , I will lay hold of it , "
53160	53166	53157	53157	I	0	" and you must run . "
53167	53171	53172	53172	she	348	" Thank you ! "
53175	53183	53184	53184	I	0	" Have you ever seen it before ? "
53187	53191	53192	53192	she	348	" Several times , "
53198	53219	53192	53192	she	348	" She is a pet of the princess 's . You are a stranger , or you would know her ! "
53220	53226	53227	53227	I	0	" I am a stranger , "
53230	53242	53227	53227	I	0	" But is she , then , allowed to run loose ? "
53243	53297	53192	53192	she	348	" She is kept in a cage , her mouth muzzled , and her feet in gloves of crocodile leather . Chained she is too ; but she gets out often , and sucks the blood of any child she can lay hold of . Happily there are not many mothers in Bulika ! "
53304	53312	53313	53313	she	348	" I wish I were at home ! "
53316	53373	53313	53313	she	348	" The princess returned only last night , and there is the leopardess out already ! How am I to get into the house ? It is me she is after , I know ! She will be lying at my own door , watching for me!—But I am a fool to talk to a stranger ! "
53374	53381	53382	53382	I	0	" All strangers are not bad ! "
53385	53426	53382	53382	I	0	" The beast shall not touch you till she has done with me , and by that time you will be in . You are happy to have a house to go to ! What a terrible wind it is ! "
53427	53442	53443	53443	she	1167	" Take me home safe , and I will give you shelter from it , "
53446	53454	53443	53443	she	1167	" But we must wait a little ! "
53492	53495	53496	53496	I	0	" Why ? "
53499	53508	53509	53509	she	1167	" Because it is a disgrace to work , "
53512	53519	53520	53520	I	0	" Everybody in Bulika knows that ! "
53560	53568	53569	53569	I	0	" But there must be some poor ! "
53572	53610	53569	53569	I	0	" I suppose there must be , but we never think of such people . When one goes poor , we forget him . That is how we keep rich . We mean to be rich always . "
53611	53643	53569	53569	I	0	" But when you have dug up all your precious stones and sold them , you will have to spend your money , and one day you will have none left ! "
53644	53667	53668	53668	she	1173	" We have so many , and there are so many still in the ground , that that day will never come , "
53671	53688	53668	53668	she	1173	" Suppose a strange people were to fall upon you , and take everything you have ! "
53689	53717	53726	53726	she	1173	" No strange people will dare ; they are all horribly afraid of our princess . She it is who keeps us safe and free and rich ! "
53758	53763	53764	53764	I	0	" How is that ? "
53767	53780	53781	53781	she	1173	" Because we are more ancient and noble than any other nation.—Therefore , "
53784	53793	53781	53781	she	1173	" we always turn strangers out before night . "
53794	53807	53808	53808	I	0	" How , then , can you take me into your house ? "
53811	53820	53821	53821	she	1173	" I will make an exception of you , "
53824	53839	53821	53821	she	1173	" Is there no place in the city for the taking in of strangers ? "
53840	53877	53878	53878	She	1173	" Such a place would be pulled down , and its owner burned . How is purity to be preserved except by keeping low people at a proper distance ? Dignity is such a delicate thing ! "
54586	54593	54595	54595	I	0	" She too has failed me ! "
54597	54622	54595	54595	I	0	" — given me up to the beast to be settled with at her leisure ! But we shall have a tussle for it ! "
54963	54971	54954	54955	the creature	3284	meant—"Why would you make me do it ? "
55213	55220	55221	55221	I	0	" It is the white leopardess ! "
55224	55249	55221	55221	I	0	" She is come to suck my blood!—and why should she not have it?—it would cost me more to defend than to yield it ! "
55383	55392	55393	55393	I	0	" Is it possible I am at home ? "
55906	55912	55913	55913	I	0	" To see the princess , "
55916	55921	55922	55922	he	1258	" A likely thing ! "
55925	55936	55922	55922	he	1258	" I have not seen her highness this morning myself ! "
55953	55983	55937	55937	I	0	" Take me to her at once , or I will drag you with me till I find her . She shall know how her servants receive her visitors . "
56119	56126	56127	56127	I	0	" Take me to the princess , "

56146	56160	56127	56127	I	0	" Let her know that I am here , waiting audience of her . "
56161	56172	56215	56215	He	1258	" Will your lordship please to give me your name ? "
56173	56188	56226	56227	The others	754	" Tell her that one who knows the white leech desires to see her . "
56189	56209	56127	56127	I	0	" She will kill me if I take such a message : I must not . I dare not . "
56210	56214	56215	56215	He	1258	" You refuse ? "
56350	56360	56361	56361	he	1266	" Please to come this way , my lord , "
56631	56634	56636	56636	I	0	" Alas , "
56638	56665	56636	56636	I	0	" ill did I reckon my danger ! Can this be the woman I rescued — she who struck me , scorned me , left me ? "
56691	56698	56699	56699	I	0	" She will not acknowledge me ! "
56726	56734	56735	56735	she	3100	" You have found me at last ! "
56745	56751	56735	56735	she	3100	" I knew you would ! "
56779	56783	56784	56784	she	3100	" You shiver ! "
56787	56797	56784	56784	she	3100	" This place is cold for you ! Come . "
56844	56855	56856	56856	she	3100	" You have grown brown since last I saw you , "
56859	56875	56876	56876	I	0	" This is almost the first roof I have been under since you left me , "
56879	56885	56886	56886	she	3100	" Whose was the other ? "
56889	56899	56886	56886	she	3100	" I do not know the woman 's name . "
56900	56918	56919	56919	She	3100	" I would gladly learn it ! The instinct of hospitality is not strong in my people ! "
56958	56968	56969	56969	she	3100	" How you must miss the hot flowing river ! "
56972	57021	56969	56969	she	3100	" But there is a bath in the corner with no white leeches in it ! At the foot of your couch you will find a garment . When you come down , I shall be in the room to your left at the foot of the stair . "
57616	57625	57626	57626	she	3100	" Here we do not kill to eat , "
57629	57642	57626	57626	she	3100	" but I think you will like what I can give you . "
57721	57730	57731	57731	she	3100	" You have never drunk wine like this ! "
57759	57770	57771	57771	she	3100	" And now that you will be able to listen , "
57775	57914	57771	57771	she	3100	" I must do what I can to make myself intelligible to you . Our natures , however , are so different , that this may not be easy . Men and women live but to die ; we , that is such as I — we are but a few — live to live on . Old age is to you a horror ; to me it is a dear desire : the older we grow , the nearer we are to our perfection . Your perfection is a poor thing , comes soon , and lasts but a little while ; ours is a ceaseless ripening . I am not yet ripe , and have lived thousands of your years — how many , I never cared to note . The everlasting will not be measured . "
58199	58248	58249	58250	Beautiful princess	1301	" She looked at me tenderly , and hid her face in her hands . But I had caught a flash and a sparkle behind the tenderness , and did not believe her . She laid herself out to secure and enslave me ; she only fascinated me ! "
58252	58256	58249	58250	Beautiful princess	1301	" I said , "
58271	58272	58249	58250	Beautiful princess	1301	" "
58281	58285	58249	58250	Beautiful princess	1301	" she replied , "
58337	58467	58468	58468	I	0	" I had set out to visit a part of my dominions occupied by a savage dwarf - people , strong and fierce , enemies to law and order , opposed to every kind of progress — an evil race . I went alone , fearing nothing , unaware of the least necessity for precaution . I did not know that upon the hot stream beside which you found me , a certain woman , by no means so powerful as myself , not being immortal , had cast what you call a spell — which is merely the setting in motion of a force as natural as any other , but operating primarily in a region beyond the ken of the mortal who makes use of the force . "
58485	58513	58468	58468	I	0	" A shadow of embarrassment darkened her cheek : I understood it , but showed no sign . Checked for the merest moment , she went on : "
58614	58636	58609	58609	myself	0	" She rose , her eyes flashing as never human eyes flashed , and threw her arms high over her head . "
58645	58649	58643	58643	yours	1304	" she cried . "
58675	58794	58669	58669	your	1303	" She dropt kneeling beside me , laid her arms across my knees , and looked up in my face . Then first I noted on her left hand a large clumsy glove . In my mind 's eye I saw hair and claws under it , but I knew it was a hand shut hard — perhaps badly bruised . I glanced at the other : it was lovely as hand could be , and I felt that , if I did less than loathe her , I should love her . Not to dally with usurping emotions , I turned my eyes aside . She started to her feet . I sat motionless , looking down . "
58802	58882	58797	58797	she	1306	" said my vanity . For a moment I was tempted to love a lie . An odour , rather than the gentlest of airy pulses , was fanning me . I glanced up . She stood erect before me , waving her lovely arms in seemingly mystic fashion . A frightful roar made my heart rebound against the walls of its cage . The alabaster trembled as if it would shake into shivers . The princess shuddered visibly . "
58891	58900	58883	58883	My	0	" she said , in a quavering voice ; "
58934	58941	58967	58967	she	0	" As she preceded me up the stair,—"I
58950	58954	58959	58959	I	0	" she said . "
58976	60896	60897	60897	I	0	" The roar seemed to me , however — I could not tell why — to come from the white leopardess , and to be meant for me , not the princess . With a smile she left me at the door of my room , but as she turned I read anxiety on her beautiful face . I THREW myself on the bed , and began to turn over in my mind the tale she had told me . She had forgotten herself , and , by a single incautious word , removed one perplexity as to the condition in which I found her in the forest ! The leopardess bounded over ; the princess lay prostrate on the bank : the running stream had dissolved her self - enchantment ! Her own account of the object of her journey revealed the danger of the Little Ones then imminent : I had saved the life of their one fearful enemy ! I had but reached this conclusion when I fell asleep . The lovely wine may not have been quite innocent . When I opened my eyes , it was night . A lamp , suspended from the ceiling , cast a clear , although soft light through the chamber . A delicious languor infolded me . I seemed floating , far from land , upon the bosom of a twilight sea . Existence was in itself pleasure . I had no pain . Surely I was dying ! No pain!—ah , what a shoot of mortal pain was that ! what a sickening sting ! It went right through my heart ! Again ! That was sharpness itself!—and so sickening ! I could not move my hand to lay it on my heart ; something kept it down ! The pain was dying away , but my whole body seemed paralysed . Some evil thing was upon me!—something hateful ! I would have struggled , but could not reach a struggle . My will agonised , but in vain , to assert itself . I desisted , and lay passive . Then I became aware of a soft hand on my face , pressing my head into the pillow , and of a heavy weight lying across me . I began to breathe more freely ; the weight was gone from my chest ; I opened my eyes . The princess was standing above me on the bed , looking out into the room , with the air of one who dreamed . Her great eyes were clear and calm . Her mouth wore a look of satisfied passion ; she wiped from it a streak of red . She caught my gaze , bent down , and struck me on the eyes with the handkerchief in her hand : it was like drawing the edge of a knife across them , and for a moment or two I was blind . I heard a dull heavy sound , as of a large soft - footed animal alighting from a little jump . I opened my eyes , and saw the great swing of a long tail as it disappeared through the half - open doorway . I sprang after it . The creature had vanished quite . I shot down the stair , and into the hall of alabaster . The moon was high , and the place like the inside of a faint , sun - blanched moon . The princess was not there . I must find her : in her presence I might protect myself ; out of it I could not ! I was a tame animal for her to feed upon ; a human fountain for a thirst demoniac ! She showed me favour the more easily to use me ! My waking eyes did not fear her , but they would close , and she would come ! Not seeing her , I felt her everywhere , for she might be anywhere — might even now be waiting me in some secret cavern of sleep ! Only with my eyes upon her could I feel safe from her ! Outside the alabaster hall it was pitch - dark , and I had to grope my way along with hands and feet . At last I felt a curtain , put it aside , and entered the black hall . There I found a great silent assembly . How it was visible I neither saw nor could imagine , for the walls , the floor , the roof , were shrouded in what seemed an infinite blackness , blacker than the blackest of moonless , starless nights ; yet my eyes could separate , although vaguely , not a few of the individuals in the mass interpenetrated and divided , as well as surrounded , by the darkness . It seemed as if my eyes would never come quite to themselves . I pressed their balls and looked and looked again , but what I saw would not grow distinct . Blackness mingled with form , silence and undefined motion possessed the wide space . All was a dim , confused dance , filled with recurrent glimpses of shapes not unknown to me . Now appeared a woman , with glorious eyes looking out of a skull ; now an armed figure on a skeleton horse ; now one now another of the hideous burrowing phantasms . I could trace no order and little relation in the mingling and crossing currents and eddies . If I seemed to catch the shape and rhythm of a dance , it was but to see it break , and confusion prevail . With the shifting colours of the seemingly more solid shapes , mingled a multitude of shadows , independent apparently of originals , each moving after its own free shadow - will . I looked everywhere for the princess , but throughout the wildly changing kaleidoscopic scene , could not see her nor discover indication of her presence . Where was she ? What might she not be doing ? No one took the least notice of me as I wandered hither and thither seeking her . At length losing hope , I turned away to look elsewhere . Finding the wall , and keeping to it with my hand , for even then I could not see it , I came , groping along , to a curtained opening into the vestibule . Dimly moonlighted , the cage of the leopardess was the arena of what seemed a desperate although silent struggle . Two vastly differing forms , human and bestial , with entangled confusion of mingling bodies and limbs , writhed and wrestled in closest embrace . It had lasted but an instant when I saw the leopardess out of the cage , walking quietly to the open door . As I hastened after her I threw a glance behind me : there was the leopardess in the cage , couching motionless as when I saw her first . The moon , half - way up the sky , was shining round and clear ; the bodiless shadow I had seen the night before , was walking through the trees toward the gate ; and after him went the leopardess , swinging her tail . I followed , a little way off , as silently as they , and neither of them once looked round . Through the open gate we went down to the city , lying quiet as the moonshine upon it . The face of the moon was very still , and its stillness looked like that of expectation . The Shadow took his way straight to the stair at the top of which I had lain the night before . Without a pause he went up , and the leopardess followed . I quickened my pace , but , a moment after , heard a cry of horror . Then came the fall of something soft and heavy between me and the stair , and at my feet lay a body , frightfully blackened and crushed , but still recognisable as that of the woman who had led me home and shut me out . As I stood petrified , the spotted leopardess came bounding down the stair with a baby in her mouth . I darted to seize her ere she could turn at the foot ; but that instant , from behind me , the white leopardess , like a great bar of glowing silver , shot through the moonlight , and had her by the neck . She dropped the child ; I caught it up , and stood to watch the battle between them . What a sight it was — now the one , now the other uppermost , both too intent for any noise beyond a low growl , a whimpered cry , or a snarl of hate — followed by a quicker scrambling of claws , as each , worrying and pushing and dragging , struggled for foothold on the pavement ! The spotted leopardess was larger than the white , and I was anxious for my friend ; but I soon saw that , though neither stronger nor more active , the white leopardess had the greater endurance . Not once did she lose her hold on the neck of the other . From the spotted throat at length issued a howl of agony , changing , by swift - crowded gradations , into the long - drawn crescendo of a woman 's uttermost wail . The white one relaxed her jaws ; the spotted one drew herself away , and rose on her hind legs . Erect in the moonlight stood the princess , a confused rush of shadows careering over her whiteness — the spots of the leopard crowding , hurrying , fleeing to the refuge of her eyes , where merging they vanished . The last few , outsped and belated , mingled with the cloud of her streamy hair , leaving her radiant as the moon when a legion of little vapours has flown , wind - hunted , off her silvery disc — save that , adown the white column of her throat , a thread of blood still trickled from every wound of her adversary 's terrible teeth . She turned away , took a few steps with the gait of a Hecate , fell , covered afresh with her spots , and fled at a long , stretching gallop . The white leopardess turned also , sprang upon me , pulled my arms asunder , caught the baby as it fell , and flew with it along the street toward the gate . I TURNED and followed the spotted leopardess , catching but one glimpse of her as she tore up the brow of the hill to the gate of the palace . When I reached the entrance - hall , the princess was just throwing the robe around her which she had left on the floor . The blood had ceased to flow from her wounds , and had dried in the wind of her flight . When she saw me , a flash of anger crossed her face , and she turned her head aside . Then , with an attempted smile , she looked at me , and said , "
60956	61019	60928	60928	she	3066	" She gave a shiver , and I could not help pitying her , although I knew she lied , for her wounds were real , and her face reminded me of how she looked in the cave . My heart began to reproach me that I had let her fight unaided , and I suppose I looked the compassion I felt . "
61024	61033	61020	61022	Child of folly	1310	" she said , with another attempted smile , "
61065	61461	61054	61054	I	0	" But I followed her close . Out of my sight I feared her . The instant the princess entered , I heard a buzzing sound as of many low voices , and , one portion after another , the assembly began to be shiftingly illuminated , as by a ray that went travelling from spot to spot . Group after group would shine out for a space , then sink back into the general vagueness , while another part of the vast company would grow momently bright . Some of the actions going on when thus illuminated , were not unknown to me ; I had been in them , or had looked on them , and so had the princess : present with every one of them I now saw her . The skull - headed dancers footed the grass in the forest - hall : there was the princess looking in at the door ! The fight went on in the Evil Wood : there was the princess urging it ! Yet I was close behind her all the time , she standing motionless , her head sunk on her bosom . The confused murmur continued , the confused commotion of colours and shapes ; and still the ray went shifting and showing . It settled at last on the hollow in the heath , and there was the princess , walking up and down , and trying in vain to wrap the vapour around her ! Then first I was startled at what I saw : the old librarian walked up to her , and stood for a moment regarding her ; she fell ; her limbs forsook her and fled ; her body vanished . A wild shriek rang through the echoing place , and with the fall of her eidolon , the princess herself , till then standing like a statue in front of me , fell heavily , and lay still . I turned at once and went out : not again would I seek to restore her ! As I stood trembling beside the cage , I knew that in the black ellipsoid I had been in the brain of the princess!—I saw the tail of the leopardess quiver once . While still endeavouring to compose myself , I heard the voice of the princess beside me . "
61465	61469	61470	61470	I	0	" she said ; "
61483	61589	61470	61470	I	0	" She led the way into the court . I followed in dazed compliance . The moon was near the zenith , and her present silver seemed brighter than the gold of the absent sun . She brought me through the trees to the tallest of them , the one in the centre . It was not quite like the rest , for its branches , drawing their ends together at the top , made a clump that looked from beneath like a fir - cone . The princess stood close under it , gazing up , and said , as if talking to herself , "
61652	61667	61647	61650	that cat - woman	1313	" She turned to me quickly , saying with one of her sweetest smiles , "
61672	61747	61647	61650	that cat - woman	1313	" The smile vanished with the brief question , and her face changed to a look of sadness and suffering . I ought to have left her to suffer , but the way she put her hand to her wounded neck went to my heart . I considered the tree . All the way up to the branches , were projections on the stem like the remnants on a palm of its fallen leaves . "
61754	61758	61748	61748	I	0	" I answered . "
61764	61786	61748	61748	I	0	" she returned . In my haste to follow the leopardess disappearing , I had left my sandals in my room . "
61792	61796	61748	61748	I	0	" I said ; "
61803	61880	61881	61881	I	0	" Again I looked at the tree , and my eyes went wandering up the stem until my sight lost itself in the branches . The moon shone like silvery foam here and there on the rugged bole , and a little rush of wind went through the top with a murmurous sound as of water falling softly into water . I approached the tree to begin my ascent of it . The princess stopped me . "
61893	61897	61881	61881	I	0	" she insisted . "
61907	61908	61881	61881	I	0	" "
61917	61933	61881	61881	I	0	" I answered — not believing , I confess , that there was any snake . "
61940	61944	61881	61881	I	0	" she replied . "
61950	61996	61881	61881	I	0	" She tore from her garment the two wide borders that met in front , and kneeling on one knee , made me put first my left foot , then my right on the other , and bound them about with the thick embroidered strips . "
62006	62010	61997	61997	You	0	" I said . "
62030	62281	62282	62282	I	0	" she replied . I turned to the tree , and began to climb . Now in Bulika the cold after sundown was not so great as in certain other parts of the country — especially about the sexton 's cottage ; yet when I had climbed a little way , I began to feel very cold , grew still colder as I ascended , and became coldest of all when I got among the branches . Then I shivered , and seemed to have lost my hands and feet . There was hardly any wind , and the branches did not sway in the least , yet , as I approached the summit , I became aware of a peculiar unsteadiness : every branch on which I placed foot or laid hold , seemed on the point of giving way . When my head rose above the branches near the top , and in the open moonlight I began to look about for the blossom , that instant I found myself drenched from head to foot . The next , as if plunged in a stormy water , I was flung about wildly , and felt myself sinking . Tossed up and down , tossed this way and tossed that way , rolled over and over , checked , rolled the other way and tossed up again , I was sinking lower and lower . Gasping and gurgling and choking , I fell at last upon a solid bottom . "
62287	62424	62282	62282	I	0	" croaked a voice in my ear . I RUBBED the water out of my eyes , and saw the raven on the edge of a huge stone basin . With the cold light of the dawn reflected from his glossy plumage , he stood calmly looking down upon me . I lay on my back in water , above which , leaning on my elbows , I just lifted my face . I was in the basin of the large fountain constructed by my father in the middle of the lawn . High over me glimmered the thick , steel - shiny stalk , shooting , with a torrent uprush , a hundred feet into the air , to spread in a blossom of foam . Nettled at the coolness of the raven 's remark , "
62430	62434	62435	62435	I	0	" I said . "
62448	62449	62435	62435	I	0	" "
62459	62460	62461	62461	You	1315	" "
62472	62512	62513	62513	You	1315	" replied Mr. Raven , who stood leaning over the margin of the basin , and stretched his hand across to me . I took it , and was immediately beside him on the lawn , dripping and streaming . "
62521	62525	62513	62513	You	1315	" he said . "
62551	62578	62579	62579	I	0	" He was again a raven , walking , with something stately in his step , toward the house , the door of which stood open . "
62586	62602	62579	62579	I	0	" I laughed ; for I had flung aside my robe to climb the tree . "
62614	62692	62579	62579	I	0	" said the raven . In the house no one seemed awake . I went to my room , found a dressing - gown , and descended to the library . As I entered , the librarian came from the closet . I threw myself on a couch . Mr. Raven drew a chair to my side and sat down . For a minute or two neither spoke . I was the first to break the silence . "
62699	62703	62579	62579	I	0	" I said . "
62708	62712	62713	62713	nobody	149	" he rejoined : "

63902	63903	63921	63921	she	3100	" "
63928	63929	63921	63921	she	3100	" "
63938	63951	63932	63932	you	0	" I cried , a fresh horror taking me by the throat . "
63979	63980	63972	63972	she	3100	" "
63985	63990	63972	63972	she	3100	" returned the librarian . "
64021	64066	64015	64015	I	0	" He rose , went to the door of the closet , brought from it the mutilated volume , and sat down again beside me . I stared at the book in his hand : it was a whole book , entire and sound ! "
64075	64079	64015	64015	I	0	" I gasped . "
64086	64116	64015	64015	I	0	" he answered . I held my peace . A single question more would have been a plunge into a bottomless sea , and there might be no time ! "
64119	64123	64124	64124	I	0	" he said : "
64149	64400	64401	64401	I	0	" He opened the vellum cover , and turned a leaf or two . The parchment was discoloured with age , and one leaf showed a dark stain over two - thirds of it . He slowly turned this also , and seemed looking for a certain passage in what appeared a continuous poem . Somewhere about the middle of the book he began to read . But what follows represents — not what he read , only the impression it made upon me . The poem seemed in a language I had never before heard , which yet I understood perfectly , although I could not write the words , or give their meaning save in poor approximation . These fragments , then , are the shapes which those he read have finally taken in passing again through my brain : — He turned a leaf and read again : — Again he paused , again turned a leaf , and again began : — A strange , repulsive feline wail arose somewhere in the room . I started up on my elbow and stared about me , but could see nothing . Mr. Raven turned several leaves , and went on : — Again I heard the ugly cry of feline pain . Again I looked , but saw neither shape nor motion . Mr. Raven seemed to listen a moment , but again turned several pages , and resumed : — Once more arose the bestial wail . "
64411	64640	64401	64401	I	0	" said the librarian , casting a glance around him ; but instantly he turned a leaf or two , and again read : — With a fearsome yell , her clammy fur staring in clumps , her tail thick as a cable , her eyes flashing green as a chrysoprase , her distended claws entangling themselves so that she floundered across the carpet , a huge white cat rushed from somewhere , and made for the chimney . Quick as thought the librarian threw the manuscript between her and the hearth . She crouched instantly , her eyes fixed on the book . But his voice went on as if still he read , and his eyes seemed also fixed on the book : — At these words such a howling , such a prolonged yell of agony burst from the cat , that we both stopped our ears . When it ceased , Mr. Raven walked to the fire - place , took up the book , and , standing between the creature and the chimney , pointed his finger at her for a moment . She lay perfectly still . He took a half - burnt stick from the hearth , drew with it some sign on the floor , put the manuscript back in its place , with a look that seemed to say , "
64649	64671	64644	64644	her	1360	" and , returning to the cat , stood over her and said , in a still , solemn voice : — "
64967	64997	64953	64953	She	1360	" The animal lay motionless , its beryl eyes fixed flaming on the man : his eyes on hers held them fixed that they could not move from his . "
65022	65075	65079	65079	her	1360	" The cat gave a horrible screech , and began to grow bigger . She went on growing and growing . At last the spotted leopardess uttered a roar that made the house tremble . I sprang to my feet . I do not think Mr. Raven started even with his eyelids . "
65084	65088	65079	65079	her	1360	" he said , "
65257	65330	65254	65254	thou	1389	" Then at last I understood that Mr. Raven was indeed Adam , the old and the new man ; and that his wife , ministering in the house of the dead , was Eve , the mother of us all , the lady of the New Jerusalem . The leopardess reared ; the flickering and fleeing of her spots began ; the princess at length stood radiant in her perfect shape . "
65338	65351	65331	65331	I	0	" she said — and she looked the goddess she would be . "
65362	65371	65331	65331	I	0	" answered he who had been her husband . "
65381	65410	65331	65331	I	0	" For her arm lay across her bosom , and her hand was pressed to her side . A swift pang contorted her beautiful face , and passed . "
65430	65434	65426	65426	I	0	" she answered . "
65458	65493	65444	65444	thou	0	" Her hand sank away , and as it dropt she looked him in the eyes with a quailing fierceness that had in it no surrender . He gazed a moment at the spot . "
65507	65511	65444	65444	thou	0	" he said . "
65537	65547	65548	65548	Lilith	66	" She gave a glance downward , and shivered . "
65550	65564	65566	65566	me	0	" said Adam , and his tone had changed to a tender beseeching , "
65580	65626	65572	65572	He	1393	" Her hand returned quivering to her side . Her face grew dark . She gave the cry of one from whom hope is vanishing . The cry passed into a howl . She lay writhing on the floor , a leopardess covered with spots . "
65632	65636	65629	65629	thou	66	" Adam resumed , "
65702	65718	65719	65719	I	0	" She rose , she stood upright , a woman once more , and said , "
65733	65772	65724	65724	I	0	" My eyes were fastened on the princess ; but when Adam spoke , I turned to him : he stood towering above her ; the form of his visage was altered , and his voice was terrible . "
65775	65779	65785	65785	me	0	" he cried ; "
65793	65874	65786	65786	I	0	" She flung herself on the floor , dwindled and dwindled , and was again a gray cat . Adam caught her up by the skin of her neck , bore her to the closet , and threw her in . He described a strange figure on the threshold , and closing the door , locked it . Then he returned to my side the old librarian , looking sad and worn , and furtively wiping tears from his eyes . "
65882	65886	65888	65888	she	1396	" he said , "
65901	65902	65894	65894	She	1396	" "
65912	65916	65939	65939	her	1396	" I asked . "
65920	65924	65925	65925	She	1396	" he answered . "
66222	66417	66211	66211	herself	698	" You have saved the life of her and their enemy ; therefore your life belongs to her and them . The princess was on her way to destroy them , but as she crossed that stream , vengeance overtook her , and she would have died had you not come to her aid . You did ; and ere now she would have been raging among the Little Ones , had she dared again cross the stream . But there was yet a way to the blessed little colony through the world of the three dimensions ; only , from that , by the slaying of her former body , she had excluded herself , and except in personal contact with one belonging to it , could not re - enter it . You provided the opportunity : never , in all her long years , had she had one before . Her hand , with lightest touch , was on one or other of your muffled feet , every step as you climbed . In that little chamber , she is now watching to leave it as soon as ever she may . "
66418	66437	66438	66438	I	0	" She can not know anything about the door!—she can not at least know how to open it ! "
66452	66457	66459	66460	the librarian	245	" Hush , hush ! "
66466	66496	66459	66460	the librarian	245	" she can hear through anything!—You must go at once , and make your way to my wife 's cottage . I will remain to keep guard over her . "
66497	66506	66507	66507	I	0	" Let me go to the Little Ones ! "
66510	66530	66507	66507	I	0	" Beware of that , Mr. Vane . Go to my wife , and do as she tells you . "
66576	66584	66585	66585	I	0	" Tell me first , Mr. Raven , "
66588	66617	66585	66585	I	0	" why , of all places , you have shut her up there ! The night I ran from your house , it was immediately into that closet ! "
66618	66640	66652	66652	I	0	" The closet is no nearer our cottage , and no farther from it , than any or every other place . "
66641	66644	66645	66645	I	0	" But , "
66657	66771	66645	66645	I	0	" how is it then that , when you please , you take from that same door a whole book where I saw and felt only a part of one ? The other part , you have just told me , stuck through into your library : when you put it again on the shelf , will it not again stick through into that ? Must not then the two places , in which parts of the same volume can at the same moment exist , lie close together ? Or can one part of the book be in space , or somewhere , and the other out of space , or nowhere ? "
66772	66785	66786	66786	he	1427	" I am sorry I can not explain the thing to you , "
66789	66988	66786	66786	he	1427	" but there is no provision in you for understanding it . Not merely , therefore , is the phenomenon inexplicable to you , but the very nature of it is inapprehensible by you . Indeed I but partially apprehend it myself . At the same time you are constantly experiencing things which you not only do not , but can not understand . You think you understand them , but your understanding of them is only your being used to them , and therefore not surprised at them . You accept them , not because you understand them , but because you must accept them : they are there , and have unavoidable relations with you ! The fact is , no man understands anything ; when he knows he does not understand , that is his first tottering step — not toward understanding , but toward the capability of one day understanding . To such things as these you are not used , therefore you do not fancy you understand them . Neither I nor any man can here help you to understand ; but I may , perhaps , help you a little to believe ! "
67110	67116	67117	67117	I	0	" Why did you whistle ? "
67120	67129	67117	67117	I	0	" Surely sound here is not sound there ! "
67130	67135	67136	67136	he	1428	" You are right , "
67139	67172	67136	67136	he	1428	" I whistled that you might know I called her . Not the whistle , but what the whistle meant reached her.—There is not a minute to lose : you must go ! "
67173	67179	67180	67180	I	0	" I will at once ! "
67189	67200	67201	67201	he	1428	" You will sleep to - night at my hostelry ! "
67217	67225	67226	67226	I	0	" My heart is with the children , "
67229	67236	67226	67226	I	0	" But if you insist — — "
67237	67262	67263	67263	He	1428	" I do insist . You can otherwise effect nothing.—I will go with you as far as the mirror , and see you off . "
67292	67297	67298	67298	he	1428	" Come ; come ! "
67337	67346	67347	67347	I	0	" To think of her lying there alone , "
67350	67357	67347	67347	I	0	" — with that terrible wound ! "
67358	67366	67367	67367	he	1428	" Nothing will ever close that wound , "
67374	67423	67367	67367	he	1428	" It must eat into her heart ! Annihilation itself is no death to evil . Only good where evil was , is evil dead . An evil thing must live with its evil until it chooses to be good . That alone is the slaying of evil . "
67438	67445	67446	67446	I	0	" If she should break loose ! "
67449	67453	67454	67454	he	1428	" Make haste ! "
67457	67475	67454	67454	he	1428	" I shall hurry down the moment you are gone , and I have disarranged the mirrors . "
67599	67605	67606	67606	he	1428	" You need not run , "
67609	67621	67606	67606	he	1428	" you can not overtake her . This is our way . "
67632	67648	67649	67649	he	1428	" She has more magic at her finger - ends than I care to know ! "
67653	67661	67662	67662	I	0	" We must do what we can ! "
67688	67693	67694	67694	he	1428	" Doubtless we must , "
67697	67724	67694	67694	he	1428	" But my wife has warned Mara , and she will do her part ; you must sleep first : you have given me your word ! "
67725	67753	67782	67782	he	1428	" Nor do I mean to break it . But surely sleep is not the first thing ! Surely , surely , action takes precedence of repose ! "
67754	67778	67782	67782	he	1428	" A man can do nothing he is not fit to do.—See ! did I not tell you Mara would do her part ? "
67803	67808	67809	67809	he	1428	" There she is ! "
67812	67825	67809	67809	he	1428	" The spotted leopardess is strong , but the white is stronger ! "
67826	67843	67782	67782	he	1428	" I have seen them fight : the combat did not appear decisive as to that . "
67844	67914	67915	67915	I	0	" How should such eyes tell which have never slept ? The princess did not confess herself beaten — that she never does — but she fled ! When she confesses her last hope gone , that it is indeed hard to kick against the goad , then will her day begin to dawn ! Come ; come ! He who can not act must make haste to sleep ! "
68162	68174	68176	68182	the raven , alighting on a stone	1450	" You are tired , are you not , Mr. Vane ? "
68184	68200	68201	68201	He	1449	" You must make acquaintance with the horse that will carry you in the morning ! "
68617	68627	68628	68628	he	1458	" That is well ! be friends with him , "
68631	68647	68628	68628	he	1458	" he will carry you all the better to - morrow!—Now we must hurry home ! "
68658	68670	68671	68671	I	0	" May I not mount him at once , Mr. Raven ? "
68674	68679	68680	68680	he	1458	" By all means ! "
68683	68691	68680	68680	he	1458	" Mount , and ride him home . "
68723	68732	68733	68733	I	0	" He would outspeed any leopard in creation ! "
68736	68743	68745	68746	the raven	233	" Not that way at night , "
68748	68813	68745	68746	the raven	233	" the road is difficult.—But come ; loss now will be gain then ! To wait is harder than to run , and its meed is the fuller . Go on , my son — straight to the cottage . I shall be there as soon as you . It will rejoice my wife 's heart to see son of hers on that horse ! "
68827	68833	68835	68836	the raven	233	" Why do you linger ? "
68838	68849	68850	68850	I	0	" I long so much to ride after the leopardess , "
68853	68861	68850	68850	I	0	" that I can scarce restrain myself ! "
68862	68867	68835	68836	the raven	233	" You have promised ! "
68868	68889	68835	68836	the raven	233	" My debt to the Little Ones appears , I confess , a greater thing than my bond to you . "
68890	68908	68850	68850	I	0	" Yield to the temptation and you will bring mischief upon them — and on yourself also . "
68909	68930	68835	68836	the raven	233	" What matters it for me ? I love them ; and love works no evil . I will go . "
68982	68986	68987	68987	he	58	" Mr. Vane , "
68990	69005	68987	68987	he	58	" do you not know why you have not yet done anything worth doing ? "
69006	69014	69015	69015	I	0	" Because I have been a fool , "
69018	69021	68987	68987	he	58	" Wherein ? "

69027	69037	68987	68987	he	58	" Which do you count your most indiscreet action ? "
69038	69056	68987	68987	he	58	" Bringing the princess to life : I ought to have left her to her just fate . "
69057	69095	68987	68987	he	58	" Nay , now you talk foolishly ! You could not have done otherwise than you did , not knowing she was evil!—But you never brought any one to life ! How could you , yourself dead ? "
69096	69100	69101	69101	I	0	" I dead ? "
69104	69107	69108	69108	he	1463	" Yes , "
69111	69126	69108	69108	he	1463	" and you will be dead , so long as you refuse to die . "

69139	69149	69150	69150	he	1463	" Be persuaded , and go home with me , "
69154	69174	69150	69150	he	1463	" The most — nearly the only foolish thing you ever did , was to run from our dead . "

69294	69329	69291	69292	the raven	233	" think what you are doing ! Twice already has evil befallen you — once from fear , and once from heedlessness : breach of word is far worse ; it is a crime . "

74716	74880	74714	74714	Lona	44	" that , stupid as they are , the giants will search the wood , and they are gone to gather stones with which to receive them . Stones are not plentiful in the forest , and they have to scatter far to find enow . They will carry them to their nests , and from the trees attack the giants as they come within reach . Knowing their habits , they do not expect them before the morning . If they do come , it will be the opening of a war of expulsion : one or the other people must go . The result , however , is hardly doubtful . We do not mean to kill them ; indeed , their skulls are so thick that I do not think we could!—not that killing would do them much harm ; they are so little alive ! If one were killed , his giantess would not remember him beyond three days ! "
74881	74895	74896	74896	I	0	" Do the children then throw so well that the thing might happen ? "
74899	74906	74907	74907	she	1645	" Wait till you see them ! "
74916	74926	74927	74927	she	1645	" — But I have not yet told you , "
74931	75334	74927	74927	she	1645	" of a strange thing that happened the night before last!—We had come home from gathering our fruit , and were asleep in our nests , when we were roused by the horrid noises of beasts fighting . The moon was bright , and in a moment our trees glittered with staring little eyes , watching two huge leopardesses , one perfectly white , the other covered with black spots , which worried and tore each other with I do not know how many teeth and claws . To judge by her back , the spotted creature must have been climbing a tree when the other sprang upon her . When first I saw them , they were just under my own tree , rolling over and over each other . I got down on the lowest branch , and saw them perfectly . The children enjoyed the spectacle , siding some with this one , some with that , for we had never seen such beasts before , and thought they were only at play . But by degrees their roaring and growling almost ceased , and I saw that they were in deadly earnest , and heartily wished neither might be left able to climb a tree . But when the children saw the blood pouring from their flanks and throats , what do you think they did ? They scurried down to comfort them , and gathering in a great crowd about the terrible creatures , began to pat and stroke them . Then I got down as well , for they were much too absorbed to heed my calling to them ; but before I could reach them , the white one stopped fighting , and sprang among them with such a hideous yell that they flew up into the trees like birds . Before I got back into mine , the wicked beasts were at it again tooth and claw . Then Whitey had the best of it ; Spotty ran away as fast as she could run , and Whitey came and lay down at the foot of my tree . But in a minute or two she was up again , and walking about as if she thought Spotty might be lurking somewhere . I waked often , and every time I looked out , I saw her . In the morning she went away . "
75335	75342	75343	75343	I	0	" I know both the beasts , "
75346	75399	75343	75343	I	0	" Spotty is a bad beast . She hates the children , and would kill every one of them . But Whitey loves them . She ran at them only to frighten them away , lest Spotty should get hold of any of them . No one needs be afraid of Whitey ! "
76266	76275	76276	76276	she	44	" They are what they are without it ! "
76279	76292	76276	76276	she	44	" when we have the city , we will search for water ! "

77411	77451	77408	77408	she	1639	" their hearts will be taken by storm ; and I must be there encouraging them to make a stand ! If there be a remnant of hardihood in the place , it will be found among the women ! "

83078	83184	83003	83003	another	603	" He came down the hill very black , walking like a bad giant , but spread flat . He was nothing but blackness . We were frightened the moment we saw him , but we did not run away ; we stood and watched him . He came on as if he would walk over us . But before he reached us , he began to spread and spread , and grew bigger end bigger , till at last he was so big that he went out of our sight , and we saw him no more , and then he was upon us ! "
83185	83193	83054	83054	Odu	77	" What do you mean by that ? "
83194	83218	83003	83003	another	603	" He was all black through between us , and we could not see one another ; and then he was inside us . "

83288	83516	83285	83285	he	1999	" Really , deep down , it was Odu , loving you always ! And Odu came up , and knocked Naughty away . I grew sick , and thought I must kill myself to get out of the black . Then came a horrible laugh that had heard my think , and it set the air trembling about me . And then I suppose I ran away , but I did not know I had run away until I found myself running , fast as could , and all the rest running too . I would have stopped , but I never thought of it until I was out of the gate among the grass . Then I knew that I had run away from a shadow that wanted to be me and was n't , and that I was the Odu that loved Sozo . It was the shadow that got into me , and hated him from inside me ; it was not my own self me ! And now I know that I ought not to have run away ! But indeed I did not quite know what I was doing until it was done ! My legs did it , I think : they grew frightened , and forgot me , and ran away ! Naughty legs ! There ! and there ! "

86542	86548	86539	86539	I	0	" her face is covered ! "
86549	86555	86556	86556	they	2098	" She has no face ! "
86559	86579	86580	86580	I	0	" She has a very beautiful face . I saw it once.—It is indeed as beautiful as Lona 's ! "
86586	86594	86580	86580	I	0	" Then what makes her hide it ? "
86595	86609	86539	86539	I	0	" I think I know:—anyhow , she has some good reason for it ! "
86610	86624	86539	86539	I	0	" I do n't like the cat - woman ! she is frightful ! "
86625	86654	86580	86580	I	0	" You can not like , and you ought not to dislike what you have never seen.—Once more , you must not call her the cat - woman ! "
86655	86666	86539	86539	I	0	" What are we to call her then , please ? "
86667	86671	86539	86539	I	0	" Lady Mara . "
86672	86679	86681	86682	a girl	3101	" That is a pretty name ! "
86684	86704	86681	86682	a girl	3101	" I will call her ` lady Mara ' ; then perhaps she will show me her beautiful face ! "
86723	86727	86728	86728	she	36	" At last ! "
86731	86762	86728	86728	she	36	" Lilith 's hour has been long on the way , but it is come ! Everything comes . Thousands of years have I waited — and not in vain ! "
86839	86843	86844	86844	she	2103	" Mr. Vane , "
86847	86884	86844	86844	she	2103	" and you , Little Ones , I thank you ! This woman would not yield to gentler measures ; harder must have their turn . I must do what I can to make her repent ! "
86896	86907	86917	86917	her	2107	" Will you hurt her very much , lady Mara ? "
86924	86940	86942	86942	Mara	36	" Yes ; I am afraid I must ; I fear she will make me ! "
86944	86967	86942	86942	Mara	36	" It would be cruel to hurt her too little . It would have all to be done again , only worse . "
86968	86975	86917	86917	her	2107	" May I stop with her ? "
86976	87013	86942	86942	Mara	36	" No , my child . She loves no one , therefore she can not be with any one . There is One who will be with her , but she will not be with Him . "
87014	87027	86942	86942	Mara	36	" Will the shadow that came down the hill be with her ? "
87028	87068	86942	86942	Mara	36	" The great Shadow will be in her , I fear , but he can not be with her , or with any one . She will know I am beside her , but that will not comfort her . "
87069	87077	87079	87079	Odu	77	" Will you scratch her very deep ? "
87091	87102	87103	87103	She	2108	" Please , do n't make the red juice come ! "
87240	87252	87253	87253	she	36	" You must eat and drink before you go to sleep , "
87256	87264	87253	87253	she	36	" you have had a long journey ! "
88283	88299	88301	88301	Mara	36	" Will you turn away from the wicked things you have been doing so long ? "
88380	88385	88386	88386	she	1208	" I will not , "
88389	88398	88386	88386	she	1208	" I will be myself and not another ! "
88399	88418	89085	89086	the princess	3100	" Alas , you are another now , not yourself ! Will you not be your real self ? "
88419	88429	89085	89086	the princess	3100	" I will be what I mean myself now . "
88430	88451	88386	88386	she	1208	" If you were restored , would you not make what amends you could for the misery you have caused ? "
88452	88460	88386	88386	she	1208	" I would do after my nature . "
88461	88478	89085	89086	the princess	3100	" You do not know it : your nature is good , and you do evil ! "
88479	88493	88386	88386	she	1208	" I will do as my Self pleases — as my Self desires . "
88494	88508	88386	88386	she	1208	" You will do as the Shadow , overshadowing your Self inclines you ? "
88509	88519	88386	88386	she	1208	" I will do what I will to do . "
88520	88529	89085	89086	the princess	3100	" You have killed your daughter , Lilith ! "
88530	88541	88386	88386	she	1208	" I have killed thousands . She is my own ! "
88542	88553	88386	88386	she	1208	" She was never yours as you are another 's . "
88554	88572	89085	89086	the princess	3100	" I am not another 's ; I am my own , and my daughter is mine . "
88573	88583	88386	88386	she	1208	" Then , alas , your hour is come ! "
88584	88603	88386	88386	she	1208	" I care not . I am what I am ; no one can take from me myself ! "
88604	88613	89085	89086	the princess	3100	" You are not the Self you imagine . "
88614	88679	88386	88386	she	1208	" So long as I feel myself what it pleases me to think myself , I care not . I am content to be to myself what I would be . What I choose to seem to myself makes me what I am . My own thought makes me me ; my own thought of myself is me . Another shall not make me ! "
88680	88741	88386	88386	she	1208	" But another has made you , and can compel you to see what you have made yourself . You will not be able much longer to look to yourself anything but what he sees you ! You will not much longer have satisfaction in the thought of yourself . At this moment you are aware of the coming change ! "
88742	88796	88386	88386	she	1208	" No one ever made me . I defy that Power to unmake me from a free woman ! You are his slave , and I defy you ! You may be able to torture me — I do not know , but you shall not compel me to anything against my will ! "
88797	88864	89085	89086	the princess	3100	" Such a compulsion would be without value . But there is a light that goes deeper than the will , a light that lights up the darkness behind it : that light can change your will , can make it truly yours and not another's — not the Shadow 's . Into the created can pour itself the creating will , and so redeem it ! "
88865	88879	88386	88386	she	1208	" That light shall not enter me : I hate it!—Begone , slave ! "
88880	88937	88386	88386	she	1208	" I am no slave , for I love that light , and will with the deeper will which created mine . There is no slave but the creature that wills against its creator . Who is a slave but she who cries , ` I am free , ' yet can not cease to exist ! "
88938	88991	89085	89086	the princess	3100	" You speak foolishness from a cowering heart ! You imagine me given over to you : I defy you ! I hold myself against you ! What I choose to be , you can not change . I will not be what you think me — what you say I am ! "
88992	89001	88386	88386	she	1208	" I am sorry : you must suffer ! "
89002	89007	88386	88386	she	1208	" But be free ! "
89008	89076	89077	89077	She	2143	" She alone is free who would make free ; she loves not freedom who would enslave : she is herself a slave . Every life , every will , every heart that came within your ken , you have sought to subdue : you are the slave of every slave you have made — such a slave that you do not know it!—See your own self ! "
89440	89446	89448	89448	Mara	36	" She is seeing herself ! "
89569	89577	89578	89578	she	36	" You can not go near her , "
89581	89703	89578	89578	she	36	" She is far away from us , afar in the hell of her self - consciousness . The central fire of the universe is radiating into her the knowledge of good and evil , the knowledge of what she is . She sees at last the good she is not , the evil she is . She knows that she is herself the fire in which she is burning , but she does not know that the Light of Life is the heart of that fire . Her torment is that she is what she is . Do not fear for her ; she is not forsaken . No gentler way to help her was left . Wait and watch . "
89764	89771	89772	89772	she	36	" Will you change your way ? "
89777	89785	89787	89787	Lilith	66	" Why did he make me such ? "
89789	89856	89787	89787	Lilith	66	" I would have made myself — oh , so different ! I am glad it was he that made me and not I myself ! He alone is to blame for what I am ! Never would I have made such a worthless thing ! He meant me such that I might know it and be miserable ! I will not be made any longer ! "
89857	89863	89865	89865	Mara	36	" Unmake yourself , then , "
89867	89906	89865	89865	Mara	36	" Alas , I can not ! You know it , and mock me ! How often have I not agonised to cease , but the tyrant keeps me being ! I curse him!—Now let him kill me ! "
89918	89925	89927	89927	Mara	36	" Had he not made you , "
89933	89965	89927	89927	Mara	36	" you could not even hate him . But he did not make you such . You have made yourself what you are.—Be of better cheer : he can remake you . "
89966	89973	89865	89865	Mara	36	" I will not be remade ! "
89974	89991	89927	89927	Mara	36	" He will not change you ; he will only restore you to what you were . "
89992	90002	89927	89927	Mara	36	" I will not be aught of his making . "
90003	90019	89865	89865	Mara	36	" Are you not willing to have that set right which you have set wrong ? "
90029	90042	89927	89927	Mara	36	" If you are willing , put yourself again on the settle . "
90043	90048	90049	90049	she	36	" I will not , "
90396	90408	90409	90409	she	36	" Those , alas , are not the tears of repentance ! "
90412	90489	90490	90490	She	36	" The true tears gather in the eyes . Those are far more bitter , and not so good . Self - loathing is not sorrow . Yet it is good , for it marks a step in the way home , and in the father 's arms the prodigal forgets the self he abominates . Once with his father , he is to himself of no more account . It will be so with her . "
90496	90507	90490	90490	She	36	" Will you restore that which you have wrongfully taken ? "
90508	90514	90516	90517	the princess	3100	" I have taken nothing , "
90528	90546	90547	90547	Mara	36	" that I had not the right to take . My power to take manifested my right . "
90653	90659	90660	90660	she	3100	" For pity 's sake , "
90663	90674	90660	90660	she	3100	" tear my heart out , but let me live ! "
90893	90908	90879	90879	she	3100	" You have conquered . Let me go into the wilderness and bewail myself . "
90933	90947	90923	90923	She	36	" Begin , then , and set right in the place of wrong . "
90948	90954	90955	90955	she	3100	" I know not how , "
90970	90984	90923	90923	She	36	" Open thy hand , and let that which is in it go . "
91000	91005	91006	91006	she	3100	" I can not , "
91009	91022	91006	91006	she	3100	" I have no longer the power . Open it for me . "
91059	91066	91067	91067	she	3100	" You must open it yourself , "
91071	91080	91067	91067	she	3100	" I have told you I can not ! "
91081	91117	91023	91023	She	3100	" You can if you will — not indeed at once , but by persistent effort . What you have done , you do not yet wish undone — do not yet intend to undo ! "
91118	91127	91129	91130	the princess	3100	" You think so , I dare say , "
91137	91149	91067	91067	she	3100	" but I know that I can not open my hand ! "
91150	91213	91023	91023	She	3100	" I know you better than you know yourself , and I know you can . You have often opened it a little way . Without trouble and pain you can not open it quite , but you can open it . At worst you could beat it open ! I pray you , gather your strength , and open it wide . "
91214	91233	91067	91067	she	3100	" I will not try what I know impossible . It would be the part of a fool ! "
91234	91252	91023	91023	She	3100	" Which you have been playing all your life ! Oh , you are hard to teach ! "
91271	91330	91262	91262	She	3100	" I know what you have been tormenting me for ! You have not succeeded , nor shall you succeed ! You shall yet find me stronger than you think ! I will yet be mistress of myself ! I am still what I have always known myself — queen of Hell , and mistress of the worlds ! "
92047	92051	92053	92054	the princess	3100	" I yield , "
92056	92076	92053	92054	the princess	3100	" I can not hold out . I am defeated.—Not the less , I can not open my hand . "
92077	92082	92036	92036	She	66	" Have you tried ? "
92083	92093	92036	92036	She	66	" I am trying now with all my might . "
92094	92122	92053	92054	the princess	3100	" I will take you to my father . You have wronged him worst of the created , therefore he best of the created can help you . "
92123	92130	92036	92036	She	66	" How can he help me ? "
92131	92137	92036	92036	She	66	" He will forgive you . "
92138	92178	92053	92054	the princess	3100	" Ah , if he would but help me to cease ! Not even that am I capable of ! I have no power over myself ; I am a slave ! I acknowledge it . Let me die . "
92179	92192	92036	92036	She	66	" A slave thou art that shall one day be a child ! "
92194	92227	92053	92054	the princess	3100	Mara.—"Verily , thou shalt die , but not as thou thinkest . Thou shalt die out of death into life . Now is the Life for , that never was against thee ! "
92621	92627	92629	92629	one	2690	" The sky is falling ! "
92631	92642	92644	92644	another	603	" The white juice is running out of the princess ! "
92651	92656	92658	92658	Odu	77	" Is it rivers ? "
92672	92675	92677	92677	Mara	36	" Yes , "
92679	92688	92677	92677	Mara	36	" — the most wonderful of all rivers . "
92689	92710	92711	92711	he	77	" I thought rivers was bigger , and rushed , like a lot of Little Ones , making loud noises ! "
92727	92736	92738	92738	Mara	36	" Look at the rivers of the sky ! "
92740	92803	92738	92738	Mara	36	" See how they come down to wake up the waters under the earth ! Soon will the rivers be flowing everywhere , merry and loud , like thousands and thousands of happy children . Oh , how glad they will make you , Little Ones ! You have never seen any , and do not know how lovely is the water ! "
92804	92820	92822	92822	Odu	77	" That will be the glad of the ground that the princess is grown good , "
92824	92832	92822	92822	Odu	77	" See the glad of the sky ! "
92833	92843	92845	92845	Luva	81	" Are the rivers the glad of the princess ? "
92847	92860	92845	92845	Luva	81	" They are not her juice , for they are not red ! "
92861	92870	92872	92872	Mara	36	" They are the juice inside the juice , "
92891	92898	92900	92900	Luva	81	" Princess will not bite now ! "
92902	92912	92914	92914	Mara	36	" No ; she will never do that again , "
92916	92927	92914	92914	Mara	36	" — But now we must take her nearer home . "
92928	92934	92936	92936	Sozo	79	" Is that a nest ? "
92938	92956	92936	92936	Sozo	79	" Yes ; a very big nest . But we must take her to another place first . "
92957	92962	92914	92914	Mara	36	" What is that ? "
92963	92997	92914	92914	Mara	36	" It is the biggest room in all this world.—But I think it is going to be pulled down : it will soon be too full of little nests.—Go and get your clumsies . "
92998	93007	92936	92936	Sozo	79	" Please are there any cats in it ? "
93008	93027	92914	92914	Mara	36	" Not one . The nests are too full of lovely dreams for one cat to get in . "
93028	93037	93039	93039	Odu	77	" We shall be ready in a minute , "
93063	93072	93074	93074	Luva	81	" But her rivers are running so fast ! "
93092	93110	93074	93074	Luva	81	" Her robe is all — I do n't know what . Clumsies wo n't like it ! "
93111	93118	93120	93120	Mara	36	" They wo n't mind it , "
93122	93136	93120	93120	Mara	36	" Those rivers are so clean that they make the whole world clean . "
93159	93169	93171	93172	our hostess	2103	" It is time to mount , Mr. Vane , "
93174	93180	93181	93181	I	0	" Tell me , please , "
93184	93202	93181	93181	I	0	" is there not a way by which to avoid the channels and the den of monsters ? "
93203	93221	93222	93222	she	2103	" There is an easy way across the river - bed , which I will show you , "
93225	93236	93181	93181	I	0	" but you must pass once more through the monsters . "
93237	93244	93245	93245	I	0	" I fear for the children , "
93248	93257	93258	93258	she	2103	" Fear will not once come nigh them , "
93386	93395	93397	93399	a small boy	1849	" Why does the princess want to go ? "
93401	93411	93397	93399	a small boy	1849	" She would keep good if she staid here ! "
93412	93431	93433	93433	Mara	36	" She wants to go , and she does not want to go : we are helping her , "
93435	93443	93433	93433	Mara	36	" She will not keep good here . "
93444	93453	93454	93454	he	1849	" What are you helping her to do ? "
93458	93483	93454	93454	he	1849	" To go where she will get more help — help to open her hand , which has been closed for a thousand years . "
93484	93504	93433	93433	Mara	36	" So long ? Then she has learned to do without it : why should she open it now ? "
93505	93517	93433	93433	Mara	36	" Because it is shut upon something that is not hers . "
93518	93537	93539	93539	Luva	81	" Please , lady Mara , may we have some of your very dry bread before we go ? "
93556	93564	93565	93565	they	2207	" We will eat as we go , "
93576	93580	93584	93584	them	2207	" I think , "
93586	93600	93584	93584	them	2207	" it must be elephant - juice ! It makes me so strong ! "
93671	93679	93680	93680	she	89	" I have no burden to carry , "
93683	93692	93680	93680	she	89	" The children and I will walk together . "
93997	94001	94002	94002	I	0	" Little Ones , "
94005	94023	94002	94002	I	0	" keep your elephants close about the princess . Be brave ; they will not touch you . "
94024	94041	94042	94042	they	2965	" What will not touch us ? We do n't know what to be brave at ! "

94068	94073	94065	94065	I	0	" only keep close . "
94660	94667	94669	94669	Mara	36	" I fear she is dead ! "
94671	94679	94681	94682	the mother	1418	" I will send and find her , "
94684	94717	94669	94669	Mara	36	" But why , Mara , shouldst thou at all fear for her or for any one ? Death can not hurt her who dies doing the work given her to do . "
94718	94742	94781	94781	her	2247	" I shall miss her sorely ; she is good and wise . Yet I would not have her live beyond her hour ! "
94743	94768	94781	94781	her	2247	" She has gone down with the wicked ; she will rise with the righteous . We shall see her again ere very long . "
94769	94772	94773	94773	I	0	" Mother , "
94783	94807	94773	94773	I	0	" we come to you many , but most of us are Little Ones . Will you be able to receive us all ? "
94808	94815	94816	94816	she	2247	" You are welcome every one , "
94819	94877	94816	94816	she	2247	" Sooner or later all will be Little Ones , for all must sleep in my house ! It is well with those that go to sleep young and willing!—My husband is even now preparing her couch for Lilith . She is neither young nor quite willing , but it is well indeed that she is come . "
94946	94950	94953	94953	her	358	" Happy children , "
94956	94978	94953	94953	her	358	" to have looked already on the face of my daughter ! Surely it is the loveliest in the great world ! "
95072	95082	95083	95083	he	58	" We have long waited for thee , Lilith ! "
95101	95109	95111	95111	Eve	59	" The mortal foe of my children ! "
95119	95129	95131	95131	Mara	36	" Your children are no longer in her danger , "
95133	95140	95131	95131	Mara	36	" she has turned from evil . "
95141	95149	95151	95152	her mother	3293	" Trust her not hastily , Mara , "
95154	95161	95151	95152	her mother	3293	" she has deceived a multitude ! "
95162	95214	95131	95131	Mara	36	" But you will open to her the mirror of the Law of Liberty , mother , that she may go into it , and abide in it ! She consents to open her hand and restore : will not the great Father restore her to inheritance with His other children ? "
95215	95222	95224	95224	Lilith	66	" I do not know Him ! "
95234	95243	95245	95245	Adam	58	" Therefore it is that thou art miserable , "
95247	95256	95257	95257	she	66	" I will go back whence I came ! "
95270	95306	95131	95131	Mara	36	" That is indeed what I would have thee do , where I would have thee go — to Him from whom thou camest ! In thy agony didst thou not cry out for Him ? "
95307	95320	95131	95131	Mara	36	" I cried out for Death — to escape Him and thee ! "
95321	95419	95420	95420	She	2259	" Death is even now on his way to lead thee to Him . Thou knowest neither Death nor the Life that dwells in Death ! Both befriend thee . I am dead , and would see thee dead , for I live and love thee . Thou art weary and heavy - laden : art thou not ashamed ? Is not the being thou hast corrupted become to thee at length an evil thing ? Wouldst thou yet live on in disgrace eternal ? Cease thou canst not : wilt thou not be restored and be ? "
95427	95430	95432	95432	Mara	36	" Father , "
95434	95460	95432	95432	Mara	36	" take her in thine arms , and carry her to her couch . There she will open her hand , and die into life . "

95634	95643	95645	95645	Eve	59	" This food will help thee to die , "
95655	95666	95668	95668	Adam	58	" If thou wilt nor eat nor drink , Lilith , "
95670	95683	95668	95668	Adam	58	" come and see the place where thou shalt lie in peace . "
95748	95753	95755	95755	her	66	" It is he ! "
95764	95769	95770	95770	I	0	" Who , princess ? "
95773	95778	95779	95779	she	66	" The great Shadow , "
95782	95789	95791	95791	Adam	58	" Here he can not enter , "
95793	95809	95791	95791	Adam	58	" Here he can hurt no one . Over him also is power given me . "
95810	95818	95820	95820	Lilith	66	" Are the children in the house ? "
95835	95843	95844	95844	she	66	" He never dared touch a child , "
95847	95895	95844	95844	she	66	" Nor have you either ever hurt a child . Your own daughter you have but sent into the loveliest sleep , for she was already a long time dead when you slew her . And now Death shall be the atonemaker ; you shall sleep together . "
95896	95899	95901	95901	Adam	58	" Wife , "
95903	95920	95921	95921	He	58	" let us first put the children to bed , that she may see them safe ! "
95948	95975	95935	95936	the princess	3100	" Beautiful Eve , persuade your husband to kill me : to you he will listen ! Indeed I would but can not open my hand . "
95976	95993	95995	95995	Eve	59	" You can not die without opening it . To kill you would not serve you , "
95997	96038	95995	95995	Eve	59	" But indeed he can not ! no one can kill you but the Shadow ; and whom he kills never knows she is dead , but lives to do his will , and thinks she is doing her own . "
96039	96069	96070	96070	She	59	" Show me then to my grave ; I am so weary I can live no longer . I must go to the Shadow — yet I would not ! "
96128	96137	96140	96140	Eve	59	" You shall not go to the Shadow , "
96148	96158	96140	96140	Eve	59	" Even now is his head under my heel ! "
96302	96311	96313	96313	one	2690	" What a curious place to sleep in ! "
96315	96324	96313	96313	one	2690	" I would rather be in my nest ! "
96325	96331	96333	96333	another	603	" It is so cold ! "
96335	96342	96344	96345	our host	2286	" Yes , it is cold , "
96347	96358	96344	96345	our host	2286	" but you will not be cold in your sleep . "
96359	96365	96313	96313	one	2690	" Where are our nests ? "
96379	96389	96391	96391	Adam	58	" Find places , and sleep where you choose , "
96422	96425	96427	96427	one	2690	" Oh , "
96429	96452	96427	96427	one	2690	" here is such a beautiful lady!—may I sleep beside her ? I will creep in quietly , and not wake her . "
96453	96459	96464	96464	Eve	59	" Yes , you may , "
96535	96540	96541	96541	he	2288	" Mother ! mother ! "
96554	96565	96566	96566	he	2288	" — She 's so cold she ca n't speak , "
96574	96583	96566	96566	he	2288	" but I will soon make her warm ! "
96639	96648	96649	96649	she	81	" My own mother would n't have me , "
96653	96657	96649	96649	she	81	" will you ? "
96798	96812	96783	96783	Adam	58	" There , Lilith , is the bed I have prepared for you ! "
96838	96844	96845	96845	she	59	" How cold it is ! "
96848	96860	96862	96862	Adam	58	" You will soon begin to find comfort in the cold , "
96864	96872	96873	96873	she	59	" Promises to the dying are easy ! "
96876	96891	96873	96873	she	59	" But I know it : I too have slept . I am dead ! "
96892	96906	96960	96960	Lona	44	" I believed you dead long ago ; but I see you alive ! "
96907	96947	96960	96960	Lona	44	" More alive than you know , or are able to understand . I was scarce alive when first you knew me . Now I have slept , and am awake ; I am dead , and live indeed ! "
96948	96954	96955	96955	she	59	" I fear that child , "
96962	96970	96955	96955	she	59	" she will rise and terrify me ! "
96971	96979	96960	96960	Lona	44	" She is dreaming love to you . "
96980	96985	96986	96986	she	59	" But the Shadow ! "
96989	97002	96986	96986	she	59	" I fear the Shadow ! he will be wroth with me ! "
97003	97027	96960	96960	Lona	44	" He at sight of whom the horses of heaven start and rear , dares not disturb one dream in this quiet chamber ! "
97028	97034	96960	96960	Lona	44	" I shall dream then ? "
97035	97040	96986	96986	she	59	" You will dream . "
97041	97045	96960	96960	Lona	44	" What dreams ? "
97046	97085	96960	96960	Lona	44	" That I can not tell , but none he can enter into . When the Shadow comes here , it will be to lie down and sleep also.—His hour will come , and he knows it will . "
97086	97093	96986	96986	she	59	" How long shall I sleep ? "
97094	97111	96960	96960	Lona	44	" You and he will be the last to wake in the morning of the universe . "
97145	97148	97150	97150	Mara	36	" Lilith , "
97152	97186	97150	97150	Mara	36	" you will not sleep , if you lie there a thousand years , until you have opened your hand , and yielded that which is not yours to give or to withhold . "
97187	97192	97193	97193	she	2308	" I can not , "
97196	97221	97193	97193	she	2308	" I would if I could , and gladly , for I am weary , and the shadows of death are gathering about me . "
97222	97288	97150	97150	Mara	36	" They will gather and gather , but they can not infold you while yet your hand remains unopened . You may think you are dead , but it will be only a dream ; you may think you have come awake , but it will still be only a dream . Open your hand , and you will sleep indeed — then wake indeed . "
97289	97306	97150	97150	Mara	36	" I am trying hard , but the fingers have grown together and into the palm . "
97307	97334	97193	97193	she	2308	" I pray you put forth the strength of your will . For the love of life , draw together your forces and break its bonds ! "
97335	97361	97150	97150	Mara	36	" I have struggled in vain ; I can do no more . I am very weary , and sleep lies heavy upon my lids . "
97362	97382	97193	97193	she	2308	" The moment you open your hand , you will sleep . Open it , and make an end . "
97413	97418	97420	97421	her father	2015	" Hold , Mara ! "
97423	97428	97420	97421	her father	2015	" There is danger ! "
97439	97453	97454	97454	she	3100	" There was a sword I once saw in your husband 's hands , "
97457	97482	97454	97454	she	3100	" I fled when I saw it . I heard him who bore it say it would divide whatever was not one and indivisible ! "
97483	97489	97491	97491	Adam	58	" I have the sword , "
97493	97505	97491	97491	Adam	58	" The angel gave it me when he left the gate . "
97506	97512	97514	97514	Lilith	66	" Bring it , Adam , "
97516	97528	97514	97514	Lilith	66	" and cut me off this hand that I may sleep . "
97529	97533	97534	97534	he	58	" I will , "
97682	97690	97691	97691	I	0	" Will you not dress the wound ? "
97694	97701	97703	97703	Adam	58	" A wound from that sword , "
97705	97717	97703	97703	Adam	58	" needs no dressing . It is healing and not hurt . "
97718	97722	97723	97723	I	0	" Poor lady ! "
97726	97735	97723	97723	I	0	" she will wake with but one hand ! "
97736	97743	97745	97745	Mara	36	" Where the dead deformity clung , "
97747	97757	97745	97745	Mara	36	" the true , lovely hand is already growing . "
97803	97810	97814	97814	them	2315	" How beautiful she is grown ! "
97816	97820	97822	97822	another	603	" Poor princess ! "
97824	97838	97822	97822	another	603	" I will sleep with her . She will not bite any more ! "
97861	97870	97872	97873	the third	2317	" I will go on her other side , "
97875	97887	97872	97873	the third	2317	" She shall have two to kiss her when she wakes ! "
97888	97895	97897	97898	the first	639	" And I am left alone ! "
97901	97909	97911	97911	Eve	59	" I will put you to bed , "
97989	97997	98000	98000	Eve	59	" Ah , you have found her ! "
98027	98035	98036	98036	she	59	" I sent them with the lantern , "
98043	98056	98036	98036	she	59	" to look for Mara 's leopardess : they have brought her . "
98136	98203	98129	98129	I	0	" Mother , one couch next to Lona is empty : I know I am unworthy , but may I not sleep this night in your chamber with my dead ? Will you not pardon both my cowardice and my self - confidence , and take me in ? I give me up . I am sick of myself , and would fain sleep the sleep ! "
98204	98218	98219	98219	she	2334	" The couch next to Lona is the one already prepared for you , "
98222	98233	98219	98219	she	2334	" but something waits to be done ere you sleep . "
98234	98239	98240	98240	I	0	" I am ready , "
98243	98253	98254	98254	she	2334	" How do you know you can do it ? "
98260	98266	98267	98267	I	0	" Because you require it , "
98270	98275	98276	98276	She	2334	" What is it ? "
98281	98288	98276	98276	She	2334	" Is he forgiven , husband ? "
98289	98294	98276	98276	She	2334	" From my heart . "
98295	98305	98306	98306	Adam	58	" Then tell him what he has to do . "
98312	98323	98324	98324	She	2334	" Give me that hand , Mara , my child . "
98339	98347	98348	98348	he	58	" Let us go to the cottage , "
98353	98360	98348	98348	he	58	" there I will instruct you . "
98415	98420	98421	98421	he	58	" You will remember , "
98424	98727	98421	98421	he	58	" how , after leaving my daughter 's house , you came to a dry rock , bearing the marks of an ancient cataract ; you climbed that rock , and found a sandy desert : go to that rock now , and from its summit walk deep into the desert . But go not many steps ere you lie down , and listen with your head on the sand . If you hear the murmur of water beneath , go a little farther , and listen again . If you still hear the sound , you are in the right direction . Every few yards you must stop , lie down , and hearken . If , listening thus , at any time you hear no sound of water , you are out of the way , and must hearken in every direction until you hear it again . Keeping with the sound , and careful not to retrace your steps , you will soon hear it louder , and the growing sound will lead you to where it is loudest : that is the spot you seek . There dig with the spade I will give you , and dig until you come to moisture : in it lay the hand , cover it to the level of the desert , and come home.—But give good heed , and carry the hand with care . Never lay it down , in what place of seeming safety soever ; let nothing touch it ; stop nor turn aside for any attempt to bar your way ; never look behind you ; speak to no one , answer no one , walk straight on.—It is yet dark , and the morning is far distant , but you must set out at once . "
98740	98747	98748	98748	he	2338	" This is my gardening spade , "
98751	98765	98748	98748	he	2338	" with it I have brought many a lovely thing to the sun . "
98996	99003	99005	99006	the princess	3100	" Have you forgotten me already ? "
99024	99062	99063	99063	I	0	" You meant then to leave me in that horrible sepulchre ! Do you not yet understand that where I please to be , there I am ? Take my hand : I am alive as you ! "
99071	99078	99063	99063	I	0	" Give me your left hand , "
99091	99097	99098	99098	she	3100	" Give me my hand , "
99102	99115	99098	99098	she	3100	" or I will tear you in pieces : you are mine ! "
99263	99266	99267	99267	she	3100	" Ah , "
99270	99354	99267	99267	she	3100	" you are come at last ! I have waited here for you an hour or more ! You have done well ! Your trial is over . My father sent me to meet you that you might have a little rest on the way . Give me your charge , and lay your head in my lap ; I will take good care of both until the sun is well risen . I am not bitterness always , neither to all men ! "
100133	100140	100141	100141	I	0	" What ails you , sir ? "
100144	100149	100141	100141	I	0	" Are you forsaken ? "
100150	100154	100155	100155	he	2376	" I weep , "
100158	100202	100155	100155	he	2376	" because they will not let me die . I have been to the house of death , and its mistress , notwithstanding my years , refuses me . Intercede for me , sir , if you know her , I pray you . "
100203	100208	100209	100209	I	0	" Nay , sir , "
100212	100231	100209	100209	I	0	" that I can not ; for she refuses none whom it is lawful for her to receive . "
100232	100255	100155	100155	he	2376	" How know you this of her ? You have never sought death ! you are much too young to desire it ! "
100256	100276	100155	100155	he	2376	" I fear your words may indicate that , were you young again , neither would you desire it . "
100277	100296	100209	100209	I	0	" Indeed , young sir , I would not ! and certain I am that you can not . "
100297	100368	100155	100155	he	2376	" I may not be old enough to desire to die , but I am young enough to desire to live indeed ! Therefore I go now to learn if she will at length take me in . You wish to die because you do not care to live : she will not open her door to you , for no one can die who does not long to live . "
100369	100388	100155	100155	he	2376	" It ill becomes your youth to mock a friendless old man . Pray , cease your riddles ! "
100389	100403	100209	100209	I	0	" Did not then the Mother tell you something of the same sort ? "
100404	100421	100209	100209	I	0	" In truth I believe she did ; but I gave little heed to her excuses . "
100422	100429	100430	100430	I	0	" Ah , then , sir , "
100433	100577	100430	100430	I	0	" it is but too plain you have not yet learned to die , and I am heartily grieved for you . Such had I too been but for the Lady of Sorrow . I am indeed young , but I have wept many tears ; pardon me , therefore , if I presume to offer counsel:—Go to the Lady of Sorrow , and ` take with both hands ' what she will give you . Yonder lies her cottage . She is not in it now , but her door stands open , and there is bread and water on her table . Go in ; sit down ; eat of the bread ; drink of the water ; and wait there until she appear . Then ask counsel of her , for she is true , and her wisdom is great . "

101212	101252	101188	101188	her	44	" I can not rest until you are with me , gliding down the river to the great sea , and the beautiful dream - land . The sleepiness is full of lovely things : come and see them . "
101253	101259	101260	101260	I	0	" Ah , my darling ! "
101263	101273	101260	101260	I	0	" Had I but known!—I thought you were dead ! "
101300	101314	101287	101287	She	44	sighed—"Carry me back to my bed , king . I want to sleep . "
101349	101354	101355	101355	she	44	" Lay me down , "
101358	101390	101355	101355	she	44	" and cover me from the warm air ; it hurts — a little . Your bed is there , next to mine . I shall see you when I wake . "
101415	101421	101422	101422	I	0	" Come , sweet cold , "
101425	101432	101422	101422	I	0	" and still my heart speedily . "
101490	101508	101509	101509	he	58	" We have been to the top of the hill to hear the waters on their way , "
101512	101533	101509	101509	he	58	" They will be in the den of the monsters to - night.—But why did you not await our return ? "
101534	101541	101542	101542	I	0	" My child could not sleep , "
101545	101551	101552	101552	he	58	" She is fast asleep ! "
101555	101560	101561	101561	I	0	" Yes , now ! "
101564	101575	101561	101561	I	0	" but she was awake when I laid her down . "
101576	101584	101585	101585	he	58	" She was asleep all the time ! "
101588	101601	101585	101585	he	58	" She was perhaps dreaming about you — and came to you ? "
101602	101606	101561	101561	I	0	" She did . "
101607	101619	101561	101561	I	0	" And did you not see that her eyes were closed ? "
101620	101630	101561	101561	I	0	" Now I think of it , I did . "
101631	101652	101561	101561	I	0	" If you had looked ere you laid her down , you would have seen her asleep on the couch . "
101653	101660	101561	101561	I	0	" That would have been terrible ! "
101661	101676	101561	101561	I	0	" You would only have found that she was no longer in your arms . "
101677	101684	101561	101561	I	0	" That would have been worse ! "
101685	101705	101561	101561	I	0	" It is , perhaps , to think of ; but to see it would not have troubled you . "
101706	101710	101711	101711	I	0	" Dear father , "
101714	101743	101711	101711	I	0	" how is it that I am not sleepy ? I thought I should go to sleep like the Little Ones the moment I laid my head down ! "
101744	101760	101561	101561	I	0	" Your hour is not quite come . You must have food ere you sleep . "
101761	101791	101561	101561	I	0	" Ah , I ought not to have lain down without your leave , for I can not sleep without your help ! I will get up at once ! "
101804	101816	101817	101817	he	2395	" There is no need : we will serve you here , "
101820	101831	101817	101817	he	2395	" — You do not feel cold , do you ? "
101832	101847	101848	101848	He	2395	" Not too cold to lie still , but perhaps too cold to eat ! "
102022	102037	102038	102038	I	0	" You are good indeed , father Adam , mother Eve , sister Mara , "
102041	102055	102038	102038	I	0	" to receive me ! In my soul I am ashamed and sorry ! "
102056	102064	102066	102066	Eve	59	" We knew you would come again ! "
102068	102075	102076	102076	I	0	" How could you know it ? "
102079	102094	102096	102096	Mara	36	" Because here was I , born to look after my brothers and sisters ! "

102152	102161	102162	102162	he	58	" There is no early or late here , "
102165	102226	102162	102162	he	58	" For him the true time then first begins who lays himself down . Men are not coming home fast ; women are coming faster . A desert , wide and dreary , parts him who lies down to die from him who lies down to live . The former may well make haste , but here is no haste . "
102227	102232	102234	102234	Eve	59	" To our eyes , "
102236	102256	102234	102234	Eve	59	" you were coming all the time : we knew Mara would find you , and you must come ! "
102257	102268	102269	102269	I	0	" How long is it since my father lay down ? "
102272	102287	102289	102289	Adam	58	" I have told you that years are of no consequence in this house , "
102291	102319	102289	102289	Adam	58	" we do not heed them . Your father will wake when his morning comes . Your mother , next to whom you are lying , — — "
102320	102330	102331	102331	I	0	" Ah , then , it is my mother ! "
102334	102343	102344	102344	he	58	" Yes — she with the wounded hand , "
102347	102362	102344	102344	he	58	" — she will be up and away long ere your morning is ripe . "
102363	102368	102289	102289	Adam	58	" I am sorry . "
102369	102374	102289	102289	Adam	58	" Rather be glad . "
102375	102392	102344	102344	he	58	" It must be a sight for God Himself to see such a woman come awake ! "
102393	102430	102431	102431	He	58	" It is indeed a sight for God , a sight that makes her Maker glad ! He sees of the travail of His soul , and is satisfied!—Look at her once more , and sleep . "
102444	102450	102451	102451	I	0	" She looks much younger ! "
102454	102460	102461	102461	he	58	" She is much younger , "
102464	102473	102461	102461	he	58	" Even Lilith already begins to look younger ! "
102481	102490	102491	102491	he	58	" But when you see your mother again , "
102494	102564	102491	102491	he	58	" you will not at first know her . She will go on steadily growing younger until she reaches the perfection of her womanhood — a splendour beyond foresight . Then she will open her eyes , behold on one side her husband , on the other her son — and rise and leave them , to go to a father and a brother more to her than they . "

104376	104424	104373	104373	I	0	" where is she ? Where are the dead ? Is the great resurrection come and gone ? The terror of my loneliness was upon me ; I could not sleep without my dead ; I ran from the desolate chamber.—Whither shall I go to find them ? "

104445	104470	104433	104433	he	58	" You are still in the chamber of death , still upon your couch , asleep and dreaming , with the dead around you . "
104471	104497	104373	104373	I	0	" Alas ! when I but dream how am I to know it ? The dream best dreamed is the likest to the waking truth ! "
104498	104532	104373	104373	I	0	" When you are quite dead , you will dream no false dream . The soul that is true can generate nothing that is not true , neither can the false enter it . "
104533	104538	104539	104539	I	0	" But , sir , "
104542	104560	104539	104539	I	0	" how am I to distinguish betwixt the true and the false where both alike seem real ? "
104561	104567	104568	104568	he	58	" Do you not understand ? "
104586	104649	104373	104373	I	0	" You can not perfectly distinguish between the true and the false while you are not yet quite dead ; neither indeed will you when you are quite dead — that is , quite alive , for then the false will never present itself . At this moment , believe me , you are on your bed in the house of death . "
104650	104681	104539	104539	I	0	" I am trying hard to believe you , father . I do indeed believe you , although I can neither see nor feel the truth of what you say . "
104682	104738	104739	104739	I	0	" You are not to blame that you can not . And because even in a dream you believe me , I will help you.—Put forth your left hand open , and close it gently : it will clasp the hand of your Lona , who lies asleep where you lie dreaming you are awake . "
104759	104764	104765	104765	I	0	" But , father , "
104768	104773	104765	104765	I	0	" she is warm ! "
104774	104815	104539	104539	I	0	" Your hand is as warm to hers . Cold is a thing unknown in our country . Neither she nor you are yet in the fields of home , but each to each is alive and warm and healthful . "

104838	104869	104835	104835	I	0	" forgive me , but how am I to know surely that this also is not a part of the lovely dream in which I am now walking with thyself ? "
104870	105127	104765	104765	I	0	" Thou doubtest because thou lovest the truth . Some would willingly believe life but a phantasm , if only it might for ever afford them a world of pleasant dreams : thou art not of such ! Be content for a while not to know surely . The hour will come , and that ere long , when , being true , thou shalt behold the very truth , and doubt will be for ever dead . Scarce , then , wilt thou be able to recall the features of the phantom . Thou wilt then know that which thou canst not now dream . Thou hast not yet looked the Truth in the face , hast as yet at best but seen him through a cloud . That which thou seest not , and never didst see save in a glass darkly — that which , indeed , never can be known save by its innate splendour shining straight into pure eyes — that thou canst not but doubt , and art blameless in doubting until thou seest it face to face , when thou wilt no longer be able to doubt it . But to him who has once seen even a shadow only of the truth , and , even but hoping he has seen it when it is present no longer , tries to obey it — to him the real vision , the Truth himself , will come , and depart no more , but abide with him for ever . "

105147	105230	104765	104765	I	0	" Then remember , and recall . Trials yet await thee , heavy , of a nature thou knowest not now . Remember the things thou hast seen . Truly thou knowest not those things , but thou knowest what they have seemed , what they have meant to thee ! Remember also the things thou shalt yet see . Truth is all in all ; and the truth of things lies , at once hid and revealed , in their seeming . "
105231	105239	105240	105240	I	0	" How can that be , father ? "
106253	106260	106261	106261	I	0	" I must die one day , "
106264	106311	106261	106261	I	0	" and then , straight from my death - bed , I will set out to find her ! If she is not , I will go to the Father and say—`Even thou canst not help me : let me cease , I pray thee ! ' "

106535	106540	106541	106541	she	1418	" I woke first ! "

106561	106570	106571	106571	she	1418	" I only looked at you and waited , "

106651	106657	106658	106658	she	1418	" It is but begun , "

106884	106930	106931	106931	She	1418	" Pure life has no weakness to grow weary withal . The Life keeps generating ours.—Those who will not die , die many times , die constantly , keep dying deeper , never have done dying ; here all is upwardness and love and gladness . "
