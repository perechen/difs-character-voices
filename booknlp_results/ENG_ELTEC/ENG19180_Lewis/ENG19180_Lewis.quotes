269	275	240	241	Italian models	382	“ Grands messieurs Du Berne . ”
418	466	469	469	Tarr	122	“ Why can not most people , having talked and annoyed each other once or twice , rebecome strangers simply ? Oh , for multitudes of divorces in our moeurs , more than the old vexed sex ones ! Ah , yes : ah , yes — ! ”
478	485	486	486	Tarr	122	“ Have you been back long ? ”
492	500	502	502	Hobson	121	“ No . I got back yesterday , ”
510	525	502	502	Hobson	121	“ Heavens : One day here only , and lo ! I meet him . ”
527	535	502	502	Hobson	121	“ How is London looking , then ? ”
536	559	502	502	Hobson	121	“ Very much as usual . — I was n’t there the whole time . — I was in Cambridge last week . ”
561	589	590	590	Tarr	122	“ I wish you ’d go to perdition from time to time , instead of Cambridge , as it always is , you grim , grim dog ! ”
662	667	685	685	They	394	“ Phew , phew ! ”
1232	1248	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ Well , Walt Whitman , when are you going to get your hair cut ? ”
1249	1258	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ Why do you call me Walt Whitman ? ”
1259	1271	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ Would you prefer Buffalo Bill ? Or is it Shakespeare ? ”
1272	1277	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ It is not Shakespeare---- ”
1278	1335	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ ‘ Roi je ne suis : prince je ne daigne . ’ — That ’s Hobson ’s choice . — But why so much hair ? I do n’t wear my hair long . If you had as many reasons for wearing it long as I have , we should see it flowing round your ankles ”
1336	1387	1388	1388	Tarr	122	“ I might ask you under those circumstances why you wear it short . But I expect you have good reasons for that , too . I ca n’t see why you should resent my innocent device . However long I wore it I should not damage you by my competition---- ”
1403	1410	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ Toute suite , toute suite ! ”
1411	1432	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ Hobson , you were telling me about a studio to let before you left . — I forget the details---- ”
1433	1441	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ Was it one behind the Panthéon ? ”
1442	1453	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ That ’s it . — Was there electric light ? ”
1454	1474	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ No , I do n’t think there was electric light . But I can find out for you . ”
1475	1485	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ How did you come to hear of it ? ”
1486	1500	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ Through a German I know — Salle , Salla , or something . ”
1501	1507	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ What was the street ? ”
1508	1518	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ The Rue Lhomond . I forget the number . ”
1519	1544	1545	1545	Tarr	122	“ I ’ll go and have a look at it after lunch . — What on earth possesses you to know so many Germans ? ”
1550	1573	1545	1545	Tarr	122	“ Do n’t you like Germans ? — You ’ve just been too intimate with one : that ’s what it is . ”
1574	1579	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ Perhaps I have . ”
1580	1585	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ A female German . ”
1586	1597	1545	1545	Tarr	122	“ The sex weakens the ‘ German , ’ surely . ”
1598	1607	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ Does it in Fräulein Lunken ’s case ? ”
1608	1633	1217	1217	Tarr	122	“ Oh , you know her , do you ? — Of course , you would know her , as she ’s a German . ”
1778	1780	1770	1770	he	122	“ CarrionCrow ”
1788	1795	1770	1770	he	122	“ The olde Crow of Cairo , ”
1824	1915	1821	1821	Hobson	121	“ It seems to me , Tarr , that you know more Germans than I do . But you 're ashamed of it . Hence your attack . I met a Fräulein Fierspitz the other day , a German , who claimed to know you . I am always meeting Germans who know you . She also referred to you as the ‘ official fiancé ’ of Fräulein Lunken . — Are you an ‘ official fiancé ’ ? And if so , what is that , may I ask ? ”
1942	2005	1934	1934	he	121	“ You not only get to know Germans , crowds of them , on the sly ; you make your bosom friend of them , engage yourself to them in marriage and make Heaven knows how many more solemn pacts , covenants , and agreements . — It ’s bound all to come out some day . What will you do then ? ”
2081	2086	2087	2087	he	122	“ As you know , ”
2091	2119	2087	2087	he	122	“ ‘ engagement ’ is an euphemism . And , as a matter of fact , my girl publicly announced the breaking off of our engagement yesterday . ”
2152	2240	2148	2148	his	121	“ Yes , it is funny , if you look at it in that way . — I let her announce our engagement or the reverse just as she likes . That has been our arrangement from the start . I never know at any given time whether I am engaged or not . I leave all that sort of thing entirely in her hands . After a severe quarrel I am pretty certain that I am temporarily unattached , the link publicly severed somewhere or other . ”
2241	2254	2143	2143	Hobson	121	“ Possibly that is what is meant by ‘ official fiancé ’ ? ”
2255	2259	2260	2260	He	122	“ Very likely . ”
2392	2432	2433	2433	He	122	“ Ay , I have this the matter with me — a funny complaint ? — and that , and that , too . — What then ? — Do you want me to race you to that hill ? ”
2454	2471	2472	2472	Hobson	121	“ Will you go so far in this clandestine life of yours as to marry anybody ? ”
2475	2478	2472	2472	Hobson	121	“ No . ”
2489	2507	2508	2508	he	121	“ I think there must be a great difference between your way of approaching Germans and mine , ”
2511	2525	2508	2508	he	121	“ Ay : it is different things that takes us respectively amongst them . ”
2526	2537	2472	2472	Hobson	121	“ You like the national flavour , all the same . ”
2539	2546	2548	2548	Tarr	122	“ I like the national flavour ! ”
2592	2675	2580	2580	his	122	“ Sex is nationalized more than any other essential of life . In this it is just the opposite to art . — There is much pork and philosophy in German sex . — But then if it is the sex you are after , it does not say you want to identify your being with your appetite . Quite the opposite . The condition of continued enjoyment is to resist assimilation . — A man is the opposite of his appetite . ”
2676	2685	2580	2580	his	122	“ Surely , a man is his appetite . ”
2686	2763	2580	2580	his	122	“ No , a man is always his last appetite , or his appetite before last ; and that is no longer an appetite . — But nobody is anything , or life would be intolerable , the human race collapse . — You are me , I am you . — The Present is the furthest projection of our steady appetite . Imagination , like a general , keeps behind . Imagination is the man . ”
2764	2770	2771	2771	Hobson	121	“ What is the Present ? ”
2799	2996	2796	2796	He	122	“ Sex is a monstrosity . It is the arch abortion of this filthy universe . — How ‘ old - fashioned ! ’ — eh , my fashionable friend ? — We are all optimists to - day , are n’t we ? God ’s in his Heaven , all ’s well with the world ! I am a pessimist , Hobson . But I ’m a new sort of pessimist . — I think I am the sort that will please ! — I am the Panurgic - Pessimist , drunken with the laughing - gas of the Abyss . I gaze on squalor and idiocy , and the more I see it , the more I like it . — Flaubert built up his Bouvard et Pecuchet with maniacal and tireless hands . It took him ten years . That was a long draught of stodgy laughter from the gases that rise from the dung - heap ? He had an appetite like an elephant for this form of mirth . But he grumbled and sighed over his food . — I take it in my arms and bury my face in it ! ”
3110	3118	3121	3121	He	122	“ I bury my face in it ! ”
3131	3194	3121	3121	He	122	“ I laugh hoarsely through its thickness , choking and spitting ; coughing , sneezing , blowing . — People will begin to think I am an alligator if they see me always swimming in their daily ooze . As far as sex is concerned , I am that . Sex , Hobson , is a German study . A German study . ”
3225	3339	3210	3210	He	122	“ All the same , you must take my word for much in that connexion . — The choice of a wife is not practical in the way that the securing of a good bicycle , hygiene , or advertisement is . You must think more of the dishes of the table . Rembrandt paints decrepit old Jews , the most decayed specimens of the lowest race on earth , that is . Shakespeare deals in human tubs of grease — Falstaff ; Christ in sinners . Now as to sex ; Socrates married a shrew ; most of the wisest men marry fools , picture post cards , cows , or strumpets . ”
3340	3350	3353	3353	himself	121	“ I do n’t think that is quite true . ”
3356	3383	3353	3353	himself	121	“ The more sensible people I can think of off - hand have more sensible , and on the whole prettier , wives than other people . ”
3384	3439	3440	3440	Hobson	121	“ Prettier wives ? — You are describing a meaningless average . — The most suspicious fact about a distinguished man is the possession of a distinguished wife . But you might just as well say in answer to my Art statement that Sir Edward Leighton did not paint the decayed meat of humanity . ”
3464	3481	3452	3452	He	121	“ Neither did Raphael — I do n’t see why you should drag Rembrandt in — Rembrandt--- ”
3482	3525	3526	3526	Hobson	121	“ You ’re going to sniff at Rembrandt ! — You accuse me of following the fashions in my liking for Cubism . You are much more fashionable yourself . Would you mind my ‘ dragging in ’ cheese , high game---- ? ”
3550	3560	3561	3561	he	121	“ It is not purely a question of appetite , ”
3564	3576	3577	3577	Tarr	122	“ Sex , sir , is purely a question of appetite ! ”
3590	3600	3601	3601	Tarr	122	“ If it is pure sex , that is , ”
3604	3616	3601	3601	Tarr	122	“ Oh , if it is pure sex — that , naturally---- ”
3624	3665	3619	3619	himself	121	“ Listen , Hobson ! — You must n’t make that noise . It ’s very clever of you to be able to . But you will not succeed in rattling me by making me feel I am addressing a rooster---- ”
3693	3705	3690	3690	Tarr	122	“ Are you willing to consider sex seriously , or not ? ”
3706	3714	3716	3716	Hobson	121	“ Yes , I do n’t mind . ”
3729	3760	3716	3716	Hobson	121	“ But I shall begin to believe before very long that your intentions are honourable as regards the fair Fräulein . — What exactly is your discourse intended to prove ? ”
3761	3839	3690	3690	Tarr	122	“ Not the desirability of the marriage tie , any more than a propaganda for representation and anecdote in art . But if a man marries , or a great painter represents ( and the claims and seductions of life are very urgent ) , he will not be governed in his choice by the same laws that regulate the life of an efficient citizen , a successful merchant , or the ideals of a health expert . ”
3840	3867	3690	3690	Tarr	122	“ I should have said that the considerations that precede a proposition of marriage had many analogies with the health expert ’s outlook , the good citizen’s----- ”
3868	3931	3690	3690	Tarr	122	“ Was Napoleon successful in life , or did he ruin himself and end his days in miserable captivity ? — Passion precludes the idea of success . Failure is its condition . — Art and Sex when they are deep enough make tragedies , and not advertisements for Health experts , or happy endings for the Public , or social panaceas . ”
3932	3939	3690	3690	Tarr	122	“ Alas , that is true . ”
3940	3969	3690	3690	Tarr	122	“ Well , then , well , then , Alan Hobson , vou scarecrow of an advanced fool - farm , deplorable pedant of a sophistic voice - culture---- ”
3970	3986	3987	3987	Hobson	121	“ I ? My voice — ? But that ’s absurd ! — If my speech---- ”
4154	4807	4150	4152	a humble investor	439	“ But we ’re talking at cross purposes , Hobson . — You think I am contending that affection for a dolt , like my fiancée , is in some way a merit . I do not mean that . Also , I do not mean that sex is my tragedy , but art . — I will explain why I am associated sexually with this pumpkin . First , I am an artist . — With most people , not describable as artists , all the finer part of their vitality goes into sex . They become third - rate poets during their courtship . All their instincts of drama come out freshly with their wives . The artist is he in whom this emotionality normally absorbed by sex is so strong that it claims a newer and more exclusive field of deployment . — Its first creation is the Artist himself , a new sort of person ; the creative man . But for the first - rate poet , nothing short of a Queen or a Chimera is adequate for the powers of his praise . — And so on all through the bunch of his gifts . One by one his powers and moyens are turned away from the usual object of a man ’s poetry , and turned away from the immediate world . One solitary thing is left facing a woman . — That is his sex , a lonely phallus . — Things are not quite so simple in actual fact as this . Some artists are less complete than others . More or less remains to the man . — Then the character of the artist ’s creation comes in . What tendency has my work as an artist , a ready instance ? You may have noticed that it has that of an invariable severity . Apart from its being good or bad , its character is ascetic rather than sensuous , and divorced from immediate life . There is no slop of sex in that . But there is no severity left over for the work of the cruder senses either . Very often with an artist whose work is very sensuous or human , his sex instinct , if it is active , will be more discriminating than with a man more fastidious and discriminating than he in his work . To sum up this part of my disclosure . — No one could have a coarser , more foolish , slovenly taste than I have in women . It is not even sluttish and abject , of the J. W. M. Turner type , with his washerwoman at Gravesend . — It is bourgeois , banal , pretty - pretty , a cross between the Musical Comedy stage and the ideal of the Eighteenth - Century gallant . All the delicate psychology another man naturally seeks in a woman , the curiosity of form , windows on other lives , love and passion , I seek in my work and not elsewhere . — Form would perhaps be thickened by child - bearing ; it would perhaps be damaged by harlotry . — Why should sex still be active ? That is a matter of heredity that has nothing to do with the general energies of the mind . I see I am boring you . — The matter is too remote ! — But you have trespassed here , and you must listen . — I can not let you off before you have heard , and shown that you understand . — If you do not sit and listen , I will write it all to you . You will be made to hear it ! — And after I have told you this , I will tell you why I am talking to a fool like you ! ”
4808	4815	4133	4133	Tarr	122	“ You ask me to be polite---- ”
4816	4831	4150	4152	a humble investor	439	“ I do n’t mind how impolite you are so long as you listen . ”
4832	4842	4843	4843	Tarr	122	“ Well , I am listening — with interest . ”
5010	5084	4996	4996	He	121	“ A man only goes and confesses his faults to the world when his self will not acknowledge or listen to them . The function of a friend is to be a substitute for this defective self , to be the World and the Real without the disastrous consequences of reality . — Yet punishment is one of his chief offices . — The friend enlarges also substantially the boundaries of our solitude . ”
5127	5134	5135	5135	Tarr	122	“ You have followed so far ? ”
5150	5334	5135	5135	Tarr	122	“ You have understood the nature of my secret ? — Half of myself I have to hide . I am bitterly ashamed of a slovenly , common portion of my life that has been isolated and repudiated by the energies I am so proud of . ‘ I am ashamed of the number of Germans I know , ’ as you put it . — I have in that rôle to cower and slink away even from an old fruit - tin like you . It is useless heroically to protect that section of my life . It ’s no good sticking up for it . It is not worth protecting . It is not even up to your standards . I have , therefore , to deliver it over to your eyes , and eyes of the likes of you , in the end — if you will deign to use them ! — I even have to beg you to use your eyes ; to hold you by the sleeve and crave a glance for an object belonging to me ! “
5420	5468	5414	5414	Socrates	140	“ Think of all the collages , marriages , and liaisons that you know , in which some frowsy or foolish or doll - like or log - like bitch accompanies the form of an otherwise sensible man : a dumbfounding , disgusting , and septic ghost ! “
5544	5569	5570	5570	Hobson	121	“ I might almost take some credit to myself for at least having the grace to keep this bear - garden in the background . ”
5584	5615	5580	5580	He	121	“ You might almost . — Why do n’t you ? I admire what you tell me . But you appear to take your German foibles too much to heart . ”
5616	5785	5786	5786	Hobson	121	“ Just at present I am engaged in a gala of the heart . You may have noticed that . — I am not a strict landlord with the various personalities gathered beneath my roof . — In the present case I am really blessed . But you should see the sluts that get in sometimes I They all become steadily my fiancée too . — fiancée ! Observe how one apes the forms of conventional life . It does not mean anything , so one lets it stop . Its the same with the café fools I have for friends — there ’s a Greek fool , a German fool , a Russian fool , — an English fool ! — There are no ‘ friends ’ in this life any more than there are ‘ fiancées . ’ So it does n’t matter . You drift on side by side with this live stock — friends , fiancées , ‘ colleagues , ’ and what not . ”
5797	5879	5786	5786	Hobson	121	“ Why should I not speak plainly and cruelly of my poor , ridiculous fiancée to you or any one ? — After all , it is chiefly myself I am castigating . — But you , too , must be of the party ! The right to see implies the right to be seen . As an offset for your prying , scurvy way of peeping into my affairs you must offer your own guts , such as they are---- ! ”
5880	5889	5890	5890	Hobson	121	“ How have I pried into your affairs ? ”
5897	5918	5890	5890	Hobson	121	“ Any one who stands outside , who hides himself in a deliquescent aloofness , is a sneak and a spy---- ”
5945	6097	5786	5786	Hobson	121	“ No . — You know you have joined yourself to those who hush their voices to hear what other people are saying ! — Every one who does not fight openly and bear his share of the common burden of ignominy in life , is a sneak , unless it is for a solid motive . — The quiet you claim is not to work in . — What have you exchanged your temper , your freedom , and your fine voice against ? You have exchanged them for an old hat that does not belong to you , and a shabbiness you have not merited by suffering neediness . — Your pseudo - neediness is a sentimental indulgence . — Every man should be forced to dress up to his income , and make a smart , fresh appearance . — Patching the seat of your trousers , instead---- ! ”
6098	6103	6104	6104	Hobson	121	“ Wait a minute , ”
6111	6133	6104	6104	Hobson	121	“ You accuse me of sentimentality in my choice of costume . I wonder if you are as free from sentimentality . ”
6134	6263	6264	6264	Hobson	121	“ I do n’t care a tinker ’s blue curse about that . — I am talking about you . — Let me proceed . — With your training , you are decked in the plumes of very fine birds indeed . But your plumes are not meant to fly with , but merely to slouch and skip along the surface of the earth . — You wear the livery of a ridiculous set , you are a cunning and sleek domestic . No thought can come out of your head before it has slipped on its uniform . All your instincts are drugged with a malicious languor , an arm , a respectability , invented by a set of old women and mean , cadaverous little boys . ”
6282	6342	6279	6279	he	121	“ You reply , ‘ What is all this fuss about ? I have done the best for myself . — I was not suited for any heroic station , like yours . I live sensibly and quietly , cultivating my vegetable ideas , and also my roses and Victorian lilies . — I do no harm to anybody . ”
6343	6594	6595	6595	You	456	“ That is not quite the case . That is a little inexact . Your proceedings possess a herdesque astuteness ; in the scale against the individual weighing less than the Yellow Press , yet being a closer and meaner attack . Also you are essentially spies , in a scurvy , safe and well - paid service , as I told you before . You are disguised to look like the thing it is your function to betray — What is your position ? — You have bought for eight hundred pounds at an aristocratic educational establishment a complete mental outfit , a programme of manners . For four years you trained with other recruits . You are now a perfectly disciplined social unit , with a profound esprit de corps . The Cambridge set that you represent is as observed in an average specimen , a cross between a Quaker , a Pederast , and a Chelsea artist . — Your Oxford brothers , dating from the Wilde decade , are a stronger body . The Chelsea artists are much less flimsy . The Quakers are powerful rascals . You represent , my Hobson , the dregs of Anglo - Saxon civilization ! — There is nothing softer on earth . — Your flabby potion is a mixture of the lees of Liberalism , the poor froth blown off the decadent nineties , the wardrobe — leavings of a vulgar Bohemianism with its head - quarters in Chelsea ! “
6647	6671	6672	6677	A breed of mild pervasive cabbages	459	” Tarr ’s white collar shone dazzlingly in the sun . — His bowler hat bobbed and cut clean lines as he spoke . “
6781	6819	6825	6825	you	456	” Tarr had drawn up short , turned squarely on Hobson ; in an abrupt and disconnected voice he asked his question . Hobson stirred resentfully in his chair . He yawned a little . He replied : “
6867	6868	6869	6869	I	0	” “
6910	6911	6912	6912	My	0	” “
6995	7014	6986	6986	You	122	” He gesticulated , got the French guttural r with satisfaction , and said the quoi rather briskly . “
7024	7050	6986	6986	You	122	” he concluded quickly , after a moment , getting up with a curling , luscious laugh . The garçon hurried up and they paid . “
7075	7097	7098	7098	You	122	” — Tarr walked down the boulevard with him , speaking in his ear almost , and treading on his toes . “
7206	7283	7284	7284	Tarr	122	“ Would it be possible to achieve a work of that description with you ? No . You are meaner - spirited than the most abject tramp . I would seize you by the throat at once if I thought you would black my eye . But I feel it my duty at least to do this for your hat . Your hat , at least , will have had its little drama to - day . ”
7671	7681	7683	7683	He	150	“ Ah , I thought I might see you . ”
7699	7706	7707	7707	Tarr	122	“ Where are you off to ? ”
7710	7722	7707	7707	Tarr	122	“ I heard there were some gypsies encamped over by Charenton . ”
7744	7746	7724	7724	He	150	“ gypsies ”
7763	7767	7770	7770	Tarr	122	“ Neglecting business ? ”
7774	7782	7770	7770	Tarr	122	“ Have you time for a drink ? ”
7783	7786	7787	7787	Butcher	150	“ Yes ! ”
7797	7805	7787	7787	Butcher	150	“ Shall we go to the Panthéon ? ”
7806	7817	7770	7770	Tarr	122	“ How about the Univers ? Would that take long ? ”
7818	7831	7787	7787	Butcher	150	“ The Univers ? Four or five minutes . — Jump in . ”
7847	7864	7844	7844	Tarr	122	“ I ’ve just been talking to Alan Hobson . I ’ve been telling him off . ”
7865	7877	7770	7770	Tarr	122	“ That ’s right . — How had he deserved it ? ”
7878	7923	7924	7924	Butcher	150	“ Oh , he happened to drop on me when I was thinking about my girl . He began congratulating me on my engagement . So I gave him my views on marriage , and then wound up with a little improvisation about himself . ”
7934	7946	7947	7947	he	150	“ You ’re not engaged to be married , are you ? ”
7951	7960	7947	7947	he	150	“ Well , that ’s a difficult question . ”
7969	7983	7962	7962	Tarr	122	“ I do n’t know whether I am or whether I ’m not . ”
7984	7996	7962	7962	Tarr	122	“ Would it be the German girl , if you were ? ”
7997	8006	7962	7962	Tarr	122	“ Yes , she ’d be the one . ”
8019	8027	8015	8015	Butcher	150	“ Ought I to marry the Lunken ? ”
8028	8031	8032	8032	Butcher	150	“ No , ”
8037	8049	8032	8032	Butcher	150	“ In that case I ought to tell her at once . ”
8050	8055	8056	8056	Tarr	122	“ That is so . ”
8622	8665	8666	8666	Butcher	150	“ She ’s a very good sort . You know , she is phenomenally kind . It ’s not quite so absurd as you think , my question as to whether I should marry her . Her love is quite beyond question . ”
8689	8855	8686	8686	Tarr	122	“ She has a nice healthy penchant for self - immolation ; not , unfortunately , directed by any considerable tact or discretion . She is apt to lie down on the altar at the wrong moment — even to mistake all sorts of unrelated things for altars . She once lay down on the pavement of the Boulevard Sebastopol , and continued to lie there heroically till , with the help of an agent , I bundled her into a cab . She is genial and fond of a gross pleasantry , very near to ‘ the people ’ — le peuple , as she says , purringly and pityingly . All individuals who have class marked on them strongly resemble each other . A typical duchess is much more like a typical nurserymaid than she is like anybody not standardized to the same extent . So is Bertha , a bourgeoise , or rather bourgeois - Bohemian , reminiscent of the popular maiden . ”
8861	8958	8959	8959	Tarr	122	“ She is full of good sense . — She is a high standard Aryan female , in good condition , superbly made ; of the succulent , obedient , clear , peasant type . It is natural that in my healthy youth , living in these Bohemian wastes , I should catch fire . But that is not the whole of the picture . She is unfortunately not a peasant . She has German culture , and a florid philosophy of love . — She is an art - student . — She is absurd . ”
8967	9075	8959	8959	Tarr	122	“ You would ask then how it is that I am still there ? The peasant - girl — if such it were — would not hold you for ever ; even less so the spoiled peasant . — But that ’s where the mischief lies . — That bourgeois , spoiled , ridiculous element was the trap . I was innocently depraved enough to find it irresistible . It had the charm of a vulgar wall - paper , a gimcrack ornament . A cosy banality set in the midst of a rough life . Youthful exoticism has done it , the something different from oneself . ”
9163	9176	9177	9177	Tarr	122	“ My romance , you see , is exactly inverse to yours , ”
9180	9299	9177	9177	Tarr	122	“ But pure unadulterated romanticism with me is in about the same rudimentary state as sex . So they had perhaps better keep together ? I only allow myself to philander with little things . I have succeeded in shunting our noxious illusionism away from the great spaces and ambitions . I have billeted it with a bourgeoise in a villa . These things are all arranged above our heads . They are no doubt self - protective . The whole of a man ’s ninety - nine per cent , of obscurer mechanism is daily engaged in organizing his life in accordance with his deepest necessity . Each person boasts some notable invention of personal application only . “
9597	9608	9589	9589	you	524	” Butcher flung his head up , and laughed affectedly . “
9612	9618	9589	9589	you	524	” — he went again . “
9635	9639	9641	9641	you	0	” he said . “
9757	9770	9747	9747	I	0	” Butcher blinked and pulled himself together with a grave dissatisfied expression . “
9794	9813	9784	9784	you	0	” — Butcher had a way of tearing up and beginning all over again on a new breath . “
9841	9842	9843	9843	I	0	” “
9851	9852	9845	9845	your	0	” “
9926	9936	9937	9937	Butcher	150	“ What am I to do with Fräulein Lunken ? ”
9953	9964	9965	9965	Tarr	122	“ Once again , is marriage out of the question ? ”
9968	9983	9965	9965	Tarr	122	“ You know yourself best . I do n’t think you ought to marry . ”
9984	9990	10036	10036	Butcher	150	“ Why , am I--- ? ”
9991	10005	10006	10006	He	150	“ No . You would n’t stop with her . So why marry ? ”
10094	10101	10102	10102	Tarr	122	“ Well , in that case , ”
10105	10119	10102	10102	Tarr	122	“ I must make a move . I have treated Bertha very badly . ”
10131	10449	10450	10450	Butcher	150	“ Yes , I owe my girl anything I can give her . It is hardly my fault . With the training you get in England , how can you be expected to realize anything ? The University of Humour that prevails everywhere in England as the national institution for developing youth , provides you with nothing but a first - rate means of evading reality . The whole of English training — the great fundamental spirit of the country — is a system of deadening feeling , a prescription for Stoicism . Many of the results are excellent . It saves us from gush in many cases ; it is an excellent armour in times of crisis or misfortune . The English soldier gets his special cachet from it . But for the sake of this wonderful panacea — English humour — we sacrifice much . It would be better to face our Imagination and our nerves without this soporific . Once this armature breaks down , the man underneath is found in many cases to have become softened by it . He is subject to shock , oversensitiveness , and many ailments not met with in the more frank and direct races . Their superficial sensitiveness allows of a harder core . — To set against this , of course , you have the immense reserves of delicacy , touchiness , sympathy , that this envelope of cynicism has accumulated . It has served English art marvellously . But it is probably more useful for art than for practical affairs . And the artist could always look after himself . Anyhow , the time seems to have arrived in my life , as I consider it has arrived in the life of the country , to discard this husk and armour . Life must be met on other terms than those of fun and sport . ”
10464	10471	10473	10473	Butcher	150	“ You ’re a terrible fellow , ”
10475	10509	10510	10510	He	150	“ If you had your way , you ’d leave us stark naked . We should all be standing on our little island in the savage state of the Ancient Britons — figuratively . ”
10513	10585	10510	10510	He	150	“ Yes , figuratively . But in reality the country would be armed better than it ever had been before . And by the sacrifice of these famous ‘ national characteristics ’ we cling to sentimentally , and which are merely the accident of a time , we should lay a soil and foundation of unspecific force , on which new and realler ‘ national flavours ’ would very soon sprout . ”
10586	10591	10592	10592	Butcher	150	“ I quite agree , ”
10602	10639	10640	10640	He	150	“ I agree with what you say . If we do n’t give up dreaming , we shall get spanked . I have given up my gypsies . That was very public - spirited of me ? ”
10644	10863	10640	10640	He	150	“ If every one would give up their gypsies , their jokes , and their gentlemen — ‘ Gentlemen ’ are worse than gypsies . It would do perhaps if they reduced them considerably , as you have your Gitanos . — I ’m going to swear off humour for a year . I am going to gaze on even you inhumanly . All my mock matrimonial difficulties come from humour . I am going to gaze on Bertha inhumanly , and not humorously . Humour paralyses the sense for reality and wraps people in a phlegmatic and hysterical dreamworld , full of the delicious swirls of the switchback , the drunkenness of the merry - go - round — screaming leaps from idea to idea . My little weapon for bringing my man to earth — shot - gun or what not — gave me good sport , too , and was of the best workmanship . I carried it slung jauntily for some time at my side — you may have noticed it . But I am in the tedious position of the man who hits the bull’s - eye every time . Had I not been disproportionately occupied with her absurdities , I should not have allowed this charming girl to engage herself to me . “
10895	10896	10887	10887	I	0	” “
10947	10966	10939	10939	she	129	” Butcher filled his pipe , then he began laughing . He laughed theatrically until Tarr stopped him . “
10973	10974	10969	10969	you	0	” “
10986	10987	10969	10969	you	0	” “
11005	11012	10994	10994	You	0	” Butcher composed himself — theatrically . “
11070	11071	11073	11073	you	0	” “
11098	11099	11088	11088	I	0	” “
11107	11202	11100	11100	You	0	” Butcher said dogmatically . He talked to Tarr , when a little worked up , as Tarr talked to him . He did n’t notice that he did . It was partly calinerie and flattery . Tarr pulled out a very heavy and determined - looking watch . He would have suffered had he been compelled to use a small watch . For the time to be microscopic and noiseless would be unbearable . The time must be human . That he insisted on . And it must not be pretty or neat . “
11222	11223	11219	11219	you	0	” “
11269	11270	11283	11283	you	0	” “
11285	11300	11283	11283	you	0	” Butcher took him along two sides of the Louvre , to the river . “
11315	11498	11499	11500	Monsieur Lounes	155	” Butcher nodded in bright , clever silence . He shuffled into his car again , working his shoulders like a verminous tramp . He rushed away , piercing blasts from his horn rapidly softening as he became smaller . Tarr was glad he had brought the car and Butcher together . They were opposites with some grave essential in common . His usual lunch time an hour away , his so far unrevised programme was to go to the Rue Lhomond and search for Hobson ’s studio . For the length of a street it was equally the road to the studio and to Bertha ’s rooms . He knew to which he was going . But a sensation of peculiar freedom and leisure possessed him . There was no hurry . Was there any hurry to go where he was going ? With a smile in his mind , his face irresponsible and solemn , he turned sharply into a narrow street , rendered dangerous by motor - buses , and asked at a loge if Monsieur Lowndes were in . “
11514	11698	11699	11700	Bloody fool	542	” He ascended to the fourth floor and rang a bell . Lowndes was in . He heard him coming on tiptoe to .the door , and felt him gazing at him through an invisible crack . He placed himself in a favourable position . Tarr ’s idea of leisure recognized no departure from the tragic theme of existence . Pleasure could take no form that did not include Death and corruption — at present Bertha and humour . Only he wished to play a little longer . It was the last chance he might have . Work was in front of him with Bertha . He was giving up play . But the giving up of play , even , had to take the form of play . He had seen in terms of sport so long that he had no other machinery to work with . Sport might perhaps , for the fun of the thing , be induced to cast out sport . As Lowndes crept towards the door , Tarr said to himself , with ironic self - restraint , “
11705	11740	11699	11700	Bloody fool	542	” Lowndes was a brother artist , who was not very active , but had just enough money to be a Cubist . He was extremely proud of being interrupted in his work . His “
11742	11750	11499	11500	Monsieur Lounes	155	” was a serious matter . He found “
11753	11775	11699	11700	Bloody fool	542	” in working . He always implied that you did not . He had a form of persecution mania as regards his “
11778	11862	11699	11700	Bloody fool	542	” From his discourse you gathered that he was , first of all , very much sought after . People , seemingly , were always attempting to get into his room . You imagined an immense queue of unwelcome visitors ( how or why he had gathered or originally , it was to be supposed , encouraged , such , you did not inquire ) . You never saw this queue . The only person you definitely knew had been guilty of interrupting his “
11864	12037	12038	12038	Thornton	157	” was Thornton . This man , because of his admiration for Lowndes ’ intelligence and moth - like attraction for his Cubism , and respect for his small income , had to suffer much humiliation . He was to be found ( even in the morning , strange to say ) in Lowndes ’ studio , rapidly sucking a pipe , blinking , flushing , stammering with second - rate Public School mannerisms , retailing scandal and sensational news , which he had acquired from a woman who had sat next him at the invariable dinner - party of the night before . When you entered , he looked timidly and quickly at the inexorable Lowndes , and began gathering up his hat and books . Lowndes ’ manner became withering . You felt that before your arrival , his master had been less severe ; that life might have been almost bearable for Thornton . When he at last had taken himself off , Lowndes would hasten to exculpate himself . “
12052	12141	12044	12044	he	157	” etc . Lowndes , with his Thornton , displayed the characteristics of the selfmade man . He had risen ambitiously in the sphere of the Intelligence . Thornton sat like an inhabitant of the nether world of gossip , pettiness , and squalor from which his friend had lately issued . He entertained an immense respect for that friend . This one of his own kind in a position of respect and security was what he could best understand , and would have most desired to be . “
12149	12161	12147	12147	Tarr	122	” Lowndes said , looking at the floor of the passage , “
12170	12190	12162	12162	I	0	” The atmosphere became thick with ghostlike intruders . The wretched Thornton seemed to hover timidly in the background . “
12196	12201	12192	12192	I	0	” Tarr asked politely . “
12208	12313	12192	12192	I	0	” a long , reassuring , musical negative . His face was very dark and slick , bald on top , pettily bearded , rather unnecessarily handsome . Tarr always felt a tinge of indecency in his good looks . His Celtic head was allied to a stocky commercial figure . Behind his spectacles his black eyes had a way of scouring and scurrying over the floor . They were often dreamy and burning . He waddled slightly , or rather confided himself first to one muscular little calf , then to the other . Tarr had come to talk to him about Bertha . “
12324	12331	12317	12317	I	0	” Tarr said with mock ceremony . “
12354	12359	12348	12348	I	0	” Tarr misunderstood him . “
12371	12372	12375	12375	I	0	” “
12381	12382	12377	12377	I	0	” “
12389	12412	12377	12377	I	0	” His eyes still fixed on the ground , Lowndes pottered about , like a dog . As with most educated people who “
12414	12456	12457	12461	A fussy and exacting man	545	” anything , and foresee analysis and fame , he was biographically minded . A poor man , he did his Boswell - ing himself . His self - characterization , proceeding whenever he was not alone , was as follows : “
12484	12510	12511	12511	He	545	” ( In this way he made a virtue of his fuss . ) To show how the general illusion worked in a particular case : “
12567	12576	12577	12577	Lowndes	154	” Tarr looked on with an ugly patience . “
12592	12601	12602	12602	Ye	546	” Lowndes was flattered and relished the mystery . “
12606	12625	12602	12602	Ye	546	” he said , smiling , in a slow , ‘ sober , ’ professional sing - song . “
12641	12659	12660	12661	German women	547	” Lowndes had spent two years in Berlin and Munich . Many of his friends were Austrian . “
12684	12685	12675	12675	You	154	” “
12744	12757	12740	12740	you	154	” Lowndes mused on the ground . Then he looked up brightly . “
12769	12770	12771	12771	Lowndes	154	” “
12789	12790	12779	12779	I	0	” “
12796	12797	12793	12793	you	154	” “
12815	12850	12805	12805	Our	552	” Tarr always embarrassed him . Lowndes huddled himself tensely together , worked at his pipe , and met Tarr ’s jokes painfully . He hesitated to sally forth and drive the joke away . “
12858	12865	12853	12853	your	154	” he asked in a moment . “
12918	12941	12944	12945	German women	547	” Lowndes organized Tarr ’s statement , with a view to an adequate and light reply . He gnawed at his pipe . “
12964	12969	12944	12945	German women	547	” He looked up . “
12980	12981	12944	12945	German women	547	” “
13001	13002	12998	12998	you	154	” “
13014	13030	13008	13008	you	154	” Lowndes undulated himself as though for the passage of the large bubbles of chuckle , “
13043	13047	13048	13048	I	0	” Tarr rose . “
13065	13078	13060	13060	Your	154	” Lowndes got up , disturbed at Tarr ’s sign of departure . “
13090	13107	13087	13088	an authority	557	” He leant against the fireplace to arrest Tarr ’s withdrawal for a minute or two . “
13114	13115	13116	13116	I	0	” “
13120	13121	13116	13116	I	0	” “
13138	13139	13140	13140	I	0	” “
13149	13165	13140	13140	I	0	” Lowndes looked suddenly at his watch , with calculated , ape - like impulsiveness . “
13225	13226	13221	13221	you	154	” “
13260	13261	13257	13257	your	154	” “
13267	13311	13257	13257	your	154	” Lowndes said softly , his head turned obliquely to his shoulder , as though he had a stiff neck , and balancing on his calves . He was rather wounded , or brusque , by the brevity of Tarr ’s visit . His “
13313	13331	13257	13257	your	154	” had not received enough respect . It had been treated , in fact , cavalierly . His “
13333	13813	13257	13257	your	154	” had not been directly mentioned . When Tarr got outside , he stood on the narrow pavement , looking into a shop window . It was a florist ’s and contained a great variety of flowers . He was surprised to find that he did not know a single flower by name . He hung on in front of this shop before pushing off , as a swimmer does to a rock , waving his legs . Then he got back into the street from which his visit to Lowndes had deflected him . He let himself drift down it . He still had some way to go before he need decide between the Rue Martine ( where Bertha lived ) and the Rue Lhomond . He had not found resolution in his talks . That already existed , the fruit of various other conversations on his matrimonial position — held with the victim , Fraulein Lunken , herself . Not to go near Bertha was the negative programme for that particular day . To keep away was seldom easy . But ever since his conversation at the Berne he had been conscious of the absurd easiness of doing so , if he wished . He had not the least inclination to go to the Rue Martine!—This sensation was so grateful that its object shared in its effect . He determined to go and see her . He wanted to enjoy his present feeling of indifference . Where best to enjoy it was no doubt where she was . As to the studio , he hesitated . A new situation was created by this new feeling of indifference . Its duration could not be gauged.—He wished to stay in Paris just then to finish some paintings begun some months before . He substituted for the Impressionist ’s necessity to remain in front of the object being represented , a sensation of the desirability of finishing a canvas in the place where it was begun . He had an Impressionist ’s horror of change . So Tarr had evolved a plan . At first sight it was wicked . It was no blacker than most of his ingenuities . Bertha , as he had suggested to Butcher , he had in some lymphatic way , dans la peau . It appeared a matter of physical discomfort to leave her altogether . It must be done gradually . So he had thought that , instead of going away to England - where the separation might cause him restlessness , he had perhaps better settle down in her neighbour , hood . Through a series of specially tended ennuis , he would soon find himself in a position to depart . So the extreme nearness of the studio to Bertha ’s flat was only another inducement for him to take it . “
13825	14132	13257	13257	your	154	” he thought . Now for this famous feeling of indifference . Was there anything in it ? — The studio for the moment should be put aside . He would go to see Bertha . Let this visit solve this question . The new summer heat drew heavy pleasant ghosts out of the ground , like plants disappeared in winter ; spectres of energy , bulking the hot air with vigorous dreams . Or they had entered into the trees , in imitation of Pagan gods , and nodded their delicate distant intoxication to him . Visions were released in the sap , with scented explosion , the spring one bustling and tremendous reminiscence . Tarr felt the street was a pleasant current , setting from some immense and tropic gulf , neighboured by Floridas of remote invasions . He ambled down it puissantly , shoulders shaped like these waves ; a heavy - sided drunken fish . The houses , with winks of the shocked clockwork , were grazed , holding along their surface thick soft warmth . It poured weakly into his veins . A big dog wandering on its easily transposable business , inviting some delightful accident to deflect it from maudlin and massive promenade . In his mind , too , as in the dog ’s , his business was doubtful — a small black spot ahead in his brain , half puzzling but peremptory . The mat heavy light grey of putty - coloured houses , like thickening merely of hot summer atmosphere without sun , gave a spirituality to this deluge of animal well - being , in weighty pale sense - solidarity . Through the opaquer atmosphere sounds came lazily or tinglingly . People had become a Balzacian species , boldly tragic and comic : like a cast of “
14135	14234	14235	14235	Monsieur	563	” humanity off for the day , Balzac sleeping immensely in the cemetery . Tarr stopped at a dairy . He bought saladed potatoes , a petit suisse . The coolness , as he entered , felt eerie . The dairyman , in blue - striped smock and black cap , peaked and cylindrical , came out of an inner room . Through its glasses several women were visible , busy at a meal . This man ’s isolation from the heat and mood of the world outside , impressed his customer as he came forward with a truculent “
14237	14551	14235	14235	Monsieur	563	” Tarr , while his things were done up , watched the women . The discreet voices , severe reserve of keen business preoccupations , showed the usual Paris commerçante . The white , black , and slate - grey of dresses , extreme neatness , silent felt over - slippers , make their commercial devotions rather conventual . With this purchase — followed by one of strawberries at a fruiterer ’s opposite — his destination was no longer doubtful . He was going to Bertha ’s to eat his lunch . Hence the double quantity of saladed potatoes . He skirted the railings of the Luxembourg Gardens for fifteen yards . Crossing the road , he entered the Rue Martine , a bald expanse of uniformly coloured rosy - grey pavement , plaster , and shutter . A large iron gate led into a short avenue of trees . At its end Bertha lived in a three - story house . The leaden brilliant green of spring foliage hung above him , ticketing innumerably the trees , sultry smoke volumes from factories in Fairyland . Its novelty , fresh yet dead , had the effectiveness of an unnecessary mirage . The charm of habit and monotony he had come to affront seemed to have coloured , chemically , these approaches to its home . He found Bertha ’s eye fixed on him with a sort of humorous indifferent query from the window . He smiled , thinking what would be the veritable answer ! On finding himself in the presence of the object of his erudite discussion , he felt he had got the focus wrong . This familiar life , with its ironical eye , mocked at him too . It was aware of the subject of his late conversation . The twin of the shrewd feeling embodied in the observation , “
14559	14604	14235	14235	Monsieur	563	” appeared . This ironical unsurprised eye at the window , so vaguely apropos , offended him . It seemed to be making fun of the swaggering indifference he was bringing to bask in the presence of its object . He became slightly truculent . “
14614	14626	14606	14606	you	565	” he asked , as she opened the door to him . “
14634	14635	14627	14627	I	0	” “
14660	14783	14652	14652	I	0	” ( Sorbet , or in English , Sherbert , was his nom d’amour , a perversion of his name , Sorbert ) . Bertha ’s was the intellectually fostered Greek type of German handsomeness . It is that beauty that makes you wonder , when you meet it , if German mothers have replicas and photographs of the Venus of Milo in their rooms during the first three months of their pregnancy . It is also found in the pages of Prussian art periodicals , the arid , empty intellectualism of Munich . She had been a heavy baby . Her body now , a self - indulgent athlete ’s , was strung to heavy motherhood . A great believer in tepid “
14788	14888	14652	14652	I	0	” she would remain , for hours together , in a state of nudity about her rooms . She was wearing a pale green striped affair , tight at the waist . It looked as though meant for a smaller woman . It may have belonged to her sister . As a result , her ample form had left the fullness of a score of attitudes all over it , in flat creasings and pencillings — like the sanguine of an Italian master in which the leg is drawn in several positions , one on top of the other . “
14897	14898	14891	14891	you	567	” “
14908	14909	14905	14905	you	567	” “
14919	14920	14912	14912	you	567	” “
14933	14934	14926	14926	I	0	” “
14941	15225	14937	14937	I	0	” She stopped in the passage , Dryad - like on one foot , and stared into the kitchen . Tarr did not kiss her . He put his hand on her hip — a way out of it — and led her into the room . His hand remarked that she was underneath in her favourite state of nakedness . Bertha went into the kitchen with the provisions . She lived in two rooms on one side of the front door . Her friend , Fraulein Goenthner , to whom she sub - let , lived on the other side of it , the kitchen promiscuously existing between , and immediately facing the entrance . Tarr was in the studio or salon . It was a complete bourgeois - bohemian interior . Green silk cloth and cushions of various vegetable and mineral shades covered everything , in mildewy blight . The cold , repulsive shades of Islands of the Dead , gigantic cypresses , grottos of Teutonic nymphs , had invaded this dwelling . Purple metal and leather steadily dispensed with expensive objects . There was the plaster cast of Beethoven ( some people who have frequented artistic circles get to dislike this face extremely ) , brass jars from Normandy , a photograph of Mona Lisa ( Tarr hated the Mona Lisa ) . A table just by the window , laid with a white cloth , square embroidered holes at its edges , was where Tarr at once took up his position . Truculence was denoted by his thus going straight to his eatingplace . Installed in the midst of this ridiculous life , he gave a hasty glance at his “
15227	15271	15556	15556	you	568	” to see whether it were safe and sound . Seen through it , on opening the door , Bertha had appeared unusual . This impressed him disagreeably . Had his rich and calm feeling of bounty towards her survived the encounter , his “
15273	15546	14937	14937	I	0	” might also have remained intact . He engrossed himself in his sense of physical well being . From his pocket he produced a tin box containing tobacco , papers , and a little steel machine for rolling cigarettes given him by Bertha . A long slim hinged shell , it nipped in a little cartridge of tobacco , which it then slipped with inside a paper tube , and slipping out again empty , the cigarette was made . Tarr began manufacturing cigarettes . Reflections from the shining metal in his hand scurried about amongst the bilious bric - a - brac . Like a layer of water lying on one of oil , the light heated stretch by the windows appeared distinct from the shadowed part of the room . This place was cheap and dead , but rich with the same lifelessness as the trees without . These looked extremely near and familiar at the opened windows , breathing the same air continually as Bertha . But they were dusty , rough , and real . Bertha came in from the kitchen . She went on with a trivial rearrangement of her writing - table . This had been her occupation as he appeared at the gate beneath , drawing her ironical and musing eye from his image to himself . A new photograph of Tarr was being placed on her writing - table flush with the window . Ten days previously it had been taken in that room . It had ousted a Klinger and generally created a restlessness , to her eye , in the other objects . “
15563	15570	15561	15561	me	0	” She handed it to him . “
15577	15578	15561	15561	me	0	” “
15580	15673	14937	14937	I	0	” he had not been there ! Whatever he asked at the present moment would draw a softly thudding answer , heavy German reproach concealed in it with tireless ingenuity . These photographs would under other circumstances have been produced on his arrival with considerable noise . Tarr had looked rather askance at this portrait and Bertha ’s occupation . There was his photograph , calmly , with an air of permanence , taking up its position on her writing - table , just as he was preparing to vanish for good . “
15679	15747	14937	14937	I	0	” he said , still holding the photograph . What strange effects all this complicated activity inside had on the surface , his face . A set sulky stagnation , every violence dropping an imperceptible shade on to it , the features overgrown with this strange stuff — that twist of the head that was him , and that could only be got rid of by breaking . “
15753	15773	14937	14937	I	0	” she said , closing the drawer , handing her photographs , sandwiched with tissue paper , to Sorbert . “
15776	15808	15809	15809	I	0	” — a sitting pose , face yearning from photograph , lighted , not with a smile , but a sort of sentimental illumination , the drapery arranged like a poster — “
15818	15828	15809	15809	I	0	” she said slangily , meant to be curt and “
15831	15832	15809	15809	I	0	” “
15837	15841	15834	15835	an idiot	570	” he thought ; “
15846	16092	16094	16094	you	571	” A consciously pathetic ghost of a smile , a clumsy sweetness , the energetic sentimental claim of a rather rough but frank self . There was a photograph of her in riding habit . This was the best of them . He softened . Then came a photograph of them together . How strangely that twist of his , or set angle of the head , fitted in with the corresponding peculiarities of the woman ’s head and bust . What abysms of idiocy I Rubbishy hours and months formed the atmosphere around these two futile dolls ! He put the photographs down and looked up . She was sitting on the edge of the table . The dressing gown was open , and one large thigh , with ugly whiteness , slid half out of it . It looked dead , and connected with her like a ventriloquist ’s dummy with its master . It was natural to wonder where his senses had gone in looking at these decorous photographs . This exhibition appeared to be her explanation of the matter . The face was not very original . But a thigh can not be stupid to the same degree . He gazed surlily . Her musing expression at this moment was supremely absurd . He smiled and turned his face to the window . She pretended to become conscious suddenly of something amiss . She drew the dressing - gown round her . “
16107	16115	16094	16094	you	571	” Tarr took up the packet again . “
16149	16275	16138	16138	He	2084	” They sat without saying anything . He examined the room as you do a doctor ’s waiting room . He had just come there to see if he could turn his back on it . That appeared at first sight a very easy matter . That is why he so far had not succeeded in doing so . Never put on his mettle , his standing army of will was not sufficient to cope with it . But would this little room ever appear worth turning his back on ? It was the purest distillation of the commonplace . He had become bewitched by its strangeness . It was the height of the unreal . Bertha was like a fairy that he visited , and “
16278	16502	16094	16094	you	571	” to in another world , not the real one . It was so much the real ordinary world that for him with his out - of - the - way experience it was a phantasmagoria . Then what he had described as his disease of sport was perpetually fed . Sex even with him , according to his analysis , being a sort of ghost , was at home in this gross and buffonic illusion . Something had filled up a blank and become saturated with the blankness . How much would Bertha mind a separation ? Tarr saw in her one of those clear , humorous , superficial natures , a Venetian or a Viennese , the easy product of a cynical and abundant life . He underrated the potency of his fascination . Secondly , he miscalculated the depths of obedient attachment he had wakened . They sat impatiently waiting . A certain formality had to be observed . Then the business of the day could be proceeded with . They were both bored with the part imposed by the punctilious and ridiculous god of love . Bertha , into the bargain , wanted to get on with her cooking . She would have cut considerably the reconciliation scene . All her side of the programme had been conscientiously done . “
16511	16512	16094	16094	you	571	” “
16516	16517	16094	16094	you	571	” “
16520	16636	16094	16094	you	571	” More inaction followed on Tarr ’s part . She sometimes thought he enjoyed these ceremonies . Through girlhood her strong senses had churned away at her , and claimed an image from her gentle and dreamy mind . In its turn the mind had accumulated its impressions of men , fancies from books and conversations , and made its hive . So her senses were presented with the image that was to satisfy and rule them . They flung themselves upon it as she had flung herself upon Tarr . This image left considerable latitude . Tarr had been the first to fit — rather paradoxically , but all the faster for that . This “
16642	16664	16094	16094	you	571	” as Tarr described her , had arrived , with him , at the full and headlong condition we agree to name “
16667	16770	16094	16094	you	571	” The image , or type , was thrown away . The individual took its place . Bertha had had several sweethearts before Tarr . They had all left the type - image intact . At most it had been a little blurred by them . It had almost been smashed for one man , physically resembling Tarr . But he had never got quite near enough to do that . Tarr had characteristically supposed this image to have little sharpness of outline left . He thought it would not be a very difficult matter for any one to extort its recognition . “
16783	16811	16812	16812	her	573	” she would say . Tarr was not demonstrative when she said this . He could not reciprocate . And he could not help reflecting whether to be “
16814	16860	16094	16094	you	571	” was very flattering . There must be something the matter with him . All her hope centred in his laziness . She watched his weaknesses with a loving eye . He had much to say about his under - nature . She listened attentively . “
16872	16879	16926	16926	He	578	” and he would sententiously add — “
16940	17044	16926	16926	He	578	” He saw , however , the danger of these facilities . The Pasha had been given a magic mask of humbleness . But the inner nature seemed flowing equally to the mask and the unmasked magnificence . He was as yet unformed , but wished to form wholly Pasha . This under - nature ’s chief use was as a precious viliegiature for his energy . Bertha was the country wench the more exalted incarnation had met while on its holidays , or , wandering idle Khalife , in some concourse of his surreptitious life . His three days ’ unannounced and uncommented “
17046	17109	16926	16926	He	578	” had made Bertha very nervous . She suffered from the incomplete , unsymmetrical appearance her life now presented . Everything spread out palpably before her , that she could arrange like a roomful of furniture , was how she liked it . Even in her present shakedown of a life , Tarr had noticed the way he was treated as material for “
17112	17429	16926	16926	He	578	” But she had never been able to indulge this idiosyncrasy much in the past . This was not the first time that she had found herself in a similar position . Hence her certain air of being at home in these casual quarters , which belied her . The detested temporary dwelling in the last few days had been given a new coat of sombre thought . Found in accidental quarters , had she not been over - delicate in not suggesting an immediate move into something more homelike and permanent . People would leave her there for the rest of her natural life unless she were a little brutal and got herself out somehow . No shadow of un - nice feeling ever tainted her abject genuineness . Cunning efforts to retain him abounded . But she never blamed or turned on him . She had given herself long ago , at once , without ceremony . She awaited his thanks or no thanks simply . But the itch of action was on her . Tarr ’s absences were like light . His presence was a shadow . They were both stormy . The last absence had illuminated the undiscipline of her life . During the revealing luridness , she got to work . Reconstruction was begun . She had trusted too much in Fate and obedient waiting Hymen . So Bertha had a similar ferment to Tarr ’s . Anger with herself , dreary appetite for action , would help her over farewells . She was familiar enough with them , too , in thought . She would not stir a hand to change things . He must do that . She would only facilitate things in all directions for him . The new energy delivered attack after attack upon her hope . She saw nothing beyond Tarr but measures of utility . The “
17431	17557	16926	16926	He	578	” had always been her most cherished ornament . That Tarr would take with him , as she would keep his ring and the books he had given her . She could not now get it back for the asking . She did not want it ! She must indulge her mania for tasteful arrangement in future without this . Or rather what heart she had left would be rather like one of those salmon - coloured , corrugated gas office - stoves , compared to a hearth with a fire of pine . Tarr had not brought his indifference there to make it play tricks , perform little feats . Nor did he wish to press it into inhuman actions . It was a humane “
17560	17576	16926	16926	He	578	” essentially . So with reluctance he got up , and went over to her . “
17584	17593	17577	17577	You	580	” he said , in imitation of her . “
17600	17683	17598	17598	Sorbet	161	” she managed to say before her lips were closed . He drew her ungraciously and roughly into his arms , and started kissing her on the mouth . She covered him , docilely , with her inertia . He was supposed to be performing a miracle of bringing the dead to life . Gone about too crudely , the willing mountebank , Death , had been offended . It is not thus that great spirits are prevailed upon to flee . Her “
17685	17719	16926	16926	He	578	” — the great , simulated , and traditional — would not be ousted by an upstart and younger relative . By Tarr himself , grown repentant , yes . But not by another “
17722	17856	16926	16926	He	578	” Then his brutality stung her offended spirit , that had been pursing itself up for so many hours . Tears began rolling tranquilly out of her eyes in large dignified drops . They had not been very far back in the wings . He received them frigidly . She was sure , thought he , to detect something unusual during this scene . Then with the woman ’s bustling , desperate , possessive fury , she suddenly woke up . She disengaged her arms wildly and threw them round his neck , tears becoming torrential . Underneath the poor comedian that played such antics with such phlegmatic and exasperating persistence , this distressed being thrust up its trembling mask , like a drowning rat . Its finer head pierced her blunter wedge . “
17876	17877	17880	17880	you	581	” “
17887	17902	16926	16926	He	578	” A wail , like the buzzing on a comb covered with paper followed . “
17916	18207	18208	18208	Bertha	177	” A blurting , hurrying personality rushed right up into his face . It was like the sightless clammy charging of a bat . More eloquent regions had ambushed him . Humbug had mysteriously departed . It was a blast of knife like air in the middle of their hot - house . He stared at her face groping up as though it scented troubles in his face . It pushed to right and then to left and rocked itself . Intelligent and aware , it lost this intensity . A complicated image developed in his mind as he stood with her . He was remembering Schopenhauer . It was of a Chinese puzzle of boxes within boxes , or of insects ’ discarded envelopes . A woman had in the middle of her a kernel , a sort of very substantial astral baby . This baby was apt to swell . She then became all baby . The husk he held was a painted mummy - case . He was a mummy - case too . Only he contained nothing but innumerable other painted cases inside , smaller and smaller ones . The smallest was not a substantial astral baby , however , or live core , but a painting like the rest . His kernel was a painting . That was as it should be ! He was half sitting on the table . He found himself patting her back . He stopped doing this . His face looked heavy and fatigued . A dull , intense infection of her despair had filled it . He held her head gently against his neck . Or he held her skull against his neck . She shook and sniffed softly . “
18243	19085	19086	19086	Ganymed	179	” He over - estimated deafness in weepers . And when women flooded their country he always sat down and waited . Often as this had happened to him , he had never attempted to circumvent it . He felt like a person who is taking a little dog for a walk at the end of a string . His voice appeared husky and artificial near her ear . Turned towards the window , he looked at the green stain of the foliage outside . Something was explained . Nature was not friendly to him ; its metallic tints jarred . Or anyhow , it was the same for all men . The sunlight seen like an adventurous stranger in the streets was intimate with Bertha . The scrap of crude forest had made him want to be away unaccompanied . But it was tainted with her . If he went away now he would only be playing at liberty . He had been right in not accepting the invitations of the spring . The settlement of this question stood between him and pleasure . A momentary well - being had been accepted . The larger spiritual invitation he had rejected . He would only take that when he was free . In its annual expansion Nature sent its large unstinting invitations . But Nature loved the genius and liberty in him . Tarr felt the invitation would not have been so cordial had he proposed taking a wife and family ! He led her passively protesting to the sofa . Like a sick person , she was half indignant at being moved . He should have remained , a perpendicular bed for her , till the fever had passed . Revolted at the hypocrisy required , he left her standing at the edge of the sofa . She stood crouching a little , her face buried in her hands , in indignant absurdity . The only moderately clean thing to do would be to walk out of the door at once and never come back . With his background of months of different behaviour this could not be done . She sank down on the sofa , head buried in the bilious cushions . She lay there like an animal , he thought , or some one mad , a lump of half - humanity . On one side of him Bertha lay quite motionless and silent , and on the other the little avenue was equally still . The false stillness within , however , now gave back to the scene without its habitual character . It still seemed strange to him . But all its strangeness now lay in its everyday and natural appearance . The quiet inside , in the room , was what did not seem strange to him . He had become imbued with that . Bertha ’s numb silence and abandon was a stupid tableau vivant of his own mood . In this impasse of arrested life he stood sick and useless . They progressed from stage to stage of this weary farce . Confusion increased . It resembled a combat between two wrestlers of mathematically equal strength . Neither could win . One or other of them was usually wallowing warily or lifelessly on his stomach , the other tugging at him or examining and prodding his carcass . His liking , contempt , realization of her love for him , his confused but exigent conscience , dogged preparation to say farewell , all dovetailed with precision . There she lay a deadweight . He could take his hat and go . But once gone in this manner he could not stay . He turned round , and sitting on the window - sill began again staring at Bertha . Women ’s stormy weakness , psychic discharges , always affected him as the sight of a person being seasick . It was the result of a weak spirit , as the other was the result of a weak stomach . They could only live on the retching seas of their troubles on the condition of being quite empty . The lack of art or illusion in actual life enables the sensitive man to exist . Likewise the phenomenal lack of nature in the average man ’s existence is lucky and necessary for him . Tarr in some way gathered strength from contemplation of Bertha . His contradictory and dislocated feelings were brought into a new synthesis . Launching himself off the window - sill , he stood still as though suspended in thought . He then sat down provisionally at the writing - table , within a few feet of the sofa . He took up a book of Goethe ’s poems that she had given him . In cumbrous field - day dress of Gothic characters , squad after squad , these poems paraded their message . He had left it there on a former visit . He came to the ode named “
19088	19174	19086	19086	Ganymed	179	” He put it in his breast - pocket . As soldiers go into battle sometimes with the Bible in their pocket , he prepared himself for a final combat , with Goethe upon his person . Men ’s lives have been known to have been saved through a lesser devoutness . He was engaging battle again with the most chivalrous sentiments . The reserves had been called up , his nature mobilized . As his will gathered force and volume ( in its determination to “
19176	19252	19254	19254	her	584	” her ) he unhypocritically keyed up its attitude . It resembled extreme cunning . He had felt , while he had been holding her , at a disadvantage because of his listless emotion . With emotion equal to hers , he could accomplish anything . Leaving her would be child ’s play . He appeared to be projecting the manufacture of a more adequate sentiment . Any indirectness was out of the question . A “
19258	19368	19254	19254	her	584	” kissing and leaving in an hour or two , as though things had not changed , that must now be eschewed — oh , yes . The genuine section of her , of which he had a troubled glimpse , mattered , nothing else . He must appeal obstinately to that . Their coming together had been prosecuted on his side with a stupid levity . He would retrieve this in the parting . He wished to do everything most opposite to his previous lazy conduct . He frowned on Humour . The first skirmish of his comic Armageddon had opened with the advance of his mysterious and goguenard “
19371	19404	19254	19254	her	584	” This dwindled away at the first onset . A new and more powerful thing had taken its place . This was , in Bertha ’s eyes , a difference in Tarr . “
19413	19419	19409	19409	he	585	” she said to herself . “
19426	19732	19420	19420	He	585	” had been her rapid provisional conclusion . She suddenly got up without speaking . Rather spectrally , she went over to the writing - table for her handkerchief . She had not moved an inch or a muscle until quite herself again , dropping steadily down all the scale of feeling to normal . With matter - of - factness she got up , easily and quietly , making Sorbert a little dizzy . Her face had all the drama wrung out of it . It was hard , clear , and garishly white , like her body . If he were to have a chance of talking he must clear the air of electricity completely . Else at his first few words storm might return . Once lunch had swept through the room , things would be better . He would send the strawberries ahead to prepare his way . It was like fattening a lamb for the slaughter . This idea pleased him . Now that he had accepted the existence of a possible higher plane of feeling as between Bertha and himself , he was anxious to avoid display . So he ran the risk of outdoing his former callousness . Tarr was saturated with morbid English shyness , that can not tolerate passion and its nakedness . This shyness , as he contended , in its need to show its heart , discovers subtleties and refinements of expression , opposites and between shades , unknown to less gauche and delicate people . But if he were hustled out of his shell the anger that co - existed with his modesty was the most spontaneous thing he possessed . Bertha had always left him alone . He got up , obsequiously reproducing in his own movements and expression her new normality . “
19748	19749	19739	19739	I	0	” “
19761	20008	19756	19756	I	0	” Bertha had wiped her eyes with the attentiveness a man bestows on his chin after a shave , in little brusque hard strokes . She did not look at Tarr . She arranged her hair in the mirror , then went to the kitchen . For her to be so perfectly natural offended him . The intensity of her past feeling carried her on for about five minutes into ordinary life . Her seriousness was tactful for so long . Then her nature began to give way . It broke up again into fits and starts of self - consciousness . The mind was called in , did its work clumsily as usual . She became her usual self . Sitting on the stool by the window , in the act of eating , Tarr there in front of her , it was more than ever impossible to be natural . She resented the immediate introduction of lunch in this way . The resentment increased her artificiality . To counterbalance the acceptance of food , she had to throw more pathos into her face . With haggard resignation she was going on again ; doing what was asked of her , partaking of this lunch . She did so with unnecessary conscientiousness . Her strange wave of dignity had let her in for this ? Almost she must make up for that dignity ! Life was confusing her again ; it was useless to struggle . “
20031	20032	20034	20034	you	587	” “
20036	20062	20034	20034	you	587	” She should have said no . But being greedy in this matter she accepted it , with heavy air of some subtle advantage gained . “
20071	20082	20089	20089	you	587	” She went to a riding school in the mornings . “
20098	20111	20115	20115	you	587	” This referred to his exchange of languages with a Russian girl . “
20117	20128	20115	20115	you	587	” The Russian girl was a useful feint for her . “
20134	20160	20115	20115	you	587	” The time ? What cheek ! He was almost startled . He took his heavy watch out and presented its face to her ironically . “
20167	20171	20162	20162	you	587	” he asked . “
20187	20188	20182	20182	I	0	” “
20199	20200	20189	20189	You	587	” “

20218	20242	20216	20216	Bertha	177	” He had not put his watch back in his pocket . She had asked for the watch ; he would use it . “
20296	20311	20277	20277	I	0	” Bertha looked up with mocking sulky face , a shade of hopeful curiosity . “
20323	20351	20277	20277	I	0	” He said this solemnly , with the pomp with which a weighty piece of news might be delivered by a solicitor in conversation with his client . “
20358	20369	20277	20277	I	0	” The new barbaric effort was met by Bertha scornfully . “
20377	20434	20277	20277	I	0	” Catching at the professional figure his manner had conjured up , he ran his further remarks into that mould . The presence of his watch in his hand had brought some image of the family physician or gouty attorney . It all centred round the watch , and her interest in the time of day . “
20450	20457	20435	20435	I	0	” He smiled with professional courtesy . “
20508	20535	20536	20536	My	0	” He had now got the image down to the more precise form of two partners , perhaps comfortable wine merchants , going through their books . “
20569	20570	20556	20556	you	590	” “
20589	20590	20556	20556	you	590	” “

20610	20633	20605	20605	I	0	” he reminded her . £ ' .. She cast her eyes about in swoops , full of self - possessed wildness . “
20640	20644	20634	20634	I	0	” she said , “

20711	20721	20697	20697	I	0	” She always heaved this out with much energy . “
20764	20765	20758	20758	I	0	” “
20808	20809	20810	20810	I	0	” “
20831	20875	20876	20876	We	594	” The unbusinesslike element in the situation she had allowed to develop for obvious reasons . She now resisted his dishonest attempt to set this right , and benefit first , as he had done , by disorder , and lastly by order . “
20915	20924	20900	20900	Sorbet	161	” with appealing gesture and saintlily smiling face , “
20938	20976	20900	20900	Sorbet	161	” Bertha always opposed to Tarr ’s images her Teutonic lyricism , usually repeating the same phrases several times . This was degenerating into their routine of wrangle . Always confronted by this imperturbable , deaf and blind “
20979	20988	20900	20900	Sorbet	161	” the day would end in the usual senseless “
20991	20998	20999	20999	Bertha	177	” His words still remained unsaid . “
21079	21102	21064	21064	We	594	” Bertha gazed at Tarr half wonderingly . She realized that something out of the ordinary was on foot . Tarr proceeded . “
21224	21251	21252	21252	You	177	” He said this eagerly , as though it were a point in his argument — as it was . He paused , for effect apparently . “
21350	21351	21352	21352	You	0	” “
21357	21358	21352	21352	You	0	” “
21388	21389	21352	21352	You	0	” “
21394	21395	21398	21398	your	177	” “
21540	21655	21532	21532	I	0	” This simplification put things , merely , in a new callous light . Tarr felt that she must naturally be enjoying , too , his points . He forgot to direct his exposition in such a way as to hurt her least . This trivial and tortured landscape had a beauty for him he could have explained , where her less developed sense saw nothing but a harrowing reality . The lunch had had the same effect on him that it was intended to have on his victim ; not enough to overthrow his resolution , but enough to relax its form . As to Bertha , this seemed , in the main , “
21660	21669	21532	21532	I	0	” There was nothing new . There was the “
21672	21751	21532	21532	I	0	” But it was the familiar process ; he was attempting to convince himself , heartlessly , on her . Whether he would ever manage it was problematic . There was no sign of his being likely to do so more to - day than any other day . She listened ; sententiously released him from time to time . Just as she had seemed strange to him in some way when he came in , seen through his “
21754	21848	21532	21532	I	0	” so he had appeared a little odd to her . This had wiped off the dullness of habit for a moment . This husband she obstinately wanted had been recognized . She had seized him round the shoulders and clung to him , as though he had been her child that some senseless force were about to snatch . As to his superstition about marriage — was it not merely restlessness of youth , propaganda of Liberty , that a year or so would see in Limbo ? For was he not a “
21851	21870	21532	21532	I	0	” ? She was sure of it ! She had tried not to frighten him , and to keep “
21872	21975	21532	21532	I	0	” in the background . So Tarr ’s disquisition had no effect except for one thing . When he spoke of pleasure he derived from idea of marriage , she wearily pricked up her ears . The conviction that Tarr was a domesticated animal was confirmed from his own lips . The only result of his sortie was to stimulate her always vigilant hope and irony , both , just a little . He had intended to prepare the couch for her despair ! His last words , affirming Marriage to be a game not worth the candle , brought a faint and “
21977	21995	21996	21996	Sorbert	270	” smile to her face . She was once more , obviously , au bout de force . “
22047	22067	22068	22068	I	0	” ( The training guttural unctuous accent she had in speaking English filled her discourse with natural emphasis . ) “
22099	22155	22094	22094	you	270	” She gazed at him with compassionate , half - smiling moistened look , as though there were something deformed about being so young . A way she had was to treat anything that obviously pointed to her as the object of pity , as though it manifestly indicated , on the contrary , him . “
22164	22169	22160	22160	you	161	” she finished briskly . “
22181	22613	22158	22158	Sorbet	161	” A suggestion that their leisurely journey towards marriage was perhaps a mistake was at once seriously , and with conviction far surpassing that he had ventured on , taken up by her . She would immediately call a halt , pitch tents preliminary to turning back . A pause was necessary before beginning the return journey . Next day they would be jogging on again in the same disputed direction . Tarr now saw at once what had happened . His good words had been lost , all except his confession to a weakness for the matronly blandishments of Matrimony . He had an access of stupid , brief , and blatant laughter . As people have wondered what was at the core of the world , basing their speculations on what deepest things occasionally emerge , with violence , at its holes , so Bertha often conjectured what might be at the heart of Tarr . Laughter was the most apparently central substance that , to her knowledge , had incontrollably appeared . She had often heard grondements , grumblings , quite literally , and seen unpleasant lights , belonging , she knew , to other categories of matter . But they never broke cover . At present this gaiety was interpreted as proof that she had been right . There was nothing in what he had said . It had been only one of his bad fits of rebellion . But laughter Tarr felt was retrogression . Laughter must be given up . He must in some way , for both their sakes , lay at once the foundations of an ending . For a few minutes he played with the idea of affecting her weapons . Perhaps it was not only impossible to overcome , but even to approach , or to be said to be on the same field with , this peculiar amazon , without such uniformity of engines of attack or defence . Should not he get himself a mask like hers at once , and follow suit with some emphatic sentence ? He stared uncertainly at her . Then he sprang to his feet . He intended , as far as he could see beyond this passionate movement ( for he must give himself up to the mood , of course ) to pace the room . But his violence jerked out of him a shout of laughter . He went stamping about the floor roaring with reluctant mirth . It would not come out properly , too , except the first outburst . “
22626	22649	22160	22160	you	161	” Bertha ’s patient irony seemed to gibe . This laughter left him vexed with himself , like a fit of tears . “
22693	22700	22160	22160	you	161	” said Tarr to Butcher once , “
22745	22916	22917	22917	I	0	” Butcher blinked . He thought of his resources , and remembered his inclination to tears . * * * * Tarr ’s disgust at this electric rush of sound made him turn it on her . He was now put at a fresh disadvantage . How could he ever succeed in making Bertha believe that a person who laughed immoderately meant what he said ? Under the shadow of this laugh all his ensuing acts or words must toil , discredited in advance . Desperately ignoring accidents , he went back beyond his first explosion , and attacked its cause — indicting Bertha , more or less , as responsible for the disturbance . He sat down squarely in front of her , hardly breathed from his paroxysm , getting launched without transition . He hoped , by rapid plunging from one state to another , to take the wind out of the laugh ’s sails . It should be left towering , spectral , but becalmed , behind . “
22982	22985	22970	22970	you	614	” And he “
22988	23003	22970	22970	you	614	” in French idiom , a gesture , as though offering her his hand . “
23035	23052	23053	23053	I	0	” ( she leant towards him with an abortive movement as though to take his hand ) “
23061	23078	23079	23079	You	161	” ( Last words very quick , with nod of head and blink of eyes . ) “
23111	23113	23101	23101	you	161	” The “
23118	23131	23101	23101	you	161	” was precipitate , strenuous Prussian , almost truculent . Tarr thought : “
23142	23157	23101	23101	you	161	” She continued of a sudden , shunting on to another track of generosity : “
23195	23196	23200	23200	I	0	” “
23217	23218	23219	23220	Some one	619	” “
23227	23228	23226	23226	you----	161	” “
23247	23266	23231	23231	I	0	” With half - incredulous , musing , glimmering stare she drew in her horns . Tarr meditated . “
23492	23505	23506	23506	I	0	” He looked at her a moment , in search of inspiration . “
23720	24013	23715	23715	Her	586	” To cover reflection , he set himself to finish lunch . The strawberries were devoured mechanically , with unhungry itch to clear the plate . He had become just a devouring - machine , restless if any of the little red balls still remained in front of it . Bertha ’s eyes sought to carry her out of this Present . But they had broken down , depositing her , so to speak , somewhere half - way down the avenue . Tarr got up , a released automaton , and walked to the cloth - covered box where he had left his hat and stick . Then he returned in some way dutifully and obediently to the same seat , sat there for a minute , hat on knee . He had gone over and taken it up without thinking . He only realized , once back , what it meant . Nothing was settled , he had so far done more harm than good . The presence of the hat and stick on his knees , however , was like the holding open of the front door already . Anything said with them there could only be like words said as an afterthought , on the threshold . It was as though , hat on head , he were standing with his hand on the door - knob , about to add some trifle to a thing already fixed . He got up , walked back to where he had picked up the hat and stick , placed them as they were before , then returned to the window . What should be done now ? He seemed to have played all his fifty - two cards . Everything to “
24016	24188	24191	24191	Sorbet	161	” looked behind him , not awaiting him at all . That passive pose of Bertha ’s was not encouraging . It had lately withstood stoically a good deal , was quite ready to absorb still more . There was something almost pugnacious in so much resignation . But when she looked up at him there was no sign of combat . She appeared stilled to something simple again , by some fluke of a word . For the second time that day she had jumped out of her skin . Her heart beat in a delicate , exhausted way , her eyelids became moistened underneath , as she turned so her unusual fiancé They had wandered , she felt , into a drift of silence that hid a distant and unpleasant prospect at the end of it . It seemed suddenly charged with some alarming fancy that she could not grasp . There was something more unusual than her fiancé The circular storm , in her case , was returning . “
24193	24194	24191	24191	Sorbet	161	” “
24201	24202	24206	24206	you	161	” “
24233	24234	24227	24227	you	161	” “
24240	24363	24227	24227	you	161	” She looked down with a wild demureness , her head on one side . Her mouth felt some distance from her brain . Her voice stood on tiptoe like a dwarf to speak . She became very much impressed by her voice , and was rather afraid to say anything more . Had she fainted ? Sorbert was a stranger . The black stubble on his chin and brown neck appeared like the symptoms of a disease that repelled her . She noticed something criminal and quick in his eyes . She became nervous , as though she had admitted somebody too trustingly to her rooms . This fancy played on her hysteria , and she really wanted him to go . “
24370	24728	24367	24367	you	627	” she repeated , in a pleasant voice . Tarr remained silent , seemingly determined not to answer . Meantime he looked at her with a doubtful dislike . What is love ? he began reasoning . It is either possession or a possessive madness . In the case of men and women , it is the obsession of a personality . He had presumably been endowed with the power of awaking love in her . He had something to accuse himself of . He had been afraid of giving up or repudiating this particular madness . To give up another person ’s love is a mild suicide ; like a very bad inoculation as compared to the full disease . His tenderness for Bertha was due to her having purloined some part of himself , and covered herself superficially with it as a shield . Her skin at least was Tarr . She had captured a bit of him , and held it as a hostage . She was rapidly transforming herself , too , into a slavish dependency . She worked with all the hypocrisy of a great instinct . People can wound by loving ; the sympathy of this affection is interpenetrative . Love performs its natural miracle , and they become part of us ; it is a dismemberment to cast them off . Our own blood flows out after them when they go . Or love was a malady ; it was dangerous to live with those consumed by it . He felt an uneasiness . Might not a wasting and restlessness ensue ? It would not , if he caught it , be recognizable as love . Perhaps he had already got it slightly . That might account for his hanging about her . He evidently was suffering from something that came from Bertha . Everybody , however , all personality , was catching . We all are sicknesses for each other . Such contact as he had with Bertha was particularly risky . Their photographs he had just been looking at displayed an unpleasant solidarity . Was it necessary to allege “
24730	25111	25115	25115	he	628	” at all ? The word was superfluous in his case . The fact was before him . He felt suddenly despondent and afraid of the Future . He had fallen beneath a more immediate infection . He looked attentively round the room . His memory already ached . She had loved him with all this . She had loved him with the plaster cast of Beethoven , attacked him with the Klingers , ambushed him from the Breton jars , in a funny , superficial , absorbing way . Her madness had muddled everything with his ideal existence . It was n’t like leaving an ordinary room you had spent pleasant hours in and would regret . You would owe nothing to that , and it could not pursue you with images of wrong . This room he was wronging , and left it in a different way . She seemed , too , so humble in it , or through it . The appeal of the little again . If he could only escape from scale . The price of preoccupation with the large was this perpetual danger from the little . He wished he could look coldly on mere littleness , and not want to caress and protect it when it was human . Brutality was no doubt necessary for people like him . Love was too new to him . He was not inoculated enough with love . He had callously been signing his name to a series of brutalities , then , as though he were sure that when the time came he would have a quite sufficient stock of coldness to meet these debts . Yet he had known from the first that he had not . Eventually he would have to evade them or succumb . The flourishes of the hand and mind had caused Bertha ’s mute and mournful attitude . She thought she knew him , but was amazed at his ignorance or pretence . So he had now brought this new element into relief . For the last hour he had been accumulating difficulties , or rather unearthing some new one at every step . Impossible to tackle en masse , they were all there before him . The thought of “
25118	25223	25115	25115	he	628	” now appeared monstrous . He had , anyhow , started these local monsters and demons , fishing them to the light . Each had a different vocal explosiveness or murmur , inveighing unintelligibly against each other . The only thing to be done was to herd them all together and march them away for inspection at leisure . Sudden herdsman , with the care of a delicate and antediluvian flock ; well ! — But what was Bertha to be told ? Nothing . He would file out silently with his flock , without any hornblasts or windings such as he customarily affected . “
25229	25246	25224	25224	I	0	” he said at last , getting up . She looked at him with startled interest . “
25254	25255	25252	25252	Sorbet	161	” “
25266	25276	25262	25262	I	0	” He stooped down for his hat and cane . “
25291	26108	25277	25277	I	0	” Closing the door quietly , with a petty carefulness , he crossed the passage , belittled and guilty . He did not wish to escape this feeling . It would be better to enhance it . For a moment it occurred to him to go back and offer marriage . It was about all he had to offer . He was ashamed of his only gift ! But he did not stop , he opened the front door and went downstairs . Something raw and uncertain he seemed to have built up in the room he had left . How long would it hold together ? Again he was acting in secret , his errand and intentions kept to himself . Something followed him like a restless dog . From his window in the neighbouring boulevard Kreisler ’s eye was fixed blankly on a spot thirty feet above the scene of the Hobson - Tarr dialogue . He was shaving himself , one eye fixed on Paris . It beat on this wall of Paris drearily . Had it been endowed with properties of illumination and been directed there earlier in the day , it would have served as a desolate halo for Tarr ’s ratiocination . For several days Kreisler ’s watch had been in the Mont de Piété . Until some clock struck he was in total ignorance of the time of day . The late spring sunshine flooded , like a bursted tepid star , the pink boulevard . The people beneath crawled like wounded insects of cloth . A two - story house terminating the Boulevard Pfeiffer covered the lower part of the Cafe Berne . Kreisler ’s room looked like some funeral vault . Shallow , ill - lighted , and extensive , it was placarded with nude and archaic images , painted on strips of canvas fixed to the wall with drawing - pins . Imagining yourself in some Asiatic dwelling of the dead , with the portraits of the deceased covering the holes in which they had respectively been thrust , you would , following your fancy , have turned to Kreisler seeking to see in him some devout recluse who had taken up his quarters there . Kreisler was in a sense a recluse ( although almost certainly the fancy would have gasped and fallen at his contact ) . But cafés were the luminous caverns where he could be said , most generally , to dwell ; with , nevertheless , very little opening of the lips and much recueillement or meditation ; therefore not unworthy of some rank among the inferior and less fervent solitudes . A bed like an overturned cupboard , dark , and with a red billow of cloth and feathers covering it entirely ; a tesselated floor of dark red tile ; a little rug , made with paint , carpet , cardboard , and horsehair , to represent a leopard — these , with chair , washstand , easel , and several weeks ’ of slowly drifting and shifting garbage , completed its contents . Kreisler flicked the lather on to a crumpled newspaper , with an irresponsible gesture . Each time his razor was raised he looked at himself with a peering vacancy . His face had long become a piece of troublesome meat . Life did not each day deposit an untidiness that could be whisked off by a Gillette blade , as Nature did its stubble . His face , it is true , wore like a uniform the frowning fixity of the Prussian warrior . But it was such a rig - out as the Captain of Koepenich must have worn , and would take in nobody but a Teutonic squad . The true German seeks every day , by little acts of boorishness , to keep fresh this trenchant Prussian attitude ; just as the German student , with his weekly routine of duels , keeps courage simmering in times of peace , that it may instantly boil up to war pitch at the least sign from his Emperor . He brushed his clothes in a sulky , vigorous way , like a silent , discontented domestic of a shabby , lonely master . He cleaned his glasses with the absorption and tenderness of the short - sighted . Next moment he was gazing through them , straddled on his flat Slav nose — brushing up whimsical moustaches over pouting mouth . This was done with two tiny ivory brushes taken out of a small leather case — present from a fiancee who had been alarmed that his moustaches showed an unpatriotic tendency to droop . This old sweetheart just then disagreeably occupied his mind . But he busied himself about further items of toilet with increased precision . To a knock he answered with careful “
26112	26147	25277	25277	I	0	” He did not take his eyes from the glass , spotted blue tie being pinched into position . He watched with impassibility above and around his tie the entrance of a young woman . “
26157	26314	26152	26152	you	629	” she said in French . He treated her as coolly as he had his thoughts . Appearing just then , she gave his manner towards the latter something human to play on , with relief . Imparting swanlike undulations to a short stout person , eye fixed quizzingly on Kreisler ’s in the glass , she advanced . Her manner was one seldom sure of welcome , a little deprecatingly aggressive . She owned humorously a good - natured face with protruding eyes , gesticulated with , filling her silences with explosive significance . Brows always raised . A soul made after the image of injuries . A skin which would become easily blue in cold weather was matched with a taste in dress inveterately blue . The Pas de Calais had somehow produced her . Paris , shortly afterwards , had put the mark of its necessitous millions on a mean , lively child . “
26324	26332	26316	26316	you	629	” came in a minute or two . “
26335	26344	26316	26316	you	629	” he replied , putting his jacket on . “
26351	26352	26346	26346	you	629	” “
26367	26388	26364	26364	yourself	629	” with grin tightening all the skin of her face , making it pink and bald and her eyes drunken . “
26396	26419	26392	26392	I	0	” Watched with sort of appreciative raillery , he got down on his knees and dragged a portmanteau from beneath the bed . “
26429	26439	26420	26420	Susanna	186	” he asked simply , as of an expert . “
26476	26477	26464	26464	they	631	” “
26481	26485	26486	26486	I	0	” he asked . “
26491	26513	26486	26486	I	0	” he clamoured of a sudden , with energy that astonished her . She grimaced , looked very serious : said , “
26522	26586	26486	26486	I	0	” with several vigorous , yet rhythmical and rich , forward movements of the head . She became the broker : Kreisler was pressing for a sum in excess of regulations . Not for the world , any more than had she been the broker in fact , would she have valued it at a penny over what it seemed likely to fetch . “
26595	26622	26486	26486	I	0	” she repeated . She looked even worried . She would have liked to please Kreisler by saying more , but her business conscience prevented her . “
26630	26685	26625	26625	we	632	” This conversation was carried on strictly in dialect . Suzanne understood him , for she was largely responsible for the lingo in which Kreisler carried on conversation with the French . This young woman had no fixed occupation . She disappeared for periods to live with men . She sat as a model . “
26693	26699	26700	26701	Le cochon	188	” He shook his head . “
26703	26707	26700	26701	Le cochon	188	” she stuttered . “
26723	26750	26700	26701	Le cochon	188	” The idiosyncrasies of these monthly letters were quite familiar to her . The dress - clothes had been pawned by her on a former occasion . “
26759	26760	26761	26761	I	0	” “
26773	26791	26761	26761	I	0	” Her silence was as eloquent as face - muscles and eye - fluid could make it . “
26800	27285	26761	26761	I	0	” he explained , fixing her stolidly with his eye . She first smiled slowly , then allowed her ready mirth to grow , by mechanical stages , into laughter . The presence of this small , indifferent , and mercenary acquaintance irritated him . But he remained cool . Just then a church clock began striking . He foreboded it was already ten , but not later . It struck ten and then eleven . He leapt the hour — the clock seemed rushing with him , in a second , to the more advanced hour — without any flurry , quite calmly . Then it struck twelve . He at once absorbed that further hour as he had the former . He lived an hour as easily and carelessly as he would have lived a second . Could it have gone on striking he would have swallowed , without turning a hair , twenty , thirty strokes ! Going out with Suzanne , he turned the key carefully in the door . The concierge or landlord might slip in and fire his things out in his absence . The portmanteau , whisked up from the floor , flopped along with him like a child ’s slack balloon . He frowned at Suzanne and , prepared for surprises , went warily down the stairs . He had felt a raw twinge of anger as he had opened the door , looking down at the first boards of his room . A half an hour before , on waking , he had sat up in bed and gazed at the crevice at its foot where a letter , thrust underneath by the concierge , usually lay . He had stared as though it had been a shock to find nothing . That little square of rich bright white paper was what he had counted on night to give him — that he had expected to find on waking , as though it were a secretion of those long hours . It made him feel that there had been no night — long , fecund , rich in surprises — but merely a barren moment of sleep . A stale and garish continuation of yesterday , no fresh day at all , had dawned . The chill and phlegmatic appearance of his room annoyed him . It was its inhospitable character that repelled the envelope pregnant with revolutionary joy and serried German marks . Its dead unchangeableness must preclude all innovation . This spell of monotony on his life he could not break . The room cut him off from the world . He gazed around as a man may eye a wife whom he suspects of intercepting his correspondence . There was no reason why the letter with his monthly remittance should , have come on that particular morning , already eight days overdue . “
27294	27323	26761	26761	I	0	” said Suzanne in menacing , humorous sing - song , eyes bulging and head nodding . At this vista of perpetual blackmail she fell into a reverie . “
27335	27341	27333	27333	Suzanne	186	” Kreisler advised in reply . “
27344	27356	27357	27357	I	0	” Suzanne did not understand , and pulled a sour face . “
27362	27363	27357	27357	I	0	” “
27375	27376	27377	27377	I	0	” “

27439	27440	27434	27434	I	0	” “
27446	27466	27441	27441	You	0	” Kreisler was too proud to reply to Suzanne very often . He marched on , staring severely ahead . “
27483	27484	27480	27481	that stepmother	642	” “

27505	27506	27485	27486	My father	639	” “
27551	27552	27548	27548	she	638	” “
27556	27563	27548	27548	she	638	” They got near the Berne . “
27572	27673	27674	27674	You	0	” Kreisler said . Suzanne sat down — with the hiding of her red hands , her guilty lofty silence , eyebrows raised as though with a slimy pescine enamel , inducing an impression of nefarious hurry and impermanence . Kreisler was sour and full of himself . His bag looked as though it should hold the properties or merchandise of some illicit trade or amusement . Suzanne seemed to triumph at this information . She pressed and pressed in breathless undertone , fascinated by something . Family dramas , of all dramas , she had the expertest interest in . “
27689	27690	27685	27687	the old devil----	644	” “
27701	27745	27746	27746	He	644	” Suzanne had taken a near and serious interest in Otto ’s financial arrangements . She remembered dates well , apart from that . Otto did not proceed for some time . She stared quizzingly and patiently past the tip of his nose . “
27783	27784	27785	27785	You	0	” “
27788	27789	27785	27785	You	0	” “
27797	27883	27790	27790	I	0	” In this his methods were very similar to his father ’s . The elder Kreisler had repeatedly infuriated his son , calculating on such effect , by sending his allowance only when written for , and even then neglecting his appeal for several days . It came frequently wrapped up in bits of newspapers , and his letters of demand and expostulation were never answered . On two occasions forty marks and thirty marks respectively .had been deducted , merely as an irritative measure . “
27895	27896	27889	27889	you	0	” “
27910	27911	27903	27903	I	0	” “

27950	27960	27961	27961	He	649	” Suzanne once more glimmered into the absurd distance . “
27968	27969	27961	27961	He	649	” “
27985	27986	27975	27975	I	0	” “
28026	28179	28017	28017	You	0	” Kreisler knew the end was not far off ; this might be it . So much the better ! Kreisler ’s student days — a lifetime in itself — had unfitted him , at the age of thirty - six , for practically anything . He had only lost one picture so far . This senseless solitary purchase depressed him whenever he thought of it . How dreary that cheque for four pounds ten was ! Who could have bought it ? It sold joylessly and fatally one day in an exhibition . Nine months previously Kreisler had arrived in Paris at the Gare de Lyon , from Italy . He had left Rome , according to his account , because the Italian creditor is such a bad - tempered fellow , and he could never get any sleep after 8 — or latterly 7.30 — even , in the morning . “
28227	28366	28222	28222	Yours	651	” He had dispatched this note before leaving to a Herr Ernst Volker . — For some time he stood on the Paris platform , ulster thrown back , smoking a lean cigar , with a straw stuck in it . He was glad to be in Paris . How busy the women , intent on travel , were ! Groups of town - folk , not travellers , stood like people at a show . Each traveller was met by a phalanx of uninterested faces beyond the gangway . His standing on the platform was a little ceremonious and military . He was taking his bearings . Body and belongings with him were always moved about with certain strategy . At last , with racial menace , he had his things swept together , saying heavily : ’ “
28370	28496	28222	28222	Yours	651	” Ernst Volker was not in , but had left word he would be there after dinner . It was in a pension . He rented a studio as well in the garden behind . The house was rather like a French Public Baths , twostoried , of a dirty purple colour . Kreisler looked up at it and felt that a very public sort of people must live there , looking big and idle in their rooms and constantly catching the eye of the stranger on the pavement . He was led to the studio in rear of the house , and asked to wait . He turned round several long canvases and was astonished to find dashing ladies in large hats before him . “
28510	28578	28508	28508	Ernst	191	” he exploded in his dull solitude , extremely amused . Volker had not done this in Rome . — Even there he had given indications of latent virtuosity , but had been curbed by classic presences . Since arriving in Paris he had blossomed prodigiously . He dealt out a vulgar vitality by the peck to each sitter , and they forgave him for making them comparatively “
28581	28752	28755	28755	Ernst	191	” He flung a man or woman on to nine feet of canvas and pummelled them on it for a couple of hours , until they promised to remain there or were incapable of moving , so to speak . He had never been able to treat people like this in any other way of life , and was grateful to painting for the experience . He always appeared to feel he would be expected to apologize for his brutal behaviour as an artist , and was determined not to do so . A half - hour later , on his return , the servant told him somebody was waiting in the studio . With face not exhibiting joyful surprise , but rather the collected look of a man of business arriving at his office , he walked out quickly across the garden . When he saw Kreisler the business look disappeared . Nothing of his private self remained for the moment , all engulfed in his friend ’s personality . “
28784	28785	28776	28776	I	0	” “
28803	28804	28791	28791	Your	191	” “
28849	28850	28854	28854	you	191	” “
28857	28858	28854	28854	you	191	” “
28871	28885	28854	28854	you	191	” He dismissed the out - of - date notion at once ! — “
28895	28949	28854	28854	you	191	” — Kreisler looked round as though measuring it . He noticed Volker ’s discomfort . He felt he was examining something more intimate than the public aspect of a dwelling . It was as though his friend were expecting a wife , whom Kreisler had not met , to turn up suddenly . “
28966	28967	28961	28961	you	191	” “
28981	28982	28983	28983	I	0	” “
29017	29032	28998	28998	’s	658	” They stayed till the small hours of the morning , in the midst of “
29036	29159	28998	28998	’s	658	” of the German bourgeois imagination , drinking champagne and toasting the creditors Kreisler had left behind in Rome . Kreisler , measured by chairs or doors , was of immoderate physical humanity . He was of that select section , corporally , that exceed the mean . His long round thighs stuck out like poles . This large body lounged and poised beside Volker in massive control and over - reaching of civilized matter . It was in Rome or in Paris . It had an air of possession everywhere . Volker was stranger in Paris than his companion , who had only just arrived . He felt a little raw and uncomfortable , almost a tourist . He was being shown “
29163	29490	28998	28998	’s	658	” ; almost literally , for his inclinations had not taken him much to that side of the town . Objects — cocottes , newsvendors , waiters — flowed through Kreisler ’s brain without trouble or surprise . His heavy eyes were big gates of a self - centred city . It was just a procession . There was no trade in the town . He was a property of Nature , or a favourite slave , untidy and aloof . Kreisler so real and at home was like a ghost sitting there beside him , for Ernst Volker . He had not had the time to solidify yet in Paris by all rights , and yet was so solid and accustomed at once . This body was in Paris now ! — with an heroic freedom . Volker began looking for himself . He was only made of cheap thin stuff . He picked up the pieces quietly . This large rusty machine of a man smashed him up like an egg - shell at every meeting . His shell grew quickly again , but never got hard enough . He was glad to see him again ! Kreisler was a good fellow . — Despite himself Ernst Volker was fidgety at the lateness of the hour . The next day Fraulein Bodenaar , who was sitting for him , was due at 9.30 . But the first night of seeing his friend again — He drank rather more than usual , and became silent , thinking of his Westphalian home and his sister who was not very well . She had had a bicycle accident , and had received a considerable shock . He might spend the summer with her and his mother at Berck - sur - Mer or Calais . He would have gone home for a week or so now , only an aunt he did not like was staying there . “
29498	29658	28998	28998	’s	658	” said Kreisler , rather thoughtful , too , at all the life he had seen . In Paris Ernst Volker had found himself . It seemed especially constructed for him , such a wonderful , large , polite institution . No one looked at him because he was small . For money in Paris represented delicate things , in Germany chiefly gross ones . His money lent him more stature than anything else could , and in a much more dignified and subtle way than elsewhere . His talent benefited for the first time by his money . Heavy temperament , primitive talent , had their big place , but money had at last come into its own and got into the spiritual sphere . A very sensible and soothing spirit reigned in this seat of intelligence . A very great number of sensible , well - dressed figures perambulated all over these suave acres . Large tribes of “
29660	30102	30103	30103	You	662	” prosecuted their primitive enthusiasms in certain cafés , unannoyed by either the populace or the differently minded € lite . The old romantic values he was used to in his Fatherland were all deeply modified . Money — that is luck and its power — was the genius of the new world . American clothes were adapted for the finer needs of the Western European . On the evening following Kreisler ’s arrival Volker had an engagement . The morning after that Kreisler turned up at half - past twelve . Volker was painting Fraulein Bodenaar . She was very smartly dressed , in a tight German way . He displayed a disinclination to make Kreisler and his sitter acquainted . He was a little confused . They arranged to meet at dinner - time . He was going to lunch with Fraulein Bodenaar . Kreisler the night before had spent a good deal of money in the German paradise beyond the river . Volker understood by the particular insistent blankness of Kreisler ’s eye that money was needed . He was familiar with this look . Kreisler owed him fifteen hundred marks . He had at first made an effort to pay back Volker money borrowed , when his allowance arrived . But in Rome , and earlier for a short time in Munich , his friend ’s money was not of so much value as it was at present . Ernst waived repayment in an eager , sentimental way . The debt grew . Kreisler had felt keenly the financial void caused by Volker ’s going off to Paris . He had not formulated to himself the real reason of his following Volker . Nor had he taken the trouble to repudiate it . He was now in the position of a man separated for some months from his wife . He was in a luxurious hurry to see once more the colour of Volker ’s gold . Kreisler was very touchy about money , like many borrowers . He sponged with discrimination . He had not for some time required to sponge at all , as Volker amply met his needs . So he had got rather out of practice . He found this reopening of his account with little friend Ernst a most delicate business . It was worse than tackling a stranger . He realized there might be a modification of Volker ’s readiness to lend . He therefore determined to ask for a sum in advance of actual needs , and by boldness at once re - establish continuity . After dinner he said : “
30201	30263	30190	30190	I	0	” he ended with florid truculence . Volker laughed obsequiously but with discomfort . Kreisler solicited his sympathetic mirth with a masterful eye . He laughed himself , unnecessarily heartily . A scene of violence in which a small man was hustled , which Volker would have to applaud , was a clever prelude . Then Otto began to be nice . “
30314	30384	30311	30312	My landlord	666	” He choked mirthfully over his coffee a little , almost upsetting it , then mincingly adjusted the cup to his moustached lips . If he had to settle up before he left , he could not have much now , evidently ! There was a disagreeable pause . Volker stirred his coffee . He immediately showed his hand , for he looked up and with transparent innocence asked : “
30397	30398	30399	30399	You	190	” “
30412	30428	30401	30406	the little Jew from whom everybody	667	” Kreisler fixed him severely and significantly with his eye and spoke with heavy deliberation . “
30475	30476	30477	30477	Hum	200	” “
30520	30543	30507	30507	He	198	” Was Volker thinking that Blauenstein ’s famous and admitted function should be resorted to as an alternative for himself by Kreisler ? “
30571	30578	30579	30579	My	0	” he laughed strongly and easily . “
30615	30616	30602	30602	you	191	” “
30630	30637	30602	30602	you	191	” These were three jerky efforts . “
30649	30655	30602	30602	you	191	” Volker ’s jaw dropped . “
30708	30756	30700	30700	I	0	” Volker had a clean - shaven , depressed , and earnest face . He had always been honest and timid . Kreisler looked sulkily at the tablecloth and knocked the ash sharply off his cigarette into his cup . He said nothing . Volker became nervous . “
30766	30767	30700	30700	I	0	” “
30770	30799	30700	30700	I	0	” Kreisler drew his hand over .his chin as though stroking a beard down and then pulled his moustaches up , fixing the waitress with an indifferent eye . “
30805	30806	30801	30801	you	0	” “
30823	31027	31030	31030	I	0	” This is how he lost Volker . He felt that hundred marks , given him as a favour , was the last serious bite he would get . He only gradually realized of how much more worth Volker ’s money now was , and what before was an unorganized mass of specie , in which the professional borrower could wallow , was now a sound and suitably conducted business . He met that night the new manager . He was taken round to the Berne after dinner . He did not realize what awaited him . He found himself in the head - quarters of many national personalities . Politeness reigned . Kreisler was pleased to find a permanent vat of German always on tap . His roots mixed sluggishly with Ernst ’s in this living lump of the soil of the Fatherland dumped down at the head of the Boulevard Pfeiffer . The Germans he met here spoke a language and expressed opinions he could not agree with , but with which Volker evidently did . They argued genially over glasses of beer and champagne . He found his ticket at once . He was the vielle barbe of the party . “
31070	31075	31046	31046	you	0	” he would bluster . “
31094	31106	31081	31081	you	0	” would answer a voice in the service of new movements . “
31207	31208	31185	31185	Fauve	204	” “
31274	31283	31284	31284	You	0	” Kreisler peered up at him and laughed . “
31305	31306	31301	31301	I	0	” “
31321	31322	31314	31314	Otto	190	” “
31329	31343	31325	31327	this young lady	688	” — and he turned gallantly to a blushing cocotte at his side — “
31349	31358	31325	31327	this young lady	688	” He kissed her amid gesticulation and applause . “
31366	31554	31325	31327	this young lady	688	” his opponent said , with appreciation . He did not get on well with Soltyk . Louis Soltyk was a young Russian , half Polish , who occasionally sat amongst the Germans at the Berne . Volker saw more of him than anybody . It was he who had superseded Kreisler in the position of influence as regards Volker ’s purse . Soltyk did not borrow a hundred marks . His system was far more up to date . Ernst had experienced an unpleasant shock in coming into contact with Kreisler ’s clumsy and slovenly , small - scale money habits again ! Soltyk physically bore , distantly and with polish , a resemblance to Kreisler . His handsome face and elegance were very different . Kreisler and he disliked each other for obscure physiological reasons : they had perhaps scrapped in the dressing - rooms of creation for some particular fleshly covering , and each secured only fragments of a coveted garment . In some ways , then , Soltyk was his efficient and more accomplished counterpart , although as empty and unsatisfactory as himself . “
31562	31574	31575	31575	He	691	” Soltyk would ask , referring to him usually like that . “
31582	31704	31575	31575	He	691	” Volker revealed Kreisler as a lady ’s man . This satisfied Soltyk ’s antipathy . The Russian kept an eye on Volker ’s pocket while Kreisler was about . He had not only recognized in him a mysterious and vexing kinship , with his instinct ; his sharper ’s sense , also , noted the signs of the professional borrower , the most contemptible and slatternly member of the crook family . In an access of sentiment Ernst asked his new friend to try and sell a painting of Kreisler ’s . Soltyk dealt in paintings and art objects . But Soltyk took him by the lapel of the coat and in a few words steadied him into cold sense . “
31713	31728	31754	31754	Kreisler	190	” he pulled out a handful of money and chose a dollar - piece . “
31765	32290	31754	31754	Kreisler	190	” Ernst introduced Kreisler next to another sort of Paris compatriot . It was a large female contingent this time . He took him round to Fraulein Lipmann ’s on her evening , when these ladies played the piano and met . Kreisler felt that he was a victim of strategy . He puffed and swore outside , complained of their music , the coffee , their way of dressing . The Lipmann circle could have stood as a model for Tarr ’s Bourgeois - Bohemians , stood for a group . For chief characteristic this particular BourgeoisBohemian set had the inseparability of its members . Should a man , joining them , wish to flirt with one F particularly , he must flirt with all — flatter all , take all to the theatre , carry the umbrellas and paint - boxes of all . Eventually , should he come to that , it is doubtful if a proposition of marriage could be made otherwise than before the assembled band ! And marriage alone could wrench the woman chosen away from the clinging bunch . Kreisler , despite his snorting , went again with Volker . The female charm had done its work . This gregarious female personality had shown such frank invitation to Volker that had any separate woman exhibited half as hospitable a front he would have been very alarmed . As it was , it had at first just fulfilled certain bourgeois requirements of his lonely German soul . Kreisler came a few weeks running to the Lipmann soiree . Never finding Volker there , he left off going as well . He felt he had been tricked and slighted . The ladies divined what had happened . Fraulein Lipmann , the leader , put a spiteful little mark down to each of their names . Kreisler pocketed Ernst ’s hundred marks and made no further attempt on the formerly hospitable income of his friend . Debts began accumulating . Only he found he had grown suddenly timid with his creditors . The concierge frightened him . He conciliated the garçon at the cafe , to whom he owed money . He even paid several debts that it was quite unnecessary to pay , in a moment of panic and weakness . A straitened week ensued . At the Berne he had lost his nerve in some way ; he clowned obsequiously on some evenings , and , depressed and slack the next , perhaps , resented his companions ’ encores . Next he gradually developed the habit of sitting alone . More often than not he would come into the café and go to a table at the opposite side of the room to that at which the Germans were sitting . Ridicule is sighted at twenty yards , the spectator then , without the sphere of average immediate magnetism . For once it does not matter , but if persisted in it inevitably results in humour . Those who keep to themselves awaken mirth as a cartwheel running along the road by itself would . People feel with the “
32292	32416	31754	31754	Kreisler	190	” man that he is going about with some eccentric companion — that is himself . Why did he choose this deaf - and - dumb companion ? What do they find to say ? He is ludicrous as two men would be who , perpetually in each other ’s company , were never seen to exchange a word — who dined together , went to theatre or café , without ever looking at each other or speaking . So Kreisler became a lonely figure . It was a strange feeling . He must be quiet and not attract attention . He . was marked in some way as though he had committed a theft . Perhaps it was merely the worry of perpetual “
32418	33212	31754	31754	Kreisler	190	” beginning to tell . For the moment he would just put himself aside and see what happened . He was afraid of himself too . Always up till then immersed in that self , now for the first time he stood partly outside it . This slight divorce made him less sure in his actions . A little less careful of his appearance , he went sluggishly about , smoking , reading the paper a great deal , working at the art school fairly often , playing billiards with an Austrian cook whose acquaintance he had made in a café and who disappeared owing him seven francs . Volker had been a compendious phenomenon in his life , although his cheery gold had attracted him to the more complete discovery . He had ousted women , too , from Kreisler ’s daily needs . He had become a superstition for his tall friend . It was Kreisler ’s deadness , his absolute lack of any reason to be confident and yet perfect aplomb , that mastered his companion . But this acquired eventually its significance as well , for Kreisler . The inertia and phlegm , outward sign of depressing everyday Kreisler , had found some one for whom they were a charm and something to be envied . Kreisler ’s imagination woke shortly after Volker ’s . It was as though a peasant who had always regarded his life as the dullest affair , were suddenly inspirited about himself by realizing some townsman ’s poetic notion of him . Kreisler ’s moody wastefulness and futility had found a raison d’etre and meaning . Ernst Volker had remained for three vague years becalmed on this empty sea . Kreisler basked round him , never having to lift his waves and clash them together as formerly he had been forced sometimes to do . There had been no appeals to life . Volker had been the guarantor of his peace . His failure was the omen of the sinking ship , the disappearance of the rats ! Then they had never arrived at terms of friendship . It had been only an epic acquaintanceship , and Kreisler had taken him about as a parasite that he pretended not to notice . There was no question , therefore , of a reproach at desertion . He merely hopped off on to somebody else . Kreisler was more exasperated at this than at the defection of a friend , who could be fixed down , and from whom at last explanation must come . It was an unfair advantage taken . A man had no right to accompany you in that distant and paradoxical fashion , get all he could , become ideally useful , unless it was for life . He watched Soltyk ’s success with distant mockery . Volker ’s loves were all husks , of illogical completeness . A man appeared one day in the Berne who had known Kreisler in Munich . The story of Kreisler ’s marrying his fiancee to his father then became known . Other complications were alleged in which Otto ’s paternity played a part . The dot of the bride was another obscure matter . It was during his aloofness . He looked the sort of man , the party agreed , who would splice his sweetheart with his papa or reinforce his papa ’s affairs with a dot he did not wish to pay for at last with his own person . The Berne was also informed that Kreisler had to keep seventeen children in Munich alone ; that he only had to look at a woman for her to become pregnant . It was when the head of the column , the eldest of the seventeen , emerged into boyhood , requiring instruction , that Kreisler left for Rome . Since then a small society had been founded in Bavaria to care for Kreisler ’s offsprings throughout Germany . This great capacity of Otto ’s was , naturally , not admired ; at the best it could be considered as a misdirected and disordered efficiency . The stories pleased , nevertheless . When he appeared that night his friends turned towards his historic figure with cries of welcome . But he was not gregarious . He missed his opportunity . He took a seat in the passage - way leading to the Bureau de Tabac . As their laughter struck him through his paper he was unstrung enough to be annoyed . He frowned and puckered up his eyes , and two flushed lines descended from his eyes to his jaw . On their way out one or two of his compatriots greeted him : “
33220	33221	33222	33222	Hush	211	” “
33239	33241	31754	31754	Kreisler	190	” , “
33250	33367	33244	33245	old Otto	189	” He shook them off with mixture of affected anger and genuine spitting oaths . He avoided their eyes and spat blasphemously at his beer . He avoided the café for some days . Kreisler then recovered . At first nothing much happened . He had just gone back again into the midst of his machinery like a bone slipped into its place , with a soft crick . He became rather more firm with his creditors . He changed his rooms ( moving then to the Boulevard Pfeiffer ) , passed an occasional evening with the Germans at the Berne , and started a portrait of Suzanne , who had been sitting at the school . “
33379	33388	33374	33374	he	191	” Fraulein Lipmann asked him when they met . “
33395	33620	33244	33245	old Otto	189	” People ’s actual or possible proceedings formed in very hard - and - fast mould in Kreisler ’s mind , seen not with realism , but through conventions of his suspicious irony . This solicitude as to Volker he contrasted with their probable indifference as regards his old , shabby , and impolite self . But he went round , his reception being insipid . He had shown no signs of animation or interest in them . Both he and the ladies were rather doubtful as to why he came at all . No pleasure resulted on either side from these visits , yet they doggedly continued . A distinct and steady fall in the temperature could be observed . He sneered , as though the aimlessness of his visits were an insult that had at last been taken up . They would have been for ever discontinued except for a sudden necessity to reopen that channel of bourgeois intercourse . On the first day of his letter being overdue , a convenient way of counting , Otto rose late , from a maze of shallow dreams , and was soon dressed , wanting to get out of his room . As the clock struck one he slammed his door and descended the stairs alertly . The concierge , on the threshold of her “
33623	33629	33244	33245	old Otto	189	” peered up at him . “
33642	33662	33633	33634	Madame Leclerc	212	” said Kreisler , in his heavy French , his cold direct gaze incongruously ornamented by a cheerful smile . “
33671	33681	33663	33663	Monsieur	696	” replied the concierge , with very faint amiability . “
33700	33731	33244	33245	old Otto	189	” He grinned mysteriously . The watch had gone the way of the dress clothes some days already . She followed him slowly along the passage , become extremely grave . “
33738	34038	33244	33245	old Otto	189	” With a look of perplexed distrust she watched him down the street . — This German good humour and sudden expansiveness has always been a portentous thing to French people . Latin races are as scandalized at northern amenities , the badness of our hypocrisies or manners and total immodesty displayed , as the average man of Teutonic race is with the shameful perfection of and ease in deceit shown by the French neighbour . Kreisler , still beneath the eye of the concierge , with his rhythmic martial tread , approached the restaurant . A few steps from the threshold he slowed down , dragging his long German boots , which acted as brakes . The Restaurant Lejeune , like many others in Paris , had been originally a clean , tranquil little creamery , consisting of a small shop a few feet either way . — Then one customer after another had become more gluttonous . He had asked , in addition to his daily glass of milk , for beefsteak and spinach , or some other terrific nourishment , which the decent little business at first supplied with timid protest . But perpetual scenes of sanguine voracity — weeks of compliance with the most brutal and unbridled appetites of man — gradually brought about a change in its character . — It became frankly a place where the most carnivorous palate might be palled . As trade grew , the small business had burrowed backwards into the house — the victorious flood of commerce had burst through walls and partitions , flung down doors , discovered many dingy rooms in the interior that it instantly filled with serried cohorts of eaters . It had driven out terrified families , had hemmed the apoplectic concierge in her “
34041	34329	33244	33245	old Otto	189	” it had broken out on to the court at the back in shed - like structures . And in the musty bowels of the house it had established a broiling , luridly - lighted , roaring den , inhabited by a rushing and howling band of slatternly savages . — The chef ’s wife sat at a desk immediately fronting the entrance door . When a diner had finished , adding up the bill himself on a printed slip of paper , he paid it there on his way out . In the first room a tunnel - like and ill - lit recess furnished with a long table formed a cul - de - sac to the left . Into this Kreisler got . At the right - hand side the passage led to the inner rooms . A mind feeling the need for things clean and clear cut would have been better content , although demurring , with Kreisler ’s military morning suit , slashed with thick seams ; carefully cut hair , short behind , a little florid and bunched on the top ; his German high - crowned bowler hat , and plain cane , than the Charivari of the Artfashion and uniform of The Brush in those about him , chiefly students from the neighbouring Art schools . He was staring at the bill of fare when some one took the seat in front of him . — He looked up , put down the card . A young woman was sitting there , who now seemed waiting , as though Kreisler might be expected , after a rest , to take up the menu again and go on reading it . “
34338	34362	34336	34336	I---	698	” At the sound of her voice he moved a little forward , and in handing it to her , spoke in German . “
34366	34423	34336	34336	I---	698	” she said , smiling with a German nod of racial recognition . He ordered his soup . — Usually this meal passed in surly impassible inspection of his neighbours and the newspaper . Staring at and through the figure in front of him , he spent several minutes . He seemed making up his mind . “
34429	34496	34569	34569	Jeanne	213	” Jeanne said , who was waiting to take his order . Contrary to custom , he sought for some appetizing dish , to change the routine . Appetite had not woken , but he had become restless before the usual dull programme . There were certain tracts of menu he never explored . His eye always guided him at once to the familiar place where the “
34500	34543	34544	34544	My	0	” was to be found , and the alternative sweets heading the list . He now plunged his eye down the long line of unfamiliar dishes . He fixed his eye on Jeanne with indecision too , and picked up the menu . “
34553	34557	34544	34544	My	0	” he thought . “
34571	34826	34569	34569	Jeanne	213	” he called out . This awakening to beauties of the menu brought with it a survey of his neighbour . Vaguely , she must be connected with lobster salad . How could that be ? First he was surprised that such a beautiful girl should be sitting there . Beautiful people wander dangerously about in life , just like ordinary folk . He appeared to think that they should be isolated like powder magazines or lepers . This man could never leave good luck alone , or reflect that that , too , was a dangerous vagrant . He could not quite grasp that it was a general good luck and easily explained phenomenon . He had already been examined by the beautiful girl . Throwing an absent far - away look into her eyes , she let them wander over him . Afterwards she cast them down into her soup . As a pickpocket , after brisk work in a crowd , hurries home to examine and evaluate his spoil , so she then examined collectedly what her dreamy eyes had noted . This method was not characteristic of her , but of the category of useful habits bequeathed us , each sex having its own . Perhaps in her cloudy soup she beheld something of the storm and shock that inhabited her neighbour . Without preliminary reflection Kreisler found himself addressing her , a little abashed when he suddenly heard his voice , and with eerie feeling when it was answered . “
34848	34849	34840	34840	you	699	” “
34862	34874	34852	34852	I	0	” She settled her elbows on the table for a moment . “
34892	34903	34876	34876	me	0	” This was like a lesson . He started ponderously . “
34982	34983	34961	34961	you	699	” “
34986	34997	34998	34998	I	0	” laughed the young woman , with good German gutteral . “
35012	35013	35014	35014	Garlic	215	” “
35032	35033	35026	35026	his	702	” “
35041	35613	35614	35614	My	0	” She was indulgent to his clowning , and drawled a little in sympathy . Between language and feeding , Kreisler sought to gain the young lady ’s confidence , adhering conventionally to the progress of Creation . He found his neighbour inclined to slight Nature . He , too , was a little overlooked ; in waiving of conventions being blandly forestalled . There was something uncomfortable about all this . He must brace himself He realized with the prophetic logic of his hysteria , racing through the syllogisms his senses divined , sensations now anachronisms , afterwards recognized as they burst out in due course . This precocity in the restaurant took him to the solution of what their coming together might mean . One plethoric impression of her was received — although from her — instalment of a senseless generosity . She wore a heavy black burnous , very voluminous and severe ; a large ornamental bag was on the chair at her side , which you expected to contain herbs and trinkets , paraphernalia of the witch , rather than powder , lip - cream , and secrets . Her hat was immense and sinuous ; generally she implied an egotistic code of advanced order , full of insolent strategies . Other women in the restaurant appeared dragged down and drained of vitality by their clothes beside her , Kreisler thought , although she wore so much more than they did . Her large square - shouldered and slim body swam in hers like a duck . When she laughed , this commotion was transmitted to her body as though sharp , sonorous blows had been struck on her mouth . Her lips were long , hard bubbles risen in the blond heavy pool of her face , ready to break , pitifully and gaily . Grown forward with ape - like intensity , they refused no emotion noisy egress if it got so far . Her eyes were , large , stubborn , and reflective , brown coming out of blondness . Her head was like a deep white egg in a tobacco - coloured nest . She exuded personality with alarming and disgusting intensity . It was an ostentation similar to diamonds and gold watch - chains . Kreisler felt himself in the midst of a cascade , a hot cascade . She seemed to feel herself a travelling circus of tricks and wonders , beauty shows and monstrosities . Quite used to being looked at , she had become resigned to inability to avoid performing . She possessed the geniality of public character and the genius of sex . Kreisler was a strange loafer talked to easily , without any consciousness of condescension . Just as he was most out of his depth , Kreisler had run up against all this ! It all had the mellowness of sunset , and boomed in this small alcove infernally . — By the fact of sex this figure seems to offer him a traditional substantiality . He clutches at it eagerly as at something familiar and unmetamorphosed — and somewhat unmetamorphosable — by Fate . In the first flush he revolves with certain skill in this new champ de manoeuvres , executing one or two very pretty gymnastics . He has only to flatter himself on the excellent progress , really , that he makes . _ “
35619	35691	35692	35692	Anastasya	216	” she says irrelevantly to him , as if she had stupidly forgotten , before , this little detail . Whew ! his poor ragged eyelashes flutter , a cloud of astonishment passes grotesquely over his face ; like the clown of the piece , he looks as though he were about to rub his head , click his tongue , and give his nearest man - neighbour an enthusiastic kick . “
35694	35698	35692	35692	Anastasya	216	” It will be “
35700	35742	35743	35743	I	0	” soon ! He outwardly becomes more solemn than ever , like a merchant who sees an incredible dupe before him , and would in some way conceal his exhilaration . But he calls her carefully at regular intervals , Anastasya ! “
35752	35756	35757	35757	I	0	” he asked . “
35781	35794	35770	35770	I	0	” He could well believe it ; she must do some overtime ! “
35803	35834	35770	35770	I	0	” This was evidently , Kreisler felt , the moment to touch on the heaviness of life ’s burden ; as her expression was perfectly even and non - committal . “
35839	35854	35770	35770	I	0	” he sighed heavily , one side of the menu rising gustily and relapsing , “
35861	35869	35770	35770	I	0	” She looked at him and reflected , “
35881	35882	35770	35770	I	0	” “
35891	35892	35884	35884	you	0	” “
35895	35906	35884	35884	you	0	” — She laughed with ostentatious satisfaction at his funniness . “
35979	36010	36011	36011	I	0	” She opened her eyes wide ; Kreisler pricked up his ears and wondered if this were to be taken in another sense . He cast down his eyes respectfully . “
36033	36041	35955	35955	your	0	” Kreisler lingered over her first observation : “
36047	36085	35955	35955	your	0	” The indirect compliment conveyed ( and he felt , when it was said , that he was somewhere near the frontier , surely , of a German confidence ) was rather mitigated by what followed . The “
36092	36108	36110	36110	you	705	” ; that was very universal , and included him too easily in its sweep . “
36117	36133	36110	36110	you	705	” he asked , with heavy plagiarism of her accent , and solemn sentimental face . “
36142	36296	36134	36134	I	0	” His eyes struggled with hers ; he was easily thrown . But she had the regulation feminine foible of charity he reassured himself , by her answer . Kreisler ’s one great optimism was a belief in the efficacy of women . — You did not deliberately go there — at least , he usually did not — unless you were in straits . But there they were all the time , vast dumping - ground for sorrow and affliction — a world - dimensioned pawnshop , in which you could deposit not your dress - suit or garments , but yourself , temporarily , in exchange for the gold of the human heart . Their hope consisted , no doubt , in the reasonable uncertainty as to whether you would ever be able to take yourself out again . Kreisler had got in and out again almost as many times as his “
36298	36431	36432	36432	his	706	” in its pawnshop . Women were Art or expression for him in this way . They were Man ’s Theatre . The Tragedies played there purged you periodically of the too violent accumulations of desperate life . There its burden of laughter as well might be exploded . — Woman was a confirmed Schauspielerin or play - actress ; but coming there for illusion he was willingly moved . Much might be noticed in common between him and the drunken navvy on Saturday night , who comes home bellicosely towards his wife , blows raining gladly at the mere sight of her . He may get practically all the excitement and exertion he violently needs , without any of the sinister chances a more real encounter would present . His wife is “
36435	36683	36134	36134	I	0	” of unreality , or play . He can declaim , be outrageous to the top of his bent ; can be maudlin too ; all conducted almost as he pleases , with none of the shocks of the real and too tragic world . In this manner woman was the aesthetic element in Kreisler ’s life . Love , too , always meant unhappy love for him , with its misunderstandings and wistful separations . He issued forth solemnly and the better for it . He approached a love affair as the deutscher Student engages in a student ’s duel — no vital part exposed , but where something spiritually of about the importance of a nose might be lost ; at least stoically certain that blood would be drawn . A casual observer of the progress of Otto Kreisler ’s life might have said that the chief events , the crises , consisted of his love affairs — such as that unfortunate one with his present stepmother . — But , in the light of a careful analysis , this would have been an inversion of the truth . When the events of his life became too unwieldy or overwhelming , he converted them into love , as he might have done , with specialized talent , into some art or other . He was a sculptor — a German sculptor of a mock - realistic and degenerate school — in the strange sweethearting of the “
36688	36783	36134	36134	I	0	” The two or three women he had left about the world in this way — although perhaps those symbolic statues had grown rather characterless in Time ’s weather and perhaps lumpish — were monuments of his perplexities . After weeks of growing estrangement , he would sever all relations suddenly one day — usually on some indigestible epigram , that worried the poor girl for the rest of her days . Being no adept in the science of his heart , there remained a good deal of mystery for him about the appearance of “
36785	36879	36880	36880	I	0	” in his life . He felt that she was always connected with its important periods ; he thought , superstitiously , that his existence was in some way implicated with dem Weib . She was , in any case , for him , a stormy petrel . He would be killed by a woman , he sometimes thought . This superstition had flourished with him before he had yet found for it much raison d'etre . — A serious duel having been decided on in his early student days , this reflection , “
36894	37377	36890	36890	I	0	” had given him a grisly coolness . His opponent nearly got himself killed , because he , for his part , had no hard and fast theory about the sort of death in store for him . This account , to be brought up to date , must be modified . Since knowing Volker , no woman had come conspicuously to disturb him . Volker had been the ideal element of balance in his life . But between this state — the minimum degree of friendship possible — a distant and soothing companionship — and more serious states , there was no possible foothold for Kreisler . Friendship usually dates from unformed years . But Love still remains in full swing long after Kreisler ’s age at that time ; a sort of spurious and intense friendship . An uncomfortable thing happened now . He realized suddenly all the possibilities of this chance acquaintanceship , plainly and cinematographically . — He was seized with panic . — He must make a good impression . — From that moment he ran the risk of doing the reverse . For he was unaccustomed to act with calculation . — There he was like some individual who had gone nonchalantly into the presence of a prince ; who — just in the middle of the audience — when he would have been getting over his first ’ embarrassment — is overcome with a tardy confusion , the imagination in some way giving a jump . It is the imagination , repressed and as it were slighted , revenging itself . Casting about desperately for means of handling the situation , he remembered she had spoken of getting a dog to guide her . — What had she meant ? Anyway , he grasped at the dog . He could regain possession of himself in romantic stimulus of this figure . He would be her dog ! Lie at her feet ! He would fill with a merely animal warmth and vivacity the void that must exist in her spirit . His imagination , flattered , came in as ally . This , too , exempted him from the necessity of being victorious . All he asked was to be her dog ! — only wished to impress her as a dog ! Even if she did not feel much sympathy for him now , no matter . — He would humbly follow her up , put himself at her disposal , not be exigent . It was a role difficult to refuse him . Sense of security the humility of this resolution brought about caused him to regain a self - possession . Only it imposed the condition , naturally , of remaining a dog . — Every time he felt his retiring humbleness giving place to another sensation , he anew felt qualms . “
37386	37452	37379	37379	you	707	” he asked , with a new deference in his tone — hardly a canine whine , but deep servient bass of the faithful St. Bernard . — She seemed to have noticed this something new already , and Kreisler on all fours evidently astonished her . She was inclined to stroke him , but at the same time to ask what was the matter . “
37478	37492	37476	37476	Otto	190	” Confidence for confidence , he had told Anastasya that he was Otto . “
37495	37503	37476	37476	Otto	190	” he said , with reverent eagerness . “
37546	37558	37528	37528	I	0	” Otto flung himself back in his chair with dramatic incredulity . “
37661	37790	37649	37650	her people	718	” Kreisler looked at her rather dully , and smiled solemnly , with really something of the misplaced and unaccountable pathos and protest of dogs ( although still with a slavish wagging of the tail ) at some pleasantry of the master . — Her expansiveness , as a fact , embarrassed him very much at this point . He was divided between his inclination to respond to it in some way , and mature their acquaintance at once , and his determination to be merely a dog . Yet he felt that her familiarity , if adopted , in turn , by him , might not be the right thing . And yet , as it was , he would appear to be holding back , would seem “
37792	37883	37886	37886	you	720	” in his mere humility . He was a very perplexed dog for some time . He remained dumb , smiling up at her with appealing pathos from time to time . She wondered if he had indigestion or what . He made several desperate dog - like sorties . But she saw he was clearly in difficulties . — As her lunch was finished , she called the waitress . — Her bill was made out , Kreisler scowling at her all the while . Her attitude , suggesting , “
37906	38357	37895	37895	I	0	” was responded to by him with the same offended dignity as the drunken man displays when his unsteadiness is observed . He repudiated sulkily the suggestion that there was anything wrong . Then he grew angry with her . His nervousness was her doing . — All was lost . He was very near some violence . — But when she stood up , he was so impressed that he sat gaping after her . He remained cramped in his place until she had left the restaurant . He moved in his chair stiffly ; he ached as though he had been sitting for his portrait . The analogy struck him . Had he been sitting for his portrait ? These people dining near him as though they had suddenly appeared out of the ground — he was embarrassed at finding himself alone with them . They knew all that had happened , but were pretending not to . He had not noticed that they were there all round him , overhearing and looking on . It was as though he had been talking to himself , and had just become aware of it . A tide of magnetism had flowed away , leaving him bare and stranded . — He cursed his stupidity . He then stopped this empty mental racket abruptly . — Only a few minutes had passed since Anastasya ’s departure . He seized hat and stick and hurried up to the desk . — Once outside he gave his glasses an adjusting pull , gazed up and down the boulevard in all directions . No sign of the tall figure he was pursuing . He started off , partly at a run , in the likeliest direction . — At the Café Berne corner , where several new vistas opened , there she was , some way down the Boulevard du Paradis , on the edge of the side - walk , waiting till a tram had passed to cross . Having seen so much , should he not go back ? For there was nothing else to be done . To catch her up and force himself on her could have only one result , he thought . He might , perhaps , follow a little way . That was being done already . They went on for some hundred yards , she a good distance ahead on the other side of the boulevard . Walking for a moment , his eyes on the ground , he looked up and caught her head pivoting slowly round . She no doubt had seen him . — With shame he realized what was happening . — “
38399	38609	38379	38379	I	0	” Either he must catch her up at once or vanish . He promptly turned up a side street , and circled round to his starting - point . His nature would probably have sought to fill up the wide , shallow gap left by Ernst and earlier ties either by another Ernst or , more likely , a variety of matter . It would have been only a temporary stopping . Now a gold crown , regal person , had fallen on the hollow . But his nature was an effete machine and incapable of working on all that glory . Desperate at dullness , he betook himself to self - lashings . He would respond to utmost of weakened ability ; with certainty of failure , egotistically , but not at a standstill . Kreisler was a German who , by all rights and rules of the national temperament , should have committed suicide some weeks earlier . Anastasya became an ideé fixe . He was a machine , dead weight of old iron , that , started , must go dashing on . His little - dog simile was veritably carried out in his scourings of the neighbourhood , in hope of crossing Anastasya . But these “
38611	39196	39222	39222	Kreisler	190	” gave no result . Benignant apparition , his roughness had scared it away , and off the earth , for ever . He entered , even infested , all painting schools of the quarter . He rapidly pursued distant equivocal figures in streets and gardens . Each rendered up its little quota of malignant hope , then presented him with a face of monotonous strangeness . It was Saturday when Kreisler was found preparing to take his valise to the Mont de Piété . On the preceding evening he had paid one of his unaccountable calls on Fraulein Lipmann , the first for some time . He had a good reason for once . This salon was the only place of comparatively public assembly in the quarter he had not visited . Entering with his usual slight air of mystification , he bent to kiss Fraulein Lipmann ’s hand in a vaguely significant fashion . The blank reciprocal indifference of these calls was thus relieved . It awoke a vague curiosity on one side , a little playful satisfaction on the other . This might even have ripened into a sort of understanding and bonhomie . He did not pursue it or develop the role . After a half - hour of musing on the brink of a stream of conversation and then music , he suddenly recognized something , flotsam bobbing past . It had bobbed past before several times . He gradually became steadily aware of it . A dance at the Bonnington Club , that would take place the following evening , was the event that arrested him . Why was this familiar ? Anastasya ? Anastasya had spoken of it . That was all he could remember . Would she be there ? He at once , and as though he had come there to do so , fished delicately in this same stream of tepid , chatter for an invitation to the dance . Fraulein Lipmann , the fish he particularly angled , for , was backward . They did not seem to want him very much at the dance . Nevertheless , after an hour of indefatigable manoeuvring , the exertion of many powers seldom put forth in that salon , he secured the form , not the spirit , of an invitation . Kreisler saw , in his alarmed fancy , Anastasya becoming welded into this gregarious female personality . The energy and resource of the Devil himself would be required to extricate her . She must be held back from this slough for the moment he needed . Was it too late to intercept her ? But he felt he might do it . The eyes of these ladies , so far dull with indifference , would open . He would be seen as a being with a new mysterious function . He felt that Volker ’s absence from their reunions was due to his not wishing to meet him . They , too , must see that . Now the enigmatical and silent doggedness of these visits would seem explained . He would appear like some unwieldy , deliberate parasite got on to their indivisible body . The invitation given , he made haste to go . If he stayed much longer it would be overlaid with all sorts of offensive and effacing matter , and be hardly fit for use . A defiant and jeering look on his face , he withdrew with an “
39202	39210	39222	39222	Kreisler	190	” It was at this point that the “
39212	39217	39222	39222	Kreisler	190	” came into prominence . “
39230	39310	39485	39485	I	0	” Suzanne stood at attention before him in the hall of the Mont de Pi&A. If she had been inexorable before , she was now doubly so beneath the eyes of the veritable officials . The sight of them , and the half - official status of go - between and interpreter , urged her to ape - like importance . With flushed and angry face , raised eyebrows , shocked at his questioning the verdict , she repeated , “
39319	39320	39485	39485	I	0	” “
39333	39455	39329	39329	me	0	” he said . She gave it him in silence , eyebrows still raised , eyes fixed , staring with intelligent disapproval right in front of her . She did not look at her eminent countrymen behind the large counter . But her intelligent and significant stare , lost in space , was meant to meet and fraternize with probable similar stares of theirs , lost in the same intelligent void . Her face fixed in distended , rubicund , discontentedly resigned mask , she walked on beside him , the turkey - like backward - forward motion of fat neck marking her ruffled state . Kreisler sat down on a bench of the Boulevard du Paradis , she beside him . “
39466	39480	39460	39460	you	0	” she said at last . Kreisler was tired . He got up . “
39500	39514	39496	39496	I	0	” ' Suzanne listened , with protesting grin . Her head nodded energetically . “
39526	39536	39460	39460	you	0	” He pushed his moustache up and frowned pathetically . “
39542	39546	39547	39547	Volker	219	” she asked . “
39559	39560	39554	39554	He	219	” “
39578	39579	39554	39554	He	219	” “
39584	39631	39554	39554	He	219	” Kreisler left Suzanne seated , staring after him . The portmanteau dragged along , he strode past a distant figure . Suzanne saw him turn round and examine the stranger ’s face . Then she lost sight of them round a corner of the boulevard . “
39635	40140	39554	39554	He	219	” she exclaimed to herself , nearly as the concierge had done . She sauntered back home , giving Kreisler the benefit of several sour reflections . In a little room situated behind the Rue de la Gaïté , she pulled open one of two drawers in her washstand , which contained a little bread , tea , potatoes , and a piece of cold fish . She spread out a sheet of the Petit Parisien beside the basin . Having peeled the potatoes and put them on the gas , she took off those outdoor things that just enabled her to impart a turkey - like movement to her person . Then , dumpy , in a salmon - check petticoat , her legs bowed backwards and her stomach stuck out , she stood moodily at the window . A man she knew , now in the Midi , sent her now and then a few francs . This rueful spot , struck in image of this elementary dross of humanity , was Kreisler ’s occasional haunt . Cell of the unwieldy , tragic brain of the city , with million other similar cells , representing overwhelming uniform force of brooding in that brain , attracted him like a desert or ocean . He would listen solemnly , like a great judge , to Suzanne ’s perpetual complaints , sitting on the edge of her bed , hat on head . She was so humble and so pretentious . Her imagination was arrogant and constantly complaining . The form her complaints took was always that of lies — needless , dismal lies . She could not grumble without inventing and she never stopped grumbling . This , then , was one of Kreisler ’s dwellings . He lived at large . Some of his rooms , such as this , the Cafe de Berne , and Juan Soler ’s School of Art , he shared with others . On very troubled days his body , like the finger of a weather - glass , would move erratically . When found in Suzanne ’s room it might be taken as an indication of an unsettled state . A tendency to remain at home , on the contrary , denoted mostly a state of equilibrium and peace . CHAPTER VIII The portmanteau fell under the bed ; he crushed into the red bulbous cover . Kreisler never sat on his bed except when going to get into it . For another man it would have replaced the absent armchair . In those moments of depression in which he did so he always , at once , felt more depressed , or quite hopeless . Head between hands , he now stared at the floor . Four or five hours ! He must raise money , else he could not go to the dance . How absurd , this fuss about such a sum ! All the same , how the devil could he get it ? “
40152	40168	40146	40146	I	0	” he thought to himself . He began repeating this stupidly , and stuck at word “
40172	40351	40146	40146	I	0	” His brain and mouth clogged up , he stuttered thickly in his mind . He sprang up . But the slovenly , hopeless quality of the bed clung to him . This was a frivolous demonstration . He wandered to the window ; stood staring out , nose flattened against the pane . The sudden quiet and idleness of his personality was an awakening after the little nightmare of Suzanne . But it was not a refreshing one . His portmanteau had always received certain consideration , as being , next the dress - suit , the most dependable article among those beneath his sway — to come to his aid if their common existence were threatened . He had now thrown it under the bed with disgust . He and all his goods were rubbish for the streets . He sauntered from the window to the bed and back . Whenever he liked , in a sense , he would open the door and go out ; but still , until then ( and when would he “
40353	40623	40673	40675	Master ” Lowndes	2963	” ? ) he was a poor prisoner . Outside , he took some strength and importance from others . In here he touched bottom and realized what the Kreisler - self was , with four walls round it . His muscles were still full . They symbolized his uselessness . The thought , so harsh and tyrannical , of his once more going to the window and gazing down at the street beneath made him draw back his chair . He sat midway in the room , looking steadily out at the housetops . But , like his vigorous muscles and his deadness , there was the same contradiction ; his mechanical obstinacy as regards Anastasya and his comic activity at present to get to a dance . Comrades at painting school , nodding acquaintances , etc . , were once more run through . None valued his acquaintance at more than thirty centimes , if that . Perhaps Anastasya had left Paris ? This solution , occurring sometimes , had only made his activity during the last few days more mad and mechanical — the pursuit of a shadow . Ten minutes later , through a series of difficult clockwork - like actions , he had got once more to Lejeune ’s to have lunch . With disgust he took what had been his usual seat latterly , at the table in the recess ; the one place , he was sure , Anastasya would never be found in again , wherever else she might be found . Lunch nearly over , he caught sight of Lowndes . “
40629	40654	40626	40627	Master Lowndes	223	” he called out — always assuming great bluffness and brutality , as he called it , with English people , and laborious opposite to “
40657	40658	40673	40675	Master ” Lowndes	2963	” “
40664	40672	40673	40675	Master ” Lowndes	2963	” The moment his eye had fallen on “
40674	40874	40673	40675	Master ” Lowndes	2963	” Lowndes this friend ’s probable national opulence had occurred to him as a tantalizing fact . No gross decision could be come to in that moment . Lowndes was called to be kept there a little bit , while he turned things over and made up his mind . This was an acquaintance existing chiefly on chaff and national antithesis . It meant nothing to him . What matter if he were refused ? Lowndes not being a compatriot made it easier . Something must be sacrificed . Lowndes ’ acquaintanceship was a possession something equivalent to a cheap ring , a souvenir . He must part with it , if necessary . Lowndes grinned at sight of Kreisler . He had finished his own lunch and was just going off . He had almost forgotten his idea in coming to the restaurant , that of seeing his German acquaintance . Swaying from side to side on his two superlatively elastic calves , he sat down opposite the good Otto , who leered back , blinking . He spoke German better than Kreisler any other language , so they used that , after a little flourish of English . “
40885	40886	40673	40675	Master ” Lowndes	2963	” “
40889	40893	40673	40675	Master ” Lowndes	2963	” replied Kreisler . “
40913	40941	40905	40906	My father	639	” This subject seemed no more important than his speech made it , and yet it filled his life . Lowndes smiled correctly , not suspecting realities . “
40947	41176	40945	40945	Douglas	224	” This was a friend through whom they had known each other in Italy . Why should this fellow lend him thirty francs ? The grin would not be there , he felt , had he been conscious that the other was thinking of the contents of his pocket . Not humour , but a much colder stuff no doubt mounted guard over his pocket - book , guarantee of this easiness and health . Oh , the offensive prosperity of the English , smugness of middle - class affluence ! etc . etc . Kreisler imagined the change that would come over this face when there was question of thirty francs . Estrangement set in on his side already , anger and humiliation at the imagined expression . This was of help . Here was his chance of borrowing that very insignificant but illusive sum . The man was already an enemy . He would willingly have knocked him on the head and taken his money had they been in a quiet place . The complacent health and humoristic phlegm with which he grinned and perambulated through life charged Kreisler with the contempt natural to his more stiff and human education . His relations with him hinging on mild racial differences , he saw behind him the long line of all the Englishmen he had ever known . “
41180	41184	41177	41178	Useless swine	731	” he thought , “
41199	41200	41196	41197	a peasant	2233	” “
41226	41227	41220	41220	I	0	” “
41237	41238	41231	41231	you	0	” “
41260	41261	41247	41247	I	0	” “
41283	41284	41288	41288	he	731	” “
41294	41304	41288	41288	he	731	” Lowndes laughed innocently . Kreisler surveyed him unsympathetically . “
41317	41321	41310	41310	your	0	” he asked . “
41339	41344	41329	41329	I	0	” Kreisler was thinking : “
41388	41389	41382	41382	He	731	” “
41398	41402	41382	41382	He	731	” he blinked . “
41422	41423	41424	41424	I	0	” “
41450	41531	41427	41427	I	0	” Kreisler stared fixedly at him — a way of covering discomfiture felt at this news . The old address reminded him of several little debts there . For this reason he had not told them where he was going . The concierge would complain of her old tenant ; probably , even , Lowndes might have been shown derelict tradesmen ’s bills . Not much encouragement for his proposed victim ! Lowndes was writing on a piece of paper . “
41541	41552	41534	41534	my	0	” Kreisler looked at it rather fussily and said over : “
41560	41568	41558	41558	Lowndes	223	” He hesitated and repeated the name . “
41585	41586	41577	41577	I	0	” “
41602	41621	41622	41625	A novelist I knew	744	” Kreisler suggested when he had made up his bill . On the way Lowndes continued a discourse . “
41679	41688	41674	41675	a man	2077	” Kreisler forged ahead , rhythmically and sullenly . “
41708	41714	41715	41715	I	0	” Lowndes wondered in German . “
41717	41721	41723	41723	you	0	” said Kreisler . “
41725	41922	41723	41723	you	0	” Every minute Kreisler delayed increased the difficulty . His energy was giving out . They were now sitting on the terrasse at the Berne . He had developed a particular antipathy to borrowing . An immense personal neurasthenia had grown up round this habit of his , owing to his late discomfitures . He already heard an awkward voice , saw awkward eyes . Then he suddenly concluded that the fact that Lowndes was not a German made it more difficult , instead of less§ so , as he had thought . Why could he not take ? — why petition ? He knew that if Lowndes refused he would break out ; he nearly did so as it was . With disgust and fatigue he lay back in his chair , paying no attention to what Lowndes was saying . His mind was made up . He would not proceed with his designs on this dirty pocket . He became rough and monosyllabic . He wished to purify himself in rudeness of his preceding amiability . Lowndes had been looking at a newspaper . He put it down and said he must go back to “
41925	41927	41723	41723	you	0	” His “
41929	42443	42561	42561	You	228	” had , of course , been interrupted by Tarr ! Kreisler still saw the expression on the Englishman ’s face he had imagined , and restrained with difficulty the desire to spit in it . The nearness they had been to this demand must have affected , he thought , even his impervious companion . He had asked and been refused , to all intents and purposes . He got up , left Lowndes standing there , and went into the lavatory at the side of the cafe , where he had a thorough wash in cold water . Back at his table , he saw no sign of the Englishman , and sat down to finish his drink , considering what his next move should be . Various pursuits suggested themselves . He might go and offer himself as model at some big private studios near the Observatoire . He could get a week ’s money advanced him ? He would dress as a woman and waylay somebody or other on the boulevards . He might steal some money . Volker was the last . He came just after murder . He would go to Ernst Volker — he with his little obstinate resolve in obscurity of his mind no longer to be Kreisler ’s acquaintance . Obstinacy in people of weak character is the perfectly exasperating thing . They have no right to their resoluteness — appearing weaker and meaner than ever in anomalous tenacity . Volker , naturally submissive , had broken away and was posing somewhere as a stranger . He .felt physical disgust ; this proceeding was indecent . A spirit that has mingled with another , suddenly covering itself and wishing to regain its strangeness , can be as indecent as a strange being suddenly baring itself . A man ’s being is never divined so completely and pungently as when his friendship cools and he becomes once more a stranger . This is one of the moments when the imagination , most awake , sees best . This little rat ’s instinctive haste to separate from him was an ill omen : what did he care for omens ? he clamoured impatiently . At this juncture in his reflections , from where he sat on the café terrace he saw Volker ’s back , as he supposed , disappearing round a corner , as though trying to avoid a meeting . Blood came to his head with a shock . He nearly sprang forward in pursuit of this unsociable form . Rushing words of insult rose to his lips , he fidgeted on his seat , gazed blankly at the spot where he had seen the figure . That it was no longer there exasperated him beyond measure . It was as though he considered that Ernst should have remained at the corner , immobile , with his back towards him , a visible mark and fuel for anger . He made a sign to the waiter , indicating that his drink would go into his “
42446	42553	42561	42561	You	228	” He then hurried off in the direction of Volker ’s house — the direction also that the back had taken — determined to get something out of him . Kreisler , letting instinct guide his steps , took the wrong turning — following , in fact , his customary morning ’s itinerary . He found himself suddenly far beyond the street Volker lived in , near Juan Soler ’s atelier . He gazed down the street towards the atelier , then took off his glasses and began carefully wiping them . While doing this he heard words of greeting and found Volker at his elbow . “
42573	42645	42561	42561	You	228	” he was saying . Kreisler jumped — as the bravest might if , having stoutly confronted an apparition , it suddenly became a man of flesh and blood . Had his glasses been firmly planted on his nose things might have gone differently . He frowned vacantly at Ernst and went on rubbing them . Volker saw that something was wrong . It would have been to his advantage also to “
42648	42682	42561	42561	You	228	” anything that was there and have done with it . But in his attitude German sluggishness seemed appealing to the same element in Kreisler ’s nature , claiming its support and sympathy . “
42688	42774	42775	42775	I	0	” he said uneasily , looking round as though examining the heat . He stepped up on to the pavement out of the way of a horse - meat cart . The large - panelled conveyance , full of enormous outlandish red carcases , went rushing down the street , carrying an area of twenty yards of deafness with it . This explosion of sound had a pacifying effect on Kreisler ; it made him smile for some reason or other . Volker went on : “
42787	42788	42780	42780	I	0	” “
42792	42797	42780	42780	I	0	” Kreisler asked rudely . “
42832	42839	42827	42827	you	0	” There was a forbidding pause . “
42866	42941	42859	42859	you	0	” He spoke rapidly and confidentially , as two business men meeting in the street and always in a hurry might try and compress into a few minutes , between two handshakes , a lot of personal news . He seemed to wish to combine conviction that he was very anxious to tell Kreisler all about himself and ( by his hurried air ) paralysis of the other ’s intention to have an explanation . “
42970	43031	42954	42954	I	0	” Kreisler turned and walked towards the Atelier Juan Soler . For no reason ( except that it was impossible ) he could not get money from Volker . It was as though that money would not be real money at all . Supposing he got it ; the first place he tried to pass it the man would say , “
43037	43580	42954	42954	I	0	” As for taking him to task , his red , correct face made it impossible ; it had suddenly become a lesson and exercise that it would be ridiculous to repeat . He was not a schoolboy . Volker walked away ruffled . He was mortified that , by apprehension of a scene , he had been so friendly . The old Otto had scored . He , Volker , had humiliated himself needlessly , for it was evident Kreisler ’s manner had been misinterpreted by him . Kreisler had not intended going to Soler ’s that day . Yet there he was , presumably got there now to avoid Ernst Volker . He saw himself starting up from the Berne a quarter of an hour before , steaming away in pursuit of a skulking friend — impetus of angry thought carrying him far beyond his destination ; then Volker comes along and runs him into the painting school . He compared himself to one of those little steam toys that go straight ahead without stopping ; that any one can take up and send puffing away in the opposite direction . Humouring this fancy , he entered the studio with the gaze a man might wear who had fallen through a ceiling and found himself in a strange room in midst of a family circle . The irresponsible , resigned , and listless air signified whimsical expectancy . Some other figure would rise up , no doubt , and turn him streetwards again ? A member of the race which has learnt to sleep standing up posed on the throne . He had suddenly come amongst brothers . He was as torpid as she , as indifferent as these mechanical students . The clock struck . With a glance at the massier , the model slowly and rhythmically abandoned her rigid attitude , coming to life as living statues do in ballets ; reached stiffly for her chemise . The dozen other figures , who had been slowly pulsing — advancing or retreating , suspended around her yellowness — now laboriously moved , relapsing aimlessly here and there , chiefly against walls . He had been considering a fat back and especially a parting carried half - way down the back of the head . Why should not its owner , and gardener , he had reflected , continue it the whole distance down , dividing his head in half with a line of white scalp ? This man now turned on him sudden , unsurprised , placid eyes . Had he eyes , as well as a parting , at the back of his head ? Kreisler felt on the verge of courteous discussion as to whether that parting should or should not be gone on with till it reached the neck . Three had struck . He left and returned to the neighbourhood of the Berne by the same and longest route , as though to efface in some way his previous foolish journey . Every three or four hours vague hope recurred of the delayed letter , like hunger recurring at the hour of meals . He went up to the loge of his house and knocked . “
43588	43855	43856	43857	The garçon	2208	” Four hours remained . The German party was to meet at Fraulein Lipmann ’s after dinner . Otto ’s compatriots at the Berne were sober and thoughtful , with discipline in their idleness . Their monthly moneys flowed and ebbed , it was to be supposed , small regular tides frothing monotonously in form of beer . This rather desolate place of chatter , papers , and airy , speculative business had the charm of absence of gusto . Kreisler was ingrainedly antiquated , purer German . He had experienced suddenly home - sickness , that often overtakes voluntary exiles at the turn of their life — his being , not for Germany , exactly , but for the romantic , stiff ideals of the German student of his generation . It was a home - sickness for his early self . Like knack of riding a bicycle or anything learnt in youth , this character was easily assumed . He was gradually discovering the foundations of his personality . Many previous moods and phases of his ' nature were mounting to the surface . Arrived in front of the Cafe Berne , he stood for fifteen minutes looking up and down the street , at the pavement , his watch , the passers - by . Then he chose the billiard - room door to avoid the principal one , where he usually entered . All the ugly familiarity of this place , he hated with methodic , deliberate hatred ; taking things one by one , as it were , persons and objects . "
44221	44226	44227	44227	he	190	“ Was wünschen Sie ? ”

44756	44776	44750	44750	It	784	“ I ’ve lost the access to Ernst ’s pocket . The pig - dog Soltyk is sitting there ! ”

And , by God , it does fit in ! Himmel ! Himmel ! there ’s nothing to be done ! Anything I did , every movement , would only be filling out the figure my ass - tricks have cut for her ! ”
45918	45941	45949	45949	He	191	“ As soon as you can give me your attention ? — Well , what are you going to do with me ? ”

47008	47021	47024	47025	some one	619	“ Ah , Herr Kreisler ! I wonder where Fraulein Vasek is ? ”
47121	47214	47215	47219	This cunning , partly affected	864	“ A thousand pardons , Fraulein Lipmann , for presenting myself like this . Volker and I have been at Fontenay - aux - Roses all the afternoon . We made a mistake about the time of the trains and I have only just got back ; I had n’t time to change . I suppose it does n’t matter ? It will be quite intime and bohemian , wo n’t it ? Volker had something to do . He ’s coming on to the dance later if he can manage it . ”
47310	47366	47300	47301	Fraulein Lipmann	209	“ I am glad Herr Volker ’s coming . I have n’t seen him for some weeks . You ’ve plenty of time to change , you know , if you like . Herr Ekhart and several others have n’t turned up yet . You live quite near , do n’t you , Herr Kreisler ? ”
47367	47415	47416	47416	He	190	“ Yes , third to the right and second to the left , and keep straight on ! But I do n’t think I ’ll trouble about it . I will do like this . I think I ’ll do , do n’t you , Fraulein Lipmann ? ”
47431	47440	47416	47416	He	190	“ You are the best judge of that . ”
47441	47470	47472	47472	Kreisler	190	“ Yes , that is so , is n’t it , Fraulein ? I have often thought that . How curious the same notion should come to you ! ”

51215	51222	51223	51223	Kreisler	190	“ She was taken suddenly ill . ”

52302	52322	52323	52323	She	866	“ I ’m going to introduce you , Herr Kreisler , to a friend of mine — Mrs. Bevelage . ”
52477	52484	52485	52485	he	190	“ Get thee to a nunnery ! ”
52489	52495	52485	52485	he	190	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
52496	52507	52508	52509	Mrs. Bevelage	244	“ Yes . You have omitted ‘ my lord . ’ ”
52523	52532	52516	52516	he	190	“ Do you know that stingy but magnificent edifice “
52534	52548	52549	52549	I	0	“ That handsome home of precarious ‘ fracs ’ in the Rue de Rennes “
52558	52576	52552	52552	I	0	” The widow had not got used to his composite tongue . She liked Kreisler , however . “
52581	52914	52915	52915	He	1026	” he said , getting up quickly . He clasped her firmly in the small of the back and they got ponderously in motion , he stamping a little bit , as though he mistook the waltz for a more primitive music . He took her twice , with ever - increasing velocity , round the large hall , and at the third round , at breakneck speed , spun with her in the direction of the front door . The impetus was so great that she , although seeing her peril , could not act sufficiently as a break on her impetuous companion to avert the disaster . Another moment and they would have been in the street , amongst the traffic , a disturbing meteor , whizzing out of sight , had they not met the alarmed resistance of a considerable English family entering the front door as Kreisler bore down upon it . It was one of those large , featureless , human groups built up by a frigid and melancholy pair , uncannily fecund , during interminable years of blankness . They received this violent couple in their midst . The rush took Kreisler and his partner half - way through , and there they stood embedded and unconscious for many seconds . The English family then , with great dignity , disgorged them and moved on . The widow had come somewhat under the fascination of Kreisler ’s mood . She was really his woman , had he known it . She felt wrapt in the midst of a simoon — she had not two connected thoughts . All her worldliness and measured management of her fat had vanished . Her face had become coarsened in a few minutes . But she buzzed back again into the dance and began a second , mad , but this time merely circular career . Kreisler was very careful , whatever he did , to find a reason for it . “
52938	53135	52922	52922	he	1026	” His burden , not in the best condition , was becoming more and more puffed , and heavier every moment . When satisfied with this part of his work he led Mrs. Bevelage into a sort of improvised conservatory and talked about pawnshops for ten minutes or so — in a mixture of French , English , and German . He then reconducted her , more dead than alive , to her seat , and strode off from her with great sweeps of his tall figure . He had during this incident regained complete impassivity . He stalked away to the conservatory . Bertha had soon been called on to dance vigorously . without much intermission . In the convolutions of the valse , however , she matured a bold and new plan . She whirled and trotted with a preoccupied air . Would Tarr hear of all this ? She was alarmed , now it was done . Also she was cowed and sorry for her action at the thought of Lipmann and Van Bencke ’s attitude towards the Kreisler kissing . She undoubtedly must secure herself . The plan she hit on offered a “
53137	53161	52922	52922	he	1026	” rôle that she could not , in any circumstances , have resisted . Her scheme was plain and clever . She would simply “
53166	53167	53168	53168	She	1028	” “
53226	53289	53223	53223	he	190	” So she jogged out her strategies in exhilaration of the waltzes . At this point of her story she would hint , by ambiguous hesitation , that she , in truth , had been ready even for this sacrifice : had made it , if her hearers wished ! She would imply rather that from modesty — not wanting to appear too “
53291	53347	53223	53223	he	190	” — she refrained from telling them . It is true that for such a confession she had many precedents . Only a week ago Fraulein Van Bencke herself , inflating proudly her stout handsome person , had told them that while in Berlin she had allowed a young painter to kiss her : she believed “
53367	53451	53452	53453	Poor mensch	1031	” But this had not been , it was to be supposed , in the middle of the street . No one had ever seen , or ever would see , the young painter in question , or the kiss . Busy with these plans , Bertha had not much time to notice Kreisler ’s further deportment . She came across him occasionally , and keyed her solid face into an intimate flush and such mask as results from any sickly physical straining . “
53455	53627	53452	53453	Poor mensch	1031	” Soltyk surprised one Anglo - Saxon partner after another with his wonderful English — unnecessarily like the real thing . He went about surprising people in a cold , tireless way , exhibiting no signs of pleasure , except as much as was testified to by his action , merely . Kreisler saw him with Anastasya only twice . On those occasions he could not , on the strength of Soltyk ’s attitude , pin him down as a rival . Yet he was thirsting for conventional figures . His endless dissatisfaction and depression could only be satisfied by active things , unlike itself . Soltyk ’s self - possessed and masterly signs of distinguished camaraderie depressed Kreisler very much . The Russian had been there once at the critical moment , and was , more distantly , an attribute of Volker . He did not like him . How it would satisfy him to dig his fingers into that flesh , and tear it like thick cloth ! He was “
53630	53855	53452	53453	Poor mensch	1031	” ; he was going out . He was being helped off by things . Why did he not shout ? He longed to act : the rusty machine had a thirst for action . His energies were repudiating their master . Soltyk ’s analogies with Kreisler worked in the dark to some end of mutual destruction . The nuance of possibility Soltyk liked his friendships with women to have , was a different affair to Kreisler ’s heady and thorough - going intrigues . But he liked his soul to be marked with little delicate wounds and wistfulnesses . He liked an understanding , a little melancholy , with a woman . They would just divine in each other possibilities of passion , that was yet too lasse and sad to rise to the winding of Love ’s horns that were heard , nevertheless , in a décor Versaillesque and Polonais . They were people who looked forward as others look back . They would say farewell to the future as most men gaze at the past . At the most they played the slight dawning and disappearing of passion , cutting , fastidiously , all the rest of the piece . So he was often found with women . Life had no lethargic intervals as with Kreisler . It at all times needed “
53857	54139	53452	53453	Poor mensch	1031	” of such sort . For Anastasya , Soltyk was one of her many impresarios , who helped her on to and off the scene of Life . He bored her usually , but they had something equivalent to pleasant business relations . She appreciated him as an Impresario . These things arraying themselves in reality after this ordinary unexciting fashion , conventional figures of drama lacked . Kreisler was in the wrong company . But he conformed for the sake of the Invisible Audience haunting life . He emulated the matter - of - factness and aplomb that impressed him in the others à outrance . So much was this so that the Audience took some time to notice him , the vein of scandal running through the performance . In the conservatory he established his headquarters . From there he issued forth on various errands . All his errands showed the gusto of the logic of his personality , and not despair . He might have been enjoying himself . He invented outrage that was natural to him , and enjoyed slightly the licence and scope of his indifference . He , for instance , at the first sortie , noticed a rather congested , hot , and spectacled young woman , rather constantly fluttered over her womanhood , but overworked by her conscience , her features set by duty . He succeeded in getting her for a partner , and soon won her confidence by his scrupulous German politeness . He then , while marking time in a crush , disengaged his hand , and appeared to wish to alter the he of her bosom , very apologetically . “
54184	54454	54460	54460	Widow	245	” The young lady , very red , and snorting almost in his face , left him brusquely . Several young women , and notably a flapper , radiant with heavy inexperience and loaded with bristling bronze curls , he lured into the conservatory . They all came out with scarlet faces . For the first hour he paid no attention to Anastasya , but prosecuted his antics as though he had forgotten ah about her . He knew she was there and left her alone , even in thought , in a grim spirit . He hid coquettishly behind his solemn laughter - in - action , the pleasant veil of his hysteria . He had become generally noticed in the room , although there were a great many people present . Fraulein Lipmann hesitated . She thought at length that he was mad . In speaking to him and getting him removed , she feared a scandalous scene . As he appeared on the threshold of the conservatory an expectant or anxious tremor invaded several backs . But he just stalked round this time on a tour of inspection , as though to see that all was going along as it should . He stared heavily and significantly at those young ladies who had been his partners , when he came across them . One he stopped in front of and gazed at severely . He then returned to the conservatory . In his deck chair , his head stretched back , glasses horizontal and facing the ceiling , he considered the graceless Hamlet that he was . “
54462	54556	54460	54460	Widow	245	” He should have been saying that to his Ophelia . Why did he not go to her ? Contact was the essential thing , but so difficult to bring about . He must make her angry , insult her : that would bare her soul . Then he would spit on it . Then he really could insult her . But Soltyk offered a conventional target for violence . Soltyk was evading him with his contempt . Soltyk ! What should be done with him ? Why ( a prolonged and stormily rising “
54558	55084	55394	55394	you	1035	” ) , there was no difficulty about that . He got up from his chair , and walked deliberately and quickly into the central room . But Soltyk was nowhere to be seen . The dancers were circling rapidly past with athletic elation , talking in the way people talk when they are working . Their intelligences floated and flew above the waves of the valse , but with frequent drenchings , as it were , and cessations . The natural strangeness for him of all these English people together did not arrest his mind or lead him to observation , but yet got a little in the way . Couple followed couple , the noise of their feet , or dress , for a moment queerly distinct and near above the rest , as though a yard or two of quiet surrounded Kreisler . They came into this area for a moment , everything distinct and clear cut , and then went out again . Each new pair of dancers seemed coming straight for him . Their voices were loud for a moment . A hole was cut out of the general noise , as it were opening a passage into it . Each new face was a hallucination of separate energy , seeming very distant , laughs , words , movements . They were like trunk - less , living heads rolling and bobbing past , a sea of them . The two or three instruments behind the screen of palms produced the necessary measures to keep this throng of people careering , like a spoon stirring in a saucepan . It stirred and stirred and they jerked and huddled insipidly round and round . Kreisler was drawn up at the first door for a minute . He was just taking a step forward to work his way round to the next , when he caught sight of Anastasya dancing with ( he supposed ) some Englishman . He stopped , paralysed by her appearance . This reality intercepted the course of his imaginary life ( of which his pursuit of Soltyk was a portion ) . He stood like somebody surprised in a questionable act . He had not reckoned on being met by her before his present errand was finished . The next moment he was furious at this interference ; at her having the power to draw him up . This imaginary life should grow . Hell and Heaven ! he was not going to stop there looking at her . She and her partner had drawn up for a moment just in his way , being stopped by other couples marking time . She had not seen him . He took her partner roughly by the arm , pushing him against her , hustling him , fixing him with his eye . He passed beyond them then , through the passage he had made . His blood was flooding him , and making him expand and sink like a Russian dancer . The young man handled in this manner , shy and unprompt , stared after Kreisler with a “
55089	55276	55394	55394	you	1035	” People are seldom so rude in England . Preparation for outbursts of potential rudeness form a part of the training of a German . Kreisler also , without apology , but as if waiting for more vigorous expostulation , was also looking back , while he stepped slowly along the wall towards a door beyond , the one leading to the refreshment - room . Anastasya freed herself at once from her partner and pale and frowning ( but as though waiting ) was looking after Kreisler curiously . She would have liked him to stop . He had done something strange and was as suddenly going away . That was unsatisfactory . They looked at each other blankly . He showed no sign of stopping : she just stared . Suddenly it was comic . She burst out laughing . But they had clashed , like people in the dance , and were both disappearing from each other again , the shock hardly over . The contact had been brought about . He was still as surprised at his action , which had been done “
55281	55348	55394	55394	you	1035	” as she was . Anastasya felt , too , in what way this had been contact . She felt his hand on her arm as though it had been she he had seized . This rough figure disappeared in the doorway , as incapable of explaining anything . She shivered nervously as she grasped her partner ’s arm again , at this merely physical contact . “
55357	55385	55354	55355	that chap	1034	” her partner asked , conscious of a lameness , but of something queer going on . This question had been asked a few minutes before elsewhere . “
55401	55426	55394	55394	you	1035	” Fraulein Lipmann had asked Eckhart . Eckhart was a little drunk himself . He took a very decided view of Kreisler ’s case . “
55440	55471	55475	55475	he	190	” he affirmed . But he only gave it as an opinion , adding no sign of particular indignation . He was beaming with greedy generosity at his great Amoureuse . “
55479	55926	55475	55475	he	190	” said Fraulein Lipmann at the door . ( It was when Kreisler had started up in search of Soltyk ) . So Kreisler disappeared in the doorway . He passed through the refreshment - room . In a small room beyond he sat down by an open window . Anastasya had at last got into fine with him . She had been startled , awakened , and had also laughed . This was an exact and complete response to Kreisler at the present . Something difficult to understand and which should have been alarming for a woman , the feel of the first tugs of the maelstrom he was producing and conducting all on his own , and which required her for its heart : and then laughter , necessarily , once one was in that atmosphere , like laughing gas , with its gusty tickling . But this was not how Kreisler felt about it . He was boiling and raging . That laugh had driven him foaming , fugitive and confused , into the nearest chair . He could not turn round and retaliate at the time . The door being in front of him , he vanished as Mephistopheles might sink with suddenness into the floor , at the receipt of some affront , to some sulphurous regions beneath , in a second ; come to a stop alone , upright ; stick his fingers in his mouth , nearly biting them in two , his eyes staring : so stand stock still , breathless and haggard for some minutes : then shoot up again , head foremost , in some other direction , like some darting and skulking fish , to the face of the earth . He did not even realize that the famous contact was established , so furious was he . He would go and strike her across the mouth , spit in her face , kiss her in the middle of the dance , where the laugh had been ! Yet he did n’t move , but sat on staring in front of him , quite forgetful where he was and how long he had sat there , in the midst of a hot riot of thoughts . He suddenly sat up and looked round , like a man who has been asleep and for whom work is waiting ; got up with certain hesitation , and again made for the door . Well , life and work ( Ms business ) must be proceeded with all the same . He glanced reflectively and solemnly about , and perceived the Widow talking to a little reddish Englishman . “
55937	55948	55949	55949	Widow	245	” he asked her companion . He always addressed her as “
55950	55960	56083	56084	Merry Widow	245	” : he began all his discourses with a solemn “
55963	55968	56083	56084	Merry Widow	245	” occasionally alternating it with “
55971	56030	56083	56084	Merry Widow	245	” But this , all uttered in a jumbled tongue , lost some of its significance . The little Englishman on being addressed gave the English equivalent of a jump — a sudden moving of his body and shuffling of his feet , still looking at the floor , where he had cast his eyes as Kreisler approached . “
56034	56035	56036	56036	Widow	245	” “
56040	56062	55949	55949	Widow	245	” said Kreisler . Manipulating her with a leisurely gusto , he circled into the dance . The band was playing the “
56065	56068	56069	56070	Merry Widow	245	” valse . “
56072	56080	56083	56084	Merry Widow	245	” he said smilingly to his partner . “
56086	56400	56083	56084	Merry Widow	245	” shaking his head at her . The music seemed fumbling in a confused mass of memory , but finding nothing definite . All it managed to bring to fight was a small cheap photograph , taken at a Bauern Bal , with a flat German student ’s cap . The man remained just his photograph . Their hostess also was dancing . Kreisler noted her with a wink of recognition . Dancing very slowly , almost mournfully , he and his partner bumped into her each time as they passed . The Widow felt the impact , but it was only at the third round that she perceived the method and intention inducing these bumps . She realized they were going to collide with the other lady . The collision could not be avoided . But she shrank away , made herself as small and soft as possible , bumped gently and apologized over her shoulder , with a smile and screwing up of the eyes , full of meaning . At the fourth turn of the room , however , Kreisler having increased her speed sensibly , she was on her guard , and in fact already suggesting that she should be taken back to her seat . He pretended to be giving their hostess a wide berth this time , but suddenly and gently swerved , and bore down upon her . The Widow veered frantically , took a false step , tripped on her dress , tearing it , and fell to the ground . They caused a circular undulating commotion throughout the neighbouring dancers like a stone falling in a pond . Several people bent , down to help Mrs. Bevelage — Kreisler ’s assistance was angrily rejected . His partner scrambled to her feet and went to the nearest chair , followed by one or two people . “
56405	56406	56403	56403	he	1038	” “
56411	56412	56407	56407	He	1038	” “
56416	56417	56418	56418	He	1038	” “
56425	56469	56470	56470	I	0	” people said who had seen the accident . Kreisler regained the conservatory with great dignity . But now Fraulein Lippmann , alone , appeared before him as he lay stretched in his chair , and said in a tight , breaking voice : “
56517	56518	56519	56519	You	190	” “
56527	56542	56525	56525	Fraulein	248	” he asked in an astonished voice . He remained lolling at full length . “
56574	56575	56567	56567	I	0	” “
56582	56583	56577	56577	you	0	” “
56597	56598	56592	56592	We	1039	” “
56601	56638	56592	56592	We	1039	” Hurling hotly this epithet at him — her breath had risen many degrees in temperature at its passage , and her breast heaved in dashing it out ( as though , in fact , the word “
56640	56700	56586	56586	Fraulein	248	” had been the living thing , and she were emptying her breast of it violently ) , she left the room . His last exploit had been accomplished in a half disillusioned state . He merely went on farcing because he could think of nothing else to do . Anastasya ’s laughter had upset and ended everything of his “
56704	56714	56586	56586	Fraulein	248	” He told himself now that he hated her . “
56723	56735	56592	56592	We	1039	” he hissed over to himself , enjoying the wind of the “
56737	56909	56910	56910	I	0	” in his moustaches . But ( there was no doubt about it ) the laugh had crushed him . Ridiculous and hateful had been his goal . But now that he had succeeded he thought chiefly in the latter affair , he was overwhelmed . His vanity was wounded terribly . In laughing at him she had puffed out and transformed in an extraordinary way , also , his infatuation . For the first time since he had first set eyes on her he realized her sex . His sensuality had been directly stirred . He wanted to kiss her now . He must get his mouth on hers — he must revel in the laugh , where it grew ! She was néfaste . She was in fact evidently the devil . So his idée fixe having suddenly taken body and acquired flesh , now allied to his senses , the vibration became more definitely alarming . He began thinking about her with a slow moistening of the lips . “
56915	56975	56910	56910	I	0	” he said to himself , seeing himself in the role of the old Berserker warrior , ravening and irresistible . The use of the word shall in that way was enough . But this infernal dance ! With the advent of the real feeling all the artificial ones flew or diminished at once . He was no longer romantically “
56978	57001	56910	56910	I	0	” but bored with his useless position there . All his attention was now concentrated on a practical issue , that of the “
57003	57075	56592	56592	We	1039	” of Anastasya . He was tired as though he had been dancing the whole evening . He got up and threw his cigarette away ; he even dusted his coat a little with his hand . He then , not being able to get at the white patch on the shoulder , took it off and shook it . A large grey handkerchief was used to flick his boots with . “
57078	58097	56592	56592	We	1039	” he grunted , smartly shooting on his coat . The central room , when he got into it , appeared a different place . People were standing about and waiting for the next tune . It had been completely changed by his novel and material feeling for Anastasya . Everything , for a second time , was quite ordinary , but not electrically ordinary , almost hushed , this time . He had become a practical man , surrounded by facts . But he was much more worried ' and tired than at the beginning of the evening . To get away was his immediate thought . But he felt hungry . He went into the refreshment - room . On the same side as the door , a couple of feet to the right , was a couch . The trestle - bar with the refreshments ran the length of the opposite wall . The room was quiet and almost empty . Out of the tail of his eye , as he entered , he became conscious of something . He turned towards the couch . Soltyk and Anastasya were sitting there , and looking at him with the abrupt embarrassment people show when an absentee under discussion suddenly appears . He flushed and was about to turn back to the door . But he flushed still more next moment , at thought of his hesitation . This humiliating full - stop beneath their eyes must be wiped out , anyhow . He walked on steadily to the bar . A shy consciousness of his physique beset him . He felt again an outcast — of an inferior class , socially . He must not show this . He must be leisurely . He was leisurely . He thought when he stretched his hand out to take his cup of coffee that it would never reach it . Reduced to posing nude for Anastasya and the Russian was the result of the evening ! Scores of little sensations , like troublesome imps , herded airily behind him . They tickled him with impalpable fingers . He munched sandwiches without the faintest sense of their taste . Anastasya ’s eyes were scourging him . He felt like a martyr . Suddenly conscious of an awkwardness in his legs , he changed his position . His arms were ludicrously disabled . The sensation of standing neck deep in horrid filth beset him . Compelled to remain in soaking wet clothes and unable to change them , his body gradually drying them , would have been a similar discomfort . The noise of the dancing began again , filled the room . This purified things somewhat . He got red in the face as though with a gigantic effort , but went on staring in front of him . His anger kept rising . He stood there deliberately longer ; in fact on and on , almost in the same position . She should wait his pleasure till he liked to turn round , and — then . He allowed her laughter to accumulate on his back , like a coat of mud . In his illogical vision he felt her there behind him laughing and laughing interminably . Had he gone straight up to her , in a moment of passion , both disembodied as it were , anything in the shape of objective observation disappearing , he could have avoided this scrutiny . He had preferred to plank himself there in front of her , inevitably ridiculous , a mark for that laugh of hers . Soltyk was sharing it . More and more his laughter became intolerable . The traditional solution again suggested itself . Laugh ! Laugh ! He would stand there letting the debt grow , letting them gorge themselves on his back . The attendant behind the bar began observing him with severe curiosity . He had stood in almost the same position for five minutes and kept staring darkly past her , very red in the face . Then suddenly a laugh burst out behind him — a blow , full of insult , in his ears — and he nearly jumped off the ground . After his long immobility the jump was of the last drollery . His fists clenched , his face emptied of every drop of colour , in the mere action he had almost knocked a man , standing beside him , over . The laugh , for him , had risen with tropic suddenness , a simoom of intolerable offence . It had carried him off his legs , or whirled him round rather , in a second . A young English girl , already terrified at Kreisler ’s appearance , and a man , almost as much so , stood open - mouthed in front of him . As to Anastasya and Soltyk , they had very completely disappeared , long before , in all probability . To find that he had been struggling and perspiring in the grasp of a shadow was a fresh offence , merely , for the count of the absentees . Obviously , shadow or not , there or not there , it was they . He felt this a little ; but they had disappeared into the Ewigkeit for the moment . He had been again beating the air . This should have been a climax , of blows , words , definite things . But things remained vague . The turmoil of the evening remained his , the solid part of it , unshared by anybody else . He smiled , rather hideously and menacingly , at the two English people near him , and walked away . He was not going in search of Anastasya . They would be met somewhere or other , no doubt . All he wanted now was to get away from the English club as soon as possible . While he was making towards the vestibule he was confronted again with Fraulein Lipmann . “
58108	58114	56592	56592	We	1039	” he heard her say . “
58120	58128	58129	58130	Besotted fool	1042	” he answered without hesitation or softness . “
58143	58171	56592	56592	We	1039	” Turning on her like lightning , with exasperation perfectly meeting hers , his right hand threatening , quickly raised towards his left shoulder , he shouted : “
58180	58258	56592	56592	We	1039	” The hissing , thunderous explosion was the last thing in vocal virulence . The muscles all seemed gathered up at his ears like reins , and the flesh tightened and white round his mouth . Fraulein Lipmann took several steps back . Kreisler with equal quickness turned away , rapped on the counter , while the attendant looked for his hat , and left the Club . Fraulein Lippmann was left with the heavy , unforgettable word “
58260	58452	56592	56592	We	1039	” deposited in her boiling spirit , that , boil as it might , would hardly reduce this word to tenderness or digestibility . A JEST TOO DEEP FOR LAUGHTER With a little scratching ( as the concierge pushed it ) with the malignity of a little , quiet , sleek animal , the letter from Germany crept under the door the next morning , and lay there through the silence of the next hour or two , until Kreisler woke . Succeeding to his first brutal farewells to his dreams , no hopes leapt on his body , a magnificent stallion ’s , uselessly refreshed . Soon he saw the letter . It lay there quiet , unimportant , rather matter of fact and sly . Kreisler felt it an indignity to have to open it . Until his dressing was finished , it remained where it was . He might have been making some one wait . Then he took it up , and opening it , drew out between his forefinger and thumb , the cheque . This he deposited with as much contempt as possible , and a “
58454	58602	56592	56592	We	1039	” on the edge of his washhand stand . Then he turned to the letter . He read the first few fines , pumping at a cigarette , reducing it mathematically to ash . Cold fury entered his mind with a bound at the first words . They were the final words giving notice of a positive stoppage of supplies . This month ’s money was sent to enable him to settle up his affairs and come to Germany at once . He read the first three lines over and over again , going no further , although the news begun in these first lines was developed throughout the two pages of the letter . Then he put it down beside the cheque , and crushing it under his fist , said monotonously to himself , without much more feeling than the sound of the word contained : “
58609	58686	56592	56592	We	1039	” He got up , and pressed his hand on his forehead ; it was wet : he put his hands in his pockets and these came into contact with a cinquante centime piece . He took them out again slowly , went to his box and underneath an old dressing - gown found writing paper and envelopes . Then , referring to his father ’s letter for the date , he wrote the following lines : “
58691	58758	58759	58760	Otto Kreisler	190	“ Sir , — I shall not return as you suggest in person , but my body will no doubt be sent to you about the middle of next month . If — keeping to your decision — no money is sent , it being impossible to five without money , I shall on the seventh of July , this day next month , shoot myself . “
58762	59076	58759	58760	Otto Kreisler	190	” Within half an hour this was posted . Then he went and had breakfast with more tranquillity and relish than he had known for some days . He sat up stiffly like a dilapidated but apparently in some way satisfied rooster at his café table . This life was now settled , pressure ceased . He had come to a conventional and respectable decision . His conduct the night before , for instance , had not been at all respectable . Death — like a monastery — was before him , with equivalents of a slight shaving of the head merely , a handful of vows , some desultory farewells , very restricted space , but none the worse for that ; with something like the disagreeableness of a dive for one not used to deep water . But he had got into life , anyhow , by mistake ; il s’était trompé de porte . His life might almost have been regarded as a long and careful preparation for voluntary death . The nightmare of Death , as it haunted the imaginations of the Egyptians , had here been conjured in another way . Death was not to be overcome with embalmings and Pyramids , or fought within the souls of children . It was confronted as some other more uncompromising race ( and yet also haunted by this terrible idea ) might have been . Instead of rearing smooth faces of immense stone against it , you imagine an unparalleled immobility in life , a race of statues , throwing flesh in Death ’s path instead of basalt . Kreisler would have undoubtedly been a high priest among this people . In a large fluid but nervous handwriting , the following letter lay , read , as it were : Bertha still keeping her eye on it from a distance : “
59217	59562	59563	59563	SORBETT	251	“ Before , I had contemplated retiring to a little distance for the purpose of reflection . This last coup of yours necessitates a much further recul , withdrawal — a couple of hundred miles at least , I have judged . And as far as I can see I shall be some months — say ten — away . I am not wise enough to take your action au pied de la lettre- , nevertheless , you may consider yourself free as women go . What I mean is you need not trouble to restrain the exuberance of your exploits in future . ( What rubbish ! ) Let them develop naturally , right up to fiançailles , or elsewhere . I have a very German idea . Why should not girls have two or three fiancés ? Not two or three husbands . But fiancé , especially nowadays , is an elastic term . Why should n’t fiancé take the place of husband ? It is a very respectable word : a very respectable state . But my idea was that of a club , organized around the fiancée . You seem to me cut out for such a club . A man might spend quite a pleasant time with the other fiancés . A fine science of women would be developed , perhaps along Oriental lines a little . Then a man would remember the different clubs he had belonged to . Some very beautiful women might have a sort of University settled near them . To have belonged to one of these celebrated but ephemeral institutions would insure a man success with less illustrious queens . ‘ He was a fiancé of Fraulein Stuck ’s , you know , ’ would carry prestige . You have Germanized me in a horrible way ! Anyhow , you may count on me should you think of starting a little institution of that sort . My address for the next few months will be 10 Waterford Street , London , W.C. — Yours , “
59565	59734	59563	59563	SORBETT	251	” He spelt his name with two T ’s because Bertha had never disciplined herself to suppress final consonants . Bertha was in her little kitchen . It was near the front door . Next to it was her studio or salon , then bedroom : along a passage at right angles the rooms rented by Clara Goenthner , her friend . The letter had been laid on the table , by the side of which stood the large gas - stove , like a safe , its gas stars , on top , blasting away luridly at pans and saucepans with Bertha ’s breakfast . While busying herself with eggs and coffee , she gazed over her arm reflectively at the letter . It was a couple of inches too far away for her to be able to read it . The postman had come ten minutes before . It was now four days after the dance , and since she had last seen Tarr . She had “
59736	59761	59763	59763	he	1047	” he would come on that particular morning . The belief in woman ’s intuition is not confined , of course , to men . “
59772	60094	59763	59763	he	1047	” she had asked herself . The possibility of this was terrifying . But perhaps it would be as well if he had . It might at any future time crop up . And what things had happened when other older things had come to light suddenly ! She would tell him if he had not already heard . He should hear it from her . The great boulevard sacrifice of the other night had appeared folly , long ago . But peculiarly free from any form of spite — she did not feel unkindly towards Kreisler . So Sorbert was expected to breakfast , on the authority of her intuition . Bread was being fried in fat . What manner of man would appear , how far renseigné — or if not informed , still all their other difficulties were there inevitably enough ? Experience , however , suggested such breakfast as pleased him . Could fried toast and honey play a part in such troubles ? Ah , yes . Troubles often reduced themselves to fried bread and honey : they could sow troubles , why not help to quell troubles ? But she had had a second intuition that he knew . Not knowing how stormy their interview might be she neglected no minute precautions — and these were the touching ones — any more than the sailor would neglect to stow away even the smallest of his sails , I suppose , at the sulky approach of a simoom . The simoom , however , had left her becalmed and taken the train for Dieppe instead of coming in her direction . Bertha went on turning the bread over in the pan , taking the butter from its paper and dropping it into its dish : rinsing and wiping a knife or two , regulating the gas . Frequent truculent exclamations spluttered out if anything went wrong . “
60098	60099	60100	60100	Donnerwetter	254	” “
60102	60140	60100	60100	Donnerwetter	254	” She used the oaths of Goethe . One eyebrow was raised in humorous reflective irritation . She would flatten the letter out and bend down to examine a sentence , stopping her cooking for a moment . “
60143	60171	60100	60100	Donnerwetter	254	” she exclaimed , after having read the letter all through again , putting it down . She turned with coquettish contemptuousness to her frying - pan . “
60173	60260	60517	60517	Soler	220	” was , with her , a favourite epithet . Clara ’s door opened , and Bertha crumpled the letter into her pocket . Clara entered sleepy - eyed and affecting ill - humour . Her fat body was a softly distributed burden , which she carried with the aplomb and indifference of habit . She had a gracefully bumpy forehead , a nice whistling mouth , soft , good and discreet orbs . Her days were passed in the library of the Place Saint Sulpice . “
60275	60393	60272	60272	your	1048	” she exclaimed as Bertha began her customary sociable and playful greeting . Bertha always was conscious of her noise , of shallowness and worldliness , with this shrewd , indifferent , slow , and monosyllabic bookworm . She wanted to caper round it , inviting it to cumbrous play , like a small lively dog around a heavy one . She was much more femme as she said , but aware that Clara did not regard this as an attainment . Being femme had taken up so much of her energy and life that she could not expect to be so complete in other ways as Clara . With this other woman , who was much less “
60395	60499	60500	60500	woman	625	” than she , she always felt impelled to ultra - feminine behaviour . She was childish to the top of her bent . This was insulting to the other : it showed too clearly Bertha ’s way of regarding her as not so much femme as herself . Clara felt this and would occasionally show impatience at Bertha ’s skittishness : a gruff manlike impatience entering grimly but imperturbably into the man - part , but claiming at the same time its prerogatives . Clara had had no known love affairs . She regarded Bertha , sometimes , with much curiosity . This “
60504	60514	60500	60500	woman	625	” so complacently displayed , soothed and tickled her . “
60530	60531	60517	60517	Soler	220	” “
60534	60540	60517	60517	Soler	220	” Clara was not impressed by “
60543	60633	60517	60517	Soler	220	” She was preparing her own breakfast and jostled Bertha , usurping more than half the table . Bertha , delighted , retorted with trills of shrill indignation and by recapturing the positions lost by her plates . Her breakfast ready she carried it into her room , pretending to be offended with Clara . Breakfast over she wrote to Tarr . The letter was written quite easily and directly . She was so sure in the convention of her passion that there was no scratching out or hesitation . “
60642	60695	60634	60634	I	0	” There was nothing more to be said ; as it had been said often before , it came easily and promptly with the pen . All the feeling that could find expression was fluent , large and assured , like the handwriting , and went at once into these conventional forms . “
60865	61430	60861	60861	women	2149	” This passage , from an article in the English Review , Tarr had shown to Bertha with great pleasure Bertha had a good share of impoverished and overworked temperament , but in a very genial fashion . It had not , with her , grown crooked and vicious with this constant ill - treatment . It was strenuous but friendly . It served in any case a mistress surprisingly disinterested and gentle . On the receipt of Tarr ’s letter she had felt , to begin with , very indignant and depressed at his having had the strength to go away without coming to see her . So her letter began on that complaint . He had at last , this was certain , gone away , with the first likelihood of permanence since they had known each other . Despite her long preparation for this , and her being even deliberately the cause of it , she was mortified and at the same time unhappy at the sight of her success . The Kreisler business had been more for herself than anything , for her own private edification . She would free Sorbert by an act , in a sort of impalpable way . It was not destined as yet for publicity . The fact of the women surprising Kreisler and her on the boulevard had put everything at once out of perspective , damaged her illusion of sacrifice . Compelled at once to be practical again , find excuses , repudiate immediately what she had done before she had been able to enjoy or digest it , was like a man being snatched away from table , the last mouthful hardly swallowed She was the person surprised before some work doing is completed — it still in a rudimentary unshowable state . For once Tarr was not only in the right , but , to her irritation , he had proofs , splendid ocular proofs , a cloud of witnesses . To end nobly , on her own initiative , had been her idea ; to make a last sacrifice to Sorbert in leaving him irrevocably , as she had sacrificed her feelings all along in allowing their engagement to drag suspiciously on , in making her position slightly uncomfortable with her friends ( and these social things meant so much to her in addition ) . And now , instead , everything had been turned into questionable meanness and ridicule ; when she had intended to behave with the maximum of swagger , she suddenly found herself relegated to a skulking and unfortunate plane . Considerations about Fate beset her . Everything was hopelessly unreliable . The best thing to do was to do nothing . She was not her usual energetic too spiritually bustling self . She wrote her letter quite easily and as usual , but she did not ( very unusually ) believe in its efficacy . She even wrote it a trifle more easily than usual for that reason . It was only a momentary rebellion against the ease with which this protest was done . Perhaps had it not been for the fascination of habit , then some more adequate words would have been written . His letter had come . Empty and futile she had done her task , answered as she must do ; “
61437	61508	61511	61514	that little Darmstadt woman	1063	” she would have thought , with an exclamation mark after it . She sealed up her letter and addressed it . In the drawer where she was putting Sorbert ’s latest letter away were some old ones . A letter of the year before she took out and read . With its two sentences it was more cruel and had more meaning than the one she had just received : “
61521	61743	61744	61744	Mademoiselle	257	” It was a note she had received on the eve of an expedition to a village near Paris . She had promised to take a girl down with them , to show her the place , its hotel and other possibilities — she had stayed there once or twice herself . The Darmstadt girl had not been taken . Sorbert and she had spent the night at an inn on the outskirts of the forest . They had come back in the train next day without speaking , having quarrelled somehow or other in the inn . Chagrin and regret for him struck her a series of sharp blows . She started crying again suddenly , quickly , and vehemently as though surprised by some thought . The whole morning her work worried her , dusting and arranging . She experienced a revolt against her ceaseless orderliness , a very grave thing in such an exemplary prisoner . At four o’clock in the afternoon , as often happened , she was still dawdling about in her dressing - gown and had not yet had lunch . The femme de menage came at about eight in the morning , doing Clara ’s rooms first . Bertha was in the habit of discussing politics with Madame Vannier . Sorbert too was discussed . “
61748	61758	61744	61744	Mademoiselle	257	” this good woman said , noticing her dejection . “
61770	61771	61761	61762	Monsieur Sorbert	270	” “
61779	61786	61773	61773	madame	1064	” Bertha replied , half crying . “
61806	62144	62145	62145	He	1065	” Madame Vannier worked silently with soft quiet thud of felt slippers . She appeared to regard work as not without dignity . Bertha was playing at life . She admired and liked her as an emblem of Fortune ; she respected herself as an emblem of Misfortune . Madame Vannier was given the letter to post at two . Bertha ’s friends looked for her elsewhere , nowadays , than at her rooms . Tarr was always likely to be found there in impolite possession . She made them come as often as she could ; her coquetry as regards her carefully arranged rooms needed satisfaction . She suffered in the midst of her lonely tastefulness . But Tarr had certainly made these rooms a rather deserted place . Since the dance none of her women friends had come . She had spent an hour or two with them at the restaurant . At the dance she had kept rather apart . Dazed , after a shock , and needing self - collection , was the line sketched . Her account of things could not , of course , be blurted out anyhow . It had to grow out of circumstances . It , of course , must be given . She had not yet given it . But haste must be avoided . For its particular type , as long a time as possible must be allowed to elapse before she spoke of what had happened . It must almost seem as though she were going to say nothing ; sudden , perfect , and very impressive silence on her part . To accustom their minds to her silence would make speech all the more imposing , when it came . At a café after the dance her account of the thing flowered grudgingly , drawn forth by the ambient heat of the discussion . They were as yet at the stage of exclamations , no malveillant theory yet having been definitely formed about Kreisler . “
62161	62162	62158	62158	I	0	” “
62175	62200	62170	62171	Fraulein Fogs	259	” ( Kreisler had , on a former occasion , paid his court to a lady of this name , with resounding unsuccess . ) “
62218	62225	62216	62216	him	1065	” said one of the men . “
62239	62317	62228	62228	you	1067	” Fraulein Lipmann had been sitting , her eyes fixed on a tram drawn up near by , watching the people evacuating the central platform , and others restocking it . The discussion and exclamations of her friends did not , it would appear , interest her . It would have been , no doubt , scandalously unnatural if Kreisler had not been execrated . But anything they could say was negligible and inadequate to cope with the “
62322	62384	62228	62228	you	1067	” The tameness of their reflections on and indignation against Kreisler when compared with the terrific corroding of this epithet ( known only to her ) made her sulky and impatient . Applied to in this way directly about the lies , she turned to the others and said , as it were interposing herself regally at last in their discussion : “
62389	62405	62385	62385	Ecoutez	261	” she began , leaning towards the greater number of them , seeming to say , “
62437	62478	62385	62385	Ecoutez	261	” It would seem a great effort to do this , too , her lips a little white with fatigue , her eyes heavy with disgust at it all : fighting these things , she was coming to their assistance . “
62490	62527	62385	62385	Ecoutez	261	” ; this was an unfortunate beginning for Bertha , as thoughts , if not eyes , would spring in her direction no doubt , and Fraulein Lipmann even paused as though about to qualify this : “
62568	62580	62581	62581	I	0	” Fraulein Lipmann shrugged her shoulders with blank , contemptuous indifference . “
62629	62636	62625	62627	an offensive brute	1076	” She eyed them a moment . “
62641	62642	62625	62627	an offensive brute	1076	” “
62657	62690	62643	62643	We	1069	” said one of them . This was in the spirit of Fraulein Lipmann ’s words , but was not accepted by her just then as she had something further to say . “
62737	62764	62731	62731	he	1070	” Ekhart was getting very red , his eyes were shining , and he was moving rhythmically in his chair something like a steadily rising sea . “
62773	62777	62778	62778	Nein	262	” he asked . “
62795	62797	62800	62800	Ekhart	233	” The “
62801	62831	62800	62800	Ekhart	233	” had been drawled fondly at once , as though that contingency had been weighed , and could be brushed aside lightly in advance . It implied as well an “
62834	62842	62843	62843	I	0	” for his red and dutiful face . “
62870	63217	63222	63222	Kreisler	190	” So Bertha ’s story had come uncomfortably and difficultly to flower . She wished she had not waited so long . But it was impossible now , the matter put in the light that Fraulein Lipmann ’s intervention had caused , to delay any longer . She was , there was no doubt about it , vaguely responsible for Kreisler . It was obviously her duty to explain him . And now Fraulein Lipmann had just put an embargo on explanations . There were to be no more explanations . In Kreisleriana her apport was very important : much more definite than the indignation or hypothesis of any of the rest . She . had been nearer to him , anyway . She had waited too long , until the sea had risen too high , or rather in a direction extremely unfavourable for launching her contribution . It must be in some way , too , a defence of Kreisler . This would be a very delicate matter to handle . Yet could she sit on there , say nothing , and let the others in the course of time drop the subject 1 They had not turned to her in any way for further information or as to one peculiarly susceptible of furnishing interesting data . Maintaining this silence was a solution . But it would be even bolder than her first plan . This would be a still more vigorous , more insolent development of her plan of confessing — in her way . But it rather daunted her . They might easily mistake , if they pleased , her silence for the silence of acknowledged , very eccentric , guilt . The subject was drawing perilously near the point where it would be dropped . Fraulein Lipmann was summing up , and doing the final offices of the law over the condemned and already unspeakable Kreisler . No time was to be lost . The breaking in now involved inevitable conflict of a sort with Fraulein Lipmann . She was going to “
63223	63300	63303	63303	I	0	” after Fraulein Lipmann ’s words . ( How much better it would have been before ! ) So at this point , looking up from the table , Bertha ( listened to with uncomfortable unanimity and promptness ) began . She was smiling with an affectedly hesitating , timid face , smiling in a flat strained way , the neighbourhood of her eyes suffused slightly with blood , her lips purring the words a little : “
63312	63380	63306	63306	I	0	” Her smile was that made with a screwing up of the eyes and slow flowering of the lips , noticed on some people ’s faces when some snobbery they can not help has to be allowed egress from their mouth . Renée Lipmann turned towards her composedly . This interruption would require argument ; consciousness of the peculiar nature of Bertha ’s qualifications was not displayed . “
63522	63546	63547	63547	He	190	” This was said in the sing - song of quick parentheses , eyebrows lifted , and with little gestures of the hand . “
63556	63579	63580	63580	He	190	” She made a quick snatching gesture at Fraulein Lipmann , who did not like this attempt at intimidation or velvety defiance . “
63589	63606	63580	63580	He	190	” turning to one or two of the others . This was said with dramatic suddenness and “
63609	63615	63580	63580	He	190	” as it were : the “
63617	63634	63635	63635	We	1084	” said with a sort of deliberate sententious brutality , and luscious disparting of the lips . “
63643	63649	63651	63651	you	1083	” one of them began . “
63690	63699	63687	63688	a brute	582	” She shuddered , with rather rolling eyes . “
63723	63798	63714	63714	He	190	” They were all silent , answer - less at this unexpected view of the case . It only differed from theirs in supposing that he was not always a brute . She had spoken quickly and drew up short . Their silence became conscious and septic . They appeared as though they had not expected her to stop speaking , and were like people surprised naked , with no time to cover themselves . “
63826	63827	63825	63825	somebody----	1089	” “
63835	63844	63845	63845	I	0	” one of the girls said , hesitating . “
63870	63968	63864	63864	I	0	” Anastasya Vasek was still with them . She had not joined in the talk about Kreisler . She listened to it with attention , like a person newly arrived in some community , participating for the first time at one of their discussions on a local and stock subject . Kreisler would , from her expression , have seemed to be some topic peculiar to this gathering of people — they engaged in a characteristic occupation . Bertha she watched as one would watch a very eloquent chief airing his views at a clan - meeting . “
64043	64054	64055	64055	You	0	” The hungry touch was an invention of the moment . “
64090	64096	64097	64097	He	190	” said Fraulein van Bencke . “
64122	64193	64109	64109	You	0	” Renée Lipmann said . Things languished . The Lipmann had taken her stand on boredom . She was committed to the theory of the unworthiness of this discussion . The others not feeling quite safe , Bertha ’s speeches raised no more comment . It was all as though she had been putting in her little bit of abuse of the common enemy . Bertha might have interrupted with a “
64201	64367	64196	64196	He	190	” — and this have been met with a dreary , acquiescing silence ! She was exculpating herself , then ( heavily ) , at his expense . The air of ungenerosity this had was displeasing to her . The certain lowering of the vitality of the party when she came on the scene with her story offended her . There should have been noise . It was not quite the lifelessness of scepticism . But there was an uncomfortable family likeness to the manner of people listening to discourses they do not believe . She persevered . She met with the same objectionable flaccid and indifferent opposition . Her intervention had killed the topic , and they seemed waiting till she had ended her war - dance on its corpse . The red - headed member of the party had met Tarr by chance . Hearing he had not seen Bertha since the night of the ball , she had said with roguish pleasantness : “
64385	64391	64392	64392	Bertha	177	” Tarr did not understand . “
64425	64792	64417	64417	Bertha	177	” But , on Tarr insisting , Bertha ’s story , in substance , had been told . So with Bertha , the fact was still there . Retrospectively , her friends insisted upon passing by the two remarkably unanimous - looking forms on the boulevard in stony silence . She shouted to them and kissed Kreisler loudly . But they refused to take any notice . She sulked . They had been guilty of catching her . She kept to herself day after day . She would make a change in her life . She might go to Germany ; she might go to another quartier . To go on with her life just as though nothing had happened , that was out of the question . Demonstration of some sort must follow , and change compatible with grief . Her burly little clock struck four . Hurrying on reform - clothes , she went out to buy lunch . The dairy lay nearly next door to Lejeune ’s restaurant . Crossing the road towards it , she caught sight of Kreisler ’s steadily marching figure approaching . First she side - stepped and half turned . But the shop would be reached before they met , so she went on , merely quickening her pace . Her eye , covertly fixed on him , calculating distances and speeds , saw him hesitate — evidently having just caught sight of her — and then turn down a side street nearly beside the dairy she was making for . Unwise pique beset her at this . Kreisler , on his side , had been only a few paces from his door when he caught sight of Bertha . As his changed route would necessitate a good deal of tiresome circling to bring him back practically to the spot he had started from , he right - about - faced in a minute or two , the danger past , as he thought . The result was that , as she left the shop , there was Kreisler approaching again , almost in the same place as before . She was greeted affably , as though to say “
64799	64857	64417	64417	Bertha	177	” He was under the impression , however , that she had lain in wait for him . He was so accustomed to think of her in that character ! If she had been in full flight he would have imagined that she was only decoying him . She was a woman who could not help adhering . “
64871	64872	64863	64863	I	0	” “
64876	64877	64863	64863	I	0	” “
64885	64905	64906	64906	I	0	” She had no information of this sort , but was inclined to rebuke him for not leaving Paris . “
64927	64950	64906	64906	I	0	” There was heavy enigmatic meaning in this , said lightly . It did not escape her , sensible to such nuances . “
64957	64961	64962	64962	Our	1098	” he asked . “
64982	64983	64976	64976	them	1099	” “
64992	65217	65218	65218	I	0	” She made her silence swarm with significant meanings , like a glassy shoal with innumerable fish : her eyes even , stared and darted about , glassily . It was very difficult , now she had stopped , to get away . The part she had more or less played with her friends , of his champion , had imposed itself on her . She could not leave her protégé without something further said . She was flattered , too , at his showing no signs now of desire to escape . His more plainly brutal instincts woke readily in these vague days . Various appetites had been asserting themselves . So the fact that she was a pretty girl did its work on a rather recalcitrant subject . He felt so modest now , ideals things of the past . Surely for a quiet ordinary existence pleasant little distinctions were suitable ? Without any anxiety about it , he began to talk to Bertha with the idea of a subsequent meeting . He had wished to avoid her because she had embodied for him the evening of the dance , and appeared to him in its disquieting colours . What he sought unconsciously now was a certain quietude , enlivened by healthy appetites . He had disconnected her with his great Night . “
65233	65245	65225	65225	I	0	” he said . Bertha ’s innuendoes had to be recognized . “
65252	65282	65246	65246	I	0	” she answered . As to Bertha , to have been kissed and those things , under however eccentric circumstances , gave a man certain rights on your interest . “
65303	65304	65297	65297	she	209	” “
65313	65314	65305	65305	I	0	” “
65318	65319	65320	65320	I	0	” “
65327	65328	65331	65331	I	0	” “
65359	65503	65347	65347	you	0	” Bertha looked at him in doubtful astonishment , taking in this sensational request . See Kreisler again ! The result as regards the Lipmann circle ! But this pleaded for Kreisler . It would be carrying out her story . It would be insisting on it , and destroying that subtle advantage , now possessed by her friends , in presenting them with somewhat the same uncompromising spectacle again . In deliberately exposing herself to criticism she would be effacing , in some sense , the extreme involuntariness of the boulevard incident . He asked her simply if he might see her again . The least pretentious request . Would the refusal to do this simple thing be a concession to Lipmann and the rest ? Did she want to at all ? But it was in a jump of deliberate defiance or “
65505	65510	65517	65517	you	1101	” that she concluded : “
65521	65522	65517	65517	you	1101	” “
65532	65533	65517	65517	you	1101	” “
65539	65594	65595	65595	I	0	” she answered very quickly , in her trenchant tone , imparting all sorts of particular unnecessary meanings to this simple acceptance . She had answered as men accept a bet or the Bretons clinch a bargain in the fist . Kreisler was still leisurely . He appeared to regard her vehemence with amusement . “
65635	65654	65625	65625	I	0	” ( The tone of this remark did not ignore or condemn , however , the kisses . ) “
65661	65662	65625	65625	I	0	” “
65673	65759	65664	65664	you	1101	” But shivers went down her back as she said it . She was now thoroughly committed to this new step . She was delighted , or rather excited , at each new further phase of it . Its horrors were scores off her friends . These details of meeting ! — these had not been reckoned on . Of course they would have to meet . Kreisler seemed like a physician conducting a little unpleasant operation in a genial , ironical , unhurrying way . “
65775	65939	65766	65766	We	1104	” he said . And with a smile of half raillery at her rather upset expression , he left her . So much fuss about a little thing , such obstinacy in doing it ! What was the terrible thing ? Meeting him ! His smiling was only natural . She showed without disguise in her face the hazardous quality , as she considered it , of this consent . She would wish him to feel the largeness of the motive that prompted her , and for him to participate too in the certain horror of meeting himself ! Back in her rooms , she examined , over her lunch , with stupefaction , the things she had been doing — conversations , appointments , complementary sensations , and all the rest , as she might have sat down before some distinctly expensive , troubling purchase that she had not dreamt of making an hour before . ‘ ‘ What a strange proceeding ! ”
65947	65959	65766	65766	We	1104	“ what sudden disease in my taste made me buy that ! ”
66025	66029	66022	66022	he	190	“ a gentleman ! ”
66215	66234	66235	66236	Fraulein Kinderbach	266	“ Is n’t it hot ? It ’s simply broiling outside . I left the studio quite early . ”
66400	66420	66397	66398	the Lipmann	1123	“ Oh ! Bertha , I did n’t know your dear ‘ Sorbert ’ * was going to England . ”
66421	66424	66430	66430	Tarr	122	“ Dein Sorbet ”
66465	66478	66456	66456	Tarr	122	“ Did n’t you ? Oh , yes ; he ’s gone . ”
66479	66489	66432	66432	Bertha	177	“ You ’ve not quarrelled — with your Sorbert ? ”
66490	66502	66503	66503	Bertha	177	“ What ’s that to do with you , my dear ? ”
66514	66537	66510	66510	she	177	“ By the way , I ’ve just seen Herr Kreisler . We ’ve arranged to go out somewhere to - morrow . ”
66538	66560	66432	66432	Bertha	177	“ Go out — Kreisler ! Liebes Kind ! — What on earth possessed you — ! — Herr — Kreisler ! ”
66561	66581	66582	66582	Elsa	266	“ What ’s the matter with Herr Kreisler ? You were .all friendly enough with him a week ago . ”
66597	66705	66582	66582	Elsa	266	“ But he ’s a vicious brute . Besides , there are other reasons for avoiding Herr Kreisler . You know the reason of his behaviour the other night ? It was it appears , because Anastasya Vasek snubbed him . He was nearly the same when the Fogs would n’t take an interest in him . He ca n’t leave women alone . He follows them about and annoys them , and then becomes — well , as you saw him the other night — when he ’s shaken off . He is impossible . He is not a person who can be accepted by anybody . ”
66706	66729	66582	66582	Elsa	266	“ Where did you hear all that ? I do n’t think that Fraulein Vasek ’s story is true . I am certain---- ”
66730	66756	66582	66582	Elsa	266	“ Well , he once was like that with me . He began hanging round , and — You know the story of his engagement ? ”
66757	66761	66582	66582	Elsa	266	“ What engagement ? ”
66762	66779	66582	66582	Elsa	266	“ He was engaged to a girl and she married his father instead of marrying him . ”
66789	66803	66780	66780	Bertha	177	“ Well , what is there in that ? I ’ve known several cases---- ”
66804	66810	66582	66582	Elsa	266	“ Yes . That by itself----- ”
66861	66875	66853	66853	Bertha	177	“ Did Fraulein Vasek give that particular explanation of Herr Kreisler ’s behaviour ? ”
66876	66914	66824	66824	She	266	“ No . We put two and two together . She did say something — yes , she did as a matter of fact say that she thought she had been the cause of Kreisler ’s behaviour . ”
66915	66967	66824	66824	She	266	“ How funny ! I ca n’t stand that girl ; she ’s so unnatural , she ’s such a poseuse . Do n’t you think , Elsa ? — What a funny thing to say ? You can depend on it that that , anyhow , is not the explanation . ”
66968	66975	66853	66853	Bertha	177	“ Sorbert has a rival perhaps ? ”
67034	67044	67026	67027	Fraulein Vasek	232	“ I was the cause of Kreisler ’s behaviour , ”
67321	67323	67309	67309	Kreisler	190	“ hunger ”

67542	67563	67564	67564	Elsa	266	“ Well , I ’m going to Renee ’s now , to fetch her for dinner . Are you coming ? ”
67570	67583	67564	67564	Elsa	266	“ No . I ’m going to dine here to - night , ”

68203	68292	68201	68201	Sorbert	270	“ My dear Bertha . — Excuse me for the blague I wrote the other day . There is nothing to be gained in conforming to our old convention of vagueness . I think we had better say , finally , that we will try and get used to not seeing each other , and give up our idea of marriage . Do you agree with me ? As you will see , I am still here , in Paris . I am going to England this afternoon . “
68296	68300	68201	68201	Sorbert	270	“ Votre SORBERT . ”
68378	68391	68331	68331	She	1155	“ Of course , Sorbert : far better that we should part ! ”
68650	68657	68658	68658	Kreisler	190	“ Who is that , then ? ”
69153	69164	69165	69165	he	190	“ No , I do n’t know who you mean , ”
69174	69189	69165	69165	he	190	“ A tall girl you say ? No , I ca n’t bring to mind---- ”
69409	69492	69404	69404	she	177	“ You were no doubt being hugged by Herr Kreisler in the middle of the pavement , the motives the ordinary ones . You might have waited till — But that ’s your own business . On the other hand , the reason of his eccentric appearance this evening was this . He had the incredible impudence to wish to make up to me . I sent him about his business , and he ‘ manifested ’ in the way you know . ”
69942	69963	69913	69913	She	177	“ Oh schwein ! schwein ! Ich hass es — ich hass dich ! Schwein ! Schensal ! schensslicher Mensch ! ”
70000	70004	69913	69913	She	177	“ schensslicher Mensch ! ”

70970	70979	70953	70953	he	190	“ You have pins and needles , Fraulein ? ”
70981	70983	70953	70953	he	190	“ Fraulein ”

71053	71060	71043	71043	She	177	“ Let me rub your arm . ”
71130	71135	71129	71129	she	177	“ had been dreaming things ”
72099	72156	72092	72092	She	177	“ cause ’ ’ against her friends . In a manner of his own , he had betrayed her and placed himself beside her friends . In any case , he had carried out in the fullest fashion their estimate of him . In being virtuous a libelled man can best attack his enemies ; in being “
72159	72249	72092	72092	She	177	” awaken a warmth of sympathy in corroborating them . Kreisler had acted satanically for her friends . She had seen Elsa and her sister twice that week , but none of the others . Ungregariousness , keeping to herself , was explained by indisposition . Sorbert was meant by this . Her continued seeing of Kreisler was known to all now , and she could imagine their reception of that news . Now she could hardly go on talking about Kreisler . This would at once be interpreted as “
72254	72687	72092	72092	She	177	” So more scandal against her name . In examining likelihoods of the future she concluded that she would have to break still more with her friends , to make up for having to retire from her Kreisler positions . To squash and counteract their satisfaction she must accentuate her independence in their direction to insult and contempt . The last half - hour of senseless outrage still took up all the canvas . Attempts to adjust her mind to a situation containing such an element as this was difficult . What could be done with it ? It took up too much space . Everything must come back and be referred to that . She wanted to tell this somewhere . This getting closed in with Kreisler — a survival , perhaps , of her vivid fear of a little time before , when he had locked the door , and she knew that resisting him would be useless — must be at all costs avoided . Who could she tell ? Clara ? Madame Vannier ? Once home , she lay down and cried for some time , but without conjuring any of her trouble . Kreisler seemed to have suddenly brought confusion everywhere . There was nothing that would quite fit in with that ridiculous , disgusting event . He had even , in the end , driven her friends out of her mind , too . She would have said nothing had one turned up then . Having left Kreisler so simply and undramatically worried her . Something should have been done . There would have been the natural relief . But her direct human feelings of revenge had been paralysed . She thought of going back at once to his room . She could not begin life clearly again until something had been done against him , or in some way where he was . He had been treated by her as a cypher , as something vague to put up against her friends . All along for the last week he had been a shadowy and actually unimportant figure . He had shown no consciousness of this . Rather dazed and machine - like himself , Bertha had treated him as she had found him . Suddenly , without any direct articulateness , he had revenged himself as a machine might do , in a nightmare . At a leap he was in the rigid foreground of her life . He had absorbed all the rest in an immense clashing wink . But the moment following this “
72689	73115	72092	72092	She	177	” he stood , abstracted , distant and baffling as before . It was difficult to realize he was there . Tarr had been the real central and absorbing figure all along , of course , but purposely veiled . He had been as really all - important , though to all appearance eliminated , as Kreisler had been of no importance , though propped up in the foreground . Sorbert at last could no longer be suppressed and kept from coming forward now in her mind . But his presence , too , was perplexing . She had become so used to regarding him , though seeing him daily , as an uncertain and departing figure , that now he had really gone that did not make much difference . His proceedings , a carefully prepared anaesthesia for himself , had had its effect on her as well , serving for both . The bell rang . She stood up in one movement and stared towards the door . She looked as though she were waiting for the bell to ring two or three times to find resolution in that , one way or the other . It rang a second and third time . She did not know how much persistence would draw her to the door . But she knew that any definite show of energy would overcome her . Was it Elsa ? She had lighted her lamp , and her visitor could therefore have seen that she was at home . Bertha went to the door at length with affected alacrity , in a pretence of not having heard the bell before , and opened it sharply . Kreisler was there . The opening of the door had been like the tearing of a characterless mask off a face . Had he not been looking at her through it all the time ? There did not seem room for them where they were standing . He looked to her like a great terrifying poster , cut out on the melodramatic stairway . She remained stone - still in front of him with a pinched expression , as though about to burst out crying , and something deprecating in her paralysed gesture , like a child . There was an analogy to a laugh struck dead on a child ’s face at a rebuff , souring and twisting all the features . Caricatured and enlarged to her eyes , she wanted to laugh for a moment . The surprise was complete . “
73119	73370	72092	72092	She	177	” Her mind formed his image , rather like a man compelled to photograph a ghost . Kreisler ! It was as though the world were made up of various animals , each of a different kind and physique even , and this were the animal Kreisler , whose name alone conjured up certain peculiar dangerous habits . A wild world , not of uniform men and women , but of very divergent and strangely living animals — Kreisler , Lipmann , Tarr . This man , about to speak to her again , on the same square foot of ground with her : he was not an apparition from any remote Past , but from a Past almost a Present , a half - hour old , much more startling . He had the too raw and too new colours of an image hardly digested , much less faded . When she had last seen him she had been still in the sphere of an intense agitation . His ominous and sudden appearance , so hardly out of that , seemed to swallow up the space and time in between . It was like the chilly return of a circling storm . She had imagined that it depended on her to see him or not , that he was pensive except when persistently approached . But here he was , this time , at last , following ! He took a step forward , her room evidently his destination . “
73373	73389	72092	72092	She	177	” Bertha said , at the same time retreating into the passage - way . — “
73392	73742	72092	72092	She	177	” Got into the room , he did not seem to know what next to do . So far he had been evidently quite clear as to his purpose . He had been feeling the same necessity as her — he , to see his victim . He had not known what he wanted with her , but the obvious pretext and road for the satisfaction of this impulse was the seeking of pardon . She had a moment before felt that she must see him again , at once , before going further with her life . — He , more vague but more energetic , had come at the end of twenty minutes . They were now together , quite tongue - tied . Once he was there , the pretext appeared unnecessary . The real reason might be found . The real reason no doubt was an intuition not to lose her absolutely , the wisdom of his appetite counselling . He stood leaning on his cane , and staring in front of him . — Bertha stood quite still , as she would sometimes do when a wasp entered the room , waiting to see if it would blunder about and then fly out again . He was a dangerous animal , he had got in there , and might in the same manner go off again in a minute or two . Now was the chance she had been fretting for to wipe out in some way what had happened ; — not to seem , anyhow , to have taken it all as a matter of course . — But it was too convenient . She had never reckoned on his actually coming and putting himself at her disposition in this way . He stood there without saying anything , just as though he had been sent for and it were for her to speak . — She would have been inclined to send him back to his room , and then , perhaps , go to him . Constantly on the point of “
73747	73864	72092	72092	She	177	” as her energetic German idiom put it , it yet evidently would then , in the first place , be the same as before . Secondly , she was a good deal intimidated by his unexplained presence . She had a curiosity about him , — curiosity rather as to how what had happened to her could be straightened out or a little sense in some way got into it . The material of this modification was in him and only there . — She hated him thoroughly now . But this new and distinct feeling gave him at last some reality . — Her way of regarding Kreisler was that of the girl a man “
73870	73905	72092	72092	She	177	” and to whom she looks to get her out of it . So she stood , anxious as to what he might have . come there to do , gradually settling down into a “
73911	74466	74467	74467	He	1235	” behind which her curiosity might wait and see what would transpire . Kreisler had at length , having allowed her to stay unexplained by his side for a week or so , divined some complication . Her case might possibly be similar to his ? She did not interest him any the more for this . But communication would not be , perhaps , absolutely useless . His only possibility of action at present was to act violently , in gusts . He did not know , when he began an action , whether he would be able to go through with it . — He could not now prevail upon himself to go through the senseless form of apology or anything else . He had got there , that would have to be sufficient . But the situation for Bertha became urgent , too . The difficulty was that there was nothing adequate to be done , that she could think of , in any way in proportion to the enormity of the occasion . Yet , to escape from the memory of Kreisler , what had happened must be wiped out , checkmated , by some action . She was still stunned and overwhelmed with the normal feminine feelings proper to the case . But yet even here there was an irregularity . Another source of infinite discomfort was that she could not even feel , as she should normally , the extent of the outrage , although it was evident enough . She had an hysterical inclination , in waves of astonishment , to accept its paradoxical and persistent appearance . This appearance Kreisler ’s peculiar manner , her own present mind and the unexampled circumstances gave it . It was nothing , — a bagatelle ! — Pooh ! it is nothing , after all ! How can it be of any importance , seeing that---- ? — This was one of those things that seem to have got into the category of waking by mistake . It had nothing to do with life ’s context . And yet it was life . She must deal with it . She had wished to free Sorbert . That had been the beginning of all this . It was with idea of sacrifice in her mind that she had committed the first folly on the boulevard . — Well , she had succeeded . What did Kreisler mean ? — At last his significance was as clear as daylight . He meant always and everywhere merely that she could never see Tarr again ! She now faced him with fresh strength , her face illuminated with happy tragic resolve . — Supposing she had given herself to a man to compass this sacrifice ? As it was , everything , except the hatefulness and violence of the act , had been spared her . And in telling Sorbert that there was something , now , between them , she had been driven to something , she would be nobly lying , and turning an involuntary act into a voluntary one . She could now , too , be tragically forbearing even with Kreisler . Herr Kreisler , I think I have waited long enough . Will you please leave my room ? ”
74489	74535	74482	74482	he	1235	“ I do n’t know what to say to you . — Is there nothing I can do to make up to you — ? I shall go and shoot myself , Fraulein ! I can not stand the thought of what I have done I ”
74558	74579	74482	74482	he	1235	“ All I ask you is to go . That will be the best thing you can do for me . ”
74581	74681	74482	74482	he	1235	“ Fraulein , I ca n’t ! — Do listen to me for a moment . — I can not even refer to what has happened without insult in the mere direction of the words . — I am mad — mad — mad ! — You have showed yourself a good friend to me . And that is the way I repay you ! Were you anywhere but here and unprotected , there would be a man to answer to for this outrage . I will be that man myself ! — I come to ask your permission ! ”
74800	74893	74797	74797	she	177	“ Let us leave all that , if you please . — It was my fault . — I should have known better what I was doing . You must have been mad , as you say . But if you wish to show yourself a gentleman now , the only obvious thing is to go away , as I have said , and not to molest or remind me any further of what has passed . There is nothing more to say , is there ? — Go now , please ! ”
74915	75016	74906	74906	she	177	“ Fraulein , you are an angel ! You do n’t know how much good you do me ! You are so good , so good ! There is nothing you can ask of me too much . I have done something I can never undo . It is as though you had saved my life . — Otto Kreisler you can always count on ! — The greatest service you can do me , that I humbly beg you may — is to ask some service of me , the more difficult the better ! — Goodbye , Fraulein . ”

75888	75894	75886	75886	Dick	276	” So it was done . “
75904	76078	75898	75898	you	122	” That too was done , partly from inquisitiveness . The young Englishman annoyed Tarr by pretending to be alarmed every time he was addressed . He had a wide - open , wondering eye , fixed on the world in timid serenity . It did not appear at first to understand what you said , and rolled a little alarmedly , even so only to be filled the next moment with some unexpected light of whimsical intelligence . It had understood all the time ! It was only its art to surprise you , and its English affectation of unreadiness and childishness . . He was a great big child , wandering through life ! The young Latin wishes to impress you with his ability to look after himself . General idiocy of demeanour , on the other hand , is the fashionable English style . This young man was six feet one , with a handsome beak in front of his face , meant for a super - Emersonian mildness . His “
76081	76627	75886	75886	Dick	276	” was large , larger than Hobson ’s . Innumerable minor Tennysons had planted it on his head , or bequeathed a desire for it to this ultimate Dick of long literary line . His family was allied to much Victorian talent . But , alas , thought Tarr , how much worse it is when the mind gets thin than when the blood loses its body , in merely aristocratic refinement . Intellectual aristocracy in the fifth generation ! — but Tarr gazed at the conclusive figure in front of him , words failing . Words failed , too , for maintaining conversation with it . He soon got up , and left , his first aperitif at Montmartre unsatisfactory . He did not take possession of his new life with very much conviction . After dinner he went to a neighbouring music hall , precariously amused , soothed by the din . But he eventually left with a headache . The strangeness of the streets , cafes , and places of entertainment depressed him deeply . Had it been an absolutely novel scene , he would have found stimulus in it . But it was like a friend grown indifferent , or something perfectly familiar with the richness of habit taken out of it . Tarr was gregarious in the sense that usually he liked his room and some familiar streets with their traces of familiar men . And where more energetic spirit suggested some truer solitude to him , he would never have sought it where a vestige of inanimate friendship remained . Here , where he had chosen to live , he appeared as though fallen in some intermediate negative existence . Unusually for him , he felt alone . To be alone was essentially a nondescript , lowered , and unreal state for him . The following morning Tarr woke , his legs rather cramped and tired , and not thoroughly rested . But as soon as he was up , work came quite easily . He got his paints out , and without beginning on his principal canvas , took up a new and smaller one by way of diversion . Squaring up a drawing of three naked youths sniffing the air , with rather worried Greek faces and heavy nether limbs , he stuck it on the wall with pins and drew his camp easel up alongside it . He squared up his canvas on the floor with a walking - stick , and fixed it on the easel . To get a threadlike edge a pencil had to be sharpened several times . By the end of the afternoon he had got a witty pastiche on the way . Two colours principally had been used , mixed in piles on two palettes : a smoky , bilious saffron , and a pale transparent lead . The significance of the thing depended first on the psychology of the pulpy limbs , strained dancers ’ attitudes and empty faces ; secondly , the two colours and the simple yet contorted curves . Work over , his depression again grasped him , like an immensely gloomy companion who had been idling impatiently while he worked . He promenaded this companion in “
76632	76856	75886	75886	Dick	276	” without improving his character . Nausea glared at him from every object met . Sex surged up and martyrized him , but he held it down rather than satisfy himself with its elementary servants . The next day , meme jeu . He sat for hours in the fatiguing evening among a score of relief ships or pleasure boats , hesitating , but finally rejecting relief or pleasure . And the next day it was the same thing . Meantime his work progressed . But to escape these persecutions he worked excessively . His eyes began to prick , and on the sixth day he woke up with a headache . He was sick and unable to work . Tarr decided he had been mistaken in remaining in Paris . The fascination of the omnibuses bound for the Rive gauche was almost irresistible . Destiny had granted him the necessary resolution to break . He could have gone away — anywhere , even . His will had then offered him a free ticket , as it were , to any end of the earth . Or simply , and most sensibly , to London . And yet he had decided to go no farther than Montmartre , in the unwisdom of his sense of energy and freedom of that moment . Now the “
76859	77059	75886	75886	Dick	276	” was not any more available . His Will had changed . It offered all sorts of different bus tickets , merely , which would conduct him , avec and sans correspondence , in the direction of the Quartier du Paradis . Why not go back again , simply , in fact ? The mandates of the governing elements in our nature , resolves , etc . , were childish enough things . His resentment against Bertha , and resolve to quit , would always be there . There was room in life for the satisfaction of this impulse , and the equally strong one to see her again . The road back to the Quartier du Paradis would probably have been taken quite soon , only it needed in a way as much of an effort in the contrary direction to get back as it had to get away . He did not know what might await him either . She might really have given him up and changed her life . He had not the necessary experience to dismiss that possibility . But at last one evening he did go . He went deliberately up to an omnibus “
77065	77091	75886	75886	Dick	276	” and took his seat under its roof . He was resolved to glut himself , without any atom of self - respect or traces of “
77093	77220	75886	75886	Dick	276	” remaining , in what he had been wanting to do for a week . He would go to Bertha ’s rooms , even find out what had been happening in his absence . He might even , perhaps , hang about a little outside , and try to surprise her in some manner . Then he would behave en maître , there would be no further question of his having given her up and renounced his rights . He would behave just as though he had never gone away or the letters been sent . He would claim her again with all the appeals he knew to her love for him . He would conduct himself without a scrap of dignity or honesty . Once the “
77222	77682	75886	75886	Dick	276	” and pride of his retiring had been broken down , it was thenceforth immaterial to what length he went . In fact , better be frankly weak and unprincipled in his actions and manner , go the whole length of his defeat and confusion . In such completeness there remains a grain of superiority and energy . But once started in his bus , a wave of excitement and anxiety surged in him with hot gushes . — What awaited him ? He fancied all sorts of strange developments . — Perhaps , after all , his journey would not satisfy his weaker movement , but confirm and establish definitely his more sensible resolves . Perhaps weaknesses would find at last the door closed against them . He smiled at the city as they passed through it , with the glee of a boy on a holiday excursion . A MEGRIM OF HUMOUR Some days later , in the evening , Tarr was to be found in a strange place . Decidedly his hosts could not have explained how he got there . He displayed no consciousness of the anomaly . He had introduced himself — now for the second time — into Fraulein Lipmann ’s aesthetic saloon , after dining with her and her following at Flobert ’s Restaurant . As inexplicable as Kreisler ’s former visits , these ones that Tarr began to make were not so perfectly unwelcome . There was a glimmering of meaning in them for Bertha ’s women friends . He had just walked in two nights before , as though he were an old and established visitor there , shaken hands and sat down . He then listened to their music , drank their coffee and went away apparently satisfied . Did he consider that his so close connexion with Bertha entitled him to this ? It was at all events a prerogative he had never before availed himself of , except on one or two occasions at first , in her company . The women ’s explanation of this eccentric sudden frequentation was that Tarr was in despair . His separation from Bertha ( or her conduct with Kreisler ) had hit him hard . He wished for consolation or mediation . Neither of these guesses was right . It was really something absurder than that that had brought him there . Only a week or ten days away from his love affair with Bertha , Tarr was now coming back to the old haunts and precincts of his infatuation . He was living it all over again in memory , the central and all the accessory figures still in exactly the same place . Suddenly , everything to do with “
77686	77878	75886	75886	Dick	276	” as he thought of a week or two before ( or what had ended officially then ) had become very pleasing . Bertha ’s women friends were delightful landmarks . Tarr could not understand how it was he had not taken an interest in them before . They had so much of the German savour of that life lived with Bertha about them ! But not only with them , but with Bertha herself he was likewise carrying on this mysterious retrospective life . He was so delighted , as a fact , to be free of Bertha that he poetized herself and all her belongings . On this particular second visit to Fraulein Lipmann 's he met Anastasya Vasek . She , at least , was nothing to do with his souvenirs . Yet , not realizing her as an absolute new - comer at once , he accepted her as another proof of how delightful these people in truth were . He had been a very silent guest so far . They were curious to hear what this enigma should eventually say , when it decided to speak . “
77883	77889	77881	77881	Bertha	177	” they had asked him . “
77896	77917	77890	77890	She	177	” he had answered . It was a fact that she had caught a summer cold several days before . — “
77921	77926	77890	77890	She	177	” they thought . — “
77933	77934	77928	77928	he	1285	” “
77944	77949	77935	77935	She	177	” Renée Lipmann said . “
77975	77976	77973	77973	she	177	” “
77995	78046	78047	78048	Homme egoiste	1286	” Tarr answered . Bertha disappears . Tarr turns up tranquilly in her place . Was he a substitute ? What could all this mean ? Their first flutter over , their traditional hostility for him reawakened . He had always been an arrogant , eccentric , and unpleasant person : “
78053	78096	78050	78051	Homme sensuel	1287	” in Van Bencke ’s famous words . On seeing him talking with new liveliness , not displayed with them , to Anastasya , suspicions began to germinate . Even such shrewd intuition , a development from the reality , as this : “
78116	78169	78170	78172	Homme egoiste ”	3523	” Comfortable in his liberty , he was still enjoying , by proxy or otherwise , the satisfaction of slavery . The arrogance implied by his infatuation for the commonplace was taboo . He must be more humble , he felt , and take an interest in his equals . He had been “
78172	78177	78170	78172	Homme egoiste ”	3523	” so far , but “
78180	78477	78478	78478	My	0	” was an exaggeration . His concupiscence had been undeveloped . His Bertha , if she had not been a joke , would not have satisfied him . She did not succeed in waking his senses , although she had attracted them . There was no more reality in their sex relations than in their other relations . He now had a closer explanation of his attachment to stupidity than he had been able to give Lowndes . It was that his artist ’s asceticism could not support anything more serious than such an elementary rival , and , when sex was in the ascendant , it turned his eyes away from the highest beauty and dulled the extremities of his senses , so that he had nothing but rudimentary inclinations left . But in the interests of his animalism he was turning to betray the artist in him . For he had been saying to himself lately that a more suitable lady - companion must be found ; one , that is , he need not be ashamed of . He felt that the time had arrived for Life to come in for some of the benefits of Consciousness . Anastasya ’s beauty , bangles , and good sense were the very thing . Despite himself , Sorbert was dragged out of his luxury of reminiscence without knowing it , and began discriminating between the Bertha enjoyment felt through the pungent German medium of her friends , and this novel sensation . Yet this sensation was an intruder . It was as though a man having wandered sentimentally along an abandoned route , a tactless and gushing acquaintance had been discovered in unlikely possession . Tarr asked her from what part of Germany she came . “
78499	78514	78494	78494	We	1289	” she answered . This accounted for her jarring on his maudlin German reveries . “
78529	78533	78534	78534	Russians	280	” he asked . “
78577	78578	78572	78572	They	280	” “
78591	78592	78595	78596	a Russian	1295	” “
78599	78600	78601	78601	I	0	” “
78607	78625	78601	78601	I	0	” said Tarr , quite forgetting where he was , and forgetting the nature of his occupation . “
78633	78634	78628	78628	you	1294	” “
78654	78672	78644	78644	I	0	” He shook himself with self - reproach and gazed round benignantly and comfortably at his hosts . “
78718	78719	78720	78720	I	0	” “
78728	78744	78722	78722	you	0	” She laughed in the direction of the Lipmann . He made a deprecating gesture . “
78757	78758	78759	78759	You	0	” “
78763	78764	78759	78759	You	0	” “
78767	78852	78759	78759	You	0	” He treated his hosts with a warm benignity which sought , perhaps , to make up for past affronts . It appeared only to gratify partially . He was treating them like part and parcel of Bertha . They were not ready to accept this valuation , that of chattels of her world . The two Kinderbachs came over and made an affectionate demonstration around and upon Anastasya . She got up , scattering them abruptly , and went over to the piano . “
78858	78862	78863	78863	She	1304	” Tarr thought . “
78885	79032	78875	78875	you	1305	” He was not intimately convinced that she would be as satisfactory . Let us see how it would be ; he considered . This larger machine of repressed , moping senses did attract . To take it to pieces , bit by bit , and penetrate to its intimacy , might give a similar pleasure to undressing Bertha ! Possessed of such an intense life as Anastasya , women always appeared on the verge of a dark spasm of unconsciousness . With their organism of fierce mechanical reactions , their self - possession was rather bluff . So much more accomplished socially than men , yet they were not the social creatures , but men . Surrender to a woman was a sort of suicide for an artist . Nature , who never forgives an artist , would never allow her to forgive . With any “
79034	79472	79473	79474	Herr Kreisler	190	” woman he had ever met , this feeling of being with a parvenu never left him . Anastasya was not an exception . On leaving , Tarr no longer felt that he would come back to enjoy a diffused form of Bertha there . The prolongations of his Bertha period had passed a climax . On leaving Renée Lipmann ’s , nevertheless , Tarr went to the café de l’Aigle , some distance away , but with an object . To make his present frequentation quite complete , it only needed Kreisler . Otto was there , very much on his present visiting list . He visited him regularly at the Café de l’Aigle , where he was constantly to be found . This is how Tarr had got to know him . Tarr had arrived at Bertha ’s place about seven in the evening on his first return from Montmartre . He hung about for a little . In ten minutes ’ time he had his reward . She came out , followed by Kreisler . Bertha did not see him at first . He followed on the other side of the street , some fifteen yards behind . He did this with sleepy gratification . All was well . Relations with her were now , it must be clear , substantially at an end . A kind of good sensation of alternating jealousy and regret made him wander along with obedient gratitude . Should she turn round and see him , how uncomfortable she would be ! How naturally alike in their mechanical marching gait she and the German were ! He was a distinct third party . Being a stranger , with very different appearance , thrilled him agreeably . By a little manoeuvre of short cuts he would get in front of them . This he did . Bertha saw him as he debouched from his turning . She stopped dead , and appeared to astonished Kreisler to be about to take to her heels . It was flattering in a way that his mere presence should produce this effect . He went up to her . Her palm a sentimental instrument of weak , aching , heavy tissues , she gave him her hand , face fixed on him in a mask of regret and reproach . Fascinated by the intensity of this , he had been staring at her a little too long , perhaps with some of the reflection of her expression . He turned towards Kreisler . He found a , to him . conventionally German indifferent countenance . “
79476	79493	79473	79474	Herr Kreisler	190	” Bertha said with laconic energy , as though she were uttering some fatal name . Her “
79496	79500	79473	79474	Herr Kreisler	190	” said hollowly , “
79505	79512	79473	79474	Herr Kreisler	190	” It also had an inflexion of “
79518	79608	79515	79515	I	0	” A sick energy saturated her face , the lips were indecently compressed , the eyes wide , dull , with red rims . Tarr bowed to Kreisler as Bertha said his name . Kreisler raised his hat . Then , with a curious feeling of already thrusting himself on these people , he began to walk along beside Bertha . She moved like an unconvinced party to a bargain , who consents to walk up and down a little , preliminary to a final consideration of the affair . “
79618	79649	79473	79474	Herr Kreisler	190	” she might have been saying . Kreisler ’s indifference was absolute . There was an element of the child ’s privilege in Tarr ’s making himself of the party ( “
79656	79707	79708	79709	Herr Kreisler	190	” ) . There was the claim for indulgence of a spirit not entirely serious ! The childishness of this turning up as though nothing had happened , with such wilful resolve not to recognize the seriousness of things , Bertha ’s drama , the significance of the awful words , “
79711	79755	79708	79709	Herr Kreisler	190	” and so on , was present to him . Bertha must know the meaning of his rapid resurrection — she knew him too well not to know that . So they walked on , without conversation . Then Tarr inquired if she were “
79759	79761	79708	79709	Herr Kreisler	190	” ' “
79769	79876	79764	79764	Sorbert	270	” she replied , with soft tragic banter . As though by design , he always found just the words or tone that would give an opening for this sentimental irony of hers . But the least hint that he had come to reinstate himself must not remain . It must be clearly understood that Kreisler was the principal figure now . He , Tarr , was only a privileged friend . With unflattering rapidity somebody else had been found . Her pretension to heroic attachment was compromised . Should not he put in for the vacated berth ? He had an air of welcoming Kreisler . “
79887	79916	79885	79885	me	0	” his manner said . As to showing him over the premises he was taking possession of — he had made the inspection , himself , no doubt ! “
79925	79933	79923	79923	Lowndes	223	” Tarr said to Kreisler , pleasantly . “
79952	79953	79958	79958	Lowndes	223	” “
79960	79964	79967	79967	him	1310	” said Kreisler , “
79969	79970	79967	79967	him	1310	” “
79980	79981	79977	79977	you	223	” “
80001	80032	79990	79990	him	1310	” Kreisler nodded over his shoulder , indicating precisely the spot on which they had met . His gesture implied that Lowndes might still be found thereabout . Bertha shrank in “
80034	80240	79986	79986	I	0	” pantomime from their affability . Prom the glances she pawed her German friend with , he must deserve nothing but horrified avoidance . Sorbert ’s astute and mischievous way of saddling her with Kreisler , accepting their being together as the most natural thing in life , roused her combativity . Tarr honoured him , clearly out of politeness to her . Very well : all she could do for the moment was to be noticeably distant with Kreisler . She must display towards him the disgust and reprobation that Tarr should feel , and which he refused , in order to vex her . Kreisler during the last few days had persisted and persisted . He had displayed some cleverness in his choice of means . As a result of overtures and manoeuvres , Bertha had now consented to see him . Her demoralization was complete . She could not stand up any longer against the result , personified by Kreisler , of her idiotic actions . At present she transferred her self - hatred from herself to Kreisler . Tarr ’s former relations with Bertha were known to him . He resented the Englishman ’s air of proprietorship , the sort of pleasant “
80244	80264	80265	80265	I	0	” that was going on . It had for object , he thought , to cheapen his little success . “
80281	80306	80270	80271	Herr Kreisler	190	” She stood still and rolled her eyes wildly in several directions , and stuck one of her hands stiffly out from her side . “
80312	80362	80310	80310	Fraulein	209	” he replied evenly . — The dismissal annoyed him . His eyes took in Tarr compendiously in passing . Was this a resuscitation of old love at his expense ? Tarr had perhaps come to claim his property . This was not the way that is usually done . “
80368	80375	80365	80366	Herr Kreisler	190	” sounded like his dismissal . A “
80389	80408	80409	80409	I	0	” was written baldly in her very bald eyes . With irony he bid good day to Tarr . “
80415	80425	80409	80409	I	0	” : Tarr shook him warmly by the hand . “
80430	80535	80409	80409	I	0	” Kreisler replied at once . As yet Kreisler was undisturbed . He intended not to relinquish his acquaintance with Bertha Lunken . If the Englishman ’s amiability were a polite way of reclaiming property left owner - less and therefore susceptible of new rights being deployed as regards it , then in time those later rights would be vindicated . Kreisler ’s first impression of Tarr was not flattering . But no doubt they would meet again , as he had said . Bertha held out her hand brutally , in a sort of spasm of will : said , in the voice of “
80538	80539	80409	80409	I	0	” “
80550	80567	80544	80544	Sorbet	161	” He did not take it . She left it there a moment , saying again , “
80572	80573	80544	80544	Sorbet	161	” “
80582	80588	80579	80579	you	1313	” he said at length . “
80607	80614	80603	80603	Kreisler	190	” — he looked after him — “
80632	80633	80625	80625	you	1313	” “
80656	80657	80654	80654	you	1313	” “
80668	80708	80709	80709	I	0	” He took her arm and dragged her towards a cafe , the first on the boulevard they were approaching . She hung back , prolonging the personal contact , yet pretending to be resisting it with , wonder . “
80720	80746	80713	80713	Sorbert	270	” purring her lips out and rolling her eyes . She went to the café in the end . For some time conversation hung back . “
80754	80755	80749	80750	Fraulein Lipmann	209	” “
80767	80768	80761	80761	I	0	” “
80771	80797	80761	80761	I	0	” Tarr felt he had five pieces to play . He had played one . The other four he toyed with in a lazy way . “
80801	80802	80807	80807	her	209	” “
80809	80814	80807	80807	her	209	” That left three . “
80819	80820	80821	80821	I	0	” “
80826	80827	80821	80821	I	0	” “
80832	80833	80834	80836	One of them	3337	” “
80838	80839	80834	80836	One of them	3337	” “
80844	80845	80842	80842	Clara	252	” “
80856	80918	80848	80848	She	252	” The solder for the pieces of this dialogue was a dreary grey matter that Bertha supplied . Their talk was an unnecessary column on the top of which she perched herself with glassy quietude . She turned to him abruptly as though he had been hiding behind her , and tickling her neck with a piece of feather - grass . “
80934	80950	80930	80930	you	0	” He filled his pipe , and then said , feeling like a bad actor : “
80970	80971	80968	80969	Herr Kreisler----	190	” “
80999	81037	80991	80991	I	0	” Genuine vehemence made Tarr have a look at her . Of course she would say that . She was using too much genuineness , though , not to be rather flush of it for the moment . “
81043	81044	80991	80991	I	0	” “
81051	81067	80991	80991	I	0	” She sat up suddenly in her chair and shook her finger in his face . “
81091	81101	81089	81089	him	190	” She collapsed , mouth drawn down at corners . “
81106	81130	81103	81103	you	0	” In insisting he would appear to be demanding an explanation . Any hint of exceptional claims on her confidence must be avoided . “
81203	81528	81197	81197	I	0	” They went to Flobert ’s from the café A It was after nine o’clock , and the place was empty . She bought a wing of chicken ; at a dairy some salad and eggs ; two rolls at the baker ’s , to make a cold supper at home . It was more than she would need for herself . Sorbert did not offer to share the expense . At the gate leading to her house he left her . Immediately afterwards , walking towards the terminus of the Montmartre omnibus , he realized that he was well in the path that led away , as he had not done while still with her . He was glad and sorry , doing homage to her and the future together . She had a fascination as a moribund Bertha . The immobile short sunset of their friendship should be enjoyed . A rich throwing up and congesting of souvenirs on this threshold were all the better for the weak and silly sun . Oh what a delightful , imperturbable clockwork orb ! The next day he again made his way across Paris from Montmartre at a rather earlier hour . He invited himself to tea with her . They talked as though posing for their late personalities . He took up deliberately one or two controversial o points . In a spirit of superfluous courtesy he went back to the subject of several of their old typical disputes , and argued against himself . All their difficulties seemed swept away in a relaxed humid atmosphere , most painful and disagreeable to her . He agreed entirely with her , now agreeing no longer meant anything ! But the key was elsewhere . Enjoyment of and acquiescence in everything Berthaesque and Teutonic was where it was to be found . Just as now he went to see Bertha ’s very German friends , and said “
81531	82197	81197	81197	I	0	” to himself , so he appeared to be resolved to come back for a week or two and to admire everything formerly he had found most irritating in Bertha herself . Before retiring definitely , like a man who hears that the rind of the fruit he has just been eating is good , and comes back to his plate to devour the part he had discarded , Tarr returned to have a last tankard of German beer . Or still nearer the figure , his claim in the unexceptionable part of her now lapsed , he had returned demanding to be allowed to live just a little while longer on the absurd and disagreeable section . Bertha suffered , on her side , more than all the rest of the time she had spent with him put together . To tell the whole Kreisler story might lead to a fight . It was too late now . She could not , she felt , in honour , seek to re - entangle Tarr , nor could she disown Kreisler . She had been found with Kreisler : she had no means of keeping him away for good . An attempt at suppressing him might produce any result . Should she have been able , or desired to resume her relations with Tarr , Kreisler would not have left him uninformed of things that had happened , shown in the most uncongenial light . If left alone , and not driven away like a dog , he might gradually quiet down and disappear . Sorbert would be gone , too , by that time ! Their grand , never - to - be - forgotten friendship was ending in shabby shallows . Tarr had the best role , and did not deserve it . Kreisler was the implacable remote creditor of the situation . CHAPTER IV Tarr left Bertha punctually at seven . She looked very ill . He resolved not to go there any more . He felt upset . Lejeune ’s , when he got there , was full of Americans . It was like having dinner among a lot of canny children . Kreisler was not there . He went on a hunt for him afterwards , and r n him to earth at the Cafe de l’Aigle . Kreisler was not cordial . He emitted sounds of surprise , shuffled his feet and blinked . But Tarr sat down in front of him on his own initiative . Then Kreisler , calling the garçon , offered him a drink . Afterwards he settled down to contemplate Bertha ’s Englishman , and await developments . He was always rather softer with people with whom he could converse in his own harsh tongue . The causes at the root of Tarr ’s present thrusting of himself upon Kreisler were the same as his later visits at the Lipmann ’s . A sort of bath of Germans was his prescription for himself , a voluptuous immersion . To heighten the effect , he was being German himself : being Bertha as well . But he was more German than the Germans . Many aspects of his conduct were so un - German that Kreisler did not recognize the portrait or hail him as a fellow . Successive lovers of a certain woman fraternizing ; husbands hobnobbing with their wives ’ lovers or husbands of their unmarried days is a commonplace of German or Scandinavian society . Kreisler had not returned to Bertha ’s . He was too lazy to plan conscientiously . But he concluded that she had better be given scope for anything the return of Tarr might suggest . He , Otto Kreisler , might be supposed no longer to exist . His mind was working up again for some truculent action . Tarr was no obstacle . He would just walk through Tarr like a ghost when he saw fit to “
82199	82202	82203	82203	You	1319	” again . “
82213	82221	82211	82211	you	1319	” Tarr asked him . Kreisler nodded . “
82231	82232	82223	82223	you	1319	” “
82235	82248	82223	82223	you	1319	” As Tarr was coming to the point Kreisler condescended to speak : “
82258	82278	82249	82249	I	0	” A space for protest or comment seemed to be left after this sentence , in Kreisler ’s still very “
82280	82304	82305	82305	You	1319	” expression . Tarr smiled at the tone of this piece of information . Kreisler at once grinned , mockingly , in return . “
82325	82330	82315	82315	I	0	” Tarr then said . “
82340	82347	82348	82348	You	1319	” Kreisler met this assurance truculently . “
82367	82368	82356	82356	I	0	” “
82378	82379	82374	82374	I	0	” “
82387	82388	82380	82380	Your	285	” “
82442	82461	82425	82425	I	0	” Tarr again raised his glass expectantly and coaxingly , peering steadily at the German . He said , “
82463	82470	82425	82425	I	0	” as he would have said , “
82475	82476	82425	82425	I	0	” “
82479	82492	82425	82425	I	0	” Kreisler answered with alarming suddenness , and an alarming diabolical smile . “
82495	82506	82425	82425	I	0	” . with finality . He put his glass down . “
82517	82526	82558	82558	your	285	” he wiped and struck up his moustaches , “
82543	82544	82558	82558	your	285	” “
82569	82570	82566	82566	I	0	” “
82583	82584	82576	82576	I	0	” “
82600	82767	82576	82576	I	0	” He called the garçon . Kreisler agreed to another drink . Why was this Englishman sitting there and talking to him ? It was in the German style and yet it was n’t . Was Kreisler to be shifted , was he meant to go ? Had the task of doing this been put on Bertha ’s shoulders ? Had Tarr come there to ask him , or in the hope that he would volunteer a promise , never to see Bertha again ? On the other hand , was he being approached by Tarr in the capacity of an old friend of Bertha ’s , or in her interests or at her instigation ? With frowning impatience he bent forward quickly once or twice , asking Tarr to repeat some remark . Tarr ’s German was not good . Several glasses of beer , and Kreisler became engagingly expansive . ‘ ‘ Have you ever been to England ? ’ ’ Tarr asked him . “
82808	82810	82811	82811	You	0	” . “
82817	82818	82811	82811	You	0	” “
82851	82852	82800	82801	the French	187	” “
82856	82857	82800	82801	the French	187	” “
82874	82999	83000	83000	They	1329	” Kreisler forgot his circumstances for the moment . The Englishman seemed to have hit on a means of escape for him . He had never thought of England ! A hazy notion of its untold wealth made it easier for him to put aside momentarily the fact of his tottering finances . Perhaps this Englishman had been sent him by the Schicksal . He had always got on well with Englishmen ! The peculiar notion then crossed his mind that Tarr perhaps wanted to get him out of Paris , and had come to make him some offer of hospitality in England . In a bargaining spirit he began to run England down . He must not appear too anxious to go there . “
83016	83020	83000	83000	They	1329	” he said . “
83031	83032	83033	83033	I	0	” “
83039	83040	83033	83033	I	0	” “
83105	83106	83108	83109	the Zigeuner	288	” “
83112	83113	83108	83109	the Zigeuner	288	” “
83120	83121	83108	83109	the Zigeuner	288	” “
83131	83154	83155	83156	English women	1335	” They pottered about on the subject of England for some time . Kreisler was very tickled with the idea of England . “
83163	83222	83155	83156	English women	1335	” Kreisler then asked with a grin . Their relations made this subject delightfully delicate and yet , Kreisler thought , very natural . This Englishman was evidently a description of pander , and no doubt he would be as inclined to be hospitable with his countrywomen in the abstract as with his late fiancee in material detail . “
83239	83258	83259	83260	Your friend	616	” — he pronounced the English word with mincing slowness and mischievous interrogation marks in his distorted face . “
83277	83278	83271	83271	You	0	” “
83298	83304	83291	83291	I	0	” he attempted with pleasure . “
83314	83338	83308	83308	You	0	” Kreisler brushed his moustaches up , sticking his lips out in a hard gluttonous way . Tarr watched him with sympathetic curiosity . “
83370	83371	83365	83365	You	0	” “
83395	83396	83388	83388	you	0	” “
83419	83420	83412	83412	They	1335	” “
83441	83445	83435	83435	you	0	” Kreisler ruminated . “
83455	83463	83464	83464	I	0	” Tarr asked in a discursive way . “
83483	83495	83496	83496	You	0	” Kreisler looked at him with resentful uncertainty for a moment . “
83520	83527	83517	83517	she	177	” he announced loudly and challengingly . “
83530	83553	83517	83517	she	177	” When he had given Tarr time for any possible demonstration , he thawed into his sociable self . He then added : “
83573	83581	83562	83562	she	177	” — he snapped his fingers inexpertly — “
83590	83591	83585	83585	She	177	” “
83612	83613	83614	83615	All Germans	128	” “

83644	83655	83633	83633	Nietzsche	289	” ' Kreisler sulked a moment till he had recovered . “
83680	83681	83718	83718	he	289	” “
83701	83702	83718	83718	he	289	” “

83886	83905	83906	83906	You	0	” He offered Kreisler a cigarette . A pause occurred to allow the acuter national susceptibilities to cool . “
83928	83929	83917	83917	You	0	” “
83995	83996	83991	83991	Nietzsche	289	” “
84006	84019	84020	84020	You	0	” Tarr asked . Kreisler laughed in a ferocious and ironical manner . “
84036	84037	84038	84038	She	177	” “
84057	84058	84059	84059	You	0	” “
84071	84076	84062	84069	a very cunning and double - faced woman	1360	” Kreisler nodded sulkily . “
84084	84085	84062	84069	a very cunning and double - faced woman	1360	” “
84109	84110	84102	84102	I	0	” “
84119	84120	84115	84115	she	177	” “
84130	84155	84115	84115	she	177	” With resentment partly and with hard picturesque levity Kreisler met Tarr ’s discourse . This solitary drinker , particularly shabby , who could be “
84157	84168	84115	84115	she	177	” so easily , whom Bertha with accents of sincerity , “
84173	84372	84115	84115	she	177	” was so different to the sort of man that Tarr expected might attract her , that he began to wonder . A certain satisfaction accompanied these observations . For that week he saw Kreisler nearly every day . A partie à trois then began . Bertha ( whom Tarr saw constantly too ) did not actually refuse admittance to Kreisler ( although he usually had first to knock a good many times ) , yet she prayed him repeatedly not to come any more . Standing always in a drooping and desperate condition before him , she did her best to avert a new outburst on his part . She sought to mollify him as much as was consistent with the most absolute refusal . Tarr , unaware of how things actually stood , seconded his successor . Kreisler , on his side , was rendered obstinate by her often tearful refusal to have anything more whatever to do with him . He had come to regard Tarr as part of Bertha , a sort of masculine extension of her . At the café he would look out for him , and drink deeply in his presence . “
84383	84667	84381	84381	her	1366	” he once shouted towards the end of the evening , springing up and calling loudly for the garçon . It was all Tarr could do to prevent him from going , with assurances of intercession . ' His suspicions of Tarr at last awoke once more . What was the meaning of this Englishman always there ? What was he there for ? If it had not been for him , several times he would have rushed off and had his way . But he was always there between them . And in secret , too , probably , and away from him — Kreisler — he was working on Bertha ’s feelings , and preventing her from seeing him . Tarr was anyhow the obstacle . And yet there he was , talking and palavering , and offering to act as an intermediary , and preventing him from acting . He alone was the obstacle , and yet he talked as though he were nothing to do with it , or at the most a casually interested third party . That is how Kreisler felt on his way home after having drunk a good deal . But so long as Tarr paid for drinks he staved him off his prey . Tarr soon regretted this last anti - climax stage of his adventure . He would have left Kreisler alone in future , but he felt that by frequenting him he could save Bertha from something disagreeable . With disquiet and misgiving every night now he sat in front of his Prussian friend . He watched him gradually imbibing enough spirits to work him up to his pitch of characteristic madness . “
84687	84700	84685	84685	Kreisler	190	” he said to her four or five days after his reappearance . “
84772	84793	84765	84765	Kreisler	190	” Bertha shuddered and looked at him with dramatically wide - open eyes , as though there were no answer . “
84802	85086	85087	85087	Sorbert	270	” she said , as though Kreisler were the bubonic plague and she were making light of it . Yet a protest had to be made . He had rather neglected the coincidence of his arrival and Bertha ’s refusal to see Kreisler . He must avoid finding himself manoeuvred into appearing the cause . A tranquil and sentimental revenant was the rôle he had chosen . Up to a point he encouraged Bertha to see his boon companion and relax her sudden exclusiveness . He hesitated to carry out thoroughly his part of go - between and reconciler . At length he began to make inquiries . After all , to have to hold back his successor to the favours of a lady , from going and seizing those rights ( presumably temporarily denied him ) , was a strange situation . At any moment now it seemed likely that Kreisler would turn on him . This would simplify matters . Better leave lovers to fight out their own quarrels and not take up the ungrateful rôle of interferer and voluntary policeman . All his retrospective pleasure was being spoilt . But he was committed to remain there for the present . To get over his sensation of dupe , he was more sociable with Kreisler than he felt . The German interpreted this as an hypocrisy . His contempt and suspicion of the peculiar revenant grew . Bertha was tempted to explain , in as dramatic a manner as possible , the situation to Tarr . But she hesitated always because she thought it would lead to a fight . She was often , as it was , anxious for Tarr . “
85099	85117	85089	85089	I	0	” she said to him , on the afternoon of his second visit to Renée Lipmann ’s . “
85127	85128	85121	85121	you	270	” “
85138	85139	85132	85132	I	0	” “
85148	85149	85150	85150	My	0	” “
85163	85164	85166	85166	you	270	” “
85178	85180	85166	85166	you	270	” ' “
85211	85218	85210	85210	Sorbert	270	” — she took his hand — “
85228	85229	85210	85210	Sorbert	270	” “
85257	85258	85262	85262	Sorbert	270	” “
85317	85318	85319	85319	I	0	” “
85329	85341	85327	85327	Kreisler	190	” Sorbert said , pulled up by what she had said . “
85356	85357	85343	85343	you	270	” “
85371	85372	85343	85343	you	270	” “
85389	85390	85379	85379	he	190	” “
85417	85418	85400	85400	Sorbert	270	” “
85424	85425	85400	85400	Sorbert	270	” “
85429	85434	85400	85400	Sorbert	270	” Kreisler certainly was a “
85437	85531	85533	85533	Kreisler	190	” — too much . The chief cause of separation had become an element of insidious rapprochement . He left her silently apprehensive , staring at him mournfully . So that night , after his second visit to Fraulein Lipmann ’s , he did not seek out Kreisler at his usual headquarters with his first enthusiasm . Already before a considerable pile of saucers , representing his evening ’s menu of drink , Kreisler sat quite still , his eyes very bright , smiling to himself . Tarr did not at once ask him “
85536	85537	85533	85533	Kreisler	190	” “
85539	85577	85533	85533	Kreisler	190	” looked as though it meant something a little different on that particular evening . He acknowledged Tarr ’s arrival slightly , seeming to include him in his reverie . It was a sort of silent invitation to “
85581	85648	85533	85533	Kreisler	190	” Then they sat without speaking , an unpleasant atmosphere of police - court romance for Tarr . Tarr still kept his retrospective luxury before him , as it maintained the Kreisler side of the business in a desired perspective . Anastasya , whom he had seen that evening , had come as a diversion . He got back , with her , into the sphere of “
85650	85842	85533	85533	Kreisler	190	” things again , not fanciful retrospective ones . This would be a reply to Kreisler ( an Anastasya for your Otto ) and restore the balance . At present they were existing on a sort of three - legged affair . This inclusion of the fourth party would make things solid and less precarious again . To maintain his rôle of intermediary and go on momentarily keeping his eye on Kreisler ’s threatening figure , he must himself be definitely engaged in a new direction , beyond the suspicion of hankerings after his old love . Did he wish to enter into a new attachment with Anastasya ? That could be decided later . He would make the first steps , retain her if possible , and out of this , charming expedient pleasant things might come . He was compelled to requisition her for the moment . She might be regarded as a travelling companion . Thrown together inevitably on a stagecoach journey , anything might happen . Delight , adventure , and amusement was always achieved : as his itch to see his humorous concubine is turned into a “
85846	85975	85533	85533	Kreisler	190	” visits to the Lipmann circle , mysterious relationship with Kreisler . This , in its turn , suddenly turning rather prickly and perplexing , he now , through the medium of a beautiful woman , turns it back again into fun ; not serious enough for Beauty , destined , therefore , rather for her subtle , rough , satiric sister . Once Anastasya had been relegated to her place rather of expediency , he could think of her with more freedom . He looked forward with gusto to his work in her direction . There would be no harm in anticipating a little . She might at once be brought on to the boards , as though the affair were already settled and ripe for publicity . “
86000	86001	85996	85997	Fraulein Lipmann	209	” “
86008	86023	86006	86006	her	1376	” said Kreisler , looking up with unwavering blankness . His introspective smile vanished . “
86027	86063	86064	86064	I	0	” was implied in his look . What a fellow this Englishman was , to be sure ! What was he after now ? Anastasya was a much more delicate point with him than Bertha . “
86082	86097	86099	86099	she	1376	” Tarr could not quite make out Kreisler ’s reception of these innocent remarks . “
86101	86262	86099	86099	she	1376	” Kreisler looked at him almost with astonishment . There is a point in life beyond which we must hold people responsible for accidents and their unconsciousness . Innocence then loses its meaning . Beyond this point Tarr had transgressed . Whether Tarr knew anything or not , the essential reality was that Tarr was beginning to get at him with Anastasya , just having been for a week a problematic and officious figure suddenly appearing between him and his prey of the Rue Martine . The habit of civilized restraint had kept Kreisler baffled and passive for a week . Annoyance at Bertha ’s access of self - will had been converted into angry interest in his new self - elected boon companion . He had been preparing lately , though , to borrow money from him . Anastasya brought on the scene was another kettle of fish . What did this Tarr ’s proceedings say ? They said : “
86296	86378	86293	86294	Anastasya Vasek	216	” A question that presented itself to Kreisler was whether Tarr had heard the whole story of his assault on his late fiancee ? The possibility of his knowing this increased his contempt for Tarr . Kreisler was disarmed for the moment by the remembrance of Anastasya . By the person he had regarded as peculiarly accessible becoming paradoxically out of his reach , the most distant and inaccessible — such as Anastasya — seemed to be drawn a little nearer . “
86387	86391	86380	86381	Fraulein Vasek	232	” he asked . “
86401	86406	86392	86392	She	232	” Tarr told him . “
86415	86416	86408	86408	you	0	” “
86419	86425	86408	86408	you	0	” Kreisler reflected a little . “
86434	86492	86495	86495	she	232	” Tarr began to scent another mysterious muddle . Would he never be free of Herr Kreisler ? Perhaps he was going to be followed and rivalled in this too ? With deliberate meditation Kreisler appeared to be coming round to Tarr ’s opinion . For his part too , Fraulein Vasek was a nice young lady . “
86499	86548	86495	86495	she	232	” His manner began to suggest that Tarr had put her forward as a substitute for Bertha ! For the rest of the evening Kreisler insisted upon talking about Anastasya . How was she dressed ? Had she mentioned him ? etc . Tarr felt inclined to say , “
86567	86584	86560	86560	Bertha	177	” Only in reflecting on this possible remark , he was confronted with the obvious reply , “
86592	87115	86588	86590	my young lady	1383	” Tarr had Anastasya in solitary promenade two days after this . He had worked the first stage consummately . He swam with ease beside his big hysterical black swan , seeming to guide her with a golden halter . They were swimming with august undulations of thought across the Luxembourg Gardens on this sunny and tasteful evening about four o’clock . The Latins and Scandinavians who strolled on the Latin terrace were each one a microscopic hero , but better turned out than the big doubtful heroes of 1840 . The inviolate , constantly sprinkled and shining lawns by the Lycée Henri Trois were thickly fringed with a sort of seaside humanity , who sat facing them and their coolness as though it had been the sea . Leaving these upland expanses to the sedentary swarms of Mammas and Papas , Tarr and Anastasya crossed over beneath the trees past the children ’s carousels grinding out their antediluvian lullabies . This place represented the richness of four wasted years . Four incredibly gushing , thick years ; what had happened to this delightful muck ? All this profusion had accomplished for him was to dye the avenues of a Park with personal colour for the rest of his existence . No one , he was quite convinced , had squandered so much stuff in the neighbourhood of these terraces , ponds , and lawns . So this was more nearly his Park than it was anybody else ’s . He should never walk through it without bitter and soothing recognition from it . Well : that was what the Man of Action accomplished . In four idle years he had been , when most inactive , trying the man of action ’s job . He had captured a Park ! — Well ! he had spent himself into the Earth . The trees had his sap in them . He remembered a day when he had brought a book to the bench there , his mind tearing at it in advance , almost writing it in its energy . He had been full of such unusual faith . The streets around these gardens , in which he had lodged alternately , were so many confluents and tributaries of memory , charging it on all sides with defunct puissant tides . The places , he reflected , where childhood has been spent , or where , later , dreams of energy have been flung away , year after year , are obviously the healthiest spots for a person . But perhaps , although he possessed the Luxembourg Gardens so completely , they were completely possessed by thousands of other people ! So many men had begun their childhood of ambition in this neighbourhood . His hopes , too , no doubt , had grown there more softly because of the depth and richness of the bed . A sentimental miasma made artificially in Paris a similar good atmosphere where the mind could healthily exist as was found by artists in brilliant complete and solid times . Paris was like a patent food . “
87128	87318	86588	86590	my young lady	1383	” He could not , however , get interested . Was it the obstinate Eighteenth Century animal vision ? When you plunge into these beings , must they be all quivering with unconsciousness , like life with a cat or a serpent ? — But her sex would throw clouds over her eyes . She was a woman . It was no good . Again he must confess Anastasya could only offer him something too serious . He could not play with that . Sex - loyalty to his most habitual lips interfered . He had the protective instinct that people with a sense of their own power have for those not equals with whom they have been associated . He would have given to Bertha the authority of his own spirit , to prime her with himself that she might meet on equal terms and vanquish any rival . He experienced a slight hostility to Anastasya like a part of Bertha left in himself protesting and jealous . It was chiefly vanity at the thought of this superior woman ’s contempt could she see his latest female effort . “
87327	87342	87321	87321	she	1384	” he thought . Kreisler - like , he looked towards the Lipmann women . “

87364	87369	87360	87360	you	1384	” he asked her . “

At that moment the drums beat to close the gardens . They had dinner in a Bouillon near the Seine . They parted about ten o’clock . For the first time since his “
89338	89346	89347	89347	I	0	” Tarr found no Kreisler at the café “
89356	89400	89347	89347	I	0	” he thought . The garçon told him that Kreisler had not been there at all that evening . Tarr reconsidered his responsibilities . He could not return to Montmartre without just informing himself of Kreisler ’s whereabouts and state of mind . The “
89402	89412	89243	89243	You	1452	” had been eluded . It must be transported rapidly “
89416	89462	89347	89347	I	0	” again , wherever and in whatever direction the sluggish stream was flowing . Bertha ’s he did not intend to go to if he could help it . A couple of hours at tea - time was what he had instituted as his day ’s “
89464	89572	89243	89243	You	1452	” of her company . Kreisler 's room would be better . This he did . There was a light in Kreisler ’s room . The window had been pointed out to him . This perhaps was sufficient , Tarr felt . He might now go home , having located him . Still , since he was there he would go up and make sure . He lighted his way up the staircase with matches . Arrived at the top floor he was uncertain at which door to knock . He chose one with a light beneath it and knocked . In a moment some one called out “
89577	89610	89347	89347	I	0	” Recognizing the voice Tarr answered , and the door opened slowly . Kreisler was standing there in his shirt - sleeves , glasses on , and a brush in his hand . “
89616	89666	89347	89347	I	0	” he said . Tarr sat down , and Kreisler went on brushing his hair . When he had finished he put the brush down quickly , turned round , and pointing to the floor said , in a voice suggesting that that was the first of several questions : “
89673	89716	89669	89669	you	1479	” Tarr at once saw that he had gone a step too far , and either shown bad calculation or chanced on his rival at an unfortunate time . It was felt , no doubt , that — acting more or less as “
89719	89746	89669	89669	you	1479	” or check , at any rate — he had come to look after his charge , and hear why Kreisler had absented himself from the café “
89753	89775	89749	89749	you	1479	” Kreisler asked again , in an even tone , pointing again with his forefinger to the centre of the floor . “
89792	89794	89784	89784	I	0	” ’ “
89832	89833	89822	89822	you	1479	” “
89841	89842	89822	89822	you	1479	” “
89858	89887	89888	89888	I	0	” The Deutscher - student was coming to the top . His voice had risen and the wind of his breath appeared to be making his moustaches whistle . “
89908	89973	89974	89974	You	1479	” Tarr was sitting stretched on one of Kreisler ’s two chairs looking up frowningly . He was annoyed at having let himself in for this interview . Kreisler stood in front of him without any expression in particular , his voice rather less guttural than usual . Tarr felt ill at ease at this sudden breath of storm and kept still with difficulty . “
89991	90136	90138	90138	you	1479	” There was no doubt this time that it was in earnest . He was intended rapidly to depart . Kreisler was pointing to the door . His cold grin was slightly on his face again , and an appearance of his hair having receded on his forehead and his ears gone close against his head warned Tarr definitely where he was . He got up . The absurdity in the situation he had got himself into chiefly worried him . He stood a moment in a discouraged way , as though trying to remember something . His desire for a row had vanished with the arrival of it . It had come at such an angle that it was difficult to say anything , and he had a superstition of the vanity about the marks left by hands , or rather his hands . “
90153	90157	90138	90138	you	1479	” he asked . “
90276	90277	90278	90278	I	0	” “
90313	90343	90305	90305	she	2072	” Tarr ’s German hesitated and suddenly struck , as though for the rest of the night . He had stepped forward with a suggestion of readiness for drama : “
90348	90401	90305	90305	she	2072	” shouted Kreisler , in a sort of incredulous drawling crescendo , shooting his hand towards the door and urging his body like the cox of a boat . Like a sheep - dog he appeared to be collecting Tarr together and urging him out . Tarr stood staring doubtfully at him . “
90403	90404	90405	90405	Heraus	1487	” “
90416	90421	90422	90422	Schnell	306	” His last word , “
90424	90657	90422	90422	Schnell	306	” dropped like a plummet to the deepest tone his throat was capable of . It was short and so absolutely final that the grace given , even after it had been uttered , for this hateful visitor to remove himself , was a source of astonishment to Tarr . For a man to be ordered out of a room that does not belong to him always puts him at a disadvantage . Should he insist , forcibly and successfully , to remain , it can only be for a limited time . He will have to go sooner or later , and make his exit , unless he establish himself there and make it his home henceforth ; a change of lodging most people are not , on the spur of the moment , prepared to decide on . The room , somehow , too , seems on its owner ’s side , and to be vomiting forth the intruder . The civilized man ’s instinct of ownership makes it impossible for any but the most indelicate to resist a feeling of hesitation before the idea of resistance in another man ’s shell ! All Tarr ’s attitude to this man had been made up of a sort of comic hypocrisy . Neither comedy nor hypocrisy were usable for the moment . Had Tarr foreseen this possible termination of his rôle of “
90660	90708	90422	90422	Schnell	306	” And ought he , he would ask himself , to have gone on with this half - farce if he were not prepared to meet the ultimate consequences ? Kreisler was quite unworthy to stand there , with perfect reason , and to be telling him to “
90712	90847	90422	90422	Schnell	306	” It was absurd to exalt Kreisler in that way ! But Tarr had probably counted on being equal to any emergency , and baffling or turning Kreisler ’s violence in some genial manner . He stood for a few seconds in a tumultuous hesitation , when he saw Kreisler run across the room , bend forward and dive his arm down behind his box . He watched with uncomfortable curiosity this new move , as one might watch a surgeon ’s haste at the crisis of an operation , searching for some necessary implement , mislaid for the moment . He felt schoolboy - like , left waiting there at Kreisler ’s disposition . It was as a reaction against this unpleasant feeling that he stepped towards the door . The wish not to “
90849	90894	90897	90897	you	1488	” or to seem to turn tail either had alone kept him where he was . He had just found the door when Kreisler , with a bound , was back from his box , flourishing an old dog - whip in his hand . “
90904	90913	90897	90897	you	1488	” He cracked the whip once or twice . “
90924	90975	90922	90922	you	1488	” Crack ! He cracked it again in rather an inexperienced way with a certain difficulty . He frowned and stopped in his discourse , as though it had been some invention he were showing off , that would not quite work at the proper moment , necessitating concentration . . “
91001	91758	90991	90991	You	1488	” He cracked the whip smartly and then slammed the door . Tarr could imagine him throwing it down in a corner of the room , and then going on with his undressing . When Kreisler had jumped to the doorway Tarr had stepped out with a half - defensive , half - threatening gesture and then gone on with strained slowness , lighting a match at the head of the stairs . He felt like a discomfited pub - loafer as he raised the match to an imaginary clay pipe rising in his mind . There was the ostentatious coolness of the music - hall comedian . The thing that had chiefly struck him in Kreisler under this new aspect was a kind of nimbleness , a pettiness in his behaviour and movements , where perhaps he had expected more stiffness and heroics ; the clown - like gibing form his anger took , a frigid disagreeable slyness and irony , a juvenile quickness and coldness . Tarr was extremely dissatisfied with the part he had played in this scene . First of all he felt he had withdrawn too quickly at the appearance of the whip , although he had in fact got under way before it had appeared . Then , he argued , he should have stopped at the appearance of this instrument of disgrace . To stop and fight with Kreisler , what objection was there to that , he asked himself ? A taking Kreisler too seriously ? But what less serious than fighting ? He had saved himself an unpleasantness , something ridiculous , merely to find himself outside Kreisler ’s door , a feeling of primitive dissatisfaction in him . Had he definitely been guilty of a lack of pluck or pride , it would have been better . There was something mean and improper in all this that he could not reason away or mistake . He had undoubtedly insulted this man by his attitude , s'en était fiché de lui ; and when the other turned , whip in hand , he had walked away . What really should he have done ? He should , no doubt , he thought , having humorously instituted himself Kreisler ’s keeper , have humorously struggled with him , when the idiot became obstreperous . At that point his humour had stopped . Then his humour had limitations ? Once and for all and certainly : he had no right to treat a man as he had treated Kreisler and yet claim , when he turned and resented this treatment , immunity .from action on the score of Kreisler ’s idiocy . In allowing the physical struggle any importance he allowed Kreisler an importance , too , that made his former treatment of him unreal and unjustified . In Kreisler ’s eyes he was a blagueur , without resistance at a pinch , who walks away when turned on . This opinion was of no importance , since he had not a shadow ' of respect for Kreisler . Again he turned on himself . If he was so weak - minded as to care what trash like Kreisler thought or felt ! He wandered in the direction of the Café de l’Aigle , gripped in this ratiocination . His unreadiness , his dislike for action , his fear of ridicule , he treated severely in turn . He thought of everything he could against himself . And he laughed at himself . But it was no good . At last he gave way to the urgency of his vanity and determined not to leave the matter where it was . At once plans for retrieving this discomfort came crowding on him . He would go to the café as usual on the following evening , sit down smilingly at Kreisler ’s table as though nothing had happened . In short , he would altogether endorse the opinion that Kreisler had formed of him . And yet why this meanness , even assumed , Tarr asked himself , even while arranging realistically his to - morrow evening ’s purification ? Always in a contemptuous spirit , some belittlement or unsavoury rôle was suggesting itself . His contempt for everybody degraded him . Still , for a final occasion and since he was going this time to accept any consequences , he would follow his idea . He would be , to Kreisler ’s mind for a little , the strange “
91762	91778	90991	90991	You	1488	” who had been kicked out on the previous night . He would even have to “
91783	92764	90991	90991	You	1488	” to be accepted at all , exaggerate in the direction of Kreisler ’s unflattering notion of him . Then he would gradually aggravate Kreisler , and with the same bonhomie attack him with resolution . He laughed as he came to this point , as a sensible old man might laugh at himself on arriving at a similar decision . Soothed by the prospect of this rectification of the evening ’s blunder , Tarr once more turned to reflect on it , and saw more clearly than ever the parallel morals of his Bertha affair and his Kreisler affair . His sardonic dream of life got him , as a sort of Quixotic dreamer of inverse illusions , blows from the swift arms of windmills and attacks from indignant and perplexed mankind . He , instead of having conceived the world as more chivalrous and marvellous than it was , had conceived it as emptied of all dignity , sense , and generousness . The drovers and publicans were angry at not being mistaken for legendary chivalry or chatelaines . The very windmills resented not being taken for giants ! The curse of humour was in him , anchoring him at one end of the see - saw whose movement and contradiction was life . Reminded of Bertha , he did not , however , hold her responsible . But his protectorate would be wound up . Acquaintance with Anastasya would be left where it was , despite the threatened aggression against his nose . Tarr ’s character at this time performed repeatedly the following manoeuvre : his best energies would , once a farce was started , gradually take over the business from the play department and continue it as a serious line of its own . It was as though it had not the go to initiate anything of its own accord . It was content to exploit the clown ’s discoveries . The bellicose visit to Kreisler now projected was launched to a slow blast of Humour , ready , when the time came , to turn into a storm . His contempt for the German would not allow him to enter into anything seriously against him . Kreisler was a joke . Jokes , it had to be admitted ( and in that they became more effective than ever ) , were able to make you sweat . That Kreisler could be anywhere but at the café de l’Aigle on the following evening never entered Tarr ’s head . As he was on an unpleasant errand , he took it for granted that Fate would on this occasion put everything punctually at his disposal . Had it been an errand of pleasure , he would have instinctively supposed the reverse . At ten , and at half - past , his rival had not yet arrived . Tarr set out to make rapidly a tour of the other cafés . But Kreisler might be turning over a new leaf . He might be going to bed , as on the previous evening . He must not be again sought , though , on his own territory . The moral disadvantage of this position , on a man ’s few feet of most intimate floor space , Tarr had clearly realized . The Cafe Souchet , the most frequented café of the Quarter , entered merely in a spirit of German thoroughness , was , however , the one . More alert , and brushed up a little , Tarr thought , Kreisler was sitting with another man , with a bearded , naif , and rather pleasant face , over his coffee . No pile of saucers this time attended him . The stranger was a complication . Perhaps the night ’s affair should be put off until the conditions were more favourable . But Tarr ’s vanity was impatient . His wait in the original cafe had made him nervous and hardly capable of acting with circumspection . On the other hand , it might come at once . This was an opposite complication . Kreisler might open hostilities on the spot . This would rob him of the subtle benefits to be derived from his gradual strategy . This must be risked . He was not very calm . He crudely went up to Kreisler ’s table and sat down . The feeling of the lack of aplomb in this action , and his disappointment at the presence of the other man , chased the necessary good humour out of his face . He had carefully preserved this expression for some time , even walking lazily and quietly as if he were carrying a jug of milk . Now it vanished in a moment . Despite himself , he sat down opposite Kreisler as solemn as a judge , pale , his eyes fixed on the object of his activity with something like a scowl . But , his first absorption in his own sensations lifted and eased a little , he recognized that something very unusual was in the air . Kreisler and his friend were not speaking or doing anything visibly . They were just sitting still , two self - possessed malefactors . Nevertheless , Tarr ’s arrival to all appearance disturbed and even startled them , as if they had been completely wrapped up in some engrossing game or conspiracy . Kreisler had his eyes trained across the room . The other man , too , was turned slightly in that direction , although his eyes followed the tapping of his boot against the ironwork of the table , and he only looked up occasionally . Kreisler turned round , stared at Tarr without at once taking in who it was ; then , as though saying to himself , “
92772	92822	92770	92770	Englishman	283	” he took up his former wilful and patient attitude , his eyes fixed . Tarr had grinned a little as Kreisler turned his way , rescued from his solemnity . There was just a perceptible twist in the German ’s neck and shade of expression that would have said “
92844	93042	92841	92841	you	1490	” But Tarr was so busy with his own feelings that he did n’t understand this message . He wondered if he had been seen by Kreisler in the distance , and if this reception had been concerted between him and his friend . If so , why ? Sitting , as he was , with his back to the room , he stared at his neighbour . His late boon companion distinctly was waiting , with absurd patience , for something . The poise of his head , the set of his yellow Prussian jaw , were truculent , although otherwise he was peaceful and attentive . His collar looked new rather than clean . His necktie was one not familiar to Tarr . Boots shone impassibly under the table . Tarr screwed his chair sideways , and faced the room . It was full of people — very athletically dressed American men , all the varieties of the provincial in American women , powdering their noses and ogling Turks , or sitting , the younger ones , with blameless interest and fine complexions . And there were plenty of Turks , Mexicans , Russians and other “
93044	93066	92770	92770	Englishman	283	” for the American ladies ! In the wide passage - way into the further rooms sat the orchestra , playing the “
93070	93074	92770	92770	Englishman	283	” Dvorak and the “
93077	93497	92770	92770	Englishman	283	” In the middle of the room , at Tarr ’s back , he now saw a group of eight or ten young men whom he had seen occasionally in the café Berne . They looked rather German , but smoother and more vivacious . Poles or Austrians , then ? Two or three of them appeared to be amusing themselves at his expense . Had they noticed the little drama that he was conducting at his table ? Were they friends of Kreisler ’s , too ? — He was incapable of working anything out . He flushed and felt far more like beginning on them than on his complicated idiot of a neighbour , who had become a cold task . This genuine feeling illuminated for him the tired frigidity of his present employment . He had moved his chair a little to the right , towards the group at his back , and more in front of Kreisler , so that he could look into his face . On turning back now , and comparing the directions of the various pairs of eyes engaged , he at length concluded that he was without the sphere of interest ; just without it . At this moment Kreisler sprang up . His head was thrust forward , his hands were in rear , partly clenched and partly facilitating his passage between the tables by hemming in his coat tails . The smooth round cloth at the top of his back , his smooth head above that with no back to it , struck Tarr in the way a momentary smell of sweat would . Germans had no backs to them , or were like polished pebbles behind . Tarr mechanically moved his hand upwards from his lap to the edge of the table on the way to ward off a blow . He was dazed by all the details of this meeting , and the peculiar miscarriage of his plan . But Kreisler brushed past him with the swift deftness of a person absorbed with some strong movement of the will . The next moment Tarr saw the party of young men he had been observing in a sort of noisy blur of commotion . Kreisler was in among them , working on something in their midst . There were two blows — smack — smack ; an interval between them . He could not see who had received them . Tarr then heard Kreisler shout in German : “
93520	94214	93507	93507	your	1492	” Conversation had stopped in the café and everybody was standing . The companions of the man smacked , too , had risen in their seats . They were expostulating in three languages . Several were mixed up with the garçons , who had rushed up to do their usual police work on such occasions . Over Kreisler ’s shoulder , his eyes carbonized to a black sweetness , his cheeks a sweet sallow - white , with a red mark where Kreisler ’s hand had been , Tarr saw the man his German friend had singled out . He had sprung towards the aggressor , but by that time Kreisler had been seized from behind and was being hustled towards the door . The blow seemed to hurt his vanity so much that he was standing half - conscious till the pain abated . He seemed to wish to brush the blow off , but was too vain to raise his hands to his cheek . It was left there like a scorching compress . His friends , Kreisler wrenched away from them , were left standing in a group , in attitudes more or less of violent expostulation and excitement . Kreisler receded in the midst of a band of waiters towards the door . He was resisting and protesting , but not too much to retard his quick exit . The garçons had the self - conscious unconcern of civilian braves . The young man attacked and his friends were explaining what had happened , next , to the manager of the cafe . A garçon brought in a card on a plate . There was a new outburst of protest and contempt from the others . The plate was presented to the individual chiefly concerned , who brushed it away , as though he had been refusing a dish that a waiter was , for some reason , pressing upon him . Then suddenly he took up the card , tore it in half , and again waived away the persistent platter . The garçon looked at the manager of the café and then returned to the door . So this was what Kreisler and the little bearded man had been so busy about ! Kreisler had laid his plans for the evening as well ! Tarr ’s scheme was destined not to be realized ; unless he followed Kreisler at once , and got up a second row , a more good - natured one , just outside the cafe ? Should he go out now and punch Kreisler ’s head , fight about a little bit , and then depart , his business done , and leave Kreisler to go on with his other row ? For he felt that Kreisler intended making an evening of it . His companion bad not taken part in the fracas , but had followed on his heels in his ejection , protesting with a vehemence that was intended to hypnotize . Just at the moment when he had felt that he was going to be one of the principal parties to a violent scene , Tarr had witnessed , not himself at all , but another man snatched up into his role . He felt relieved . As he watched the man Kreisler had struck , he seemed to be watching himself . And yet he felt rather on the side of Kreisler . With a mortified chuckle he prepared to pay for his drink and be off , leaving Kreisler for ever to his very complicated , mysterious and turbulent existence . He noticed just then that Kreisler ’s friend had come back again , and was talking to the man who had been struck . He could hear that they were speaking Russian or Polish . With great collectedness , Kreisler ’s emissary , evidently , was meeting their noisy expostulations . He could not at least , like a card , be torn in half ! On the other hand , in his person he embodied the respectability of a visiting card . He was dressed with perfect “
94216	94262	94316	94316	he	190	” suitable to such occasions and such missions as his appeared to be . By his gestures ( one of which was the taking an imaginary card between his thumb and forefinger and tearing it ) Tarr could follow a little what he was saying . “
94267	94273	94265	94265	sir	2109	” he seemed to assert , “
94295	94302	94303	94304	Herr Kreisler	190	” He pointed towards the door . “
94334	94409	94324	94324	He	190	” The Russian was as grave as he was collected , and stood in front of the other principal in this affair , who had sat down again now , with the evident determination to get a different reply . The talking went on for some time . Then he turned towards Tarr , and , seeing him watching the discussion , came towards him , raising his hat . He said in French : “
94450	94451	94441	94441	I	0	” “
94474	94505	94464	94464	I	0	” Tarr replied . But the Russian displayed the same persistence with him as he had observed him already capable of with the other people . At last Tarr said , “
94546	94731	94538	94538	you	2109	” The Russian explained with business - like gusto and precision , having drawn him towards the door ( seemingly to cut off a possible retreat of the enemy ) , that it was a grave affair . Kreisler ’s honour was compromised . His friend Otto Kreisler had been provoked in an extraordinary fashion . Stories had been put about concerning him , affecting seriously the sentiments of a girl he knew regarding him ; put about with that object by another gentleman , also acquainted with this girl . The Russian luxuriated emphatically on this point . Tarr suggested that they should settle the matter at once , as he had not very much time . He was puzzled . Surely the girl mentioned must be Bertha ? If so , had Bertha been telling more fibs ? Was the Kreisler mystery after all to her discredit ? Perhaps he was now in the presence of another rival , existing , unknown to him , even during his friendship with her . In this heroic , very solemnly official atmosphere of ladies ’ “
94733	94736	94793	94793	Kreisler	190	” and the “
94738	94773	94538	94538	you	2109	” of gentlemen , that the little Russian was creating , Tarr unwillingly remained for some time . Noisy bursts of protest from other members of the opposing party met the Russian ’s points . “
94779	94783	94538	94538	you	2109	” they shouted ; “
94803	94894	94799	94799	He	190	” Tarr liked his own farces . But to be drawn into the service of one of Kreisler ’s was a humiliation . Kreisler , without taking any notice of him , had turned the tables . The discussion was interminable . They were now speaking French . The entire café appeared to be participating . Several times the principal on the other side attempted to go , evidently very cross at the noisy scene . Then Anastasya ’s name was mentioned . Tarr found new interest in the scene . “
94900	94909	94799	94799	He	190	” the Russian was saying patiently and distinctly , “
94961	94962	94951	94951	you	1500	” “
94975	94976	94951	94951	you	1500	” “
95001	95009	95013	95013	you	1500	“ Expense ? Does he want money ? ”
95041	95049	95025	95025	he	190	“ I find you , bearded idiot ! “
95190	95193	95194	95194	he	190	“ Berne , ”
95282	95299	95300	95300	she	232	“ Mr. Soltyk and I were just going to have the ‘ five o’clock ’ somewhere , ”
95325	95352	95353	95353	She	232	“ If you consent to my accompanying you , Fraulein , it would give me the greatest pleasure to remain in your company a little longer . ”
95356	95375	95353	95353	She	232	“ Where were we going , Louis ? Did n’t you say there was a place near here ? ”
95376	95399	95430	95430	Kreisler	190	“ There is one over there . But I ’m afraid , Fraulein Vasek , I must leave you . — I have---- ”
95400	95410	95411	95411	Soltyk	206	“ Oh , must you ? I ’m sorry . ”
95435	95504	95430	95430	Kreisler	190	“ I said nothing , sir , when a moment ago , you failed to return my salute . I understand you were going to have tea with Fraulein Vasek . Now you deprive her suddenly of the pleasure of your company . So there is no further doubt on a certain point . Will you tell me at once and clearly what objection you have to me ? ”
95505	95520	95430	95430	Kreisler	190	“ I do n’t wish to discuss things of that sort before this lady . ”
95521	95541	95430	95430	Kreisler	190	“ Will you then name a place where they may be discussed ? I will then take my leave ? ”
95542	95553	95430	95430	Kreisler	190	“ I see no necessity to discuss anything with you . ”
95554	95641	95430	95430	Kreisler	190	“ Ah , you see none . I do . And perhaps it is as well that Fraulein Vasek should hear . Will you explain to me , sir , how it is that you have been putting stories about having reference to me , and to my discredit , calculated to prejudice people against me ? Since this lady no doubt has heard some of your lies , it would be of advantage that you take them back at once , or else explain yourself . ”
95652	95665	95647	95647	Soltyk	206	“ I had better go at once , to save you this — ”
95672	95684	95667	95667	he	206	“ I should have thought you would have had sufficient decency left---- ”
95685	95703	95705	95705	Kreisler	190	“ Decency , liar ? Decency , lying swine ? Decency — ! What do you mean ? ”
95735	95777	95713	95713	he	190	“ There is liar branded on both your cheeks ! And if you should not wish to have coward added to your other epithets , you or your friends will find me at the following address before the day is out . ”
96083	96087	96076	96076	he	190	“ beautiful girl , ”
96155	96216	96144	96144	He	190	“ I am a hundred different things ; I am as many people as the different types of people I have lived amongst . I am a ‘ Boulevardier ’ ( he believed that on occasion he answered fully to that description ) , I am a ‘ Rapin ’ ; I am also a ‘ Korps - student . ’ ”
96286	96289	96270	96270	he	190	“ beautiful girl ”
96315	96318	96303	96303	Kreisler	190	“ beautiful girl ”
96660	96668	96653	96654	The Russian	207	“ my friend the Frei - Herr . ”
96669	96687	96688	96689	the Russian	3839	“ Herr Kreisler does not wish to take further measures to ensure himself some form of satisfaction , ”
96693	96703	96688	96689	the Russian	3839	“ There is always the police for drunken blackguards , ”
96707	96731	96688	96689	the Russian	3839	“ If you please ! That is not the way ! It is not usually so difficult to obtain satisfaction from a gentleman . ”
96732	96749	96653	96654	The Russian	207	“ But then I am not a gentleman in the sense that your friend Kreisler is . ”
96750	96760	96761	96763	The little Russian	3853	“ Perhaps not , but a blow on the face---- ”
96765	96770	96761	96763	The little Russian	3853	“ blow on the face ”
96791	96807	96808	96808	he	3853	“ But it is most improper to ask me to stand here wrangling with you , ”
96812	96817	96808	96808	he	3853	“ You please yourself . ”
96818	96846	96847	96854	The waiter who had brought in the card	1542	“ I am merely serving my friend Herr Kreisler . Will you oblige me by indicating a friend of yours with whom I can discuss this matter ? ”
97334	97339	97320	97320	Soltyk	206	“ To the cad Soltyk “
97382	97421	97362	97362	I	0	” A little man sitting next to Soltyk with an eloquent , sleek lawyer ’s face took the letter as though it had been a public document and read it . He bent towards his friend and said : “
97431	97437	97438	97438	He	1522	” Soltyk shrugged his shoulders . “
97467	97468	97469	97469	He	1522	” “
97504	97505	97498	97498	He	1522	” “
97544	97545	97546	97546	Louis	206	” “
97561	97562	97549	97549	you	206	” “
97571	97594	97549	97549	you	206	” Stephen ( Staretsky ) got up and put himself at Bitzenko ’s disposition . The whole party became tumultuous at this . “
97609	97610	97599	97599	you	312	” “
97616	97617	97611	97611	You	312	” “
97625	97626	97611	97611	You	312	” “
97636	97649	97632	97634	you silly fool	1568	” Stephen Staretsky smiled at this with a sort of worldly indulgence . “
97663	97669	97611	97611	You	312	” he seemed to say . “
97680	97841	97671	97671	you	312	” he asked the man nearest him . He followed Bitzenko out , and Tarr followed Bitzenko . They went over to a small , gaudy , quiet café opposite , Kreisler watching them , but still with his eye on the door near at hand . Tarr was amused now at his position of dummy . He enjoyed crossing the road under Kreisler ’s eye , in his service . The evening ’s twists were very comic . Imaginative people are easy to convince of the naturalness of anything ; and the Russian was the prophet of the necessity of this affair . Stephen was not convinced ; but he soon made up his mind that Bitzenko was either Kreisler ’s accomplice in some scheme or at least had made up his mind that there could only be one ending to the matter . He went back to the café and , sitting down beside Soltyk again , said : “
97889	97906	97875	97875	you	206	” While Stephen Staretsky had been away one of Soltyk ’s friends told them about Bitzenko . “
97945	97960	97963	97963	his	1570	” Soltyk began patting his cheek gently . But his vanity ached steadily inside . “
97966	97970	97971	97971	Bitzenko	311	” asked another . “
97983	97993	97973	97973	He	1570	” Soltyk looked up and stopped patting his cheek . “
97999	98003	98007	98007	him	1570	” somebody asked . “
98009	98119	98007	98007	him	1570	” - The blows began to take effect , the atmosphere becoming somehow congenial to them . When Stephen Staretsky delivered his message Soltyk was losing his self - control . The opportunity of killing this obnoxious figure offered him so obstinately by Bitzenko — whom he disliked even more — began to recommend itself to him . This commis voyageur sent to press the attractions of destruction had won his point . Soltyk had been silent . He had been twisting up the comers of a newspaper on the table before him , and appeared struck lazy , into a kind of sullen sleepiness and detachment resembling despair . “
98123	98130	98151	98151	they	1576	” he said suddenly to Staretsky , “
98135	98136	98139	98139	you	1575	” “
98142	98147	98139	98139	you	1575	” Soltyk answered irritably , “
98164	98165	98151	98151	they	1576	” “
98167	98178	98151	98151	they	1576	” was said as though it were a common object . “
98197	98204	98205	98205	You	1575	” Stephen Staretsky stared at him . “
98219	98232	98233	98233	You	1575	” The others once more clamoured , after a moment of astonishment . “
98246	98247	98242	98242	you	206	” “
98262	98263	98257	98257	you	1575	” “
98288	98299	98300	98300	Staretsky	312	” , Soltyk looked angrily at his friends without replying . “
98309	98317	98306	98306	you	312	” he said when the exclamations stopped . “
98333	98349	98355	98355	Louis	206	” Staretsky said , leaning on the back of Soltyk ’s chair , with authority : “
98396	98397	98387	98387	you	206	” “
98419	98492	98523	98523	you	1581	” Soltyk had made up his mind . He would never have armed himself and shot Kreisler in the street . That would have been too ridiculous . It would have had the touch of passion and intimacy of a crime passionel . It would only have been dignified for an inhabitant of Nevada . He did not regard this as a duel , but a brawl , ordered by the rules of “
98497	98521	98523	98523	you	1581	” If a drunken man or an apache attacked you the best thing to do would be to fight . If he offered to “
98525	98768	98769	98769	Khudin	314	” — putting it in that way — then that would , be the best thing , too , no doubt . But Bitzenko really had brought him to this . Kreisler alone could never have hoped to compass anything approaching a duel with him . Stephen Staretsky overwhelmed him with expostulation — even reproaches . His voice rose and fell in a microscopic stream of close - packed sound . His face became shiny and the veins appeared in it . He begged Soltyk to think of his friends ! He gathered his arguments up in the tips of his fingers in little nervous bunches and held them under his friend ’s nose , as though asking him to smell them . And then , with a spasm of the body , a vibrating twang on some deep chord in his throat , he dashed his gathered fingers towards the floor . In face of this attack it was impossible , even had he wished to do so , for Soltyk to reconsider his decision . The others , too , sat for the most part watching him . Bitzenko appeared again . Soltyk became pale at the sight of this sinister figure , so bourgeois , prepossessing , and bearded , with its legend of blindings and blood and uncanny tenacity as a second . He turned to a good - looking , sleek , sallow companion at his elbow . “
98782	98844	98772	98772	you	314	” Stephen Staretsky rose . A superfine sweat moistened his skin . His extraordinary volubility was tucked away somewhere in him in a flash , in a satisfied and polished acrobatic , and he faced the Russian . Khudin rose at the same time . Bitzenko had won . Tarr was astonished at the rapid tragic trend of these farcical negotiations . “
98855	98950	98847	98848	that man	1070	” he thought . But he had not been smacked the evening before ; yet he remembered he had been passably angry . CHAPTER V Otto Kreisler , when he had entered the café Souchet , had been anxious . His eyes had picked out Soltyk in a delicate flurry . He had been afraid that he might escape him . Soltyk looked so securely bedded in life , and he wanted to wrench him out . He was not at all bad - tempered at the moment . He would have extracted him quite “
98952	100066	98772	98772	you	314	” if required . But bleeding and from the roots , he must come out ! ( Br - r - rr . The Bersaker rage ! ) He was quite quiet and well - behaved ; above all things , well - behaved ! The mood he had happened on for this particular phase of his action was a virulent snobbery . He was a painful and blushing snob ! He had , at his last public appearance , taken the rôle of a tramp - comedian . He had invited every description of slight and indignity . The world seemed to wish to perpetuate this part for him . But he would not play ! He refused ! A hundred times , he refused ! He remembered with eagerness that he was a German gentleman , with a university education ; who had never worked ; a member of an honourable family ! He remembered each detail socially to his advantage , realizing methodically things he had from childhood accepted and never thought of examining . But he had gone a step further . He had arbitrarily revived the title of Frei - Herr that , it was rumoured in his family , his ancestors had borne . With Bitzenko he had referred to himself as the Frei - Herr Otto Kreisler . Had the occasion allowed , he would have been very courteous and gentle with Soltyk , merely to prove what a gentleman he was ! But , alas , nothing but brutality ( against the grain — the noble grain — as this went ! ) would achieve his end . And the end was still paramount . His snobbery was the outcome of this end , of his end . It was , in this obsession of disused and disappearing life , the wild assertion of vitality , the clamour for recognition that life and the beloved self were still there , that brought out the reeking and brand - new snob . He was almost dead ( he had promised his father his body for next month , and must be punctual ) , but people already had begun treading on him and striking matches on his boots . As to fighting with a man who was practically dead , to all intents and purposes , one mass of worms — a worm , in short — that was not to be expected of anybody . So he became a violent snob . It was Soltyk ’s rude behaviour on the day before in the presence of Anastasya that had set him raving on this subject . The Russian Pole was up against a raving snob whose social dignity he had wounded . Bitzenko and Kreisler came out to get Louis Soltyk like two madmen , full of solemn method and with miraculous solidarity . Their schemes and energies flew direct from mind to mind , without the need for words . Bitzenko with his own hand had brushed the back of Kreisler ’s coat ; on tiptoe doing this he looked particularly childlike . They were together there in Kreisler ’s room before they started like two little boys dressing up in preparation for some mischief . Kreisler had fixed his eyes on Soltyk from his table with alert offensiveness . The prosperous appearance of the Poles annoyed him deeply . Their watches were all there , silk handkerchiefs slipped up their sleeves ; they looked sleek and new . A gentle flame of social security and ease danced in their eyes and gestures . He was out in the dark , they were in a lighted room ! He wished their fathers ’ affairs might deteriorate and their fortunes fall to pieces ; that their watches could be stolen , and their restaurant tick attacked by insidious reports ! And as he watched them he felt more and more an outcast , shabbier and shabbier . He saw himself the little official in a German provincial town that his father ’s letter foreshadowed . One or two of them pointed him out to Soltyk , and it was a wounding laugh of the latter ’s that brought him to his feet . As he was slapping his enemy he woke up out of his nightmare . He was like a sleeper having the first inkling of his solitude when he is woken by the climax of his dream , still surrounded by tenacious influences . But had any one struck him then , the blow would have had as little effect as a blow aimed at a waking man by a phantom of his sleep . The noise around him was a receding accompaniment . Then he felt hypnotized by Soltyk ’s quietness . The sweet white of the face made him sick . To . overcome this he stepped forward again to strike the dummy once more , and then it moved suddenly . As he raised his hand his glasses almost slipped off , and at that point he was seized by the garçons . Hurried out on to the pavement , he could still see , at the bottom of a huge placid mirror just inside the cafe , the wriggling backs of the band of Poles . Drawing out his card - case , he had handed the waiter a visiting - card . The waiter at first refused it . He turned his head aside vaguely , as a dog does when doubtful about some morsel offered him ; then he took it . Kreisler saw in the mirror ' the tearing up of his card . Fury once more — not so much because it was a new slight as that he feared his only hope , Soltyk , might escape him . The worry of this hour or so in which Bitzenko was negotiating told on him so much that when at last his emissary announced that an arrangement , had been come to in the sense he wished , he questioned him incredulously . He felt hardly any satisfaction , reaction setting in immediately . Bitzenko went back to Kreisler ’s door with him and , promising to return within half an hour , left him . Tarr having , as he had stipulated , left when the talking was over , Bitzenko first went in search of a friend to serve as second . The man he decided on was already in bed , and at once , half asleep , without preparation of any sort , consented to do what was asked of him . “
100085	100086	100068	100068	you	1583	” “
100089	100090	100068	100068	you	1583	” “
100097	100098	100068	100068	you	1583	” “
100101	100109	100068	100068	you	1583	” And after a minute or two , “
100114	100115	100112	100112	you	1583	” “
100124	100125	100118	100122	a German friend of mine	1584	” “
100129	100130	100118	100122	a German friend of mine	1584	” “
100140	100632	100118	100122	a German friend of mine	1584	” Bitzenko ’s friend was a tall , powerfully built young Russian painter , who , with his great bow - legs , would take up some straggling and extravagantly twisted pose of the body and remain immobile for minutes together , with an air of ridiculous detachment . This combination of a tortured , restless attitude , and at the same time statuesque tendency , suggested something like a contemplative acrobat or contortionist . A mouth of almost anguished attention and little calm indifferent eyes , produced similar results in the face . Bitzenko ’s next move was to go to his rooms , put a gently ticking little clock , with an enormous alarum on the top , under his arm , and then walk round once more to Otto Kreisler ’s . He informed his friend of these last arrangements made in his interests . He suggested that it would be better for him to sleep there that night , to save time in the morning . In short , he attached himself to Kreisler ’s person . Until it were deposited in the large cemetery near by , or else departed from the Gare du Nord in a deal box for burial in Germany , it should not leave him . In the event of victory , and he being no longer responsible for it , it should disappear as best it could . The possible subsequent conflict with the police was not without charm for Bitzenko . He regarded the police force , its functions and existence , as a pretext for adventure . The light was blown out . Bitzenko curled himself up on the floor . He insisted on this . Kreisler must be fresh in the morning and do him justice . The Russian could hear the bed shaking for some time . Kreisler was trembling violently . A sort of exultation at the thought of his success caused this nervous attack . He had been quite passive since he had heard that all was well . At about half - past four in the morning Kreisler was dreaming of Volker and a pact he had made with him in his sleep never to divulge some secret , which there was never any possibility of his doing in any case , as he had completely forgotten what it was . He was almost annihilated by a terrific explosion . With his eyes suddenly wide open , he saw the little clock quivering in the mantelpiece beneath its large alarum . When it had stopped Kreisler could hardly believe his ears , as though this sound had been going to accompany life , for that day at least , as a destructive and terrifying feature . Then he saw the Russian , already on his feet . His white and hairy little body had apparently risen energetically out of the scratch bedclothes simultaneously with the “
100635	101048	100118	100122	a German friend of mine	1584	” of his clock , as though it were a mechanism set for the same hour . They both dressed without a word . Kreisler wrote a short letter to his father , entrusting it to his second . Kreisler ’s last few francs were to be spent on a taxi to take them to the place arranged on , outside the fortifications . They found the other second sound asleep . Bitzenko more or less dressed him . They set out in their taxi to the rendezvous by way of the Bois . The chilly and unusual air of the early morning , the empty streets and shuttered houses , destroyed all feeling of reality of what was happening for Kreisler . Had the duel been a thing to fear it would have had an opposite effect . His errand did not appear as an inflexible reality , either , following upon events that there was no taking back . It was a whim , a caprice , they were pursuing , as though , for instance , they had woken up in the early morning and decided to go fishing . They were carrying it out with a dogged persistency , with which our whims are often served . He kept his thought away from Soltyk . He seemed a very long way off ; it would be fatiguing for the mind to go in search of him . When the scientist ’s nature , with immense fugue , has induced a man to marry some handsome young lady — this feat accomplished , Nature leaves him practically alone , only coming back to give him a prod from time to time — assured that , like a little trickling stream , his life will go steadily on in the bed gauged for it by this upheaval . Nature , in Kreisler ’s case , had done its work of another description . But she had left the Russian with him to see that all was carried out according to her wishes . Kreisler ’s German nature that craved discipline , a course marked out , had got more even than it asked for . It had been presented with a mimic Fate . But Bitzenko evidently took his pleasure morosely . The calm and assurance of the evening before had given place to a brooding humour . He was only restored to a silent and intense animation on hearing his “
101050	101124	100118	100122	a German friend of mine	1584	” speak . He produced this somewhere in the Bois , and insisted on his principal having a little practice as they had plenty of time to ' spare . This was a very imprudent step . It might draw attention to their movements . Kreisler proved an excellent shot . Then the Russian himself , with impassible face , emptied a couple of chambers into a tree - trunk . He put his “
101126	101262	101263	101265	A beautiful woman	3649	” back into his pocket hastily after this , as though startled at his own self - indulgence . A piece of waste land , on the edge of a wood , well hidden on all sides , had been chosen for the duel . The enemy was not on the ground . Kreisler ’s passivity still subsisted . So far he had felt that Accident had been dealt a shrewd blow and brought to its knees . He was in good hands . Until this was all over he had nothing to worry about . Fresh compartment . The duel became for him , as he stood on the damp grass , conventional . It was a duel like another . He was seeking reparation by arms . He had been libelled and outraged . “
101266	101828	100118	100122	a German friend of mine	1584	” was at the bottom of it . Life had no value for him ! Tant pis for the other man who had been foolhardy enough to cross his path . His coat - collar turned up , he looked sternly towards the road , his moustaches blowing a little in the wind . He asked Bitzenko for a cigarette . That gentleman did not smoke , but the other Russian produced a khaki cigarette with a long mouthpiece . He struck a light . As Kreisler lit his cigarette at it , his hand resting against the other ’s , a strange feeling shot through him at the contact of this flesh . He moistened his lips and spat out a piece of the mouthpiece he had bitten through . The hour arranged came round and there was still no sign of anybody . The possibility of a hitch in the proceedings dawned on Kreisler . Personal animosity for Soltyk revived . That idea of obstinacy in a caprice , instead of merely carrying out something prearranged and unavoidable , despite his passivity , had proved really the wakefulness of his will . He looked towards his companions , alone there on the ground of the encounter . They were an unsatisfactory pair , after all . They did not look a winning team . He reproached himself for having hit just on this Russian for assistance . Bitzenko , on the other hand , was deep in thought . He was rehearsing his part of second . The duel in which he had blinded his adversary was a figment of his boyish brain , confided with tears in his voice one evening to a friend . His only genuine claim to activity was that , in a perfect disguise , he had assisted the peasants of his estate to set fire to his . little Manor House during the revolution of 1906 for the fun of the thing and in an access of revolutionary sentiment . Afterwards he had assisted the police with information in the investigation of the affair , also anonymously . All this he kept to himself . He referred to his past in Russia in a way that conjured up more luridness than the flames of his little chateau ( which did not burn at all well ) warranted . Bitzenko was quite in his element climatically ; whereas Kreisler felt his hands getting so cold that he thought they might fail him in the duel . But a car was heard beyond the trees on the Paris road . This sound in the listless blur of nature was masterful in its significance . It struck steadily and at once into brutish apathy . It so plainly knew what it wanted . It had perhaps outstripped men in that . Men in their soft bodies still contained the apathy of the fields . Their mind had burst out of them and taken these crawling pulps up on its rigid back . It was Staretsky ’s car . With its load of hats it drew up . The four members of the other party came on to the field , the fourth a young Polish doctor . They walked quickly . Bitzenko went to meet them . Staretsky protested energetically that the duel must not proceed . “
101864	101891	101894	101895	your principal	1588	” But he felt all the same that the prospect of having a little pond of blood at his door was an alluring one for Bitzenko . “
101926	101930	101924	101924	his	1588	” Bitzenko stiffened . “
101949	102732	101924	101924	his	1588	” The little Russian kept up his cunning and baffling wrangle . Soltyk ’s eyes steadily avoided Kreisler ’s person . He hoped this ridiculous figure might make some move enabling them to abandon the duel . But the idea of a favour coming from such a quarter was repellent . His stomach had been out of order the day before — he wondered if it would surge up , disgrace him . He might be sick at any moment . He saw himself on tiptoe , in an ignominious spasm , the proceedings held up , friends and enemies watching . He kept his eyes off Kreisler as a man on board ship keeps his eyes off a dish of banana fritters or a poached egg . Kreisler , from twenty yards off , stared through his glasses at the group of people he had assembled , as though he had been examining the enemy through binoculars . Obediently , erect and still , he appeared rather amazed at what was occurring . Soltyk , in rear of the others , struggled with his bile . He slipped into his mouth a sedative tablet , oxide of bromium and heroin . This made him feel more sick . For a few moments he stood still in horror , expecting to vomit at every moment . The blood rushed to his head and covered the back of his neck with a warm liquid sheet . Kreisler ’s look of surprise deepened . He had seen Soltyk slipping something into his mouth , and was puzzled and annoyed , like a child . What was he up to ? Poison was the only guess he could give . What on earth---- ? Having taken part in many mensurs he knew that for this very serious duel his emotions were hardly adequate . His nervous system was as quiescent as a corpse ’s . He became offended with his phlegm . All this instinctive resistance to the idea of Death , the indignity of being nothing , was rendered empty by his premature insensitiveness . He tried to visualize and feel . In a few minutes he might be dead ! That had so little effect that he almost laughed . Then he reflected that that man over there might in a few minutes be wiped out . He would become a disintegrating mess , uglier than any vitriol or syphilis could make him . All that organism he , Kreisler , would be turning into dung , as though by magic . He , Kreisler , is insulted . The sensations and energies of that man deny him equality of existence . He , Kreisler , lifts his hand , presses a little bar of steel , and the other is swept away into the earth . Heaven knows where the insulting spirit goes to . But the physical disfigurement at least is complete . He went through it laboriously . But it fell flat as well . He was too near the event to benefit by his fancy . Possibilities were weakened by the nearness of Certainty . His momentary resentment with Bitzenko survived , and he next became annoyed at being treated like an object , as he felt it . He was not deliberately conscious of much . But , try as he would to elude the disgraces and besmirchings of death , people refused to treat him as anything but a sack of potatoes . There four or five men had been arguing about him for the last five minutes , and they had not once looked his way . But clearly Bitzenko was defending Ms duel . Why should Bitzenko go on disposing of him in this fashion ? He took everything for granted ; he never so much as appealed to him , even once . Had Bitzenko been commissioned to hustle him out of existence ? But Soltyk . There was that fellow again slipping something into his mouth ! A cruel and fierce sensation of mixed real and romantic origin rose hotly round his heart . He loved that man ! But because he loved him he wished to plunge a sword into him , to plunge it in and out and up and down 1 Why had pistols been chosen ? He would let him off for two pins ! He would let him off if---- Yes ! He began pretending to himself that the duel might after all not take place . That was the only way he could get anything out of it . He laughed ; then shouted out in German : “
102737	102774	101924	101924	his	1588	” They all looked round . Soltyk did not turn , but the side of his face became crimson . Kreisler felt a surge of active passion at the sight of the blood in his face . “
102779	102833	101924	101924	his	1588	” Kreisler shouted again , putting out the palm of his hand , and laughing in a thick , insulting , hearty way . He was now a Knabe . He was young and cheeky . His last words had been said with quick cleverness . The heavy coquetting was double - edged . “
102839	102844	102836	102836	you	0	” Bitzenko called back . “
102854	103099	102851	102852	Herr Soltyk	205	” They all turned towards the other principal to the duel , standing some yards on the other side of them . Head thrown back and eyes burning , Soltyk gazed at Kreisler . It was genuine , but not very strong . If killing could be embodied in the organ that sees — a new function of expression — a perfect weapon would exist . Only the intensest expression being effective , such spiritual blasting powers would be a solution of the arbitrary decisions of force . Words , glances , music are at present as indirect as hands and cannons . Such music might be written , however , that no fool , hearing it , could survive . Whether it throttled him in a spasm of disgust or of shame is immaterial . Soltyk ’s battery was too conventional to pierce the layers of putrifying tragedy , Kreisler ’s bulwark . It played to the limit of its power . His cheeks were a dull red : his upper lip was stretched tightly over the gums . The white line of teeth made his face look as though he were laughing . He stamped his foot on the ground with the impetuous grace of a Russian dancer , and started walking hurriedly up and down . He glared at his seconds as well , but although sick with impatience made no protest . A peal of drawling laughter came from Kreisler : “
103107	103146	103104	103104	My	0	” he shouted . Bitzenko came over and asked Kreisler if he still , for his part , was of the same mind , that the duel should go on . The principal stared impenetrably at the second . “
103159	103192	103104	103104	My	0	” he began slowly .. He was going to play with Bitzenko too , against whom his humour had shifted . A look of deepest dismay appeared in the Russian ’s face . “
103201	103202	103203	103203	I	0	” “
103218	103233	103234	103234	You	0	” and Kreisler went on staring at Bitzenko with his look of false surprise . “
103246	103304	103234	103234	You	0	” he then said furiously . With a laugh at Bitzenko ’s miserable face and evident pleasure at his quick - change temperamental , facial agility , he left him , walking towards the other assistants . Addressing Staretsky , his face radiating affability , stepping with caution , as though to avoid puddles , he said : “
103333	103342	103343	103343	I	0	” He smiled archly and expectantly at Staretsky . “
103351	103352	103348	103348	you	0	” “
103369	103370	103358	103358	You	0	” “
103381	103382	103358	103358	You	0	” “
103388	103396	103358	103358	You	0	” Soltyk had come up behind Staretsky . “
103402	103774	103775	103775	Acha	322	” he asked loudly . Kreisler stepped forward so quickly that he was beside him before Soltyk could move . With one hand coaxingly extended towards his arm , he was saying something , too softly for the others to hear . He had immobilized everybody by his rapid action . Surprise had shot their heads all one way . They stood , watching and listening , screwed into astonishment as though by deft Angers . His soft words , too , must have carried sleep . Their , insults and their honey clogged up his enemy . A hand had been going up to strike . But at the words it stopped dead . So much new matter for anger had been poured into the ear that it wiped out all the earlier impulse . Action must be again begun right down from the root . Kreisler thrust his mouth forward amorously , his body in the attitude of the eighteenth - century gallant , as though Soltyk had been a woman . The will broke out frantically from the midst of bandages and a bulk of suddenly accruing fury . Soltyk tore at himself first , writhing upright , a statue ’s bronze softening , suddenly , with blood . He became white and red by turns . His blood , one heavy mass , hurtled about in him , up and down , like a sturgeon in a narrow tank . All the pilules he had taken seemed acting sedatively against the wildness of his muscles . The bromium fought the blood . His hands were electrified . Will was at last dashed all over him , an Arctic douche . The hands flew at Kreisler ’s throat . His nails made six holes in the flesh and cut into the tendons beneath . Kreisler was hurled about . He was pumped backwards and . forwards . His hands grabbed a mass of hair ; as a man slipping on a precipice gets hold of a plant . Then they gripped along the coat - sleeves , connecting him with the engine he had just overcharged with fuel . A sallow white , he became puffed and exhausted . “
103779	103808	103809	103809	Tchun	323	” a noise , the beginning of a word , came from his mouth . He sank on his knees . A notion of endless violence filled him . “
103821	103858	103809	103809	Tchun	323	” He fell on his back , and the convulsive arms came with him . The strangling sensation at his neck intensified . Meanwhile a breath of absurd violence had smitten everywhere . Staretsky had said : “
103876	103890	103809	103809	Tchun	323	” Bitzenko had begun a discourse . Staretsky turned on him , shrieking , “
103899	104209	103809	103809	Tchun	323	” At this Bitzenko rapped him smartly on the cheek . Staretsky , who spent his mornings sparring with a negro pugilist , gave him a blow between the eyes , which laid him out insensible . Bitzenko ’s friend , interfering when he saw this , seized Staretsky round the waist , and threw him down , falling with him . The doctor and the other second , Wenceslas Khudin , went to separate Soltyk and Kreisler , scuffling and exhorting . The field was filled with cries , smacks , and harsh movements . This Slav chaos gradually cleared up . Soltyk was pulled off ; Staretsky and the young Russian were separated . Bitzenko once more was on his feet . Then they were all dusting their trousers , arranging their collars , picking up their hats . Kreisler stood stretching his neck to right and left alternately . His collar was torn open ; blood trickled down his chest . He had felt weak and unable to help himself against Soltyk . Actual fighting appeared a contingency outside the calculations or functioning of his spirit . Brutal by rote and in the imagination , if action came too quickly before he could inject it with his dream , his forces were disconnected . This physical melee had been a disturbing interlude . He was extremely offended at it . His eyes rested steadily and angrily on Soltyk . This attempt on his part to escape into physical and secondary things he must be made to pay for ! He staggered a little , with the dignity of the drunken man . His glasses were still on his nose . They had weathered the storm , tightly riding his face , because of Soltyk ’s partiality for his neck . Staretsky took Soltyk by the arm . “
104246	104278	104239	104239	You	206	” Soltyk was panting , his mouth opening and shutting . He first turned this way , then that . His , action was that of a man avoiding some importunity . “
104285	104291	104239	104239	You	206	” he gasped in French . “
104299	104310	104311	104311	Mais	324	” All his internal disorganization was steadily claiming his attention . “
104327	104452	104239	104239	You	206	” Staretsky slipped his arm through his . Half supporting him , he began urging him along towards the car . Soltyk , stumbling and coughing , allowed himself to be guided . Khudin and the doctor had been talking together , as the only two men on the field in full possession of their voices and breath . When they saw their friends moving off , they followed . Bitzenko , recuperating rapidly , started after them . Kreisler saw all this at first with indifference . He had taken his handkerchief out and was dabbing his neck . Then suddenly , with a rather plaintive but resolute gait , he ran after his second , his eye fixed on the retreating Poles . “
104466	104544	104463	104463	your	1594	” he said hoarsely . His voice had been driven back into the safer depths of his body . It was a new and unconvincing one . Bitzenko did not appear to understand . Kreisler plucked the revolver out of his pocket with the deftness of an animal . There was a report . He was firing in the air . Staretsky had faced quickly round , dragging Soltyk . Kreisler was covering them with the Browning . “
104547	104551	104463	104463	your	1594	” he shouted . “
104572	104595	104559	104559	I	0	” Still holding them up , he ordered Bitzenko to take over to them one of the revolvers provided for the duel . “
104688	104699	104700	104700	Kreisler	190	“ Move and I fire ! Move and I fire ! ”
104738	104747	104749	104749	Staretsky	312	“ Do n’t touch the pistols , Louis ! ”
104774	104787	104762	104762	He	312	“ Do n’t touch them , Louis . They dare n’t shoot ! ”
104801	104806	104807	104807	Kreisler	190	“ Leave him both , ”
104841	104854	104855	104855	Kreisler	190	“ Will you take up one of those pistols , or both ? ”
104858	104872	104855	104855	Kreisler	190	“ Kindly point that revolver somewhere else , and allow us to go ! ”
104877	104901	104902	104902	He	312	“ I ’m not speaking to you , pig - face ! It ’s you I ’m addressing . Take up that pistol ! ”
104912	104942	104943	104943	Kreisler	190	“ Herr Soltyk is unarmed ! The pistols you want him to take only have one charge . Yours has twelve . In any case it would be murder ! ”
105161	105174	105175	105175	Staretsky	312	“ He ’s dead ! He ’s dead ! He ’s dead ! ”
105195	105205	105175	105175	Staretsky	312	“ What are you looking for ? Come quickly ! ”
105206	105212	105213	105213	he	190	“ Where is the Browning ? ”
105302	105319	105331	105332	The Russian	207	“ Come along , I ’ve got the Browning . There ’s no time to lose . ”
105619	105622	105625	105625	he	190	“ Run ! ”
106930	106938	106981	106981	he	1680	“ Qu’est - ce qu’il te faut ? ”
106939	106944	106946	106946	Kreisler	190	“ Foir le Commissaire , ”
106948	106961	106946	106946	Kreisler	190	“ Tu ne peux pas le voir . Il n’y est pas . ”
107233	107245	107224	107224	One	2062	“ And what are you doing there , my good fellow ? ”
107246	107262	107214	107214	them	1701	“ I had tuel , and killed the man ; I have walked for more days--- ”
107263	107272	107214	107214	them	1701	“ Yes , we know all about that ! ”
107273	107282	107284	107284	another	3900	“ So you had a duel , eh ? ”
107306	107317	107287	107287	they	1701	“ Well , is that all you have to say ? ”
107318	107323	107284	107284	another	3900	“ I would eat . ”
107324	107354	107287	107287	they	1701	“ Yes ! your two friends inside also have big appetites . But come to the point . Have you anything to tell us about your compatriots inside there ? ”
107444	107449	107437	107437	He	190	“ What a nerve ! ”
107450	107515	107516	107516	They	1710	“ Va t’en ! If you do n’t want to tell us anything , clear out . Be quick about it ! A pretty lot of trouble you cursed Germans are giving us . You ’ll none of you speak when it comes to the point . You all stand staring like boobies . But that wo n’t pay here . Off you go ! ”
107544	107555	107541	107541	He	1680	“ Passez votre chemin ! Do n’t stand gaping there ! ”
107682	107689	107690	107690	He	1680	“ En voila un joli gigolo ! ”
107697	107711	107712	107712	He	1680	“ Eh ! le copain ! Tu voudrais coucher a la belle étoile ? ”
107716	107739	107712	107712	He	1680	“ Oh , la ! Tu ne peux pas dormir ici ! Houp ! Dépêches - toi . Mets - toi debout ! ”

110323	110339	110270	110270	they	1819	“ Yes , I have heard that Kreisler shot him before he was ready or something-- ”
110341	110359	110305	110305	Tarr	122	-“I heard that he was shot when he was unarmed . There was no duel at all . ”
110360	110372	110373	110373	She	177	“ Oh , that is not the version I have heard . ”
110382	110393	110394	110394	Tarr	122	“ I was Kreisler ’s second for half an hour , ”

110418	110456	110412	110412	She	177	“ I happened to be there , and was asked to help him until somebody else could be found . I did not suspect him , I may say , of meaning to go to such lengths . ”
110457	110470	110521	110521	Kreisler	190	“ What was the reason of it all — do you know ? ”
110471	110485	110521	110521	Kreisler	190	“ According to Kreisler , they had done some smacking earlier in the day---- ”
110486	110508	110412	110412	She	177	“ Yes . Herr Kreisler met Soltyk and myself . I think that Soltyk then was a little in the wrong . ”
110509	110514	110521	110521	Kreisler	190	“ I dare say . ”
110654	110665	110647	110647	Anastasya	216	“ There is your fiancee . She seems rather upset . ”

111525	111537	111538	111538	He	122	“ No , it is difficult to get away , apparently . ”
111720	111729	111730	111730	she	177	“ We have n’t come to that yet , ”
111733	111738	111730	111730	she	177	“ Have n’t we ! ”
111739	111747	111702	111702	his	122	“ I did n’t think we had . ”
111756	111771	111772	111772	Her	177	“ Let me take your coat off . You ’ll be hot in here . ”
111851	111857	111858	111858	Tarr	122	“ You look very well , ”
111861	111869	111858	111858	Tarr	122	“ I put these on for you . ”
111952	111973	111941	111941	He	122	“ I am very flattered at your thinking of me in that way . I am afraid I do not deserve---- ”
111974	111995	111948	111950	a reasonable man	1845	“ I want you to deserve , though . You are absurd about women . You are like a schoolboy ! ”
111996	112004	111941	111941	He	122	“ Oh , you ’ve noticed that ? ”
112005	112011	112012	112012	She	1846	“ It does n’t require much---- ”
112095	112107	112108	112108	she	1846	“ You are extremely recalcitrant to intelligence , are n’t you ? ”
112111	112118	112108	112108	she	1846	“ In women , you mean ? ”
112119	112122	112108	112108	she	1846	“ Yes . ”
112123	112134	112108	112108	she	1846	“ I suppose I am . My tastes are simple . ”
112135	112152	112108	112108	she	1846	“ I do n’t know anything about your tastes , of course . I ’m guessing . ”
112153	112163	112108	112108	she	1846	“ You can take it that you are right . ”
112223	112226	112227	112227	she	1846	“ Well , ”
112238	112268	112227	112227	she	1846	“ I feel you see some disability in sensible women that does not exist . It does n’t irritate you too much to hear a woman talking about it ? ”
112269	112295	112297	112297	he	122	“ Of course not — you . You are so handsome . I should n’t like it if you were less so . Such good looks ”
112303	112363	112227	112227	she	1846	“ get us out of arty coldness . You are all right . The worst of looks like yours is that sense has about the same effect as nonsense . Sense is a delightful anomaly just as rot would be ! You do n’t require words or philosophy . But they give one a pleasant tickling all the same . ”
112364	112406	112227	112227	she	1846	“ I am glad you are learning . However , do n’t praise me like that . It makes me a little shy . I. know how you feel about women . You feel that good sense gets in the way . ”
112407	112425	112227	112227	she	1846	“ It interferes with the senses , you mean ? I do n’t think I feel that altogether---- ”
112426	112455	112227	112227	she	1846	“ You feel I ’m not a woman , do n’t you ? Not properly a woman , like your Bertha . There ’s no mistake about her ! ”
112456	112499	112227	112227	she	1846	“ One requires something unconscious , perhaps . I ’ve never met any woman who interested me but was ten times more stupid than I. I want to be alone in those things . I like it to be subterranean as well . ”
112500	112520	112521	112521	Her	1852	“ Well , I have a cave ! I ’ve got all that , too . I promise you . ”
112537	112554	112535	112535	himself	122	“ I — am — a woman- , not a man . That is the fact . ”
112556	112558	112535	112535	himself	122	“ Fact ”
112565	112578	112579	112579	She	1852	“ You do n’t realize that — I assure you I am ! ”
112606	112610	112579	112579	She	1852	“ I know . ”
112621	112725	112726	112726	She	1853	“ No , you know far less than you think . See here ; I set out thinking of you in this way — ‘ Nothing but a female booby will please that man ! ’ I wanted to please you , but I could n’t do it on those lines . I ’m going to make an effort along my own lines . You are like a youngster who has n’t got used to the taste of liquor ; you do n’t like it . You have n’t grown up yet . I want to make you drunk and see what happens ! ”
112779	112801	112776	112776	It	1855	“ Young man , what is there you find in your Bertha that can not be provided along with superior sense ? ”
112864	112887	112839	112839	She	1853	“ Come , let ’s have some dinner . I ’m hungry . We can discuss this problem better after a beefsteak ! ”
113083	113092	113098	113098	her	1867	“ The face that launched a thousand ships . ”
113203	113211	113196	113196	She	1867	“ You are a savage , Tarr ! ”
113222	113245	113246	113246	She	1867	“ You are afraid of typhoid , and your palate is as conservative as an ox ’s . Give me a kiss ! ”
113280	113289	113290	113290	Tarr	122	“ Why , man , you never think ! ”
113293	113327	113290	113290	Tarr	122	“ No , I ’m not very observant in many things . But I have a defence . All that part of me is rudimentary . But that is as it should be . ”
113328	113336	113248	113248	her	1867	“ How — as it should be ? ”
113337	113349	113290	113290	Tarr	122	“ I do n’t disperse myself . I specialize on necessities . ”
113351	113358	113290	113290	Tarr	122	“ Do n’t you call food---- ? ”
113359	113381	113248	113248	her	1867	“ Not in the way you ’ve been considering it . Listen . Life is art ’s rival and vice versa . ”
113382	113390	113248	113248	her	1867	“ I do n’t see the opposition . ”
113391	113408	113290	113290	Tarr	122	“ No , because you mix them up . You are the archenemy of any picture . ”
113410	113430	113248	113248	her	1867	“ I ? Nonsense ! But art comes out of life , in any case . What is art ? ”
113431	113450	113248	113248	her	1867	“ My dear girl — life with all the nonsense taken out of it . Will that do ? ”
113451	113461	113462	113462	She	1872	“ Yes . But what is art — especially ? ”
113472	113484	113462	113462	She	1872	“ Are we in life , now ? What is art ? ”
113485	113514	113248	113248	her	1867	“ Life is anything that could live and die . Art is peculiar ; it is anything that lives and that yet you can not imagine as dying . ”
113515	113538	113248	113248	her	1867	“ Why can not art die ? If you smash up a statue , it is as dead as a dead man . ”
113539	113578	113462	113462	She	1872	“ No , it is not . That is the difference . It is the God , or soul , we say , of the man . It always has existed , if it is a true statue . ”
113579	113594	113248	113248	her	1867	“ But can not you say of some life that it could not die ? ”
113595	113685	113248	113248	her	1867	“ No , because in that case it is the real coming through . Death is the one attribute that is peculiar to life . It is the something that it is impossible to imagine in connexion with art . Reality is entirely founded on this fact , that of Death . All action revolves round that , and has it for motif . The purest thought is totally ignorant of death . Death means the perpetual extinction of impertinent sparks . But it is the key of life . ”
113686	113705	113248	113248	her	1867	“ But what is art t You are talking about it as though I knew what it was ! ”
113706	113727	113462	113462	She	1872	“ What is life , do you know ? Well , I know what art is in the same way . ”
113728	113779	113248	113248	her	1867	“ Yes , but I ask you as a favour to define it for me . A picture is art , a living person is fife . We sitting here are life ; if we were talking on a stage we should be art . How would you define art ? ”
113780	113854	113248	113248	her	1867	“ Well , let ’s take your example . But a picture , and also the actors on a stage , are pure life . Art is merely what the picture and the stage - scene represent , and what we now , and any living person as such , only , do not . That is why you can say that the true statue can be smashed , and yet not die . ”
113855	113866	113462	113462	She	1872	“ Still , what is it ? What is art ? ”
113867	113877	113248	113248	her	1867	“ It is ourselves disentangled from death and accident . ”
113878	113884	113248	113248	her	1867	“ How do you know ? ”
113885	113941	113462	113462	She	1872	“ I feel that is so , because I notice that that is the essential point to grasp . Death is the thing that differentiates art and life . Art is identical with the idea of permanence . It is a continuity and not an individual spasm . Life is the idea of the person . ”
113975	114022	113248	113248	her	1867	“ You say that the actors on the stage are pure life , yet they represent something that we do not . But ‘ all the world ’s a stage , ’ is n’t it ? So how do we not also stand for that something ? ”
114023	114045	113248	113248	her	1867	“ Yes , life does generally stand for that something too ; but it only emerges and is visible in art . ”
114046	114056	113248	113248	her	1867	“ Still I do n’t know what art is ! ”
114057	114206	113248	113248	her	1867	“ You ought to by this time . However , we can go further . Consider the content of what we call art . A statue is art , as you said ; you are life . There is bad art and bad life . We will only consider the good . A statue , then , is a dead thing ; a lump of wood or stone . Its lines and masses are its soul . Anything living , quick and changing , is bad art , always ; naked men and women are the worst art of all , because there are fewer semi - dead things about them . The shell of the tortoise , the plumage of a bird , makes these animals approach nearer to art . Soft , quivering and quick flesh is as far from art as an object can be . ”
114207	114216	113248	113248	her	1867	“ Art is merely the dead , then ? ”
114217	114275	113248	113248	her	1867	“ No , but deadness is the first condition of art . A hippopotamus ’s armoured hide , a turtle ’s shell , feathers or machinery on the one hand ; that opposed to naked pulsing and moving of the soft inside of life , along with infinite elasticity and consciousness of movement , on the other . “
114280	114285	113248	113248	her	1867	” Tarr went on , “
114397	114420	114440	114441	human beings	1879	” Tarr was developing , from her point of view , too much shop . She encouraged him , however , immediately . “
114431	114432	114440	114441	human beings	1879	” “
114459	114534	114440	114441	human beings	1879	” They had waded through a good deal of food while this conversation had been proceeding . She now stretched herself , clasping her hands in her lap . She smiled at Tarr as though to invite him to smile too , at her beautiful , heavy , hysterical anatomy . She had been driving hard inscrutable Art deeper and deeper into herself . She now drew it out and showed it to Tarr . “
114585	114626	114580	114580	you	1882	” Tarr was staring , suspended , with a smile cut in half , therefore defunct , at the wall . He turned his head slowly , with his mutilated smile , his glasses slanting in an agreeably vulpine way . “
114667	114676	114645	114645	you	1882	” Anastasya ordered a gateau reine de Samothrace . “
114685	114689	114645	114645	you	1882	” Tarr muttered . “
114698	114976	114645	114645	you	1882	” Tarr looked at her for some time in a steady , depressed way . What a treat for his eyes not to be jibing ! She held all the imagery of a perfect world . There was no pathos anywhere in her form . Kindness — bestial kindness — would be an out - of - work in this neighbourhood . The upper part of her head was massive and intelligent . The middle of her body was massive and exciting . There was no animalism out of place in the shape of a weight of jaw . The weight was in the head and hips . But was not this a complete thing by itself ? How did he stand as regards it ? He had always been sceptical about perfection . Did she and he need each other ? His steadfast ideas of the flower surrounded by dung were challenged . She might be a monotonous abstraction , and , if accepted , impoverish his life . She was the summit , and the summit was narrow . Or in any case was not ugliness and foolishness the richest soil ? Irritants were useful though not beautiful . He reached back doubtfully towards his bourgeoise . But he was revolted as he touched that mess , with this clean and solid object beneath his eyes . He was not convinced , though , that he was on the right road . He preferred a cabin to a palace , and thought that a villa was better for him than either , but did not want to order his life so rigidly as that . - “
114986	114991	114979	114979	you	1884	” she asked him . “
114999	115000	114996	114996	you	1884	” “

115068	115093	115061	115061	You	1884	” She put her tongue out at him and wrinkled up her nose . A queen , standing on her throne , was obtruding her “
115097	115099	115054	115054	Bertha	177	” _ “
115113	115138	115102	115102	Kreisler	190	” he asked blankly . Her extreme freedom with himself suggested possible explanations of her manner in discussing Soltyk ’s death at the time . “

115898	115921	115939	115939	You	1912	” Anastasya ’s eyes were bloodshot with the gulp she had taken to honour Waste . Tarr patted her on the back . “
115930	115938	115939	115939	You	1912	” she hiccuped , patting her chest . “
115945	116134	115939	115939	You	1912	” They got to their coffee more or less decorously . But Tarr had grown extremely loquacious and expansive in every way . He began slapping her ' thighs to emphasise his points , as Diderot was in the habit of doing with the Princesse de Clèves . After that he began kissing her , when he had made a particularly successful remark , to celebrate it . Their second bottle of wine had put many things to flight . He lay back in his chair in prolonged bursts of laughter . She , in German fashion , clapped her hand over his mouth , and he seized it with his teeth and made pale shell - shapes in its brown fat . In a café opposite the restaurant , where they next went , they had further drinks . They caressed each other ’s hands now as a matter of course ! Indifferent to the supercilious and bitter natives , they became lost in lengthy kisses , their arms round each other ’s necks . In a little cave of intoxicated affection , a conversation took place . “

117302	117307	117289	117291	This tall nudity	1948	“ Close the door ! ”
117311	117346	117289	117291	This tall nudity	1948	“ there ’s a draught . You took a long time to consider my words . I ’ve been waiting . Forgive me , Tarr . My words were acidulated whores , but my heart ”
117360	117392	117348	117348	she	1949	“ my heart was completely full of sugar ! The acidulated demi - mondaine was a trick . It occupied your mind . You did n’t notice me take your key ! ”
117495	117513	117480	117480	Anastasya	216	“ Will you engage me as your model ? Je fais de la reclame pour les Grecs . ”
117514	117537	117572	117572	He	122	“ You are very Ionian — hardly Greek . But I do n’t require a model . I never use nude models . ”
117538	117549	117550	117550	She	1949	“ Well , I must dress again , I suppose . ”
117575	117582	117572	117572	He	122	“ I accept , I accept ! ”
117618	117634	117583	117583	He	122	“ Tarr , be my love . I do n’t want to give you up . ”
117661	117724	117583	117583	He	122	“ You wo n’t hear marriage talked about by me . I want to rescue you from your Bertha habits . Allow yourself to be rescued ! We ’re very well together , are n’t we ? I ’m not doing Bertha a bad turn , either , really . I admit my motive is quite selfish . What do you say ? ”
117725	117731	117732	117732	Anastasya	216	“ I am your slave ! ”
117744	117762	117732	117732	Anastasya	216	“ Thank you , Tarr . That ’s better than having a slave , is n’t it ? ”
117763	117773	117583	117583	He	122	“ Yes , I think everything is in order . ”
117774	117782	117583	117583	He	122	“ Then you ’re my efficient chimpanzee ? ”
117783	117813	117732	117732	Anastasya	216	“ No , I ’m the new animal ; we have n’t found a name for it yet . It will succeed the Superman . Back to the Earth ! ”
117814	117823	117583	117583	He	122	“ Jean - Jacques Rousseau . Kiss me ! ”
118147	118153	118154	118154	she	177	“ Come in , Sorbert , ”
118227	118229	118226	118226	Her	177	“ reserve ”
118630	118640	118617	118617	she	177	“ You see , he is faithful to me ! ”
118814	118819	118797	118797	she	177	“ Sorbert , Sorbert ! ”
118864	118871	118855	118855	Her	177	“ What is it , Bertha ? ”
118872	118878	118881	118881	She	177	“ I do n’t know ! ”
118906	118910	118911	118911	he	1962	“ Anything new ? ”
118914	118920	118921	118921	She	177	“ Anything new ? Yes ! ”
118948	118958	118930	118930	He	1962	“ Well , I have something new as well ! ”
118959	118965	118930	118930	He	1962	“ Have you , Sorbert ? ”
118966	118987	118921	118921	She	177	“ First of all , how have my visits struck you lately ? What explanation have you found for them ? ”
118988	119003	118930	118930	He	1962	“ Oh , none . Why find an explanation ? Why do you ask ? ”
119004	119011	118930	118930	He	1962	“ I thought I would explain . ”
119012	119015	118930	118930	He	1962	“ Well ? ”
119016	119060	119061	119061	She	1973	“ My explanation to myself was that I did not want to leave you brusquely , and I thought a blurred interlude of this sort would do no harm to either of us . Our loves could die in each other ’s arms . ”
119086	119121	119070	119070	her	1973	“ The real reason was simply that , being very fond of you , I could not make up my mind to give you up . I claim that my visits were not frivolous . ”
119122	119125	118930	118930	He	1962	“ Well ? ”
119126	119140	118930	118930	He	1962	“ I would have married you , if you had considered that advisable . ”
119141	119146	119070	119070	her	1973	“ Yes ? And--- ? ”
119147	119158	118930	118930	He	1962	“ I find it very difficult to say the rest . ”
119159	119164	118930	118930	He	1962	“ What is difficult ? ”
119165	119197	119198	119198	Bertha	177	“ Well , I still like you very much . Yesterday I met a woman . I love her too . I ca n’t help that . What must I do ? ”
119205	119210	119198	119198	Bertha	177	“ Who is she ? ”
119211	119221	118930	118930	He	1962	“ You know her . She is Anastasya Vasek . ”
119257	119269	119242	119242	It	1974	“ You did not — find out what my news was . ”
119270	119279	119242	119242	It	1974	“ I did n’t . Have you anything---- ? ”
119280	119287	119288	119288	He	1975	“ Yes . I am enceinte . ”
119352	119358	119348	119348	He	1975	“ Whose child is it ? ”
119359	119363	119373	119373	He	1975	“ Kreisler ’s . ”
119364	119369	119370	119370	he	1975	“ There you are ! ”
119390	119427	119373	119373	He	1975	“ Poor little girl ! That ’s a bad business . But do n’t worry about it . We can get married and it can always pass as mine — if we do it quickly enough . ”
119630	119639	119640	119640	he	1975	“ Ha ha ! Ha ha ! Kreisleriana ! ”
119658	119674	119675	119675	They	1983	“ Ha ha ! Ha ha ! Sacré farceur , where are you leading us ? ”
119679	119710	119675	119675	They	1983	“ You have kept us fooling in this neighbourhood so long , and now you are pledging us to your idiotic fancy for ever . Ha ha ! Ha ha ! ”
119711	119731	119732	119733	A faction	1984	“ Be reasonable ! What are you doing , master of our destiny ? We shall all be lost ! ”
119736	119739	119732	119733	A faction	1984	“ Anastasya ! ”
119829	119832	119838	119838	He	1975	“ Anastasya ! ”
119842	120004	120005	120005	He	1987	“ Anastasya ! Anastasya ! ! I know all about that ! What do you take me for ? You will still have your Anastasya . I am not selling myself or you . A man such as I does not dispose of himself in a case like this . I am going to marry Bertha Lunken . Well ? Shall I be any the less my own master for that reason ? If I want to sleep with Anastasya , I shall do so . Why marry Bertha Lunken , and shoulder all that semi - contagious muck ? Because it is only the points or movements in life that matter , and one of those points indicates that course , namely , to keep faith with another person : and secretly to show my contempt for the world by choosing the premier venu to be my body - servant and body companion ; my contempt for my body too . ”
120893	120899	120900	120900	she	2139	“ And what of Bertha ? ”
120904	120910	120900	120900	she	2139	“ Never mind about Bertha . ”
120911	120916	120876	120876	He	1987	“ Is she extinct ? ”
120917	120929	120900	120900	she	2139	“ No . She threatens an entirely new sort of eruption . ”
120930	120938	120900	120900	she	2139	“ Oh . In what way new--- ? ”
120939	120952	120876	120876	He	1987	“ It does n’t matter . It wo n’t come our way . ”
120953	120962	120900	120900	she	2139	“ Are you going there to - morrow ? ”
120963	120978	120900	120900	she	2139	“ I suppose I must . But I shall not make many more visits of---- ”
120979	120984	120876	120876	He	1987	“ What ’s that ? ”
120985	120995	120996	120996	He	1987	“ I shall give up going , I say . ”
121244	121246	121256	121256	Anastasya	216	“ correctness ”
121485	121496	121480	121480	She	177	“ I am afraid , Sorbert , I have been selfish---- ”
121497	121511	121512	121512	He	122	“ You — selfish ? How ’s that ? Do n’t talk nonsense . ”
121543	121550	121526	121526	She	177	“ You are very unhappy , Sorbert--- ”
121555	121617	121551	121551	He	122	“ No , I ’m all right . Do n’t worry about me . I ’m a little meditative . That is only natural on such a solemn occasion . I was thinking , Bertha , we must set up house somewhere , and announce our marriage . We must do this for appearance ’ sake . You will soon be incapacitated---- ”
121618	121628	121531	121531	her	177	“ Oh , I sha n’t be just yet . ”
121629	121680	121551	121551	He	122	“ In any case , we have gone through this form because---- We must make this move efficacious . What are your ideas as to an establishment V Let us take a flat together somewhere round here . The Rue Servandoni is a nice street . Do you know it ? ”
121681	121684	121685	121685	She	2028	“ No . ”
121698	121704	121687	121687	her	2028	“ Near the Luxembourg Museum . ”
121715	121726	121711	121711	He	2030	“ It ’s rather chilly . Let ’s get back . ”
121761	121764	121788	121788	he	2030	“ establishment , ”
121796	121829	121788	121788	he	2030	“ You remember what I said to you some weeks ago — about Anastasya Vasek . I am afraid there has been no change in that . You do not mind that ? ”
121830	121840	121788	121788	he	2030	“ No , Sorbert . You are perfectly free . ”
121841	121867	121788	121788	he	2030	“ I am afraid I shall seem unkind . This is not a nice marriage for you . Perhaps I was wrong to suggest it ? ”
121868	121879	121788	121788	he	2030	“ How , wrong ? I have not been complaining . ”
121887	121911	121788	121788	he	2030	“ Well , I ’d better not come up now . I will come along to - morrow — at the usual time . ”
121912	121922	121788	121788	he	2030	“ Good - bye , Sorbert . A demain ! ”
121923	121927	121788	121788	he	2030	“ A demain ! ”
121964	121972	121973	121973	he	2031	“ I saw Bertha to - day , ”
121982	121989	121973	121973	he	2031	“ You still see her then . ”
121990	121999	121973	121973	he	2031	“ Yes . I married her this afternoon . ”
122000	122009	121973	121973	he	2031	“ You what ? What do you mean ? ”
122011	122023	121973	121973	he	2031	“ What I say , my dear . I married her . ”
122024	122029	121973	121973	he	2031	“ You mean you-- ’ ”
122039	122049	122030	122030	She	2032	“ Yes . I married her at the Mairie . ”
122069	122079	122058	122058	he	2031	“ You mean to say you ’ve done that ' ”
122080	122086	122030	122030	She	2032	“ Yes ; I have . ”
122088	122091	122058	122058	he	2031	“ Why ? ”
122097	122109	122058	122058	he	2031	“ Well , the alleged reason was that she is enceinte . ”
122110	122118	122030	122030	She	2032	“ But — whose is the child ? ”
122119	122126	122058	122058	he	2031	“ Kreisler ’s , she says . ”
122197	122259	122192	122192	he	2031	“ Things are exactly the same as before . I was bound to do that . I had allowed her to consider herself engaged a year ago , and had to keep to that . I have merely gone back a year into the past and fulfilled a pledge , and now return to you . All is in perfect order . ”
122260	122279	122192	122192	he	2031	“ All is not in perfect order . It is Kreisler ’s child to begin with , you say---- ”
122280	122302	122192	122192	he	2031	“ Yes , but it would be very mean to use that fact to justify one in escaping from an obligation . ”
122303	122308	122192	122192	he	2031	“ That is sentimentality . ”
122309	122454	122192	122192	he	2031	“ Sentimentality ! Sentimentality ! Can not we , you and I , afford to give Bertha that‘I Sentimentality ! What an absurd word that is with its fierce use in our poor modern hands ! What does it mean ? Has life become such an affair of economic calculation that men are too timid to allow themselves any complicated pleasures ? Where there is abundance you can afford waste . Sentimentality is a cry on a level with the Simple Life ! The ideal of perfect success is an ideal belonging to the same sort of individual as the inventor of Equal Rights of Man and Perfectibility . Sentimentality is a privilege . It is a luxury that the crowd does not feel itself equal to , once it begins to think about it . Besides , it is different in different hands . ”
122455	122478	122192	122192	he	2031	“ That may be true as regards sentimentality in general . But in this case you have been guilty of a popular softness---- ”
122479	122538	122192	122192	he	2031	“ No . Listen . I will explain something to you . You said a moment ago that it was Kreisler ’s child . Well , that is my security ! That enables me to commit this folly , without too great danger . It is an earnest of the altruistic origin of the action not being forgotten ! ”
122539	122556	122192	122192	he	2031	“ But that — to return to your words — is surely a very mean calculation ? ”
122557	122572	122192	122192	he	2031	“ Therefore it takes the softness out of the generous action it is allied to----- ”
122573	122607	122192	122192	he	2031	“ No . It takes its raison d’etre away altogether . It leaves it merely a stupid and unnecessary fact . It cancels the generosity , but leaves the fact — your marriage . ”
122608	122618	122192	122192	he	2031	“ But the fact itself is altered by that ! ”
122619	122630	122192	122192	he	2031	“ In what way ? You are now married to Bertha---- ”
122631	122658	122192	122192	he	2031	“ Yes , but what does that mean ? I married Bertha this afternoon , and here I am punctually and as usual with you this evening---- ”
122659	122770	122192	122192	he	2031	“ But the fact of your having married Bertha this afternoon will prevent your making any one else your wife in the future . Supposing I had a child by you — not by Kreisler — it would be impossible to legitimatize him . The thing is of no importance in itself . But you have given Kreisler ’s child what you should have kept for your own ! What ’s the good of giving your sex over into the hands of a swanky expert , as you describe it , if you continue to act on your own initiative ? I throw up my job . Garçon , l'addition ! ”
122989	122993	123003	123004	Rose Fawcett	363	“ perfect woman . ”
