829	1667	824	824	his	129	' punishment , and entered into a little spot of land entirely his own . Then , with the assistance of his son , a strong , full - grown young man , he rebuilt the cottage , though upon a scale not much larger or much more commodious than his wife 's old hut . Like other groups of mountains , the highest and largest are those near the centre , and from them the land descends in lower and lower levels , with smaller hills and smoother valleys , until at length it sinks into the plain . Then they are almost like children 's hills and valleys ; the slopes are not too steep for very little feet to climb , and the rippling brooks are not in so much hurry to rush on to the distant river , but that boys and girls at play can stop them for a little time with slight banks of mud and stones . In just such a smooth , sloping dell , down in a soft green basin , called Fern 's Hollow , was the hiding - place where the convict 's sad wife had found an unmolested shelter . This dwelling , the second one raised by the returned convict and his son , is built just below the brow of the hill , so that the back of the hut is formed of the hill itself , and only the sides and front are real walls . These walls are made of rubble , or loose , unhewn stones , piled together with a kind of mortar , which is little more than clay baked hard in the heat of the sun . The chimney is a bit of old stove - pipe , scarcely rising above the top of the hill behind ; and , but for the smoke , we could look down the pipe , as through the tube of a telescope , upon the family sitting round the hearth within . The thatch , overgrown with moss , appears as a continuation of the slope of the hill itself , and might almost deceive the simple sheep grazing around it . Instead of a window there is only a square hole , covered by a shutter when the light is not urgently needed ; and the door is so much too small for its sill and lintels as to leave large chinks , through which adventurous bees and beetles may find their way within . You may see at a glance that there is but one room , and that there can be no up - stairs to the hut , except that upper storey of the broad , open common behind it , where the birds sleep softly in their cosy nests . Before the house is a garden ; and beyond that a small field sown with silver oats , which are dancing and glistening in the breeze and sunshine ; while before the garden wicket , but not enclosed from the common , is a warm , sunny valley , in the very middle of which a slender thread of a brook widens into a lovely little basin of a pool , clear and cold , the very place for the hill ponies to come and drink . Looking steadily up this pleasant valley from the threshold of the cottage , we can just see a fine , light film of white smoke against the blue sky . Two miles away , right down off the mountains , there is a small coal - field and a quarry of limestone . In a distant part of the country there are large tracts of land where coal and iron pits are sunk on every side , and their desolate and barren pit - banks extend for miles round , while a heavy cloud of smoke hangs always in the air . But here , just at the foot of these mountains , there is one little seam of coal , as if placed for the express use of these people , living so far away from the larger coal - fields . The Botfield lime and coal works cover only a few acres of the surface ; but underground there are long passages bored beneath the pleasant pastures and the yellow cornfields . From the mountains , Botfield looks rather like a great blot upon the fair landscape , with its blackened engine - house and banks of coal - dust , its long range of limekilns , sultry and quivering in the summer sunshine , and its heavy , groaning water - wheel , which pumps up the water from the pits below . But the colliers do not think it so , nor their wives in the scattered village beyond ; they do not consider the lime and coal works a blot , for their living depends upon them , and they may rightly say , '
1690	2096	2097	2099	Poor little Nan	21	' Even Stephen Fern , who would a thousand times rather work out on the free hillside than in the dark passages underground , does not think it a pity that the Botfield pit has been discovered at the foot of the mountains . It is nearly seven o'clock in the evening , and he is coming over the brow of the green dell , with his long shadow stretching down it . A very long shadow it is for so small a figure to cast , for if we wait a minute or two till Stephen draws nearer , we shall see that he is no strong , large man , but a slight , thin , stooping boy , bending rather wearily under a sack of coals , which he is carrying on his shoulders , and pausing now and then to wipe his heated forehead with the sleeve of his collier 's flannel jacket . When he lifts up the latch of his home we will enter with him , and see the inside of the hut at Fern 's Hollow . Stephen stepped over the threshold into a low , dark room , which was filled with smoke , from a sudden gust of the wind as it swept over the roof of the hut . On one side of the grate , which was made of some half - hoops of iron fastened into the rock , there was a very aged man , childish and blind with years , who was crouching towards the fire , and talking and chuckling to himself . A girl , about a year older than Stephen , sat in a rocking - chair , and swung to and fro as she knitted away fast and diligently at a thick grey stocking . In the corner nearest to the fireplace there stood a pallet - bed , hardly raised above the earthen floor , to which Stephen hastened immediately , with an anxious look at the thin , white face of his father lying upon the pillow . Beside the sick man there lay a little child fast asleep , with her hand clasping one of her father 's fingers ; and though James Fern was shaking and trembling with a violent fit of coughing from the sudden gust of smoke , he took care not to loose the hold of those tiny fingers . '
2101	2114	2097	2099	Poor little Nan	21	' he whispered to Stephen , as soon as he could speak . '
2130	2136	2097	2099	Poor little Nan	21	'm nigh heart - broken . '
2137	2145	2147	2147	Stephen	19	' Do you feel worse , father ? '
2150	2152	2147	2147	Stephen	19	' I 'm
2158	2181	2147	2147	Stephen	19	' answered James Fern,â€”'nearer the end every hour ; and I do n't know for certain what the end will be . I 'm
2268	2269	2270	2270	Father	1396	' '
2272	2283	2284	2284	I	0	' said Stephen , in a quiet and firm voice , '
2285	2341	2270	2270	Father	1396	'm getting six shillings a week wages , and we can live on very little . We have n't got any rent to pay , and only ourselves and grandfather to keep , and Martha is as good as a woman grown . We 'll manage , father , and take care of little Nan . '
2342	2352	2354	2354	Martha	22	' Stephen and I are not bad , father , '
2360	2430	2354	2354	Martha	22	' I am not like Black Bess of Botfield . Mother always told me I was to do my duty ; and I always do it . I can wash , and sew , and iron , and bake , and knit . Why , often and often we 've had no more than Stephen 's earnings , when you 've been to the Red Lion on reckoning nights . '
2431	2438	2440	2440	Stephen	19	' Hush , hush , Martha ! '
2442	2449	2451	2453	the dying father	137	' No , it 's true , '
2455	2492	2451	2453	the dying father	137	' God Almighty , have mercy on me ! Stephen , hearken to me , and thee too , Martha , while I tell you about this place , and what you are to do when I 'm
2495	2517	2451	2453	the dying father	137	' He paused for a minute or two , looking earnestly at the crouching old man in the chimney - corner . '
2523	2527	2529	2529	he	27	' he said , '
2580	2581	2582	2582	Father	28	' '
2584	2680	2582	2582	Father	28	' cried Stephen , in a tone of deep distress ; and he turned quickly to the old man , remembering how often he had sat upon his knees by the winter fire , and how many summer days he had rambled with him over the uplands after the sheep . His grandfather had been far kinder to him than his own father ; and his heart swelled with anger as he went and laid his arm round the bending neck of the old man , who looked up in his face and laughed heartily . '
2690	2695	2684	2684	Stephen	19	' gasped James Fern . '
2954	2985	2940	2940	She	145	' James Fern was silent again for some minutes , leaning back upon his pillow , with his eyes closed , and his thoughts gone back to the old times . '
3006	3016	3017	3017	she	145	' he continued , in a tone of regret ; '
3161	3162	3159	3159	Stephen	19	' '
3172	3181	3182	3182	Stephen	19	' said Stephen , in his steady voice . '
3184	3189	3182	3182	Stephen	19	' continued his father , '
3316	3530	3311	3311	thee	181	' Stephen carried his basin of potatoes to the door - sill and sat there , with his back turned to the dismal hut and his dying father , and his face looking out upon the green hills . He had always been a grave and thoughtful boy ; and he had much to think of now . The deep sense of new duties and obligations that had come upon him with his father 's words , made him feel that his boyhood had passed away . He looked round upon the garden , and the field , and the hut , with the keen eye of an owner ; and he wondered at the neglected state into which they had fallen since his father 's illness . There could be no more play - time for him ; no bird's - nesting among the gorse - bushes ; no rabbit - bunting with Snip , the little white terrier that was sharing his supper . If little Nan and his grandfather were to be provided for , he must be a man , with a man 's thoughtfulness , doing man 's work . There seemed enough work for him to do in the field and garden alone , without his twelve hours '
3644	3652	3654	3654	Martha	22	' I mean to be like grandmother , '
3675	3753	3654	3654	Martha	22	' I shall fence the green in , and have lambs and sheep to turn out on the hillside , and I 'll rear young goslings and ducks for market ; and we 'll have a brick house , with two rooms in it , as well as a shed for the coal . And nobody shall put upon us , or touch our rights , Stephen , or they shall have the length of my tongue . '
3754	3757	3759	3759	Stephen	19	' Martha , '
3762	3791	3759	3759	Stephen	19	' do you see how a shower is raining down on the master 's fields at Botfield ; and they 've been scorched up for want of water ? '
3792	3797	3799	3799	Martha	22	' Yes , surely , '
3801	3807	3799	3799	Martha	22	' and what of that ? '
3808	3810	3759	3759	Stephen	19	' I 'm
3813	3820	3759	3759	Stephen	19	' continued Stephen , rather shyly , '
3864	3865	3862	3862	Martha	22	' '
3877	3881	3866	3866	He	19	' replied Martha . '
3895	3899	3884	3884	God	26	' Stephen said , '
3922	3923	3924	3924	I	0	' '
3928	3938	3939	3939	I	0	' said Martha , but in a softer tone , '
3971	3972	3973	3973	I	0	' '
3978	3982	3973	3973	I	0	' replied Stephen ; '
4010	4266	3999	3999	I	0	' Martha went back to her rocking - chair and knitting , while Stephen reached down from a shelf an old Bible , covered with green baize , and , having carefully looked that his hard hands were quite clean , he opened it with the greatest reverence . James Fern had only begun to teach the boy to read a few months before , when he felt the first fatal symptoms of his illness ; and Stephen , with his few opportunities for learning , had only mastered one chapter , the fifth chapter of St. Matthew 's Gospel , which his father had chosen for him to begin with . The sick man lay still with closed eyes , but listening attentively to every word , and correcting his son whenever he made any mistake . When it was finished , James Fern read a few verses aloud himself , with low voice and frequent pauses to regain his strength ; and very soon afterwards the whole family were in a deep sleep , except himself . James Fern did not live many more days , and he was buried the Sunday following his death . All the colliers and pitmen from Botfield walked with the funeral of their old comrade and made a great burial of it . The parish church was two miles on the other side of Botfield , and four miles from Fern 's Hollow ; so James Fern and his family had never , as he called it , '
4268	4496	4497	4498	Our Father	199	' the church with their attendance . All the household , even to little Nan , went with their father 's corpse , to bury it in the strange and distant churchyard . Stephen felt as if he was in some long and painful dream , as he sat in the cart , with his feet resting upon his father 's coffin , with his grandfather on a chair at the head , nodding and laughing at every jolt on the rough road , and Martha holding a handkerchief up to her face , and carrying a large umbrella over herself and little Nan , to keep the dust off their new black bonnets . The boy , grave as he was , could hardly think ; he felt in too great a maze for that . The church , too , which he had never entered before , seemed grand and cold and immense , with its lofty arches , and a roof so high that it made him giddy to look up to it . Now and then he heard a few sentences of the burial service sounding out grandly in the clergyman 's strange , deep voice ; but they were not words he was familiar with , and he could not understand their meaning . At the open grave only , the clergyman said '
4500	4535	4497	4498	Our Father	199	' which his father had taught him during his illness ; and while his tears rolled down his cheeks for the first time that day , Stephen repeated over and over again to himself , '
4542	4608	3999	3999	I	0	' Stephen would have liked to stay in the church for the evening service , for which the bells were already ringing ; but this did not at all suit the tastes of his father 's old comrades . They made haste to crowd into a public - house , where they sat and drank , and forced Stephen to drink too , in order to '
4613	4975	3999	3999	I	0	' It was still a painful dream to him ; and more and more , as the long hours passed on , he wondered how he came there , and what all the people about him were doing . It was quite dark before they started homewards , and the poor old grandfather was no longer able to sit up in his chair , but lay helplessly at the bottom of the cart . Even Martha was fast asleep , and leaned her head upon Stephen 's shoulder , without any regard for her new black bonnet . The cart was now crowded with as many of the people as could get into it , who sang and shouted along the quiet Sunday road ; and , as they insisted upon stopping at every public - house they came to , it was very late before they reached the lane leading up to Fern 's Hollow . The grandfather was half dragged and half carried along by two of the men , followed by Stephen bearing sleepy little Nan in his arms , and by Martha , who had wakened up in a temper between crying and scolding . The long , strange , painful dream of father 's funeral was not over yet , and Stephen was still trying to think in a stupid , drowsy fashion , when he fell heavily asleep on the bed beside his grandfather . He awoke by habit very early in the morning , and aroused himself with a great effort against dropping asleep again . He could realize and understand his position better now . Father was dead ; and there was no one to earn bread for them all but himself . At this thought he sprang up instantly , though his head was aching in a manner he had never felt before . With some difficulty he awoke Martha to get his breakfast and put up his dinner in a basket which he carried with him to the pit . She also complained bitterly of her head aching , and moved about with a listlessness very different to her usual activity . '
4985	4991	4992	4992	they	202	' said Stephen to himself ; '
5029	5271	5272	5272	Hillo	32	' This thought reminded Stephen that he had promised his father to read his chapter every day of his life till he knew how to read more ; and , carrying the old Bible to his favourite seat on the door - sill , a very pleasant place in the cool , fresh summer morning , he read the verses aloud , slowly and carefully , rather repeating than reading them , for he knew his chapter better by heart than by the printed letters in the book . Thank God , Stephen Fern did begin to know it by heart ! It was not a bad day in the pit . All the colliers , men and boys , were more gentle than usual with the fatherless lad ; and even Black Thompson , his master since his father 's illness , who was in general a fierce bully to everybody about him , spoke as mildly as he could to Stephen . Yet all the day Stephen longed for his release in the evening , thinking how much work there wanted doing in the garden , and how he and Martha must be busy in it till nightfall . The clanking of the chain which drew him up to the light of day sounded like music to him ; but little did he guess that an enemy was lying in wait for him at the mouth of the pit . '
5274	5288	5291	5291	you	32	' cried a voice down the shaft as they were nearing the top ; '
5300	5305	5291	5291	you	32	' coals one mile . '
5403	5414	5415	5415	he	33	' Thee has got to carry these coals , Steve , '
5424	5429	5431	5431	Stephen	19	' I wo n't , '
5433	5437	5439	5439	Tim	33	' Thee shalt , '
5445	5450	5451	5451	Stephen	19	' I wo n't , '
5455	5463	5465	5465	Tim	33	' Then we 'll fight for it , '
5587	5598	5599	5599	he	19	' I wish I knew what I ought to do , '
5610	5617	5619	5620	Black Thompson	31	' Ay , ay , lad , '
5622	5653	5619	5620	Black Thompson	31	' it 's a shame to make thee fight , and thy father not cold in the graveyard yet . I say , Tim , what is it thee wants ? '
5654	5658	5660	5660	Tim	33	' These coals , '
5663	5695	5660	5660	Tim	33	' are to be carried to the New Farm ; and if Stevie Fern wo n't take them one mile , he must fight me afore he goes off this bank . '
5696	5709	5711	5712	Black Thompson	31	' Now , lads , I 'll judge between ye this time , '
5714	5767	5711	5712	Black Thompson	31	' Stevie shall carry them to the end of Red Lane , and cut across the hill home : that 's not much out of the way ; and if Tim makes him go one step farther , I 'll lick thee myself to - morrow , lad , I promise thee . '
5797	5808	5809	5809	he	19	' If I had only a commandment about these things ! '
5906	5912	5913	5913	he	19	' I say , Tim , '
5924	5947	5913	5913	he	19	' it 's four miles to the New Farm , and I 'll go with thee a mile farther than Red Lane . '
5948	5951	5953	5953	Tim	33	' Eh ! '
5955	5967	5953	5953	Tim	33	' and get Black Thompson to lick me to - morrow ? '
5968	5971	5973	5973	Stephen	19	' No , '
5976	6029	5973	5973	Stephen	19	' I 'll not tell Black Thompson ; and if he hears talk of it , I 'll say I did it of my own mind . Come thy ways , Tim ; let 's be sharp , for I 've my potatoes to hoe when I get home to - night . '
6088	6096	6097	6097	he	33	' I ca n't make it out , '
6100	6130	6097	6097	he	33	' What art thee up to , Stephen ? Tell me out plain , or I 'll fight thee here , if Black Thompson does lick me for it . '
6131	6141	6143	6143	Stephen	19	' Why , I 've been learning to read , '
6149	6171	6143	6143	Stephen	19	' and of course I know things I did n't used to know , and what thee does n't know now . '
6172	6182	6184	6184	Tim	33	' And what 's that to do with it ? '
6186	6207	6209	6209	Stephen	19	' My chapter says that if any man forces me to go one mile , I am to go two , '
6211	6221	6209	6209	Stephen	19	' it does n't say why exactly , but I 'm
6241	6242	6209	6209	Stephen	19	' '
6249	6257	6209	6209	Stephen	19	' said Tim , after a pause . '
6273	6274	6268	6268	his	221	' '
6277	6281	6268	6268	his	221	' Stephen answered ; '
6334	6335	6325	6325	I	0	' '
6342	6347	6336	6336	I	0	' said Tim uneasily , '
6410	6492	6387	6387	I	0	' Stephen thanked him , and accepted his offer heartily . The load was quickly transferred to Tim 's broad back , and the boys parted in more good - will than they had ever felt before ; Stephen strengthened by this favourable result in his resolution to put in practice all he knew of the Bible ; and Tim deep in thought , as was evident from his muttering every now and then on his way to the New Farm , '
6503	6740	6741	6742	Brother Thomas	35	' Little Nan would be waiting for him , as well as his supper , and Stephen forgot his weariness as he bounded along the soft turf , to the great discomfiture of the brown - faced sheep , quite as anxious for their supper as he was for his . Stephen heard far off Snip 's sharp , impatient bark , and it made him quicken his steps still more , until , coming within sight of his own Hollow , he stopped suddenly , and his heart beat even more vehemently than when he was running up the hillside . There was , however , nothing very terrible in the scene . The hut was safe , and the sun was shining brightly upon the garden , and little Nan was standing as usual at the wicket . Only in the oat - field , with their faces looking across the green , stood two men in close conversation . These men were both of them old , and rather thin and shrivelled in figure ; their features bore great resemblance to each other , the eyes being small and sunken , with many wrinkles round them , and both mouths much fallen in . You would have said at once they were brothers ; and if you drew near enough to hear their conversation , you would have found your guess was right . '
6744	6753	6741	6742	Brother Thomas	35	' said the thinnest and sharpest - looking , '
6840	6841	6850	6850	you	238	' '
6858	6864	6856	6856	James	20	' replied Thomas Wyley admiringly . '
6881	6882	6883	6883	I	0	' '
6893	6899	6883	6883	I	0	' said the other one : '
6948	6949	6943	6944	a pauper	244	' '
6959	7173	6943	6944	a pauper	244	' observed Thomas Wyley . The latter speaker , who was a degree pleasanter - looking than his brother , was the relieving officer of the large union to which Botfield belonged ; and , in consequence , all poor persons who had grown too old , or were in any way unable to work , were compelled to apply to him for the help which the laws of our country provide for such cases . James Wyley , the elder brother , was the owner of Botfield works , and the master of all the people employed in them , besides being the agent of the lord of the manor . So both these men possessed great authority over the poor ; and they used the power to oppress them and grind them down to the utmost . It was therefore no wonder that Stephen stopped instantly when he saw their well - known figures standing at the corner of his oat - field ; nor that he should come on slowly after he had recovered his courage , pondering in his own mind what they were come up to Fern 's Hollow for , and how he should answer them if they should want him to give up the old hut . '
7180	7205	6943	6944	a pauper	244	' said James Wyley , smiling a slow , reluctant smile , as Stephen drew near to them with his cap in his hand . '
7231	7232	7228	7229	James Fern	20	' '
7241	7246	7228	7229	James Fern	20	' added Thomas Wyley . '
7252	7272	7250	7250	master	251	' said Stephen , the tears starting to his eyes , so unexpected was this gentle greeting to him ; '
7281	7282	7273	7273	I	0	' '
7288	7293	7273	7273	I	0	' said Thomas Wyley , '
7384	7385	7386	7386	I	0	' '
7397	7406	7386	7386	I	0	' said the master , Mr. James Wyley ; '
7445	7446	7449	7449	sir	264	' '
7451	7455	7449	7449	sir	264	' answered Stephen , '
7522	7523	7512	7512	you	264	' '
7532	7537	7512	7512	you	264	' said Thomas Wyley ; '
7602	7603	7604	7604	Father	28	' '
7607	7611	7604	7604	Father	28	' replied Stephen , '
7687	7688	7690	7690	ye	283	' '
7695	7701	7690	7690	ye	283	' said the master impatiently . '
7738	7739	7740	7740	Father	28	' '
7743	7747	7740	7740	Father	28	' repeated Stephen , '
7782	7783	7773	7774	little Nan	34	' '
7792	7801	7790	7790	yours	283	' cried the master , in a rage ; '
7860	7861	7864	7864	sir	264	' '
7866	7871	7864	7864	sir	264	' said Stephen firmly , '
7879	7911	7864	7864	sir	264	'm never to part with it . I 'll never poach , and I 'll never trespass on the manor ; but I ca n't sell the old house , sir . '
7912	7923	7925	7926	Thomas Wyley	36	' Now , just listen to me , young Fern , '
7928	8030	7925	7926	Thomas Wyley	36	' you 'll be compelled to give up Fern 's Hollow in right of the lord of the manor ; and then if you come to the House for relief , mark my words , I 'll send your grandfather off to Bristol , for that 's his parish , and you 'll never see him again ; and I 'll give orders for you never to see little Nan ; and I 'll apprentice you and your other sister in different places . So you had better be reasonable , and take our advice while you can be made comfortable . '
8031	8044	8046	8046	Stephen	19	' Please , sir , I ca n't go against my promise , '
8052	8063	8065	8066	the master	179	' What 's the use of wasting one 's breath ? '
8068	8159	8065	8066	the master	179	' this place I want , and this place I 'll have ; and we 'll see if this young jail - bird will stand in my way . Ah , my fine fellow , it 's no such secret where your grandfather spent twenty - one years of his life ; and you 'll have a sup of the same broth some day . You do n't keep a dog like that yelping cur for nothing ; and I 'll tell the gamekeeper to have his eye upon you . '
8327	8339	8340	8340	she	22	' Well , I 'd have more spirit than to cry , '
8352	8395	8340	8340	she	22	' I 'd never have spoken so gingerly to them , the wizen - faced old rascals . The place is ours , and they ca n't turn us out . It 's no use to be cowed by them , Stephen . '
8396	8405	8407	8407	Stephen	19	' They can turn me off the works , '
8410	8418	8420	8420	Martha	22	' And whatever shall we do then ? '
8425	8440	8420	8420	Martha	22	' Still I reckon you 'll say we are to love those old wretches . '
8441	8447	8449	8449	Stephen	19	' The Book says so , '
8451	8467	8469	8469	Martha	22	' Well , I wo n't set up to try to do it for one , '
8472	8487	8469	8469	Martha	22	' it 's not nature ; it 's being over good by half . I 'm
8530	8531	8532	8532	I	0	' '
8538	8636	8532	8532	I	0	' he answered , walking gloomily towards the door . He felt so much passion and anger within him , that it did seem as if it would be a relief to utter some of the terrible oaths which he heard frequently in the pit , and which had been familiar enough in his own mouth a few months ago . But now other words , familiar from daily reading , the words that he had repeated to Tim so short a time before , were being whispered , as it seemed , close by his ear : '
8667	8776	8777	8777	Me	0	' There was a deadly conflict going on in the boy 's soul ; and Martha 's angry words were helping the tempter . He sat down despondently on the door - sill , and hid his face in his hands , while he listened to his sister 's taunts against his want of spirit , and her fears that he would give up their home for his new notions . He was about to answer her at last with the passion she was trying to provoke , when a soft little cheek was pressed against his downcast head , and little Nan lisped in her broken words , '
8794	8866	8782	8782	me	0	' The child knelt down before him , and laid her folded hands upon his knee , as she had done every evening since his father died , while he said the prayer , and she repeated it slowly after him . He felt as though he was praying for himself . A feeling of deep earnestness came over him ; and , though his voice faltered as he said softly , '
8881	8912	8782	8782	me	0	' it seemed as if there was a spirit in his heart agreeing to the words , and giving him power to say them . He did not know then that '
8928	8992	8782	8782	me	0	' but while he prayed with little Nan , he received great comfort and strength , though he was ignorant of the source from whence they came . When the child 's prayers were ended , he roused himself cheerfully to action ; and as long as the lingering twilight lasted , both Stephen and Martha were busily at work in the garden . '
9001	9025	8994	8994	thee	316	' said Tim when he came up the hill next evening , according to his promise , to help Stephen in his garden . '
9028	9032	9035	9035	Martha	22	'm the missis , '
9037	9055	9057	9057	she	22	' but I ca n't say how long it may be afore we have to pack off ; '
9089	9100	9074	9074	her	22	' And he never said a single curse at them ! '
9101	9110	9112	9112	Tim	33	' Not when they were out of hearing ? '
9114	9119	9121	9121	Stephen	19	' I could n't , '
9123	9181	9121	9121	Stephen	19	' I knew what I ought to do then , if I was n't quite sure about fighting thee , Tim . My chapter says , " Swear not at all ; " and " Let your communication be Yea , yea ; Nay , nay ; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil . " '
9182	9190	9192	9192	Tim	33	' What 's the meaning of that ? '
9199	9245	9121	9121	Stephen	19	' Father said it meant I was to stand to my word like a man , but not swear about it . If I said Ay , to mean ay ; and if I said No , to mean no , and stick to it . '
9246	9259	9261	9261	Tim	33	' There 'd be no room for telling lies , I reckon , '
9264	9269	9271	9271	Stephen	19	' Of course not , '
9273	9275	9271	9271	Stephen	19	' That '
9282	9292	9293	9293	I	0	' said Tim , nodding towards the distant village . '
9316	9338	9293	9293	I	0	' ud be prime . Only maybe the victuals would n't suit me . Last Sunday , afore thy father 's buryin '
9376	9377	9362	9362	Martha	22	' '
9380	9385	9362	9362	Martha	22	' answered Stephen shortly . '
9401	9538	9362	9362	Martha	22	' asked Tim , whose curiosity was aroused ; and Stephen , proud of his new accomplishment,â€”a rare one in those days among his own class,â€”would not lose the opportunity given him by Tim 's inquiry for the display of his learning . He brought out his Bible with alacrity , and read his chapter in a loud , clear , sing - song tone , while Tim overlooked him , with his red face growing redder , and his eyebrows arched in amazement ; and Martha , leaning against the door - post , glanced triumphantly at his wonder . Already , though his father had been dead only a week , Stephen began to miscall many of the harder words ; but his hearers were not critical , and the performance gave unbounded satisfaction . '
9543	9547	9362	9362	Martha	22	' cried Tim . '
9572	9573	9362	9362	Martha	22	' '
9579	9586	9362	9362	Martha	22	' answered Stephen , somewhat sadly ; '
9619	9677	9678	9679	My boys	328	' The conversation was stopped by Martha suddenly starting bolt upright , and dropping two or three hurried curtseys . The boys looked up from their book quickly , and saw a young lady passing through the wicket and coming up the garden walk , with a smile upon her pleasant face as she met their gaze . '
9681	9692	9678	9679	My boys	328	' she said , in a soft , kindly voice , '
9725	9726	9729	9729	him	331	' '
9731	9742	9729	9729	him	331	' cried Tim and Martha together , pointing at Stephen . '
9754	9759	9744	9744	you	328	' continued the lady . '
9773	9837	9767	9767	I	0	' Stephen looked up speechlessly into the smiling face before him . He had never read of the angels , and scarcely knew that there were such beings ; but he felt as if this fair and sweet - looking lady , with her gentle voice , and the kindly eyes meeting his own , was altogether of a different order to themselves . '
9845	9849	9838	9838	I	0	' she added , '
9878	9879	9863	9863	you	328	' '
9884	9908	9909	9909	he	36	' said Martha , who was not at all afraid of speaking to any lady , though she dare not face the master , '
9942	9943	9933	9933	he	36	' '
9950	9955	9945	9945	you	19	' said the lady ; '
10018	10123	10002	10002	you	19	' Then Stephen , with some hesitation , and a good deal of assistance from Martha , told the whole history of his grandmother 's settlement upon the solitary hillside , only withholding the fact of his grandfather 's transportation , because Tim was listening eagerly to every word . Miss Anne listened , too , with deep attention ; and once or twice the tears rose to her eyes as she heard of the weary labours and watchings of the desolate woman ; and when Stephen repeated his resolution to work hard and constantly for the maintenance of his grandfather and little Nan â€” '
10132	10147	10129	10129	your	344	' she said , reaching out her hand to him when he had finished , '
10186	10187	10188	10188	I	0	' '
10194	10199	10188	10188	I	0	' replied Stephen anxiously , '
10219	10220	10209	10209	I	0	' '
10232	10239	10209	10209	I	0	' said Miss Anne , smiling , '

10277	10281	10282	10282	my	0	' answered Stephen ; '

10344	10349	10338	10338	you	19	' said Miss Anne . '
10357	10361	10350	10350	I	0	' he answered ; '
10381	10382	10383	10383	He	0	' '
10394	10415	10383	10383	He	0	' said Tim , pulling the front lock of his red hair , as he spoke to the young lady . '
10430	10435	10422	10422	you	19	' asked Miss Anne . '
10440	10445	10422	10422	you	19	' exclaimed Stephen eagerly . '
10510	10531	10501	10501	I	0	' Miss Anne 's voice was very low and soft , like sweet music , as she read these verses : '
10584	10625	10580	10580	he	19	' Stephen listened breathlessly , and his face glowed with intense interest ; but he was not a boy of ready speech , and , before he could utter a word , Tim burst in before him with a question , '
10636	10640	10631	10631	Tim	33	' he asked . '
10643	10651	10652	10652	he	33	' answered Miss Anne , smiling again ; '
10665	10666	10652	10652	he	33	' '
10674	10682	10670	10670	me	0	' said Tim in a despondent tone . '
10695	10700	10670	10670	me	0	' continued Miss Anne . '
10751	10821	10749	10749	Stephen	19	' Down the same narrow green pathway trodden by the feet of Stephen 's angry master and his brother the evening before , they now watched the little light figure of the young lady , as she slowly vanished out of their sight . When the gleaming of her dress was quite lost , Stephen rubbed his eyes for a moment , and then turned to Martha and Tim . '
10831	10835	10836	10838	A real woman	365	' he asked . '
10840	10846	10849	10849	she	21	' repeated Martha rather scornfully ; '
10889	11136	10868	10868	Spirits	40	' At the entrance of the lane leading down to the works at Botfield there stood a small square building , which was used as the weighing - house for the coal and lime fetched from the pits , and as the pay - office on the reckoning Saturday , which came once a fortnight . Upon the Saturday evening after his interview with the master , Stephen loitered in the lane with a very heavy heart , afraid of facing Mr. Wyley , lest he should receive the sentence of dismission from the pit . He did not know what he could turn his hand to if he should be discharged from what had been his work since he was eight years old ; for even if he could get a place in one of the farmhouses about as waggoner 's boy , he would not earn more than three shillings a week ; and how very little that would do towards providing food for the three mouths at home ! Fearful of knowing the worst , he lingered about the office until all the other workmen had been in and come out again jingling their wages . But the master and his brother Thomas had been taking counsel together about the matter . Mr. Wyley was for turning the boy off at once , and reducing him to the utmost straits of poverty ; but his more prudent brother was opposed to this plan . '
11143	11147	10868	10868	Spirits	40	' he said ; '
11225	11329	11218	11221	a determined young fellow	377	'm mistaken . Better keep him at work under your own eye , and make the place too hot for him by degrees . Before long you will catch him poaching with his dog , and if he is let off for a time or two because of his youth , and goes at it again , we can make out a pretty case of juvenile depravity , without any character from his employer , you know ; and so he will be sent out of the way , and boarded at the expense of the country for a few years or so . '
11330	11333	11335	11336	the master	179	' Well , '
11338	11372	11335	11336	the master	179	' I 'll try him once again . If he 'd go out quietly , nobody else has any claim upon the cottage ; and I want to set to work there quickly . '
11467	11473	11466	11466	his	19	' Thank you , sir , '
11501	11513	11514	11514	he	190	' Have you thought any more of my offer , Fern ? '
11517	11561	11514	11514	he	190	' I should n't mind , as you are an orphan , and have two sisters depending upon you , if I made the ten pounds into fifteen ; and you may leave the money at interest with me till you are older . '
11562	11571	11573	11574	Thomas Wyley	36	' And I 've been thinking , Stephen , '
11586	11652	11573	11574	Thomas Wyley	36	' that , as you seem set against being separated , instead of taking your grandfather into the House , I 'd get him two shillings a week allowed him out of it ; and that would pay the rent of a nice two - roomed cottage down in Botfield , close to your work . Come , that would make all of you comfortable . '
11653	11662	11664	11665	the master	179	' You should bear in mind , Stephen , '
11667	11717	11664	11665	the master	179	' that the place does not of right belong to you at all ; and the lord of the manor is coming to shoot over the estate in September ; and then I shall have orders to remove you by force . So you had better take our offer . '
11718	11723	11725	11725	Stephen	19	' Please , sir , '
11730	11786	11725	11725	Stephen	19	' do n't be angered with me , but I ca n't go from what I said afore . Father told me never to give up Fern 's Hollow ; and maybe he 'd hear tell of it in heaven if I broke my word to him . I ca n't do it , sir . '
11787	11796	11798	11799	Mr. Thomas	36	' Well , wilful will have his way , '
12486	12490	12483	12483	she	21	' good evening , '
12506	12549	12501	12501	she	21	' I find it quite as hard work to serve God really and truly as you do , Stephen . There is only one Helper for both of us ; and we can only do all things through Christ which strengtheneth us . '
12888	12921	12877	12878	Miss Anne	21	' But He was wounded for our transgressions , He was bruised for our iniquities ; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him ; and with His stripes we are healed . '
13563	13569	13577	13577	he	19	' I say , Stephen , '
13597	13599	13577	13577	he	19	' I 'm
13655	13656	13645	13645	he	42	' '
13664	13669	13662	13662	William	43	' asked Stephen anxiously . '
13675	13684	13687	13687	lad	131	' said the man , with some reluctance . '
13722	14101	13716	13716	thee	19	' But it was no use shouting after Stephen , as he ran frantically up the hill . Snip was always basking lazily in the sunshine under the hedge of the paddock , at the very point where he could catch the first sight of his young master , after which there was no more idleness or stillness in him . Stephen could hardly breathe when he found that Snip was not at the usual place to greet him ; but before he reached his home he saw it â€” the dead body of his own poor Snip â€” hung on the post of the wicket through which he had to pass . He flew to the place ; he tore his own hands with the nails that were driven through Snip 's feet ; and then , without a thought of his grandfather or of his own hunger , he bore away the dead dog in his arms , and wandered far out of sight or sound of the hateful , cruel world , into one of the most solitary plains upon the uplands . Any one passing by might have thought that Stephen was fast asleep in the last slanting rays of the sun , which shone upon him there some time after the evening shadows had fallen upon Botfield ; but a frenzy of passion , too strong for any words , had felled him to the ground , where he lay beside Snip . The gamekeeper , who had so many dogs that he did not care for any one of them in particular , had killed this one creature that was dearer to him than anything in the world , except little Nan , and grandfather , and Martha . And Snip was dead , without remedy ; no power on earth could bring back the departed life . Oh , if he could only punish the villain who had shot his poor faithful dog ! But he was nothing but a poor boy , very poor , and very helpless and friendless , and people would only laugh at his trouble . All the world was against him , and he could do nothing to revenge himself , but to hate everybody ! '
14114	14125	14126	14126	Eh	477	' said Black Thompson 's voice , close behind him . '
14165	14229	14133	14133	Snip	29	' The boy rose , and faced Black Thompson and his comrade with eyes that were bloodshot , though he had not shed a tear , and with lips almost bitten through by his angry teeth . Both the men handled the dog gently and carefully , but , after a moment 's inspection , Thompson laid it down again on the turf . '
14235	14250	14133	14133	Snip	29	' he cried , with an oath that sounded pleasantly in Stephen 's ears ; '
14285	14286	14280	14280	I	0	' '
14289	14297	14301	14301	he	29	' said Stephen , with flashing eyes ; '
14335	14336	14325	14325	I	0	' '
14343	14348	14349	14349	he	480	' said Black Thompson ; '
14388	14389	14378	14378	his	29	' '
14391	14404	14406	14406	Stephen	19	're down in the leasowe , between the Firspinny and Ragleth Hill , '
14408	14411	14406	14406	Stephen	19	' and they 're
14468	14488	14465	14465	he	29	' â€” Stephen stopped , with quivering lips , for he could not speak yet of Snip 's murder . '
14496	14507	14465	14465	he	29	' said Black Thompson , clapping him on the back ; '
14587	14588	14574	14574	thee	29	' '
14594	14604	14592	14592	I	0	' answered Stephen , walking briskly beside Black Thompson ; '
14639	14640	14635	14635	I	0	' '
14647	14944	14641	14641	I	0	' said Black Thompson , glad to encourage the boy in his foolish boasting . On their way they passed near to Fern 's Hollow , and Stephen heard little Nan 's shrill voice calling his name , as if she were seeking him weariedly ; but when he hesitated for a moment , his heart yearning to answer her , Black Thompson again patted him on the back , and bade him never show the white feather , but remember poor dead Snip ; at which his passion for revenge returned , and he pressed on eagerly to the fir - coppice . It was quite dark when they entered the path leading through the wood . No one spoke now , and they trod cautiously , lest there should be any noise from their footsteps . The tall black fir - trees towered above them to an unusual height ; and through all the topmost branches there ran a low , mournful sound , as if every tree was whispering about them , and lamenting over them . Even the little brook , which in the sunshine rippled so merrily along the borders of the wood , seemed to be sobbing like a grieved and tired child in the night - time . Strange rustlings on every side , and sudden groanings of the withered boughs in some of the pines , made them start in fear ; and once , in a little opening among the trees , when the stars came out and looked down upon them , Stephen would have given all he had in the world to be safe at home , with little Nan singing hymns on his knee , or quietly asleep after the hot and busy day . '
14957	15075	15281	15281	Stephen	19	' whispered Davies , in a frightened tone . But before long they were out of the wood ; and in the glimmer of light that lasts all night through during the summer , Stephen saw Black Thompson unwind a net , which had been wrapped round his body under his collier 's jacket . More than half the covey of partridges were bagged ; and they had such capital luck , as the men called it , that Stephen soon entered into the daring spirit of the adventure . It sent a thrill of excitement through him , in which poor Snip was for the time forgotten ; and when about midnight Black Thompson and Davies said '
15079	15280	15281	15281	Stephen	19	' to him at his cottage door , calling him a brave fellow , and giving him a fine young leveret , with the promise that he should have his share of whatever money they received for their spoil , he entered his dark home , where every one was slumbering peacefully , and , without a thought of sorrow or repentance , was quickly asleep himself . Martha 's exclamation of surprise and delight at seeing the leveret was the first sound that Stephen heard in the morning ; but he preserved a sullen silence as to his absence the previous night , and Martha was too shrewd to press him with questions . They had not been unused to such fare during their father 's lifetime ; and it was settled between them that she should come down from the bilberry - plain early in the afternoon to make a feast of the leveret by the time of Stephen 's return from the pit . All day long Stephen found himself treated with marked distinction and favour by Black Thompson and his comrades , to some of whom he heard him say , in a loud whisper , that '
15282	15294	15297	15297	they	496	' ud show himself a chip of the old block yet . '
15685	15689	15691	15692	Miss Anne	21	' Good evening , '
15724	15744	15716	15716	himself	19	' Your supper smells very nice , Martha ; there has been some good cooking done to - day . '
15745	15751	15753	15753	Martha	22	' Oh , Miss Anne , '
15762	15790	15753	15753	Martha	22	' it is a young leveret Mrs. Jones , the gamekeeper 's wife , gave me for some knitting I 'd done for her ; she said it '
15824	15832	15886	15887	Miss Anne	21	' ud make me ever so proud . '
15833	15839	15841	15842	Miss Anne	21	' Thank you , Martha , '
15846	15881	15841	15842	Miss Anne	21	' I am quite hungry with climbing the hill , and if it is as good as the bread you gave me the other day , I shall enjoy having my supper with you . '
15985	15999	16000	16000	he	19	' Do n't touch it ! do n't taste it , Miss Anne ! '
16004	16035	16000	16000	he	19	' Oh , please to come out with me to the bent of the hill , and I 'll tell you why . But do n't eat any of it ! '
16168	16180	16158	16158	he	19	' Oh , Miss Anne , I could not bear it ! '
16181	16186	16187	16187	she	22	' Do you remember , '
16197	16232	16187	16187	she	22	' how poor Snip used to follow me down to this very spot , and sit here till I was out of sight ? I was very fond of poor old Snip , Stephen ! '
16306	16310	16312	16313	Miss Anne	21	' And now , '
16320	16410	16312	16313	Miss Anne	21	' I must tell you that , though I am not surprised , I am very , very grieved , Stephen . If you knew your Bible more , you would have read this verse in it , " God is faithful , who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able ; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape , that ye may be able to bear it . " Did no way of escape open to you , Stephen ? '
16455	16462	16464	16465	Miss Anne	21	' You do not know much , '
16467	16530	16464	16465	Miss Anne	21	' but if you had followed out all you do know , instead of poaching with Black Thompson that you might revenge yourself for Snip being killed , you would have been praying for them that persecute you . The Bible says that not a sparrow falls to the ground without our Father . So God knew that poor Snip was shot . '
16531	16540	16542	16542	Stephen	19	' But why did He not hinder it ? '
16549	16552	16554	16555	Miss Anne	21	' Stephen , '
16558	16692	16554	16555	Miss Anne	21	' suppose that I lived in a very grand palace , where there were many things that you had never seen , and I wanted little Nan to come and live with me , not as a servant , but as my dear child ; would it be unkind of me to send her first to a school , where she could learn how to read the books , and understand the pictures , and play the music she would find in my palace ? Even if the lessons were often hard , and some of her schoolfellows were cruel and unkind to her , would it not be better for her to bear it for a little while , until she was made ready to live with me as my own child ? '
16750	16838	16740	16740	she	1602	' Perhaps we could not understand any of the things of heaven , so our Father which is in heaven sends us to school here ; we are learning lessons all our life long . There is not a single trouble that comes to us but it is to teach us the meaning of something we shall meet with there . We should not be happy to hear the angels singing a song which we could not understand , because we had missed our lessons down here . '
16839	16845	16847	16847	Stephen	19	' Oh , Miss Anne , '
16849	16875	16847	16847	Stephen	19	' I feel as if I could bear anything when I think of that ! Only I wish I was as strong as an angel . '
16876	16883	16885	16886	Miss Anne	21	' Patience is better than strength , '
16899	16927	16893	16893	she	21	' patiently to bear the will of God , and patiently to keep His commandments , is greater and more glorious than the strength of an angel . '
16928	16941	16943	16943	Stephen	19	' Black Thompson was so kind to me all to - day , '
16947	16969	16943	16943	Stephen	19	' and now he 'll be ten times worse if I go back from telling him where the black game is . '
16970	16976	16978	16979	Miss Anne	21	' You must do right , '
16995	17008	16978	16979	Miss Anne	21	' and remember that " blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness '
17054	17227	17228	17229	Mr. Jones	42	' Stephen returned to the hut for a spade , and then went , with a strange blending of grief and gladness , to the place where he had left his poor dog . He chose a solitary yew tree on the hill for the burial ground , and dug as deep a grave as he could among the far - spreading roots . It was strange , only such things do happen now and then , that while he was working away hard and fast , with the dead dog lying by under the trunk of the yew tree , the gamekeeper himself passed that way . He had been in a terrible temper all day , for he had discovered the mischief done down in the fir - coppice , and the loss of his carefully - preserved covey . The sight of Stephen and dead Snip irritated him ; though a feeling of shame crept over him as he saw how tear - stained the boy 's face was . '
17231	17235	17228	17229	Mr. Jones	42	' said Stephen , '
17244	17245	17236	17236	I	0	' '
17251	17256	17236	17236	I	0	' replied the gamekeeper , '
17261	17277	17228	17229	Mr. Jones	42	're about . I 'll not take any impudence from a young rascal like you . '
17278	17284	17286	17286	Stephen	19	' It 's no impudence , '
17288	17306	17286	17286	Stephen	19	' only I know to some black game , and I wanted to tell you about them . '
17307	17311	17312	17312	he	19	' Black game ! '
17316	17331	17312	17312	he	19	' A likely story . There 's been none these half - dozen years . '
17332	17339	17341	17341	Stephen	19	' It 's four years since , '
17343	17392	17341	17341	Stephen	19	' I remember , because grandfather and I saw them the day mother died , when little Nan was born . I could n't forget them or mistake them after that . They are at the head of the Black Valley , where the quaking noise begins . I 'm
17395	17400	17341	17341	Stephen	19	'm right , sir . '
17401	17410	17412	17412	Jones	42	' You are not making game of me ? '
17421	17444	17417	17417	his	42	' Well , my lad , if this is true , it will be worth something to me . Hark ye , I 'm
17472	17473	17474	17474	I	0	' '
17485	17493	17474	17474	I	0	' replied Stephen in a choked voice ; '
17505	17506	17503	17503	sir	264	' '
17509	17522	17503	17503	sir	264	' said the gamekeeper , shouldering his gun , and walking off , '
17539	17906	17529	17530	young Fern	19	' Of course Stephen 's brief term of favour with Black Thompson was at an end ; but whether Miss Anne had given him a hint that the boy was under her protection , and had confessed all to her , or because he might be busy in some deeper scheme of wickedness , he did not display as much anger as Stephen expected , when he refused to show him the haunts of the grouse , or go with him again on a poaching expedition . Stephen was more humble and vigilant than he had been before falling into temptation . He set a close watch upon himself , lest he should be betrayed into a self - confident spirit again ; and Tim 's loud praises sounded less pleasantly in his ears , so that one evening he told him , with much shame , into what sin he had been led by his desire to avenge Snip 's murder . Unfortunately , this disclosure so much heightened Tim 's estimation of his character , that from time to time he gave utterance to mysterious hints of the extraordinary courage and spirit Stephen could manifest when occasion required . These praises were , however , in some measure balanced by Martha 's taunts and reproaches at home . The shooting season had commenced , and the lord of the manor was come , with a number of his friends , to shoot over the hills and plantations . He was a frank , pleasant - looking gentleman , but far too grand and high for Stephen to address , though he gazed wistfully at him whenever he chanced to meet him on the hills . One afternoon Martha saw him and the master walking towards Fern 's Hollow , where the fencing - in of the green and of the coppice behind the hut were being finished rapidly ; and she crept with stealthy steps under the hedge of the garden , until she came within earshot of them ; but they were just moving on , and all she heard of the conversation were these words , from the lord of the manor : '
17943	18094	18095	18095	They	534	' How Martha and Stephen did talk about those words over and over again , and could never come to any conclusion about them . It was about noon on Michaelmas Day , a day which was of no note up at Fern 's Hollow , where there was no rent to be paid , and Martha was busily hanging out clothes to dry on the gorse bushes before the house , when she saw a troop of labourers coming over the brow of the hill and crossing the newly - enclosed pasture . They were armed with mattocks and pickaxes ; but as the peaceful little cottage rose before them , with blind old Fern basking in the warm sunshine , and little Nan playing quietly about the door - sill , the men gathered into a little knot , and stood still with an irresolute and ashamed aspect . '
18101	18106	18095	18095	They	534	' said William Morris ; '
18181	18182	18183	18183	I	0	' '
18188	18196	18183	18183	I	0	' shouted a bolder - hearted man , '
18264	18265	18247	18247	He	19	' '
18277	18285	18272	18272	thee	22	' said Martha , turning very pale . '
18305	18306	18303	18303	Stephen	19	' '
18314	18319	18320	18321	The master	179	' replied William Morris . '
18406	18419	18357	18357	he	251	're to get the roof off and the walls down afore nightfall . '
18420	18426	18428	18428	Martha	22	' Grandfather and little Nan ! '
18430	18497	18357	18357	he	251	' get into the house this minute ! It 's no use you men coming up here on this errand . You know grandfather 's simple , and he has n't sold the house ; how could he ? He 's no more sense than little Nan . No , no ; you must go down to the works , and hear what Stephen says . You 're
18533	18625	18530	18530	I	0	' By this time the old man and the child were safely within the house ; and Martha , springing quickly from the wicket , where she had kept the men at bay , followed them in , and barred the door , before any one of the labourers could thrust his shoulder in to prevent her . They held a consultation together when they found that no arguments prevailed upon her to open to them , to which Martha listened disdainfully through the large chinks , but vouchsafed no answer . '
18633	18639	18630	18631	my lass	556	' said William Morris soothingly ; '
18711	18712	18713	18713	I	0	' '
18717	18735	18713	18713	I	0	' answered Martha,â€”'not for the lord of the manor himself . The house is ours , and I '
18769	18858	18762	18762	thee	179	' But when the old stove - pipe , through which the last breath of the household fire had passed , was drawn up , and the blue sky could be seen through the cloud of dust and dirt with which the hut was filled , choking the helpless old man and the frightened child , Martha 's courage failed her ; and she went out , with little Nan clinging round her , and spoke as calmly to the invaders as her rising sobs would let her . '
18868	18872	18859	18859	You	179	' she said ; '
18901	18902	18903	18903	We	565	' '
18910	18915	18908	18908	Martha	22	' answered Morris kindly ; '
18981	19033	18980	18980	we	565	're desperately cut up about it ourselves ; but , if we had n't done it , somebody that has no good - will towards him would have taken the job . So go thy poor ways with thee , my lass ; we are main sorry for thee and Stephen . '
19233	19241	19242	19242	she	22	' Why , it 's Miss Fern ! '
19250	19308	19242	19242	she	22	' Miss Fern , Esq . , of Fern 's Hollow , come to learn us poor pit - folk scholarship and manners . Here , lads ! here 's Mr. Stephen Fern 's fine sister , as knows more nor all of us put together . Give us a bit of your learning , Miss Fern . '
19309	19321	19323	19323	Martha	22	' I know a black - bess when I see one , '
19354	19359	19360	19360	they	587	' That 'll do ! '
19363	19380	19360	19360	they	587	' she knows a black - bess ! Thee 's got thy answer , Bess Thompson . '
19381	19390	19392	19392	Bess	48	' What 's brought thee to the pit ? '
19395	19425	19392	19392	Bess	48	' we want no scatter - witted hill girls here , I can tell ye . So get off the pit - bank , afore I drive thee off . '
19426	19433	19435	19435	Tim	33	' What 's all this hullabaloo ? '
19445	19469	19470	19470	Tim	33	' Why , Martha , what brings thee at the pit ? Come in here , and tell me what 's up now . '
19489	19926	19927	19927	I	0	' consideration , he told her he had nothing much to do , and he would get leave to take Stephen 's place for the rest of the day , so as to set him free to go home at once . He left her standing in the middle of the cabin , for the rough benches round it looked too black for her to venture to take a seat upon them ; and in a short time he shouted to her from a skep , which was being lowered into the pit , promising her that Stephen should come up as soon as possible . It seemed a terribly long time to wait amid that noise and dust , and every now and then Black Bess relieved her feelings by making hideous grimaces at her when she passed the cabin door ; but Stephen ascended at last , very stern - looking and silent , for Tim had told him Martha 's business ; and he hurried her away from the pit - bank before he would listen to the detailed account she was longing to give . Even when they were in the lonely lane leading homewards , and she was talking and sobbing herself out of breath , he walked on without a word passing his lips , though his heart was sending up ceaseless prayers to God for help to bear this trial with patience . Poor old home ! There was all the well - used household furniture carried out and heaped together on the turf,â€”chairs and tables and beds,â€”looking so differently to what they did when arranged in their proper order . The old man , with his grey head uncovered , was wandering to and fro in sore bewilderment ; and little Nan had fallen asleep beside the furniture , with the trace of tears upon her rosy cheeks . But the house was almost gone . The door - sill , where Stephen had so often seen the sun go down as he rested himself from his labours , was already taken up ; the old grate , round which they had sat all the winter nights that he had ever known , was pulled out of the rock ; and all the floor was open to the mocking sunshine . It is a mournful thing to see one 's own home in ruins ; and a tear or two made a white channel down the coal - dust on Stephen 's cheeks ; but he subdued himself , and spoke out to the labourers like a man . '
19935	19950	19927	19927	I	0	' he said , as they stood round him , making explanations and excuses ; '
20023	20024	20028	20028	we	594	' '
20030	20457	20458	20458	Stevie	19	' cried the men heartily ; and , submitting kindly to Stephen 's quiet directions , they were soon laden with the household goods , which were scanty and easily removed . Two or three journeys were sufficient to take them all ; and when the labourers returned for the last time to their work of destruction , Stephen took little Nan in his arms , and Martha led away the old man ; while the sound of the pickaxes and the crash of the rough rubble stones of their old home followed their slow and lingering steps over the new pasture , and down the hillside towards Botfield . The cinder - hill cabin was situated at the mouth of an old shaft , long out of use , but said to lead into the same pit as that now worked , the entrance to which was about a quarter of a mile distant . The cabin was about the same size as the hut from which the helpless family had been driven ; but the thatch wanted so much mending that Stephen and Martha were obliged to draw over it one of their patchwork quilts , to shelter them for the night from the rain which was threatened by the gathering clouds . The door from the hut at Fern 's Hollow was fortunately rather too large instead of being too small for the doorway ; and William Morris promised to bring them a shutter for the window - place , where there was no glass . Altogether , the cabin was not very inferior to their old home ; but , instead of the soft green turf and the fragrant air of the hills , they were surrounded by barren cinder - heaps , upon which nothing would grow but the yellow coltsfoot and a few weeds , and the wind was blowing clouds of smoke from the limekilns over and round the dismal cabin . Stephen , with the profound silence that began to frighten Martha , made every arrangement he could think of for their comfort during the quickly - approaching night ; and as soon as this was finished , he washed and dressed himself , as upon a Sunday morning , before going to meet Miss Anne in the Red Gravel Pit . He was leaving the cabin without speaking , when little Nan , who had watched everything in childish bewilderment and dismay , set up a loud , pitiful cry , which he soothed with great difficulty . '
20464	20477	20458	20458	Stevie	19	' said the little child at last , with a deep sob . '
20483	20487	20480	20481	little Nan	21	' he answered ; '
20522	20523	20526	20526	Stevie	19	' '
20528	20933	20526	20526	Stevie	19	' sobbed the child ; and Stephen , kissing her tenderly , put her on to Martha 's lap , and walked out into the moonlight . The clouds were hanging heavily in the western sky , but the clearer heavens shone all the brighter by the contrast . The mountains lay before him , calm and immovable in the soft light ; and he could see the round outline of his own hollow , at which his heart throbbed for a minute painfully . But there was a hidden corner at the side of the cabin , and there Stephen knelt down to pray earnestly before he went farther on his errand , until , calm and quiet as the hills , and as the moon which seemed to be gazing lovingly upon them , he went on with a brave and stedfast spirit to the master 's house . Botfield Hall was a large , half - timbered farmhouse , with a gabled roof , part of which was made of thatch and the rest of tiles . It stood quite alone , at a little distance from the works , on the other side of them to that where the village was built . The window - casements were framed of stone ; and the outer doors were of thick , solid oak , studded with large - headed iron nails . The iron ring that served as a rapper on the back door fell with a loud clang from Stephen 's fingers upon the nails , and startled him with its din , so that he could hardly speak to the servant who answered his noisy summons . They crossed a kitchen , into which many doors opened , to a kind of parlour beyond , fitted up with furniture that looked wonderfully handsome and grand in Stephen 's eyes , and where the master was sitting by a comfortable fire . The impatient servant pushed him within the door , and closed it behind her , leaving him standing upon a mat , and shyly stroking his cap round and round , while the master sat still , and gazed at him steadily with an assumed air of amazement , though inwardly he was more afraid of the boy than Stephen was of him . It makes a coward of a man or boy to do anybody an injury . '
20945	20953	20954	20954	Sir	264	' he asked in a gruff voice . '
20956	20968	20954	20954	Sir	264	' said Stephen firmly , but without any insolence of manner , '
20994	20995	20992	20992	you	264	' '
21004	21037	20996	20996	I	0	' answered the master , bringing his hand down with a heavy blow upon the table before him , as if he would like to knock Stephen down with the same force . '
21047	21052	21040	21040	nobody	147	' said the boy . '
21211	21212	21202	21202	you	0	' '
21215	21221	21222	21222	grandfather	1397	' said Stephen , trembling , '
21251	21252	21244	21244	he	1397	' '
21262	21267	21258	21258	you	264	' cried the master . '
21350	21351	21338	21338	I	0	' '
21358	21362	21338	21338	I	0	' inquired Stephen . '
21368	21375	21338	21338	I	0	' said the master , laughing : '
21397	21425	21380	21380	Jones	42	' Stephen 's face flushed into a wrathful crimson , but he did not speak ; and in a minute or two the master said sharply , â€” '
21442	21443	21434	21434	you	264	' '
21452	21470	21444	21444	I	0	' answered Stephen , walking up to the table and looking steadily into his master 's face . '
21541	21643	21529	21529	He	26	' The master shrank and turned pale before the keen , composed gaze of the boy and his manly bearing ; but Stephen 's heart began to fail him , and , with trembling limbs and eyes that could scarcely see , he made his way out of the room , and out of the house , down to the end of the shrubbery . There he could bear up no longer , and he sat down under the laurels , shivering with a feeling of despair . The worst was come upon him now , and he saw no helper . '
21648	21667	21529	21529	He	26	' said Miss Anne 's gentle voice , and he felt her hand laid softly on his shoulder . '
21688	21719	21678	21678	I	0	' Stephen answered her only with a low , half - suppressed groan ; and then he sat speechless and motionless , as if his despair had completely paralyzed him . '
21724	21731	21732	21732	you	19	' she continued , with energy : '
21881	21951	21952	21952	Stephen	19	' She spoke so gravely , yet cheeringly , that a bright hope beamed into Stephen 's mind ; and when Miss Anne held out her hand to him , as a pledge of her promise , she felt a warm tear fall upon it . He rose up from the ground now , and stood out into the moonlight before her , looking up into her pale face . '
21954	21963	21952	21952	Stephen	19	' she said , more solemnly than before , '
21976	21977	21965	21965	you	19	' '
21986	22008	21978	21978	I	0	' answered Stephen ; but there was a tone of bitterness in his voice , and his face grew gloomy again . '
22016	22023	22011	22014	a very miserable man	640	' said Miss Anne , sighing ; '
22156	22157	22149	22152	a very wretched man	643	' '
22169	22174	22175	22175	Stephen	19	' said Stephen pityingly . '
22177	22182	22183	22183	you	19	' continued Miss Anne , '
22230	22231	22216	22216	you	19	' '
22234	22254	22216	22216	you	19	' said the boy , hanging down his head , and wondering how Miss Anne could possibly know that . '
22259	22263	22257	22257	Stephen	19	' she continued , '
22341	22342	22329	22329	He	26	' '
22356	22360	22351	22351	you	19	' replied Stephen . '
22369	22374	22376	22376	us	645	' said Miss Anne ; '
22492	22493	22485	22485	you	19	' '
22503	22507	22485	22485	you	19	' he asked . '
22516	22521	22485	22485	you	19	' she answered tenderly ; '
22599	22850	22588	22588	He	655	' As she spoke the last words , they heard the master 's voice calling loudly for Miss Anne , and Stephen watched her run swiftly up the shrubbery and disappear through the door . There was a great bolting and locking and barring to be heard within , for it was rumoured that Mr. Wyley kept large sums of money in his house , and no place in the whole country - side was more securely fastened up by day or night . But Stephen thought of him pacing up and down his room through the sleepless night , praying God to have mercy upon him , yet not willing to give up his sin ; and as he turned away to the poor little cabin on the cinder - hill , there was more pity than revenge in the boy 's heart . The report of the expulsion of the family from Fern 's Hollow spread through Botfield before morning ; and Stephen found an eager cluster of men , as well as boys and girls , awaiting his appearance on the pit - bank . There was the steady step and glance of a man about him when he came â€” a grave , reserved air , which had an effect upon even the rough colliers . Black Thompson came forward to shake hands with him , and his example was followed by many of the others , with hearty expressions of sympathy and attempts at consolation . '
22859	23152	23153	23153	Stephen	19	' said Stephen ; and that was all they could provoke him to utter . He went down to his work ; and , though now and then the recollection thrilled through him that there was no pleasant Fern 's Hollow for him to return to in the evening , none of his comrades could betray him into any expression of resentment against his oppressor . In the meantime Miss Anne did not forget to visit the cabin , and cheer , as well as she could , the trouble of poor Martha , whose good and proud housewifery had kept Fern 's Hollow cleaner and tidier than any of the cottages at Botfield . It was no easy matter to rouse Martha to take any interest in the miserable cabin where the household furniture had been hastily heaped in the night before ; but when her heart warmed to the work , in which Miss Anne was taking an active part , she began to feel something like pleasure in making the new home like the old one , as far as the interior went . Out of doors , no improvement could be made until soil could be carried up the barren and steep bank , to make a little plot of garden ground . But within , the work went on so heartily that , when Stephen returned from the pit , half an hour earlier than usual,â€”for he had no long walk of two miles now,â€”he found his grandfather settled in the chimney corner , apparently unconscious of any removal , while both Martha and little Nan seemed in some measure reconciled to their change of dwelling . Moreover , Miss Anne was waiting to greet him kindly . '
23155	23159	23153	23153	Stephen	19	' she said , '
23253	23285	24063	24064	Stephen Fern	19	' The opportunity for going to Danesford was not long in coming , for Black Thompson and Cole , who were the chief colliers in the pit , chose to take a '
23289	24059	24063	24064	Stephen Fern	19	' with the rest of their comrades ; and the boys and girls employed at the works were obliged to play also , though it involved the forfeiture of their day 's wages â€” always a serious loss to Stephen . This time , however , he heard the news gladly ; and , carefully securing the three notes by pinning them inside his pocket , he set out for his ten miles walk across the tableland to the other side of the mountains , where Danesford lay . His nearest way led straight by Fern 's Hollow , and he saw that already upon the old site the foundation was laid for a new house containing three rooms . In everything else the aspect of the place remained unchanged ; there still hung the creaking wicket , where little Nan had been wo nt to look for his coming home , until she could run with outstretched arms to meet him . The beehives stood yet beneath the hedge , and the bees were flying to and fro , seeking out the few flowers of the autumn upon the hillside . The fern upon the uplands , just behind the hollow , was beginning to die , and its rich red - brown hue showed that it was ready to be cut and carried away for fodder ; but a squatter from some other hill - hut had trespassed upon Stephen 's old domain . Except this one man , the whole tableland was deserted ; and so silent was it that the rustle of his own feet through the fading ferns sounded like other footsteps following him closely . The sheep were not yet driven down into the valleys , and they and the wild ponies stood and stared boldly at the solitary boy , without fleeing from his path , as if they had long since forgotten how the bilberry gatherers had delighted in frightening them . Stephen was too grave and manlike to startle them into memory of it , and he plodded on mile after mile with the three notes in his pocket and his hand closed upon them , pondering deeply with what words he should speak to the unknown clergyman at Danesford . When he reached Danesford , he found it a very quiet , sleepy little village , with a gleaming river flowing through it placidly , and such respectable houses and small clean cottages as put to shame the dwellings at Botfield . So early was it yet , that the village children were only just going to school ; and the biggest boy turned back with Stephen to the gate of the Rectory . Stephen had never seen so large and grand a mansion , standing far back from the road , in a park , through which ran a carriage drive up to a magnificent portico . He stole shyly along a narrow side path to the back door , and even there was afraid of knocking ; but when his low single rap was answered by a good - tempered - looking girl , not much older than Martha , his courage revived , and he asked , in a straightforward and steady manner , if he could see the parson . At which the servant laughed a little , and , after inquiring his name , said she would see if Mr. Lockwood could spare time to speak to him . Before long the girl returned , and led Stephen through many winding and twisting passages , more puzzling than the roads in the pit , to a large , grand room , with windows down to the ground , and looking out upon a beautiful flower - garden . It was like the palace Miss Anne had spoken of , for he could not understand half the things that were in the room ; only he saw a fire burning in a low grate , the bars of which shone like silver , and upon the carpeted hearth beside it was a sofa , where a young lady was lying , and near to it was a breakfast - table , at which an elderly gentleman was seated alone . He was a very keen , shrewd - looking man , and very pleasant to look at when he smiled ; and he smiled upon Stephen , as he stood awe - struck and speechless at his own daring in coming to speak to such a gentleman , and in such a place as this . '
24071	24076	24063	24064	Stephen Fern	19	' said Mr. Lockwood ; '
24133	24134	24125	24125	she	166	' '
24143	24153	24154	24155	Poor boy	671	' murmured Stephen , unable to say any more . '
24157	24166	24154	24155	Poor boy	671	' said the young lady on the sofa . '

24192	24197	24183	24183	I	0	' replied Mr. Lockwood . '
24235	24417	24418	24418	I	0	' Thus encouraged , Stephen , with the utmost simplicity and frankness , though with fewer words than Martha would have put into the narrative , told Mr. Lockwood the whole history of his life ; to which the clergyman listened with ever - increasing interest , as he noticed how the boy was telling all the truth , and nothing but the truth , even to his joining Black Thompson in poaching . When he had finished , Mr. Lockwood went to a large cabinet in the room , and , bringing out a bundle of old yellow documents , soon found among them the paper James Fern had spoken of on his death - bed . It was written by the clergyman living in Longville at the time of old Martha Fern 's death , to certify that she had settled , and maintained her settlement on the hillside , without paying rent , or having her fences destroyed , for upwards of twenty years , and that the land was her own by the usages of the common .

24641	24662	24627	24627	you	264	' answered Mr. Lockwood , coughing down his emotion at the young boy 's forethought and care for his sisters . '

24732	24737	24730	24730	sir	264	' said Stephen quietly . '
24748	24759	24738	24738	You	253	' replied Mr. Lockwood , smiling at his few words . '
24772	24782	24764	24764	I	0	' he answered , with a feeling of shyness ; '
24799	24826	24789	24790	a rascal	703	' ud throw me back like , and it 's very hard work anyhow . I feel as if I 'd like to do it sometimes . '
24827	24834	24836	24837	Mr. Lockwood	49	' You are right , Stephen , '
24839	24971	24836	24837	Mr. Lockwood	49	' you are wise in keeping your tongue from evil speaking : for " therewith bless we God , even the Father ; and therewith curse we men , which are made after the similitude of God . Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing . " You have taught an old parson a lesson , my boy . You had better leave your money with me until my lawyer gives us his opinion . Now go home in peace , and serve your master faithfully ; but if you should need a friend before I return , come here and ask for the clergyman who is going to take my duty . I will tell him about you , and he will help you until I come home . '

25565	25584	25554	25554	Martha	22	' I 've been thinking how it 's only thee that 's trying to keep the commandments . I 'm
25620	25653	25619	25619	I	0	'm thinking I ought to love my enemies as well as thee ; and I 've asked Black Bess to come and have a cup of tea with us to - morrow . '
25654	25658	25660	25660	Stephen	19	' Black Bess ! '
25669	25672	25674	25674	Martha	22	' Ah , '
25676	25755	25674	25674	Martha	22	' she 's always calling me â€” a shame to be heard . But I 've quite forgiven her ; and to - morrow I 'll let her see I can make pikelets as well as her mother ; and we 'll have out the three china cups ; only grandfather and little Nan must have common ones . I thought I 'd better tell thee ; and then thee'lt make haste home from church in the afternoon . '
25756	25767	25769	25769	Stephen	19	' Black Bess is n't a good friend for thee , '
25798	25807	25809	25809	Martha	22	' But we are to love our enemies , '
25811	25835	25809	25809	Martha	22	' and do good to them that hate us . At any rate I asked her , and she said she 'd come . '
25836	25852	25854	25854	Stephen	19	' I do n't think it means we are to ask our enemies to tea , '
25859	25878	25854	25854	Stephen	19	' If she was badly off , like , and in want of a meal 's meat , it '

25917	25922	25923	25923	thee'rt	737	' replied Martha pettishly ; '
25958	25996	25997	25997	Stephen	19	'm not without some shillings of my own , I reckon . Thee should let me love my enemies as well as thee , I think ; but thee'lt want to go up to heaven alone next . '
26350	26356	26357	26357	he	19	' Good evening , Bess , '
26366	26415	26357	26357	he	19	' Martha told me thee was coming to eat some pikelets with her , so I asked Tim to come too ; and after tea we 'll have some rare singing . I often hear thee on the bank , Bess , and thee has a good voice . '
26636	26642	26644	26644	Tim	33	' Now then , Stevie , '
26646	26668	26644	26644	Tim	33	' thee learn me the new hymn Miss Anne sings with us ; and let 's teach Bess to sing too . '

26999	27031	26992	26992	she	21	' and she minded me of her . Miss Anne told me she was singing somewhere among the angels , and I thought she 'd look like little Nan . But I 'm
27042	27046	26992	26992	she	21	'm so bad . '
27047	27057	27059	27059	Martha	22	' We 'll teach thee how to be good , '
27061	27099	26992	26992	she	21	' Thee come to me , Bess , and I 'll teach thee the hymns , and the singing , and how to make pikelets , and keep the house clean on a week - day . I 'm
27144	27160	27161	27161	I	0	' That night , as Stephen lay down to sleep , he said to himself , '
27162	27223	27137	27137	enemies	761	'm glad Black Bess came to eat pikelets with Martha . My chapter says , " Whosoever shall do the commandments , and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven . " Perhaps Martha and me will be called great in heaven , if we teach Bess how to do God 's commandments . '
27378	27386	27374	27374	she	22	' Blessed are the poor in spirit , '
27388	27394	27374	27374	she	22	' Blessed are the meek , '

27889	27898	27900	27900	Martha	22	' I 've got no money to spend , '
27903	27944	27900	27900	Martha	22	' Stephen ought to let grandfather go into the House , and then we should n't be so pinched . What with buying for him and little Nan , I 've hardly a brass farthing in the world for myself . '

27955	28001	27952	27952	Bess	23	' let Stephen pinch if he will . Why , all the lads in Botfield are making a mock at thee , calling thee an old - fashioned piece and Granny Fern . But come and look , anyhow ; Andrew will be gone directly . '
28132	28145	28147	28147	Andrew	51	' Eh ! here 's a clean , tight lass for you ! '
28160	28196	28150	28150	Martha	22	' The best shawl in my pack is n't good enough for you , my dear . Pick and choose . Just make your own choice , and I 'll accommodate you about the price . '
28197	28204	28206	28206	Martha	22	' I 've got no money , '
28208	28219	28221	28221	Andrew	51	' Oh , you and me'll not quarrel about money , '
28223	28237	28221	28221	Andrew	51	' you make your choice , and I 'll wait your time . I 'm

28298	28382	28295	28295	he	51	' and with a shawl like this , now , you 'd look like a full - blown rose . Come , I 'll not be hard upon you , as it 's the first time you 've dealt with me . That shawl 's worth ten shillings if it 's worth a farthing , and I 'll let you have it for seven shillings and sixpence ; half a crown down , and a shilling a fortnight till it 's paid up . '

The roof 's dropped in , and only a boy could creep along . But who 's to tell Stevie ? Oh , Miss Anne , could n't you go down with me , and tell him gently your own self ? '
29398	29405	29407	29408	Miss Anne	21	' Yes , I will go , '
29661	29665	29667	29667	Cole	33	' My lad , '

29785	29810	29782	29782	she	21	' are you sure that I care for you , and would not let any trouble come upon you if I could help it ? '
29811	29819	29821	29822	the boy	1434	' Yes , surely , Miss Anne , '
29825	29838	29839	29839	she	21	' Your Father which is in heaven cares much more for you , '
29842	29883	29839	29839	she	21	' but " whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth , and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth . " God is dealing with you as His son , Stephen . Can you bear the sorrow which is sent by Him ? '
29884	29893	29894	29894	he	1434	' If the Lord Jesus will help me , '
29897	29907	29909	29910	Miss Anne	21	' He will help you , my poor boy , '
29911	29940	29941	29941	Stephen	19	' Oh , Stephen , Stephen , how can I tell you ? Our little Nan , our precious little child , has fallen down the old shaft . '
30038	30042	30022	30022	Tim	33	' The little lass '
30048	30059	30022	30022	Tim	33	' whispered Cole , passing his arm tighter round Stephen ; '
30076	30145	30073	30073	I	0	' Stephen drew himself away from Cole 's arm , and staggered forward a step or two to meet Tim ; when he took the sad burden from him , and sat down without a word , pressing it closely to his breast . His perfect silence touched all about him . Miss Anne hid her face in her hands , and some of the men groaned aloud . '
30158	30162	30073	30073	I	0	' said Cole ; '
30175	30176	30073	30073	I	0	' '
30185	30282	30073	30073	I	0	' muttered Black Thompson . But Stephen seemed not to hear their words . Still , with the child clasped tightly to him , he waited for the lowering of the skip , and when it descended , he seated himself in it without lifting up his head , which was bent over the dead child . Miss Anne and Tim took their places beside him , and they were drawn up to the broad , glittering light of day on the surface , where a crowd of eager bystanders was waiting for Stephen 's appearance . '
30291	30514	30515	30515	I	0	' he murmured , without looking round ; and they made way for him in his deep , silent grief , as he passed on homewards , followed by Miss Anne . Once she saw him look up to the hills , where , at Fern 's Hollow , the new house stood out conspicuously against the snow ; and when they passed the shaft , he shuddered visibly ; but yet he was silent , and scarcely seemed to know that she was walking beside him . The cabin was full of women from Botfield , for Martha had fallen into violent fits of hysterics , and none of their remedies had any effect in soothing her . One of them took the dead child from Stephen 's arms at the door , and bade him go away and sit in her cottage till she came to him . But he turned off towards the hills ; and Miss Anne , seeing that she could say nothing to comfort him just then , watched him strolling along the old road that led to Fern 's Hollow , with his arms folded and his head bent down , as if he were still carrying that sad burden which he had borne up from the pit , so closely pressed against his heart . '
30516	30523	30525	30525	Martha	22	'm a murderer , Miss Anne , '
30641	30649	30651	30652	Miss Anne	21	' And for murderers there is pardon , '
30655	30665	30667	30667	Martha	22	' Oh , I never thought I wanted pardon , '
30669	30744	30667	30667	Martha	22	' I always felt I 'd done my duty better than any of the girls about here . But I 've killed little Nan ; and now I remember how cross I used to be when nobody was nigh , till she grew quite timmer - some of me . Everybody knows I 've murdered her ; and now it does n't signify how bad I am . I shall never get over that . '
30745	30748	30750	30751	Miss Anne	21	' Martha , '
30753	30805	30750	30751	Miss Anne	21	' you are not so guilty of the child 's death as my uncle , who ought to have had the pit bricked over safely when it was no longer in use . But you say you never thought you wanted pardon . Surely you feel your need of it now . '
30806	30815	30817	30817	Martha	22	' But God will never forgive me now , '
30820	30846	30817	30817	Martha	22	' I see how wicked I have been , but the chance is gone by . God will not forgive me now ; nor Stephen . '
30847	30855	30857	30858	Miss Anne	21	' We will not talk about Stephen , '
30860	31028	30857	30858	Miss Anne	21	' but I will tell you about God . When He gave His commandments to mankind that they might obey them , He proclaimed His own name at the same time . Listen to His name , Martha : " The Lord , the Lord God , merciful and gracious , long - suffering , and abundant in goodness and truth , keeping mercy for thousands , forgiving iniquity , transgression , and sin . " If you would not go to Him for mercy when you did not feel your need of it , He was keeping it for you against this time ; saving and treasuring it up for you , " that He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness towards us , through Christ Jesus . " He is waiting to pardon your iniquity , for Christ 's sake . Do you wish to be forgiven now ? Do you feel that you are a sinful girl , Martha ? '
31029	31040	31042	31042	Martha	22	' I have thought of nothing else all day long , '
31044	31056	31042	31042	Martha	22	' I have helped to kill little Nan by my sins . '
31057	31060	31062	31063	Miss Anne	21	' Yes , '
31066	31137	31062	31063	Miss Anne	21	' if , like Stephen , you had opened your heart to the gentle teaching of the Holy Spirit , if you had looked to Jesus , trusted in Him , and followed Him , this grief would not have come upon you and upon all of us . For Bess would not have persuaded you to leave your own duties , and little Nan would have been alive still . '
31138	31148	31062	31063	Miss Anne	21	' Oh , I knew I 'd killed her ! '
31208	31214	31216	31217	Miss Anne	21	' Come here , Bess , '
31460	31467	31470	31470	her	21	' the shields of the earth , '

There was no look of pain upon the pale , placid little features before them ; but there was an awful stillness , and all the light of life was gone out of the open eyes , which were fixed into an upward gaze . The Bible , which Stephen had not looked for that morning , had been used instead of a cushion , and the motionless head lay upon it . '
32688	32693	32694	32694	she	21	' said Stephen hoarsely ; '
32780	32833	32834	32834	He	0	'm almost clemmed to death , till I see what God will do at you . Take your money . You 've robbed me of all I love , but I wo n't take from you what you love . I 'll only wait here till I see what God can do . '
33326	33364	33293	33293	he	28	' He sent from above , He took him , He brought him out of many waters . He brought him forth also into a large place ; He delivered him , because He delighted in him . '
33871	33934	33857	33857	he	19	' How doth God know ? and is there knowledge with the Most High ? Behold , these are the ungodly that prosper in the earth ; they increase in riches . Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain , and washed my hands in innocency . For all the day long have I been plagued , and chastened every morning . '
33935	33944	33945	33945	he	19	' Why does God let these things be ? '
34009	34018	34020	34021	Miss Anne	21	' You have asked me a hard question , '
34023	34073	34020	34021	Miss Anne	21	' we can not understand God 's way , for " as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are His ways than our ways . " But shall we try to find out a reason why God let these things be for little Nan 's sake ? '
34074	34077	34079	34079	Stephen	19	' Yes , '
34089	34561	34079	34079	Stephen	19	' Our Lord Jesus Christ had one disciple , called John , whom He loved more than the rest ; and before John died he was permitted to see heaven , and to write down many of the things shown to him , that we also might know of them . He beheld a holy city , whose builder and maker is God , and having the glory of God . It was built , as it were , of pure gold , and the walls were of all manner of precious stones ; the gates of the city were of pearl , and the streets of gold , as clear and transparent as glass . There was no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine in it ; for the glory of God doth lighten it , and the Lamb is the light thereof . He saw , too , the throne of God , and above it there was a rainbow of emerald , which was a sign of His covenant with the people upon earth . And round about the throne , nearer than the angels , there were seats , upon which men who had been ransomed from this world of sin and sorrow were sitting in white robes , and with crowns upon their heads . There came a pure river of water of life out of the throne , and on each side of the river , in the streets of the city , there was a tree of life , the leaves of which are for the healing of all nations . Before the throne stood a great multitude , which no man could number , clothed in white robes , and with palms in their hands . And as John listened , he heard a sound like the voice of many waters ; then , as it became clearer , it seemed like the voice of a great thunder ; but at last it rang down into his opened ears as the voice of many harpers , singing a new song with their harps . And he heard a great voice out of heaven , proclaiming the covenant of God with men : " Behold , the tabernacle of God is with men , and He will dwell with them , and they shall be His people ; and God Himself shall be with them , and be their God . And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ; and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain . " The disciple whom Jesus loved saw many other things which he was commanded to seal up ; but these things were written for our comfort . '
34562	34569	34571	34571	Stephen	19	' And little Nan is there , '
34581	34614	34616	34617	Miss Anne	21	' Our Lord says of little children , " I say unto you , That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven , " '
34619	34647	34616	34617	Miss Anne	21	' Stephen , do you wish her to be back again in this sorrowful world , with Martha and you for companions , instead of the angels ? '
34648	34652	34654	34654	Stephen	19	' Oh no ! '
34656	34832	34654	34654	Stephen	19	' And now , why has God sent so many troubles to you , my poor Stephen ? As I told you before , we can not understand His ways yet . But do not you see that sorrow has made you very different to the other boys about you ? Have you not gained much wisdom that they do not possess ? And would you change your lot with any one of them ? Would you even be as you were yourself twelve months ago , before these afflictions came ? We are sent into this world for something more than food and clothing , and work and play . Our souls must live , and they are dead if they are not brought into submission to God 's will . Even our own Lord and Saviour , " though He were a son , yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered . " How much more do we need to suffer before we learn obedience to the will of God ! '
34838	34847	34654	34654	Stephen	19	' continued Miss Anne , after a pause ; '
34879	34880	34877	34877	Stephen	19	' '
34890	34930	34931	34931	Our	952	' said Stephen in a low voice . A flush of pain passed over Miss Anne 's face as she met Stephen 's eager gaze , and saw something of the working of his heart in his flashing eye . '
34943	34948	34932	34932	God	26	' she answered solemnly . '
35055	35056	35059	35060	the master	179	' '
35062	35072	35059	35060	the master	179	' said Stephen , his face glowing with satisfaction , '
35085	35086	35081	35081	he	179	' '
35102	35123	35059	35060	the master	179	' said Miss Anne , and her head drooped low , and Stephen saw the tears streaming down her cheeks ; '
35152	35214	35216	35216	my	0	' Stephen looked at her bitter weeping with a longing desire to say something to comfort her , but he could not speak a word : for her grief was caused by the thought of the very vengeance he was wishing for . He turned away his head uneasily , and gazed deep down into the glowing embers of the fire . '
35222	35227	35216	35216	my	0	' continued Miss Anne , '
35299	35300	35304	35304	I	0	' '
35309	35319	35306	35307	Miss Anne	21	' cried the boy , sinking on his knees . '
35339	35379	35322	35323	Miss Anne	21	' When Miss Anne 's prayer was ended , she left Stephen alone to the deep but gentler thoughts that were filling his mind . He understood now , with a clearness that he had never had before , that '
35399	35525	35526	35526	Lord	968	' He must love his enemies because they were precious , as he himself had been , in all their sin and rebellion , to their Father in heaven . Not only did God send rain and sunshine upon the evil and unjust , but He had so loved them as to give His only begotten Son to die for them ; and if they perished , so far it made the cross of Christ of none effect . Henceforth the bitterness of revenge died out of his heart ; and whenever he bent his knees in prayer , he offered up the dying petition of his namesake , the martyr Stephen , in behalf of all his enemies , but especially of his master : '
35536	36152	35526	35526	Lord	968	' Stephen 's recovery went on so slowly , that the doctor who attended him said it would not be fit for him to resume his underground labour for some months to come , if he were ever able to do so ; and advised him to seek some out - door employment . His old comrades began to find the weekly subscription to make up his wages rather a tax upon their own earnings ; and Stephen himself was unwilling to be a burden upon them any longer . As soon , therefore , as he was strong enough to bear the journey , he resolved to cross the hills again to Danesford , to see when Mr. Lockwood was coming home , and what help the clergyman left in charge of his duty could give to him . Tim brought his father 's donkey for him to ride , and went with him across the uplands . The hard frosts and the snow were over , for it was past the middle of March ; but the house at Fern 's Hollow remained in precisely the same state as when little Nan died ; not a stroke of work had been done at it , and a profound silence brooded over the place . Perhaps the master had lost all pleasure in his ill - gotten possession ! So changed was Stephen , though Danesford looked exactly the same , so tall had he grown during his illness , and so white was his formerly brown face , that the big boy who had shown him the way to the rectory did not know him again in the least . Probably Mr. Lockwood and his daughter would not have recognised him ; but they were still lingering in a warmer climate , until the east winds had quite finished their course . The strange clergyman , however , was exceedingly kind to both the boys , and promised to send a full and faithful account to Mr. Lockwood of all the circumstances they narrated to him ; for Tim told of many things which Stephen passed over . They had done right in coming to him , he said ; and he gave Stephen enough money to supply the immediate necessities of his family , at the same time bidding him apply for more if he needed any ; for he knew that a boy of his principle and character would never live upon other people 's charity whenever he could work for himself . How refreshing and strengthening it was upon the tableland that spring afternoon ! The red leaf - buds of the bilberry - wires were just bursting forth , and the clumps of gorse were tinged with the first golden flowers . Every kind of moss was there carpeting the ground with a bright fresh green from the moisture of the spring showers . As for the birds , they seemed absolutely in a frenzy of enjoyment , and seemed to forget that they had their nests to build as they flew from bush to bush , singing merrily in the sunshine . Tim wrapped a cloak round Stephen ; and then they faced the breeze gaily , as it swept to meet them with a pure breath over miles of heath and budding flowers . No wonder that Stephen 's heart rose within him with a rekindled gladness and gratitude ; while Tim became almost as wild as the birds . But Stephen began to feel a little tired as they neared Fern 's Hollow , though they were still two miles from the cinder - hill cabin . '
36157	36170	36171	36171	Tim	33	' he said , rather mournfully , pointing to the new house . '
36275	36276	36259	36260	Miss Anne	21	' '
36282	36286	36259	36260	Miss Anne	21	' replied Tim , '
36297	36298	36259	36260	Miss Anne	21	' '
36302	36306	36259	36260	Miss Anne	21	' said Stephen , '
36327	36353	36355	36355	God	26	'm willing now never to go back to Fern 's Hollow , if God pleases . Not that little Nan is gone ; but because I 'm
36366	36391	36326	36326	I	0	're to have no continuing city here . I think I should n't feel a bit angry if I saw other people living there . '
36392	36399	36401	36401	Tim	33	' Hillo ! what 's that ? '
36515	36520	36521	36521	he	33	' It 's Martha ! '
36524	36560	36521	36521	he	33	' I saw her gown peeping round the corner of the wall . I 'll lay a wager it 's her print gown . Come thy ways ; we 'll make sure afore we pass . '
36709	36715	36717	36717	Tim	33	' We may be pilgrims , '
36726	36740	36717	36717	Tim	33	' but there 's lots of pleasant things sent us by the way . '
36817	36819	36807	36807	his	19	' I 'm
36831	36835	36823	36823	thee	19	' he said ; '
36958	37022	36932	36932	He	999	' Stephen accepted the offer gladly ; and when the gamekeeper was gone , they sang a hymn together , so blotting out by an offering of praise the evil prayer which he had uttered upon that hearth on the night of his desolation and strong conflict . Pleasant was the way home to the old cabin in the twilight ; pleasant the hearty '
37026	37412	37413	37413	I	0	' of Tim and Bess ; but most pleasant of all was the calm sense of truth , and the submissive will with which Stephen resigned himself to the providence of God . The work of a shepherd was far more to Stephen 's taste than his dangerous toil as a collier . From his earliest years he had been accustomed to wander with his grandfather over the extensive sheep - walks , seeking out any strayed lambs , or diligently gathering food for the sick ones of the flock . To be sure , he could only earn little more than half his former wages , and his time for returning from his work would always be uncertain , and often very late . But then , sorrowful consideration ! there was no little Nan to provide for now , nor to fill up his leisure hours at home . Martha was earning money for herself ; and as yet the master had demanded no rent for their miserable cabin ; so his earnings as a shepherd 's boy would do until Mr. Lockwood came back . Still upon the mountains he would be exposed to the bleak winds and heavy storms of the spring ; while underground the temperature had always been the same . No wonder that Miss Anne , when she looked at the boy 's wasted and enfeebled frame , listened with unconcealed anxiety to his new project for gaining his livelihood ; and so often as the spring showers swept in swift torrents across the sky , lifted up her eyes wistfully to the unsheltered mountains , as she pictured Stephen at the mercy of the pitiless storm . Stephen had been engaged in his new calling for about a fortnight , and was coming home , after a long and toilsome day among the flocks , two hours after sunset , with a keen east wind bringing the tears into his eyes , when a few paces from his cabin door a tall dark figure sprang up from a hollow in the cinder - hill , and laid a heavy hand upon his shoulder . It was just light enough to discern the gloomy features of Black Thompson ; and Stephen inquired fearlessly what he wanted with him . '
37420	37426	37413	37413	I	0	' said Black Thompson impatiently . '
37506	37507	37504	37504	strangers	974	' '
37522	37526	37517	37517	Thompson	31	' said Stephen . '
37529	37533	37517	37517	Thompson	31	' repeated Thompson ; '
37672	37691	37650	37650	Nan	21	' Black Thompson felt that Stephen trembled under his grasp , and he went on with greater earnestness . '
37752	37753	37750	37750	Stephen	19	' '
37758	37766	37754	37754	God	26	' said Stephen in a tremulous tone . '
37773	37779	37781	37781	He	26	' asked Black Thompson scoffingly ; '
37863	37864	37856	37856	God	26	' '
37866	37871	37873	37873	Stephen	19	'm sure God sees , '
37875	37976	37873	37873	Stephen	19	' He is everywhere ; and He is n't blind , or deaf , only we do n't understand what He is going to do yet . If He did n't take any notice of us , He would n't make me feel so happy , spite of everything . Oh , Thompson thee and the men were so kind to me when I could n't work , and I 've never seen thee to thank thee . I can do nothing for thee , except I could persuade thee to repent , and be as happy as I am . '
37977	37986	37988	37989	Black Thompson	31	' Oh , I 'll repent some day , '
37996	38046	37988	37989	Black Thompson	31	' but I 've lots of things to do aforehand , and I reckon they can all be repented of together . So , lad , it 's true what everybody is saying of thee â€” thee has forgotten poor little Nan , and thy promise to thy father ! '
38047	38055	38057	38057	Stephen	19	' No , I 've never forgotten , '
38059	38098	38057	38057	Stephen	19	' but I 'll never try to revenge myself now . I could n't if I did try . Besides , I 've forgiven the master ; so do n't speak to me again about it , Thompson . '
38099	38117	38119	38120	Black Thompson	31	' Well , lad , be sure I 'll never waste my time thinking of thee again , '
38126	38149	38119	38120	Black Thompson	31	' thy religion has made a poor , spiritless , cowardly chap of thee , and I 've done with thee altogether . '
38395	38400	38401	38401	He	19	' Stephen ! Stephen ! '
38510	38518	38545	38545	They	1028	' It 's only me â€” Tim ! '
38522	38538	38545	38545	They	1028	' Hush ! do n't speak , Stephen ; do n't make any noise . I 'm
38546	38560	38545	38545	They	1028	're going to break into the master 's house to - night . They 're
38622	38957	38583	38583	They	1028	' These sentences sounded up into Stephen 's ears , one by one , slowly , as Tim could give his voice its due tone and strength . He recollected instantly all the long oppression the men had suffered from their master . In that distant part of the county , where there were extensive works , the colliers had been striking for larger wages ; and some of them had strolled down to Botfield , bringing with them an increase of discontent and inquietude , which had taken deep root in the minds of all the workpeople . It was well known that the master kept large sums of money in his house , which , as I have told you , was situated among lonely fields , nearly a mile from Botfield ; and no one lived with him , except Miss Anne , and one maid - servant . It was a very secure building , with stone casements and strongly barred doors ; but if a boy could get through the pantry window , he could admit the others readily . How long it would be before the attempt was made Stephen could not tell , but it was already late , and Black Thompson had left him hurriedly . But at least it must be an hour or two nearer midnight , and all hopes of rescue and defence rested upon him and Martha only . Martha was sitting by the fire knitting , and Bess Thompson was pinning on her shawl to go home . Poor Bess ! Even in his excitement Stephen felt for her ; but he dared not utter a word till she was gone . But then Martha could not credit his hurried tidings and directions , until she had been herself to the shaft to see the feeble gleam of Tim 's lamp , and hear the sound of his voice ; for as soon as she rattled the railings he spoke again . '
38961	38965	38966	38966	I	0	' he cried . '
38967	38998	38966	38966	I	0	'm not afeared ; but I ca n't stay here where little Nan died . I 'll go back to the pit , and wait till morning . Be sharp ! '
39414	39418	39419	39419	he	19	' Stephen Fern , '
39437	39445	39446	39446	she	21	' What is the matter , Stephen ? '
39449	39471	39446	39446	she	21	' I can not open the door , for my uncle always takes the keys with him into his own room . '
39472	39485	39486	39486	he	19	' Please to take the light into the pantry for one minute , '
39623	39636	39616	39616	he	1053	' Do n't be afraid . It 's me â€” Stephen ; I 'm
39644	39992	39616	39616	he	1053	' He knew his danger . He knew if any of the robbers came up they must hear him removing the wooden lattice which was laid over the opening ; and unless they supposed it to be one of their accomplices at work , he would be at once in their power , exposed to their ill - treatment , or perhaps suffer death at their hands . And would Miss Anne within trust to him instead of alarming the master ? If he came down and opened the door , all the designs of the evil men would be hastened and finished before Martha could return from Longville . But Stephen did not listen , nor did his fingers tremble over their work , though there was a rush of thoughts and fears through his brain . He tore away the lattice as quickly and quietly as he could , and , with one keen glance round at the dark night , he thrust his head through the narrow frame . He found it was just possible to crush through ; and , after a minute 's struggle , his feet rested upon the pantry floor . Anne was standing close to the pantry door , listening to Stephen 's mysterious movements in utter bewilderment , hardly knowing whether she ought to call her uncle , but not coming to a decision about it until the boy appeared before her . His first quick action was to secure the door by fastening a rusty bolt which was on the outside , and then , in a few hurried sentences , he explained his strange conduct by telling her how Tim had conveyed to him the design of some of the colliers for breaking into the master 's house . There had been several similar robberies in the country during the strike for wages , and Miss Anne was greatly alarmed , while Stephen felt all the tender spirit of a brave man aroused within him , as she sank faint and trembling upon the nearest seat . '
39998	40003	39616	39616	he	1053	' he said courageously ; '
40019	40065	40018	40018	I	0	'm stronger than you 'd think ; but if I ca n't take care of thee , God can . Has n't He sent me here , afore they come , on purpose ? They 'd have come upon you unawares , but for God . '
40066	40073	40075	40076	Miss Anne	21	' You are right , Stephen , '
40078	40133	40075	40076	Miss Anne	21	' He says , " Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night . " But what shall we do ? How can we make ourselves safer ? I 'll try not to be afraid ; but we must do all we can ourselves . Hark ! there 's a footstep already ! '
40263	40271	40273	40274	Miss Anne	21	' I must go and tell him , '
40276	40317	40318	40318	She	21	' perhaps he can secure some of his money , lest Martha should be stopped on the way , or not come in time . Stay here and watch , Stephen , and let me know if you hear anything . '
40710	40714	40721	40721	he	1081	' Keep off ! '
40745	40780	40731	40731	he	1081	' Keep off ! Stephen Fern , is it you ? You 've come to take your revenge . The robbers and murderers have got in ! O God , have pity upon me ! '

40792	40796	40733	40733	his	1081	' said Stephen , '

40835	40840	40829	40829	Anne	21	' implored Mr. Wyley . '
40856	40873	40874	40875	Miss Anne	21	'm not safe while he 's there ; they will murder me ! Go , go ! '
40982	40987	40988	40988	they	1084	' Fire ! fire ! '
41008	41023	40988	40988	they	1084	' Wake up , master ! wake up ! the house is on fire ! '
41079	41081	41076	41076	she	21	' They 're
41088	41093	41076	41076	she	21	' he said quietly ; '
41128	41141	41124	41125	Miss Anne	21	'm praying to God all the while to send Martha in time . '
41142	41147	41148	41148	she	21	' So am I , '
41153	41163	41148	41148	she	21	' but oh , Stephen , I am frightened . '
41164	41168	41169	41169	he	19	' Miss Anne , '
41177	41195	41169	41169	he	19	' that chapter about faith you 've been teaching me , it says something about quenching fire . '
41196	41205	41206	41206	she	21	' " Quenched the violence of fire , " '
41209	41219	41206	41206	she	21	' " out of weakness were made strong . " '

41408	41534	41405	41405	I	0	' There was a low , deep growl of disappointment , and a hurried consultation among the men . But whether they would follow Stephen 's counsel , it was not permitted them to choose ; for suddenly a strong , bright flame burst up in a high column , like a beacon , into the midnight air , and every one gazing upwards saw in a moment that the thatch over the farthest gable had caught fire . The house itself was now burning , and the light , blazing full upon their upturned faces , revealed to Stephen the well - known features of four of his former comrades . The shout that rang from their lips was one of real alarm now . '
41543	41548	41535	41535	Stephen	19	' cried Black Thompson . '
41589	41665	41666	41666	We	1106	' What a glaring light spread through the landing ! The face of Miss Anne coming from the servant 's room shone rosy and bright in it , though she was pale with fear . Through the open window drifted a suffocating smoke of burning wood and thatch , and the crackling and splitting of the old roof sounded noisily above their voices ; but Miss Anne commanded herself , and spoke calmly to Stephen . '
41675	41679	41666	41666	We	1106	' she said ; '
41710	41877	41878	41878	I	0	' She knocked loudly at his door , and lifted up her voice to make him hear , and Stephen shouted ; but there was no answer . Without the keys of the massive locks it would not be possible to open the doors , and he had them in his own keeping ; but he gave no heed to their calls , nor the vehement screams of the frightened servant . Perhaps he had fallen into a fit ; and they had no means of entering his chamber , so securely had he fastened himself in with his gold . Stephen and Miss Anne gazed at one another in the dazzling and ominous light , but no words crossed their trembling lips . Oh , the horror of their position ! And already other voices were mingled with those of the assailants ; and every one was shouting from without , praying them to open the door , and be saved from their tremendous peril . '
41885	41892	41893	41893	they	1115	' said Mr. Wyley from within ; '
41920	41921	41900	41900	They	1115	' '
41929	41934	41900	41900	They	1115	' cried Miss Anne ; '

41959	41964	41952	41952	me	0	' said the master , '
41991	42089	41984	41984	I	0	' She prayed and expostulated in vain ; he cared little for their danger , so hardened was he by a selfish fear for himself . The fire was gaining ground quickly , for a brisk wind had sprung up , and the long - seasoned timber in the old walls burnt like touchwood . The servant lay insensible on the threshold of the master 's chamber ; and Miss Anne and Stephen looked out from a front casement upon the gathering crowd , who implored them , with frenzied earnestness , to throw open the door . '
42093	42097	41984	41984	I	0	' cried Stephen , '
42123	42124	42125	42125	I	0	' '
42129	42133	42125	42125	I	0	' she answered : '
42164	42243	42244	42244	They	1121	' She rested her head against the casement , sobbing , as though her grief could not be assuaged . Stephen felt heart - sick with his intense longing for the arrival of help from Longville , as he watched the progress of the fire ; but at last , after what appeared ages of waiting , they heard a shout in the distance , and saw a little band of horsemen galloping up to the burning house . '
42252	42257	42250	42250	uncle	1113	' cried Miss Anne . '
42279	42946	42947	42947	I	0	' He had seen their approach himself , and now he opened the doors , and gave the keys to Miss Anne . He had collected all his papers and notes in one large bundle , which he had clasped in his arms ; and as soon as the crowd swept in through the open doors , he cried aloud to the constable from Longville to come and guard him . There was very little time for saving anything out of the house , for before long the flames gathered such volume and strength as to drive every one out before them ; and as Stephen stood beside the miserable old man , who was shivering in the bitter night wind , he beheld his dwelling destroyed as suddenly and entirely as the hut at Fern 's Hollow had been . Mr. Wyley would not stir from the place where he could gaze upon his old home burning to the ground . He stood rooted to the spot , like one fascinated and enchained by a power he could not resist , grasping his precious bundle to his breast , and clinging firmly to the arm of the Longville doctor , who had been one of those who hastened to his rescue . Now and then he broke out into a deep cry , which he did not seem to hear himself ; but even the grey dawn of the morning , brightening over the rounded outlines of the mountains , did not awaken him from his trance of terror and bewilderment . Miss Anne kept near to him all night , and Stephen lingered about her , making a seat for her upon the grass , and taking care that Martha also should be at hand to wait upon her . There was a great buzzing of people about them , hurrying to and fro ; and every now and then they heard different conjectures as to how the fire began . But it was not , generally known that the constables from Longville and Botfield had contrived to arrest Black Thompson and Davies in the midst of the confusion , and had quietly taken them off to the jail at Longville . When the daylight grew strong , it shone upon a smouldering mass of ruins , and heaps of broken furniture piled upon the down - trodden grass . The master had grown aged in that one night , and he gazed helplessly about him , as if for some one to direct and guide him . He no longer refused to quit the place , only he would not trust himself anywhere near Botfield ; and as soon as a carriage could be procured , he and Miss Anne were driven off to Longville . There was nothing more to wait for now ; and Stephen went quietly home to breakfast in the cinder - hill cabin . It was a good deal later than usual that morning when the engineman at the works sent down the first skip - load of colliers into the pit . Four of their number were absent , but that excited no surprise after the events of the night ; and even Bess Thompson supposed her father had gone off to the public - house with the others . But what was the amazement of the colliers when they found Tim at the bottom of the shaft , fiercely hungry after his night 's fasting , and as fiercely anxious to hear what had been taking place overhead . He had the prudence , however , to listen to their revelations without making any of his own , and would not even explain how he came to be left behind in the pit . He went up in the ascending skip , and , escaping from the curiosity of the people on the bank , he darted as straight as an arrow to Stephen 's cabin . '
42948	42952	42959	42959	he	0	'm nigh clemmed , '
42975	42982	42983	42983	he	0	' It seems like a year , '
42986	43093	42983	42983	he	0	' thee'lt never catch me being left behind anywhere again . Eh , Stephen , lad ! many a time I shouted for fear I 'd never see daylight again ; it 's awful down there in the night . Thee hears them as thee ca n't see punning agen the coal ; and then there comes a downfall like a clap of thunder . I was n't so much afeared of little Nan : she never did any harm when she was alive ; and I thought God was too good to send her out of heaven just to terrify a poor lad like me . '
43094	43103	43105	43105	Martha	22	' But how did thee get left behind ? '
43306	43312	43313	43313	he	1125	' It was awfully lonesome , '
43316	43396	43313	43313	he	1125	' and I thought Stephen would never come , or I 'd never make him hear . It was n't much better after he had come , only for thinking Miss Anne would be safe . My lamp went out , and I reckon I said " Our Father " over a hundred times . Besides , I was wondering what was being done overhead . I 'll never be left behind anywhere again , I can tell ye . '
43397	43400	43402	43402	Stephen	19	' Well , '
43404	43439	43313	43313	he	1125	' my sheep and lambs do n't know about the fire , and I must be off . They 'll want me just as bad as if I 'd been in bed all night . '
43645	43653	43654	43654	she	48	' Oh , dear , good Stephen , '
43657	43692	43654	43654	she	48	' thee canst save father ! I 'll kneel here till thee has promised to save him . Oh , do n't bear any spite agen him , but forgive him and save him ! '
43693	43699	43701	43701	Stephen	19	' Get up , Bess , '
43704	43731	43701	43701	Stephen	19	' do n't thee kneel down to a fellow like me . I 'll do anything for thy father ; I 've no spite agen him . '
43732	43740	43741	43741	she	1146	' Oh , I knew thee would ! '
43744	43794	43741	43741	she	1146	' thee'lt tell the justice thee never saw him there till the other folks came up from Botfield . Tim says he did n't see anybody down in the pit , and he 's promised not to swear to their names . Do n't thee swear to seeing anybody . '
43795	43805	43806	43806	Stephen	19	' But I did see every one of them , '
43809	43832	43806	43806	Stephen	19	' and Tim knew all their voices ; and there 'll be lots to tell who came up in the last skip . '
43833	43844	43846	43846	Bess	48	' There 's nobody in Botfield will swear agen them , '
43848	43880	43846	43846	Bess	48	' Whose place is it to know who came up in the last skip , or who was at the fire last night ? Oh , Stephen , the Bible says we 're
43903	43904	43897	43897	thee	48	' '
43907	43911	43897	43897	thee	48	' said Tim , '
43974	43975	43969	43970	Black Thompson	31	' '
43980	43988	43969	43970	Black Thompson	31	' answered Stephen , in great distress , '
44069	44070	44085	44085	lass	548	' '
44078	44082	44073	44073	thee	1153	' urged Bess . '
44087	44091	44092	44092	I	0	' said Stephen , '
44175	44176	44177	44177	Father	28	' '
44187	44191	44177	44177	Father	28	' said Bess . '
44198	44202	44177	44177	Father	28	' he replied ; '
44245	44246	44231	44231	Bess	48	' '
44254	44265	44231	44231	Bess	48	' said Bess , bursting out into a loud crying . '
44337	44338	44325	44325	Thee	1153	' '
44341	44345	44325	44325	Thee	1153	' answered Stephen , '
44383	44826	44827	44827	Bess	48	' There was no time for further discussion , for the constable from Longville came in to conduct them before the magistrate , to give their separate evidence concerning the events of the past night . Bess went with them , weeping all the way beside them , and grieving Stephen 's heart by her tears , though she dared not speak a word in the constable 's presence . But he gave his testimony gravely and truthfully , and Tim and Martha followed his example ; and , in consequence of their joint evidence , Black Thompson and Davies were fully committed to take their trial at the next assizes , and were removed that afternoon to the county jail . Bess Thompson started off on her way to her desolate home , almost heart - broken , and with such a wrathful resentment against Stephen , and Martha , and Tim , as seemed to blot out all memory of the lessons she had been learning from Miss Anne since the little child 's death . She could never bear to go near them , or speak to them again , since they had sworn against her father ; and had not he been good to them when Stephen was ill , often sparing her to watch with Martha , as well as helping to make up his wages ? If this was their religion , she did not care to have it ; for nobody else in Botfield would have done the same . And now she might as well give up all thoughts of getting to heaven , where little Nan and her baby sister were ; for there would be nobody to care for her , and she would be obliged to go back to all her old ways . These were her bitter thoughts as she walked homewards alone , for Stephen was gone up to the doctor 's house to inquire after the master and Miss Anne , and the others were waiting for him in Longville . She heard their voices after a while coming along the turnpike road , and walking quickly as if to overtake her ; so she turned aside into a field , and hid herself under a hedge that they might pass by . She crouched down low upon the grass , and covered her red and smarting eyes from the sunshine with her shawl , and then she listened for their footsteps to die away in the distance . But she felt an arm stealing round her , and Martha 's voice whispered close in her ear , â€” '

44883	44887	44881	44881	Bess	48	' said Stephen , '

44954	44958	44947	44947	Nobody'll	1179	' cried Bess ; '

44980	45109	44978	44978	Stephen	19	' and thee has a Father in heaven that cares for thee . Listen , Bess ; it will do thee good , and poor old grandfather no harm now . He was transported beyond the seas once ; and no one casts it up to him now , nor to us ; and have n't we got friends ? Cheer up , Bess . Miss Anne says , maybe this very trouble will bring thy father to repentance . He said he 'd repent some time ; and maybe this will be the very time for him . And Miss Anne sends her kind love to thee and thy mother , and she 'll come and see thy mother as soon as she can leave the master . '
45476	45480	45483	45483	he	19	' Stephen Fern ! '
45546	45554	45555	45555	he	1205	' I am Danesford , of Danesford , '
45559	45598	45555	45555	he	1205	' and I believe you are Stephen Fern , of Fern 's Hollow . I 've brought you a message , my boy . Can you guess what young lady has sent me over the hills after you ? '
45599	45603	45605	45605	Stephen	19	' Miss Anne , '
45608	45623	45625	45626	Mr. Danesford	55	' No ; there are other young ladies in the world beside Miss Anne ! '
45628	45686	45625	45626	Mr. Danesford	55	' Have you forgotten Miss Lockwood ? She has not forgotten you ; and we are come home ready to give battle to your enemies , and reinstate you in all your rights . She gives Mr. Lockwood and me no rest until we have got Fern 's Hollow , and everything else , for you again . '
45687	45690	45692	45692	Stephen	19	' Sir , '
45701	45710	45692	45692	Stephen	19	' nobody can give me back little Nan . '
45711	45714	45716	45717	Mr. Danesford	55	' No , '
45720	45764	45716	45717	Mr. Danesford	55	' I know how hardly you have been dealt with , my boy . Tell me truly , is your religion strong enough to enable you to forgive Mr. Wyley indeed ? Is it possible that you can forgive him from your heart ? '
45849	45852	45853	45853	he	19	' Sir , '
45861	45863	45853	45853	he	19	' I 'm

45969	45978	45967	45967	Stephen	19	' said Mr. Danesford , after a pause . '
45996	45997	45981	45981	you	0	' '
46005	46009	45998	45998	I	0	' answered Stephen . '
46014	46020	46012	46012	I	0	' he said , smiling ; '
46098	46506	46080	46080	She	21	' Mr. Danesford rode on over the hills , and Stephen walked some way beside him , to put him into the nearest path for Danesford . After he was gone he watched earnestly for the evening shadows , and when they stretched far away across the plains , he hastened down to the cabin , and then on to Longville , to his appointed interview with Miss Anne . When the master at last consented to leave the sight of his old dwelling burning into blackened heaps , he seemed to care nothing where he might be taken . He was without a home , and almost without a friend . It was not accident merely , but the long - provoked hatred of his people , that had driven him from the old chambers and the old roof which had sheltered him for so many years , and where all the habits and memories of his life centred . Miss Anne had not been long enough at Botfield to form friendships on her own account , except among the poor and ignorant people on her uncle 's works ; and she accepted most thankfully the offer of the doctor from Longville to give them a refuge in his house . No sooner had they arrived there than it was discovered that the master was struck with paralysis , brought on by the shock of the fire , and all the terrifying circumstances attending it . He was carried at once to a bedroom , and from that time Miss Anne had been fully occupied in nursing him . He had seemed to be getting better the last day or two , and his power of speech had returned , though he spoke but rarely ; only following Miss Anne 's movements with earnest eyes , and hardly suffering her to leave him , even for necessary rest and refreshment . All that afternoon he had been tossing his restless head from side to side , uttering deep , low groans , and murmuring now and then to himself words which Miss Anne could not understand . She looked white and ill herself , as if her strength were nearly exhausted ; but after the doctor had been in , and , feeling the master 's pulse , shook his head solemnly , she would not consent to leave his bedside for any length of time . '
46510	46525	46080	46080	She	21	' she whispered , going with the doctor to the outside of the door . '
46534	46539	46080	46080	She	21	' was the answer . '
46548	46553	46541	46541	he	1216	' she asked again . '
46560	46565	46541	46541	he	1216	' replied the doctor , '
46571	46696	46541	46541	he	1216	' Only twenty - four hours ! One day of swiftly - passing time , and then the eternal future ! One more sun - setting , and one more sun - rising , and then everlasting night , or eternal day ! For a minute Miss Anne leaned against the doorway , with a fainting spirit . There was so much to do , and so short a space for doing anything . All the real business of the whole life had to be crowded into these few hours , if possible . As she entered the room , her uncle 's eyes met hers with a glance of unspeakable anguish , and he called her in a trembling tone to her side . '
46700	46704	46541	46541	he	1216	' he whispered . '
46713	46714	46541	46541	he	1216	' '
46719	46723	46541	46541	he	1216	' she said , '

46787	46791	46792	46792	I	0	' he answered ; '

46886	46898	46884	46884	Uncle	1224	' she said , commanding her voice with a great effort , '
46974	46975	46961	46961	Him	1225	' '
46978	46984	46961	46961	Him	1225	' groaned the dying man , '

47068	47073	47066	47066	Uncle	1231	' said Miss Anne , '
47150	47151	47152	47152	Anne	21	' '
47154	47166	47152	47152	Anne	21	' he answered , fixing on her a look of despair , '
47223	47292	47293	47293	Anne	21	' Miss Anne sank down by the bedside , unable to answer him , save by a prayer , half aloud , to God for His mercy to be shown to him , if it were possible ! He lay there , helpless and hopeless , tossing to and fro upon the pillows . At last he spoke again , in a sharp , clear , energetic tone . '
47298	47302	47293	47293	Anne	21	' he said ; '
47325	47395	47293	47293	Anne	21	' He watched her with impatient eagerness as she turned over the precious parcel of papers which he had rescued from the fire . There were many documents and writings belonging to the property he had gathered together , and it was some time before she could find the will . The master tried to take it from her , but in vain ; his right hand was powerless . '
47401	47406	47293	47293	Anne	21	' he cried despairingly ; '
47492	47703	47489	47490	Stephen Fern	19	' Miss Anne sent a messenger to hasten Stephen ; and after that the master lay perfectly still , with closed eyes , as if he were treasuring up the little strength remaining to him . The last sunset was over , and the night - lamp was lighted once more ; while Miss Anne sat beside him watching , in an agony of prayer to God . There was no sound to be heard , for every one in the house knew that the old man was dying , and they kept a profound quietness throughout all the rooms . He had taken no notice of anything since he asked for Stephen ; but when a light rap was heard at the door he opened his eyes , and turned his grey head round anxiously to see whether he was come . It was Stephen . He stood within the doorway , not liking to enter farther , but looking straight forward at the master with a very pale and sorrowful face , upon which there was no trace of triumph or hatred . Miss Anne gazed earnestly at him , but she did not speak ; she would not place herself between him and his dying enemy now . '
47709	47721	47707	47707	Stephen	19	' said the master , in a voice of hopeless agony . '

47817	47821	47815	47815	master	251	' exclaimed Stephen , '

47875	47883	47871	47871	you	251	' asked the master , in astonishment . '
47886	47890	47871	47871	you	251	' he cried , '

48036	48064	48065	48065	I	0	' he said ; and his eyelids closed feebly , and his restless head lay still , as if he had no more power to move it . '
48069	48073	48074	48074	I	0	' answered Stephen ; '
48075	48100	48116	48117	the master	179	'm only a poor lad , and I do n't know how to do it up loud . Miss Anne will pray for thee . '
48101	48114	48116	48117	the master	179	' If you have forgiven me , pray to God for me , '
48194	48205	48187	48187	he	19	' Lord , lay not this sin to his charge . '

48712	48716	48718	48719	Mr. Lockwood	49	' My boy , '
48721	48885	48718	48719	Mr. Lockwood	49	' our business is finished at last . Mr. Thomas Wyley will not try his right to Fern 's Hollow by law ; but we have agreed to give him the Â£ 15 paid to your grandfather , and also to pay to him all the actual cost of the work done here . Miss Anne and I have had a quarrel on the subject , but she consents that I shall pay that as a mark of my esteem for you , and my old servant your mother . Mr. Danesford intends to make a gift to you of the pasture and plantation , which were an encroachment upon the manor . And now I want you to take my advice into the bargain . Jackson wants to come here , and offers a rent of Â£ 20 a year for the place . Will you let him have it till you are old enough to manage it properly yourself , Stephen ? '
48886	48895	48897	48897	Stephen	19	' Yes , if you please , sir , '
48921	48934	48936	48937	Mr. Lockwood	49	' Jackson will make a tidy little farm of it for you , '
48939	48978	48936	48937	Mr. Lockwood	49	' My daughter proposes taking Martha into her service , and putting her into the way of learning dairy - work , and many other things of which she is now ignorant . Are you willing , Martha ? '
48979	48985	48987	48987	Martha	22	' Oh yes , sir ! '
48999	49006	49007	49008	Mr. Lockwood	49	' In this case , Stephen , '
49012	49036	49007	49008	Mr. Lockwood	49	' you will have a yearly income of Â£ 20 , and we would like to hear what you will do with it ? '
49037	49042	49044	49044	Stephen	19	' There 's grandfather , '
49047	49053	49055	49056	Mr. Lockwood	49	' Right , my boy ! '
49064	49132	49055	49056	Mr. Lockwood	49	' well , Miss Anne thinks he would be very comfortable with Mrs. Thompson , and she would be glad of a little money with him . But he can not live much longer , Stephen ; he is very aged , and the doctor thinks he will hardly get over the autumn . So we had better settle what shall be done after grandfather is gone . '
49133	49136	49138	49138	Stephen	19	' Sir , '
49140	49173	49055	49056	Mr. Lockwood	49	' I think Martha should have some good of grandmother 's work , if she is only a girl . So had n't the rent better be saved up for her till I 'm
49184	49230	49182	49182	myself	0	' Every face in the room glowed with approbation of Stephen 's suggestion ; and Martha flushed crimson at the very thought of possessing so much money ; and visions of future greatness , more than her grandmother had foreseen , passed before her mind . '
49240	49245	49237	49238	an heiress	1280	' said Mr. Lockwood . '

49364	49367	49369	49370	Miss Anne	21	' No , '
49393	49553	49387	49388	little Nan	21	' Stephen is my dear friend , and he must let me act the part of a friend towards him . I wish to send him to live with a good man whom I know , the manager of one of the great works at Netley , where he may learn everything that will be necessary to become my bailiff . I shall want a true , trustworthy agent to look after my interests here , and in a few years Stephen will be old enough to do this for me . He shall attend a good school for a few hours daily , to gain a fitting education ; and then what servant could I find more faithful , more true , and more loving than my dear friend Stephen ? He can come back here then , if he chooses , and perhaps have Martha for his housekeeper , in their old home at Fern 's Hollow . '
49554	49560	49562	49562	Stephen	19	' Oh , Miss Anne ! '
49564	49581	49562	49562	Stephen	19	' I can not bear it ! May I really be your servant all my life ? '

49605	49709	49599	49603	the lord of the manor	94	' I want you to show us some of your old haunts on the hills . If Miss Anne had not formed a better plan , I should have proposed making you my gamekeeper ; for Jones has been telling me about the grouse last year . By the way , if I had thought it would be any pleasure to you , I should have dismissed him from my service for his share in this business ; but I knew you would be for begging him in again , so I only told him pretty strongly what a sneak I thought him .

50007	50012	50013	50013	she	21	' My dear boy , '
50016	50034	50013	50013	she	21	' are you taking care to say to yourself , " I am an unprofitable servant " ? '
50035	50048	50049	50049	he	19	' I have not done all those things which are commanded me , '
50055	50084	50049	50049	he	19	' I 've done nothing of myself yet . It 's you that have taught me , Miss Anne ; and God has helped me to learn . I 'm

50109	50112	50113	50114	Miss Anne	21	' Stephen , '
50117	50189	50113	50114	Miss Anne	21	' you have forgiven all your enemies : Tim , who is now your friend , and the gamekeeper , Black Thompson , and my poor uncle ; when you are saying the Lord 's Prayer , do you feel as if you should be satisfied for our Father to forgive you your trespasses in the same measure and in the same manner as you have forgiven their trespasses against you ? '
50190	50194	50196	50196	Stephen	19	' Oh no ! '
50205	50211	50196	50196	Stephen	19	' Tell me why not . '
50212	50222	50223	50223	he	19	' It was a rather hard thing for me , '
50226	50281	50223	50223	he	19	' it was very hard at first , and I had to be persuaded to it ; and every now and then I felt as if I 'd take the forgiveness back . I should n't like to feel as if our Father found it a hard thing , or repented of it afterwards . '
50282	50285	50287	50288	Miss Anne	21	' No , '
50290	50417	50223	50223	he	19	' He is a God " ready to pardon ; " and when He has bestowed forgiveness , His " gifts and calling are without repentance . " But there is something more , Stephen . Do you not seem in your own mind to know them , and remember them most , by their unkindness and sins towards you ? When you think of Black Thompson , is it not more as one who has been your enemy than one whom you love without any remembrance of his faults ? And you recollect my uncle as him who drove you away from your own home , and was the cause of little Nan 's death . Their offences are forgiven fully , but not forgotten . '
50418	50423	50425	50425	Stephen	19	' Can I forget ? '
50427	50430	50431	50431	she	1303	' No , '
50434	50478	50431	50431	she	1303	' but do you not see that we clothe our enemies with their faults against us ? Should our Father do so , should we stand before Him bearing in His sight all our sins , would that forgiveness content us , Stephen ? '

50488	50505	50484	50484	he	19	' Tell me , Miss Anne , what will He do for me besides forgiving me ? '

50547	50645	50512	50512	she	1304	' listen : " As far as the east is from the west , so far hath He removed our transgressions from us . " And again : " He will turn again , He will have compassion upon us ; He will subdue our iniquities ; and Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea . " And again : " For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness , and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more . " This is the forgiveness of our Father , Stephen . '
50646	50654	50656	50656	Stephen	19	' Oh , how different to mine ! '
50665	50668	50670	50671	Miss Anne	21	' Yet , '
50673	50722	50670	50671	Miss Anne	21	' you may claim the promise made to us by our Lord : " If ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you , " in a far richer measure , with infinite long - suffering , and a multitude of tender mercies . '
50723	50735	50737	50737	Stephen	19	' Lord , forgive me , for Jesus Christ 's sake ! '
