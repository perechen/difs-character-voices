1615	1617	1608	1611	an amiable handsome baronet	883	" Exactly "
1990	2047	1973	1973	Celia	169	" Dorothea , dear , if you do n't mind — if you are not very busy — suppose we looked at mamma 's jewels to - day , and divided them ? It is exactly six months to - day since uncle gave them to you , and you have not looked at them yet . "
2110	2130	2106	2106	she	168	" What a wonderful little almanac you are , Celia ! Is it six calendar or six lunar months ? "
2131	2186	2106	2106	she	168	" It is the last day of September now , and it was the first of April when uncle gave them to you . You know , he said that he had forgotten them till then . I believe you have never thought of them since you locked them up in the cabinet here . "
2187	2201	2202	2202	Dorothea	189	" Well , dear , we should never wear them , you know . "
2243	2272	2273	2273	she	168	" I think , dear , we are wanting in respect to mamma 's memory , to put them by and take no notice of them . And , "
2288	2330	2273	2273	she	168	" necklaces are quite usual now ; and Madame Poincon , who was stricter in some things even than you are , used to wear ornaments . And Christians generally — surely there are women in heaven now who wore jewels . "
2346	2354	2356	2356	Dorothea	189	" You would like to wear them ? "
2385	2412	2413	2413	She	168	" Of course , then , let us have them out . Why did you not tell me before ? But the keys , the keys ! "
2431	2436	2438	2438	Celia	169	" They are here , "
2451	2468	2438	2438	Celia	169	" Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel - box . "
2595	2620	2621	2621	Celia	169	" There , Celia ! you can wear that with your Indian muslin . But this cross you must wear with your dark dresses . "
2630	2641	2621	2621	Celia	169	" O Dodo , you must keep the cross yourself . "
2642	2651	2653	2653	Dorothea	189	" No , no , dear , no , "
2663	2682	2684	2684	Celia	169	" Yes , indeed you must ; it would suit you — in your black dress , now , "
2688	2694	2684	2684	Celia	169	" You might wear that . "
2695	2719	2720	2720	Dorothea	189	" Not for the world , not for the world . A cross is the last thing I would wear as a trinket . "
2724	2737	2739	2739	Celia	169	" Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it , "
2743	2750	2752	2752	Dorothea	189	" No , dear , no , "
2760	2775	2752	2752	Dorothea	189	" Souls have complexions too : what will suit one will not suit another . "
2776	2789	2720	2720	Dorothea	189	" But you might like to keep it for mamma 's sake . "
2790	2840	2841	2841	Celia	169	" No , I have other things of mamma's — her sandal - wood box which I am so fond of — plenty of things . In fact , they are all yours , dear . We need discuss them no longer . There — take away your property . "
2875	2896	2871	2873	a Puritanic persecution	918	" But how can I wear ornaments if you , who are the elder sister , will never wear them ? "
2897	2959	2960	2960	Celia	169	" Nay , Celia , that is too much to ask , that I should wear trinkets to keep you in countenance . If I were to put on such a necklace as that , I should feel as if I had been pirouetting . The world would go round with me , and I should not know how to walk . "
2970	2992	2993	2993	she	169	" It would be a little tight for your neck ; something to lie down and hang would suit you better , "
3054	3062	3064	3064	Dorothea	189	" How very beautiful these gems are ! "
3079	3133	3064	3064	Dorothea	189	" It is strange how deeply colours seem to penetrate one , like scent . I suppose that is the reason why gems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John . They look like fragments of heaven . I think that emerald is more beautiful than any of them . "
3134	3144	3146	3146	Celia	169	" And there is a bracelet to match it , "
3148	3157	3146	3146	Celia	169	" We did not notice this at first . "
3158	3163	3165	3165	Dorothea	189	" They are lovely , "
3216	3224	3226	3226	Celia	169	" You would like those , Dorothea , "
3258	3282	3332	3332	She	169	" You must keep that ring and bracelet — if nothing else . But see , these agates are very pretty and quiet . "
3283	3296	3298	3298	Dorothea	189	" Yes ! I will keep these — this ring and bracelet , "
3314	3331	3310	3310	she	169	tone—"Yet what miserable men find such things , and work at them , and sell them ! "
3357	3367	3369	3369	Dorothea	189	" Yes , dear , I will keep these , "
3373	3385	3369	3369	Dorothea	189	" But take all the rest away , and the casket . "
3423	3431	3433	3433	Celia	169	" Shall you wear them in company ? "
3502	3505	3506	3506	she	169	" Perhaps , "
3512	3524	3506	3506	she	169	" I can not tell to what level I may sink . "
3667	3678	3680	3680	Celia	169	" I am sure — at least , I trust , "
3682	3736	3680	3680	Celia	169	" that the wearing of a necklace will not interfere with my prayers . And I do not see that I should be bound by Dorothea 's opinions now we are going into society , though of course she herself ought to be bound by them . But Dorothea is not always consistent . "
3754	3785	3752	3752	her	169	" Here , Kitty , come and look at my plan ; I shall think I am a great architect , if I have not got incompatible stairs and fireplaces . "
3869	3874	3876	3877	Mr. Brooke	175	" Sir Humphry Davy ? "
3905	4018	3884	3884	his	175	" Well , now , Sir Humphry Davy ; I dined with him years ago at Cartwright 's , and Wordsworth was there too — the poet Wordsworth , you know . Now there was something singular . I was at Cambridge when Wordsworth was there , and I never met him — and I dined with him twenty years afterwards at Cartwright 's . There 's an oddity in things , now . But Davy was there : he was a poet too . Or , as I may say , Wordsworth was poet one , and Davy was poet two . That was true in every sense , you know . "
4136	4144	4146	4148	this excellent baronet	934	" I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry , "
4150	4194	4146	4148	this excellent baronet	934	" because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands , and see if something can not be done in setting a good pattern of farming among my tenants . Do you approve of that , Miss Brooke ? "
4195	4202	4204	4205	Mr. Brooke	175	" A great mistake , Chettam , "
4207	4323	4204	4205	Mr. Brooke	175	" going into electrifying your land and that kind of thing , and making a parlor of your cow - house . It wo n't do . I went into science a great deal myself at one time ; but I saw it would not do . It leads to everything ; you can let nothing alone . No , no — see that your tenants do n't sell their straw , and that kind of thing ; and give them draining - tiles , you know . But your fancy farming will not do — the most expensive sort of whistle you can buy : you may as well keep a pack of hounds . "
4324	4327	4329	4329	Dorothea	189	" Surely , "
4331	4385	4329	4329	Dorothea	189	" it is better to spend money in finding out how men can make the most of the land which supports them all , than in keeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it . It is not a sin to make yourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all . "
4460	4472	4474	4475	Mr. Brooke	175	" Young ladies do n't understand political economy , you know , "
4482	4646	4474	4475	Mr. Brooke	175	" I remember when we were all reading Adam Smith . There is a book , now . I took in all the new ideas at one time — human perfectibility , now . But some say , history moves in circles ; and that may be very well argued ; I have argued it myself . The fact is , human reason may carry you a little too far — over the hedge , in fact . It carried me a good way at one time ; but I saw it would not do . I pulled up ; I pulled up in time . But not too hard . I have always been in favour of a little theory : we must have Thought ; else we shall be landed back in the dark ages . But talking of books , there is Southey 's ' Peninsular War . ' I am reading that of a morning . You know Southey ? "
4647	4650	4652	4653	Mr. Casaubon	189	" No , "
4672	4800	4474	4475	Mr. Brooke	175	" I have little leisure for such literature just now . I have been using up my eyesight on old characters lately ; the fact is , I want a reader for my evenings ; but I am fastidious in voices , and I can not endure listening to an imperfect reader . It is a misfortune , in some senses : I feed too much on the inward sources ; I live too much with the dead . My mind is something like the ghost of an ancient , wandering about the world and trying mentally to construct it as it used to be , in spite of ruin and confusing changes . But I find it necessary to use the utmost caution about my eyesight . "
4981	4992	4993	4994	Sir James	177	" But you are fond of riding , Miss Brooke , "
5002	5077	4993	4994	Sir James	177	" I should have thought you would enter a little into the pleasures of hunting . I wish you would let me send over a chestnut horse for you to try . It has been trained for a lady . I saw you on Saturday cantering over the hill on a nag not worthy of you . My groom shall bring Corydon for you every day , if you will only mention the time . "
5078	5101	5103	5103	Dorothea	189	" Thank you , you are very good . I mean to give up riding . I shall not ride any more , "
5133	5141	5143	5144	Sir James	177	" No , that is too hard , "
5156	5170	5171	5171	he	177	" Your sister is given to self - mortification , is she not ? "
5185	5191	5193	5193	Celia	169	" I think she is , "
5219	5225	5193	5193	Celia	169	" She likes giving up . "
5226	5265	5267	5267	Dorothea	189	" If that were true , Celia , my giving - up would be self - indulgence , not self - mortification . But there may be good reasons for choosing not to do what is very agreeable , "
5296	5299	5301	5302	Sir James	177	" Exactly , "
5304	5315	5301	5302	Sir James	177	" You give up from some high , generous motive . "
5316	5332	5334	5334	Dorothea	189	" No , indeed , not exactly . I did not say that of myself , "
5469	5481	5483	5484	Mr. Brooke	175	" I made a great study of theology at one time , "
5495	5516	5483	5484	Mr. Brooke	175	" I know something of all schools . I knew Wilberforce in his best days . Do you know Wilberforce ? "
5521	5524	5517	5518	Mr. Casaubon	189	" No . "
5525	5569	5570	5571	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Well , Wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker ; but if I went into Parliament , as I have been asked to do , I should sit on the independent bench , as Wilberforce did , and work at philanthropy . "
5583	5586	5588	5589	Mr. Brooke	175	" Yes , "
5596	5651	5588	5589	Mr. Brooke	175	" but I have documents . I began a long while ago to collect documents . They want arranging , but when a question has struck me , I have written to somebody and got an answer . I have documents at my back . But now , how do you arrange your documents ? "
5652	5659	5661	5662	Mr. Casaubon	189	" In pigeon - holes partly , "
5672	5709	5661	5662	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Ah , pigeon - holes will not do . I have tried pigeon - holes , but everything gets mixed in pigeon - holes : I never know whether a paper is in A or Z. "
5710	5725	5727	5727	Dorothea	189	" I wish you would let me sort your papers for you , uncle , "
5729	5747	5727	5727	Dorothea	189	" I would letter them all , and then make a list of subjects under each letter . "
5760	5772	5757	5758	Mr. Brooke	175	" You have an excellent secretary at hand , you perceive . "
5773	5778	5780	5781	Mr. Brooke	175	" No , no , "
5787	5805	5784	5784	his	175	" I can not let young ladies meddle with my documents . Young ladies are too flighty . "
5875	5883	5872	5872	Celia	169	" How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is ! "
5884	5919	5872	5872	Celia	169	" Celia ! He is one of the most distinguished - looking men I ever saw . He is remarkably like the portrait of Locke . He has the same deep eye - sockets . "
5920	5932	5872	5872	Celia	169	" Had Locke those two white moles with hairs on them ? "
5933	5950	5952	5952	Dorothea	189	" Oh , I dare say ! when people of a certain sort looked at him , "
5959	5966	5952	5952	Dorothea	189	" Mr. Casaubon is so sallow . "
5967	5987	5872	5872	Celia	169	" All the better . I suppose you admire a man with the complexion of a cochon de lait . "
5988	5991	5993	5993	Celia	169	" Dodo ! "
6001	6012	5993	5993	Celia	169	" I never heard you make such a comparison before . "
6013	6035	6036	6037	Miss Brooke	168	" Why should I make it before the occasion came ? It is a good comparison : the match is perfect . "
6048	6057	6036	6037	Miss Brooke	168	" I wonder you show temper , Dorothea . "
6058	6097	5993	5993	Celia	169	" It is so painful in you , Celia , that you will look at human beings as if they were merely animals with a toilet , and never see the great soul in a man 's face . "
6098	6106	6107	6107	Celia	169	" Has Mr. Casaubon a great soul ? "
6117	6125	6127	6127	Dorothea	189	" Yes , I believe he has , "
6136	6150	6127	6127	Dorothea	189	" Everything I see in him corresponds to his pamphlet on Biblical Cosmology . "
6151	6157	6159	6159	Celia	169	" He talks very little , "
6160	6171	6172	6172	Celia	169	" There is no one for him to talk to . "
6176	6192	6172	6172	Celia	169	" Dorothea quite despises Sir James Chettam ; I believe she would not accept him . "
6418	6424	6414	6414	he	177	" What shall we do ? "
6623	6640	6642	6644	the persevering admirer	968	" Let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse , Miss Brooke , "
6646	6659	6642	6644	the persevering admirer	968	" I assure you , riding is the most healthy of exercises . "
6660	6667	6669	6669	Dorothea	189	" I am aware of it , "
6673	6689	6669	6669	Dorothea	189	" I think it would do Celia good — if she would take to it . "
6690	6699	6642	6644	the persevering admirer	968	" But you are such a perfect horsewoman . "
6700	6718	6642	6644	the persevering admirer	968	" Excuse me ; I have had very little practice , and I should be easily thrown . "
6719	6745	6669	6669	Dorothea	189	" Then that is a reason for more practice . Every lady ought to be a perfect horsewoman , that she may accompany her husband . "
6746	6786	6787	6787	Dorothea	189	" You see how widely we differ , Sir James . I have made up my mind that I ought not to be a perfect horsewoman , and so I should never correspond to your pattern of a lady . "
6820	6844	6787	6787	Dorothea	189	" I should like to know your reasons for this cruel resolution . It is not possible that you should think horsemanship wrong . "
6845	6859	6909	6909	his	189	" It is quite possible that I should think it wrong for me . "
6860	6865	6867	6868	Sir James	177	" Oh , why ? "
6894	6904	6905	6905	he	189	" We must not inquire too curiously into motives , "
6913	6948	6909	6909	his	189	" Miss Brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in the utterance : the aroma is mixed with the grosser air . We must keep the germinating grain away from the light . "
7062	7065	7067	7069	good Sir James	177	" Certainly , "
7071	7098	7099	7099	He	177	" Miss Brooke shall not be urged to tell reasons she would rather be silent upon . I am sure her reasons would do her honour . "
7468	7472	7460	7460	he	189	" affable archangel ; "
7705	7723	7665	7665	he	189	" lords , knyghtes , and other noble and worthi men , that conne Latyn but lytille . "
7902	7908	7910	7910	Dorothea	189	" He thinks with me , "
7914	7952	7910	7910	Dorothea	189	" or rather , he thinks a whole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror . And his feelings too , his whole experience — what a lake compared with my little pool ! "
8190	8198	8304	8304	his	175	" Yes , now , but here ! "
8215	8297	8298	8299	Mr. Brooke	175	" Look here — here is all about Greece . Rhamnus , the ruins of Rhamnus — you are a great Grecian , now . I do n't know whether you have given much study to the topography . I spent no end of time in making out these things — Helicon , now . Here , now!—'We started the next morning for Parnassus , the double - peaked Parnassus . ' All this volume is about Greece , you know , "
9403	9408	9373	9373	she	1047	" Female Scripture Characters , "
9657	9664	9665	9665	she	1047	" I should learn everything then , "
9681	9852	9665	9665	she	1047	" It would be my duty to study that I might help him the better in his great works . There would be nothing trivial about our lives . Every - day things with us would mean the greatest things . It would be like marrying Pascal . I should learn to see the truth by the same light as great men have seen it by . And then I should know what to do , when I got older : I should see how it was possible to lead a grand life here — now — in England . I do n't feel sure about doing good in any way now : everything seems like going on a mission to a people whose language I do n't know;—unless it were building good cottages — there can be no doubt about that . Oh , I hope I should be able to get the people well housed in Lowick ! I will draw plenty of plans while I have time . "
9966	9976	9977	9977	he	177	" How delightful to meet you , Miss Brooke , "
9991	10003	9977	9977	he	177	" It has hastened the pleasure I was looking forward to . "
10161	10169	10170	10170	he	177	" I have brought a little petitioner , "
10173	10194	10170	10170	he	177	" or rather , I have brought him to see if he will be approved before his petition is offered . "
10219	10236	10238	10238	Dorothea	189	" It is painful to me to see these creatures that are bred merely as pets , "
10259	10264	10266	10267	Sir James	177	" Oh , why ? "
10274	10355	10266	10267	Sir James	177	" I believe all the petting that is given them does not make them happy . They are too helpless : their lives are too frail . A weasel or a mouse that gets its own living is more interesting . I like to think that the animals about us have souls something like our own , and either carry on their own little affairs or can be companions to us , like Monk here . Those creatures are parasitic . "
10356	10370	10372	10374	good Sir James	177	" I am so glad I know that you do not like them , "
10376	10406	10372	10374	good Sir James	177	" I should never keep them for myself , but ladies usually are fond of these Maltese dogs . Here , John , take this dog , will you ? "
10448	10503	10441	10441	she	168	" You must not judge of Celia 's feeling from mine . I think she likes these small pets . She had a tiny terrier once , which she was very fond of . It made me unhappy , because I was afraid of treading on it . I am rather short - sighted . "
10504	10524	10441	10441	she	168	" You have your own opinion about everything , Miss Brooke , and it is always a good opinion . "
10534	10544	10545	10546	Sir James	177	" Do you know , I envy you that , "
10562	10572	10545	10546	Sir James	177	" I do n't quite understand what you mean . "
10573	10623	10441	10441	she	168	" Your power of forming an opinion . I can form an opinion of persons . I know when I like people . But about other matters , do you know , I have often a difficulty in deciding . One hears very sensible things said on opposite sides . "
10624	10641	10645	10645	she	1076	" Or that seem sensible . Perhaps we do n't always discriminate between sense and nonsense . "
10650	10653	10655	10656	Sir James	177	" Exactly , "
10658	10669	10655	10656	Sir James	177	" But you seem to have the power of discrimination . "
10670	10705	10441	10441	she	168	" On the contrary , I am often unable to decide . But that is from ignorance . The right conclusion is there all the same , though I am unable to see it . "
10706	10872	10441	10441	she	168	" I think there are few who would see it more readily . Do you know , Lovegood was telling me yesterday that you had the best notion in the world of a plan for cottages — quite wonderful for a young lady , he thought . You had a real genus , to use his expression . He said you wanted Mr. Brooke to build a new set of cottages , but he seemed to think it hardly probable that your uncle would consent . Do you know , that is one of the things I wish to do — I mean , on my own estate . I should be so glad to carry out that plan of yours , if you would let me see it . Of course , it is sinking money ; that is why people object to it . labourers can never pay rent to make it answer . But , after all , it is worth doing . "
10873	10881	10883	10883	Dorothea	189	" Worth doing ! yes , indeed , "
10893	10955	10883	10883	Dorothea	189	" I think we deserve to be beaten out of our beautiful houses with a scourge of small cords — all of us who let tenants live in such sties as we see round us . Life in cottages might be happier than ours , if they were real houses fit for human beings from whom we expect duties and affections . "
10956	10964	10441	10441	she	168	" Will you show me your plan ? "
10965	11037	10441	10441	she	168	" Yes , certainly . I dare say it is very faulty . But I have been examining all the plans for cottages in Loudon 's book , and picked out what seem the best things . Oh what a happiness it would be to set the pattern about here ! I think instead of Lazarus at the gate , we should put the pigsty cottages outside the park - gate . "
11206	11264	11189	11189	Celia	169	" He thinks that Dodo cares about him , and she only cares about her plans . Yet I am not certain that she would refuse him if she thought he would let her manage everything and carry out all her notions . And how very uncomfortable Sir James would be ! I can not bear notions . "
12063	12066	12060	12061	Sir James	177	" Exactly , "
12229	12240	12242	12242	Celia	169	" Sir James seems determined to do everything you wish , "
12259	12275	12277	12277	Dorothea	189	" He is a good creature , and more sensible than any one would imagine , "
12281	12289	12277	12277	Dorothea	189	" You mean that he appears silly . "
12290	12295	12297	12297	Dorothea	189	" No , no , "
12313	12325	12304	12304	her	169	" but he does not talk equally well on all subjects . "
12326	12336	12338	12338	Celia	169	" I should think none but disagreeable people do , "
12346	12365	12341	12341	her	169	" They must be very dreadful to live with . Only think ! at breakfast , and always . "
12369	12379	12366	12366	Dorothea	189	" O Kitty , you are a wonderful creature ! "
12428	12454	12380	12380	She	169	" Of course people need not be always talking well . Only one tells the quality of their minds when they try to talk well . "
12455	12465	12380	12380	She	169	" You mean that Sir James tries and fails . "
12466	12493	12380	12380	She	169	" I was speaking generally . Why do you catechise me about Sir James ? It is not the object of his life to please me . "
12494	12505	12380	12380	She	169	" Now , Dodo , can you really believe that ? "
12506	12522	12380	12380	She	169	" Certainly . He thinks of me as a future sister — that is all . "
12564	12610	12556	12556	Celia	169	" Pray do not make that mistake any longer , Dodo . When Tantripp was brushing my hair the other day , she said that Sir James 's man knew from Mrs. Cadwallader 's maid that Sir James was to marry the eldest Miss Brooke . "
12611	12625	12627	12627	Dorothea	189	" How can you let Tantripp talk such gossip to you , Celia ? "
12650	12662	12627	12627	Dorothea	189	" You must have asked her questions . It is degrading . "
12663	12758	12627	12627	Dorothea	189	" I see no harm at all in Tantripp 's talking to me . It is better to hear what people say . You see what mistakes you make by taking up notions . I am quite sure that Sir James means to make you an offer ; and he believes that you will accept him , especially since you have been so pleased with him about the plans . And uncle too — I know he expects it . Every one can see that Sir James is very much in love with you . "
12813	12820	12821	12821	she	1114	" How could he expect it ? "
12830	12851	12821	12821	she	1114	" I have never agreed with him about anything but the cottages : I was barely polite to him before . "
12852	12878	12821	12821	she	1114	" But you have been so pleased with him since then ; he has begun to feel quite sure that you are fond of him . "
12879	12894	12896	12896	Dorothea	189	" Fond of him , Celia ! How can you choose such odious expressions ? "
12900	12927	12896	12896	Dorothea	189	" Dear me , Dorothea , I suppose it would be right for you to be fond of a man whom you accepted for a husband . "
12928	12971	12821	12821	she	1114	" It is offensive to me to say that Sir James could think I was fond of him . Besides , it is not the right word for the feeling I must have towards the man I would accept as a husband . "
12972	13044	12896	12896	Dorothea	189	" Well , I am sorry for Sir James . I thought it right to tell you , because you went on as you always do , never looking just where you are , and treading in the wrong place . You always see what nobody else sees ; it is impossible to satisfy you ; yet you never see what is quite plain . That 's your way , Dodo . "
13086	13092	13094	13094	Dorothea	189	" It is very painful , "
13099	13136	13094	13094	Dorothea	189	" I can have no more to do with the cottages . I must be uncivil to him . I must tell him I will have nothing to do with them . It is very painful . "
13144	13176	13094	13094	Dorothea	189	" Wait a little . Think about it . You know he is going away for a day or two to see his sister . There will be nobody besides Lovegood . "
13183	13187	13188	13188	she	169	" Poor Dodo , "
13197	13212	13188	13188	she	169	" It is very hard : it is your favourite fad to draw plans . "
13213	13260	13188	13188	she	169	" Fad to draw plans ! Do you think I only care about my fellow - creatures ' houses in that childish way ? I may well make mistakes . How can one ever do anything nobly Christian , living among people with such petty thoughts ? "
13339	13344	13289	13289	She	169	" Pilgrim 's Progress . "
13475	13481	13482	13482	he	1120	" Well , my dears , "
13495	13508	13482	13482	he	1120	" I hope nothing disagreeable has happened while I have been away . "
13509	13514	13516	13516	Celia	169	" No , uncle , "
13518	13541	13482	13482	he	1120	" we have been to Freshitt to look at the cottages . We thought you would have been at home to lunch . "
13542	13588	13482	13482	he	1120	" I came by Lowick to lunch — you did n't know I came by Lowick . And I have brought a couple of pamphlets for you , Dorothea — in the library , you know ; they lie on the table in the library . "
13847	13857	13876	13876	his	175	" I came back by Lowick , you know , "
13900	13937	13938	13938	Dorothea	189	" I lunched there and saw Casaubon 's library , and that kind of thing . There 's a sharp air , driving . Wo n't you sit down , my dear ? You look cold . "
14063	14077	14054	14054	She	218	" What news have you brought about the sheep - stealer , uncle ? "
14078	14099	14100	14100	Dorothea	189	" What , poor Bunch?—well , it seems we ca n't get him off — he is to be hanged . "
14111	14117	14119	14120	Mr. Brooke	175	" Hanged , you know , "
14127	14161	14119	14120	Mr. Brooke	175	" Poor Romilly ! he would have helped us . I knew Romilly . Casaubon did n't know Romilly . He is a little buried in books , you know , Casaubon is . "
14162	14196	14054	14054	She	218	" When a man has great studies and is writing a great work , he must of course give up seeing much of the world . How can he go about making acquaintances ? "
14197	14269	14054	14054	She	218	" That 's true . But a man mopes , you know . I have always been a bachelor too , but I have that sort of disposition that I never moped ; it was my way to go about everywhere and take in everything . I never moped : but I can see that Casaubon does , you know . He wants a companion — a companion , you know . "
14270	14285	14287	14287	Dorothea	189	" It would be a great honour to any one to be his companion , "
14291	14298	14300	14301	Mr. Brooke	175	" You like him , eh ? "
14312	14385	14300	14301	Mr. Brooke	175	" Well , now , I 've known Casaubon ten years , ever since he came to Lowick . But I never got anything out of him — any ideas , you know . However , he is a tiptop man and may be a bishop — that kind of thing , you know , if Peel stays in . And he has a very high opinion of you , my dear . "
14391	14516	14518	14519	Mr. Brooke	175	" The fact is , he has a very high opinion indeed of you . And he speaks uncommonly well — does Casaubon . He has deferred to me , you not being of age . In short , I have promised to speak to you , though I told him I thought there was not much chance . I was bound to tell him that . I said , my niece is very young , and that kind of thing . But I did n't think it necessary to go into everything . However , the long and the short of it is , that he has asked my permission to make you an offer of marriage — of marriage , you know , "
14526	14538	14522	14522	his	175	" I thought it better to tell you , my dear . "
14617	14629	14614	14614	he	175	" I thought it better to tell you , my dear . "
14630	14636	14638	14638	Dorothea	189	" Thank you , uncle , "
14646	14680	14638	14638	Dorothea	189	" I am very grateful to Mr. Casaubon . If he makes me an offer , I shall accept him . I admire and honour him more than any man I ever saw . "
14696	14801	14681	14682	Mr. Brooke	175	" Ah ? … Well ! He is a good match in some respects . But now , Chettam is a good match . And our land lies together . I shall never interfere against your wishes , my dear . People should have their own way in marriage , and that sort of thing — up to a certain point , you know . I have always said that , up to a certain point . I wish you to marry well ; and I have good reason to believe that Chettam wishes to marry you . I mention it , you know . "
14802	14815	14817	14817	Dorothea	189	" It is impossible that I should ever marry Sir James Chettam , "
14819	14834	14817	14817	Dorothea	189	" If he thinks of marrying me , he has made a great mistake . "
14835	14865	14681	14682	Mr. Brooke	175	" That is it , you see . One never knows . I should have thought Chettam was just the sort of man a woman would like , now . "
14866	14879	14881	14881	Dorothea	189	" Pray do not mention him in that light again , uncle , "
14936	15069	14929	14929	Chettam	177	" Well , but Casaubon , now . There is no hurry — I mean for you . It 's true , every year will tell upon him . He is over five - and - forty , you know . I should say a good seven - and - twenty years older than you . To be sure,—if you like learning and standing , and that sort of thing , we ca n't have everything . And his income is good — he has a handsome property independent of the Church — his income is good . Still he is not young , and I must not conceal from you , my dear , that I think his health is not over - strong . I know nothing else against him . "
15070	15085	15087	15087	Dorothea	189	" I should not wish to have a husband very near my own age , "
15093	15112	15087	15087	Dorothea	189	" I should wish to have a husband who was above me in judgment and in all knowledge . "
15119	15147	15113	15114	Mr. Brooke	175	" Ah?—I thought you had more of your own opinion than most girls . I thought you liked your own opinion — liked it , you know . "
15148	15196	15087	15087	Dorothea	189	" I can not imagine myself living without some opinions , but I should wish to have good reasons for them , and a wise man could help me to see which opinions had the best foundation , and would help me to live according to them . "
15197	15226	15228	15229	Mr. Brooke	175	" Very true . You could n't put the thing better — couldn't put it better , beforehand , you know . But there are oddities in things , "
15249	15332	15240	15240	he	175	" Life is n't cast in a mould — not cut out by rule and line , and that sort of thing . I never married myself , and it will be the better for you and yours . The fact is , I never loved any one well enough to put myself into a noose for them . It is a noose , you know . Temper , now . There is temper . And a husband likes to be master . "
15333	15362	15365	15365	Dorothea	189	" I know that I must expect trials , uncle . Marriage is a state of higher duties . I never thought of it as mere personal ease , "
15367	15528	15365	15365	Dorothea	189	" Well , you are not fond of show , a great establishment , balls , dinners , that kind of thing . I can see that Casaubon 's ways might suit you better than Chettam 's . And you shall do as you like , my dear . I would not hinder Casaubon ; I said so at once ; for there is no knowing how anything may turn out . You have not the same tastes as every young lady ; and a clergyman and scholar — who may be a bishop — that kind of thing — may suit you better than Chettam . Chettam is a good fellow , a good sound - hearted fellow , you know ; but he does n't go much into ideas . I did , when I was his age . But Casaubon 's eyes , now . I think he has hurt them a little with too much reading . "
15529	15550	15552	15552	Dorothea	189	" I should be all the happier , uncle , the more room there was for me to help him , "
15556	15587	15552	15552	Dorothea	189	" You have quite made up your mind , I see . Well , my dear , the fact is , I have a letter for you in my pocket . "
15607	15625	15604	15604	he	175	" There is not too much hurry , my dear . Think about it , you know . "
16636	16642	16668	16669	Mr. Casaubon	189	" air , with variations , "
16924	16935	16936	16936	he	848	" Have you thought enough about this , my dear ? "
16941	16980	16936	16936	he	848	" There was no need to think long , uncle . I know of nothing to make me vacillate . If I changed my mind , it must be because of something important and entirely new to me . "
16981	17015	16936	16936	he	848	" Ah!—then you have accepted him ? Then Chettam has no chance ? Has Chettam offended you — offended you , you know ? What is it you do n't like in Chettam ? "
17016	17026	17028	17028	Dorothea	224	" There is nothing that I like in him , "
17064	17095	17053	17053	Dorothea	224	" I mean in the light of a husband . He is very kind , I think — really very good about the cottages . A well - meaning man . "
17096	17267	17053	17053	Dorothea	224	" But you must have a scholar , and that sort of thing ? Well , it lies a little in our family . I had it myself — that love of knowledge , and going into everything — a little too much — it took me too far ; though that sort of thing does n't often run in the female - line ; or it runs underground like the rivers in Greece , you know — it comes out in the sons . Clever sons , clever mothers . I went a good deal into that , at one time . However , my dear , I have always said that people should do as they like in these things , up to a certain point . I could n't , as your guardian , have consented to a bad match . But Casaubon stands well : his position is good . I am afraid Chettam will be hurt , though , and Mrs. Cadwallader will blame me . "
17545	17555	17536	17536	her	169	" Celia , dear , come and kiss me , "
17597	17618	17620	17620	Celia	169	" Do n't sit up , Dodo , you are so pale to - night : go to bed soon , "
17633	17645	17647	17647	Dorothea	189	" No , dear , I am very , very happy , "
17651	17657	17659	17659	Celia	169	" So much the better , "
17661	17674	17647	17647	Dorothea	189	" But how strangely Dodo goes from one extreme to the other . "
17693	17707	17682	17683	the butler	1174	" Jonas is come back , sir , and has brought this letter . "
17723	17750	17719	17719	Dorothea	189	" Casaubon , my dear : he will be here to dinner ; he did n't wait to write more — didn't wait , you know . "
17865	17867	17858	17858	she	169	" ugly "
18371	18376	18352	18352	Celia	169	" by the bye . "
18377	18389	18352	18352	Celia	169	" Is any one else coming to dine besides Mr. Casaubon ? "
18390	18397	18352	18352	Celia	169	" Not that I know of . "
18398	18418	18352	18352	Celia	169	" I hope there is some one else . Then I shall not hear him eat his soup so . "
18419	18430	18352	18352	Celia	169	" What is there remarkable about his soup - eating ? "
18431	18480	18352	18352	Celia	169	" Really , Dodo , ca n't you hear how he scrapes his spoon ? And he always blinks before he speaks . I do n't know whether Locke blinked , but I 'm sure I am sorry for those who sat opposite to him if he did . "
18481	18484	18486	18486	Dorothea	189	" Celia , "
18492	18504	18486	18486	Dorothea	189	" pray do n't make any more observations of that kind . "
18505	18514	18516	18516	Celia	169	" Why not ? They are quite true , "
18535	18547	18526	18526	she	169	" Many things are true which only the commonest minds observe . "
18548	18583	18584	18584	Celia	169	" Then I think the commonest minds must be rather useful . I think it is a pity Mr. Casaubon 's mother had not a commoner mind : she might have taught him better . "
18620	18639	18641	18641	Celia	169	" It is right to tell you , Celia , that I am engaged to marry Mr. Casaubon . "
18702	18714	18694	18694	she	169	" Oh , Dodo , I hope you will be happy . "
18744	18752	18754	18754	Celia	169	" It is quite decided , then ? "
18762	18767	18754	18754	Celia	169	" And uncle knows ? "
18768	18793	18843	18844	Mr. Casaubon	189	" I have accepted Mr. Casaubon 's offer . My uncle brought me the letter that contained it ; he knew about it beforehand . "
18794	18811	18813	18813	Celia	169	" I beg your pardon , if I have said anything to hurt you , Dodo , "
18862	18905	18843	18844	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Never mind , Kitty , do not grieve . We should never admire the same people . I often offend in something of the same way ; I am apt to speak too strongly of those who do n't please me . "
19075	19086	19087	19087	he	189	" My dear young lady — Miss Brooke — Dorothea ! "
19097	19254	19087	19087	he	189	" this is a happiness greater than I had ever imagined to be in reserve for me . That I should ever meet with a mind and person so rich in the mingled graces which could render marriage desirable , was far indeed from my conception . You have all — nay , more than all — those qualities which I have ever regarded as the characteristic excellences of womanhood . The great charm of your sex is its capability of an ardent self - sacrificing affection , and herein we see its fitness to round and complete the existence of our own . Hitherto I have known few pleasures save of the severer kind : my satisfactions have been those of the solitary student . I have been little disposed to gather flowers that would wither in my hand , but now I shall pluck them with eagerness , to place them in your bosom . "
19370	19384	19386	19386	Dorothea	189	" I am very ignorant — you will quite wonder at my ignorance , "
19388	19421	19422	19422	she	1200	" I have so many thoughts that may be quite mistaken ; and now I shall be able to tell them all to you , and ask you about them . But , "
19435	19482	19422	19422	she	1200	" I will not trouble you too much ; only when you are inclined to listen to me . You must often be weary with the pursuit of subjects in your own track . I shall gain enough if you will take me with you there . "
19483	19499	19501	19502	Mr. Casaubon	189	" How should I be able now to persevere in any path without your companionship ? "
19780	19786	19767	19768	the lady	1212	" How do you do ? "
19835	19848	19850	19858	the high - coloured , dark - eyed lady	1216	" Well , Mrs. Fitchett , how are your fowls laying now ? "
19866	19895	19850	19858	the high - coloured , dark - eyed lady	1216	" Pretty well for laying , madam , but they 've ta'en to eating their eggs : I 've no peace o ' mind with 'em at all . "
19896	19931	19850	19858	the high - coloured , dark - eyed lady	1216	" Oh , the cannibals ! Better sell them cheap at once . What will you sell them a couple ? One ca n't eat fowls of a bad character at a high price . "
19932	19953	19850	19858	the high - coloured , dark - eyed lady	1216	" Well , madam , half - a - crown : I could n't let 'em go , not under . "
19954	20030	19850	19858	the high - coloured , dark - eyed lady	1216	" Half - a - crown , these times ! Come now — for the Rector 's chicken - broth on a Sunday . He has consumed all ours that I can spare . You are half paid with the sermon , Mrs. Fitchett , remember that . Take a pair of tumbler - pigeons for them — little beauties . You must come and see them . You have no tumblers among your pigeons . "
20031	20058	19850	19858	the high - coloured , dark - eyed lady	1216	" Well , madam , Master Fitchett shall go and see 'em after work . He 's very hot on new sorts ; to oblige you . "
20059	20104	19850	19858	the high - coloured , dark - eyed lady	1216	" Oblige me ! It will be the best bargain he ever made . A pair of church pigeons for a couple of wicked Spanish fowls that eat their own eggs ! Do n't you and Fitchett boast too much , that is all ! "
20128	20131	20121	20121	her	227	" Surely , surely!"—from
20340	20351	20352	20352	she	180	" I see you have had our Lowick Cicero here , "
20374	20480	20352	20352	she	180	" I suspect you and he are brewing some bad polities , else you would not be seeing so much of the lively man . I shall inform against you : remember you are both suspicious characters since you took Peel 's side about the Catholic Bill . I shall tell everybody that you are going to put up for Middlemarch on the Whig side when old Pinkerton resigns , and that Casaubon is going to help you in an underhand manner : going to bribe the voters with pamphlets , and throw open the public - houses to distribute them . Come , confess ! "
20481	20487	20489	20490	Mr. Brooke	175	" Nothing of the sort , "
20509	20557	20352	20352	she	180	" Casaubon and I do n't talk politics much . He does n't care much about the philanthropic side of things ; punishments , and that kind of thing . He only cares about Church questions . That is not my line of action , you know . "
20558	20637	20352	20352	she	180	" Ra - a - ther too much , my friend . I have heard of your doings . Who was it that sold his bit of land to the Papists at Middlemarch ? I believe you bought it on purpose . You are a perfect Guy Faux . See if you are not burnt in effigy this 5th of November coming . Humphrey would not come to quarrel with you about it , so I am come . "
20638	20658	20352	20352	she	180	" Very good . I was prepared to be persecuted for not persecuting — not persecuting , you know . "
20659	20759	20352	20352	she	180	" There you go ! That is a piece of clap - trap you have got ready for the hustings . Now , do not let them lure you to the hustings , my dear Mr. Brooke . A man always makes a fool of himself , speechifying : there 's no excuse but being on the right side , so that you can ask a blessing on your humming and hawing . You will lose yourself , I forewarn you . You will make a Saturday pie of all parties ' opinions , and be pelted by everybody . "
20760	20770	20772	20773	Mr. Brooke	175	" That is what I expect , you know , "
20785	20845	20352	20352	she	180	sketch—"what I expect as an independent man . As to the Whigs , a man who goes with the thinkers is not likely to be hooked on by any party . He may go with them up to a certain point — up to a certain point , you know . But that is what you ladies never understand . "
20846	20947	20352	20352	she	180	" Where your certain point is ? No . I should like to be told how a man can have any certain point when he belongs to no party — leading a roving life , and never letting his friends know his address . ' Nobody knows where Brooke will be — there 's no counting on Brooke'—that is what people say of you , to be quite frank . Now , do turn respectable . How will you like going to Sessions with everybody looking shy on you , and you with a bad conscience and an empty pocket ? "
20948	20961	20963	20964	Mr. Brooke	175	" I do n't pretend to argue with a lady on politics , "
20999	21026	20352	20352	she	180	" Your sex are not thinkers , you know — varium et mutabile semper — that kind of thing . You do n't know Virgil . I knew"—Mr
21043	21134	20352	20352	she	180	poet—"I was going to say , poor Stoddart , you know . That was what he said . You ladies are always against an independent attitude — a man 's caring for nothing but truth , and that sort of thing . And there is no part of the county where opinion is narrower than it is here — I do n't mean to throw stones , you know , but somebody is wanted to take the independent line ; and if I do n't take it , who will ? "
21135	21218	21219	21220	Mr. Brooke	175	" Who ? Why , any upstart who has got neither blood nor position . People of standing should consume their independent nonsense at home , not hawk it about . And you ! who are going to marry your niece , as good as your daughter , to one of our best men . Sir James would be cruelly annoyed : it will be too hard on him if you turn round now and make yourself a Whig sign - board . "
21257	21263	21252	21253	ignorant observers	1231	" Quarrel with Mrs. Cadwallader ; "
21315	21343	21345	21346	Mr. Brooke	175	" I hope Chettam and I shall always be good friends ; but I am sorry to say there is no prospect of his marrying my niece , "
21361	21365	21367	21368	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Why not ? "
21377	21392	21367	21368	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" It is hardly a fortnight since you and I were talking about it . "
21393	21455	21367	21368	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" My niece has chosen another suitor — has chosen him , you know . I have had nothing to do with it . I should have preferred Chettam ; and I should have said Chettam was the man any girl would have chosen . But there is no accounting for these things . Your sex is capricious , you know . "
21456	21474	21475	21476	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Why , whom do you mean to say that you are going to let her marry ? "
21525	21539	21517	21517	He	175	" By the way , I must speak to Wright about the horses , "
21547	21561	21563	21564	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" My dear child , what is this?—this about your sister 's engagement ? "
21566	21575	21577	21577	Celia	169	" She is engaged to marry Mr. Casaubon , "
21604	21617	21577	21577	Celia	169	" This is frightful . How long has it been going on ? "
21618	21635	21563	21564	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" I only knew of it yesterday . They are to be married in six weeks . "
21636	21654	21563	21564	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Well , my dear , I wish you joy of your brother - in - law . "
21655	21663	21577	21577	Celia	169	" I am so sorry for Dorothea . "
21664	21675	21563	21564	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Sorry ! It is her doing , I suppose . "
21676	21688	21563	21564	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Yes ; she says Mr. Casaubon has a great soul . "
21689	21695	21577	21577	Celia	169	" With all my heart . "
21696	21719	21563	21564	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Oh , Mrs. Cadwallader , I do n't think it can be nice to marry a man with a great soul . "
21720	21753	21563	21564	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Well , my dear , take warning . You know the look of one now ; when the next comes and wants to marry you , do n't you accept him . "
21754	21762	21577	21577	Celia	169	" I 'm sure I never should . "
21763	21799	21563	21564	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" No ; one such in a family is enough . So your sister never cared about Sir James Chettam ? What would you have said to him for a brother - in - law ? "
21800	21822	21823	21823	Celia	169	" I should have liked that very much . I am sure he would have been a good husband . Only , "
21841	21852	21823	21823	Celia	169	" I do n't think he would have suited Dorothea . "
21853	21860	21563	21564	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Not high - flown enough ? "
21861	21891	21823	21823	Celia	169	" Dodo is very strict . She thinks so much about everything , and is so particular about what one says . Sir James never seemed to please her . "
21892	21909	21563	21564	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" She must have encouraged him , I am sure . That is not very creditable . "
21910	21953	21823	21823	Celia	169	" Please do n't be angry with Dodo ; she does not see things . She thought so much about the cottages , and she was rude to Sir James sometimes ; but he is so kind , he never noticed it . "
21954	21957	21959	21960	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Well , "
21975	22178	21964	21964	her	180	" I must go straight to Sir James and break this to him . He will have brought his mother back by this time , and I must call . Your uncle will never tell him . We are all disappointed , my dear . Young people should think of their families in marrying . I set a bad example — married a poor clergyman , and made myself a pitiable object among the De Bracys — obliged to get my coals by stratagem , and pray to heaven for my salad oil . However , Casaubon has money enough ; I must do him that justice . As to his blood , I suppose the family quarterings are three cuttle - fish sable , and a commentator rampant . By the bye , before I go , my dear , I must speak to your Mrs. Carter about pastry . I want to send my young cook to learn of her . Poor people with four children , like us , you know , ca n't afford to keep a good cook . I have no doubt Mrs. Carter will oblige me . Sir James 's cook is a perfect dragon . "
22329	22354	22326	22326	she	180	" I have a great shock for you ; I hope you are not so far gone in love as you pretended to be . "
22385	22432	22379	22379	He	177	" I do believe Brooke is going to expose himself after all . I accused him of meaning to stand for Middlemarch on the Liberal side , and he looked silly and never denied it — talked about the independent line , and the usual nonsense . "
22433	22438	22440	22441	Sir James	177	" Is that all ? "
22446	22449	22451	22452	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Why , "
22459	22489	22451	22452	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" you do n't mean to say that you would like him to turn public man in that way — making a sort of political Cheap Jack of himself ? "
22490	22507	22379	22379	He	177	" He might be dissuaded , I should think . He would not like the expense . "
22508	22581	22451	22452	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" That is what I told him . He is vulnerable to reason there — always a few grains of common - sense in an ounce of miserliness . Miserliness is a capital quality to run in families ; it 's the safe side for madness to dip on . And there must be a little crack in the Brooke family , else we should not see what we are to see . "
22582	22590	22451	22452	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" What ? Brooke standing for Middlemarch ? "
22591	22653	22379	22379	He	177	" Worse than that . I really feel a little responsible . I always told you Miss Brooke would be such a fine match . I knew there was a great deal of nonsense in her — a flighty sort of Methodistical stuff . But these things wear out of girls . However , I am taken by surprise for once . "
22654	22663	22665	22666	Sir James	177	" What do you mean , Mrs. Cadwallader ? "
22709	22721	22700	22701	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" What has happened to Miss Brooke ? Pray speak out . "
22722	22733	22734	22735	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Very well . She is engaged to be married . "
22774	22779	22770	22770	she	180	" Engaged to Casaubon . "
22814	22817	22806	22806	he	177	" Casaubon ? "
22818	22828	22806	22806	he	177	" Even so . You know my errand now . "
22829	22845	22806	22806	he	177	" Good God ! It is horrible ! He is no better than a mummy ! "
22867	22885	22887	22888	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" She says , he is a great soul.—A great bladder for dried peas to rattle in ! "
22890	22902	22904	22905	Sir James	177	" What business has an old bachelor like that to marry ? "
22907	22916	22904	22905	Sir James	177	" He has one foot in the grave . "
22917	22929	22806	22806	he	177	" He means to draw it out again , I suppose . "
22930	22966	22904	22905	Sir James	177	" Brooke ought not to allow it : he should insist on its being put off till she is of age . She would think better of it then . What is a guardian for ? "
22967	22980	22904	22905	Sir James	177	" As if you could ever squeeze a resolution out of Brooke ! "
22981	22988	22806	22806	he	177	" Cadwallader might talk to him . "
22989	23121	22904	22905	Sir James	177	" Not he ! Humphrey finds everybody charming . I never can get him to abuse Casaubon . He will even speak well of the bishop , though I tell him it is unnatural in a beneficed clergyman ; what can one do with a husband who attends so little to the decencies ? I hide it as well as I can by abusing everybody myself . Come , come , cheer up ! you are well rid of Miss Brooke , a girl who would have been requiring you to see the stars by daylight . Between ourselves , little Celia is worth two of her , and likely after all to be the better match . For this marriage to Casaubon is as good as going to a nunnery . "
23122	23148	22904	22905	Sir James	177	" Oh , on my own account — it is for Miss Brooke 's sake I think her friends should try to use their influence . "
23149	23280	22904	22905	Sir James	177	" Well , Humphrey does n't know yet . But when I tell him , you may depend on it he will say , ' Why not ? Casaubon is a good fellow — and young — young enough . ' These charitable people never know vinegar from wine till they have swallowed it and got the colic . However , if I were a man I should prefer Celia , especially when Dorothea was gone . The truth is , you have been courting one and have won the other . I can see that she admires you almost as much as a man expects to be admired . If it were any one but me who said so , you might think it exaggeration . Good - by ! "
24212	24215	24217	24218	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" However , "
24229	24292	24217	24218	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" I throw her over : there was a chance , if she had married Sir James , of her becoming a sane , sensible woman . He would never have contradicted her , and when a woman is not contradicted , she has no motive for obstinacy in her absurdities . But now I wish her joy of her hair shirt . "
24381	24402	24403	24403	He	177	" Smile like the knot of cowslips on the cliff , Not to be come at by the willing hand . "
24838	24843	24805	24805	women	866	" Oh , nothing ! "
25166	25179	25181	25181	Dorothea	189	" Could I not be preparing myself now to be more useful ? "
25195	25224	25181	25181	Dorothea	189	" could I not learn to read Latin and Greek aloud to you , as Milton 's daughters did to their father , without understanding what they read ? "
25225	25235	25237	25238	Mr. Casaubon	189	" I fear that would be wearisome to you , "
25242	25273	25237	25238	Mr. Casaubon	189	" and , indeed , if I remember rightly , the young women you have mentioned regarded that exercise in unknown tongues as a ground for rebellion against the poet . "
25274	25341	25181	25181	Dorothea	189	" Yes ; but in the first place they were very naughty girls , else they would have been proud to minister to such a father ; and in the second place they might have studied privately and taught themselves to understand what they read , and then it would have been interesting . I hope you do n't expect me to be naughty and stupid ? "
25342	25394	25237	25238	Mr. Casaubon	189	" I expect you to be all that an exquisite young lady can be in every possible relation of life . Certainly it might be a great advantage if you were able to copy the Greek character , and to that end it were well to begin with a little reading . "
25793	25827	25781	25781	he	175	" Well , but now , Casaubon , such deep studies , classics , mathematics , that kind of thing , are too taxing for a woman — too taxing , you know . "
25828	25838	25840	25841	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Dorothea is learning to read the characters simply , "
25847	25859	25840	25841	Mr. Casaubon	189	" She had the very considerate thought of saving my eyes . "
25860	26000	25781	25781	he	175	" Ah , well , without understanding , you know — that may not be so bad . But there is a lightness about the feminine mind — a touch and go — music , the fine arts , that kind of thing — they should study those up to a certain point , women should ; but in a light way , you know . A woman should be able to sit down and play you or sing you a good old English tune . That is what I like ; though I have heard most things — been at the opera in Vienna : Gluck , Mozart , everything of that sort . But I 'm a conservative in music — it 's not like ideas , you know . I stick to the good old tunes . "
26001	26020	26022	26022	Dorothea	189	" Mr. Casaubon is not fond of the piano , and I am very glad he is not , "
26077	26083	26211	26212	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Last Rose of Summer , "
26091	26110	26068	26068	he	1325	" He says there is only an old harpsichord at Lowick , and it is covered with books . "
26111	26186	26211	26212	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Ah , there you are behind Celia , my dear . Celia , now , plays very prettily , and is always ready to play . However , since Casaubon does not like it , you are all right . But it 's a pity you should not have little recreations of that sort , Casaubon : the bow always strung — that kind of thing , you know — will not do . "
26187	26209	26211	26212	Mr. Casaubon	189	" I never could look on it in the light of a recreation to have my ears teased with measured noises , "
26214	26291	26211	26212	Mr. Casaubon	189	" A tune much iterated has the ridiculous effect of making the words in my mind perform a sort of minuet to keep time — an effect hardly tolerable , I imagine , after boyhood . As to the grander forms of music , worthy to accompany solemn celebrations , and even to serve as an educating influence according to the ancient conception , I say nothing , for with these we are not immediately concerned . "
26292	26304	26306	26306	Dorothea	189	" No ; but music of that sort I should enjoy , "
26308	26334	26306	26306	Dorothea	189	" When we were coming home from Lausanne my uncle took us to hear the great organ at Freiberg , and it made me sob . "
26335	26347	26349	26350	Mr. Brooke	175	" That kind of thing is not healthy , my dear , "
26352	26378	26349	26350	Mr. Brooke	175	" Casaubon , she will be in your hands now : you must teach my niece to take things more quietly , eh , Dorothea ? "
26422	26429	26430	26430	he	175	" It is wonderful , though , "
26440	26513	26430	26430	he	175	room—"it is wonderful that she should have liked him . However , the match is good . I should have been travelling out of my brief to have hindered it , let Mrs. Cadwallader say what she will . He is pretty certain to be a bishop , is Casaubon . That was a very seasonable pamphlet of his on the Catholic Question:—a deanery at least . They owe him a deanery . "
27155	27162	27163	27163	he	251	" Well , how are you ? "
27176	27192	27163	27163	he	251	" Sorry I missed you before . Is there anything particular ? You look vexed . "
27221	27240	27212	27212	he	251	" It is only this conduct of Brooke 's . I really think somebody should speak to him . "
27241	27248	27250	27251	Mr. Cadwallader	251	" What ? meaning to stand ? "
27268	27324	27212	27212	he	251	" I hardly think he means it . But where 's the harm , if he likes it ? Any one who objects to Whiggery should be glad when the Whigs do n't put up the strongest fellow . They wo n't overturn the Constitution with our friend Brooke 's head for a battering ram . "
27325	27334	27336	27337	Sir James	177	" Oh , I do n't mean that , "
27370	27387	27212	27212	he	251	" I mean this marriage . I mean his letting that blooming young girl marry Casaubon . "
27388	27409	27212	27212	he	251	" What is the matter with Casaubon ? I see no harm in him — if the girl likes him . "
27410	27478	27212	27212	he	251	" She is too young to know what she likes . Her guardian ought to interfere . He ought not to allow the thing to be done in this headlong manner . I wonder a man like you , Cadwallader — a man with daughters , can look at the affair with indifference : and with such a heart as yours ! Do think seriously about it . "
27479	27492	27494	27495	the Rector	6953	" I am not joking ; I am as serious as possible , "
27504	27546	27494	27495	the Rector	6953	" You are as bad as Elinor . She has been wanting me to go and lecture Brooke ; and I have reminded her that her friends had a very poor opinion of the match she made when she married me . "
27547	27553	27555	27556	Sir James	177	" But look at Casaubon , "
27560	27590	27555	27556	Sir James	177	" He must be fifty , and I do n't believe he could ever have been much more than the shadow of a man . Look at his legs ! "
27591	27658	27494	27495	the Rector	6953	" Confound you handsome young fellows ! you think of having it all your own way in the world . You do n't understand women . They do n't admire you half so much as you admire yourselves . Elinor used to tell her sisters that she married me for my ugliness — it was so various and amusing that it had quite conquered her prudence . "
27659	27687	27698	27698	he	177	" You ! it was easy enough for a woman to love you . But this is no question of beauty . I do n't like Casaubon . "
27707	27717	27719	27720	the Rector	6953	" Why ? what do you know against him ? "
27783	27794	27780	27780	he	177	" Now , Cadwallader , has he got any heart ? "
27795	27950	27780	27780	he	177	" Well , yes . I do n't mean of the melting sort , but a sound kernel , that you may be sure of . He is very good to his poor relations : pensions several of the women , and is educating a young fellow at a good deal of expense . Casaubon acts up to his sense of justice . His mother 's sister made a bad match — a Pole , I think — lost herself — at any rate was disowned by her family . If it had not been for that , Casaubon would not have had so much money by half . I believe he went himself to find out his cousins , and see what he could do for them . Every man would not ring so well as that , if you tried his metal . You would , Chettam ; but not every man . "
27951	27957	27959	27960	Sir James	177	" I do n't know , "
27964	27973	27974	27974	He	177	" I am not so sure of myself . "
27983	28093	27974	27974	He	177	" That was a right thing for Casaubon to do . But a man may wish to do what is right , and yet be a sort of parchment code . A woman may not be happy with him . And I think when a girl is so young as Miss Brooke is , her friends ought to interfere a little to hinder her from doing anything foolish . You laugh , because you fancy I have some feeling on my own account . But upon my honour , it is not that . I should feel just the same if I were Miss Brooke 's brother or uncle . "
28094	28103	28177	28177	She	180	" Well , but what should you do ? "
28104	28156	27974	27974	He	177	" I should say that the marriage must not be decided on until she was of age . And depend upon it , in that case , it would never come off . I wish you saw it as I do — I wish you would talk to Brooke about it . "
28205	28214	28216	28217	the wife	1365	" I hear what you are talking about , "
28219	28275	28216	28217	the wife	1365	" But you will make no impression on Humphrey . As long as the fish rise to his bait , everybody is what he ought to be . Bless you , Casaubon has got a trout - stream , and does not care about fishing in it himself : could there be a better fellow ? "
28276	28285	28287	28288	the Rector	6953	" Well , there is something in that , "
28297	28314	28287	28288	the Rector	6953	" It is a very good quality in a man to have a trout - stream . "
28315	28319	28321	28322	Sir James	177	" But seriously , "
28332	28346	28321	28322	Sir James	177	" do n't you think the Rector might do some good by speaking ? "
28347	28359	28366	28366	her	180	" Oh , I told you beforehand what he would say , "
28369	28385	28366	28366	her	180	" I have done what I could : I wash my hands of the marriage . "
28386	28392	28394	28395	the Rector	6953	" In the first place , "
28401	28444	28394	28395	the Rector	6953	" it would be nonsensical to expect that I could convince Brooke , and make him act accordingly . Brooke is a very good fellow , but pulpy ; he will run into any mould , but he wo n't keep shape . "
28445	28457	28459	28460	Sir James	177	" He might keep shape long enough to defer the marriage , "
28462	28594	28459	28460	Sir James	177	" But , my dear Chettam , why should I use my influence to Casaubon 's disadvantage , unless I were much surer than I am that I should be acting for the advantage of Miss Brooke ? I know no harm of Casaubon . I do n't care about his Xisuthrus and Fee - fo - fum and the rest ; but then he does n't care about my fishing - tackle . As to the line he took on the Catholic Question , that was unexpected ; but he has always been civil to me , and I do n't see why I should spoil his sport . For anything I can tell , Miss Brooke may be happier with him than she would be with any other man . "
28595	28628	28394	28395	the Rector	6953	" Humphrey ! I have no patience with you . You know you would rather dine under the hedge than with Casaubon alone . You have nothing to say to each other . "
28629	28651	28459	28460	Sir James	177	" What has that to do with Miss Brooke 's marrying him ? She does not do it for my amusement . "
28652	28664	28666	28667	Sir James	177	" He has got no good red blood in his body , "
28669	28689	28691	28692	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" No . Somebody put a drop under a magnifying - glass and it was all semicolons and parentheses , "
28694	28708	28710	28711	Sir James	177	" Why does he not bring out his book , instead of marrying , "
28729	28796	28725	28727	an English layman	1368	" Oh , he dreams footnotes , and they run away with all his brains . They say , when he was a little boy , he made an abstract of ' Hop o ' my Thumb , ' and he has been making abstracts ever since . Ugh ! And that is the man Humphrey goes on saying that a woman may be happy with . "
28797	28807	28809	28810	the Rector	6953	" Well , he is what Miss Brooke likes , "
28812	28825	28809	28810	the Rector	6953	" I do n't profess to understand every young lady 's taste . "
28826	28835	28837	28838	Sir James	177	" But if she were your own daughter ? "
28840	28938	28837	28838	Sir James	177	" That would be a different affair . She is not my daughter , and I do n't feel called upon to interfere . Casaubon is as good as most of us . He is a scholarly clergyman , and creditable to the cloth . Some Radical fellow speechifying at Middlemarch said Casaubon was the learned straw - chopping incumbent , and Freke was the brick - and - mortar incumbent , and I was the angling incumbent . And upon my word , I do n't see that one is worse or better than the other . "
29693	29697	29698	29698	Celia	169	" Oh dear ! "
29703	29716	29698	29698	Celia	169	" I am sure Freshitt Hall would have been pleasanter than this . "
30146	30173	30175	30176	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Now , my dear Dorothea , I wish you to favour me by pointing out which room you would like to have as your boudoir , "
30194	30206	30208	30208	Dorothea	189	" It is very kind of you to think of that , "
30210	30267	30208	30208	Dorothea	189	" but I assure you I would rather have all those matters decided for me . I shall be much happier to take everything as it is — just as you have been used to have it , or as you will yourself choose it to be . I have no motive for wishing anything else . "
30268	30273	30275	30275	Celia	169	" Oh , Dodo , "
30277	30291	30275	30275	Celia	169	" will you not have the bow - windowed room up - stairs ? "
30408	30411	30413	30414	Mr. Brooke	175	" Yes , "
30416	30441	30413	30414	Mr. Brooke	175	" this would be a pretty room with some new hangings , sofas , and that sort of thing . A little bare now . "
30442	30447	30449	30449	Dorothea	189	" No , uncle , "
30453	30497	30498	30498	she	1436	" Pray do not speak of altering anything . There are so many other things in the world that want altering — I like to take these things as they are . And you like them as they are , do n't you ? "
30506	30519	30498	30498	she	1436	" Perhaps this was your mother 's room when she was young . "
30520	30524	30525	30525	he	189	" It was , "
30536	30542	30544	30544	Dorothea	189	" This is your mother , "
30556	30586	30544	30544	Dorothea	189	" It is like the tiny one you brought me ; only , I should think , a better portrait . And this one opposite , who is this ? "
30587	30617	30630	30630	she	169	" Her elder sister . They were , like you and your sister , the only two children of their parents , who hang above them , you see . "
30618	30624	30626	30626	Celia	169	" The sister is pretty , "
30670	30677	30679	30679	Dorothea	189	" It is a peculiar face , "
30684	30737	30679	30679	Dorothea	189	" Those deep gray eyes rather near together — and the delicate irregular nose with a sort of ripple in it — and all the powdered curls hanging backward . Altogether it seems to me peculiar rather than pretty . There is not even a family likeness between her and your mother . "
30738	30750	30798	30799	Mr. Casaubon	189	" No . And they were not alike in their lot . "
30751	30760	30762	30762	Dorothea	189	" You did not mention her to me , "
30764	30777	30762	30762	Dorothea	189	" My aunt made an unfortunate marriage . I never saw her . "
30831	30841	30843	30843	Dorothea	189	" Shall we not walk in the garden now ? "
30845	30858	30860	30861	Mr. Brooke	175	" And you would like to see the church , you know , "
30863	30919	30860	30861	Mr. Brooke	175	" It is a droll little church . And the village . It all lies in a nut - shell . By the way , it will suit you , Dorothea ; for the cottages are like a row of alms - houses — little gardens , gilly - flowers , that sort of thing . "
30920	30925	30927	30927	Dorothea	189	" Yes , please , "
30934	30943	30927	30927	Dorothea	189	" I should like to see all that . "
30960	30964	30944	30944	She	1441	" not bad . "
31067	31087	31039	31039	she	169	" Do you know , Dorothea , I saw some one quite young coming up one of the walks . "
31088	31095	31039	31039	she	169	" Is that astonishing , Celia ? "
31096	31110	31112	31113	Mr. Brooke	175	" There may be a young gardener , you know — why not ? "
31115	31125	31112	31113	Mr. Brooke	175	" I told Casaubon he should change his gardener . "
31126	31133	31135	31135	Celia	169	" No , not a gardener , "
31137	31165	31135	31135	Celia	169	" a gentleman with a sketch - book . He had light - brown curls . I only saw his back . But he was quite young . "
31166	31174	31176	31177	Mr. Brooke	175	" The curate 's son , perhaps , "
31179	31206	31176	31177	Mr. Brooke	175	" Ah , there is Casaubon again , and Tucker with him . He is going to introduce Tucker . You do n't know Tucker yet . "
31219	31223	31176	31177	Mr. Brooke	175	" inferior clergy , "
31514	31568	31510	31511	Mr. Brooke	175	" Your farmers leave some barley for the women to glean , I see . The poor folks here might have a fowl in their pot , as the good French king used to wish for all his people . The French eat a good many fowls — skinny fowls , you know . "
31569	31581	31583	31583	Dorothea	189	" I think it was a very cheap wish of his , "
31587	31604	31583	31583	Dorothea	189	" Are kings such monsters that a wish like that must be reckoned a royal virtue ? "
31605	31615	31617	31617	Celia	169	" And if he wished them a skinny fowl , "
31619	31636	31617	31617	Celia	169	" that would not be nice . But perhaps he wished them to have fat fowls . "
31637	31669	31677	31677	his	189	" Yes , but the word has dropped out of the text , or perhaps was subauditum ; that is , present in the king 's mind , but not uttered , "
31875	31895	31871	31872	Mr. Casaubon	189	" You seem a little sad , Dorothea . I trust you are pleased with what you have seen . "
31896	31908	31910	31910	Dorothea	189	" I am feeling something which is perhaps foolish and wrong , "
31915	31963	31913	31913	her	1467	openness—"almost wishing that the people wanted more to be done for them here . I have known so few ways of making my life good for anything . Of course , my notions of usefulness must be narrow . I must learn new ways of helping people . "
31964	31967	31969	31970	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Doubtless , "
31972	31998	31969	31970	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Each position has its corresponding duties . Yours , I trust , as the mistress of Lowick , will not leave any yearning unfulfilled . "
31999	32006	32008	32008	Dorothea	189	" Indeed , I believe that , "
32012	32021	32008	32008	Dorothea	189	" Do not suppose that I am sad . "
32022	32050	32051	32051	Dorothea	189	" That is well . But , if you are not tired , we will take another way to the house than that by which we came . "
32130	32138	32124	32124	his	175	" Who is that youngster , Casaubon ? "
32149	32168	32169	32169	he	189	" That is a young relative of mine , a second cousin : the grandson , in fact , "
32176	32191	32169	32169	he	189	" of the lady whose portrait you have been noticing , my aunt Julia . "
32227	32248	32249	32250	The cousin	1480	" Dorothea , let me introduce to you my cousin , Mr. Ladislaw . Will , this is Miss Brooke . "
32353	32362	32364	32365	Mr. Brooke	175	" You are an artist , I see , "
32382	32400	32402	32403	young Ladislaw	262	" No , I only sketch a little . There is nothing fit to be seen there , "
32414	32465	32466	32467	Mr. Brooke	175	" Oh , come , this is a nice bit , now . I did a little in this way myself at one time , you know . Look here , now ; this is what I call a nice thing , done with what we used to call brio . "
32488	32497	32499	32499	Dorothea	189	" I am no judge of these things , "
32515	32580	32581	32581	Dorothea	189	" You know , uncle , I never see the beauty of those pictures which you say are so much praised . They are a language I do not understand . I suppose there is some relation between pictures and nature which I am too ignorant to feel — just as you see what a Greek sentence stands for which means nothing to me . "
32603	32684	32685	32685	he	189	" Bless me , now , how different people are ! But you had a bad style of teaching , you know — else this is just the thing for girls — sketching , fine art and so on . But you took to drawing plans ; you do n't understand morbidezza , and that kind of thing . You will come to my house , I hope , and I will show you what I did in this way , "
32852	32862	32864	32868	that good - natured man	1488	" We will turn over my Italian engravings together , "
32870	32952	32864	32868	that good - natured man	1488	" I have no end of those things , that I have laid by for years . One gets rusty in this part of the country , you know . Not you , Casaubon ; you stick to your studies ; but my best ideas get undermost — out of use , you know . You clever young men must guard against indolence . I was too indolent , you know : else I might have been anywhere at one time . "
32953	32960	32962	32963	Mr. Casaubon	189	" That is a seasonable admonition , "
32965	32986	32962	32963	Mr. Casaubon	189	" but now we will pass on to the house , lest the young ladies should be tired of standing . "
33119	33132	33134	33135	Mr. Brooke	175	" What is your nephew going to do with himself , Casaubon ? "
33142	33153	33134	33135	Mr. Brooke	175	" My cousin , you mean — not my nephew . "
33154	33172	33085	33087	Mr. Will Ladislaw	261	" Yes , yes , cousin . But in the way of a career , you know . "
33173	33255	33134	33135	Mr. Brooke	175	" The answer to that question is painfully doubtful . On leaving Rugby he declined to go to an English university , where I would gladly have placed him , and chose what I must consider the anomalous course of studying at Heidelberg . And now he wants to go abroad again , without any special object , save the vague purpose of what he calls culture , preparation for he knows not what . He declines to choose a profession . "
33256	33269	33134	33135	Mr. Brooke	175	" He has no means but what you furnish , I suppose . "
33270	33315	33317	33318	Mr. Casaubon	189	" I have always given him and his friends reason to understand that I would furnish in moderation what was necessary for providing him with a scholarly education , and launching him respectably . I am therefore bound to fulfil the expectation so raised , "
33340	33360	33362	33363	Mr. Brooke	175	" He has a thirst for travelling ; perhaps he may turn out a Bruce or a Mungo Park , "
33365	33377	33362	33363	Mr. Brooke	175	" I had a notion of that myself at one time . "
33378	33478	33335	33335	Dorothea	189	" No , he has no bent towards exploration , or the enlargement of our geognosis : that would be a special purpose which I could recognize with some approbation , though without felicitating him on a career which so often ends in premature and violent death . But so far is he from having any desire for a more accurate knowledge of the earth 's surface , that he said he should prefer not to know the sources of the Nile , and that there should be some unknown regions preserved as hunting grounds for the poetic imagination . "
33479	33491	33493	33494	Mr. Brooke	175	" Well , there is something in that , you know , "
33503	33557	33493	33494	Mr. Brooke	175	" It is , I fear , nothing more than a part of his general inaccuracy and indisposition to thoroughness of all kinds , which would be a bad augury for him in any profession , civil or sacred , even were he so far submissive to ordinary rule as to choose one . "
33558	33570	33572	33572	Dorothea	189	" Perhaps he has conscientious scruples founded on his own unfitness , "
33584	33611	33572	33572	Dorothea	189	" Because the law and medicine should be very serious professions to undertake , should they not ? People 's lives and fortunes depend on them . "
33612	33759	33760	33760	Celia	169	" Doubtless ; but I fear that my young relative Will Ladislaw is chiefly determined in his aversion to these callings by a dislike to steady application , and to that kind of acquirement which is needful instrumentally , but is not charming or immediately inviting to self - indulgent taste . I have insisted to him on what Aristotle has stated with admirable brevity , that for the achievement of any work regarded as an end there must be a prior exercise of many energies or acquired facilities of a secondary order , demanding patience . I have pointed to my own manuscript volumes , which represent the toil of years preparatory to a work not yet accomplished . But in vain . To careful reasoning of this kind he replies by calling himself Pegasus , and every form of prescribed work ' harness . ' "
33777	33806	33808	33809	Mr. Brooke	175	" Well , you know , he may turn out a Byron , a Chatterton , a Churchill — that sort of thing — there 's no telling , "
33811	33828	33808	33809	Mr. Brooke	175	" Shall you let him go to Italy , or wherever else he wants to go ? "
33829	33864	33760	33760	Celia	169	" Yes ; I have agreed to furnish him with moderate supplies for a year or so ; he asks no more . I shall let him be tried by the test of freedom . "
33865	33873	33875	33875	Dorothea	189	" That is very kind of you , "
33885	33936	33880	33881	Mr. Casaubon	189	" It is noble . After all , people may really have in them some vocation which is not quite plain to themselves , may they not ? They may seem idle and weak because they are growing . We should be very patient with each other , I think . "
33937	33955	33957	33957	Celia	169	" I suppose it is being engaged to be married that has made you think patience good , "
33974	33985	33957	33957	Celia	169	" You mean that I am very impatient , Celia . "
33986	34001	34002	34002	Celia	169	" Yes ; when people do n't do and say just what you like . "
34008	34011	33957	33957	Celia	169	" saying things "
34924	34930	34895	34895	he	189	" Key to all Mythologies , "
35881	35894	35895	35895	he	189	" I still regret that your sister is not to accompany us , "
35923	35965	35895	35895	he	189	" You will have many lonely hours , Dorothea , for I shall be constrained to make the utmost use of my time during our stay in Rome , and I should feel more at liberty if you had a companion . "
35968	35975	35895	35895	he	189	" I should feel more at liberty "
35994	36003	36004	36004	she	1525	" You must have misunderstood me very much , "
36007	36043	36004	36004	she	1525	" if you think I should not enter into the value of your time — if you think that I should not willingly give up whatever interfered with your using it to the best purpose . "
36044	36056	36058	36059	Mr. Casaubon	189	" That is very amiable in you , my dear Dorothea , "
36071	36108	36058	36059	Mr. Casaubon	189	" but if you had a lady as your companion , I could put you both under the care of a cicerone , and we could thus achieve two purposes in the same space of time . "
36109	36120	36122	36122	Dorothea	189	" I beg you will not refer to this again , "
36153	36203	36140	36140	she	1525	" Pray do not be anxious about me . I shall have so much to think of when I am alone . And Tantripp will be a sufficient companion , just to take care of me . I could not bear to have Celia : she would be miserable . "
36331	36344	36345	36345	she	1525	" Surely I am in a strangely selfish weak state of mind , "
36350	36375	36345	36345	she	1525	" How can I have a husband who is so much above me without knowing that he needs me less than I need him ? "
36762	36765	36784	36785	Mr. Standish	273	" asides . "
36766	36782	36784	36785	Mr. Standish	273	" A fine woman , Miss Brooke ! an uncommonly fine woman , by God ! "
36905	36966	37165	37166	Mr. Chichely	275	" Yes , but not my style of woman : I like a woman who lays herself out a little more to please us . There should be a little filigree about a woman — something of the coquette . A man likes a sort of challenge . The more of a dead set she makes at you the better . "
36967	36975	36977	36978	Mr. Standish	273	" There 's some truth in that , "
36985	37016	37165	37166	Mr. Chichely	275	" And , by God , it 's usually the way with them . I suppose it answers some wise ends : Providence made them so , eh , Bulstrode ? "
37017	37029	37031	37032	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" I should be disposed to refer coquetry to another source , "
37034	37044	37031	37032	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" I should rather refer it to the devil . "
37045	37062	37064	37065	Mr. Chichely	275	" Ay , to be sure , there should be a little devil in a woman , "
37082	37135	37064	37065	Mr. Chichely	275	" And I like them blond , with a certain gait , and a swan neck . Between ourselves , the mayor 's daughter is more to my taste than Miss Brooke or Miss Celia either . If I were a marrying man I should choose Miss Vincy before either of them . "
37136	37145	37147	37148	Mr. Standish	273	" Well , make up , make up , "
37152	37164	37147	37148	Mr. Standish	273	" you see the middle - aged fellows carry the day . "
37363	37377	37379	37383	the mild but stately dowager	1573	" Where can all the strength of those medicines go , my dear ? "
37400	37406	37408	37409	the Rector	6953	" It strengthens the disease , "
37426	37466	37408	37409	the Rector	6953	" Everything depends on the constitution : some people make fat , some blood , and some bile — that 's my view of the matter ; and whatever they take is a sort of grist to the mill . "
37467	37502	37603	37604	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Then she ought to take medicines that would reduce — reduce the disease , you know , if you are right , my dear . And I think what you say is reasonable . "
37503	37531	37408	37409	the Rector	6953	" Certainly it is reasonable . You have two sorts of potatoes , fed on the same soil . One of them grows more and more watery — "
37532	37590	37408	37409	the Rector	6953	" Ah ! like this poor Mrs. Renfrew — that is what I think . Dropsy ! There is no swelling yet — it is inward . I should say she ought to take drying medicines , should n't you?—or a dry hot - air bath . Many things might be tried , of a drying nature . "
37591	37601	37603	37604	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Let her try a certain person 's pamphlets , "
37614	37621	37603	37604	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" He does not want drying . "
37622	37628	37630	37631	Lady Chettam	239	" Who , my dear ? "
37648	37673	37630	37631	Lady Chettam	239	" The bridegroom — Casaubon . He has certainly been drying up faster since the engagement : the flame of passion , I suppose . "
37674	37687	37689	37690	Lady Chettam	239	" I should think he is far from having a good constitution , "
37698	37712	37689	37690	Lady Chettam	239	" And then his studies — so very dry , as you say . "
37713	37779	37630	37631	Lady Chettam	239	" Really , by the side of Sir James , he looks like a death 's head skinned over for the occasion . Mark my words : in a year from this time that girl will hate him . She looks up to him as an oracle now , and by - and - by she will be at the other extreme . All flightiness ! "
37780	37812	37689	37690	Lady Chettam	239	" How very shocking ! I fear she is headstrong . But tell me — you know all about him — is there anything very bad ? What is the truth ? "
37813	37835	37630	37631	Lady Chettam	239	" The truth ? he is as bad as the wrong physic — nasty to take , and sure to disagree . "
37836	37846	37848	37849	Lady Chettam	239	" There could not be anything worse than that , "
37873	37894	37860	37860	she	239	" However , James will hear nothing against Miss Brooke . He says she is the mirror of women still . "
37895	37929	37630	37631	Lady Chettam	239	" That is a generous make - believe of his . Depend upon it , he likes little Celia better , and she appreciates him . I hope you like my little Celia ? "
37930	37987	37630	37631	Lady Chettam	239	" Certainly ; she is fonder of geraniums , and seems more docile , though not so fine a figure . But we were talking of physic . Tell me about this new young surgeon , Mr. Lydgate . I am told he is wonderfully clever : he certainly looks it — a fine brow indeed . "
37988	38005	37860	37860	she	239	" He is a gentleman . I heard him talking to Humphrey . He talks well . "
38006	38124	37630	37631	Lady Chettam	239	" Yes . Mr. Brooke says he is one of the Lydgates of Northumberland , really well connected . One does not expect it in a practitioner of that kind . For my own part , I like a medical man more on a footing with the servants ; they are often all the cleverer . I assure you I found poor Hicks 's judgment unfailing ; I never knew him wrong . He was coarse and butcher - like , but he knew my constitution . It was a loss to me his going off so suddenly . Dear me , what a very animated conversation Miss Brooke seems to be having with this Mr. Lydgate ! "
38125	38135	38137	38138	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" She is talking cottages and hospitals with him , "
38149	38168	38139	38147	, whose ears and power of interpretation were quick	1579	" I believe he is a sort of philanthropist , so Brooke is sure to take him up . "
38169	38172	38174	38175	Lady Chettam	239	" James , "
38182	38198	38174	38175	Lady Chettam	239	" bring Mr. Lydgate and introduce him to me . I want to test him . "
38355	38359	38353	38353	He	278	" I think so "
38384	38393	38394	38394	she	239	" I am quite pleased with your protege , "
38403	38410	38412	38413	Mr. Brooke	175	" My protege?—dear me!—who is that ? "
38415	38434	38412	38413	Mr. Brooke	175	" This young Lydgate , the new doctor . He seems to me to understand his profession admirably . "
38435	38497	38394	38394	she	239	" Oh , Lydgate ! he is not my protege , you know ; only I knew an uncle of his who sent me a letter about him . However , I think he is likely to be first - rate — has studied in Paris , knew Broussais ; has ideas , you know — wants to raise the profession . "
38498	38518	38520	38521	Mr. Brooke	175	" Lydgate has lots of ideas , quite new , about ventilation and diet , that sort of thing , "
38543	38566	38568	38569	Mr. Standish	273	" Hang it , do you think that is quite sound?—upsetting the old treatment , which has made Englishmen what they are ? "
38571	38582	38584	38585	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" Medical knowledge is at a low ebb among us , "
38601	38630	38584	38585	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" I , for my part , hail the advent of Mr. Lydgate . I hope to find good reason for confiding the new hospital to his management . "
38631	38638	38640	38641	Mr. Standish	273	" That is all very fine , "
38651	38705	38648	38649	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" if you like him to try experiments on your hospital patients , and kill a few people for charity I have no objection . But I am not going to hand money out of my purse to have experiments tried on me . I like treatment that has been tested a little . "
38706	38728	38730	38731	Mr. Brooke	175	" Well , you know , Standish , every dose you take is an experiment - an experiment , you know , "
38738	38748	38750	38751	Mr. Standish	273	" Oh , if you talk in that sense ! "
38774	38797	38799	38800	Mr. Vincy	282	" I should be glad of any treatment that would cure me without reducing me to a skeleton , like poor Grainger , "
38829	38860	38826	38827	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" It 's an uncommonly dangerous thing to be left without any padding against the shafts of disease , as somebody said,—and I think it a very good expression myself . "
38931	38948	38949	38949	he	278	" She is a good creature — that fine girl — but a little too earnest , "
38952	38997	38949	38949	he	278	" It is troublesome to talk to such women . They are always wanting reasons , yet they are too ignorant to understand the merits of any question , and usually fall back on their moral sense to settle things after their own taste . "
39172	39204	39164	39164	he	278	" She is grace itself ; she is perfectly lovely and accomplished . That is what a woman ought to be : she ought to produce the effect of exquisite music . "
40889	40911	40870	40870	she	1701	" Knock at Mr. Fred 's door again , Pritchard , and tell him it has struck half - past ten . "
40967	40970	40972	40972	Rosamond	283	" Mamma , "
40974	41009	40972	40972	Rosamond	283	" when Fred comes down I wish you would not let him have red herrings . I can not bear the smell of them all over the house at this hour of the morning . "
41010	41054	40950	40950	she	1701	" Oh , my dear , you are so hard on your brothers ! It is the only fault I have to find with you . You are the sweetest temper in the world , but you are so tetchy with your brothers . "
41055	41071	40950	40950	she	1701	" Not tetchy , mamma : you never hear me speak in an unladylike way . "
41072	41083	40950	40950	she	1701	" Well , but you want to deny them things . "
41084	41090	40950	40950	she	1701	" Brothers are so unpleasant . "
41091	41130	40950	40950	she	1701	" Oh , my dear , you must allow for young men . Be thankful if they have good hearts . A woman must learn to put up with little things . You will be married some day . "
41131	41141	40950	40950	she	1701	" Not to any one who is like Fred . "
41142	41239	40950	40950	she	1701	" Do n't decry your own brother , my dear . Few young men have less against them , although he could n't take his degree — I'm sure I ca n't understand why , for he seems to me most clever . And you know yourself he was thought equal to the best society at college . So particular as you are , my dear , I wonder you are not glad to have such a gentlemanly young man for a brother . You are always finding fault with Bob because he is not Fred . "
41240	41252	40950	40950	she	1701	" Oh no , mamma , only because he is Bob . "
41253	41274	40950	40950	she	1701	" Well , my dear , you will not find any Middlemarch young man who has not something against him . "
41275	41276	41277	41277	Rosamond	283	" But"—here
41304	41315	41290	41290	She	283	" But I shall not marry any Middlemarch young man . "
41316	41356	40950	40950	she	1701	" So it seems , my love , for you have as good as refused the pick of them ; and if there 's better to be had , I 'm sure there 's no girl better deserves it . "
41357	41377	40950	40950	she	1701	" Excuse me , mamma — I wish you would not say , ' the pick of them . ' "
41378	41386	41290	41290	She	283	" Why , what else are they ? "
41387	41400	40950	40950	she	1701	" I mean , mamma , it is rather a vulgar expression . "
41401	41420	40950	40950	she	1701	" Very likely , my dear ; I never was a good speaker . What should I say ? "
41421	41427	41290	41290	She	283	" The best of them . "
41428	41468	40950	40950	she	1701	" Why , that seems just as plain and common . If I had had time to think , I should have said , ' the most superior young men . ' But with your education you must know . "
41469	41477	41479	41480	Mr. Fred	282	" What must Rosy know , mother ? "
41523	41536	41538	41539	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Whether it 's right to say ' superior young men , ' "
41545	41567	41538	41539	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Oh , there are so many superior teas and sugars now . Superior is getting to be shopkeepers ' slang . "
41568	41578	41580	41580	Rosamond	283	" Are you beginning to dislike slang , then ? "
41586	41604	41580	41580	Rosamond	283	" Only the wrong sort . All choice of words is slang . It marks a class . "
41605	41616	41538	41539	Mrs. Vincy	290	" There is correct English : that is not slang . "
41617	41648	41538	41539	Mrs. Vincy	290	" I beg your pardon : correct English is the slang of prigs who write history and essays . And the strongest slang of all is the slang of poets . "
41649	41662	41580	41580	Rosamond	283	" You will say anything , Fred , to gain your point . "
41663	41683	41538	41539	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Well , tell me whether it is slang or poetry to call an ox a leg - plaiter . "
41684	41696	41538	41539	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Of course you can call it poetry if you like . "
41697	41737	41580	41580	Rosamond	283	" Aha , Miss Rosy , you do n't know Homer from slang . I shall invent a new game ; I shall write bits of slang and poetry on slips , and give them to you to separate . "
41738	41752	41754	41755	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Dear me , how amusing it is to hear young people talk ! "
41761	41773	41775	41775	Fred	282	" Have you got nothing else for my breakfast , Pritchard ? "
41821	41829	41789	41789	he	282	" Should you like eggs , sir ? "
41830	41841	41775	41775	Fred	282	" Eggs , no ! Bring me a grilled bone . "
41842	41847	41849	41849	Rosamond	283	" Really , Fred , "
41859	41906	41849	41849	Rosamond	283	" if you must have hot things for breakfast , I wish you would come down earlier . You can get up at six o'clock to go out hunting ; I can not understand why you find it so difficult to get up on other mornings . "
41907	41929	41775	41775	Fred	282	" That is your want of understanding , Rosy . I can get up to go hunting because I like it . "
41930	41952	41775	41775	Fred	282	" What would you think of me if I came down two hours after every one else and ordered grilled bone ? "
41953	41965	41967	41967	Fred	282	" I should think you were an uncommonly fast young lady , "
41977	41995	41967	41967	Fred	282	" I can not see why brothers are to make themselves disagreeable , any more than sisters . "
41996	42025	41775	41775	Fred	282	" I do n't make myself disagreeable ; it is you who find me so . Disagreeable is a word that describes your feelings and not my actions . "
42026	42037	41775	41775	Fred	282	" I think it describes the smell of grilled bone . "
42038	42094	41967	41967	Fred	282	" Not at all . It describes a sensation in your little nose associated with certain finicking notions which are the classics of Mrs. Lemon 's school . Look at my mother ; you do n't see her objecting to everything except what she does herself . She is my notion of a pleasant woman . "
42095	42108	42110	42111	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Bless you both , my dears , and do n't quarrel , "
42117	42138	42110	42111	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Come , Fred , tell us all about the new doctor . How is your uncle pleased with him ? "
42139	42186	41967	41967	Fred	282	" Pretty well , I think . He asks Lydgate all sorts of questions and then screws up his face while he hears the answers , as if they were pinching his toes . That 's his way . Ah , here comes my grilled bone . "
42187	42212	41967	41967	Fred	282	" But how came you to stay out so late , my dear ? You only said you were going to your uncle 's . "
42213	42231	42110	42111	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Oh , I dined at Plymdale 's . We had whist . Lydgate was there too . "
42232	42263	41967	41967	Fred	282	" And what do you think of him ? He is very gentlemanly , I suppose . They say he is of excellent family — his relations quite county people . "
42264	42267	42269	42269	Fred	282	" Yes , "
42271	42309	42269	42269	Fred	282	" There was a Lydgate at John 's who spent no end of money . I find this man is a second cousin of his . But rich men may have very poor devils for second cousins . "
42310	42325	42327	42327	Rosamond	283	" It always makes a difference , though , to be of good family , "
42412	42423	42425	42429	the bright - faced matron	1717	" I thought it was odd his name was Tertius , "
42431	42456	42425	42429	the bright - faced matron	1717	" but of course it 's a name in the family . But now , tell us exactly what sort of man he is . "
42457	42476	42425	42429	the bright - faced matron	1717	" Oh , tallish , dark , clever — talks well — rather a prig , I think . "
42477	42490	42492	42492	Rosamond	283	" I never can make out what you mean by a prig , "
42494	42506	42492	42492	Rosamond	283	" A fellow who wants to show that he has opinions . "
42507	42518	42520	42521	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Why , my dear , doctors must have opinions , "
42523	42531	42520	42521	Mrs. Vincy	290	" What are they there for else ? "
42532	42561	42492	42492	Rosamond	283	" Yes , mother , the opinions they are paid for . But a prig is a fellow who is always making you a present of his opinions . "
42562	42571	42573	42573	Rosamond	283	" I suppose Mary Garth admires Mr. Lydgate , "
42582	42590	42592	42592	Fred	282	" Really , I ca n't say . "
42624	42642	42617	42617	himself	282	" If you are jealous of her , go oftener to Stone Court yourself and eclipse her . "
42643	42665	42681	42682	Mrs. Vincy	290	" I wish you would not be so vulgar , Fred . If you have finished , pray ring the bell . "
42666	42680	42681	42682	Mrs. Vincy	290	" It is true , though — what your brother says , Rosamond , "
42693	42786	42681	42682	Mrs. Vincy	290	" It is a thousand pities you have n't patience to go and see your uncle more , so proud of you as he is , and wanted you to live with him . There 's no knowing what he might have done for you as well as for Fred . God knows , I 'm fond of having you at home with me , but I can part with my children for their good . And now it stands to reason that your uncle Featherstone will do something for Mary Garth . "
42787	42807	42809	42809	Rosamond	283	" Mary Garth can bear being at Stone Court , because she likes that better than being a governess , "
42816	42844	42809	42809	Rosamond	283	" I would rather not have anything left to me if I must earn it by enduring much of my uncle 's cough and his ugly relations . "
42845	42956	42681	42682	Mrs. Vincy	290	" He ca n't be long for this world , my dear ; I would n't hasten his end , but what with asthma and that inward complaint , let us hope there is something better for him in another . And I have no ill - will towards Mary Garth , but there 's justice to be thought of . And Mr. Featherstone 's first wife brought him no money , as my sister did . Her nieces and nephews ca n't have so much claim as my sister 's . And I must say I think Mary Garth a dreadful plain girl — more fit for a governess . "
42957	42969	42971	42971	Fred	282	" Every one would not agree with you there , mother , "
42984	42990	42992	42993	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Well , my dear , "
42998	43049	42992	42993	Mrs. Vincy	290	" if she had some fortune left her,—a man marries his wife 's relations , and the Garths are so poor , and live in such a small way . But I shall leave you to your studies , my dear ; for I must go and do some shopping . "
43050	43059	43061	43061	Rosamond	283	" Fred 's studies are not very deep , "
43068	43076	43061	43061	Rosamond	283	" he is only reading a novel . "
43077	43096	43098	43099	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Well , well , by - and - by he 'll go to his Latin and things , "
43109	43157	43098	43099	Mrs. Vincy	290	" There 's a fire in the smoking - room on purpose . It 's your father 's wish , you know — Fred , my dear — and I always tell him you will be good , and go to college again to take your degree . "
43173	43186	43188	43188	Rosamond	283	" I suppose you are not going out riding to - day ? "
43199	43204	43188	43188	Rosamond	283	" No ; why ? "
43205	43217	43160	43160	his	282	" Papa says I may have the chestnut to ride now . "
43218	43242	43188	43188	Rosamond	283	" You can go with me to - morrow , if you like . Only I am going to Stone Court , remember . "
43243	43260	43188	43188	Rosamond	283	" I want to ride so much , it is indifferent to me where we go . "
43275	43283	43285	43285	Fred	282	" Oh , I say , Rosy , "
43296	43315	43285	43285	Fred	282	" if you are going to the piano , let me come and play some airs with you . "
43316	43325	43188	43188	Rosamond	283	" Pray do not ask me this morning . "
43326	43332	43188	43188	Rosamond	283	" Why not this morning ? "
43333	43365	43285	43285	Fred	282	" Really , Fred , I wish you would leave off playing the flute . A man looks very silly playing the flute . And you play so out of tune . "
43366	43388	43188	43188	Rosamond	283	" When next any one makes love to you , Miss Rosamond , I will tell him how obliging you are . "
43389	43420	43188	43188	Rosamond	283	" Why should you expect me to oblige you by hearing you play the flute , any more than I should expect you to oblige me by not playing it ? "
43421	43434	43285	43285	Fred	282	" And why should you expect me to take you out riding ? "
43464	43470	43188	43188	Rosamond	283	" Ar hyd y nos , "
43471	43477	43188	43188	Rosamond	283	" Ye banks and braes , "
43484	43490	43497	43497	he	282	" Instructor on the Flute ; "
43909	43913	43915	43915	Rosamond	283	" Dear me , "
43917	43930	43915	43915	Rosamond	283	" I hope none of my uncle 's horrible relations are there . "
43931	44010	44056	44056	she	283	" They are , though . That is Mrs. Waule 's gig — the last yellow gig left , I should think . When I see Mrs. Waule in it , I understand how yellow can have been worn for mourning . That gig seems to me more funereal than a hearse . But then Mrs. Waule always has black crape on . How does she manage it , Rosy ? Her friends ca n't always be dying . "
44011	44028	44030	44030	Rosamond	283	" I do n't know at all . And she is not in the least evangelical , "
44049	44055	44056	44056	she	283	" And , not poor , "
44065	44132	44056	44056	she	283	" No , by George ! They are as rich as Jews , those Waules and Featherstones ; I mean , for people like them , who do n't want to spend anything . And yet they hang about my uncle like vultures , and are afraid of a farthing going away from their side of the family . But I believe he hates them all . "
44191	44198	44204	44204	she	304	" to enjoy their good opinion . "
44257	44265	44267	44268	Mr. Featherstone	292	" What are you driving at there ? "
44395	44446	44867	44867	he	292	" The doctors ca n't master that cough , brother . It 's just like what I have ; for I 'm your own sister , constitution and everything . But , as I was saying , it 's a pity Mrs. Vincy 's family ca n't be better conducted . "
44447	44468	44867	44867	he	292	" Tchah ! you said nothing o ' the sort . You said somebody had made free with my name . "
44469	44517	44867	44867	he	292	" And no more than can be proved , if what everybody says is true . My brother Solomon tells me it 's the talk up and down in Middlemarch how unsteady young Vincy is , and has been forever gambling at billiards since home he came . "
44518	44561	44867	44867	he	292	" Nonsense ! What 's a game at billiards ? It 's a good gentlemanly game ; and young Vincy is not a clodhopper . If your son John took to billiards , now , he 'd make a fool of himself . "
44562	44662	44867	44867	he	292	" Your nephew John never took to billiards or any other game , brother , and is far from losing hundreds of pounds , which , if what everybody says is true , must be found somewhere else than out of Mr. Vincy the father 's pocket . For they say he 's been losing money for years , though nobody would think so , to see him go coursing and keeping open house as they do . And I 've heard say Mr. Bulstrode condemns Mrs. Vincy beyond anything for her flightiness , and spoiling her children so . "
44663	44677	44867	44867	he	292	" What 's Bulstrode to me ? I do n't bank with him . "
44678	44796	44867	44867	he	292	" Well , Mrs. Bulstrode is Mr. Vincy 's own sister , and they do say that Mr. Vincy mostly trades on the Bank money ; and you may see yourself , brother , when a woman past forty has pink strings always flying , and that light way of laughing at everything , it 's very unbecoming . But indulging your children is one thing , and finding money to pay their debts is another . And it 's openly said that young Vincy has raised money on his expectations . I do n't say what expectations . Miss Garth hears me , and is welcome to tell again . I know young people hang together . "
44797	44806	44808	44809	Mary Garth	301	" No , thank you , Mrs. Waule , "
44811	44824	44808	44809	Mary Garth	301	" I dislike hearing scandal too much to wish to repeat it . "
44870	44896	44867	44867	he	292	" And who pretends to say Fred Vincy has n't got expectations ? Such a fine , spirited fellow is like enough to have 'em . "
44930	45023	44909	44909	she	304	" Whether or no , brother , it is naturally painful to me and my brother Solomon to hear your name made free with , and your complaint being such as may carry you off sudden , and people who are no more Featherstones than the Merry - Andrew at the fair , openly reckoning on your property coming to them . And me your own sister , and Solomon your own brother ! And if that 's to be it , what has it pleased the Almighty to make families for ? "
45035	45044	45046	45047	Mr. Featherstone	292	" Come , out with it , Jane ! "
45053	45081	45046	45047	Mr. Featherstone	292	" You mean to say , Fred Vincy has been getting somebody to advance him money on what he says he knows about my will , eh ? "
45082	45089	45091	45092	Mrs. Waule	304	" I never said so , brother "
45103	45166	45091	45092	Mrs. Waule	304	" It was told me by my brother Solomon last night when he called coming from market to give me advice about the old wheat , me being a widow , and my son John only three - and - twenty , though steady beyond anything . And he had it from most undeniable authority , and not one , but many . "
45167	45211	45046	45047	Mr. Featherstone	292	" Stuff and nonsense ! I do n't believe a word of it . It 's all a got - up story . Go to the window , missy ; I thought I heard a horse . See if the doctor 's coming . "
45212	45293	45091	45092	Mrs. Waule	304	" Not got up by me , brother , nor yet by Solomon , who , whatever else he may be — and I do n't deny he has oddities — has made his will and parted his property equal between such kin as he 's friends with ; though , for my part , I think there are times when some should be considered more than others . But Solomon makes it no secret what he means to do . "
45294	45300	45302	45303	Mr. Featherstone	292	" The more fool he ! "
45379	45387	45372	45373	Mrs. Waule	304	" How do you do , miss ? "
45412	45417	45418	45418	he	848	" Heyday , miss ! "
45423	45434	45418	45418	he	848	" you have a fine colour . Where 's Fred ? "
45435	45447	45418	45418	he	848	" Seeing about the horses . He will be in presently . "
45448	45463	45418	45418	he	848	" Sit down , sit down . Mrs. Waule , you 'd better go . "
45552	45630	45547	45547	her	6855	" Brother , I hope the new doctor will be able to do something for you . Solomon says there 's great talk of his cleverness . I 'm sure it 's my wish you should be spared . And there 's none more ready to nurse you than your own sister and your own nieces , if you 'd only say the word . There 's Rebecca , and Joanna , and Elizabeth , you know . "
45631	45734	45547	45547	her	6855	" Ay , ay , I remember — you'll see I 've remembered 'em all — all dark and ugly . They 'd need have some money , eh ? There never was any beauty in the women of our family ; but the Featherstones have always had some money , and the Waules too . Waule had money too . A warm man was Waule . Ay , ay ; money 's a good egg ; and if you ' ve got money to leave behind you , lay it in a warm nest . Good - by , Mrs. Waule . "
45958	45965	45967	45968	Mr. Featherstone	292	" You two misses go away , "
45970	45978	45967	45968	Mr. Featherstone	292	" I want to speak to Fred . "
45979	45998	46000	46000	Mary	301	" Come into my room , Rosamond , you will not mind the cold for a little while , "
46190	46242	46243	46243	Fred	282	" So , sir , you 've been paying ten per cent for money which you 've promised to pay off by mortgaging my land when I 'm dead and gone , eh ? You put my life at a twelvemonth , say . But I can alter my will yet . "
46295	46323	46260	46260	he	282	" I do n't know what you refer to , sir . I have certainly never borrowed any money on such an insecurity . Please do explain . "
46324	46394	46260	46260	he	282	" No , sir , it 's you must explain . I can alter my will yet , let me tell you . I 'm of sound mind — can reckon compound interest in my head , and remember every fool 's name as well as I could twenty years ago . What the deuce ? I 'm under eighty . I say , you must contradict this story . "
46395	46403	46404	46404	Fred	282	" I have contradicted it , sir , "
46454	46468	46437	46438	old Featherstone	320	" But I contradict it again . The story is a silly lie . "
46469	46482	46553	46553	his	320	" Nonsense ! you must bring dockiments . It comes from authority . "
46483	46509	46437	46438	old Featherstone	320	" Name the authority , and make him name the man of whom I borrowed the money , and then I can disprove the story . "
46510	46548	46437	46438	old Featherstone	320	" It 's pretty good authority , I think — a man who knows most of what goes on in Middlemarch . It 's that fine , religious , charitable uncle o ' yours . Come now ! "
46561	46565	46553	46553	his	320	" Mr. Bulstrode ? "
46566	46572	46437	46438	old Featherstone	320	" Who else , eh ? "
46573	46609	46437	46438	old Featherstone	320	" Then the story has grown into this lie out of some sermonizing words he may have let fall about me . Do they pretend that he named the man who lent me the money ? "
46610	46680	46553	46553	his	320	" If there is such a man , depend upon it Bulstrode knows him . But , supposing you only tried to get the money lent , and did n't get it — Bulstrode ' ud know that too . You bring me a writing from Bulstrode to say he does n't believe you 've ever promised to pay your debts out o ' my land . Come now ! "
46716	46795	46796	46796	Fred	282	" You must be joking , sir . Mr. Bulstrode , like other men , believes scores of things that are not true , and he has a prejudice against me . I could easily get him to write that he knew no facts in proof of the report you speak of , though it might lead to unpleasantness . But I could hardly ask him to write down what he believes or does not believe about me . "
46814	46826	46796	46796	Fred	282	" That is hardly a thing for a gentleman to ask . "
46835	46973	46796	46796	Fred	282	" Ay , I know what you mean . You 'd sooner offend me than Bulstrode . And what 's he?—he 's got no land hereabout that ever I heard tell of . A speckilating fellow ! He may come down any day , when the devil leaves off backing him . And that 's what his religion means : he wants God A'mighty to come in . That 's nonsense ! There 's one thing I made out pretty clear when I used to go to church — and it 's this : God A'mighty sticks to the land . He promises land , and He gives land , and He makes chaps rich with corn and cattle . But you take the other side . You like Bulstrode and speckilation better than Featherstone and land . "
46974	46982	46984	46984	Fred	282	" I beg your pardon , sir , "
47003	47011	47012	47012	He	282	" I like neither Bulstrode nor speculation . "
47021	47037	47039	47040	old Featherstone	292	" Well , well , you can do without me , that 's pretty clear , "
47055	47123	47124	47124	Fred	282	" You neither want a bit of land to make a squire of you instead of a starving parson , nor a lift of a hundred pound by the way . It 's all one to me . I can make five codicils if I like , and I shall keep my bank - notes for a nest - egg . It 's all one to me . "
47165	47193	47128	47128	Featherstone	292	" I am not ungrateful , sir . I never meant to show disregard for any kind intentions you might have towards me . On the contrary . "
47194	47279	47280	47280	Fred	282	" Very good . Then prove it . You bring me a letter from Bulstrode saying he does n't believe you 've been cracking and promising to pay your debts out o ' my land , and then , if there 's any scrape you 've got into , we 'll see if I ca n't back you a bit . Come now ! That 's a bargain . Here , give me your arm . I 'll try and walk round the room . "
47394	47397	47392	47392	Klopstock	323	" Messiah , "
47403	47408	47429	47429	Fred	282	" Gentleman 's Magazine . "
47409	47428	47429	47429	Fred	282	" Read me the names o ' the books . Come now ! you 're a college man . "
47435	47454	47429	47429	Fred	282	" What did missy want with more books ? What must you be bringing her more books for ? "
47455	47469	47429	47429	Fred	282	" They amuse her , sir . She is very fond of reading . "
47470	47476	47478	47479	Mr. Featherstone	292	" A little too fond , "
47483	47548	47478	47479	Mr. Featherstone	292	" She was for reading when she sat with me . But I put a stop to that . She 's got the newspaper to read out loud . That 's enough for one day , I should think . I ca n't abide to see her reading to herself . You mind and not bring her any more books , do you hear ? "
47549	47557	47558	47558	Fred	282	" Yes , sir , I hear . "
47578	47583	47585	47586	Mr. Featherstone	292	" Ring the bell , "
47588	47596	47585	47586	Mr. Featherstone	292	" I want missy to come down . "
48145	48167	48140	48140	she	301	" What a brown patch I am by the side of you , Rosy ! You are the most unbecoming companion . "
48168	48197	48199	48199	Rosamond	283	" Oh no ! No one thinks of your appearance , you are so sensible and useful , Mary . Beauty is of very little consequence in reality , "
48222	48228	48230	48230	Mary	301	" You mean my beauty , "
48238	48249	48235	48235	Rosamond	283	" Poor Mary , she takes the kindest things ill . "
48254	48262	48251	48251	she	283	" What have you been doing lately ? "
48263	48292	48235	48235	Rosamond	283	" I ? Oh , minding the house — pouring out syrup — pretending to be amiable and contented — learning to have a bad opinion of everybody . "
48293	48302	48251	48251	she	283	" It is a wretched life for you . "
48303	48306	48308	48308	Mary	301	" No , "
48320	48333	48308	48308	Mary	301	" I think my life is pleasanter than your Miss Morgan 's . "
48334	48348	48251	48251	she	283	" Yes ; but Miss Morgan is so uninteresting , and not young . "
48349	48375	48251	48251	she	283	" She is interesting to herself , I suppose ; and I am not at all sure that everything gets easier as one gets older . "
48376	48379	48381	48381	Rosamond	283	" No , "
48385	48410	48411	48411	she	283	" one wonders what such people do , without any prospect . To be sure , there is religion as a support . But , "
48416	48432	48411	48411	she	283	" it is very different with you , Mary . You may have an offer . "
48433	48446	48251	48251	she	283	" Has any one told you he means to make me one ? "
48447	48473	48251	48251	she	283	" Of course not . I mean , there is a gentleman who may fall in love with you , seeing you almost every day . "
48493	48503	48504	48504	she	301	" Does that always make people fall in love ? "
48509	48524	48504	48504	she	301	" it seems to me quite as often a reason for detesting each other . "
48525	48542	48251	48251	she	283	" Not when they are interesting and agreeable . I hear that Mr. Lydgate is both . "
48543	48549	48551	48551	Mary	301	" Oh , Mr. Lydgate ! "
48560	48569	48570	48570	she	301	" You want to know something about him , "
48581	48589	48570	48570	she	301	" Merely , how you like him . "
48590	48629	48251	48251	she	283	" There is no question of liking at present . My liking always wants some little kindness to kindle it . I am not magnanimous enough to like people who speak to me without seeming to see me . "
48630	48636	48638	48638	Rosamond	283	" Is he so haughty ? "
48644	48654	48638	48638	Rosamond	283	" You know that he is of good family ? "
48655	48667	48251	48251	she	283	" No ; he did not give that as a reason . "
48668	48691	48251	48251	she	283	" Mary ! you are the oddest girl . But what sort of looking man is he ? Describe him to me . "
48692	48758	48638	48638	Rosamond	283	" How can one describe a man ? I can give you an inventory : heavy eyebrows , dark eyes , a straight nose , thick dark hair , large solid white hands — and — let me see — oh , an exquisite cambric pocket - handkerchief . But you will see him . You know this is about the time of his visits . "
48769	48786	48759	48759	Rosamond	283	" I rather like a haughty manner . I can not endure a rattling young man . "
48787	48840	48251	48251	she	283	" I did not tell you that Mr. Lydgate was haughty ; but il y en a pour tous les gouts , as little Mamselle used to say , and if any girl can choose the particular sort of conceit she would like , I should think it is you , Rosy . "
48841	48852	48638	48638	Rosamond	283	" Haughtiness is not conceit ; I call Fred conceited . "
48853	48882	48759	48759	Rosamond	283	" I wish no one said any worse of him . He should be more careful . Mrs. Waule has been telling uncle that Fred is very unsteady . "
48906	48908	48759	48759	Rosamond	283	" unsteady "
48932	48939	48941	48941	Rosamond	283	" Oh , Fred is horrid ! "
48959	48967	48943	48943	She	283	" What do you mean by horrid ? "
48968	48988	48920	48920	she	301	" He is so idle , and makes papa so angry , and says he will not take orders . "
48989	48997	48943	48943	She	283	" I think Fred is quite right . "
48998	49019	48943	48943	She	283	" How can you say he is quite right , Mary ? I thought you had more sense of religion . "
49020	49030	48920	48920	she	301	" He is not fit to be a clergyman . "
49031	49039	48943	48943	She	283	" But he ought to be fit . "—"Well
49064	49065	49054	49062	some other people who are in the same case	1813	" "
49088	49089	49086	49086	clergymen	1816	" "

49138	49144	49131	49131	I	0	" said Mary , dryly . "
49153	49163	49148	49148	you	0	" said Rosamond , inclined to push this point . "
49170	49176	49164	49164	I	0	" said Mary , laughing ; "

49292	49301	49290	49290	Mary	301	" said Rosamond , with her gravest mildness ; "

49320	49326	49315	49315	you	0	" said Mary , angrily . "
49337	49345	49335	49335	Mary	301	" said Rosamond , mildly as ever . "

49529	49572	49575	49575	thou	1827	" Mr. Lydgate was rather late this morning , but the visitors stayed long enough to see him ; for Mr. Featherstone asked Rosamond to sing to him , and she herself was so kind as to propose a second favourite song of his—"Flow
49577	49581	49575	49575	thou	1827	river"—after she had sung "
49586	49680	49682	49682	him	1829	" ( which she detested ) . This hard - headed old Overreach approved of the sentimental song , as the suitable garnish for girls , and also as fundamentally fine , sentiment being the right thing for a song . Mr. Featherstone was still applauding the last performance , and assuring missy that her voice was as clear as a blackbird 's , when Mr. Lydgate 's horse passed the window . His dull expectation of the usual disagreeable routine with an aged patient — who can hardly believe that medicine would not "
49684	49840	49841	49842	Miss Rosy	298	" if the doctor were only clever enough — added to his general disbelief in Middlemarch charms , made a doubly effective background to this vision of Rosamond , whom old Featherstone made haste ostentatiously to introduce as his niece , though he had never thought it worth while to speak of Mary Garth in that light . Nothing escaped Lydgate in Rosamond 's graceful behavior : how delicately she waived the notice which the old man 's want of taste had thrust upon her by a quiet gravity , not showing her dimples on the wrong occasion , but showing them afterwards in speaking to Mary , to whom she addressed herself with so much good - natured interest , that Lydgate , after quickly examining Mary more fully than he had done before , saw an adorable kindness in Rosamond 's eyes . But Mary from some cause looked rather out of temper . "
49861	49866	49841	49842	Miss Rosy	298	" said Mr. Featherstone . "
49875	49876	49841	49842	Miss Rosy	298	" "
49888	49927	49928	49928	Fred	282	" said Rosamond , rising to reach her hat , which she had laid aside before singing , so that her flower - like head on its white stem was seen in perfection above her riding - habit . "
49935	49936	49928	49928	Fred	282	" "
49940	49963	49928	49928	Fred	282	" said Fred , who had his own reasons for not being in the best spirits , and wanted to get away . "
49970	50037	49967	49968	a musician	1833	" said Lydgate , following her with his eyes . ( Every nerve and muscle in Rosamond was adjusted to the consciousness that she was being looked at . She was by nature an actress of parts that entered into her physique : she even acted her own character , and so well , that she did not know it to be precisely her own . ) "
50048	50053	50064	50064	Fred	282	" said Mr. Featherstone , "
50072	50073	50074	50074	I	0	" "
50093	50094	50085	50085	My	0	" "
50105	50606	50103	50103	uncle	6726	" said Rosamond , with a pretty lightness , going towards her whip , which lay at a distance . Lydgate was quick in anticipating her . He reached the whip before she did , and turned to present it to her . She bowed and looked at him : he of course was looking at her , and their eyes met with that peculiar meeting which is never arrived at by effort , but seems like a sudden divine clearance of haze . I think Lydgate turned a little paler than usual , but Rosamond blushed deeply and felt a certain astonishment . After that , she was really anxious to go , and did not know what sort of stupidity her uncle was talking of when she went to shake hands with him . Yet this result , which she took to be a mutual impression , called falling in love , was just what Rosamond had contemplated beforehand . Ever since that important new arrival in Middlemarch she had woven a little future , of which something like this scene was the necessary beginning . Strangers , whether wrecked and clinging to a raft , or duly escorted and accompanied by portmanteaus , have always had a circumstantial fascination for the virgin mind , against which native merit has urged itself in vain . And a stranger was absolutely necessary to Rosamond 's social romance , which had always turned on a lover and bridegroom who was not a Middlemarcher , and who had no connections at all like her own : of late , indeed , the construction seemed to demand that he should somehow be related to a baronet . Now that she and the stranger had met , reality proved much more moving than anticipation , and Rosamond could not doubt that this was the great epoch of her life . She judged of her own symptoms as those of awakening love , and she held it still more natural that Mr. Lydgate should have fallen in love at first sight of her . These things happened so often at balls , and why not by the morning light , when the complexion showed all the better for it ? Rosamond , though no older than Mary , was rather used to being fallen in love with ; but she , for her part , had remained indifferent and fastidiously critical towards both fresh sprig and faded bachelor . And here was Mr. Lydgate suddenly corresponding to her ideal , being altogether foreign to Middlemarch , carrying a certain air of distinction congruous with good family , and possessing connections which offered vistas of that middle - class heaven , rank ; a man of talent , also , whom it would be especially delightful to enslave : in fact , a man who had touched her nature quite newly , and brought a vivid interest into her life which was better than any fancied "
50610	51298	51299	51299	Rosy	298	" such as she was in the habit of opposing to the actual . Thus , in riding home , both the brother and the sister were preoccupied and inclined to be silent . Rosamond , whose basis for her structure had the usual airy slightness , was of remarkably detailed and realistic imagination when the foundation had been once presupposed ; and before they had ridden a mile she was far on in the costume and introductions of her wedded life , having determined on her house in Middlemarch , and foreseen the visits she would pay to her husband 's high - bred relatives at a distance , whose finished manners she could appropriate as thoroughly as she had done her school accomplishments , preparing herself thus for vaguer elevations which might ultimately come . There was nothing financial , still less sordid , in her previsions : she cared about what were considered refinements , and not about the money that was to pay for them . Fred 's mind , on the other hand , was busy with an anxiety which even his ready hopefulness could not immediately quell . He saw no way of eluding Featherstone 's stupid demand without incurring consequences which he liked less even than the task of fulfilling it . His father was already out of humor with him , and would be still more so if he were the occasion of any additional coolness between his own family and the Bulstrodes . Then , he himself hated having to go and speak to his uncle Bulstrode , and perhaps after drinking wine he had said many foolish things about Featherstone 's property , and these had been magnified by report . Fred felt that he made a wretched figure as a fellow who bragged about expectations from a queer old miser like Featherstone , and went to beg for certificates at his bidding . But — those expectations ! He really had them , and he saw no agreeable alternative if he gave them up ; besides , he had lately made a debt which galled him extremely , and old Featherstone had almost bargained to pay it off . The whole affair was miserably small : his debts were small , even his expectations were not anything so very magnificent . Fred had known men to whom he would have been ashamed of confessing the smallness of his scrapes . Such ruminations naturally produced a streak of misanthropic bitterness . To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer , and inevitable heir to nothing in particular , while such men as Mainwaring and Vyan — certainly life was a poor business , when a spirited young fellow , with a good appetite for the best of everything , had so poor an outlook . It had not occurred to Fred that the introduction of Bulstrode 's name in the matter was a fiction of old Featherstone 's ; nor could this have made any difference to his position . He saw plainly enough that the old man wanted to exercise his power by tormenting him a little , and also probably to get some satisfaction out of seeing him on unpleasant terms with Bulstrode . Fred fancied that he saw to the bottom of his uncle Featherstone 's soul , though in reality half what he saw there was no more than the reflex of his own inclinations . The difficult task of knowing another soul is not for young gentlemen whose consciousness is chiefly made up of their own wishes . Fred 's main point of debate with himself was , whether he should tell his father , or try to get through the affair without his father 's knowledge . It was probably Mrs. Waule who had been talking about him ; and if Mary Garth had repeated Mrs. Waule 's report to Rosamond , it would be sure to reach his father , who would as surely question him about it . He said to Rosamond , as they slackened their pace — "

51557	52013	51544	51544	She	301	" Before reaching home , Fred concluded that he would tell the whole affair as simply as possible to his father , who might perhaps take on himself the unpleasant business of speaking to Bulstrode . In consequence of what he had heard from Fred , Mr. Vincy determined to speak with Mr. Bulstrode in his private room at the Bank at half - past one , when he was usually free from other callers . But a visitor had come in at one o'clock , and Mr. Bulstrode had so much to say to him , that there was little chance of the interview being over in half an hour . The banker 's speech was fluent , but it was also copious , and he used up an appreciable amount of time in brief meditative pauses . Do not imagine his sickly aspect to have been of the yellow , black - haired sort : he had a pale blond skin , thin gray - besprinkled brown hair , light - gray eyes , and a large forehead . Loud men called his subdued tone an undertone , and sometimes implied that it was inconsistent with openness ; though there seems to be no reason why a loud man should not be given to concealment of anything except his own voice , unless it can be shown that Holy Writ has placed the seat of candor in the lungs . Mr. Bulstrode had also a deferential bending attitude in listening , and an apparently fixed attentiveness in his eyes which made those persons who thought themselves worth hearing infer that he was seeking the utmost improvement from their discourse . Others , who expected to make no great figure , disliked this kind of moral lantern turned on them . If you are not proud of your cellar , there is no thrill of satisfaction in seeing your guest hold up his wine - glass to the light and look judicial . Such joys are reserved for conscious merit . Hence Mr. Bulstrode 's close attention was not agreeable to the publicans and sinners in Middlemarch ; it was attributed by some to his being a Pharisee , and by others to his being Evangelical . Less superficial reasoners among them wished to know who his father and grandfather were , observing that five - and - twenty years ago nobody had ever heard of a Bulstrode in Middlemarch . To his present visitor , Lydgate , the scrutinizing look was a matter of indifference : he simply formed an unfavourable opinion of the banker 's constitution , and concluded that he had an eager inward life with little enjoyment of tangible things . "
52032	52042	52020	52020	you	0	" the banker observed , after a brief pause . "
52145	52146	52132	52132	he	334	" "
52162	52166	52132	52132	he	334	" said Lydgate . "
52272	52408	52409	52409	I	0	" One of Lydgate 's gifts was a voice habitually deep and sonorous , yet capable of becoming very low and gentle at the right moment . About his ordinary bearing there was a certain fling , a fearless expectation of success , a confidence in his own powers and integrity much fortified by contempt for petty obstacles or seductions of which he had had no experience . But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression of unaffected good - will . Mr. Bulstrode perhaps liked him the better for the difference between them in pitch and manners ; he certainly liked him the better , as Rosamond did , for being a stranger in Middlemarch . One can begin so many things with a new person!—even begin to be a better man . "
52420	52425	52426	52426	I	0	" Mr. Bulstrode answered ; "
52550	52551	52552	52552	I	0	" "
52558	52564	52552	52552	I	0	" said Lydgate , smiling , "

52781	52829	52830	52830	I	0	" Mr. Bulstrode , bending and looking intently , found the form which Lydgate had given to his agreement not quite suited to his comprehension . Under such circumstances a judicious man changes the topic and enters on ground where his own gifts may be more useful . "
52834	52838	52853	52854	Mr. Lydgate	278	" he said , "

53073	53079	53059	53059	I	0	" said Lydgate , bluntly . "
53084	53094	53081	53081	I	0	" Mr. Bulstrode continued , looking still more serious , "
53132	53133	53115	53116	Mr. Tyke	336	" "
53169	53181	53184	53184	you	1885	" Lydgate smiled , but he was bent on being circumspect . "
53198	53208	53184	53184	you	1885	But"—here Mr. Bulstrode began to speak with a more chiselled emphasis—"the

53445	53464	53439	53439	I	0	" Mr. Bulstrode 's voice had become a loud and agitated whisper as he said the last words . "
53470	53565	53466	53466	we	1894	" said Lydgate . But he was not sorry that the door was now opened , and Mr. Vincy was announced . That florid sociable personage was become more interesting to him since he had seen Rosamond . Not that , like her , he had been weaving any future in which their lots were united ; but a man naturally remembers a charming girl with pleasure , and is willing to dine where he may see her again . Before he took leave , Mr. Vincy had given that invitation which he had been "
53571	53620	53466	53466	we	1894	" for Rosamond at breakfast had mentioned that she thought her uncle Featherstone had taken the new doctor into great favour . Mr. Bulstrode , alone with his brother - in - law , poured himself out a glass of water , and opened a sandwich - box . "
53633	53634	53621	53621	I	0	" "
53651	53663	53621	53621	I	0	" said Mr. Vincy , unable to omit his portable theory . "
53666	53682	53621	53621	I	0	" he went on , accenting the word , as if to dismiss all irrelevance , "
53702	53703	53699	53699	Fred	282	" "
53727	53728	53729	53729	I	0	" "

53915	54053	53908	53908	You	282	" To point out other people 's errors was a duty that Mr. Bulstrode rarely shrank from , but Mr. Vincy was not equally prepared to be patient . When a man has the immediate prospect of being mayor , and is ready , in the interests of commerce , to take up a firm attitude on politics generally , he has naturally a sense of his importance to the framework of things which seems to throw questions of private conduct into the background . And this particular reproof irritated him more than any other . It was eminently superfluous to him to be told that he was reaping the consequences . But he felt his neck under Bulstrode 's yoke ; and though he usually enjoyed kicking , he was anxious to refrain from that relief . "

54351	54378	54349	54349	Vincy	282	" said Mr. Bulstrode , who , finishing his sandwich , had thrown himself back in his chair , and shaded his eyes as if weary . "

55168	55188	55193	55193	Harriet	338	" said Mr. Vincy , thoroughly nettled ( a result which was seldom much retarded by previous resolutions ) . "
55311	55312	55313	55313	You	1929	" "
55333	55334	55318	55318	you	1929	" "

55458	55473	55474	55474	I	0	" said Mr. Bulstrode , with a trifle more eagerness and paleness than usual . "
55662	55843	55657	55657	I	0	" Mr. Vincy rose , began to button his great - coat , and looked steadily at his brother - in - law , meaning to imply a demand for a decisive answer . This was not the first time that Mr. Bulstrode had begun by admonishing Mr. Vincy , and had ended by seeing a very unsatisfactory reflection of himself in the coarse unflattering mirror which that manufacturer 's mind presented to the subtler lights and shadows of his fellow - men ; and perhaps his experience ought to have warned him how the scene would end . But a full - fed fountain will be generous with its waters even in the rain , when they are worse than useless ; and a fine fount of admonition is apt to be equally irrepressible . It was not in Mr. Bulstrode 's nature to comply directly in consequence of uncomfortable suggestions . Before changing his course , he always needed to shape his motives and bring them into accordance with his habitual standard . He said , at last — "
55868	55869	55860	55860	I	0	" "
55896	56026	55881	55881	I	0	" Mr. Bulstrode 's consultation of Harriet seemed to have had the effect desired by Mr. Vincy , for early the next morning a letter came which Fred could carry to Mr. Featherstone as the required testimony . The old gentleman was staying in bed on account of the cold weather , and as Mary Garth was not to be seen in the sitting - room , Fred went up - stairs immediately and presented the letter to his uncle , who , propped up comfortably on a bed - rest , was not less able than usual to enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating mankind . He put on his spectacles to read the letter , pursing up his lips and drawing down their corners . "
56220	56244	56245	56245	you	1970	" Mr. Featherstone here looked over his spectacles at Fred , while he handed back the letter to him with a contemptuous gesture , "
56262	56266	56254	56254	Bulstrode	274	" Fred coloured . "
56300	56301	56321	56321	you	0	" "
56324	56344	56321	56321	you	0	" said Mr. Featherstone , curtly , keeping on his spectacles , but withdrawing his hands under his wraps . "
56351	56362	56345	56345	I	0	" Fred with difficulty restrained himself from venting his irritation . "
56381	56382	56374	56374	I	0	" "
56399	56412	56393	56393	I	0	" It was a servant who came in answer to the bell . "
56418	56425	56414	56414	missy	324	" said Mr. Featherstone , impatiently . "
56434	56445	56429	56429	she	324	" He spoke in the same tone when Mary came . "
56477	56619	56466	56466	I	0	" Mary 's eyes looked rather red , as if she had been crying . It was clear that Mr. Featherstone was in one of his most snappish humors this morning , and though Fred had now the prospect of receiving the much - needed present of money , he would have preferred being free to turn round on the old tyrant and tell him that Mary Garth was too good to be at his beck . Though Fred had risen as she entered the room , she had barely noticed him , and looked as if her nerves were quivering with the expectation that something would be thrown at her . But she never had anything worse than words to dread . When she went to reach the waistcoat from a peg , Fred went up to her and said , "
56623	56624	56466	56466	I	0	" "
56641	56646	56629	56629	You	1979	" said Mr. Featherstone . "
56657	56742	56653	56653	I	0	" he added , when the waistcoat was laid down by him . It was usual with him to season his pleasure in showing favour to one person by being especially disagreeable to another , and Mary was always at hand to furnish the condiment . When his own relatives came she was treated better . Slowly he took out a bunch of keys from the waistcoat pocket , and slowly he drew forth a tin box which was under the bed - clothes . "
56757	56775	56780	56780	sir	6934	" he said , looking above his spectacles and pausing in the act of opening the lid . "
56811	57040	57041	57041	I	0	" But Fred was of a hopeful disposition , and a vision had presented itself of a sum just large enough to deliver him from a certain anxiety . When Fred got into debt , it always seemed to him highly probable that something or other — he did not necessarily conceive what — would come to pass enabling him to pay in due time . And now that the providential occurrence was apparently close at hand , it would have been sheer absurdity to think that the supply would be short of the need : as absurd as a faith that believed in half a miracle for want of strength to believe in a whole one . The deep - veined hands fingered many bank - notes one after the other , laying them down flat again , while Fred leaned back in his chair , scorning to look eager . He held himself to be a gentleman at heart , and did not like courting an old fellow for his money . At last , Mr. Featherstone eyed him again over his spectacles and presented him with a little sheaf of notes : Fred could see distinctly that there were but five , as the less significant edges gaped towards him . But then , each might mean fifty pounds . He took them , saying — "
57051	57081	57041	57041	I	0	" and was going to roll them up without seeming to think of their value . But this did not suit Mr. Featherstone , who was eying him intently . "
57111	57112	57113	57113	I	0	" "
57140	57249	57131	57131	I	0	" Fred was not so happy , however , after he had counted them . For they actually presented the absurdity of being less than his hopefulness had decided that they must be . What can the fitness of things mean , if not their fitness to a man 's expectations ? Failing this , absurdity and atheism gape behind him . The collapse for Fred was severe when he found that he held no more than five twenties , and his share in the higher education of this country did not seem to help him . Nevertheless he said , with rapid changes in his fair complexion — "

57323	57337	57339	57339	you	6934	" said Fred , who had had time to recover his cheerful air . "

57716	57744	57697	57697	you	6934	" Fred thought that Mr. Featherstone had never been so disagreeable before . True , he had never before given him quite so much money at once . "
57757	57775	57755	57755	sir	6934	" said Fred , rising with the letter as if he would put it in the fire . "
57794	57951	57755	57755	sir	6934	" Fred carried the letter to the fire , and thrust the poker through it with much zest . He longed to get out of the room , but he was a little ashamed before his inner self , as well as before his uncle , to run away immediately after pocketing the money . Presently , the farm - bailiff came up to give his master a report , and Fred , to his unspeakable relief , was dismissed with the injunction to come again soon . He had longed not only to be set free from his uncle , but also to find Mary Garth . She was now in her usual place by the fire , with sewing in her hands and a book open on the little table by her side . Her eyelids had lost some of their redness now , and she had her usual air of self - command . "
57959	57969	57953	57953	I	0	" she said , half rising as Fred entered . "
57983	58022	57978	57978	Simmons	340	" Mary sat down again , and resumed her work . She was certainly treating him with more indifference than usual : she did not know how affectionately indignant he had felt on her behalf up - stairs . "

58255	58281	58237	58237	I	0	" Fred also had his pride , and was not going to show that he knew what had called forth this outburst of Mary 's . "

59880	59988	59848	59848	you	282	" said Fred , sulkily , taking up his hat and whip . His complexion showed patches of pale pink and dead white . Like many a plucked idle young gentleman , he was thoroughly in love , and with a plain girl , who had no money ! But having Mr. Featherstone 's land in the background , and a persuasion that , let Mary say what she would , she really did care for him , Fred was not utterly in despair . When he got home , he gave four of the twenties to his mother , asking her to keep them for him . "
60018	60019	59848	59848	you	282	" "
60026	60589	59848	59848	you	282	" said Mrs. Vincy . She doted on her eldest son and her youngest girl ( a child of six ) , whom others thought her two naughtiest children . The mother 's eyes are not always deceived in their partiality : she at least can best judge who is the tender , filial - hearted child . And Fred was certainly very fond of his mother . Perhaps it was his fondness for another person also that made him particularly anxious to take some security against his own liability to spend the hundred pounds . For the creditor to whom he owed a hundred and sixty held a firmer security in the shape of a bill signed by Mary 's father . A great historian , as he insisted on calling himself , who had the happiness to be dead a hundred and twenty years ago , and so to take his place among the colossi whose huge legs our living pettiness is observed to walk under , glories in his copious remarks and digressions as the least imitable part of his work , and especially in those initial chapters to the successive books of his history , where he seems to bring his armchair to the proscenium and chat with us in all the lusty ease of his fine English . But Fielding lived when the days were longer ( for time , like money , is measured by our needs ) , when summer afternoons were spacious , and the clock ticked slowly in the winter evenings . We belated historians must not linger after his example ; and if we did so , it is probable that our chat would be thin and eager , as if delivered from a campstool in a parrot - house . I at least have so much to do in unraveling certain human lots , and seeing how they were woven and interwoven , that all the light I can command must be concentrated on this particular web , and not dispersed over that tempting range of relevancies called the universe . At present I have to make the new settler Lydgate better known to any one interested in him than he could possibly be even to those who had seen the most of him since his arrival in Middlemarch . For surely all must admit that a man may be puffed and belauded , envied , ridiculed , counted upon as a tool and fallen in love with , or at least selected as a future husband , and yet remain virtually unknown — known merely as a cluster of signs for his neighbors ' false suppositions . There was a general impression , however , that Lydgate was not altogether a common country doctor , and in Middlemarch at that time such an impression was significant of great things being expected from him . For everybody 's family doctor was remarkably clever , and was understood to have immeasurable skill in the management and training of the most skittish or vicious diseases . The evidence of his cleverness was of the higher intuitive order , lying in his lady - patients ' immovable conviction , and was unassailable by any objection except that their intuitions were opposed by others equally strong ; each lady who saw medical truth in Wrench and "
60593	60597	59848	59848	you	282	" regarding Toller and "
60601	60688	59848	59848	you	282	" as medical perdition . For the heroic times of copious bleeding and blistering had not yet departed , still less the times of thorough - going theory , when disease in general was called by some bad name , and treated accordingly without shilly - shally — as if , for example , it were to be called insurrection , which must not be fired on with blank - cartridge , but have its blood drawn at once . The strengtheners and the lowerers were all "
60690	61154	59848	59848	you	282	" men in somebody 's opinion , which is really as much as can be said for any living talents . Nobody 's imagination had gone so far as to conjecture that Mr. Lydgate could know as much as Dr. Sprague and Dr. Minchin , the two physicians , who alone could offer any hope when danger was extreme , and when the smallest hope was worth a guinea . Still , I repeat , there was a general impression that Lydgate was something rather more uncommon than any general practitioner in Middlemarch . And this was true . He was but seven - and - twenty , an age at which many men are not quite common — at which they are hopeful of achievement , resolute in avoidance , thinking that Mammon shall never put a bit in their mouths and get astride their backs , but rather that Mammon , if they have anything to do with him , shall draw their chariot . He had been left an orphan when he was fresh from a public school . His father , a military man , had made but little provision for three children , and when the boy Tertius asked to have a medical education , it seemed easier to his guardians to grant his request by apprenticing him to a country practitioner than to make any objections on the score of family dignity . He was one of the rarer lads who early get a decided bent and make up their minds that there is something particular in life which they would like to do for its own sake , and not because their fathers did it . Most of us who turn to any subject with love remember some morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down an untried volume , or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker , or for very lack of books began to listen to the voices within , as the first traceable beginning of our love . Something of that sort happened to Lydgate . He was a quick fellow , and when hot from play , would toss himself in a corner , and in five minutes be deep in any sort of book that he could lay his hands on : if it were Rasselas or Gulliver , so much the better , but Bailey 's Dictionary would do , or the Bible with the Apocrypha in it . Something he must read , when he was not riding the pony , or running and hunting , or listening to the talk of men . All this was true of him at ten years of age ; he had then read through "
61164	61213	59848	59848	you	282	" which was neither milk for babes , nor any chalky mixture meant to pass for milk , and it had already occurred to him that books were stuff , and that life was stupid . His school studies had not much modified that opinion , for though he "
61215	61744	59848	59848	you	282	" his classics and mathematics , he was not pre - eminent in them . It was said of him , that Lydgate could do anything he liked , but he had certainly not yet liked to do anything remarkable . He was a vigorous animal with a ready understanding , but no spark had yet kindled in him an intellectual passion ; knowledge seemed to him a very superficial affair , easily mastered : judging from the conversation of his elders , he had apparently got already more than was necessary for mature life . Probably this was not an exceptional result of expensive teaching at that period of short - waisted coats , and other fashions which have not yet recurred . But , one vacation , a wet day sent him to the small home library to hunt once more for a book which might have some freshness for him : in vain ! unless , indeed , he took down a dusty row of volumes with gray - paper backs and dingy labels — the volumes of an old Cyclopaedia which he had never disturbed . It would at least be a novelty to disturb them . They were on the highest shelf , and he stood on a chair to get them down . But he opened the volume which he first took from the shelf : somehow , one is apt to read in a makeshift attitude , just where it might seem inconvenient to do so . The page he opened on was under the head of Anatomy , and the first passage that drew his eyes was on the valves of the heart . He was not much acquainted with valves of any sort , but he knew that valvae were folding - doors , and through this crevice came a sudden light startling him with his first vivid notion of finely adjusted mechanism in the human frame . A liberal education had of course left him free to read the indecent passages in the school classics , but beyond a general sense of secrecy and obscenity in connection with his internal structure , had left his imagination quite unbiassed , so that for anything he knew his brains lay in small bags at his temples , and he had no more thought of representing to himself how his blood circulated than how paper served instead of gold . But the moment of vocation had come , and before he got down from his chair , the world was made new to him by a presentiment of endless processes filling the vast spaces planked out of his sight by that wordy ignorance which he had supposed to be knowledge . From that hour Lydgate felt the growth of an intellectual passion . We are not afraid of telling over and over again how a man comes to fall in love with a woman and be wedded to her , or else be fatally parted from her . Is it due to excess of poetry or of stupidity that we are never weary of describing what King James called a woman 's "
61750	61773	59848	59848	you	282	" never weary of listening to the twanging of the old Troubadour strings , and are comparatively uninterested in that other kind of "
61777	62170	59848	59848	you	282	" which must be wooed with industrious thought and patient renunciation of small desires ? In the story of this passion , too , the development varies : sometimes it is the glorious marriage , sometimes frustration and final parting . And not seldom the catastrophe is bound up with the other passion , sung by the Troubadours . For in the multitude of middle - aged men who go about their vocations in a daily course determined for them much in the same way as the tie of their cravats , there is always a good number who once meant to shape their own deeds and alter the world a little . The story of their coming to be shapen after the average and fit to be packed by the gross , is hardly ever told even in their consciousness ; for perhaps their ardor in generous unpaid toil cooled as imperceptibly as the ardor of other youthful loves , till one day their earlier self walked like a ghost in its old home and made the new furniture ghastly . Nothing in the world more subtle than the process of their gradual change ! In the beginning they inhaled it unknowingly : you and I may have sent some of our breath towards infecting them , when we uttered our conforming falsities or drew our silly conclusions : or perhaps it came with the vibrations from a woman 's glance . Lydgate did not mean to be one of those failures , and there was the better hope of him because his scientific interest soon took the form of a professional enthusiasm : he had a youthful belief in his bread - winning work , not to be stifled by that initiation in makeshift called his ' prentice days ; and he carried to his studies in London , Edinburgh , and Paris , the conviction that the medical profession as it might be was the finest in the world ; presenting the most perfect interchange between science and art ; offering the most direct alliance between intellectual conquest and the social good . Lydgate 's nature demanded this combination : he was an emotional creature , with a flesh - and - blood sense of fellowship which withstood all the abstractions of special study . He cared not only for "
62173	62697	59848	59848	you	282	" but for John and Elizabeth , especially Elizabeth . There was another attraction in his profession : it wanted reform , and gave a man an opportunity for some indignant resolve to reject its venal decorations and other humbug , and to be the possessor of genuine though undemanded qualifications . He went to study in Paris with the determination that when he came home again he would settle in some provincial town as a general practitioner , and resist the irrational severance between medical and surgical knowledge in the interest of his own scientific pursuits , as well as of the general advance : he would keep away from the range of London intrigues , jealousies , and social truckling , and win celebrity , however slowly , as Jenner had done , by the independent value of his work . For it must be remembered that this was a dark period ; and in spite of venerable colleges which used great efforts to secure purity of knowledge by making it scarce , and to exclude error by a rigid exclusiveness in relation to fees and appointments , it happened that very ignorant young gentlemen were promoted in town , and many more got a legal right to practise over large areas in the country . Also , the high standard held up to the public mind by the College of Physicians , which gave its peculiar sanction to the expensive and highly rarefied medical instruction obtained by graduates of Oxford and Cambridge , did not hinder quackery from having an excellent time of it ; for since professional practice chiefly consisted in giving a great many drugs , the public inferred that it might be better off with more drugs still , if they could only be got cheaply , and hence swallowed large cubic measures of physic prescribed by unscrupulous ignorance which had taken no degrees . Considering that statistics had not yet embraced a calculation as to the number of ignorant or canting doctors which absolutely must exist in the teeth of all changes , it seemed to Lydgate that a change in the units was the most direct mode of changing the numbers . He meant to be a unit who would make a certain amount of difference towards that spreading change which would one day tell appreciably upon the averages , and in the mean time have the pleasure of making an advantageous difference to the viscera of his own patients . But he did not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common . He was ambitious of a wider effect : he was fired with the possibility that he might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link in the chain of discovery . Does it seem incongruous to you that a Middlemarch surgeon should dream of himself as a discoverer ? Most of us , indeed , know little of the great originators until they have been lifted up among the constellations and already rule our fates . But that Herschel , for example , who "
62703	64968	59848	59848	you	282	heavens"—did he not once play a provincial church - organ , and give music - lessons to stumbling pianists ? Each of those Shining Ones had to walk on the earth among neighbors who perhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments than of anything which was to give him a title to everlasting fame : each of them had his little local personal history sprinkled with small temptations and sordid cares , which made the retarding friction of his course towards final companionship with the immortals . Lydgate was not blind to the dangers of such friction , but he had plenty of confidence in his resolution to avoid it as far as possible : being seven - and - twenty , he felt himself experienced . And he was not going to have his vanities provoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of the capital , but to live among people who could hold no rivalry with that pursuit of a great idea which was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice of his profession . There was fascination in the hope that the two purposes would illuminate each other : the careful observation and inference which was his daily work , the use of the lens to further his judgment in special cases , would further his thought as an instrument of larger inquiry . Was not this the typical pre - eminence of his profession ? He would be a good Middlemarch doctor , and by that very means keep himself in the track of far - reaching investigation . On one point he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his career : he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make a profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are exposing adulteration , or hold shares in a gambling - hell that they may have leisure to represent the cause of public morality . He intended to begin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite certainly within his reach , and much less of a problem than the demonstrating of an anatomical conception . One of these reforms was to act stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision , and simply prescribe , without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from druggists . This was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the style of general practitioner in a country town , and would be felt as offensive criticism by his professional brethren . But Lydgate meant to innovate in his treatment also , and he was wise enough to see that the best security for his practising honestly according to his belief was to get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary . Perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than the present ; we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when America was beginning to be discovered , when a bold sailor , even if he were wrecked , might alight on a new kingdom ; and about 1829 the dark territories of Pathology were a fine America for a spirited young adventurer . Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific , rational basis of his profession . The more he became interested in special questions of disease , such as the nature of fever or fevers , the more keenly he felt the need for that fundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of Bichat , who died when he was only one - and - thirty , but , like another Alexander , left a realm large enough for many heirs . That great Frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies , fundamentally considered , are not associations of organs which can be understood by studying them first apart , and then as it were federally ; but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues , out of which the various organs — brain , heart , lungs , and so on — are compacted , as the various accommodations of a house are built up in various proportions of wood , iron , stone , brick , zinc , and the rest , each material having its peculiar composition and proportions . No man , one sees , can understand and estimate the entire structure or its parts — what are its frailties and what its repairs , without knowing the nature of the materials . And the conception wrought out by Bichat , with his detailed study of the different tissues , acted necessarily on medical questions as the turning of gas - light would act on a dim , oil - lit street , showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms of maladies and the action of medicaments . But results which depend on human conscience and intelligence work slowly , and now at the end of 1829 , most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the old paths , and there was still scientific work to be done which might have seemed to be a direct sequence of Bichat 's . This great seer did not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the living organism , marking the limit of anatomical analysis ; but it was open to another mind to say , have not these structures some common basis from which they have all started , as your sarsnet , gauze , net , satin , and velvet from the raw cocoon ? Here would be another light , as of oxy - hydrogen , showing the very grain of things , and revising all former explanations . Of this sequence to Bichat 's work , already vibrating along many currents of the European mind , Lydgate was enamoured ; he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of living structure , and help to define men 's thought more accurately after the true order . The work had not yet been done , but only prepared for those who knew how to use the preparation . What was the primitive tissue ? In that way Lydgate put the question — not quite in the way required by the awaiting answer ; but such missing of the right word befalls many seekers . And he counted on quiet intervals to be watchfully seized , for taking up the threads of investigation — on many hints to be won from diligent application , not only of the scalpel , but of the microscope , which research had begun to use again with new enthusiasm of reliance . Such was Lydgate 's plan of his future : to do good small work for Middlemarch , and great work for the world . He was certainly a happy fellow at this time : to be seven - and - twenty , without any fixed vices , with a generous resolution that his action should be beneficent , and with ideas in his brain that made life interesting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic rites of costly observance , which the eight hundred pounds left him after buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying for . He was at a starting - point which makes many a man 's career a fine subject for betting , if there were any gentlemen given to that amusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an arduous purpose , with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of circumstance , all the niceties of inward balance , by which a man swims and makes his point or else is carried headlong . The risk would remain even with close knowledge of Lydgate 's character ; for character too is a process and an unfolding . The man was still in the making , as much as the Middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer , and there were both virtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding . The faults will not , I hope , be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him . Among our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little too self - confident and disdainful ; whose distinguished mind is a little spotted with commonness ; who is a little pinched here and protuberant there with native prejudices ; or whose better energies are liable to lapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient solicitations ? All these things might be alleged against Lydgate , but then , they are the periphrases of a polite preacher , who talks of Adam , and would not like to mention anything painful to the pew - renters . The particular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled have distinguishable physiognomies , diction , accent , and grimaces ; filling up parts in very various dramas . Our vanities differ as our noses do : all conceit is not the same conceit , but varies in correspondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us differs from another . Lydgate 's conceit was of the arrogant sort , never simpering , never impertinent , but massive in its claims and benevolently contemptuous . He would do a great deal for noodles , being sorry for them , and feeling quite sure that they could have no power over him : he had thought of joining the Saint Simonians when he was in Paris , in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines . All his faults were marked by kindred traits , and were those of a man who had a fine baritone , whose clothes hung well upon him , and who even in his ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction . Where then lay the spots of commonness ? says a young lady enamoured of that careless grace . How could there be any commonness in a man so well - bred , so ambitious of social distinction , so generous and unusual in his views of social duty ? As easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius if you take him unawares on the wrong subject , or as many a man who has the best will to advance the social millennium might be ill - inspired in imagining its lighter pleasures ; unable to go beyond Offenbach 's music , or the brilliant punning in the last burlesque . Lydgate 's spots of commonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices , which , in spite of noble intention and sympathy , were half of them such as are found in ordinary men of the world : that distinction of mind which belonged to his intellectual ardor , did not penetrate his feeling and judgment about furniture , or women , or the desirability of its being known ( without his telling ) that he was better born than other country surgeons . He did not mean to think of furniture at present ; but whenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes of reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there would be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best . As to women , he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous folly , which he meant to be final , since marriage at some distant period would of course not be impetuous . For those who want to be acquainted with Lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of impetuous folly , for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving of passion to which he was prone , together with the chivalrous kindness which helped to make him morally lovable . The story can be told without many words . It happened when he was studying in Paris , and just at the time when , over and above his other work , he was occupied with some galvanic experiments . One evening , tired with his experimenting , and not being able to elicit the facts he needed , he left his frogs and rabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation of unexplained shocks , and went to finish his evening at the theatre of the Porte Saint Martin , where there was a melodrama which he had already seen several times ; attracted , not by the ingenious work of the collabourating authors , but by an actress whose part it was to stab her lover , mistaking him for the evil - designing duke of the piece . Lydgate was in love with this actress , as a man is in love with a woman whom he never expects to speak to . She was a Provencale , with dark eyes , a Greek profile , and rounded majestic form , having that sort of beauty which carries a sweet matronliness even in youth , and her voice was a soft cooing . She had but lately come to Paris , and bore a virtuous reputation , her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover . It was her acting which was "
64976	65694	65695	65695	You	2070	" but the public was satisfied . Lydgate 's only relaxation now was to go and look at this woman , just as he might have thrown himself under the breath of the sweet south on a bank of violets for a while , without prejudice to his galvanism , to which he would presently return . But this evening the old drama had a new catastrophe . At the moment when the heroine was to act the stabbing of her lover , and he was to fall gracefully , the wife veritably stabbed her husband , who fell as death willed . A wild shriek pierced the house , and the Provencale fell swooning : a shriek and a swoon were demanded by the play , but the swooning too was real this time . Lydgate leaped and climbed , he hardly knew how , on to the stage , and was active in help , making the acquaintance of his heroine by finding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently in his arms . Paris rang with the story of this death:—was it a murder ? Some of the actress 's warmest admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt , and liked her the better for it ( such was the taste of those times ) ; but Lydgate was not one of these . He vehemently contended for her innocence , and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he had felt before , had passed now into personal devotion , and tender thought of her lot . The notion of murder was absurd : no motive was discoverable , the young couple being understood to dote on each other ; and it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should have brought these grave consequences . The legal investigation ended in Madame Laure 's release . Lydgate by this time had had many interviews with her , and found her more and more adorable . She talked little ; but that was an additional charm . She was melancholy , and seemed grateful ; her presence was enough , like that of the evening light . Lydgate was madly anxious about her affection , and jealous lest any other man than himself should win it and ask her to marry him . But instead of reopening her engagement at the Porte Saint Martin , where she would have been all the more popular for the fatal episode , she left Paris without warning , forsaking her little court of admirers . Perhaps no one carried inquiry far except Lydgate , who felt that all science had come to a stand - still while he imagined the unhappy Laure , stricken by ever - wandering sorrow , herself wandering , and finding no faithful comforter . Hidden actresses , however , are not so difficult to find as some other hidden facts , and it was not long before Lydgate gathered indications that Laure had taken the route to Lyons . He found her at last acting with great success at Avignon under the same name , looking more majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her arms . He spoke to her after the play , was received with the usual quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water , and obtained leave to visit her the next day ; when he was bent on telling her that he adored her , and on asking her to marry him . He knew that this was like the sudden impulse of a madman — incongruous even with his habitual foibles . No matter ! It was the one thing which he was resolved to do . He had two selves within him apparently , and they must learn to accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments . Strange , that some of us , with quick alternate vision , see beyond our infatuations , and even while we rave on the heights , behold the wide plain where our persistent self pauses and awaits us . To have approached Laure with any suit that was not reverentially tender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling towards her . "
65707	65740	65695	65695	You	2070	" she said to him the next day , sitting before him with folded arms , and looking at him with eyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders . "
65747	65748	65742	65743	all Englishmen	2071	" "
65800	65832	65833	65833	I	0	" Laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under her grand eyelids , until he was full of rapturous certainty , and knelt close to her knees . "
65839	65853	65833	65833	I	0	" she said , in her cooing way , keeping her arms folded . "
65859	65860	65861	65861	I	0	" "
65867	65873	65864	65864	I	0	" said Lydgate , deprecatingly . "
65893	65905	65906	65906	I	0	" Again Laure paused a little and then said , slowly , "
65912	65941	65906	65906	I	0	" Lydgate , strong man as he was , turned pale and trembled : moments seemed to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her . "
65949	65958	65959	65959	He	2074	" he said at last , even vehemently . "
65969	65970	65965	65965	you	2070	" "
66001	66002	66003	66004	Great God	372	" "
66006	66016	66003	66004	Great God	372	" said Lydgate , in a groan of horror . "
66024	66025	66026	66026	I	0	" "
66045	66085	66039	66039	I	0	" Lydgate stood mute , and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he looked at her . He saw this woman — the first to whom he had given his young adoration — amid the throng of stupid criminals . "
66093	66097	66086	66086	You	0	" she said . "
66111	66915	66105	66105	I	0	" Three days afterwards Lydgate was at his galvanism again in his Paris chambers , believing that illusions were at an end for him . He was saved from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his belief that human life might be made better . But he had more reason than ever for trusting his judgment , now that it was so experienced ; and henceforth he would take a strictly scientific view of woman , entertaining no expectations but such as were justified beforehand . No one in Middlemarch was likely to have such a notion of Lydgate 's past as has here been faintly shadowed , and indeed the respectable townsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager attempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did not come under their own senses . Not only young virgins of that town , but gray - bearded men also , were often in haste to conjecture how a new acquaintance might be wrought into their purposes , contented with very vague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him for that instrumentality . Middlemarch , in fact , counted on swallowing Lydgate and assimilating him very comfortably . The question whether Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain to the hospital was an exciting topic to the Middlemarchers ; and Lydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power exercised in the town by Mr. Bulstrode . The banker was evidently a ruler , but there was an opposition party , and even among his supporters there were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a compromise , and who frankly stated their impression that the general scheme of things , and especially the casualties of trade , required you to hold a candle to the devil . Mr. Bulstrode 's power was not due simply to his being a country banker , who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could touch the springs of their credit ; it was fortified by a beneficence that was at once ready and severe — ready to confer obligations , and severe in watching the result . He had gathered , as an industrious man always at his post , a chief share in administering the town charities , and his private charities were both minute and abundant . He would take a great deal of pains about apprenticing Tegg the shoemaker 's son , and he would watch over Tegg 's church - going ; he would defend Mrs. Strype the washerwoman against Stubbs 's unjust exaction on the score of her drying - ground , and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against Mrs. Strype . His private minor loans were numerous , but he would inquire strictly into the circumstances both before and after . In this way a man gathers a domain in his neighbors ' hope and fear as well as gratitude ; and power , when once it has got into that subtle region , propagates itself , spreading out of all proportion to its external means . It was a principle with Mr. Bulstrode to gain as much power as possible , that he might use it for the glory of God . He went through a great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust his motives , and make clear to himself what God 's glory required . But , as we have seen , his motives were not always rightly appreciated . There were many crass minds in Middlemarch whose reflective scales could only weigh things in the lump ; and they had a strong suspicion that since Mr. Bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion , eating and drinking so little as he did , and worreting himself about everything , he must have a sort of vampire 's feast in the sense of mastery . The subject of the chaplaincy came up at Mr. Vincy 's table when Lydgate was dining there , and the family connection with Mr. Bulstrode did not , he observed , prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the host himself , though his reasons against the proposed arrangement turned entirely on his objection to Mr. Tyke 's sermons , which were all doctrine , and his preference for Mr. Farebrother , whose sermons were free from that taint . Mr. Vincy liked well enough the notion of the chaplain 's having a salary , supposing it were given to Farebrother , who was as good a little fellow as ever breathed , and the best preacher anywhere , and companionable too . "
66924	66941	66919	66919	you	2078	" said Mr. Chichely , the coroner , a great coursing comrade of Mr. Vincy 's . "
66986	67012	66973	66973	I	0	" said Mr. Vincy , glancing first at Dr. Sprague , the senior physician of the town , and then at Lydgate who sat opposite . "
67032	67033	67029	67030	Mr. Lydgate	278	" "
67040	67044	67029	67030	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Lydgate ; "
67116	67127	67073	67075	the best fellow	2087	" Dr. Sprague , who was considered the physician of most "
67130	67140	67073	67075	the best fellow	2087	" though Dr. Minchin was usually said to have more "
67143	67229	67073	67075	the best fellow	2087	" divested his large heavy face of all expression , and looked at his wine - glass while Lydgate was speaking . Whatever was not problematical and suspected about this young man — for example , a certain showiness as to foreign ideas , and a disposition to unsettle what had been settled and forgotten by his elders — was positively unwelcome to a physician whose standing had been fixed thirty years before by a treatise on Meningitis , of which at least one copy marked "
67231	67305	67357	67358	Mr. Lydgate	278	" was bound in calf . For my part I have some fellow - feeling with Dr. Sprague : one 's self - satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very unpleasant to find deprecated . Lydgate 's remark , however , did not meet the sense of the company . Mr. Vincy said , that if he could have his way , he would not put disagreeable fellows anywhere . "
67310	67315	67357	67358	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Mr. Chichely . "
67382	67383	67374	67374	your	2091	" "
67389	67394	67384	67384	I	0	" interposed Dr. Sprague , "
67460	67467	67455	67455	Wakley	376	" the Doctor added , judicially . "
67483	67484	67477	67477	Wakley	376	" "
67489	67494	67477	67477	Wakley	376	" said Mr. Chichely , "
67537	67538	67515	67515	I	0	" "
67543	67547	67515	67515	I	0	" said Lydgate , "
67647	67648	67630	67630	You	2109	" "
67682	67691	67678	67680	the medical witness	2111	" said Mr. Chichely , with some scorn . "
67703	67707	67678	67680	the medical witness	2111	" said Lydgate . "
67759	67784	67787	67787	you	2109	" Lydgate had really lost sight of the fact that Mr. Chichely was his Majesty 's coroner , and ended innocently with the question , "
67795	67796	67787	67787	you	2109	" "
67813	67818	67787	67787	you	2109	" said the Doctor . "
67864	67865	67858	67858	Vincy	282	" "
67881	67888	67872	67879	a coroner who is a good coursing man	2124	" said Mr. Vincy , jovially . "
67939	68283	67936	67937	the ladies	1704	" Lydgate 's private opinion was that Mr. Chichely might be the very coroner without bias as to the coats of the stomach , but he had not meant to be personal . This was one of the difficulties of moving in good Middlemarch society : it was dangerous to insist on knowledge as a qualification for any salaried office . Fred Vincy had called Lydgate a prig , and now Mr. Chichely was inclined to call him prick - eared ; especially when , in the drawing - room , he seemed to be making himself eminently agreeable to Rosamond , whom he had easily monopolized in a tete - a - tete , since Mrs. Vincy herself sat at the tea - table . She resigned no domestic function to her daughter ; and the matron 's blooming good - natured face , with the two volatile pink strings floating from her fine throat , and her cheery manners to husband and children , was certainly among the great attractions of the Vincy house — attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with the daughter . The tinge of unpretentious , inoffensive vulgarity in Mrs. Vincy gave more effect to Rosamond 's refinement , which was beyond what Lydgate had expected . Certainly , small feet and perfectly turned shoulders aid the impression of refined manners , and the right thing said seems quite astonishingly right when it is accompanied with exquisite curves of lip and eyelid . And Rosamond could say the right thing ; for she was clever with that sort of cleverness which catches every tone except the humorous . Happily she never attempted to joke , and this perhaps was the most decisive mark of her cleverness . She and Lydgate readily got into conversation . He regretted that he had not heard her sing the other day at Stone Court . The only pleasure he allowed himself during the latter part of his stay in Paris was to go and hear music . "
68291	68295	67936	67937	the ladies	1704	" said Rosamond . "
68357	68358	68362	68362	you	2130	" "
68387	68388	68389	68389	I	0	" "
68422	68423	68426	68426	you	2130	" "
68432	68443	68429	68430	Mr. Bowyer	377	" said Rosamond , with one of her rare smiles . "
68454	68564	68565	68565	You	2136	" Lydgate was almost forgetting that he must carry on the conversation , in thinking how lovely this creature was , her garment seeming to be made out of the faintest blue sky , herself so immaculately blond , as if the petals of some gigantic flower had just opened and disclosed her ; and yet with this infantine blondness showing so much ready , self - possessed grace . Since he had had the memory of Laure , Lydgate had lost all taste for large - eyed silence : the divine cow no longer attracted him , and Rosamond was her very opposite . But he recalled himself . "
68579	68580	68565	68565	You	2136	" "
68593	68597	68581	68581	I	0	" said Rosamond . "
68657	68658	68650	68650	I	0	" "
68667	68668	68662	68662	you	2136	" "
68672	68682	68662	68662	you	2136	" ( A more naive girl would have said , "
68687	68694	68662	68662	you	2136	" But Rosamond knew better . ) "
68712	68713	68662	68662	you	2136	" "
68723	68810	68715	68715	you	2136	" said Lydgate , looking at her with an involuntary emphasis of admiration , which made Rosamond blush with pleasure . But she remained simply serious , turned her long neck a little , and put up her hand to touch her wondrous hair - plaits — an habitual gesture with her as pretty as any movements of a kitten 's paw . Not that Rosamond was in the least like a kitten : she was a sylph caught young and educated at Mrs. Lemon 's . "
68819	68824	68811	68811	I	0	" she said immediately ; "
68849	68850	68847	68847	you	2136	" "
68919	68920	68874	68874	you	2136	" "
68942	68979	68930	68930	I	0	" said Rosamond , moving to the other side of the room , where Fred having opened the piano , at his father 's desire , that Rosamond might give them some music , was parenthetically performing "
68983	69008	69009	69009	Fred	282	" with one hand . Able men who have passed their examinations will do these things sometimes , not less than the plucked Fred . "
69027	69031	69032	69032	He	278	" said Rosamond . "
69037	69062	69032	69032	He	278	" Fred laughed , and went on with his tune to the end . Rosamond turned to Lydgate , smiling gently , and said , "
69074	69075	69032	69032	He	278	" "
69081	69103	69079	69079	Rosy	298	" said Fred , springing from the stool and twisting it upward for her , with a hearty expectation of enjoyment . "
69110	69376	69079	69079	Rosy	298	" Rosamond played admirably . Her master at Mrs. Lemon 's school ( close to a county town with a memorable history that had its relics in church and castle ) was one of those excellent musicians here and there to be found in our provinces , worthy to compare with many a noted Kapellmeister in a country which offers more plentiful conditions of musical celebrity . Rosamond , with the executant 's instinct , had seized his manner of playing , and gave forth his large rendering of noble music with the precision of an echo . It was almost startling , heard for the first time . A hidden soul seemed to be flowing forth from Rosamond 's fingers ; and so indeed it was , since souls live on in perpetual echoes , and to all fine expression there goes somewhere an originating activity , if it be only that of an interpreter . Lydgate was taken possession of , and began to believe in her as something exceptional . After all , he thought , one need not be surprised to find the rare conjunctions of nature under circumstances apparently unfavourable : come where they may , they always depend on conditions that are not obvious . He sat looking at her , and did not rise to pay her any compliments , leaving that to others , now that his admiration was deepened . Her singing was less remarkable , but also well trained , and sweet to hear as a chime perfectly in tune . It is true she sang "
69382	69384	69079	69079	Rosy	298	" and "
69389	69416	69417	69420	Black - eyed Susan	379	" ; for mortals must share the fashions of their time , and none but the ancients can be always classical . But Rosamond could also sing "
69421	69431	69417	69420	Black - eyed Susan	379	" with effect , or Haydn 's canzonets , or "
69437	69439	69440	69440	Batti	381	" or "
69442	69740	69440	69440	Batti	381	batti"—she only wanted to know what her audience liked . Her father looked round at the company , delighting in their admiration . Her mother sat , like a Niobe before her troubles , with her youngest little girl on her lap , softly beating the child 's hand up and down in time to the music . And Fred , notwithstanding his general scepticism about Rosy , listened to her music with perfect allegiance , wishing he could do the same thing on his flute . It was the pleasantest family party that Lydgate had seen since he came to Middlemarch . The Vincys had the readiness to enjoy , the rejection of all anxiety , and the belief in life as a merry lot , which made a house exceptional in most county towns at that time , when Evangelicalism had cast a certain suspicion as of plague - infection over the few amusements which survived in the provinces . At the Vincys ' there was always whist , and the card - tables stood ready now , making some of the company secretly impatient of the music . Before it ceased Mr. Farebrother came in — a handsome , broad - chested but otherwise small man , about forty , whose black was very threadbare : the brilliancy was all in his quick gray eyes . He came like a pleasant change in the light , arresting little Louisa with fatherly nonsense as she was being led out of the room by Miss Morgan , greeting everybody with some special word , and seeming to condense more talk into ten minutes than had been held all through the evening . He claimed from Lydgate the fulfilment of a promise to come and see him . "
69780	69797	69770	69770	he	2153	" But soon he swerved to the whist - table , rubbing his hands and saying , "
69826	69983	69814	69814	you	2151	" Lydgate said to himself that the clergyman whose abilities were so painful to Mr. Bulstrode , appeared to have found an agreeable resort in this certainly not erudite household . He could half understand it : the good - humor , the good looks of elder and younger , and the provision for passing the time without any labour of intelligence , might make the house beguiling to people who had no particular use for their odd hours . Everything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan , who was brown , dull , and resigned , and altogether , as Mrs. Vincy often said , just the sort of person for a governess . Lydgate did not mean to pay many such visits himself . They were a wretched waste of the evenings ; and now , when he had talked a little more to Rosamond , he meant to excuse himself and go . "
69996	70008	69984	69984	You	2154	" she said , when the whist - players were settled . "
70024	70025	70015	70015	you	2154	" "
70036	70040	70026	70026	I	0	" said Lydgate . "
70107	70108	70109	70109	You	2154	" "
70125	70132	70118	70119	every one	6847	" said Rosamond , with simplicity . "
70143	70155	70135	70135	I	0	" Rosamond rose and reached her netting , and then said , "
70175	70176	70177	70177	I	0	" "
70188	70189	70177	70177	I	0	" "
70192	70202	70177	70177	I	0	" said Rosamond , with a slight deprecatory laugh . "
70232	70233	70216	70216	I	0	" "
70241	70441	70216	70216	I	0	" After this chat Lydgate thought that he was going , but on moving towards the whist - tables , he got interested in watching Mr. Farebrother 's play , which was masterly , and also his face , which was a striking mixture of the shrewd and the mild . At ten o'clock supper was brought in ( such were the customs of Middlemarch ) and there was punch - drinking ; but Mr. Farebrother had only a glass of water . He was winning , but there seemed to be no reason why the renewal of rubbers should end , and Lydgate at last took his leave . But as it was not eleven o'clock , he chose to walk in the brisk air towards the tower of St. Botolph 's , Mr. Farebrother 's church , which stood out dark , square , and massive against the starlight . It was the oldest church in Middlemarch ; the living , however , was but a vicarage worth barely four hundred a - year . Lydgate had heard that , and he wondered now whether Mr. Farebrother cared about the money he won at cards ; thinking , "
70457	70477	70453	70453	his	274	" Many things would be easier to Lydgate if it should turn out that Mr. Bulstrode was generally justifiable . "
70507	71334	70496	70496	One	870	" These were actually Lydgate 's first meditations as he walked away from Mr. Vincy 's , and on this ground I fear that many ladies will consider him hardly worthy of their attention . He thought of Rosamond and her music only in the second place ; and though , when her turn came , he dwelt on the image of her for the rest of his walk , he felt no agitation , and had no sense that any new current had set into his life . He could not marry yet ; he wished not to marry for several years ; and therefore he was not ready to entertain the notion of being in love with a girl whom he happened to admire . He did admire Rosamond exceedingly ; but that madness which had once beset him about Laure was not , he thought , likely to recur in relation to any other woman . Certainly , if falling in love had been at all in question , it would have been quite safe with a creature like this Miss Vincy , who had just the kind of intelligence one would desire in a woman — polished , refined , docile , lending itself to finish in all the delicacies of life , and enshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of demonstration that excluded the need for other evidence . Lydgate felt sure that if ever he married , his wife would have that feminine radiance , that distinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers and music , that sort of beauty which by its very nature was virtuous , being moulded only for pure and delicate joys . But since he did not mean to marry for the next five years — his more pressing business was to look into Louis ' new book on Fever , which he was specially interested in , because he had known Louis in Paris , and had followed many anatomical demonstrations in order to ascertain the specific differences of typhus and typhoid . He went home and read far into the smallest hour , bringing a much more testing vision of details and relations into this pathological study than he had ever thought it necessary to apply to the complexities of love and marriage , these being subjects on which he felt himself amply informed by literature , and that traditional wisdom which is handed down in the genial conversation of men . Whereas Fever had obscure conditions , and gave him that delightful labour of the imagination which is not mere arbitrariness , but the exercise of disciplined power — combining and constructing with the clearest eye for probabilities and the fullest obedience to knowledge ; and then , in yet more energetic alliance with impartial Nature , standing aloof to invent tests by which to try its own work . Many men have been praised as vividly imaginative on the strength of their profuseness in indifferent drawing or cheap narration:—reports of very poor talk going on in distant orbs ; or portraits of Lucifer coming down on his bad errands as a large ugly man with bat 's wings and spurts of phosphorescence ; or exaggerations of wantonness that seem to reflect life in a diseased dream . But these kinds of inspiration Lydgate regarded as rather vulgar and vinous compared with the imagination that reveals subtle actions inaccessible by any sort of lens , but tracked in that outer darkness through long pathways of necessary sequence by the inward light which is the last refinement of Energy , capable of bathing even the ethereal atoms in its ideally illuminated space . He for his part had tossed away all cheap inventions where ignorance finds itself able and at ease : he was enamoured of that arduous invention which is the very eye of research , provisionally framing its object and correcting it to more and more exactness of relation ; he wanted to pierce the obscurity of those minute processes which prepare human misery and joy , those invisible thoroughfares which are the first lurking - places of anguish , mania , and crime , that delicate poise and transition which determine the growth of happy or unhappy consciousness . As he threw down his book , stretched his legs towards the embers in the grate , and clasped his hands at the back of his head , in that agreeable afterglow of excitement when thought lapses from examination of a specific object into a suffusive sense of its connections with all the rest of our existence — seems , as it were , to throw itself on its back after vigorous swimming and float with the repose of unexhausted strength — Lydgate felt a triumphant delight in his studies , and something like pity for those less lucky men who were not of his profession . "
71348	71352	71336	71336	I	0	" he thought , "
71450	72264	72265	72266	Lalla Rookh	389	" This last thought brought back the Vincys and all the pictures of the evening . They floated in his mind agreeably enough , and as he took up his bed - candle his lips were curled with that incipient smile which is apt to accompany agreeable recollections . He was an ardent fellow , but at present his ardor was absorbed in love of his work and in the ambition of making his life recognized as a factor in the better life of mankind — like other heroes of science who had nothing but an obscure country practice to begin with . Poor Lydgate ! or shall I say , Poor Rosamond ! Each lived in a world of which the other knew nothing . It had not occurred to Lydgate that he had been a subject of eager meditation to Rosamond , who had neither any reason for throwing her marriage into distant perspective , nor any pathological studies to divert her mind from that ruminating habit , that inward repetition of looks , words , and phrases , which makes a large part in the lives of most girls . He had not meant to look at her or speak to her with more than the inevitable amount of admiration and compliment which a man must give to a beautiful girl ; indeed , it seemed to him that his enjoyment of her music had remained almost silent , for he feared falling into the rudeness of telling her his great surprise at her possession of such accomplishment . But Rosamond had registered every look and word , and estimated them as the opening incidents of a preconceived romance — incidents which gather value from the foreseen development and climax . In Rosamond 's romance it was not necessary to imagine much about the inward life of the hero , or of his serious business in the world : of course , he had a profession and was clever , as well as sufficiently handsome ; but the piquant fact about Lydgate was his good birth , which distinguished him from all Middlemarch admirers , and presented marriage as a prospect of rising in rank and getting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which she would have nothing to do with vulgar people , and perhaps at last associate with relatives quite equal to the county people who looked down on the Middlemarchers . It was part of Rosamond 's cleverness to discern very subtly the faintest aroma of rank , and once when she had seen the Miss Brookes accompanying their uncle at the county assizes , and seated among the aristocracy , she had envied them , notwithstanding their plain dress . If you think it incredible that to imagine Lydgate as a man of family could cause thrills of satisfaction which had anything to do with the sense that she was in love with him , I will ask you to use your power of comparison a little more effectively , and consider whether red cloth and epaulets have never had an influence of that sort . Our passions do not live apart in locked chambers , but , dressed in their small wardrobe of notions , bring their provisions to a common table and mess together , feeding out of the common store according to their appetite . Rosamond , in fact , was entirely occupied not exactly with Tertius Lydgate as he was in himself , but with his relation to her ; and it was excusable in a girl who was accustomed to hear that all young men might , could , would be , or actually were in love with her , to believe at once that Lydgate could be no exception . His looks and words meant more to her than other men 's , because she cared more for them : she thought of them diligently , and diligently attended to that perfection of appearance , behavior , sentiments , and all other elegancies , which would find in Lydgate a more adequate admirer than she had yet been conscious of . For Rosamond , though she would never do anything that was disagreeable to her , was industrious ; and now more than ever she was active in sketching her landscapes and market - carts and portraits of friends , in practising her music , and in being from morning till night her own standard of a perfect lady , having always an audience in her own consciousness , with sometimes the not unwelcome addition of a more variable external audience in the numerous visitors of the house . She found time also to read the best novels , and even the second best , and she knew much poetry by heart . Her favourite poem was "
72268	72269	72265	72266	Lalla Rookh	389	" "
72287	73176	72277	72277	He	2175	" was the sentiment of the elderly gentlemen who visited the Vincys ; and the rejected young men thought of trying again , as is the fashion in country towns where the horizon is not thick with coming rivals . But Mrs. Plymdale thought that Rosamond had been educated to a ridiculous pitch , for what was the use of accomplishments which would be all laid aside as soon as she was married ? While her aunt Bulstrode , who had a sisterly faithfulness towards her brother 's family , had two sincere wishes for Rosamond — that she might show a more serious turn of mind , and that she might meet with a husband whose wealth corresponded to her habits . The Rev. Camden Farebrother , whom Lydgate went to see the next evening , lived in an old parsonage , built of stone , venerable enough to match the church which it looked out upon . All the furniture too in the house was old , but with another grade of age — that of Mr. Farebrother 's father and grandfather . There were painted white chairs , with gilding and wreaths on them , and some lingering red silk damask with slits in it . There were engraved portraits of Lord Chancellors and other celebrated lawyers of the last century ; and there were old pier - glasses to reflect them , as well as the little satin - wood tables and the sofas resembling a prolongation of uneasy chairs , all standing in relief against the dark wainscot . This was the physiognomy of the drawing - room into which Lydgate was shown ; and there were three ladies to receive him , who were also old - fashioned , and of a faded but genuine respectability : Mrs. Farebrother , the Vicar 's white - haired mother , befrilled and kerchiefed with dainty cleanliness , upright , quick - eyed , and still under seventy ; Miss Noble , her sister , a tiny old lady of meeker aspect , with frills and kerchief decidedly more worn and mended ; and Miss Winifred Farebrother , the Vicar 's elder sister , well - looking like himself , but nipped and subdued as single women are apt to be who spend their lives in uninterrupted subjection to their elders . Lydgate had not expected to see so quaint a group : knowing simply that Mr. Farebrother was a bachelor , he had thought of being ushered into a snuggery where the chief furniture would probably be books and collections of natural objects . The Vicar himself seemed to wear rather a changed aspect , as most men do when acquaintances made elsewhere see them for the first time in their own homes ; some indeed showing like an actor of genial parts disadvantageously cast for the curmudgeon in a new piece . This was not the case with Mr. Farebrother : he seemed a trifle milder and more silent , the chief talker being his mother , while he only put in a good - humored moderating remark here and there . The old lady was evidently accustomed to tell her company what they ought to think , and to regard no subject as quite safe without her steering . She was afforded leisure for this function by having all her little wants attended to by Miss Winifred . Meanwhile tiny Miss Noble carried on her arm a small basket , into which she diverted a bit of sugar , which she had first dropped in her saucer as if by mistake ; looking round furtively afterwards , and reverting to her teacup with a small innocent noise as of a tiny timid quadruped . Pray think no ill of Miss Noble . That basket held small savings from her more portable food , destined for the children of her poor friends among whom she trotted on fine mornings ; fostering and petting all needy creatures being so spontaneous a delight to her , that she regarded it much as if it had been a pleasant vice that she was addicted to . Perhaps she was conscious of being tempted to steal from those who had much that she might give to those who had nothing , and carried in her conscience the guilt of that repressed desire . One must be poor to know the luxury of giving ! Mrs. Farebrother welcomed the guest with a lively formality and precision . She presently informed him that they were not often in want of medical aid in that house . She had brought up her children to wear flannel and not to over - eat themselves , which last habit she considered the chief reason why people needed doctors . Lydgate pleaded for those whose fathers and mothers had over - eaten themselves , but Mrs. Farebrother held that view of things dangerous : Nature was more just than that ; it would be easy for any felon to say that his ancestors ought to have been hanged instead of him . If those who had bad fathers and mothers were bad themselves , they were hanged for that . There was no need to go back on what you could n't see . "
73186	73191	73192	73192	she	7333	" said the Vicar , "
73197	73198	73192	73192	she	7333	" "
73292	73293	73285	73285	you	2180	" "
73312	73316	73285	73285	you	2180	" said Lydgate . "
73324	73331	73318	73319	my mother	7333	" said the Vicar , slyly . "
73387	73388	73378	73378	you	390	" "
73407	73418	73389	73390	A man	846	" said Lydgate , amused with the decisive old lady . "
73509	73510	73516	73516	mother	7322	" "
73518	73523	73516	73516	mother	7322	" said Mr. Farebrother . "
73703	73704	73705	73706	A mother	2205	" "
73711	73718	73721	73721	you	278	" said Mr. Farebrother , smiling . "
73730	73731	73723	73723	Tyke	336	" "
73740	73758	73759	73759	She	2206	" said Mrs. Farebrother , her sharpness blunted for the moment by her confidence in maternal judgments . "
73770	73771	73759	73759	She	2206	" "
73778	73782	73783	73783	I	0	" said Lydgate . "

73798	73803	73804	73804	He	336	" said Mr. Farebrother . "
73830	73831	73834	73834	Camden	390	" "
73836	73841	73834	73834	Camden	390	" said Miss Winifred , "
73871	73901	73902	73902	You	390	" Mrs. Farebrother laid down her knitting , which she had resumed after her small allowance of tea and toast , and looked at her son as if to say "
73906	73911	73902	73902	You	390	" Miss Noble said , "
73919	73940	73902	73902	You	390	" in reference , probably , to the double loss of preaching and coal . But the Vicar answered quietly — "
73966	73967	73951	73951	I	0	" "
73971	73983	73951	73951	I	0	" said Mrs. Farebrother , who could not let this pass , "
74016	74017	74002	74006	the God who made him	2213	" "
74036	74043	74034	74034	mother	7322	" said the Vicar , laughing . "
74052	74060	74034	74034	mother	7322	" he added , turning to Lydgate ; "
74065	74212	74213	74213	My	0	" All three ladies remonstrated . Mr. Lydgate ought not to be hurried away without being allowed to accept another cup of tea : Miss Winifred had abundance of good tea in the pot . Why was Camden in such haste to take a visitor to his den ? There was nothing but pickled vermin , and drawers full of blue - bottles and moths , with no carpet on the floor . Mr. Lydgate must excuse it . A game at cribbage would be far better . In short , it was plain that a vicar might be adored by his womankind as the king of men and preachers , and yet be held by them to stand in much need of their direction . Lydgate , with the usual shallowness of a young bachelor , wondered that Mr. Farebrother had not taught them better . "
74231	74276	74213	74214	My mother	7333	" said the Vicar , as he opened the door of his study , which was indeed as bare of luxuries for the body as the ladies had implied , unless a short porcelain pipe and a tobacco - box were to be excepted . "
74286	74297	74277	74280	Men of your profession	2219	" he said . Lydgate smiled and shook his head . "
74337	74338	74339	74339	I	0	" "
74378	74379	74375	74375	my	0	" "
74423	74433	74434	74434	I	0	" continued the Vicar , opening several small drawers , "
74513	74514	74504	74504	You	7333	" "
74574	74575	74580	74582	a happy fellow	7776	" "
74584	74600	74578	74578	you	7333	" said Mr. Farebrother , turning on his heel and beginning to fill his pipe . "
74713	74861	74705	74705	You	7333	" Lydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at its implied meaning — that the Vicar felt himself not altogether in the right vocation . The neat fitting - up of drawers and shelves , and the bookcase filled with expensive illustrated books on Natural History , made him think again of the winnings at cards and their destination . But he was beginning to wish that the very best construction of everything that Mr. Farebrother did should be the true one . The Vicar 's frankness seemed not of the repulsive sort that comes from an uneasy consciousness seeking to forestall the judgment of others , but simply the relief of a desire to do with as little pretence as possible . Apparently he was not without a sense that his freedom of speech might seem premature , for he presently said — "
74961	74977	74951	74951	you	7333	" Lydgate divined some delicacy of feeling here , but did not half understand it . "
74982	74986	74951	74951	you	7333	" he said , "
75029	75030	75026	75026	he	398	" "

75062	75072	75073	75073	He	398	" said Lydgate , with a short scornful laugh . "
75151	75152	75153	75153	Your	2240	" "
75221	75233	75234	75234	you	2240	But"—Mr . Farebrother broke off a moment , and then added , "
75260	75261	75262	75262	I	0	" "
75300	75301	75291	75291	you	2240	" "
75338	75369	75322	75322	you	2240	" The Vicar , while he talked in this way , alternately moved about with his pipe in his mouth , and returned to hang rather fondly over his drawers . "
75413	75414	75409	75409	your	2240	" "
75440	75470	75419	75419	men	6762	" said Lydgate , moving to Mr. Farebrother 's side , and looking rather absently at the insects ranged in fine gradation , with names subscribed in exquisite writing . "
75496	75497	75483	75483	people	6815	" "
75568	75594	75598	75598	you	2251	" Lydgate had after all to give some scrutiny to each drawer , the Vicar laughing at himself , and yet persisting in the exhibition . "
75604	75614	75598	75598	you	2251	" Lydgate began , after they had sat down , "
75721	75722	75696	75696	they	6815	" "
75772	75773	75774	75774	You	2261	" "
75780	75795	75774	75774	You	2261	" said Lydgate , conceiving that these might press rather tightly on Mr. Farebrother . "
75871	75872	75862	75862	I	0	" "
75889	75890	75878	75880	a Miss Garth	313	" "
75898	75899	75878	75880	a Miss Garth	313	" "

75926	75927	75913	75913	She	2271	" "
75933	75941	75913	75913	She	2271	" said Lydgate ; he could hardly say "
75945	75946	75949	75949	she	2271	" "
75966	76013	75959	75959	she	2271	" Mr. Farebrother puffed a few moments in silence , Lydgate not caring to know more about the Garths . At last the Vicar laid down his pipe , stretched out his legs , and turned his bright eyes with a smile towards Lydgate , saying — "
76060	76061	76055	76055	you	0	" "
76068	76074	76075	76075	I	0	" said Lydgate , emphatically . "
76099	76100	76092	76092	you	0	" "
76112	76119	76106	76106	I	0	" said Lydgate , rather proudly ; "
76200	76201	76181	76181	I	0	" "
76225	76233	76216	76216	You	0	" said Mr. Farebrother , quite unaffectedly . "
76320	76326	76327	76327	I	0	" he added , smilingly , "
76384	76436	76457	76457	he	274	" Lydgate was not at all sure that the Vicar maligned himself . A model clergyman , like a model doctor , ought to think his own profession the finest in the world , and take all knowledge as mere nourishment to his moral pathology and therapeutics . He only said , "
76446	76447	76440	76440	Bulstrode	274	" "
76570	77228	76563	76563	me	0	" Some weeks passed after this conversation before the question of the chaplaincy gathered any practical import for Lydgate , and without telling himself the reason , he deferred the predetermination on which side he should give his vote . It would really have been a matter of total indifference to him — that is to say , he would have taken the more convenient side , and given his vote for the appointment of Tyke without any hesitation — if he had not cared personally for Mr. Farebrother . But his liking for the Vicar of St. Botolph 's grew with growing acquaintanceship . That , entering into Lydgate 's position as a new - comer who had his own professional objects to secure , Mr. Farebrother should have taken pains rather to warn off than to obtain his interest , showed an unusual delicacy and generosity , which Lydgate 's nature was keenly alive to . It went along with other points of conduct in Mr. Farebrother which were exceptionally fine , and made his character resemble those southern landscapes which seem divided between natural grandeur and social slovenliness . Very few men could have been as filial and chivalrous as he was to the mother , aunt , and sister , whose dependence on him had in many ways shaped his life rather uneasily for himself ; few men who feel the pressure of small needs are so nobly resolute not to dress up their inevitably self - interested desires in a pretext of better motives . In these matters he was conscious that his life would bear the closest scrutiny ; and perhaps the consciousness encouraged a little defiance towards the critical strictness of persons whose celestial intimacies seemed not to improve their domestic manners , and whose lofty aims were not needed to account for their actions . Then , his preaching was ingenious and pithy , like the preaching of the English Church in its robust age , and his sermons were delivered without book . People outside his parish went to hear him ; and , since to fill the church was always the most difficult part of a clergyman 's function , here was another ground for a careless sense of superiority . Besides , he was a likable man : sweet - tempered , ready - witted , frank , without grins of suppressed bitterness or other conversational flavours which make half of us an affliction to our friends . Lydgate liked him heartily , and wished for his friendship . With this feeling uppermost , he continued to waive the question of the chaplaincy , and to persuade himself that it was not only no proper business of his , but likely enough never to vex him with a demand for his vote . Lydgate , at Mr. Bulstrode 's request , was laying down plans for the internal arrangements of the new hospital , and the two were often in consultation . The banker was always presupposing that he could count in general on Lydgate as a coadjutor , but made no special recurrence to the coming decision between Tyke and Farebrother . When the General Board of the Infirmary had met , however , and Lydgate had notice that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of the directors and medical men , to meet on the following Friday , he had a vexed sense that he must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch business . He could not help hearing within him the distinct declaration that Bulstrode was prime minister , and that the Tyke affair was a question of office or no office ; and he could not help an equally pronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office . For his observation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother 's assurance that the banker would not overlook opposition . "
77234	78760	76563	76563	me	0	" was one of his thoughts for three mornings in the meditative process of shaving , when he had begun to feel that he must really hold a court of conscience on this matter . Certainly there were valid things to be said against the election of Mr. Farebrother : he had too much on his hands already , especially considering how much time he spent on non - clerical occupations . Then again it was a continually repeated shock , disturbing Lydgate 's esteem , that the Vicar should obviously play for the sake of money , liking the play indeed , but evidently liking some end which it served . Mr. Farebrother contended on theory for the desirability of all games , and said that Englishmen 's wit was stagnant for want of them ; but Lydgate felt certain that he would have played very much less but for the money . There was a billiard - room at the Green Dragon , which some anxious mothers and wives regarded as the chief temptation in Middlemarch . The Vicar was a first - rate billiard - player , and though he did not frequent the Green Dragon , there were reports that he had sometimes been there in the daytime and had won money . And as to the chaplaincy , he did not pretend that he cared for it , except for the sake of the forty pounds . Lydgate was no Puritan , but he did not care for play , and winning money at it had always seemed a meanness to him ; besides , he had an ideal of life which made this subservience of conduct to the gaining of small sums thoroughly hateful to him . Hitherto in his own life his wants had been supplied without any trouble to himself , and his first impulse was always to be liberal with half - crowns as matters of no importance to a gentleman ; it had never occurred to him to devise a plan for getting half - crowns . He had always known in a general way that he was not rich , but he had never felt poor , and he had no power of imagining the part which the want of money plays in determining the actions of men . Money had never been a motive to him . Hence he was not ready to frame excuses for this deliberate pursuit of small gains . It was altogether repulsive to him , and he never entered into any calculation of the ratio between the Vicar 's income and his more or less necessary expenditure . It was possible that he would not have made such a calculation in his own case . And now , when the question of voting had come , this repulsive fact told more strongly against Mr. Farebrother than it had done before . One would know much better what to do if men 's characters were more consistent , and especially if one 's friends were invariably fit for any function they desired to undertake ! Lydgate was convinced that if there had been no valid objection to Mr. Farebrother , he would have voted for him , whatever Bulstrode might have felt on the subject : he did not intend to be a vassal of Bulstrode 's . On the other hand , there was Tyke , a man entirely given to his clerical office , who was simply curate at a chapel of ease in St. Peter 's parish , and had time for extra duty . Nobody had anything to say against Mr. Tyke , except that they could not bear him , and suspected him of ca nt . Really , from his point of view , Bulstrode was thoroughly justified . But whichever way Lydgate began to incline , there was something to make him wince ; and being a proud man , he was a little exasperated at being obliged to wince . He did not like frustrating his own best purposes by getting on bad terms with Bulstrode ; he did not like voting against Farebrother , and helping to deprive him of function and salary ; and the question occurred whether the additional forty pounds might not leave the Vicar free from that ignoble care about winning at cards . Moreover , Lydgate did not like the consciousness that in voting for Tyke he should be voting on the side obviously convenient for himself . But would the end really be his own convenience ? Other people would say so , and would allege that he was currying favour with Bulstrode for the sake of making himself important and getting on in the world . What then ? He for his own part knew that if his personal prospects simply had been concerned , he would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker 's friendship or enmity . What he really cared for was a medium for his work , a vehicle for his ideas ; and after all , was he not bound to prefer the object of getting a good hospital , where he could demonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test therapeutic results , before anything else connected with this chaplaincy ? For the first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of small social conditions , and their frustrating complexity . At the end of his inward debate , when he set out for the hospital , his hope was really in the chance that discussion might somehow give a new aspect to the question , and make the scale dip so as to exclude the necessity for voting . I think he trusted a little also to the energy which is begotten by circumstances — some feeling rushing warmly and making resolve easy , while debate in cool blood had only made it more difficult . However it was , he did not distinctly say to himself on which side he would vote ; and all the while he was inwardly resenting the subjection which had been forced upon him . It would have seemed beforehand like a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he , with his unmixed resolutions of independence and his select purposes , would find himself at the very outset in the grasp of petty alternatives , each of which was repugnant to him . In his student 's chambers , he had prearranged his social action quite differently . Lydgate was late in setting out , but Dr. Sprague , the two other surgeons , and several of the directors had arrived early ; Mr. Bulstrode , treasurer and chairman , being among those who were still absent . The conversation seemed to imply that the issue was problematical , and that a majority for Tyke was not so certain as had been generally supposed . The two physicians , for a wonder , turned out to be unanimous , or rather , though of different minds , they concurred in action . Dr. Sprague , the rugged and weighty , was , as every one had foreseen , an adherent of Mr. Farebrother . The Doctor was more than suspected of having no religion , but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this deficiency in him as if he had been a Lord Chancellor ; indeed it is probable that his professional weight was the more believed in , the world - old association of cleverness with the evil principle being still potent in the minds even of lady - patients who had the strictest ideas of frilling and sentiment . It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor which made his neighbors call him hard - headed and dry - witted ; conditions of texture which were also held favourable to the storing of judgments connected with drugs . At all events , it is certain that if any medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having very definite religious views , of being given to prayer , and of otherwise showing an active piety , there would have been a general presumption against his medical skill . On this ground it was ( professionally speaking ) fortunate for Dr. Minchin that his religious sympathies were of a general kind , and such as gave a distant medical sanction to all serious sentiment , whether of Church or Dissent , rather than any adhesion to particular tenets . If Mr. Bulstrode insisted , as he was apt to do , on the Lutheran doctrine of justification , as that by which a Church must stand or fall , Dr. Minchin in return was quite sure that man was not a mere machine or a fortuitous conjunction of atoms ; if Mrs. Wimple insisted on a particular providence in relation to her stomach complaint , Dr. Minchin for his part liked to keep the mental windows open and objected to fixed limits ; if the Unitarian brewer jested about the Athanasian Creed , Dr. Minchin quoted Pope 's "
78765	78813	76563	76563	me	0	" He objected to the rather free style of anecdote in which Dr. Sprague indulged , preferring well - sanctioned quotations , and liking refinement of all kinds : it was generally known that he had some kinship to a bishop , and sometimes spent his holidays at "
78817	79366	79367	79367	I	0	" Dr. Minchin was soft - handed , pale - complexioned , and of rounded outline , not to be distinguished from a mild clergyman in appearance : whereas Dr. Sprague was superfluously tall ; his trousers got creased at the knees , and showed an excess of boot at a time when straps seemed necessary to any dignity of bearing ; you heard him go in and out , and up and down , as if he had come to see after the roofing . In short , he had weight , and might be expected to grapple with a disease and throw it ; while Dr. Minchin might be better able to detect it lurking and to circumvent it . They enjoyed about equally the mysterious privilege of medical reputation , and concealed with much etiquette their contempt for each other 's skill . Regarding themselves as Middlemarch institutions , they were ready to combine against all innovators , and against non - professionals given to interference . On this ground they were both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode , though Dr. Minchin had never been in open hostility with him , and never differed from him without elabourate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode , who had found that Dr. Minchin alone understood her constitution . A layman who pried into the professional conduct of medical men , and was always obtruding his reforms,—though he was less directly embarrassing to the two physicians than to the surgeon - apothecaries who attended paupers by contract , was nevertheless offensive to the professional nostril as such ; and Dr. Minchin shared fully in the new pique against Bulstrode , excited by his apparent determination to patronize Lydgate . The long - established practitioners , Mr. Wrench and Mr. Toller ; were just now standing apart and having a friendly colloquy , in which they agreed that Lydgate was a jackanapes , just made to serve Bulstrode 's purpose . To non - medical friends they had already concurred in praising the other young practitioner , who had come into the town on Mr. Peacock 's retirement without further recommendation than his own merits and such argument for solid professional acquirement as might be gathered from his having apparently wasted no time on other branches of knowledge . It was clear that Lydgate , by not dispensing drugs , intended to cast imputations on his equals , and also to obscure the limit between his own rank as a general practitioner and that of the physicians , who , in the interest of the profession , felt bound to maintain its various grades,—especially against a man who had not been to either of the English universities and enjoyed the absence of anatomical and bedside study there , but came with a libellous pretension to experience in Edinburgh and Paris , where observation might be abundant indeed , but hardly sound . Thus it happened that on this occasion Bulstrode became identified with Lydgate , and Lydgate with Tyke ; and owing to this variety of interchangeable names for the chaplaincy question , diverse minds were enabled to form the same judgment concerning it . Dr. Sprague said at once bluntly to the group assembled when he entered , "

80351	80648	80278	80278	he	336	" he added , turning quickly round to the four medical men who were assembled . But any answer was dispensed with by the entrance of three gentlemen , with whom there were greetings more or less cordial . These were the Reverend Edward Thesiger , Rector of St. Peter 's , Mr. Bulstrode , and our friend Mr. Brooke of Tipton , who had lately allowed himself to be put on the board of directors in his turn , but had never before attended , his attendance now being due to Mr. Bulstrode 's exertions . Lydgate was the only person still expected . Every one now sat down , Mr. Bulstrode presiding , pale and self - restrained as usual . Mr. Thesiger , a moderate evangelical , wished for the appointment of his friend Mr. Tyke , a zealous able man , who , officiating at a chapel of ease , had not a cure of souls too extensive to leave him ample time for the new duty . It was desirable that chaplaincies of this kind should be entered on with a fervent intention : they were peculiar opportunities for spiritual influence ; and while it was good that a salary should be allotted , there was the more need for scrupulous watching lest the office should be perverted into a mere question of salary . Mr. Thesiger 's manner had so much quiet propriety that objectors could only simmer in silence . Mr. Brooke believed that everybody meant well in the matter . He had not himself attended to the affairs of the Infirmary , though he had a strong interest in whatever was for the benefit of Middlemarch , and was most happy to meet the gentlemen present on any public question—"any
80655	80667	80278	80278	he	336	" Mr. Brooke repeated , with his nod of perfect understanding . "
80785	80786	80782	80782	you	2335	" "
80806	80827	80803	80804	Mr. Brooke	175	" said Mr. Frank Hawley , who was afraid of nobody , and was a Tory suspicious of electioneering intentions . "
80864	80865	80856	80857	Mr. Tyke	336	" "
80872	80877	80869	80870	Mr. Hawley	405	" said Mr. Bulstrode . "
80892	80893	80878	80879	Mr. Brooke	175	" "
80898	80904	80878	80879	Mr. Brooke	175	" flashed out Mr. Hawley . "
80915	80920	80905	80905	I	0	" said Mr. Thesiger . "
80929	80934	80935	80935	Gentlemen	1716	" retorted Mr. Hawley . "
80937	80947	80878	80879	Mr. Brooke	175	" said Mr. Bulstrode , in a subdued tone , "
80994	80995	80996	80996	I	0	" "
81005	81010	80996	80996	I	0	" said Mr. Hawley . "
81066	81078	81079	81079	Tyke	336	" A brief but still hot discussion followed before each person wrote "
81080	81082	81083	81083	Farebrother	335	" or "
81084	81109	81110	81110	I	0	" on a piece of paper and slipped it into a glass tumbler ; and in the mean time Mr. Bulstrode saw Lydgate enter . "
81121	81139	81110	81110	I	0	" said Mr. Bulstrode , in a clear biting voice . Then , looking up at Lydgate — "
81166	81167	81159	81159	you	278	" "
81174	81181	81159	81159	you	278	" said Mr. Wrench , rising . "
81191	81192	81186	81187	Mr. Lydgate	278	" "
81204	81217	81193	81193	You	278	" said Lydgate , rather defiantly , and keeping his pencil suspended . "
81239	81240	81232	81232	you	278	" "
81261	81266	81267	81267	Tyke	336	" Lydgate immediately wrote down "
81269	81545	81267	81267	Tyke	336	" So the Rev. Walter Tyke became chaplain to the Infirmary , and Lydgate continued to work with Mr. Bulstrode . He was really uncertain whether Tyke were not the more suitable candidate , and yet his consciousness told him that if he had been quite free from indirect bias he should have voted for Mr. Farebrother . The affair of the chaplaincy remained a sore point in his memory as a case in which this petty medium of Middlemarch had been too strong for him . How could a man be satisfied with a decision between such alternatives and under such circumstances ? No more than he can be satisfied with his hat , which he has chosen from among such shapes as the resources of the age offer him , wearing it at best with a resignation which is chiefly supported by comparison . But Mr. Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as before . The character of the publican and sinner is not always practically incompatible with that of the modern Pharisee , for the majority of us scarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our own conduct than the faultiness of our own arguments , or the dulness of our own jokes . But the Vicar of St. Botolph 's had certainly escaped the slightest tincture of the Pharisee , and by dint of admitting to himself that he was too much as other men were , he had become remarkably unlike them in this — that he could excuse others for thinking slightly of him , and could judge impartially of their conduct even when it told against him . "
81558	81566	81555	81555	I	0	" he said one day to Lydgate . "
81649	81987	81631	81631	I	0	" The Vicar 's talk was not always inspiriting : he had escaped being a Pharisee , but he had not escaped that low estimate of possibilities which we rather hastily arrive at as an inference from our own failure . Lydgate thought that there was a pitiable infirmity of will in Mr. Farebrother . When George the Fourth was still reigning over the privacies of Windsor , when the Duke of Wellington was Prime Minister , and Mr. Vincy was mayor of the old corporation in Middlemarch , Mrs. Casaubon , born Dorothea Brooke , had taken her wedding journey to Rome . In those days the world in general was more ignorant of good and evil by forty years than it is at present . Travellers did not often carry full information on Christian art either in their heads or their pockets ; and even the most brilliant English critic of the day mistook the flower - flushed tomb of the ascended Virgin for an ornamental vase due to the painter 's fancy . Romanticism , which has helped to fill some dull blanks with love and knowledge , had not yet penetrated the times with its leaven and entered into everybody 's food ; it was fermenting still as a distinguishable vigorous enthusiasm in certain long - haired German artists at Rome , and the youth of other nations who worked or idled near them were sometimes caught in the spreading movement . One fine morning a young man whose hair was not immoderately long , but abundant and curly , and who was otherwise English in his equipment , had just turned his back on the Belvedere Torso in the Vatican and was looking out on the magnificent view of the mountains from the adjoining round vestibule . He was sufficiently absorbed not to notice the approach of a dark - eyed , animated German who came up to him and placing a hand on his shoulder , said with a strong accent , "
82001	82224	81994	81994	she	2360	" Quickness was ready at the call , and the two figures passed lightly along by the Meleager , towards the hall where the reclining Ariadne , then called the Cleopatra , lies in the marble voluptuousness of her beauty , the drapery folding around her with a petal - like ease and tenderness . They were just in time to see another figure standing against a pedestal near the reclining marble : a breathing blooming girl , whose form , not shamed by the Ariadne , was clad in Quakerish gray drapery ; her long cloak , fastened at the neck , was thrown backward from her arms , and one beautiful ungloved hand pillowed her cheek , pushing somewhat backward the white beaver bonnet which made a sort of halo to her face around the simply braided dark - brown hair . She was not looking at the sculpture , probably not thinking of it : her large eyes were fixed dreamily on a streak of sunlight which fell across the floor . But she became conscious of the two strangers who suddenly paused as if to contemplate the Cleopatra , and , without looking at them , immediately turned away to join a maid - servant and courier who were loitering along the hall at a little distance off . "
82238	82264	82227	82227	you	2361	" said the German , searching in his friend 's face for responding admiration , but going on volubly without waiting for any other answer . "
82428	82429	82459	82459	her	2363	" "
82434	82444	82459	82459	her	2363	" said his companion , with a little frown . "
82461	82462	82457	82457	you	261	" "
82473	82500	82503	82504	the Geistlicher	414	" said Will Ladislaw , sauntering down the hall with a preoccupied air , while his German friend kept at his side and watched him eagerly . "
82520	82521	82506	82506	He	7187	" "
82537	82545	82531	82531	he	7187	" said Ladislaw , with some irritation . "

82829	82863	82822	82823	Adolf Naumann	416	" said the good - natured painter , putting a hand on Ladislaw 's shoulder , and not in the least disturbed by the unaccountable touch of ill - humor in his tone . "

83154	83181	83143	83143	I	0	" The amiable artist carried his sting , but Ladislaw did not choose to appear stung . He went on as if he had not heard . "
83291	83292	83278	83278	her	6894	" "
83341	83342	83343	83343	You	261	" "
83360	83361	83352	83352	you	261	" "
83370	83371	83372	83373	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" "
83375	83376	83372	83373	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" "
83401	83402	83393	83393	she	2404	" "
83407	84389	83393	83393	she	2404	" said Will Ladislaw , in a contemptuous undertone , intended to dismiss the subject . He was conscious of being irritated by ridiculously small causes , which were half of his own creation . Why was he making any fuss about Mrs. Casaubon ? And yet he felt as if something had happened to him with regard to her . There are characters which are continually creating collisions and nodes for themselves in dramas which nobody is prepared to act with them . Their susceptibilities will clash against objects that remain innocently quiet . Two hours later , Dorothea was seated in an inner room or boudoir of a handsome apartment in the Via Sistina . I am sorry to add that she was sobbing bitterly , with such abandonment to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually controlled by pride on her own account and thoughtfulness for others will sometimes allow herself when she feels securely alone . And Mr. Casaubon was certain to remain away for some time at the Vatican . Yet Dorothea had no distinctly shapen grievance that she could state even to herself ; and in the midst of her confused thought and passion , the mental act that was struggling forth into clearness was a self - accusing cry that her feeling of desolation was the fault of her own spiritual poverty . She had married the man of her choice , and with the advantage over most girls that she had contemplated her marriage chiefly as the beginning of new duties : from the very first she had thought of Mr. Casaubon as having a mind so much above her own , that he must often be claimed by studies which she could not entirely share ; moreover , after the brief narrow experience of her girlhood she was beholding Rome , the city of visible history , where the past of a whole hemisphere seems moving in funeral procession with strange ancestral images and trophies gathered from afar . But this stupendous fragmentariness heightened the dreamlike strangeness of her bridal life . Dorothea had now been five weeks in Rome , and in the kindly mornings when autumn and winter seemed to go hand in hand like a happy aged couple one of whom would presently survive in chiller loneliness , she had driven about at first with Mr. Casaubon , but of late chiefly with Tantripp and their experienced courier . She had been led through the best galleries , had been taken to the chief points of view , had been shown the grandest ruins and the most glorious churches , and she had ended by oftenest choosing to drive out to the Campagna where she could feel alone with the earth and sky , away - from the oppressive masquerade of ages , in which her own life too seemed to become a masque with enigmatical costumes . To those who have looked at Rome with the quickening power of a knowledge which breathes a growing soul into all historic shapes , and traces out the suppressed transitions which unite all contrasts , Rome may still be the spiritual centre and interpreter of the world . But let them conceive one more historical contrast : the gigantic broken revelations of that Imperial and Papal city thrust abruptly on the notions of a girl who had been brought up in English and Swiss Puritanism , fed on meagre Protestant histories and on art chiefly of the hand - screen sort ; a girl whose ardent nature turned all her small allowance of knowledge into principles , fusing her actions into their mould , and whose quick emotions gave the most abstract things the quality of a pleasure or a pain ; a girl who had lately become a wife , and from the enthusiastic acceptance of untried duty found herself plunged in tumultuous preoccupation with her personal lot . The weight of unintelligible Rome might lie easily on bright nymphs to whom it formed a background for the brilliant picnic of Anglo - foreign society ; but Dorothea had no such defence against deep impressions . Ruins and basilicas , palaces and colossi , set in the midst of a sordid present , where all that was living and warm - blooded seemed sunk in the deep degeneracy of a superstition divorced from reverence ; the dimmer but yet eager Titanic life gazing and struggling on walls and ceilings ; the long vistas of white forms whose marble eyes seemed to hold the monotonous light of an alien world : all this vast wreck of ambitious ideals , sensuous and spiritual , mixed confusedly with the signs of breathing forgetfulness and degradation , at first jarred her as with an electric shock , and then urged themselves on her with that ache belonging to a glut of confused ideas which check the flow of emotion . Forms both pale and glowing took possession of her young sense , and fixed themselves in her memory even when she was not thinking of them , preparing strange associations which remained through her after - years . Our moods are apt to bring with them images which succeed each other like the magic - lantern pictures of a doze ; and in certain states of dull forlornness Dorothea all her life continued to see the vastness of St. Peter 's , the huge bronze canopy , the excited intention in the attitudes and garments of the prophets and evangelists in the mosaics above , and the red drapery which was being hung for Christmas spreading itself everywhere like a disease of the retina . Not that this inward amazement of Dorothea 's was anything very exceptional : many souls in their young nudity are tumbled out among incongruities and left to "
84393	85663	84391	84391	their	2406	" among them , while their elders go about their business . Nor can I suppose that when Mrs. Casaubon is discovered in a fit of weeping six weeks after her wedding , the situation will be regarded as tragic . Some discouragement , some faintness of heart at the new real future which replaces the imaginary , is not unusual , and we do not expect people to be deeply moved by what is not unusual . That element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of frequency , has not yet wrought itself into the coarse emotion of mankind ; and perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it . If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life , it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel 's heart beat , and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence . As it is , the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity . However , Dorothea was crying , and if she had been required to state the cause , she could only have done so in some such general words as I have already used : to have been driven to be more particular would have been like trying to give a history of the lights and shadows , for that new real future which was replacing the imaginary drew its material from the endless minutiae by which her view of Mr. Casaubon and her wifely relation , now that she was married to him , was gradually changing with the secret motion of a watch - hand from what it had been in her maiden dream . It was too early yet for her fully to recognize or at least admit the change , still more for her to have readjusted that devotedness which was so necessary a part of her mental life that she was almost sure sooner or later to recover it . Permanent rebellion , the disorder of a life without some loving reverent resolve , was not possible to her ; but she was now in an interval when the very force of her nature heightened its confusion . In this way , the early months of marriage often are times of critical tumult — whether that of a shrimp - pool or of deeper waters — which afterwards subsides into cheerful peace . But was not Mr. Casaubon just as learned as before ? Had his forms of expression changed , or his sentiments become less laudable ? Oh waywardness of womanhood ! did his chronology fail him , or his ability to state not only a theory but the names of those who held it ; or his provision for giving the heads of any subject on demand ? And was not Rome the place in all the world to give free play to such accomplishments ? Besides , had not Dorothea 's enthusiasm especially dwelt on the prospect of relieving the weight and perhaps the sadness with which great tasks lie on him who has to achieve them ? — And that such weight pressed on Mr. Casaubon was only plainer than before . All these are crushing questions ; but whatever else remained the same , the light had changed , and you can not find the pearly dawn at noonday . The fact is unalterable , that a fellow - mortal with whose nature you are acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few imaginative weeks called courtship , may , when seen in the continuity of married companionship , be disclosed as something better or worse than what you have preconceived , but will certainly not appear altogether the same . And it would be astonishing to find how soon the change is felt if we had no kindred changes to compare with it . To share lodgings with a brilliant dinner - companion , or to see your favourite politician in the Ministry , may bring about changes quite as rapid : in these cases too we begin by knowing little and believing much , and we sometimes end by inverting the quantities . Still , such comparisons might mislead , for no man was more incapable of flashy make - believe than Mr. Casaubon : he was as genuine a character as any ruminant animal , and he had not actively assisted in creating any illusions about himself . How was it that in the weeks since her marriage , Dorothea had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling depression , that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she had dreamed of finding in her husband 's mind were replaced by anterooms and winding passages which seemed to lead nowhither ? I suppose it was that in courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary , and the smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal . But the door - sill of marriage once crossed , expectation is concentrated on the present . Having once embarked on your marital voyage , it is impossible not to be aware that you make no way and that the sea is not within sight — that , in fact , you are exploring an enclosed basin . In their conversation before marriage , Mr. Casaubon had often dwelt on some explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea did not see the bearing ; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to the brokenness of their intercourse , and , supported by her faith in their future , she had listened with fervid patience to a recitation of possible arguments to be brought against Mr. Casaubon 's entirely new view of the Philistine god Dagon and other fish - deities , thinking that hereafter she should see this subject which touched him so nearly from the same high ground whence doubtless it had become so important to him . Again , the matter - of - course statement and tone of dismissal with which he treated what to her were the most stirring thoughts , was easily accounted for as belonging to the sense of haste and preoccupation in which she herself shared during their engagement . But now , since they had been in Rome , with all the depths of her emotion roused to tumultuous activity , and with life made a new problem by new elements , she had been becoming more and more aware , with a certain terror , that her mind was continually sliding into inward fits of anger and repulsion , or else into forlorn weariness . How far the judicious Hooker or any other hero of erudition would have been the same at Mr. Casaubon 's time of life , she had no means of knowing , so that he could not have the advantage of comparison ; but her husband 's way of commenting on the strangely impressive objects around them had begun to affect her with a sort of mental shiver : he had perhaps the best intention of acquitting himself worthily , but only of acquitting himself . What was fresh to her mind was worn out to his ; and such capacity of thought and feeling as had ever been stimulated in him by the general life of mankind had long shrunk to a sort of dried preparation , a lifeless embalmment of knowledge . When he said , "
85686	85701	85703	85703	you	2407	it,"—it seemed to her as if going or staying were alike dreary . Or , "
85733	85734	85721	85721	Raphael	418	" "
85742	85749	85737	85737	you	0	" was always Dorothea 's question . "
85875	86568	86569	86569	My	0	" This kind of answer given in a measured official tone , as of a clergyman reading according to the rubric , did not help to justify the glories of the Eternal City , or to give her the hope that if she knew more about them the world would be joyously illuminated for her . There is hardly any contact more depressing to a young ardent creature than that of a mind in which years full of knowledge seem to have issued in a blank absence of interest or sympathy . On other subjects indeed Mr. Casaubon showed a tenacity of occupation and an eagerness which are usually regarded as the effect of enthusiasm , and Dorothea was anxious to follow this spontaneous direction of his thoughts , instead of being made to feel that she dragged him away from it . But she was gradually ceasing to expect with her former delightful confidence that she should see any wide opening where she followed him . Poor Mr. Casaubon himself was lost among small closets and winding stairs , and in an agitated dimness about the Cabeiri , or in an exposure of other mythologists ' ill - considered parallels , easily lost sight of any purpose which had prompted him to these labours . With his taper stuck before him he forgot the absence of windows , and in bitter manuscript remarks on other men 's notions about the solar deities , he had become indifferent to the sunlight . These characteristics , fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr. Casaubon , might have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she had been encouraged to pour forth her girlish and womanly feeling — if he would have held her hands between his and listened with the delight of tenderness and understanding to all the little histories which made up her experience , and would have given her the same sort of intimacy in return , so that the past life of each could be included in their mutual knowledge and affection — or if she could have fed her affection with those childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman , who has begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll , creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own love . That was Dorothea 's bent . With all her yearning to know what was afar from her and to be widely benignant , she had ardor enough for what was near , to have kissed Mr. Casaubon 's coat - sleeve , or to have caressed his shoe - latchet , if he would have made any other sign of acceptance than pronouncing her , with his unfailing propriety , to be of a most affectionate and truly feminine nature , indicating at the same time by politely reaching a chair for her that he regarded these manifestations as rather crude and startling . Having made his clerical toilet with due care in the morning , he was prepared only for those amenities of life which were suited to the well - adjusted stiff cravat of the period , and to a mind weighted with unpublished matter . And by a sad contradiction Dorothea 's ideas and resolves seemed like melting ice floating and lost in the warm flood of which they had been but another form . She was humiliated to find herself a mere victim of feeling , as if she could know nothing except through that medium : all her strength was scattered in fits of agitation , of struggle , of despondency , and then again in visions of more complete renunciation , transforming all hard conditions into duty . Poor Dorothea ! she was certainly troublesome — to herself chiefly ; but this morning for the first time she had been troublesome to Mr. Casaubon . She had begun , while they were taking coffee , with a determination to shake off what she inwardly called her selfishness , and turned a face all cheerful attention to her husband when he said , "
86747	86815	86725	86725	I	0	" Mr. Casaubon pronounced this little speech with the most conscientious intention , blinking a little and swaying his head up and down , and concluding with a smile . He had not found marriage a rapturous state , but he had no idea of being anything else than an irreproachable husband , who would make a charming young woman as happy as she deserved to be . "
86840	86857	86826	86826	I	0	" said Dorothea , trying to keep her mind fixed on what most affected her husband . "
86860	86879	86826	86826	I	0	" said Mr. Casaubon , with that peculiar pitch of voice which makes the word half a negative . "
86960	86961	86962	86962	I	0	" "
86976	87025	87026	87026	I	0	" said Dorothea , who had a vivid memory of evenings in which she had supposed that Mr. Casaubon 's mind had gone too deep during the day to be able to get to the surface again . I fear there was a little temper in her reply . "
87055	87056	87059	87060	my dear	6867	" "
87062	87072	87059	87060	my dear	6867	" said Mr. Casaubon , with a slight bow . "
87097	87098	87101	87101	your	189	" "
87104	87131	87101	87101	your	189	" said Dorothea , whose heart had already burned within her on this subject , so that now she could not help speaking with her tongue . "
87206	87601	87602	87602	My	0	" Dorothea , in a most unaccountable , darkly feminine manner , ended with a slight sob and eyes full of tears . The excessive feeling manifested would alone have been highly disturbing to Mr. Casaubon , but there were other reasons why Dorothea 's words were among the most cutting and irritating to him that she could have been impelled to use . She was as blind to his inward troubles as he to hers : she had not yet learned those hidden conflicts in her husband which claim our pity . She had not yet listened patiently to his heartbeats , but only felt that her own was beating violently . In Mr. Casaubon 's ear , Dorothea 's voice gave loud emphatic iteration to those muffled suggestions of consciousness which it was possible to explain as mere fancy , the illusion of exaggerated sensitiveness : always when such suggestions are unmistakably repeated from without , they are resisted as cruel and unjust . We are angered even by the full acceptance of our humiliating confessions — how much more by hearing in hard distinct syllables from the lips of a near observer , those confused murmurs which we try to call morbid , and strive against as if they were the oncoming of numbness ! And this cruel outward accuser was there in the shape of a wife — nay , of a young bride , who , instead of observing his abundant pen - scratches and amplitude of paper with the uncritical awe of an elegant - minded canary - bird , seemed to present herself as a spy watching everything with a malign power of inference . Here , towards this particular point of the compass , Mr. Casaubon had a sensitiveness to match Dorothea 's , and an equal quickness to imagine more than the fact . He had formerly observed with approbation her capacity for worshipping the right object ; he now foresaw with sudden terror that this capacity might be replaced by presumption , this worship by the most exasperating of all criticism,—that which sees vaguely a great many fine ends , and has not the least notion what it costs to reach them . For the first time since Dorothea had known him , Mr. Casaubon 's face had a quick angry flush upon it . "
87605	87616	87602	87602	My	0	" he said , with irritation reined in by propriety , "
87745	87846	87847	87847	My	0	" This speech was delivered with an energy and readiness quite unusual with Mr. Casaubon . It was not indeed entirely an improvisation , but had taken shape in inward colloquy , and rushed out like the round grains from a fruit when sudden heat cracks it . Dorothea was not only his wife : she was a personification of that shallow world which surrounds the appreciated or desponding author . Dorothea was indignant in her turn . Had she not been repressing everything in herself except the desire to enter into some fellowship with her husband 's chief interests ? "
87863	87877	87878	87878	You	0	" she answered , with a prompt resentment , that needed no rehearsal . "
87944	88639	88704	88704	him	2434	" Dorothea rose to leave the table and Mr. Casaubon made no reply , taking up a letter which lay beside him as if to reperuse it . Both were shocked at their mutual situation — that each should have betrayed anger towards the other . If they had been at home , settled at Lowick in ordinary life among their neighbors , the clash would have been less embarrassing : but on a wedding journey , the express object of which is to isolate two people on the ground that they are all the world to each other , the sense of disagreement is , to say the least , confounding and stultifying . To have changed your longitude extensively and placed yourselves in a moral solitude in order to have small explosions , to find conversation difficult and to hand a glass of water without looking , can hardly be regarded as satisfactory fulfilment even to the toughest minds . To Dorothea 's inexperienced sensitiveness , it seemed like a catastrophe , changing all prospects ; and to Mr. Casaubon it was a new pain , he never having been on a wedding journey before , or found himself in that close union which was more of a subjection than he had been able to imagine , since this charming young bride not only obliged him to much consideration on her behalf ( which he had sedulously given ) , but turned out to be capable of agitating him cruelly just where he most needed soothing . Instead of getting a soft fence against the cold , shadowy , unapplausive audience of his life , had he only given it a more substantial presence ? Neither of them felt it possible to speak again at present . To have reversed a previous arrangement and declined to go out would have been a show of persistent anger which Dorothea 's conscience shrank from , seeing that she already began to feel herself guilty . However just her indignation might be , her ideal was not to claim justice , but to give tenderness . So when the carriage came to the door , she drove with Mr. Casaubon to the Vatican , walked with him through the stony avenue of inscriptions , and when she parted with him at the entrance to the Library , went on through the Museum out of mere listlessness as to what was around her . She had not spirit to turn round and say that she would drive anywhere . It was when Mr. Casaubon was quitting her that Naumann had first seen her , and he had entered the long gallery of sculpture at the same time with her ; but here Naumann had to await Ladislaw with whom he was to settle a bet of champagne about an enigmatical mediaeval - looking figure there . After they had examined the figure , and had walked on finishing their dispute , they had parted , Ladislaw lingering behind while Naumann had gone into the Hall of Statues where he again saw Dorothea , and saw her in that brooding abstraction which made her pose remarkable . She did not really see the streak of sunlight on the floor more than she saw the statues : she was inwardly seeing the light of years to come in her own home and over the English fields and elms and hedge - bordered highroads ; and feeling that the way in which they might be filled with joyful devotedness was not so clear to her as it had been . But in Dorothea 's mind there was a current into which all thought and feeling were apt sooner or later to flow — the reaching forward of the whole consciousness towards the fullest truth , the least partial good . There was clearly something better than anger and despondency . It was in that way Dorothea came to be sobbing as soon as she was securely alone . But she was presently roused by a knock at the door , which made her hastily dry her eyes before saying , "
88643	88692	88704	88704	him	2434	" Tantripp had brought a card , and said that there was a gentleman waiting in the lobby . The courier had told him that only Mrs. Casaubon was at home , but he said he was a relation of Mr. Casaubon 's : would she see him ? "
88695	88702	88704	88704	him	2434	" said Dorothea , without pause ; "
88709	88941	88704	88704	him	2434	" Her chief impressions about young Ladislaw were that when she had seen him at Lowick she had been made aware of Mr. Casaubon 's generosity towards him , and also that she had been interested in his own hesitation about his career . She was alive to anything that gave her an opportunity for active sympathy , and at this moment it seemed as if the visit had come to shake her out of her self - absorbed discontent — to remind her of her husband 's goodness , and make her feel that she had now the right to be his helpmate in all kind deeds . She waited a minute or two , but when she passed into the next room there were just signs enough that she had been crying to make her open face look more youthful and appealing than usual . She met Ladislaw with that exquisite smile of good - will which is unmixed with vanity , and held out her hand to him . He was the elder by several years , but at that moment he looked much the younger , for his transparent complexion flushed suddenly , and he spoke with a shyness extremely unlike the ready indifference of his manner with his male companion , while Dorothea became all the calmer with a wondering desire to put him at ease . "
88968	88972	88960	88960	I	0	" he said . "
89016	89017	89000	89000	I	0	" "
89042	89089	89029	89029	he	189	" said Dorothea , seating herself unthinkingly between the fire and the light of the tall window , and pointing to a chair opposite , with the quietude of a benignant matron . The signs of girlish sorrow in her face were only the more striking . "
89112	89113	89106	89106	he	189	" "
89119	89146	89114	89114	You	2436	" said Ladislaw , beginning to lose his diffidence in the interest with which he was observing the signs of weeping which had altered her face . "
89180	89181	89182	89182	He	189	" "
89245	89522	89236	89236	he	189	" Will Ladislaw was struck mute for a few moments . He had never been fond of Mr. Casaubon , and if it had not been for the sense of obligation , would have laughed at him as a Bat of erudition . But the idea of this dried - up pedant , this elabourator of small explanations about as important as the surplus stock of false antiquities kept in a vendor 's back chamber , having first got this adorable young creature to marry him , and then passing his honeymoon away from her , groping after his mouldy futilities ( Will was given to hyperbole)—this sudden picture stirred him with a sort of comic disgust : he was divided between the impulse to laugh aloud and the equally unseasonable impulse to burst into scornful invective . For an instant he felt that the struggle was causing a queer contortion of his mobile features , but with a good effort he resolved it into nothing more offensive than a merry smile . Dorothea wondered ; but the smile was irresistible , and shone back from her face too . Will Ladislaw 's smile was delightful , unless you were angry with him beforehand : it was a gush of inward light illuminating the transparent skin as well as the eyes , and playing about every curve and line as if some Ariel were touching them with a new charm , and banishing forever the traces of moodiness . The reflection of that smile could not but have a little merriment in it too , even under dark eyelashes still moist , as Dorothea said inquiringly , "
89527	89528	89236	89236	he	189	" "
89531	89540	89236	89236	he	189	" said Will , quick in finding resources . "
89568	89569	89570	89570	My	0	" "
89573	89581	89570	89570	My	0	" said Dorothea , wondering still more . "
89593	89594	89595	89595	I	0	" "
89651	89661	89647	89647	you	2442	" Will could laugh now as well as smile . "
89668	89679	89680	89680	I	0	" said Dorothea , admiring Will 's good - humor . "
89879	89880	89841	89841	one	870	" "
89898	89917	89841	89841	one	870	" said Will . ( It was impossible now to doubt the directness of Dorothea 's confession . ) "
90000	90001	90002	90002	You	0	" "
90010	90021	90022	90022	You	0	" said Dorothea , with a new direction of interest . "
90043	90044	90030	90031	Mr. Casaubon	189	" "
90050	90058	90030	90031	Mr. Casaubon	189	" said Will , with some coldness . "
90131	90132	90134	90134	I	0	" "
90138	90144	90134	90134	I	0	" said Dorothea , cordially . "
90217	90234	90235	90236	A man	846	" There was no mistaking this simplicity , and Will was won by it into frankness . "
90308	90309	90310	90310	I	0	" "
90324	90345	90317	90317	he	189	" said Dorothea , gently . She was rather shocked at this mode of taking all life as a holiday . "
90360	90389	90357	90357	I	0	" The slight streak of contempt in this hasty reply offended Dorothea . She was all the more susceptible about Mr. Casaubon because of her morning 's trouble . "
90394	90401	90391	90391	you	189	" she said , rather proudly . "
90424	90504	90417	90418	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Will saw that she was offended , but this only gave an additional impulse to the new irritation of his latent dislike towards Mr. Casaubon . It was too intolerable that Dorothea should be worshipping this husband : such weakness in a woman is pleasant to no man but the husband in question . Mortals are easily tempted to pinch the life out of their neighbor 's buzzing glory , and think that such killing is no murder . "
90509	90515	90417	90418	Mr. Casaubon	189	" he answered , promptly . "
90566	90567	90568	90568	I	0	" "
90574	90582	90572	90572	you	2460	" said Dorothea , startled and anxious . "
90587	90596	90572	90572	you	2460	" said Will , in an offhand way , "
90671	90841	90666	90666	I	0	" Will only thought of giving a good pinch that would annihilate that vaunted labouriousness , and was unable to imagine the mode in which Dorothea would be wounded . Young Mr. Ladislaw was not at all deep himself in German writers ; but very little achievement is required in order to pity another man 's shortcomings . Poor Dorothea felt a pang at the thought that the labour of her husband 's life might be void , which left her no energy to spare for the question whether this young relative who was so much obliged to him ought not to have repressed his observation . She did not even speak , but sat looking at her hands , absorbed in the piteousness of that thought . Will , however , having given that annihilating pinch , was rather ashamed , imagining from Dorothea 's silence that he had offended her still more ; and having also a conscience about plucking the tail - feathers from a benefactor . "
90847	90861	90842	90842	I	0	" he resumed , taking the usual course from detraction to insincere eulogy , "
90889	90909	90927	90928	German teachers	2465	" Dorothea raised her eyes , brighter than usual with excited feeling , and said in her saddest recitative , "
90939	91600	91612	91612	I	0	" There was a new light , but still a mysterious light , for Will in Dorothea 's last words . The question how she had come to accept Mr. Casaubon — which he had dismissed when he first saw her by saying that she must be disagreeable in spite of appearances — was not now to be answered on any such short and easy method . Whatever else she might be , she was not disagreeable . She was not coldly clever and indirectly satirical , but adorably simple and full of feeling . She was an angel beguiled . It would be a unique delight to wait and watch for the melodious fragments in which her heart and soul came forth so directly and ingenuously . The Aeolian harp again came into his mind . She must have made some original romance for herself in this marriage . And if Mr. Casaubon had been a dragon who had carried her off to his lair with his talons simply and without legal forms , it would have been an unavoidable feat of heroism to release her and fall at her feet . But he was something more unmanageable than a dragon : he was a benefactor with collective society at his back , and he was at that moment entering the room in all the unimpeachable correctness of his demeanor , while Dorothea was looking animated with a newly roused alarm and regret , and Will was looking animated with his admiring speculation about her feelings . Mr. Casaubon felt a surprise which was quite unmixed with pleasure , but he did not swerve from his usual politeness of greeting , when Will rose and explained his presence . Mr. Casaubon was less happy than usual , and this perhaps made him look all the dimmer and more faded ; else , the effect might easily have been produced by the contrast of his young cousin 's appearance . The first impression on seeing Will was one of sunny brightness , which added to the uncertainty of his changing expression . Surely , his very features changed their form , his jaw looked sometimes large and sometimes small ; and the little ripple in his nose was a preparation for metamorphosis . When he turned his head quickly his hair seemed to shake out light , and some persons thought they saw decided genius in this coruscation . Mr. Casaubon , on the contrary , stood rayless . As Dorothea 's eyes were turned anxiously on her husband she was perhaps not insensible to the contrast , but it was only mingled with other causes in making her more conscious of that new alarm on his behalf which was the first stirring of a pitying tenderness fed by the realities of his lot and not by her own dreams . Yet it was a source of greater freedom to her that Will was there ; his young equality was agreeable , and also perhaps his openness to conviction . She felt an immense need of some one to speak to , and she had never before seen any one who seemed so quick and pliable , so likely to understand everything . Mr. Casaubon gravely hoped that Will was passing his time profitably as well as pleasantly in Rome — had thought his intention was to remain in South Germany — but begged him to come and dine to - morrow , when he could converse more at large : at present he was somewhat weary . Ladislaw understood , and accepting the invitation immediately took his leave . Dorothea 's eyes followed her husband anxiously , while he sank down wearily at the end of a sofa , and resting his elbow supported his head and looked on the floor . A little flushed , and with bright eyes , she seated herself beside him , and said — "
91628	91629	91616	91616	I	0	" "
91641	91672	91634	91634	you	0	" said Mr. Casaubon . He spoke quietly and bowed his head a little , but there was still an uneasy feeling in his eyes as he looked at her . "
91679	91723	91674	91674	you	0	" said Dorothea , with a quick sob . In her need for some manifestation of feeling she was ready to exaggerate her own fault . Would not love see returning penitence afar off , and fall on its neck and kiss it ? "
91752	91790	91791	91791	You	6867	" said Mr. Casaubon , exerting himself to make a strong statement , and also to smile faintly . Dorothea was silent , but a tear which had come up with the sob would insist on falling . "
91812	91945	91799	91799	I	0	" said Mr. Casaubon . In fact , he had it in his thought to tell her that she ought not to have received young Ladislaw in his absence : but he abstained , partly from the sense that it would be ungracious to bring a new complaint in the moment of her penitent acknowledgment , partly because he wanted to avoid further agitation of himself by speech , and partly because he was too proud to betray that jealousy of disposition which was not so exhausted on his scholarly compeers that there was none to spare in other directions . There is a sort of jealousy which needs very little fire : it is hardly a passion , but a blight bred in the cloudy , damp despondency of uneasy egoism . "
91956	92851	91946	91946	I	0	" he added , looking at his watch . They both rose , and there was never any further allusion between them to what had passed on this day . But Dorothea remembered it to the last with the vividness with which we all remember epochs in our experience when some dear expectation dies , or some new motive is born . Today she had begun to see that she had been under a wild illusion in expecting a response to her feeling from Mr. Casaubon , and she had felt the waking of a presentiment that there might be a sad consciousness in his life which made as great a need on his side as on her own . We are all of us born in moral stupidity , taking the world as an udder to feed our supreme selves : Dorothea had early begun to emerge from that stupidity , but yet it had been easier to her to imagine how she would devote herself to Mr. Casaubon , and become wise and strong in his strength and wisdom , than to conceive with that distinctness which is no longer reflection but feeling — an idea wrought back to the directness of sense , like the solidity of objects — that he had an equivalent centre of self , whence the lights and shadows must always fall with a certain difference . Will Ladislaw was delightfully agreeable at dinner the next day , and gave no opportunity for Mr. Casaubon to show disapprobation . On the contrary it seemed to Dorothea that Will had a happier way of drawing her husband into conversation and of deferentially listening to him than she had ever observed in any one before . To be sure , the listeners about Tipton were not highly gifted ! Will talked a good deal himself , but what he said was thrown in with such rapidity , and with such an unimportant air of saying something by the way , that it seemed a gay little chime after the great bell . If Will was not always perfect , this was certainly one of his good days . He described touches of incident among the poor people in Rome , only to be seen by one who could move about freely ; he found himself in agreement with Mr. Casaubon as to the unsound opinions of Middleton concerning the relations of Judaism and Catholicism ; and passed easily to a half - enthusiastic half - playful picture of the enjoyment he got out of the very miscellaneousness of Rome , which made the mind flexible with constant comparison , and saved you from seeing the world 's ages as a set of box - like partitions without vital connection . Mr. Casaubon 's studies , Will observed , had always been of too broad a kind for that , and he had perhaps never felt any such sudden effect , but for himself he confessed that Rome had given him quite a new sense of history as a whole : the fragments stimulated his imagination and made him constructive . Then occasionally , but not too often , he appealed to Dorothea , and discussed what she said , as if her sentiment were an item to be considered in the final judgment even of the Madonna di Foligno or the Laocoon . A sense of contributing to form the world 's opinion makes conversation particularly cheerful ; and Mr. Casaubon too was not without his pride in his young wife , who spoke better than most women , as indeed he had perceived in choosing her . Since things were going on so pleasantly , Mr. Casaubon 's statement that his labours in the Library would be suspended for a couple of days , and that after a brief renewal he should have no further reason for staying in Rome , encouraged Will to urge that Mrs. Casaubon should not go away without seeing a studio or two . Would not Mr. Casaubon take her ? That sort of thing ought not to be missed : it was quite special : it was a form of life that grew like a small fresh vegetation with its population of insects on huge fossils . Will would be happy to conduct them — not to anything wearisome , only to a few examples . Mr. Casaubon , seeing Dorothea look earnestly towards him , could not but ask her if she would be interested in such visits : he was now at her service during the whole day ; and it was agreed that Will should come on the morrow and drive with them . Will could not omit Thorwaldsen , a living celebrity about whom even Mr. Casaubon inquired , but before the day was far advanced he led the way to the studio of his friend Adolf Naumann , whom he mentioned as one of the chief renovators of Christian art , one of those who had not only revived but expanded that grand conception of supreme events as mysteries at which the successive ages were spectators , and in relation to which the great souls of all periods became as it were contemporaries . Will added that he had made himself Naumann 's pupil for the nonce . "
92863	92867	92852	92852	I	0	" said Will . "
92978	93003	93035	93035	you	0	" Will here looked at Mr. Casaubon , who received this offhand treatment of symbolism very uneasily , and bowed with a neutral air . "
93017	93021	93022	93022	I	0	" said Dorothea . "
93044	93045	93035	93035	you	0	" "
93049	93055	93035	93035	you	0	" said Will , laughing , "
93078	93079	93035	93035	you	0	" "
93087	93096	93035	93035	you	0	" said Dorothea , smiling towards her husband . "
93110	93332	93035	93035	you	0	" Mr. Casaubon blinked furtively at Will . He had a suspicion that he was being laughed at . But it was not possible to include Dorothea in the suspicion . They found Naumann painting industriously , but no model was present ; his pictures were advantageously arranged , and his own plain vivacious person set off by a dove - coloured blouse and a maroon velvet cap , so that everything was as fortunate as if he had expected the beautiful young English lady exactly at that time . The painter in his confident English gave little dissertations on his finished and unfinished subjects , seeming to observe Mr. Casaubon as much as he did Dorothea . Will burst in here and there with ardent words of praise , marking out particular merits in his friend 's work ; and Dorothea felt that she was getting quite new notions as to the significance of Madonnas seated under inexplicable canopied thrones with the simple country as a background , and of saints with architectural models in their hands , or knives accidentally wedged in their skulls . Some things which had seemed monstrous to her were gathering intelligibility and even a natural meaning : but all this was apparently a branch of knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not interested himself . "
93369	93377	93353	93353	I	0	" said Dorothea , speaking to Will . "
93387	93391	93392	93392	He	416	" said Will . "
93409	93410	93404	93404	his	416	" "
93415	93434	93437	93437	he	416	" said Dorothea , turning her sincere eyes on Naumann , who made a slight grimace and said — "
93460	93548	93549	93550	My friend	6960	" Naumann 's pronunciation of the vowel seemed to stretch the word satirically . Will did not half like it , but managed to laugh : and Mr. Casaubon , while he felt some disgust at the artist 's German accent , began to entertain a little respect for his judicious severity . The respect was not diminished when Naumann , after drawing Will aside for a moment and looking , first at a large canvas , then at Mr. Casaubon , came forward again and said — "
93607	93608	93609	93609	You	2481	" "
93616	93630	93609	93609	You	2481	" said Mr. Casaubon , his looks improved with a glow of delight ; "
93697	93898	93688	93689	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" As for Dorothea , nothing could have pleased her more , unless it had been a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and worthiest among the sons of men . In that case her tottering faith would have become firm again . Naumann 's apparatus was at hand in wonderful completeness , and the sketch went on at once as well as the conversation . Dorothea sat down and subsided into calm silence , feeling happier than she had done for a long while before . Every one about her seemed good , and she said to herself that Rome , if she had only been less ignorant , would have been full of beauty : its sadness would have been winged with hope . No nature could be less suspicious than hers : when she was a child she believed in the gratitude of wasps and the honourable susceptibility of sparrows , and was proportionately indignant when their baseness was made manifest . The adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about English polities , which brought long answers , and , Will meanwhile had perched himself on some steps in the background overlooking all . Presently Naumann said—"Now
93929	93955	93921	93921	I	0	" Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is too strong for syntax ; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret — "
93989	93990	94048	94048	your	0	" "
93997	94001	94048	94048	your	0	" said Dorothea . "
94017	94027	94048	94048	your	0	" she added , looking entreatingly at Mr. Casaubon . "
94043	94044	94045	94045	I	0	" "
94057	94066	94051	94051	sir	6934	" said Mr. Casaubon , with polite condescension . "
94091	94092	94093	94093	You	2486	" "
94103	94160	94166	94168	the gracious lady	2490	" said Naumann , and then went on in German to Will , pointing here and there to the sketch as if he were considering that . Putting it aside for a moment , he looked round vaguely , as if seeking some occupation for his visitors , and afterwards turning to Mr. Casaubon , said — "
94210	94232	94286	94287	Santa Clara	431	" Mr. Casaubon , bowing , doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would oblige him , and Dorothea said , at once , "
94239	94282	94286	94287	Santa Clara	431	" Naumann was all apologies in asking her to stand , and allow him to adjust her attitude , to which she submitted without any of the affected airs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions , when the painter said , "
94316	94425	94289	94289	I	0	" Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint 's feet and kiss her robe , and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he was adjusting her arm . All this was impudence and desecration , and he repented that he had brought her . The artist was diligent , and Will recovering himself moved about and occupied Mr. Casaubon as ingeniously as he could ; but he did not in the end prevent the time from seeming long to that gentleman , as was clear from his expressing a fear that Mrs. Casaubon would be tired . Naumann took the hint and said — "
94445	94817	94440	94443	the lady - wife	2492	" So Mr. Casaubon 's patience held out further , and when after all it turned out that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect if another sitting could be had , it was granted for the morrow . On the morrow Santa Clara too was retouched more than once . The result of all was so far from displeasing to Mr. Casaubon , that he arranged for the purchase of the picture in which Saint Thomas Aquinas sat among the doctors of the Church in a disputation too abstract to be represented , but listened to with more or less attention by an audience above . The Santa Clara , which was spoken of in the second place , Naumann declared himself to be dissatisfied with — he could not , in conscience , engage to make a worthy picture of it ; so about the Santa Clara the arrangement was conditional . I will not dwell on Naumann 's jokes at the expense of Mr. Casaubon that evening , or on his dithyrambs about Dorothea 's charm , in all which Will joined , but with a difference . No sooner did Naumann mention any detail of Dorothea 's beauty , than Will got exasperated at his presumption : there was grossness in his choice of the most ordinary words , and what business had he to talk of her lips ? She was not a woman to be spoken of as other women were . Will could not say just what he thought , but he became irritable . And yet , when after some resistance he had consented to take the Casaubons to his friend 's studio , he had been allured by the gratification of his pride in being the person who could grant Naumann such an opportunity of studying her loveliness — or rather her divineness , for the ordinary phrases which might apply to mere bodily prettiness were not applicable to her . ( Certainly all Tipton and its neighborhood , as well as Dorothea herself , would have been surprised at her beauty being made so much of . In that part of the world Miss Brooke had been only a "
94822	94824	94833	94833	Naumann	416	" ) "
94850	94859	94845	94845	she	276	" said Will . Naumann stared at him . "
94925	94926	94927	94927	He	2495	" "
94937	94984	94927	94927	He	2495	" said Will , with gnashing impetuosity . His obligations to Mr. Casaubon were not known to his hearer , but Will himself was thinking of them , and wishing that he could discharge them all by a check . Naumann gave a shrug and said , "
95003	95351	94996	94996	They	2498	" All Will 's hope and contrivance were now concentrated on seeing Dorothea when she was alone . He only wanted her to take more emphatic notice of him ; he only wanted to be something more special in her remembrance than he could yet believe himself likely to be . He was rather impatient under that open ardent good - will , which he saw was her usual state of feeling . The remote worship of a woman throned out of their reach plays a great part in men 's lives , but in most cases the worshipper longs for some queenly recognition , some approving sign by which his soul 's sovereign may cheer him without descending from her high place . That was precisely what Will wanted . But there were plenty of contradictions in his imaginative demands . It was beautiful to see how Dorothea 's eyes turned with wifely anxiety and beseeching to Mr. Casaubon : she would have lost some of her halo if she had been without that duteous preoccupation ; and yet at the next moment the husband 's sandy absorption of such nectar was too intolerable ; and Will 's longing to say damaging things about him was perhaps not the less tormenting because he felt the strongest reasons for restraining it . Will had not been invited to dine the next day . Hence he persuaded himself that he was bound to call , and that the only eligible time was the middle of the day , when Mr. Casaubon would not be at home . Dorothea , who had not been made aware that her former reception of Will had displeased her husband , had no hesitation about seeing him , especially as he might be come to pay a farewell visit . When he entered she was looking at some cameos which she had been buying for Celia . She greeted Will as if his visit were quite a matter of course , and said at once , having a cameo bracelet in her hand — "
95434	95435	95426	95426	Pray	329	" "
95472	95473	95489	95489	You	2500	" "
95572	95582	95547	95547	she	7373	" Dorothea added the last words with a smile . "
95591	95612	95583	95583	You	2500	" said Will , seating himself at some distance from her , and observing her while she closed the cases . "
95628	95632	95633	95633	I	0	" said Dorothea . "
95661	95662	95663	95663	I	0	" "
95672	95678	95665	95665	I	0	" said Dorothea , simply . "
95742	95743	95744	95744	I	0	" "
95752	95758	95759	95759	You	2500	" said Will , impetuously . "
95909	95945	95947	95947	you	2500	" Will had gone further than he intended , and checked himself . But Dorothea 's thought was not taking just the same direction as his own , and she answered without any special emotion — "
96125	96126	96171	96171	I	0	" "
96149	96150	96171	96171	I	0	" "
96154	96170	96171	96171	I	0	" said Dorothea , taking up that thought into the chief current of her anxiety ; "
96218	96240	96241	96241	You	0	" Dorothea parted her lips again as if she were going to say more , but changed her mind and paused . "
96257	96274	96275	96275	You	0	" said Will , energetically , with a quick shake of the head habitual to him . "
96379	96455	96363	96363	I	0	" Will again feared that he had gone too far ; but the meaning we attach to words depends on our feeling , and his tone of angry regret had so much kindness in it for Dorothea 's heart , which had always been giving out ardor and had never been fed with much from the living beings around her , that she felt a new sense of gratitude and answered with a gentle smile — "
96496	96581	96582	96582	I	0	" The last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence , and Will did not know what to say , since it would not be useful for him to embrace her slippers , and tell her that he would die for her : it was clear that she required nothing of the sort ; and they were both silent for a moment or two , when Dorothea began again with an air of saying at last what had been in her mind beforehand . "
96627	96628	96618	96618	I	0	" "
96633	96649	96650	96650	I	0	" said Will , observing that she spoke with a timidity quite new in her . "
96672	96673	96677	96677	you	0	" "
96733	96764	96730	96730	he	189	" Dorothea 's timidity was due to an indistinct consciousness that she was in the strange situation of consulting a third person about the adequacy of Mr. Casaubon 's learning . "
96771	96783	96730	96730	he	189	" said Will , thinking that he would be duly reserved . "
96807	96808	96793	96793	He	189	" "
96852	96880	96842	96843	Mr. Casaubon	189	" said Dorothea , with more remonstrant energy . She was impelled to have the argument aloud , which she had been having in her own mind . "
96890	96901	96842	96843	Mr. Casaubon	189	" said Will , also getting a tone of rejoinder . "
96991	96992	96944	96944	you	0	" "
97002	97014	96995	96995	you	0	" said Dorothea , with a look between sorrow and anger . "
97082	97111	97112	97112	You	0	" She was beginning to be shocked that she had got to such a point of supposition , and indignant with Will for having led her to it . "
97125	97129	97112	97112	You	0	" said Will . "
97168	97169	97163	97164	a pensioner	2531	" "
97174	97181	97172	97172	me	0	" said Dorothea , colouring deeply . "
97229	97230	97231	97231	I	0	" "
97237	97245	97235	97235	you	0	" said Will , determined to change the situation—"so
97310	97311	97331	97332	Mr. Casaubon	189	" "
97321	97329	97316	97316	I	0	" said Dorothea , with returning kindness . "
97354	97355	97356	97356	She	2533	" "
97374	97386	97369	97369	she	2533	" said Will to himself . Aloud he said , rising — "
97394	97395	97369	97369	she	2533	" "
97404	97410	97400	97401	Mr. Casaubon	189	" said Dorothea , earnestly . "
97426	97427	97420	97420	I	0	" "
97435	97439	97440	97440	I	0	" said Will . "

97529	97539	97540	97540	I	0	" said Dorothea , with the most open kindness . "
97546	97582	97542	97542	you	0	" Will was not quite contented , thinking that he would apparently have been of more importance if he had been disliked . He said nothing , but looked dull , not to say sulky . "
97595	97601	97584	97584	I	0	" Dorothea went on cheerfully . "
97684	97685	97681	97682	a poet	6753	" "
97763	97764	97754	97754	One	870	" "

97850	97874	97875	97875	I	0	" said Will , showing such originality as we all share with the morning and the spring - time and other endless renewals . "
97883	97909	97875	97875	I	0	" said Dorothea , laughing out her words in a bird - like modulation , and looking at Will with playful gratitude in her eyes . "
97919	97920	97914	97914	you	0	" "
97957	97963	97948	97948	I	0	" Will spoke with fervor . "
97967	97973	97948	97948	I	0	" said Dorothea , cordially . "
98010	98069	98004	98004	your	0	" There was a certain liquid brightness in her eyes , and Will was conscious that his own were obeying a law of nature and filling too . The allusion to Mr. Casaubon would have spoiled all if anything at that moment could have spoiled the subduing power , the sweet dignity , of her noble unsuspicious inexperience . "
98082	98100	98078	98078	you	0	" said Dorothea , rising and walking a little way under the strength of a recurring impulse . "
98151	98169	98149	98149	me	0	" She had returned from her brief pacing and stood opposite Will , looking gravely at him . "
98177	98272	98172	98172	I	0	" said Will , reddening however . If he never said a cutting word about Mr. Casaubon again and left off receiving favours from him , it would clearly be permissible to hate him the more . The poet must know how to hate , says Goethe ; and Will was at least ready with that accomplishment . He said that he must go now without waiting for Mr. Casaubon , whom he would come to take leave of at the last moment . Dorothea gave him her hand , and they exchanged a simple "
98277	98327	98328	98328	I	0	" But going out of the porte cochere he met Mr. Casaubon , and that gentleman , expressing the best wishes for his cousin , politely waived the pleasure of any further leave - taking on the morrow , which would be sufficiently crowded with the preparations for departure . "
98350	98388	98341	98341	I	0	" said Dorothea to her husband in the course of the evening . She had mentioned immediately on his entering that Will had just gone away , and would come again , but Mr. Casaubon had said , "
98404	98444	98395	98395	we	2548	" saying this with the air and tone by which we imply that any subject , whether private or public , does not interest us enough to wish for a further remark upon it . So Dorothea had waited . "
98452	98460	98449	98450	my love	7315	" said Mr Casaubon ( he always said "
98463	98472	98473	98473	He	261	" when his manner was the coldest ) . "
98521	98536	98513	98513	you	0	" said Dorothea , with an appealing look into her husband 's neutral face . "
98552	98553	98538	98538	he	261	" "
98593	98594	98583	98583	you	7315	" "
98604	98609	98610	98610	I	0	" said Mr. Casaubon . "
98650	98662	98638	98638	you	7315	" said Dorothea , putting her hand on her husband 's . "
98670	98702	98663	98663	I	0	" said Mr. Casaubon , laying his other hand on Dorothea 's in conscientious acceptance of her caress , but with a glance which he could not hinder from being uneasy . "
98748	98832	98663	98663	I	0	" Dorothea did not mention Will again . Fred Vincy , we have seen , had a debt on his mind , and though no such immaterial burthen could depress that buoyant - hearted young gentleman for many hours together , there were circumstances connected with this debt which made the thought of it unusually importunate . The creditor was Mr. Bambridge , a horse - dealer of the neighborhood , whose company was much sought in Middlemarch by young men understood to be "
98837	99112	98663	98663	I	0	" During the vacations Fred had naturally required more amusements than he had ready money for , and Mr. Bambridge had been accommodating enough not only to trust him for the hire of horses and the accidental expense of ruining a fine hunter , but also to make a small advance by which he might be able to meet some losses at billiards . The total debt was a hundred and sixty pounds . Bambridge was in no alarm about his money , being sure that young Vincy had backers ; but he had required something to show for it , and Fred had at first given a bill with his own signature . Three months later he had renewed this bill with the signature of Caleb Garth . On both occasions Fred had felt confident that he should meet the bill himself , having ample funds at disposal in his own hopefulness . You will hardly demand that his confidence should have a basis in external facts ; such confidence , we know , is something less coarse and materialistic : it is a comfortable disposition leading us to expect that the wisdom of providence or the folly of our friends , the mysteries of luck or the still greater mystery of our high individual value in the universe , will bring about agreeable issues , such as are consistent with our good taste in costume , and our general preference for the best style of thing . Fred felt sure that he should have a present from his uncle , that he should have a run of luck , that by dint of "
99114	99134	98663	98663	I	0	" he should gradually metamorphose a horse worth forty pounds into a horse that would fetch a hundred at any moment—"judgment
99135	99700	98663	98663	I	0	" being always equivalent to an unspecified sum in hard cash . And in any case , even supposing negations which only a morbid distrust could imagine , Fred had always ( at that time ) his father 's pocket as a last resource , so that his assets of hopefulness had a sort of gorgeous superfluity about them . Of what might be the capacity of his father 's pocket , Fred had only a vague notion : was not trade elastic ? And would not the deficiencies of one year be made up for by the surplus of another ? The Vincys lived in an easy profuse way , not with any new ostentation , but according to the family habits and traditions , so that the children had no standard of economy , and the elder ones retained some of their infantine notion that their father might pay for anything if he would . Mr. Vincy himself had expensive Middlemarch habits — spent money on coursing , on his cellar , and on dinner - giving , while mamma had those running accounts with tradespeople , which give a cheerful sense of getting everything one wants without any question of payment . But it was in the nature of fathers , Fred knew , to bully one about expenses : there was always a little storm over his extravagance if he had to disclose a debt , and Fred disliked bad weather within doors . He was too filial to be disrespectful to his father , and he bore the thunder with the certainty that it was transient ; but in the mean time it was disagreeable to see his mother cry , and also to be obliged to look sulky instead of having fun ; for Fred was so good - tempered that if he looked glum under scolding , it was chiefly for propriety 's sake . The easier course plainly , was to renew the bill with a friend 's signature . Why not ? With the superfluous securities of hope at his command , there was no reason why he should not have increased other people 's liabilities to any extent , but for the fact that men whose names were good for anything were usually pessimists , indisposed to believe that the universal order of things would necessarily be agreeable to an agreeable young gentleman . With a favour to ask we review our list of friends , do justice to their more amiable qualities , forgive their little offenses , and concerning each in turn , try to arrive at the conclusion that he will be eager to oblige us , our own eagerness to be obliged being as communicable as other warmth . Still there is always a certain number who are dismissed as but moderately eager until the others have refused ; and it happened that Fred checked off all his friends but one , on the ground that applying to them would be disagreeable ; being implicitly convinced that he at least ( whatever might be maintained about mankind generally ) had a right to be free from anything disagreeable . That he should ever fall into a thoroughly unpleasant position — wear trousers shrunk with washing , eat cold mutton , have to walk for want of a horse , or to "
99703	100261	98663	98663	I	0	" in any sort of way — was an absurdity irreconcilable with those cheerful intuitions implanted in him by nature . And Fred winced under the idea of being looked down upon as wanting funds for small debts . Thus it came to pass that the friend whom he chose to apply to was at once the poorest and the kindest — namely , Caleb Garth . The Garths were very fond of Fred , as he was of them ; for when he and Rosamond were little ones , and the Garths were better off , the slight connection between the two families through Mr. Featherstone 's double marriage ( the first to Mr. Garth 's sister , and the second to Mrs. Vincy 's ) had led to an acquaintance which was carried on between the children rather than the parents : the children drank tea together out of their toy teacups , and spent whole days together in play . Mary was a little hoyden , and Fred at six years old thought her the nicest girl in the world , making her his wife with a brass ring which he had cut from an umbrella . Through all the stages of his education he had kept his affection for the Garths , and his habit of going to their house as a second home , though any intercourse between them and the elders of his family had long ceased . Even when Caleb Garth was prosperous , the Vincys were on condescending terms with him and his wife , for there were nice distinctions of rank in Middlemarch ; and though old manufacturers could not any more than dukes be connected with none but equals , they were conscious of an inherent social superiority which was defined with great nicety in practice , though hardly expressible theoretically . Since then Mr. Garth had failed in the building business , which he had unfortunately added to his other avocations of surveyor , valuer , and agent , had conducted that business for a time entirely for the benefit of his assignees , and had been living narrowly , exerting himself to the utmost that he might after all pay twenty shillings in the pound . He had now achieved this , and from all who did not think it a bad precedent , his honourable exertions had won him due esteem ; but in no part of the world is genteel visiting founded on esteem , in the absence of suitable furniture and complete dinner - service . Mrs. Vincy had never been at her ease with Mrs. Garth , and frequently spoke of her as a woman who had had to work for her bread — meaning that Mrs. Garth had been a teacher before her marriage ; in which case an intimacy with Lindley Murray and Mangnall 's Questions was something like a draper 's discrimination of calico trademarks , or a courier 's acquaintance with foreign countries : no woman who was better off needed that sort of thing . And since Mary had been keeping Mr. Featherstone 's house , Mrs. Vincy 's want of liking for the Garths had been converted into something more positive , by alarm lest Fred should engage himself to this plain girl , whose parents "
100269	100386	98663	98663	I	0	" Fred , being aware of this , never spoke at home of his visits to Mrs. Garth , which had of late become more frequent , the increasing ardor of his affection for Mary inclining him the more towards those who belonged to her . Mr. Garth had a small office in the town , and to this Fred went with his request . He obtained it without much difficulty , for a large amount of painful experience had not sufficed to make Caleb Garth cautious about his own affairs , or distrustful of his fellow - men when they had not proved themselves untrustworthy ; and he had the highest opinion of Fred , was "
100415	100756	98663	98663	I	0	" Such was Caleb 's psychological argument . He was one of those rare men who are rigid to themselves and indulgent to others . He had a certain shame about his neighbors ' errors , and never spoke of them willingly ; hence he was not likely to divert his mind from the best mode of hardening timber and other ingenious devices in order to preconceive those errors . If he had to blame any one , it was necessary for him to move all the papers within his reach , or describe various diagrams with his stick , or make calculations with the odd money in his pocket , before he could begin ; and he would rather do other men 's work than find fault with their doing . I fear he was a bad disciplinarian . When Fred stated the circumstances of his debt , his wish to meet it without troubling his father , and the certainty that the money would be forthcoming so as to cause no one any inconvenience , Caleb pushed his spectacles upward , listened , looked into his favourite 's clear young eyes , and believed him , not distinguishing confidence about the future from veracity about the past ; but he felt that it was an occasion for a friendly hint as to conduct , and that before giving his signature he must give a rather strong admonition . Accordingly , he took the paper and lowered his spectacles , measured the space at his command , reached his pen and examined it , dipped it in the ink and examined it again , then pushed the paper a little way from him , lifted up his spectacles again , showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of his bushy eyebrows , which gave his face a peculiar mildness ( pardon these details for once — you would have learned to love them if you had known Caleb Garth ) , and said in a comfortable tone , — "
100801	100870	100791	100791	You	2557	" Whereupon Caleb drew down his spectacles , and proceeded to write his signature with the care which he always gave to that performance ; for whatever he did in the way of business he did well . He contemplated the large well - proportioned letters and final flourish , with his head a trifle on one side for an instant , then handed it to Fred , said "
100875	101093	100791	100791	You	2557	" and returned forthwith to his absorption in a plan for Sir James Chettam 's new farm - buildings . Either because his interest in this work thrust the incident of the signature from his memory , or for some reason of which Caleb was more conscious , Mrs. Garth remained ignorant of the affair . Since it occurred , a change had come over Fred 's sky , which altered his view of the distance , and was the reason why his uncle Featherstone 's present of money was of importance enough to make his colour come and go , first with a too definite expectation , and afterwards with a proportionate disappointment . His failure in passing his examination , had made his accumulation of college debts the more unpardonable by his father , and there had been an unprecedented storm at home . Mr. Vincy had sworn that if he had anything more of that sort to put up with , Fred should turn out and get his living how he could ; and he had never yet quite recovered his good - humored tone to his son , who had especially enraged him by saying at this stage of things that he did not want to be a clergyman , and would rather not "
101099	101303	100791	100791	You	2557	" Fred was conscious that he would have been yet more severely dealt with if his family as well as himself had not secretly regarded him as Mr. Featherstone 's heir ; that old gentleman 's pride in him , and apparent fondness for him , serving in the stead of more exemplary conduct — just as when a youthful nobleman steals jewellery we call the act kleptomania , speak of it with a philosophical smile , and never think of his being sent to the house of correction as if he were a ragged boy who had stolen turnips . In fact , tacit expectations of what would be done for him by uncle Featherstone determined the angle at which most people viewed Fred Vincy in Middlemarch ; and in his own consciousness , what uncle Featherstone would do for him in an emergency , or what he would do simply as an incorporated luck , formed always an immeasurable depth of aerial perspective . But that present of bank - notes , once made , was measurable , and being applied to the amount of the debt , showed a deficit which had still to be filled up either by Fred 's "
101305	102101	100791	100791	You	2557	" or by luck in some other shape . For that little episode of the alleged borrowing , in which he had made his father the agent in getting the Bulstrode certificate , was a new reason against going to his father for money towards meeting his actual debt . Fred was keen enough to foresee that anger would confuse distinctions , and that his denial of having borrowed expressly on the strength of his uncle 's will would be taken as a falsehood . He had gone to his father and told him one vexatious affair , and he had left another untold : in such cases the complete revelation always produces the impression of a previous duplicity . Now Fred piqued himself on keeping clear of lies , and even fibs ; he often shrugged his shoulders and made a significant grimace at what he called Rosamond 's fibs ( it is only brothers who can associate such ideas with a lovely girl ) ; and rather than incur the accusation of falsehood he would even incur some trouble and self - restraint . It was under strong inward pressure of this kind that Fred had taken the wise step of depositing the eighty pounds with his mother . It was a pity that he had not at once given them to Mr. Garth ; but he meant to make the sum complete with another sixty , and with a view to this , he had kept twenty pounds in his own pocket as a sort of seed - corn , which , planted by judgment , and watered by luck , might yield more than threefold — a very poor rate of multiplication when the field is a young gentleman 's infinite soul , with all the numerals at command . Fred was not a gambler : he had not that specific disease in which the suspension of the whole nervous energy on a chance or risk becomes as necessary as the dram to the drunkard ; he had only the tendency to that diffusive form of gambling which has no alcoholic intensity , but is carried on with the healthiest chyle - fed blood , keeping up a joyous imaginative activity which fashions events according to desire , and having no fears about its own weather , only sees the advantage there must be to others in going aboard with it . Hopefulness has a pleasure in making a throw of any kind , because the prospect of success is certain ; and only a more generous pleasure in offering as many as possible a share in the stake . Fred liked play , especially billiards , as he liked hunting or riding a steeple - chase ; and he only liked it the better because he wanted money and hoped to win . But the twenty pounds ' worth of seed - corn had been planted in vain in the seductive green plot — all of it at least which had not been dispersed by the roadside — and Fred found himself close upon the term of payment with no money at command beyond the eighty pounds which he had deposited with his mother . The broken - winded horse which he rode represented a present which had been made to him a long while ago by his uncle Featherstone : his father always allowed him to keep a horse , Mr. Vincy 's own habits making him regard this as a reasonable demand even for a son who was rather exasperating . This horse , then , was Fred 's property , and in his anxiety to meet the imminent bill he determined to sacrifice a possession without which life would certainly be worth little . He made the resolution with a sense of heroism — heroism forced on him by the dread of breaking his word to Mr. Garth , by his love for Mary and awe of her opinion . He would start for Houndsley horse - fair which was to be held the next morning , and — simply sell his horse , bringing back the money by coach?—Well , the horse would hardly fetch more than thirty pounds , and there was no knowing what might happen ; it would be folly to balk himself of luck beforehand . It was a hundred to one that some good chance would fall in his way ; the longer he thought of it , the less possible it seemed that he should not have a good chance , and the less reasonable that he should not equip himself with the powder and shot for bringing it down . He would ride to Houndsley with Bambridge and with Horrock "
102105	102299	100791	100791	You	2557	" and without asking them anything expressly , he should virtually get the benefit of their opinion . Before he set out , Fred got the eighty pounds from his mother . Most of those who saw Fred riding out of Middlemarch in company with Bambridge and Horrock , on his way of course to Houndsley horse - fair , thought that young Vincy was pleasure - seeking as usual ; and but for an unwonted consciousness of grave matters on hand , he himself would have had a sense of dissipation , and of doing what might be expected of a gay young fellow . Considering that Fred was not at all coarse , that he rather looked down on the manners and speech of young men who had not been to the university , and that he had written stanzas as pastoral and unvoluptuous as his flute - playing , his attraction towards Bambridge and Horrock was an interesting fact which even the love of horse - flesh would not wholly account for without that mysterious influence of Naming which determinates so much of mortal choice . Under any other name than "
102301	102410	100791	100791	You	2557	" the society of Messieurs Bambridge and Horrock must certainly have been regarded as monotonous ; and to arrive with them at Houndsley on a drizzling afternoon , to get down at the Red Lion in a street shaded with coal - dust , and dine in a room furnished with a dirt - enamelled map of the county , a bad portrait of an anonymous horse in a stable , His Majesty George the Fourth with legs and cravat , and various leaden spittoons , might have seemed a hard business , but for the sustaining power of nomenclature which determined that the pursuit of these things was "
102413	102762	100791	100791	You	2557	" In Mr. Horrock there was certainly an apparent unfathomableness which offered play to the imagination . Costume , at a glance , gave him a thrilling association with horses ( enough to specify the hat - brim which took the slightest upward angle just to escape the suspicion of bending downwards ) , and nature had given him a face which by dint of Mongolian eyes , and a nose , mouth , and chin seeming to follow his hat - brim in a moderate inclination upwards , gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable sceptical smile , of all expressions the most tyrannous over a susceptible mind , and , when accompanied by adequate silence , likely to create the reputation of an invincible understanding , an infinite fund of humor — too dry to flow , and probably in a state of immovable crust,—and a critical judgment which , if you could ever be fortunate enough to know it , would be the thing and no other . It is a physiognomy seen in all vocations , but perhaps it has never been more powerful over the youth of England than in a judge of horses . Mr. Horrock , at a question from Fred about his horse 's fetlock , turned sideways in his saddle , and watched the horse 's action for the space of three minutes , then turned forward , twitched his own bridle , and remained silent with a profile neither more nor less sceptical than it had been . The part thus played in dialogue by Mr. Horrock was terribly effective . A mixture of passions was excited in Fred — a mad desire to thrash Horrock 's opinion into utterance , restrained by anxiety to retain the advantage of his friendship . There was always the chance that Horrock might say something quite invaluable at the right moment . Mr. Bambridge had more open manners , and appeared to give forth his ideas without economy . He was loud , robust , and was sometimes spoken of as being "
102765	102862	100791	100791	You	2557	indulgence"—chiefly in swearing , drinking , and beating his wife . Some people who had lost by him called him a vicious man ; but he regarded horse - dealing as the finest of the arts , and might have argued plausibly that it had nothing to do with morality . He was undeniably a prosperous man , bore his drinking better than others bore their moderation , and , on the whole , flourished like the green bay - tree . But his range of conversation was limited , and like the fine old tune , "
102867	103153	103154	103154	You	2560	" gave you after a while a sense of returning upon itself in a way that might make weak heads dizzy . But a slight infusion of Mr. Bambridge was felt to give tone and character to several circles in Middlemarch ; and he was a distinguished figure in the bar and billiard - room at the Green Dragon . He knew some anecdotes about the heroes of the turf , and various clever tricks of Marquesses and Viscounts which seemed to prove that blood asserted its pre - eminence even among black - legs ; but the minute retentiveness of his memory was chiefly shown about the horses he had himself bought and sold ; the number of miles they would trot you in no time without turning a hair being , after the lapse of years , still a subject of passionate asseveration , in which he would assist the imagination of his hearers by solemnly swearing that they never saw anything like it . In short , Mr. Bambridge was a man of pleasure and a gay companion . Fred was subtle , and did not tell his friends that he was going to Houndsley bent on selling his horse : he wished to get indirectly at their genuine opinion of its value , not being aware that a genuine opinion was the last thing likely to be extracted from such eminent critics . It was not Mr. Bambridge 's weakness to be a gratuitous flatterer . He had never before been so much struck with the fact that this unfortunate bay was a roarer to a degree which required the roundest word for perdition to give you any idea of it . "
103310	103311	103305	103308	that roarer of yours	2565	" "
103324	103333	103314	103314	you	452	" said Fred , more irritable than usual . "
103341	103348	103334	103334	I	0	" said Mr. Bambridge , emphatically . "
103359	103382	103334	103334	I	0	" Fred spurred his horse , and they trotted on a little way . When they slackened again , Mr. Bambridge said — "
103395	103396	103397	103397	I	0	" "
103408	103426	103405	103405	I	0	" said Fred , who required all the consciousness of being in gay company to support him ; "
103441	104789	103427	103427	I	0	" Mr. Horrock looked before him with as complete a neutrality as if he had been a portrait by a great master . Fred gave up the fallacious hope of getting a genuine opinion ; but on reflection he saw that Bambridge 's depreciation and Horrock 's silence were both virtually encouraging , and indicated that they thought better of the horse than they chose to say . That very evening , indeed , before the fair had set in , Fred thought he saw a favourable opening for disposing advantageously of his horse , but an opening which made him congratulate himself on his foresight in bringing with him his eighty pounds . A young farmer , acquainted with Mr. Bambridge , came into the Red Lion , and entered into conversation about parting with a hunter , which he introduced at once as Diamond , implying that it was a public character . For himself he only wanted a useful hack , which would draw upon occasion ; being about to marry and to give up hunting . The hunter was in a friend 's stable at some little distance ; there was still time for gentlemen to see it before dark . The friend 's stable had to be reached through a back street where you might as easily have been poisoned without expense of drugs as in any grim street of that unsanitary period . Fred was not fortified against disgust by brandy , as his companions were , but the hope of having at last seen the horse that would enable him to make money was exhilarating enough to lead him over the same ground again the first thing in the morning . He felt sure that if he did not come to a bargain with the farmer , Bambridge would ; for the stress of circumstances , Fred felt , was sharpening his acuteness and endowing him with all the constructive power of suspicion . Bambridge had run down Diamond in a way that he never would have done ( the horse being a friend 's ) if he had not thought of buying it ; every one who looked at the animal — even Horrock — was evidently impressed with its merit . To get all the advantage of being with men of this sort , you must know how to draw your inferences , and not be a spoon who takes things literally . The colour of the horse was a dappled gray , and Fred happened to know that Lord Medlicote 's man was on the look - out for just such a horse . After all his running down , Bambridge let it out in the course of the evening , when the farmer was absent , that he had seen worse horses go for eighty pounds . Of course he contradicted himself twenty times over , but when you know what is likely to be true you can test a man 's admissions . And Fred could not but reckon his own judgment of a horse as worth something . The farmer had paused over Fred 's respectable though broken - winded steed long enough to show that he thought it worth consideration , and it seemed probable that he would take it , with five - and - twenty pounds in addition , as the equivalent of Diamond . In that case Fred , when he had parted with his new horse for at least eighty pounds , would be fifty - five pounds in pocket by the transaction , and would have a hundred and thirty - five pounds towards meeting the bill ; so that the deficit temporarily thrown on Mr. Garth would at the utmost be twenty - five pounds . By the time he was hurrying on his clothes in the morning , he saw so clearly the importance of not losing this rare chance , that if Bambridge and Horrock had both dissuaded him , he would not have been deluded into a direct interpretation of their purpose : he would have been aware that those deep hands held something else than a young fellow 's interest . With regard to horses , distrust was your only clew . But scepticism , as we know , can never be thoroughly applied , else life would come to a standstill : something we must believe in and do , and whatever that something may be called , it is virtually our own judgment , even when it seems like the most slavish reliance on another . Fred believed in the excellence of his bargain , and even before the fair had well set in , had got possession of the dappled gray , at the price of his old horse and thirty pounds in addition — only five pounds more than he had expected to give . But he felt a little worried and wearied , perhaps with mental debate , and without waiting for the further gayeties of the horse - fair , he set out alone on his fourteen miles ' journey , meaning to take it very quietly and keep his horse fresh . I am sorry to say that only the third day after the propitious events at Houndsley Fred Vincy had fallen into worse spirits than he had known in his life before . Not that he had been disappointed as to the possible market for his horse , but that before the bargain could be concluded with Lord Medlicote 's man , this Diamond , in which hope to the amount of eighty pounds had been invested , had without the slightest warning exhibited in the stable a most vicious energy in kicking , had just missed killing the groom , and had ended in laming himself severely by catching his leg in a rope that overhung the stable - board . There was no more redress for this than for the discovery of bad temper after marriage — which of course old companions were aware of before the ceremony . For some reason or other , Fred had none of his usual elasticity under this stroke of ill - fortune : he was simply aware that he had only fifty pounds , that there was no chance of his getting any more at present , and that the bill for a hundred and sixty would be presented in five days . Even if he had applied to his father on the plea that Mr. Garth should be saved from loss , Fred felt smartingly that his father would angrily refuse to rescue Mr. Garth from the consequence of what he would call encouraging extravagance and deceit . He was so utterly downcast that he could frame no other project than to go straight to Mr. Garth and tell him the sad truth , carrying with him the fifty pounds , and getting that sum at least safely out of his own hands . His father , being at the warehouse , did not yet know of the accident : when he did , he would storm about the vicious brute being brought into his stable ; and before meeting that lesser annoyance Fred wanted to get away with all his courage to face the greater . He took his father 's nag , for he had made up his mind that when he had told Mr. Garth , he would ride to Stone Court and confess all to Mary . In fact , it is probable that but for Mary 's existence and Fred 's love for her , his conscience would have been much less active both in previously urging the debt on his thought and impelling him not to spare himself after his usual fashion by deferring an unpleasant task , but to act as directly and simply as he could . Even much stronger mortals than Fred Vincy hold half their rectitude in the mind of the being they love best . "
104799	105233	105236	105237	Mrs. Garth	443	" said an antique personage when his chief friend was dead ; and they are fortunate who get a theatre where the audience demands their best . Certainly it would have made a considerable difference to Fred at that time if Mary Garth had had no decided notions as to what was admirable in character . Mr. Garth was not at the office , and Fred rode on to his house , which was a little way outside the town — a homely place with an orchard in front of it , a rambling , old - fashioned , half - timbered building , which before the town had spread had been a farm - house , but was now surrounded with the private gardens of the townsmen . We get the fonder of our houses if they have a physiognomy of their own , as our friends have . The Garth family , which was rather a large one , for Mary had four brothers and one sister , were very fond of their old house , from which all the best furniture had long been sold . Fred liked it too , knowing it by heart even to the attic which smelt deliciously of apples and quinces , and until to - day he had never come to it without pleasant expectations ; but his heart beat uneasily now with the sense that he should probably have to make his confession before Mrs. Garth , of whom he was rather more in awe than of her husband . Not that she was inclined to sarcasm and to impulsive sallies , as Mary was . In her present matronly age at least , Mrs. Garth never committed herself by over - hasty speech ; having , as she said , borne the yoke in her youth , and learned self - control . She had that rare sense which discerns what is unalterable , and submits to it without murmuring . Adoring her husband 's virtues , she had very early made up her mind to his incapacity of minding his own interests , and had met the consequences cheerfully . She had been magnanimous enough to renounce all pride in teapots or children 's frilling , and had never poured any pathetic confidences into the ears of her feminine neighbors concerning Mr. Garth 's want of prudence and the sums he might have had if he had been like other men . Hence these fair neighbors thought her either proud or eccentric , and sometimes spoke of her to their husbands as "
105239	105434	105236	105237	Mrs. Garth	443	" She was not without her criticism of them in return , being more accurately instructed than most matrons in Middlemarch , and — where is the blameless woman?—apt to be a little severe towards her own sex , which in her opinion was framed to be entirely subordinate . On the other hand , she was disproportionately indulgent towards the failings of men , and was often heard to say that these were natural . Also , it must be admitted that Mrs. Garth was a trifle too emphatic in her resistance to what she held to be follies : the passage from governess into housewife had wrought itself a little too strongly into her consciousness , and she rarely forgot that while her grammar and accent were above the town standard , she wore a plain cap , cooked the family dinner , and darned all the stockings . She had sometimes taken pupils in a peripatetic fashion , making them follow her about in the kitchen with their book or slate . She thought it good for them to see that she could make an excellent lather while she corrected their blunders "
105436	105467	103427	103427	I	0	looking,"—that a woman with her sleeves tucked up above her elbows might know all about the Subjunctive Mood or the Torrid Zone — that , in short , she might possess "
105469	105476	105236	105237	Mrs. Garth	443	" and other good things ending in "
105479	105834	105236	105237	Mrs. Garth	443	" and worthy to be pronounced emphatically , without being a useless doll . When she made remarks to this edifying effect , she had a firm little frown on her brow , which yet did not hinder her face from looking benevolent , and her words which came forth like a procession were uttered in a fervid agreeable contralto . Certainly , the exemplary Mrs. Garth had her droll aspects , but her character sustained her oddities , as a very fine wine sustains a flavour of skin . Towards Fred Vincy she had a motherly feeling , and had always been disposed to excuse his errors , though she would probably not have excused Mary for engaging herself to him , her daughter being included in that more rigorous judgment which she applied to her own sex . But this very fact of her exceptional indulgence towards him made it the harder to Fred that he must now inevitably sink in her opinion . And the circumstances of his visit turned out to be still more unpleasant than he had expected ; for Caleb Garth had gone out early to look at some repairs not far off . Mrs. Garth at certain hours was always in the kitchen , and this morning she was carrying on several occupations at once there — making her pies at the well - scoured deal table on one side of that airy room , observing Sally 's movements at the oven and dough - tub through an open door , and giving lessons to her youngest boy and girl , who were standing opposite to her at the table with their books and slates before them . A tub and a clothes - horse at the other end of the kitchen indicated an intermittent wash of small things also going on . Mrs. Garth , with her sleeves turned above her elbows , deftly handling her pastry — applying her rolling - pin and giving ornamental pinches , while she expounded with grammatical fervor what were the right views about the concord of verbs and pronouns with "
105842	105951	105956	105956	she	2568	" was a sight agreeably amusing . She was of the same curly - haired , square - faced type as Mary , but handsomer , with more delicacy of feature , a pale skin , a solid matronly figure , and a remarkable firmness of glance . In her snowy - frilled cap she reminded one of that delightful Frenchwoman whom we have all seen marketing , basket on arm . Looking at the mother , you might hope that the daughter would become like her , which is a prospective advantage equal to a dowry — the mother too often standing behind the daughter like a malignant prophecy—"Such

106631	106632	106633	106633	Letty	457	" "
106641	106654	106635	106635	I	0	" said her mother , wringing out the caps from the tub . "
106711	106750	106753	106753	Ben	455	" ( Mrs. Garth delivered this awful sentence with much majesty of enunciation , and Letty felt that between repressed volubility and general disesteem , that of the Romans inclusive , life was already a painful affair . ) "
106755	106756	106753	106753	Ben	455	" "
106805	106806	106793	106793	they	2594	" "
106811	106830	106807	106807	Dictator	2598	" said Letty , with injured looks , and not without a wish to make her mother repent . "
106836	106842	106807	106807	Dictator	2598	" said Ben , contemptuously . "
106861	106862	106851	106851	he	455	" "
106877	106885	106869	106869	you	455	" said Mrs. Garth , carefully serious . "
106904	107020	107021	107021	You	2600	" The knock was Fred 's ; and when Letty said that her father was not in yet , but that her mother was in the kitchen , Fred had no alternative . He could not depart from his usual practice of going to see Mrs. Garth in the kitchen if she happened to be at work there . He put his arm round Letty 's neck silently , and led her into the kitchen without his usual jokes and caresses . Mrs. Garth was surprised to see Fred at this hour , but surprise was not a feeling that she was given to express , and she only said , quietly continuing her work — "
107040	107041	107042	107042	I	0	" "
107050	107059	107047	107048	Mr. Garth	442	" said Fred , not yet ready to say more—"and
107064	107105	107061	107061	you	442	" he added , after a little pause , for he had no doubt that Mrs. Garth knew everything about the bill , and he must in the end speak of it before her , if not to her solely . "
107116	107131	107132	107132	He	441	" said Mrs. Garth , who imagined some trouble between Fred and his father . "
107169	107170	107156	107156	you	442	" "
107183	107207	107181	107181	we	2602	" said Ben , who had taken Fred 's whip out of his hand , and was trying its efficiency on the cat . "
107240	107241	107238	107238	Fred	282	" "
107251	107260	107244	107245	old boy	2603	" said Fred , putting out his hand . "
107273	107293	107262	107262	you	442	" said Ben , rendering up the whip , with an air of not being obliged to do it . "
107310	107311	107302	107302	I	0	" "
107320	107321	107313	107313	you	442	" "
107328	107337	107324	107324	I	0	" said Fred , with an unpleasant twinge . "
107354	107355	107324	107324	I	0	" "
107365	107376	107324	107324	I	0	" said Mrs. Garth , seeing that Fred was teased . "
107389	107446	107386	107387	Mrs. Garth	443	" said Fred , when the children were gone and it was needful to say something that would pass the time . He was not yet sure whether he should wait for Mr. Garth , or use any good opportunity in conversation to confess to Mrs. Garth herself , give her the money and ride away . "
107469	107476	107477	107477	I	0	" said Mrs. Garth , smiling . "
107522	107551	107514	107514	he	250	" This did not lead well towards the news that Mr. Garth was on the brink of losing ninety - two pounds and more . Fred was silent . "
107565	107581	107514	107514	he	250	" Mrs. Garth innocently continued , pulling out the edging on a cap - border . "
107626	107645	107610	107610	him	250	" When they entered the parlor Caleb had thrown down his hat and was seated at his desk . "
107653	107670	107648	107648	Fred	282	" he said , in a tone of mild surprise , holding his pen still undipped ; "
107676	107694	107648	107648	Fred	282	" But missing the usual expression of cheerful greeting in Fred 's face , he immediately added , "
107704	107705	107648	107648	Fred	282	" "
107778	107844	107765	107765	I	0	" While Fred was speaking , he had taken out the notes and laid them on the desk before Mr. Garth . He had burst forth at once with the plain fact , feeling boyishly miserable and without verbal resources . Mrs. Garth was mutely astonished , and looked at her husband for an explanation . Caleb blushed , and after a little pause said — "
107883	107919	107874	107874	He	282	" There was an evident change in Mrs. Garth 's face , but it was like a change below the surface of water which remains smooth . She fixed her eyes on Fred , saying — "
107939	107940	107920	107920	I	0	" "
107943	107957	107920	107920	I	0	" said Fred , biting his lip , and speaking with more difficulty ; "
107992	107993	107984	107985	Mr. Garth	442	" "
108002	108022	108027	108027	I'm	2616	" said Caleb , in his hesitating way , looking down at the notes and nervously fingering the paper , "
108081	108082	108076	108077	the deuce	2619	" "
108102	108127	108093	108093	I	0	" said Mrs. Garth , gravely and decisively , though a nice ear might have discerned a slight tremor in some of the words . "
108151	108355	108146	108146	She	301	" Mrs. Garth had not again looked at Fred , and was not in the least calculating what words she should use to cut him the most effectively . Like the eccentric woman she was , she was at present absorbed in considering what was to be done , and did not fancy that the end could be better achieved by bitter remarks or explosions . But she had made Fred feel for the first time something like the tooth of remorse . Curiously enough , his pain in the affair beforehand had consisted almost entirely in the sense that he must seem dishonourable , and sink in the opinion of the Garths : he had not occupied himself with the inconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion them , for this exercise of the imagination on other people 's needs is not common with hopeful young gentlemen . Indeed we are most of us brought up in the notion that the highest motive for not doing a wrong is something irrespective of the beings who would suffer the wrong . But at this moment he suddenly saw himself as a pitiful rascal who was robbing two women of their savings . "
108368	108373	108363	108364	Mrs. Garth	443	" he stammered out . "
108378	108402	108363	108364	Mrs. Garth	443	" said Mrs. Garth , who having a special dislike to fine words on ugly occasions , could not now repress an epigram . "
108419	108433	108434	108434	I	0	" She had never been so little inclined to make excuses for Fred . "
108444	108448	108449	108449	Fred	282	" said Caleb . "
108480	108501	108469	108469	you	379	" he added , fixing his merciful gray eyes on Fred . Caleb was too delicate to specify Mr. Featherstone . "
108651	108699	108642	108642	You	379	" Fred turned round and hurried out of the room , conscious that he was getting rather womanish , and feeling confusedly that his being sorry was not of much use to the Garths . They could see him mount , and quickly pass through the gate . "
108707	108712	108704	108705	Fred Vincy	282	" said Mrs. Garth . "
108764	108765	108766	108766	I	0	" "
108773	108774	108768	108769	a fool	2625	" "
108779	108788	108776	108776	you	0	" said the wife , nodding and smiling . "
108853	108854	108843	108843	I	0	" "
108866	108875	108864	108864	Susan	379	" said Caleb , looking feelingly at her . "
108891	108892	108898	108898	I	0	" "
108972	109001	108956	108956	you	379	" Caleb had pushed his chair back , and was leaning forward , shaking his head slowly , and fitting his finger - tips together with much nicety . "
109005	109009	109010	109010	Susan	379	" he said . "
109012	109021	109010	109010	Susan	379	" he went on in a lowered tone , "
109032	109033	109025	109025	she	301	" "
109060	109083	109084	109084	Deuce	463	" Caleb made no rejoinder , but presently lowered his spectacles , drew up his chair to the desk , and said , "
109105	109147	109084	109084	Deuce	463	" The first part of this speech comprised his whole store of maledictory expression , and was uttered with a slight snarl easy to imagine . But it would be difficult to convey to those who never heard him utter the word "
109150	109392	109084	109084	Deuce	463	" the peculiar tone of fervid veneration , of religious regard , in which he wrapped it , as a consecrated symbol is wrapped in its gold - fringed linen . Caleb Garth often shook his head in meditation on the value , the indispensable might of that myriad - headed , myriad - handed labour by which the social body is fed , clothed , and housed . It had laid hold of his imagination in boyhood . The echoes of the great hammer where roof or keel were a - making , the signal - shouts of the workmen , the roar of the furnace , the thunder and plash of the engine , were a sublime music to him ; the felling and lading of timber , and the huge trunk vibrating star - like in the distance along the highway , the crane at work on the wharf , the piled - up produce in warehouses , the precision and variety of muscular effort wherever exact work had to be turned out,—all these sights of his youth had acted on him as poetry without the aid of the poets , had made a philosophy for him without the aid of philosophers , a religion without the aid of theology . His early ambition had been to have as effective a share as possible in this sublime labour , which was peculiarly dignified by him with the name of "
109395	109469	109084	109084	Deuce	463	" and though he had only been a short time under a surveyor , and had been chiefly his own teacher , he knew more of land , building , and mining than most of the special men in the county . His classification of human employments was rather crude , and , like the categories of more celebrated men , would not be acceptable in these advanced times . He divided them into "
109481	109541	109084	109084	Deuce	463	" He had nothing to say against the last four ; but he regarded them as a reverential pagan regarded other gods than his own . In the same way , he thought very well of all ranks , but he would not himself have liked to be of any rank in which he had not such close contact with "
109543	109753	109997	110003	a good - for - nothing blackguard	2631	" as to get often honourably decorated with marks of dust and mortar , the damp of the engine , or the sweet soil of the woods and fields . Though he had never regarded himself as other than an orthodox Christian , and would argue on prevenient grace if the subject were proposed to him , I think his virtual divinities were good practical schemes , accurate work , and the faithful completion of undertakings : his prince of darkness was a slack workman . But there was no spirit of denial in Caleb , and the world seemed so wondrous to him that he was ready to accept any number of systems , like any number of firmaments , if they did not obviously interfere with the best land - drainage , solid building , correct measuring , and judicious boring ( for coal ) . In fact , he had a reverential soul with a strong practical intelligence . But he could not manage finance : he knew values well , but he had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of profit and loss : and having ascertained this to his cost , he determined to give up all forms of his beloved "
109755	109833	109084	109084	Deuce	463	" which required that talent . He gave himself up entirely to the many kinds of work which he could do without handling capital , and was one of those precious men within his own district whom everybody would choose to work for them , because he did his work well , charged very little , and often declined to charge at all . It is no wonder , then , that the Garths were poor , and "
109840	109987	109084	109084	Deuce	463	" However , they did not mind it . Fred Vincy wanted to arrive at Stone Court when Mary could not expect him , and when his uncle was not downstairs : in that case she might be sitting alone in the wainscoted parlor . He left his horse in the yard to avoid making a noise on the gravel in front , and entered the parlor without other notice than the noise of the door - handle . Mary was in her usual corner , laughing over Mrs. Piozzi 's recollections of Johnson , and looked up with the fun still in her face . It gradually faded as she saw Fred approach her without speaking , and stand before her with his elbow on the mantel - piece , looking ill . She too was silent , only raising her eyes to him inquiringly . "
109990	109994	109988	109988	Mary	301	" he began , "
110005	110006	110007	110007	I	0	" "
110020	110032	110033	110033	I	0	" said Mary , trying to smile , but feeling alarmed . "
110086	110087	110074	110074	You	2632	" "
110133	110134	110135	110135	I	0	" "
110288	110289	110283	110283	You	2632	" "
110298	110355	110283	110283	You	2632	" said Mary , her eyes filling with tears , and a little sob rising which she tried to repress . She looked straight before her and took no notice of Fred , all the consequences at home becoming present to her . He too remained silent for some moments , feeling more miserable than ever . "
110368	110374	110366	110366	Mary	301	" he said at last . "
110381	110382	110375	110375	You	2632	" "
110392	110398	110375	110375	You	2632	" said Mary , passionately . "
110444	110445	110448	110448	you	2632	" "
110458	110459	110460	110460	I	0	" "
110468	110475	110460	110460	I	0	" said Mary , more quietly , "
110484	110536	110477	110477	my	0	" She dried her eyes , threw aside her book , rose and fetched her sewing . Fred followed her with his eyes , hoping that they would meet hers , and in that way find access for his imploring penitence . But no ! Mary could easily avoid looking upward . "
110547	110560	110537	110537	I	0	" he said , when she was seated again and sewing quickly . "
110598	110599	110600	110600	My	0	" "
110675	110676	110677	110677	I	0	" "
110699	110700	110692	110692	you	282	" "
110739	110740	110731	110731	I	0	" "
110771	110772	110760	110760	you	282	" "
110818	110819	110797	110797	They	2648	" "
110859	110860	110854	110854	he	7387	" "
110875	110886	110887	110887	He	7387	" said Mary , in a deep tone of indignation . "
110932	110933	110917	110917	he	7387	" "
110997	111003	110993	110993	I	0	" Fred ended , languidly . "
111030	111143	111014	111014	I	0	" Mary had dropped her work out of her hand and looked up . There is often something maternal even in a girlish love , and Mary 's hard experience had wrought her nature to an impressibility very different from that hard slight thing which we call girlishness . At Fred 's last words she felt an instantaneous pang , something like what a mother feels at the imagined sobs or cries of her naughty truant child , which may lose itself and get harm . And when , looking up , her eyes met his dull despairing glance , her pity for him surmounted her anger and all her other anxieties . "
111187	111254	111177	111177	he	6726	" Mary spoke hurriedly , saying the words that came first without knowing very well what they were , but saying them in a half - soothing half - beseeching tone , and rising as if to go away to Mr. Featherstone . Of course Fred felt as if the clouds had parted and a gleam had come : he moved and stood in her way . "
111284	111285	111268	111268	you	301	" "
111300	111309	111268	111268	you	301	" said Mary , in a mournful tone . "
111386	111387	111388	111388	I	0	" "
111408	111409	111410	111410	I	0	" "
111498	111584	111585	111585	I	0	" Mary 's lips had begun to curl with a smile as soon as she had asked that question about Fred 's future ( young souls are mobile ) , and before she ended , her face had its full illumination of fun . To him it was like the cessation of an ache that Mary could laugh at him , and with a passive sort of smile he tried to reach her hand ; but she slipped away quickly towards the door and said , "
111600	111621	111593	111593	him	6726	" Fred secretly felt that his future was guaranteed against the fulfilment of Mary 's sarcastic prophecies , apart from that "
111623	111912	111913	111913	I	0	" which he was ready to do if she would define it . He never dared in Mary 's presence to approach the subject of his expectations from Mr. Featherstone , and she always ignored them , as if everything depended on himself . But if ever he actually came into the property , she must recognize the change in his position . All this passed through his mind somewhat languidly , before he went up to see his uncle . He stayed but a little while , excusing himself on the ground that he had a cold ; and Mary did not reappear before he left the house . But as he rode home , he began to be more conscious of being ill , than of being melancholy . When Caleb Garth arrived at Stone Court soon after dusk , Mary was not surprised , although he seldom had leisure for paying her a visit , and was not at all fond of having to talk with Mr. Featherstone . The old man , on the other hand , felt himself ill at ease with a brother - in - law whom he could not annoy , who did not mind about being considered poor , had nothing to ask of him , and understood all kinds of farming and mining business better than he did . But Mary had felt sure that her parents would want to see her , and if her father had not come , she would have obtained leave to go home for an hour or two the next day . After discussing prices during tea with Mr. Featherstone , Caleb rose to bid him good - by , and said , "
111922	112033	111920	111920	Mary	301	" She took a candle into another large parlor , where there was no fire , and setting down the feeble light on the dark mahogany table , turned round to her father , and putting her arms round his neck kissed him with childish kisses which he delighted in,—the expression of his large brows softening as the expression of a great beautiful dog softens when it is caressed . Mary was his favourite child , and whatever Susan might say , and right as she was on all other subjects , Caleb thought it natural that Fred or any one else should think Mary more lovable than other girls . "
112045	112053	112034	112034	I	0	" said Caleb in his hesitating way . "
112066	112067	112071	112071	father	887	" "
112081	112082	112073	112073	I	0	" "
112180	112181	112172	112172	she	7143	" "
112220	112239	112257	112257	child,—but	2679	" Mary took out the folded money from her reticule and put it into her father 's hand . "
112265	112296	112297	112297	Fred	282	" said Caleb , who , in his unconquerable indifference to money , was beginning to be chiefly concerned about the relation the affair might have to Mary 's affections . "
112303	112304	112297	112297	Fred	282	" "
112313	112314	112308	112308	he	282	" "
112328	112329	112321	112321	He	282	" "
112342	112351	112340	112340	Mary	301	" said the father , with hesitating tenderness . "
112386	112387	112383	112384	your mother	7143	" "
112395	112416	112393	112393	father	887	" said Mary , not looking up , but putting the back of her father 's hand against her cheek . "
112450	112481	112447	112447	You	301	Mary"—here Caleb 's voice became more tender ; he had been pushing his hat about on the table and looking at it , but finally he turned his eyes on his daughter—"a
112522	112540	112507	112508	Your mother	7143	" Mary turned the back of her father 's hand to her lips and smiled at him . "
112549	112561	112562	112562	I	0	but"—here Mr. Garth shook his head to help out the inadequacy of words—"what
112712	112713	112720	112720	father	887	" "
112722	112733	112720	112720	father	887	" said Mary , gravely meeting her father 's eyes ; "
112810	112811	112797	112797	You	6867	" "
112825	112835	112821	112821	I	0	" said Mr. Garth , taking up his hat . "
112850	112851	112852	112852	Father	887	" "
112854	112865	112852	112852	Father	887	" said Mary , in her deepest tone of remonstrance . "
112877	112891	112852	112852	Father	887	" was her last word before he closed the outer door on himself . "

112961	113004	112959	112959	sir	6934	" said Mary , coldly . Mr. Featherstone grunted : he could not deny that an ordinary sort of girl like her might be expected to be useful , so he thought of another rejoinder , disagreeable enough to be always apropos . "

113058	113170	113055	113055	he	282	me.—"—Troilus and Cressida . But Fred did not go to Stone Court the next day , for reasons that were quite peremptory . From those visits to unsanitary Houndsley streets in search of Diamond , he had brought back not only a bad bargain in horse - flesh , but the further misfortune of some ailment which for a day or two had deemed mere depression and headache , but which got so much worse when he returned from his visit to Stone Court that , going into the dining - room , he threw himself on the sofa , and in answer to his mother 's anxious question , said , "
113184	113198	113182	113182	Wrench	293	" Wrench came , but did not apprehend anything serious , spoke of a "
113202	113388	113182	113182	Wrench	293	" and did not speak of coming again on the morrow . He had a due value for the Vincys ' house , but the wariest men are apt to be dulled by routine , and on worried mornings will sometimes go through their business with the zest of the daily bell - ringer . Mr. Wrench was a small , neat , bilious man , with a well - dressed wig : he had a labourious practice , an irascible temper , a lymphatic wife and seven children ; and he was already rather late before setting out on a four - miles drive to meet Dr. Minchin on the other side of Tipton , the decease of Hicks , a rural practitioner , having increased Middlemarch practice in that direction . Great statesmen err , and why not small medical men ? Mr. Wrench did not neglect sending the usual white parcels , which this time had black and drastic contents . Their effect was not alleviating to poor Fred , who , however , unwilling as he said to believe that he was "
113394	113465	113470	113470	mother	7322	" rose at his usual easy hour the next morning and went down - stairs meaning to breakfast , but succeeded in nothing but in sitting and shivering by the fire . Mr. Wrench was again sent for , but was gone on his rounds , and Mrs. Vincy seeing her darling 's changed looks and general misery , began to cry and said she would send for Dr. Sprague . "
113476	113489	113490	113490	I	0	" said Fred , putting out his hot dry hand to her , "
113508	113509	113510	113510	Mamma	6725	" "
113512	113539	113510	113510	Mamma	6725	" said Rosamond , who was seated near the window ( the dining - room windows looked on that highly respectable street called Lowick Gate ) , "
113575	113807	113568	113568	They	2712	" Mrs. Vincy sprang to the window and opened it in an instant , thinking only of Fred and not of medical etiquette . Lydgate was only two yards off on the other side of some iron palisading , and turned round at the sudden sound of the sash , before she called to him . In two minutes he was in the room , and Rosamond went out , after waiting just long enough to show a pretty anxiety conflicting with her sense of what was becoming . Lydgate had to hear a narrative in which Mrs. Vincy 's mind insisted with remarkable instinct on every point of minor importance , especially on what Mr. Wrench had said and had not said about coming again . That there might be an awkward affair with Wrench , Lydgate saw at once ; but the case was serious enough to make him dismiss that consideration : he was convinced that Fred was in the pink - skinned stage of typhoid fever , and that he had taken just the wrong medicines . He must go to bed immediately , must have a regular nurse , and various appliances and precautions must be used , about which Lydgate was particular . Poor Mrs. Vincy 's terror at these indications of danger found vent in such words as came most easily . She thought it "
113891	114007	113877	113878	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Here poor Mrs. Vincy 's spirit quite broke down , and her Niobe throat and good - humored face were sadly convulsed . This was in the hall out of Fred 's hearing , but Rosamond had opened the drawing - room door , and now came forward anxiously . Lydgate apologized for Mr. Wrench , said that the symptoms yesterday might have been disguising , and that this form of fever was very equivocal in its beginnings : he would go immediately to the druggist 's and have a prescription made up in order to lose no time , but he would write to Mr. Wrench and tell him what had been done . "
114068	114069	114056	114056	he	293	" "
114082	114104	114080	114080	I	0	" said Lydgate , really believing that Wrench was not well prepared to deal wisely with a case of this kind . "
114113	114214	114110	114111	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Rosamond , coming to her mother 's aid , and supporting her arm to lead her away . When Mr. Vincy came home he was very angry with Wrench , and did not care if he never came into his house again . Lydgate should go on now , whether Wrench liked it or not . It was no joke to have fever in the house . Everybody must be sent to now , not to come to dinner on Thursday . And Pritchard need n't get up any wine : brandy was the best thing against infection . "
114220	114245	114246	114246	He	2722	" added Mr. Vincy , emphatically — as much as to say , this was not an occasion for firing with blank - cartridges . "
114284	114285	114280	114282	an eldest son	2724	" "
114293	114303	114305	114305	you	282	" said the mother , with a quivering lip , "
114316	114317	114305	114305	you	282	" "
114332	114340	114325	114325	Lucy	469	" said Mr. Vincy , more mildly . "
114353	114386	114347	114347	I	0	" ( What Mr. Vincy thought confusedly was , that the fever might somehow have been hindered if Wrench had shown the proper solicitude about his — the Mayor's — family . ) "
114430	114541	114427	114427	he	293	" Wrench did not take it at all well . Lydgate was as polite as he could be in his offhand way , but politeness in a man who has placed you at a disadvantage is only an additional exasperation , especially if he happens to have been an object of dislike beforehand . Country practitioners used to be an irritable species , susceptible on the point of honour ; and Mr. Wrench was one of the most irritable among them . He did not refuse to meet Lydgate in the evening , but his temper was somewhat tried on the occasion . He had to hear Mrs. Vincy say — "
114580	114628	114629	114629	I	0	" Mr. Vincy , who had been keeping up a sharp fire on the enemy Infection , and was a good deal heated in consequence , started up when he heard Wrench come in , and went into the hall to let him know what he thought . "
114643	114673	114635	114635	Wrench	293	" said the Mayor , who of late had had to rebuke offenders with an official air , and now broadened himself by putting his thumbs in his armholes . "
114705	114741	114702	114702	my	0	" But irrational reproaches were easier to bear than the sense of being instructed , or rather the sense that a younger man , like Lydgate , inwardly considered him in need of instruction , for "
114747	115154	114702	114702	my	0	" Mr. Wrench afterwards said , Lydgate paraded flighty , foreign notions , which would not wear . He swallowed his ire for the moment , but he afterwards wrote to decline further attendance in the case . The house might be a good one , but Mr. Wrench was not going to truckle to anybody on a professional matter . He reflected , with much probability on his side , that Lydgate would by - and - by be caught tripping too , and that his ungentlemanly attempts to discredit the sale of drugs by his professional brethren , would by - and - by recoil on himself . He threw out biting remarks on Lydgate 's tricks , worthy only of a quack , to get himself a factitious reputation with credulous people . That ca nt about cures was never got up by sound practitioners . This was a point on which Lydgate smarted as much as Wrench could desire . To be puffed by ignorance was not only humiliating , but perilous , and not more enviable than the reputation of the weather - prophet . He was impatient of the foolish expectations amidst which all work must be carried on , and likely enough to damage himself as much as Mr. Wrench could wish , by an unprofessional openness . However , Lydgate was installed as medical attendant on the Vincys , and the event was a subject of general conversation in Middlemarch . Some said , that the Vincys had behaved scandalously , that Mr. Vincy had threatened Wrench , and that Mrs. Vincy had accused him of poisoning her son . Others were of opinion that Mr. Lydgate 's passing by was providential , that he was wonderfully clever in fevers , and that Bulstrode was in the right to bring him forward . Many people believed that Lydgate 's coming to the town at all was really due to Bulstrode ; and Mrs. Taft , who was always counting stitches and gathered her information in misleading fragments caught between the rows of her knitting , had got it into her head that Mr. Lydgate was a natural son of Bulstrode 's , a fact which seemed to justify her suspicions of evangelical laymen . She one day communicated this piece of knowledge to Mrs. Farebrother , who did not fail to tell her son of it , observing — "
115177	115178	115174	115175	Mr. Lydgate	278	" "
115183	115193	115181	115181	mother	7322	" said Mr. Farebrother , after an explosive laugh , "
115219	115220	115209	115209	He	278	" "
115234	115244	115232	115232	Camden	390	" said the old lady , with an air of precision.—"But
115259	115686	115255	115257	some other son	2736	" An eminent philosopher among my friends , who can dignify even your ugly furniture by lifting it into the serene light of science , has shown me this pregnant little fact . Your pier - glass or extensive surface of polished steel made to be rubbed by a housemaid , will be minutely and multitudinously scratched in all directions ; but place now against it a lighted candle as a centre of illumination , and lo ! the scratches will seem to arrange themselves in a fine series of concentric circles round that little sun . It is demonstrable that the scratches are going everywhere impartially and it is only your candle which produces the flattering illusion of a concentric arrangement , its light falling with an exclusive optical selection . These things are a parable . The scratches are events , and the candle is the egoism of any person now absent — of Miss Vincy , for example . Rosamond had a Providence of her own who had kindly made her more charming than other girls , and who seemed to have arranged Fred 's illness and Mr. Wrench 's mistake in order to bring her and Lydgate within effective proximity . It would have been to contravene these arrangements if Rosamond had consented to go away to Stone Court or elsewhere , as her parents wished her to do , especially since Mr. Lydgate thought the precaution needless . Therefore , while Miss Morgan and the children were sent away to a farmhouse the morning after Fred 's illness had declared itself , Rosamond refused to leave papa and mamma . Poor mamma indeed was an object to touch any creature born of woman ; and Mr. Vincy , who doted on his wife , was more alarmed on her account than on Fred 's . But for his insistence she would have taken no rest : her brightness was all bedimmed ; unconscious of her costume which had always been so fresh and gay , she was like a sick bird with languid eye and plumage ruffled , her senses dulled to the sights and sounds that used most to interest her . Fred 's delirium , in which he seemed to be wandering out of her reach , tore her heart . After her first outburst against Mr. Wrench she went about very quietly : her one low cry was to Lydgate . She would follow him out of the room and put her hand on his arm moaning out , "
115691	115696	115255	115257	some other son	2736	" Once she pleaded , "
115716	115778	115708	115708	he	2559	mother,"—as if poor Fred 's suffering were an accusation against him . All the deepest fibres of the mother 's memory were stirred , and the young man whose voice took a gentler tone when he spoke to her , was one with the babe whom she had loved , with a love new to her , before he was born . "
115787	115792	115784	115785	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Lydgate would say . "
115805	116174	115784	115785	Mrs. Vincy	290	" In that way he led her to the parlor where Rosamond was , and made a change for her , surprising her into taking some tea or broth which had been prepared for her . There was a constant understanding between him and Rosamond on these matters . He almost always saw her before going to the sickroom , and she appealed to him as to what she could do for mamma . Her presence of mind and adroitness in carrying out his hints were admirable , and it is not wonderful that the idea of seeing Rosamond began to mingle itself with his interest in the case . Especially when the critical stage was passed , and he began to feel confident of Fred 's recovery . In the more doubtful time , he had advised calling in Dr. Sprague ( who , if he could , would rather have remained neutral on Wrench 's account ) ; but after two consultations , the conduct of the case was left to Lydgate , and there was every reason to make him assiduous . Morning and evening he was at Mr. Vincy 's , and gradually the visits became cheerful as Fred became simply feeble , and lay not only in need of the utmost petting but conscious of it , so that Mrs. Vincy felt as if , after all , the illness had made a festival for her tenderness . Both father and mother held it an added reason for good spirits , when old Mr. Featherstone sent messages by Lydgate , saying that Fred must make haste and get well , as he , Peter Featherstone , could not do without him , and missed his visits sadly . The old man himself was getting bedridden . Mrs. Vincy told these messages to Fred when he could listen , and he turned towards her his delicate , pinched face , from which all the thick blond hair had been cut away , and in which the eyes seemed to have got larger , yearning for some word about Mary — wondering what she felt about his illness . No word passed his lips ; but "
116186	116215	116249	116249	he	2740	" and the mother in the fulness of her heart not only divined Fred 's longing , but felt ready for any sacrifice in order to satisfy him . "
116226	116235	116217	116217	I	0	" she said , in her loving folly ; "
116253	116254	116245	116245	he	2740	" "
116265	116283	116263	116263	mother	7322	" said Fred . The illness had made him childish , and tears came as he spoke . "
116295	117781	116292	116293	my dear	6867	" said Mrs. Vincy , secretly incredulous of any such refusal . She never left Fred 's side when her husband was not in the house , and thus Rosamond was in the unusual position of being much alone . Lydgate , naturally , never thought of staying long with her , yet it seemed that the brief impersonal conversations they had together were creating that peculiar intimacy which consists in shyness . They were obliged to look at each other in speaking , and somehow the looking could not be carried through as the matter of course which it really was . Lydgate began to feel this sort of consciousness unpleasant and one day looked down , or anywhere , like an ill - worked puppet . But this turned out badly : the next day , Rosamond looked down , and the consequence was that when their eyes met again , both were more conscious than before . There was no help for this in science , and as Lydgate did not want to flirt , there seemed to be no help for it in folly . It was therefore a relief when neighbors no longer considered the house in quarantine , and when the chances of seeing Rosamond alone were very much reduced . But that intimacy of mutual embarrassment , in which each feels that the other is feeling something , having once existed , its effect is not to be done away with . Talk about the weather and other well - bred topics is apt to seem a hollow device , and behavior can hardly become easy unless it frankly recognizes a mutual fascination — which of course need not mean anything deep or serious . This was the way in which Rosamond and Lydgate slid gracefully into ease , and made their intercourse lively again . Visitors came and went as usual , there was once more music in the drawing - room , and all the extra hospitality of Mr. Vincy 's mayoralty returned . Lydgate , whenever he could , took his seat by Rosamond 's side , and lingered to hear her music , calling himself her captive — meaning , all the while , not to be her captive . The preposterousness of the notion that he could at once set up a satisfactory establishment as a married man was a sufficient guarantee against danger . This play at being a little in love was agreeable , and did not interfere with graver pursuits . Flirtation , after all , was not necessarily a singeing process . Rosamond , for her part , had never enjoyed the days so much in her life before : she was sure of being admired by some one worth captivating , and she did not distinguish flirtation from love , either in herself or in another . She seemed to be sailing with a fair wind just whither she would go , and her thoughts were much occupied with a handsome house in Lowick Gate which she hoped would by - and - by be vacant . She was quite determined , when she was married , to rid herself adroitly of all the visitors who were not agreeable to her at her father 's ; and she imagined the drawing - room in her favourite house with various styles of furniture . Certainly her thoughts were much occupied with Lydgate himself ; he seemed to her almost perfect : if he had known his notes so that his enchantment under her music had been less like an emotional elephant 's , and if he had been able to discriminate better the refinements of her taste in dress , she could hardly have mentioned a deficiency in him . How different he was from young Plymdale or Mr. Caius Larcher ! Those young men had not a notion of French , and could speak on no subject with striking knowledge , except perhaps the dyeing and carrying trades , which of course they were ashamed to mention ; they were Middlemarch gentry , elated with their silver - headed whips and satin stocks , but embarrassed in their manners , and timidly jocose : even Fred was above them , having at least the accent and manner of a university man . Whereas Lydgate was always listened to , bore himself with the careless politeness of conscious superiority , and seemed to have the right clothes on by a certain natural affinity , without ever having to think about them . Rosamond was proud when he entered the room , and when he approached her with a distinguishing smile , she had a delicious sense that she was the object of enviable homage . If Lydgate had been aware of all the pride he excited in that delicate bosom , he might have been just as well pleased as any other man , even the most densely ignorant of humoral pathology or fibrous tissue : he held it one of the prettiest attitudes of the feminine mind to adore a man 's pre - eminence without too precise a knowledge of what it consisted in . But Rosamond was not one of those helpless girls who betray themselves unawares , and whose behavior is awkwardly driven by their impulses , instead of being steered by wary grace and propriety . Do you imagine that her rapid forecast and rumination concerning house - furniture and society were ever discernible in her conversation , even with her mamma ? On the contrary , she would have expressed the prettiest surprise and disapprobation if she had heard that another young lady had been detected in that immodest prematureness — indeed , would probably have disbelieved in its possibility . For Rosamond never showed any unbecoming knowledge , and was always that combination of correct sentiments , music , dancing , drawing , elegant note - writing , private album for extracted verse , and perfect blond loveliness , which made the irresistible woman for the doomed man of that date . Think no unfair evil of her , pray : she had no wicked plots , nothing sordid or mercenary ; in fact , she never thought of money except as something necessary which other people would always provide . She was not in the habit of devising falsehoods , and if her statements were no direct clew to fact , why , they were not intended in that light — they were among her elegant accomplishments , intended to please . Nature had inspired many arts in finishing Mrs. Lemon 's favourite pupil , who by general consent ( Fred 's excepted ) was a rare compound of beauty , cleverness , and amiability . Lydgate found it more and more agreeable to be with her , and there was no constraint now , there was a delightful interchange of influence in their eyes , and what they said had that superfluity of meaning for them , which is observable with some sense of flatness by a third person ; still they had no interviews or asides from which a third person need have been excluded . In fact , they flirted ; and Lydgate was secure in the belief that they did nothing else . If a man could not love and be wise , surely he could flirt and be wise at the same time ? Really , the men in Middlemarch , except Mr. Farebrother , were great bores , and Lydgate did not care about commercial politics or cards : what was he to do for relaxation ? He was often invited to the Bulstrodes ' ; but the girls there were hardly out of the schoolroom ; and Mrs. Bulstrode 's naive way of conciliating piety and worldliness , the nothingness of this life and the desirability of cut glass , the consciousness at once of filthy rags and the best damask , was not a sufficient relief from the weight of her husband 's invariable seriousness . The Vincys ' house , with all its faults , was the pleasanter by contrast ; besides , it nourished Rosamond — sweet to look at as a half - opened blush - rose , and adorned with accomplishments for the refined amusement of man . But he made some enemies , other than medical , by his success with Miss Vincy . One evening he came into the drawing - room rather late , when several other visitors were there . The card - table had drawn off the elders , and Mr. Ned Plymdale ( one of the good matches in Middlemarch , though not one of its leading minds ) was in tete - a - tete with Rosamond . He had brought the last "
117784	117873	116292	116293	my dear	6867	" the gorgeous watered - silk publication which marked modern progress at that time ; and he considered himself very fortunate that he could be the first to look over it with her , dwelling on the ladies and gentlemen with shiny copper - plate cheeks and copper - plate smiles , and pointing to comic verses as capital and sentimental stories as interesting . Rosamond was gracious , and Mr. Ned was satisfied that he had the very best thing in art and literature as a medium for "
117875	117947	117948	117948	I	0	addresses"—the very thing to please a nice girl . He had also reasons , deep rather than ostensible , for being satisfied with his own appearance . To superficial observers his chin had too vanishing an aspect , looking as if it were being gradually reabsorbed . And it did indeed cause him some difficulty about the fit of his satin stocks , for which chins were at that time useful . "
117959	117981	117957	117957	you	2744	" said Mr. Ned . He kept the book open at the bewitching portrait , and looked at it rather languishingly . "
117996	118033	117988	117988	she	2745	" said Rosamond , not meaning any satire , but thinking how red young Plymdale 's hands were , and wondering why Lydgate did not come . She went on with her tatting all the while . "
118046	118061	118034	118034	I	0	" said Mr. Ned , venturing to look from the portrait to its rival . "
118071	118155	118064	118064	you	2744	" said Rosamond , feeling sure that she should have to reject this young gentleman a second time . But now Lydgate came in ; the book was closed before he reached Rosamond 's corner , and as he took his seat with easy confidence on the other side of her , young Plymdale 's jaw fell like a barometer towards the cheerless side of change . Rosamond enjoyed not only Lydgate 's presence but its effect : she liked to excite jealousy . "
118163	118172	118157	118159	a late comer	2747	" she said , as they shook hands . "
118189	118190	118185	118185	you	2744	" "
118224	118225	118226	118227	Poor fellow	2012	" "
118229	118235	118226	118227	Poor fellow	2012	" said Rosamond , prettily . "
118243	118253	118236	118236	You	2744	" she added , turning to the other suitor ; "
118268	118279	118258	118259	Mr. Lydgate	278	" Mr. Ned smiled nervously , while Lydgate , drawing the "
118281	118307	118310	118310	you	278	" towards him and opening it , gave a short scornful laugh and tossed up his chin , as if in wonderment at human folly . "
118316	118324	118310	118310	you	278	" said Rosamond , with bland neutrality . "
118343	118386	118310	118310	you	278	" said Lydgate , in his most convinced tone , while he turned over the pages quickly , seeming to see all through the book in no time , and showing his large white hands to much advantage , as Rosamond thought . "
118439	118440	118441	118441	You	278	" "
118452	118480	118450	118450	you	278	" said Rosamond , keeping her amusement duly moderate . Poor young Plymdale had lingered with admiration over this very engraving , and his spirit was stirred . "
118499	118512	118483	118497	a great many celebrated people writing in the ' Keepsake , ' at all events	2758	" he said , in a tone at once piqued and timid . "

118543	118554	118529	118529	I	0	" said Rosamond , looking at Lydgate with a smile . "
118567	118610	118564	118566	L. E. L.	474	" Rosamond herself was not without relish for these writers , but she did not readily commit herself by admiration , and was alive to the slightest hint that anything was not , according to Lydgate , in the very highest taste . "
118623	118635	118618	118619	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said young Plymdale , a little cheered by this advantage . "
118644	118657	118638	118638	I	0	" said Lydgate , shutting the book , and pushing it away . "
118689	118690	118679	118679	I	0	" "

118747	118763	118724	118725	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Lydgate , showing no smart ; but smiling with exasperating confidence at Rosamond . "
118780	118816	118773	118774	Miss Vincy	276	" Young Plymdale soon went to look at the whist - playing , thinking that Lydgate was one of the most conceited , unpleasant fellows it had ever been his ill - fortune to meet . "
118822	118829	118773	118774	Miss Vincy	276	" said Rosamond , inwardly delighted . "

118916	119921	118910	118910	I	0	" To Rosamond it seemed as if she and Lydgate were as good as engaged . That they were some time to be engaged had long been an idea in her mind ; and ideas , we know , tend to a more solid kind of existence , the necessary materials being at hand . It is true , Lydgate had the counter - idea of remaining unengaged ; but this was a mere negative , a shadow cast by other resolves which themselves were capable of shrinking . Circumstance was almost sure to be on the side of Rosamond 's idea , which had a shaping activity and looked through watchful blue eyes , whereas Lydgate 's lay blind and unconcerned as a jelly - fish which gets melted without knowing it . That evening when he went home , he looked at his phials to see how a process of maceration was going on , with undisturbed interest ; and he wrote out his daily notes with as much precision as usual . The reveries from which it was difficult for him to detach himself were ideal constructions of something else than Rosamond 's virtues , and the primitive tissue was still his fair unknown . Moreover , he was beginning to feel some zest for the growing though half - suppressed feud between him and the other medical men , which was likely to become more manifest , now that Bulstrode 's method of managing the new hospital was about to be declared ; and there were various inspiriting signs that his non - acceptance by some of Peacock 's patients might be counterbalanced by the impression he had produced in other quarters . Only a few days later , when he had happened to overtake Rosamond on the Lowick road and had got down from his horse to walk by her side until he had quite protected her from a passing drove , he had been stopped by a servant on horseback with a message calling him in to a house of some importance where Peacock had never attended ; and it was the second instance of this kind . The servant was Sir James Chettam 's , and the house was Lowick Manor . Mr. and Mrs. Casaubon , returning from their wedding journey , arrived at Lowick Manor in the middle of January . A light snow was falling as they descended at the door , and in the morning , when Dorothea passed from her dressing - room into the blue - green boudoir that we know of , she saw the long avenue of limes lifting their trunks from a white earth , and spreading white branches against the dun and motionless sky . The distant flat shrank in uniform whiteness and low - hanging uniformity of cloud . The very furniture in the room seemed to have shrunk since she saw it before : the stag in the tapestry looked more like a ghost in his ghostly blue - green world ; the volumes of polite literature in the bookcase looked more like immovable imitations of books . The bright fire of dry oak - boughs burning on the logs seemed an incongruous renewal of life and glow — like the figure of Dorothea herself as she entered carrying the red - leather cases containing the cameos for Celia . She was glowing from her morning toilet as only healthful youth can glow : there was gem - like brightness on her coiled hair and in her hazel eyes ; there was warm red life in her lips ; her throat had a breathing whiteness above the differing white of the fur which itself seemed to wind about her neck and cling down her blue - gray pelisse with a tenderness gathered from her own , a sentient commingled innocence which kept its loveliness against the crystalline purity of the outdoor snow . As she laid the cameo - cases on the table in the bow - window , she unconsciously kept her hands on them , immediately absorbed in looking out on the still , white enclosure which made her visible world . Mr. Casaubon , who had risen early complaining of palpitation , was in the library giving audience to his curate Mr. Tucker . By - and - by Celia would come in her quality of bridesmaid as well as sister , and through the next weeks there would be wedding visits received and given ; all in continuance of that transitional life understood to correspond with the excitement of bridal felicity , and keeping up the sense of busy ineffectiveness , as of a dream which the dreamer begins to suspect . The duties of her married life , contemplated as so great beforehand , seemed to be shrinking with the furniture and the white vapor - walled landscape . The clear heights where she expected to walk in full communion had become difficult to see even in her imagination ; the delicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had been shaken into uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment . When would the days begin of that active wifely devotion which was to strengthen her husband 's life and exalt her own ? Never perhaps , as she had preconceived them ; but somehow — still somehow . In this solemnly pledged union of her life , duty would present itself in some new form of inspiration and give a new meaning to wifely love . Meanwhile there was the snow and the low arch of dun vapor — there was the stifling oppression of that gentlewoman 's world , where everything was done for her and none asked for her aid — where the sense of connection with a manifold pregnant existence had to be kept up painfully as an inward vision , instead of coming from without in claims that would have shaped her energies . — "

119936	120474	118910	118910	I	0	" that had been her brief history since she had left off learning morning lessons and practising silly rhythms on the hated piano . Marriage , which was to bring guidance into worthy and imperative occupation , had not yet freed her from the gentlewoman 's oppressive liberty : it had not even filled her leisure with the ruminant joy of unchecked tenderness . Her blooming full - pulsed youth stood there in a moral imprisonment which made itself one with the chill , colourless , narrowed landscape , with the shrunken furniture , the never - read books , and the ghostly stag in a pale fantastic world that seemed to be vanishing from the daylight . In the first minutes when Dorothea looked out she felt nothing but the dreary oppression ; then came a keen remembrance , and turning away from the window she walked round the room . The ideas and hopes which were living in her mind when she first saw this room nearly three months before were present now only as memories : she judged them as we judge transient and departed things . All existence seemed to beat with a lower pulse than her own , and her religious faith was a solitary cry , the struggle out of a nightmare in which every object was withering and shrinking away from her . Each remembered thing in the room was disenchanted , was deadened as an unlit transparency , till her wandering gaze came to the group of miniatures , and there at last she saw something which had gathered new breath and meaning : it was the miniature of Mr. Casaubon 's aunt Julia , who had made the unfortunate marriage — of Will Ladislaw 's grandmother . Dorothea could fancy that it was alive now — the delicate woman 's face which yet had a headstrong look , a peculiarity difficult to interpret . Was it only her friends who thought her marriage unfortunate ? or did she herself find it out to be a mistake , and taste the salt bitterness of her tears in the merciful silence of the night ? What breadths of experience Dorothea seemed to have passed over since she first looked at this miniature ! She felt a new companionship with it , as if it had an ear for her and could see how she was looking at it . Here was a woman who had known some difficulty about marriage . Nay , the colours deepened , the lips and chin seemed to get larger , the hair and eyes seemed to be sending out light , the face was masculine and beamed on her with that full gaze which tells her on whom it falls that she is too interesting for the slightest movement of her eyelid to pass unnoticed and uninterpreted . The vivid presentation came like a pleasant glow to Dorothea : she felt herself smiling , and turning from the miniature sat down and looked up as if she were again talking to a figure in front of her . But the smile disappeared as she went on meditating , and at last she said aloud — "
120490	120594	120673	120673	I	0	" She rose quickly and went out of the room , hurrying along the corridor , with the irresistible impulse to go and see her husband and inquire if she could do anything for him . Perhaps Mr. Tucker was gone and Mr. Casaubon was alone in the library . She felt as if all her morning 's gloom would vanish if she could see her husband glad because of her presence . But when she reached the head of the dark oak there was Celia coming up , and below there was Mr. Brooke , exchanging welcomes and congratulations with Mr. Casaubon . "
120597	120644	120673	120673	I	0	" said Celia , in her quiet staccato ; then kissed her sister , whose arms encircled her , and said no more . I think they both cried a little in a furtive manner , while Dorothea ran down - stairs to greet her uncle . "

120860	120869	120810	120810	you	2763	" said Mr. Brooke , observing her expression . "

121095	121116	121088	121088	you	169	" said Dorothea , quietly . No one would ever know what she thought of a wedding journey to Rome . "

121532	122357	121520	121520	My	0	"—GOLDSMITH . One morning , some weeks after her arrival at Lowick , Dorothea — but why always Dorothea ? Was her point of view the only possible one with regard to this marriage ? I protest against all our interest , all our effort at understanding being given to the young skins that look blooming in spite of trouble ; for these too will get faded , and will know the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect . In spite of the blinking eyes and white moles objectionable to Celia , and the want of muscular curve which was morally painful to Sir James , Mr. Casaubon had an intense consciousness within him , and was spiritually a - hungered like the rest of us . He had done nothing exceptional in marrying — nothing but what society sanctions , and considers an occasion for wreaths and bouquets . It had occurred to him that he must not any longer defer his intention of matrimony , and he had reflected that in taking a wife , a man of good position should expect and carefully choose a blooming young lady — the younger the better , because more educable and submissive — of a rank equal to his own , of religious principles , virtuous disposition , and good understanding . On such a young lady he would make handsome settlements , and he would neglect no arrangement for her happiness : in return , he should receive family pleasures and leave behind him that copy of himself which seemed so urgently required of a man — to the sonneteers of the sixteenth century . Times had altered since then , and no sonneteer had insisted on Mr. Casaubon 's leaving a copy of himself ; moreover , he had not yet succeeded in issuing copies of his mythological key ; but he had always intended to acquit himself by marriage , and the sense that he was fast leaving the years behind him , that the world was getting dimmer and that he felt lonely , was a reason to him for losing no more time in overtaking domestic delights before they too were left behind by the years . And when he had seen Dorothea he believed that he had found even more than he demanded : she might really be such a helpmate to him as would enable him to dispense with a hired secretary , an aid which Mr. Casaubon had never yet employed and had a suspicious dread of . ( Mr. Casaubon was nervously conscious that he was expected to manifest a powerful mind . ) Providence , in its kindness , had supplied him with the wife he needed . A wife , a modest young lady , with the purely appreciative , unambitious abilities of her sex , is sure to think her husband 's mind powerful . Whether Providence had taken equal care of Miss Brooke in presenting her with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could hardly occur to him . Society never made the preposterous demand that a man should think as much about his own qualifications for making a charming girl happy as he thinks of hers for making himself happy . As if a man could choose not only his wife but his wife 's husband ! Or as if he were bound to provide charms for his posterity in his own person ! — When Dorothea accepted him with effusion , that was only natural ; and Mr. Casaubon believed that his happiness was going to begin . He had not had much foretaste of happiness in his previous life . To know intense joy without a strong bodily frame , one must have an enthusiastic soul . Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame , and his soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic : it was too languid to thrill out of self - consciousness into passionate delight ; it went on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched , thinking of its wings and never flying . His experience was of that pitiable kind which shrinks from pity , and fears most of all that it should be known : it was that proud narrow sensitiveness which has not mass enough to spare for transformation into sympathy , and quivers thread - like in small currents of self - preoccupation or at best of an egoistic scrupulosity . And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples : he was capable of a severe self - restraint ; he was resolute in being a man of honour according to the code ; he would be unimpeachable by any recognized opinion . In conduct these ends had been attained ; but the difficulty of making his Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead upon his mind ; and the pamphlets — or "
122359	123221	123222	123222	Dorothea	189	" as he called them — by which he tested his public and deposited small monumental records of his march , were far from having been seen in all their significance . He suspected the Archdeacon of not having read them ; he was in painful doubt as to what was really thought of them by the leading minds of Brasenose , and bitterly convinced that his old acquaintance Carp had been the writer of that depreciatory recension which was kept locked in a small drawer of Mr. Casaubon 's desk , and also in a dark closet of his verbal memory . These were heavy impressions to struggle against , and brought that melancholy embitterment which is the consequence of all excessive claim : even his religious faith wavered with his wavering trust in his own authorship , and the consolations of the Christian hope in immortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still unwritten Key to all Mythologies . For my part I am very sorry for him . It is an uneasy lot at best , to be what we call highly taught and yet not to enjoy : to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering self — never to be fully possessed by the glory we behold , never to have our consciousness rapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought , the ardor of a passion , the energy of an action , but always to be scholarly and uninspired , ambitious and timid , scrupulous and dim - sighted . Becoming a dean or even a bishop would make little difference , I fear , to Mr. Casaubon 's uneasiness . Doubtless some ancient Greek has observed that behind the big mask and the speaking - trumpet , there must always be our poor little eyes peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less under anxious control . To this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before , to sensibilities thus fenced in , Mr. Casaubon had thought of annexing happiness with a lovely young bride ; but even before marriage , as we have seen , he found himself under a new depression in the consciousness that the new bliss was not blissful to him . Inclination yearned back to its old , easier custom . And the deeper he went in domesticity the more did the sense of acquitting himself and acting with propriety predominate over any other satisfaction . Marriage , like religion and erudition , nay , like authorship itself , was fated to become an outward requirement , and Edward Casaubon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably all requirements . Even drawing Dorothea into use in his study , according to his own intention before marriage , was an effort which he was always tempted to defer , and but for her pleading insistence it might never have begun . But she had succeeded in making it a matter of course that she should take her place at an early hour in the library and have work either of reading aloud or copying assigned her . The work had been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had adopted an immediate intention : there was to be a new Parergon , a small monograph on some lately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries whereby certain assertions of Warburton 's could be corrected . References were extensive even here , but not altogether shoreless ; and sentences were actually to be written in the shape wherein they would be scanned by Brasenose and a less formidable posterity . These minor monumental productions were always exciting to Mr. Casaubon ; digestion was made difficult by the interference of citations , or by the rivalry of dialectical phrases ringing against each other in his brain . And from the first there was to be a Latin dedication about which everything was uncertain except that it was not to be addressed to Carp : it was a poisonous regret to Mr. Casaubon that he had once addressed a dedication to Carp in which he had numbered that member of the animal kingdom among the viros nullo aevo perituros , a mistake which would infallibly lay the dedicator open to ridicule in the next age , and might even be chuckled over by Pike and Tench in the present . Thus Mr. Casaubon was in one of his busiest epochs , and as I began to say a little while ago , Dorothea joined him early in the library where he had breakfasted alone . Celia at this time was on a second visit to Lowick , probably the last before her marriage , and was in the drawing - room expecting Sir James . Dorothea had learned to read the signs of her husband 's mood , and she saw that the morning had become more foggy there during the last hour . She was going silently to her desk when he said , in that distant tone which implied that he was discharging a disagreeable duty — "
123240	123257	123258	123259	Mr. Ladislaw	261	" It was a letter of two pages , and she immediately looked at the signature . "
123270	123281	123263	123263	he	261	" she exclaimed , in a tone of pleased surprise . "
123284	123293	123298	123298	he	261	" she added , looking at Mr. Casaubon , "
123305	123306	123298	123298	he	261	" "
123318	123337	123311	123311	you	189	" said Mr. Casaubon , severely pointing to it with his pen , and not looking at her . "
123395	123532	123533	123536	new - born babe	2785	" There had been no clashing of temper between Dorothea and her husband since that little explosion in Rome , which had left such strong traces in her mind that it had been easier ever since to quell emotion than to incur the consequence of venting it . But this ill - tempered anticipation that she could desire visits which might be disagreeable to her husband , this gratuitous defence of himself against selfish complaint on her part , was too sharp a sting to be meditated on until after it had been resented . Dorothea had thought that she could have been patient with John Milton , but she had never imagined him behaving in this way ; and for a moment Mr. Casaubon seemed to be stupidly undiscerning and odiously unjust . Pity , that "
123537	123555	123610	123610	You	2786	" which was by - and - by to rule many a storm within her , did not "
123559	123594	123597	123597	you	2786	" on this occasion . With her first words , uttered in a tone that shook him , she startled Mr. Casaubon into looking at her , and meeting the flash of her eyes . "
123640	123641	123642	123642	Dorothea	189	" "
123648	123684	123644	123644	you	189	" answered Mr. Casaubon , nervously . Decidedly , this woman was too young to be on the formidable level of wifehood — unless she had been pale and featureless and taken everything for granted . "
123702	123733	123689	123689	you	2786	" said Dorothea , in the same tone . The fire was not dissipated yet , and she thought it was ignoble in her husband not to apologize to her . "
123762	124040	123750	123750	I	0	" Here Mr. Casaubon dipped his pen and made as if he would return to his writing , though his hand trembled so much that the words seemed to be written in an unknown character . There are answers which , in turning away wrath , only send it to the other end of the room , and to have a discussion coolly waived when you feel that justice is all on your own side is even more exasperating in marriage than in philosophy . Dorothea left Ladislaw 's two letters unread on her husband 's writing - table and went to her own place , the scorn and indignation within her rejecting the reading of these letters , just as we hurl away any trash towards which we seem to have been suspected of mean cupidity . She did not in the least divine the subtle sources of her husband 's bad temper about these letters : she only knew that they had caused him to offend her . She began to work at once , and her hand did not tremble ; on the contrary , in writing out the quotations which had been given to her the day before , she felt that she was forming her letters beautifully , and it seemed to her that she saw the construction of the Latin she was copying , and which she was beginning to understand , more clearly than usual . In her indignation there was a sense of superiority , but it went out for the present in firmness of stroke , and did not compress itself into an inward articulate voice pronouncing the once "
124043	124145	124147	124147	you	2788	" a poor creature . There had been this apparent quiet for half an hour , and Dorothea had not looked away from her own table , when she heard the loud bang of a book on the floor , and turning quickly saw Mr. Casaubon on the library steps clinging forward as if he were in some bodily distress . She started up and bounded towards him in an instant : he was evidently in great straits for breath . Jumping on a stool she got close to his elbow and said with her whole soul melted into tender alarm — "
124154	124265	124147	124147	you	2788	" He was still for two or three minutes , which seemed endless to her , unable to speak or move , gasping for breath . When at last he descended the three steps and fell backward in the large chair which Dorothea had drawn close to the foot of the ladder , he no longer gasped but seemed helpless and about to faint . Dorothea rang the bell violently , and presently Mr. Casaubon was helped to the couch : he did not faint , and was gradually reviving , when Sir James Chettam came in , having been met in the hall with the news that Mr. Casaubon had "
124273	124274	124147	124147	you	2788	" "
124287	124308	124276	124276	God	274	" was his immediate thought . If his prophetic soul had been urged to particularize , it seemed to him that "
124310	124415	124416	124416	I	0	" would have been the definite expression alighted upon . He asked his informant , the butler , whether the doctor had been sent for . The butler never knew his master to want the doctor before ; but would it not be right to send for a physician ? When Sir James entered the library , however , Mr. Casaubon could make some signs of his usual politeness , and Dorothea , who in the reaction from her first terror had been kneeling and sobbing by his side now rose and herself proposed that some one should ride off for a medical man . "
124424	124429	124416	124416	I	0	" said Sir James . "
124460	124560	124445	124445	She	7333	" Dorothea appealed to her husband , and he made a silent sign of approval . So Mr. Lydgate was sent for and he came wonderfully soon , for the messenger , who was Sir James Chettam 's man and knew Mr. Lydgate , met him leading his horse along the Lowick road and giving his arm to Miss Vincy . Celia , in the drawing - room , had known nothing of the trouble till Sir James told her of it . After Dorothea 's account , he no longer considered the illness a fit , but still something "
124565	124566	124445	124445	She	7333	" "
124574	124612	124569	124569	Dodo	184	" said Celia , feeling as much grieved as her own perfect happiness would allow . Her little hands were clasped , and enclosed by Sir James 's as a bud is enfolded by a liberal calyx . "
124667	124668	124662	124662	you	2796	" "
124680	124685	124669	124669	I	0	" said Sir James . "
124706	124707	124702	124702	she	184	" "
124714	124769	124708	124708	She	184	" said the loyal - hearted Sir James . He had just had a fresh impression of this kind , as he had seen Dorothea stretching her tender arm under her husband 's neck and looking at him with unspeakable sorrow . He did not know how much penitence there was in the sorrow . "
124772	124798	124708	124708	She	184	" said Celia , thinking it was very well for Sir James to say so , but he would not have been comfortable with Dodo . "
124814	124815	124811	124811	you	0	" "
124834	124841	124816	124816	I	0	" said Sir James , magnanimously . "
124848	125182	124816	124816	I	0	" While Celia was gone he walked up and down remembering what he had originally felt about Dorothea 's engagement , and feeling a revival of his disgust at Mr. Brooke 's indifference . If Cadwallader — if every one else had regarded the affair as he , Sir James , had done , the marriage might have been hindered . It was wicked to let a young girl blindly decide her fate in that way , without any effort to save her . Sir James had long ceased to have any regrets on his own account : his heart was satisfied with his engagement to Celia . But he had a chivalrous nature ( was not the disinterested service of woman among the ideal glories of old chivalry ? ): his disregarded love had not turned to bitterness ; its death had made sweet odors — floating memories that clung with a consecrating effect to Dorothea . He could remain her brotherly friend , interpreting her actions with generous trustfulness . Mr. Casaubon had no second attack of equal severity with the first , and in a few days began to recover his usual condition . But Lydgate seemed to think the case worth a great deal of attention . He not only used his stethoscope ( which had not become a matter of course in practice at that time ) , but sat quietly by his patient and watched him . To Mr. Casaubon 's questions about himself , he replied that the source of the illness was the common error of intellectual men — a too eager and monotonous application : the remedy was , to be satisfied with moderate work , and to seek variety of relaxation . Mr. Brooke , who sat by on one occasion , suggested that Mr. Casaubon should go fishing , as Cadwallader did , and have a turning - room , make toys , table - legs , and that kind of thing . "
125198	125208	125186	125186	you	2800	" said poor Mr. Casaubon , with some bitterness . "
125212	125220	125186	125186	you	2800	" he added , looking at Lydgate , "
125240	125241	125242	125242	I	0	" "
125245	125251	125242	125242	I	0	" said Lydgate , smiling , "
125292	125293	125272	125272	I	0	" "
125298	125303	125272	125272	I	0	" said Mr. Brooke . "
125465	125466	125424	125424	they	2804	" "
125473	125510	125424	125424	they	2804	" would have been an answer to represent Mr. Casaubon 's feelings . But he only bowed resignedly , with due respect to his wife 's uncle , and observed that doubtless the works he mentioned had "
125522	125523	125524	125524	You	2800	" "
125527	125542	125524	125524	You	2800	" said the able magistrate to Lydgate , when they were outside the door , "
125676	125967	125968	125968	You	2812	" Without Mr. Brooke 's advice , Lydgate had determined on speaking to Dorothea . She had not been present while her uncle was throwing out his pleasant suggestions as to the mode in which life at Lowick might be enlivened , but she was usually by her husband 's side , and the unaffected signs of intense anxiety in her face and voice about whatever touched his mind or health , made a drama which Lydgate was inclined to watch . He said to himself that he was only doing right in telling her the truth about her husband 's probable future , but he certainly thought also that it would be interesting to talk confidentially with her . A medical man likes to make psychological observations , and sometimes in the pursuit of such studies is too easily tempted into momentous prophecy which life and death easily set at nought . Lydgate had often been satirical on this gratuitous prediction , and he meant now to be guarded . He asked for Mrs. Casaubon , but being told that she was out walking , he was going away , when Dorothea and Celia appeared , both glowing from their struggle with the March wind . When Lydgate begged to speak with her alone , Dorothea opened the library door which happened to be the nearest , thinking of nothing at the moment but what he might have to say about Mr. Casaubon . It was the first time she had entered this room since her husband had been taken ill , and the servant had chosen not to open the shutters . But there was light enough to read by from the narrow upper panes of the windows . "
125976	125988	125968	125968	You	2812	" said Dorothea , standing in the middle of the room . "
126021	126022	126016	126016	he	189	" "
126048	126049	126050	126050	You	2812	" "
126060	126076	126050	126050	You	2812	" said Dorothea , whose quick ear had detected some significance in Lydgate 's tone . "
126086	126090	126050	126050	You	2812	" said Lydgate . "
126127	126128	126129	126129	I	0	" "
126137	126146	126131	126131	you	2812	" said Dorothea , in an imploring tone . "
126180	126208	126248	126248	you	0	" The words came out like a cry : it was evident that they were the voice of some mental experience which lay not very far off . "
126212	126246	126248	126248	you	0	" she added , placing herself on the nearest chair , and throwing off her bonnet and gloves , with an instinctive discarding of formality where a great question of destiny was concerned . "
126256	126260	126248	126248	you	0	" said Lydgate . "
126330	126348	126349	126349	You	0	" Dorothea had turned very pale , and when Lydgate paused she said in a low voice , "
126357	126358	126352	126352	we	2817	" "
126374	126375	126376	126376	He	189	" "
126390	126402	126403	126403	I	0	" said Dorothea , with a quick prevision of that wretchedness . "
126510	126558	126591	126591	you	0	" There was silence for a few moments , while Dorothea sat as if she had been turned to marble , though the life within her was so intense that her mind had never before swept in brief time over an equal range of scenes and motives . "
126564	126579	126591	126591	you	0	" she said , at last , in the same low voice as before . "
126587	126588	126591	126591	you	0	" "
126607	126629	126604	126604	I	0	" The memories which made this resource utterly hopeless were a new current that shook Dorothea out of her pallid immobility . "
126644	126659	126604	126604	I	0	" she said with a more childlike despondency , while the tears rolled down . "
126672	126673	126674	126674	I	0	" "
126685	126709	126677	126677	I	0	" said Lydgate , deeply touched , yet wondering about her marriage . Women just like Dorothea had not entered into his traditions . "
126728	126729	126719	126719	I	0	" "
126785	126844	126849	126851	a wise man	6903	" Lydgate rose , and Dorothea mechanically rose at the same time , unclasping her cloak and throwing it off as if it stifled her . He was bowing and quitting her , when an impulse which if she had been alone would have turned into a prayer , made her say with a sob in her voice — "
126899	127271	126893	126893	I	0	" For years after Lydgate remembered the impression produced in him by this involuntary appeal — this cry from soul to soul , without other consciousness than their moving with kindred natures in the same embroiled medium , the same troublous fitfully illuminated life . But what could he say now except that he should see Mr. Casaubon again to - morrow ? When he was gone , Dorothea 's tears gushed forth , and relieved her stifling oppression . Then she dried her eyes , reminded that her distress must not be betrayed to her husband ; and looked round the room thinking that she must order the servant to attend to it as usual , since Mr. Casaubon might now at any moment wish to enter . On his writing - table there were letters which had lain untouched since the morning when he was taken ill , and among them , as Dorothea well remembered , there were young Ladislaw 's letters , the one addressed to her still unopened . The associations of these letters had been made the more painful by that sudden attack of illness which she felt that the agitation caused by her anger might have helped to bring on : it would be time enough to read them when they were again thrust upon her , and she had had no inclination to fetch them from the library . But now it occurred to her that they should be put out of her husband 's sight : whatever might have been the sources of his annoyance about them , he must , if possible , not be annoyed again ; and she ran her eyes first over the letter addressed to him to assure herself whether or not it would be necessary to write in order to hinder the offensive visit . Will wrote from Rome , and began by saying that his obligations to Mr. Casaubon were too deep for all thanks not to seem impertinent . It was plain that if he were not grateful , he must be the poorest - spirited rascal who had ever found a generous friend . To expand in wordy thanks would be like saying , "
127276	127406	127272	127272	I	0	" But Will had come to perceive that his defects — defects which Mr. Casaubon had himself often pointed to — needed for their correction that more strenuous position which his relative 's generosity had hitherto prevented from being inevitable . He trusted that he should make the best return , if return were possible , by showing the effectiveness of the education for which he was indebted , and by ceasing in future to need any diversion towards himself of funds on which others might have a better claim . He was coming to England , to try his fortune , as many other young men were obliged to do whose only capital was in their brains . His friend Naumann had desired him to take charge of the "
127407	127645	127659	127663	a very clever young fellow	2821	Dispute"—the picture painted for Mr. Casaubon , with whose permission , and Mrs. Casaubon 's , Will would convey it to Lowick in person . A letter addressed to the Poste Restante in Paris within the fortnight would hinder him , if necessary , from arriving at an inconvenient moment . He enclosed a letter to Mrs. Casaubon in which he continued a discussion about art , begun with her in Rome . Opening her own letter Dorothea saw that it was a lively continuation of his remonstrance with her fanatical sympathy and her want of sturdy neutral delight in things as they were — an outpouring of his young vivacity which it was impossible to read just now . She had immediately to consider what was to be done about the other letter : there was still time perhaps to prevent Will from coming to Lowick . Dorothea ended by giving the letter to her uncle , who was still in the house , and begging him to let Will know that Mr. Casaubon had been ill , and that his health would not allow the reception of any visitors . No one more ready than Mr. Brooke to write a letter : his only difficulty was to write a short one , and his ideas in this case expanded over the three large pages and the inward foldings . He had simply said to Dorothea — "
127703	127933	127696	127696	I	0	" But the end of Mr. Brooke 's pen was a thinking organ , evolving sentences , especially of a benevolent kind , before the rest of his mind could well overtake them . It expressed regrets and proposed remedies , which , when Mr. Brooke read them , seemed felicitously worded — surprisingly the right thing , and determined a sequel which he had never before thought of . In this case , his pen found it such a pity young Ladislaw should not have come into the neighborhood just at that time , in order that Mr. Brooke might make his acquaintance more fully , and that they might go over the long - neglected Italian drawings together — it also felt such an interest in a young man who was starting in life with a stock of ideas — that by the end of the second page it had persuaded Mr. Brooke to invite young Ladislaw , since he could not be received at Lowick , to come to Tipton Grange . Why not ? They could find a great many things to do together , and this was a period of peculiar growth — the political horizon was expanding , and — in short , Mr. Brooke 's pen went off into a little speech which it had lately reported for that imperfectly edited organ the "
127937	127965	127696	127696	I	0	" While Mr. Brooke was sealing this letter , he felt elated with an influx of dim projects:—a young man capable of putting ideas into form , the "
127967	128090	128093	128093	she	2824	" purchased to clear the pathway for a new candidate , documents utilized — who knew what might come of it all ? Since Celia was going to marry immediately , it would be very pleasant to have a young fellow at table with him , at least for a time . But he went away without telling Dorothea what he had put into the letter , for she was engaged with her husband , and — in fact , these things were of no importance to her . Lydgate that evening spoke to Miss Vincy of Mrs. Casaubon , and laid some emphasis on the strong feeling she appeared to have for that formal studious man thirty years older than herself . "
128100	128152	128093	128093	she	2824	" said Rosamond , implying a notion of necessary sequence which the scientific man regarded as the prettiest possible for a woman ; but she was thinking at the same time that it was not so very melancholy to be mistress of Lowick Manor with a husband likely to die soon . "
128160	128161	128154	128154	you	963	" "
128175	128179	128168	128168	I	0	" said Lydgate . "
128187	128193	128180	128180	I	0	" said Rosamond , dimpling . "
128219	128220	128216	128217	the Casaubons	432	" "
128223	128234	128216	128217	the Casaubons	432	" said Lydgate , in a tone of compulsory admission . "
128271	128272	128257	128257	one	870	" "
128279	128283	128257	128257	one	870	" said Rosamond . "
128302	128303	128688	128688	you	2830	" "
128312	128403	128688	128688	you	2830	" said Lydgate , just bending his head to the table and lifting with his fourth finger her delicate handkerchief which lay at the mouth of her reticule , as if to enjoy its scent , while he looked at her with a smile . But this agreeable holiday freedom with which Lydgate hovered about the flower of Middlemarch , could not continue indefinitely . It was not more possible to find social isolation in that town than elsewhere , and two people persistently flirting could by no means escape from "
128423	128685	128688	128688	you	2830	" Whatever Miss Vincy did must be remarked , and she was perhaps the more conspicuous to admirers and critics because just now Mrs. Vincy , after some struggle , had gone with Fred to stay a little while at Stone Court , there being no other way of at once gratifying old Featherstone and keeping watch against Mary Garth , who appeared a less tolerable daughter - in - law in proportion as Fred 's illness disappeared . Aunt Bulstrode , for example , came a little oftener into Lowick Gate to see Rosamond , now she was alone . For Mrs. Bulstrode had a true sisterly feeling for her brother ; always thinking that he might have married better , but wishing well to the children . Now Mrs. Bulstrode had a long - standing intimacy with Mrs. Plymdale . They had nearly the same preferences in silks , patterns for underclothing , china - ware , and clergymen ; they confided their little troubles of health and household management to each other , and various little points of superiority on Mrs. Bulstrode 's side , namely , more decided seriousness , more admiration for mind , and a house outside the town , sometimes served to give colour to their conversation without dividing them — well - meaning women both , knowing very little of their own motives . Mrs. Bulstrode , paying a morning visit to Mrs. Plymdale , happened to say that she could not stay longer , because she was going to see poor Rosamond . "
128695	128713	128688	128688	you	2830	" said Mrs. Plymdale , a round - eyed sharp little woman , like a tamed falcon . "
128749	128750	128728	128729	The mother	7649	" "
128763	128771	128753	128753	Harriet	338	" said Mrs. Plymdale , with emphasis , "
128802	128803	128792	128792	you	338	" "
128811	128820	128808	128808	you	494	" said Mrs. Bulstrode , in genuine surprise . "

128914	128927	128912	128912	Selina	494	" said Mrs. Bulstrode , with a little emphasis in her turn . "
128958	128967	128953	128953	strangers	7527	" she added , after a slight pause , "
128973	128974	128975	128975	I	0	" "
128992	128993	128989	128990	a mother	2205	" "

129034	129048	129026	129026	I	0	" said Mrs. Plymdale , who had never before given all her confidence to "
129050	129055	129049	129049	Harriet	338	" on this subject . "
129104	129105	129106	129106	You	2852	" "
129120	129134	129117	129118	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Mrs. Bulstrode , rather mortified at finding out her own ignorance . "
129145	129146	129143	129143	Harriet	338	" "
129188	129189	129180	129180	Your	2852	" "

129307	129394	129299	129299	I	0	" After this Mrs. Bulstrode drove to her niece with a mind newly weighted . She was herself handsomely dressed , but she noticed with a little more regret than usual that Rosamond , who was just come in and met her in walking - dress , was almost as expensively equipped . Mrs. Bulstrode was a feminine smaller edition of her brother , and had none of her husband 's low - toned pallor . She had a good honest glance and used no circumlocution . "
129405	129490	129399	129399	I	0	" she said , as they entered the drawing - room together , looking round gravely . Rosamond felt sure that her aunt had something particular to say , and they sat down near each other . Nevertheless , the quilling inside Rosamond 's bonnet was so charming that it was impossible not to desire the same kind of thing for Kate , and Mrs. Bulstrode 's eyes , which were rather fine , rolled round that ample quilled circuit , while she spoke . "
129507	129508	129505	129505	Rosamond	283	" "
129515	129530	129513	129513	aunt	8094	" Rosamond 's eyes also were roaming over her aunt 's large embroidered collar . "
129554	129573	129513	129513	aunt	8094	" Here Mrs. Bulstrode 's eyes finally rested on Rosamond 's , who blushed deeply , and said — "
129581	129582	129579	129579	aunt	8094	" "
129602	129603	129587	129588	every one	6847	" "
129617	129624	129614	129614	I	0	" said Rosamond , inwardly gratified . "
129756	129773	129746	129746	you	2861	" Mr. Lydgate is not a poor man , aunt . He has very high connections . "
129774	129783	129818	129818	Rosamond	283	" He told me himself he was poor . "
129784	129801	129746	129746	you	2861	" That is because he is used to people who have a high style of living . "
129802	129817	129746	129746	you	2861	" My dear Rosamond , you must not think of living in high style . "
129849	129856	129858	129859	Mrs. Bulstrode	312	" Then it is really true ? "
129868	129906	129858	129859	Mrs. Bulstrode	312	" You are thinking of Mr. Lydgate — there is some understanding between you , though your father does n't know . Be open , my dear Rosamond : Mr. Lydgate has really made you an offer ? "
129960	129976	129946	129946	Her	283	" Pray excuse me , aunt . I would rather not speak on the subject . "
129977	130105	130150	130152	a romantic heroine	2879	" You would not give your heart to a man without a decided prospect , I trust , my dear . And think of the two excellent offers I know of that you have refused!—and one still within your reach , if you will not throw it away . I knew a very great beauty who married badly at last , by doing so . Mr. Ned Plymdale is a nice young man — some might think good - looking ; and an only son ; and a large business of that kind is better than a profession . Not that marrying is everything . I would have you seek first the kingdom of God . But a girl should keep her heart within her own power . "
130106	130140	130142	130142	Rosamond	283	" I should never give it to Mr. Ned Plymdale , if it were . I have already refused him . If I loved , I should love at once and without change , "
130160	130170	130172	130173	Mrs. Bulstrode	312	" I see how it is , my dear , "
130184	130196	130172	130173	Mrs. Bulstrode	312	" You have allowed your affections to be engaged without return . "
130197	130204	130206	130206	Rosamond	283	" No , indeed , aunt , "
130211	130227	130206	130206	Rosamond	283	" Then you are quite confident that Mr. Lydgate has a serious attachment to you ? "
130449	130464	130466	130467	Mrs. Bulstrode	312	" Especially when she has great attractions , and her parents see much company , "
130469	130516	130466	130467	Mrs. Bulstrode	312	" Gentlemen pay her attention , and engross her all to themselves , for the mere pleasure of the moment , and that drives off others . I think it is a heavy responsibility , Mr. Lydgate , to interfere with the prospects of any girl . "
130538	130541	130543	130543	Lydgate	278	" Clearly , "
130557	130603	130543	130543	Lydgate	278	" On the other hand , a man must be a great coxcomb to go about with a notion that he must not pay attention to a young lady lest she should fall in love with him , or lest others should think she must . "
130604	130664	130665	130665	Lydgate	278	" Oh , Mr. Lydgate , you know well what your advantages are . You know that our young men here can not cope with you . Where you frequent a house it may militate very much against a girl 's making a desirable settlement in life , and prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made . "
130711	130713	130692	130692	she	312	" militate "

130918	130942	130915	130916	the Vicar	8024	" Well , if you do n't mean to be won by the sirens , you are right to take precautions in time . "

134739	134756	134758	134758	Peter	315	" Yes , I shall take my own time — you need n't offer me yours , "
134760	134775	134781	134781	her	304	" But you ca n't take your own time to die in , Brother , "
134786	134810	134781	134781	her	304	" And when you lie speechless you may be tired of having strangers about you , and you may think of me and my children"—but
134836	134843	134845	134846	old Featherstone	315	" No , I sha n't , "
134850	134876	134845	134846	old Featherstone	315	" I sha n't think of any of you . I 've made my will , I tell you , I 've made my will . "
134894	134911	134913	134914	Mrs. Waule	304	" Some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by rights to others , "
134925	134930	134932	134932	Solomon	311	" Oh , sister , "
134938	134966	134932	134932	Solomon	311	" you and me are not fine , and handsome , and clever enough : we must be humble and let smart people push themselves before us . "
134985	135006	134982	134982	he	315	" Shall my mother and I leave the room , sir , that you may be alone with your friends ? "
135007	135015	135017	135018	old Featherstone	292	" Sit down , I tell you , "
135022	135034	135035	135035	he	315	" Stop where you are . Good - by , Solomon , "
135055	135069	135035	135035	he	315	" Good - by , Mrs. Waule . Do n't you come again . "
135070	135084	135086	135086	Solomon	311	" I shall be down - stairs , Brother , whether or no , "
135088	135107	135086	135086	Solomon	311	" I shall do my duty , and it remains to be seen what the Almighty will allow . "
135108	135118	135120	135121	Mrs. Waule	304	" Yes , in property going out of families , "
135124	135157	135120	135121	Mrs. Waule	304	continuation,—"and where there 's steady young men to carry on . But I pity them who are not such , and I pity their mothers . Good - by , Brother Peter . "
135158	135192	135194	135194	Solomon	311	" Remember , I 'm the eldest after you , Brother , and prospered from the first , just as you did , and have got land already by the name of Featherstone , "
135215	135227	135194	135194	Solomon	311	" But I bid you good - by for the present . "
136125	136134	136179	136179	he	510	" the celebrated Peel , now Sir Robert , "
136148	136178	136179	136179	he	510	" I do n't mind if I have a slice of that ham , and a glass of that ale , Miss Garth , if you will allow me , "
136217	136232	136212	136213	Mrs. Waule	304	" It 's not necessary for you to go out;—let me ring the bell . "
136233	136237	136239	136239	Mary	301	" Thank you , "
136241	136247	136239	136239	Mary	301	" I have an errand . "
136248	136259	136261	136262	Mrs. Waule	304	" Well , Mr. Trumbull , you 're highly favoured , "
136264	136272	136274	136275	the auctioneer	3054	" What ! seeing the old man ? "
136283	136295	136274	136275	the auctioneer	3054	" Ah , you see he has relied on me considerably . "
136307	136318	136320	136320	Solomon	311	" Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying ? "
136351	136359	136361	136362	Mr. Trumbull	510	" Oh yes , anybody may ask , "
136374	136389	136390	136390	he	510	" Anybody may interrogate . Any one may give their remarks an interrogative turn , "
136400	136437	136390	136390	he	510	" This is constantly done by good speakers , even when they anticipate no answer . It is what we call a figure of speech — speech at a high figure , as one may say . "
136447	136463	136465	136465	Solomon	311	" I should n't be sorry to hear he 'd remembered you , Mr. Trumbull , "
136467	136483	136465	136465	Solomon	311	" I never was against the deserving . It 's the undeserving I 'm against . "
136484	136498	136500	136501	Mr. Trumbull	510	" Ah , there it is , you see , there it is , "
136505	136531	136500	136501	Mr. Trumbull	510	" It ca n't be denied that undeserving people have been legatees , and even residuary legatees . It is so , with testamentary dispositions . "
136543	136567	136569	136570	Mrs. Waule	304	" Do you mean to say for certain , Mr. Trumbull , that my brother has left his land away from our family ? "
136588	136609	136611	136611	Solomon	311	" A man might as well turn his land into charity land at once as leave it to some people , "
136622	136630	136632	136633	Mrs. Waule	304	" What , Blue - Coat land ? "
136637	136666	136632	136633	Mrs. Waule	304	" Oh , Mr. Trumbull , you never can mean to say that . It would be flying in the face of the Almighty that 's prospered him . "
136743	136768	136774	136774	he	510	" ' Anne of Geierstein ' ( pronounced Jeersteen ) or the ' Maiden of the Mist , by the author of Waverley . ' "
136776	136804	136805	136805	He	510	sonorously—"The course of four centuries has well - nigh elapsed since the series of events which are related in the following chapters took place on the Continent . "
136926	136941	136942	136942	he	510	" I shall take a mere mouthful of ham and a glass of ale , "
136947	136969	136970	136970	he	510	" As a man with public business , I take a snack when I can . I will back this ham , "
136981	137012	136970	136970	he	510	" against any ham in the three kingdoms . In my opinion it is better than the hams at Freshitt Hall — and I think I am a tolerable judge . "
137013	137025	137027	137028	Mrs. Waule	304	" Some do n't like so much sugar in their hams , "
137030	137040	137027	137028	Mrs. Waule	304	" But my poor brother would always have sugar . "
137041	137085	137086	137087	Mr. Trumbull	510	" If any person demands better , he is at liberty to do so ; but , God bless me , what an aroma ! I should be glad to buy in that quality , I know . There is some gratification to a gentleman"—here
137093	137104	137105	137105	He	510	remonstrance—"in having this kind of ham set on his table . "
137163	137177	137178	137178	he	510	" You have an interesting work there , I see , Miss Garth , "
137187	137277	137178	137178	he	510	" It is by the author of ' Waverley ' : that is Sir Walter Scott . I have bought one of his works myself — a very nice thing , a very superior publication , entitled ' Ivanhoe . ' You will not get any writer to beat him in a hurry , I think — he will not , in my opinion , be speedily surpassed . I have just been reading a portion at the commencement of ' Anne of Jeersteen . ' It commences well . "
137301	137318	137178	137178	he	510	" You are a reader , I see . Do you subscribe to our Middlemarch library ? "
137319	137322	137324	137324	Mary	301	" No , "
137326	137334	137324	137324	Mary	301	" Mr. Fred Vincy brought this book . "
137335	137343	137345	137346	Mr. Trumbull	510	" I am a great bookman myself , "
137348	137402	137345	137346	Mr. Trumbull	510	" I have no less than two hundred volumes in calf , and I flatter myself they are well selected . Also pictures by Murillo , Rubens , Teniers , Titian , Vandyck , and others . I shall be happy to lend you any work you like to mention , Miss Garth . "
137403	137409	137411	137411	Mary	301	" I am much obliged , "
137417	137426	137411	137411	Mary	301	" but I have little time for reading . "
137427	137442	137444	137445	Mr. Solomon	521	" I should say my brother has done something for her in his will , "
137471	137484	137486	137487	Mrs. Waule	304	" His first wife was a poor match for him , though , "
137489	137515	137486	137487	Mrs. Waule	304	" She brought him nothing : and this young woman is only her niece,—and very proud . And my brother has always paid her wage . "
137516	137526	137528	137529	Mr. Trumbull	510	" A sensible girl though , in my opinion , "
137545	137703	137528	137529	Mr. Trumbull	510	" I have observed her when she has been mixing medicine in drops . She minds what she is doing , sir . That is a great point in a woman , and a great point for our friend up - stairs , poor dear old soul . A man whose life is of any value should think of his wife as a nurse : that is what I should do , if I married ; and I believe I have lived single long enough not to make a mistake in that line . Some men must marry to elevate themselves a little , but when I am in need of that , I hope some one will tell me so — I hope some individual will apprise me of the fact . I wish you good morning , Mrs. Waule . Good morning , Mr. Solomon . I trust we shall meet under less melancholy auspices . "
137724	137741	137714	137714	Solomon	521	" You may depend , Jane , my brother has left that girl a lumping sum . "
137742	137755	137757	137757	Jane	309	" Anybody would think so , from the way Mr. Trumbull talks , "
137765	137781	137714	137714	Solomon	521	" He talks as if my daughters was n't to be trusted to give drops . "
137782	137787	137789	137789	Solomon	521	" Auctioneers talk wild , "
137791	137800	137789	137789	Solomon	521	" Not but what Trumbull has made money . "
138513	138519	138506	138506	he	320	" Missy , come here ! "
138587	138597	138556	138556	He	320	" How many of 'em are in the house ? "
138598	138608	138610	138610	Mary	301	" You mean of your own relations , sir , "
138631	138642	138627	138627	she	301	" Mr. Jonah Featherstone and young Cranch are sleeping here . "
138643	138686	138556	138556	He	320	" Oh ay , they stick , do they ? and the rest — they come every day , I 'll warrant — Solomon and Jane , and all the young uns ? They come peeping , and counting and casting up ? "
138687	138711	138712	138714	The old man	1768	" Not all of them every day . Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule are here every day , and the others come often . "
138731	138816	138728	138728	his	1768	" The more fools they . You hearken , missy . It 's three o'clock in the morning , and I 've got all my faculties as well as ever I had in my life . I know all my property , and where the money 's put out , and everything . And I 've made everything ready to change my mind , and do as I like at the last . Do you hear , missy ? I 've got my faculties . "
138817	138822	138824	138824	Mary	301	" Well , sir ? "
138840	138932	138831	138831	his	1768	" I 've made two wills , and I 'm going to burn one . Now you do as I tell you . This is the key of my iron chest , in the closet there . You push well at the side of the brass plate at the top , till it goes like a bolt : then you can put the key in the front lock and turn it . See and do that ; and take out the topmost paper — Last Will and Testament — big printed . "
138933	138938	138940	138940	Mary	301	" No , sir , "
138947	138954	138940	138940	Mary	301	" I can not do that . "
138955	138967	138969	138971	the old man	1768	" Not do it ? I tell you , you must , "
138985	139011	138973	138973	his	1768	" I can not touch your iron chest or your will . I must refuse to do anything that might lay me open to suspicion . "
139012	139049	138940	138940	Mary	301	" I tell you , I 'm in my right mind . Sha n't I do as I like at the last ? I made two wills on purpose . Take the key , I say . "
139050	139059	139061	139061	Mary	301	" No , sir , I will not , "
139073	139085	139067	139067	Her	301	" I tell you , there 's no time to lose . "
139086	139121	139122	139122	She	301	" I can not help that , sir . I will not let the close of your life soil the beginning of mine . I will not touch your iron chest or your will . "
139176	139179	139180	139180	he	1768	" Missy , "
139187	139218	139219	139219	He	1768	" look here ! take the money — the notes and gold — look here — take it — you shall have it all — do as I tell you . "
139240	139275	139276	139276	He	1768	" I will not touch your key or your money , sir . Pray do n't ask me to do it again . If you do , I must go and call your brother . "
139313	139322	139300	139300	She	301	" Pray put up your money , sir ; "
139356	139371	139350	139350	he	1768	" Look here , then . Call the young chap . Call Fred Vincy . "
139410	139429	139399	139399	She	301	" I will call him , if you will let me call Mr. Jonah and others with him . "
139430	139448	139350	139350	he	1768	" Nobody else , I say . The young chap . I shall do as I like . "
139449	139487	139399	139399	She	301	" Wait till broad daylight , sir , when every one is stirring . Or let me call Simmons now , to go and fetch the lawyer ? He can be here in less than two hours . "
139488	139517	139399	139399	She	301	" Lawyer ? What do I want with the lawyer ? Nobody shall know — I say , nobody shall know . I shall do as I like . "
139518	139528	139530	139530	Mary	301	" Let me call some one else , sir , "
139585	139596	139573	139573	she	301	" Let me , pray , call some one else . "
139597	139654	139655	139655	Mary	301	" You let me alone , I say . Look here , missy . Take the money . You 'll never have the chance again . It 's pretty nigh two hundred — there 's more in the box , and nobody knows how much there was . Take it and do as I tell you . "
139742	139791	139801	139802	old Featherstone	292	" It is of no use , sir . I will not do it . Put up your money . I will not touch your money . I will do anything else I can to comfort you ; but I will not touch your keys or your money . "
139792	139799	139801	139802	old Featherstone	292	" Anything else — anything else ! "
139828	139842	139845	139845	him	1768	" I want nothing else . You come here — you come here . "
139897	139905	139906	139906	she	301	" Let me give you some cordial , "
139911	139938	139906	139906	she	301	" and try to compose yourself . You will perhaps go to sleep . And to - morrow by daylight you can do as you like . "
140468	140472	140473	140475	the old gentleman	7609	" big burying ; "
140488	140493	140473	140475	the old gentleman	7609	" beyond his betters . "
140687	140689	140673	140673	he	315	" bid "
141436	141447	141448	141448	Celia	169	" I will go anywhere with you , Mrs. Cadwallader , "
141452	141460	141448	141448	Celia	169	" but I do n't like funerals . "
141461	141531	141542	141545	the Dowager Lady Chettam	239	" Oh , my dear , when you have a clergyman in your family you must accommodate your tastes : I did that very early . When I married Humphrey I made up my mind to like sermons , and I set out by liking the end very much . That soon spread to the middle and the beginning , because I could n't have the end without them . "
141532	141540	141542	141545	the Dowager Lady Chettam	239	" No , to be sure not , "
141844	141852	141854	141854	Celia	169	" I shall not look any more , "
141885	141903	141875	141875	she	169	" I dare say Dodo likes it : she is fond of melancholy things and ugly people . "
141904	141918	141920	141920	Dorothea	189	" I am fond of knowing something about the people I live among , "
141938	141990	141920	141920	Dorothea	189	" It seems to me we know nothing of our neighbors , unless they are cottagers . One is constantly wondering what sort of lives other people lead , and how they take things . I am quite obliged to Mrs. Cadwallader for coming and calling me out of the library . "
141991	142000	142002	142003	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Quite right to feel obliged to me , "
142005	142060	142002	142003	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Your rich Lowick farmers are as curious as any buffaloes or bisons , and I dare say you do n't half see them at church . They are quite different from your uncle 's tenants or Sir James's — monsters — farmers without landlords — one ca n't tell how to class them . "
142061	142071	142073	142074	Sir James	177	" Most of these followers are not Lowick people , "
142076	142108	142073	142074	Sir James	177	" I suppose they are legatees from a distance , or from Middlemarch . Lovegood tells me the old fellow has left a good deal of money as well as land . "
142109	142128	142130	142131	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Think of that now ! when so many younger sons ca n't dine at their own expense , "
142133	142136	142130	142131	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Ah , "
142147	142179	142130	142131	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" here is Mr. Brooke . I felt that we were incomplete before , and here is the explanation . You are come to see this odd funeral , of course ? "
142180	142214	142216	142217	Mr. Brooke	175	" No , I came to look after Casaubon — to see how he goes on , you know . And to bring a little news — a little news , my dear , "
142228	142295	142223	142223	she	180	" I looked into the library , and I saw Casaubon over his books . I told him it would n't do : I said , ' This will never do , you know : think of your wife , Casaubon . ' And he promised me to come up . I did n't tell him my news : I said , he must come up . "
142296	142307	142308	142309	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Ah , now they are coming out of church , "
142312	142360	142308	142309	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Dear me , what a wonderfully mixed set ! Mr. Lydgate as doctor , I suppose . But that is really a good looking woman , and the fair young man must be her son . Who are they , Sir James , do you know ? "
142361	142379	142381	142382	Sir James	177	" I see Vincy , the Mayor of Middlemarch ; they are probably his wife and son , "
142395	142428	142387	142388	Mr. Brooke	175	" Yes , a very decent family — a very good fellow is Vincy ; a credit to the manufacturing interest . You have seen him at my house , you know . "
142429	142440	142442	142443	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Ah , yes : one of your secret committee , "
142447	142454	142456	142457	Sir James	177	" A coursing fellow , though , "
142467	142498	142500	142501	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" And one of those who suck the life out of the wretched handloom weavers in Tipton and Freshitt . That is how his family look so fair and sleek , "
142503	142547	142500	142501	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Those dark , purple - faced people are an excellent foil . Dear me , they are like a set of jugs ! Do look at Humphrey : one might fancy him an ugly archangel towering above them in his white surplice . "
142548	142560	142562	142563	Mr. Brooke	175	" It 's a solemn thing , though , a funeral , "
142565	142577	142562	142563	Mr. Brooke	175	" if you take it in that light , you know . "
142578	142621	142500	142501	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" But I am not taking it in that light . I ca n't wear my solemnity too often , else it will go to rags . It was time the old man died , and none of these people are sorry . "
142622	142626	142628	142628	Dorothea	189	" How piteous ! "
142630	142669	142628	142628	Dorothea	189	" This funeral seems to me the most dismal thing I ever saw . It is a blot on the morning . I can not bear to think that any one should die and leave no love behind . "
142717	142720	142722	142723	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Positively , "
142725	142772	142722	142723	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" there is a new face come out from behind that broad man queerer than any of them : a little round head with bulging eyes — a sort of frog - face — do look . He must be of another blood , I think . "
142773	142778	142780	142780	Celia	169	" Let me see ! "
142797	142805	142780	142780	Celia	169	" Oh , what an odd face ! "
142821	142837	142818	142818	she	169	" Why , Dodo , you never told me that Mr. Ladislaw was come again ! "
142867	142889	142891	142892	Mr. Brooke	175	" He came with me , you know ; he is my guest — puts up with me at the Grange , "
142915	143017	142895	142895	his	175	" And we have brought the picture at the top of the carriage . I knew you would be pleased with the surprise , Casaubon . There you are to the very life — as Aquinas , you know . Quite the right sort of thing . And you will hear young Ladislaw talk about it . He talks uncommonly well — points out this , that , and the other — knows art and everything of that kind — companionable , you know — is up with you in any track — what I 've been wanting a long while . "
143166	143172	143129	143130	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Who is Mr. Ladislaw ? "
143173	143182	143184	143185	Sir James	177	" A young relative of Mr. Casaubon 's , "
143225	143239	143241	143242	Mr. Brooke	175	" A very nice young fellow — Casaubon has done everything for him , "
143244	143254	143255	143255	he	175	" He repays your expense in him , Casaubon , "
143262	143366	143255	143255	he	175	" I hope he will stay with me a long while and we shall make something of my documents . I have plenty of ideas and facts , you know , and I can see he is just the man to put them into shape — remembers what the right quotations are , omne tulit punctum , and that sort of thing — gives subjects a kind of turn . I invited him some time ago when you were ill , Casaubon ; Dorothea said you could n't have anybody in the house , you know , and she asked me to write . "
143536	143561	143522	143522	he	189	" You are exceedingly hospitable , my dear sir ; and I owe you acknowledgments for exercising your hospitality towards a relative of mine . "
143575	143585	143587	143587	Celia	169	" Now you can see him , Mrs. Cadwallader , "
143589	143613	143587	143587	Celia	169	" He is just like a miniature of Mr. Casaubon 's aunt that hangs in Dorothea 's boudoir — quite nice - looking . "
143614	143620	143622	143623	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" A very pretty sprig , "
143627	143638	143622	143623	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" What is your nephew to be , Mr. Casaubon ? "
143639	143654	143587	143587	Celia	169	" Pardon me , he is not my nephew . He is my cousin . "
143655	143661	143622	143623	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Well , you know , "
143666	143715	143663	143664	Mr. Brooke	175	" he is trying his wings . He is just the sort of young fellow to rise . I should be glad to give him an opportunity . He would make a good secretary , now , like Hobbes , Milton , Swift — that sort of man . "
143716	143720	143722	143723	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" I understand , "
143725	143732	143722	143723	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" One who can write speeches . "
143733	143745	143747	143748	Mr. Brooke	175	" I 'll fetch him in now , eh , Casaubon ? "
143750	143903	143747	143748	Mr. Brooke	175	" He would n't come in till I had announced him , you know . And we 'll go down and look at the picture . There you are to the life : a deep subtle sort of thinker with his fore - finger on the page , while Saint Bonaventure or somebody else , rather fat and florid , is looking up at the Trinity . Everything is symbolical , you know — the higher style of art : I like that up to a certain point , but not too far — it 's rather straining to keep up with , you know . But you are at home in that , Casaubon . And your painter 's flesh is good — solidity , transparency , everything of that sort . I went into that a great deal at one time . However , I 'll go and fetch Ladislaw . "
144199	144202	144196	144196	Jane	309	" having . "
144369	144394	144396	144396	Solomon	521	" Why , Trumbull himself is pretty sure of five hundred — that you may depend,—I should n't wonder if my brother promised him , "
144410	144415	144419	144419	Martha	500	" Dear , dear ! "
144862	144879	144881	144882	Mrs. Waule	304	" I suppose you know everything about what my poor brother 's done , Mr. Trumbull , "
144906	144920	144922	144923	the auctioneer	3054	" My good lady , whatever was told me was told in confidence , "
144934	144950	144893	144893	she	304	" Them who 've made sure of their good - luck may be disappointed yet , "
144962	144968	144970	144971	Mr. Trumbull	510	" Hopes are often delusive , "
144977	144980	144982	144983	Mrs. Waule	304	" Ah ! "
145003	145013	145014	145014	she	304	" It 's wonderful how close poor Peter was , "
145022	145055	145014	145014	she	304	" We none of us know what he might have had on his mind . I only hope and trust he was n't a worse liver than we think of , Martha . "
145103	145111	145112	145112	she	304	" I never was covetous , Jane , "
145115	145198	145112	145112	she	304	" but I have six children and have buried three , and I did n't marry into money . The eldest , that sits there , is but nineteen — so I leave you to guess . And stock always short , and land most awkward . But if ever I 've begged and prayed ; it 's been to God above ; though where there 's one brother a bachelor and the other childless after twice marrying — anybody might think ! "
145248	145267	145268	145268	he	282	" I should n't wonder if Featherstone had better feelings than any of us gave him credit for , "
145278	145342	145268	145268	he	282	" This funeral shows a thought about everybody : it looks well when a man wants to be followed by his friends , and if they are humble , not to be ashamed of them . I should be all the better pleased if he 'd left lots of small legacies . They may be uncommonly useful to fellows in a small way . "
145343	145358	145360	145361	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Everything is as handsome as could be , crape and silk and everything , "
145405	145410	145399	145400	Mr. Jonah	292	" love - child , "
145651	145658	145632	145632	he	273	" very fine , by God ! "
145861	145863	145818	145818	Jonah	292	" lawing "
145998	146007	146009	146010	Mr. Standish	273	" The will I hold in my hand , "
146045	146103	146026	146026	his	273	" was drawn up by myself and executed by our deceased friend on the 9th of August , 1825 . But I find that there is a subsequent instrument hitherto unknown to me , bearing date the 20th of July , 1826 , hardly a year later than the previous one . And there is farther , I see"—Mr
146114	146128	146113	146113	his	273	spectacles—"a codicil to this latter will , bearing date March 1 , 1828 . "
146129	146134	146136	146137	sister Martha	500	" Dear , dear ! "
146156	146166	146168	146169	Mr. Standish	273	" I shall begin by reading the earlier will , "
146171	146191	146168	146169	Mr. Standish	273	" since such , as appears by his not having destroyed the document , was the intention of deceased . "
146277	146281	146282	146282	she	301	" give and bequeath "
146740	146742	146787	146788	Mrs. Vincy	290	" much "
146845	146847	146838	146838	O	3263	" close "
146918	146925	146927	146928	Mr. Trumbull	510	" A most singular testamentary disposition ! "
146943	146969	146970	146971	Mary Garth	301	" But there is a second will — there is a further document . We have not yet heard the final wishes of the deceased . "
147159	147192	147194	147195	Mr. Vincy	282	" The most unaccountable will I ever heard ! I should say he was not in his right mind when he made it . I should say this last will was void , "
147209	147213	147194	147195	Mr. Vincy	282	" Eh Standish ? "
147214	147228	147230	147231	Mr. Standish	273	" Our deceased friend always knew what he was about , I think , "
147233	147262	147230	147231	Mr. Standish	273	" Everything is quite regular . Here is a letter from Clemmens of Brassing tied with the will . He drew it up . A very respectable solicitor . "
147263	147282	147284	147285	Borthrop Trumbull	510	" I never noticed any alienation of mind — any aberration of intellect in the late Mr. Featherstone , "
147287	147345	147284	147285	Borthrop Trumbull	510	" but I call this will eccentric . I was always willingly of service to the old soul ; and he intimated pretty plainly a sense of obligation which would show itself in his will . The gold - headed cane is farcical considered as an acknowledgment to me ; but happily I am above mercenary considerations . "
147346	147360	147362	147363	Caleb Garth	441	" There 's nothing very surprising in the matter that I can see , "
147365	147406	147362	147363	Caleb Garth	441	" Anybody might have had more reason for wondering if the will had been what you might expect from an open - minded straightforward man . For my part , I wish there was no such thing as a will . "
147407	147423	147425	147426	the lawyer	1585	" That 's a strange sentiment to come from a Christian man , by God ! "
147428	147443	147425	147426	the lawyer	1585	" I should like to know how you will back that up , Garth ! "
147444	147447	147449	147449	Caleb	441	" Oh , "
147480	147483	147425	147426	the lawyer	1585	" business . "
147493	147547	147486	147488	Mr. Jonah Featherstone	292	" Well , he always was a fine hypocrite , was my brother Peter . But this will cuts out everything . If I 'd known , a wagon and six horses should n't have drawn me from Brassing . I 'll put a white hat and drab coat on to - morrow . "
147548	147553	147555	147556	Mrs. Cranch	503	" Dear , dear , "
147558	147619	147555	147556	Mrs. Cranch	503	" and we 've been at the expense of travelling , and that poor lad sitting idle here so long ! It 's the first time I ever heard my brother Peter was so wishful to please God Almighty ; but if I was to be struck helpless I must say it 's hard — I can think no other . "
147620	147637	147639	147639	Solomon	521	" It 'll do him no good where he 's gone , that 's my belief , "
147658	147685	147650	147650	his	521	" Peter was a bad liver , and almshouses wo n't cover it , when he 's had the impudence to show it at the last . "
147686	147720	147722	147723	Mrs. Waule	304	" And all the while had got his own lawful family — brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces — and has sat in church with 'em whenever he thought well to come , "
147725	147839	147722	147723	Mrs. Waule	304	" And might have left his property so respectable , to them that 's never been used to extravagance or unsteadiness in no manner of way — and not so poor but what they could have saved every penny and made more of it . And me — the trouble I 've been at , times and times , to come here and be sisterly — and him with things on his mind all the while that might make anybody 's flesh creep . But if the Almighty 's allowed it , he means to punish him for it . Brother Solomon , I shall be going , if you 'll drive me . "
147840	147854	147856	147856	Solomon	311	" I 've no desire to put my foot on the premises again , "
147858	147875	147856	147856	Solomon	311	" I 've got land of my own and property of my own to will away . "
147876	147889	147891	147891	Jonah	292	" It 's a poor tale how luck goes in the world , "
147893	147935	147891	147891	Jonah	292	" It never answers to have a bit of spirit in you . You 'd better be a dog in the manger . But those above ground might learn a lesson . One fool 's will is enough in a family . "
147936	147948	147950	147950	Solomon	311	" There 's more ways than one of being a fool , "
147952	147996	147997	147997	Solomon	311	" I sha n't leave my money to be poured down the sink , and I sha n't leave it to foundlings from Africay . I like Featherstones that were brewed such , and not turned Featherstones with sticking the name on 'em . "
148270	148291	148292	148292	he	282	undertone,—"Don't give way , Lucy ; do n't make a fool of yourself , my dear , before these people , "
148298	148313	148292	148292	he	282	voice—"Go and order the phaeton , Fred ; I have no time to waste . "
148405	148410	148411	148411	she	301	" Good - by , "
148418	148444	148411	148411	she	301	" Be brave , Fred . I do believe you are better without the money . What was the good of it to Mr. Featherstone ? "
148445	148452	148454	148454	Fred	282	" That 's all very fine , "
148458	148474	148454	148454	Fred	282	" What is a fellow to do ? I must go into the Church now . "
148499	148537	148454	148454	Fred	282	" And I thought I should be able to pay your father at once and make everything right . And you have not even a hundred pounds left you . What shall you do now , Mary ? "
148538	148572	148476	148476	He	282	" Take another situation , of course , as soon as I can get one . My father has enough to do to keep the rest , without me . Good - by . "
149070	149075	149076	149076	he	1544	" Well , sir , "
149089	149127	149076	149076	he	1544	" I hope you 've made up your mind now to go up next term and pass your examination . I 've taken my resolution , so I advise you to lose no time in taking yours . "
149280	149284	149488	149489	Mrs. Vincy	290	" rather hard lines "
149317	149422	149311	149312	his mother	7010	" Do n't be hard on the poor boy , Vincy . He 'll turn out well yet , though that wicked man has deceived him . I feel as sure as I sit here , Fred will turn out well — else why was he brought back from the brink of the grave ? And I call it a robbery : it was like giving him the land , to promise it ; and what is promising , if making everybody believe is not promising ? And you see he did leave him ten thousand pounds , and then took it away again . "
149423	149429	149431	149432	Mr. Vincy	282	" Took it away again ! "
149436	149456	149431	149432	Mr. Vincy	282	" I tell you the lad 's an unlucky lad , Lucy . And you 've always spoiled him . "
149457	149486	149488	149489	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Well , Vincy , he was my first , and you made a fine fuss with him when he came . You were as proud as proud , "
149497	149515	149517	149518	the husband	8475	" Who knows what babies will turn to ? I was fool enough , I dare say , "
149525	149666	149517	149518	the husband	8475	" But who has handsomer , better children than ours ? Fred is far beyond other people 's sons : you may hear it in his speech , that he has kept college company . And Rosamond — where is there a girl like her ? She might stand beside any lady in the land , and only look the better for it . You see — Mr. Lydgate has kept the highest company and been everywhere , and he fell in love with her at once . Not but what I could have wished Rosamond had not engaged herself . She might have met somebody on a visit who would have been a far better match ; I mean at her schoolfellow Miss Willoughby 's . There are relations in that family quite as high as Mr. Lydgate 's . "
149667	149671	149673	149674	Mr. Vincy	282	" Damn relations ! "
149676	149705	149673	149674	Mr. Vincy	282	" I 've had enough of them . I do n't want a son - in - law who has got nothing but his relations to recommend him . "
149706	149712	149714	149715	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Why , my dear , "
149717	149769	149714	149715	Mrs. Vincy	290	" you seemed as pleased as could be about it . It 's true , I was n't at home ; but Rosamond told me you had n't a word to say against the engagement . And she has begun to buy in the best linen and cambric for her underclothing . "
149770	149776	149778	149779	Mr. Vincy	282	" Not by my will , "
149781	149853	149778	149779	Mr. Vincy	282	" I shall have enough to do this year , with an idle scamp of a son , without paying for wedding - clothes . The times are as tight as can be ; everybody is being ruined ; and I do n't believe Lydgate has got a farthing . I sha n't give my consent to their marrying . Let 'em wait , as their elders have done before 'em . "
149854	149874	149673	149674	Mr. Vincy	282	" Rosamond will take it hard , Vincy , and you know you never could bear to cross her . "
149875	149921	149778	149779	Mr. Vincy	282	" Yes , I could . The sooner the engagement 's off , the better . I do n't believe he 'll ever make an income , the way he goes on . He makes enemies ; that 's all I hear of his making . "
149922	149945	149778	149779	Mr. Vincy	282	" But he stands very high with Mr. Bulstrode , my dear . The marriage would please him , I should think . "
149946	149951	149953	149954	Mr. Vincy	282	" Please the deuce ! "
149956	150011	149953	149954	Mr. Vincy	282	" Bulstrode wo n't pay for their keep . And if Lydgate thinks I 'm going to give money for them to set up housekeeping , he 's mistaken , that 's all . I expect I shall have to put down my horses soon . You 'd better tell Rosy what I say . "
150115	150124	150126	150127	her mother	1711	" What do you say , my dear ? "
150133	150143	150145	150145	Rosamond	283	" Papa does not mean anything of the kind , "
150150	150195	150145	150145	Rosamond	283	" He has always said that he wished me to marry the man I loved . And I shall marry Mr. Lydgate . It is seven weeks now since papa gave his consent . And I hope we shall have Mrs. Bretton 's house . "
150196	150298	150126	150127	her mother	1711	" Well , my dear , I shall leave you to manage your papa . You always do manage everybody . But if we ever do go and get damask , Sadler 's is the place — far better than Hopkins 's . Mrs. Bretton 's is very large , though : I should love you to have such a house ; but it will take a great deal of furniture — carpeting and everything , besides plate and glass . And you hear , your papa says he will give no money . Do you think Mr. Lydgate expects it ? "
150299	150320	150145	150145	Rosamond	283	" You can not imagine that I should ask him , mamma . Of course he understands his own affairs . "
150321	150372	150126	150127	her mother	1711	" But he may have been looking for money , my dear , and we all thought of your having a pretty legacy as well as Fred;—and now everything is so dreadful — there 's no pleasure in thinking of anything , with that poor boy disappointed as he is . "
150373	150464	150465	150466	Mrs. Vincy	290	" That has nothing to do with my marriage , mamma . Fred must leave off being idle . I am going up - stairs to take this work to Miss Morgan : she does the open hemming very well . Mary Garth might do some work for me now , I should think . Her sewing is exquisite ; it is the nicest thing I know about Mary . I should so like to have all my cambric frilling double - hemmed . And it takes a long time . "
151232	151258	151260	151261	Mrs. Bulstrode	312	" Walter , you never mean to tell me that you have allowed all this to go on without inquiry into Mr. Lydgate 's prospects ? "
151281	151312	151264	151264	her	493	" Think of this girl brought up in luxury — in too worldly a way , I am sorry to say — what will she do on a small income ? "
151313	151379	151264	151264	her	493	" Oh , confound it , Harriet ! What can I do when men come into the town without any asking of mine ? Did you shut your house up against Lydgate ? Bulstrode has pushed him forward more than anybody . I never made any fuss about the young fellow . You should go and talk to your husband about it , not me . "
151380	151406	151264	151264	her	493	" Well , really , Walter , how can Mr. Bulstrode be to blame ? I am sure he did not wish for the engagement . "
151407	151427	151264	151264	her	493	" Oh , if Bulstrode had not taken him by the hand , I should never have invited him . "
151428	151448	151450	151451	Mrs. Bulstrode	312	" But you called him in to attend on Fred , and I am sure that was a mercy , "
151463	151471	151473	151474	Mr. Vincy	282	" I do n't know about mercy , "
151478	151530	151473	151474	Mr. Vincy	282	" I know I am worried more than I like with my family . I was a good brother to you , Harriet , before you married Bulstrode , and I must say he does n't always show that friendly spirit towards your family that might have been expected of him . "
151649	151670	151672	151673	Mrs. Bulstrode	312	" I am sure we are bound to pray for that thoughtless girl — brought up as she has been , "
151683	151689	151691	151692	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" Truly , my dear , "
151696	151778	151691	151692	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" Those who are not of this world can do little else to arrest the errors of the obstinately worldly . That is what we must accustom ourselves to recognize with regard to your brother 's family . I could have wished that Mr. Lydgate had not entered into such a union ; but my relations with him are limited to that use of his gifts for God 's purposes which is taught us by the divine government under each dispensation . "

152376	152396	152437	152438	the Vicar	8024	" Eros has degenerated ; he began by introducing order and harmony , and now he brings back chaos . "
152397	152404	152406	152406	Lydgate	278	" Yes , at some stages , "
152422	152431	152406	152406	Lydgate	278	" But a better order will begin after . "
152432	152435	152437	152438	the Vicar	8024	" Soon ? "
152440	152510	152437	152438	the Vicar	8024	" I hope so , really . This unsettled state of affairs uses up the time , and when one has notions in science , every moment is an opportunity . I feel sure that marriage must be the best thing for a man who wants to work steadily . He has everything at home then — no teasing with personal speculations — he can get calmness and freedom . "
152511	152518	152520	152521	the Vicar	8024	" You are an enviable dog , "
152523	152560	152520	152521	the Vicar	8024	" to have such a prospect — Rosamond , calmness and freedom , all to your share . Here am I with nothing but my pipe and pond - animalcules . Now , are you ready ? "
152755	152758	152759	152759	he	278	" Dear ! "
152855	152863	152914	152914	his	278	" Dear ! your eyelids are red . "
152864	152868	152870	152870	Rosamond	283	" Are they ? "
152872	152877	152870	152870	Rosamond	283	" I wonder why . "
152899	152909	152911	152911	Lydgate	278	" As if you could hide it from me ! "
152922	152951	152911	152911	Lydgate	278	" Do n't I see a tiny drop on one of the lashes ? Things trouble you , and you do n't tell me . That is unloving . "
152952	152978	152911	152911	Lydgate	278	" Why should I tell you what you can not alter ? They are every - day things:—perhaps they have been a little worse lately . "
152979	152992	152911	152911	Lydgate	278	" Family annoyances . Do n't fear speaking . I guess them . "
152993	153034	152911	152911	Lydgate	278	" Papa has been more irritable lately . Fred makes him angry , and this morning there was a fresh quarrel because Fred threatens to throw his whole education away , and do something quite beneath him . And besides — "
153088	153101	153102	153102	Rosamond	283	" I feel that papa is not quite pleased about our engagement , "
153110	153131	153102	153102	Rosamond	283	" and he said last night that he should certainly speak to you and say it must be given up . "
153132	153139	153141	153141	Lydgate	278	" Will you give it up ? "
153150	153162	153164	153164	Rosamond	283	" I never give up anything that I choose to do , "
153176	153181	153183	153183	Lydgate	278	" God bless you ! "
153205	153252	153200	153200	He	278	" It is too late now for your father to say that our engagement must be given up . You are of age , and I claim you as mine . If anything is done to make you unhappy,—that is a reason for hastening our marriage . "
153336	153343	153344	153344	he	278	" Why should we defer it ? "
153351	153385	153344	153344	he	278	" I have taken the house now : everything else can soon be got ready — can it not ? You will not mind about new clothes . Those can be bought afterwards . "
153386	153395	153397	153397	Rosamond	283	" What original notions you clever men have ! "
153411	153429	153344	153344	he	278	" This is the first time I ever heard of wedding - clothes being bought after marriage . "
153430	153451	153453	153453	Lydgate	278	" But you do n't mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for the sake of clothes ? "
153475	153522	153535	153535	he	278	" Remember , we are looking forward to a better sort of happiness even than this — being continually together , independent of others , and ordering our lives as we will . Come , dear , tell me how soon you can be altogether mine . "
153590	153602	153604	153604	Lydgate	278	" Six weeks would be ample — say so , Rosamond , "
153641	153668	153628	153628	she	283	" There would be the house - linen and the furniture to be prepared . Still , mamma could see to those while we were away . "
153669	153685	153628	153628	she	283	" Yes , to be sure . We must be away a week or so . "
153686	153693	153695	153695	Rosamond	283	" Oh , more than that ! "
153797	153840	153785	153785	she	283	" Whatever you wish , my darling , when the day is fixed . But let us take a decided course , and put an end to any discomfort you may be suffering . Six weeks!—I am sure they would be ample . "
153841	153849	153851	153851	Rosamond	283	" I could certainly hasten the work , "
153853	153873	153851	153851	Rosamond	283	" Will you , then , mention it to papa?—I think it would be better to write to him . "
154222	154228	154230	154231	Mrs. Vincy	290	" It must be lovely , "
154243	154261	154234	154234	Lydgate	278	" Just what Rosy ought to have . I trust in heaven it wo n't be broken ! "
154262	154273	154275	154275	Lydgate	278	" One must hire servants who will not break things , "
154410	154416	154418	154419	Mr. Vincy	282	" Nonsense , my dear ! "
154421	154480	154418	154419	Mr. Vincy	282	" What has he got to marry on ? You 'd much better give up the engagement . I 've told you so pretty plainly before this . What have you had such an education for , if you are to go and marry a poor man ? It 's a cruel thing for a father to see . "
154481	154512	154375	154375	She	283	" Mr. Lydgate is not poor , papa . He bought Mr. Peacock 's practice , which , they say , is worth eight or nine hundred a - year . "
154513	154542	154418	154419	Mr. Vincy	282	" Stuff and nonsense ! What 's buying a practice ? He might as well buy next year 's swallows . It 'll all slip through his fingers . "
154543	154569	154418	154419	Mr. Vincy	282	" On the contrary , papa , he will increase the practice . See how he has been called in by the Chettams and Casaubons . "
154570	154606	154375	154375	She	283	" I hope he knows I sha n't give anything — with this disappointment about Fred , and Parliament going to be dissolved , and machine - breaking everywhere , and an election coming on — "
154607	154621	154418	154419	Mr. Vincy	282	" Dear papa ! what can that have to do with my marriage ? "
154622	154698	154418	154419	Mr. Vincy	282	" A pretty deal to do with it ! We may all be ruined for what I know — the country 's in that state ! Some say it 's the end of the world , and be hanged if I do n't think it looks like it ! Anyhow , it 's not a time for me to be drawing money out of my business , and I should wish Lydgate to know that . "
154699	154736	154737	154738	Mr. Vincy	282	" I am sure he expects nothing , papa . And he has such very high connections : he is sure to rise in one way or another . He is engaged in making scientific discoveries . "
154742	154801	154737	154738	Mr. Vincy	282	" I can not give up my only prospect of happiness , papa . Mr. Lydgate is a gentleman . I could never love any one who was not a perfect gentleman . You would not like me to go into a consumption , as Arabella Hawley did . And you know that I never change my mind . "
154807	154845	154803	154803	papa	254	" Promise me , papa , that you will consent to what we wish . We shall never give each other up ; and you know that you have always objected to long courtships and late marriages . "
154861	154878	154857	154858	Mr. Vincy	282	" Well , well , child , he must write to me first before I can answer him,"—and
155299	155310	155311	155311	she	283	" I shall like so much to know your family , "
155324	155351	155311	155311	she	283	" We might perhaps take a direction that would allow us to see them as we returned . Which of your uncles do you like best ? "
155352	155369	155311	155311	she	283	" Oh,—my uncle Godwin , I think . He is a good - natured old fellow . "
155370	155416	155311	155311	she	283	" You were constantly at his house at Quallingham , when you were a boy , were you not ? I should so like to see the old spot and everything you were used to . Does he know you are going to be married ? "
155417	155420	155422	155422	Lydgate	278	" No , "
155436	155530	155422	155422	Lydgate	278	" Do send him word of it , you naughty undutiful nephew . He will perhaps ask you to take me to Quallingham ; and then you could show me about the grounds , and I could imagine you there when you were a boy . Remember , you see me in my home , just as it has been since I was a child . It is not fair that I should be so ignorant of yours . But perhaps you would be a little ashamed of me . I forgot that . "
155577	155592	155566	155566	he	278	" I will write to him , then . But my cousins are bores . "
155647	155684	155632	155632	mamma	296	" I hope your uncle Sir Godwin will not look down on Rosy , Mr. Lydgate . I should think he would do something handsome . A thousand or two can be nothing to a baronet . "
155685	155688	155690	155690	Rosamond	283	" Mamma ! "

156333	156430	156330	156331	Mr. Hawley	405	" He 's got the freak of being a popular man now , after dangling about like a stray tortoise . So much the worse for him . I 've had my eye on him for some time . He shall be prettily pumped upon . He 's a damned bad landlord . What business has an old county man to come currying favour with a low set of dark - blue freemen ? As to his paper , I only hope he may do the writing himself . It would be worth our paying for . "
156431	156476	156330	156331	Mr. Hawley	405	" I understand he has got a very brilliant young fellow to edit it , who can write the highest style of leading article , quite equal to anything in the London papers . And he means to take very high ground on Reform . "
156477	156517	156330	156331	Mr. Hawley	405	" Let Brooke reform his rent - roll . He 's a cursed old screw , and the buildings all over his estate are going to rack . I suppose this young fellow is some loose fish from London . "
156518	156533	156330	156331	Mr. Hawley	405	" His name is Ladislaw . He is said to be of foreign extraction . "
156534	156540	156542	156543	Mr. Hawley	405	" I know the sort , "
156545	156571	156542	156543	Mr. Hawley	405	" some emissary . He 'll begin with flourishing about the Rights of Man and end with murdering a wench . That 's the style . "
156572	156583	156585	156586	Mr. Hackbutt	404	" You must concede that there are abuses , Hawley , "
156597	156633	156585	156586	Mr. Hackbutt	404	" I myself should never favour immoderate views — in fact I take my stand with Huskisson — but I can not blind myself to the consideration that the non - representation of large towns — "
156634	156640	156642	156643	Mr. Hawley	405	" Large towns be damned ! "
156649	156695	156642	156643	Mr. Hawley	405	" I know a little too much about Middlemarch elections . Let 'em quash every pocket borough to - morrow , and bring in every mushroom town in the kingdom — they'll only increase the expense of getting into Parliament . I go upon facts . "

156991	157095	156976	156977	Mr. Brooke	175	" I do n't mean as to anything objectionable — laxities or atheism , or anything of that kind , you know — Ladislaw 's sentiments in every way I am sure are good — indeed , we were talking a great deal together last night . But he has the same sort of enthusiasm for liberty , freedom , emancipation — a fine thing under guidance — under guidance , you know . I think I shall be able to put him on the right tack ; and I am the more pleased because he is a relation of yours , Casaubon . "

158271	158298	158300	158300	Pratt	555	" Master is out , sir ; there 's only Mrs. Casaubon in the library . I 'd better tell her you 're here , sir , "
158327	158342	158344	158344	Will	261	" Oh , very well ; this confounded rain has hindered me from sketching , "
158377	158387	158388	158388	she	6948	" Mr. Casaubon has gone to the Archdeacon 's , "
158394	158429	158388	158388	she	6948	" I do n't know whether he will be at home again long before dinner . He was uncertain how long he should be . Did you want to say anything particular to him ? "
158430	158472	158388	158388	she	6948	" No ; I came to sketch , but the rain drove me in . Else I would not have disturbed you yet . I supposed that Mr. Casaubon was here , and I know he dislikes interruption at this hour . "
158473	158491	158492	158492	Dorothea	189	" I am indebted to the rain , then . I am so glad to see you . "
158510	158522	158524	158524	Will	261	" I really came for the chance of seeing you alone , "
158548	158573	158582	158582	her	3498	" I wanted to talk about things , as we did in Rome . It always makes a difference when other people are present . "
158574	158577	158579	158579	Dorothea	189	" Yes , "
158589	158593	158594	158594	She	3498	" Sit down . "
158749	158764	158765	158765	she	3498	" I have often thought that I should like to talk to you again , "
158770	158784	158765	158765	she	3498	" It seems strange to me how many things I said to you . "
158785	158791	158793	158793	Will	261	" I remember them all , "
158850	158865	158867	158867	Dorothea	189	" I have tried to learn a great deal since we were in Rome , "
158869	158946	158867	158867	Dorothea	189	" I can read Latin a little , and I am beginning to understand just a little Greek . I can help Mr. Casaubon better now . I can find out references for him and save his eyes in many ways . But it is very difficult to be learned ; it seems as if people were worn out on the way to great thoughts , and can never enjoy them because they are too tired . "
158947	158969	158971	158971	Will	261	" If a man has a capacity for great thoughts , he is likely to overtake them before he is decrepit , "
158999	159019	158994	158994	he	261	" But it is quite true that the best minds have been sometimes overstrained in working out their ideas . "
159020	159025	159027	159027	Dorothea	189	" You correct me , "
159029	159105	159027	159027	Dorothea	189	" I expressed myself ill . I should have said that those who have great thoughts get too much worn in working them out . I used to feel about that , even when I was a little girl ; and it always seemed to me that the use I should like to make of my life would be to help some one who did great works , so that his burthen might be lighter . "
159188	159199	159200	159200	he	261	" But you may easily carry the help too far , "
159203	159268	159200	159200	he	261	" and get over - wrought yourself . Are you not too much shut up ? You already look paler . It would be better for Mr. Casaubon to have a secretary ; he could easily get a man who would do half his work for him . It would save him more effectually , and you need only help him in lighter ways . "
159269	159277	159279	159279	Dorothea	189	" How can you think of that ? "
159288	159344	159279	159279	Dorothea	189	" I should have no happiness if I did not help him in his work . What could I do ? There is no good to be done in Lowick . The only thing I desire is to help him more . And he objects to a secretary : please not to mention that again . "
159345	159371	159200	159200	he	261	" Certainly not , now I know your feeling . But I have heard both Mr. Brooke and Sir James Chettam express the same wish . "
159372	159375	159377	159377	Dorothea	189	" Yes , "
159379	159425	159426	159426	she	3507	" but they do n't understand — they want me to be a great deal on horseback , and have the garden altered and new conservatories , to fill up my days . I thought you could understand that one 's mind has other wants , "
159430	159443	159426	159426	she	3507	impatiently—"besides , Mr. Casaubon can not bear to hear of a secretary . "
159444	159450	159452	159452	Will	261	" My mistake is excusable , "
159454	159500	159452	159452	Will	261	" In old days I used to hear Mr. Casaubon speak as if he looked forward to having a secretary . Indeed he held out the prospect of that office to me . But I turned out to be — not good enough for it . "
159527	159536	159519	159519	she	3507	" You were not a steady worker enough . "
159537	159540	159542	159542	Will	261	" No , "
159587	159641	159583	159583	he	261	" And I have seen since that Mr. Casaubon does not like any one to overlook his work and know thoroughly what he is doing . He is too doubtful — too uncertain of himself . I may not be good for much , but he dislikes me because I disagree with him . "
159852	159875	159845	159845	she	3511	" Mr. Casaubon must have overcome his dislike of you so far as his actions were concerned : and that is admirable . "
159876	159935	159845	159845	she	3511	" Yes ; he has shown a sense of justice in family matters . It was an abominable thing that my grandmother should have been disinherited because she made what they called a mesalliance , though there was nothing to be said against her husband except that he was a Polish refugee who gave lessons for his bread . "
159936	159945	159947	159947	Dorothea	189	" I wish I knew all about her ! "
159949	159979	159845	159845	she	3511	" I wonder how she bore the change from wealth to poverty : I wonder whether she was happy with her husband ! Do you know much about them ? "
159980	160079	159845	159845	she	3511	" No ; only that my grandfather was a patriot — a bright fellow — could speak many languages — musical — got his bread by teaching all sorts of things . They both died rather early . And I never knew much of my father , beyond what my mother told me ; but he inherited the musical talents . I remember his slow walk and his long thin hands ; and one day remains with me when he was lying ill , and I was very hungry , and had only a little bit of bread . "
160080	160090	160092	160092	Dorothea	189	" Ah , what a different life from mine ! "
160105	160132	160092	160092	Dorothea	189	" I have always had too much of everything . But tell me how it was — Mr. Casaubon could not have known about you then . "
160133	160214	160219	160219	Will	261	" No ; but my father had made himself known to Mr. Casaubon , and that was my last hungry day . My father died soon after , and my mother and I were well taken care of . Mr. Casaubon always expressly recognized it as his duty to take care of us because of the harsh injustice which had been shown to his mother 's sister . But now I am telling you what is not new to you . "
160291	160294	160296	160296	Dorothea	189	" No , "
160298	160311	160296	160296	Dorothea	189	" Mr. Casaubon has always avoided dwelling on his own honourable actions . "
160354	160371	160351	160351	she	3518	" He had never told me that he supported your mother . Is she still living ? "
160372	160472	160473	160473	Will	261	" No ; she died by an accident — a fall — four years ago . It is curious that my mother , too , ran away from her family , but not for the sake of her husband . She never would tell me anything about her family , except that she forsook them to get her own living — went on the stage , in fact . She was a dark - eyed creature , with crisp ringlets , and never seemed to be getting old . You see I come of rebellious blood on both sides , "
160517	160606	160607	160607	she	3520	" That is your apology , I suppose , for having yourself been rather rebellious ; I mean , to Mr. Casaubon 's wishes . You must remember that you have not done what he thought best for you . And if he dislikes you — you were speaking of dislike a little while ago — but I should rather say , if he has shown any painful feelings towards you , you must consider how sensitive he has become from the wearing effect of study . Perhaps , "
160616	160661	160607	160607	she	3520	" my uncle has not told you how serious Mr. Casaubon 's illness was . It would be very petty of us who are well and can bear things , to think much of small offences from those who carry a weight of trial . "
160662	160668	160670	160670	Will	261	" You teach me better , "
160672	160682	160688	160688	his	261	" I will never grumble on that subject again . "
160743	160753	160754	160754	he	261	" I have really sometimes been a perverse fellow , "
160758	160779	160754	160754	he	261	" but I will never again , if I can help it , do or say what you would disapprove . "
160780	160788	160790	160790	Dorothea	189	" That is very good of you , "
160797	160838	160790	160790	Dorothea	189	" I shall have a little kingdom then , where I shall give laws . But you will soon go away , out of my rule , I imagine . You will soon be tired of staying at the Grange . "
160839	160901	160754	160754	he	261	" That is a point I wanted to mention to you — one of the reasons why I wished to speak to you alone . Mr. Brooke proposes that I should stay in this neighborhood . He has bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers , and he wishes me to conduct that , and also to help him in other ways . "
160902	160915	160917	160917	Dorothea	189	" Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you ? "
160919	160985	160917	160917	Dorothea	189	" Perhaps ; but I have always been blamed for thinking of prospects , and not settling to anything . And here is something offered to me . If you would not like me to accept it , I will give it up . Otherwise I would rather stay in this part of the country than go away . I belong to nobody anywhere else . "
160986	160996	160998	160998	Dorothea	189	" I should like you to stay very much , "
161035	161041	161043	161043	Ladislaw	261	" Then I will stay , "
161143	161218	161127	161127	His	261	" But my opinion is of little consequence on such a subject . I think you should be guided by Mr. Casaubon . I spoke without thinking of anything else than my own feeling , which has nothing to do with the real question . But it now occurs to me — perhaps Mr. Casaubon might see that the proposal was not wise . Can you not wait now and mention it to him ? "
161219	161228	161230	161230	Will	261	" I ca n't wait to - day , "
161243	161289	161290	161290	He	261	" The rain is quite over now . I told Mr. Brooke not to call for me : I would rather walk the five miles . I shall strike across Halsell Common , and see the gleams on the wet grass . I like that . "
161306	161316	161290	161290	He	261	" Do n't mention the subject to Mr. Casaubon . "
161375	161383	161385	161385	Dorothea	189	" I wish you could have stayed , "
161443	161448	161440	161440	they	3529	" Good - by , "
161640	161700	161632	161632	he	261	" I have had the gratification of meeting my former acquaintance , Dr. Spanning , to - day , and of being praised by one who is himself a worthy recipient of praise . He spoke very handsomely of my late tractate on the Egyptian Mysteries,—using , in fact , terms which it would not become me to repeat . "
161741	161752	161754	161754	Dorothea	189	" I am very glad you have had that pleasure , "
161769	161787	161754	161754	Dorothea	189	" Before you came I had been regretting that you happened to be out to - day . "
161788	161795	161797	161798	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Why so , my dear ? "
161805	161833	161797	161798	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Because Mr. Ladislaw has been here ; and he has mentioned a proposal of my uncle 's which I should like to know your opinion of . "
161892	161940	161883	161883	He	189	" Dear uncle , you know , has many projects . It appears that he has bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers , and he has asked Mr. Ladislaw to stay in this neighborhood and conduct the paper for him , besides helping him in other ways . "
161975	161981	161982	161982	she	3536	" What is your opinion ? "
161993	162005	162007	162008	Mr. Casaubon	189	" Did Mr. Ladislaw come on purpose to ask my opinion ? "
162050	162053	162054	162054	she	3536	" No , "
162058	162089	162054	162054	she	3536	" he did not say that he came to ask your opinion . But when he mentioned the proposal , he of course expected me to tell you of it . "
162095	162176	162090	162091	Mr. Casaubon	189	" I feared that you might feel some objection . But certainly a young man with so much talent might be very useful to my uncle — might help him to do good in a better way . And Mr. Ladislaw wishes to have some fixed occupation . He has been blamed , he says , for not seeking something of that kind , and he would like to stay in this neighborhood because no one cares for him elsewhere . "
162236	162240	162242	162242	he	189	" Dear Mr. Ladislaw "
162249	162251	162242	162242	he	189	" Will "
162254	162517	162518	162519	EDWARD CASAUBON	181	" Mrs. Casaubon informs me that a proposal has been made to you , and ( according to an inference by no means stretched ) has on your part been in some degree entertained , which involves your residence in this neighborhood in a capacity which I am justified in saying touches my own position in such a way as renders it not only natural and warrantable in me when that effect is viewed under the influence of legitimate feeling , but incumbent on me when the same effect is considered in the light of my responsibilities , to state at once that your acceptance of the proposal above indicated would be highly offensive to me . That I have some claim to the exercise of a veto here , would not , I believe , be denied by any reasonable person cognizant of the relations between us : relations which , though thrown into the past by your recent procedure , are not thereby annulled in their character of determining antecedents . I will not here make reflections on any person 's judgment . It is enough for me to point out to yourself that there are certain social fitnesses and proprieties which should hinder a somewhat near relative of mine from becoming any wise conspicuous in this vicinity in a status not only much beneath my own , but associated at best with the sciolism of literary or political adventurers . At any rate , the contrary issue must exclude you from further reception at my house . Yours faithfully , "
162521	162701	162518	162519	EDWARD CASAUBON	181	" Meanwhile Dorothea 's mind was innocently at work towards the further embitterment of her husband ; dwelling , with a sympathy that grew to agitation , on what Will had told her about his parents and grandparents . Any private hours in her day were usually spent in her blue - green boudoir , and she had come to be very fond of its pallid quaintness . Nothing had been outwardly altered there ; but while the summer had gradually advanced over the western fields beyond the avenue of elms , the bare room had gathered within it those memories of an inward life which fill the air as with a cloud of good or bad angels , the invisible yet active forms of our spiritual triumphs or our spiritual falls . She had been so used to struggle for and to find resolve in looking along the avenue towards the arch of western light that the vision itself had gained a communicating power . Even the pale stag seemed to have reminding glances and to mean mutely , "
162707	162739	162518	162519	EDWARD CASAUBON	181	" And the group of delicately touched miniatures had made an audience as of beings no longer disturbed about their own earthly lot , but still humanly interested . Especially the mysterious "
162742	162933	162518	162519	EDWARD CASAUBON	181	" about whom Dorothea had never found it easy to question her husband . And now , since her conversation with Will , many fresh images had gathered round that Aunt Julia who was Will 's grandmother ; the presence of that delicate miniature , so like a living face that she knew , helping to concentrate her feelings . What a wrong , to cut off the girl from the family protection and inheritance only because she had chosen a man who was poor ! Dorothea , early troubling her elders with questions about the facts around her , had wrought herself into some independent clearness as to the historical , political reasons why eldest sons had superior rights , and why land should be entailed : those reasons , impressing her with a certain awe , might be weightier than she knew , but here was a question of ties which left them uninfringed . Here was a daughter whose child — even according to the ordinary aping of aristocratic institutions by people who are no more aristocratic than retired grocers , and who have no more land to "
162936	163327	163329	163329	he	3545	" than a lawn and a paddock — would have a prior claim . Was inheritance a question of liking or of responsibility ? All the energy of Dorothea 's nature went on the side of responsibility — the fulfilment of claims founded on our own deeds , such as marriage and parentage . It was true , she said to herself , that Mr. Casaubon had a debt to the Ladislaws — that he had to pay back what the Ladislaws had been wronged of . And now she began to think of her husband 's will , which had been made at the time of their marriage , leaving the bulk of his property to her , with proviso in case of her having children . That ought to be altered ; and no time ought to be lost . This very question which had just arisen about Will Ladislaw 's occupation , was the occasion for placing things on a new , right footing . Her husband , she felt sure , according to all his previous conduct , would be ready to take the just view , if she proposed it — she , in whose interest an unfair concentration of the property had been urged . His sense of right had surmounted and would continue to surmount anything that might be called antipathy . She suspected that her uncle 's scheme was disapproved by Mr. Casaubon , and this made it seem all the more opportune that a fresh understanding should be begun , so that instead of Will 's starting penniless and accepting the first function that offered itself , he should find himself in possession of a rightful income which should be paid by her husband during his life , and , by an immediate alteration of the will , should be secured at his death . The vision of all this as what ought to be done seemed to Dorothea like a sudden letting in of daylight , waking her from her previous stupidity and incurious self - absorbed ignorance about her husband 's relation to others . Will Ladislaw had refused Mr. Casaubon 's future aid on a ground that no longer appeared right to her ; and Mr. Casaubon had never himself seen fully what was the claim upon him . "
163332	163336	163341	163341	his	3545	" said Dorothea . "
163376	163673	163674	163674	Dorothea	189	" There was a peculiar fascination for Dorothea in this division of property intended for herself , and always regarded by her as excessive . She was blind , you see , to many things obvious to others — likely to tread in the wrong places , as Celia had warned her ; yet her blindness to whatever did not lie in her own pure purpose carried her safely by the side of precipices where vision would have been perilous with fear . The thoughts which had gathered vividness in the solitude of her boudoir occupied her incessantly through the day on which Mr. Casaubon had sent his letter to Will . Everything seemed hindrance to her till she could find an opportunity of opening her heart to her husband . To his preoccupied mind all subjects were to be approached gently , and she had never since his illness lost from her consciousness the dread of agitating him . But when young ardor is set brooding over the conception of a prompt deed , the deed itself seems to start forth with independent life , mastering ideal obstacles . The day passed in a sombre fashion , not unusual , though Mr. Casaubon was perhaps unusually silent ; but there were hours of the night which might be counted on as opportunities of conversation ; for Dorothea , when aware of her husband 's sleeplessness , had established a habit of rising , lighting a candle , and reading him to sleep again . And this night she was from the beginning sleepless , excited by resolves . He slept as usual for a few hours , but she had risen softly and had sat in the darkness for nearly an hour before he said — "
163687	163688	163682	163682	you	189	" "
163696	163707	163682	163682	you	189	" was her first question , as she obeyed him . "
163736	163737	163726	163726	you	189	" "
163747	163751	163739	163739	I	0	" said Dorothea . "
163754	163755	163739	163739	I	0	" "
163781	163782	163739	163739	I	0	" "
163793	163794	163787	163787	Dorothea	189	" "

163943	163979	163933	163933	you	189	" Dorothea waited a few moments for some answer that would help her onward . None came , and her next words seemed the more forcible to her , falling clear upon the dark silence . "
164075	164076	164077	164078	Mr. Ladislaw	261	" "
164089	164104	164077	164078	Mr. Ladislaw	261	" said Mr. Casaubon , with a certain biting quickness not habitual to him . "
164109	164115	164077	164078	Mr. Ladislaw	261	" said Dorothea , earnestly . "
164223	164247	164248	164248	Dorothea	189	" There was a perceptible pause before Mr. Casaubon replied , not quickly as before , but with a still more biting emphasis . "
164388	164529	164530	164533	DEAR MR . CASAUBON,—I	223	" Poor Dorothea , shrouded in the darkness , was in a tumult of conflicting emotions . Alarm at the possible effect on himself of her husband 's strongly manifested anger , would have checked any expression of her own resentment , even if she had been quite free from doubt and compunction under the consciousness that there might be some justice in his last insinuation . Hearing him breathe quickly after he had spoken , she sat listening , frightened , wretched — with a dumb inward cry for help to bear this nightmare of a life in which every energy was arrested by dread . But nothing else happened , except that they both remained a long while sleepless , without speaking again . The next day , Mr. Casaubon received the following answer from Will Ladislaw : — "
164817	165190	164814	164815	WILL LADISLAW	261	" Poor Mr. Casaubon felt ( and must not we , being impartial , feel with him a little ? ) that no man had juster cause for disgust and suspicion than he . Young Ladislaw , he was sure , meant to defy and annoy him , meant to win Dorothea 's confidence and sow her mind with disrespect , and perhaps aversion , towards her husband . Some motive beneath the surface had been needed to account for Will 's sudden change of course in rejecting Mr. Casaubon 's aid and quitting his travels ; and this defiant determination to fix himself in the neighborhood by taking up something so much at variance with his former choice as Mr. Brooke 's Middlemarch projects , revealed clearly enough that the undeclared motive had relation to Dorothea . Not for one moment did Mr. Casaubon suspect Dorothea of any doubleness : he had no suspicions of her , but he had ( what was little less uncomfortable ) the positive knowledge that her tendency to form opinions about her husband 's conduct was accompanied with a disposition to regard Will Ladislaw favourably and be influenced by what he said . His own proud reticence had prevented him from ever being undeceived in the supposition that Dorothea had originally asked her uncle to invite Will to his house . And now , on receiving Will 's letter , Mr. Casaubon had to consider his duty . He would never have been easy to call his action anything else than duty ; but in this case , contending motives thrust him back into negations . Should he apply directly to Mr. Brooke , and demand of that troublesome gentleman to revoke his proposal ? Or should he consult Sir James Chettam , and get him to concur in remonstrance against a step which touched the whole family ? In either case Mr. Casaubon was aware that failure was just as probable as success . It was impossible for him to mention Dorothea 's name in the matter , and without some alarming urgency Mr. Brooke was as likely as not , after meeting all representations with apparent assent , to wind up by saying , "
165221	165348	165214	165214	my	0	" And Mr. Casaubon shrank nervously from communicating on the subject with Sir James Chettam , between whom and himself there had never been any cordiality , and who would immediately think of Dorothea without any mention of her . Poor Mr. Casaubon was distrustful of everybody 's feeling towards him , especially as a husband . To let any one suppose that he was jealous would be to admit their ( suspected ) view of his disadvantages : to let them know that he did not find marriage particularly blissful would imply his conversion to their ( probably ) earlier disapproval . It would be as bad as letting Carp , and Brasenose generally , know how backward he was in organizing the matter for his "
165354	165474	165475	165475	I	0	" All through his life Mr. Casaubon had been trying not to admit even to himself the inward sores of self - doubt and jealousy . And on the most delicate of all personal subjects , the habit of proud suspicious reticence told doubly . Thus Mr. Casaubon remained proudly , bitterly silent . But he had forbidden Will to come to Lowick Manor , and he was mentally preparing other measures of frustration . Sir James Chettam could not look with any satisfaction on Mr. Brooke 's new courses ; but it was easier to object than to hinder . Sir James accounted for his having come in alone one day to lunch with the Cadwalladers by saying — "
165501	165502	165503	165503	I	0	" "
165517	165535	165506	165506	you	3568	" darted in Mrs. Cadwallader , almost before the last word was off her friend 's tongue . "

169057	169062	169078	169078	you	177	" said Sir James . "

169272	169304	169305	169305	I	0	" After that , Mr. Brooke remembered that there was a packet which he had omitted to send off from the Grange , and he bade everybody hurriedly good - by . "
169316	169321	169322	169322	I	0	" said Sir James ; "
169354	169355	169332	169332	he	175	" "
169369	169374	169332	169332	he	175	" said the Rector . "
169465	169466	169468	169468	me	0	" "
169481	169486	169472	169472	you	3719	" said Mrs. Cadwallader . "
169543	169560	169563	169563	Brooke	175	" Sir James Chettam 's mind was not fruitful in devices , but his growing anxiety to "
169565	169694	169563	169563	Brooke	175	" once brought close to his constant belief in Dorothea 's capacity for influence , became formative , and issued in a little plan ; namely , to plead Celia 's indisposition as a reason for fetching Dorothea by herself to the Hall , and to leave her at the Grange with the carriage on the way , after making her fully aware of the situation concerning the management of the estate . In this way it happened that one day near four o'clock , when Mr. Brooke and Ladislaw were seated in the library , the door opened and Mrs. Casaubon was announced . Will , the moment before , had been low in the depths of boredom , and , obliged to help Mr. Brooke in arranging "
169696	169960	169563	169563	Brooke	175	" about hanging sheep - stealers , was exemplifying the power our minds have of riding several horses at once by inwardly arranging measures towards getting a lodging for himself in Middlemarch and cutting short his constant residence at the Grange ; while there flitted through all these steadier images a tickling vision of a sheep - stealing epic written with Homeric particularity . When Mrs. Casaubon was announced he started up as from an electric shock , and felt a tingling at his finger - ends . Any one observing him would have seen a change in his complexion , in the adjustment of his facial muscles , in the vividness of his glance , which might have made them imagine that every molecule in his body had passed the message of a magic touch . And so it had . For effective magic is transcendent nature ; and who shall measure the subtlety of those touches which convey the quality of soul as well as body , and make a man 's passion for one woman differ from his passion for another as joy in the morning light over valley and river and white mountain - top differs from joy among Chinese lanterns and glass panels ? Will , too , was made of very impressible stuff . The bow of a violin drawn near him cleverly , would at one stroke change the aspect of the world for him , and his point of view shifted as easily as his mood . Dorothea 's entrance was the freshness of morning . "
169972	169982	169983	169983	You	6867	" said Mr. Brooke , meeting and kissing her . "
170013	170014	170010	170010	you	6867	" "
170024	170054	170022	170022	uncle	6726	" said Dorothea , turning to Will and shaking hands with open cheerfulness , while she made no other form of greeting , but went on answering her uncle . "
170093	170138	170078	170078	I	0	" She seated herself beside her uncle opposite to Will , and was evidently preoccupied with something that made her almost unmindful of him . He was ridiculously disappointed , as if he had imagined that her coming had anything to do with him . "
170250	170251	170249	170249	I.	0	" "
170254	170262	170249	170249	I.	0	" said Dorothea , with characteristic directness , "
170319	170345	170378	170379	Mr. Garth	442	happy!"—she went on , clasping her hands , with a return to that more childlike impetuous manner , which had been subdued since her marriage . "
170390	170391	170386	170387	Sir James	177	" "
170401	170409	170392	170392	Chettam	177	" said Mr. Brooke , colouring slightly ; "
170440	170441	170428	170428	I	0	" "
170452	170473	170442	170442	He	177	" said Dorothea , in a voice as clear and unhesitating as that of a young chorister chanting a credo , "
170684	170858	170864	170864	you	3754	" Dorothea had gathered emotion as she went on , and had forgotten everything except the relief of pouring forth her feelings , unchecked : an experience once habitual with her , but hardly ever present since her marriage , which had been a perpetual struggle of energy with fear . For the moment , Will 's admiration was accompanied with a chilling sense of remoteness . A man is seldom ashamed of feeling that he can not love a woman so well when he sees a certain greatness in her : nature having intended greatness for men . But nature has sometimes made sad oversights in carrying out her intention ; as in the case of good Mr. Brooke , whose masculine consciousness was at this moment in rather a stammering condition under the eloquence of his niece . He could not immediately find any other mode of expressing himself than that of rising , fixing his eye - glass , and fingering the papers before him . At last he said — "
170948	170981	170982	170982	I	0	" These interrogatives were addressed to the footman who had come in to say that the keeper had found one of Dagley 's boys with a leveret in his hand just killed . "
171000	171013	170990	170990	I	0	" said Mr. Brooke aside to Dorothea , shuffling away very cheerfully . "
171032	171046	171047	171047	I	0	" said Dorothea to Will , as soon as her uncle was gone . "
171094	171116	171079	171079	I	0	" said Will , rising with a movement of impatience , and holding the back of his chair with both hands . "
171124	171226	171227	171227	I	0	" said Dorothea , anxiously , also rising and going to the open window , where Monk was looking in , panting and wagging his tail . She leaned her back against the window - frame , and laid her hand on the dog 's head ; for though , as we know , she was not fond of pets that must be held in the hands or trodden on , she was always attentive to the feelings of dogs , and very polite if she had to decline their advances . Will followed her only with his eyes and said , "
171243	171244	171232	171233	Mr. Casaubon	189	" "
171251	171267	171247	171247	I	0	" said Dorothea , after a moment 's pause . She was evidently much moved . "
171275	171451	171268	171268	I	0	" she added , mournfully . She was thinking of what Will had no knowledge of — the conversation between her and her husband in the darkness ; and she was anew smitten with hopelessness that she could influence Mr. Casaubon 's action . But the marked expression of her sorrow convinced Will that it was not all given to him personally , and that Dorothea had not been visited by the idea that Mr. Casaubon 's dislike and jealousy of him turned upon herself . He felt an odd mixture of delight and vexation : of delight that he could dwell and be cherished in her thought as in a pure home , without suspicion and without stint — of vexation because he was of too little account with her , was not formidable enough , was treated with an unhesitating benevolence which did not flatter him . But his dread of any change in Dorothea was stronger than his discontent , and he began to speak again in a tone of mere explanation . "
171576	171598	171563	171563	I	0	" Dorothea felt wretched . She thought her husband altogether in the wrong , on more grounds than Will had mentioned . "
171611	171624	171563	171563	I	0	" she said , with a tremulousness not common in her voice , "
171637	171650	171632	171632	You	3766	" She was looking out on the lawn , with melancholy meditation . "
171662	171674	171654	171654	I	0	" said Will , in a tone of almost boyish complaint . "
171677	171688	171654	171654	I	0	" said Dorothea , turning her eyes full upon him , "
171710	171711	171699	171699	I	0	" "
171720	171724	171712	171712	I	0	" said Will . "
171732	171733	171725	171726	No one	1135	" "
171742	171759	171725	171726	No one	1135	" said Dorothea , her lips curling with an exquisite smile , which irradiated her melancholy . "
171766	171767	171760	171760	I	0	" "
171774	171780	171760	171760	I	0	" said Will , impetuously . "
171788	171792	171793	171793	I	0	" said Dorothea . "
171798	171814	171815	171815	I	0	" He did not speak , but she replied to some change in his expression . "
171855	171856	171847	171847	my	0	" "
171861	171871	171847	171847	my	0	" said Will , rather jealous of the belief . "

172066	172095	172039	172039	I	0	" said Will , ardently , and rather wondering at himself . They were looking at each other like two fond children who were talking confidentially of birds . "
172101	172105	172106	172106	I	0	" said Dorothea . "
172124	172125	172106	172106	I	0	" "
172138	172142	172106	172106	I	0	" said Will . "
172168	172169	172163	172163	I	0	" "
172185	172191	172172	172172	you	3771	" said Dorothea , smiling . "
172197	172201	172193	172193	you	3771	" said Will . "
172223	172229	172213	172213	I	0	" said Dorothea , playfully . "
172259	172332	172254	172254	Celia	169	" Will offered to tell Mr. Brooke , who presently came and said that he would step into the carriage and go with Dorothea as far as Dagley 's , to speak about the small delinquent who had been caught with the leveret . Dorothea renewed the subject of the estate as they drove along , but Mr. Brooke , not being taken unawares , got the talk under his own control . "
172337	172341	172342	172342	he	177	" he replied ; "
172457	172458	172445	172445	He	575	" "
172467	172471	172445	172445	He	575	" said Dorothea . "
172751	172870	172748	172748	Dagley	570	" Mr. Brooke got down at a farmyard - gate , and Dorothea drove on . It is wonderful how much uglier things will look when we only suspect that we are blamed for them . Even our own persons in the glass are apt to change their aspect for us after we have heard some frank remark on their less admirable points ; and on the other hand it is astonishing how pleasantly conscience takes our encroachments on those who never complain or have nobody to complain for them . Dagley 's homestead never before looked so dismal to Mr. Brooke as it did today , with his mind thus sore about the fault - finding of the "
172873	173127	172748	172748	Dagley	570	" echoed by Sir James . It is true that an observer , under that softening influence of the fine arts which makes other people 's hardships picturesque , might have been delighted with this homestead called Freeman 's End : the old house had dormer - windows in the dark red roof , two of the chimneys were choked with ivy , the large porch was blocked up with bundles of sticks , and half the windows were closed with gray worm - eaten shutters about which the jasmine - boughs grew in wild luxuriance ; the mouldering garden wall with hollyhocks peeping over it was a perfect study of highly mingled subdued colour , and there was an aged goat ( kept doubtless on interesting superstitious grounds ) lying against the open back - kitchen door . The mossy thatch of the cow - shed , the broken gray barn - doors , the pauper labourers in ragged breeches who had nearly finished unloading a wagon of corn into the barn ready for early thrashing ; the scanty dairy of cows being tethered for milking and leaving one half of the shed in brown emptiness ; the very pigs and white ducks seeming to wander about the uneven neglected yard as if in low spirits from feeding on a too meagre quality of rinsings,—all these objects under the quiet light of a sky marbled with high clouds would have made a sort of picture which we have all paused over as a "
173131	173497	173498	173498	Dagley	570	" touching other sensibilities than those which are stirred by the depression of the agricultural interest , with the sad lack of farming capital , as seen constantly in the newspapers of that time . But these troublesome associations were just now strongly present to Mr. Brooke , and spoiled the scene for him . Mr. Dagley himself made a figure in the landscape , carrying a pitchfork and wearing his milking - hat — a very old beaver flattened in front . His coat and breeches were the best he had , and he would not have been wearing them on this weekday occasion if he had not been to market and returned later than usual , having given himself the rare treat of dining at the public table of the Blue Bull . How he came to fall into this extravagance would perhaps be matter of wonderment to himself on the morrow ; but before dinner something in the state of the country , a slight pause in the harvest before the Far Dips were cut , the stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on the walls , had seemed to warrant a little recklessness . It was a maxim about Middlemarch , and regarded as self - evident , that good meat should have good drink , which last Dagley interpreted as plenty of table ale well followed up by rum - and - water . These liquors have so far truth in them that they were not false enough to make poor Dagley seem merry : they only made his discontent less tongue - tied than usual . He had also taken too much in the shape of muddy political talk , a stimulant dangerously disturbing to his farming conservatism , which consisted in holding that whatever is , is bad , and any change is likely to be worse . He was flushed , and his eyes had a decidedly quarrelsome stare as he stood still grasping his pitchfork , while the landlord approached with his easy shuffling walk , one hand in his trouser - pocket and the other swinging round a thin walking - stick . "
173504	173522	173498	173498	Dagley	570	" began Mr. Brooke , conscious that he was going to be very friendly about the boy . "
173544	173590	173542	173542	ye	0	" said Dagley , with a loud snarling irony which made Fag the sheep - dog stir from his seat and prick his ears ; but seeing Monk enter the yard after some outside loitering , Fag seated himself again in an attitude of observation . "
173602	173651	173598	173600	a good feller	3796	" Mr. Brooke reflected that it was market - day , and that his worthy tenant had probably been dining , but saw no reason why he should not go on , since he could take the precaution of repeating what he had to say to Mrs. Dagley . "
173725	173726	173729	173729	I	0	" "
173766	173806	173811	173811	I	0	" Dagley 's words were loud enough to summon his wife to the back - kitchen door — the only entrance ever used , and one always open except in bad weather — and Mr. Brooke , saying soothingly , "
173827	173843	173845	173845	his	0	" turned to walk to the house . But Dagley , only the more inclined to "
173847	173882	173845	173845	his	0	" with a gentleman who walked away from him , followed at once , with Fag slouching at his heels and sullenly evading some small and probably charitable advances on the part of Monk . "
173891	173900	173888	173889	Mrs. Dagley	579	" said Mr. Brooke , making some haste . "
173924	174003	173921	173921	you	1159	" He was careful to speak quite plainly this time . Overworked Mrs. Dagley — a thin , worn woman , from whose life pleasure had so entirely vanished that she had not even any Sunday clothes which could give her satisfaction in preparing for church — had already had a misunderstanding with her husband since he had come home , and was in low spirits , expecting the worst . But her husband was beforehand in answering . "
174020	174038	174007	174007	he	3806	" pursued Dagley , throwing out his voice , as if he wanted it to hit hard . "
174074	174075	174076	174076	You	1159	" "
174086	174091	174081	174081	your	1159	" said the wife , "
174148	174149	174150	174150	Niver	581	" "
174159	174166	174152	174152	you	1159	" said Dagley , more fiercely , "
174268	174269	174270	174270	My	0	" "
174281	174291	174274	174274	you	3795	" said Mr. Brooke , confidentially but not judiciously . "
174298	174373	174274	174274	you	3795	" he added , turning as if to go . But Dagley immediately fronted him , and Fag at his heels growled low , as his master 's voice grew louder and more insulting , while Monk also drew close in silent dignified watch . The labourers on the wagon were pausing to listen , and it seemed wiser to be quite passive than to attempt a ridiculous flight pursued by a bawling man . "
174387	174391	174392	174392	I	0	" said Dagley . "
174651	174939	174646	174646	I'n	0	" concluded Mr. Dagley , striking his fork into the ground with a firmness which proved inconvenient as he tried to draw it up again . At this last action Monk began to bark loudly , and it was a moment for Mr. Brooke to escape . He walked out of the yard as quickly as he could , in some amazement at the novelty of his situation . He had never been insulted on his own land before , and had been inclined to regard himself as a general favourite ( we are all apt to do so , when we think of our own amiability more than of what other people are likely to want of us ) . When he had quarrelled with Caleb Garth twelve years before he had thought that the tenants would be pleased at the landlord 's taking everything into his own hands . Some who follow the narrative of his experience may wonder at the midnight darkness of Mr. Dagley ; but nothing was easier in those times than for an hereditary farmer of his grade to be ignorant , in spite somehow of having a rector in the twin parish who was a gentleman to the backbone , a curate nearer at hand who preached more learnedly than the rector , a landlord who had gone into everything , especially fine art and social improvement , and all the lights of Middlemarch only three miles off . As to the facility with which mortals escape knowledge , try an average acquaintance in the intellectual blaze of London , and consider what that eligible person for a dinner - party would have been if he had learned scant skill in "

Poor Dagley read a few verses sometimes on a Sunday evening , and the world was at least not darker to him than it had been before . Some things he knew thoroughly , namely , the slovenly habits of farming , and the awkwardness of weather , stock and crops , at Freeman 's End — so called apparently by way of sarcasm , to imply that a man was free to quit it if he chose , but that there was no earthly "
175061	175188	174646	174646	I'n	0	" open to him . In watching effects , if only of an electric battery , it is often necessary to change our place and examine a particular mixture or group at some distance from the point where the movement we are interested in was set up . The group I am moving towards is at Caleb Garth 's breakfast - table in the large parlor where the maps and desk were : father , mother , and five of the children . Mary was just now at home waiting for a situation , while Christy , the boy next to her , was getting cheap learning and cheap fare in Scotland , having to his father 's disappointment taken to books instead of that sacred calling "
175191	175348	174646	174646	I'n	0	" The letters had come — nine costly letters , for which the postman had been paid three and twopence , and Mr. Garth was forgetting his tea and toast while he read his letters and laid them open one above the other , sometimes swaying his head slowly , sometimes screwing up his mouth in inward debate , but not forgetting to cut off a large red seal unbroken , which Letty snatched up like an eager terrier . The talk among the rest went on unrestrainedly , for nothing disturbed Caleb 's absorption except shaking the table when he was writing . Two letters of the nine had been for Mary . After reading them , she had passed them to her mother , and sat playing with her tea - spoon absently , till with a sudden recollection she returned to her sewing , which she had kept on her lap during breakfast . "
175357	175366	175355	175355	Mary	301	" said Ben , pulling her arm down . "
175377	175389	175355	175355	Mary	301	" He had been kneading a small mass for the purpose . "
175396	175414	175394	175394	Mischief	586	" said Mary , good - humoredly , while she pricked his hand lightly with her needle . "
175461	175472	175452	175452	she	283	" Mary ended merrily , amused with the last notion . "
175480	175511	175476	175476	she	283	" said Letty , seriously interested in this mystery , and pushing her head so close to her sister that Mary now turned the threatening needle towards Letty 's nose . "
175529	175551	175476	175476	she	283	" said Mary , with a grave air of explanation , so that Letty sank back with a sense of knowledge . "
175562	175572	175556	175556	your	301	" said Mrs. Garth , laying the letters down . "
175582	175586	175573	175573	I	0	" said Mary . "

175693	175700	175691	175691	mother	7322	" said Mary , rather curtly . "

175741	175745	175736	175737	a girls	3843	" said Alfred . "

175773	175777	175778	175778	They	3846	" said Jim . "
175796	175797	175790	175790	Mary	301	" "
175808	175826	175801	175801	Mary	301	" said the father , looking over his spectacles and pausing before he opened his next letter . "
175835	175839	175801	175801	Mary	301	" said Alfred . "
175851	175862	175849	175849	Mary	301	" said Caleb , gently , looking at his daughter . "
175905	175906	175907	175908	Poor child	1313	" "
175922	175932	175920	175920	Susan	379	" said Caleb , looking plaintively at his wife . "
175943	175957	175933	175933	Mary	301	" said Mrs. Garth , magisterially , conscious of having done her own . "
175973	175993	175962	175962	me	0	" said Alfred — at which Mary and her father laughed silently , but Mrs. Garth said , gravely — "
176032	176033	176023	176024	Mr. Hanmer	462	" "
176049	176149	176150	176150	She	301	" said Alfred , rising from his chair , and pulling Mary 's head backward to kiss her . Mary coloured and laughed , but could not conceal that the tears were coming . Caleb , looking on over his spectacles , with the angles of his eyebrows falling , had an expression of mingled delight and sorrow as he returned to the opening of his letter ; and even Mrs. Garth , her lips curling with a calm contentment , allowed that inappropriate language to pass without correction , although Ben immediately took it up , and sang , "
176162	176273	176150	176150	She	301	" to a cantering measure , which he beat out with his fist on Mary 's arm . But Mrs. Garth 's eyes were now drawn towards her husband , who was already deep in the letter he was reading . His face had an expression of grave surprise , which alarmed her a little , but he did not like to be questioned while he was reading , and she remained anxiously watching till she saw him suddenly shaken by a little joyous laugh as he turned back to the beginning of the letter , and looking at her above his spectacles , said , in a low tone , "
176281	176424	176276	176276	you	3855	" She went and stood behind him , putting her hand on his shoulder , while they read the letter together . It was from Sir James Chettam , offering to Mr. Garth the management of the family estates at Freshitt and elsewhere , and adding that Sir James had been requested by Mr. Brooke of Tipton to ascertain whether Mr. Garth would be disposed at the same time to resume the agency of the Tipton property . The Baronet added in very obliging words that he himself was particularly desirous of seeing the Freshitt and Tipton estates under the same management , and he hoped to be able to show that the double agency might be held on terms agreeable to Mr. Garth , whom he would be glad to see at the Hall at twelve o'clock on the following day . "
176435	176467	176431	176431	he	3856	" said Caleb , turning his eyes upward to his wife , who raised her hand from his shoulder to his ear , while she rested her chin on his head . "
176481	176488	176475	176475	himself	175	" he continued , laughing silently . "
176499	176519	176520	176520	He	7387	" said Mrs. Garth , looking round at the five pair of eyes , all fixed on the parents . "
176554	176555	176581	176581	they	3860	" "
176561	176579	176581	176581	they	3860	" said Ben , riding on his chair , with a pleasant confidence that discipline was relaxed . "
176589	176633	176581	176581	they	3860	" said Letty , thinking of the Mayor and Corporation in their robes . Mrs. Garth patted Letty 's head and smiled , but seeing that her husband was gathering up his letters and likely soon to be out of reach in that sanctuary "
176636	176645	176581	176581	they	3860	" she pressed his shoulder and said emphatically — "
176656	176657	176654	176654	Caleb	441	" "
176661	176685	176654	176654	Caleb	441	" said Caleb , in a deep voice of assent , as if it would be unreasonable to suppose anything else of him . "
176700	176711	176712	176712	Mary	301	" Then with a little start of remembrance he said , "
176741	176902	176732	176732	Punch	589	" No manner could have been less like that of Punch triumphant than Caleb 's , but his talents did not lie in finding phrases , though he was very particular about his letter - writing , and regarded his wife as a treasury of correct language . There was almost an uproar among the children now , and Mary held up the cambric embroidery towards her mother entreatingly , that it might be put out of reach while the boys dragged her into a dance . Mrs. Garth , in placid joy , began to put the cups and plates together , while Caleb pushing his chair from the table , as if he were going to move to the desk , still sat holding his letters in his hand and looking on the ground meditatively , stretching out the fingers of his left hand , according to a mute language of his own . At last he said — "
176944	176963	176939	176939	my	0	" He fell into meditation and finger - rhetoric again for a little while , and then continued : "
177041	177042	177027	177031	A man without a family	3867	" "
177050	177060	177044	177044	you	0	" said his wife , lifting up her finger . "
177163	177199	177205	177205	God	274	" Here Caleb laid down his letters , thrust his fingers between the buttons of his waistcoat , and sat upright , but presently proceeded with some awe in his voice and moving his head slowly aside—"It
177209	177210	177207	177207	Susan	379	" "
177217	177226	177215	177215	Caleb	441	" said his wife , with answering fervor . "
177259	177493	177494	177494	I	0	" She could not say any more to him then about the pay . In the evening , when Caleb , rather tired with his day 's work , was seated in silence with his pocket - book open on his knee , while Mrs. Garth and Mary were at their sewing , and Letty in a corner was whispering a dialogue with her doll , Mr. Farebrother came up the orchard walk , dividing the bright August lights and shadows with the tufted grass and the apple - tree boughs . We know that he was fond of his parishioners the Garths , and had thought Mary worth mentioning to Lydgate . He used to the full the clergyman 's privilege of disregarding the Middlemarch discrimination of ranks , and always told his mother that Mrs. Garth was more of a lady than any matron in the town . Still , you see , he spent his evenings at the Vincys ' , where the matron , though less of a lady , presided over a well - lit drawing - room and whist . In those days human intercourse was not determined solely by respect . But the Vicar did heartily respect the Garths , and a visit from him was no surprise to that family . Nevertheless he accounted for it even while he was shaking hands , by saying , "
177525	177549	177550	177550	he	282	" he continued , as he seated himself and looked round with his bright glance at the three who were listening to him , "
177558	177576	177550	177550	he	282	" Mary 's heart beat rather quickly : she wondered how far Fred 's confidence had gone . "
177586	177590	177577	177577	We	3879	" said Caleb . "
177601	177602	177603	177603	He	1906	" "
177611	177616	177603	177603	He	1906	" said the Vicar , "
177755	177756	177758	177758	him	1906	" "
177766	177774	177775	177775	We	3891	" said Caleb , waving his hand . "
177799	177800	177796	177797	a Jew	3892	" "
177804	177814	177796	177797	a Jew	3892	" said Mrs. Garth , smiling at the Vicar , "
177835	177836	177831	177831	Mary	301	" "
177844	177849	177831	177831	Mary	301	" said Mr. Farebrother . "
177904	177922	177903	177905	Mr. Farebrother"—here Caleb	591	Farebrother"—here Caleb threw back his head a little , and spread his arms on the elbows of his chair—"that
178017	178051	178052	178052	I	0	" It was seldom that Caleb volunteered so long a speech , but his happiness had the effect of mountain air : his eyes were bright , and the words came without effort . "
178059	178064	178057	178057	Garth	443	" said the Vicar . "
178145	178146	178136	178137	his father	7545	" "
178152	178160	178136	178137	his father	7545	" said Mrs. Garth , rather coldly . "
178323	178330	178315	178316	Miss Garth	313	" ( Mr. Farebrother used to say "
178332	178335	178336	178337	Miss Garth	313	" instead of "
178339	178387	178336	178337	Miss Garth	313	" but it was part of his delicacy to treat her with the more deference because , according to Mrs. Vincy 's phrase , she worked for her bread . ) Mary felt uncomfortable , but , determined to take the matter lightly , answered at once , "
178404	178405	178406	178406	You	3909	" "
178445	178449	178443	178443	myself	0	" Caleb laughed . "
178459	178467	178452	178452	her	313	" he said , with some enjoyment . "
178474	178488	178472	178472	father	887	" said Mary , quickly , fearing that her mother would be displeased . "
178505	178506	178495	178495	Fred	282	" "
178517	178533	178534	178534	We	3916	" said Mrs. Garth , with whom speaking evil of dignities was a high misdemeanor . "
178553	178554	178545	178547	a ridiculous curate	3918	" "
178565	178578	178560	178560	she	313	" said Caleb , not disposed to have Mary 's sharpness undervalued . "
178594	178617	178560	178560	she	313	" he added , looking on the floor and moving his feet uneasily with a sense that words were scantier than thoughts . "
178620	178627	178560	178560	she	313	" said the Vicar , amused . "
178742	178743	178728	178729	Mrs. Garth	443	" "
178751	178759	178744	178744	I	0	" said Mrs. Garth , with decision . "
178781	178797	178772	178772	he	282	" At this point Mary went out of the room , taking Letty with her . "
178810	178820	178772	178772	he	282	" said Caleb , watching Mary close the door . "
179107	179108	179097	179097	she	379	" "
179129	179145	179118	179118	she	301	" said Mrs. Garth , pausing from her work , and looking at Mr. Farebrother . "
179178	179190	179147	179147	she	301	" The Vicar did not answer immediately , and Caleb said , "
179240	179241	179242	179242	I	0	" "
179253	179271	179245	179246	Mrs. Garth	443	" said Mr. Farebrother , who for some reason seemed more inclined to ruminate than to speak . "
179303	179304	179323	179323	Fred	282	" "
179309	179313	179323	179323	Fred	282	" said Caleb , "
179325	179326	179319	179319	You	0	" "
179349	179820	179331	179331	I	0	" Mr. Farebrother left the house soon after , and seeing Mary in the orchard with Letty , went to say good - by to her . They made a pretty picture in the western light which brought out the brightness of the apples on the old scant - leaved boughs — Mary in her lavender gingham and black ribbons holding a basket , while Letty in her well - worn nankin picked up the fallen apples . If you want to know more particularly how Mary looked , ten to one you will see a face like hers in the crowded street to - morrow , if you are there on the watch : she will not be among those daughters of Zion who are haughty , and walk with stretched - out necks and wanton eyes , mincing as they go : let all those pass , and fix your eyes on some small plump brownish person of firm but quiet carriage , who looks about her , but does not suppose that anybody is looking at her . If she has a broad face and square brow , well - marked eyebrows and curly dark hair , a certain expression of amusement in her glance which her mouth keeps the secret of , and for the rest features entirely insignificant — take that ordinary but not disagreeable person for a portrait of Mary Garth . If you made her smile , she would show you perfect little teeth ; if you made her angry , she would not raise her voice , but would probably say one of the bitterest things you have ever tasted the flavour of ; if you did her a kindness , she would never forget it . Mary admired the keen - faced handsome little Vicar in his well - brushed threadbare clothes more than any man she had had the opportunity of knowing . She had never heard him say a foolish thing , though she knew that he did unwise ones ; and perhaps foolish sayings were more objectionable to her than any of Mr. Farebrother 's unwise doings . At least , it was remarkable that the actual imperfections of the Vicar 's clerical character never seemed to call forth the same scorn and dislike which she showed beforehand for the predicted imperfections of the clerical character sustained by Fred Vincy . These irregularities of judgment , I imagine , are found even in riper minds than Mary Garth 's : our impartiality is kept for abstract merit and demerit , which none of us ever saw . Will any one guess towards which of those widely different men Mary had the peculiar woman 's tenderness?—the one she was most inclined to be severe on , or the contrary ? "
179833	179860	179830	179831	Miss Garth	313	" said the Vicar , as he took a fragrant apple from the basket which she held towards him , and put it in his pocket . "
179877	179878	179905	179906	a clergyman	816	" "
179881	179892	179905	179906	a clergyman	816	" said Mary , shaking her head , and smiling . "
179935	179936	179928	179928	he	3940	" "
180013	180014	180015	180015	I	0	" "
180026	180030	180015	180015	I	0	" said Mary . "
180079	180080	180066	180066	I	0	" "
180089	180332	180087	180087	Mary	301	" whispered Letty — a most inconvenient child , who listened to everything . But she was made exultant by having her chin pinched and her cheek kissed by Mr. Farebrother — an incident which she narrated to her mother and father . As the Vicar walked to Lowick , any one watching him closely might have seen him twice shrug his shoulders . I think that the rare Englishmen who have this gesture are never of the heavy type — for fear of any lumbering instance to the contrary , I will say , hardly ever ; they have usually a fine temperament and much tolerance towards the smaller errors of men ( themselves inclusive ) . The Vicar was holding an inward dialogue in which he told himself that there was probably something more between Fred and Mary Garth than the regard of old playfellows , and replied with a question whether that bit of womanhood were not a great deal too choice for that crude young gentleman . The rejoinder to this was the first shrug . Then he laughed at himself for being likely to have felt jealous , as if he had been a man able to marry , which , added he , it is as clear as any balance - sheet that I am not . Whereupon followed the second shrug . What could two men , so different from each other , see in this "
180336	180430	180431	180431	Susan	379	" as Mary called herself ? It was certainly not her plainness that attracted them ( and let all plain young ladies be warned against the dangerous encouragement given them by Society to confide in their want of beauty ) . A human being in this aged nation of ours is a very wonderful whole , the slow creation of long interchanging influences : and charm is a result of two such wholes , the one loving and the one loved . When Mr. and Mrs. Garth were sitting alone , Caleb said , "
180440	180441	180431	180431	Susan	379	" "
180447	180460	180431	180431	Susan	379	" said Mrs. Garth , smiling at him , above her knitting , "
180472	180473	180431	180431	Susan	379	" "
180476	180482	180431	180431	Susan	379	" said Caleb , gravely ; "

180587	180594	180566	180566	you	3950	" said Mrs. Garth , decidedly . "
180602	180621	180622	180623	The lad	1906	" said Caleb , with a sturdiness which he was apt to show when he had an opinion . "
180667	180668	180671	180671	he	1906	" "
180726	180727	180715	180716	Mrs. Vincy	290	" "
180746	180753	180715	180716	Mrs. Vincy	290	" said Caleb , with disgust . "
180768	180769	180766	180766	Caleb	446	" "
180795	180817	180829	180829	fools	3959	" said Caleb , with fervor , putting out his hand and moving it up and down to mark his emphasis , "
180851	180852	180853	180853	I	0	" "
180868	180895	180866	180866	Caleb	446	" said Mrs. Garth , who was a firm woman , but knew that there were some points on which her mild husband was yet firmer . "
180960	180961	180942	180942	you	0	" "
181056	181117	181051	181051	you	3964	" said Caleb , taking a pinch of snuff and holding it up between his fingers , as if it were a part of his exposition . He was fond of a pinch when it occurred to him , but he usually forgot that this indulgence was at his command . His wife held down her knitting and looked attentive . "
181163	181164	181157	181157	I	0	" "
181186	181191	181192	181192	Deuce	463	" said Mrs. Garth . "
181195	181215	181192	181192	Deuce	463	" said Caleb , who never referred the knowledge of discreditable doings to any higher power than the deuce . "
181253	181268	181217	181217	Bulstrode	274	" Caleb scattered his snuff carefully instead of taking it , and then added , "
181379	181380	181366	181368	The old man	1768	" "
181400	181405	181384	181386	the miserable creature	3974	" said Mrs. Garth . "
181425	181446	181423	181423	man	1193	" said Caleb , with the deep tone and grave shake of the head which always came when he used this phrase—"The
181479	181627	182487	182487	Josh	528	" It was one of Caleb 's quaintnesses , that in his difficulty of finding speech for his thought , he caught , as it were , snatches of diction which he associated with various points of view or states of mind ; and whenever he had a feeling of awe , he was haunted by a sense of Biblical phraseology , though he could hardly have given a strict quotation . The transactions referred to by Caleb Garth as having gone forward between Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Joshua Rigg Featherstone concerning the land attached to Stone Court , had occasioned the interchange of a letter or two between these personages . Who shall tell what may be the effect of writing ? If it happens to have been cut in stone , though it lie face down - most for ages on a forsaken beach , or "
181639	182170	182487	182487	Josh	528	" it may end by letting us into the secret of usurpations and other scandals gossiped about long empires ago:—this world being apparently a huge whispering - gallery . Such conditions are often minutely represented in our petty lifetimes . As the stone which has been kicked by generations of clowns may come by curious little links of effect under the eyes of a scholar , through whose labours it may at last fix the date of invasions and unlock religions , so a bit of ink and paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stop - gap may at last be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge enough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe . To Uriel watching the progress of planetary history from the sun , the one result would be just as much of a coincidence as the other . Having made this rather lofty comparison I am less uneasy in calling attention to the existence of low people by whose interference , however little we may like it , the course of the world is very much determined . It would be well , certainly , if we could help to reduce their number , and something might perhaps be done by not lightly giving occasion to their existence . Socially speaking , Joshua Rigg would have been generally pronounced a superfluity . But those who like Peter Featherstone never had a copy of themselves demanded , are the very last to wait for such a request either in prose or verse . The copy in this case bore more of outside resemblance to the mother , in whose sex frog - features , accompanied with fresh - coloured cheeks and a well - rounded figure , are compatible with much charm for a certain order of admirers . The result is sometimes a frog - faced male , desirable , surely , to no order of intelligent beings . Especially when he is suddenly brought into evidence to frustrate other people 's expectations — the very lowest aspect in which a social superfluity can present himself . But Mr. Rigg Featherstone 's low characteristics were all of the sober , water - drinking kind . From the earliest to the latest hour of the day he was always as sleek , neat , and cool as the frog he resembled , and old Peter had secretly chuckled over an offshoot almost more calculating , and far more imperturbable , than himself . I will add that his finger - nails were scrupulously attended to , and that he meant to marry a well - educated young lady ( as yet unspecified ) whose person was good , and whose connections , in a solid middle - class way , were undeniable . Thus his nails and modesty were comparable to those of most gentlemen ; though his ambition had been educated only by the opportunities of a clerk and accountant in the smaller commercial houses of a seaport . He thought the rural Featherstones very simple absurd people , and they in their turn regarded his "
182173	182482	182487	182487	Josh	528	" in a seaport town as an exaggeration of the monstrosity that their brother Peter , and still more Peter 's property , should have had such belongings . The garden and gravel approach , as seen from the two windows of the wainscoted parlor at Stone Court , were never in better trim than now , when Mr. Rigg Featherstone stood , with his hands behind him , looking out on these grounds as their master . But it seemed doubtful whether he looked out for the sake of contemplation or of turning his back to a person who stood in the middle of the room , with his legs considerably apart and his hands in his trouser - pockets : a person in all respects a contrast to the sleek and cool Rigg . He was a man obviously on the way towards sixty , very florid and hairy , with much gray in his bushy whiskers and thick curly hair , a stoutish body which showed to disadvantage the somewhat worn joinings of his clothes , and the air of a swaggerer , who would aim at being noticeable even at a show of fireworks , regarding his own remarks on any other person 's performance as likely to be more interesting than the performance itself . His name was John Raffles , and he sometimes wrote jocosely W.A.G. after his signature , observing when he did so , that he was once taught by Leonard Lamb of Finsbury who wrote B.A. after his name , and that he , Raffles , originated the witticism of calling that celebrated principal Ba - Lamb . Such were the appearance and mental flavour of Mr. Raffles , both of which seemed to have a stale odor of travellers ' rooms in the commercial hotels of that period . "
182489	182500	182487	182487	Josh	528	" he was saying , in a full rumbling tone , "
182532	182533	182521	182521	you	528	" "
182548	182558	182560	182560	I	0	" returned Rigg , in his cool high voice . "
182568	182569	182570	182570	You	528	" "
182790	182791	182788	182788	Jove	599	" "
182796	182810	182793	182793	you	0	" said Mr. Rigg , quietly , without looking away from the window . "
182817	182843	182793	182793	you	0	" said Raffles , taking hold of his hat which stood before him on the table , and giving it a sort of oratorical push . "
183044	183153	183039	183040	the wagoner	3998	" As Rigg pronounced the last words he turned round and looked at Raffles with his prominent frozen eyes . The contrast was as striking as it could have been eighteen years before , when Rigg was a most unengaging kickable boy , and Raffles was the rather thick - set Adonis of bar - rooms and back - parlors . But the advantage now was on the side of Rigg , and auditors of this conversation might probably have expected that Raffles would retire with the air of a defeated dog . Not at all . He made a grimace which was habitual with him whenever he was "
183155	183176	183039	183040	the wagoner	3998	" in a game ; then subsided into a laugh , and drew a brandy - flask from his pocket . "
183181	183190	183179	183179	Josh	528	" he said , in a cajoling tone , "
183225	183226	183227	183227	Mind	600	" "
183229	183240	183227	183227	Mind	600	" said Rigg , drawing out a bunch of keys , "
183299	183300	183291	183297	a spiteful , brassy , bullying rogue	4000	" "
183310	183330	183308	183308	Josh	528	" said Raffles , affecting to scratch his head and wrinkle his brows upward as if he were nonplussed . "
183377	183545	183371	183372	the sovereign	4002	" He jerked forward the flask and Rigg went to a fine old oaken bureau with his keys . But Raffles had reminded himself by his movement with the flask that it had become dangerously loose from its leather covering , and catching sight of a folded paper which had fallen within the fender , he took it up and shoved it under the leather so as to make the glass firm . By that time Rigg came forward with a brandy - bottle , filled the flask , and handed Raffles a sovereign , neither looking at him nor speaking to him . After locking up the bureau again , he walked to the window and gazed out as impassibly as he had done at the beginning of the interview , while Raffles took a small allowance from the flask , screwed it up , and deposited it in his side - pocket , with provoking slowness , making a grimace at his stepson 's back . "
183554	184169	183548	183548	Josh	528	" said Raffles , turning back his head as he opened the door . Rigg saw him leave the grounds and enter the lane . The gray day had turned to a light drizzling rain , which freshened the hedgerows and the grassy borders of the by - roads , and hastened the labourers who were loading the last shocks of corn . Raffles , walking with the uneasy gait of a town loiterer obliged to do a bit of country journeying on foot , looked as incongruous amid this moist rural quiet and industry as if he had been a baboon escaped from a menagerie . But there were none to stare at him except the long - weaned calves , and none to show dislike of his appearance except the little water - rats which rustled away at his approach . He was fortunate enough when he got on to the highroad to be overtaken by the stage - coach , which carried him to Brassing ; and there he took the new - made railway , observing to his fellow - passengers that he considered it pretty well seasoned now it had done for Huskisson . Mr. Raffles on most occasions kept up the sense of having been educated at an academy , and being able , if he chose , to pass well everywhere ; indeed , there was not one of his fellow - men whom he did not feel himself in a position to ridicule and torment , confident of the entertainment which he thus gave to all the rest of the company . He played this part now with as much spirit as if his journey had been entirely successful , resorting at frequent intervals to his flask . The paper with which he had wedged it was a letter signed Nicholas Bulstrode , but Raffles was not likely to disturb it from its present useful position . One of the professional calls made by Lydgate soon after his return from his wedding - journey was to Lowick Manor , in consequence of a letter which had requested him to fix a time for his visit . Mr. Casaubon had never put any question concerning the nature of his illness to Lydgate , nor had he even to Dorothea betrayed any anxiety as to how far it might be likely to cut short his labours or his life . On this point , as on all others , he shrank from pity ; and if the suspicion of being pitied for anything in his lot surmised or known in spite of himself was embittering , the idea of calling forth a show of compassion by frankly admitting an alarm or a sorrow was necessarily intolerable to him . Every proud mind knows something of this experience , and perhaps it is only to be overcome by a sense of fellowship deep enough to make all efforts at isolation seem mean and petty instead of exalting . But Mr. Casaubon was now brooding over something through which the question of his health and life haunted his silence with a more harassing importunity even than through the autumnal unripeness of his authorship . It is true that this last might be called his central ambition ; but there are some kinds of authorship in which by far the largest result is the uneasy susceptibility accumulated in the consciousness of the author — one knows of the river by a few streaks amid a long - gathered deposit of uncomfortable mud . That was the way with Mr. Casaubon 's hard intellectual labours . Their most characteristic result was not the "
184175	185603	183548	183548	Josh	528	" but a morbid consciousness that others did not give him the place which he had not demonstrably merited — a perpetual suspicious conjecture that the views entertained of him were not to his advantage — a melancholy absence of passion in his efforts at achievement , and a passionate resistance to the confession that he had achieved nothing . Thus his intellectual ambition which seemed to others to have absorbed and dried him , was really no security against wounds , least of all against those which came from Dorothea . And he had begun now to frame possibilities for the future which were somehow more embittering to him than anything his mind had dwelt on before . Against certain facts he was helpless : against Will Ladislaw 's existence , his defiant stay in the neighborhood of Lowick , and his flippant state of mind with regard to the possessors of authentic , well - stamped erudition : against Dorothea 's nature , always taking on some new shape of ardent activity , and even in submission and silence covering fervid reasons which it was an irritation to think of : against certain notions and likings which had taken possession of her mind in relation to subjects that he could not possibly discuss with her . There was no denying that Dorothea was as virtuous and lovely a young lady as he could have obtained for a wife ; but a young lady turned out to be something more troublesome than he had conceived . She nursed him , she read to him , she anticipated his wants , and was solicitous about his feelings ; but there had entered into the husband 's mind the certainty that she judged him , and that her wifely devotedness was like a penitential expiation of unbelieving thoughts — was accompanied with a power of comparison by which himself and his doings were seen too luminously as a part of things in general . His discontent passed vapor - like through all her gentle loving manifestations , and clung to that inappreciative world which she had only brought nearer to him . Poor Mr. Casaubon ! This suffering was the harder to bear because it seemed like a betrayal : the young creature who had worshipped him with perfect trust had quickly turned into the critical wife ; and early instances of criticism and resentment had made an impression which no tenderness and submission afterwards could remove . To his suspicious interpretation Dorothea 's silence now was a suppressed rebellion ; a remark from her which he had not in any way anticipated was an assertion of conscious superiority ; her gentle answers had an irritating cautiousness in them ; and when she acquiesced it was a self - approved effort of forbearance . The tenacity with which he strove to hide this inward drama made it the more vivid for him ; as we hear with the more keenness what we wish others not to hear . Instead of wondering at this result of misery in Mr. Casaubon , I think it quite ordinary . Will not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot out the glory of the world , and leave only a margin by which we see the blot ? I know no speck so troublesome as self . And who , if Mr. Casaubon had chosen to expound his discontents — his suspicions that he was not any longer adored without criticism — could have denied that they were founded on good reasons ? On the contrary , there was a strong reason to be added , which he had not himself taken explicitly into account — namely , that he was not unmixedly adorable . He suspected this , however , as he suspected other things , without confessing it , and like the rest of us , felt how soothing it would have been to have a companion who would never find it out . This sore susceptibility in relation to Dorothea was thoroughly prepared before Will Ladislaw had returned to Lowick , and what had occurred since then had brought Mr. Casaubon 's power of suspicious construction into exasperated activity . To all the facts which he knew , he added imaginary facts both present and future which became more real to him than those because they called up a stronger dislike , a more predominating bitterness . Suspicion and jealousy of Will Ladislaw 's intentions , suspicion and jealousy of Dorothea 's impressions , were constantly at their weaving work . It would be quite unjust to him to suppose that he could have entered into any coarse misinterpretation of Dorothea : his own habits of mind and conduct , quite as much as the open elevation of her nature , saved him from any such mistake . What he was jealous of was her opinion , the sway that might be given to her ardent mind in its judgments , and the future possibilities to which these might lead her . As to Will , though until his last defiant letter he had nothing definite which he would choose formally to allege against him , he felt himself warranted in believing that he was capable of any design which could fascinate a rebellious temper and an undisciplined impulsiveness . He was quite sure that Dorothea was the cause of Will 's return from Rome , and his determination to settle in the neighborhood ; and he was penetrating enough to imagine that Dorothea had innocently encouraged this course . It was as clear as possible that she was ready to be attached to Will and to be pliant to his suggestions : they had never had a tete - a - tete without her bringing away from it some new troublesome impression , and the last interview that Mr. Casaubon was aware of ( Dorothea , on returning from Freshitt Hall , had for the first time been silent about having seen Will ) had led to a scene which roused an angrier feeling against them both than he had ever known before . Dorothea 's outpouring of her notions about money , in the darkness of the night , had done nothing but bring a mixture of more odious foreboding into her husband 's mind . And there was the shock lately given to his health always sadly present with him . He was certainly much revived ; he had recovered all his usual power of work : the illness might have been mere fatigue , and there might still be twenty years of achievement before him , which would justify the thirty years of preparation . That prospect was made the sweeter by a flavour of vengeance against the hasty sneers of Carp & Company ; for even when Mr. Casaubon was carrying his taper among the tombs of the past , those modern figures came athwart the dim light , and interrupted his diligent exploration . To convince Carp of his mistake , so that he would have to eat his own words with a good deal of indigestion , would be an agreeable accident of triumphant authorship , which the prospect of living to future ages on earth and to all eternity in heaven could not exclude from contemplation . Since , thus , the prevision of his own unending bliss could not nullify the bitter savours of irritated jealousy and vindictiveness , it is the less surprising that the probability of a transient earthly bliss for other persons , when he himself should have entered into glory , had not a potently sweetening effect . If the truth should be that some undermining disease was at work within him , there might be large opportunity for some people to be the happier when he was gone ; and if one of those people should be Will Ladislaw , Mr. Casaubon objected so strongly that it seemed as if the annoyance would make part of his disembodied existence . This is a very bare and therefore a very incomplete way of putting the case . The human soul moves in many channels , and Mr. Casaubon , we know , had a sense of rectitude and an honourable pride in satisfying the requirements of honour , which compelled him to find other reasons for his conduct than those of jealousy and vindictiveness . The way in which Mr. Casaubon put the case was this:—"In
185986	186086	185973	185973	my	0	" The arrangements made by Mr. Casaubon on his marriage left strong measures open to him , but in ruminating on them his mind inevitably dwelt so much on the probabilities of his own life that the longing to get the nearest possible calculation had at last overcome his proud reticence , and had determined him to ask Lydgate 's opinion as to the nature of his illness . He had mentioned to Dorothea that Lydgate was coming by appointment at half - past three , and in answer to her anxious question , whether he had felt ill , replied,—"No
186136	186287	186288	186289	Poor fellow	2012	" When Lydgate entered the Yew - tree Walk he saw Mr. Casaubon slowly receding with his hands behind him according to his habit , and his head bent forward . It was a lovely afternoon ; the leaves from the lofty limes were falling silently across the sombre evergreens , while the lights and shadows slept side by side : there was no sound but the cawing of the rooks , which to the accustomed ear is a lullaby , or that last solemn lullaby , a dirge . Lydgate , conscious of an energetic frame in its prime , felt some compassion when the figure which he was likely soon to overtake turned round , and in advancing towards him showed more markedly than ever the signs of premature age — the student 's bent shoulders , the emaciated limbs , and the melancholy lines of the mouth . "
186291	186295	186288	186289	Poor fellow	2012	" he thought , "
186319	186320	186321	186322	Mr. Lydgate	278	" "
186324	186335	186321	186322	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Mr. Casaubon , with his invariably polite air , "
186363	186364	186350	186350	you	278	" "
186382	186391	186365	186365	I	0	" said Lydgate , filling up a pause . "
186521	186706	186707	186707	You	4013	" Here Mr. Casaubon paused , removed one hand from his back and thrust it between the buttons of his single - breasted coat . To a mind largely instructed in the human destiny hardly anything could be more interesting than the inward conflict implied in his formal measured address , delivered with the usual sing - song and motion of the head . Nay , are there many situations more sublimely tragic than the struggle of the soul with the demand to renounce a work which has been all the significance of its life — a significance which is to vanish as the waters which come and go where no man has need of them ? But there was nothing to strike others as sublime about Mr. Casaubon , and Lydgate , who had some contempt at hand for futile scholarship , felt a little amusement mingling with his pity . He was at present too ill acquainted with disaster to enter into the pathos of a lot where everything is below the level of tragedy except the passionate egoism of the sufferer . "
186718	186740	186741	186741	I	0	" he said , wishing to help forward Mr. Casaubon 's purpose , which seemed to be clogged by some hesitation . "
186857	186858	186860	186860	I	0	" "
186870	186874	186860	186860	I	0	" said Lydgate ; "
186929	186938	186939	186939	I	0	" Mr. Casaubon winced perceptibly , but bowed . "
187075	187107	187108	187108	I	0	" Lydgate 's instinct was fine enough to tell him that plain speech , quite free from ostentatious caution , would be felt by Mr. Casaubon as a tribute of respect . "
187115	187126	187110	187110	you	0	" said Mr. Casaubon , after a moment 's pause . "
187149	187150	187137	187137	you	0	" "
187162	187196	187153	187153	I	0	" Lydgate was going to explain why he had told Dorothea , but Mr. Casaubon , with an unmistakable desire to end the conversation , waved his hand slightly , and said again , "
187201	187367	187199	187199	you	0	" proceeding to remark on the rare beauty of the day . Lydgate , certain that his patient wished to be alone , soon left him ; and the black figure with hands behind and head bent forward continued to pace the walk where the dark yew - trees gave him a mute companionship in melancholy , and the little shadows of bird or leaf that fleeted across the isles of sunlight , stole along in silence as in the presence of a sorrow . Here was a man who now for the first time found himself looking into the eyes of death — who was passing through one of those rare moments of experience when we feel the truth of a commonplace , which is as different from what we call knowing it , as the vision of waters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the water which can not be had to cool the burning tongue . When the commonplace "
187372	187380	187381	187381	I	0	" transforms itself suddenly into the acute consciousness "
187388	188015	187381	187381	I	0	" then death grapples us , and his fingers are cruel ; afterwards , he may come to fold us in his arms as our mother did , and our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be like the first . To Mr. Casaubon now , it was as if he suddenly found himself on the dark river - brink and heard the plash of the oncoming oar , not discerning the forms , but expecting the summons . In such an hour the mind does not change its lifelong bias , but carries it onward in imagination to the other side of death , gazing backward — perhaps with the divine calm of beneficence , perhaps with the petty anxieties of self - assertion . What was Mr. Casaubon 's bias his acts will give us a clew to . He held himself to be , with some private scholarly reservations , a believing Christian , as to estimates of the present and hopes of the future . But what we strive to gratify , though we may call it a distant hope , is an immediate desire : the future estate for which men drudge up city alleys exists already in their imagination and love . And Mr. Casaubon 's immediate desire was not for divine communion and light divested of earthly conditions ; his passionate longings , poor man , clung low and mist - like in very shady places . Dorothea had been aware when Lydgate had ridden away , and she had stepped into the garden , with the impulse to go at once to her husband . But she hesitated , fearing to offend him by obtruding herself ; for her ardor , continually repulsed , served , with her intense memory , to heighten her dread , as thwarted energy subsides into a shudder ; and she wandered slowly round the nearer clumps of trees until she saw him advancing . Then she went towards him , and might have represented a heaven - sent angel coming with a promise that the short hours remaining should yet be filled with that faithful love which clings the closer to a comprehended grief . His glance in reply to hers was so chill that she felt her timidity increased ; yet she turned and passed her hand through his arm . Mr. Casaubon kept his hands behind him and allowed her pliant arm to cling with difficulty against his rigid arm . There was something horrible to Dorothea in the sensation which this unresponsive hardness inflicted on her . That is a strong word , but not too strong : it is in these acts called trivialities that the seeds of joy are forever wasted , until men and women look round with haggard faces at the devastation their own waste has made , and say , the earth bears no harvest of sweetness — calling their denial knowledge . You may ask why , in the name of manliness , Mr. Casaubon should have behaved in that way . Consider that his was a mind which shrank from pity : have you ever watched in such a mind the effect of a suspicion that what is pressing it as a grief may be really a source of contentment , either actual or future , to the being who already offends by pitying ? Besides , he knew little of Dorothea 's sensations , and had not reflected that on such an occasion as the present they were comparable in strength to his own sensibilities about Carp 's criticisms . Dorothea did not withdraw her arm , but she could not venture to speak . Mr. Casaubon did not say , "
188022	188189	188016	188016	I	0	" but he directed his steps in silence towards the house , and as they entered by the glass door on this eastern side , Dorothea withdrew her arm and lingered on the matting , that she might leave her husband quite free . He entered the library and shut himself in , alone with his sorrow . She went up to her boudoir . The open bow - window let in the serene glory of the afternoon lying in the avenue , where the lime - trees cast long shadows . But Dorothea knew nothing of the scene . She threw herself on a chair , not heeding that she was in the dazzling sun - rays : if there were discomfort in that , how could she tell that it was not part of her inward misery ? She was in the reaction of a rebellious anger stronger than any she had felt since her marriage . Instead of tears there came words : — "
188236	188332	188230	188230	he	4016	" She began to hear herself , and was checked into stillness . Like one who has lost his way and is weary , she sat and saw as in one glance all the paths of her young hope which she should never find again . And just as clearly in the miserable light she saw her own and her husband 's solitude — how they walked apart so that she was obliged to survey him . If he had drawn her towards him , she would never have surveyed him — never have said , "
188339	188358	188230	188230	he	4016	" but would have felt him simply a part of her own life . Now she said bitterly , "
188367	188645	188230	188230	he	4016	" In the jar of her whole being , Pity was overthrown . Was it her fault that she had believed in him — had believed in his worthiness?—And what , exactly , was he ? — She was able enough to estimate him — she who waited on his glances with trembling , and shut her best soul in prison , paying it only hidden visits , that she might be petty enough to please him . In such a crisis as this , some women begin to hate . The sun was low when Dorothea was thinking that she would not go down again , but would send a message to her husband saying that she was not well and preferred remaining up - stairs . She had never deliberately allowed her resentment to govern her in this way before , but she believed now that she could not see him again without telling him the truth about her feeling , and she must wait till she could do it without interruption . He might wonder and be hurt at her message . It was good that he should wonder and be hurt . Her anger said , as anger is apt to say , that God was with her — that all heaven , though it were crowded with spirits watching them , must be on her side . She had determined to ring her bell , when there came a rap at the door . Mr. Casaubon had sent to say that he would have his dinner in the library . He wished to be quite alone this evening , being much occupied . "
188655	188656	188653	188653	Tantripp	215	" "
188669	188670	188662	188662	me	0	" "
188694	188998	188999	188999	Dorothea	189	" Dorothea sat almost motionless in her meditative struggle , while the evening slowly deepened into night . But the struggle changed continually , as that of a man who begins with a movement towards striking and ends with conquering his desire to strike . The energy that would animate a crime is not more than is wanted to inspire a resolved submission , when the noble habit of the soul reasserts itself . That thought with which Dorothea had gone out to meet her husband — her conviction that he had been asking about the possible arrest of all his work , and that the answer must have wrung his heart , could not be long without rising beside the image of him , like a shadowy monitor looking at her anger with sad remonstrance . It cost her a litany of pictured sorrows and of silent cries that she might be the mercy for those sorrows — but the resolved submission did come ; and when the house was still , and she knew that it was near the time when Mr. Casaubon habitually went to rest , she opened her door gently and stood outside in the darkness waiting for his coming up - stairs with a light in his hand . If he did not come soon she thought that she would go down and even risk incurring another pang . She would never again expect anything else . But she did hear the library door open , and slowly the light advanced up the staircase without noise from the footsteps on the carpet . When her husband stood opposite to her , she saw that his face was more haggard . He started slightly on seeing her , and she looked up at him beseechingly , without speaking . "
189001	189013	188999	188999	Dorothea	189	" he said , with a gentle surprise in his tone . "
189020	189021	189015	189015	you	189	" "
189032	189033	189015	189015	you	189	" "
189055	189345	189041	189041	You	189	" When the kind quiet melancholy of that speech fell on Dorothea 's ears , she felt something like the thankfulness that might well up in us if we had narrowly escaped hurting a lamed creature . She put her hand into her husband 's , and they went along the broad corridor together . Dorothea seldom left home without her husband , but she did occasionally drive into Middlemarch alone , on little errands of shopping or charity such as occur to every lady of any wealth when she lives within three miles of a town . Two days after that scene in the Yew - tree Walk , she determined to use such an opportunity in order if possible to see Lydgate , and learn from him whether her husband had really felt any depressing change of symptoms which he was concealing from her , and whether he had insisted on knowing the utmost about himself . She felt almost guilty in asking for knowledge about him from another , but the dread of being without it — the dread of that ignorance which would make her unjust or hard — overcame every scruple . That there had been some crisis in her husband 's mind she was certain : he had the very next day begun a new method of arranging his notes , and had associated her quite newly in carrying out his plan . Poor Dorothea needed to lay up stores of patience . It was about four o'clock when she drove to Lydgate 's house in Lowick Gate , wishing , in her immediate doubt of finding him at home , that she had written beforehand . And he was not at home . "
189352	189385	189347	189348	Mrs. Lydgate	604	" said Dorothea , who had never , that she knew of , seen Rosamond , but now remembered the fact of the marriage . Yes , Mrs. Lydgate was at home . "
189420	189951	189412	189413	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" When the servant had gone to deliver that message , Dorothea could hear sounds of music through an open window — a few notes from a man 's voice and then a piano bursting into roulades . But the roulades broke off suddenly , and then the servant came back saying that Mrs. Lydgate would be happy to see Mrs. Casaubon . When the drawing - room door opened and Dorothea entered , there was a sort of contrast not infrequent in country life when the habits of the different ranks were less blent than now . Let those who know , tell us exactly what stuff it was that Dorothea wore in those days of mild autumn — that thin white woollen stuff soft to the touch and soft to the eye . It always seemed to have been lately washed , and to smell of the sweet hedges — was always in the shape of a pelisse with sleeves hanging all out of the fashion . Yet if she had entered before a still audience as Imogene or Cato 's daughter , the dress might have seemed right enough : the grace and dignity were in her limbs and neck ; and about her simply parted hair and candid eyes the large round poke which was then in the fate of women , seemed no more odd as a head - dress than the gold trencher we call a halo . By the present audience of two persons , no dramatic heroine could have been expected with more interest than Mrs. Casaubon . To Rosamond she was one of those county divinities not mixing with Middlemarch mortality , whose slightest marks of manner or appearance were worthy of her study ; moreover , Rosamond was not without satisfaction that Mrs. Casaubon should have an opportunity of studying her . What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the best judges ? and since Rosamond had received the highest compliments at Sir Godwin Lydgate 's , she felt quite confident of the impression she must make on people of good birth . Dorothea put out her hand with her usual simple kindness , and looked admiringly at Lydgate 's lovely bride — aware that there was a gentleman standing at a distance , but seeing him merely as a coated figure at a wide angle . The gentleman was too much occupied with the presence of the one woman to reflect on the contrast between the two — a contrast that would certainly have been striking to a calm observer . They were both tall , and their eyes were on a level ; but imagine Rosamond 's infantine blondness and wondrous crown of hair - plaits , with her pale - blue dress of a fit and fashion so perfect that no dressmaker could look at it without emotion , a large embroidered collar which it was to be hoped all beholders would know the price of , her small hands duly set off with rings , and that controlled self - consciousness of manner which is the expensive substitute for simplicity . "
189963	189969	189953	189953	you	4023	" said Dorothea , immediately . "
190016	190017	190018	190018	He	278	" "
190025	190029	190018	190018	He	278	" said Rosamond ; "
190048	190049	190042	190042	I	0	" "
190059	190097	190051	190051	you	4023	" said Will Ladislaw , coming forward . He had already taken up his hat before Dorothea entered . She coloured with surprise , but put out her hand with a smile of unmistakable pleasure , saying — "
190115	190116	190106	190106	I	0	" "
190134	190138	190125	190126	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Will . "
190150	190154	190156	190156	you	0	" said Dorothea , "
190169	190196	190156	190156	you	0	" Will was moving to the door when Dorothea , whose mind had flashed in an instant over many connected memories , turned quickly and said , "
190243	190580	190241	190241	you	0	" Her mind was evidently arrested by some sudden thought , and she left the room hardly conscious of what was immediately around her — hardly conscious that Will opened the door for her and offered her his arm to lead her to the carriage . She took the arm but said nothing . Will was feeling rather vexed and miserable , and found nothing to say on his side . He handed her into the carriage in silence , they said good - by , and Dorothea drove away . In the five minutes ' drive to the Hospital she had time for some reflections that were quite new to her . Her decision to go , and her preoccupation in leaving the room , had come from the sudden sense that there would be a sort of deception in her voluntarily allowing any further intercourse between herself and Will which she was unable to mention to her husband , and already her errand in seeking Lydgate was a matter of concealment . That was all that had been explicitly in her mind ; but she had been urged also by a vague discomfort . Now that she was alone in her drive , she heard the notes of the man 's voice and the accompanying piano , which she had not noted much at the time , returning on her inward sense ; and she found herself thinking with some wonder that Will Ladislaw was passing his time with Mrs. Lydgate in her husband 's absence . And then she could not help remembering that he had passed some time with her under like circumstances , so why should there be any unfitness in the fact ? But Will was Mr. Casaubon 's relative , and one towards whom she was bound to show kindness . Still there had been signs which perhaps she ought to have understood as implying that Mr. Casaubon did not like his cousin 's visits during his own absence . "
190590	191119	190582	190582	I	0	" said poor Dorothea to herself , while the tears came rolling and she had to dry them quickly . She felt confusedly unhappy , and the image of Will which had been so clear to her before was mysteriously spoiled . But the carriage stopped at the gate of the Hospital . She was soon walking round the grass plots with Lydgate , and her feelings recovered the strong bent which had made her seek for this interview . Will Ladislaw , meanwhile , was mortified , and knew the reason of it clearly enough . His chances of meeting Dorothea were rare ; and here for the first time there had come a chance which had set him at a disadvantage . It was not only , as it had been hitherto , that she was not supremely occupied with him , but that she had seen him under circumstances in which he might appear not to be supremely occupied with her . He felt thrust to a new distance from her , amongst the circles of Middlemarchers who made no part of her life . But that was not his fault : of course , since he had taken his lodgings in the town , he had been making as many acquaintances as he could , his position requiring that he should know everybody and everything . Lydgate was really better worth knowing than any one else in the neighborhood , and he happened to have a wife who was musical and altogether worth calling upon . Here was the whole history of the situation in which Diana had descended too unexpectedly on her worshipper . It was mortifying . Will was conscious that he should not have been at Middlemarch but for Dorothea ; and yet his position there was threatening to divide him from her with those barriers of habitual sentiment which are more fatal to the persistence of mutual interest than all the distance between Rome and Britain . Prejudices about rank and status were easy enough to defy in the form of a tyrannical letter from Mr. Casaubon ; but prejudices , like odorous bodies , have a double existence both solid and subtle — solid as the pyramids , subtle as the twentieth echo of an echo , or as the memory of hyacinths which once scented the darkness . And Will was of a temperament to feel keenly the presence of subtleties : a man of clumsier perceptions would not have felt , as he did , that for the first time some sense of unfitness in perfect freedom with him had sprung up in Dorothea 's mind , and that their silence , as he conducted her to the carriage , had had a chill in it . Perhaps Casaubon , in his hatred and jealousy , had been insisting to Dorothea that Will had slid below her socially . Confound Casaubon ! Will re - entered the drawing - room , took up his hat , and looking irritated as he advanced towards Mrs. Lydgate , who had seated herself at her work - table , said — "
191150	191151	191152	191152	I	0	" "
191160	191164	191152	191152	I	0	" said Rosamond . "
191201	191202	191198	191198	she	276	" "
191211	191217	191198	191198	she	276	" said Will , sulkily . "
191253	191254	191255	191255	Herself	276	" "
191257	191270	191255	191255	Herself	276	" said Will , not indisposed to provoke the charming Mrs. Lydgate . "
191292	191293	191294	191294	I	0	" "
191304	191316	191317	191317	He	300	" said Rosamond , dimpling , and speaking with aery lightness . "
191327	191328	191317	191317	He	300	" "
191357	191358	191342	191343	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" "
191376	191377	191371	191371	her	276	" "
191380	191387	191371	191371	her	276	" said Will , almost pettishly . "
191419	191420	191412	191412	I	0	" "
191447	191475	191476	191477	Mr. Ladislaw	261	" When her husband was at home again , Rosamond said , standing in front of him and holding his coat - collar with both her hands , "
191524	191525	191536	191536	he	261	" "
191556	191557	191548	191548	he	261	" "
191573	191574	191569	191569	you	278	" "
191597	191598	191600	191600	you	278	" "
191610	191611	191612	191613	Poor devil	4048	" "
191615	191836	191837	191838	Poor devil	4048	" said Lydgate , smiling and pinching his wife 's ears . Rosamond felt herself beginning to know a great deal of the world , especially in discovering what when she was in her unmarried girlhood had been inconceivable to her except as a dim tragedy in by - gone costumes — that women , even after marriage , might make conquests and enslave men . At that time young ladies in the country , even when educated at Mrs. Lemon 's , read little French literature later than Racine , and public prints had not cast their present magnificent illumination over the scandals of life . Still , vanity , with a woman 's whole mind and day to work in , can construct abundantly on slight hints , especially on such a hint as the possibility of indefinite conquests . How delightful to make captives from the throne of marriage with a husband as crown - prince by your side — himself in fact a subject — while the captives look up forever hopeless , losing their rest probably , and if their appetite too , so much the better ! But Rosamond 's romance turned at present chiefly on her crown - prince , and it was enough to enjoy his assured subjection . When he said , "
191840	191848	191837	191838	Poor devil	4048	" she asked , with playful curiosity — "
191852	191853	191837	191838	Poor devil	4048	" "
191881	191882	191871	191871	He	846	" "
191937	191938	191929	191929	you	4052	" "
191958	191981	191982	191982	I	0	" said Lydgate , letting his hands fall on to his wife 's shoulders , and looking at her with affectionate gravity . "
192068	192069	192056	192057	A man	846	" "
192130	192131	192121	192121	You	4052	" "
192144	192145	192138	192138	I	0	" "
192157	192158	192149	192150	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" "
192194	192284	192184	192184	she	276	" When Dorothea , walking round the laurel - planted plots of the New Hospital with Lydgate , had learned from him that there were no signs of change in Mr. Casaubon 's bodily condition beyond the mental sign of anxiety to know the truth about his illness , she was silent for a few moments , wondering whether she had said or done anything to rouse this new anxiety . Lydgate , not willing to let slip an opportunity of furthering a favourite purpose , ventured to say — "
192398	192399	192375	192375	you	4069	" "
192404	192410	192375	192375	you	4069	" said Dorothea , brightening . "
192452	192462	192449	192449	I	0	" she said , after a moment 's hesitation , "
192508	192509	192449	192449	I	0	" "
192517	192525	192449	192449	I	0	" said Lydgate , with abrupt energy . "
192604	192605	192609	192609	their	4080	" "
192612	192620	192609	192609	their	4080	" said Dorothea , with naive surprise . "
192787	192788	192789	192789	I	0	" "
192795	192811	192789	192789	I	0	" said Dorothea , at once fascinated by the situation sketched in Lydgate 's words . "
192830	192831	192823	192824	my uncle	6940	" "
192840	192848	192832	192832	People	6815	" said Lydgate , breaking off there . "
192861	192879	192832	192832	People	6815	" said Dorothea , looking at the affairs of Middlemarch by the light of the great persecutions . "
193044	193045	193017	193017	themselves	4095	" "
193050	193056	193017	193017	themselves	4095	" exclaimed Dorothea , indignantly . "
193216	193217	193218	193218	I	0	" "
193230	193236	193221	193221	you	4104	" said Dorothea , cordially . "
193334	193359	193555	193555	She	4108	" There was a melancholy cadence in Dorothea 's voice as she spoke these last words . But she presently added , more cheerfully , "
193386	193554	193555	193555	She	4108	" She did mention it that evening , and said that she should like to subscribe two hundred a - year — she had seven hundred a - year as the equivalent of her own fortune , settled on her at her marriage . Mr. Casaubon made no objection beyond a passing remark that the sum might be disproportionate in relation to other good objects , but when Dorothea in her ignorance resisted that suggestion , he acquiesced . He did not care himself about spending money , and was not reluctant to give it . If he ever felt keenly any question of money it was through the medium of another passion than the love of material property . Dorothea told him that she had seen Lydgate , and recited the gist of her conversation with him about the Hospital . Mr. Casaubon did not question her further , but he felt sure that she had wished to know what had passed between Lydgate and himself . "
193561	193861	193555	193555	She	4108	" said the ever - restless voice within ; but that increase of tacit knowledge only thrust further off any confidence between them . He distrusted her affection ; and what loneliness is more lonely than distrust ? That opposition to the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to Dorothea was , like other oppositions , to be viewed in many different lights . He regarded it as a mixture of jealousy and dunderheaded prejudice . Mr. Bulstrode saw in it not only medical jealousy but a determination to thwart himself , prompted mainly by a hatred of that vital religion of which he had striven to be an effectual lay representative — a hatred which certainly found pretexts apart from religion such as were only too easy to find in the entanglements of human action . These might be called the ministerial views . But oppositions have the illimitable range of objections at command , which need never stop short at the boundary of knowledge , but can draw forever on the vasts of ignorance . What the opposition in Middlemarch said about the New Hospital and its administration had certainly a great deal of echo in it , for heaven has taken care that everybody shall not be an originator ; but there were differences which represented every social shade between the polished moderation of Dr. Minchin and the trenchant assertion of Mrs. Dollop , the landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane . Mrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by her own asseveration , that Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the Hospital , if not to poison them , for the sake of cutting them up without saying by your leave or with your leave ; for it was a known "
193863	194073	194074	194075	Doctor Gambit	612	" that he had wanted to cut up Mrs. Goby , as respectable a woman as any in Parley Street , who had money in trust before her marriage — a poor tale for a doctor , who if he was good for anything should know what was the matter with you before you died , and not want to pry into your inside after you were gone . If that was not reason , Mrs. Dollop wished to know what was ; but there was a prevalent feeling in her audience that her opinion was a bulwark , and that if it were overthrown there would be no limits to the cutting - up of bodies , as had been well seen in Burke and Hare with their pitch - plaisters — such a hanging business as that was not wanted in Middlemarch ! And let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in Slaughter Lane was unimportant to the medical profession : that old authentic public - house — the original Tankard , known by the name of Dollop's — was the resort of a great Benefit Club , which had some months before put to the vote whether its long - standing medical man , "
194077	194085	194074	194075	Doctor Gambit	612	" should not be cashiered in favour of "
194090	194350	194086	194088	this Doctor Lydgate	613	" who was capable of performing the most astonishing cures , and rescuing people altogether given up by other practitioners . But the balance had been turned against Lydgate by two members , who for some private reasons held that this power of resuscitating persons as good as dead was an equivocal recommendation , and might interfere with providential favours . In the course of the year , however , there had been a change in the public sentiment , of which the unanimity at Dollop 's was an index . A good deal more than a year ago , before anything was known of Lydgate 's skill , the judgments on it had naturally been divided , depending on a sense of likelihood , situated perhaps in the pit of the stomach or in the pineal gland , and differing in its verdicts , but not the less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence . Patients who had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn threadbare , like old Featherstone 's , had been at once inclined to try him ; also , many who did not like paying their doctor 's bills , thought agreeably of opening an account with a new doctor and sending for him without stint if the children 's temper wanted a dose , occasions when the old practitioners were often crusty ; and all persons thus inclined to employ Lydgate held it likely that he was clever . Some considered that he might do more than others "
194354	194367	193555	193555	She	4108	liver;"—at least there would be no harm in getting a few bottles of "
194369	194454	194074	194075	Doctor Gambit	612	" from him , since if these proved useless it would still be possible to return to the Purifying Pills , which kept you alive if they did not remove the yellowness . But these were people of minor importance . Good Middlemarch families were of course not going to change their doctor without reason shown ; and everybody who had employed Mr. Peacock did not feel obliged to accept a new man merely in the character of his successor , objecting that he was "
194463	194557	194461	194461	Peacock	289	" But Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were particulars enough reported of him to breed much more specific expectations and to intensify differences into partisanship ; some of the particulars being of that impressive order of which the significance is entirely hidden , like a statistical amount without a standard of comparison , but with a note of exclamation at the end . The cubic feet of oxygen yearly swallowed by a full - grown man — what a shudder they might have created in some Middlemarch circles ! "
194590	194789	194582	194588	people who say quarantine is no good	4110	" One of the facts quickly rumored was that Lydgate did not dispense drugs . This was offensive both to the physicians whose exclusive distinction seemed infringed on , and to the surgeon - apothecaries with whom he ranged himself ; and only a little while before , they might have counted on having the law on their side against a man who without calling himself a London - made M.D. dared to ask for pay except as a charge on drugs . But Lydgate had not been experienced enough to foresee that his new course would be even more offensive to the laity ; and to Mr. Mawmsey , an important grocer in the Top Market , who , though not one of his patients , questioned him in an affable manner on the subject , he was injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation of his reasons , pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the character of practitioners , and be a constant injury to the public , if their only mode of getting paid for their work was by their making out long bills for draughts , boluses , and mixtures . "
194811	194818	194796	194800	hard - working medical men	4111	" said Lydgate , rather thoughtlessly . "
194852	195047	194841	194842	Mr. Mawmsey	615	" Mr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer ( it was about a question of outdoor pay that he was having an interview with Lydgate ) , he was also asthmatic and had an increasing family : thus , from a medical point of view , as well as from his own , he was an important man ; indeed , an exceptional grocer , whose hair was arranged in a flame - like pyramid , and whose retail deference was of the cordial , encouraging kind — jocosely complimentary , and with a certain considerate abstinence from letting out the full force of his mind . It was Mr. Mawmsey 's friendly jocoseness in questioning him which had set the tone of Lydgate 's reply . But let the wise be warned against too great readiness at explanation : it multiplies the sources of mistake , lengthening the sum for reckoners sure to go wrong . Lydgate smiled as he ended his speech , putting his foot into the stirrup , and Mr. Mawmsey laughed more than he would have done if he had known who the king 's lieges were , giving his "
195059	195154	195057	195057	sir	6934	" with the air of one who saw everything clearly enough . But in truth his views were perturbed . For years he had been paying bills with strictly made items , so that for every half - crown and eighteen - pence he was certain something measurable had been delivered . He had done this with satisfaction , including it among his responsibilities as a husband and father , and regarding a longer bill than usual as a dignity worth mentioning . Moreover , in addition to the massive benefit of the drugs to "
195159	195311	195157	195157	family	4116	" he had enjoyed the pleasure of forming an acute judgment as to their immediate effects , so as to give an intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit — a practitioner just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller , and especially esteemed as an accoucheur , of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had the poorest opinion on all other points , but in doctoring , he was wo nt to say in an undertone , he placed Gambit above any of them . Here were deeper reasons than the superficial talk of a new man , which appeared still flimsier in the drawing - room over the shop , when they were recited to Mrs. Mawmsey , a woman accustomed to be made much of as a fertile mother,—generally under attendance more or less frequent from Mr. Gambit , and occasionally having attacks which required Dr. Minchin . "
195327	195339	195343	195343	him	278	" said Mrs. Mawmsey , who was slightly given to drawling . "
195380	195391	195343	195343	him	278	dear!"—here Mrs. Mawmsey turned to an intimate female friend who sat by—"a
195463	195464	195455	195455	I	0	" "
195471	195476	195455	195455	I	0	" said Mr. Mawmsey ; "
195575	195594	195565	195565	I	0	" The next day Mr. Gambit was told that Lydgate went about saying physic was of no use . "
195597	195625	195565	195565	I	0	" said he , lifting his eyebrows with cautious surprise . ( He was a stout husky man with a large ring on his fourth finger . ) "
195635	195636	195628	195628	he	278	" "
195643	195660	195640	195640	I	0	" returned Mrs. Mawmsey , who habitually gave weight to her speech by loading her pronouns . "
195681	195741	195662	195662	he	278	" Mrs. Mawmsey had had a great deal of sitting from Mr. Gambit , including very full accounts of his own habits of body and other affairs ; but of course he knew there was no innuendo in her remark , since his spare time and personal narrative had never been charged for . So he replied , humorously — "
195756	195757	195746	195751	a good - looking young fellow	4125	" "
195765	195770	195746	195751	a good - looking young fellow	4125	" said Mrs. Mawmsey . "
195778	195917	195771	195771	Others	1056	" Hence Mr. Gambit could go away from the chief grocer 's without fear of rivalry , but not without a sense that Lydgate was one of those hypocrites who try to discredit others by advertising their own honesty , and that it might be worth some people 's while to show him up . Mr. Gambit , however , had a satisfactory practice , much pervaded by the smells of retail trading which suggested the reduction of cash payments to a balance . And he did not think it worth his while to show Lydgate up until he knew how . He had not indeed great resources of education , and had had to work his own way against a good deal of professional contempt ; but he made none the worse accoucheur for calling the breathing apparatus "
195920	196164	195771	195771	Others	1056	" Other medical men felt themselves more capable . Mr. Toller shared the highest practice in the town and belonged to an old Middlemarch family : there were Tollers in the law and everything else above the line of retail trade . Unlike our irascible friend Wrench , he had the easiest way in the world of taking things which might be supposed to annoy him , being a well - bred , quietly facetious man , who kept a good house , was very fond of a little sporting when he could get it , very friendly with Mr. Hawley , and hostile to Mr. Bulstrode . It may seem odd that with such pleasant habits he should have been given to the heroic treatment , bleeding and blistering and starving his patients , with a dispassionate disregard to his personal example ; but the incongruity favoured the opinion of his ability among his patients , who commonly observed that Mr. Toller had lazy manners , but his treatment was as active as you could desire : no man , said they , carried more seriousness into his profession : he was a little slow in coming , but when he came , he did something . He was a great favourite in his own circle , and whatever he implied to any one 's disadvantage told doubly from his careless ironical tone . He naturally got tired of smiling and saying , "
196167	196206	195771	195771	Others	1056	" when he was told that Mr. Peacock 's successor did not mean to dispense medicines ; and Mr. Hackbutt one day mentioning it over the wine at a dinner - party , Mr. Toller said , laughingly , "
196232	196233	196225	196225	I'm	0	" "
196241	196246	196236	196236	your	0	" said Mr. Hackbutt , "
196316	196317	196320	196320	Hackbutt	404	" "
196322	196329	196320	196320	Hackbutt	404	" said Mr. Toller , ironically . "
196395	196396	196452	196452	Hawley	405	" "
196413	196447	196452	196452	Hawley	405	" said Mr. Hawley , passing the decanter to Mr. Wrench . Mr. Wrench , generally abstemious , often drank wine rather freely at a party , getting the more irritable in consequence . "
196454	196458	196452	196452	Hawley	405	" he said , "
196568	196578	196579	196579	I	0	" Mr. Wrench 's voice had become exceedingly sharp . "
196588	196602	196586	196586	Wrench	293	" said Mr. Hawley , thrusting his hands into his trouser - pockets . "
196607	196622	196586	196586	Wrench	293	" said Mr. Toller , striking in pacifically , and looking at Mr. Wrench , "
196649	196650	196647	196647	Sprague	355	" "
196660	196674	196647	196647	Sprague	355	" said Mr. Hackbutt , with a disinterested desire to offer his lights . "
196685	196686	196683	196683	Hawley	405	" "
196693	196698	196699	196699	I	0	" said Mr. Hawley . "
196719	196720	196706	196706	You	4141	" "
196728	196733	196706	196706	You	4141	" said Mr. Toller . "
196768	196820	196825	196825	he	4141	" Mr. Toller 's prediction was partly verified . If Mr. and Mrs. Mawmsey , who had no idea of employing Lydgate , were made uneasy by his supposed declaration against drugs , it was inevitable that those who called him in should watch a little anxiously to see whether he did "
196828	196947	196825	196825	he	4141	" in the case . Even good Mr. Powderell , who in his constant charity of interpretation was inclined to esteem Lydgate the more for what seemed a conscientious pursuit of a better plan , had his mind disturbed with doubts during his wife 's attack of erysipelas , and could not abstain from mentioning to Lydgate that Mr. Peacock on a similar occasion had administered a series of boluses which were not otherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing Mrs. Powderell round before Michaelmas from an illness which had begun in a remarkably hot August . At last , indeed , in the conflict between his desire not to hurt Lydgate and his anxiety that no "
196949	197212	196825	196825	he	4141	" should be lacking , he induced his wife privately to take Widgeon 's Purifying Pills , an esteemed Middlemarch medicine , which arrested every disease at the fountain by setting to work at once upon the blood . This co - operative measure was not to be mentioned to Lydgate , and Mr. Powderell himself had no certain reliance on it , only hoping that it might be attended with a blessing . But in this doubtful stage of Lydgate 's introduction he was helped by what we mortals rashly call good fortune . I suppose no doctor ever came newly to a place without making cures that surprised somebody — cures which may be called fortune 's testimonials , and deserve as much credit as the written or printed kind . Various patients got well while Lydgate was attending them , some even of dangerous illnesses ; and it was remarked that the new doctor with his new ways had at least the merit of bringing people back from the brink of death . The trash talked on such occasions was the more vexatious to Lydgate , because it gave precisely the sort of prestige which an incompetent and unscrupulous man would desire , and was sure to be imputed to him by the simmering dislike of the other medical men as an encouragement on his own part of ignorant puffing . But even his proud outspokenness was checked by the discernment that it was as useless to fight against the interpretations of ignorance as to whip the fog ; and "
197215	197369	196825	196825	he	4141	" insisted on using those interpretations . Mrs. Larcher having just become charitably concerned about alarming symptoms in her charwoman , when Dr. Minchin called , asked him to see her then and there , and to give her a certificate for the Infirmary ; whereupon after examination he wrote a statement of the case as one of tumor , and recommended the bearer Nancy Nash as an out - patient . Nancy , calling at home on her way to the Infirmary , allowed the stay maker and his wife , in whose attic she lodged , to read Dr. Minchin 's paper , and by this means became a subject of compassionate conversation in the neighboring shops of Churchyard Lane as being afflicted with a tumor at first declared to be as large and hard as a duck 's egg , but later in the day to be about the size of "
197373	197395	196825	196825	he	4141	" Most hearers agreed that it would have to be cut out , but one had known of oil and another of "
197397	197421	196825	196825	he	4141	" as adequate to soften and reduce any lump in the body when taken enough of into the inside — the oil by gradually "
197424	197468	196825	196825	he	4141	" the squitchineal by eating away . Meanwhile when Nancy presented herself at the Infirmary , it happened to be one of Lydgate 's days there . After questioning and examining her , Lydgate said to the house - surgeon in an undertone , "
197478	197650	196825	196825	he	4141	" He ordered her a blister and some steel mixture , and told her to go home and rest , giving her at the same time a note to Mrs. Larcher , who , she said , was her best employer , to testify that she was in need of good food . But by - and - by Nancy , in her attic , became portentously worse , the supposed tumor having indeed given way to the blister , but only wandered to another region with angrier pain . The staymaker 's wife went to fetch Lydgate , and he continued for a fortnight to attend Nancy in her own home , until under his treatment she got quite well and went to work again . But the case continued to be described as one of tumor in Churchyard Lane and other streets — nay , by Mrs. Larcher also ; for when Lydgate 's remarkable cure was mentioned to Dr. Minchin , he naturally did not like to say , "
197669	197673	197660	197660	I	0	" but answered , "
197692	198223	197678	197678	I	0	" He had been inwardly annoyed , however , when he had asked at the Infirmary about the woman he had recommended two days before , to hear from the house - surgeon , a youngster who was not sorry to vex Minchin with impunity , exactly what had occurred : he privately pronounced that it was indecent in a general practitioner to contradict a physician 's diagnosis in that open manner , and afterwards agreed with Wrench that Lydgate was disagreeably inattentive to etiquette . Lydgate did not make the affair a ground for valuing himself or ( very particularly ) despising Minchin , such rectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal qualifications . But report took up this amazing case of tumor , not clearly distinguished from cancer , and considered the more awful for being of the wandering sort ; till much prejudice against Lydgate 's method as to drugs was overcome by the proof of his marvellous skill in the speedy restoration of Nancy Nash after she had been rolling and rolling in agonies from the presence of a tumor both hard and obstinate , but nevertheless compelled to yield . How could Lydgate help himself ? It is offensive to tell a lady when she is expressing her amazement at your skill , that she is altogether mistaken and rather foolish in her amazement . And to have entered into the nature of diseases would only have added to his breaches of medical propriety . Thus he had to wince under a promise of success given by that ignorant praise which misses every valid quality . In the case of a more conspicuous patient , Mr. Borthrop Trumbull , Lydgate was conscious of having shown himself something better than an every - day doctor , though here too it was an equivocal advantage that he won . The eloquent auctioneer was seized with pneumonia , and having been a patient of Mr. Peacock 's , sent for Lydgate , whom he had expressed his intention to patronize . Mr Trumbull was a robust man , a good subject for trying the expectant theory upon — watching the course of an interesting disease when left as much as possible to itself , so that the stages might be noted for future guidance ; and from the air with which he described his sensations Lydgate surmised that he would like to be taken into his medical man 's confidence , and be represented as a partner in his own cure . The auctioneer heard , without much surprise , that his was a constitution which ( always with due watching ) might be left to itself , so as to offer a beautiful example of a disease with all its phases seen in clear delineation , and that he probably had the rare strength of mind voluntarily to become the test of a rational procedure , and thus make the disorder of his pulmonary functions a general benefit to society . Mr. Trumbull acquiesced at once , and entered strongly into the view that an illness of his was no ordinary occasion for medical science . "
198244	198417	198234	198242	one who is altogether ignorant of the vis medicatrix	4149	" said he , with his usual superiority of expression , made rather pathetic by difficulty of breathing . And he went without shrinking through his abstinence from drugs , much sustained by application of the thermometer which implied the importance of his temperature , by the sense that he furnished objects for the microscope , and by learning many new words which seemed suited to the dignity of his secretions . For Lydgate was acute enough to indulge him with a little technical talk . It may be imagined that Mr. Trumbull rose from his couch with a disposition to speak of an illness in which he had manifested the strength of his mind as well as constitution ; and he was not backward in awarding credit to the medical man who had discerned the quality of patient he had to deal with . The auctioneer was not an ungenerous man , and liked to give others their due , feeling that he could afford it . He had caught the words "
198421	198437	198459	198459	his	4152	" and rang chimes on this and other learned phrases to accompany the assurance that Lydgate "
198468	199104	199124	199124	dispenser	4156	" This had happened before the affair of Fred Vincy 's illness had given to Mr. Wrench 's enmity towards Lydgate more definite personal ground . The new - comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of rivalry , and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical criticism or reflections on his hard - driven elders , who had had something else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions . His practice had spread in one or two quarters , and from the first the report of his high family had led to his being pretty generally invited , so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the best houses ; and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed always to end in a mutual attachment . There was hardly ever so much unanimity among them as in the opinion that Lydgate was an arrogant young fellow , and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to show a crawling subservience to Bulstrode . That Mr. Farebrother , whose name was a chief flag of the anti - Bulstrode party , always defended Lydgate and made a friend of him , was referred to Farebrother 's unaccountable way of fighting on both sides . Here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust at the announcement of the laws Mr. Bulstrode was laying down for the direction of the New Hospital , which were the more exasperating because there was no present possibility of interfering with his will and pleasure , everybody except Lord Medlicote having refused help towards the building , on the ground that they preferred giving to the Old Infirmary . Mr. Bulstrode met all the expenses , and had ceased to be sorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors ; but he had had to spend large sums , and the building had lingered . Caleb Garth had undertaken it , had failed during its progress , and before the interior fittings were begun had retired from the management of the business ; and when referring to the Hospital he often said that however Bulstrode might ring if you tried him , he liked good solid carpentry and masonry , and had a notion both of drains and chimneys . In fact , the Hospital had become an object of intense interest to Bulstrode , and he would willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he might rule it dictatorially without any Board ; but he had another favourite object which also required money for its accomplishment : he wished to buy some land in the neighborhood of Middlemarch , and therefore he wished to get considerable contributions towards maintaining the Hospital . Meanwhile he framed his plan of management . The Hospital was to be reserved for fever in all its forms ; Lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent , that he might have free authority to pursue all comparative investigations which his studies , particularly in Paris , had shown him the importance of , the other medical visitors having a consultative influence , but no power to contravene Lydgate 's ultimate decisions ; and the general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of five directors associated with Mr. Bulstrode , who were to have votes in the ratio of their contributions , the Board itself filling up any vacancy in its numbers , and no mob of small contributors being admitted to a share of government . There was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the town to become a visitor at the Fever Hospital . "
199108	199115	199124	199124	dispenser	4156	" said Lydgate to Mr. Bulstrode , "
199245	199252	199253	199253	I	0	" Lydgate was in high spirits . "
199267	199272	199264	199265	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Mr. Bulstrode . "
199372	199502	199505	199505	gentlemen	1716	" A useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate nothing , and always vote with Mr. Bulstrode . The medical aversion to Lydgate was hardly disguised now . Neither Dr. Sprague nor Dr. Minchin said that he disliked Lydgate 's knowledge , or his disposition to improve treatment : what they disliked was his arrogance , which nobody felt to be altogether deniable . They implied that he was insolent , pretentious , and given to that reckless innovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the charlatan . The word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop . In those days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of Mr. St. John Long , "
199506	199535	199536	199536	Bulstrode	274	" attesting his extraction of a fluid like mercury from the temples of a patient . Mr. Toller remarked one day , smilingly , to Mrs. Taft , that "
199560	199561	199547	199550	a charlatan in religion	4170	" "
199570	199589	199547	199550	a charlatan in religion	4170	" said Mrs. Taft , keeping the number of thirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while ; "
199620	199621	199613	199614	the Almighty	7431	" "
199626	199631	199632	199632	Cheshire	626	" said Mr. Toller , "
199706	199707	199690	199690	he	185	" "
199719	199913	199914	199914	They	4180	" said Mrs. Taft . After this , it came to be held in various quarters that Lydgate played even with respectable constitutions for his own purposes , and how much more likely that in his flighty experimenting he should make sixes and sevens of hospital patients . Especially it was to be expected , as the landlady of the Tankard had said , that he would recklessly cut up their dead bodies . For Lydgate having attended Mrs. Goby , who died apparently of a heart - disease not very clearly expressed in the symptoms , too daringly asked leave of her relatives to open the body , and thus gave an offence quickly spreading beyond Parley Street , where that lady had long resided on an income such as made this association of her body with the victims of Burke and Hare a flagrant insult to her memory . Affairs were in this stage when Lydgate opened the subject of the Hospital to Dorothea . We see that he was bearing enmity and silly misconception with much spirit , aware that they were partly created by his good share of success . "
199921	199933	199914	199914	They	4180	" he said , talking confidentially in Mr. Farebrother 's study . "
200026	200027	200028	200028	I	0	" "
200036	200053	200028	200028	I	0	" said Mr. Farebrother , who had been puffing at his pipe thoughtfully while Lydgate talked ; "
200072	200073	200068	200068	you	0	" "
200081	200085	200086	200086	I	0	" said Lydgate , "
200129	200130	200140	200140	I	0	" "
200230	200231	200275	200275	you	0	" "
200238	200244	200275	200275	you	0	" said Lydgate , carelessly , "
200278	200301	200275	200275	you	0	" said Lydgate , who was nursing his leg as comfortably as possible , and feeling in no great need of advice . "
200397	200709	200717	200717	my	0	" Lydgate took Mr. Farebrother 's hints very cordially , though he would hardly have borne them from another man . He could not help remembering that he had lately made some debts , but these had seemed inevitable , and he had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way . The furniture for which he owed would not want renewing ; nor even the stock of wine for a long while . Many thoughts cheered him at that time — and justly . A man conscious of enthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the memory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds , and who hover in his mind as patron saints , invisibly helping . At home , that same evening when he had been chatting with Mr. Farebrother , he had his long legs stretched on the sofa , his head thrown back , and his hands clasped behind it according to his favourite ruminating attitude , while Rosamond sat at the piano , and played one tune after another , of which her husband only knew ( like the emotional elephant he was ! ) that they fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious sea - breezes . There was something very fine in Lydgate 's look just then , and any one might have been encouraged to bet on his achievement . In his dark eyes and on his mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the fulness of contemplative thought — the mind not searching , but beholding , and the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind it . Presently Rosamond left the piano and seated herself on a chair close to the sofa and opposite her husband 's face . "
200720	200738	200717	200717	my	0	" she said , folding her hands before her and putting on a little air of meekness . "
200748	200798	200741	200741	dear	6723	" said Lydgate , gently , turning his eyes and resting them on her , but not otherwise moving . Rosamond 's presence at that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake , and her woman 's instinct in this matter was not dull . "
200804	200830	200831	200831	I	0	" she said , leaning forward and bringing her face nearer to his . He moved his hands and placed them gently behind her shoulders . "

200869	200877	200864	200864	I	0	" said Rosamond , shaking her head . "

200941	200955	200911	200911	he	4192	" said Rosamond , with a look of disgust on her pretty face , "
200979	200980	200983	200983	he	631	" "
200987	201003	201004	201004	He	631	" said Lydgate , going on too earnestly to take much notice of her answer . "
201041	201042	201043	201043	I	0	" "
201054	201064	201043	201043	I	0	" said Rosamond , half playfully , half anxiously , "
201103	201104	201097	201097	You	4189	" "
201178	201179	201171	201171	he	631	" "
201187	201195	201171	201171	he	631	" said Rosamond , with some interest . "
201253	201264	201248	201248	He	631	" There was a moment 's pause before Rosamond said , "
201282	201283	201286	201286	Rosy	298	" "
201293	201303	201286	201286	Rosy	298	" said Lydgate , drawing her closer to him . "
201316	201317	201286	201286	Rosy	298	" "
201357	201358	201359	201360	The cousins	4210	" "
201369	201376	201380	201380	their	4210	" said Lydgate , with scorn . "
201392	201393	201383	201383	they	4210	" "
201396	201400	201383	201383	they	4210	" said Rosamond , "
201413	201426	201401	201401	I	0	" We know that she had much quiet perseverance in her opinion . "
201438	201444	201436	201436	Rosamond	283	" said Lydgate , gravely . "
201494	201495	201488	201488	dear	6723	" "
201504	201510	201511	201511	I	0	" said Rosy , dimpling , "
201546	201547	201511	201511	I	0	" "
201558	201707	201511	201511	I	0	" said Lydgate , giving up remonstrance and petting her resignedly . While Lydgate , safely married and with the Hospital under his command , felt himself struggling for Medical Reform against Middlemarch , Middlemarch was becoming more and more conscious of the national struggle for another kind of Reform . By the time that Lord John Russell 's measure was being debated in the House of Commons , there was a new political animation in Middlemarch , and a new definition of parties which might show a decided change of balance if a new election came . And there were some who already predicted this event , declaring that a Reform Bill would never be carried by the actual Parliament . This was what Will Ladislaw dwelt on to Mr. Brooke as a reason for congratulation that he had not yet tried his strength at the hustings . "
201721	201725	201511	201511	I	0	" said Will . "
201786	201787	201791	201791	Ladislaw	261	" "
201803	201808	201793	201793	we	4218	" said Mr. Brooke . "
201868	201869	201866	201866	Grey	530	" "
201891	201895	201880	201880	you	261	" said Will . "

201971	201972	201964	201964	I	0	" "
201981	201985	202006	202006	It	4223	" said Will . "
202061	202062	202067	202067	Ladislaw	261	" "
202107	202108	202067	202067	Ladislaw	261	" "
202113	202117	202067	202067	Ladislaw	261	" said Will , "
202158	202159	202171	202171	Ladislaw	261	" "
202310	202311	202290	202290	I	0	" "
202321	202325	202290	202290	I	0	" said Ladislaw , "
202344	202451	202340	202340	Burke	628	" Will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison , even from Mr. Brooke ; for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be conscious of expressing one 's self better than others and never to have it noticed , and in the general dearth of admiration for the right thing , even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather fortifying . Will felt that his literary refinements were usually beyond the limits of Middlemarch perception ; nevertheless , he was beginning thoroughly to like the work of which when he began he had said to himself rather languidly , "
202453	202554	202340	202340	Burke	628	not?"—and he studied the political situation with as ardent an interest as he had ever given to poetic metres or mediaevalism . It is undeniable that but for the desire to be where Dorothea was , and perhaps the want of knowing what else to do , Will would not at this time have been meditating on the needs of the English people or criticising English statesmanship : he would probably have been rambling in Italy sketching plans for several dramas , trying prose and finding it too jejune , trying verse and finding it too artificial , beginning to copy "
202556	202566	202340	202340	Burke	628	" from old pictures , leaving off because they were "
202570	202733	202340	202340	Burke	628	" and observing that , after all , self - culture was the principal point ; while in politics he would have been sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general . Our sense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place of dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not a matter of indifference . Ladislaw had now accepted his bit of work , though it was not that indeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as alone worthy of continuous effort . His nature warmed easily in the presence of subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action , and the easily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public spirit . In spite of Mr. Casaubon and the banishment from Lowick , he was rather happy ; getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for practical purposes , and making the "
202735	202804	202340	202340	Burke	628	" celebrated as far as Brassing ( never mind the smallness of the area ; the writing was not worse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth ) . Mr. Brooke was occasionally irritating ; but Will 's impatience was relieved by the division of his time between visits to the Grange and retreats to his Middlemarch lodgings , which gave variety to his life . "
202811	202817	202340	202340	Burke	628	" he said to himself , "
202903	202997	202893	202893	I	0	" As Lydgate had said of him , he was a sort of gypsy , rather enjoying the sense of belonging to no class ; he had a feeling of romance in his position , and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise wherever he went . That sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he had felt some new distance between himself and Dorothea in their accidental meeting at Lydgate 's , and his irritation had gone out towards Mr. Casaubon , who had declared beforehand that Will would lose caste . "
203004	203063	202893	202893	I	0	" he would have said , if that prophecy had been uttered to him , and the quick blood would have come and gone like breath in his transparent skin . But it is one thing to like defiance , and another thing to like its consequences . Meanwhile , the town opinion about the new editor of the "
203065	203117	203118	203119	Mr. Casaubon	189	" was tending to confirm Mr. Casaubon 's view . Will 's relationship in that distinguished quarter did not , like Lydgate 's high connections , serve as an advantageous introduction : if it was rumored that young Ladislaw was Mr. Casaubon 's nephew or cousin , it was also rumored that "
203128	203129	203130	203130	Brooke	175	" "
203136	203141	203130	203130	Brooke	175	" said Mr. Hawley , "
203201	203224	203185	203185	Brooke	175	" And some oddities of Will 's , more or less poetical , appeared to support Mr. Keck , the editor of the "
203227	203319	203185	203185	Brooke	175	" in asserting that Ladislaw , if the truth were known , was not only a Polish emissary but crack - brained , which accounted for the preternatural quickness and glibness of his speech when he got on to a platform — as he did whenever he had an opportunity , speaking with a facility which cast reflections on solid Englishmen generally . It was disgusting to Keck to see a strip of a fellow , with light curls round his head , get up and speechify by the hour against institutions "
203330	203338	203185	203185	Brooke	175	" And in a leading article of the "
203341	203352	203185	203185	Brooke	175	" Keck characterized Ladislaw 's speech at a Reform meeting as "
203390	203391	203185	203185	Brooke	175	" "
203401	203410	203399	203399	Keck	567	" said Dr. Sprague , with sarcastic intentions . "
203417	203418	203399	203399	Keck	567	" "
203431	204045	203399	203399	Keck	567	" said Keck . This dangerous aspect of Ladislaw was strangely contrasted with other habits which became matter of remark . He had a fondness , half artistic , half affectionate , for little children — the smaller they were on tolerably active legs , and the funnier their clothing , the better Will liked to surprise and please them . We know that in Rome he was given to ramble about among the poor people , and the taste did not quit him in Middlemarch . He had somehow picked up a troop of droll children , little hatless boys with their galligaskins much worn and scant shirting to hang out , little girls who tossed their hair out of their eyes to look at him , and guardian brothers at the mature age of seven . This troop he had led out on gypsy excursions to Halsell Wood at nutting - time , and since the cold weather had set in he had taken them on a clear day to gather sticks for a bonfire in the hollow of a hillside , where he drew out a small feast of gingerbread for them , and improvised a Punch - and - Judy drama with some private home - made puppets . Here was one oddity . Another was , that in houses where he got friendly , he was given to stretch himself at full length on the rug while he talked , and was apt to be discovered in this attitude by occasional callers for whom such an irregularity was likely to confirm the notions of his dangerously mixed blood and general laxity . But Will 's articles and speeches naturally recommended him in families which the new strictness of party division had marked off on the side of Reform . He was invited to Mr. Bulstrode 's ; but here he could not lie down on the rug , and Mrs. Bulstrode felt that his mode of talking about Catholic countries , as if there were any truce with Antichrist , illustrated the usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men . At Mr. Farebrother 's , however , whom the irony of events had brought on the same side with Bulstrode in the national movement , Will became a favourite with the ladies ; especially with little Miss Noble , whom it was one of his oddities to escort when he met her in the street with her little basket , giving her his arm in the eyes of the town , and insisting on going with her to pay some call where she distributed her small filchings from her own share of sweet things . But the house where he visited oftenest and lay most on the rug was Lydgate 's . The two men were not at all alike , but they agreed none the worse . Lydgate was abrupt but not irritable , taking little notice of megrims in healthy people ; and Ladislaw did not usually throw away his susceptibilities on those who took no notice of them . With Rosamond , on the other hand , he pouted and was wayward — nay , often uncomplimentary , much to her inward surprise ; nevertheless he was gradually becoming necessary to her entertainment by his companionship in her music , his varied talk , and his freedom from the grave preoccupation which , with all her husband 's tenderness and indulgence , often made his manners unsatisfactory to her , and confirmed her dislike of the medical profession . Lydgate , inclined to be sarcastic on the superstitious faith of the people in the efficacy of "
204049	204136	203399	203399	Keck	567	" while nobody cared about the low state of pathology , sometimes assailed Will with troublesome questions . One evening in March , Rosamond in her cherry - coloured dress with swansdown trimming about the throat sat at the tea - table ; Lydgate , lately come in tired from his outdoor work , was seated sideways on an easy - chair by the fire with one leg over the elbow , his brow looking a little troubled as his eyes rambled over the columns of the "
204139	204189	203399	203399	Keck	567	" while Rosamond , having noticed that he was perturbed , avoided looking at him , and inwardly thanked heaven that she herself had not a moody disposition . Will Ladislaw was stretched on the rug contemplating the curtain - pole abstractedly , and humming very low the notes of "
204197	204258	204194	204194	thy	4240	" while the house spaniel , also stretched out with small choice of room , looked from between his paws at the usurper of the rug with silent but strong objection . Rosamond bringing Lydgate his cup of tea , he threw down the paper , and said to Will , who had started up and gone to the table — "
204288	204289	204273	204273	they	4244	" "
204308	204319	204293	204298	those who read the ' Pioneer	4245	" said Will , swallowing his tea and walking about . "
204367	204368	204372	204372	he	335	" "
204407	204408	204385	204393	the very men who profess to be for him	4251	" "

204428	204446	204421	204422	resident members	4253	" said Lydgate , who was much given to use that inconvenient word in a curt tone . "
204454	204465	204447	204447	They	4254	" said Will , laughing , and shaking his curls ; "
204507	204508	204509	204509	He	175	" "
204519	204527	204528	204528	He	175	" said Lydgate , with contemptuous decision . "
204556	204557	204548	204548	Bulstrode	312	" "
204570	204574	204575	204575	He	175	" said Will . "

204653	204654	204623	204623	Ladislaw	261	" "
204674	204694	204658	204658	Men	6762	" said Will , who could find reasons impromptu , when he had not thought of a question beforehand . "
204762	204763	204734	204734	You	4260	" "
204915	204916	204929	204929	Ladislaw	261	" "

205036	205053	205016	205016	you	261	" said Lydgate , seeing himself checkmated by a move which he had often used himself , "
205137	205151	205152	205152	He	274	" Lydgate added rather proudly , bearing in mind Mr. Farebrother 's remarks . "
205177	205178	205170	205170	I	0	" "
205192	205239	205180	205180	you	0	" said Will Ladislaw , nettled , and turning sharp round . For the first time he felt offended with Lydgate ; not the less so , perhaps , because he would have declined any close inquiry into the growth of his relation to Mr. Brooke . "
205244	205248	205249	205249	I	0	" said Lydgate , "
205304	205305	205311	205311	you	0	" "
205318	205325	205311	205311	you	0	" said Will , still nettled . "
205392	205401	205402	205402	I	0	" Will ended , tossing back his head , "
205419	205420	205421	205421	You	0	" "
205428	205457	205421	205421	You	0	" said Lydgate , surprised . He had been preoccupied with his own vindication , and had been blind to what Ladislaw might infer on his own account . "
205497	205498	205490	205490	I	0	" "
205508	205512	205513	205513	I	0	" said Rosamond . "
205556	205581	205539	205539	you	0	" Rosamond looked mildly neutral as she said this , rising to ring the bell , and then crossing to her work - table . "
205585	205601	205582	205583	Poor Rosy	637	" said Lydgate , putting out his hand to her as she was passing him . "
205620	205631	205614	205614	Ladislaw	261	" When Will was gone Rosamond said to her husband , "
205643	205644	205645	205645	Me	0	" "
205664	205665	205656	205656	He	261	" "
205709	205710	205697	205697	You	0	" "
205720	205728	205717	205718	a brute	4293	" said Lydgate , caressing her penitently . "
205733	205734	205731	205731	you	0	" "
205742	205997	205731	205731	you	0	" It was really a letter insisting on the payment of a bill for furniture . But Rosamond was expecting to have a baby , and Lydgate wished to save her from any perturbation . It happened to be on a Saturday evening that Will Ladislaw had that little discussion with Lydgate . Its effect when he went to his own rooms was to make him sit up half the night , thinking over again , under a new irritation , all that he had before thought of his having settled in Middlemarch and harnessed himself with Mr. Brooke . Hesitations before he had taken the step had since turned into susceptibility to every hint that he would have been wiser not to take it ; and hence came his heat towards Lydgate — a heat which still kept him restless . Was he not making a fool of himself?—and at a time when he was more than ever conscious of being something better than a fool ? And for what end ? Well , for no definite end . True , he had dreamy visions of possibilities : there is no human being who having both passions and thoughts does not think in consequence of his passions — does not find images rising in his mind which soothe the passion with hope or sting it with dread . But this , which happens to us all , happens to some with a wide difference ; and Will was not one of those whose wit "
206002	206139	205731	205731	you	0	" he had his bypaths where there were little joys of his own choosing , such as gentlemen cantering on the highroad might have thought rather idiotic . The way in which he made a sort of happiness for himself out of his feeling for Dorothea was an example of this . It may seem strange , but it is the fact , that the ordinary vulgar vision of which Mr. Casaubon suspected him — namely , that Dorothea might become a widow , and that the interest he had established in her mind might turn into acceptance of him as a husband — had no tempting , arresting power over him ; he did not live in the scenery of such an event , and follow it out , as we all do with that imagined "
206141	206519	206744	206745	a fool	2625	" which is our practical heaven . It was not only that he was unwilling to entertain thoughts which could be accused of baseness , and was already uneasy in the sense that he had to justify himself from the charge of ingratitude — the latent consciousness of many other barriers between himself and Dorothea besides the existence of her husband , had helped to turn away his imagination from speculating on what might befall Mr. Casaubon . And there were yet other reasons . Will , we know , could not bear the thought of any flaw appearing in his crystal : he was at once exasperated and delighted by the calm freedom with which Dorothea looked at him and spoke to him , and there was something so exquisite in thinking of her just as she was , that he could not long for a change which must somehow change her . Do we not shun the street version of a fine melody?—or shrink from the news that the rarity — some bit of chiselling or engraving perhaps — which we have dwelt on even with exultation in the trouble it has cost us to snatch glimpses of it , is really not an uncommon thing , and may be obtained as an every - day possession ? Our good depends on the quality and breadth of our emotion ; and to Will , a creature who cared little for what are called the solid things of life and greatly for its subtler influences , to have within him such a feeling as he had towards Dorothea , was like the inheritance of a fortune . What others might have called the futility of his passion , made an additional delight for his imagination : he was conscious of a generous movement , and of verifying in his own experience that higher love - poetry which had charmed his fancy . Dorothea , he said to himself , was forever enthroned in his soul : no other woman could sit higher than her footstool ; and if he could have written out in immortal syllables the effect she wrought within him , he might have boasted after the example of old Drayton , that , — "
206535	206741	206742	206742	I	0	" But this result was questionable . And what else could he do for Dorothea ? What was his devotion worth to her ? It was impossible to tell . He would not go out of her reach . He saw no creature among her friends to whom he could believe that she spoke with the same simple confidence as to him . She had once said that she would like him to stay ; and stay he would , whatever fire - breathing dragons might hiss around her . This had always been the conclusion of Will 's hesitations . But he was not without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards his own resolve . He had often got irritated , as he was on this particular night , by some outside demonstration that his public exertions with Mr. Brooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as he would like them to be , and this was always associated with the other ground of irritation — that notwithstanding his sacrifice of dignity for Dorothea 's sake , he could hardly ever see her . Whereupon , not being able to contradict these unpleasant facts , he contradicted his own strongest bias and said , "
206747	206824	206744	206745	a fool	2625	" Nevertheless , since the inward debate necessarily turned on Dorothea , he ended , as he had done before , only by getting a livelier sense of what her presence would be to him ; and suddenly reflecting that the morrow would be Sunday , he determined to go to Lowick Church and see her . He slept upon that idea , but when he was dressing in the rational morning light , Objection said — "
206846	206847	206841	206841	Dorothea	189	" "
206850	206854	206861	206861	him	189	" argued Inclination , "
206884	206885	206879	206879	Dorothea	189	" "
206906	206907	206891	206892	Mr. Casaubon	189	" "
206981	207234	206971	206972	the Tuckers	640	" Having silenced Objection by force of unreason , Will walked to Lowick as if he had been on the way to Paradise , crossing Halsell Common and skirting the wood , where the sunlight fell broadly under the budding boughs , bringing out the beauties of moss and lichen , and fresh green growths piercing the brown . Everything seemed to know that it was Sunday , and to approve of his going to Lowick Church . Will easily felt happy when nothing crossed his humor , and by this time the thought of vexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather amusing to him , making his face break into its merry smile , pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine on the water — though the occasion was not exemplary . But most of us are apt to settle within ourselves that the man who blocks our way is odious , and not to mind causing him a little of the disgust which his personality excites in ourselves . Will went along with a small book under his arm and a hand in each side - pocket , never reading , but chanting a little , as he made scenes of what would happen in church and coming out . He was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of his own , sometimes trying a ready - made melody , sometimes improvising . The words were not exactly a hymn , but they certainly fitted his Sunday experience : — "
207267	207299	207315	207315	me	0	" A dream of breath that might be near , An inly - echoed tone , The thought that one may think me dear , The place where one was known , "
207329	208066	207323	207323	My	0	" Sometimes , when he took off his hat , shaking his head backward , and showing his delicate throat as he sang , he looked like an incarnation of the spring whose spirit filled the air — a bright creature , abundant in uncertain promises . The bells were still ringing when he got to Lowick , and he went into the curate 's pew before any one else arrived there . But he was still left alone in it when the congregation had assembled . The curate 's pew was opposite the rector 's at the entrance of the small chancel , and Will had time to fear that Dorothea might not come while he looked round at the group of rural faces which made the congregation from year to year within the white - washed walls and dark old pews , hardly with more change than we see in the boughs of a tree which breaks here and there with age , but yet has young shoots . Mr. Rigg 's frog - face was something alien and unaccountable , but notwithstanding this shock to the order of things , there were still the Waules and the rural stock of the Powderells in their pews side by side ; brother Samuel 's cheek had the same purple round as ever , and the three generations of decent cottagers came as of old with a sense of duty to their betters generally — the smaller children regarding Mr. Casaubon , who wore the black gown and mounted to the highest box , as probably the chief of all betters , and the one most awful if offended . Even in 1831 Lowick was at peace , not more agitated by Reform than by the solemn tenor of the Sunday sermon . The congregation had been used to seeing Will at church in former days , and no one took much note of him except the choir , who expected him to make a figure in the singing . Dorothea did at last appear on this quaint background , walking up the short aisle in her white beaver bonnet and gray cloak — the same she had worn in the Vatican . Her face being , from her entrance , towards the chancel , even her shortsighted eyes soon discerned Will , but there was no outward show of her feeling except a slight paleness and a grave bow as she passed him . To his own surprise Will felt suddenly uncomfortable , and dared not look at her after they had bowed to each other . Two minutes later , when Mr. Casaubon came out of the vestry , and , entering the pew , seated himself in face of Dorothea , Will felt his paralysis more complete . He could look nowhere except at the choir in the little gallery over the vestry - door : Dorothea was perhaps pained , and he had made a wretched blunder . It was no longer amusing to vex Mr. Casaubon , who had the advantage probably of watching him and seeing that he dared not turn his head . Why had he not imagined this beforehand?—but he could not expect that he should sit in that square pew alone , unrelieved by any Tuckers , who had apparently departed from Lowick altogether , for a new clergyman was in the desk . Still he called himself stupid now for not foreseeing that it would be impossible for him to look towards Dorothea — nay , that she might feel his coming an impertinence . There was no delivering himself from his cage , however ; and Will found his places and looked at his book as if he had been a school - mistress , feeling that the morning service had never been so immeasurably long before , that he was utterly ridiculous , out of temper , and miserable . This was what a man got by worshipping the sight of a woman ! The clerk observed with surprise that Mr. Ladislaw did not join in the tune of Hanover , and reflected that he might have a cold . Mr. Casaubon did not preach that morning , and there was no change in Will 's situation until the blessing had been pronounced and every one rose . It was the fashion at Lowick for "
208069	208528	209077	209077	You	4301	" to go out first . With a sudden determination to break the spell that was upon him , Will looked straight at Mr. Casaubon . But that gentleman 's eyes were on the button of the pew - door , which he opened , allowing Dorothea to pass , and following her immediately without raising his eyelids . Will 's glance had caught Dorothea 's as she turned out of the pew , and again she bowed , but this time with a look of agitation , as if she were repressing tears . Will walked out after them , but they went on towards the little gate leading out of the churchyard into the shrubbery , never looking round . It was impossible for him to follow them , and he could only walk back sadly at mid - day along the same road which he had trodden hopefully in the morning . The lights were all changed for him both without and within . Dorothea 's distress when she was leaving the church came chiefly from the perception that Mr. Casaubon was determined not to speak to his cousin , and that Will 's presence at church had served to mark more strongly the alienation between them . Will 's coming seemed to her quite excusable , nay , she thought it an amiable movement in him towards a reconciliation which she herself had been constantly wishing for . He had probably imagined , as she had , that if Mr. Casaubon and he could meet easily , they would shake hands and friendly intercourse might return . But now Dorothea felt quite robbed of that hope . Will was banished further than ever , for Mr. Casaubon must have been newly embittered by this thrusting upon him of a presence which he refused to recognize . He had not been very well that morning , suffering from some difficulty in breathing , and had not preached in consequence ; she was not surprised , therefore , that he was nearly silent at luncheon , still less that he made no allusion to Will Ladislaw . For her own part she felt that she could never again introduce that subject . They usually spent apart the hours between luncheon and dinner on a Sunday ; Mr. Casaubon in the library dozing chiefly , and Dorothea in her boudoir , where she was wo nt to occupy herself with some of her favourite books . There was a little heap of them on the table in the bow - window — of various sorts , from Herodotus , which she was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon , to her old companion Pascal , and Keble 's "
208532	209076	209077	209077	You	4301	" But to - day she opened one after another , and could read none of them . Everything seemed dreary : the portents before the birth of Cyrus — Jewish antiquities — oh dear!—devout epigrams — the sacred chime of favourite hymns — all alike were as flat as tunes beaten on wood : even the spring flowers and the grass had a dull shiver in them under the afternoon clouds that hid the sun fitfully ; even the sustaining thoughts which had become habits seemed to have in them the weariness of long future days in which she would still live with them for her sole companions . It was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor Dorothea was hungering for , and the hunger had grown from the perpetual effort demanded by her married life . She was always trying to be what her husband wished , and never able to repose on his delight in what she was . The thing that she liked , that she spontaneously cared to have , seemed to be always excluded from her life ; for if it was only granted and not shared by her husband it might as well have been denied . About Will Ladislaw there had been a difference between them from the first , and it had ended , since Mr. Casaubon had so severely repulsed Dorothea 's strong feeling about his claims on the family property , by her being convinced that she was in the right and her husband in the wrong , but that she was helpless . This afternoon the helplessness was more wretchedly benumbing than ever : she longed for objects who could be dear to her , and to whom she could be dear . She longed for work which would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain , and now it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual tomb , where there was the apparatus of a ghastly labour producing what would never see the light . Today she had stood at the door of the tomb and seen Will Ladislaw receding into the distant world of warm activity and fellowship — turning his face towards her as he went . Books were of no use . Thinking was of no use . It was Sunday , and she could not have the carriage to go to Celia , who had lately had a baby . There was no refuge now from spiritual emptiness and discontent , and Dorothea had to bear her bad mood , as she would have borne a headache . After dinner , at the hour when she usually began to read aloud , Mr. Casaubon proposed that they should go into the library , where , he said , he had ordered a fire and lights . He seemed to have revived , and to be thinking intently . In the library Dorothea observed that he had newly arranged a row of his note - books on a table , and now he took up and put into her hand a well - known volume , which was a table of contents to all the others . "
209085	209092	209077	209077	You	4301	" he said , seating himself , "
209180	209242	209243	209243	We	4303	" This proposal was only one more sign added to many since his memorable interview with Lydgate , that Mr. Casaubon 's original reluctance to let Dorothea work with him had given place to the contrary disposition , namely , to demand much interest and labour from her . After she had read and marked for two hours , he said , "
209287	209288	209285	209285	Dorothea	189	" "
209300	209513	209294	209294	you	0	" said Dorothea , who told the simple truth ; for what she dreaded was to exert herself in reading or anything else which left him as joyless as ever . It was a proof of the force with which certain characteristics in Dorothea impressed those around her , that her husband , with all his jealousy and suspicion , had gathered implicit trust in the integrity of her promises , and her power of devoting herself to her idea of the right and best . Of late he had begun to feel that these qualities were a peculiar possession for himself , and he wanted to engross them . The reading in the night did come . Dorothea in her young weariness had slept soon and fast : she was awakened by a sense of light , which seemed to her at first like a sudden vision of sunset after she had climbed a steep hill : she opened her eyes and saw her husband wrapped in his warm gown seating himself in the arm - chair near the fire - place where the embers were still glowing . He had lit two candles , expecting that Dorothea would awake , but not liking to rouse her by more direct means . "
209520	209527	209528	209528	I	0	" she said , rising immediately . "
209545	209560	209537	209537	I	0	" She threw wood on the fire , wrapped herself up , and said , "
209570	209571	209561	209561	You	4304	" "
209583	209600	209581	209581	Dorothea	189	" said Mr. Casaubon , with a shade more meekness than usual in his polite manner . "
209611	209612	209613	209613	I	0	" "
209625	209634	209613	209613	I	0	" said Dorothea , remembering Lydgate 's cautions . "
209649	209709	209724	209724	I	0	" Dorothea dared not insist , and she read for an hour or more on the same plan as she had done in the evening , but getting over the pages with more quickness . Mr. Casaubon 's mind was more alert , and he seemed to anticipate what was coming after a very slight verbal indication , saying , "
209715	209716	209724	209724	I	0	that"—or "
209732	209765	209724	209724	I	0	" Dorothea was amazed to think of the bird - like speed with which his mind was surveying the ground where it had been creeping for years . At last he said — "
209843	209844	209835	209835	You	6867	" "
209847	209860	209835	209835	You	6867	" said Dorothea , rather tremulously . She felt sick at heart . "
209872	209915	209863	209863	I	0	" said Mr. Casaubon . He laid down again and begged her to put out the lights . When she had lain down too , and there was a darkness only broken by a dull glow on the hearth , he said — "
209929	209930	209927	209927	Dorothea	189	" "
209935	209945	209949	209949	you	0	" said Dorothea , with dread in her mind . "
209992	210032	210033	210033	You	189	" Dorothea was not taken by surprise : many incidents had been leading her to the conjecture of some intention on her husband 's part which might make a new yoke for her . She did not answer immediately . "
210036	210048	210033	210033	You	189	" said Mr. Casaubon , with more edge in his tone . "
210057	210075	210033	210033	You	189	" said Dorothea , in a clear voice , the need of freedom asserting itself within her ; "
210113	210114	210116	210116	you	0	" "
210133	210134	210123	210123	I	0	" "
210141	210152	210123	210123	I	0	" said Dorothea , beseechingly , crushed by opposing fears . "
210196	210197	210198	210198	You	0	" "
210210	210211	210198	210198	You	0	" "
210219	210225	210198	210198	You	0	" said Dorothea , beseechingly . "
210232	210899	210900	210900	I	0	" said Mr. Casaubon . Soon she could hear that he was sleeping , but there was no more sleep for her . While she constrained herself to lie still lest she should disturb him , her mind was carrying on a conflict in which imagination ranged its forces first on one side and then on the other . She had no presentiment that the power which her husband wished to establish over her future action had relation to anything else than his work . But it was clear enough to her that he would expect her to devote herself to sifting those mixed heaps of material , which were to be the doubtful illustration of principles still more doubtful . The poor child had become altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key which had made the ambition and the labour of her husband 's life . It was not wonderful that , in spite of her small instruction , her judgment in this matter was truer than his : for she looked with unbiassed comparison and healthy sense at probabilities on which he had risked all his egoism . And now she pictured to herself the days , and months , and years which she must spend in sorting what might be called shattered mummies , and fragments of a tradition which was itself a mosaic wrought from crushed ruins — sorting them as food for a theory which was already withered in the birth like an elfin child . Doubtless a vigorous error vigorously pursued has kept the embryos of truth a - breathing : the quest of gold being at the same time a questioning of substances , the body of chemistry is prepared for its soul , and Lavoisier is born . But Mr. Casaubon 's theory of the elements which made the seed of all tradition was not likely to bruise itself unawares against discoveries : it floated among flexible conjectures no more solid than those etymologies which seemed strong because of likeness in sound until it was shown that likeness in sound made them impossible : it was a method of interpretation which was not tested by the necessity of forming anything which had sharper collisions than an elabourate notion of Gog and Magog : it was as free from interruption as a plan for threading the stars together . And Dorothea had so often had to check her weariness and impatience over this questionable riddle - guessing , as it revealed itself to her instead of the fellowship in high knowledge which was to make life worthier ! She could understand well enough now why her husband had come to cling to her , as possibly the only hope left that his labours would ever take a shape in which they could be given to the world . At first it had seemed that he wished to keep even her aloof from any close knowledge of what he was doing ; but gradually the terrible stringency of human need — the prospect of a too speedy death — And here Dorothea 's pity turned from her own future to her husband 's past — nay , to his present hard struggle with a lot which had grown out of that past : the lonely labour , the ambition breathing hardly under the pressure of self - distrust ; the goal receding , and the heavier limbs ; and now at last the sword visibly trembling above him ! And had she not wished to marry him that she might help him in his life 's labour?—But she had thought the work was to be something greater , which she could serve in devoutly for its own sake . Was it right , even to soothe his grief — would it be possible , even if she promised — to work as in a treadmill fruitlessly ? And yet , could she deny him ? Could she say , "
210908	211100	210900	210900	I	0	" It would be refusing to do for him dead , what she was almost sure to do for him living . If he lived as Lydgate had said he might , for fifteen years or more , her life would certainly be spent in helping him and obeying him . Still , there was a deep difference between that devotion to the living and that indefinite promise of devotion to the dead . While he lived , he could claim nothing that she would not still be free to remonstrate against , and even to refuse . But — the thought passed through her mind more than once , though she could not believe in it — might he not mean to demand something more from her than she had been able to imagine , since he wanted her pledge to carry out his wishes without telling her exactly what they were ? No ; his heart was bound up in his work only : that was the end for which his failing life was to be eked out by hers . And now , if she were to say , "
211114	211196	211107	211107	I	0	work"—it seemed as if she would be crushing that bruised heart . For four hours Dorothea lay in this conflict , till she felt ill and bewildered , unable to resolve , praying mutely . Helpless as a child which has sobbed and sought too long , she fell into a late morning sleep , and when she waked Mr. Casaubon was already up . Tantripp told her that he had read prayers , breakfasted , and was in the library . "
211207	211225	211205	211205	madam	6948	" said Tantripp , a solid - figured woman who had been with the sisters at Lausanne . "
211235	211242	211227	211227	I	0	" said Dorothea , smiling faintly . "
211298	211299	211283	211283	me	0	" "
211310	211314	211306	211306	me	0	" said Dorothea . "
211321	211374	211315	211316	Mr. Casaubon	189	" When she went down she felt sure that she should promise to fulfil his wishes ; but that would be later in the day — not yet . As Dorothea entered the library , Mr. Casaubon turned round from the table where he had been placing some books , and said — "
211430	211431	211432	211432	I	0	" "
211439	211443	211444	211444	Your	0	" said Dorothea . "
211456	211457	211458	211458	I	0	" "
211488	211489	211476	211476	You	189	" "
211501	211514	211491	211491	I	0	" said Dorothea , winning a little breathing space in that way . "
211531	211587	211515	211515	I	0	" said Mr. Casaubon , and then he left her . Dorothea , feeling very weary , rang and asked Tantripp to bring her some wraps . She had been sitting still for a few minutes , but not in any renewal of the former conflict : she simply felt that she was going to say "
211589	211654	211491	211491	I	0	" to her own doom : she was too weak , too full of dread at the thought of inflicting a keen - edged blow on her husband , to do anything but submit completely . She sat still and let Tantripp put on her bonnet and shawl , a passivity which was unusual with her , for she liked to wait on herself . "
211661	211741	211657	211657	you	4314	" said Tantripp , with an irrepressible movement of love towards the beautiful , gentle creature for whom she felt unable to do anything more , now that she had finished tying the bonnet . This was too much for Dorothea 's highly - strung feeling , and she burst into tears , sobbing against Tantripp 's arm . But soon she checked herself , dried her eyes , and went out at the glass door into the shrubbery . "
211758	211800	211801	211802	your master	4317	" said Tantripp to Pratt , the butler , finding him in the breakfast - room . She had been at Rome , and visited the antiquities , as we know ; and she always declined to call Mr. Casaubon anything but "
211804	212108	212109	212109	He	4319	" when speaking to the other servants . Pratt laughed . He liked his master very well , but he liked Tantripp better . When Dorothea was out on the gravel walks , she lingered among the nearer clumps of trees , hesitating , as she had done once before , though from a different cause . Then she had feared lest her effort at fellowship should be unwelcome ; now she dreaded going to the spot where she foresaw that she must bind herself to a fellowship from which she shrank . Neither law nor the world 's opinion compelled her to this — only her husband 's nature and her own compassion , only the ideal and not the real yoke of marriage . She saw clearly enough the whole situation , yet she was fettered : she could not smite the stricken soul that entreated hers . If that were weakness , Dorothea was weak . But the half - hour was passing , and she must not delay longer . When she entered the Yew - tree Walk she could not see her husband ; but the walk had bends , and she went , expecting to catch sight of his figure wrapped in a blue cloak , which , with a warm velvet cap , was his outer garment on chill days for the garden . It occurred to her that he might be resting in the summer - house , towards which the path diverged a little . Turning the angle , she could see him seated on the bench , close to a stone table . His arms were resting on the table , and his brow was bowed down on them , the blue cloak being dragged forward and screening his face on each side . "
212115	212203	212109	212109	He	4319	" Dorothea said to herself , thinking at first that he was asleep , and that the summer - house was too damp a place to rest in . But then she remembered that of late she had seen him take that attitude when she was reading to him , as if he found it easier than any other ; and that he would sometimes speak , as well as listen , with his face down in that way . She went into the summerhouse and said , "
212214	212241	212242	212242	I	0	" He took no notice , and she thought that he must be fast asleep . She laid her hand on his shoulder , and repeated , "
212246	212286	212242	212242	I	0	" Still he was motionless ; and with a sudden confused fear , she leaned down to him , took off his velvet cap , and leaned her cheek close to his head , crying in a distressed tone — "
212303	212384	212297	212297	I	0	" But Dorothea never gave her answer . Later in the day , Lydgate was seated by her bedside , and she was talking deliriously , thinking aloud , and recalling what had gone through her mind the night before . She knew him , and called him by his name , but appeared to think it right that she should explain everything to him ; and again , and again , begged him to explain everything to her husband . "
212430	212446	212447	212447	I	0	" But the silence in her husband 's ear was never more to be broken . "
212459	212526	212451	212451	we	4322	" said Sir James Chettam , with a little frown on his brow , and an expression of intense disgust about his mouth . He was standing on the hearth - rug in the library at Lowick Grange , and speaking to Mr. Brooke . It was the day after Mr. Casaubon had been buried , and Dorothea was not yet able to leave her room . "
212569	212597	212563	212563	her	4323	" said Mr. Brooke , sticking his eye - glasses on nervously , and exploring the edges of a folded paper which he held in his hand ; "
212635	212662	212663	212663	I	0	" Sir James looked at the carpet for a minute in silence , and then lifting his eyes suddenly fixed them on Mr. Brooke , saying , "
212743	212781	212734	212734	you	0	" Here Sir James 's look of disgust returned in all its intensity . Mr. Brooke put his hands behind him , walked to the window and straightened his back with a little shake before he replied . "
212795	212796	212787	212787	Chettam	177	" "
212801	212813	212787	212787	Chettam	177	" persisted Sir James , restraining his indignation within respectful forms , "
212838	212839	212823	212823	you	0	" "
212891	212905	212870	212870	I	0	" Mr. Brooke ended with a nod , turning round to give it . "
212989	212996	212965	212965	You	0	" Sir James was getting warm . "
213017	213018	213010	213010	I	0	" "
213031	213036	213037	213037	I	0	" interrupted Sir James . "
213094	213095	213098	213098	you	177	" "
213187	213188	213180	213180	he	568	" "
213203	213208	213180	213180	he	568	" said Sir James . "
213253	213254	213229	213229	she	4348	" "
213269	213285	213266	213266	you	177	" said Mr. Brooke , seating himself and sticking on his eye - glass again . "
213359	213360	213351	213351	she	4348	" "
213365	213372	213351	213351	she	4348	" said Sir James , impatiently , "
213399	213400	213385	213385	you	6934	" "
213457	213477	213440	213440	People	6815	" said Mr Brooke , becoming acute about the truths that lay on the side of his own wishes . "
213529	213567	213568	213569	Good God	650	" Mr. Brooke , persisting as quietly as if he were only discussing the nature of last year 's weather , and nodding at the end with his usual amenity , was an exasperating form of obstinacy . "
213571	213585	213568	213569	Good God	650	" said Sir James , with as much passion as he ever showed , "
213626	213627	213618	213618	I	0	" "

213712	213738	213702	213703	an agitator	4362	" said Sir James , with bitter emphasis , feeling that the syllables of this word properly repeated were a sufficient exposure of its hatefulness . "
213832	213833	213822	213822	Ladislaw	261	" "
213846	213847	213840	213840	you	4359	" "
213874	213875	213871	213872	a gentleman	7269	" "
213883	213897	213871	213872	a gentleman	7269	" said Sir James , his irritation making him forget himself a little . "
213905	213906	213901	213901	Casaubon	189	" "
213932	213933	213915	213915	he	189	" "
213940	213945	213934	213934	I	0	" said Sir James . "
213953	213954	213955	213960	One of poor Casaubon 's freaks	4368	" "
213984	213985	213976	213976	She	4367	" "
214012	214020	214001	214001	I	0	" said Sir James — then frowningly , "
214035	214036	214031	214031	I	0	" "
214103	214150	214098	214098	her	4367	" That Mr. Brooke had hit on an undeniable argument , did not tend to soothe Sir James . He put out his hand to reach his hat , implying that he did not mean to contend further , and said , still with some heat — "
214188	214189	214190	214190	You	4359	" "
214213	214592	214593	214593	Uncle	4375	" said Mr. Brooke , well pleased that he had won the argument . It would have been highly inconvenient to him to part with Ladislaw at that time , when a dissolution might happen any day , and electors were to be convinced of the course by which the interests of the country would be best served . Mr. Brooke sincerely believed that this end could be secured by his own return to Parliament : he offered the forces of his mind honestly to the nation . Dorothea had been safe at Freshitt Hall nearly a week before she had asked any dangerous questions . Every morning now she sat with Celia in the prettiest of up - stairs sitting - rooms , opening into a small conservatory — Celia all in white and lavender like a bunch of mixed violets , watching the remarkable acts of the baby , which were so dubious to her inexperienced mind that all conversation was interrupted by appeals for their interpretation made to the oracular nurse . Dorothea sat by in her widow 's dress , with an expression which rather provoked Celia , as being much too sad ; for not only was baby quite well , but really when a husband had been so dull and troublesome while he lived , and besides that had — well , well ! Sir James , of course , had told Celia everything , with a strong representation how important it was that Dorothea should not know it sooner than was inevitable . But Mr. Brooke had been right in predicting that Dorothea would not long remain passive where action had been assigned to her ; she knew the purport of her husband 's will made at the time of their marriage , and her mind , as soon as she was clearly conscious of her position , was silently occupied with what she ought to do as the owner of Lowick Manor with the patronage of the living attached to it . One morning when her uncle paid his usual visit , though with an unusual alacrity in his manner which he accounted for by saying that it was now pretty certain Parliament would be dissolved forthwith , Dorothea said — "
214673	214674	214678	214679	my dear	6867	" "
214681	214688	214678	214679	my dear	6867	" said Mr. Brooke , quietly . "
214805	214806	214807	214807	I	0	" "
214854	214877	214836	214836	He	189	" said Dorothea , who had all the while had this conjecture in her mind with relation to her husband 's work . "
214888	214907	214913	214913	you	6867	" said Mr. Brooke , rising to go away , and putting out his hand to his nieces : "
214921	214927	214948	214948	you	6867	" Dorothea 's lip quivered . "
214951	214952	214953	214953	I	0	" "
214967	214968	214961	214961	I	0	" "
215031	215092	215024	215024	I	0	" said Mr. Brooke , with placid hurry , anxious to get away and tell Chettam that it would not be his ( Mr. Brooke 's ) fault if Dorothea insisted on looking into everything . Dorothea sank back in her chair when her uncle had left the room , and cast her eyes down meditatively on her crossed hands . "
215109	215118	215121	215121	Kitty	216	" said Celia , in her comfortable staccato . "
215123	215133	215121	215121	Kitty	216	" said Dorothea , lifting her eyes rather absently . "
215182	215208	215173	215173	nurse	4392	" A large tear which had been for some time gathering , rolled down Dorothea 's cheek as she looked up and tried to smile . "
215246	215247	215248	215248	I	0	" "
215277	215278	215279	215279	You	184	" "
215342	215343	215333	215333	I	0	" "
215351	215466	215467	215467	I	0	" said Dorothea , quite meekly . She was almost ready now to think Celia wiser than herself , and was really wondering with some fear what her wrong notion was . Celia felt her advantage , and was determined to use it . None of them knew Dodo as well as she did , or knew how to manage her . Since Celia 's baby was born , she had had a new sense of her mental solidity and calm wisdom . It seemed clear that where there was a baby , things were right enough , and that error , in general , was a mere lack of that central poising force . "
215483	215487	215481	215481	Dodo	184	" said Celia . "
215563	215564	215565	215565	Celia	169	" "
215567	215573	215574	215574	you	169	" said Dorothea , entreatingly , "
215586	215611	215583	215583	you	169	" It glanced through her mind that Mr. Casaubon had left the property away from her — which would not be so very distressing . "
215641	215642	215638	215638	I	0	" "
215649	215657	215638	215638	I	0	" said Dorothea , breaking in impetuously . "
215669	215677	215660	215660	you	169	" Celia went on with persevering quietude . "
215706	215766	215767	215767	James	177	" The blood rushed to Dorothea 's face and neck painfully . But Celia was administering what she thought a sobering dose of fact . It was taking up notions that had done Dodo 's health so much harm . So she went on in her neutral tone , as if she had been remarking on baby 's robes . "
215872	216170	215870	215870	baby	10576	" Celia added , without the least change of tone , throwing a light shawl over her , and tripping away . Dorothea by this time had turned cold again , and now threw herself back helplessly in her chair . She might have compared her experience at that moment to the vague , alarmed consciousness that her life was taking on a new form , that she was undergoing a metamorphosis in which memory would not adjust itself to the stirring of new organs . Everything was changing its aspect : her husband 's conduct , her own duteous feeling towards him , every struggle between them — and yet more , her whole relation to Will Ladislaw . Her world was in a state of convulsive change ; the only thing she could say distinctly to herself was , that she must wait and think anew . One change terrified her as if it had been a sin ; it was a violent shock of repulsion from her departed husband , who had had hidden thoughts , perhaps perverting everything she said and did . Then again she was conscious of another change which also made her tremulous ; it was a sudden strange yearning of heart towards Will Ladislaw . It had never before entered her mind that he could , under any circumstances , be her lover : conceive the effect of the sudden revelation that another had thought of him in that light — that perhaps he himself had been conscious of such a possibility,—and this with the hurrying , crowding vision of unfitting conditions , and questions not soon to be solved . It seemed a long while — she did not know how long — before she heard Celia saying , "
216207	216231	216202	216202	I	0	" Celia went on , observing nothing more than that Dorothea was leaning back in her chair , and likely to be passive , "
216314	216389	216390	216390	I	0	" said Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and poise of the world , who had the most remarkable fists all complete even to the nails , and hair enough , really , when you took his cap off , to make — you did n't know what:—in short , he was Bouddha in a Western form . At this crisis Lydgate was announced , and one of the first things he said was , "
216416	216426	216427	216427	She	276	" Dorothea 's hand was of a marble coldness . "
216439	216443	216427	216427	She	276	" said Celia . "
216451	216469	216449	216449	she	276	" Lydgate did not speak for a few moments . Then he said , looking at Dorothea . "
216503	216504	216506	216506	you	0	" "
216508	216515	216506	216506	you	0	" said Dorothea , exerting herself , "
216542	216562	216563	216563	You	0	" Then , with an effort to recall subjects not connected with her agitation , she added , abruptly , "
216611	216640	216605	216606	Mr. Tyke	336	" But Dorothea 's effort was too much for her ; she broke off and burst into sobs . Lydgate made her drink a dose of sal volatile . "
216649	216666	216605	216606	Mr. Tyke	336	" he said to Sir James , whom he asked to see before quitting the house . "
216681	216818	216672	216672	I	0	" His attendance on Dorothea while her brain was excited , had enabled him to form some true conclusions concerning the trials of her life . He felt sure that she had been suffering from the strain and conflict of self - repression ; and that she was likely now to feel herself only in another sort of pinfold than that from which she had been released . Lydgate 's advice was all the easier for Sir James to follow when he found that Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact about the will . There was no help for it now — no reason for any further delay in the execution of necessary business . And the next day Sir James complied at once with her request that he would drive her to Lowick . "
216829	216833	216834	216834	I	0	" said Dorothea ; "
216903	216904	216908	216908	I	0	" "
216930	217217	216919	216919	you	0	" said Sir James , who at that moment thought of the Grange chiefly as a haunt of young Ladislaw 's . But no word passed between him and Dorothea about the objectionable part of the will ; indeed , both of them felt that the mention of it between them would be impossible . Sir James was shy , even with men , about disagreeable subjects ; and the one thing that Dorothea would have chosen to say , if she had spoken on the matter at all , was forbidden to her at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of her husband 's injustice . Yet she did wish that Sir James could know what had passed between her and her husband about Will Ladislaw 's moral claim on the property : it would then , she thought , be apparent to him as it was to her , that her husband 's strange indelicate proviso had been chiefly urged by his bitter resistance to that idea of claim , and not merely by personal feelings more difficult to talk about . Also , it must be admitted , Dorothea wished that this could be known for Will 's sake , since her friends seemed to think of him as simply an object of Mr. Casaubon 's charity . Why should he be compared with an Italian carrying white mice ? That word quoted from Mrs. Cadwallader seemed like a mocking travesty wrought in the dark by an impish finger . At Lowick Dorothea searched desk and drawer — searched all her husband 's places of deposit for private writing , but found no paper addressed especially to her , except that "
217221	217853	216919	216919	you	0	" which was probably only the beginning of many intended directions for her guidance . In carrying out this bequest of labour to Dorothea , as in all else , Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating , oppressed in the plan of transmitting his work , as he had been in executing it , by the sense of moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium : distrust of Dorothea 's competence to arrange what he had prepared was subdued only by distrust of any other redactor . But he had come at last to create a trust for himself out of Dorothea 's nature : she could do what she resolved to do : and he willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to erect a tomb with his name upon it . ( Not that Mr. Casaubon called the future volumes a tomb ; he called them the Key to all Mythologies . ) But the months gained on him and left his plans belated : he had only had time to ask for that promise by which he sought to keep his cold grasp on Dorothea 's life . The grasp had slipped away . Bound by a pledge given from the depths of her pity , she would have been capable of undertaking a toil which her judgment whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of faithfulness which is a supreme use . But now her judgment , instead of being controlled by duteous devotion , was made active by the imbittering discovery that in her past union there had lurked the hidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion . The living , suffering man was no longer before her to awaken her pity : there remained only the retrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been lower than she had believed , whose exorbitant claims for himself had even blinded his scrupulous care for his own character , and made him defeat his own pride by shocking men of ordinary honour . As for the property which was the sign of that broken tie , she would have been glad to be free from it and have nothing more than her original fortune which had been settled on her , if there had not been duties attached to ownership , which she ought not to flinch from . About this property many troublous questions insisted on rising : had she not been right in thinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?—but was it not impossible now for her to do that act of justice ? Mr. Casaubon had taken a cruelly effective means of hindering her : even with indignation against him in her heart , any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of his purpose revolted her . After collecting papers of business which she wished to examine , she locked up again the desks and drawers — all empty of personal words for her — empty of any sign that in her husband 's lonely brooding his heart had gone out to her in excuse or explanation ; and she went back to Freshitt with the sense that around his last hard demand and his last injurious assertion of his power , the silence was unbroken . Dorothea tried now to turn her thoughts towards immediate duties , and one of these was of a kind which others were determined to remind her of . Lydgate 's ear had caught eagerly her mention of the living , and as soon as he could , he reopened the subject , seeing here a possibility of making amends for the casting - vote he had once given with an ill - satisfied conscience . "
217863	217867	217860	217861	Mr. Tyke	336	" he said , "
217997	217998	217986	217986	he	335	" "
218006	218022	217986	217986	he	335	" said Dorothea , interested now in all who had slipped below their own intention . "
218029	218033	217986	217986	he	335	" said Lydgate . "
218228	218229	218230	218230	I	0	" "
218243	218247	218230	218230	I	0	" said Dorothea ; "
218259	218260	218261	218261	I	0	" "
218289	218290	218291	218291	My	0	" "
218305	218345	218295	218296	Mr. Tyke	336	" said Dorothea , meditatively . She was wishing it were possible to restore the times of primitive zeal , and yet thinking of Mr. Farebrother with a strong desire to rescue him from his chance - gotten money . "
218357	218361	218346	218346	I	0	" said Lydgate . "
218475	218476	218461	218462	St. Francis	658	" "
218479	218483	218461	218462	St. Francis	658	" said Dorothea . "
218629	218630	218626	218626	him	335	" "
218633	218637	218638	218638	I	0	" said Lydgate ; "
218823	219127	218821	218821	him	261	" Happily Dorothea was in her private sitting - room when this conversation occurred , and there was no one present to make Lydgate 's innocent introduction of Ladislaw painful to her . As was usual with him in matters of personal gossip , Lydgate had quite forgotten Rosamond 's remark that she thought Will adored Mrs. Casaubon . At that moment he was only caring for what would recommend the Farebrother family ; and he had purposely given emphasis to the worst that could be said about the Vicar , in order to forestall objections . In the weeks since Mr. Casaubon 's death he had hardly seen Ladislaw , and he had heard no rumor to warn him that Mr. Brooke 's confidential secretary was a dangerous subject with Mrs. Casaubon . When he was gone , his picture of Ladislaw lingered in her mind and disputed the ground with that question of the Lowick living . What was Will Ladislaw thinking about her ? Would he hear of that fact which made her cheeks burn as they never used to do ? And how would he feel when he heard it?—But she could see as well as possible how he smiled down at the little old maid . An Italian with white mice!—on the contrary , he was a creature who entered into every one 's feelings , and could take the pressure of their thought instead of urging his own with iron resistance . No gossip about Mr. Casaubon 's will had yet reached Ladislaw : the air seemed to be filled with the dissolution of Parliament and the coming election , as the old wakes and fairs were filled with the rival clatter of itinerant shows ; and more private noises were taken little notice of . The famous "
219130	219212	219215	219215	you	4458	" was at hand , in which the depths of public feeling might be measured by the low flood - mark of drink . Will Ladislaw was one of the busiest at this time ; and though Dorothea 's widowhood was continually in his thought , he was so far from wishing to be spoken to on the subject , that when Lydgate sought him out to tell him what had passed about the Lowick living , he answered rather waspishly — "
219270	219498	219499	219499	We	4461	" The fact was that Will had been made the more susceptible by observing that Mr. Brooke , instead of wishing him , as before , to come to the Grange oftener than was quite agreeable to himself , seemed now to contrive that he should go there as little as possible . This was a shuffling concession of Mr. Brooke 's to Sir James Chettam 's indignant remonstrance ; and Will , awake to the slightest hint in this direction , concluded that he was to be kept away from the Grange on Dorothea 's account . Her friends , then , regarded him with some suspicion ? Their fears were quite superfluous : they were very much mistaken if they imagined that he would put himself forward as a needy adventurer trying to win the favour of a rich woman . Until now Will had never fully seen the chasm between himself and Dorothea — until now that he was come to the brink of it , and saw her on the other side . He began , not without some inward rage , to think of going away from the neighborhood : it would be impossible for him to show any further interest in Dorothea without subjecting himself to disagreeable imputations — perhaps even in her mind , which others might try to poison . "
219504	219508	219499	219499	We	4461	" said Will . "
219525	219575	219517	219517	she	4462	" But what we call our despair is often only the painful eagerness of unfed hope . There were plenty of reasons why he should not go — public reasons why he should not quit his post at this crisis , leaving Mr. Brooke in the lurch when he needed "
219577	219700	219499	219499	We	4461	" for the election , and when there was so much canvassing , direct and indirect , to be carried on . Will could not like to leave his own chessmen in the heat of a game ; and any candidate on the right side , even if his brain and marrow had been as soft as was consistent with a gentlemanly bearing , might help to turn a majority . To coach Mr. Brooke and keep him steadily to the idea that he must pledge himself to vote for the actual Reform Bill , instead of insisting on his independence and power of pulling up in time , was not an easy task . Mr. Farebrother 's prophecy of a fourth candidate "
219704	219904	219905	219905	You	4463	" had not yet been fulfilled , neither the Parliamentary Candidate Society nor any other power on the watch to secure a reforming majority seeing a worthy nodus for interference while there was a second reforming candidate like Mr. Brooke , who might be returned at his own expense ; and the fight lay entirely between Pinkerton the old Tory member , Bagster the new Whig member returned at the last election , and Brooke the future independent member , who was to fetter himself for this occasion only . Mr. Hawley and his party would bend all their forces to the return of Pinkerton , and Mr. Brooke 's success must depend either on plumpers which would leave Bagster in the rear , or on the new minting of Tory votes into reforming votes . The latter means , of course , would be preferable . This prospect of converting votes was a dangerous distraction to Mr. Brooke : his impression that waverers were likely to be allured by wavering statements , and also the liability of his mind to stick afresh at opposing arguments as they turned up in his memory , gave Will Ladislaw much trouble . "
219914	219919	219517	219517	she	4462	" said Mr. Brooke ; "
220026	220027	219986	219986	Ladislaw	261	" "
220033	220039	219986	219986	Ladislaw	261	" said Will , impatiently . "
220085	220394	220397	220397	his	4470	" Mr. Brooke always ended by agreeing with Ladislaw , who still appeared to him a sort of Burke with a leaven of Shelley ; but after an interval the wisdom of his own methods reasserted itself , and he was again drawn into using them with much hopefulness . At this stage of affairs he was in excellent spirits , which even supported him under large advances of money ; for his powers of convincing and persuading had not yet been tested by anything more difficult than a chairman 's speech introducing other orators , or a dialogue with a Middlemarch voter , from which he came away with a sense that he was a tactician by nature , and that it was a pity he had not gone earlier into this kind of thing . He was a little conscious of defeat , however , with Mr. Mawmsey , a chief representative in Middlemarch of that great social power , the retail trader , and naturally one of the most doubtful voters in the borough — willing for his own part to supply an equal quality of teas and sugars to reformer and anti - reformer , as well as to agree impartially with both , and feeling like the burgesses of old that this necessity of electing members was a great burthen to a town ; for even if there were no danger in holding out hopes to all parties beforehand , there would be the painful necessity at last of disappointing respectable people whose names were on his books . He was accustomed to receive large orders from Mr. Brooke of Tipton ; but then , there were many of Pinkerton 's committee whose opinions had a great weight of grocery on their side . Mr. Mawmsey thinking that Mr. Brooke , as not too "
220400	220425	220397	220397	his	4470	" was the more likely to forgive a grocer who gave a hostile vote under pressure , had become confidential in his back parlor . "
220439	220455	220430	220430	sir	6934	" he said , rattling the small silver in his pocket , and smiling affably . "
220597	220598	220594	220595	Mr. Brooke	175	" "
220625	220632	220622	220623	Mr. Mawmsey	615	" said Mr. Brooke , soothingly , "
220658	220659	220660	220660	Sir	6934	" "
220672	220686	220662	220662	I	0	" said Mr. Mawmsey , feeling that politics were clearing up a little . "
220704	220705	220695	220702	a gentleman who speaks in that honourable manner	4486	" "
220842	220875	220876	220876	I	0	" Mr. Brooke ended , with a sense of being a little out at sea , though finding it still enjoyable . But Mr. Mawmsey answered in a tone of decisive check . "
221097	221621	221047	221047	I	0	" After this conversation Mr. Mawmsey went up and boasted to his wife that he had been rather too many for Brooke of Tipton , and that he did n't mind so much now about going to the poll . Mr. Brooke on this occasion abstained from boasting of his tactics to Ladislaw , who for his part was glad enough to persuade himself that he had no concern with any canvassing except the purely argumentative sort , and that he worked no meaner engine than knowledge . Mr. Brooke , necessarily , had his agents , who understood the nature of the Middlemarch voter and the means of enlisting his ignorance on the side of the Bill — which were remarkably similar to the means of enlisting it on the side against the Bill . Will stopped his ears . Occasionally Parliament , like the rest of our lives , even to our eating and apparel , could hardly go on if our imaginations were too active about processes . There were plenty of dirty - handed men in the world to do dirty business ; and Will protested to himself that his share in bringing Mr. Brooke through would be quite innocent . But whether he should succeed in that mode of contributing to the majority on the right side was very doubtful to him . He had written out various speeches and memoranda for speeches , but he had begun to perceive that Mr. Brooke 's mind , if it had the burthen of remembering any train of thought , would let it drop , run away in search of it , and not easily come back again . To collect documents is one mode of serving your country , and to remember the contents of a document is another . No ! the only way in which Mr. Brooke could be coerced into thinking of the right arguments at the right time was to be well plied with them till they took up all the room in his brain . But here there was the difficulty of finding room , so many things having been taken in beforehand . Mr. Brooke himself observed that his ideas stood rather in his way when he was speaking . However , Ladislaw 's coaching was forthwith to be put to the test , for before the day of nomination Mr. Brooke was to explain himself to the worthy electors of Middlemarch from the balcony of the White Hart , which looked out advantageously at an angle of the market - place , commanding a large area in front and two converging streets . It was a fine May morning , and everything seemed hopeful : there was some prospect of an understanding between Bagster 's committee and Brooke 's , to which Mr. Bulstrode , Mr. Standish as a Liberal lawyer , and such manufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr. Vincy , gave a solidity which almost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and his associates who sat for Pinkerton at the Green Dragon . Mr. Brooke , conscious of having weakened the blasts of the "
221623	221684	221047	221047	I	0	" against him , by his reforms as a landlord in the last half year , and hearing himself cheered a little as he drove into the town , felt his heart tolerably light under his buff - coloured waistcoat . But with regard to critical occasions , it often happens that all moments seem comfortably remote until the last . "
221691	221700	221047	221047	I	0	" said Mr. Brooke as the crowd gathered . "
221733	221887	221712	221712	I	0	" The weavers and tanners of Middlemarch , unlike Mr. Mawmsey , had never thought of Mr. Brooke as a neighbor , and were not more attached to him than if he had been sent in a box from London . But they listened without much disturbance to the speakers who introduced the candidate , one of them — a political personage from Brassing , who came to tell Middlemarch its duty — spoke so fully , that it was alarming to think what the candidate could find to say after him . Meanwhile the crowd became denser , and as the political personage neared the end of his speech , Mr. Brooke felt a remarkable change in his sensations while he still handled his eye - glass , trifled with documents before him , and exchanged remarks with his committee , as a man to whom the moment of summons was indifferent . "
221898	222089	221896	221896	Ladislaw	261	" he said , with an easy air , to Will , who was close behind him , and presently handed him the supposed fortifier . It was ill - chosen ; for Mr. Brooke was an abstemious man , and to drink a second glass of sherry quickly at no great interval from the first was a surprise to his system which tended to scatter his energies instead of collecting them . Pray pity him : so many English gentlemen make themselves miserable by speechifying on entirely private grounds ! whereas Mr. Brooke wished to serve his country by standing for Parliament — which , indeed , may also be done on private grounds , but being once undertaken does absolutely demand some speechifying . It was not about the beginning of his speech that Mr. Brooke was at all anxious ; this , he felt sure , would be all right ; he should have it quite pat , cut out as neatly as a set of couplets from Pope . Embarking would be easy , but the vision of open sea that might come after was alarming . "
222095	222106	222107	222107	somebody	6778	" hinted the demon just waking up in his stomach , "
222115	222121	222107	222107	somebody	6778	" he continued , aloud , "
222131	222184	222107	222107	somebody	6778	" When Mr. Brooke presented himself on the balcony , the cheers were quite loud enough to counterbalance the yells , groans , brayings , and other expressions of adverse theory , which were so moderate that Mr. Standish ( decidedly an old bird ) observed in the ear next to him , "
222201	222276	222277	222277	Gentlemen	1716	" Still , the cheers were exhilarating , and no candidate could look more amiable than Mr. Brooke , with the memorandum in his breast - pocket , his left hand on the rail of the balcony , and his right trifling with his eye - glass . The striking points in his appearance were his buff waistcoat , short - clipped blond hair , and neutral physiognomy . He began with some confidence . "
222283	222300	222277	222277	Gentlemen	1716	" This was so much the right thing that a little pause after it seemed natural . "
222327	222361	222324	222324	you	4506	" This was a bold figure of speech , but not exactly the right thing ; for , unhappily , the pat opening had slipped away — even couplets from Pope may be but "
222368	222400	222324	222324	you	4506	" when fear clutches us , and a glass of sherry is hurrying like smoke among our ideas . Ladislaw , who stood at the window behind the speaker , thought , "
222428	222456	222457	222457	I	0	" Mr. Brooke , meanwhile , having lost other clews , fell back on himself and his qualifications — always an appropriate graceful subject for a candidate . "
222658	222870	222871	222872	The Baltic	116	" Plying among his recollections in this way , Mr. Brooke might have got along , easily to himself , and would have come back from the remotest seas without trouble ; but a diabolical procedure had been set up by the enemy . At one and the same moment there had risen above the shoulders of the crowd , nearly opposite Mr. Brooke , and within ten yards of him , the effigy of himself : buff - coloured waistcoat , eye - glass , and neutral physiognomy , painted on rag ; and there had arisen , apparently in the air , like the note of the cuckoo , a parrot - like , Punch - voiced echo of his words . Everybody looked up at the open windows in the houses at the opposite angles of the converging streets ; but they were either blank , or filled by laughing listeners . The most innocent echo has an impish mockery in it when it follows a gravely persistent speaker , and this echo was not at all innocent ; if it did not follow with the precision of a natural echo , it had a wicked choice of the words it overtook . By the time it said , "
222876	222912	222871	222872	The Baltic	116	" the laugh which had been running through the audience became a general shout , and but for the sobering effects of party and that great public cause which the entanglement of things had identified with "
222917	223091	222913	222915	Brooke of Tipton	175	" the laugh might have caught his committee . Mr. Bulstrode asked , reprehensively , what the new police was doing ; but a voice could not well be collared , and an attack on the effigy of the candidate would have been too equivocal , since Hawley probably meant it to be pelted . Mr. Brooke himself was not in a position to be quickly conscious of anything except a general slipping away of ideas within himself : he had even a little singing in the ears , and he was the only person who had not yet taken distinct account of the echo or discerned the image of himself . Few things hold the perceptions more thoroughly captive than anxiety about what we have got to say . Mr. Brooke heard the laughter ; but he had expected some Tory efforts at disturbance , and he was at this moment additionally excited by the tickling , stinging sense that his lost exordium was coming back to fetch him from the Baltic . "
223096	223115	222913	222915	Brooke of Tipton	175	" he went on , thrusting a hand into his side - pocket , with an easy air , "
223176	223177	223160	223160	he	665	" "
223187	223212	223182	223182	we	4517	" said a loud rough voice from the crowd below . Immediately the invisible Punch , who had hitherto followed Mr. Brooke , repeated , "
223222	223268	223182	223182	we	4517	" The laugh was louder than ever , and for the first time Mr. Brooke being himself silent , heard distinctly the mocking echo . But it seemed to ridicule his interrupter , and in that light was encouraging ; so he replied with amenity — "
223318	223358	223359	223359	You	4516	Bill"—here Mr. Brooke paused a moment to fix on his eye - glass and take the paper from his breast - pocket , with a sense of being practical and coming to particulars . The invisible Punch followed : — "
223390	223449	223359	223359	You	4516	" Mr. Brooke , amid the roars of laughter , turned red , let his eye - glass fall , and looking about him confusedly , saw the image of himself , which had come nearer . The next moment he saw it dolorously bespattered with eggs . His spirit rose a little , and his voice too . "
223464	223480	223359	223359	You	4516	well"—here an unpleasant egg broke on Mr. Brooke 's shoulder , as the echo said , "
223487	223598	223359	223359	You	4516	" then came a hail of eggs , chiefly aimed at the image , but occasionally hitting the original , as if by chance . There was a stream of new men pushing among the crowd ; whistles , yells , bellowings , and fifes made all the greater hubbub because there was shouting and struggling to put them down . No voice would have had wing enough to rise above the uproar , and Mr. Brooke , disagreeably anointed , stood his ground no longer . The frustration would have been less exasperating if it had been less gamesome and boyish : a serious assault of which the newspaper reporter "
223610	223617	223359	223359	You	4516	" or can respectfully bear witness to "
223632	223659	223359	223359	You	4516	" has perhaps more consolations attached to it . Mr. Brooke re - entered the committee - room , saying , as carelessly as he could , "
223709	223717	223706	223706	you	4523	" he added , glancing at Ladislaw . "
223729	223770	223773	223773	Bowyer	377	" But it was not resolved unanimously that things would come right ; on the contrary , the committee looked rather grim , and the political personage from Brassing was writing busily , as if he were brewing new devices . "
223778	223785	223773	223773	Bowyer	377	" said Mr. Standish , evasively . "
223833	223834	223815	223815	Hawley	405	" "
223858	223880	223850	223850	I	0	" said poor Mr. Brooke , who had gone through a great deal of inviting for the good of his country . "
223893	223899	223850	223850	I	0	" said Ladislaw , indignantly , "
223915	223929	223905	223907	the paltry fellows	4526	" Will was thoroughly out of temper with himself as well as with his "
223932	223952	223905	223907	the paltry fellows	4526	" and he went to shut himself in his rooms with a half - formed resolve to throw up the "
223954	224236	224238	224238	his	4527	" and Mr. Brooke together . Why should he stay ? If the impassable gulf between himself and Dorothea were ever to be filled up , it must rather be by his going away and getting into a thoroughly different position than by staying here and slipping into deserved contempt as an understrapper of Brooke 's . Then came the young dream of wonders that he might do — in five years , for example : political writing , political speaking , would get a higher value now public life was going to be wider and more national , and they might give him such distinction that he would not seem to be asking Dorothea to step down to him . Five years:—if he could only be sure that she cared for him more than for others ; if he could only make her aware that he stood aloof until he could tell his love without lowering himself — then he could go away easily , and begin a career which at five - and - twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of things , where talent brings fame , and fame everything else which is delightful . He could speak and he could write ; he could master any subject if he chose , and he meant always to take the side of reason and justice , on which he would carry all his ardor . Why should he not one day be lifted above the shoulders of the crowd , and feel that he had won that eminence well ? Without doubt he would leave Middlemarch , go to town , and make himself fit for celebrity by "
224241	224393	224394	224394	I	0	" But not immediately : not until some kind of sign had passed between him and Dorothea . He could not be satisfied until she knew why , even if he were the man she would choose to marry , he would not marry her . Hence he must keep his post and bear with Mr. Brooke a little longer . But he soon had reason to suspect that Mr. Brooke had anticipated him in the wish to break up their connection . Deputations without and voices within had concurred in inducing that philanthropist to take a stronger measure than usual for the good of mankind ; namely , to withdraw in favour of another candidate , to whom he left the advantages of his canvassing machinery . He himself called this a strong measure , but observed that his health was less capable of sustaining excitement than he had imagined . "
224412	224422	224423	224423	I	0	" he said to Ladislaw in explaining the affair . "
224510	224511	224492	224495	A more ordinary man	4531	" "
224521	224556	224513	224513	you	4528	" said Will , the quick colour coming in his face , as he rose from the writing - table , and took a turn of three steps with his hands in his pockets . "
224568	224569	224557	224557	I	0	" "
224724	224725	224722	224722	Althorpe	667	" "
224733	224739	224726	224726	I	0	" said Ladislaw , proudly . "
224774	224786	224787	224791	The rest of the family	4541	" After Mr. Brooke had left him Will said to himself , "
224837	224932	224831	224831	they	4541	" On that June evening when Mr. Farebrother knew that he was to have the Lowick living , there was joy in the old fashioned parlor , and even the portraits of the great lawyers seemed to look on with satisfaction . His mother left her tea and toast untouched , but sat with her usual pretty primness , only showing her emotion by that flush in the cheeks and brightness in the eyes which give an old woman a touching momentary identity with her far - off youthful self , and saying decisively — "
224946	224947	224937	224937	Camden	390	" "
224965	225026	224956	224956	mother	7322	" said the son , brimful of pleasure , and not trying to conceal it . The gladness in his face was of that active kind which seems to have energy enough not only to flash outwardly , but to light up busy vision within : one seemed to see thoughts , as well as delight , in his glances . "
225031	225055	225029	225029	aunt	8094	" he went on , rubbing his hands and looking at Miss Noble , who was making tender little beaver - like noises , "
225100	225136	225091	225091	you	8094	" Miss Noble nodded at her nephew with a subdued half - frightened laugh , conscious of having already dropped an additional lump of sugar into her basket on the strength of the new preferment . "
225141	225144	225091	225091	you	8094	Winny"—the Vicar went on—"I
225175	225207	225208	225208	You	8094	" Miss Winifred , who had been looking at her brother all the while and crying heartily , which was her way of rejoicing , smiled through her tears and said , "
225222	225223	225226	225226	my	0	" "
225244	225261	225237	225237	I	0	" said the Vicar , rising , pushing his chair away and looking down at himself . "

225292	225298	225277	225277	Camden	390	" said the old lady . "

225324	225325	225315	225315	She	313	" "
225360	225370	225355	225355	everybody	1040	" said the Vicar , not caring to specify . "
225377	225382	225371	225371	We	4555	" said Miss Winifred . "
225396	225397	225387	225388	Miss Garth	313	" "
225406	225415	225387	225388	Miss Garth	313	" said Mrs. Farebrother , with majestic discretion , "
225449	225465	225440	225441	Henrietta Noble	670	" ( Mrs. Farebrother always called her tiny old sister by that magnificent name . ) "
225475	225476	225473	225473	mother	7322	" "
225496	225526	225527	225527	I	0	" said Mrs. Farebrother , innocent of the meaning that whist had for her son , and speaking rather sharply , as at some dangerous countenancing of new doctrine . "
225541	225563	225535	225535	I	0	" said the Vicar , preferring not to discuss the virtues of that game . He had already said to Dorothea , "
225613	225614	225615	225615	I	0	" "
225621	225625	225615	225615	I	0	" said Dorothea . "

225700	225763	225685	225685	I	0	" said Mr. Farebrother . His was one of the natures in which conscience gets the more active when the yoke of life ceases to gall them . He made no display of humility on the subject , but in his heart he felt rather ashamed that his conduct had shown laches which others who did not get benefices were free from . "
225778	225784	225764	225764	I	0	" he said to Lydgate , "
225826	225908	225909	225909	I	0	" he ended , smiling . The Vicar did feel then as if his share of duties would be easy . But Duty has a trick of behaving unexpectedly — something like a heavy friend whom we have amiably asked to visit us , and who breaks his leg within our gates . Hardly a week later , Duty presented itself in his study under the disguise of Fred Vincy , now returned from Omnibus College with his bachelor 's degree . "
225919	225930	225916	225917	Mr. Farebrother	335	" said Fred , whose fair open face was propitiating , "

226082	226093	226068	226068	he	2000	" Fred paused again an instant , and then repeated , "

226310	226347	226295	226298	those who say so	4584	" Fred 's voice had taken a tone of grumbling remonstrance , and Mr. Farebrother might have been inclined to smile if his mind had not been too busy in imagining more than Fred told him . "
226359	226376	226295	226298	those who say so	4584	" he said , trying hard to think of the question simply for Fred 's sake . "
226435	226442	226443	226443	I	0	" said Fred , quite simply . "
226468	226469	226454	226454	you	4586	" "

227132	227156	227119	227119	She	301	" There was a moment 's silence before Mr. Farebrother laid down his work , and putting out his hand to Fred said — "
227170	227190	227163	227163	I	0	" That very day Mr. Farebrother went to Lowick parsonage on the nag which he had just set up . "
227198	227202	227203	227205	the young growths	4613	" he thought , "
227211	227329	227330	227330	Fly	672	" He found Mary in the garden gathering roses and sprinkling the petals on a sheet . The sun was low , and tall trees sent their shadows across the grassy walks where Mary was moving without bonnet or parasol . She did not observe Mr. Farebrother 's approach along the grass , and had just stooped down to lecture a small black - and - tan terrier , which would persist in walking on the sheet and smelling at the rose - leaves as Mary sprinkled them . She took his fore - paws in one hand , and lifted up the forefinger of the other , while the dog wrinkled his brows and looked embarrassed . "
227340	227349	227334	227334	I	0	" Mary was saying in a grave contralto . "
227369	227370	227359	227359	anybody	2191	" "
227381	227398	227378	227379	Miss Garth	313	" said the Vicar , within two yards of her . Mary started up and blushed . "
227407	227413	227405	227405	Fly	672	" she said , laughingly . "
227420	227421	227427	227427	I	0	" "

He meant to give Fred his full advantage , but it would be well , he thought , to clear her mind of any superstitions , such as women sometimes follow when they do a man the wrong of marrying him as an act of atonement . Mary 's cheeks had begun to burn a little , and she was mute . "

227956	227957	227950	227950	you	0	" "
228182	228196	228158	228158	his	282	" Mary looked so much moved , that he said after a moment , "
228203	228212	228158	228158	his	282	" and when they were walking he added , "
228253	228254	228255	228255	I	0	" "
228322	228343	228344	228344	He	282	" said Mary , with a returning sparkle of playfulness in her answer which only made its modesty more charming . "
228354	228359	228344	228344	He	282	" said Mr. Farebrother . "
228370	228380	228360	228360	I	0	" said Mary , not choosing to go deeper . "
228504	228527	228528	228529	Young women	4556	" Mary checked herself . She had been carried along as if she had been speaking to Fred instead of Mr. Farebrother . "
228571	228572	228557	228557	you	4640	" "
228604	228605	228595	228595	He	352	" "
228622	228628	228614	228615	a clergyman	816	" Mary shook her head . "
228661	228662	228663	228663	I	0	" "
228680	228692	228673	228673	I	0	" Mary answered , with a slight resentment in her manner . "
228719	228754	228755	228755	I	0	" Mr. Farebrother was silent for a minute or more , and then , as they turned and paused under the shadow of a maple at the end of a grassy walk , said , "
228864	228996	228856	228856	her	6894	" Mary in her turn was silent , wondering not at Mr. Farebrother 's manner but at his tone , which had a grave restrained emotion in it . When the strange idea flashed across her that his words had reference to himself , she was incredulous , and ashamed of entertaining it . She had never thought that any man could love her except Fred , who had espoused her with the umbrella ring , when she wore socks and little strapped shoes ; still less that she could be of any importance to Mr. Farebrother , the cleverest man in her narrow circle . She had only time to feel that all this was hazy and perhaps illusory ; but one thing was clear and determined — her answer . "
229146	229147	229137	229137	He	282	" "
229156	229168	229149	229149	I	0	" said Mr. Farebrother , putting out his hand to Mary , "
229209	229210	229207	229207	you	4650	" "
229224	229277	229218	229218	me	0	" said Mary . Her eyes filled with tears , for something indefinable , something like the resolute suppression of a pain in Mr. Farebrother 's manner , made her feel suddenly miserable , as she had once felt when she saw her father 's hands trembling in a moment of trouble . "
229290	229404	229406	229406	himself	4652	" In three minutes the Vicar was on horseback again , having gone magnanimously through a duty much harder than the renunciation of whist , or even than the writing of penitential meditations . Mr. Bulstrode , when he was hoping to acquire a new interest in Lowick , had naturally had an especial wish that the new clergyman should be one whom he thoroughly approved ; and he believed it to be a chastisement and admonition directed to his own shortcomings and those of the nation at large , that just about the time when he came in possession of the deeds which made him the proprietor of Stone Court , Mr. Farebrother "
229407	230239	229406	229406	himself	4652	" into the quaint little church and preached his first sermon to the congregation of farmers , labourers , and village artisans . It was not that Mr. Bulstrode intended to frequent Lowick Church or to reside at Stone Court for a good while to come : he had bought the excellent farm and fine homestead simply as a retreat which he might gradually enlarge as to the land and beautify as to the dwelling , until it should be conducive to the divine glory that he should enter on it as a residence , partially withdrawing from his present exertions in the administration of business , and throwing more conspicuously on the side of Gospel truth the weight of local landed proprietorship , which Providence might increase by unforeseen occasions of purchase . A strong leading in this direction seemed to have been given in the surprising facility of getting Stone Court , when every one had expected that Mr. Rigg Featherstone would have clung to it as the Garden of Eden . That was what poor old Peter himself had expected ; having often , in imagination , looked up through the sods above him , and , unobstructed by perspective , seen his frog - faced legatee enjoying the fine old place to the perpetual surprise and disappointment of other survivors . But how little we know what would make paradise for our neighbors ! We judge from our own desires , and our neighbors themselves are not always open enough even to throw out a hint of theirs . The cool and judicious Joshua Rigg had not allowed his parent to perceive that Stone Court was anything less than the chief good in his estimation , and he had certainly wished to call it his own . But as Warren Hastings looked at gold and thought of buying Daylesford , so Joshua Rigg looked at Stone Court and thought of buying gold . He had a very distinct and intense vision of his chief good , the vigorous greed which he had inherited having taken a special form by dint of circumstance : and his chief good was to be a moneychanger . From his earliest employment as an errand - boy in a seaport , he had looked through the windows of the moneychangers as other boys look through the windows of the pastry - cooks ; the fascination had wrought itself gradually into a deep special passion ; he meant , when he had property , to do many things , one of them being to marry a genteel young person ; but these were all accidents and joys that imagination could dispense with . The one joy after which his soul thirsted was to have a money - changer 's shop on a much - frequented quay , to have locks all round him of which he held the keys , and to look sublimely cool as he handled the breeding coins of all nations , while helpless Cupidity looked at him enviously from the other side of an iron lattice . The strength of that passion had been a power enabling him to master all the knowledge necessary to gratify it . And when others were thinking that he had settled at Stone Court for life , Joshua himself was thinking that the moment now was not far off when he should settle on the North Quay with the best appointments in safes and locks . Enough . We are concerned with looking at Joshua Rigg 's sale of his land from Mr. Bulstrode 's point of view , and he interpreted it as a cheering dispensation conveying perhaps a sanction to a purpose which he had for some time entertained without external encouragement ; he interpreted it thus , but not too confidently , offering up his thanksgiving in guarded phraseology . His doubts did not arise from the possible relations of the event to Joshua Rigg 's destiny , which belonged to the unmapped regions not taken under the providential government , except perhaps in an imperfect colonial way ; but they arose from reflecting that this dispensation too might be a chastisement for himself , as Mr. Farebrother 's induction to the living clearly was . This was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of deceiving him : it was what he said to himself — it was as genuinely his mode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be , if you happen to disagree with him . For the egoism which enters into our theories does not affect their sincerity ; rather , the more our egoism is satisfied , the more robust is our belief . However , whether for sanction or for chastisement , Mr. Bulstrode , hardly fifteen months after the death of Peter Featherstone , had become the proprietor of Stone Court , and what Peter would say "
230247	230333	229406	229406	himself	4652	" had become an inexhaustible and consolatory subject of conversation to his disappointed relatives . The tables were now turned on that dear brother departed , and to contemplate the frustration of his cunning by the superior cunning of things in general was a cud of delight to Solomon . Mrs. Waule had a melancholy triumph in the proof that it did not answer to make false Featherstones and cut off the genuine ; and Sister Martha receiving the news in the Chalky Flats said , "
230353	230726	230339	230340	the Almighty	7431	" Affectionate Mrs. Bulstrode was particularly glad of the advantage which her husband 's health was likely to get from the purchase of Stone Court . Few days passed without his riding thither and looking over some part of the farm with the bailiff , and the evenings were delicious in that quiet spot , when the new hay - ricks lately set up were sending forth odors to mingle with the breath of the rich old garden . One evening , while the sun was still above the horizon and burning in golden lamps among the great walnut boughs , Mr. Bulstrode was pausing on horseback outside the front gate waiting for Caleb Garth , who had met him by appointment to give an opinion on a question of stable drainage , and was now advising the bailiff in the rick - yard . Mr. Bulstrode was conscious of being in a good spiritual frame and more than usually serene , under the influence of his innocent recreation . He was doctrinally convinced that there was a total absence of merit in himself ; but that doctrinal conviction may be held without pain when the sense of demerit does not take a distinct shape in memory and revive the tingling of shame or the pang of remorse . Nay , it may be held with intense satisfaction when the depth of our sinning is but a measure for the depth of forgiveness , and a clenching proof that we are peculiar instruments of the divine intention . The memory has as many moods as the temper , and shifts its scenery like a diorama . At this moment Mr. Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of far - off evenings when he was a very young man and used to go out preaching beyond Highbury . And he would willingly have had that service of exhortation in prospect now . The texts were there still , and so was his own facility in expounding them . His brief reverie was interrupted by the return of Caleb Garth , who also was on horseback , and was just shaking his bridle before starting , when he exclaimed — "
230756	230847	230742	230742	He	4658	" Mr. Bulstrode turned his horse and looked along the lane , but made no reply . The comer was our slight acquaintance Mr. Raffles , whose appearance presented no other change than such as was due to a suit of black and a crape hat - band . He was within three yards of the horseman now , and they could see the flash of recognition in his face as he whirled his stick upward , looking all the while at Mr. Bulstrode , and at last exclaiming : — "
230902	230957	230958	230958	I	0	" To say that Mr. Raffles ' manner was rather excited would be only one mode of saying that it was evening . Caleb Garth could see that there was a moment of struggle and hesitation in Mr. Bulstrode , but it ended in his putting out his hand coldly to Raffles and saying — "
230972	230973	230958	230958	I	0	" "
230984	230995	230996	230996	I	0	" said Raffles , adjusting himself in a swaggering attitude . "
231091	231247	231248	231248	I	0	" Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his pocket . Almost any other man than Caleb Garth might have been tempted to linger on the spot for the sake of hearing all he could about a man whose acquaintance with Bulstrode seemed to imply passages in the banker 's life so unlike anything that was known of him in Middlemarch that they must have the nature of a secret to pique curiosity . But Caleb was peculiar : certain human tendencies which are commonly strong were almost absent from his mind ; and one of these was curiosity about personal affairs . Especially if there was anything discreditable to be found out concerning another man , Caleb preferred not to know it ; and if he had to tell anybody under him that his evil doings were discovered , he was more embarrassed than the culprit . He now spurred his horse , and saying , "
231263	231270	231271	231271	You	0	" set off at a trot . "
231282	231286	231271	231271	You	0	" Raffles continued . "
231403	231538	231396	231396	I	0	" Mr. Bulstrode 's usual paleness had in fact taken an almost deathly hue . Five minutes before , the expanse of his life had been submerged in its evening sunshine which shone backward to its remembered morning : sin seemed to be a question of doctrine and inward penitence , humiliation an exercise of the closet , the bearing of his deeds a matter of private vision adjusted solely by spiritual relations and conceptions of the divine purposes . And now , as if by some hideous magic , this loud red figure had risen before him in unmanageable solidity — an incorporate past which had not entered into his imagination of chastisements . But Mr. Bulstrode 's thought was busy , and he was not a man to act or speak rashly . "
231544	231548	231396	231396	I	0	" he said , "
231569	231570	231572	231572	you	0	" "
231574	231582	231572	231572	you	0	" said Raffles , making a grimace . "
231601	231602	231599	231599	you	0	" "
231624	231642	231618	231618	I	0	" Raffles opened wide eyes , and gave a long whistle of surprise , before he said , "
231712	231723	231709	231710	old fellow	4664	" he continued , as they turned towards the house . "
231756	231787	231747	231747	you'd	0	" Mr. Raffles seemed greatly to enjoy his own wit , and swung his leg in a swaggering manner which was rather too much for his companion 's judicious patience . "
231793	231802	231747	231747	you'd	0	" Mr. Bulstrode observed , with chill anger , "
231865	231866	231867	231867	You	0	" "
231930	232068	231921	231921	Josh	528	" Mr. Bulstrode had not yet fully learned that even the desire for cognac was not stronger in Raffles than the desire to torment , and that a hint of annoyance always served him as a fresh cue . But it was at least clear that further objection was useless , and Mr. Bulstrode , in giving orders to the housekeeper for the accommodation of the guest , had a resolute air of quietude . There was the comfort of thinking that this housekeeper had been in the service of Rigg also , and might accept the idea that Mr. Bulstrode entertained Raffles merely as a friend of her former master . When there was food and drink spread before his visitor in the wainscoted parlor , and no witness in the room , Mr. Bulstrode said — "
232177	232178	232181	232181	my	0	" "
232184	232188	232181	232181	my	0	" said Raffles ; "
232265	232884	232886	232886	I	0	" Mr. Bulstrode , hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and sneering in Raffles ' manner was a good deal the effect of drink , had determined to wait till he was quite sober before he spent more words upon him . But he rode home with a terribly lucid vision of the difficulty there would be in arranging any result that could be permanently counted on with this man . It was inevitable that he should wish to get rid of John Raffles , though his reappearance could not be regarded as lying outside the divine plan . The spirit of evil might have sent him to threaten Mr. Bulstrode 's subversion as an instrument of good ; but the threat must have been permitted , and was a chastisement of a new kind . It was an hour of anguish for him very different from the hours in which his struggle had been securely private , and which had ended with a sense that his secret misdeeds were pardoned and his services accepted . Those misdeeds even when committed — had they not been half sanctified by the singleness of his desire to devote himself and all he possessed to the furtherance of the divine scheme ? And was he after all to become a mere stone of stumbling and a rock of offence ? For who would understand the work within him ? Who would not , when there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him , confound his whole life and the truths he had espoused , in one heap of obloquy ? In his closest meditations the life - long habit of Mr. Bulstrode 's mind clad his most egoistic terrors in doctrinal references to superhuman ends . But even while we are talking and meditating about the earth 's orbit and the solar system , what we feel and adjust our movements to is the stable earth and the changing day . And now within all the automatic succession of theoretic phrases — distinct and inmost as the shiver and the ache of oncoming fever when we are discussing abstract pain , was the forecast of disgrace in the presence of his neighbors and of his own wife . For the pain , as well as the public estimate of disgrace , depends on the amount of previous profession . To men who only aim at escaping felony , nothing short of the prisoner 's dock is disgrace . But Mr. Bulstrode had aimed at being an eminent Christian . It was not more than half - past seven in the morning when he again reached Stone Court . The fine old place never looked more like a delightful home than at that moment ; the great white lilies were in flower , the nasturtiums , their pretty leaves all silvered with dew , were running away over the low stone wall ; the very noises all around had a heart of peace within them . But everything was spoiled for the owner as he walked on the gravel in front and awaited the descent of Mr. Raffles , with whom he was condemned to breakfast . It was not long before they were seated together in the wainscoted parlor over their tea and toast , which was as much as Raffles cared to take at that early hour . The difference between his morning and evening self was not so great as his companion had imagined that it might be ; the delight in tormenting was perhaps even the stronger because his spirits were rather less highly pitched . Certainly his manners seemed more disagreeable by the morning light . "
232896	232918	232893	232894	Mr. Raffles	597	" said the banker , who could hardly do more than sip his tea and break his toast without eating it , "
232957	232958	232940	232940	I	0	" "
233079	233080	233082	233082	I	0	" "
233122	233123	233090	233090	I	0	" "
233173	233186	233171	233171	Nick	601	" Here Mr. Raffles winked slowly as he looked at Mr. Bulstrode . "
233203	233204	233199	233199	your	597	" "
233299	233300	233294	233294	I	0	" "
233318	233334	233309	233309	you	601	" said Mr. Bulstrode , perhaps with a little too much eagerness in his undertone . "
233344	233349	233350	233350	I	0	" said Raffles coolly . "
233423	233485	233413	233413	I	0	" Mr. Raffles had pushed away his chair and looked down at himself , particularly at his straps . His chief intention was to annoy Bulstrode , but he really thought that his appearance now would produce a good effect , and that he was not only handsome and witty , but clad in a mourning style which implied solid connections . "
233500	233510	233413	233413	I	0	" said Bulstrode , after a moment 's pause , "
233519	233520	233511	233511	you	601	" "
233527	233536	233511	233511	you	601	" said Raffles , with a mocking cordiality . "
233682	233769	233773	233773	he	0	" This time Mr. Raffles ' slow wink and slight protrusion of his tongue was worse than a nightmare , because it held the certitude that it was not a nightmare , but a waking misery . Mr. Bulstrode felt a shuddering nausea , and did not speak , but was considering diligently whether he should not leave Raffles to do as he would , and simply defy him as a slanderer . The man would soon show himself disreputable enough to make people disbelieve him . "
233783	233867	233773	233773	he	0	" said discerning consciousness . And again : it seemed no wrong to keep Raffles at a distance , but Mr. Bulstrode shrank from the direct falsehood of denying true statements . It was one thing to look back on forgiven sins , nay , to explain questionable conformity to lax customs , and another to enter deliberately on the necessity of falsehood . But since Bulstrode did not speak , Raffles ran on , by way of using time to the utmost . "
234077	234168	234066	234066	Nick	601	" Mr. Raffles ended with a jocose snuffle : no man felt his intellect more superior to religious ca nt . And if the cunning which calculates on the meanest feelings in men could be called intellect , he had his share , for under the blurting rallying tone with which he spoke to Bulstrode , there was an evident selection of statements , as if they had been so many moves at chess . Meanwhile Bulstrode had determined on his move , and he said , with gathered resolution — "
234274	234275	234267	234267	I	0	" "
234280	234289	234267	234267	I	0	" said Raffles , with an affected explosion , "
234307	234308	234309	234309	Your	597	" "
234317	234325	234309	234309	Your	597	" said Bulstrode , with white heat ; "
234341	234342	234343	234343	You	4731	" "
234386	234423	234424	234424	I	0	" Here Raffles rose and stalked once or twice up and down the room , swinging his leg , and assuming an air of masterly meditation . At last he stopped opposite Bulstrode , and said , "
234505	234506	234499	234499	you	4731	" "
234514	234536	234509	234509	I	0	" said Bulstrode , feeling the immediate riddance too great a relief to be rejected on the ground of future uncertainties . "
234550	234551	234559	234559	you	4731	" "
234563	234567	234568	234568	I	0	" said Raffles . "
234587	234661	234662	234662	I	0	" Mr. Bulstrode 's sickly body , shattered by the agitations he had gone through since the last evening , made him feel abjectly in the power of this loud invulnerable man . At that moment he snatched at a temporary repose to be won on any terms . He was rising to do what Raffles suggested , when the latter said , lifting up his finger as if with a sudden recollection — "
234807	234808	234800	234800	she	4742	" "
234811	234828	234800	234800	she	4742	" said Mr. Bulstrode , with the usual steady look of his light - gray eyes ; "
234839	234889	234800	234800	she	4742	" As he walked out of the room , Raffles winked slowly at his back , and then turned towards the window to watch the banker riding away — virtually at his command . His lips first curled with a smile and then opened with a short triumphant laugh . "
234898	234941	234945	234945	L	680	" he presently said , half aloud , scratching his head , and wrinkling his brows horizontally . He had not really cared or thought about this point of forgetfulness until it occurred to him in his invention of annoyances for Bulstrode . "
234956	235092	235093	235093	Ladislaw	261	" he went on , with a sense that he was getting hold of the slippery name . But the hold was too slight , and he soon got tired of this mental chase ; for few men were more impatient of private occupation or more in need of making themselves continually heard than Mr. Raffles . He preferred using his time in pleasant conversation with the bailiff and the housekeeper , from whom he gathered as much as he wanted to know about Mr. Bulstrode 's position in Middlemarch . After all , however , there was a dull space of time which needed relieving with bread and cheese and ale , and when he was seated alone with these resources in the wainscoted parlor , he suddenly slapped his knee , and exclaimed , "
235095	235494	235093	235093	Ladislaw	261	" That action of memory which he had tried to set going , and had abandoned in despair , had suddenly completed itself without conscious effort — a common experience , agreeable as a completed sneeze , even if the name remembered is of no value . Raffles immediately took out his pocket - book , and wrote down the name , not because he expected to use it , but merely for the sake of not being at a loss if he ever did happen to want it . He was not going to tell Bulstrode : there was no actual good in telling , and to a mind like that of Mr. Raffles there is always probable good in a secret . He was satisfied with his present success , and by three o'clock that day he had taken up his portmanteau at the turnpike and mounted the coach , relieving Mr. Bulstrode 's eyes of an ugly black spot on the landscape at Stone Court , but not relieving him of the dread that the black spot might reappear and become inseparable even from the vision of his hearth . By that delightful morning when the hay - ricks at Stone Court were scenting the air quite impartially , as if Mr. Raffles had been a guest worthy of finest incense , Dorothea had again taken up her abode at Lowick Manor . After three months Freshitt had become rather oppressive : to sit like a model for Saint Catherine looking rapturously at Celia 's baby would not do for many hours in the day , and to remain in that momentous babe 's presence with persistent disregard was a course that could not have been tolerated in a childless sister . Dorothea would have been capable of carrying baby joyfully for a mile if there had been need , and of loving it the more tenderly for that labour ; but to an aunt who does not recognize her infant nephew as Bouddha , and has nothing to do for him but to admire , his behavior is apt to appear monotonous , and the interest of watching him exhaustible . This possibility was quite hidden from Celia , who felt that Dorothea 's childless widowhood fell in quite prettily with the birth of little Arthur ( baby was named after Mr. Brooke ) . "
235514	235521	235507	235507	her	184	" said Celia to her husband . "
235546	235555	235557	235558	Sir James	177	" Not if it had been like Casaubon , "
235585	235597	235599	235599	Celia	169	" No ! just imagine ! Really it was a mercy , "
235601	235646	235599	235599	Celia	169	" and I think it is very nice for Dodo to be a widow . She can be just as fond of our baby as if it were her own , and she can have as many notions of her own as she likes . "
235647	235658	235660	235663	the devout Sir James	177	" It is a pity she was not a queen , "
235665	235681	235683	235683	Celia	169	" But what should we have been then ? We must have been something else , "
235694	235703	235683	235683	Celia	169	" I like her better as she is . "
235742	235825	235723	235723	her	169	" What will you do at Lowick , Dodo ? You say yourself there is nothing to be done there : everybody is so clean and well off , it makes you quite melancholy . And here you have been so happy going all about Tipton with Mr. Garth into the worst backyards . And now uncle is abroad , you and Mr. Garth can have it all your own way ; and I am sure James does everything you tell him . "
235826	235844	235846	235846	Dorothea	218	" I shall often come here , and I shall see how baby grows all the better , "
235848	235857	235859	235859	Celia	169	" But you will never see him washed , "
235861	235873	235859	235859	Celia	169	" and that is quite the best part of the day . "
235899	235913	235915	235915	Dorothea	218	" Dear Kitty , I will come and stay all night on purpose , "
235917	235956	235915	235915	Dorothea	218	" but I want to be alone now , and in my own home . I wish to know the Farebrothers better , and to talk to Mr. Farebrother about what there is to be done in Middlemarch . "
236146	236311	236140	236141	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" You will certainly go mad in that house alone , my dear . You will see visions . We have all got to exert ourselves a little to keep sane , and call things by the same names as other people call them by . To be sure , for younger sons and women who have no money , it is a sort of provision to go mad : they are taken care of then . But you must not run into that . I dare say you are a little bored here with our good dowager ; but think what a bore you might become yourself to your fellow - creatures if you were always playing tragedy queen and taking things sublimely . Sitting alone in that library at Lowick you may fancy yourself ruling the weather ; you must get a few people round you who would n't believe you if you told them . That is a good lowering medicine . "
236312	236329	236331	236331	Dorothea	218	" I never called everything by the same name that all the people about me did , "
236335	236349	236351	236352	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" But I suppose you have found out your mistake , my dear , "
236354	236363	236351	236352	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" and that is a proof of sanity . "
236378	236381	236382	236382	she	180	" No , "
236385	236429	236382	236382	she	180	" I still think that the greater part of the world is mistaken about many things . Surely one may be sane and yet think so , since the greater part of the world has often had to come round from its opinion . "
236448	236541	236445	236445	she	180	" It will be well for her to marry again as soon as it is proper , if one could get her among the right people . Of course the Chettams would not wish it . But I see clearly a husband is the best thing to keep her in order . If we were not so poor I would invite Lord Triton . He will be marquis some day , and there is no denying that she would make a good marchioness : she looks handsomer than ever in her mourning . "
236542	236561	236563	236565	the easy Rector	4761	" My dear Elinor , do let the poor woman alone . Such contrivances are of no use , "
236567	236650	236563	236565	the easy Rector	4761	" No use ? How are matches made , except by bringing men and women together ? And it is a shame that her uncle should have run away and shut up the Grange just now . There ought to be plenty of eligible matches invited to Freshitt and the Grange . Lord Triton is precisely the man : full of plans for making the people happy in a soft - headed sort of way . That would just suit Mrs. Casaubon . "
236651	236661	236445	236445	she	180	" Let Mrs. Casaubon choose for herself , Elinor . "
236662	236725	236563	236565	the easy Rector	4761	" That is the nonsense you wise men talk ! How can she choose if she has no variety to choose from ? A woman 's choice usually means taking the only man she can get . Mark my words , Humphrey . If her friends do n't exert themselves , there will be a worse business than the Casaubon business yet . "
236726	236764	236445	236445	she	180	" For heaven 's sake do n't touch on that topic , Elinor ! It is a very sore point with Sir James . He would be deeply offended if you entered on it to him unnecessarily . "
236765	236773	236775	236776	Mrs Cadwallader	180	" I have never entered on it , "
236782	236800	236775	236776	Mrs Cadwallader	180	" Celia told me all about the will at the beginning , without any asking of mine . "
236801	236828	236829	236830	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Yes , yes ; but they want the thing hushed up , and I understand that the young fellow is going out of the neighborhood . "
237079	237114	237068	237068	she	218	" I could not use it . Do you not see now that I could not submit my soul to yours , by working hopelessly at what I have no belief in — Dorothea ? "
237467	237489	237491	237491	Dorothea	218	" Probably some of Mr. Farebrother 's Middlemarch hearers may follow him to Lowick sometimes . Do you not think so ? "
237506	237517	237519	237521	the old lady	8041	" If they are wise they will , Mrs. Casaubon , "
237523	237613	237519	237521	the old lady	8041	" I see that you set a right value on my son 's preaching . His grandfather on my side was an excellent clergyman , but his father was in the law:—most exemplary and honest nevertheless , which is a reason for our never being rich . They say Fortune is a woman and capricious . But sometimes she is a good woman and gives to those who merit , which has been the case with you , Mrs. Casaubon , who have given a living to my son . "
237742	237747	237724	237724	she	218	" I do wish it "
238000	238006	238008	238008	Dorothea	189	" I will see him , "
238013	238024	238008	238008	Dorothea	189	" Let him be shown into the drawing - room . "
238159	238169	238171	238171	Pratt	555	" Glad to see you here again , sir , "
238179	238192	238194	238194	Will	261	" I am only come to say good - by , Pratt , "
238220	238229	238231	238231	Pratt	555	" Very sorry to hear it , sir , "
238278	238328	238275	238275	she	215	" Your master was as jealous as a fiend — and no reason . Madam would look higher than Mr. Ladislaw , else I do n't know her . Mrs. Cadwallader 's maid says there 's a lord coming who is to marry her when the mourning 's over . "
238551	238563	238565	238565	Will	261	" I hope I have not presumed too much in calling , "
238567	238590	238565	238565	Will	261	" I could not bear to leave the neighborhood and begin a new life without seeing you to say good - by . "
238591	238612	238614	238614	Dorothea	189	" Presumed ? Surely not . I should have thought it unkind if you had not wished to see me , "
238632	238639	238614	238614	Dorothea	189	" Are you going away immediately ? "
238640	238720	238565	238565	Will	261	" Very soon , I think . I intend to go to town and eat my dinners as a barrister , since , they say , that is the preparation for all public business . There will be a great deal of political work to be done by - and - by , and I mean to try and do some of it . Other men have managed to win an honourable position for themselves without family or money . "
238721	238732	238734	238734	Dorothea	189	" And that will make it all the more honourable , "
238738	238838	238734	238734	Dorothea	189	" Besides , you have so many talents . I have heard from my uncle how well you speak in public , so that every one is sorry when you leave off , and how clearly you can explain things . And you care that justice should be done to every one . I am so glad . When we were in Rome , I thought you only cared for poetry and art , and the things that adorn life for us who are well off . But now I know you think about the rest of the world . "
238872	238901	238903	238903	Will	261	" You approve of my going away for years , then , and never coming here again till I have made myself of some mark in the world ? "
239132	239177	239111	239111	she	4809	" Yes , it must be right for you to do as you say . I shall be very happy when I hear that you have made your value felt . But you must have patience . It will perhaps be a long while . "
239198	239201	239209	239209	He	261	" long while "
239241	239257	239231	239231	He	261	" I shall never hear from you . And you will forget all about me . "
239258	239261	239263	239263	Dorothea	189	" No , "
239265	239315	239316	239316	She	4809	" I shall never forget you . I have never forgotten any one whom I once knew . My life has never been crowded , and seems not likely to be so . And I have a great deal of space for memory at Lowick , have n't I ? "
239319	239323	239316	239316	She	4809	" Good God ! "
239579	239631	239570	239570	he	261	" I wonder whether you would like to have that miniature which hangs up - stairs — I mean that beautiful miniature of your grandmother . I think it is not right for me to keep it , if you would wish to have it . It is wonderfully like you . "
239632	239638	239640	239640	Will	261	" You are very good , "
239644	239678	239640	239640	Will	261	" No ; I do n't mind about it . It is not very consoling to have one 's own likeness . It would be more consoling if others wanted to have it . "
239679	239693	239694	239694	Dorothea	189	" I thought you would like to cherish her memory — I thought — "
239710	239723	239640	239640	Will	261	history—"you would surely like to have the miniature as a family memorial . "
239724	239754	239755	239755	Will	261	" Why should I have that , when I have nothing else ! A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage must keep his memorials in his head . "
239811	239828	239797	239797	She	4815	" You are much the happier of us two , Mr. Ladislaw , to have nothing . "
239926	239939	239940	239940	he	261	" I never felt it a misfortune to have nothing till now , "
239943	239964	239940	239940	he	261	" But poverty may be as bad as leprosy , if it divides us from what we most care for . "
239987	240068	240069	240069	she	4815	" Sorrow comes in so many ways . Two years ago I had no notion of that — I mean of the unexpected way in which trouble comes , and ties our hands , and makes us silent when we long to speak . I used to despise women a little for not shaping their lives more , and doing better things . I was very fond of doing as I liked , but I have almost given it up , "
240075	240094	240096	240096	Will	261	" I have not given up doing as I like , but I can very seldom do it , "
240138	240155	240098	240098	He	261	" The thing one most longs for may be surrounded with conditions that would be intolerable . "
240164	240175	240159	240159	Pratt	555	" Sir James Chettam is in the library , madam . "
240176	240185	240187	240187	Dorothea	189	" Ask Sir James to come in here , "
240257	240275	240276	240276	Dorothea	189	" I must say good - by , Mrs. Casaubon ; and probably for a long while . "
240342	240347	240328	240328	she	4815	" How is Celia ? "
240446	240448	240434	240434	he	177	" That Ladislaw!"—though
241201	241222	241193	241193	she	4836	" Dear Dodo , do throw off that cap . I am sure your dress must make you feel ill . "
241223	241240	241242	241242	Dorothea	189	" I am so used to the cap — it has become a sort of shell , "
241246	241258	241242	241242	Dorothea	189	" I feel rather bare and exposed when it is off . "
241259	241273	241275	241275	Celia	169	" I must see you without it ; it makes us all warm , "
241351	241354	241341	241341	He	177	" Ah ! "
241361	241371	241373	241373	Celia	169	" It was I who did it , James , "
241375	241399	241341	241341	He	177	" Dodo need not make such a slavery of her mourning ; she need not wear that cap any more among her friends . "
241400	241405	241407	241408	Lady Chettam	239	" My dear Celia , "
241410	241422	241407	241408	Lady Chettam	239	" a widow must wear her mourning at least a year . "
241423	241435	241437	241438	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Not if she marries again before the end of it , "
241468	241477	241479	241480	Lady Chettam	239	" That is very rare , I hope , "
241492	241560	241479	241480	Lady Chettam	239	" No friend of ours ever committed herself in that way except Mrs. Beevor , and it was very painful to Lord Grinsell when she did so . Her first husband was objectionable , which made it the greater wonder . And severely she was punished for it . They said Captain Beevor dragged her about by the hair , and held up loaded pistols at her . "
241561	241571	241573	241574	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Oh , if she took the wrong man ! "
241584	241623	241573	241574	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Marriage is always bad then , first or second . Priority is a poor recommendation in a husband if he has got no other . I would rather have a good second husband than an indifferent first . "
241624	241636	241638	241639	Lady Chettam	239	" My dear , your clever tongue runs away with you , "
241641	241664	241638	241639	Lady Chettam	239	" I am sure you would be the last woman to marry again prematurely , if our dear Rector were taken away . "
241665	241745	241573	241574	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Oh , I make no vows ; it might be a necessary economy . It is lawful to marry again , I suppose ; else we might as well be Hindoos instead of Christians . Of course if a woman accepts the wrong man , she must take the consequences , and one who does it twice over deserves her fate . But if she can marry blood , beauty , and bravery — the sooner the better . "
241746	241760	241762	241763	Sir James	177	" I think the subject of our conversation is very ill - chosen , "
241771	241777	241762	241763	Sir James	177	" Suppose we change it . "
241778	241787	241789	241789	Dorothea	189	" Not on my account , Sir James , "
241808	241884	241789	241789	Dorothea	189	" If you are speaking on my behalf , I can assure you that no question can be more indifferent and impersonal to me than second marriage . It is no more to me than if you talked of women going fox - hunting : whether it is admirable in them or not , I shall not follow them . Pray let Mrs. Cadwallader amuse herself on that subject as much as on any other . "
241885	241891	241893	241894	Lady Chettam	239	" My dear Mrs. Casaubon , "
241901	241959	241897	241897	her	239	" you do not , I hope , think there was any allusion to you in my mentioning Mrs. Beevor . It was only an instance that occurred to me . She was step - daughter to Lord Grinsell : he married Mrs. Teveroy for his second wife . There could be no possible allusion to you . "
241960	241964	241966	241966	Celia	169	" Oh no , "
241968	242006	241966	241966	Celia	169	" Nobody chose the subject ; it all came out of Dodo 's cap . Mrs. Cadwallader only said what was quite true . A woman could not be married in a widow 's cap , James . "
242007	242013	242015	242016	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Hush , my dear ! "
242018	242067	242015	242016	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" I will not offend again . I will not even refer to Dido or Zenobia . Only what are we to talk about ? I , for my part , object to the discussion of Human Nature , because that is the nature of rectors ' wives . "
242085	242142	242079	242079	Celia	169	" Really , Dodo , taking your cap off made you like yourself again in more ways than one . You spoke up just as you used to do , when anything was said to displease you . But I could hardly make out whether it was James that you thought wrong , or Mrs. Cadwallader . "
242143	242146	242148	242148	Dorothea	189	" Neither , "
242150	242199	242148	242148	Dorothea	189	" James spoke out of delicacy to me , but he was mistaken in supposing that I minded what Mrs. Cadwallader said . I should only mind if there were a law obliging me to take any piece of blood and beauty that she or anybody else recommended . "
242200	242225	242227	242227	Celia	169	" But you know , Dodo , if you ever did marry , it would be all the better to have blood and beauty , "
242254	242277	242279	242279	Dorothea	189	" Do n't be anxious , Kitty ; I have quite other thoughts about my life . I shall never marry again , "
242313	242318	242320	242320	Celia	169	" Really — quite ? "
242322	242335	242320	242320	Celia	169	" Not anybody at all — if he were very wonderful indeed ? "
242342	242423	242336	242336	Dorothea	189	" Not anybody at all . I have delightful plans . I should like to take a great deal of land , and drain it , and make a little colony , where everybody should work , and all the work should be done well . I should know every one of the people and be their friend . I am going to have great consultations with Mr. Garth : he can tell me almost everything I want to know . "
242424	242439	242441	242441	Celia	169	" Then you will be happy , if you have a plan , Dodo ? "
242443	242462	242441	242441	Celia	169	" Perhaps little Arthur will like plans when he grows up , and then he can help you . "
242488	242494	242441	242441	Celia	169	" all sorts of plans , "
242570	242573	242558	242565	a woman of one - and - twenty	4864	" the world "

242717	242721	242723	242723	Caleb	441	" Most uncommon ! "
242725	242816	242723	242723	Caleb	441	" She said a thing I often used to think myself when I was a lad:—'Mr . Garth , I should like to feel , if I lived to be old , that I had improved a great piece of land and built a great many good cottages , because the work is of a healthy kind while it is being done , and after it is done , men are the better for it . ' Those were the very words : she sees into things in that way . "
242817	242824	242826	242827	Mrs. Garth	443	" But womanly , I hope , "
242843	242851	242853	242853	Caleb	441	" Oh , you ca n't think ! "
242859	242922	242853	242853	Caleb	441	" You would like to hear her speak , Susan . She speaks in such plain words , and a voice like music . Bless me ! it reminds me of bits in the ' Messiah'—'and straightway there appeared a multitude of the heavenly host , praising God and saying ; ' it has a tone with it that satisfies your ear . "
243032	243036	243029	243029	he	442	" Business breeds . "

243363	243374	243376	243377	Mrs. Waule	304	" The cows will all cast their calves , brother , "
243386	243460	243376	243377	Mrs. Waule	304	" if the railway comes across the Near Close ; and I should n't wonder at the mare too , if she was in foal . It 's a poor tale if a widow 's property is to be spaded away , and the law say nothing to it . What 's to hinder 'em from cutting right and left if they begin ? It 's well known , I ca n't fight . "
243461	243493	243495	243495	Solomon	521	" The best way would be to say nothing , and set somebody on to send 'em away with a flea in their ear , when they came spying and measuring , "
243497	243568	243495	243495	Solomon	521	" Folks did that about Brassing , by what I can understand . It 's all a pretence , if the truth was known , about their being forced to take one way . Let 'em go cutting in another parish . And I do n't believe in any pay to make amends for bringing a lot of ruffians to trample your crops . Where 's a company 's pocket ? "
243569	243584	243586	243587	Mrs. Waule	304	" Brother Peter , God forgive him , got money out of a company , "
243589	243611	243586	243587	Mrs. Waule	304	" But that was for the manganese . That was n't for railways to blow you to pieces right and left . "
243612	243624	243495	243495	Solomon	521	" Well , there 's this to be said , Jane , "

Now , my lads , you ca n't hinder the railroad : it will be made whether you like it or not . And if you go fighting against it , you 'll get yourselves into trouble . The law gives those men leave to come here on the land . The owner has nothing to say against it , and if you meddle with them you 'll have to do with the constable and Justice Blakesley , and with the handcuffs and Middlemarch jail .

247497	247508	247510	247511	Mr. Garth	442	" My business is of many sorts , my boy , "
247515	247555	247510	247511	Mr. Garth	442	" A good deal of what I know can only come from experience : you ca n't learn it off as you learn things out of a book . But you are young enough to lay a foundation yet . "
247588	247606	247608	247608	Fred	282	" You do think I could do some good at it , if I were to try ? "
247613	247617	247619	247619	Caleb	441	" That depends , "

And the other is , you must not be ashamed of your work , and think it would be more honourable to you to be doing something else . You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it well , and not be always saying , There 's this and there 's that — if I had this or that to do , I might make something of it . No matter what a man is — I would n't give twopence for him"—here
247780	247804	247777	247777	he	441	fingers—"whether he was the prime minister or the rick - thatcher , if he did n't do well what he undertook to do . "
247805	247820	247822	247822	Fred	282	" I can never feel that I should do that in being a clergyman , "
247832	247841	247843	247843	Caleb	441	" Then let it alone , my boy , "
247847	247869	247843	247843	Caleb	441	" else you 'll never be easy . Or , if you are easy , you 'll be a poor stick . "
247870	247881	247883	247883	Fred	282	" That is very nearly what Mary thinks about it , "
247887	247934	247883	247883	Fred	282	" I think you must know what I feel for Mary , Mr. Garth : I hope it does not displease you that I have always loved her better than any one else , and that I shall never love any one as I love her . "
247961	247982	247949	247949	he	282	" That makes things more serious , Fred , if you want to take Mary 's happiness into your keeping . "
247983	247991	247993	247993	Fred	282	" I know that , Mr. Garth , "
247997	248145	247993	247993	Fred	282	" and I would do anything for her . She says she will never have me if I go into the Church ; and I shall be the most miserable devil in the world if I lose all hope of Mary . Really , if I could get some other profession , business — anything that I am at all fit for , I would work hard , I would deserve your good opinion . I should like to have to do with outdoor things . I know a good deal about land and cattle already . I used to believe , you know — though you will think me rather foolish for it — that I should have land of my own . I am sure knowledge of that sort would come easily to me , especially if I could be under you in any way . "
248146	248152	248154	248154	Caleb	441	" Softly , my boy , "
248160	248162	247993	247993	Fred	282	" Susan "
248167	248179	247993	247993	Fred	282	" What have you said to your father about all this ? "
248180	248261	247993	247993	Fred	282	" Nothing , yet ; but I must tell him . I am only waiting to know what I can do instead of entering the Church . I am very sorry to disappoint him , but a man ought to be allowed to judge for himself when he is four - and - twenty . How could I know when I was fifteen , what it would be right for me to do now ? My education was a mistake . "
248262	248270	248272	248272	Caleb	441	" But hearken to this , Fred , "
248274	248290	248272	248272	Caleb	441	" Are you sure Mary is fond of you , or would ever have you ? "
248291	248316	248318	248318	Fred	282	" I asked Mr. Farebrother to talk to her , because she had forbidden me — I did n't know what else to do , "
248322	248426	248318	248318	Fred	282	" And he says that I have every reason to hope , if I can put myself in an honourable position — I mean , out of the Church . I dare say you think it unwarrantable in me , Mr. Garth , to be troubling you and obtruding my own wishes about Mary , before I have done anything at all for myself . Of course I have not the least claim — indeed , I have already a debt to you which will never be discharged , even when I have been able to pay it in the shape of money . "
248427	248438	248440	248440	Caleb	441	" Yes , my boy , you have a claim , "
248449	248525	248440	248440	Caleb	441	" The young ones have always a claim on the old to help them forward . I was young myself once and had to do without much help ; but help would have been welcome to me , if it had been only for the fellow - feeling 's sake . But I must consider . Come to me to - morrow at the office , at nine o'clock . At the office , mind . "
248617	248622	248612	248612	he	442	" Let us go , "
248729	248740	248742	248742	Caleb	441	" It is come round as I thought , Susan , "
248778	248794	248753	248753	He	441	" The children are fond of each other — I mean , Fred and Mary . "
248814	248882	248806	248806	her	443	" After we 'd done our work , Fred poured it all out to me . He ca n't bear to be a clergyman , and Mary says she wo n't have him if he is one ; and the lad would like to be under me and give his mind to business . And I 've determined to take him and make a man of him . "
248883	248886	248888	248889	Mrs. Garth	443	" Caleb ! "
248901	248910	248912	248913	Mr. Garth	442	" It 's a fine thing to do , "
248930	248974	248912	248913	Mr. Garth	442	" I shall have trouble with him , but I think I shall carry it through . The lad loves Mary , and a true love for a good woman is a great thing , Susan . It shapes many a rough fellow . "
248975	248985	248987	248988	Mrs Garth	443	" Has Mary spoken to you on the subject ? "
249004	249118	248912	248913	Mr. Garth	442	" Not a word . I asked her about Fred once ; I gave her a bit of a warning . But she assured me she would never marry an idle self - indulgent man — nothing since . But it seems Fred set on Mr. Farebrother to talk to her , because she had forbidden him to speak himself , and Mr. Farebrother has found out that she is fond of Fred , but says he must not be a clergyman . Fred 's heart is fixed on Mary , that I can see : it gives me a good opinion of the lad — and we always liked him , Susan . "
249119	249130	249132	249133	Mrs. Garth	443	" It is a pity for Mary , I think , "
249135	249141	249132	249133	Mrs. Garth	443	" Why — a pity ? "
249142	249161	248912	248913	Mr. Garth	442	" Because , Caleb , she might have had a man who is worth twenty Fred Vincy 's . "
249162	249165	249167	249167	Caleb	441	" Ah ? "
249172	249215	249167	249167	Caleb	441	" I firmly believe that Mr. Farebrother is attached to her , and meant to make her an offer ; but of course , now that Fred has used him as an envoy , there is an end to that better prospect . "
249278	249329	249275	249275	he	441	" That would have made me very proud and happy , Susan , and I should have been glad for your sake . I 've always felt that your belongings have never been on a level with you . But you took me , though I was a plain man . "
249330	249343	249345	249346	Mrs. Garth	443	" I took the best and cleverest man I had ever known , "
249364	249479	249350	249350	she	443	" Well , perhaps others thought you might have done better . But it would have been worse for me . And that is what touches me close about Fred . The lad is good at bottom , and clever enough to do , if he 's put in the right way ; and he loves and honours my daughter beyond anything , and she has given him a sort of promise according to what he turns out . I say , that young man 's soul is in my hand ; and I 'll do the best I can for him , so help me God ! It 's my duty , Susan . "
249531	249552	249523	249523	She	443	" Few men besides you would think it a duty to add to their anxieties in that way , Caleb . "
249553	249605	249523	249523	She	443	" That signifies nothing — what other men would think . I 've got a clear feeling inside me , and that I shall follow ; and I hope your heart will go with me , Susan , in making everything as light as can be to Mary , poor child . "
249630	249644	249622	249622	She	443	" God bless you , Caleb ! Our children have a good father . "
249730	249734	249736	249736	Caleb	441	" Now Fred , "
249738	249805	249736	249736	Caleb	441	" you will have some desk - work . I have always done a good deal of writing myself , but I ca n't do without help , and as I want you to understand the accounts and get the values into your head , I mean to do without another clerk . So you must buckle to . How are you at writing and arithmetic ? "
249838	249863	249871	249871	Caleb	441	" I 'm not afraid of arithmetic , Mr. Garth : it always came easily to me . I think you know my writing . "
249864	249869	249871	249871	Caleb	441	" Let us see , "
249897	249915	249871	249871	Caleb	441	" Copy me a line or two of that valuation , with the figures at the end . "
250067	250071	250072	250072	he	441	" The deuce ! "
250077	250103	250072	250072	he	441	" To think that this is a country where a man 's education may cost hundreds and hundreds , and it turns you out this ! "
250122	250140	250113	250113	his	441	" The Lord have mercy on us , Fred , I ca n't put up with this ! "
250141	250150	250152	250152	Fred	282	" What can I do , Mr. Garth ? "
250185	250216	250218	250218	Caleb	441	" Do ? Why , you must learn to form your letters and keep the line . What 's the use of writing at all if nobody can understand it ? "
250232	250290	250218	250218	Caleb	441	" Is there so little business in the world that you must be sending puzzles over the country ? But that 's the way people are brought up . I should lose no end of time with the letters some people send me , if Susan did not make them out for me . It 's disgusting . "
250461	250467	250473	250473	he	442	" I am very sorry , "
250484	250495	250496	250496	he	442	" We must make the best of it , Fred , "
250508	250572	250574	250574	Caleb	441	" Every man can learn to write . I taught myself . Go at it with a will , and sit up at night if the day - time is n't enough . We 'll be patient , my boy . Callum shall go on with the books for a bit , while you are learning . But now I must be off , "
250578	250622	250574	250574	Caleb	441	" You must let your father know our agreement . You 'll save me Callum 's salary , you know , when you can write ; and I can afford to give you eighty pounds for the first year , and more after . "
250881	250894	250871	250871	he	282	" So you 've made up your mind at last , sir ? "
250895	250900	250871	250871	he	282	" Yes , father . "
250901	250945	250871	250871	he	282	" Very well ; stick to it . I 've no more to say . You 've thrown away your education , and gone down a step in life , when I had given you the means of rising , that 's all . "
250946	250998	250871	250871	he	282	" I am very sorry that we differ , father . I think I can be quite as much of a gentleman at the work I have undertaken , as if I had been a curate . But I am grateful to you for wishing to do the best for me . "
250999	251043	250871	250871	he	282	" Very well ; I have no more to say . I wash my hands of you . I only hope , when you have a son of your own he will make a better return for the pains you spend on him . "
251133	251148	251149	251149	he	7545	" I hope you will not object to my remaining at home , sir ? "
251157	251179	251149	251149	he	7545	" I shall have a sufficient salary to pay for my board , as of course I should wish to do . "
251180	251185	251187	251188	Mr. Vincy	282	" Board be hanged ! "
251209	251261	251191	251191	himself	282	" Of course your mother will want you to stay . But I shall keep no horse for you , you understand ; and you will pay your own tailor . You will do with a suit or two less , I fancy , when you have to pay for 'em . "
251278	251300	251301	251302	Mr. Vincy	282	" I hope you will shake hands with me , father , and forgive me the vexation I have caused you . "
251331	251342	251325	251325	his	282	" Yes , yes , let us say no more . "
251412	251421	251448	251448	Garth	301	" beyond anybody else 's son in Middlemarch , "
251476	251479	251483	251483	he	282	" fly out "
251608	251639	251602	251603	Mr. Vincy	282	" Come , Lucy , my dear , do n't be so down - hearted . You always have spoiled the boy , and you must go on spoiling him . "
251640	251651	251653	251654	the wife	1365	" Nothing ever did cut me so before , Vincy , "
251666	251671	251653	251654	the wife	1365	" only his illness . "
251672	251704	251602	251603	Mr. Vincy	282	" Pooh , pooh , never mind ! We must expect to have trouble with our children . Do n't make it worse by letting me see you out of spirits . "
251705	251712	251714	251715	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Well , I wo n't , "
251739	251752	251754	251755	Mr. Vincy	282	" It wo n't do to begin making a fuss about one , "
251767	251776	251754	251755	Mr. Vincy	282	" There 's Rosamond as well as Fred . "
251777	251803	251602	251603	Mr. Vincy	282	" Yes , poor thing . I 'm sure I felt for her being disappointed of her baby ; but she got over it nicely . "
251804	251908	251754	251755	Mr. Vincy	282	" Baby , pooh ! I can see Lydgate is making a mess of his practice , and getting into debt too , by what I hear . I shall have Rosamond coming to me with a pretty tale one of these days . But they 'll get no money from me , I know . Let his family help him . I never did like that marriage . But it 's no use talking . Ring the bell for lemons , and do n't look dull any more , Lucy . I 'll drive you and Louisa to Riverston to - morrow . "
252199	252202	252204	252204	Jim	177	" Ivanhoe , "
252410	252414	252381	252381	Ben	455	" Take me ! "
252415	252422	252424	252424	Letty	457	" Oh , and me too , "
252426	252437	252439	252439	Ben	455	" You ca n't keep up with Fred and me , "
252441	252457	252459	252459	Letty	457	" Yes , I can . Mother , please say that I am to go , "
252475	252482	252484	252484	Jim	177	" I shall stay with Christy , "
252521	252530	252532	252532	Christy	216	" Let us all go and see Mary , "
252538	252600	252532	252532	Christy	216	" No , my dear child , we must not go in a swarm to the parsonage . And that old Glasgow suit of yours would never do . Besides , your father will come home . We must let Fred go alone . He can tell Mary that you are here , and she will come back to - morrow . "
252650	252656	252658	252659	Mrs. Garth	443	" Children , run away , "
252661	252681	252658	252659	Mrs. Garth	443	" it is too warm to hang about your friends . Take your brother and show him the rabbits . "
252720	252731	252713	252713	he	282	" How glad you must be to have Christy here ! "
252732	252810	252696	252697	Mrs. Garth	443	" Yes ; he has come sooner than I expected . He got down from the coach at nine o'clock , just after his father went out . I am longing for Caleb to come and hear what wonderful progress Christy is making . He has paid his expenses for the last year by giving lessons , carrying on hard study at the same time . He hopes soon to get a private tutorship and go abroad . "
252811	252818	252820	252820	Fred	282	" He is a great fellow , "
252832	252839	252845	252845	he	282	" and no trouble to anybody . "
252848	252870	252845	252845	he	282	" But I fear you will think that I am going to be a great deal of trouble to Mr. Garth . "
252871	252899	252901	252902	Mrs. Garth	443	" Caleb likes taking trouble : he is one of those men who always do more than any one would have thought of asking them to do , "
252959	252976	252978	252978	Fred	282	" I know you think me very undeserving , Mrs. Garth , and with good reason , "
252997	253046	252978	252978	Fred	282	" I happen to have behaved just the worst to the people I ca n't help wishing for the most from . But while two men like Mr. Garth and Mr. Farebrother have not given me up , I do n't see why I should give myself up . "
253062	253065	253067	253067	she	443	" Assuredly , "
253073	253100	253067	253067	she	443	" A young man for whom two such elders had devoted themselves would indeed be culpable if he threw himself away and made their sacrifices vain . "
253114	253158	253159	253159	Fred	282	" I hope it will not be so with me , Mrs. Garth , since I have some encouragement to believe that I may win Mary . Mr. Garth has told you about that ? You were not surprised , I dare say ? "
253174	253184	253186	253187	Mrs. Garth	443	" Not surprised that Mary has given you encouragement ? "
253222	253231	253186	253187	Mrs. Garth	443	" Yes , I confess I was surprised . "
253232	253254	253256	253256	Fred	282	" She never did give me any — not the least in the world , when I talked to her myself , "
253263	253286	253256	253256	Fred	282	" But when I asked Mr. Farebrother to speak for me , she allowed him to tell me there was a hope . "
253396	253414	253389	253389	She	443	" You made a great mistake , Fred , in asking Mr. Farebrother to speak for you . "
253415	253419	253421	253421	Fred	282	" Did I ? "
253449	253482	253437	253438	Mrs. Garth	443	" Mr. Farebrother has always been such a friend of ours ; and Mary , I knew , would listen to him gravely ; and he took it on himself quite readily . "
253483	253508	253510	253511	Mrs. Garth	443	" Yes , young people are usually blind to everything but their own wishes , and seldom imagine how much those wishes cost others , "
253547	253562	253564	253564	Fred	282	" I can not conceive how it could be any pain to Mr. Farebrother , "
253578	253586	253588	253589	Mrs. Garth	443	" Precisely ; you can not conceive , "
253623	253642	253602	253602	Fred	282	" Do you mean to say , Mrs. Garth , that Mr. Farebrother is in love with Mary ? "
253643	253665	253667	253668	Mrs. Garth	443	" And if it were so , Fred , I think you are the last person who ought to be surprised , "
253736	253753	253754	253754	he	282	" Then you think I am standing in his way , and in Mary 's too ? "
253832	253854	253828	253828	he	282	" Mr. Garth seemed pleased that Mary should be attached to me . He could not have known anything of this . "
253892	253911	253883	253883	She	443	" I spoke from inference only . I am not aware that Mary knows anything of the matter . "
254078	254087	254088	254089	Mrs. Garth	443	" This is the house that Jack built . "
254135	254139	254141	254141	she	443	" God bless you "
254161	254167	254152	254152	she	443	" one of the foolish women speaketh"—telling
254693	254699	254689	254689	She	301	" I am so glad , "
254728	254782	254721	254722	Mrs. Farebrother	392	" You do n't mean , my dear Miss Garth , that you are glad to hear of a young man giving up the Church for which he was educated : you only mean that things being so , you are glad that he should be under an excellent man like your father . "
254783	254800	254802	254802	Mary	301	" No , really , Mrs. Farebrother , I am glad of both , I fear , "
254812	254834	254721	254722	Mrs. Farebrother	392	" I have a dreadfully secular mind . I never liked any clergyman except the Vicar of Wakefield and Mr. Farebrother . "
254835	254842	254844	254845	Mrs. Farebrother	392	" Now why , my dear ? "
254860	254897	254844	254845	Mrs. Farebrother	392	" You have always a good reason for your opinions , but this astonishes me . Of course I put out of the question those who preach new doctrine . But why should you dislike clergymen ? "
254898	254902	254904	254904	Mary	301	" Oh dear , "
254919	254927	254912	254912	she	301	" I do n't like their neckcloths . "
254928	254940	254942	254943	Miss Winifred	394	" Why , you do n't like Camden 's , then , "
254949	254955	254957	254957	Mary	301	" Yes , I do , "
254959	254978	254957	254957	Mary	301	" I do n't like the other clergymen 's neckcloths , because it is they who wear them . "
254979	254984	254986	254987	Miss Noble	393	" How very puzzling ! "
254998	255022	255024	255025	Mrs. Farebrother	392	" My dear , you are joking . You would have better reasons than these for slighting so respectable a class of men , "
255029	255049	255051	255051	Fred	282	" Miss Garth has such severe notions of what people should be that it is difficult to satisfy her , "
255053	255072	255074	255076	the old lady	8041	" Well , I am glad at least that she makes an exception in favour of my son , "
255114	255119	255108	255108	he	335	" That is right ; "
255215	255258	255211	255212	Mr. Farebrother	335	" Fred , help me to carry these drawers back into my study — you have never seen my fine new study . Pray come too , Miss Garth . I want you to see a stupendous spider I found this morning . "
255367	255402	255363	255364	Mr. Farebrother	335	" Wait here a minute or two . I am going to look out an engraving which Fred is tall enough to hang for me . I shall be back in a few minutes . "
255420	255442	255448	255448	his	282	" It is of no use , whatever I do , Mary . You are sure to marry Farebrother at last . "
255451	255459	255460	255460	Mary	301	" What do you mean , Fred ? "
255477	255496	255460	255460	Mary	301	" It is impossible that you should not see it all clearly enough — you who see everything . "
255497	255536	255537	255537	Fred	282	" I only see that you are behaving very ill , Fred , in speaking so of Mr. Farebrother after he has pleaded your cause in every way . How can you have taken up such an idea ? "
255568	255577	255578	255578	he	282	" It follows as a matter of course , "
255581	255610	255563	255564	Mrs. Garth	443	" When you are continually seeing a man who beats me in everything , and whom you set up above everybody , I can have no fair chance . "
255611	255619	255621	255621	Mary	301	" You are very ungrateful , Fred , "
255623	255641	255621	255621	Mary	301	" I wish I had never told Mr. Farebrother that I cared for you in the least . "
255642	255709	255563	255564	Mrs. Garth	443	" No , I am not ungrateful ; I should be the happiest fellow in the world if it were not for this . I told your father everything , and he was very kind ; he treated me as if I were his son . I could go at the work with a will , writing and everything , if it were not for this . "
255710	255717	255719	255719	Mary	301	" For this ? for what ? "
255733	255746	255719	255719	Mary	301	" This dreadful certainty that I shall be bowled out by Farebrother . "
255756	255759	255760	255760	she	301	" Fred , "
255778	255820	255760	255760	she	301	" you are too delightfully ridiculous . If you were not such a charming simpleton , what a temptation this would be to play the wicked coquette , and let you suppose that somebody besides you has made love to me . "
255821	255831	255833	255833	Fred	282	" Do you really like me best , Mary ? "
255850	255862	255864	255864	Mary	301	" I do n't like you at all at this moment , "
255875	255903	255904	255904	she	301	" I only said that no mortal ever made love to me besides you . And that is no argument that a very wise man ever will , "
255909	255926	255928	255928	Fred	282	" I wish you would tell me that you could not possibly ever think of him , "
255930	255943	255945	255945	Mary	301	" Never dare to mention this any more to me , Fred , "
255951	255997	255945	255945	Mary	301	" I do n't know whether it is more stupid or ungenerous in you not to see that Mr. Farebrother has left us together on purpose that we might speak freely . I am disappointed that you should be so blind to his delicate feeling . "
256201	256215	256216	256216	Mary	301	" Fred has lost all his other expectations ; he must keep this , "
256456	256468	256483	256483	he	712	" parting his hair from brow to nape in a despicable fashion "
256795	256798	256799	256799	He	712	" style . "
256971	256986	256988	256988	Rosamond	283	" I wish you would talk more to the Captain at dinner , Tertius , "
257008	257035	256988	256988	Rosamond	283	" You really look so absent sometimes — you seem to be seeing through his head into something behind it , instead of looking at him . "
257036	257060	257062	257062	Lydgate	300	" My dear Rosy , you do n't expect me to talk much to such a conceited ass as that , I hope , "
257066	257085	257062	257062	Lydgate	300	" If he got his head broken , I might look at it with interest , not before . "
257086	257101	257103	257103	Rosamond	283	" I can not conceive why you should speak of your cousin so contemptuously , "
257127	257155	257112	257112	she	283	" Ask Ladislaw if he does n't think your Captain the greatest bore he ever met with . Ladislaw has almost forsaken the house since he came . "
257180	257192	257193	257193	she	283	" It is impossible to say what will suit eccentric persons , "
257196	257228	257193	257193	she	283	" but in my opinion Captain Lydgate is a thorough gentleman , and I think you ought not , out of respect to Sir Godwin , to treat him with neglect . "
257229	257259	257158	257158	she	283	" No , dear ; but we have had dinners for him . And he comes in and goes out as he likes . He does n't want me . "
257260	257328	257193	257193	she	283	" Still , when he is in the room , you might show him more attention . He may not be a phoenix of cleverness in your sense ; his profession is different ; but it would be all the better for you to talk a little on his subjects . I think his conversation is quite agreeable . And he is anything but an unprincipled man . "
257329	257348	257350	257350	Lydgate	712	" The fact is , you would wish me to be a little more like him , Rosy , "
257571	257574	257560	257561	Captain Lydgate	712	" style , "
257648	257652	257629	257630	Captain Lydgate	712	" Green Dragon , "
257804	257813	257814	257814	he	712	" However , you have come back safely , "
257825	257879	257814	257814	he	712	" You will not go again , Rosy ; that is understood . If it were the quietest , most familiar horse in the world , there would always be the chance of accident . And you know very well that I wished you to give up riding the roan on that account . "
257880	257892	257971	257971	Lydgate	300	" But there is the chance of accident indoors , Tertius . "
257893	257902	257904	257904	Lydgate	300	" My darling , do n't talk nonsense , "
257911	257937	257904	257904	Lydgate	300	" surely I am the person to judge for you . I think it is enough that I say you are not to go again . "
257996	258008	258010	258010	Rosamond	283	" I wish you would fasten up my plaits , dear , "
258129	258148	258149	258149	he	300	" I shall tell the Captain that he ought to have known better than offer you his horse , "
258157	258171	258173	258173	Rosamond	283	" I beg you will not do anything of the kind , Tertius , "
258188	258211	258173	258173	Rosamond	283	" It will be treating me as if I were a child . Promise that you will leave the subject to me . "
258226	258230	258223	258223	Lydgate	300	" Very well , "
258560	258564	258565	258565	he	712	" Poor , poor darling!"—but
259860	259863	259865	259865	Lydgate	712	" answered ; "
259868	259880	259865	259865	Lydgate	712	" if things were done at all , they must be done properly"—he
259910	259918	259865	259865	Lydgate	712	" it could hardly come to much , "
260758	260762	260731	260732	Mr. Dover	714	" Any other article "
261323	261330	261332	261332	Will	261	" How are you , Lydgate ? "
261354	261367	261369	261369	Rosamond	283	" Have you dined , Tertius ? I expected you much earlier , "
261381	261385	261386	261386	She	283	" horrible humor . "
261397	261410	261412	261412	Lydgate	712	" I have dined . I should like some tea , please , "
261437	261443	261444	261444	he	261	" I shall be off , "
261451	261456	261458	261458	Rosamond	283	" Tea is coming , "
261460	261466	261458	261458	Rosamond	283	" pray do n't go . "
261467	261474	261476	261476	Will	261	" Yes , Lydgate is bored , "
261503	261514	261516	261516	Rosamond	283	" There is the more need for you to stay , "
261526	261537	261516	261516	Rosamond	283	" he will not speak to me all the evening . "
261538	261546	261548	261548	Lydgate	712	" Yes , Rosamond , I shall , "
261555	261567	261548	261548	Lydgate	712	" I have some serious business to speak to you about . "
261593	261599	261601	261601	Will	261	" There ! you see , "
261603	261620	261622	261622	he	712	" I 'm going to the meeting about the Mechanics ' Institute . Good - by ; "
261777	261787	261773	261773	he	712	" Would she kill me because I wearied her ? "
261791	261800	261773	261773	he	712	" It is the way with all women . "
261927	261961	261924	261924	Dorothea	218	" Advise me — think what I can do — he has been all his life labouring and looking forward . He minds about nothing else — and I mind about nothing else . "
262037	262045	262032	262032	her	283	" Here is your tea , Tertius , "
262246	262261	262262	262262	he	712	" Dear Rosy , lay down your work and come to sit by me , "
262410	262413	262399	262399	He	712	" Dear ! "
262477	262520	262521	262521	Lydgate	300	" I am obliged to tell you what will hurt you , Rosy . But there are things which husband and wife must think of together . I dare say it has occurred to you already that I am short of money . "
262540	262655	262525	262525	Rosamond	283	" I was not able to pay for all the things we had to get before we were married , and there have been expenses since which I have been obliged to meet . The consequence is , there is a large debt at Brassing — three hundred and eighty pounds — which has been pressing on me a good while , and in fact we are getting deeper every day , for people do n't pay me the faster because others want the money . I took pains to keep it from you while you were not well ; but now we must think together about it , and you must help me . "
262656	262666	262668	262668	Rosamond	283	" What can — I — do , Tertius ? "
262733	262741	262781	262781	he	5244	" What can — I — do ! "
262801	262833	262781	262781	he	5244	" It is necessary for you to know , because I have to give security for a time , and a man must come to make an inventory of the furniture . "
262838	262847	262848	262848	she	283	" Have you not asked papa for money ? "
262858	262861	262848	262848	she	283	" No . "
262862	262869	262870	262870	she	283	" Then I must ask him ! "
262892	262897	262899	262899	Lydgate	300	" No , Rosy , "
262903	262958	262960	262960	Lydgate	300	" It is too late to do that . The inventory will be begun to - morrow . Remember it is a mere security : it will make no difference : it is a temporary affair . I insist upon it that your father shall not know , unless I choose to tell him , "
263149	263157	263159	263159	Lydgate	300	" Try not to grieve , darling , "
263196	263339	263343	263343	his	300	" We must brace ourselves to do what is necessary . It is I who have been in fault : I ought to have seen that I could not afford to live in this way . But many things have told against me in my practice , and it really just now has ebbed to a low point . I may recover it , but in the mean time we must pull up — we must change our way of living . We shall weather it . When I have given this security I shall have time to look about me ; and you are so clever that if you turn your mind to managing you will school me into carefulness . I have been a thoughtless rascal about squaring prices — but come , dear , sit down and forgive me . "
263409	263434	263406	263406	she	283	" Why can you not put off having the inventory made ? You can send the men away to - morrow when they come . "
263435	263443	263445	263445	Lydgate	300	" I shall not send them away , "
263460	263481	263406	263406	she	283	" If we left Middlemarch ? there would of course be a sale , and that would do as well . "
263482	263492	263406	263406	she	283	" But we are not going to leave Middlemarch . "
263493	263527	263406	263406	she	283	" I am sure , Tertius , it would be much better to do so . Why can we not go to London ? Or near Durham , where your family is known ? "
263528	263538	263406	263406	she	283	" We can go nowhere without money , Rosamond . "
263539	263576	263406	263406	she	283	" Your friends would not wish you to be without money . And surely these odious tradesmen might be made to understand that , and to wait , if you would make proper representations to them . "
263577	263583	263585	263585	Lydgate	300	" This is idle Rosamond , "
263589	263637	263585	263585	Lydgate	300	" You must learn to take my judgment on questions you do n't understand . I have made necessary arrangements , and they must be carried out . As to friends , I have no expectations whatever from them , and shall not ask them for anything . "
263666	263680	263682	263682	Lydgate	300	" We have no time to waste now on unnecessary words , dear , "
263690	263731	263682	263682	Lydgate	300	" There are some details that I want to consider with you . Dover says he will take a good deal of the plate back again , and any of the jewellery we like . He really behaves very well . "
263732	263743	263745	263745	Rosamond	283	" Are we to go without spoons and forks then ? "
263772	263778	263780	263780	Lydgate	300	" Oh no , dear ! "
263782	263787	263788	263788	he	300	" But look here , "
263801	263842	263788	263788	he	300	" here is Dover 's account . See , I have marked a number of articles , which if we returned them would reduce the amount by thirty pounds and more . I have not marked any of the jewellery . "
263910	263921	263923	263923	Rosamond	283	" It is useless for me to look , Tertius , "
263927	263935	263923	263923	Rosamond	283	" you will return what you please . "
264113	264163	264103	264103	she	283	" This is all the jewellery you ever gave me . You can return what you like of it , and of the plate also . You will not , of course , expect me to stay at home to - morrow . I shall go to papa 's . "
264199	264208	264209	264209	he	300	" And when shall you come back again ? "
264220	264238	264209	264209	he	300	" Oh , in the evening . Of course I shall not mention the subject to mamma . "
264292	264316	264279	264279	he	300	" Now we have been united , Rosy , you should not leave me to myself in the first trouble that has come . "
264317	264321	264323	264323	Rosamond	283	" Certainly not , "
264325	264336	264323	264323	Rosamond	283	" I shall do everything it becomes me to do . "
264337	264457	264289	264289	his	300	" It is not right that the thing should be left to servants , or that I should have to speak to them about it . And I shall be obliged to go out — I do n't know how early . I understand your shrinking from the humiliation of these money affairs . But , my dear Rosamond , as a question of pride , which I feel just as much as you can , it is surely better to manage the thing ourselves , and let the servants see as little of it as possible ; and since you are my wife , there is no hindering your share in my disgraces — if there were disgraces . "
264470	264480	264467	264467	she	283	" Very well , I will stay at home . "
264481	264521	264323	264323	Rosamond	283	" I shall not touch these jewels , Rosy . Take them away again . But I will write out a list of plate that we may return , and that can be packed up and sent at once . "
264522	264529	264531	264531	Rosamond	283	" The servants will know that , "
264540	264559	264561	264561	Lydgate	300	" Well , we must meet some disagreeables as necessities . Where is the ink , I wonder ? "
264621	264658	264609	264609	his	300	" Come , darling , let us make the best of things . It will only be for a time , I hope , that we shall have to be stingy and particular . Kiss me . "
265046	265053	265040	265040	he	261	" a propos of that young Ladislaw "
265265	265300	265262	265262	he	261	" Take care you do n't drop the faintest hint to Ladislaw , Rosy . He is likely to fly out as if you insulted him . Of course it is a painful affair . "
265342	265356	265358	265358	she	283	" I know all about it . I have a confidential little bird , "
265379	265389	265358	265358	she	283	" There is a powerful magnet in this neighborhood . "
265390	265404	265406	265406	Will	261	" To be sure there is . Nobody knows that better than you , "
265419	265509	265406	265406	Will	261	" It is really the most charming romance : Mr. Casaubon jealous , and foreseeing that there was no one else whom Mrs. Casaubon would so much like to marry , and no one who would so much like to marry her as a certain gentleman ; and then laying a plan to spoil all by making her forfeit her property if she did marry that gentleman — and then — and then — and then — oh , I have no doubt the end will be thoroughly romantic . "
265510	265519	265521	265521	Will	261	" Great God ! what do you mean ? "
265543	265554	265406	265406	Will	261	" Do n't joke ; tell me what you mean . "
265555	265562	265564	265564	Rosamond	283	" You do n't really know ? "
265585	265588	265589	265589	he	261	" No ! "
265594	265621	265589	265589	he	261	" Do n't know that Mr. Casaubon has left it in his will that if Mrs. Casaubon marries you she is to forfeit all her property ? "
265622	265632	265634	265634	Will	261	" How do you know that it is true ? "
265638	265648	265649	265649	Will	261	" My brother Fred heard it from the Farebrothers . "
265660	265672	265674	265674	Rosamond	283	" I dare say she likes you better than the property , "
265683	265693	265695	265695	Will	261	" Pray do n't say any more about it , "
265708	265720	265695	265695	Will	261	" It is a foul insult to her and to me . "
265735	265743	265745	265745	Rosamond	283	" Now you are angry with me , "
265747	265768	265745	265745	Rosamond	283	" It is too bad to bear me malice . You ought to be obliged to me for telling you . "
265769	265774	265776	265776	Will	261	" So I am , "
265795	265804	265806	265806	Rosamond	283	" I expect to hear of the marriage , "
265810	265821	265806	265806	Rosamond	283	" Never ! You will never hear of the marriage ! "
265938	265948	265951	265951	Rosamond	283	" There really is nothing to care for much , "
266004	266014	265997	265997	he	300	" I am more likely to want help myself . "
266406	266408	266413	266414	Mr. Thesiger	409	" everybody "
266511	266513	266533	266534	Mrs. Bulstrode	312	" Everybody "

266634	266655	266629	266632	the scrupulously polite banker	5297	" attendance at the sale would not interfere with the arrangements for your departure , which I know is imminent . "

267310	267313	267358	267360	Meanwhile Mrs. Larcher	468	" Berghems ; "
267439	267444	267446	267446	he	3054	" Now , ladies , "
267448	267491	267446	267446	he	3054	" I shall appeal to you . Here is a fender which at any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve , being , as I may say , for quality of steel and quaintness of design , a kind of thing"—here
267508	267631	267495	267495	his	510	finger—"that might not fall in with ordinary tastes . Allow me to tell you that by - and - by this style of workmanship will be the only one in vogue — half - a - crown , you said ? thank you — going at half - a - crown , this characteristic fender ; and I have particular information that the antique style is very much sought after in high quarters . Three shillings — three - and - sixpence — hold it well up , Joseph ! Look , ladies , at the chastity of the design — I have no doubt myself that it was turned out in the last century ! Four shillings , Mr. Mawmsey?—four shillings . "
267632	267647	267649	267650	Mrs. Mawmsey	617	" It 's not a thing I would put in my drawing - room , "
267662	267691	267649	267650	Mrs. Mawmsey	617	" I wonder at Mrs. Larcher . Every blessed child 's head that fell against it would be cut in two . The edge is like a knife . "
267692	267696	267698	267699	Mr. Trumbull	510	" Quite true , "
267703	267840	267698	267699	Mr. Trumbull	510	" and most uncommonly useful to have a fender at hand that will cut , if you have a leather shoe - tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and no knife at hand : many a man has been left hanging because there was no knife to cut him down . Gentlemen , here 's a fender that if you had the misfortune to hang yourselves would cut you down in no time — with astonishing celerity — four - and - sixpence — five — five - and - sixpence — an appropriate thing for a spare bedroom where there was a four - poster and a guest a little out of his mind — six shillings — thank you , Mr. Clintup — going at six shillings — going — gone ! "
267885	267894	267882	267882	he	3054	" Mr. Clintup . Be handy , Joseph . "
267895	267913	267915	267916	Mr. Clintup	722	" It was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always tell that joke on , "
267959	267964	267966	267967	Mr. Trumbull	510	" Now , ladies , "
267976	268098	267966	267967	Mr. Trumbull	510	" this tray contains a very recherchy lot — a collection of trifles for the drawing - room table — and trifles make the sum of human things — nothing more important than trifles—(yes , Mr. Ladislaw , yes , by - and - by)—but pass the tray round , Joseph — these bijoux must be examined , ladies . This I have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance — a sort of practical rebus , I may call it : here , you see , it looks like an elegant heart - shaped box , portable — for the pocket ; there , again , it becomes like a splendid double flower — an ornament for the table ; and now"—Mr
268113	268318	268100	268100	Trumbull	510	leaves—"a book of riddles ! No less than five hundred printed in a beautiful red . Gentlemen , if I had less of a conscience , I should not wish you to bid high for this lot — I have a longing for it myself . What can promote innocent mirth , and I may say virtue , more than a good riddle?—it hinders profane language , and attaches a man to the society of refined females . This ingenious article itself , without the elegant domino - box , card - basket , & c. , ought alone to give a high price to the lot . Carried in the pocket it might make an individual welcome in any society . Four shillings , sir?—four shillings for this remarkable collection of riddles with the et caeteras . Here is a sample : ' How must you spell honey to make it catch lady - birds ? Answer — money . ' You hear?—lady - birds — honey money . This is an amusement to sharpen the intellect ; it has a sting — it has what we call satire , and wit without indecency . Four - and - sixpence — five shillings . "
268480	268502	268504	268505	Mr. Toller	402	" Come , Trumbull , this is too bad — you've been putting some old maid 's rubbish into the sale , "
268513	268530	268504	268505	Mr. Toller	402	" I want to see how the prints go , and I must be off soon . "
268531	268678	268504	268505	Mr. Toller	402	" Immediately , Mr. Toller . It was only an act of benevolence which your noble heart would approve . Joseph ! quick with the prints — Lot 235 . Now , gentlemen , you who are connoissures , you are going to have a treat . Here is an engraving of the Duke of Wellington surrounded by his staff on the Field of Waterloo ; and notwithstanding recent events which have , as it were , enveloped our great Hero in a cloud , I will be bold to say — for a man in my line must not be blown about by political winds — that a finer subject — of the modern order , belonging to our own time and epoch — the understanding of man could hardly conceive : angels might , perhaps , but not men , sirs , not men . "
268679	268684	268686	268687	Mr. Powderell	403	" Who painted it ? "
268692	268710	268712	268712	Trumbull	510	" It is a proof before the letter , Mr. Powderell — the painter is not known , "
268735	268742	268744	268745	Mr. Powderell	403	" I 'll bid a pound ! "
268956	268961	268962	268962	His	5340	" given to indulgence . "
269012	269023	269025	269026	Mr. Horrock	448	" Who is it you 've picked up , Bam ? "
269030	269035	269025	269026	Mr. Horrock	448	" Ask him yourself , "
269040	269052	269037	269038	Mr. Bambridge	440	" He said he 'd just turned in from the road . "
269098	269102	269141	269141	He	5340	" Supper at Emmaus "
269178	269201	269202	269203	the auctioneer	3054	" Yes , Mr. Ladislaw , yes ; this interests you as a connoissure , I think . It is some pleasure , "
269211	269437	269202	269203	the auctioneer	3054	" to have a picture like this to show to a company of ladies and gentlemen — a picture worth any sum to an individual whose means were on a level with his judgment . It is a painting of the Italian school — by the celebrated Guydo , the greatest painter in the world , the chief of the Old Masters , as they are called — I take it , because they were up to a thing or two beyond most of us — in possession of secrets now lost to the bulk of mankind . Let me tell you , gentlemen , I have seen a great many pictures by the Old Masters , and they are not all up to this mark — some of them are darker than you might like and not family subjects . But here is a Guydo — the frame alone is worth pounds — which any lady might be proud to hang up — a suitable thing for what we call a refectory in a charitable institution , if any gentleman of the Corporation wished to show his munificence . Turn it a little , sir ? yes . Joseph , turn it a little towards Mr. Ladislaw — Mr. Ladislaw , having been abroad , understands the merit of these things , you observe . "
269453	269457	269446	269446	Will	261	" Five pounds . "
269466	269642	269458	269459	The auctioneer	3054	" Ah ! Mr. Ladislaw ! the frame alone is worth that . Ladies and gentlemen , for the credit of the town ! Suppose it should be discovered hereafter that a gem of art has been amongst us in this town , and nobody in Middlemarch awake to it . Five guineas — five seven - six — five ten . Still , ladies , still ! It is a gem , and ' Full many a gem , ' as the poet says , has been allowed to go at a nominal price because the public knew no better , because it was offered in circles where there was — I was going to say a low feeling , but no!—Six pounds — six guineas — a Guydo of the first order going at six guineas — it is an insult to religion , ladies ; it touches us all as Christians , gentlemen , that a subject like this should go at such a low figure — six pounds ten — seven — "
269914	269929	269899	269899	he	597	" Excuse me , Mr. Ladislaw — was your mother 's name Sarah Dunkirk ? "
269950	269965	269934	269934	his	261	" Yes , sir , it was . And what is that to you ? "
269997	270004	270018	270018	he	597	" What is that to you ? "
270085	270137	270072	270073	Mr. Raffles	597	" No offence , my good sir , no offence ! I only remember your mother — knew her when she was a girl . But it is your father that you feature , sir . I had the pleasure of seeing your father too . Parents alive , Mr. Ladislaw ? "
270138	270141	270143	270143	Will	261	" No ! "
270152	270176	270143	270143	Will	261	" Should be glad to do you a service , Mr. Ladislaw — by Jove , I should ! Hope to meet again . "
270343	270451	270340	270340	Raffles	727	" I 've been abroad myself , Mr. Ladislaw — I've seen the world — used to parley - vous a little . It was at Boulogne I saw your father — a most uncommon likeness you are of him , by Jove ! mouth — nose — eyes — hair turned off your brow just like his — a little in the foreign style . John Bull does n't do much of that . But your father was very ill when I saw him . Lord , lord ! hands you might see through . You were a small youngster then . Did he get well ? "
270452	270455	270457	270457	Will	261	" No , "

270593	270788	270587	270588	Here Raffles	597	" Lord bless you , I knew all about 'em — a little in what you may call the respectable thieving line — the high style of receiving - house — none of your holes and corners — first - rate . Slap - up shop , high profits and no mistake . But Lord ! Sarah would have known nothing about it — a dashing young lady she was — fine boarding - school — fit for a lord 's wife — only Archie Duncan threw it at her out of spite , because she would have nothing to do with him . And so she ran away from the whole concern . I travelled for 'em , sir , in a gentlemanly way — at a high salary . They did n't mind her running away at first — godly folks , sir , very godly — and she was for the stage . The son was alive then , and the daughter was at a discount . Hallo ! here we are at the Blue Bull . What do you say , Mr. Ladislaw?—shall we turn in and have a glass ? "

271081	271101	271070	271070	she	5380	" there has been such a disagreeable man here asking for you — it has made me quite uncomfortable . "
271102	271111	271113	271114	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" What kind of man , my dear , "
271122	271270	271113	271114	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" A red - faced man with large whiskers , and most impudent in his manner . He declared he was an old friend of yours , and said you would be sorry not to see him . He wanted to wait for you here , but I told him he could see you at the Bank to - morrow morning . Most impudent he was!—stared at me , and said his friend Nick had luck in wives . I do n't believe he would have gone away , if Blucher had not happened to break his chain and come running round on the gravel — for I was in the garden ; so I said , ' You 'd better go away — the dog is very fierce , and I ca n't hold him . ' Do you really know anything of such a man ? "

275263	275351	275352	275352	Will	261	" Thank you , she is quite satisfied ; she has gone out with her daughters this evening . I begged you to come , Mr. Ladislaw , because I have a communication of a very private — indeed , I will say , of a sacredly confidential nature , which I desire to make to you . Nothing , I dare say , has been farther from your thoughts than that there had been important ties in the past which could connect your history with mine . "
275455	275462	275445	275445	He	261	" No , indeed , nothing . "
275463	275543	275544	275544	Will	261	" You see before you , Mr. Ladislaw , a man who is deeply stricken . But for the urgency of conscience and the knowledge that I am before the bar of One who seeth not as man seeth , I should be under no compulsion to make the disclosure which has been my object in asking you to come here to - night . So far as human laws go , you have no claim on me whatever . "
275582	275633	275571	275571	he	274	" I am told that your mother 's name was Sarah Dunkirk , and that she ran away from her friends to go on the stage . Also , that your father was at one time much emaciated by illness . May I ask if you can confirm these statements ? "
275634	275642	275644	275644	Will	261	" Yes , they are all true , "
275715	275727	275728	275728	he	274	" Do you know any particulars of your mother 's family ? "
275731	275751	275753	275753	Will	261	" No ; she never liked to speak of them . She was a very generous , honourable woman , "
275758	275780	275753	275753	Will	261	" I do not wish to allege anything against her . Did she never mention her mother to you at all ? "
275781	275813	275831	275831	he	274	" I have heard her say that she thought her mother did not know the reason of her running away . She said ' poor mother ' in a pitying tone . "
275814	275821	275823	275823	Bulstrode	274	" That mother became my wife , "
275834	275906	275831	275831	he	274	" you have a claim on me , Mr. Ladislaw : as I said before , not a legal claim , but one which my conscience recognizes . I was enriched by that marriage — a result which would probably not have taken place — certainly not to the same extent — if your grandmother could have discovered her daughter . That daughter , I gather , is no longer living ! "
275907	275910	275912	275912	Will	261	" No , "
275954	275962	275964	275964	Bulstrode	274	" Pray be seated , Mr. Ladislaw , "
275968	275996	275964	275964	Bulstrode	274	" Doubtless you are startled by the suddenness of this discovery . But I entreat your patience with one who is already bowed down by inward trial . "
276019	276081	276082	276083	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" It is my wish , Mr. Ladislaw , to make amends for the deprivation which befell your mother . I know that you are without fortune , and I wish to supply you adequately from a store which would have probably already been yours had your grandmother been certain of your mother 's existence and been able to find her . "
276205	276226	276199	276199	Will	261	" I suppose you did know of my mother 's existence , and knew where she might have been found . "
276299	276309	276310	276310	he	274	" I will not deny that you conjecture rightly , "
276320	276441	276310	276310	he	274	" And I wish to make atonement to you as the one still remaining who has suffered a loss through me . You enter , I trust , into my purpose , Mr. Ladislaw , which has a reference to higher than merely human claims , and as I have already said , is entirely independent of any legal compulsion . I am ready to narrow my own resources and the prospects of my family by binding myself to allow you five hundred pounds yearly during my life , and to leave you a proportional capital at my death — nay , to do still more , if more should be definitely necessary to any laudable project on your part . "
276503	276544	276490	276490	He	261	" Before I make any reply to your proposition , Mr. Bulstrode , I must beg you to answer a question or two . Were you connected with the business by which that fortune you speak of was originally made ? "
276551	276557	276545	276546	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" Raffles has told him . "
276577	276580	276574	276574	He	261	" Yes . "
276581	276622	276623	276623	Will	261	" And was that business — or was it not — a thoroughly dishonourable one — nay , one that , if its nature had been made public , might have ranked those concerned in it with thieves and convicts ? "
276700	276727	276728	276728	he	274	" The business was established before I became connected with it , sir ; nor is it for you to institute an inquiry of that kind , "
276742	276748	276750	276750	Will	261	" Yes , it is , "
276762	276925	276750	276750	Will	261	" It is eminently mine to ask such questions , when I have to decide whether I will have transactions with you and accept your money . My unblemished honour is important to me . It is important to me to have no stain on my birth and connections . And now I find there is a stain which I ca n't help . My mother felt it , and tried to keep as clear of it as she could , and so will I. You shall keep your ill - gotten money . If I had any fortune of my own , I would willingly pay it to any one who could disprove what you have told me . What I have to thank you for is that you kept the money till now , when I can refuse it . It ought to lie with a man 's self that he is a gentleman . Good - night , sir . "

278307	278344	278300	278301	Mrs. Cadwallader	180	" Only it is desirable that Dorothea should know there are reasons why she should not receive him again ; and I really ca n't say so to her . It will come lightly from you . "

It seems nobody ever goes into the house without finding this young gentleman lying on the rug or warbling at the piano . But the people in manufacturing towns are always disreputable . "
278594	278616	278618	278618	Dorothea	189	" You began by saying that one report was false , Mrs. Cadwallader , and I believe this is false too , "
278624	278655	278618	278618	Dorothea	189	" at least , I feel sure it is a misrepresentation . I will not hear any evil spoken of Mr. Ladislaw ; he has already suffered too much injustice . "
278739	278862	278735	278735	her	180	said—"Heaven grant it , my dear!—I mean that all bad tales about anybody may be false . But it is a pity that young Lydgate should have married one of these Middlemarch girls . Considering he 's a son of somebody , he might have got a woman with good blood in her veins , and not too young , who would have put up with his profession . There 's Clara Harfager , for instance , whose friends do n't know what to do with her ; and she has a portion . Then we might have had her among us . However!—it 's no use being wise for other people . Where is Celia ? Pray let us go in . "
278863	278872	278874	278874	Dorothea	189	" I am going on immediately to Tipton , "
278879	278884	278874	278874	Dorothea	189	" Good - by . "

279091	279123	279125	279125	her	5569	" They all try to blacken him before me ; but I will care for no pain , if he is not to blame . I always believed he was good . "—These
279231	279268	279228	279228	she	5569	" I must stay here a little , Mrs. Kell . I will go into the library and write you some memoranda from my uncle 's letter , if you will open the shutters for me . "
279269	279277	279279	279280	Mrs. Kell	739	" The shutters are open , madam , "
279293	279303	279283	279283	Dorothea	189	" Mr. Ladislaw is there , looking for something . "
279400	279413	279394	279394	she	5575	" Go in first , and tell him that I am here . "
279500	279509	279492	279493	Mrs. Kell	739	" Mrs. Casaubon is coming in , sir . "
279616	279621	279623	279623	Dorothea	189	" Pray sit down , "

279833	279855	279857	279857	Dorothea	189	" I thought we had parted when you came to Lowick many weeks ago — you thought you were going then , "
279865	279918	279919	279919	Will	261	" Yes ; but I was in ignorance then of things which I know now — things which have altered my feelings about the future . When I saw you before , I was dreaming that I might come back some day . I do n't think I ever shall — now . "
279923	279932	279934	279934	Dorothea	189	" You wished me to know the reasons ? "
279938	279941	279943	279943	Will	261	" Yes , "
279963	280054	279960	279960	his	261	" Of course I must wish it . I have been grossly insulted in your eyes and in the eyes of others . There has been a mean implication against my character . I wish you to know that under no circumstances would I have lowered myself by — under no circumstances would I have given men the chance of saying that I sought money under the pretext of seeking — something else . There was no need of other safeguard against me — the safeguard of wealth was enough . "
280159	280178	280179	280179	she	5587	" It would be very unkind of you to suppose that I ever attributed any meanness to you , "
280215	280226	280194	280194	she	5587	" Do you suppose that I ever disbelieved in you ? "
280353	280365	280342	280342	She	5587	" I am sure no safeguard was ever needed against you . "
280519	280524	280525	280525	he	261	" I must go , "

280571	280588	280567	280567	Dorothea	189	" Have your intentions remained just the same as when we said good - by before ? "

280608	280633	280594	280594	Will	261	" I shall work away at the first thing that offers . I suppose one gets a habit of doing without happiness or hope . "
280634	280641	280643	280643	Dorothea	189	" Oh , what sad words ! "
280660	280674	280657	280657	she	5587	" We used to agree that we were alike in speaking too strongly . "
280675	280684	280686	280686	Will	261	" I have not spoken too strongly now , "
280697	280823	280686	280686	Will	261	" There are certain things which a man can only go through once in his life ; and he must know some time or other that the best is over with him . This experience has happened to me while I am very young — that is all . What I care more for than I can ever care for anything else is absolutely forbidden to me — I do n't mean merely by being out of my reach , but forbidden me , even if it were within my reach , by my own pride and honour — by everything I respect myself for . Of course I shall go on living as a man might do who had seen heaven in a trance . "

282462	282475	282443	282444	the Vicar	8024	" I am out of the way and he is too busy . "
282476	282487	282489	282490	Dr. Minchin	355	" Is he ? I am glad to hear it , "
282498	282511	282513	282514	Mr. Farebrother	335	" He gives a great deal of time to the New Hospital , "

282575	282590	282592	282593	Mr. Toller	402	" And preparing theories of treatment to try on the patients , I suppose , "
282595	282603	282605	282606	Mr. Farebrother	335	" Come , Toller , be candid , "
282608	282679	282605	282606	Mr. Farebrother	335	" You are too clever not to see the good of a bold fresh mind in medicine , as well as in everything else ; and as to cholera , I fancy , none of you are very sure what you ought to do . If a man goes a little too far along a new road , it is usually himself that he harms more than any one else . "
282680	282694	282696	282697	Dr. Minchin	355	" I am sure you and Wrench ought to be obliged to him , "
282703	282716	282696	282697	Dr. Minchin	355	" for he has sent you the cream of Peacock 's patients . "
282717	282731	282733	282735	Mr. Harry Toller	402	" Lydgate has been living at a great rate for a young beginner , "
282740	282752	282737	282738	the brewer	5618	" I suppose his relations in the North back him up . "
282753	282758	282760	282761	Mr. Chichely	275	" I hope so , "
282763	282801	282760	282761	Mr. Chichely	275	" else he ought not to have married that nice girl we were all so fond of . Hang it , one has a grudge against a man who carries off the prettiest girl in the town . "
282802	282813	282815	282816	Mr. Standish	273	" Ay , by God ! and the best too , "
282818	282833	282835	282836	Mr. Chichely	275	" My friend Vincy did n't half like the marriage , I know that , "
282838	282861	282835	282836	Mr. Chichely	275	" He would n't do much . How the relations on the other side may have come down I ca n't say . "
282877	282893	282895	282896	Mr. Toller	402	" Oh , I should n't think Lydgate ever looked to practice for a living , "
283091	283103	283082	283082	he	335	" there must be a systole and diastole in all inquiry , "
283106	283131	283082	283082	he	335	" a man 's mind must be continually expanding and shrinking between the whole human horizon and the horizon of an object - glass . "
283187	283196	283184	283184	his	335	" He may have been taking an opiate , "
283205	283214	283184	283184	his	335	mind—"tic - douloureux perhaps — or medical worries . "
283290	283300	283302	283303	the Vicar	8024	" However , Lydgate fell in love with her , "
283307	283316	283302	283303	the Vicar	8024	" and she must be to his taste . "
283618	283624	283637	283637	her	290	" bowled out by Farebrother , "
283685	283687	283668	283668	herself	290	" feature "
283973	283990	283962	283963	Mrs. Farebrother	392	said—"You have to give up a great deal of your husband 's society , Mrs. Lydgate . "
283991	284018	284020	284020	Rosamond	283	" Yes , the life of a medical man is very arduous : especially when he is so devoted to his profession as Mr. Lydgate is , "
284039	284052	284054	284055	Mrs. Vincy	290	" It is dreadfully dull for her when there is no company , "
284067	284154	284054	284055	Mrs. Vincy	290	" I am sure I thought so when Rosamond was ill , and I was staying with her . You know , Mrs. Farebrother , ours is a cheerful house . I am of a cheerful disposition myself , and Mr. Vincy always likes something to be going on . That is what Rosamond has been used to . Very different from a husband out at odd hours , and never knowing when he will come home , and of a close , proud disposition , I think"—indiscreet
284166	284227	284159	284159	her	290	" But Rosamond always had an angel of a temper ; her brothers used very often not to please her , but she was never the girl to show temper ; from a baby she was always as good as good , and with a complexion beyond anything . But my children are all good - tempered , thank God . "
284347	284371	284327	284327	Louisa	382	" Oh mamma , mamma , the little man stamped so hard on the floor he could n't get his leg out again ! "
284372	284379	284381	284381	mamma	6725	" Bless you , my cherub ! "
284383	284399	284381	284381	mamma	6725	" you shall tell me all about it to - morrow . Go and listen ! "
284555	284571	284573	284573	Fred	282	" You will never care any more about my one - eyed giant , Loo , "
284578	284589	284591	284591	Louisa	382	" Yes , I shall . Tell about him now , "
284593	284610	284591	284591	Louisa	382	" Oh , I dare say ; I am quite cut out . Ask Mr. Farebrother . "
284611	284614	284616	284616	Mary	301	" Yes , "
284618	284664	284616	284616	Mary	301	" ask Mr. Farebrother to tell you about the ants whose beautiful house was knocked down by a giant named Tom , and he thought they did n't mind because he could n't hear them cry , or see them use their pocket - handkerchiefs . "
284665	284668	284670	284670	Louisa	382	" Please , "
284678	284713	284715	284715	he	8024	" No , no , I am a grave old parson . If I try to draw a story out of my bag a sermon comes instead . Shall I preach you a sermon ? "
284731	284734	284736	284736	Louisa	382	" Yes , "
284740	284767	284736	284736	Louisa	382	" Let me see , then . Against cakes : how cakes are bad things , especially if they are sweet and have plums in them . "
284788	284805	284807	284808	Mr. Farebrother	335	" Ah , I see it will not do to preach on New Year 's Day , "
284845	284854	284856	284857	Mrs. Farebrother	392	" A delightful young person is Miss Garth , "
284868	284871	284873	284874	Mrs. Vincy	290	" Yes , "
284889	284901	284881	284883	the old lady	8041	" It is a pity she is not better - looking . "
284902	284909	284911	284912	Mrs. Farebrother	392	" I can not say that , "
284916	284965	284911	284912	Mrs. Farebrother	392	" I like her countenance . We must not always ask for beauty , when a good God has seen fit to make an excellent young woman without it . I put good manners first , and Miss Garth will know how to conduct herself in any station . "
285142	285154	285156	285157	the Vicar	8024	" You are the man I was going to look for , "
285190	285204	285205	285205	he	8024	" You see , I can leave the whist - table easily enough , "
285213	285232	285205	285205	he	8024	" now I do n't play for money . I owe that to you , Mrs. Casaubon says . "
285233	285236	285238	285238	Lydgate	278	" How ? "
285242	285312	285238	285238	Lydgate	278	" Ah , you did n't mean me to know it ; I call that ungenerous reticence . You should let a man have the pleasure of feeling that you have done him a good turn . I do n't enter into some people 's dislike of being under an obligation : upon my word , I prefer being under an obligation to everybody for behaving well to me . "
285313	285322	285324	285324	Lydgate	278	" I ca n't tell what you mean , "
285326	285360	285362	285362	Lydgate	278	" unless it is that I once spoke of you to Mrs. Casaubon . But I did not think that she would break her promise not to mention that I had done so , "
285384	285450	285238	285238	Lydgate	278	" It was Brooke who let it out , only the other day . He paid me the compliment of saying that he was very glad I had the living though you had come across his tactics , and had praised me up as a Ken and a Tillotson , and that sort of thing , till Mrs. Casaubon would hear of no one else . "
285451	285463	285465	285465	Lydgate	278	" Oh , Brooke is such a leaky - minded fool , "
285469	285584	285465	285465	Lydgate	278	" Well , I was glad of the leakiness then . I do n't see why you should n't like me to know that you wished to do me a service , my dear fellow . And you certainly have done me one . It 's rather a strong check to one 's self - complacency to find how much of one 's right doing depends on not being in want of money . A man will not be tempted to say the Lord 's Prayer backward to please the devil , if he does n't want the devil 's services . I have no need to hang on the smiles of chance now . "
285585	285600	285602	285602	Lydgate	278	" I do n't see that there 's any money - getting without chance , "
285604	285623	285602	285602	Lydgate	278	" if a man gets it in a profession , it 's pretty sure to come by chance . "
285676	285730	285665	285665	He	335	" Ah , there 's enormous patience wanted with the way of the world . But it is the easier for a man to wait patiently when he has friends who love him , and ask for nothing better than to help him through , so far as it lies in their power . "
285731	285735	285737	285737	Lydgate	278	" Oh yes , "
285753	285767	285768	285768	He	278	" People make much more of their difficulties than they need to do . "
285855	285860	285863	285863	he	278	" mention his case , "
285929	285935	285937	285938	the Vicar	8024	" What time are you ? "
285945	285949	285951	285951	Lydgate	278	" After eleven , "
286089	286096	286138	286138	Lydgate	278	" time to look about him . "
286255	286275	286282	286282	him	278	" This is what I am thinking of ; and that is what I might have been thinking of , "
286586	286602	286603	286603	he	278	" We two can do with only one servant , and live on very little , "
286606	286615	286603	286603	he	278	" and I shall manage with one horse . "
286681	286696	286698	286698	Rosamond	283	" Of course you can dismiss the other two servants , if you like , "
286700	286732	286698	286698	Rosamond	283	" but I should have thought it would be very injurious to your position for us to live in a poor way . You must expect your practice to be lowered . "
286733	286854	286855	286855	He	5713	" My dear Rosamond , it is not a question of choice . We have begun too expensively . Peacock , you know , lived in a much smaller house than this . It is my fault : I ought to have known better , and I deserve a thrashing — if there were anybody who had a right to give it me — for bringing you into the necessity of living in a poorer way than you have been used to . But we married because we loved each other , I suppose . And that may help us to pull along till things get better . Come , dear , put down that work and come to me . "
287000	287106	286993	286993	he	5713	" I find , now I look into things a little , Rosy , that it is wonderful what an amount of money slips away in our housekeeping . I suppose the servants are careless , and we have had a great many people coming . But there must be many in our rank who manage with much less : they must do with commoner things , I suppose , and look after the scraps . It seems , money goes but a little way in these matters , for Wrench has everything as plain as possible , and he has a very large practice . "
287107	287120	287122	287122	Rosamond	283	" Oh , if you think of living as the Wrenches do ! "
287132	287147	287122	287122	Rosamond	283	" But I have heard you express your disgust at that way of living . "
287148	287185	286993	286993	he	5713	" Yes , they have bad taste in everything — they make economy look ugly . We need n't do that . I only meant that they avoid expenses , although Wrench has a capital practice . "
287186	287254	287256	287256	Rosamond	283	" Why should not you have a good practice , Tertius ? Mr. Peacock had . You should be more careful not to offend people , and you should send out medicines as the others do . I am sure you began well , and you got several good houses . It can not answer to be eccentric ; you should think what will be generally liked , "
287319	287395	287304	287304	he	278	" What I am to do in my practice , Rosy , it is for me to judge . That is not the question between us . It is enough for you to know that our income is likely to be a very narrow one — hardly four hundred , perhaps less , for a long time to come , and we must try to re - arrange our lives in accordance with that fact . "
287413	287443	287396	287396	Rosamond	283	" My uncle Bulstrode ought to allow you a salary for the time you give to the Hospital : it is not right that you should work for nothing . "
287444	287479	287481	287481	Lydgate	278	" It was understood from the beginning that my services would be gratuitous . That , again , need not enter into our discussion . I have pointed out what is the only probability , "
287495	287592	287489	287489	he	278	" I think I see one resource which would free us from a good deal of the present difficulty . I hear that young Ned Plymdale is going to be married to Miss Sophy Toller . They are rich , and it is not often that a good house is vacant in Middlemarch . I feel sure that they would be glad to take this house from us with most of our furniture , and they would be willing to pay handsomely for the lease . I can employ Trumbull to speak to Plymdale about it . "
287668	287682	287646	287646	Lydgate	278	" I am very sorry , Rosamond ; I know this is painful . "
287683	287718	287837	287837	Lydgate	278	" I thought , at least , when I had borne to send the plate back and have that man taking an inventory of the furniture — I should have thought that would suffice . "
287719	287836	287837	287837	Lydgate	278	" I explained it to you at the time , dear . That was only a security and behind that security there is a debt . And that debt must be paid within the next few months , else we shall have our furniture sold . If young Plymdale will take our house and most of our furniture , we shall be able to pay that debt , and some others too , and we shall be quit of a place too expensive for us . We might take a smaller house : Trumbull , I know , has a very decent one to let at thirty pounds a - year , and this is ninety . "
287917	287933	287907	287907	she	283	" I never could have believed that you would like to act in that way . "
287934	287938	287945	287945	his	278	" Like it ? "
287961	287988	287989	287989	He	278	" it 's not a question of liking . Of course , I do n't like it ; it 's the only thing I can do . "
287999	288012	288014	288014	Rosamond	283	" I should have thought there were many other means than that , "
288016	288027	288014	288014	Rosamond	283	" Let us have a sale and leave Middlemarch altogether . "
288028	288063	288065	288065	Lydgate	278	" To do what ? What is the use of my leaving my work in Middlemarch to go where I have none ? We should be just as penniless elsewhere as we are here , "
288070	288089	288091	288091	Rosamond	283	" If we are to be in that position it will be entirely your own doing , Tertius , "
288102	288177	288091	288091	Rosamond	283	" You will not behave as you ought to do to your own family . You offended Captain Lydgate . Sir Godwin was very kind to me when we were at Quallingham , and I am sure if you showed proper regard to him and told him your affairs , he would do anything for you . But rather than that , you like giving up our house and furniture to Mr. Ned Plymdale . "
288195	288248	288189	288189	he	278	" Well , then , if you will have it so , I do like it . I admit that I like it better than making a fool of myself by going to beg where it 's of no use . Understand then , that it is what I like to do . "
288526	288534	288498	288498	she	5732	" She will never love me much , "
288543	288551	288498	288498	she	5732	" I shall love her no more . "
288687	288695	288676	288676	herself	283	" Have you spoken to Trumbull yet ? "
288696	288699	288701	288701	Lydgate	278	" No , "
288703	288723	288701	288701	Lydgate	278	" but I shall call on him as I go by this morning . No time must be lost . "
288834	288971	289017	289018	Mrs. Plymdale	337	" Yes , Ned is most happy , I must say . And Sophy Toller is all I could desire in a daughter - in - law . Of course her father is able to do something handsome for her — that is only what would be expected with a brewery like his . And the connection is everything we should desire . But that is not what I look at . She is such a very nice girl — no airs , no pretensions , though on a level with the first . I do n't mean with the titled aristocracy . I see very little good in people aiming out of their own sphere . I mean that Sophy is equal to the best in the town , and she is contented with that . "
288972	288981	288983	288983	Rosamond	283	" I have always thought her very agreeable , "
288985	289015	289017	289018	Mrs. Plymdale	337	" I look upon it as a reward for Ned , who never held his head too high , that he should have got into the very best connection , "
289036	289105	289020	289020	her	337	" And such particular people as the Tollers are , they might have objected because some of our friends are not theirs . It is well known that your aunt Bulstrode and I have been intimate from our youth , and Mr. Plymdale has been always on Mr. Bulstrode 's side . And I myself prefer serious opinions . But the Tollers have welcomed Ned all the same . "
289106	289122	289124	289124	Rosamond	283	" I am sure he is a very deserving , well - principled young man , "
289141	289201	289020	289020	her	337	" Oh , he has not the style of a captain in the army , or that sort of carriage as if everybody was beneath him , or that showy kind of talking , and singing , and intellectual talent . But I am thankful he has not . It is a poor preparation both for here and Hereafter . "
289202	289217	289219	289219	Rosamond	283	" Oh dear , yes ; appearances have very little to do with happiness , "
289221	289241	289219	289219	Rosamond	283	" I think there is every prospect of their being a happy couple . What house will they take ? "
289242	289317	289020	289020	her	337	" Oh , as for that , they must put up with what they can get . They have been looking at the house in St. Peter 's Place , next to Mr. Hackbutt 's ; it belongs to him , and he is putting it nicely in repair . I suppose they are not likely to hear of a better . Indeed , I think Ned will decide the matter to - day . "
289318	289335	289219	289219	Rosamond	283	" I should think it is a nice house ; I like St. Peter 's Place . "
289336	289379	289381	289382	Mrs. Plymdale	337	" Well , it is near the Church , and a genteel situation . But the windows are narrow , and it is all ups and downs . You do n't happen to know of any other that would be at liberty ? "
289401	289413	289385	289385	her	337	" Oh no ; I hear so little of those things . "
289655	289673	289647	289647	she	283	right—"indeed , if it had not been , she would not have wished to act on it . "
289816	289830	289832	289834	the good auctioneer	5749	" Yes , ma'am , yes , he did ; he did so , "
289845	289867	289832	289834	the good auctioneer	5749	" I was about to fulfil his order , if possible , this afternoon . He wished me not to procrastinate . "
289868	289904	289832	289834	the good auctioneer	5749	" I called to tell you not to go any further , Mr. Trumbull ; and I beg of you not to mention what has been said on the subject . Will you oblige me ? "
289905	289936	289938	289939	Mr. Trumbull	510	" Certainly I will , Mrs. Lydgate , certainly . Confidence is sacred with me on business or any other topic . I am then to consider the commission withdrawn ? "
289959	290017	289956	289956	Rosamond	283	" Yes , if you please . I find that Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house — the one in St. Peter 's Place next to Mr. Hackbutt 's . Mr. Lydgate would be annoyed that his orders should be fulfilled uselessly . And besides that , there are other circumstances which render the proposal unnecessary . "
290018	290042	290044	290045	Mr. Trumbull	510	" Very good , Mrs. Lydgate , very good . I am at your commands , whenever you require any service of me , "
290060	290075	290044	290045	Mr. Trumbull	510	" Rely on me , I beg . The affair shall go no further . "
290115	290162	290112	290112	He	278	" If she will be happy and I can rub through , what does it all signify ? It is only a narrow swamp that we have to pass in a long journey . If I can get my mind clear again , I shall do . "
290306	290316	290287	290287	Rosamond	283	" Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house already . "
290352	290358	290349	290349	he	278	" How do you know ? "
290359	290391	290349	290349	he	278	" I called at Mrs. Plymdale 's this morning , and she told me that he had taken the house in St. Peter 's Place , next to Mr. Hackbutt 's . "
290561	290586	290555	290555	he	278	" Perhaps some one else may turn up . I told Trumbull to be on the look - out if he failed with Plymdale . "
290638	290650	290635	290635	she	283	" How much money is it that those disagreeable people want ? "
290651	290656	290635	290635	she	283	" What disagreeable people ? "
290657	290687	290688	290688	Lydgate	278	" Those who took the list — and the others . I mean , how much money would satisfy them so that you need not be troubled any more ? "
290707	290757	290697	290697	he	278	" Oh , if I could have got six hundred from Plymdale for furniture and as premium , I might have managed . I could have paid off Dover , and given enough on account to the others to make them wait patiently , if we contracted our expenses . "
290758	290774	290836	290836	she	283	" But I mean how much should you want if we stayed in this house ? "
290775	290785	290787	290787	Lydgate	278	" More than I am likely to get anywhere , "
290818	290827	290829	290829	Rosamond	283	" Why should you not mention the sum ? "
290843	290846	290848	290848	Lydgate	278	" Well , "
290854	290870	290871	290871	he	278	" it would take at least a thousand to set me at ease . But , "
290876	290892	290871	290871	he	278	" I have to consider what I shall do without it , not with it . "
291382	291476	291477	291477	Rosamond	283	" I shall try to see Trumbull this morning , and tell him to advertise the house in the ' Pioneer ' and the ' Trumpet . ' If the thing were advertised , some one might be inclined to take it who would not otherwise have thought of a change . In these country places many people go on in their old houses when their families are too large for them , for want of knowing where they can find another . And Trumbull seems to have got no bite at all . "
291486	291495	291496	291496	she	283	" I ordered Trumbull not to inquire further , "
291534	291537	291521	291521	he	278	" little language "
291628	291639	291625	291625	his	278	" May I ask when and why you did so ? "
291640	291724	291625	291625	his	278	" When I knew that the Plymdales had taken a house , I called to tell him not to mention ours to them ; and at the same time I told him not to let the affair go on any further . I knew that it would be very injurious to you if it were known that you wished to part with your house and furniture , and I had a very strong objection to it . I think that was reason enough . "
291725	291761	291773	291773	his	278	" It was of no consequence then that I had told you imperative reasons of another kind ; of no consequence that I had come to a different conclusion , and given an order accordingly ? "
291826	291849	291823	291823	She	283	" I think I had a perfect right to speak on a subject which concerns me at least as much as you . "
291850	291885	291887	291887	Lydgate	278	" Clearly — you had a right to speak , but only to me . You had no right to contradict my orders secretly , and treat me as if I were a fool , "
291902	291937	291823	291823	She	283	" Is it possible to make you understand what the consequences will be ? Is it of any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the house ? "
291938	291950	291952	291952	Rosamond	283	" It is not necessary for you to tell me again , "
291967	292028	291952	291952	Rosamond	283	" I remembered what you said . You spoke just as violently as you do now . But that does not alter my opinion that you ought to try every other means rather than take a step which is so painful to me . And as to advertising the house , I think it would be perfectly degrading to you . "
292029	292041	292083	292083	Lydgate	278	" And suppose I disregard your opinion as you disregard mine ? "
292042	292082	292083	292083	Lydgate	278	" You can do so , of course . But I think you ought to have told me before we were married that you would place me in the worst position , rather than give up your own will . "
292203	292262	292196	292196	Rosamond	283	" When we were married everyone felt that your position was very high . I could not have imagined then that you would want to sell our furniture , and take a house in Bride Street , where the rooms are like cages . If we are to live in that way let us at least leave Middlemarch . "
292263	292271	292273	292273	Lydgate	278	" These would be very strong considerations , "
292297	292313	292288	292288	he	278	drink—"these would be very strong considerations if I did not happen to be in debt . "
292314	292368	292370	292370	Rosamond	283	" Many persons must have been in debt in the same way , but if they are respectable , people trust them . I am sure I have heard papa say that the Torbits were in debt , and they went on very well . It can not be good to act rashly , "
292554	292582	292584	292584	Rosamond	283	" I may at least request that you will not go to Trumbull at present — until it has been seen that there are no other means , "
292610	292630	292631	292631	Lydgate	278	" Promise me that you will not go to him for a few weeks , or without telling me . "
292637	292657	292658	292658	he	278	" I think it is I who should exact a promise that you will do nothing without telling me , "
292675	292688	292690	292690	Rosamond	283	" You remember that we are going to dine at papa 's , "
292710	292714	292707	292707	he	278	" Oh yes , "
293883	293897	293876	293876	she	283	" Tertius , come in here — here is a letter for you . "
293898	293901	293902	293902	he	963	" Ah ? "
293929	293934	293935	293935	he	963	" My uncle Godwin ! "
294005	294034	293993	293993	he	963	" It will be impossible to endure life with you , if you will always be acting secretly — acting in opposition to me and hiding your actions . "
294098	294346	294081	294081	Rosamond	283	" DEAR TERTIUS,—Don't set your wife to write to me when you have anything to ask . It is a roundabout wheedling sort of thing which I should not have credited you with . I never choose to write to a woman on matters of business . As to my supplying you with a thousand pounds , or only half that sum , I can do nothing of the sort . My own family drains me to the last penny . With two younger sons and three daughters , I am not likely to have cash to spare . You seem to have got through your own money pretty quickly , and to have made a mess where you are ; the sooner you go somewhere else the better . But I have nothing to do with men of your profession , and ca n't help you there . I did the best I could for you as guardian , and let you have your own way in taking to medicine . You might have gone into the army or the Church . Your money would have held out for that , and there would have been a surer ladder before you . Your uncle Charles has had a grudge against you for not going into his profession , but not I. I have always wished you well , but you must consider yourself on your own legs entirely now . Your affectionate uncle , GODWIN LYDGATE . "
294404	294454	294386	294386	Lydgate	278	" Will this be enough to convince you of the harm you may do by secret meddling ? Have you sense enough to recognize now your incompetence to judge and act for me — to interfere with your ignorance in affairs which it belongs to me to decide on ? "
294487	294585	294475	294475	She	283	" I had nearly resolved on going to Quallingham . It would have cost me pain enough to do it , yet it might have been of some use . But it has been of no use for me to think of anything . You have always been counteracting me secretly . You delude me with a false assent , and then I am at the mercy of your devices . If you mean to resist every wish I express , say so and defy me . I shall at least know what I am doing then . "
294850	294858	294859	294859	he	278	" Can you not see , Rosamond , "
294872	294965	294859	294859	he	278	" that nothing can be so fatal as a want of openness and confidence between us ? It has happened again and again that I have expressed a decided wish , and you have seemed to assent , yet after that you have secretly disobeyed my wish . In that way I can never know what I have to trust to . There would be some hope for us if you would admit this . Am I such an unreasonable , furious brute ? Why should you not be open with me ? "
294969	294993	294995	294995	Lydgate	278	" Will you only say that you have been mistaken , and that I may depend on your not acting secretly in future ? "
295019	295144	295014	295014	She	283	" I can not possibly make admissions or promises in answer to such words as you have used towards me . I have not been accustomed to language of that kind . You have spoken of my ' secret meddling , ' and my ' interfering ignorance , ' and my ' false assent . ' I have never expressed myself in that way to you , and I think that you ought to apologize . You spoke of its being impossible to live with me . Certainly you have not made my life pleasant to me of late . I think it was to be expected that I should try to avert some of the hardships which our marriage has brought on me . "
295418	295429	295415	295416	her master	7920	" You have not made my life pleasant to me of late"—"the
295437	295474	295475	295475	Rosamond	283	me"—these words were stinging his imagination as a pain makes an exaggerated dream . If he were not only to sink from his highest resolve , but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate ? "
295477	295491	295492	295492	you	283	" he said , turning his eyes on her with a melancholy look , "
295592	295593	295584	295584	you	283	" "
295610	295629	295594	295594	I	0	" said Rosamond , the tears coming again from a softened feeling now that her husband had softened . "
295664	297349	297350	297350	I	0	" She spoke and wept with that gentleness which makes such words and tears omnipotent over a loving - hearted man . Lydgate drew his chair near to hers and pressed her delicate head against his cheek with his powerful tender hand . He only caressed her ; he did not say anything ; for what was there to say ? He could not promise to shield her from the dreaded wretchedness , for he could see no sure means of doing so . When he left her to go out again , he told himself that it was ten times harder for her than for him : he had a life away from home , and constant appeals to his activity on behalf of others . He wished to excuse everything in her if he could — but it was inevitable that in that excusing mood he should think of her as if she were an animal of another and feebler species . Nevertheless she had mastered him . Lydgate certainly had good reason to reflect on the service his practice did him in counteracting his personal cares . He had no longer free energy enough for spontaneous research and speculative thinking , but by the bedside of patients , the direct external calls on his judgment and sympathies brought the added impulse needed to draw him out of himself . It was not simply that beneficent harness of routine which enables silly men to live respectably and unhappy men to live calmly — it was a perpetual claim on the immediate fresh application of thought , and on the consideration of another 's need and trial . Many of us looking back through life would say that the kindest man we have ever known has been a medical man , or perhaps that surgeon whose fine tact , directed by deeply informed perception , has come to us in our need with a more sublime beneficence than that of miracle - workers . Some of that twice - blessed mercy was always with Lydgate in his work at the Hospital or in private houses , serving better than any opiate to quiet and sustain him under his anxieties and his sense of mental degeneracy . Mr. Farebrother 's suspicion as to the opiate was true , however . Under the first galling pressure of foreseen difficulties , and the first perception that his marriage , if it were not to be a yoked loneliness , must be a state of effort to go on loving without too much care about being loved , he had once or twice tried a dose of opium . But he had no hereditary constitutional craving after such transient escapes from the hauntings of misery . He was strong , could drink a great deal of wine , but did not care about it ; and when the men round him were drinking spirits , he took sugar and water , having a contemptuous pity even for the earliest stages of excitement from drink . It was the same with gambling . He had looked on at a great deal of gambling in Paris , watching it as if it had been a disease . He was no more tempted by such winning than he was by drink . He had said to himself that the only winning he cared for must be attained by a conscious process of high , difficult combination tending towards a beneficent result . The power he longed for could not be represented by agitated fingers clutching a heap of coin , or by the half - barbarous , half - idiotic triumph in the eyes of a man who sweeps within his arms the ventures of twenty chapfallen companions . But just as he had tried opium , so his thought now began to turn upon gambling — not with appetite for its excitement , but with a sort of wistful inward gaze after that easy way of getting money , which implied no asking and brought no responsibility . If he had been in London or Paris at that time , it is probable that such thoughts , seconded by opportunity , would have taken him into a gambling - house , no longer to watch the gamblers , but to watch with them in kindred eagerness . Repugnance would have been surmounted by the immense need to win , if chance would be kind enough to let him . An incident which happened not very long after that airy notion of getting aid from his uncle had been excluded , was a strong sign of the effect that might have followed any extant opportunity of gambling . The billiard - room at the Green Dragon was the constant resort of a certain set , most of whom , like our acquaintance Mr. Bambridge , were regarded as men of pleasure . It was here that poor Fred Vincy had made part of his memorable debt , having lost money in betting , and been obliged to borrow of that gay companion . It was generally known in Middlemarch that a good deal of money was lost and won in this way ; and the consequent repute of the Green Dragon as a place of dissipation naturally heightened in some quarters the temptation to go there . Probably its regular visitants , like the initiates of freemasonry , wished that there were something a little more tremendous to keep to themselves concerning it ; but they were not a closed community , and many decent seniors as well as juniors occasionally turned into the billiard - room to see what was going on . Lydgate , who had the muscular aptitude for billiards , and was fond of the game , had once or twice in the early days after his arrival in Middlemarch taken his turn with the cue at the Green Dragon ; but afterwards he had no leisure for the game , and no inclination for the socialities there . One evening , however , he had occasion to seek Mr. Bambridge at that resort . The horsedealer had engaged to get him a customer for his remaining good horse , for which Lydgate had determined to substitute a cheap hack , hoping by this reduction of style to get perhaps twenty pounds ; and he cared now for every small sum , as a help towards feeding the patience of his tradesmen . To run up to the billiard - room , as he was passing , would save time . Mr. Bambridge was not yet come , but would be sure to arrive by - and - by , said his friend Mr. Horrock ; and Lydgate stayed , playing a game for the sake of passing the time . That evening he had the peculiar light in the eyes and the unusual vivacity which had been once noticed in him by Mr. Farebrother . The exceptional fact of his presence was much noticed in the room , where there was a good deal of Middlemarch company ; and several lookers - on , as well as some of the players , were betting with animation . Lydgate was playing well , and felt confident ; the bets were dropping round him , and with a swift glancing thought of the probable gain which might double the sum he was saving from his horse , he began to bet on his own play , and won again and again . Mr. Bambridge had come in , but Lydgate did not notice him . He was not only excited with his play , but visions were gleaming on him of going the next day to Brassing , where there was gambling on a grander scale to be had , and where , by one powerful snatch at the devil 's bait , he might carry it off without the hook , and buy his rescue from his daily solicitings . He was still winning when two new visitors entered . One of them was a young Hawley , just come from his law studies in town , and the other was Fred Vincy , who had spent several evenings of late at this old haunt of his . Young Hawley , an accomplished billiard - player , brought a cool fresh hand to the cue . But Fred Vincy , startled at seeing Lydgate , and astonished to see him betting with an excited air , stood aside , and kept out of the circle round the table . Fred had been rewarding resolution by a little laxity of late . He had been working heartily for six months at all outdoor occupations under Mr. Garth , and by dint of severe practice had nearly mastered the defects of his handwriting , this practice being , perhaps , a little the less severe that it was often carried on in the evening at Mr. Garth 's under the eyes of Mary . But the last fortnight Mary had been staying at Lowick Parsonage with the ladies there , during Mr. Farebrother 's residence in Middlemarch , where he was carrying out some parochial plans ; and Fred , not seeing anything more agreeable to do , had turned into the Green Dragon , partly to play at billiards , partly to taste the old flavour of discourse about horses , sport , and things in general , considered from a point of view which was not strenuously correct . He had not been out hunting once this season , had had no horse of his own to ride , and had gone from place to place chiefly with Mr. Garth in his gig , or on the sober cob which Mr. Garth could lend him . It was a little too bad , Fred began to think , that he should be kept in the traces with more severity than if he had been a clergyman . "
297380	297397	297401	297401	Hercules	411	" he had said , wishing her to appreciate what he went through for her sake ; "
297424	297872	297411	297411	They	5817	" And now , Mary being out of the way for a little while , Fred , like any other strong dog who can not slip his collar , had pulled up the staple of his chain and made a small escape , not of course meaning to go fast or far . There could be no reason why he should not play at billiards , but he was determined not to bet . As to money just now , Fred had in his mind the heroic project of saving almost all of the eighty pounds that Mr. Garth offered him , and returning it , which he could easily do by giving up all futile money - spending , since he had a superfluous stock of clothes , and no expense in his board . In that way he could , in one year , go a good way towards repaying the ninety pounds of which he had deprived Mrs. Garth , unhappily at a time when she needed that sum more than she did now . Nevertheless , it must be acknowledged that on this evening , which was the fifth of his recent visits to the billiard - room , Fred had , not in his pocket , but in his mind , the ten pounds which he meant to reserve for himself from his half - year 's salary ( having before him the pleasure of carrying thirty to Mrs. Garth when Mary was likely to be come home again)—he had those ten pounds in his mind as a fund from which he might risk something , if there were a chance of a good bet . Why ? Well , when sovereigns were flying about , why should n't he catch a few ? He would never go far along that road again ; but a man likes to assure himself , and men of pleasure generally , what he could do in the way of mischief if he chose , and that if he abstains from making himself ill , or beggaring himself , or talking with the utmost looseness which the narrow limits of human capacity will allow , it is not because he is a spooney . Fred did not enter into formal reasons , which are a very artificial , inexact way of representing the tingling returns of old habit , and the caprices of young blood : but there was lurking in him a prophetic sense that evening , that when he began to play he should also begin to bet — that he should enjoy some punch - drinking , and in general prepare himself for feeling "
297875	298409	297411	297411	They	5817	" in the morning . It is in such indefinable movements that action often begins . But the last thing likely to have entered Fred 's expectation was that he should see his brother - in - law Lydgate — of whom he had never quite dropped the old opinion that he was a prig , and tremendously conscious of his superiority — looking excited and betting , just as he himself might have done . Fred felt a shock greater than he could quite account for by the vague knowledge that Lydgate was in debt , and that his father had refused to help him ; and his own inclination to enter into the play was suddenly checked . It was a strange reversal of attitudes : Fred 's blond face and blue eyes , usually bright and careless , ready to give attention to anything that held out a promise of amusement , looking involuntarily grave and almost embarrassed as if by the sight of something unfitting ; while Lydgate , who had habitually an air of self - possessed strength , and a certain meditativeness that seemed to lie behind his most observant attention , was acting , watching , speaking with that excited narrow consciousness which reminds one of an animal with fierce eyes and retractile claws . Lydgate , by betting on his own strokes , had won sixteen pounds ; but young Hawley 's arrival had changed the poise of things . He made first - rate strokes himself , and began to bet against Lydgate 's strokes , the strain of whose nerves was thus changed from simple confidence in his own movements to defying another person 's doubt in them . The defiance was more exciting than the confidence , but it was less sure . He continued to bet on his own play , but began often to fail . Still he went on , for his mind was as utterly narrowed into that precipitous crevice of play as if he had been the most ignorant lounger there . Fred observed that Lydgate was losing fast , and found himself in the new situation of puzzling his brains to think of some device by which , without being offensive , he could withdraw Lydgate 's attention , and perhaps suggest to him a reason for quitting the room . He saw that others were observing Lydgate 's strange unlikeness to himself , and it occurred to him that merely to touch his elbow and call him aside for a moment might rouse him from his absorption . He could think of nothing cleverer than the daring improbability of saying that he wanted to see Rosy , and wished to know if she were at home this evening ; and he was going desperately to carry out this weak device , when a waiter came up to him with a message , saying that Mr. Farebrother was below , and begged to speak with him . Fred was surprised , not quite comfortably , but sending word that he would be down immediately , he went with a new impulse up to Lydgate , said , "
298418	298424	298411	298411	I	0	" and drew him aside . "
298466	298483	298458	298458	you	5818	" Fred had simply snatched up this pretext for speaking , because he could not say , "
298503	298541	298484	298484	You	5818	" But inspiration could hardly have served him better . Lydgate had not before seen that Fred was present , and his sudden appearance with an announcement of Mr. Farebrother had the effect of a sharp concussion . "
298546	298550	298484	298484	You	5818	" said Lydgate ; "
298580	298581	298578	298578	Bambridge	440	" "
298627	298716	298622	298622	you	335	" said Fred , with some adroitness . Lydgate felt shame , but could not bear to act as if he felt it , by refusing to see Mr. Farebrother ; and he went down . They merely shook hands , however , and spoke of the frost ; and when all three had turned into the street , the Vicar seemed quite willing to say good - by to Lydgate . His present purpose was clearly to talk with Fred alone , and he said , kindly , "
298744	298783	298742	298742	you	335	" It was a fine night , the sky thick with stars , and Mr. Farebrother proposed that they should make a circuit to the old church by the London road . The next thing he said was — "
298794	298795	298798	298798	I	0	" "
298800	298804	298798	298798	I	0	" said Fred . "
298815	298816	298806	298806	he	278	" "
298824	298841	298844	298844	he	278	" Fred had not meant to tell this , but he was obliged now to say , "
298864	298865	298860	298860	him	278	" "
298877	298878	298871	298871	yourself	0	" "
298887	298888	298871	298871	yourself	0	" "
298905	298906	298891	298891	you	0	" "
298915	298928	298909	298909	You	0	" said Fred , not liking to be catechised in this way . "
298937	298938	298929	298929	I	0	" "
298999	299000	299001	299001	I	0	" "
299013	299024	299010	299011	Mr. Farebrother	335	" said Fred , in a state of uncomfortable surmise . "
299131	299132	299133	299133	I	0	" "
299140	299146	299156	299156	my	0	" said Fred , hastily . "
299234	299278	299219	299219	you	0	" There was a pause . Mr. Farebrother seemed to wait for a recognition of the fact ; and the emotion perceptible in the tones of his fine voice gave solemnity to his words . But no feeling could quell Fred 's alarm . "
299289	299310	299279	299279	I	0	" he said , after a moment 's hesitation : it was not a case for any pretence of generosity . "
299423	299430	299415	299415	I	0	" repeated Mr. Farebrother , emphatically . "
299450	299506	299509	299509	I	0	" It seemed to Fred that if Mr. Farebrother had had a beak and talons instead of his very capable tongue , his mode of attack could hardly be more cruel . He had a horrible conviction that behind all this hypothetic statement there was a knowledge of some actual change in Mary 's feeling . "
299520	299529	299509	299509	I	0	" he said , in a troubled voice . "
299537	299562	299531	299531	she	5826	" He broke off , not liking to betray all he felt , and then said , by the help of a little bitterness , "
299572	299573	299566	299566	you	0	" "
299689	299759	299683	299683	you	0	" There was a pause , in which Fred was seized by a most uncomfortable chill . What was coming next ? He dreaded to hear that something had been said to Mary — he felt as if he were listening to a threat rather than a warning . When the Vicar began again there was a change in his tone like the encouraging transition to a major key . "
299856	299967	299851	299851	I	0	" There was a drop in the Vicar 's voice when he spoke the last words . He paused — they were standing on a patch of green where the road diverged towards St. Botolph 's , and he put out his hand , as if to imply that the conversation was closed . Fred was moved quite newly . Some one highly susceptible to the contemplation of a fine act has said , that it produces a sort of regenerating shudder through the frame , and makes one feel ready to begin a new life . A good degree of that effect was just then present in Fred Vincy . "
299975	299985	300023	300023	her	5830	" he said , breaking off before he could say "
299994	300008	300009	300009	You	282	" And meanwhile Mr. Farebrother had gathered the impulse to say something more . "
300048	300049	300050	300050	I	0	" "
300059	300063	300050	300050	I	0	" Fred answered . "
300087	300088	300075	300075	I	0	" "
300102	300139	300098	300098	God	274	" In that way they parted . But both of them walked about a long while before they went out of the starlight . Much of Fred 's rumination might be summed up in the words , "
300167	300184	300156	300156	she	5830	" Perhaps Mr. Farebrother 's might be concentrated into a single shrug and one little speech . "
300225	300754	300755	300755	Papa	254	" Happily Lydgate had ended by losing in the billiard - room , and brought away no encouragement to make a raid on luck . On the contrary , he felt unmixed disgust with himself the next day when he had to pay four or five pounds over and above his gains , and he carried about with him a most unpleasant vision of the figure he had made , not only rubbing elbows with the men at the Green Dragon but behaving just as they did . A philosopher fallen to betting is hardly distinguishable from a Philistine under the same circumstances : the difference will chiefly be found in his subsequent reflections , and Lydgate chewed a very disagreeable cud in that way . His reason told him how the affair might have been magnified into ruin by a slight change of scenery — if it had been a gambling - house that he had turned into , where chance could be clutched with both hands instead of being picked up with thumb and fore - finger . Nevertheless , though reason strangled the desire to gamble , there remained the feeling that , with an assurance of luck to the needful amount , he would have liked to gamble , rather than take the alternative which was beginning to urge itself as inevitable . That alternative was to apply to Mr. Bulstrode . Lydgate had so many times boasted both to himself and others that he was totally independent of Bulstrode , to whose plans he had lent himself solely because they enabled him to carry out his own ideas of professional work and public benefit — he had so constantly in their personal intercourse had his pride sustained by the sense that he was making a good social use of this predominating banker , whose opinions he thought contemptible and whose motives often seemed to him an absurd mixture of contradictory impressions — that he had been creating for himself strong ideal obstacles to the proffering of any considerable request to him on his own account . Still , early in March his affairs were at that pass in which men begin to say that their oaths were delivered in ignorance , and to perceive that the act which they had called impossible to them is becoming manifestly possible . With Dover 's ugly security soon to be put in force , with the proceeds of his practice immediately absorbed in paying back debts , and with the chance , if the worst were known , of daily supplies being refused on credit , above all with the vision of Rosamond 's hopeless discontent continually haunting him , Lydgate had begun to see that he should inevitably bend himself to ask help from somebody or other . At first he had considered whether he should write to Mr. Vincy ; but on questioning Rosamond he found that , as he had suspected , she had already applied twice to her father , the last time being since the disappointment from Sir Godwin ; and papa had said that Lydgate must look out for himself . "
300816	301073	300800	300800	He	254	" Indeed , Lydgate himself had come to the conclusion that if he must end by asking for a free loan , his relations with Bulstrode , more at least than with any other man , might take the shape of a claim which was not purely personal . Bulstrode had indirectly helped to cause the failure of his practice , and had also been highly gratified by getting a medical partner in his plans:—but who among us ever reduced himself to the sort of dependence in which Lydgate now stood , without trying to believe that he had claims which diminished the humiliation of asking ? It was true that of late there had seemed to be a new languor of interest in Bulstrode about the Hospital ; but his health had got worse , and showed signs of a deep - seated nervous affection . In other respects he did not appear to be changed : he had always been highly polite , but Lydgate had observed in him from the first a marked coldness about his marriage and other private circumstances , a coldness which he had hitherto preferred to any warmth of familiarity between them . He deferred the intention from day to day , his habit of acting on his conclusions being made infirm by his repugnance to every possible conclusion and its consequent act . He saw Mr. Bulstrode often , but he did not try to use any occasion for his private purpose . At one moment he thought , "
301088	301094	301080	301080	I	0	" at another he thought , "
301115	301202	301203	301204	any man	2652	" Still the days passed and no letter was written , no special interview sought . In his shrinking from the humiliation of a dependent attitude towards Bulstrode , he began to familiarize his imagination with another step even more unlike his remembered self . He began spontaneously to consider whether it would be possible to carry out that puerile notion of Rosamond 's which had often made him angry , namely , that they should quit Middlemarch without seeing anything beyond that preface . The question came—"Would
301234	301587	301588	301588	One	870	" But against his taking this step , which he still felt to be a contemptible relinquishment of present work , a guilty turning aside from what was a real and might be a widening channel for worthy activity , to start again without any justified destination , there was this obstacle , that the purchaser , if procurable at all , might not be quickly forthcoming . And afterwards ? Rosamond in a poor lodging , though in the largest city or most distant town , would not find the life that could save her from gloom , and save him from the reproach of having plunged her into it . For when a man is at the foot of the hill in his fortunes , he may stay a long while there in spite of professional accomplishment . In the British climate there is no incompatibility between scientific insight and furnished lodgings : the incompatibility is chiefly between scientific ambition and a wife who objects to that kind of residence . But in the midst of his hesitation , opportunity came to decide him . A note from Mr. Bulstrode requested Lydgate to call on him at the Bank . A hypochondriacal tendency had shown itself in the banker 's constitution of late ; and a lack of sleep , which was really only a slight exaggeration of an habitual dyspeptic symptom , had been dwelt on by him as a sign of threatening insanity . He wanted to consult Lydgate without delay on that particular morning , although he had nothing to tell beyond what he had told before . He listened eagerly to what Lydgate had to say in dissipation of his fears , though this too was only repetition ; and this moment in which Bulstrode was receiving a medical opinion with a sense of comfort , seemed to make the communication of a personal need to him easier than it had been in Lydgate 's contemplation beforehand . He had been insisting that it would be well for Mr. Bulstrode to relax his attention to business . "
301604	301626	301203	301204	any man	2652	" said Lydgate at that stage of the consultation when the remarks tend to pass from the personal to the general , "
301664	301665	301666	301666	I	0	" "
301718	301739	301740	301740	You	5844	" said Mr. Bulstrode , not intending to evade Lydgate 's allusion , but really preoccupied with alarms about himself . "
301768	301823	301746	301746	your	5844	" said Lydgate , with a strong distaste for the broken metaphor and bad logic of the banker 's religion , somewhat increased by the apparent deafness of his sympathy . But his mind had taken up its long - prepared movement towards getting help , and was not yet arrested . He added , "
301865	301866	301883	301883	you	5844	" "
301869	301878	301883	301883	you	5844	" said Mr. Bulstrode , with some coldness . "
301985	301986	301981	301981	you	5844	" "
301990	302018	301981	301981	you	5844	" said Lydgate , falling backward in his chair , with ill - repressed impatience under the banker 's pale earnest eyes and intense preoccupation with himself . "
302039	302043	302019	302019	I	0	" continued Bulstrode . "
302149	302165	302166	302166	He	0	" Lydgate 's thought , when Bulstrode paused according to his wo nt , was , "
302177	302203	302166	302166	He	0	" This was the most plausible explanation of a speech which had caused rather a startling change in his expectations . He said in reply — "
302218	302219	302215	302215	I	0	" "
302222	302234	302215	302215	I	0	" returned Bulstrode , in the same deliberate , silvery tone ; "
302310	302320	302323	302323	I	0	" Another pause , but Lydgate did not speak . "
302403	302425	302475	302478	the other medical men	8956	" Mr. Bulstrode had lowered his eyes from Lydgate 's face to the buttons of his coat as he again paused . "
302439	302452	302475	302478	the other medical men	8956	" said Lydgate , with an edge of irony in his tone . "
302495	302496	302497	302497	I	0	" "
302558	302617	302555	302555	I	0	" Bulstrode showed a rather exasperating ability in this conversation . The broken metaphor and bad logic of motive which had stirred his hearer 's contempt were quite consistent with a mode of putting the facts which made it difficult for Lydgate to vent his own indignation and disappointment . After some rapid reflection , he only asked — "
302624	302625	302620	302621	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" "
302639	302651	302632	302632	I	0	" said Bulstrode , who had thoroughly prepared his ministerial explanation . "
302765	302772	302740	302740	I	0	" Lydgate was ready to say , "
302790	302809	302810	302810	I	0	" But there was still a weight on his mind which arrested this cheerful candor . He replied , "
302826	302827	302833	302833	she	276	" "
302877	302891	302900	302900	she	276	" said Mr. Bulstrode , drawing it out , and reading from it . "
302969	303032	302957	302957	I	0	" Mr. Bulstrode returned the letter to his side - pocket , and changed his attitude as if his business were closed . Lydgate , whose renewed hope about the Hospital only made him more conscious of the facts which poisoned his hope , felt that his effort after help , if made at all , must be made now and vigorously . "
303045	303071	303038	303038	you	278	" he said , with a firm intention in his tone , yet with an interruptedness in his delivery which showed that he spoke unwillingly . "
303172	303207	303208	303208	I	0	" Lydgate waited a little , but Bulstrode only bowed , looking at him fixedly , and he went on with the same interrupted enunciation — as if he were biting an objectional leek . "
303393	303424	303425	303425	I	0	" Lydgate hated to hear himself . But he had spoken now , and had spoken with unmistakable directness . Mr. Bulstrode replied without haste , but also without hesitation . "
303519	303520	303486	303486	My	0	" "
303528	303537	303486	303486	My	0	" said Lydgate , rising and speaking bitterly , "
303549	303550	303486	303486	My	0	" "
303557	303562	303486	303486	My	0	" said Mr. Bulstrode ; "
303592	303593	303581	303581	I	0	" "
303597	303608	303595	303595	you	0	" said Lydgate , not quite knowing what he said . "
303620	304503	304504	304504	I	0	" That change of plan and shifting of interest which Bulstrode stated or betrayed in his conversation with Lydgate , had been determined in him by some severe experience which he had gone through since the epoch of Mr. Larcher 's sale , when Raffles had recognized Will Ladislaw , and when the banker had in vain attempted an act of restitution which might move Divine Providence to arrest painful consequences . His certainty that Raffles , unless he were dead , would return to Middlemarch before long , had been justified . On Christmas Eve he had reappeared at The Shrubs . Bulstrode was at home to receive him , and hinder his communication with the rest of the family , but he could not altogether hinder the circumstances of the visit from compromising himself and alarming his wife . Raffles proved more unmanageable than he had shown himself to be in his former appearances , his chronic state of mental restlessness , the growing effect of habitual intemperance , quickly shaking off every impression from what was said to him . He insisted on staying in the house , and Bulstrode , weighing two sets of evils , felt that this was at least not a worse alternative than his going into the town . He kept him in his own room for the evening and saw him to bed , Raffles all the while amusing himself with the annoyance he was causing this decent and highly prosperous fellow - sinner , an amusement which he facetiously expressed as sympathy with his friend 's pleasure in entertaining a man who had been serviceable to him , and who had not had all his earnings . There was a cunning calculation under this noisy joking — a cool resolve to extract something the handsomer from Bulstrode as payment for release from this new application of torture . But his cunning had a little overcast its mark . Bulstrode was indeed more tortured than the coarse fibre of Raffles could enable him to imagine . He had told his wife that he was simply taking care of this wretched creature , the victim of vice , who might otherwise injure himself ; he implied , without the direct form of falsehood , that there was a family tie which bound him to this care , and that there were signs of mental alienation in Raffles which urged caution . He would himself drive the unfortunate being away the next morning . In these hints he felt that he was supplying Mrs. Bulstrode with precautionary information for his daughters and servants , and accounting for his allowing no one but himself to enter the room even with food and drink . But he sat in an agony of fear lest Raffles should be overheard in his loud and plain references to past facts — lest Mrs. Bulstrode should be even tempted to listen at the door . How could he hinder her , how betray his terror by opening the door to detect her ? She was a woman of honest direct habits , and little likely to take so low a course in order to arrive at painful knowledge ; but fear was stronger than the calculation of probabilities . In this way Raffles had pushed the torture too far , and produced an effect which had not been in his plan . By showing himself hopelessly unmanageable he had made Bulstrode feel that a strong defiance was the only resource left . After taking Raffles to bed that night the banker ordered his closed carriage to be ready at half - past seven the next morning . At six o'clock he had already been long dressed , and had spent some of his wretchedness in prayer , pleading his motives for averting the worst evil if in anything he had used falsity and spoken what was not true before God . For Bulstrode shrank from a direct lie with an intensity disproportionate to the number of his more indirect misdeeds . But many of these misdeeds were like the subtle muscular movements which are not taken account of in the consciousness , though they bring about the end that we fix our mind on and desire . And it is only what we are vividly conscious of that we can vividly imagine to be seen by Omniscience . Bulstrode carried his candle to the bedside of Raffles , who was apparently in a painful dream . He stood silent , hoping that the presence of the light would serve to waken the sleeper gradually and gently , for he feared some noise as the consequence of a too sudden awakening . He had watched for a couple of minutes or more the shudderings and pantings which seemed likely to end in waking , when Raffles , with a long half - stifled moan , started up and stared round him in terror , trembling and gasping . But he made no further noise , and Bulstrode , setting down the candle , awaited his recovery . It was a quarter of an hour later before Bulstrode , with a cold peremptoriness of manner which he had not before shown , said , "
304553	304569	304532	304532	myself	0	" Raffles was about to speak , but Bulstrode anticipated him imperiously with the words , "
304752	305883	305908	305908	you	0	" Bulstrode had rarely in his life spoken with such nervous energy : he had been deliberating on this speech and its probable effects through a large part of the night ; and though he did not trust to its ultimately saving him from any return of Raffles , he had concluded that it was the best throw he could make . It succeeded in enforcing submission from the jaded man this morning : his empoisoned system at this moment quailed before Bulstrode 's cold , resolute bearing , and he was taken off quietly in the carriage before the family breakfast time . The servants imagined him to be a poor relation , and were not surprised that a strict man like their master , who held his head high in the world , should be ashamed of such a cousin and want to get rid of him . The banker 's drive of ten miles with his hated companion was a dreary beginning of the Christmas day ; but at the end of the drive , Raffles had recovered his spirits , and parted in a contentment for which there was the good reason that the banker had given him a hundred pounds . Various motives urged Bulstrode to this open - handedness , but he did not himself inquire closely into all of them . As he had stood watching Raffles in his uneasy sleep , it had certainly entered his mind that the man had been much shattered since the first gift of two hundred pounds . He had taken care to repeat the incisive statement of his resolve not to be played on any more ; and had tried to penetrate Raffles with the fact that he had shown the risks of bribing him to be quite equal to the risks of defying him . But when , freed from his repulsive presence , Bulstrode returned to his quiet home , he brought with him no confidence that he had secured more than a respite . It was as if he had had a loathsome dream , and could not shake off its images with their hateful kindred of sensations — as if on all the pleasant surroundings of his life a dangerous reptile had left his slimy traces . Who can know how much of his most inward life is made up of the thoughts he believes other men to have about him , until that fabric of opinion is threatened with ruin ? Bulstrode was only the more conscious that there was a deposit of uneasy presentiment in his wife 's mind , because she carefully avoided any allusion to it . He had been used every day to taste the flavour of supremacy and the tribute of complete deference : and the certainty that he was watched or measured with a hidden suspicion of his having some discreditable secret , made his voice totter when he was speaking to edification . Foreseeing , to men of Bulstrode 's anxious temperament , is often worse than seeing ; and his imagination continually heightened the anguish of an imminent disgrace . Yes , imminent ; for if his defiance of Raffles did not keep the man away — and though he prayed for this result he hardly hoped for it — the disgrace was certain . In vain he said to himself that , if permitted , it would be a divine visitation , a chastisement , a preparation ; he recoiled from the imagined burning ; and he judged that it must be more for the Divine glory that he should escape dishonour . That recoil had at last urged him to make preparations for quitting Middlemarch . If evil truth must be reported of him , he would then be at a less scorching distance from the contempt of his old neighbors ; and in a new scene , where his life would not have gathered the same wide sensibility , the tormentor , if he pursued him , would be less formidable . To leave the place finally would , he knew , be extremely painful to his wife , and on other grounds he would have preferred to stay where he had struck root . Hence he made his preparations at first in a conditional way , wishing to leave on all sides an opening for his return after brief absence , if any favourable intervention of Providence should dissipate his fears . He was preparing to transfer his management of the Bank , and to give up any active control of other commercial affairs in the neighborhood , on the ground of his failing health , but without excluding his future resumption of such work . The measure would cause him some added expense and some diminution of income beyond what he had already undergone from the general depression of trade ; and the Hospital presented itself as a principal object of outlay on which he could fairly economize . This was the experience which had determined his conversation with Lydgate . But at this time his arrangements had most of them gone no farther than a stage at which he could recall them if they proved to be unnecessary . He continually deferred the final steps ; in the midst of his fears , like many a man who is in danger of shipwreck or of being dashed from his carriage by runaway horses , he had a clinging impression that something would happen to hinder the worst , and that to spoil his life by a late transplantation might be over - hasty — especially since it was difficult to account satisfactorily to his wife for the project of their indefinite exile from the only place where she would like to live . Among the affairs Bulstrode had to care for , was the management of the farm at Stone Court in case of his absence ; and on this as well as on all other matters connected with any houses and land he possessed in or about Middlemarch , he had consulted Caleb Garth . Like every one else who had business of that sort , he wanted to get the agent who was more anxious for his employer 's interests than his own . With regard to Stone Court , since Bulstrode wished to retain his hold on the stock , and to have an arrangement by which he himself could , if he chose , resume his favourite recreation of superintendence , Caleb had advised him not to trust to a mere bailiff , but to let the land , stock , and implements yearly , and take a proportionate share of the proceeds . "
305901	305905	305898	305899	Mr. Garth	442	" said Bulstrode . "
305929	305930	305931	305931	I	0	" "
305937	305946	305931	305931	I	0	" said Caleb , in his blunt way . "
305957	306116	306117	306118	The lad	1906	" If it had not been that he had to consider Fred Vincy 's future , Mr. Garth would not probably have been glad of any addition to his work , of which his wife was always fearing an excess for him as he grew older . But on quitting Bulstrode after that conversation , a very alluring idea occurred to him about this said letting of Stone Court . What if Bulstrode would agree to his placing Fred Vincy there on the understanding that he , Caleb Garth , should be responsible for the management ? It would be an excellent schooling for Fred ; he might make a modest income there , and still have time left to get knowledge by helping in other business . He mentioned his notion to Mrs. Garth with such evident delight that she could not bear to chill his pleasure by expressing her constant fear of his undertaking too much . "
306126	306141	306117	306118	The lad	1906	" he said , throwing himself back in his chair , and looking radiant , "
306274	306275	306272	306272	Susan	379	" "
306300	306312	306289	306289	you	0	" said Mrs. Garth , in a tone of gentle caution . "
306330	306331	306318	306318	Caleb	441	" "
306339	306348	306318	306318	Caleb	441	" said Caleb , swinging his head aside . "
306388	306542	306381	306381	I	0	" He took his earliest opportunity of doing so . Bulstrode had anything but a warm interest in his nephew Fred Vincy , but he had a strong wish to secure Mr. Garth 's services on many scattered points of business at which he was sure to be a considerable loser , if they were under less conscientious management . On that ground he made no objection to Mr. Garth 's proposal ; and there was also another reason why he was not sorry to give a consent which was to benefit one of the Vincy family . It was that Mrs. Bulstrode , having heard of Lydgate 's debts , had been anxious to know whether her husband could not do something for poor Rosamond , and had been much troubled on learning from him that Lydgate 's affairs were not easily remediable , and that the wisest plan was to let them "
306547	306558	306381	306381	I	0	" Mrs. Bulstrode had then said for the first time , "
306607	306608	306609	306609	My	0	" "
306613	306631	306609	306609	My	0	" said Mr. Bulstrode , wincing under his wife 's eyes , which were filling with tears , "
306657	306817	306644	306644	I	0	" That seemed to be true , and Mrs. Bulstrode 's remonstrance subsided into pity for poor Rosamond , whose extravagant education she had always foreseen the fruits of . But remembering that dialogue , Mr. Bulstrode felt that when he had to talk to his wife fully about his plan of quitting Middlemarch , he should be glad to tell her that he had made an arrangement which might be for the good of her nephew Fred . At present he had merely mentioned to her that he thought of shutting up The Shrubs for a few months , and taking a house on the Southern Coast . Hence Mr. Garth got the assurance he desired , namely , that in case of Bulstrode 's departure from Middlemarch for an indefinite time , Fred Vincy should be allowed to have the tenancy of Stone Court on the terms proposed . Caleb was so elated with his hope of this "
306820	306852	306644	306644	I	0	" being given to things , that if his self - control had not been braced by a little affectionate wifely scolding , he would have betrayed everything to Mary , wanting "
306859	306956	306644	306644	I	0	" However , he restrained himself , and kept in strict privacy from Fred certain visits which he was making to Stone Court , in order to look more thoroughly into the state of the land and stock , and take a preliminary estimate . He was certainly more eager in these visits than the probable speed of events required him to be ; but he was stimulated by a fatherly delight in occupying his mind with this bit of probable happiness which he held in store like a hidden birthday gift for Fred and Mary . "
306973	306978	306644	306644	I	0	" said Mrs. Garth . "
306983	306987	306644	306644	I	0	" replied Caleb ; "
306997	307053	306644	306644	I	0	" Mr. Bulstrode was still seated in his manager 's room at the Bank , about three o'clock of the same day on which he had received Lydgate there , when the clerk entered to say that his horse was waiting , and also that Mr. Garth was outside and begged to speak with him . "
307058	307066	306644	306644	I	0	" said Bulstrode ; and Caleb entered . "
307074	307084	307071	307072	Mr. Garth	442	" continued the banker , in his suavest tone . "
307106	307107	307101	307101	you	442	" "
307110	307314	307101	307101	you	442	" said Caleb , gently , with a slow swing of his head on one side , as he seated himself and laid his hat on the floor . He looked at the ground , leaning forward and letting his long fingers droop between his legs , while each finger moved in succession , as if it were sharing some thought which filled his large quiet brow . Mr. Bulstrode , like every one else who knew Caleb , was used to his slowness in beginning to speak on any topic which he felt to be important , and rather expected that he was about to recur to the buying of some houses in Blindman 's Court , for the sake of pulling them down , as a sacrifice of property which would be well repaid by the influx of air and light on that spot . It was by propositions of this kind that Caleb was sometimes troublesome to his employers ; but he had usually found Bulstrode ready to meet him in projects of improvement , and they had got on well together . When he spoke again , however , it was to say , in rather a subdued voice — "
307327	307328	307324	307325	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" "
307338	307343	307335	307335	I	0	" said the banker ; "
307360	307361	307350	307350	Abel	758	" "
307366	307374	307335	307335	I	0	" said Caleb , looking up gravely , "
307410	307452	307408	307408	Raffles	597	" He saw the shock of his words passing through Bulstrode 's frame . On this subject the banker had thought that his fears were too constantly on the watch to be taken by surprise ; but he had been mistaken . "
307456	307471	307408	307408	Raffles	597	" he said in a compassionate tone , though his lips trembled a little . "
307480	307481	307473	307473	you	0	" "
307487	307491	307408	307408	Raffles	597	" said Caleb , quietly—"took
307584	307604	307573	307573	you	0	" Caleb took up his hat from the floor as he ended , and rose slowly from his seat . "
307607	307620	307573	307573	you	0	" said Bulstrode , whose mind was very active at this moment . "
307681	307735	307737	307737	Raffles	597	" Bulstrode quickly wrote a note , and went out himself to give the commission to his man . When he returned , Caleb was standing as before with one hand on the back of the chair , holding his hat with the other . In Bulstrode 's mind the dominant thought was , "
307788	307820	307774	307774	he	442	" He longed for some confirmation of this hopeful conjecture , but to have asked any question as to what Raffles had said or done would have been to betray fear . "
307831	307842	307828	307829	Mr. Garth	442	" he said , in his usual tone of politeness . "
307886	307887	307889	307889	you	442	" "
307891	307908	307889	307889	you	442	" said Caleb , making a slight gesture with his right hand to waive the invitation . "
307965	307978	307959	307959	I	0	" A sharp certainty entered like a stab into Bulstrode 's soul . "
307986	307995	307983	307984	Mr. Garth	442	" was all he could say at first . "
307999	308003	307983	307984	Mr. Garth	442	" said Caleb ; "
308016	308089	308090	308090	You	274	" He spoke with a firmness which was very gentle , and yet he could see that Bulstrode seemed to cower under that gentleness , his face looking dried and his eyes swerving away from the glance which rested on him . Caleb felt a deep pity for him , but he could have used no pretexts to account for his resolve , even if they would have been of any use . "
308111	308122	308107	308109	that unhappy creature	5936	" said Bulstrode , anxious now to know the utmost . "
308141	308142	308127	308127	I	0	" "
308181	308199	308165	308165	You	274	" said Bulstrode , casting about for pleas that might be adapted to his hearer 's mind . "
308221	308222	308213	308213	I	0	" "
308234	308238	308223	308223	I	0	" said Caleb ; "
308309	308310	308300	308300	I	0	" "
308351	308375	308342	308342	I	0	" said Bulstrode , a certain amount of anger beginning to mingle with his humiliation before this quiet man who renounced his benefits . "
308380	308412	308342	308342	I	0	" said Caleb , waving his hand , bowing his head slightly , and not swerving from the tone which had in it the merciful intention to spare this pitiable man . "
308483	308490	308494	308494	me	0	thing"—Caleb paused a moment and shook his head—"it
308503	308504	308494	308494	me	0	" "
308517	308528	308529	308529	You	0	" said Bulstrode constrained into a genuine , pleading cry . "
308542	308543	308537	308537	your	6934	" "
308551	308564	308545	308545	I	0	" said Caleb , still more gently , lifting up his hand . "
308685	308686	308678	308678	I	0	" "
308693	308699	308690	308691	Mr. Garth	442	" said Bulstrode , hurriedly . "
308737	308750	308705	308705	your	442	" Caleb 's wrath was stirred , and he said , indignantly — "
308782	308783	308785	308785	me	0	" "
308800	308801	308793	308798	the victim of this abandoned man	5950	" "
308828	308829	308822	308822	you	6934	" "
308840	308886	308830	308830	You	6934	" said Bulstrode , oppressed , as by a nightmare , with the inability to deny flatly what Raffles might have said ; and yet feeling it an escape that Caleb had not so stated it to him as to ask for that flat denial . "
308889	308898	308899	308899	I	0	" said Caleb , lifting his hand deprecatingly ; "
308976	309031	309041	309041	he	846	" Some hours later , when he was at home , Caleb said to his wife , incidentally , that he had had some little differences with Bulstrode , and that in consequence , he had given up all notion of taking Stone Court , and indeed had resigned doing further business for him . "
309043	309078	309041	309041	he	846	" said Mrs. Garth , imagining that her husband had been touched on his sensitive point , and not been allowed to do what he thought right as to materials and modes of work . "
309081	309370	309041	309041	he	846	" said Caleb , bowing his head and waving his hand gravely . And Mrs. Garth knew that this was a sign of his not intending to speak further on the subject . As for Bulstrode , he had almost immediately mounted his horse and set off for Stone Court , being anxious to arrive there before Lydgate . His mind was crowded with images and conjectures , which were a language to his hopes and fears , just as we hear tones from the vibrations which shake our whole system . The deep humiliation with which he had winced under Caleb Garth 's knowledge of his past and rejection of his patronage , alternated with and almost gave way to the sense of safety in the fact that Garth , and no other , had been the man to whom Raffles had spoken . It seemed to him a sort of earnest that Providence intended his rescue from worse consequences ; the way being thus left open for the hope of secrecy . That Raffles should be afflicted with illness , that he should have been led to Stone Court rather than elsewhere — Bulstrode 's heart fluttered at the vision of probabilities which these events conjured up . If it should turn out that he was freed from all danger of disgrace — if he could breathe in perfect liberty — his life should be more consecrated than it had ever been before . He mentally lifted up this vow as if it would urge the result he longed for — he tried to believe in the potency of that prayerful resolution — its potency to determine death . He knew that he ought to say , "
309376	309753	309371	309371	Thy	5954	" and he said it often . But the intense desire remained that the will of God might be the death of that hated man . Yet when he arrived at Stone Court he could not see the change in Raffles without a shock . But for his pallor and feebleness , Bulstrode would have called the change in him entirely mental . Instead of his loud tormenting mood , he showed an intense , vague terror , and seemed to deprecate Bulstrode 's anger , because the money was all gone — he had been robbed — it had half of it been taken from him . He had only come here because he was ill and somebody was hunting him — somebody was after him , he had told nobody anything , he had kept his mouth shut . Bulstrode , not knowing the significance of these symptoms , interpreted this new nervous susceptibility into a means of alarming Raffles into true confessions , and taxed him with falsehood in saying that he had not told anything , since he had just told the man who took him up in his gig and brought him to Stone Court . Raffles denied this with solemn adjurations ; the fact being that the links of consciousness were interrupted in him , and that his minute terror - stricken narrative to Caleb Garth had been delivered under a set of visionary impulses which had dropped back into darkness . Bulstrode 's heart sank again at this sign that he could get no grasp over the wretched man 's mind , and that no word of Raffles could be trusted as to the fact which he most wanted to know , namely , whether or not he had really kept silence to every one in the neighborhood except Caleb Garth . The housekeeper had told him without the least constraint of manner that since Mr. Garth left , Raffles had asked her for beer , and after that had not spoken , seeming very ill . On that side it might be concluded that there had been no betrayal . Mrs. Abel thought , like the servants at The Shrubs , that the strange man belonged to the unpleasant "
309755	309800	309882	309883	Mr. Lydgate	278	" who are among the troubles of the rich ; she had at first referred the kinship to Mr. Rigg , and where there was property left , the buzzing presence of such large blue - bottles seemed natural enough . How he could be "
309802	309822	309371	309371	Thy	5954	" to Bulstrode as well was not so clear , but Mrs. Abel agreed with her husband that there was "
309826	309875	309371	309371	Thy	5954	" a proposition which had a great deal of mental food for her , so that she shook her head over it without further speculation . In less than an hour Lydgate arrived . Bulstrode met him outside the wainscoted parlor , where Raffles was , and said — "
309971	310020	309961	309961	I	0	" Lydgate , who had the remembrance of his last conversation with Bulstrode strongly upon him , was not disposed to say an unnecessary word to him , and bowed slightly in answer to this account ; but just before entering the room he turned automatically and said , "
310024	310045	310023	310023	his	5956	name?"—to know names being as much a part of the medical man 's accomplishment as of the practical politician 's . "
310051	310111	310023	310023	his	5956	" said Bulstrode , who hoped that whatever became of Raffles , Lydgate would never know any more of him . When he had thoroughly examined and considered the patient , Lydgate ordered that he should go to bed , and be kept there in as complete quiet as possible , and then went with Bulstrode into another room . "
310121	310132	310118	310118	I	0	" said the banker , before Lydgate began to speak . "
310138	310145	310118	310118	I	0	" said Lydgate , half dubiously . "
310203	310204	310205	310205	I	0	" "
310211	310215	310216	310217	Mrs. Abel	758	" said Bulstrode . "
310246	310247	310243	310244	Mrs. Bulstrode	312	" "
310256	310260	310248	310248	I	0	" said Lydgate . "
310285	310286	310277	310278	a man	846	" "
310303	310309	310287	310287	I	0	" said Bulstrode , indifferently ; "
310333	310334	310322	310323	her husband	963	" "
310348	310362	310339	310339	I	0	" said Lydgate , not feeling surprised at a little peculiarity in Bulstrode . "
310374	310386	310363	310363	You	0	" said Bulstrode , when Lydgate had ended giving his orders . "
310407	310411	310398	310398	I	0	" said Lydgate . "
310501	310617	310492	310492	I	0	" After waiting for the note to be carried to Mrs. Bulstrode , Lydgate rode away , forming no conjectures , in the first instance , about the history of Raffles , but rehearsing the whole argument , which had lately been much stirred by the publication of Dr. Ware 's abundant experience in America , as to the right way of treating cases of alcoholic poisoning such as this . Lydgate , when abroad , had already been interested in this question : he was strongly convinced against the prevalent practice of allowing alcohol and persistently administering large doses of opium ; and he had repeatedly acted on this conviction with a favourable result . "
310626	310630	310492	310492	I	0	" he thought , "
310737	311215	310723	310723	he	6995	" This streak of bitterness came from a plenteous source , and kept widening in the current of his thought as he neared Lowick Gate . He had not been there since his first interview with Bulstrode in the morning , having been found at the Hospital by the banker 's messenger ; and for the first time he was returning to his home without the vision of any expedient in the background which left him a hope of raising money enough to deliver him from the coming destitution of everything which made his married life tolerable — everything which saved him and Rosamond from that bare isolation in which they would be forced to recognize how little of a comfort they could be to each other . It was more bearable to do without tenderness for himself than to see that his own tenderness could make no amends for the lack of other things to her . The sufferings of his own pride from humiliations past and to come were keen enough , yet they were hardly distinguishable to himself from that more acute pain which dominated them — the pain of foreseeing that Rosamond would come to regard him chiefly as the cause of disappointment and unhappiness to her . He had never liked the makeshifts of poverty , and they had never before entered into his prospects for himself ; but he was beginning now to imagine how two creatures who loved each other , and had a stock of thoughts in common , might laugh over their shabby furniture , and their calculations how far they could afford butter and eggs . But the glimpse of that poetry seemed as far off from him as the carelessness of the golden age ; in poor Rosamond 's mind there was not room enough for luxuries to look small in . He got down from his horse in a very sad mood , and went into the house , not expecting to be cheered except by his dinner , and reflecting that before the evening closed it would be wise to tell Rosamond of his application to Bulstrode and its failure . It would be well not to lose time in preparing her for the worst . But his dinner waited long for him before he was able to eat it . For on entering he found that Dover 's agent had already put a man in the house , and when he asked where Mrs. Lydgate was , he was told that she was in her bedroom . He went up and found her stretched on the bed pale and silent , without an answer even in her face to any word or look of his . He sat down by the bed and leaning over her said with almost a cry of prayer — "
311233	311390	311392	311392	you	5978	" She looked at him silently , still with the blank despair on her face ; but then the tears began to fill her blue eyes , and her lip trembled . The strong man had had too much to bear that day . He let his head fall beside hers and sobbed . He did not hinder her from going to her father early in the morning — it seemed now that he ought not to hinder her from doing as she pleased . In half an hour she came back , and said that papa and mamma wished her to go and stay with them while things were in this miserable state . Papa said he could do nothing about the debt — if he paid this , there would be half - a - dozen more . She had better come back home again till Lydgate had got a comfortable home for her . "
311397	311398	311392	311392	you	5978	" "
311404	311408	311401	311401	you	5978	" said Lydgate . "
311424	311425	311426	311426	I	0	" "
311435	311439	311426	311426	I	0	" said Rosamond ; "
311448	311449	311426	311426	I	0	" "
311471	311479	311480	311480	I	0	" said Lydgate , with bitter irony . "
311496	311566	311567	311567	I	0	" It was Lydgate 's misfortune and Rosamond 's too , that his tenderness towards her , which was both an emotional prompting and a well - considered resolve , was inevitably interrupted by these outbursts of indignation either ironical or remonstrant . She thought them totally unwarranted , and the repulsion which this exceptional severity excited in her was in danger of making the more persistent tenderness unacceptable . "
311577	311585	311603	311603	you	5978	" she said , with chill mildness ; "
311610	312969	312972	312972	you	5979	" Lydgate said no more , but went out on his rounds . He felt bruised and shattered , and there was a dark line under his eyes which Rosamond had not seen before . She could not bear to look at him . Tertius had a way of taking things which made them a great deal worse for her . Bulstrode 's first object after Lydgate had left Stone Court was to examine Raffles 's pockets , which he imagined were sure to carry signs in the shape of hotel - bills of the places he had stopped in , if he had not told the truth in saying that he had come straight from Liverpool because he was ill and had no money . There were various bills crammed into his pocketbook , but none of a later date than Christmas at any other place , except one , which bore date that morning . This was crumpled up with a hand - bill about a horse - fair in one of his tail - pockets , and represented the cost of three days ' stay at an inn at Bilkley , where the fair was held — a town at least forty miles from Middlemarch . The bill was heavy , and since Raffles had no luggage with him , it seemed probable that he had left his portmanteau behind in payment , in order to save money for his travelling fare ; for his purse was empty , and he had only a couple of sixpences and some loose pence in his pockets . Bulstrode gathered a sense of safety from these indications that Raffles had really kept at a distance from Middlemarch since his memorable visit at Christmas . At a distance and among people who were strangers to Bulstrode , what satisfaction could there be to Raffles 's tormenting , self - magnifying vein in telling old scandalous stories about a Middlemarch banker ? And what harm if he did talk ? The chief point now was to keep watch over him as long as there was any danger of that intelligible raving , that unaccountable impulse to tell , which seemed to have acted towards Caleb Garth ; and Bulstrode felt much anxiety lest some such impulse should come over him at the sight of Lydgate . He sat up alone with him through the night , only ordering the housekeeper to lie down in her clothes , so as to be ready when he called her , alleging his own indisposition to sleep , and his anxiety to carry out the doctor 's orders . He did carry them out faithfully , although Raffles was incessantly asking for brandy , and declaring that he was sinking away — that the earth was sinking away from under him . He was restless and sleepless , but still quailing and manageable . On the offer of the food ordered by Lydgate , which he refused , and the denial of other things which he demanded , he seemed to concentrate all his terror on Bulstrode , imploringly deprecating his anger , his revenge on him by starvation , and declaring with strong oaths that he had never told any mortal a word against him . Even this Bulstrode felt that he would not have liked Lydgate to hear ; but a more alarming sign of fitful alternation in his delirium was , that in - the morning twilight Raffles suddenly seemed to imagine a doctor present , addressing him and declaring that Bulstrode wanted to starve him to death out of revenge for telling , when he never had told . Bulstrode 's native imperiousness and strength of determination served him well . This delicate - looking man , himself nervously perturbed , found the needed stimulus in his strenuous circumstances , and through that difficult night and morning , while he had the air of an animated corpse returned to movement without warmth , holding the mastery by its chill impassibility , his mind was intensely at work thinking of what he had to guard against and what would win him security . Whatever prayers he might lift up , whatever statements he might inwardly make of this man 's wretched spiritual condition , and the duty he himself was under to submit to the punishment divinely appointed for him rather than to wish for evil to another — through all this effort to condense words into a solid mental state , there pierced and spread with irresistible vividness the images of the events he desired . And in the train of those images came their apology . He could not but see the death of Raffles , and see in it his own deliverance . What was the removal of this wretched creature ? He was impenitent — but were not public criminals impenitent?—yet the law decided on their fate . Should Providence in this case award death , there was no sin in contemplating death as the desirable issue — if he kept his hands from hastening it — if he scrupulously did what was prescribed . Even here there might be a mistake : human prescriptions were fallible things : Lydgate had said that treatment had hastened death,—why not his own method of treatment ? But of course intention was everything in the question of right and wrong . And Bulstrode set himself to keep his intention separate from his desire . He inwardly declared that he intended to obey orders . Why should he have got into any argument about the validity of these orders ? It was only the common trick of desire — which avails itself of any irrelevant scepticism , finding larger room for itself in all uncertainty about effects , in every obscurity that looks like the absence of law . Still , he did obey the orders . His anxieties continually glanced towards Lydgate , and his remembrance of what had taken place between them the morning before was accompanied with sensibilities which had not been roused at all during the actual scene . He had then cared but little about Lydgate 's painful impressions with regard to the suggested change in the Hospital , or about the disposition towards himself which what he held to be his justifiable refusal of a rather exorbitant request might call forth . He recurred to the scene now with a perception that he had probably made Lydgate his enemy , and with an awakened desire to propitiate him , or rather to create in him a strong sense of personal obligation . He regretted that he had not at once made even an unreasonable money - sacrifice . For in case of unpleasant suspicions , or even knowledge gathered from the raving of Raffles , Bulstrode would have felt that he had a defence in Lydgate 's mind by having conferred a momentous benefit on him . But the regret had perhaps come too late . Strange , piteous conflict in the soul of this unhappy man , who had longed for years to be better than he was — who had taken his selfish passions into discipline and clad them in severe robes , so that he had walked with them as a devout choir , till now that a terror had risen among them , and they could chant no longer , but threw out their common cries for safety . It was nearly the middle of the day before Lydgate arrived : he had meant to come earlier , but had been detained , he said ; and his shattered looks were noticed by Balstrode . But he immediately threw himself into the consideration of the patient , and inquired strictly into all that had occurred . Raffles was worse , would take hardly any food , was persistently wakeful and restlessly raving ; but still not violent . Contrary to Bulstrode 's alarmed expectation , he took little notice of Lydgate 's presence , and continued to talk or murmur incoherently . "
312977	312984	312972	312972	you	5979	" said Bulstrode , in private . "
312990	312991	312992	312992	You	5979	" "
312997	312998	312992	312992	You	5979	" "
313017	313046	313015	313015	yourself	5979	" said Lydgate , looking at Bulstrode with an abrupt question , which made him uneasy , though in reality it was not due to any suspicious conjecture . "
313053	313064	313049	313049	I	0	" said Bulstrode , governing himself and speaking with deliberation . "
313114	313198	313105	313105	You	5979	" The chief new instruction that Lydgate had to give was on the administration of extremely moderate doses of opium , in case of the sleeplessness continuing after several hours . He had taken the precaution of bringing opium in his pocket , and he gave minute directions to Bulstrode as to the doses , and the point at which they should cease . He insisted on the risk of not ceasing ; and repeated his order that no alcohol should be given . "
313207	313211	313250	313251	Mr. Lydgate	278	" he ended , "

313268	313300	313257	313257	I	0	" said Bulstrode , showing a solicitude as unlike his indifference the day before , as his present recklessness about his own fatigue was unlike his habitual self - cherishing anxiety . "
313307	313308	313303	313303	you	5979	" "
313314	313329	313311	313311	I	0	" said Lydgate , brusquely , holding his hat , and ready to go . "
313336	313342	313333	313333	I	0	" said Bulstrode , inquiringly . "
313347	313348	313333	313333	I	0	" "
313354	313362	313352	313352	you	278	" said Lydgate , with some hauteur . "
313415	313416	313409	313409	I	0	" "
313424	313428	313429	313429	I	0	" said Bulstrode ; "
313525	313526	313496	313496	You	278	" "
313529	313545	313496	313496	You	278	" said Lydgate , a great leap of joy within him surmounting every other feeling ; "
313584	313585	313496	313496	You	278	" "
313622	313655	313656	313656	You	278	" While Bulstrode wrote , Lydgate turned to the window thinking of his home — thinking of his life with its good start saved from frustration , its good purposes still unbroken . "
313670	313682	313656	313656	You	278	" said the banker , advancing towards him with the check . "
313719	313720	313705	313705	I	0	" "
313728	313732	313721	313721	I	0	" said Lydgate . "
313751	314353	313733	313733	You	278	" It appeared to him a very natural movement in Bulstrode that he should have reconsidered his refusal : it corresponded with the more munificent side of his character . But as he put his hack into a canter , that he might get the sooner home , and tell the good news to Rosamond , and get cash at the bank to pay over to Dover 's agent , there crossed his mind , with an unpleasant impression , as from a dark - winged flight of evil augury across his vision , the thought of that contrast in himself which a few months had brought — that he should be overjoyed at being under a strong personal obligation — that he should be overjoyed at getting money for himself from Bulstrode . The banker felt that he had done something to nullify one cause of uneasiness , and yet he was scarcely the easier . He did not measure the quantity of diseased motive which had made him wish for Lydgate 's good - will , but the quantity was none the less actively there , like an irritating agent in his blood . A man vows , and yet will not cast away the means of breaking his vow . Is it that he distinctly means to break it ? Not at all ; but the desires which tend to break it are at work in him dimly , and make their way into his imagination , and relax his muscles in the very moments when he is telling himself over again the reasons for his vow . Raffles , recovering quickly , returning to the free use of his odious powers — how could Bulstrode wish for that ? Raffles dead was the image that brought release , and indirectly he prayed for that way of release , beseeching that , if it were possible , the rest of his days here below might be freed from the threat of an ignominy which would break him utterly as an instrument of God 's service . Lydgate 's opinion was not on the side of promise that this prayer would be fulfilled ; and as the day advanced , Bulstrode felt himself getting irritated at the persistent life in this man , whom he would fain have seen sinking into the silence of death : imperious will stirred murderous impulses towards this brute life , over which will , by itself , had no power . He said inwardly that he was getting too much worn ; he would not sit up with the patient to - night , but leave him to Mrs. Abel , who , if necessary , could call her husband . At six o'clock , Raffles , having had only fitful perturbed snatches of sleep , from which he waked with fresh restlessness and perpetual cries that he was sinking away , Bulstrode began to administer the opium according to Lydgate 's directions . At the end of half an hour or more he called Mrs. Abel and told her that he found himself unfit for further watching . He must now consign the patient to her care ; and he proceeded to repeat to her Lydgate 's directions as to the quantity of each dose . Mrs. Abel had not before known anything of Lydgate 's prescriptions ; she had simply prepared and brought whatever Bulstrode ordered , and had done what he pointed out to her . She began now to ask what else she should do besides administering the opium . "
314415	314416	314408	314408	I	0	" "
314428	314433	314422	314422	sir	6934	" said Mrs. Abel , "
314446	314939	314941	314941	you	5993	" Bulstrode went away now without anxiety as to what Raffles might say in his raving , which had taken on a muttering incoherence not likely to create any dangerous belief . At any rate he must risk this . He went down into the wainscoted parlor first , and began to consider whether he would not have his horse saddled and go home by the moonlight , and give up caring for earthly consequences . Then , he wished that he had begged Lydgate to come again that evening . Perhaps he might deliver a different opinion , and think that Raffles was getting into a less hopeful state . Should he send for Lydgate ? If Raffles were really getting worse , and slowly dying , Bulstrode felt that he could go to bed and sleep in gratitude to Providence . But was he worse ? Lydgate might come and simply say that he was going on as he expected , and predict that he would by - and - by fall into a good sleep , and get well . What was the use of sending for him ? Bulstrode shrank from that result . No ideas or opinions could hinder him from seeing the one probability to be , that Raffles recovered would be just the same man as before , with his strength as a tormentor renewed , obliging him to drag away his wife to spend her years apart from her friends and native place , carrying an alienating suspicion against him in her heart . He had sat an hour and a half in this conflict by the firelight only , when a sudden thought made him rise and light the bed - candle , which he had brought down with him . The thought was , that he had not told Mrs. Abel when the doses of opium must cease . He took hold of the candlestick , but stood motionless for a long while . She might already have given him more than Lydgate had prescribed . But it was excusable in him , that he should forget part of an order , in his present wearied condition . He walked up - stairs , candle in hand , not knowing whether he should straightway enter his own room and go to bed , or turn to the patient 's room and rectify his omission . He paused in the passage , with his face turned towards Raffles 's room , and he could hear him moaning and murmuring . He was not asleep , then . Who could know that Lydgate 's prescription would not be better disobeyed than followed , since there was still no sleep ? He turned into his own room . Before he had quite undressed , Mrs. Abel rapped at the door ; he opened it an inch , so that he could hear her speak low . "
315000	315019	314987	314987	he	5995	" To her surprise , Mr. Bulstrode did not answer . A struggle was going on within him . "
315069	315096	315049	315049	I	0	" added Mrs. Abel , with a touch of remonstrance in her tone . But again Mr. Bulstrode did not answer immediately , and she continued , "
315161	315179	315158	315158	your	5995	" Here a key was thrust through the inch of doorway , and Mr. Bulstrode said huskily , "
315198	315336	315190	315190	You	5995	" Early in the morning — about six — Mr. Bulstrode rose and spent some time in prayer . Does any one suppose that private prayer is necessarily candid — necessarily goes to the roots of action ? Private prayer is inaudible speech , and speech is representative : who can represent himself just as he is , even in his own reflections ? Bulstrode had not yet unravelled in his thought the confused promptings of the last four - and - twenty hours . He listened in the passage , and could hear hard stertorous breathing . Then he walked out in the garden , and looked at the early rime on the grass and fresh spring leaves . When he re - entered the house , he felt startled at the sight of Mrs. Abel . "
315347	315360	315361	315361	He	6002	" he said , with an attempt at cheerfulness in his tone . "
315369	315374	315375	315375	He	6002	" said Mrs. Abel . "
315420	315887	315411	315413	the little girl	6005	" Bulstrode went up . At a glance he knew that Raffles was not in the sleep which brings revival , but in the sleep which streams deeper and deeper into the gulf of death . He looked round the room and saw a bottle with some brandy in it , and the almost empty opium phial . He put the phial out of sight , and carried the brandy - bottle down - stairs with him , locking it again in the wine - cooler . While breakfasting he considered whether he should ride to Middlemarch at once , or wait for Lydgate 's arrival . He decided to wait , and told Mrs. Abel that she might go about her work — he could watch in the bed - chamber . As he sat there and beheld the enemy of his peace going irrevocably into silence , he felt more at rest than he had done for many months . His conscience was soothed by the enfolding wing of secrecy , which seemed just then like an angel sent down for his relief . He drew out his pocket - book to review various memoranda there as to the arrangements he had projected and partly carried out in the prospect of quitting Middlemarch , and considered how far he would let them stand or recall them , now that his absence would be brief . Some economies which he felt desirable might still find a suitable occasion in his temporary withdrawal from management , and he hoped still that Mrs. Casaubon would take a large share in the expenses of the Hospital . In that way the moments passed , until a change in the stertorous breathing was marked enough to draw his attention wholly to the bed , and forced him to think of the departing life , which had once been subservient to his own — which he had once been glad to find base enough for him to act on as he would . It was his gladness then which impelled him now to be glad that the life was at an end . And who could say that the death of Raffles had been hastened ? Who knew what would have saved him ? Lydgate arrived at half - past ten , in time to witness the final pause of the breath . When he entered the room Bulstrode observed a sudden expression in his face , which was not so much surprise as a recognition that he had not judged correctly . He stood by the bed in silence for some time , with his eyes turned on the dying man , but with that subdued activity of expression which showed that he was carrying on an inward debate . "
315894	315902	315411	315413	the little girl	6005	" said he , looking at Bulstrode . "
315912	315916	315903	315903	I	0	" said Bulstrode . "
315958	315974	315951	315951	he	6006	" Lydgate did not ask another question , but watched in silence until he said , "
315980	316526	315951	315951	he	6006	" This morning Lydgate was in a state of recovered hope and freedom . He had set out on his work with all his old animation , and felt himself strong enough to bear all the deficiencies of his married life . And he was conscious that Bulstrode had been a benefactor to him . But he was uneasy about this case . He had not expected it to terminate as it had done . Yet he hardly knew how to put a question on the subject to Bulstrode without appearing to insult him ; and if he examined the housekeeper — why , the man was dead . There seemed to be no use in implying that somebody 's ignorance or imprudence had killed him . And after all , he himself might be wrong . He and Bulstrode rode back to Middlemarch together , talking of many things — chiefly cholera and the chances of the Reform Bill in the House of Lords , and the firm resolve of the political Unions . Nothing was said about Raffles , except that Bulstrode mentioned the necessity of having a grave for him in Lowick churchyard , and observed that , so far as he knew , the poor man had no connections , except Rigg , whom he had stated to be unfriendly towards him . On returning home Lydgate had a visit from Mr. Farebrother . The Vicar had not been in the town the day before , but the news that there was an execution in Lydgate 's house had got to Lowick by the evening , having been carried by Mr. Spicer , shoemaker and parish - clerk , who had it from his brother , the respectable bell - hanger in Lowick Gate . Since that evening when Lydgate had come down from the billiard room with Fred Vincy , Mr. Farebrother 's thoughts about him had been rather gloomy . Playing at the Green Dragon once or oftener might have been a trifle in another man ; but in Lydgate it was one of several signs that he was getting unlike his former self . He was beginning to do things for which he had formerly even an excessive scorn . Whatever certain dissatisfactions in marriage , which some silly tinklings of gossip had given him hints of , might have to do with this change , Mr. Farebrother felt sure that it was chiefly connected with the debts which were being more and more distinctly reported , and he began to fear that any notion of Lydgate 's having resources or friends in the background must be quite illusory . The rebuff he had met with in his first attempt to win Lydgate 's confidence , disinclined him to a second ; but this news of the execution being actually in the house , determined the Vicar to overcome his reluctance . Lydgate had just dismissed a poor patient , in whom he was much interested , and he came forward to put out his hand — with an open cheerfulness which surprised Mr. Farebrother . Could this too be a proud rejection of sympathy and help ? Never mind ; the sympathy and help should be offered . "
316550	316585	316586	316586	I	0	" said the Vicar , in the tone of a good brother , only that there was no reproach in it . They were both seated by this time , and Lydgate answered immediately — "
316606	316607	316594	316594	You	0	" "
316614	316615	316594	316594	You	0	" "
316620	316642	316594	316594	You	0	" said Lydgate , with an air of freedom , as if he did not mind talking about the affair now . "
316683	316684	316685	316685	I	0	" "
316693	316721	316685	316685	I	0	" said the Vicar , falling back in his chair , and speaking with that low - toned quickness which often follows the removal of a load . "
316747	316748	316738	316738	I	0	" "
316754	316760	316738	316738	I	0	" said Lydgate , cordially . "
316798	316806	316786	316786	I	0	" he added , smiling rather sadly ; "
316822	316836	316837	316837	My	0	" Mr. Farebrother was silent for a moment , and then said earnestly , "
316856	316857	316858	316858	I	0	" "
316872	316873	316862	316862	you	4142	" "
316909	316910	316892	316892	you?—in	6010	" "
316913	316920	316892	316892	you?—in	6010	" said Lydgate , colouring slightly . "
316971	316972	316949	316949	He	274	" "
316979	317026	316949	316949	He	274	" said Mr. Farebrother , compelling himself to approve of the man whom he disliked . His delicate feeling shrank from dwelling even in his thought on the fact that he had always urged Lydgate to avoid any personal entanglement with Bulstrode . He added immediately , "
317070	317209	317065	317065	he	274	" Lydgate felt uncomfortable under these kindly suppositions . They made more distinct within him the uneasy consciousness which had shown its first dim stirrings only a few hours before , that Bulstrode 's motives for his sudden beneficence following close upon the chillest indifference might be merely selfish . He let the kindly suppositions pass . He could not tell the history of the loan , but it was more vividly present with him than ever , as well as the fact which the Vicar delicately ignored — that this relation of personal indebtedness to Bulstrode was what he had once been most resolved to avoid . He began , instead of answering , to speak of his projected economies , and of his having come to look at his life from a different point of view . "
317217	317221	317222	317222	I	0	" he said . "
317286	317291	317267	317267	I	0	" Poor Lydgate ! the "
317298	317670	317293	317293	Rosamond	283	" which had fallen from him involuntarily as part of his thought , was a significant mark of the yoke he bore . But Mr. Farebrother , whose hopes entered strongly into the same current with Lydgate 's , and who knew nothing about him that could now raise a melancholy presentiment , left him with affectionate congratulation . Five days after the death of Raffles , Mr. Bambridge was standing at his leisure under the large archway leading into the yard of the Green Dragon . He was not fond of solitary contemplation , but he had only just come out of the house , and any human figure standing at ease under the archway in the early afternoon was as certain to attract companionship as a pigeon which has found something worth pecking at . In this case there was no material object to feed upon , but the eye of reason saw a probability of mental sustenance in the shape of gossip . Mr. Hopkins , the meek - mannered draper opposite , was the first to act on this inward vision , being the more ambitious of a little masculine talk because his customers were chiefly women . Mr. Bambridge was rather curt to the draper , feeling that Hopkins was of course glad to talk to him , but that he was not going to waste much of his talk on Hopkins . Soon , however , there was a small cluster of more important listeners , who were either deposited from the passers - by , or had sauntered to the spot expressly to see if there were anything going on at the Green Dragon ; and Mr. Bambridge was finding it worth his while to say many impressive things about the fine studs he had been seeing and the purchases he had made on a journey in the north from which he had just returned . Gentlemen present were assured that when they could show him anything to cut out a blood mare , a bay , rising four , which was to be seen at Doncaster if they chose to go and look at it , Mr. Bambridge would gratify them by being shot "
317676	317914	317293	317293	Rosamond	283	" Also , a pair of blacks which he was going to put into the break recalled vividly to his mind a pair which he had sold to Faulkner in ' 19 , for a hundred guineas , and which Faulkner had sold for a hundred and sixty two months later — any gent who could disprove this statement being offered the privilege of calling Mr. Bambridge by a very ugly name until the exercise made his throat dry . When the discourse was at this point of animation , came up Mr. Frank Hawley . He was not a man to compromise his dignity by lounging at the Green Dragon , but happening to pass along the High Street and seeing Bambridge on the other side , he took some of his long strides across to ask the horsedealer whether he had found the first - rate gig - horse which he had engaged to look for . Mr. Hawley was requested to wait until he had seen a gray selected at Bilkley : if that did not meet his wishes to a hair , Bambridge did not know a horse when he saw it , which seemed to be the highest conceivable unlikelihood . Mr. Hawley , standing with his back to the street , was fixing a time for looking at the gray and seeing it tried , when a horseman passed slowly by . "
317917	317943	317944	317944	Mr.	6015	" said two or three voices at once in a low tone , one of them , which was the draper 's , respectfully prefixing the "
317946	317961	317944	317944	Mr.	6015	" but nobody having more intention in this interjectural naming than if they had said "
317965	317999	317944	317944	Mr.	6015	" when that vehicle appeared in the distance . Mr. Hawley gave a careless glance round at Bulstrode 's back , but as Bambridge 's eyes followed it he made a sarcastic grimace . "
318007	318017	318005	318005	me	0	" he began , lowering his voice a little , "
318089	318090	318083	318083	his	274	" "
318096	318134	318093	318093	you	6015	" said Mr. Hawley , thrusting his hands into his pockets , and pushing a little forward under the archway . If Bulstrode should turn out to be a rascal , Frank Hawley had a prophetic soul . "
318161	318175	318155	318155	I	0	" said Bambridge , with a sudden gesture of his fore - finger . "
318290	318315	318281	318282	A man	846	" Mr. Bambridge made this remark with an air of disgust , satisfied that his own bragging showed a fine sense of the marketable . "
318329	318334	318281	318282	A man	846	" said Mr. Hawley . "
318361	318362	318363	318363	Raffles	597	" "
318365	318370	318363	318363	Raffles	597	" exclaimed Mr. Hopkins . "
318393	318410	318383	318384	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" There was a strong sensation among the listeners . Mr. Bambridge gave an ejaculation in which "
318412	318433	318383	318384	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" was the mildest word , and Mr. Hawley , knitting his brows and bending his head forward , exclaimed , "
318440	318441	318383	318384	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" "
318446	318451	318452	318453	The housekeeper	10868	" said the draper . "
318471	318472	318464	318464	He	6995	" "
318486	318490	318479	318479	I	0	" interposed Bambridge . "
318497	318501	318492	318493	any doctor	6033	" said Mr. Hawley "
318522	318523	318516	318516	He	6995	" "
318529	318536	318527	318527	Bambridge	440	" said Mr. Hawley , insistently . "
318545	319074	318539	318540	this fellow	6034	" The group had already become larger , the town - clerk 's presence being a guarantee that something worth listening to was going on there ; and Mr. Bambridge delivered his narrative in the hearing of seven . It was mainly what we know , including the fact about Will Ladislaw , with some local colour and circumstance added : it was what Bulstrode had dreaded the betrayal of — and hoped to have buried forever with the corpse of Raffles — it was that haunting ghost of his earlier life which as he rode past the archway of the Green Dragon he was trusting that Providence had delivered him from . Yes , Providence . He had not confessed to himself yet that he had done anything in the way of contrivance to this end ; he had accepted what seemed to have been offered . It was impossible to prove that he had done anything which hastened the departure of that man 's soul . But this gossip about Bulstrode spread through Middlemarch like the smell of fire . Mr. Frank Hawley followed up his information by sending a clerk whom he could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of inquiring about hay , but really to gather all that could be learned about Raffles and his illness from Mrs. Abel . In this way it came to his knowledge that Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court in his gig ; and Mr. Hawley in consequence took an opportunity of seeing Caleb , calling at his office to ask whether he had time to undertake an arbitration if it were required , and then asking him incidentally about Raffles . Caleb was betrayed into no word injurious to Bulstrode beyond the fact which he was forced to admit , that he had given up acting for him within the last week . Mr Hawley drew his inferences , and feeling convinced that Raffles had told his story to Garth , and that Garth had given up Bulstrode 's affairs in consequence , said so a few hours later to Mr. Toller . The statement was passed on until it had quite lost the stamp of an inference , and was taken as information coming straight from Garth , so that even a diligent historian might have concluded Caleb to be the chief publisher of Bulstrode 's misdemeanors . Mr. Hawley was not slow to perceive that there was no handle for the law either in the revelations made by Raffles or in the circumstances of his death . He had himself ridden to Lowick village that he might look at the register and talk over the whole matter with Mr. Farebrother , who was not more surprised than the lawyer that an ugly secret should have come to light about Bulstrode , though he had always had justice enough in him to hinder his antipathy from turning into conclusions . But while they were talking another combination was silently going forward in Mr. Farebrother 's mind , which foreshadowed what was soon to be loudly spoken of in Middlemarch as a necessary "
319082	319182	318539	318540	this fellow	6034	" With the reasons which kept Bulstrode in dread of Raffles there flashed the thought that the dread might have something to do with his munificence towards his medical man ; and though he resisted the suggestion that it had been consciously accepted in any way as a bribe , he had a foreboding that this complication of things might be of malignant effect on Lydgate 's reputation . He perceived that Mr. Hawley knew nothing at present of the sudden relief from debt , and he himself was careful to glide away from all approaches towards the subject . "
319185	319214	318539	318540	this fellow	6034	" he said , with a deep breath , wanting to wind up the illimitable discussion of what might have been , though nothing could be legally proven , "
319287	319288	319324	319324	he	261	" "
319298	319307	319293	319293	I	0	" said Mr. Hawley , mounting his horse . "
319320	319321	319318	319318	Gypsy	6041	" "
319344	319351	319335	319335	he	261	" said Mr. Farebrother , smiling . "
319362	320025	319335	319335	he	261	" said Mr. Hawley , who had been in the habit of saying apologetically that Farebrother was such a damned pleasant good - hearted fellow you would mistake him for a Tory . Mr. Hawley rode home without thinking of Lydgate 's attendance on Raffles in any other light than as a piece of evidence on the side of Bulstrode . But the news that Lydgate had all at once become able not only to get rid of the execution in his house but to pay all his debts in Middlemarch was spreading fast , gathering round it conjectures and comments which gave it new body and impetus , and soon filling the ears of other persons besides Mr. Hawley , who were not slow to see a significant relation between this sudden command of money and Bulstrode 's desire to stifle the scandal of Raffles . That the money came from Bulstrode would infallibly have been guessed even if there had been no direct evidence of it ; for it had beforehand entered into the gossip about Lydgate 's affairs , that neither his father - in - law nor his own family would do anything for him , and direct evidence was furnished not only by a clerk at the Bank , but by innocent Mrs. Bulstrode herself , who mentioned the loan to Mrs. Plymdale , who mentioned it to her daughter - in - law of the house of Toller , who mentioned it generally . The business was felt to be so public and important that it required dinners to feed it , and many invitations were just then issued and accepted on the strength of this scandal concerning Bulstrode and Lydgate ; wives , widows , and single ladies took their work and went out to tea oftener than usual ; and all public conviviality , from the Green Dragon to Dollop 's , gathered a zest which could not be won from the question whether the Lords would throw out the Reform Bill . For hardly anybody doubted that some scandalous reason or other was at the bottom of Bulstrode 's liberality to Lydgate . Mr. Hawley indeed , in the first instance , invited a select party , including the two physicians , with Mr Toller and Mr. Wrench , expressly to hold a close discussion as to the probabilities of Raffles 's illness , reciting to them all the particulars which had been gathered from Mrs. Abel in connection with Lydgate 's certificate , that the death was due to delirium tremens ; and the medical gentlemen , who all stood undisturbedly on the old paths in relation to this disease , declared that they could see nothing in these particulars which could be transformed into a positive ground of suspicion . But the moral grounds of suspicion remained : the strong motives Bulstrode clearly had for wishing to be rid of Raffles , and the fact that at this critical moment he had given Lydgate the help which he must for some time have known the need for ; the disposition , moreover , to believe that Bulstrode would be unscrupulous , and the absence of any indisposition to believe that Lydgate might be as easily bribed as other haughty - minded men when they have found themselves in want of money . Even if the money had been given merely to make him hold his tongue about the scandal of Bulstrode 's earlier life , the fact threw an odious light on Lydgate , who had long been sneered at as making himself subservient to the banker for the sake of working himself into predominance , and discrediting the elder members of his profession . Hence , in spite of the negative as to any direct sign of guilt in relation to the death at Stone Court , Mr. Hawley 's select party broke up with the sense that the affair had "
320030	320201	319335	319335	he	261	" But this vague conviction of indeterminable guilt , which was enough to keep up much head - shaking and biting innuendo even among substantial professional seniors , had for the general mind all the superior power of mystery over fact . Everybody liked better to conjecture how the thing was , than simply to know it ; for conjecture soon became more confident than knowledge , and had a more liberal allowance for the incompatible . Even the more definite scandal concerning Bulstrode 's earlier life was , for some minds , melted into the mass of mystery , as so much lively metal to be poured out in dialogue , and to take such fantastic shapes as heaven pleased . This was the tone of thought chiefly sanctioned by Mrs. Dollop , the spirited landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane , who had often to resist the shallow pragmatism of customers disposed to think that their reports from the outer world were of equal force with what had "
320204	320232	320269	320269	he	6044	" in her mind . How it had been brought to her she did n't know , but it was there before her as if it had been "
320243	320249	320250	320250	his	6044	" as Bulstrode should say , "
320278	320279	320269	320269	he	6044	" "
320284	320301	320269	320269	he	6044	" said Mr. Limp , a meditative shoemaker , with weak eyes and a piping voice . "

320336	320341	320320	320320	he	6045	" said Mrs. Dollop . "

320487	320501	320477	320477	He	6044	" said Mr. Dill , the barber , who had just dropped in . "

320767	320791	320792	320792	Fletcher	770	" said the barber , who felt himself a little above his company at Dollop 's , but liked it none the worse . "
320840	320841	320833	320833	he	846	" "
320847	320854	320855	320855	I	0	" said Mrs. Dollop , indignantly . "
320993	321038	320985	320985	I	0	" Mr. Dill affected to laugh in a complimentary way at Mrs. Dollop , as a woman who was more than a match for the lawyers ; being disposed to submit to much twitting from a landlady who had a long score against him . "
321064	321069	320985	320985	I	0	" said the glazier . "

321513	321602	321501	321501	I	0	" Mrs. Dollop looked round with the air of a landlady accustomed to dominate her company . There was a chorus of adhesion from the more courageous ; but Mr. Limp , after taking a draught , placed his flat hands together and pressed them hard between his knees , looking down at them with blear - eyed contemplation , as if the scorching power of Mrs. Dollop 's speech had quite dried up and nullified his wits until they could be brought round again by further moisture . "
321616	321621	321613	321614	the Crowner	6103	" said the dyer . "
321645	321646	321648	321648	they	6101	" "
321653	321660	321650	321651	Mr. Jonas	225	" said Mrs Dollop , emphatically . "
321860	321867	321850	321851	a mother	2205	" The heads of this discussion at "
321870	321919	321921	321921	Harriet	338	" had been the common theme among all classes in the town , had been carried to Lowick Parsonage on one side and to Tipton Grange on the other , had come fully to the ears of the Vincy family , and had been discussed with sad reference to "
321922	322019	322020	322020	We	6117	" by all Mrs. Bulstrode 's friends , before Lydgate knew distinctly why people were looking strangely at him , and before Bulstrode himself suspected the betrayal of his secrets . He had not been accustomed to very cordial relations with his neighbors , and hence he could not miss the signs of cordiality ; moreover , he had been taking journeys on business of various kinds , having now made up his mind that he need not quit Middlemarch , and feeling able consequently to determine on matters which he had before left in suspense . "
322036	322044	322020	322020	We	6117	" he had said to his wife . "
322075	322112	322113	322113	I	0	" He really believed in the spiritual advantages , and meant that his life henceforth should be the more devoted because of those later sins which he represented to himself as hypothetic , praying hypothetically for their pardon:—"if
322118	322718	322719	322720	Mr. Chairman	6120	" As to the Hospital , he avoided saying anything further to Lydgate , fearing to manifest a too sudden change of plans immediately on the death of Raffles . In his secret soul he believed that Lydgate suspected his orders to have been intentionally disobeyed , and suspecting this he must also suspect a motive . But nothing had been betrayed to him as to the history of Raffles , and Bulstrode was anxious not to do anything which would give emphasis to his undefined suspicions . As to any certainty that a particular method of treatment would either save or kill , Lydgate himself was constantly arguing against such dogmatism ; he had no right to speak , and he had every motive for being silent . Hence Bulstrode felt himself providentially secured . The only incident he had strongly winced under had been an occasional encounter with Caleb Garth , who , however , had raised his hat with mild gravity . Meanwhile , on the part of the principal townsmen a strong determination was growing against him . A meeting was to be held in the Town - Hall on a sanitary question which had risen into pressing importance by the occurrence of a cholera case in the town . Since the Act of Parliament , which had been hurriedly passed , authorizing assessments for sanitary measures , there had been a Board for the superintendence of such measures appointed in Middlemarch , and much cleansing and preparation had been concurred in by Whigs and Tories . The question now was , whether a piece of ground outside the town should be secured as a burial - ground by means of assessment or by private subscription . The meeting was to be open , and almost everybody of importance in the town was expected to be there . Mr. Bulstrode was a member of the Board , and just before twelve o'clock he started from the Bank with the intention of urging the plan of private subscription . Under the hesitation of his projects , he had for some time kept himself in the background , and he felt that he should this morning resume his old position as a man of action and influence in the public affairs of the town where he expected to end his days . Among the various persons going in the same direction , he saw Lydgate ; they joined , talked over the object of the meeting , and entered it together . It seemed that everybody of mark had been earlier than they . But there were still spaces left near the head of the large central table , and they made their way thither . Mr. Farebrother sat opposite , not far from Mr. Hawley ; all the medical men were there ; Mr. Thesiger was in the chair , and Mr. Brooke of Tipton was on his right hand . Lydgate noticed a peculiar interchange of glances when he and Bulstrode took their seats . After the business had been fully opened by the chairman , who pointed out the advantages of purchasing by subscription a piece of ground large enough to be ultimately used as a general cemetery , Mr. Bulstrode , whose rather high - pitched but subdued and fluent voice the town was used to at meetings of this sort , rose and asked leave to deliver his opinion . Lydgate could see again the peculiar interchange of glances before Mr. Hawley started up , and said in his firm resonant voice , "
322764	322778	322817	322818	Mr. Chairman	773	" Mr. Hawley 's mode of speech , even when public decorum repressed his "
322782	322809	322817	322818	Mr. Chairman	773	" was formidable in its curtness and self - possession . Mr. Thesiger sanctioned the request , Mr. Bulstrode sat down , and Mr. Hawley continued . "
323070	323459	323460	323460	I	0	" All eyes in the room were turned on Mr. Bulstrode , who , since the first mention of his name , had been going through a crisis of feeling almost too violent for his delicate frame to support . Lydgate , who himself was undergoing a shock as from the terrible practical interpretation of some faint augury , felt , nevertheless , that his own movement of resentful hatred was checked by that instinct of the Healer which thinks first of bringing rescue or relief to the sufferer , when he looked at the shrunken misery of Bulstrode 's livid face . The quick vision that his life was after all a failure , that he was a dishonoured man , and must quail before the glance of those towards whom he had habitually assumed the attitude of a reprover — that God had disowned him before men and left him unscreened to the triumphant scorn of those who were glad to have their hatred justified — the sense of utter futility in that equivocation with his conscience in dealing with the life of his accomplice , an equivocation which now turned venomously upon him with the full - grown fang of a discovered lie:—all this rushed through him like the agony of terror which fails to kill , and leaves the ears still open to the returning wave of execration . The sudden sense of exposure after the re - established sense of safety came — not to the coarse organization of a criminal , but to the susceptible nerve of a man whose intensest being lay in such mastery and predominance as the conditions of his life had shaped for him . But in that intense being lay the strength of reaction . Through all his bodily infirmity there ran a tenacious nerve of ambitious self - preserving will , which had continually leaped out like a flame , scattering all doctrinal fears , and which , even while he sat an object of compassion for the merciful , was beginning to stir and glow under his ashy paleness . Before the last words were out of Mr. Hawley 's mouth , Bulstrode felt that he should answer , and that his answer would be a retort . He dared not get up and say , "
323469	323620	323621	323621	I	0	false"—even if he had dared this , it would have seemed to him , under his present keen sense of betrayal , as vain as to pull , for covering to his nakedness , a frail rag which would rend at every little strain . For a few moments there was total silence , while every man in the room was looking at Bulstrode . He sat perfectly still , leaning hard against the back of his chair ; he could not venture to rise , and when he began to speak he pressed his hands upon the seat on each side of him . But his voice was perfectly audible , though hoarser than usual , and his words were distinctly pronounced , though he paused between sentence as if short of breath . He said , turning first toward Mr. Thesiger , and then looking at Mr. Hawley — "
323695	323714	323717	323718	my accuser	6143	" here Bulstrode 's voice rose and took on a more biting accent , till it seemed a low cry—"who
323785	323841	323845	323845	me	0	" After the word chicanery there was a growing noise , half of murmurs and half of hisses , while four persons started up at once — Mr. Hawley , Mr. Toller , Mr. Chichely , and Mr. Hackbutt ; but Mr. Hawley 's outburst was instantaneous , and left the others behind in silence . "
324012	324013	323977	323977	I	0	" "
324020	324048	324017	324018	Mr. Hawley	405	" said the chairman ; and Mr. Hawley , still fuming , bowed half impatiently , and sat down with his hands thrust deep in his pockets . "
324066	324078	324057	324057	I	0	" said Mr. Thesiger , turning to the pallid trembling man ; "
324202	324513	324170	324170	I	0	" Bulstrode , after a moment 's hesitation , took his hat from the floor and slowly rose , but he grasped the corner of the chair so totteringly that Lydgate felt sure there was not strength enough in him to walk away without support . What could he do ? He could not see a man sink close to him for want of help . He rose and gave his arm to Bulstrode , and in that way led him out of the room ; yet this act , which might have been one of gentle duty and pure compassion , was at this moment unspeakably bitter to him . It seemed as if he were putting his sign - manual to that association of himself with Bulstrode , of which he now saw the full meaning as it must have presented itself to other minds . He now felt the conviction that this man who was leaning tremblingly on his arm , had given him the thousand pounds as a bribe , and that somehow the treatment of Raffles had been tampered with from an evil motive . The inferences were closely linked enough ; the town knew of the loan , believed it to be a bribe , and believed that he took it as a bribe . Poor Lydgate , his mind struggling under the terrible clutch of this revelation , was all the while morally forced to take Mr. Bulstrode to the Bank , send a man off for his carriage , and wait to accompany him home . Meanwhile the business of the meeting was despatched , and fringed off into eager discussion among various groups concerning this affair of Bulstrode — and Lydgate . Mr. Brooke , who had before heard only imperfect hints of it , and was very uneasy that he had "
324519	324563	324566	324566	my	0	" in countenancing Bulstrode , now got himself fully informed , and felt some benevolent sadness in talking to Mr. Farebrother about the ugly light in which Lydgate had come to be regarded . Mr. Farebrother was going to walk back to Lowick . "
324569	324574	324566	324566	my	0	" said Mr. Brooke . "
324604	324719	324594	324594	She	276	" So they drove along , Mr. Brooke chatting with good - natured hope that there had not really been anything black in Lydgate 's behavior — a young fellow whom he had seen to be quite above the common mark , when he brought a letter from his uncle Sir Godwin . Mr. Farebrother said little : he was deeply mournful : with a keen perception of human weakness , he could not be confident that under the pressure of humiliating needs Lydgate had not fallen below himself . When the carriage drove up to the gate of the Manor , Dorothea was out on the gravel , and came to greet them . "
324725	324730	324594	324594	She	276	" said Mr. Brooke , "
324746	324747	324743	324743	you	6867	" "
324753	324777	324749	324750	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Dorothea , who looked full of health and animation , and stood with her head bare under the gleaming April lights . "
324804	324805	324794	324794	I	0	" "
324811	324816	324794	324794	I	0	" said Mr. Brooke , "
324830	324898	324899	324899	You	0	" They walked through the garden towards the churchyard gate , Mr. Farebrother wanting to go on to the parsonage ; and Dorothea heard the whole sad story . She listened with deep interest , and begged to hear twice over the facts and impressions concerning Lydgate . After a short silence , pausing at the churchyard gate , and addressing Mr. Farebrother , she said energetically — "
324928	324980	324919	324919	us	6161	" Dorothea 's impetuous generosity , which would have leaped at once to the vindication of Lydgate from the suspicion of having accepted money as a bribe , underwent a melancholy check when she came to consider all the circumstances of the case by the light of Mr. Farebrother 's experience . "
324989	324993	324919	324919	us	6161	" he said . "
325108	325109	325110	325110	I	0	" "
325136	325256	325121	325121	I	0	" said Dorothea . Some of her intensest experience in the last two years had set her mind strongly in opposition to any unfavourable construction of others ; and for the first time she felt rather discontented with Mr. Farebrother . She disliked this cautious weighing of consequences , instead of an ardent faith in efforts of justice and mercy , which would conquer by their emotional force . Two days afterwards , he was dining at the Manor with her uncle and the Chettams , and when the dessert was standing uneaten , the servants were out of the room , and Mr. Brooke was nodding in a nap , she returned to the subject with renewed vivacity . "
325323	325427	325307	325314	a man who advised me in my trouble	6173	" Dorothea 's tone and manner were not more energetic than they had been when she was at the head of her uncle 's table nearly three years before , and her experience since had given her more right to express a decided opinion . But Sir James Chettam was no longer the diffident and acquiescent suitor : he was the anxious brother - in - law , with a devout admiration for his sister , but with a constant alarm lest she should fall under some new illusion almost as bad as marrying Casaubon . He smiled much less ; when he said "
325429	325482	325307	325314	a man who advised me in my trouble	6173	" it was more often an introduction to a dissentient opinion than in those submissive bachelor days ; and Dorothea found to her surprise that she had to resolve not to be afraid of him — all the more because he was really her best friend . He disagreed with her now . "
325487	325493	325494	325494	you	189	" he said , remonstrantly , "
325541	325542	325543	325543	I	0	" "

325780	325791	325777	325778	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" said Mr. Farebrother , smiling gently at her ardor , "

325833	325836	325777	325778	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" said Dorothea "
325986	326013	325967	325967	People	6815	" Dorothea 's eyes had a moist brightness in them , and the changed tones of her voice roused her uncle , who began to listen . "
326037	326049	326018	326019	a woman	6894	" said Mr. Farebrother , almost converted by Dorothea 's ardor . "
326072	326082	326052	326053	a woman	6894	" said Sir James , with his little frown . "
326126	326135	326120	326120	You	6196	" he ended , looking at Mr. Farebrother . "
326146	326151	326136	326136	I	0	" said the latter . "
326159	326188	326136	326136	I	0	" said Mr. Brooke , not quite knowing at what point the discussion had arrived , but coming up to it with a contribution which was generally appropriate . "
326284	326308	326271	326271	you	6196	" Dorothea , submitting uneasily to this discouragement , went with Celia into the library , which was her usual drawing - room . "
326320	326324	326317	326317	James	177	" said Celia , "

326421	326425	326402	326403	A husband	958	" said Dorothea . "
326439	326452	326402	326403	A husband	958	" Mrs. Casaubon was still undisciplined enough to burst into angry tears . "
326459	326471	326402	326403	A husband	958	" said Celia , with rather a deeper guttural than usual , "
326511	326512	326493	326493	I	0	" "
326533	326545	326528	326528	my	0	" said Dorothea , looking through the prism of her tears . "
326564	326577	326550	326550	you	184	" said Celia , with a sense of stringency in her argument . "
326606	326614	326594	326594	men	6762	" Dorothea laughed and forgot her tears . "
326625	326629	326594	326594	men	6762	" explained Celia . "
326653	327111	327112	327112	He	6206	" When Lydgate had allayed Mrs. Bulstrode 's anxiety by telling her that her husband had been seized with faintness at the meeting , but that he trusted soon to see him better and would call again the next day , unless she sent for him earlier , he went directly home , got on his horse , and rode three miles out of the town for the sake of being out of reach . He felt himself becoming violent and unreasonable as if raging under the pain of stings : he was ready to curse the day on which he had come to Middlemarch . Everything that bad happened to him there seemed a mere preparation for this hateful fatality , which had come as a blight on his honourable ambition , and must make even people who had only vulgar standards regard his reputation as irrevocably damaged . In such moments a man can hardly escape being unloving . Lydgate thought of himself as the sufferer , and of others as the agents who had injured his lot . He had meant everything to turn out differently ; and others had thrust themselves into his life and thwarted his purposes . His marriage seemed an unmitigated calamity ; and he was afraid of going to Rosamond before he had vented himself in this solitary rage , lest the mere sight of her should exasperate him and make him behave unwarrantably . There are episodes in most men 's lives in which their highest qualities can only cast a deterring shadow over the objects that fill their inward vision : Lydgate 's tenderheartedness was present just then only as a dread lest he should offend against it , not as an emotion that swayed him to tenderness . For he was very miserable . Only those who know the supremacy of the intellectual life — the life which has a seed of ennobling thought and purpose within it — can understand the grief of one who falls from that serene activity into the absorbing soul - wasting struggle with worldly annoyances . How was he to live on without vindicating himself among people who suspected him of baseness ? How could he go silently away from Middlemarch as if he were retreating before a just condemnation ? And yet how was he to set about vindicating himself ? For that scene at the meeting , which he had just witnessed , although it had told him no particulars , had been enough to make his own situation thoroughly clear to him . Bulstrode had been in dread of scandalous disclosures on the part of Raffles . Lydgate could now construct all the probabilities of the case . "
327294	327372	327281	327281	his	6206	" There was a benumbing cruelty in his position . Even if he renounced every other consideration than that of justifying himself — if he met shrugs , cold glances , and avoidance as an accusation , and made a public statement of all the facts as he knew them , who would be convinced ? It would be playing the part of a fool to offer his own testimony on behalf of himself , and say , "
327383	327811	327277	327277	Bulstrode	312	" The circumstances would always be stronger than his assertion . And besides , to come forward and tell everything about himself must include declarations about Bulstrode which would darken the suspicions of others against him . He must tell that he had not known of Raffles 's existence when he first mentioned his pressing need of money to Bulstrode , and that he took the money innocently as a result of that communication , not knowing that a new motive for the loan might have arisen on his being called in to this man . And after all , the suspicion of Bulstrode 's motives might be unjust . But then came the question whether he should have acted in precisely the same way if he had not taken the money ? Certainly , if Raffles had continued alive and susceptible of further treatment when he arrived , and he had then imagined any disobedience to his orders on the part of Bulstrode , he would have made a strict inquiry , and if his conjecture had been verified he would have thrown up the case , in spite of his recent heavy obligation . But if he had not received any money — if Bulstrode had never revoked his cold recommendation of bankruptcy — would he , Lydgate , have abstained from all inquiry even on finding the man dead?—would the shrinking from an insult to Bulstrode — would the dubiousness of all medical treatment and the argument that his own treatment would pass for the wrong with most members of his profession — have had just the same force or significance with him ? That was the uneasy corner of Lydgate 's consciousness while he was reviewing the facts and resisting all reproach . If he had been independent , this matter of a patient 's treatment and the distinct rule that he must do or see done that which he believed best for the life committed to him , would have been the point on which he would have been the sturdiest . As it was , he had rested in the consideration that disobedience to his orders , however it might have arisen , could not be considered a crime , that in the dominant opinion obedience to his orders was just as likely to be fatal , and that the affair was simply one of etiquette . Whereas , again and again , in his time of freedom , he had denounced the perversion of pathological doubt into moral doubt and had said—"the
327876	327895	327902	327902	them	6212	" Alas ! the scientific conscience had got into the debasing company of money obligation and selfish respects . "
327914	327932	327898	327930	a medical man of them all in Middlemarch who would question himself as I do ? " said poor Lydgate , with a renewed outburst of rebellion against the oppression of his lot	12253	" said poor Lydgate , with a renewed outburst of rebellion against the oppression of his lot . "
328009	328336	328337	328337	I	0	" Already there had been abundant signs which had hitherto puzzled him , that just when he had been paying off his debts and getting cheerfully on his feet , the townsmen were avoiding him or looking strangely at him , and in two instances it came to his knowledge that patients of his had called in another practitioner . The reasons were too plain now . The general black - balling had begun . No wonder that in Lydgate 's energetic nature the sense of a hopeless misconstruction easily turned into a dogged resistance . The scowl which occasionally showed itself on his square brow was not a meaningless accident . Already when he was re - entering the town after that ride taken in the first hours of stinging pain , he was setting his mind on remaining in Middlemarch in spite of the worst that could be done against him . He would not retreat before calumny , as if he submitted to it . He would face it to the utmost , and no act of his should show that he was afraid . It belonged to the generosity as well as defiant force of his nature that he resolved not to shrink from showing to the full his sense of obligation to Bulstrode . It was true that the association with this man had been fatal to him — true that if he had had the thousand pounds still in his hands with all his debts unpaid he would have returned the money to Bulstrode , and taken beggary rather than the rescue which had been sullied with the suspicion of a bribe ( for , remember , he was one of the proudest among the sons of men)—nevertheless , he would not turn away from this crushed fellow - mortal whose aid he had used , and make a pitiful effort to get acquittal for himself by howling against another . "
328360	328888	328890	328891	poor woman	6216	" he was going on with an obstinate resolve , but he was getting near home , and the thought of Rosamond urged itself again into that chief place from which it had been thrust by the agonized struggles of wounded honour and pride . How would Rosamond take it all ? Here was another weight of chain to drag , and poor Lydgate was in a bad mood for bearing her dumb mastery . He had no impulse to tell her the trouble which must soon be common to them both . He preferred waiting for the incidental disclosure which events must soon bring about . In Middlemarch a wife could not long remain ignorant that the town held a bad opinion of her husband . No feminine intimate might carry her friendship so far as to make a plain statement to the wife of the unpleasant fact known or believed about her husband ; but when a woman with her thoughts much at leisure got them suddenly employed on something grievously disadvantageous to her neighbors , various moral impulses were called into play which tended to stimulate utterance . Candor was one . To be candid , in Middlemarch phraseology , meant , to use an early opportunity of letting your friends know that you did not take a cheerful view of their capacity , their conduct , or their position ; and a robust candor never waited to be asked for its opinion . Then , again , there was the love of truth — a wide phrase , but meaning in this relation , a lively objection to seeing a wife look happier than her husband 's character warranted , or manifest too much satisfaction in her lot — the poor thing should have some hint given her that if she knew the truth she would have less complacency in her bonnet , and in light dishes for a supper - party . Stronger than all , there was the regard for a friend 's moral improvement , sometimes called her soul , which was likely to be benefited by remarks tending to gloom , uttered with the accompaniment of pensive staring at the furniture and a manner implying that the speaker would not tell what was on her mind , from regard to the feelings of her hearer . On the whole , one might say that an ardent charity was at work setting the virtuous mind to make a neighbor unhappy for her good . There were hardly any wives in Middlemarch whose matrimonial misfortunes would in different ways be likely to call forth more of this moral activity than Rosamond and her aunt Bulstrode . Mrs. Bulstrode was not an object of dislike , and had never consciously injured any human being . Men had always thought her a handsome comfortable woman , and had reckoned it among the signs of Bulstrode 's hypocrisy that he had chosen a red - blooded Vincy , instead of a ghastly and melancholy person suited to his low esteem for earthly pleasure . When the scandal about her husband was disclosed they remarked of her—"Ah
328915	328928	328901	328901	she	6216	" Women , who were intimate with her , talked together much of "
328932	329102	328930	328930	Harriet	338	" imagined what her feelings must be when she came to know everything , and conjectured how much she had already come to know . There was no spiteful disposition towards her ; rather , there was a busy benevolence anxious to ascertain what it would be well for her to feel and do under the circumstances , which of course kept the imagination occupied with her character and history from the times when she was Harriet Vincy till now . With the review of Mrs. Bulstrode and her position it was inevitable to associate Rosamond , whose prospects were under the same blight with her aunt 's . Rosamond was more severely criticised and less pitied , though she too , as one of the good old Vincy family who had always been known in Middlemarch , was regarded as a victim to marriage with an interloper . The Vincys had their weaknesses , but then they lay on the surface : there was never anything bad to be "

330361	330505	330338	330339	her aunt	9151	" Mrs. Plymdale was in a situation which caused her some complication of feeling . There had been not only her intimacy with Mrs. Bulstrode , but also a profitable business relation of the great Plymdale dyeing house with Mr. Bulstrode , which on the one hand would have inclined her to desire that the mildest view of his character should be the true one , but on the other , made her the more afraid of seeming to palliate his culpability . Again , the late alliance of her family with the Tollers had brought her in connection with the best circle , which gratified her in every direction except in the inclination to those serious views which she believed to be the best in another sense . The sharp little woman 's conscience was somewhat troubled in the adjustment of these opposing "
330508	330839	330338	330339	her aunt	9151	" and of her griefs and satisfactions under late events , which were likely to humble those who needed humbling , but also to fall heavily on her old friend whose faults she would have preferred seeing on a background of prosperity . Poor Mrs. Bulstrode , meanwhile , had been no further shaken by the oncoming tread of calamity than in the busier stirring of that secret uneasiness which had always been present in her since the last visit of Raffles to The Shrubs . That the hateful man had come ill to Stone Court , and that her husband had chosen to remain there and watch over him , she allowed to be explained by the fact that Raffles had been employed and aided in earlier - days , and that this made a tie of benevolence towards him in his degraded helplessness ; and she had been since then innocently cheered by her husband 's more hopeful speech about his own health and ability to continue his attention to business . The calm was disturbed when Lydgate had brought him home ill from the meeting , and in spite of comforting assurances during the next few days , she cried in private from the conviction that her husband was not suffering from bodily illness merely , but from something that afflicted his mind . He would not allow her to read to him , and scarcely to sit with him , alleging nervous susceptibility to sounds and movements ; yet she suspected that in shutting himself up in his private room he wanted to be busy with his papers . Something , she felt sure , had happened . Perhaps it was some great loss of money ; and she was kept in the dark . Not daring to question her husband , she said to Lydgate , on the fifth day after the meeting , when she had not left home except to go to church — "
330863	330864	330860	330861	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" "
330870	330890	330860	330861	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" said Lydgate , evasively . He felt that it was not for him to make the painful revelation . "
330897	330912	330338	330339	her aunt	9151	" said Mrs. Bulstrode , looking directly at him with her large dark eyes . "
330925	330929	330930	330931	Strong men	6269	" said Lydgate . "
330979	331232	331233	331233	I	0	" Mrs. Bulstrode was not satisfied with this answer . There remained in her the belief that some calamity had befallen her husband , of which she was to be kept in ignorance ; and it was in her nature strongly to object to such concealment . She begged leave for her daughters to sit with their father , and drove into the town to pay some visits , conjecturing that if anything were known to have gone wrong in Mr. Bulstrode 's affairs , she should see or hear some sign of it . She called on Mrs. Thesiger , who was not at home , and then drove to Mrs. Hackbutt 's on the other side of the churchyard . Mrs. Hackbutt saw her coming from an up - stairs window , and remembering her former alarm lest she should meet Mrs. Bulstrode , felt almost bound in consistency to send word that she was not at home ; but against that , there was a sudden strong desire within her for the excitement of an interview in which she was quite determined not to make the slightest allusion to what was in her mind . Hence Mrs. Bulstrode was shown into the drawing - room , and Mrs. Hackbutt went to her , with more tightness of lip and rubbing of her hands than was usually observable in her , these being precautions adopted against freedom of speech . She was resolved not to ask how Mr. Bulstrode was . "
331246	331257	331314	331315	Mr. Hackbutt	404	" said Mrs. Bulstrode , after a few introductory remarks . "
331280	331312	331271	331271	I	0	" Mrs. Hackbutt rubbed the back of one hand with the palm of the other held against her chest , and let her eyes ramble over the pattern on the rug . "
331320	331325	331328	331328	he	404	" persevered Mrs. Bulstrode . "
331331	331341	331328	331328	he	404	" said Mrs. Hackbutt , with the same attitude . "
331354	331355	331351	331351	I	0	" "
331374	331379	331351	331351	I	0	" said Mrs. Bulstrode . "
331427	331428	331429	331429	I	0	" "
331447	331457	331444	331445	Mrs. Bulstrode	778	" said Mrs. Hackbutt , with a slight sigh . "
331492	331499	331475	331475	I	0	" Mrs. Hackbutt longed to say , "
331512	331685	331501	331501	you	0	" but it seemed clear to her that the poor woman knew nothing of the thunder ready to bolt on her head , and she herself could do no more than prepare her a little . Mrs. Bulstrode felt suddenly rather chill and trembling : there was evidently something unusual behind this speech of Mrs. Hackbutt 's ; but though she had set out with the desire to be fully informed , she found herself unable now to pursue her brave purpose , and turning the conversation by an inquiry about the young Hackbutts , she soon took her leave saying that she was going to see Mrs. Plymdale . On her way thither she tried to imagine that there might have been some unusually warm sparring at the meeting between Mr. Bulstrode and some of his frequent opponents — perhaps Mr. Hackbutt might have been one of them . That would account for everything . But when she was in conversation with Mrs. Plymdale that comforting explanation seemed no longer tenable . "
331687	331855	331860	331860	you	6279	" received her with a pathetic affectionateness and a disposition to give edifying answers on the commonest topics , which could hardly have reference to an ordinary quarrel of which the most important consequence was a perturbation of Mr. Bulstrode 's health . Beforehand Mrs. Bulstrode had thought that she would sooner question Mrs. Plymdale than any one else ; but she found to her surprise that an old friend is not always the person whom it is easiest to make a confidant of : there was the barrier of remembered communication under other circumstances — there was the dislike of being pitied and informed by one who had been long wo nt to allow her the superiority . For certain words of mysterious appropriateness that Mrs. Plymdale let fall about her resolution never to turn her back on her friends , convinced Mrs. Bulstrode that what had happened must be some kind of misfortune , and instead of being able to say with her native directness , "
331866	332043	331860	331860	you	6279	" she found herself anxious to get away before she had heard anything more explicit . She began to have an agitating certainty that the misfortune was something more than the mere loss of money , being keenly sensitive to the fact that Selina now , just as Mrs. Hackbutt had done before , avoided noticing what she said about her husband , as they would have avoided noticing a personal blemish . She said good - by with nervous haste , and told the coachman to drive to Mr. Vincy 's warehouse . In that short drive her dread gathered so much force from the sense of darkness , that when she entered the private counting - house where her brother sat at his desk , her knees trembled and her usually florid face was deathly pale . Something of the same effect was produced in him by the sight of her : he rose from his seat to meet her , took her by the hand , and said , with his impulsive rashness — "
332054	332228	332050	332050	you	6280	" That moment was perhaps worse than any which came after . It contained that concentrated experience which in great crises of emotion reveals the bias of a nature , and is prophetic of the ultimate act which will end an intermediate struggle . Without that memory of Raffles she might still have thought only of monetary ruin , but now along with her brother 's look and words there darted into her mind the idea of some guilt in her husband — then , under the working of terror came the image of her husband exposed to disgrace — and then , after an instant of scorching shame in which she felt only the eyes of the world , with one leap of her heart she was at his side in mournful but unreproaching fellowship with shame and isolation . All this went on within her in a mere flash of time — while she sank into the chair , and raised her eyes to her brother , who stood over her . "
332239	332276	332277	332277	People	6815	" she said , faintly . He told her everything , very inartificially , in slow fragments , making her aware that the scandal went much beyond proof , especially as to the end of Raffles . "
332281	332285	332277	332277	People	6815	" he said . "
332382	332389	332380	332380	Rosamond	283	" Mrs. Bulstrode made no reply . "
332424	332437	332416	332416	you	6287	" said the brother , with rough but well - meaning affectionateness . "
332448	332453	332446	332446	Walter	475	" said Mrs. Bulstrode . "
332459	332474	332475	332475	I	0	" And when she got home she was obliged to say to her daughter , "
332506	333152	333156	333156	Nicholas	601	" She locked herself in her room . She needed time to get used to her maimed consciousness , her poor lopped life , before she could walk steadily to the place allotted her . A new searching light had fallen on her husband 's character , and she could not judge him leniently : the twenty years in which she had believed in him and venerated him by virtue of his concealments came back with particulars that made them seem an odious deceit . He had married her with that bad past life hidden behind him , and she had no faith left to protest his innocence of the worst that was imputed to him . Her honest ostentatious nature made the sharing of a merited dishonour as bitter as it could be to any mortal . But this imperfectly taught woman , whose phrases and habits were an odd patchwork , had a loyal spirit within her . The man whose prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life , and who had unvaryingly cherished her — now that punishment had befallen him it was not possible to her in any sense to forsake him . There is a forsaking which still sits at the same board and lies on the same couch with the forsaken soul , withering it the more by unloving proximity . She knew , when she locked her door , that she should unlock it ready to go down to her unhappy husband and espouse his sorrow , and say of his guilt , I will mourn and not reproach . But she needed time to gather up her strength ; she needed to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and pride of her life . When she had resolved to go down , she prepared herself by some little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker ; they were her way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she had begun a new life in which she embraced humiliation . She took off all her ornaments and put on a plain black gown , and instead of wearing her much - adorned cap and large bows of hair , she brushed her hair down and put on a plain bonnet - cap , which made her look suddenly like an early Methodist . Bulstrode , who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying that she was not well , had spent the time in an agitation equal to hers . He had looked forward to her learning the truth from others , and had acquiesced in that probability , as something easier to him than any confession . But now that he imagined the moment of her knowledge come , he awaited the result in anguish . His daughters had been obliged to consent to leave him , and though he had allowed some food to be brought to him , he had not touched it . He felt himself perishing slowly in unpitied misery . Perhaps he should never see his wife 's face with affection in it again . And if he turned to God there seemed to be no answer but the pressure of retribution . It was eight o'clock in the evening before the door opened and his wife entered . He dared not look up at her . He sat with his eyes bent down , and as she went towards him she thought he looked smaller — he seemed so withered and shrunken . A movement of new compassion and old tenderness went through her like a great wave , and putting one hand on his which rested on the arm of the chair , and the other on his shoulder , she said , solemnly but kindly — "
333158	333196	333156	333156	Nicholas	601	" He raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half amazed for a moment : her pale face , her changed , mourning dress , the trembling about her mouth , all said , "
333200	333305	333156	333156	Nicholas	601	" and her hands and eyes rested gently on him . He burst out crying and they cried together , she sitting at his side . They could not yet speak to each other of the shame which she was bearing with him , or of the acts which had brought it down on them . His confession was silent , and her promise of faithfulness was silent . Open - minded as she was , she nevertheless shrank from the words which would have expressed their mutual consciousness , as she would have shrunk from flakes of fire . She could not say , "
333315	333322	333323	333323	I	0	" and he did not say , "
333327	334302	333323	333323	I	0	" Rosamond had a gleam of returning cheerfulness when the house was freed from the threatening figure , and when all the disagreeable creditors were paid . But she was not joyous : her married life had fulfilled none of her hopes , and had been quite spoiled for her imagination . In this brief interval of calm , Lydgate , remembering that he had often been stormy in his hours of perturbation , and mindful of the pain Rosamond had had to bear , was carefully gentle towards her ; but he , too , had lost some of his old spirit , and he still felt it necessary to refer to an economical change in their way of living as a matter of course , trying to reconcile her to it gradually , and repressing his anger when she answered by wishing that he would go to live in London . When she did not make this answer , she listened languidly , and wondered what she had that was worth living for . The hard and contemptuous words which had fallen from her husband in his anger had deeply offended that vanity which he had at first called into active enjoyment ; and what she regarded as his perverse way of looking at things , kept up a secret repulsion , which made her receive all his tenderness as a poor substitute for the happiness he had failed to give her . They were at a disadvantage with their neighbors , and there was no longer any outlook towards Quallingham — there was no outlook anywhere except in an occasional letter from Will Ladislaw . She had felt stung and disappointed by Will 's resolution to quit Middlemarch , for in spite of what she knew and guessed about his admiration for Dorothea , she secretly cherished the belief that he had , or would necessarily come to have , much more admiration for herself ; Rosamond being one of those women who live much in the idea that each man they meet would have preferred them if the preference had not been hopeless . Mrs. Casaubon was all very well ; but Will 's interest in her dated before he knew Mrs. Lydgate . Rosamond took his way of talking to herself , which was a mixture of playful fault - finding and hyperbolical gallantry , as the disguise of a deeper feeling ; and in his presence she felt that agreeable titillation of vanity and sense of romantic drama which Lydgate 's presence had no longer the magic to create . She even fancied — what will not men and women fancy in these matters?—that Will exaggerated his admiration for Mrs. Casaubon in order to pique herself . In this way poor Rosamond 's brain had been busy before Will 's departure . He would have made , she thought , a much more suitable husband for her than she had found in Lydgate . No notion could have been falser than this , for Rosamond 's discontent in her marriage was due to the conditions of marriage itself , to its demand for self - suppression and tolerance , and not to the nature of her husband ; but the easy conception of an unreal Better had a sentimental charm which diverted her ennui . She constructed a little romance which was to vary the flatness of her life : Will Ladislaw was always to be a bachelor and live near her , always to be at her command , and have an understood though never fully expressed passion for her , which would be sending out lambent flames every now and then in interesting scenes . His departure had been a proportionate disappointment , and had sadly increased her weariness of Middlemarch ; but at first she had the alternative dream of pleasures in store from her intercourse with the family at Quallingham . Since then the troubles of her married life had deepened , and the absence of other relief encouraged her regretful rumination over that thin romance which she had once fed on . Men and women make sad mistakes about their own symptoms , taking their vague uneasy longings , sometimes for genius , sometimes for religion , and oftener still for a mighty love . Will Ladislaw had written chatty letters , half to her and half to Lydgate , and she had replied : their separation , she felt , was not likely to be final , and the change she now most longed for was that Lydgate should go to live in London ; everything would be agreeable in London ; and she had set to work with quiet determination to win this result , when there came a sudden , delightful promise which inspirited her . It came shortly before the memorable meeting at the town - hall , and was nothing less than a letter from Will Ladislaw to Lydgate , which turned indeed chiefly on his new interest in plans of colonization , but mentioned incidentally , that he might find it necessary to pay a visit to Middlemarch within the next few weeks — a very pleasant necessity , he said , almost as good as holidays to a schoolboy . He hoped there was his old place on the rug , and a great deal of music in store for him . But he was quite uncertain as to the time . While Lydgate was reading the letter to Rosamond , her face looked like a reviving flower — it grew prettier and more blooming . There was nothing unendurable now : the debts were paid , Mr. Ladislaw was coming , and Lydgate would be persuaded to leave Middlemarch and settle in London , which was "
334310	334546	333323	333323	I	0	" That was a bright bit of morning . But soon the sky became black over poor Rosamond . The presence of a new gloom in her husband , about which he was entirely reserved towards her — for he dreaded to expose his lacerated feeling to her neutrality and misconception — soon received a painfully strange explanation , alien to all her previous notions of what could affect her happiness . In the new gayety of her spirits , thinking that Lydgate had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual , causing him to leave her remarks unanswered , and evidently to keep out of her way as much as possible , she chose , a few days after the meeting , and without speaking to him on the subject , to send out notes of invitation for a small evening party , feeling convinced that this was a judicious step , since people seemed to have been keeping aloof from them , and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse . When the invitations had been accepted , she would tell Lydgate , and give him a wise admonition as to how a medical man should behave to his neighbors ; for Rosamond had the gravest little airs possible about other people 's duties . But all the invitations were declined , and the last answer came into Lydgate 's hands . "
334561	334594	334555	334555	he	275	" said Lydgate , wonderingly , as he handed the note to her . She was obliged to let him see it , and , looking at her severely , he said — "
334640	334645	334649	334649	me	0	" She said nothing . "
334651	334655	334649	334649	me	0	" thundered Lydgate . "
334663	334897	334661	334661	you	0	" said Rosamond , turning her head aside with the movement of a graceful long - necked bird . Lydgate tossed his head without any grace and walked out of the room , feeling himself dangerous . Rosamond 's thought was , that he was getting more and more unbearable — not that there was any new special reason for this peremptoriness . His indisposition to tell her anything in which he was sure beforehand that she would not be interested was growing into an unreflecting habit , and she was in ignorance of everything connected with the thousand pounds except that the loan had come from her uncle Bulstrode . Lydgate 's odious humors and their neighbors ' apparent avoidance of them had an unaccountable date for her in their relief from money difficulties . If the invitations had been accepted she would have gone to invite her mamma and the rest , whom she had seen nothing of for several days ; and she now put on her bonnet to go and inquire what had become of them all , suddenly feeling as if there were a conspiracy to leave her in isolation with a husband disposed to offend everybody . It was after the dinner hour , and she found her father and mother seated together alone in the drawing - room . They greeted her with sad looks , saying "
334903	334926	334661	334661	you	0	" and no more . She had never seen her father look so downcast ; and seating herself near him she said — "
334935	334946	334933	334933	papa	7515	" He did not answer , but Mrs. Vincy said , "
334967	334968	334933	334933	papa	7515	" "
334975	334999	334973	334973	Tertius	300	" said Rosamond , turning pale . The idea of trouble immediately connected itself with what had been unaccountable to her in him . "
335027	335028	335033	335033	Lucy	469	" "
335035	335040	335033	335033	Lucy	469	" said Mr. Vincy . "
335052	335053	335056	335056	papa	7515	" "
335058	335103	335056	335056	papa	7515	" said the poor thing , feeling as if trouble were not anything she had before experienced , but some invisible power with an iron grasp that made her soul faint within her . Her father told her everything , saying at the end , "
335147	335326	335138	335138	I	0	" said Mr. Vincy . He had always before been disposed to find the utmost fault with Lydgate . The shock to Rosamond was terrible . It seemed to her that no lot could be so cruelly hard as hers to have married a man who had become the centre of infamous suspicions . In many cases it is inevitable that the shame is felt to be the worst part of crime ; and it would have required a great deal of disentangling reflection , such as had never entered into Rosamond 's life , for her in these moments to feel that her trouble was less than if her husband had been certainly known to have done something criminal . All the shame seemed to be there . And she had innocently married this man with the belief that he and his family were a glory to her ! She showed her usual reticence to her parents , and only said , that if Lydgate had done as she wished he would have left Middlemarch long ago . "
335333	335342	335327	335327	She	6307	" said her mother when she was gone . "
335348	335656	335327	335327	She	6307	" said Mr. Vincy , who was much broken down . But Rosamond went home with a sense of justified repugnance towards her husband . What had he really done — how had he really acted ? She did not know . Why had he not told her everything ? He did not speak to her on the subject , and of course she could not speak to him . It came into her mind once that she would ask her father to let her go home again ; but dwelling on that prospect made it seem utter dreariness to her : a married woman gone back to live with her parents — life seemed to have no meaning for her in such a position : she could not contemplate herself in it . The next two days Lydgate observed a change in her , and believed that she had heard the bad news . Would she speak to him about it , or would she go on forever in the silence which seemed to imply that she believed him guilty ? We must remember that he was in a morbid state of mind , in which almost all contact was pain . Certainly Rosamond in this case had equal reason to complain of reserve and want of confidence on his part ; but in the bitterness of his soul he excused himself;—was he not justified in shrinking from the task of telling her , since now she knew the truth she had no impulse to speak to him ? But a deeper - lying consciousness that he was in fault made him restless , and the silence between them became intolerable to him ; it was as if they were both adrift on one piece of wreck and looked away from each other . He thought , "
335678	335685	335670	335670	I	0	" And that evening he said — "
335696	335697	335689	335689	you	283	" "
335700	335728	335689	335689	you	283	" she answered , laying down her work , which she had been carrying on with a languid semi - consciousness , most unlike her usual self . "
335734	335735	335731	335731	you	283	" "
335745	335746	335741	335741	Papa	254	" "
335753	335754	335748	335748	people	6815	" "
335757	335776	335748	335748	people	6815	" said Rosamond , faintly , beginning to sew again automatically . There was silence . Lydgate thought , "
335809	336339	335800	335800	she	6310	" But Rosamond on her side went on moving her fingers languidly . Whatever was to be said on the subject she expected to come from Tertius . What did she know ? And if he were innocent of any wrong , why did he not do something to clear himself ? This silence of hers brought a new rush of gall to that bitter mood in which Lydgate had been saying to himself that nobody believed in him — even Farebrother had not come forward . He had begun to question her with the intent that their conversation should disperse the chill fog which had gathered between them , but he felt his resolution checked by despairing resentment . Even this trouble , like the rest , she seemed to regard as if it were hers alone . He was always to her a being apart , doing what she objected to . He started from his chair with an angry impulse , and thrusting his hands in his pockets , walked up and down the room . There was an underlying consciousness all the while that he should have to master this anger , and tell her everything , and convince her of the facts . For he had almost learned the lesson that he must bend himself to her nature , and that because she came short in her sympathy , he must give the more . Soon he recurred to his intention of opening himself : the occasion must not be lost . If he could bring her to feel with some solemnity that here was a slander which must be met and not run away from , and that the whole trouble had come out of his desperate want of money , it would be a moment for urging powerfully on her that they should be one in the resolve to do with as little money as possible , so that they might weather the bad time and keep themselves independent . He would mention the definite measures which he desired to take , and win her to a willing spirit . He was bound to try this — and what else was there for him to do ? He did not know how long he had been walking uneasily backwards and forwards , but Rosamond felt that it was long , and wished that he would sit down . She too had begun to think this an opportunity for urging on Tertius what he ought to do . Whatever might be the truth about all this misery , there was one dread which asserted itself . Lydgate at last seated himself , not in his usual chair , but in one nearer to Rosamond , leaning aside in it towards her , and looking at her gravely before he reopened the sad subject . He had conquered himself so far , and was about to speak with a sense of solemnity , as on an occasion which was not to be repeated . He had even opened his lips , when Rosamond , letting her hands fall , looked at him and said — "
336344	336345	336342	336342	Tertius	300	" "
336348	336349	336342	336342	Tertius	300	" "
336409	336800	336801	336801	Your	6314	" Lydgate felt miserably jarred . Instead of that critical outpouring for which he had prepared himself with effort , here was the old round to be gone through again . He could not bear it . With a quick change of countenance he rose and went out of the room . Perhaps if he had been strong enough to persist in his determination to be the more because she was less , that evening might have had a better issue . If his energy could have borne down that check , he might still have wrought on Rosamond 's vision and will . We can not be sure that any natures , however inflexible or peculiar , will resist this effect from a more massive being than their own . They may be taken by storm and for the moment converted , becoming part of the soul which enwraps them in the ardor of its movement . But poor Lydgate had a throbbing pain within him , and his energy had fallen short of its task . The beginning of mutual understanding and resolve seemed as far off as ever ; nay , it seemed blocked out by the sense of unsuccessful effort . They lived on from day to day with their thoughts still apart , Lydgate going about what work he had in a mood of despair , and Rosamond feeling , with some justification , that he was behaving cruelly . It was of no use to say anything to Tertius ; but when Will Ladislaw came , she was determined to tell him everything . In spite of her general reticence , she needed some one who would recognize her wrongs . Some days later , Lydgate was riding to Lowick Manor , in consequence of a summons from Dorothea . The summons had not been unexpected , since it had followed a letter from Mr. Bulstrode , in which he stated that he had resumed his arrangements for quitting Middlemarch , and must remind Lydgate of his previous communications about the Hospital , to the purport of which he still adhered . It had been his duty , before taking further steps , to reopen the subject with Mrs. Casaubon , who now wished , as before , to discuss the question with Lydgate . "
336810	336815	336801	336801	Your	6314	" wrote Mr. Bulstrode ; "
336834	336861	336827	336827	you	6314	" Dorothea awaited his arrival with eager interest . Though , in deference to her masculine advisers , she had refrained from what Sir James had called "
336868	336951	336827	336827	you	6314	" the hardship of Lydgate 's position was continually in her mind , and when Bulstrode applied to her again about the hospital , she felt that the opportunity was come to her which she had been hindered from hastening . In her luxurious home , wandering under the boughs of her own great trees , her thought was going out over the lot of others , and her emotions were imprisoned . The idea of some active good within her reach , "
336958	337286	336827	336827	you	6314	" and another 's need having once come to her as a distinct image , preoccupied her desire with the yearning to give relief , and made her own ease tasteless . She was full of confident hope about this interview with Lydgate , never heeding what was said of his personal reserve ; never heeding that she was a very young woman . Nothing could have seemed more irrelevant to Dorothea than insistence on her youth and sex when she was moved to show her human fellowship . As she sat waiting in the library , she could do nothing but live through again all the past scenes which had brought Lydgate into her memories . They all owed their significance to her marriage and its troubles — but no ; there were two occasions in which the image of Lydgate had come painfully in connection with his wife and some one else . The pain had been allayed for Dorothea , but it had left in her an awakened conjecture as to what Lydgate 's marriage might be to him , a susceptibility to the slightest hint about Mrs. Lydgate . These thoughts were like a drama to her , and made her eyes bright , and gave an attitude of suspense to her whole frame , though she was only looking out from the brown library on to the turf and the bright green buds which stood in relief against the dark evergreens . When Lydgate came in , she was almost shocked at the change in his face , which was strikingly perceptible to her who had not seen him for two months . It was not the change of emaciation , but that effect which even young faces will very soon show from the persistent presence of resentment and despondency . Her cordial look , when she put out her hand to him , softened his expression , but only with melancholy . "
337303	337314	337294	337294	you	6317	" said Dorothea when they were seated opposite each other ; "
337393	337394	337381	337381	you	6317	" "
337410	337414	337415	337415	I	0	" said Lydgate . "
337441	337469	337432	337432	I	0	" He spoke curtly , feeling the ache of despair as to his being able to carry out any purpose that Rosamond had set her mind against . "
337481	337496	337497	337497	I	0	" said Dorothea , pouring out her words in clearness from a full heart . "
337530	337557	337523	337523	You	0	" It was the first assurance of belief in him that had fallen on Lydgate 's ears . He drew a deep breath , and said , "
337561	337594	337559	337559	you	0	" He could say no more : it was something very new and strange in his life that these few words of trust from a woman should be so much to him . "
337605	337611	337597	337597	you	0	" said Dorothea , fearlessly . "
337622	337714	337612	337612	I	0	" Lydgate started up from his chair and went towards the window , forgetting where he was . He had so often gone over in his mind the possibility of explaining everything without aggravating appearances that would tell , perhaps unfairly , against Bulstrode , and had so often decided against it — he had so often said to himself that his assertions would not change people 's impressions — that Dorothea 's words sounded like a temptation to do something which in his soberness he had pronounced to be unreasonable . "
337720	337728	337612	337612	I	0	" said Dorothea , with simple earnestness ; "
337754	337888	337889	337889	I	0	" Lydgate turned , remembering where he was , and saw Dorothea 's face looking up at him with a sweet trustful gravity . The presence of a noble nature , generous in its wishes , ardent in its charity , changes the lights for us : we begin to see things again in their larger , quieter masses , and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in the wholeness of our character . That influence was beginning to act on Lydgate , who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is dragged and struggling amid the throng . He sat down again , and felt that he was recovering his old self in the consciousness that he was with one who believed in it . "
337894	337898	337889	337889	I	0	" he said , "
338002	338003	337994	337994	you	6325	" "
338008	338012	338013	338013	I	0	" said Dorothea ; "
338139	338345	338132	338132	I	0	" Dorothea 's voice , as she made this childlike picture of what she would do , might have been almost taken as a proof that she could do it effectively . The searching tenderness of her woman 's tones seemed made for a defence against ready accusers . Lydgate did not stay to think that she was Quixotic : he gave himself up , for the first time in his life , to the exquisite sense of leaning entirely on a generous sympathy , without any check of proud reserve . And he told her everything , from the time when , under the pressure of his difficulties , he unwillingly made his first application to Bulstrode ; gradually , in the relief of speaking , getting into a more thorough utterance of what had gone on in his mind — entering fully into the fact that his treatment of the patient was opposed to the dominant practice , into his doubts at the last , his ideal of medical duty , and his uneasy consciousness that the acceptance of the money had made some difference in his private inclination and professional behavior , though not in his fulfilment of any publicly recognized obligation . "
338354	338358	338132	338132	I	0	" he added , "
338647	338648	338612	338612	Bulstrode	274	" "
338655	338659	338612	338612	Bulstrode	274	" said Dorothea . "
338762	338763	338719	338719	you	6338	" "
338766	338785	338719	338719	you	6338	" said Lydgate , feeling that here he had found room for the full meaning of his grief . "
338823	338824	338800	338800	I	0	" "
338827	338831	338800	338800	I	0	" said Dorothea , meditatively,—"suppose
338926	338934	338918	338918	we	6341	" she ended , with a smile . "
338947	338953	338939	338939	I	0	" said Lydgate , mournfully . "
339000	339001	338983	338984	any one	976	" "
339010	339016	339029	339029	they	6348	" said Dorothea , simply . "
339204	339286	339287	339287	I	0	" A smile broke through the gloom of Lydgate 's face . The childlike grave - eyed earnestness with which Dorothea said all this was irresistible — blent into an adorable whole with her ready understanding of high experience . ( Of lower experience such as plays a great part in the world , poor Mrs. Casaubon had a very blurred shortsighted knowledge , little helped by her imagination . ) But she took the smile as encouragement of her plan . "
339298	339308	339293	339293	you	6352	" she said , in a tone of persuasion . "
339329	339337	339338	339338	You	6352	" Lydgate 's smile had died away . "
339358	339362	339338	339338	You	6352	" he said . "
339365	339395	339398	339398	I	0	" He hesitated a little while , looking vaguely towards the window ; and she sat in silent expectation . At last he turned towards her and said impetuously — "
339415	339445	339410	339410	You	6352	" Dorothea felt her heart beginning to beat faster . Had he that sorrow too ? But she feared to say any word , and he went on immediately . "
339519	339520	339521	339521	I	0	" "
339543	339555	339527	339527	you	0	" said Dorothea , with keen memory of her own life . "
339580	339595	339578	339578	her	2072	" said Lydgate , breaking off again , lest he should say too much . "
339608	339636	339598	339598	she	2072	" said Dorothea , remonstrantly , looking at Lydgate as if he had forgotten the reasons which had just been considered . He did not speak immediately . "
339643	339662	339637	339637	She	2072	" he said at last , curtly , feeling at first that this statement must do without explanation . "
339679	339705	339667	339667	I	0	" He paused a moment and then , following the impulse to let Dorothea see deeper into the difficulty of his life , he said , "
339773	339774	339767	339767	I	0	" "
339782	339788	339776	339776	I	0	" said Dorothea , eagerly . "
339852	339853	339849	339849	her	2072	" "
339860	339871	339872	339872	She	2072	" said Lydgate , seizing the proposition with some hope . "
339938	340006	340025	340025	she	604	" He broke off , and there was a moment 's silence . Dorothea refrained from saying what was in her mind — how well she knew that there might be invisible barriers to speech between husband and wife . This was a point on which even sympathy might make a wound . She returned to the more outward aspect of Lydgate 's position , saying cheerfully — "
340092	340108	340109	340109	You	6358	" Lydgate did not answer , and she saw that he was debating with himself . "
340115	340121	340109	340109	You	6358	" she said , gently . "
340141	340158	340138	340139	Mr. Bulstrode	274	" Lydgate still waited , but at last turned to speak in his most decisive tones . "
340312	340317	340318	340318	I	0	" he ended bitterly . "
340332	340333	340318	340318	I	0	" "
340346	340350	340341	340341	you	0	" said Dorothea . "

340452	340487	340447	340447	you	6364	" said Lydgate , rising as if with the same impulse that made his words energetic , and resting his arm on the back of the great leather chair he had been sitting in . "
340681	340682	340668	340668	I	0	" "
340689	340691	340668	340668	I	0	" said Dorothea,—"to

340706	340710	340668	340668	I	0	" said Lydgate , "
340721	340728	340713	340714	a man	846	" Then , in another tone , "
340828	340829	340818	340818	You	6380	" "
340839	340843	340835	340835	others	1056	" said Dorothea . "

340873	340886	340868	340868	I	0	" said Lydgate , with something like a groan in his voice . "
340926	340927	340909	340909	You	6380	" "
340940	340955	340937	340937	she	2072	" said Dorothea , into whose mind every impression about Rosamond had cut deep . "
340963	340972	340958	340958	she	2072	" As Lydgate rode away , he thought , "
341123	341353	341112	341112	her	2072	" Dorothea on her side had immediately formed a plan of relieving Lydgate from his obligation to Bulstrode , which she felt sure was a part , though small , of the galling pressure he had to bear . She sat down at once under the inspiration of their interview , and wrote a brief note , in which she pleaded that she had more claim than Mr. Bulstrode had to the satisfaction of providing the money which had been serviceable to Lydgate — that it would be unkind in Lydgate not to grant her the position of being his helper in this small matter , the favour being entirely to her who had so little that was plainly marked out for her to do with her superfluous money . He might call her a creditor or by any other name if it did but imply that he granted her request . She enclosed a check for a thousand pounds , and determined to take the letter with her the next day when she went to see Rosamond . The next day Lydgate had to go to Brassing , and told Rosamond that he should be away until the evening . Of late she had never gone beyond her own house and garden , except to church , and once to see her papa , to whom she said , "
341392	341399	341386	341387	some one	1163	" And Mr. Vincy had said , "
341421	341812	341413	341413	I	0	" With these exceptions she had sat at home in languid melancholy and suspense , fixing her mind on Will Ladislaw 's coming as the one point of hope and interest , and associating this with some new urgency on Lydgate to make immediate arrangements for leaving Middlemarch and going to London , till she felt assured that the coming would be a potent cause of the going , without at all seeing how . This way of establishing sequences is too common to be fairly regarded as a peculiar folly in Rosamond . And it is precisely this sort of sequence which causes the greatest shock when it is sundered : for to see how an effect may be produced is often to see possible missings and checks ; but to see nothing except the desirable cause , and close upon it the desirable effect , rids us of doubt and makes our minds strongly intuitive . That was the process going on in poor Rosamond , while she arranged all objects around her with the same nicety as ever , only with more slowness — or sat down to the piano , meaning to play , and then desisting , yet lingering on the music stool with her white fingers suspended on the wooden front , and looking before her in dreamy ennui . Her melancholy had become so marked that Lydgate felt a strange timidity before it , as a perpetual silent reproach , and the strong man , mastered by his keen sensibilities towards this fair fragile creature whose life he seemed somehow to have bruised , shrank from her look , and sometimes started at her approach , fear of her and fear for her rushing in only the more forcibly after it had been momentarily expelled by exasperation . But this morning Rosamond descended from her room upstairs — where she sometimes sat the whole day when Lydgate was out — equipped for a walk in the town . She had a letter to post — a letter addressed to Mr. Ladislaw and written with charming discretion , but intended to hasten his arrival by a hint of trouble . The servant - maid , their sole house - servant now , noticed her coming down - stairs in her walking dress , and thought "
341826	342201	341816	341816	anybody	2191	" Meanwhile Dorothea 's mind was filled with her project of going to Rosamond , and with the many thoughts , both of the past and the probable future , which gathered round the idea of that visit . Until yesterday when Lydgate had opened to her a glimpse of some trouble in his married life , the image of Mrs. Lydgate had always been associated for her with that of Will Ladislaw . Even in her most uneasy moments — even when she had been agitated by Mrs. Cadwallader 's painfully graphic report of gossip — her effort , nay , her strongest impulsive prompting , had been towards the vindication of Will from any sullying surmises ; and when , in her meeting with him afterwards , she had at first interpreted his words as a probable allusion to a feeling towards Mrs. Lydgate which he was determined to cut himself off from indulging , she had had a quick , sad , excusing vision of the charm there might be in his constant opportunities of companionship with that fair creature , who most likely shared his other tastes as she evidently did his delight in music . But there had followed his parting words — the few passionate words in which he had implied that she herself was the object of whom his love held him in dread , that it was his love for her only which he was resolved not to declare but to carry away into banishment . From the time of that parting , Dorothea , believing in Will 's love for her , believing with a proud delight in his delicate sense of honour and his determination that no one should impeach him justly , felt her heart quite at rest as to the regard he might have for Mrs. Lydgate . She was sure that the regard was blameless . There are natures in which , if they love us , we are conscious of having a sort of baptism and consecration : they bind us over to rectitude and purity by their pure belief about us ; and our sins become that worst kind of sacrilege which tears down the invisible altar of trust . "
342210	342533	342534	342535	Young Ladislaw	262	good"—those little words may give a terrific meaning to responsibility , may hold a vitriolic intensity for remorse . Dorothea 's nature was of that kind : her own passionate faults lay along the easily counted open channels of her ardent character ; and while she was full of pity for the visible mistakes of others , she had not yet any material within her experience for subtle constructions and suspicions of hidden wrong . But that simplicity of hers , holding up an ideal for others in her believing conception of them , was one of the great powers of her womanhood . And it had from the first acted strongly on Will Ladislaw . He felt , when he parted from her , that the brief words by which he had tried to convey to her his feeling about herself and the division which her fortune made between them , would only profit by their brevity when Dorothea had to interpret them : he felt that in her mind he had found his highest estimate . And he was right there . In the months since their parting Dorothea had felt a delicious though sad repose in their relation to each other , as one which was inwardly whole and without blemish . She had an active force of antagonism within her , when the antagonism turned on the defence either of plans or persons that she believed in ; and the wrongs which she felt that Will had received from her husband , and the external conditions which to others were grounds for slighting him , only gave the more tenacity to her affection and admiring judgment . And now with the disclosures about Bulstrode had come another fact affecting Will 's social position , which roused afresh Dorothea 's inward resistance to what was said about him in that part of her world which lay within park palings . "
342543	342581	342534	342535	Young Ladislaw	262	" was a phrase which had entered emphatically into the dialogues about the Bulstrode business , at Lowick , Tipton , and Freshitt , and was a worse kind of placard on poor Will 's back than the "
342587	342907	342534	342535	Young Ladislaw	262	" Upright Sir James Chettam was convinced that his own satisfaction was righteous when he thought with some complacency that here was an added league to that mountainous distance between Ladislaw and Dorothea , which enabled him to dismiss any anxiety in that direction as too absurd . And perhaps there had been some pleasure in pointing Mr. Brooke 's attention to this ugly bit of Ladislaw 's genealogy , as a fresh candle for him to see his own folly by . Dorothea had observed the animus with which Will 's part in the painful story had been recalled more than once ; but she had uttered no word , being checked now , as she had not been formerly in speaking of Will , by the consciousness of a deeper relation between them which must always remain in consecrated secrecy . But her silence shrouded her resistant emotion into a more thorough glow ; and this misfortune in Will 's lot which , it seemed , others were wishing to fling at his back as an opprobrium , only gave something more of enthusiasm to her clinging thought . She entertained no visions of their ever coming into nearer union , and yet she had taken no posture of renunciation . She had accepted her whole relation to Will very simply as part of her marriage sorrows , and would have thought it very sinful in her to keep up an inward wail because she was not completely happy , being rather disposed to dwell on the superfluities of her lot . She could bear that the chief pleasures of her tenderness should lie in memory , and the idea of marriage came to her solely as a repulsive proposition from some suitor of whom she at present knew nothing , but whose merits , as seen by her friends , would be a source of torment to her:—"somebody
342919	342930	342534	342535	Young Ladislaw	262	" was Mr. Brooke 's attractive suggestion of suitable characteristics . "
342948	343140	342940	342940	I	0	" said Dorothea . No — she adhered to her declaration that she would never be married again , and in the long valley of her life which looked so flat and empty of waymarks , guidance would come as she walked along the road , and saw her fellow - passengers by the way . This habitual state of feeling about Will Ladislaw had been strong in all her waking hours since she had proposed to pay a visit to Mrs. Lydgate , making a sort of background against which she saw Rosamond 's figure presented to her without hindrances to her interest and compassion . There was evidently some mental separation , some barrier to complete confidence which had arisen between this wife and the husband who had yet made her happiness a law to him . That was a trouble which no third person must directly touch . But Dorothea thought with deep pity of the loneliness which must have come upon Rosamond from the suspicions cast on her husband ; and there would surely be help in the manifestation of respect for Lydgate and sympathy with her . "
343150	343223	343141	343141	I	0	" thought Dorothea , as she was being driven towards the town . The clear spring morning , the scent of the moist earth , the fresh leaves just showing their creased - up wealth of greenery from out their half - opened sheaths , seemed part of the cheerfulness she was feeling from a long conversation with Mr. Farebrother , who had joyfully accepted the justifying explanation of Lydgate 's conduct . "
343248	343339	343234	343234	she	6404	" Dorothea had another errand in Lowick Gate : it was about a new fine - toned bell for the school - house , and as she had to get out of her carriage very near to Lydgate 's , she walked thither across the street , having told the coachman to wait for some packages . The street door was open , and the servant was taking the opportunity of looking out at the carriage which was pausing within sight when it became apparent to her that the lady who "
343343	343349	343404	343404	mum	6410	" was coming towards her . "
343356	343360	343351	343352	Mrs. Lydgate	604	" said Dorothea . "
343381	343403	343404	343404	mum	6410	" said Martha , a little confused on the score of her kitchen apron , but collected enough to be sure that "
343405	343422	343424	343424	you	6409	" was not the right title for this queenly young widow with a carriage and pair . "
343437	343438	343424	343424	you	6409	" "
343446	343844	343441	343441	I	0	" said Dorothea , as Martha moved forward intending to show her into the drawing - room and then to go up - stairs to see if Rosamond had returned from her walk . They crossed the broader part of the entrance - hall , and turned up the passage which led to the garden . The drawing - room door was unlatched , and Martha , pushing it without looking into the room , waited for Mrs. Casaubon to enter and then turned away , the door having swung open and swung back again without noise . Dorothea had less of outward vision than usual this morning , being filled with images of things as they had been and were going to be . She found herself on the other side of the door without seeing anything remarkable , but immediately she heard a voice speaking in low tones which startled her as with a sense of dreaming in daylight , and advancing unconsciously a step or two beyond the projecting slab of a bookcase , she saw , in the terrible illumination of a certainty which filled up all outlines , something which made her pause , motionless , without self - possession enough to speak . Seated with his back towards her on a sofa which stood against the wall on a line with the door by which she had entered , she saw Will Ladislaw : close by him and turned towards him with a flushed tearfulness which gave a new brilliancy to her face sat Rosamond , her bonnet hanging back , while Will leaning towards her clasped both her upraised hands in his and spoke with low - toned fervor . Rosamond in her agitated absorption had not noticed the silently advancing figure ; but when Dorothea , after the first immeasurable instant of this vision , moved confusedly backward and found herself impeded by some piece of furniture , Rosamond was suddenly aware of her presence , and with a spasmodic movement snatched away her hands and rose , looking at Dorothea who was necessarily arrested . Will Ladislaw , starting up , looked round also , and meeting Dorothea 's eyes with a new lightning in them , seemed changing to marble . But she immediately turned them away from him to Rosamond and said in a firm voice — "
343882	343978	343873	343873	I	0	" She laid down the letter on the small table which had checked her retreat , and then including Rosamond and Will in one distant glance and bow , she went quickly out of the room , meeting in the passage the surprised Martha , who said she was sorry the mistress was not at home , and then showed the strange lady out with an inward reflection that grand people were probably more impatient than others . Dorothea walked across the street with her most elastic step and was quickly in her carriage again . "
343985	344209	344210	344210	Dodo	184	" she said to the coachman , and any one looking at her might have thought that though she was paler than usual she was never animated by a more self - possessed energy . And that was really her experience . It was as if she had drunk a great draught of scorn that stimulated her beyond the susceptibility to other feelings . She had seen something so far below her belief , that her emotions rushed back from it and made an excited throng without an object . She needed something active to turn her excitement out upon . She felt power to walk and work for a day , without meat or drink . And she would carry out the purpose with which she had started in the morning , of going to Freshitt and Tipton to tell Sir James and her uncle all that she wished them to know about Lydgate , whose married loneliness under his trial now presented itself to her with new significance , and made her more ardent in readiness to be his champion . She had never felt anything like this triumphant power of indignation in the struggle of her married life , in which there had always been a quickly subduing pang ; and she took it as a sign of new strength . "
344219	344233	344210	344210	Dodo	184	" said Celia , when Sir James was gone out of the room . "
344272	344284	344263	344264	Mr. Lydgate	278	" Celia had been used to watch her sister with expectation . "
344296	344305	344263	344264	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Dodo , in her full tones . "
344310	344324	344263	344264	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Celia , folding her arms cozily and leaning forward upon them . "
344340	344354	344263	344264	Mr. Lydgate	278	" said Dorothea , lifting her arms to the back of her head . "
344370	344641	344361	344361	you	184	" said Celia , a little uneasy at this Hamlet - like raving . But Sir James came in again , ready to accompany Dorothea to the Grange , and she finished her expedition well , not swerving in her resolution until she descended at her own door . Rosamond and Will stood motionless — they did not know how long — he looking towards the spot where Dorothea had stood , and she looking towards him with doubt . It seemed an endless time to Rosamond , in whose inmost soul there was hardly so much annoyance as gratification from what had just happened . Shallow natures dream of an easy sway over the emotions of others , trusting implicitly in their own petty magic to turn the deepest streams , and confident , by pretty gestures and remarks , of making the thing that is not as though it were . She knew that Will had received a severe blow , but she had been little used to imagining other people 's states of mind except as a material cut into shape by her own wishes ; and she believed in her own power to soothe or subdue . Even Tertius , that most perverse of men , was always subdued in the long - run : events had been obstinate , but still Rosamond would have said now , as she did before her marriage , that she never gave up what she had set her mind on . She put out her arm and laid the tips of her fingers on Will 's coat - sleeve . "
344647	344931	344361	344361	you	184	" he said , with an utterance like the cut of a lash , darting from her , and changing from pink to white and back again , as if his whole frame were tingling with the pain of the sting . He wheeled round to the other side of the room and stood opposite to her , with the tips of his fingers in his pockets and his head thrown back , looking fiercely not at Rosamond but at a point a few inches away from her . She was keenly offended , but the signs she made of this were such as only Lydgate was used to interpret . She became suddenly quiet and seated herself , untying her hanging bonnet and laying it down with her shawl . Her little hands which she folded before her were very cold . It would have been safer for Will in the first instance to have taken up his hat and gone away ; but he had felt no impulse to do this ; on the contrary , he had a horrible inclination to stay and shatter Rosamond with his anger . It seemed as impossible to bear the fatality she had drawn down on him without venting his fury as it would be to a panther to bear the javelin - wound without springing and biting . And yet — how could he tell a woman that he was ready to curse her ? He was fuming under a repressive law which he was forced to acknowledge : he was dangerously poised , and Rosamond 's voice now brought the decisive vibration . In flute - like tones of sarcasm she said — "
344944	344945	344932	344932	You	6416	" "
344950	344963	344948	344948	her	276	" he burst out , with a sharp edge in his voice . "
345004	345005	344994	344995	a man	846	" "
345014	345021	345011	345011	you	6416	" said Rosamond with more tremor . "
345065	345093	345094	345094	I	0	" He began to move about with the restlessness of a wild animal that sees prey but can not reach it . Presently he burst out again — "
345190	345236	345172	345172	She	276	" Will stopped as if he had found himself grasping something that must not be thrown and shattered . He found another vent for his rage by snatching up Rosamond 's words again , as if they were reptiles to be throttled and flung off . "
345303	345973	345282	345282	I	0	" Rosamond , while these poisoned weapons were being hurled at her , was almost losing the sense of her identity , and seemed to be waking into some new terrible existence . She had no sense of chill resolute repulsion , of reticent self - justification such as she had known under Lydgate 's most stormy displeasure : all her sensibility was turned into a bewildering novelty of pain ; she felt a new terrified recoil under a lash never experienced before . What another nature felt in opposition to her own was being burnt and bitten into her consciousness . When Will had ceased to speak she had become an image of sickened misery : her lips were pale , and her eyes had a tearless dismay in them . If it had been Tertius who stood opposite to her , that look of misery would have been a pang to him , and he would have sunk by her side to comfort her , with that strong - armed comfort which she had often held very cheap . Let it be forgiven to Will that he had no such movement of pity . He had felt no bond beforehand to this woman who had spoiled the ideal treasure of his life , and he held himself blameless . He knew that he was cruel , but he had no relenting in him yet . After he had done speaking , he still moved about , half in absence of mind , and Rosamond sat perfectly still . At length Will , seeming to bethink himself , took up his hat , yet stood some moments irresolute . He had spoken to her in a way that made a phrase of common politeness difficult to utter ; and yet , now that he had come to the point of going away from her without further speech , he shrank from it as a brutality ; he felt checked and stultified in his anger . He walked towards the mantel - piece and leaned his arm on it , and waited in silence for — he hardly knew what . The vindictive fire was still burning in him , and he could utter no word of retractation ; but it was nevertheless in his mind that having come back to this hearth where he had enjoyed a caressing friendship he had found calamity seated there — he had had suddenly revealed to him a trouble that lay outside the home as well as within it . And what seemed a foreboding was pressing upon him as with slow pincers:—that his life might come to be enslaved by this helpless woman who had thrown herself upon him in the dreary sadness of her heart . But he was in gloomy rebellion against the fact that his quick apprehensiveness foreshadowed to him , and when his eyes fell on Rosamond 's blighted face it seemed to him that he was the more pitiable of the two ; for pain must enter into its glorified life of memory before it can turn into compassion . And so they remained for many minutes , opposite each other , far apart , in silence ; Will 's face still possessed by a mute rage , and Rosamond 's by a mute misery . The poor thing had no force to fling out any passion in return ; the terrible collapse of the illusion towards which all her hope had been strained was a stroke which had too thoroughly shaken her : her little world was in ruins , and she felt herself tottering in the midst as a lonely bewildered consciousness . Will wished that she would speak and bring some mitigating shadow across his own cruel speech , which seemed to stand staring at them both in mockery of any attempt at revived fellowship . But she said nothing , and at last with a desperate effort over himself , he asked , "
345984	345985	345980	345980	Lydgate	278	" "
345990	346233	345980	345980	Lydgate	278	" Rosamond answered , just audibly . And then Will went out of the house , Martha never knowing that he had been in . After he was gone , Rosamond tried to get up from her seat , but fell back fainting . When she came to herself again , she felt too ill to make the exertion of rising to ring the bell , and she remained helpless until the girl , surprised at her long absence , thought for the first time of looking for her in all the down - stairs rooms . Rosamond said that she had felt suddenly sick and faint , and wanted to be helped up - stairs . When there she threw herself on the bed with her clothes on , and lay in apparent torpor , as she had done once before on a memorable day of grief . Lydgate came home earlier than he had expected , about half - past five , and found her there . The perception that she was ill threw every other thought into the background . When he felt her pulse , her eyes rested on him with more persistence than they had done for a long while , as if she felt some content that he was there . He perceived the difference in a moment , and seating himself by her put his arm gently under her , and bending over her said , "
346243	346450	346453	346454	Mrs. Lydgate	604	" Clinging to him she fell into hysterical sobbings and cries , and for the next hour he did nothing but soothe and tend her . He imagined that Dorothea had been to see her , and that all this effect on her nervous system , which evidently involved some new turning towards himself , was due to the excitement of the new impressions which that visit had raised . When Rosamond was quiet , and Lydgate had left her , hoping that she might soon sleep under the effect of an anodyne , he went into the drawing - room to fetch a book which he had left there , meaning to spend the evening in his work - room , and he saw on the table Dorothea 's letter addressed to him . He had not ventured to ask Rosamond if Mrs. Casaubon had called , but the reading of this letter assured him of the fact , for Dorothea mentioned that it was to be carried by herself . When Will Ladislaw came in a little later Lydgate met him with a surprise which made it clear that he had not been told of the earlier visit , and Will could not say , "
346463	346464	346453	346454	Mrs. Lydgate	604	" "
346470	346478	346465	346466	Poor Rosamond	283	" Lydgate added immediately on his greeting . "
346485	346489	346465	346466	Poor Rosamond	283	" said Will . "
346576	346577	346578	346578	I	0	" "
346603	346675	346594	346594	I	0	" said Will , feeling himself a sneak , but seeing no alternative to this evasion . And then he heard Lydgate 's account of the troubles which Rosamond had already depicted to him in her way . She had not mentioned the fact of Will 's name being connected with the public story — this detail not immediately affecting her — and he now heard it for the first time . "
346693	346713	346714	346714	You	261	" said Lydgate , who could understand better than most men how Ladislaw might be stung by the revelation . "
346742	346743	346737	346737	Raffles	597	" "
346746	346752	346737	346737	Raffles	597	" said Will , sardonically . "
346799	346803	346782	346782	I	0	" He was thinking "
346830	346940	346941	346942	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" But he said nothing of Bulstrode 's offer to him . Will was very open and careless about his personal affairs , but it was among the more exquisite touches in nature 's modelling of him that he had a delicate generosity which warned him into reticence here . He shrank from saying that he had rejected Bulstrode 's money , in the moment when he was learning that it was Lydgate 's misfortune to have accepted it . Lydgate too was reticent in the midst of his confidence . He made no allusion to Rosamond 's feeling under their trouble , and of Dorothea he only said , "
346966	347069	346954	346954	she	276	" Observing a change in Will 's face , he avoided any further mention of her , feeling himself too ignorant of their relation to each other not to fear that his words might have some hidden painful bearing on it . And it occurred to him that Dorothea was the real cause of the present visit to Middlemarch . The two men were pitying each other , but it was only Will who guessed the extent of his companion 's trouble . When Lydgate spoke with desperate resignation of going to settle in London , and said with a faint smile , "
347079	347634	347070	347070	We	6432	" Will felt inexpressibly mournful , and said nothing . Rosamond had that morning entreated him to urge this step on Lydgate ; and it seemed to him as if he were beholding in a magic panorama a future where he himself was sliding into that pleasureless yielding to the small solicitations of circumstance , which is a commoner history of perdition than any single momentous bargain . We are on a perilous margin when we begin to look passively at our future selves , and see our own figures led with dull consent into insipid misdoing and shabby achievement . Poor Lydgate was inwardly groaning on that margin , and Will was arriving at it . It seemed to him this evening as if the cruelty of his outburst to Rosamond had made an obligation for him , and he dreaded the obligation : he dreaded Lydgate 's unsuspecting good - will : he dreaded his own distaste for his spoiled life , which would leave him in motiveless levity . When Dorothea had seen Mr. Farebrother in the morning , she had promised to go and dine at the parsonage on her return from Freshitt . There was a frequent interchange of visits between her and the Farebrother family , which enabled her to say that she was not at all lonely at the Manor , and to resist for the present the severe prescription of a lady companion . When she reached home and remembered her engagement , she was glad of it ; and finding that she had still an hour before she could dress for dinner , she walked straight to the schoolhouse and entered into a conversation with the master and mistress about the new bell , giving eager attention to their small details and repetitions , and getting up a dramatic sense that her life was very busy . She paused on her way back to talk to old Master Bunney who was putting in some garden - seeds , and discoursed wisely with that rural sage about the crops that would make the most return on a perch of ground , and the result of sixty years ' experience as to soils — namely , that if your soil was pretty mellow it would do , but if there came wet , wet , wet to make it all of a mummy , why then — Finding that the social spirit had beguiled her into being rather late , she dressed hastily and went over to the parsonage rather earlier than was necessary . That house was never dull , Mr. Farebrother , like another White of Selborne , having continually something new to tell of his inarticulate guests and proteges , whom he was teaching the boys not to torment ; and he had just set up a pair of beautiful goats to be pets of the village in general , and to walk at large as sacred animals . The evening went by cheerfully till after tea , Dorothea talking more than usual and dilating with Mr. Farebrother on the possible histories of creatures that converse compendiously with their antennae , and for aught we know may hold reformed parliaments ; when suddenly some inarticulate little sounds were heard which called everybody 's attention . "
347638	347655	347635	347636	Henrietta Noble	670	" said Mrs. Farebrother , seeing her small sister moving about the furniture - legs distressfully , "
347661	347662	347663	347663	I	0	" "
347683	347698	347674	347674	I	0	" said the tiny old lady , involuntarily continuing her beaver - like notes . "
347707	347722	347705	347705	aunt	8094	" said Mr. Farebrother , putting up his glasses and looking at the carpet . "
347729	347734	347723	347724	Mr. Ladislaw	261	" said Miss Noble . "
347756	347757	347723	347724	Mr. Ladislaw	261	" "
347767	347804	347763	347763	Ladislaw	261	" said Mr. Farebrother , in a deep tone of comprehension , getting up and hunting . The box was found at last under a chiffonier , and Miss Noble grasped it with delight , saying , "
347814	347815	347763	347763	Ladislaw	261	" "
347827	347841	347763	347763	Ladislaw	261	" said Mr. Farebrother , smiling at Dorothea , as he reseated himself . "
347855	347860	347866	347866	she	7153	" said his mother , emphatically,—"she
347879	347880	347866	347866	she	7153	" "
347889	347962	347886	347886	I	0	" said Henrietta Noble . Dorothea made an attempt at smiling in return . She was surprised and annoyed to find that her heart was palpitating violently , and that it was quite useless to try after a recovery of her former animation . Alarmed at herself — fearing some further betrayal of a change so marked in its occasion , she rose and said in a low voice with undisguised anxiety , "
347972	347984	347967	347967	I	0	" Mr. Farebrother , quick in perception , rose and said , "
348014	348099	347886	347886	I	0	" He gave her his arm back to the Manor , but Dorothea did not attempt to speak , even when he said good - night . The limit of resistance was reached , and she had sunk back helpless within the clutch of inescapable anguish . Dismissing Tantripp with a few faint words , she locked her door , and turning away from it towards the vacant room she pressed her hands hard on the top of her head , and moaned out — "
348107	349266	347886	347886	I	0	" Then came the hour in which the waves of suffering shook her too thoroughly to leave any power of thought . She could only cry in loud whispers , between her sobs , after her lost belief which she had planted and kept alive from a very little seed since the days in Rome — after her lost joy of clinging with silent love and faith to one who , misprized by others , was worthy in her thought — after her lost woman 's pride of reigning in his memory — after her sweet dim perspective of hope , that along some pathway they should meet with unchanged recognition and take up the backward years as a yesterday . In that hour she repeated what the merciful eyes of solitude have looked on for ages in the spiritual struggles of man — she besought hardness and coldness and aching weariness to bring her relief from the mysterious incorporeal might of her anguish : she lay on the bare floor and let the night grow cold around her ; while her grand woman 's frame was shaken by sobs as if she had been a despairing child . There were two images — two living forms that tore her heart in two , as if it had been the heart of a mother who seems to see her child divided by the sword , and presses one bleeding half to her breast while her gaze goes forth in agony towards the half which is carried away by the lying woman that has never known the mother 's pang . Here , with the nearness of an answering smile , here within the vibrating bond of mutual speech , was the bright creature whom she had trusted — who had come to her like the spirit of morning visiting the dim vault where she sat as the bride of a worn - out life ; and now , with a full consciousness which had never awakened before , she stretched out her arms towards him and cried with bitter cries that their nearness was a parting vision : she discovered her passion to herself in the unshrinking utterance of despair . And there , aloof , yet persistently with her , moving wherever she moved , was the Will Ladislaw who was a changed belief exhausted of hope , a detected illusion — no , a living man towards whom there could not yet struggle any wail of regretful pity , from the midst of scorn and indignation and jealous offended pride . The fire of Dorothea 's anger was not easily spent , and it flamed out in fitful returns of spurning reproach . Why had he come obtruding his life into hers , hers that might have been whole enough without him ? Why had he brought his cheap regard and his lip - born words to her who had nothing paltry to give in exchange ? He knew that he was deluding her — wished , in the very moment of farewell , to make her believe that he gave her the whole price of her heart , and knew that he had spent it half before . Why had he not stayed among the crowd of whom she asked nothing — but only prayed that they might be less contemptible ? But she lost energy at last even for her loud - whispered cries and moans : she subsided into helpless sobs , and on the cold floor she sobbed herself to sleep . In the chill hours of the morning twilight , when all was dim around her , she awoke — not with any amazed wondering where she was or what had happened , but with the clearest consciousness that she was looking into the eyes of sorrow . She rose , and wrapped warm things around her , and seated herself in a great chair where she had often watched before . She was vigorous enough to have borne that hard night without feeling ill in body , beyond some aching and fatigue ; but she had waked to a new condition : she felt as if her soul had been liberated from its terrible conflict ; she was no longer wrestling with her grief , but could sit down with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer in her thoughts . For now the thoughts came thickly . It was not in Dorothea 's nature , for longer than the duration of a paroxysm , to sit in the narrow cell of her calamity , in the besotted misery of a consciousness that only sees another 's lot as an accident of its own . She began now to live through that yesterday morning deliberately again , forcing herself to dwell on every detail and its possible meaning . Was she alone in that scene ? Was it her event only ? She forced herself to think of it as bound up with another woman 's life — a woman towards whom she had set out with a longing to carry some clearness and comfort into her beclouded youth . In her first outleap of jealous indignation and disgust , when quitting the hateful room , she had flung away all the mercy with which she had undertaken that visit . She had enveloped both Will and Rosamond in her burning scorn , and it seemed to her as if Rosamond were burned out of her sight forever . But that base prompting which makes a women more cruel to a rival than to a faithless lover , could have no strength of recurrence in Dorothea when the dominant spirit of justice within her had once overcome the tumult and had once shown her the truer measure of things . All the active thought with which she had before been representing to herself the trials of Lydgate 's lot , and this young marriage union which , like her own , seemed to have its hidden as well as evident troubles — all this vivid sympathetic experience returned to her now as a power : it asserted itself as acquired knowledge asserts itself and will not let us see as we saw in the day of our ignorance . She said to her own irremediable grief , that it should make her more helpful , instead of driving her back from effort . And what sort of crisis might not this be in three lives whose contact with hers laid an obligation on her as if they had been suppliants bearing the sacred branch ? The objects of her rescue were not to be sought out by her fancy : they were chosen for her . She yearned towards the perfect Right , that it might make a throne within her , and rule her errant will . "
349302	349527	347886	347886	I	0	" It had taken long for her to come to that question , and there was light piercing into the room . She opened her curtains , and looked out towards the bit of road that lay in view , with fields beyond outside the entrance - gates . On the road there was a man with a bundle on his back and a woman carrying her baby ; in the field she could see figures moving — perhaps the shepherd with his dog . Far off in the bending sky was the pearly light ; and she felt the largeness of the world and the manifold wakings of men to labour and endurance . She was a part of that involuntary , palpitating life , and could neither look out on it from her luxurious shelter as a mere spectator , nor hide her eyes in selfish complaining . What she would resolve to do that day did not yet seem quite clear , but something that she could achieve stirred her as with an approaching murmur which would soon gather distinctness . She took off the clothes which seemed to have some of the weariness of a hard watching in them , and began to make her toilet . Presently she rang for Tantripp , who came in her dressing - gown . "
349542	349576	349532	349532	you	6948	" burst out Tantripp , looking first at the bed and then at Dorothea 's face , which in spite of bathing had the pale cheeks and pink eyelids of a mater dolorosa . "
349600	349601	349585	349585	Anybody	2191	" "
349609	349615	349607	349607	Tantripp	215	" said Dorothea , smiling . "
349663	349664	349653	349653	I	0	" "
349700	349710	349682	349682	I	0	" said Tantripp , stooping to light the fire . "
349775	349785	349772	349772	my	0	" ended Tantripp , looking anxiously at the fire ; "
349819	349820	349811	349811	his	2191	" "
349830	349853	349828	349828	Tan	788	" said Dorothea , speaking as she used to do in the old Lausanne days , only with a very low voice ; "
349859	350065	349828	349828	Tan	788	" She folded herself in the large chair , and leaned her head against it in fatigued quiescence , while Tantripp went away wondering at this strange contrariness in her young mistress — that just the morning when she had more of a widow 's face than ever , she should have asked for her lighter mourning which she had waived before . Tantripp would never have found the clew to this mystery . Dorothea wished to acknowledge that she had not the less an active life before her because she had buried a private joy ; and the tradition that fresh garments belonged to all initiation , haunting her mind , made her grasp after even that slight outward help towards calm resolve . For the resolve was not easy . Nevertheless at eleven o'clock she was walking towards Middlemarch , having made up her mind that she would make as quietly and unnoticeably as possible her second attempt to see and save Rosamond . When Dorothea was again at Lydgate 's door speaking to Martha , he was in the room close by with the door ajar , preparing to go out . He heard her voice , and immediately came to her . "
350078	350099	350104	350104	she	604	" she said , having reflected that it would be better to leave out all allusion to her previous visit . "
350107	350128	350104	350104	she	604	" said Lydgate , suppressing his thought about Dorothea 's looks , which were as much changed as Rosamond 's , "
350184	350295	350296	350296	I	0	" It was plain that Lydgate , as Dorothea had expected , knew nothing about the circumstances of her yesterday 's visit ; nay , he appeared to imagine that she had carried it out according to her intention . She had prepared a little note asking Rosamond to see her , which she would have given to the servant if he had not been in the way , but now she was in much anxiety as to the result of his announcement . After leading her into the drawing - room , he paused to take a letter from his pocket and put it into her hands , saying , "
350345	350351	350354	350354	I	0	" Dorothea 's face brightened . "
350375	350382	350371	350371	You	0	" she said , suddenly doubting . "
350395	350506	350507	350507	Ladislaw	261	" He said no more , but went up - stairs to Rosamond , who had but lately finished dressing herself , and sat languidly wondering what she should do next , her habitual industry in small things , even in the days of her sadness , prompting her to begin some kind of occupation , which she dragged through slowly or paused in from lack of interest . She looked ill , but had recovered her usual quietude of manner , and Lydgate had feared to disturb her by any questions . He had told her of Dorothea 's letter containing the check , and afterwards he had said , "
350541	350563	350534	350534	he	261	" And Rosamond had made no reply . Now , when he came up , he said to her very gently , "
350588	350728	350729	350729	I	0	" That she coloured and gave rather a startled movement did not surprise him after the agitation produced by the interview yesterday — a beneficent agitation , he thought , since it seemed to have made her turn to him again . Rosamond dared not say no . She dared not with a tone of her voice touch the facts of yesterday . Why had Mrs. Casaubon come again ? The answer was a blank which Rosamond could only fill up with dread , for Will Ladislaw 's lacerating words had made every thought of Dorothea a fresh smart to her . Nevertheless , in her new humiliating uncertainty she dared do nothing but comply . She did not say yes , but she rose and let Lydgate put a light shawl over her shoulders , while he said , "
350735	350747	350729	350729	I	0	" Then something crossed her mind which prompted her to say , "
350763	350908	350750	350750	Martha	500	" And Lydgate assented , thinking that he fully understood this wish . He led her down to the drawing - room door , and then turned away , observing to himself that he was rather a blundering husband to be dependent for his wife 's trust in him on the influence of another woman . Rosamond , wrapping her soft shawl around her as she walked towards Dorothea , was inwardly wrapping her soul in cold reserve . Had Mrs. Casaubon come to say anything to her about Will ? If so , it was a liberty that Rosamond resented ; and she prepared herself to meet every word with polite impassibility . Will had bruised her pride too sorely for her to feel any compunction towards him and Dorothea : her own injury seemed much the greater . Dorothea was not only the "
350910	351369	351370	351370	I	0	" woman , but had also a formidable advantage in being Lydgate 's benefactor ; and to poor Rosamond 's pained confused vision it seemed that this Mrs. Casaubon — this woman who predominated in all things concerning her — must have come now with the sense of having the advantage , and with animosity prompting her to use it . Indeed , not Rosamond only , but any one else , knowing the outer facts of the case , and not the simple inspiration on which Dorothea acted , might well have wondered why she came . Looking like the lovely ghost of herself , her graceful slimness wrapped in her soft white shawl , the rounded infantine mouth and cheek inevitably suggesting mildness and innocence , Rosamond paused at three yards ' distance from her visitor and bowed . But Dorothea , who had taken off her gloves , from an impulse which she could never resist when she wanted a sense of freedom , came forward , and with her face full of a sad yet sweet openness , put out her hand . Rosamond could not avoid meeting her glance , could not avoid putting her small hand into Dorothea 's , which clasped it with gentle motherliness ; and immediately a doubt of her own prepossessions began to stir within her . Rosamond 's eye was quick for faces ; she saw that Mrs. Casaubon 's face looked pale and changed since yesterday , yet gentle , and like the firm softness of her hand . But Dorothea had counted a little too much on her own strength : the clearness and intensity of her mental action this morning were the continuance of a nervous exaltation which made her frame as dangerously responsive as a bit of finest Venetian crystal ; and in looking at Rosamond , she suddenly found her heart swelling , and was unable to speak — all her effort was required to keep back tears . She succeeded in that , and the emotion only passed over her face like the spirit of a sob ; but it added to Rosamond 's impression that Mrs. Casaubon 's state of mind must be something quite different from what she had imagined . So they sat down without a word of preface on the two chairs that happened to be nearest , and happened also to be close together ; though Rosamond 's notion when she first bowed was that she should stay a long way off from Mrs. Casaubon . But she ceased thinking how anything would turn out — merely wondering what would come . And Dorothea began to speak quite simply , gathering firmness as she went on . "
351496	351594	351481	351481	You	6454	" The cordial , pleading tones which seemed to flow with generous heedlessness above all the facts which had filled Rosamond 's mind as grounds of obstruction and hatred between her and this woman , came as soothingly as a warm stream over her shrinking fears . Of course Mrs. Casaubon had the facts in her mind , but she was not going to speak of anything connected with them . That relief was too great for Rosamond to feel much else at the moment . She answered prettily , in the new ease of her soul — "
351617	351618	351609	351609	you	6454	" "
351624	351628	351650	351650	he	300	" said Dorothea , "
351891	351937	351939	351939	you	0	" Dorothea 's face had become animated , and as it beamed on Rosamond very close to her , she felt something like bashful timidity before a superior , in the presence of this self - forgetful ardor . She said , with blushing embarrassment , "
351946	351947	351941	351941	you	0	" "
352102	352630	352631	352631	We	6469	" Dorothea , completely swayed by the feeling that she was uttering , forgot everything but that she was speaking from out the heart of her own trial to Rosamond 's . The emotion had wrought itself more and more into her utterance , till the tones might have gone to one 's very marrow , like a low cry from some suffering creature in the darkness . And she had unconsciously laid her hand again on the little hand that she had pressed before . Rosamond , with an overmastering pang , as if a wound within her had been probed , burst into hysterical crying as she had done the day before when she clung to her husband . Poor Dorothea was feeling a great wave of her own sorrow returning over her — her thought being drawn to the possible share that Will Ladislaw might have in Rosamond 's mental tumult . She was beginning to fear that she should not be able to suppress herself enough to the end of this meeting , and while her hand was still resting on Rosamond 's lap , though the hand underneath it was withdrawn , she was struggling against her own rising sobs . She tried to master herself with the thought that this might be a turning - point in three lives — not in her own ; no , there the irrevocable had happened , but — in those three lives which were touching hers with the solemn neighborhood of danger and distress . The fragile creature who was crying close to her — there might still be time to rescue her from the misery of false incompatible bonds ; and this moment was unlike any other : she and Rosamond could never be together again with the same thrilling consciousness of yesterday within them both . She felt the relation between them to be peculiar enough to give her a peculiar influence , though she had no conception that the way in which her own feelings were involved was fully known to Mrs. Lydgate . It was a newer crisis in Rosamond 's experience than even Dorothea could imagine : she was under the first great shock that had shattered her dream - world in which she had been easily confident of herself and critical of others ; and this strange unexpected manifestation of feeling in a woman whom she had approached with a shrinking aversion and dread , as one who must necessarily have a jealous hatred towards her , made her soul totter all the more with a sense that she had been walking in an unknown world which had just broken in upon her . When Rosamond 's convulsed throat was subsiding into calm , and she withdrew the handkerchief with which she had been hiding her face , her eyes met Dorothea 's as helplessly as if they had been blue flowers . What was the use of thinking about behavior after this crying ? And Dorothea looked almost as childish , with the neglected trace of a silent tear . Pride was broken down between these two . "
352638	352646	352631	352631	We	6469	" Dorothea said , with some timidity . "
352704	352705	352706	352706	Tertius	300	" "
352717	352732	352713	352713	I	0	" said Rosamond , imagining that he had been complaining of her to Dorothea . "
352749	352750	352753	352753	himself	300	" "
352760	352764	352753	352753	himself	300	" said Dorothea . "
352903	352937	352879	352879	he	300	" Dorothea waited a little ; she had discerned a faint pleasure stealing over Rosamond 's face . But there was no answer , and she went on , with a gathering tremor , "
352977	352990	352879	352879	he	300	use"—poor Dorothea , in her palpitating anxiety , could only seize her language brokenly—"I
353069	353145	353148	353148	I	0	" Her voice had sunk very low : there was a dread upon her of presuming too far , and of speaking as if she herself were perfection addressing error . She was too much preoccupied with her own anxiety , to be aware that Rosamond was trembling too ; and filled with the need to express pitying fellowship rather than rebuke , she put her hands on Rosamond 's , and said with more agitated rapidity,—"I
353190	353334	353335	353335	You	0	" The waves of her own sorrow , from out of which she was struggling to save another , rushed over Dorothea with conquering force . She stopped in speechless agitation , not crying , but feeling as if she were being inwardly grappled . Her face had become of a deathlier paleness , her lips trembled , and she pressed her hands helplessly on the hands that lay under them . Rosamond , taken hold of by an emotion stronger than her own — hurried along in a new movement which gave all things some new , awful , undefined aspect — could find no words , but involuntarily she put her lips to Dorothea 's forehead which was very near her , and then for a minute the two women clasped each other as if they had been in a shipwreck . "
353343	353394	353396	353396	you	0	" said Rosamond , in an eager half - whisper , while she was still feeling Dorothea 's arms round her — urged by a mysterious necessity to free herself from something that oppressed her as if it were blood guiltiness . They moved apart , looking at each other . "
353408	353434	353435	353435	He	6478	" said Rosamond in the same tone . There was a movement of surprised attention in Dorothea . She expected a vindication of Rosamond herself . "
353455	353469	353446	353446	I	0	" said Rosamond , getting more and more hurried as she went on . "
353600	353735	353592	353592	he	6478	" Rosamond had delivered her soul under impulses which she had not known before . She had begun her confession under the subduing influence of Dorothea 's emotion ; and as she went on she had gathered the sense that she was repelling Will 's reproaches , which were still like a knife - wound within her . The revulsion of feeling in Dorothea was too strong to be called joy . It was a tumult in which the terrible strain of the night and morning made a resistant pain:—she could only perceive that this would be joy when she had recovered her power of feeling it . Her immediate consciousness was one of immense sympathy without check ; she cared for Rosamond without struggle now , and responded earnestly to her last words — "
353746	353806	353738	353738	he	6478	" With her usual tendency to over - estimate the good in others , she felt a great outgoing of her heart towards Rosamond , for the generous effort which had redeemed her from suffering , not counting that the effort was a reflex of her own energy . After they had been silent a little , she said — "
353817	353818	353807	353807	You	6478	" "
353829	353833	353821	353821	you	6478	" said Rosamond . "
353861	353862	353884	353884	He	886	" "
353905	353942	353899	353899	you	0	" said Dorothea . She tried to thrust away the too overpowering thought of her own relief , lest she should fail to win some sign that Rosamond 's affection was yearning back towards her husband . "
353953	354004	353943	353943	Tertius	300	" said Rosamond , understanding now that Lydgate might have said anything to Mrs. Casaubon , and that she certainly was different from other women . Perhaps there was a faint taste of jealousy in the question . A smile began to play over Dorothea 's face as she said — "
354015	354026	354027	354027	I	0	" But here the door opened , and Lydgate entered . "
354037	354041	354027	354027	I	0	" he said . "
354134	354135	354123	354124	some one	1163	" "
354149	354160	354144	354144	I	0	" said Dorothea , rising with animation in her face . "
354193	354291	354180	354180	I	0	" She put out her hand to Rosamond , and they said an earnest , quiet good - by without kiss or other show of effusion : there had been between them too much serious emotion for them to use the signs of it superficially . As Lydgate took her to the door she said nothing of Rosamond , but told him of Mr. Farebrother and the other friends who had listened with belief to his story . When he came back to Rosamond , she had already thrown herself on the sofa , in resigned fatigue . "
354296	354309	354294	354294	Rosy	715	" he said , standing over her , and touching her hair , "
354326	354327	354315	354316	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" "
354338	354342	354330	354330	she	276	" said Rosamond , "
354369	354374	354359	354359	you	0	" Lydgate laughed at the "

354398	354408	354395	354395	she	276	" said Rosamond , looking up in his face . "
354424	355963	355964	355964	I	0	" He lifted up his large white hand to obey her , and felt thankful for this little mark of interest in him . Poor Rosamond 's vagrant fancy had come back terribly scourged — meek enough to nestle under the old despised shelter . And the shelter was still there : Lydgate had accepted his narrowed lot with sad resignation . He had chosen this fragile creature , and had taken the burthen of her life upon his arms . He must walk as he could , carrying that burthen pitifully . Exiles notoriously feed much on hopes , and are unlikely to stay in banishment unless they are obliged . When Will Ladislaw exiled himself from Middlemarch he had placed no stronger obstacle to his return than his own resolve , which was by no means an iron barrier , but simply a state of mind liable to melt into a minuet with other states of mind , and to find itself bowing , smiling , and giving place with polite facility . As the months went on , it had seemed more and more difficult to him to say why he should not run down to Middlemarch — merely for the sake of hearing something about Dorothea ; and if on such a flying visit he should chance by some strange coincidence to meet with her , there was no reason for him to be ashamed of having taken an innocent journey which he had beforehand supposed that he should not take . Since he was hopelessly divided from her , he might surely venture into her neighborhood ; and as to the suspicious friends who kept a dragon watch over her — their opinions seemed less and less important with time and change of air . And there had come a reason quite irrespective of Dorothea , which seemed to make a journey to Middlemarch a sort of philanthropic duty . Will had given a disinterested attention to an intended settlement on a new plan in the Far West , and the need for funds in order to carry out a good design had set him on debating with himself whether it would not be a laudable use to make of his claim on Bulstrode , to urge the application of that money which had been offered to himself as a means of carrying out a scheme likely to be largely beneficial . The question seemed a very dubious one to Will , and his repugnance to again entering into any relation with the banker might have made him dismiss it quickly , if there had not arisen in his imagination the probability that his judgment might be more safely determined by a visit to Middlemarch . That was the object which Will stated to himself as a reason for coming down . He had meant to confide in Lydgate , and discuss the money question with him , and he had meant to amuse himself for the few evenings of his stay by having a great deal of music and badinage with fair Rosamond , without neglecting his friends at Lowick Parsonage:—if the Parsonage was close to the Manor , that was no fault of his . He had neglected the Farebrothers before his departure , from a proud resistance to the possible accusation of indirectly seeking interviews with Dorothea ; but hunger tames us , and Will had become very hungry for the vision of a certain form and the sound of a certain voice . Nothing had done instead — not the opera , or the converse of zealous politicians , or the flattering reception ( in dim corners ) of his new hand in leading articles . Thus he had come down , foreseeing with confidence how almost everything would be in his familiar little world ; fearing , indeed , that there would be no surprises in his visit . But he had found that humdrum world in a terribly dynamic condition , in which even badinage and lyrism had turned explosive ; and the first day of this visit had become the most fatal epoch of his life . The next morning he felt so harassed with the nightmare of consequences — he dreaded so much the immediate issues before him — that seeing while he breakfasted the arrival of the Riverston coach , he went out hurriedly and took his place on it , that he might be relieved , at least for a day , from the necessity of doing or saying anything in Middlemarch . Will Ladislaw was in one of those tangled crises which are commoner in experience than one might imagine , from the shallow absoluteness of men 's judgments . He had found Lydgate , for whom he had the sincerest respect , under circumstances which claimed his thorough and frankly declared sympathy ; and the reason why , in spite of that claim , it would have been better for Will to have avoided all further intimacy , or even contact , with Lydgate , was precisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible . To a creature of Will 's susceptible temperament — without any neutral region of indifference in his nature , ready to turn everything that befell him into the collisions of a passionate drama — the revelation that Rosamond had made her happiness in any way dependent on him was a difficulty which his outburst of rage towards her had immeasurably increased for him . He hated his own cruelty , and yet he dreaded to show the fulness of his relenting : he must go to her again ; the friendship could not be put to a sudden end ; and her unhappiness was a power which he dreaded . And all the while there was no more foretaste of enjoyment in the life before him than if his limbs had been lopped off and he was making his fresh start on crutches . In the night he had debated whether he should not get on the coach , not for Riverston , but for London , leaving a note to Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for his retreat . But there were strong cords pulling him back from that abrupt departure : the blight on his happiness in thinking of Dorothea , the crushing of that chief hope which had remained in spite of the acknowledged necessity for renunciation , was too fresh a misery for him to resign himself to it and go straightway into a distance which was also despair . Thus he did nothing more decided than taking the Riverston coach . He came back again by it while it was still daylight , having made up his mind that he must go to Lydgate 's that evening . The Rubicon , we know , was a very insignificant stream to look at ; its significance lay entirely in certain invisible conditions . Will felt as if he were forced to cross his small boundary ditch , and what he saw beyond it was not empire , but discontented subjection . But it is given to us sometimes even in our every - day life to witness the saving influence of a noble nature , the divine efficacy of rescue that may lie in a self - subduing act of fellowship . If Dorothea , after her night 's anguish , had not taken that walk to Rosamond — why , she perhaps would have been a woman who gained a higher character for discretion , but it would certainly not have been as well for those three who were on one hearth in Lydgate 's house at half - past seven that evening . Rosamond had been prepared for Will 's visit , and she received him with a languid coldness which Lydgate accounted for by her nervous exhaustion , of which he could not suppose that it had any relation to Will . And when she sat in silence bending over a bit of work , he innocently apologized for her in an indirect way by begging her to lean backward and rest . Will was miserable in the necessity for playing the part of a friend who was making his first appearance and greeting to Rosamond , while his thoughts were busy about her feeling since that scene of yesterday , which seemed still inexorably to enclose them both , like the painful vision of a double madness . It happened that nothing called Lydgate out of the room ; but when Rosamond poured out the tea , and Will came near to fetch it , she placed a tiny bit of folded paper in his saucer . He saw it and secured it quickly , but as he went back to his inn he had no eagerness to unfold the paper . What Rosamond had written to him would probably deepen the painful impressions of the evening . Still , he opened and read it by his bed - candle . There were only these few words in her neatly flowing hand : — "
356013	356813	356003	356003	I	0	" The effect of these words was not quite all gladness . As Will dwelt on them with excited imagination , he felt his cheeks and ears burning at the thought of what had occurred between Dorothea and Rosamond — at the uncertainty how far Dorothea might still feel her dignity wounded in having an explanation of his conduct offered to her . There might still remain in her mind a changed association with him which made an irremediable difference — a lasting flaw . With active fancy he wrought himself into a state of doubt little more easy than that of the man who has escaped from wreck by night and stands on unknown ground in the darkness . Until that wretched yesterday — except the moment of vexation long ago in the very same room and in the very same presence — all their vision , all their thought of each other , had been as in a world apart , where the sunshine fell on tall white lilies , where no evil lurked , and no other soul entered . But now — would Dorothea meet him in that world again ? On the second morning after Dorothea 's visit to Rosamond , she had had two nights of sound sleep , and had not only lost all traces of fatigue , but felt as if she had a great deal of superfluous strength — that is to say , more strength than she could manage to concentrate on any occupation . The day before , she had taken long walks outside the grounds , and had paid two visits to the Parsonage ; but she never in her life told any one the reason why she spent her time in that fruitless manner , and this morning she was rather angry with herself for her childish restlessness . To - day was to be spent quite differently . What was there to be done in the village ? Oh dear ! nothing . Everybody was well and had flannel ; nobody 's pig had died ; and it was Saturday morning , when there was a general scrubbing of doors and door - stones , and when it was useless to go into the school . But there were various subjects that Dorothea was trying to get clear upon , and she resolved to throw herself energetically into the gravest of all . She sat down in the library before her particular little heap of books on political economy and kindred matters , out of which she was trying to get light as to the best way of spending money so as not to injure one 's neighbors , or — what comes to the same thing — so as to do them the most good . Here was a weighty subject which , if she could but lay hold of it , would certainly keep her mind steady . Unhappily her mind slipped off it for a whole hour ; and at the end she found herself reading sentences twice over with an intense consciousness of many things , but not of any one thing contained in the text . This was hopeless . Should she order the carriage and drive to Tipton ? No ; for some reason or other she preferred staying at Lowick . But her vagrant mind must be reduced to order : there was an art in self - discipline ; and she walked round and round the brown library considering by what sort of manoeuvre she could arrest her wandering thoughts . Perhaps a mere task was the best means — something to which she must go doggedly . Was there not the geography of Asia Minor , in which her slackness had often been rebuked by Mr. Casaubon ? She went to the cabinet of maps and unrolled one : this morning she might make herself finally sure that Paphlagonia was not on the Levantine coast , and fix her total darkness about the Chalybes firmly on the shores of the Euxine . A map was a fine thing to study when you were disposed to think of something else , being made up of names that would turn into a chime if you went back upon them . Dorothea set earnestly to work , bending close to her map , and uttering the names in an audible , subdued tone , which often got into a chime . She looked amusingly girlish after all her deep experience — nodding her head and marking the names off on her fingers , with a little pursing of her lip , and now and then breaking off to put her hands on each side of her face and say , "
356820	356901	356003	356003	I	0	" There was no reason why this should end any more than a merry - go - round ; but it was at last interrupted by the opening of the door and the announcement of Miss Noble . The little old lady , whose bonnet hardly reached Dorothea 's shoulder , was warmly welcomed , but while her hand was being pressed she made many of her beaver - like noises , as if she had something difficult to say . "
356906	356915	356003	356003	I	0	" said Dorothea , rolling a chair forward . "
356933	356934	356935	356935	I	0	" "
356940	356961	356962	356962	I	0	" said Miss Noble , putting her hand into her small basket , and holding some article inside it nervously ; "
356971	357010	356965	356966	a friend	8520	" She lapsed into her inarticulate sounds , and unconsciously drew forth the article which she was fingering . It was the tortoise - shell lozenge - box , and Dorothea felt the colour mounting to her cheeks . "
357014	357021	357022	357022	He	261	" continued the timid little woman . "
357045	357123	357126	357126	him	261	" Dorothea did not answer on the instant : it was crossing her mind that she could not receive him in this library , where her husband 's prohibition seemed to dwell . She looked towards the window . Could she go out and meet him in the grounds ? The sky was heavy , and the trees had begun to shiver as at a coming storm . Besides , she shrank from going out to him . "
357131	357138	357128	357129	Mrs. Casaubon	276	" said Miss Noble , pathetically ; "
357154	357155	357140	357140	I	0	" "
357163	357167	357158	357158	I	0	" said Dorothea . "
357174	357362	357170	357170	him	261	" What else was there to be done ? There was nothing that she longed for at that moment except to see Will : the possibility of seeing him had thrust itself insistently between her and every other object ; and yet she had a throbbing excitement like an alarm upon her — a sense that she was doing something daringly defiant for his sake . When the little lady had trotted away on her mission , Dorothea stood in the middle of the library with her hands falling clasped before her , making no attempt to compose herself in an attitude of dignified unconsciousness . What she was least conscious of just then was her own body : she was thinking of what was likely to be in Will 's mind , and of the hard feelings that others had had about him . How could any duty bind her to hardness ? Resistance to unjust dispraise had mingled with her feeling for him from the very first , and now in the rebound of her heart after her anguish the resistance was stronger than ever . "
357377	357525	357372	357372	he	6493	ill:"—there was a voice within her saying this to some imagined audience in the library , when the door was opened , and she saw Will before her . She did not move , and he came towards her with more doubt and timidity in his face than she had ever seen before . He was in a state of uncertainty which made him afraid lest some look or word of his should condemn him to a new distance from her ; and Dorothea was afraid of her own emotion . She looked as if there were a spell upon her , keeping her motionless and hindering her from unclasping her hands , while some intense , grave yearning was imprisoned within her eyes . Seeing that she did not put out her hand as usual , Will paused a yard from her and said with embarrassment , "
357536	357537	357531	357531	you	6494	" "
357544	357597	357538	357538	I	0	" said Dorothea , having no other words at command . It did not occur to her to sit down , and Will did not give a cheerful interpretation to this queenly way of receiving him ; but he went on to say what he had made up his mind to say . "
357662	357685	357646	357646	I	0	" There was a slight movement in Dorothea , and she unclasped her hands , but immediately folded them over each other . "
357695	357699	357700	357700	I	0	" Will continued . "
357802	357834	357796	357796	you	6494	" Will looked doubtfully at Dorothea , but his manner was gathering some of the defiant courage with which he always thought of this fact in his destiny . He added , "
357846	357847	357835	357835	You	6494	" "
357855	357861	357852	357852	I	0	" said Dorothea , hastily . "
357891	357919	357879	357879	you	6494	" said Will . Why should he mind saying anything of that sort to her now ? She knew that he had avowed his love for her . "
357922	357928	357920	357920	I	0	that"—he broke off , nevertheless . "
357940	357960	357929	357929	You	0	" said Dorothea , her face brightening and her head becoming a little more erect on its beautiful stem . "
357992	358015	357929	357929	You	0	" said Will , shaking his head backward in his old way , and looking with a grave appeal into her eyes . "
358035	358041	357929	357929	You	0	" said Dorothea , fervidly . "
358049	358078	357929	357929	You	0	" her heart was swelling , and it was difficult to go on ; she made a great effort over herself to say in a low tremulous voice , "
358097	358098	358099	358099	You	0	" "
358114	358130	358131	358131	I	0	" said Will , giving way to his own feeling in the evidence of hers . "
358180	358181	358158	358158	I	0	" "
358190	358275	358182	358182	I	0	" said Dorothea , putting out her hand ; a vague fear for him impelling her unutterable affection . He took her hand and raised it to his lips with something like a sob . But he stood with his hat and gloves in the other hand , and might have done for the portrait of a Royalist . Still it was difficult to loose the hand , and Dorothea , withdrawing it in a confusion that distressed her , looked and moved away . "
358291	358510	358559	358559	I	0	" she said , walking towards the window , yet speaking and moving with only a dim sense of what she was doing . Will followed her at a little distance , and leaned against the tall back of a leather chair , on which he ventured now to lay his hat and gloves , and free himself from the intolerable durance of formality to which he had been for the first time condemned in Dorothea 's presence . It must be confessed that he felt very happy at that moment leaning on the chair . He was not much afraid of anything that she might feel now . They stood silent , not looking at each other , but looking at the evergreens which were being tossed , and were showing the pale underside of their leaves against the blackening sky . Will never enjoyed the prospect of a storm so much : it delivered him from the necessity of going away . Leaves and little branches were hurled about , and the thunder was getting nearer . The light was more and more sombre , but there came a flash of lightning which made them start and look at each other , and then smile . Dorothea began to say what she had been thinking of . "
358600	358601	358602	358602	You	0	" "
358613	358617	358602	358602	You	0	" said Will ; "
358628	358629	358602	358602	You	0	" "
358643	358688	358631	358631	I	0	" Dorothea had begun impetuously , but broke off . Will coloured . He had the sense that whatever she said was uttered in the vision of a fatality that kept them apart . He was silent a moment , and then said passionately — "
358731	358854	358717	358717	you	0	" While he was speaking there came a vivid flash of lightning which lit each of them up for the other — and the light seemed to be the terror of a hopeless love . Dorothea darted instantaneously from the window ; Will followed her , seizing her hand with a spasmodic movement ; and so they stood , with their hands clasped , like two children , looking out on the storm , while the thunder gave a tremendous crack and roll above them , and the rain began to pour down . Then they turned their faces towards each other , with the memory of his last words in them , and they did not loose each other 's hands . "
358862	358866	358717	358717	you	0	" said Will . "
358958	358959	358955	358955	I	0	" "
358965	358975	358976	358976	I	0	" said Dorothea , in her clear tender tones . "
358987	359213	358976	358976	I	0	" Her lips trembled , and so did his . It was never known which lips were the first to move towards the other lips ; but they kissed tremblingly , and then they moved apart . The rain was dashing against the window - panes as if an angry spirit were within it , and behind it was the great swoop of the wind ; it was one of those moments in which both the busy and the idle pause with a certain awe . Dorothea sat down on the seat nearest to her , a long low ottoman in the middle of the room , and with her hands folded over each other on her lap , looked at the drear outer world . Will stood still an instant looking at her , then seated himself beside her , and laid his hand on hers , which turned itself upward to be clasped . They sat in that way without looking at each other , until the rain abated and began to fall in stillness . Each had been full of thoughts which neither of them could begin to utter . But when the rain was quiet , Dorothea turned to look at Will . With passionate exclamation , as if some torture screw were threatening him , he started up and said , "
359218	359248	358976	358976	I	0	" He went and leaned on the back of the chair again , and seemed to be battling with his own anger , while she looked towards him sadly . "
359264	359270	358976	358976	I	0	" he burst out again ; "
359285	359286	358976	358976	I	0	" "
359300	359306	359293	359293	your	6509	" said Dorothea , gently . "
359312	359318	359293	359293	your	6509	" said Will , angrily . "
359388	359389	359382	359382	We	6508	" "
359396	359405	359382	359382	We	6508	" said Dorothea , in a trembling voice . "
359408	359414	359382	359382	We	6508	" said Will , bitterly . "
359483	359600	359476	359476	she	6386	" There was silence . Dorothea 's heart was full of something that she wanted to say , and yet the words were too difficult . She was wholly possessed by them : at that moment debate was mute within her . And it was very hard that she could not say what she wanted to say . Will was looking out of the window angrily . If he would have looked at her and not gone away from her side , she thought everything would have been easier . At last he turned , still resting against the chair , and stretching his hand automatically towards his hat , said with a sort of exasperation , "
359605	359606	359476	359476	she	6386	" "
359620	359656	359657	359657	I	0	" said Dorothea , starting from her seat , the flood of her young passion bearing down all the obstructions which had kept her silent — the great tears rising and falling in an instant : "
359669	359724	359725	359725	We	6513	" In an instant Will was close to her and had his arms round her , but she drew her head back and held his away gently that she might go on speaking , her large tear - filled eyes looking at his very simply , while she said in a sobbing childlike way , "
359763	359802	359756	359756	I	0	" It was just after the Lords had thrown out the Reform Bill : that explains how Mr. Cadwallader came to be walking on the slope of the lawn near the great conservatory at Freshitt Hall , holding the "
359804	359998	359999	359999	Lady	6514	" in his hands behind him , while he talked with a trout - fisher 's dispassionateness about the prospects of the country to Sir James Chettam . Mrs. Cadwallader , the Dowager Lady Chettam , and Celia were sometimes seated on garden - chairs , sometimes walking to meet little Arthur , who was being drawn in his chariot , and , as became the infantine Bouddha , was sheltered by his sacred umbrella with handsome silken fringe . The ladies also talked politics , though more fitfully . Mrs. Cadwallader was strong on the intended creation of peers : she had it for certain from her cousin that Truberry had gone over to the other side entirely at the instigation of his wife , who had scented peerages in the air from the very first introduction of the Reform question , and would sign her soul away to take precedence of her younger sister , who had married a baronet . Lady Chettam thought that such conduct was very reprehensible , and remembered that Mrs. Truberry 's mother was a Miss Walsingham of Melspring . Celia confessed it was nicer to be "
360000	360002	360003	360003	Mrs.	6515	" than "
360005	360063	360003	360003	Mrs.	6515	" and that Dodo never minded about precedence if she could have her own way . Mrs. Cadwallader held that it was a poor satisfaction to take precedence when everybody about you knew that you had not a drop of good blood in your veins ; and Celia again , stopping to look at Arthur , said , "
360099	360100	360101	360101	My	0	" "
360105	360110	360101	360101	My	0	" said the Dowager , "

360149	360155	360123	360123	I	0	" said Celia , comfortably . "
360165	360209	360161	360162	my uncle	6940	" She tripped off to meet her uncle , while Sir James and Mr. Cadwallader came forward to make one group with the ladies . Celia had slipped her arm through her uncle 's , and he patted her hand with a rather melancholy "
360215	360255	360161	360162	my uncle	6940	" As they approached , it was evident that Mr. Brooke was looking dejected , but this was fully accounted for by the state of politics ; and as he was shaking hands all round without more greeting than a "
360266	360273	360258	360258	you	0	" the Rector said , laughingly — "

360314	360326	360330	360330	you	0	" said Mr. Brooke , with a mild distractedness of manner . "

360439	360459	360427	360427	I	0	" said Mr. Brooke , nodding at the Cadwalladers , to show that he included them in his confidence . "
360472	360481	360470	360470	Chettam	177	" he continued , as they were entering , "
360548	360625	360626	360626	I	0	" Mr. Brooke was evidently in a state of nervous perturbation . When he had something painful to tell , it was usually his way to introduce it among a number of disjointed particulars , as if it were a medicine that would get a milder flavour by mixing . He continued his chat with Sir James about the poachers until they were all seated , and Mrs. Cadwallader , impatient of this drivelling , said — "
360651	360652	360697	360697	Cadwallader	180	" "
360665	360670	360662	360662	you	0	" said Mr. Brooke . "

360779	360815	360777	360777	Dodo	184	" said Celia , who had been used to think of her sister as the dangerous part of the family machinery . She had seated herself on a low stool against her husband 's knee . "
360827	360832	360777	360777	Dodo	184	" said Sir James . "
360859	360860	360835	360835	you	0	" "
360863	360870	360835	360835	you	0	" said Sir James , hastily . "
360876	360877	360878	360878	Dorothea	189	" "
360889	360932	360886	360886	you	0	" said Mr. Brooke , nodding towards Celia , who immediately looked up at her husband with a frightened glance , and put her hand on his knee . Sir James was almost white with anger , but he did not speak . "
360936	360941	360886	360886	you	0	" said Mrs. Cadwallader . "
360947	360954	360944	360945	young Ladislaw	261	" Mr. Brooke nodded , saying , "
360960	360969	360970	360970	You	0	" and then fell into a prudential silence . "
360975	360987	360973	360973	Humphrey	488	" said Mrs. Cadwallader , waving her arm towards her husband . "
361026	361027	361029	361029	he	6540	" "
361038	361045	361029	361029	he	6540	" said the Rector , quietly . "
361052	361074	361048	361048	you	0	" said Sir James , not liking to hear any one else speak , though finding it difficult to speak himself . "
361077	361084	361085	361085	I	0	" said Mr. Brooke , meekly . "
361166	361167	361156	361156	she	6544	" "
361186	361206	361174	361174	I	0	" said Sir James , not from bloody - mindedness , but because he needed something strong to say . "
361218	361222	361209	361209	James	177	" said Celia . "
361235	361253	361209	361209	James	177	" said Mr. Cadwallader , sorry to see his good - natured friend so overmastered by anger . "
361284	361295	361209	361209	James	177	" said Sir James , still in his white indignation . "
361357	361358	361351	361351	I	0	" "
361370	361375	361376	361376	You	177	" said Mr. Brooke . "
361416	361417	361410	361410	he	261	" "
361420	361431	361410	361410	he	261	" said Sir James , unable to repress a retort , "
361475	361491	361468	361468	Dorothea	189	" Sir James made little stoppages between his clauses , the words not coming easily . "
361567	361580	361581	361581	I	0	" Sir James ended emphatically , turning aside and crossing his leg . "
361588	361593	361581	361581	I	0	" said Mr. Brooke , apologetically—"I
361690	361691	361684	361684	she	6552	" "
361701	361710	361711	361711	I	0	" said Sir James , with more coolness . "
361742	361743	361747	361747	Chettam	177	" "
361749	361767	361747	361747	Chettam	177	" said the easy , large - lipped Rector , who objected to all this unnecessary discomfort . "
361832	361833	361814	361814	you	0	" "
361839	361844	361814	361814	you	0	" answered Sir James . "
361857	361858	361859	361859	My	0	" "
361879	361927	361859	361859	My	0	" said the Rector , quietly . Like many men who take life easily , he had the knack of saying a home truth occasionally to those who felt themselves virtuously out of temper . Sir James took out his handkerchief and began to bite the corner . "
361937	361947	361948	361948	She	6568	" said Celia , wishing to justify her husband . "
361961	361962	361965	361965	her	6568	" "
361972	361986	361965	361965	her	6568	" said Lady Chettam , majestically , as if this were royal evidence . "
361999	362004	361965	361965	her	6568	" said Mrs. Cadwallader . "
362117	362118	362119	362119	I	0	" "
362131	362152	362124	362124	you	0	" said Sir James , still feeling a little stung , and turning round in his chair towards the Rector . "
362174	362186	362168	362168	I	0	" he continued , carefully keeping his eyes off Mr. Brooke . "
362205	362206	362189	362189	others	1056	" "
362214	362227	362212	362212	Chettam	177	" said Mr. Brooke , good - humoredly , nursing his leg , "
362301	362576	362293	362293	I	0	" Mr. Brooke nodded at Sir James , and felt that he was both showing his own force of resolution and propitiating what was just in the Baronet 's vexation . He had hit on a more ingenious mode of parrying than he was aware of . He had touched a motive of which Sir James was ashamed . The mass of his feeling about Dorothea 's marriage to Ladislaw was due partly to excusable prejudice , or even justifiable opinion , partly to a jealous repugnance hardly less in Ladislaw 's case than in Casaubon 's . He was convinced that the marriage was a fatal one for Dorothea . But amid that mass ran a vein of which he was too good and honourable a man to like the avowal even to himself : it was undeniable that the union of the two estates — Tipton and Freshitt — lying charmingly within a ring - fence , was a prospect that flattered him for his son and heir . Hence when Mr. Brooke noddingly appealed to that motive , Sir James felt a sudden embarrassment ; there was a stoppage in his throat ; he even blushed . He had found more words than usual in the first jet of his anger , but Mr. Brooke 's propitiation was more clogging to his tongue than Mr. Cadwallader 's caustic hint . But Celia was glad to have room for speech after her uncle 's suggestion of the marriage ceremony , and she said , though with as little eagerness of manner as if the question had turned on an invitation to dinner , "
362591	362592	362578	362578	you	6579	" "
362600	362607	362578	362578	you	6579	" said Mr. Brooke , helplessly . "
362618	362634	362616	362616	Cadwallader	251	" he added , turning for a little countenance toward the Rector , who said — "
362688	362694	362695	362695	she	253	" continued the provoking husband ; "
362760	362761	362762	362762	Humphrey	488	" "
362774	362779	362762	362762	Humphrey	488	" said his wife . "
362822	362823	362825	362826	a clergyman	816	" "
362829	362836	362825	362826	a clergyman	816	" observed Lady Chettam with approbation . "
362863	362894	362861	362861	James	177	" Sir James gave a small grunt , which was less respectful than his usual mode of answering his mother . Celia looked up at him like a thoughtful kitten . "
362907	362912	362937	362939	an old clo	6594	" said Mrs. Cadwallader . "
362941	362942	362937	362939	an old clo	6594	" "
362947	362954	362945	362945	Elinor	253	" said the Rector , rising . "
362963	362964	362968	362968	he	261	" "
362974	362988	362989	362989	He	261	" said Mrs. Cadwallader , rising too , and wishing to make amends . "
363003	363004	362989	362989	He	261	" "
363011	363021	363005	363005	I	0	" said Mr. Brooke , starting up with alacrity . "
363044	363045	363046	363046	You	0	" "
363054	363064	363052	363052	you	177	" said Celia , taking her husband 's hand . "
363074	363095	363052	363052	you	177	" said Sir James , pulling down his waistcoat , but unable yet to adjust his face good - humoredly . "
363110	363111	363052	363052	you	177	" "
363118	363127	363052	363052	you	177	" said Mr. Brooke , understanding the condition . "
363144	363156	363158	363158	you	177	" When Sir James and Celia were alone , she said , "
363172	363173	363170	363170	James	177	" "
363180	363188	363170	363170	James	177	" he answered , with some surprise . "
363196	363200	363170	363170	James	177	" said Celia . "
363211	363216	363205	363205	I	0	" said Sir James . "
363224	363225	363205	363205	I	0	" "
363251	363416	363244	363244	Briggs	797	" Celia thought it was of great use , if not to say that , at least to take a journey to Lowick in order to influence Dorothea 's mind . All through their girlhood she had felt that she could act on her sister by a word judiciously placed — by opening a little window for the daylight of her own understanding to enter among the strange coloured lamps by which Dodo habitually saw . And Celia the matron naturally felt more able to advise her childless sister . How could any one understand Dodo so well as Celia did or love her so tenderly ? Dorothea , busy in her boudoir , felt a glow of pleasure at the sight of her sister so soon after the revelation of her intended marriage . She had prefigured to herself , even with exaggeration , the disgust of her friends , and she had even feared that Celia might be kept aloof from her . "
363427	363444	363420	363420	I	0	" said Dorothea , putting her hands on Celia 's shoulders , and beaming on her . "
363455	363456	363448	363448	you	216	" "
363470	363491	363464	363464	I	0	" said Celia , and they sat down on two small chairs opposite each other , with their knees touching . "
363502	363520	363521	363521	You	6604	" said Celia , in her placid guttural , looking as prettily free from humors as possible . "
363588	363589	363565	363565	James	177	" "
363596	363600	363565	363565	James	177	" said Dorothea , "
363619	363620	363610	363610	I	0	" "
363734	363738	363722	363722	you	6604	" Dorothea laughed . "
363748	363756	363746	363746	Dodo	184	" said Celia , becoming more impressive . "
363794	363814	363790	363790	you	6604	" Celia 's rare tears had got into her eyes , and the corners of her mouth were agitated . "
363818	363826	363790	363790	you	6604	" said Dorothea , with tender gravity , "
363842	363843	363828	363828	you	6604	" "
363849	363863	363828	363828	you	6604	" said Celia , with the same touching distortion of her small features . "
363927	363928	363924	363924	you	6604	" "
363935	363939	363929	363929	I	0	" said Dorothea . "
363975	363976	363967	363967	I	0	" "
363982	363990	363967	363967	I	0	" said Dorothea , with gentle warmth . "
364002	364003	363995	363995	James	177	" "
364017	364031	364051	364051	James	177	" said Celia , drying her eyes , and returning to her argument ; "
364109	364110	364100	364100	you	6604	" "
364125	364129	364116	364116	I	0	" said Dorothea , "
364171	364209	364169	364169	him	261	" The tone in which Dorothea said this was a note that Celia had long learned to recognize . She was silent a few moments , and then said , as if she had dismissed all contest , "
364219	364220	364211	364211	he	261	" "
364232	364233	364230	364230	him	261	" "
364238	364244	364230	364230	him	261	" said Celia , comfortably . "
364272	364286	364287	364287	I	0	" Dorothea smiled , and Celia looked rather meditative . Presently she said , "
364297	364309	364310	364310	I	0	" Celia thought it would be pleasant to hear the story . "
364315	364325	364310	364310	I	0	" said Dorothea , pinching her sister 's chin . "
364342	364343	364346	364346	you	6604	" "
364350	364359	364346	364346	you	6604	" said Celia , settling her arms cozily . "
364378	364875	364880	364880	you	6617	" When immortal Bunyan makes his picture of the persecuting passions bringing in their verdict of guilty , who pities Faithful ? That is a rare and blessed lot which some greatest men have not attained , to know ourselves guiltless before a condemning crowd — to be sure that what we are denounced for is solely the good in us . The pitiable lot is that of the man who could not call himself a martyr even though he were to persuade himself that the men who stoned him were but ugly passions incarnate — who knows that he is stoned , not for professing the Right , but for not being the man he professed to be . This was the consciousness that Bulstrode was withering under while he made his preparations for departing from Middlemarch , and going to end his stricken life in that sad refuge , the indifference of new faces . The duteous merciful constancy of his wife had delivered him from one dread , but it could not hinder her presence from being still a tribunal before which he shrank from confession and desired advocacy . His equivocations with himself about the death of Raffles had sustained the conception of an Omniscience whom he prayed to , yet he had a terror upon him which would not let him expose them to judgment by a full confession to his wife : the acts which he had washed and diluted with inward argument and motive , and for which it seemed comparatively easy to win invisible pardon — what name would she call them by ? That she should ever silently call his acts Murder was what he could not bear . He felt shrouded by her doubt : he got strength to face her from the sense that she could not yet feel warranted in pronouncing that worst condemnation on him . Some time , perhaps — when he was dying — he would tell her all : in the deep shadow of that time , when she held his hand in the gathering darkness , she might listen without recoiling from his touch . Perhaps : but concealment had been the habit of his life , and the impulse to confession had no power against the dread of a deeper humiliation . He was full of timid care for his wife , not only because he deprecated any harshness of judgment from her , but because he felt a deep distress at the sight of her suffering . She had sent her daughters away to board at a school on the coast , that this crisis might be hidden from them as far as possible . Set free by their absence from the intolerable necessity of accounting for her grief or of beholding their frightened wonder , she could live unconstrainedly with the sorrow that was every day streaking her hair with whiteness and making her eyelids languid . "
364890	364897	364898	364898	I	0	" Bulstrode had said to her ; "
364949	364987	364988	364988	I	0	" A few days afterwards , when she had returned from a visit to her brother 's , she began to speak to her husband on a subject which had for some time been in her mind . "
365067	365083	365018	365018	Walter	475	" Mrs. Bulstrode did not wish to go nearer to the facts than in the phrase "
365088	365122	365018	365018	Walter	475	" knowing that her husband must understand her . He had a particular reason , which she was not aware of , for wincing under her suggestion . He hesitated before he said — "
365178	365297	365175	365175	his	278	" The letter seemed to cut Mrs. Bulstrode severely . The mention of Mrs. Casaubon 's loan seemed a reflection of that public feeling which held it a matter of course that every one would avoid a connection with her husband . She was silent for some time ; and the tears fell one after the other , her chin trembling as she wiped them away . Bulstrode , sitting opposite to her , ached at the sight of that grief - worn face , which two months before had been bright and blooming . It had aged to keep sad company with his own withered features . Urged into some effort at comforting her , he said — "
365355	365360	365361	365361	Garth	441	" She looked attentive . "
365433	365434	365431	365431	you	338	" "
365440	365451	365431	365431	you	338	" said Mrs. Bulstrode , with some return of energy . "
365484	365485	365486	365486	You	338	" "
365497	365529	365493	365493	yourself	338	" said Mr. Bulstrode , not liking what he had to say , but desiring the end he had in view , for other reasons besides the consolation of his wife . "
365620	365642	365598	365598	I	0	" Mrs. Garth , hearing Caleb enter the passage about tea - time , opened the parlor - door and said , "
365655	365665	365652	365652	your	6642	" ( Mr. Garth 's meals were much subordinated to "
365668	365670	365652	365652	your	6642	" ) "
365691	365692	365699	365699	I	0	" "

365725	365750	365723	365723	Caleb	441	" said Mrs. Garth , seeing that her absent - minded husband was putting on again the hat which he had just taken off . "
365764	365860	365755	365755	I	0	" Mary was in a grassy corner of the garden , where there was a swing loftily hung between two pear - trees . She had a pink kerchief tied over her head , making a little poke to shade her eyes from the level sunbeams , while she was giving a glorious swing to Letty , who laughed and screamed wildly . Seeing her father , Mary left the swing and went to meet him , pushing back the pink kerchief and smiling afar off at him with the involuntary smile of loving pleasure . "
365870	365875	365868	365868	Mary	301	" said Mr. Garth . "
365883	365946	365868	365868	Mary	301	" Mary knew quite well that her father had something particular to say : his eyebrows made their pathetic angle , and there was a tender gravity in his voice : these things had been signs to her when she was Letty 's age . She put her arm within his , and they turned by the row of nut - trees . "
365961	365986	365959	365959	Mary	301	" said her father , not looking at her , but at the end of the stick which he held in his other hand . "
366000	366006	365994	365994	I	0	" said Mary , laughingly . "
366036	366058	366023	366023	I	0	" Then , after a little pause , she said , more gravely , bending her face before her father 's , "
366066	366079	366060	366060	you	887	" Caleb screwed up his mouth and turned his head aside wisely . "
366108	366109	366091	366091	You	887	" "
366113	366120	366111	366111	I	0	" said Caleb , rather slyly . "
366139	366143	366123	366123	I	0	" said Mary . "

366280	366290	366278	366278	Mary	301	" said Caleb , returning to his first tone . "
366312	366324	366337	366337	her	6894	" ( Caleb meant a great deal in that vague phrase ;) "
366349	366350	366340	366340	she'll	6894	" "
366359	366365	366357	366357	father	887	" said Mary , calmly . "
366447	366475	366443	366443	Fred	261	" Instead of speaking immediately , Caleb stood still and screwed his stick on the grassy walk . Then he said , with emotion in his voice , "
366505	366506	366488	366488	you	0	" "
366515	366521	366522	366522	He	261	" said Mary , wonderingly . "

366951	366969	366896	366906	an inferior class of men , who require keeping in order	6680	" said Mary , as Fred stood still and raised his hat to her with playful formality . "

367315	367346	367310	367310	he	2000	" said Mary , looking up at Fred now , while he grasped her hand as they walked , till it rather hurt her ; but she would not complain . "

367427	367435	367425	367425	Mary	301	" said Fred , with strong feeling . "
367460	367461	367425	367425	Mary	301	" "
367483	367516	367478	367478	I	0	" said Mary , in a tone of obedient recitation . They lingered on the door - step under the steep - roofed porch , and Fred almost in a whisper said — "
367535	367573	367574	367574	Fred	261	" The spirit of joy began to laugh more decidedly in Mary 's eyes , but the fatal Ben came running to the door with Brownie yapping behind him , and , bouncing against them , said — "
367589	367861	367579	367579	you	301	" Every limit is a beginning as well as an ending . Who can quit young lives after being long in company with them , and not desire to know what befell them in their after - years ? For the fragment of a life , however typical , is not the sample of an even web : promises may not be kept , and an ardent outset may be followed by declension ; latent powers may find their long - waited opportunity ; a past error may urge a grand retrieval . Marriage , which has been the bourne of so many narratives , is still a great beginning , as it was to Adam and Eve , who kept their honeymoon in Eden , but had their first little one among the thorns and thistles of the wilderness . It is still the beginning of the home epic — the gradual conquest or irremediable loss of that complete union which makes the advancing years a climax , and age the harvest of sweet memories in common . Some set out , like Crusaders of old , with a glorious equipment of hope and enthusiasm and get broken by the way , wanting patience with each other and the world . All who have cared for Fred Vincy and Mary Garth will like to know that these two made no such failure , but achieved a solid mutual happiness . Fred surprised his neighbors in various ways . He became rather distinguished in his side of the county as a theoretic and practical farmer , and produced a work on the "
367873	367938	367579	367579	you	301	" which won him high congratulations at agricultural meetings . In Middlemarch admiration was more reserved : most persons there were inclined to believe that the merit of Fred 's authorship was due to his wife , since they had never expected Fred Vincy to write on turnips and mangel - wurzel . But when Mary wrote a little book for her boys , called "
367948	367988	367579	367579	you	301	" and had it printed and published by Gripp & Co. , Middlemarch , every one in the town was willing to give the credit of this work to Fred , observing that he had been to the University , "
367995	368254	367579	367579	you	301	" and might have been a clergyman if he had chosen . In this way it was made clear that Middlemarch had never been deceived , and that there was no need to praise anybody for writing a book , since it was always done by somebody else . Moreover , Fred remained unswervingly steady . Some years after his marriage he told Mary that his happiness was half owing to Farebrother , who gave him a strong pull - up at the right moment . I can not say that he was never again misled by his hopefulness : the yield of crops or the profits of a cattle sale usually fell below his estimate ; and he was always prone to believe that he could make money by the purchase of a horse which turned out badly — though this , Mary observed , was of course the fault of the horse , not of Fred 's judgment . He kept his love of horsemanship , but he rarely allowed himself a day 's hunting ; and when he did so , it was remarkable that he submitted to be laughed at for cowardliness at the fences , seeming to see Mary and the boys sitting on the five - barred gate , or showing their curly heads between hedge and ditch . There were three boys : Mary was not discontented that she brought forth men - children only ; and when Fred wished to have a girl like her , she said , laughingly , "
368266	368304	368306	368307	the Garths	302	" Mrs. Vincy in her declining years , and in the diminished lustre of her housekeeping , was much comforted by her perception that two at least of Fred 's boys were real Vincys , and did not "
368309	368484	368306	368307	the Garths	302	" But Mary secretly rejoiced that the youngest of the three was very much what her father must have been when he wore a round jacket , and showed a marvellous nicety of aim in playing at marbles , or in throwing stones to bring down the mellow pears . Ben and Letty Garth , who were uncle and aunt before they were well in their teens , disputed much as to whether nephews or nieces were more desirable ; Ben contending that it was clear girls were good for less than boys , else they would not be always in petticoats , which showed how little they were meant for ; whereupon Letty , who argued much from books , got angry in replying that God made coats of skins for both Adam and Eve alike — also it occurred to her that in the East the men too wore petticoats . But this latter argument , obscuring the majesty of the former , was one too many , for Ben answered contemptuously , "
368490	368613	368488	368488	they	6699	" and immediately appealed to his mother whether boys were not better than girls . Mrs. Garth pronounced that both were alike naughty , but that boys were undoubtedly stronger , could run faster , and throw with more precision to a greater distance . With this oracular sentence Ben was well satisfied , not minding the naughtiness ; but Letty took it ill , her feeling of superiority being stronger than her muscles . Fred never became rich — his hopefulness had not led him to expect that ; but he gradually saved enough to become owner of the stock and furniture at Stone Court , and the work which Mr. Garth put into his hands carried him in plenty through those "
368616	368742	368743	368743	He	6700	" which are always present with farmers . Mary , in her matronly days , became as solid in figure as her mother ; but , unlike her , gave the boys little formal teaching , so that Mrs. Garth was alarmed lest they should never be well grounded in grammar and geography . Nevertheless , they were found quite forward enough when they went to school ; perhaps , because they had liked nothing so well as being with their mother . When Fred was riding home on winter evenings he had a pleasant vision beforehand of the bright hearth in the wainscoted parlor , and was sorry for other men who could not have Mary for their wife ; especially for Mr. Farebrother . "
368754	368764	368743	368743	He	6700	" Fred could now say to her , magnanimously . "
368771	368775	368768	368768	he	6700	" Mary answered ; "
368814	369207	368788	368788	you	6700	" On inquiry it might possibly be found that Fred and Mary still inhabit Stone Court — that the creeping plants still cast the foam of their blossoms over the fine stone - wall into the field where the walnut - trees stand in stately row — and that on sunny days the two lovers who were first engaged with the umbrella - ring may be seen in white - haired placidity at the open window from which Mary Garth , in the days of old Peter Featherstone , had often been ordered to look out for Mr. Lydgate . Lydgate 's hair never became white . He died when he was only fifty , leaving his wife and children provided for by a heavy insurance on his life . He had gained an excellent practice , alternating , according to the season , between London and a Continental bathing - place ; having written a treatise on Gout , a disease which has a good deal of wealth on its side . His skill was relied on by many paying patients , but he always regarded himself as a failure : he had not done what he once meant to do . His acquaintances thought him enviable to have so charming a wife , and nothing happened to shake their opinion . Rosamond never committed a second compromising indiscretion . She simply continued to be mild in her temper , inflexible in her judgment , disposed to admonish her husband , and able to frustrate him by stratagem . As the years went on he opposed her less and less , whence Rosamond concluded that he had learned the value of her opinion ; on the other hand , she had a more thorough conviction of his talents now that he gained a good income , and instead of the threatened cage in Bride Street provided one all flowers and gilding , fit for the bird of paradise that she resembled . In brief , Lydgate was what is called a successful man . But he died prematurely of diphtheria , and Rosamond afterwards married an elderly and wealthy physician , who took kindly to her four children . She made a very pretty show with her daughters , driving out in her carriage , and often spoke of her happiness as "
369209	369931	369960	369960	she	7123	reward"—she did not say for what , but probably she meant that it was a reward for her patience with Tertius , whose temper never became faultless , and to the last occasionally let slip a bitter speech which was more memorable than the signs he made of his repentance . He once called her his basil plant ; and when she asked for an explanation , said that basil was a plant which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man 's brains . Rosamond had a placid but strong answer to such speeches . Why then had he chosen her ? It was a pity he had not had Mrs. Ladislaw , whom he was always praising and placing above her . And thus the conversation ended with the advantage on Rosamond 's side . But it would be unjust not to tell , that she never uttered a word in depreciation of Dorothea , keeping in religious remembrance the generosity which had come to her aid in the sharpest crisis of her life . Dorothea herself had no dreams of being praised above other women , feeling that there was always something better which she might have done , if she had only been better and known better . Still , she never repented that she had given up position and fortune to marry Will Ladislaw , and he would have held it the greatest shame as well as sorrow to him if she had repented . They were bound to each other by a love stronger than any impulses which could have marred it . No life would have been possible to Dorothea which was not filled with emotion , and she had now a life filled also with a beneficent activity which she had not the doubtful pains of discovering and marking out for herself . Will became an ardent public man , working well in those times when reforms were begun with a young hopefulness of immediate good which has been much checked in our days , and getting at last returned to Parliament by a constituency who paid his expenses . Dorothea could have liked nothing better , since wrongs existed , than that her husband should be in the thick of a struggle against them , and that she should give him wifely help . Many who knew her , thought it a pity that so substantive and rare a creature should have been absorbed into the life of another , and be only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother . But no one stated exactly what else that was in her power she ought rather to have done — not even Sir James Chettam , who went no further than the negative prescription that she ought not to have married Will Ladislaw . But this opinion of his did not cause a lasting alienation ; and the way in which the family was made whole again was characteristic of all concerned . Mr. Brooke could not resist the pleasure of corresponding with Will and Dorothea ; and one morning when his pen had been remarkably fluent on the prospects of Municipal Reform , it ran off into an invitation to the Grange , which , once written , could not be done away with at less cost than the sacrifice ( hardly to be conceived ) of the whole valuable letter . During the months of this correspondence Mr. Brooke had continually , in his talk with Sir James Chettam , been presupposing or hinting that the intention of cutting off the entail was still maintained ; and the day on which his pen gave the daring invitation , he went to Freshitt expressly to intimate that he had a stronger sense than ever of the reasons for taking that energetic step as a precaution against any mixture of low blood in the heir of the Brookes . But that morning something exciting had happened at the Hall . A letter had come to Celia which made her cry silently as she read it ; and when Sir James , unused to see her in tears , asked anxiously what was the matter , she burst out in a wail such as he had never heard from her before . "
370021	370022	370013	370013	you	6704	" "
370028	370037	370040	370040	you	169	" said Sir James , much wrought upon , "
370064	370128	370050	370050	I	0	" And Celia did wish it . It was after this that Mr. Brooke came , and meeting the Baronet in the grounds , began to chat with him in ignorance of the news , which Sir James for some reason did not care to tell him immediately . But when the entail was touched on in the usual way , he said , "
370162	370485	370486	370488	a nice woman	6709	" Mr. Brooke felt so much surprised that he did not at once find out how much he was relieved by the sense that he was not expected to do anything in particular . Such being the bent of Celia 's heart , it was inevitable that Sir James should consent to a reconciliation with Dorothea and her husband . Where women love each other , men learn to smother their mutual dislike . Sir James never liked Ladislaw , and Will always preferred to have Sir James 's company mixed with another kind : they were on a footing of reciprocal tolerance which was made quite easy only when Dorothea and Celia were present . It became an understood thing that Mr. and Mrs. Ladislaw should pay at least two visits during the year to the Grange , and there came gradually a small row of cousins at Freshitt who enjoyed playing with the two cousins visiting Tipton as much as if the blood of these cousins had been less dubiously mixed . Mr. Brooke lived to a good old age , and his estate was inherited by Dorothea 's son , who might have represented Middlemarch , but declined , thinking that his opinions had less chance of being stifled if he remained out of doors . Sir James never ceased to regard Dorothea 's second marriage as a mistake ; and indeed this remained the tradition concerning it in Middlemarch , where she was spoken of to a younger generation as a fine girl who married a sickly clergyman , old enough to be her father , and in little more than a year after his death gave up her estate to marry his cousin — young enough to have been his son , with no property , and not well - born . Those who had not seen anything of Dorothea usually observed that she could not have been "
