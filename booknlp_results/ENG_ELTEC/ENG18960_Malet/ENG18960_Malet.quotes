2106	2112	2113	2113	I	0	“ A devil , Leversedge , ”
2118	2303	2304	2304	Leversedge	71	“ Do n't let us approach the question in the plural number . It becomes too complicated , too crowded . One devil,—one surely is enough for all practical purposes ? In the singular he is precious , though archaic ; and , if only for dramatic and literary reasons , I do n't think we can afford to abolish him . He supplies the dash of absolute black , you see , which brings out all the delicate lights and shades of the moral picture . Without him the nuances would lose their values . No , we must keep one . He may be of any size you like,—quite a small one if you wish it , a veritable little ewe - lamb of a devil . But for the sake of his colour,—I am getting slightly mixed as to sex , I fancy , but my knowledge of the sheepfold is scarcely professional,—well , of its colour , which is black , you understand , uncompromising black , I implore that one , just one , may be spared to us . ”
2323	2332	2333	2333	he	71	“ I was not talking of property devils , ”
2336	2430	2333	2333	he	71	“ and they would hardly serve your purpose anyhow ; for they seem to make them red nowadays , mostly , not black . I saw Faust last time I was home , at the Lyceum ; but I did n't think the scarlet variety patronised there amounted to very much . They were altogether too solid . You know , at a push you could do for them,—shoot , or stick , or strangle them . You must be an uncommonly poor lot if you find things frightening that you could strangle . ”
2438	2441	2442	2442	he	71	“ No , ”
2446	2501	2442	2442	he	71	“ I — I mean you — I mean nobody 's afraid of what they can strangle . Even when I was home last , I could have supplied the management with the ground - plan of a much nastier species of fiend than those hairy , pudding - bodied creatures . And now — ”
2538	2542	2543	2543	he	71	“ Get down , ”
2546	2552	2543	2543	he	71	“ you brute,—you hideous brute . ”
2998	3006	3007	3007	he	71	“ I beg your pardon , Hammond , ”
3015	3067	3068	3068	He	71	“ This has not happened to me for some time , and it took me by surprise . I do n't make such a fool of myself when I am in training — when I 'm habitually hag - ridden . But I 've been pretty free of all that lately . ”
3084	3093	3094	3094	he	71	“ Now , do you believe in devils ? ”
3097	3106	3094	3094	he	71	“ Real ones , I mean,—not property devils . ”
3107	3117	3118	3118	I	0	“ I believe in liver , my dear friend , ”
3121	3160	3118	3118	I	0	“ And still more sincerely do I believe in nerves , which are superior in the production of torments to all the Satans generated by the unhealthy imaginations of all ascetics , Oriental and mediæval , put together . ”
3161	3175	3176	3176	he	71	“ And still more readily do you believe in drink , I suppose , ”
3180	3253	3176	3176	he	71	“ Only let me remind you , the monsters that haunt drunkards do it openly in broad day . You can see them , so they tell me , as plain as your hand . Now , I only see this beast at night , when the lights are out and there 's no moon . And even then only — only part of it . By day I only feel it . ”
3273	3315	3261	3261	he	71	“ When I begin to see it in the light , I shall have sense enough left to look for the nearest lunatic asylum , I hope . Or put an end to the business in an even more effectual manner . ”
3411	3417	3418	3418	he	71	“ You 're extremely kind , ”
3421	3466	3467	3467	He	71	“ but this is nothing new . It 's been going on for ever so long . I 've tried drugs , and dieting , and doctors — they make no difference . I hoped perhaps coming back to Europe and the old life — ”
3483	3488	3489	3489	he	71	“ Smoke , please , ”
3492	3552	3489	3489	he	71	“ Do you mind my telling you ? I 've never told anybody before . The best and the worst things that happen to you , you keep to yourself as a rule , you know . But — but — I'm rather knocked about by what 's just occurred . I should be glad to have you know . ”
3566	3799	3562	3562	Leversedge	78	“ It began like this — I had been riding for a couple of days expecting to strike a mining camp where I had business . But I 'd fever on me , and got out of my course . Do you know the Veldt , Hammond ? Of course you don't — the endless roll of the treeless land , under the dome of the thick , tropic sky , both alike grey with the heavy , deadly heat . It gets you with a sort of despair . You look at it as you might look at a sentence of penal servitude for life . The monotony takes the heart out of you — that , and the heat , the killing heat . At last the hazy warming - pan of a sun went down , and the dark came quick , and I muddled on pretty well done . And , from the top of one of those everlasting bare ridges , I saw the white tilts of a couple of waggons showing up about half a mile away . It was n't my camp , but it meant something in the way of rest and help . At least , I thought so at first , though there was no smoke , and the whole place seemed unaccountably quiet , save for the yapping of a dog . ”
3813	3823	3824	3824	he	78	“ I need n't go into details , Hammond , ”
3827	4072	3824	3824	he	78	“ That camp was dead . Even in the night , which decently hides a good deal , it was a ghastly place . I suppose they 'd all died of thirst , they and the oxen . And I had fever on me . I shall never know quite all I did see . But in one of the waggons I made out a dead woman . Underneath it a dog was tied , a small , yellowish cur , the only thing left alive , and it yapped . And — and — there had been a child in the waggon , a little baby - child — and I suppose it had lived longer than the rest . And it must have crawled out over the tail of the waggon , and fallen close to the dog . It lay there , a white bundle of a thing in the gloom . And the dog squatted with its forepaws out across the child 's chest , its eyes showing green , straining at the rope which tied it . And bending down from the saddle — I was too weak with fever to get off — my horse , too , would have scared , it was half mad at — well — at the death all round it , and the stench — I saw that the brute had torn the child 's throat — for — for the blood . ”
4116	4123	4124	4124	he	307	“ I know it was starving , ”
4127	4238	4124	4124	he	307	“ and — which is worse — it was parched . Men have done as bad things before now at sea,—only , I tell you , Hammond , I had to kill that dog . I could not afford to squander cartridges , but I could spare a couple . Twice I tried it , but my revolver was heavy , and I was altogether played out , so that my hand shook . The bullets only cut the rope . And then — then — I was taken with a sort of panic , Hammond . I cleared out of that awful place ; and the dog came too . ”
4277	4334	4256	4256	he	307	“ It kept pace with my horse . Those dreadful eyes looking up at me — two yellowish - green discs galloping beside me , dropping behind for a minute or two , coming up with me again , mile after mile , all through the night . And the night seemed years and years long — ”
4443	4458	4434	4434	myself	0	“ Well , my dear fellow , well ? That 's not the end ? ”
4520	4529	4530	4530	he	78	“ No , that 's not the end , ”
4535	4971	4530	4530	he	78	“ that 's only the beginning.—I need not bother you with the whole set out . I was pretty bad for some time ; though I stumbled across my own people next day , and we struck a vein of luck at our mining place , and the money was rolling in hand over hand . It seemed as if the curse and the gold had come together.—As soon as I could move I went down to the coast and got away to sea . And I thought it was all right . We were a couple of degrees south of the equator , and there had been a bad electric storm which had made us all feel pretty jumpy ; but the rain had come down and the weather was mending . Everyone else had gone under cover — some music and singing was going on in the saloon — and I was standing forward against the bulwarks with the doctor . He was a nice little chap — tremendously keen on travel and on natural history . He died of fever a year and a half afterwards , I heard , exploring somewhere up the Congo . I 've always been sorry he dropped out . There was good stuff in him.—But about this affair of mine . It must have been about half - past eight , and it was very close notwithstanding the rain ; and very dark , but for the glimmer through the slats of the saloon shutters . And right along the length of the promenade deck , straight at us , came a dog , just as hard as it could lick . I only saw its eyes,—two glowing green discs a trifle bigger than a sixpence,—but there was no mistaking what they were . They travelled along about nine inches above the level of the deck , sometimes higher , sometimes lower , as the thing galloped . It turned , just short of us , round the end of the saloon , and went , as I supposed , down the other side of the deck . I spoke to the doctor about it — I hoped there might be a dog on board I did not know of — but he had n't observed anything . Then the eyes came racing up our side of the deck again . I pointed them out to him , still he did n't see . Still I had a sort of hope about me , so I knelt down and whistled the brute to come to me . ”
5022	5026	5027	5027	he	78	“ It came , ”
5030	5294	5295	5295	he	322	“ The eyes were close to me,—quite close . People are sentimental on board ship , you know . A girl was singing ‘ Annie Laurie ’ in the saloon . She 'd an uncommonly pretty voice . I heard the words of the song quite distinctly ; that and the swish of the water against the side , and the steady pounding of the engines , as I put out my hand to pat the beast 's head . And my hand went down , clean down , within a couple of inches of those eyes , where its neck should have been — where its neck was — I swear it was — clean down on to the wet planks of the deck.—Then I knew something very evil was upon me . In that dead camp I had seen the Thing - too - Much.—For there is a Thing - too - Much , you know , in nature , in men and women , in what happens . And you may tell by the look in a person 's face whether they 've seen it . They may n't be cowards ; most fairly healthy people have really plenty of pluck . Only , I tell you what takes it out of the bravest . They have seen Fear,—Fear itself , that there 's no getting over or arguing about . They 've been ‘ to the end of the world and looked over the wall,’—they got to the place from which there 's no way out.—Oh ! I say , ”

6030	6084	6027	6027	he	84	“ You see , we have returned . Not all the darts of the sun - god — torrid sunshine to - day , I 'm sure , really torrid — could detain us any longer . Even in the gayest scenes , the most intellectually stimulating society , the heart of the true woman”—Mr
6099	6166	6086	6086	Perry	60	Leversedge—“draws her back to ‘ the kindred points of heaven and home . ’ Hotel and heaven and home , as I may say in this case ; which is accurate in fact , and pleasing to the ear as alliteration , eh , Mr. Hammond ? Yes , thank you , we have had a charming party , really a delightful party,—haven't we , Mamma ? ”
6208	6211	6212	6212	he	84	“ Delightful , ”
6221	6265	6212	6212	he	84	“ and most gratifying to us as — as the authors of her days , as I may say — wasn't it , Mamma?—to witness the high estimation in which our dear Charlotte is held by really superior persons . Nothing new , of course,”—Mr
6285	6371	6267	6267	Perry	60	permitted;—“but testimony to an old truth , if that truth be pleasing , is always welcome . And she sustained her part in the conversation victoriously . I do not exaggerate when I employ the word victorious . Really there are moments when my daughter 's knowledge of all subjects that come under discussion almost staggers me . It is encyclopædic , I 'm sure,—positively encyclopædic . I listen and admire and — Still the wonder growsHow one small head can carry all she knows . ”

And it seemed to me Charlotte talked as cleverly as any of them ; at least I understood quite as little of what she meant . And it always shows people are saying what is clever when you ca n't make out what they mean ; do n't you think so , Mr. Hammond ? ”

6706	6722	6723	6723	she	62	sighed.—“It seems to me clever people , like Charlotte 's friends , are so strong , ”
6726	6779	6723	6723	she	62	“ They often look delicate , and yet somehow they always seem ready to go anywhere , and do anything , and talk . They never seem overcome with the heat , or the cold either , for that matter . I 'm sure it must be very nice to feel like — ”

6787	6972	6723	6723	she	62	Perry,—“habit — there is a vast amount in that . I declare I hesitate to limit the power of habit . But I wish you had been with us , Mr. Hammond . You would have appreciated the conversation , and no doubt increased its charms — no doubt increased them . One brief passage of arms between my daughter and Mr. Percy Gerrard , upon the place of the imagination in modern realistic fiction , was brilliant , positively brilliant . And so the wordy battle grew , swelling almost to dissonance;Then broke in laughter , and , with courteous phrase , Sunk back to sweet agreement — this the end . And Mertyns told some very good stories towards the conclusion of lunch . One of the late Earl of Beaconsfield , which was new to me . A first - rate story — not more so than some of my own , but still first - rate . Just remind me , after dinner , my dear , and I 'll tell it to Mr. Hammond . It will amuse him . ”
6973	7010	7011	7012	Mrs. Perry	62	“ Yes , but it seems a pity you could n't have heard Mr. Mertyns tell it himself ; for it seemed to me everybody would have been so glad to see you , Mr. Hammond , ”
7015	7059	7011	7012	Mrs. Perry	62	“ They all seemed so surprised to hear you were at this hotel with us . Mrs. St. John said she wondered what on earth you could be doing here , and that she wished so much you would come and tell her . ”
7060	7081	7082	7082	I	0	“ Mrs. St. John is a delightful woman , and if she is very good perhaps I will tell her , ”

7286	7332	7267	7267	he	84	“ Mr. Hammond , a legend obtains that you are a lawyer . I hope that it is true , for I stand in great need of an advocate . Constantine is obdurate , he is grasping . Plead my cause with him , pray . ”

7656	7740	7653	7653	she	60	“ it is very lovely , is n't it ? The scheme of colour is perfect — you feel colour , do n't you , Mr. Hammond ? These gradations are delicious , from white through those faint flesh tones , rose - saffron , and rose to this heart of passionate crimson . Do not let Constantine coerce me into marring its perfection . Plead for it . You are a poet . Save it , for is it not a poem ? ”
7741	7745	7746	7746	Leversedge	58	“ Is it ? ”

7908	7961	7905	7905	I	0	“ Therefore your wish to preserve your charming nosegay intact may be — I do not assert that it is , I only suggest that it may be — every bit as culpable as Leversedge 's very natural wish to convert a portion of it into a favour for his unregenerate buttonhole . ”
7962	7994	7870	7870	she	65	“ Do you really mean that ? I should have thought harmony was always dearer than discord , preservation than destruction . To me that scheme of colour represents the birth and growth”—Miss

In his youth he produced a witty and improper novel , which everybody said it was impossible to read , and everybody promptly read . It affected to be autobiographical . Now he has ceased to be immoral — at all events in print — having laid to heart the golden maxim that public confession of the sins of others is , on the whole , an even more paying speculation than public confession of sins of your own . I am afraid he has also ceased to be witty . That is a matter for regret . ”

9636	9695	9633	9633	he	84	“ we must school ourselves , we must school ourselves — To wait and hope , and still to hope and wait , Last lesson learned by man of heaven directed fate . But I am not among the pessimists , Mr. Hammond . I can look forward , I am thankful to say , and look up . ”
9758	9765	9766	9767	Mr. Perry	84	“ Ah , you misconceive me , ”
9785	9870	9871	9871	he	84	eyebrows.—“You misconceive me . I fear other dangers than material ones just now,—a father 's anxieties , natural and not I think condemnable where the future of so dear an object as an only daughter is concerned . Frankly , then,—for in speaking to you I speak to a man of the world , Mr. Hammond,—our charming friends , Mrs. Septimus Mertyns and Mr. Gerrard , have called . They are actually here , they are indoors with Mamma . And it annoys me , ”
9874	10065	9871	9871	he	84	“ I can not disguise from myself that it annoys me profoundly , my daughter should not be at home to receive them . Constantine shows himself inconsiderate in detaining her so long . I thought it probable our friends would visit us this afternoon , and I gave him a pretty broad hint on the subject . I regret to say so — but you must have observed it yourself , Mr. Hammond — Constantine Leversedge is obtuse , unhappily obtuse ; he is insufficiently sensible of his social privileges . Having been deprived of intellectual advantages , and the enjoyment of intercourse with persons of superior gifts and position for so long , I should have expected him to prize these things highly . But unfortunately it is not so . He displays , is displaying at this moment , in my opinion , a lamentable indifference to an opportunity of cultivating a most valuable acquaintance . I hoped he had taken my hint . He assured me he would return soon after five . Unless I am very much mistaken , six will be striking almost immediately . ”
10241	10245	10234	10235	the poets	387	“ will not stay ”
10247	10264	10265	10265	he	84	“ Ah yes , the young will be young , will be young , Mr. Hammond , ”
10268	10354	10265	10265	he	84	“ It therefore is incumbent upon those who , like Mamma and myself , have reached what I may term the watershed of our terrestrial existence , to watch attentively and prevent the commission of thoughtless indiscretion on the part of our youthful relatives . Keep a sharp look - out on our green apples , our green apples , ah ha!—eh ? And society is not to be trifled with . Not — but , excuse me , this time I do perceive them . ”
11207	11212	11202	11203	the authorities	434	“ is far better . ”
11410	11415	11417	11417	Leversedge	58	“ do not happen . ”
11568	11584	11585	11585	he	58	“ Oh , I beg your pardon , Hammond ; I did n't see you , ”
11588	11650	11585	11585	he	58	“ We 've been having a very jolly time out on the water . It really is a glorious afternoon . But the sunshine 's rather dazzling . It strikes right up in your face off the surface of the lake in a blinding sort of way . Well , what have you been doing ? Been amusing yourself over there ? ”
11651	11657	11658	11658	I	0	“ With the wisest moderation , ”
11661	11706	11658	11658	I	0	“ My joys during the last two days have had nothing bacchanalian about them . I have lost a little money , I have gained a little experience , since we parted . And so have you , I fancy , my dear fellow . ”
11707	11716	11717	11717	Leversedge	58	“ Why ? I 've lost no money , ”
11722	11739	11717	11717	Leversedge	58	“ No , but you have lost flesh , which always implies a deepening of experience . ”
11756	11772	11752	11752	he	58	“ Why , you do n't mean to say it shows as much as that ! ”
11773	11790	11752	11752	he	58	“ I only mean to say that you are looking a good deal out of sorts . ”
11791	11799	11800	11800	He	58	“ You see too much , Hammond . ”
11811	11827	11806	11806	himself	58	“ I 'm hardly the person to accuse others of seeing too much , though . ”
11828	11833	11834	11834	I	0	“ So I feared , ”
11837	11851	11834	11834	I	0	“ I have had a hell of a time with — with that blasted dog”—Leversedge
11858	11865	11866	11866	he	58	“ Oh , it 's humiliating ! ”
11869	11942	11866	11866	he	58	“ I tell you I 'm ashamed , downright ashamed of myself . I ca n't hold my tongue — I want to talk about it . I want to tell somebody . I am as full of my own symptoms and sensations as some hysterical girl . I ca n't keep them to myself . Oh ! it 's humiliating ; I tell you it 's degrading to one 's manhood . ”
11963	11975	11976	11976	he	58	“ I do n't know what to do for the best , ”
11979	12116	12117	12117	he	443	“ I want advice — advice ; I , who have never asked advice of any living soul , but just shoved along by myself and kept my own counsel , ever since — when I was a little chap of eleven , after my mother died — my father chucked me into the rough and tumble of Harrow to sink or swim as I could . And I have swum after a fashion — that 's just why it 's so rough on one . If you 're going to smash up , upon my word I believe it 's best to do it early , before you have grown to believe in yourself . You have n't so far to fall , so it hurts less . But I beg your pardon , Hammond , ”
12125	12145	12117	12117	he	443	“ I have no earthly claim on your patience and kindness , and I must be boring you frightfully . ”
12146	12150	12151	12151	I	0	“ Boring me ? ”
12154	12176	12151	12151	I	0	“ Ye gods ! is one bored watching in the operating theatre ? Is one bored when seeing a man hanged ? ”
12188	12191	12192	12192	he	443	“ No , ”
12195	12222	12192	12192	he	443	“ There are nicer occupations ; but I grant you you are not much bored , as a rule , when a man 's being hung . ”
12274	12284	12285	12285	he	443	“ You see , the thing 's growing worse , ”
12289	12337	12285	12285	he	443	“ not merely more frequent in coming , but different ; it is developing — that 's what knocks me about so . It does n't stop where it did . The brute is materialising itself — that 's the word , is n't it?—more and more . ”—He
12357	12404	12285	12285	he	443	knees.—“When I was sitting with the Perrys the other evening , it curled itself up on my lap . And I could not play the fool before them , you know , by blaspheming at it and making a scene . I had to sit still . ”—He
12418	12506	12285	12285	he	443	steadily.—“And I tell you I felt all the shape of it — its shoulder , the crinkled turn of its ribs — it must be horribly thin — and its left fore and hind leg pressing down on me as it lay on them , as plain as I feel my fingers holding each other just now . It was all cold and damp , and — and it smelt , Hammond , and that was unspeakably filthy . You know how a mangy cur can smell . ”
12507	12512	12513	12513	I	0	“ This is bad , ”
12526	12543	12544	12544	He	58	“ I believe you . It is bad — just as bad as bad can be . ”
12551	12692	12693	12693	Leversedge	58	again.—“And the beast has taken a fancy to my bedroom , unfortunately . Last night , as soon as I put the candles out , I saw the eyes down by the side of the bed and they made a rush . I heaved a book at them which I had been reading . It was Vanity Fair . I 'm awfully fond of Vanity Fair . Poor little Becky , I always want to give her her five thousand a year to ‘ be good on . ’ Oh dear me!—Well , they wriggled down again ; the beast was knocked backwards on to the floor , you understand . But in a minute it made another rush , and came up across the counterpane , and settled itself against the pillow , those eyes staring bang into mine . ”
12830	12859	13021	13021	Leversedge	58	“ I swore at it , but it did not move . I could not bring myself to touch it , so we stayed like that some time . ”—He
12863	13009	13021	13021	Leversedge	58	again.—“At last I turned over on the other side , and it came and scratched at my back , between the shoulders , as if it was digging out a rabbit . And then — why , then I began to pray , Hammond . If there 's a devil , there must be a God somewhere too , I suppose , if it 's only to balance things ; and I thought perhaps He might happen to hear . It did leave off scratching , but it turned round and round , and snuggled into the small of my back and lay there against me like a lump of ice . It chilled me clean through . I could n't stand it , so I lighted the candles again , and walked up and down till that blessed sun arose and it was day . ”
13047	13057	13046	13046	he	58	said—“Hammond , what on earth am I to do ? ”
13058	13062	13063	13063	I	0	“ About about ? ”
13077	13086	13087	13087	he	58	“ About my engagement — about Charlotte Perry , ”
13092	13100	13101	13101	He	58	“ Ah ! That comes into it . ”
13105	13137	13166	13166	Leversedge	58	me.—“Of course that comes into it . Why , that 's the heart of it . Do you suppose I should care a twopenny - damn about it but for that ? ”
13138	13154	13155	13155	I	0	“ I am afraid I should care a very immense amount , my dear fellow , ”
13158	13165	13155	13155	I	0	“ quite entirely apart from that . ”
13171	13217	13168	13168	himself	58	“ No , you would n't , though , not if you were in my place . You see , this engagement of mine is an old story . It 's worked right into the very stuff of my life . And , it may sound queer,”—he
13220	13431	13432	13432	Leversedge	58	sadly,-“but perhaps you are never really more dependent upon a woman than when you are a few thousand miles away from her . You see , when you are knocking about in countries where there is not much public opinion to reckon with you are liable to be tempted to live a bit loosely ; and then her face comes before you at all sorts of odd times , and her letters come . And you spend hours planning what you and she will do together when the parting is over and you get back . The thought of her is the sweetness of your life , and the salt of it too — it 's what makes the work worth while . You see other women , nice women some of them,—dear women , for a lot of women are nice and dear,—and they 're good to you sometimes ; but they are n't in it , they do n't count one bit . You want her , just her and no one else ; and you 're ambitious for her , you slave and pile up money for her , you want to give her just all there is to have . And — and , in fact , ”
13440	13482	13432	13432	Leversedge	58	“ I love her , Hammond . I love her . I suppose I 'm a selfish coward , but it 's worse than death — oh ! my God , it 's unutterable misery to think of giving her up . ”
13773	13821	13768	13768	I	0	“ Has it occurred to you , my good friend , that you are treating this matter rather high - handedly , and that the young lady in question might be anything thing but grateful to you for — as you put it — giving her up ? ”
13822	13830	13768	13768	I	0	“ I only want to spare her . ”
13831	13870	13768	13768	I	0	“ Quite so . But as we may , I suppose , take for granted a degree of affection on her side , it remains an open question whether you will spare her by retiring from the situation . ”
13871	13882	13883	13883	Leversedge	58	“ Ah ! if I thought she cared like that , ”
13887	13891	13883	13883	Leversedge	58	“ Of course , ”
13895	13901	13892	13892	I	0	“ she cares like that . ”
13939	13948	13949	13949	he	58	“ And yet , I do n't know , ”
13955	14024	13949	13949	he	58	“ For the more she cares the more likely I should be to bring my curse on her . It is too hideous to contemplate . Think , Hammond , if later , if afterwards , as the reward of her faithfulness , as the payment of her great goodness in giving herself to me — she — she came to see and feel that loathsome beast herself ? ”
14054	14062	14063	14063	I	0	“ Make a clean breast of it , ”
14067	14098	14063	14063	I	0	“ Trust her — tell her . That is my advice , since you have done me the kindness to ask it . Tell her everything . Let her decide . ”
14099	14102	14103	14103	he	84	“ CONSTANTINE , ”
14106	14121	14103	14103	he	84	“ Où est il ? savez - vous où il est — Monsieur Leversedge ? ”
14284	14294	14295	14295	he	84	“ Ah ha ! I see , I see ! ”
14298	14337	14338	14338	He	84	“ The mystery touches on explanation . ‘ This is the cause , the cause , my soul . ’ Hence Constantine plays truant . When you two young gentlemen get together there is no hope of you . ”
14356	14363	14364	14364	he	84	“ We have been expecting you , ”
14367	14377	14364	14364	he	84	“ Charlotte has been visibly disturbed by your absence . ”
14378	14392	14393	14393	Leversedge	58	“ Oh , has she ? I 'm sure I am very sorry , ”
14396	14408	14393	14393	Leversedge	58	“ I understood some friends of yours were there , and — ”
14409	14412	14414	14415	Mr. Perry	84	“ Precisely , ”
14419	14496	14414	14415	Mr. Perry	84	“ That is the point . Friends of ours are here . Mr. Percy Gerrard and Mrs. Septimus Mertyns are kindly calling upon us . Most talented person , I am sure , Mrs. Mertyns,—an advantage , Constantine , as I was saying recently to Mr. Hammond , a positive advantage for one whom , like yourself , I may call a débutant in the London world , to have the entrée of her charming house . ”
14539	14550	14551	14551	he	58	“ I have not the honour of knowing Mrs. Mertyns , ”
14554	14557	14559	14560	Mr. Perry	84	“ Precisely , ”
14563	14595	14596	14596	he	58	“ That , as I remark , is the point . Charlotte perceived this was a most favourable opportunity for effecting the introduction . She is very thoughtful , very — dear girl,”—here
14602	14657	14596	14596	he	58	manner,—“very wise ; she notes , and never undervalues , a social opportunity . For which I commend her . Indifference in social matters is , rightly understood , but the mask of ignorance — Ignorance , that churlish sin , Which , seeking to cloak others , shows itselfStill basest born of all . ”
14658	14662	14664	14664	Leversedge	58	“ Dear me ! ”
14677	14789	14664	14664	Leversedge	58	“ Charlotte took for granted you would follow us up from the boat immediately . When she found you did not do so , she was disappointed , I had almost said pained ; for she recognised your mistake . Mamma , remarking her disappointment — affection lends wings to perception , Mr. Hammond — interrupting me in the midst of a most interesting conversation with Mr. Gerrard upon the deepening of the conservative sentiment among the educated artisans of our great commercial centres , whispered to me to come and tell you . And here I am;—me voilà , as I may say , Mr. Hammond , here I am . ”
14790	14817	14818	14818	I	0	“ Yes , you are very sensibly here , Mr. Perry : and it is , as always , a happiness to be in your company , ”
14858	14875	14852	14852	he	84	“ Well , Constantine , I have delivered myself of my mission . Why this delay ? ”
14876	14877	14852	14852	he	84	“ Because”—Leversedge
14880	14891	14852	14852	he	84	slowly—“I will explain why to Charlotte later , and she will understand,”—he
14892	14930	14852	14852	he	84	paused,—“yes , she 'll understand ; because I do n't , to tell the truth , feel very much inclined to go and see these people just now . I — I am not in the humour . ”
14931	14941	14943	14944	Mr. Perry	84	“ But — but — this is unheard of , ”
14946	14957	14943	14944	Mr. Perry	84	“ Not inclined,—this is incredible . Not inclined,—this is insanity . ”
14958	14970	14975	14975	his	58	“ Oh no , it is n't ; it is disinclination , ”
14989	15007	14975	14975	his	58	“ Nothing worse than disinclination . Not insanity , not just yet,—at least , I believe not . ”
15008	15016	15017	15018	Mr. Perry	84	“ I fail to grasp your meaning . ”
15022	15044	15017	15018	Mr. Perry	84	“ Oh , it 's very simple . As I say , I will explain to Charlotte ; she 'll understand . ”—Leversedge
15069	15095	15017	15018	Mr. Perry	84	asserts.—“We will leave it all in her hands . It may be better in the longrun for me not to know these people at all . ”
15128	15238	15102	15102	himself	65	“ Not to know them ? But do n't you recognise that it is absolutely incumbent upon you to know my daughter 's very cultivated and interesting circle of friends ? It is your duty , and I may add your privilege , to pay them all possible attention . What are you thinking of ? Pray , who have you to look to but them ? Who have you to push you socially ? Why , yours and my daughter 's future happiness is wholly dependent upon their attitude towards you — upon their receiving you , taking you up , and putting you through , in short . ”
15305	15326	15327	15327	he	58	“ So our happiness is dependent upon Charlotte 's friends taking us up and putting us through , is it ? ”
15331	15420	15421	15421	he	58	“ Well , I own the matter had not occurred to me in that light . I hoped our happiness drew a little more water than that . But I may be wrong , of course , Mr. Perry , and you may be right . I shall know more about it when I have explained things to Charlotte ; and if I find a strict observance of social duties will secure our happiness , you may be very certain I shall do my best to observe them.—Ah ! ”
15424	15429	15421	15421	he	58	“ here she is . ”
15541	15546	15547	15547	she	60	“ Ah , Constantine , ”
15555	15565	15547	15547	she	60	“ what cause you have given me for vexation ! ”
15575	15578	15579	15579	she	60	“ No , ”
15586	15611	15579	15579	she	60	“ repentance comes too late . They have gone . It is useless now , and I wanted you so greatly to see them . ”
15612	15635	15583	15583	her	60	“ Look here , my dearest child , I am glad they are gone , for I want greatly to see you . ”
15695	15748	15680	15680	She	60	“ Never mind your friends ; they wo n't break their hearts at not seeing me . They 'll keep . Let 's sit down on the wall over there . I 've a whole lot to tell you . I ought to have told you before , but I shirked it . ”
15749	15752	15753	15754	the girl	354	“ Constantine ! ”
15804	15813	15814	15814	I	0	“ Come , come , my dear sir , ”
15817	15839	15814	15814	I	0	“ in this delightful idyll you and I clearly have no part . Let us remove ourselves with all possible despatch . ”
15859	15874	15875	15875	he	84	“ I am amazed at the events of the last quarter of an hour , ”
15883	15967	15875	15875	he	84	“ I may go further,—I may employ the term dumfoundered . The anxieties of a parent are cruel , Mr. Hammond . The pelican strips from her breast feathers wherewith to line the nest for her young ; and then the young , in the most unexpected manner — I am sure sometimes most unexpected — get out of the nest and fly away . That is how Mamma and myself feel just now , Mr. Hammond , I assure you we do . ”
15986	15992	15993	15993	he	84	“ I am at sea , ”
15996	16012	15993	15993	he	84	“ I give you my word , Mr. Hammond , I am completely at sea . ”
16013	16017	16018	16018	I	0	“ Never fear , ”
16022	16051	16018	16018	I	0	“ if I have the honour of knowing you truly , you are one of those elect souls who are very safe to come into port at last . ”

17560	17593	17594	17595	Charlotte Perry	65	me.—“Mr . Hammond , I hesitate to interrupt you , for I have watched you and I see you are thinking . I fancy you are regretting . And so I hesitate . ”
17804	17814	17815	17815	I	0	“ Hesitate no longer , my dear young lady , ”
17819	17838	17815	17815	I	0	“ Interruptions , when they appear in so charming a form , believe me , are never unwelcome . ”

18132	18160	18073	18073	I	0	her.—“You know my parents , Mr. Hammond . You know their devotion to me ? Of course you know it , and have probably smiled at it . ”
18161	18165	18166	18166	I	0	“ Heaven forbid ! ”
18169	18215	18166	18166	I	0	“ Ah , but you have . For is it not obviously exaggerated — an affection blinding to the critical faculty ? They have no measure . No one realises more keenly than I do that their misplaced admiration makes both me and themselves absurd . ”—Miss
18227	18236	18237	18237	she	60	humility.—“They can not help it , I suppose , ”
18241	18301	18237	18237	she	60	“ But their attitude does not fail to distress and embarrass me greatly , all the same . Do not imagine that I undervalue their goodness to me . It is beautiful , but , alas ! it is impeding . I can not be quite frank with them . I can not dare to risk causing them pain . ”
18336	18343	18344	18344	she	60	“ And I am in pain , ”
18348	18386	18344	18344	she	60	“ I suffer , ah ! I suffer . I am cruelly perplexed . For I fail to see where duty — the high duty which compels acquiescence , and dignifies self - surrender — truly lies . ”
18448	18455	18456	18456	I	0	“ Leversedge has spoken to you , ”
18459	18514	18456	18456	I	0	“ Yes , that is part of the pain ; but not in the way you no doubt imagine , Mr. Hammond . If my parents knew all that he has told me , they would certainly require us to part . They would think only of me . Therefore they must not know . ”
18532	18537	18538	18538	I	0	“ That is well , ”
18539	18542	18456	18456	I	0	said,—“very well . ”
18543	18545	18546	18546	Perry	60	“ Is it?”—Miss
18562	18630	18546	18546	Perry	60	mouth.—“How little men know of women , after all ! How easily they mistake that which will attract and that which will repulse us ! I should have expected Constantine to mistake ; but you , Mr. Hammond , are different . From you I should have hoped for a more subtle judgment . Understand , this strange story of Constantine 's has no terror for me . ”
18631	18639	18640	18640	I	0	“ The gods be praised for that , ”
18643	18658	18640	18640	I	0	“ Leversedge is not born under so very unlucky a star , after all . ”
18698	18708	18709	18709	she	354	“ No , it has no terror for me , ”
18712	18789	18709	18709	she	354	“ If this curse is laid upon him , it is clearly my office to share it , to shield him , to sustain him in these dark seasons and places of his existence . And so , far from repulsing , it attracts me . It supplies the touch of mystery which was lacking . It dignifies what was otherwise commonplace . It wraps us — him and me — about with a peculiar atmosphere . ”
18864	18873	18874	18874	she	354	“ If Constantine knew how to use it , ”
18877	18944	18874	18874	she	354	“ it might be tremendous and splendid . He might make an immense success , an immense reputation . He would be received anywhere on the strength of it . Ah ! what a superb opportunity some men would find in this ! To have your legend thus ready to hand , and , if properly treated , such a legend ! You might dominate society . ”
18956	19033	18948	18948	her	354	“ But he has no idea how to use it — no more idea than a child . The opportunity will be wasted . He does not rise to it in the very least . I have tried to inspire him , tried to show him how unique and therefore precious a fate has befallen him ; but I can not develop any enthusiasm in him . I can not , can not make him see . ”
19034	19037	19038	19038	I	0	“ No , ”
19041	19070	19038	19038	I	0	“ that , I am afraid , is a point of view which will never commend itself to Leversedge . I fear you will never make him see . ”
19157	19160	19161	19161	she	60	“ Ah ! ”
19164	19193	19161	19161	she	60	“ I am very unfortunate . I have given you a wrong impression — you , Antony Hammond , the last person I would have misjudge my motives . ”
19316	19321	19322	19322	she	60	“ I know it , ”
19325	19474	19322	19322	she	60	“ and of course you know it — who better , seeing who you are and what you are ? But I can not help it . I am not well - bred — my poor , dear parents are altogether mistaken about me ; how should they , alas ! of all people , perceive just that ? I am not well - bred , and the knowledge I am not haunts me and poisons my happiness ; for I am conscious that to you , and such as you , Mr. Hammond , I must seem lacking in delicacy at times , lacking in innate refinement . I am conscious that in what I said just now I have seemed thus lacking . I misled you by my inherent inability to express myself , to put things as a high - bred woman would put them . ”
19482	19577	19322	19322	she	60	“ I seemed guilty of proposing to trade upon Constantine 's strange hallucination . I seemed oh ! it is too dreadful — like the unnatural mother who makes capital out of the deformity of her child . And I am incapable of entertaining such an idea . Surely you must feel I am incapable of it ? Indeed , you cruelly misread me . It was not of myself I was thinking , not of any advantage I could gain , but of him , of Constantine — exclusively , solely of him . ”
19608	19733	19589	19590	Miss Perry	60	“ You know — as a poet , who should know better?—that we none of us can live without our romance , without an ideal , without some secret , hidden place in which the soul finds and maintains the completeness of its individuality . We must have not only this passive support ; we must have an active one too — we must have some realm to conquer . A strange fate has overtaken Constantine . He must either sink under it or find his romance in it . I thought it conceivable he might do that last . I dreamed he might be saved , that I might save him that way — but — but you say it can not be . ”
19953	19963	19964	19964	I	0	“ Forgive me if I have spoken too plainly , ”
19967	20047	19964	19964	I	0	“ and preached you a desolatingly dull sermon . You will be within your rights if you are offended ; still , my dear young lady , if you can possibly avoid it , do n't be offended . Clemency is a great virtue , specially when extended to that vilest of bores — the giver of sound practical advice . Remember , our object is the same ; the straightening out , the reconstructing , of Constantine Leversedge . ”

20112	20135	20109	20109	she	60	“ that I could only trust you — that you would not misunderstand again , would not think me indelicate — unmaidenly . ”
20150	20156	20157	20157	she	60	“ I will trust you , ”
20161	20194	20157	20157	she	60	“ Come down into the garden . The neighbourhood of all these people in the salon paralyses me . Here I can not speak , and I must speak , I must . ”

20518	20527	20528	20528	she	60	“ The root of my suffering is this , ”
20531	20633	20528	20528	she	60	“ I am sensible of a change in myself , which makes me doubt whether the voice of supreme duty counsels self - emancipation or self - abnegation . Now that we have met again , I can not disguise from myself that I have developed , and that Constantine — you care for him , you are his friend , therefore I can say it,—that Constantine has not developed . There was a time when what he had to offer me seemed enough — wealth and all the advantages it brings with it , a very respectable social position and — ”
20634	20640	20641	20641	I	0	“ And very sincere affection , ”
20661	20671	20672	20672	she	354	“ Ah ! what will you think of me ? ”
20675	20682	20683	20683	I	0	“ That you are entirely charming , ”
20686	20696	20683	20683	I	0	“ Be serious , pray , pray be serious , ”
20769	20887	20888	20888	Her	354	“ Constantine has much , very much to give . But , but in the last year — is it faithless , is it wrong of me?—I have come to dream of a love very different from his . And I can not decide whether that is a temptation or a revelation . A love occult , profound , mysterious — a love which should be a religion , an illumination , which should realise all the richest , deepest aspirations of one 's soul . I think , from what I read , they knew this love in Italy during the Renaissance — some , a few , a very few , have known it since — ”
20897	20906	20907	20907	she	354	“ Only a few , a very few , ”
20910	20967	20907	20907	she	354	“ have known it since . Constantine could never know it ; he could not grasp the idea . And therefore I tremble lest I should do violence to the light that is in me by contracting a marriage in which this element must of necessity be absent — this hidden mutual adoration of elect hearts . ”
21033	21042	21043	21043	I	0	“ You wish to break off your engagement , ”
21046	21056	21043	21043	I	0	“ No , no — not unless , unless — ”

21307	21319	21320	21320	she	60	“ Oh ! spare me the crowning humiliation of an explanation , ”
21323	21353	21320	21320	she	60	“ It is uncalled for . It is almost unchivalrous . Can you doubt that I see my error — that , with a scathing clearness , I comprehend . ”
21354	21378	21379	21379	I	0	“ I will go — I will leave here to - night . I will leave by the first train in the morning , ”

21502	21529	21486	21486	she	60	“ indeed , you must not go . For after all you owe me something — a little , just a very little , Mr. Hammond — ”
21541	21554	21555	21555	I	0	“ It is almost intolerable to think how much I owe you , ”
21558	21566	21555	21555	I	0	“ Dispose of me as you please . ”
21577	21588	21589	21589	she	60	“ Then I lay it upon you to remain here , ”
21592	21654	21655	21655	she	60	“ You will still be my friend . Have I not bought your friendship at a rather bitter price — the price of my woman 's pride ? You will remain . You will teach me where my highest duty lies . I think perhaps you have begun to teach me that already . You will help me to save Constantine , ”
21656	21690	21691	21692	The girl	354	sighed.—“You will help me to conceal this double pain from my poor , dear , doting parents . For they must absolutely know nothing of Constantine 's strange hallucination,—they must know nothing of — ”

23383	23422	23380	23380	she	65	gently:—“Dearest , I see that you are weary . The day has been so hot . We must not let you over - tire yourself . You need rest . You must not let me keep you up . ”
23423	23435	23436	23437	Mrs. Perry	62	“ Well , it has been very hot , my dear , ”
23440	23483	23436	23437	Mrs. Perry	62	“ And the heat often does turn me a little giddy , as I think I told you , Mr. Hammond . And the music 's very nice and pretty , but you see I never can keep awake long under it . ”
23484	23488	23491	23492	Mr. Perry	84	“ A lullaby , ”
23493	23618	23491	23492	Mr. Perry	84	gaily,—“a lullaby ! Delightful compliment , I 'm sure , really delightful compliment to the soothing qualities of my daughter 's playing — And tired eyes in sweet repose , et cetera.—Line from a hymn that , I fancy . But , as I maintain whenever the subject comes up for discussion , our hymnology is not to be despised , numbering , as it does , Cowper , Addison , and the late venerable , though mistaken , Cardinal Newman among its producers . Sweet verses , I give you my word for it , most exceedingly sweet verses , I have often been constrained to recall to my wife 's memory — haven't I , Mamma?—on our return from our church services . ”
23645	23658	23659	23659	she	65	“ Listen , dearest mother , you acknowledge that you are tired , ”
23662	23679	23680	23680	she	65	“ I know our guests will excuse you . So do not attempt to sit up any longer”—here

23751	23757	23758	23758	she	62	“ But , my dear , ”
23759	23827	23862	23862	Leversedge	58	said,—“of course you know best , and I would n't interfere with your arrangements on any account , you know ; but is n't it rather odd — it is so awkward to say like this — but you know , my dear , how nervous I am at night , and if Papa goes to bed too you 'll be left alone with these three gen — ”
23876	23893	23862	23862	Leversedge	58	“ Come out here , Hammond . The lake is looking awfully pretty to - night . ”
24160	24171	24172	24172	he	58	“ It 's a glorious night , is n't it ? ”
24181	24193	24194	24194	he	58	“ I really am awfully fond of Mrs. Perry , though , ”
24197	24215	24194	24194	he	58	“ And that fellow Gerrard actually came in at the right moment for once in his life . ”
24216	24224	24225	24225	I	0	“ Are you revising your first opinion ? ”
24242	24255	24229	24229	I	0	“ Are you growing to relish the society of our celebrated Percy ? ”
24256	24279	24280	24280	Leversedge	58	“ Oh , I think him more or less of a skunk , which is exactly what I always have thought him , ”
24288	24374	24375	24375	Leversedge	58	“ And we see a lot more of him than I personally in the least care to see ; but when a man 's clear that he has the game in his own hands , he is an ass if he worries about trifles . I can put up with Mr. Percy Gerrard well enough for the next week or two . And if he fools about too much after we are married , I 'll just let him know his place by kicking him . ”
24377	24402	24375	24375	Leversedge	58	chuckled.—“I walked downstairs behind him the other day , and I 've an idea nature specially constructed him with a view to a kicking . ”
24410	24421	24422	24422	I	0	“ The course of true love runs smooth , then ? ”
24425	24431	24422	24422	I	0	“ The marriage takes place ? ”
24455	24469	24470	24470	he	58	“ Yes , the marriage takes place — takes place — takes place , ”
24595	24603	24604	24604	he	58	“ You were perfectly right , Hammond , ”
24607	24681	24604	24604	he	58	“ and I was a miserably faithless idiot of a creature . Of course the right way was to trust her . I 'm immensely grateful to you . You 've been a wonderfully good friend to us both . She told me you had had a little talk with her the other day , and , I think , if possible , she 's been sweeter to me than ever since then . ”
24693	24697	24698	24698	he	58	“ Dear God , ”
24703	24725	24698	24698	he	58	“ it 's the loveliest thing on earth to be certain at last that the woman you love really loves you . ”
24726	24734	24735	24735	I	0	“ And of that you are certain ? ”
24738	24812	24698	24698	he	58	“ Yes , have n't I had proof ? She has been tried in the fire and shown what she is made of — pure gold . I 've left off cursing the dog , Hammond — for three whole days I 've forgotten to curse him . Ah ! there 's Charlotte playing again . She does play divinely , does n't she ? Let 's come to the window and listen . ”
24981	25087	24968	24969	the girl	354	“ No , my craving for music is not yet satisfied , far from it . But before I ask you to steep my jaded senses once more in this purifying ocean of sound , I must implore that the room may be darkened somewhat . You have done your best to mitigate the glaring abominations of colour and form in this terrible hotel salon , I am sure , Miss Perry ; but yet much , much of necessity remains which causes anguish to a cultivated eye . And the garish light of these candles and lamps brings all unlovely details into fullest relief . ”
25088	25099	25100	25100	Leversedge	58	“ Really I did n't think the room half bad , ”
25106	25225	25100	25100	Leversedge	58	“ May we not have some of them extinguished , Miss Perry?—thus letting the stars , there , through the open window , the fragrance of the garden borne upon the night wind , and the perilous rapture of Chopin — think of the Majorcan episode , that exquisite exile à deux , the eternal sough of the breeze in the pine trees , and George Sand ( the woman of the sphinx - like and unfathomable eyes ) sitting by drinking in the insatiable passion of the master 's music,—let these , I say , even here , amid the bare commonplaces of a modern hotel , for one beneficent hour have it all their own way . ”
25226	25236	25237	25238	the girl	354	“ Ah ! I love the half light too , ”
25241	25278	25237	25238	the girl	354	“ It is sympathetic . Partially to conceal is to suggest , is n't it ? And to suggest is often really to reveal the deeper , the everlasting meaning , do n't you think so ? ”
25283	25293	25294	25294	she	354	“ Yes — yes — let us extinguish them , ”
25309	25314	25308	25308	she	354	added,—“Ah ! I forgot . ”
25360	25371	25372	25372	she	65	“ But if you in the least mind , Constantine ? ”
25415	25425	25426	25426	he	58	“ My dearest child , do whatever you like , ”
25437	25451	25426	25426	he	58	“ Thanks to you , I am growing royally indifferent to the dark . ”
25491	25500	25501	25501	he	58	“ Go and play , go and play , ”
25505	25543	25501	25501	he	58	“ Go , or I shall make a fool of myself . Go — I'll put out your candles and things — put out the sun itself in heaven , I believe if you asked me to . ”
25608	25626	25627	25627	he	58	“ Thanks , thanks , that is better . You are really very amiable , Mr. Leversedge , ”
25636	25665	25627	25627	he	58	“ Nothing now , I trust , will mar the sentiment — a sentiment at once so chaste and so voluptuous — of these god - given nocturnes . ”
26262	26265	26266	26266	he	75	“ Thanks , ”
26269	26339	26266	26266	he	75	“ you have surpassed yourself . I fancy that unconsciously you have done more . We were speaking of self - revelation just now . Surely , in your rendering of that delicious thing , you permitted yourself to draw away a veil from your own soul , and , for those who have ears to hear and eyes to see , in a measure revealed your deepest self ! ”
26344	26362	26363	26363	he	75	“ The spiritual element in that nocturne is definite , it speaks directly to my religious instinct , ”
26366	26411	26363	26363	he	75	“ But the spiritual element is not the only one , for the sentiment as a whole is marvellously complex . That is what renders it so profoundly interesting . The religious emotion in its simple expression is always joyous , is n't it ? ”
26412	26417	26418	26419	the girl	354	“ I think so , ”
26423	26431	26432	26432	Gerrard	75	“ I am sure that it is , ”
26435	26464	26432	26432	Gerrard	75	“ Recalling the hours when I have been most deeply conscious of the magnetism of the Divine Idea , I recognise that they were hours of unalloyed joyousness . ”
26522	26574	26580	26580	she	729	“ But here , notwithstanding the presence of true spirituality , I find little gladness . I am aware , indeed , throughout of a tremor of intense and vital melancholy . You were aware of that also , Miss Perry ; and you intended to convey it to your hearer ? ”
26575	26579	26580	26580	she	729	“ Ah yes ! ”
26591	26596	26598	26598	Gerrard	75	“ I knew it ! ”
26600	26663	26598	26598	Gerrard	75	“ Your dramatic instinct , of course , is strong , since you possess in so remarkable a degree the artistic temperament . But , knowing you as well as I am learning to know you , I can rapidly detect where you draw upon the comparative shallows of the dramatic instinct , and where upon the deeps of living personal experience . ”
26664	26670	26675	26675	his	119	“ The deuce you can ! ”
26678	26696	26672	26672	Leversedge	119	“ May I try , will you grant me permission to try , to construe your thought ? ”
26781	26864	26878	26878	his	75	“ To me it seems you found in that nocturne , and gave in your rendering of it , the melancholy , not of a rejected soul — far from that — but rather of one who , after long struggle , has sacrificed the consummation of terrestrial happiness in obedience to the compelling dominion of some moral idea ; and who , looking back , momentarily gauges the immensity , I had almost said , the enormity of such a sacrifice . ”—He
26880	26961	26878	26878	his	75	voice.—“Yes , your reading was richly subtle , richly pathetic . I too can figure that broken melody , those searching harmonies , which seem to vibrate through the secret places of one 's most innermost being , as the utterance of some exquisite woman , artist by nature , saint through the constraining power of adverse circumstance , as she realises for some brief but hideous instants the eternal anguish , the glory of her own self - dedication . ”

And marriage is a serious step ; it is , I think I may even say , an arduous undertaking — for some of us , I am sure , very arduous . To leave home and kindred , to quit the dear old family roof”—(at
30247	30272	30273	30273	I	0	pots?),—“must of necessity cause a pang,—aye , more than one — quite a number of pangs in fact , to any highly sensitive heart . ”

30305	30423	30302	30302	he	84	“ But I can not disguise from myself that my daughter appears depressed . These delicate young creatures are so full of feeling — Fair English girl , whose mantling cheekForbids the words her lips would speak . Yes , yes — so I invited her to come out with me . And Mamma approved the plan , I am happy to state,—entirely approved it . The aspect of outward nature upon this truly glorious summer afternoon would , I felt convinced , prove an antidote to gloomy thoughts . And hence you find us here , Mr. Hammond,—hence you find us ; and very happy indeed we are to be found , I can assure you . ”
30556	30562	30563	30563	he	84	“ I am myself aware , ”
30566	30659	30661	30662	Mr. Perry	84	“ how when harassed by the calls of business and by those anxieties which the fluctuations of the money market necessarily produce in the breast even of the most sanguine and the most solvent,—I am aware how a few hours , spent in one of the sequestered country spots , of which our dear sea - girt land supplies so many charming examples , will restore a measure of energy to the jaded nervous system , and promote a healthy , hopeful outlook upon our present form of existence . For though , ”

30736	30769	30771	30772	Mr. Perry	84	“ I envy the agile chamois leaping from rock to rock with dilated nostril . I long to inhale the invigorating atmosphere of those amazing altitudes . And the ocean , again , ”
30774	30813	30771	30772	Mr. Perry	84	“ the sound of it is , as I may say , positively in my blood . Often in my boyhood — Dear bygone time when youth 's enchanted handSmoothed the light curl , caressed the candid brow — ”

Poetry , my dear Mr. Hammond , believe me , in the end we must all come back to that,—and a very wholesome thing it is to come back to , I 'm sure , very wholesome . ”
30996	31004	31006	31007	Mr. Perry	84	“ Mamma , now , is different , ”
31009	31098	31099	31099	he	84	“ Travel for her has few attractions . A home - loving nature , the fireside , the bright flower border , the prolific vegetable garden,—these content the heart of Mamma , as does the round of her domestic duties.—‘A wet sheet and a flowing sail’—fine old song that , Mr. Hammond , and full of the true British nautical spirit — exercise no fascination over her . And so we left her at the hotel this afternoon ; we did not bring her with us . Indeed , ”
31106	31230	31099	31099	he	84	“ I may tell you , in confidence , Mr. Hammond,—you , are a man of the world , which is equivalent to saying that you know something of the feminine nature,—I was not altogether sorry to part my two ladies for a little while to - day , not altogether sorry to part them . A passing cloud , no more,—I am sure quite passing,—crossed the face , as I may say , of our family happiness . Just a momentary lack of unanimity of sentiment between the child and her maternal parent . Mamma had heard rumours — the confused indiscretion of an officious chambermaid — the sex will gossip , as you know — of something that happened last night . ”
31238	31242	31243	31243	I	0	“ Last night?—Indeed ? ”

31268	31279	31265	31265	I	0	“ You were there , I believe , Mr. Hammond . ”
31280	31309	31334	31335	Mr. Perry	84	“ Certainly , I was there all the time . Your daughter played to us as — well , as I really think only your daughter can play . ”
31398	31405	31406	31406	he	84	“ You relieve me of anxiety , ”
31407	31460	31406	31406	he	84	said,—“greatly relieve me . Mrs. Perry is slightly wanting in diplomacy at times ; and she has , perhaps , views of the duties of a chaperon belonging to less advanced and cultivated social conditions than those in which it is the habit of our daughter to move . She questioned Charlotte . ”
31470	31474	31475	31475	he	84	“ A mistake , ”

And — ah ! here is our good friend the doctor . Botanising I see , as usual . No naughty poppies , I trust , annoying your eye in those delightful Alpine solitudes — ah ! ha — eh , no naughty poppies ? ”

32135	32170	32132	32133	Miss Perry	60	“ On the contrary , I am hopeful because I am in a normal condition , and am therefore qualified to judge of the probabilities of things . You are somewhat over - tired . ”

Well , I almost feared as much,—and then let me do my poor best to entertain you . Let me talk to you about the weather ; about our compagnons de voyage , whose voices reverberate so pleasingly under that truly beautiful tin awning ; about our friend Clement Bartlett 's new play , of which Carr writes me word that it is to be a brilliant success.—Picture that ! The foolish things of this world do indeed confound the wise at times ! Your memory happily can not carry you back to that prehistoric period , but I well remember Clement 's first appearance . Like the man in ‘ The Egoist , ’ he ‘ had a leg , ’ but this appeared to me to constitute the whole of his dramatic outfit . And now we are called upon to hail him as the coming play - wright ! ”

32387	32447	32381	32382	Charlotte Perry	65	“ Poor dear Bartlett has survived so many smiles that one more will not greatly affect him — specially as he will remain serenely unaware of it . Moreover , I am past the appeals of friendship at this moment ; I would ruthlessly offer up the reputation of my nearest and dearest to afford you a little amusement . ”
32480	32501	32502	32502	I	0	“ Pray , pray do n't , my dear Miss Perry , this is too distressing ; pray control yourself , ”

32602	32661	32599	32599	she	354	“ I knew it would be very painful — I could not speak at first — but I thought that the opportunity had been given me , and that I should gain strength , and tell you ; and that you would approve for once — just for once - and that would be my compensation — but — ”

Constantine was in a terrible condition . Upon his frenzy — which you witnessed — there followed an alarming prostration . In one and the same breath he told me — is it indelicate to tell you this?—that he should die without me , and implored me to break with him . He said it was wicked to marry me , and yet declared that without me he would die . Indeed , I feared he would destroy himself . ”

Even the most reasonable mind must be affected by constant contact with unreason . At last I may — I shall — be infected by the terror which haunts my husband . To me , also , it will take on bodily form , and then Constantine will kill — kill — either me or himself . ”

No — don't protest ; you told me you would listen . Keep your promise , that is only just . Listen — I perceive only one way to gain your respect , perhaps your admiration . It is a bitter way — flesh and blood can hardly endure it — yet I take it . Constantine is your friend , not I. I am interesting to you , have been so from the first , merely on account of the relation in which I stand to him . ”

You question my sincerity . You cheapen my talents — in your own mind — I do not say you do all this openly , you are too gentleman - like to fall into that error . But being idle , you amuse your leisure by casting me up and dividing me out . For Constantine you really care , so you do not sacrifice him to your rage for analysis ; I understand that.—No — do not interrupt me . I must say it all , all this once . You think me worldly , scheming , a mere actress . By marrying Constantine , by yielding myself up unreservedly to the horror which encircles him , I can vindicate myself ; I can prove to you that you have misjudged me , and that I am very far from being the cheap , artificial , half - hearted adventuress you have supposed me to be . ”

You are — pardon my saying so — straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel with a vengeance . Bear with me if I speak plainly.—Marry Constantine Leversedge because he loves you , if you wish to do an heroic act of kindness . Still better , marry him because you love him , and pity carries the day over fear . ”
34971	34979	34981	34982	Miss Perry	60	“ Ah ! how little you understand , ”
35048	35104	35043	35043	I	0	“ But to marry him as proof to me that you are not the kind of person you imagine I imagine you possibly may be , is absurd and grotesque , an unspeakable and impossible folly . You can not be guilty of it . I refuse to permit you to be guilty of it . ”
35105	35117	35118	35120	the fair Charlotte	871	“ And how will you prevent my being guilty of it ? ”
35178	35239	35240	35240	She	60	“ Tell my poor dear parents what you have just told me . At first they will neither believe nor understand you . You will involve yourself in a series of silly wordy scenes , which will make our party the comedy of the whole hotel . Tell Constantine — that will be very simple — he will destroy himself . ”
35243	35277	35240	35240	She	60	“ And , meanwhile , you will have the inward satisfaction of continuing to think of me just what you have always thought . I do not propose to give you that satisfaction . ”
35278	35285	35286	35286	I	0	“ Are you not slightly vindictive ? ”
35289	35317	35286	35286	I	0	“ It was not nice of me . It was a lapse of good manners . But , upon my honour , I could not help it . ”
35380	35386	35387	35387	she	60	“ You are certainly ungenerous , ”
35390	35471	35387	35387	she	60	“ But all men are that , I believe , if an unhappy woman so far forgets conventionality as to obey the dictates of — No , pass that by . Forget what I was nearly betrayed into saying . I should be thankful to forget it myself . Let us reason together coldly and sensibly , since that is your pleasure ; and I will show you why you can not and must not seek to alter my resolution . ”
35489	35729	35481	35481	she	60	“ You know how hard society is , how basely commonplace in its judgments , how blind to high purposes , how sceptical of pure and elevated motives . You know how it hates to have its imagination taxed by action that is touched by ideality . You are a poet , you must have suffered from all this at times , and so you must have seen how , if a woman — it is very painful to me to speak on this subject — if a woman leaves her home because the demands made upon her are degrading , or because her husband is wicked , or because , like the heroine of Ibsen 's wonderful drama , she revolts against the narrow conditions and paltry occupations of domestic life , society looks doubtfully upon her , other women flout her and draw aside their skirts . Even should she give herself to philanthropy or enter a religious house , she is still suspect . But if she leaves her home because she pleases some other man , society looks not so very hardly on her fault ; often , in a little while , quite condones it . In the eyes of the great , coarse , everyday world we are your slaves yet . Success with a man , that a man should desire us , in a measure justifies even the most scandalous conduct . ”
35792	35805	35806	35806	she	60	“ It is very much the same with a girl 's engagement , ”
35810	35954	35806	35806	she	60	“ If she cancels it because she discovers that she and the man whom she has promised to marry are not calculated to realise what marriage might be — has sometimes been — in all its exquisite completeness , in its profound though hidden poetry ; if she dreads to do violence to her own ideal of love , she is accused of cruelty and caprice . Women treat her with a mixture of pity and contempt . Men are familiar or surly with her . She is a failure , and society has no mercy for failure . But if she breaks it off because someone else cares for her , in obedience to his will , she is justified in the opinion of the world , of her friends , of her parents — in that even of her rejected admirer . ”
36083	36137	36138	36139	The girl	354	“ She is a success . Society smiles on her , fêtes and applauds her . For has she not upon her the hall - mark which all will acknowledge ? It is well to be loved by one man . It is just doubly well to be loved by two . And — ”
36185	36210	36177	36177	I	0	“ And she is very , very grateful , Mr. Hammond . Her happiness is secured . It is completed instead of being wrecked . ”
36265	36269	36261	36262	Perry père	60	“ an arduous undertaking ”
38002	38004	38009	38010	Miss Perry	60	“ facial expression”—flickered
38039	38049	38050	38050	she	60	“ Please give me my parasol , Mr. Hammond , ”
38057	38064	38050	38050	she	60	“ The sun is very hot . ”
38325	38338	38339	38340	Charlotte Perry	65	“ The civil marriage will take place on Thursday , at Geneva , ”
38346	38398	38339	38340	Charlotte Perry	65	“ Constantine has gone there to - day to see the Consul and make all necessary arrangements . He has been resident in the district for a sufficient length of time , there will be no difficulty or — or delay . The religious ceremony will take place here on Friday . ”
38408	38414	38415	38415	she	354	“ You will be present ? ”
38419	38426	38427	38427	I	0	“ Unfortunately I can not be , ”
38430	38452	38415	38415	she	354	“ I leave by the mail to - night . I shall be in Paris , on my way to England . ”
38453	38458	38459	38460	Miss Perry	60	“ No , no ! ”
38505	38513	38514	38514	she	354	“ You shall not escape so easily , ”
38517	38548	38514	38514	she	354	“ I have borne much from you , but I refuse to bear that . You shall not slip away comfortably and amuse yourself — perhaps with some other friend — friend?”—her
38556	38694	38514	38514	she	354	sarcasm—“elsewhere , while you leave me to lift the great burden which you — yes , you — have helped to force upon me , unaided and alone . I have a claim on you — we need not discuss the exact nature of it , since you , I think , hardly dare deny its existence — and I require you to meet that claim to the full . This is not revenge , this is justice — bare justice . You shall be witness of this business to the very end . You shall see what I do , hear what I say — I will leave you no loophole for disbelief , for doubt . You shall recognise my worth — you shall admire my conduct — I will compel you to admire it . ”
38723	38729	38730	38730	I	0	“ I admire you already , ”
38733	38742	38730	38730	I	0	“ You are extraordinary , you are enchanting . ”
38757	38760	38761	38761	she	65	“ Ah ! ”
38764	38807	38761	38761	she	65	“ I have wrung that out of you at last — no , pray say no more . Do not spoil your admission either by exaggeration or by explanation . Leave it as it stands . Submit to be spontaneous for once ! ”
38822	38958	38809	38809	Her	65	“ You will remain , Mr. Hammond , and take part in the — the sad — for some of us it must be sad — ceremony of Friday . Constantine will ask you to be his best man , and you will accept . Meanwhile you will help me — I think you will ? This is Tuesday , so after all the time is short — you will help me to prevent my poor dear parents arriving at any premature knowledge of the truth . They must think that I — am happy — that — that I am glad . And I fear they are growing suspicious . To - day Mamma — but I will not trouble you with all that . You must help me lull their fears to rest . ”
38971	38977	38978	38978	she	60	“ I am very tired , ”
38981	38987	38988	38988	She	60	“ We have talked enough . ”
39945	39953	39954	39954	she	62	“ Dear me now , Mr. Hammond , ”
39957	40090	39954	39954	she	62	“ this is what I really do call a piece of luck . I have been so wishing all the morning I had some lady - friend to talk it all over with ; and you see I have nothing but acquaintances here , and I never can get over the feeling it is n't very suitable to be intimate with the people you just meet travelling . You see , you do n't really know anything about them , nor how they live , and how many servants they keep , and how they behave at home . It 's so easy for anybody to look respectable on the Continent . And you 're so afraid , if you take to them , it may make awkwardnesses afterwards , aren't you ? ”
40238	40253	40254	40254	she	62	“ You have always taken such a kind interest in our dear young people , ”
40257	40273	40254	40254	she	62	“ that I know you will be pleased to hear everything is so comfortably settled . ”
40565	40589	40557	40557	I	0	“ I am delighted to hear it . I am to understand you , then , that they are both doing very well ? ”
40590	40596	40597	40598	Mrs. Perry	62	“ Oh , very well , ”
40603	40635	40597	40598	Mrs. Perry	62	“ Indeed , Mr. Hammond , between ourselves , I think Charlotte 's a very fortunate girl , for Constantine Leversedge has really being doing better than could have been expected . ”
40651	40658	40659	40659	I	0	“ Good news upon good news ! ”
40662	40667	40659	40659	I	0	“ This is capital . ”
40668	40688	40689	40689	Her	62	“ So it is ; and I am sure I feel very thankful , and so does Mr. Perry . ”
40695	40732	40689	40689	Her	62	“ For , of course , we 've had our misgivings at times , Mr. Hammond . You see , we lost our dear little boy as an infant . So she 's our only child . ”
40750	40893	40744	40745	Mrs. Perry	62	“ And being so remarkable and gifted as she is , we have sometimes wondered whether we ought to let things go on . Often and often , since we 've been here , Mr. Perry 's woke me in the night to talk about it — specially since Mrs. Mertyns came , and we could n't help seeing what an interest Mr. Gerrard took in Lottie . Mr. Perry 's a dreadfully poor sleeper when he has anything on his mind . I am sure if I 've asked him once , I 've asked him a dozen times,—‘My dear , what does make you so restless ? ’ And he always answers,—‘Charlotte 's marriage , Mamma , Charlotte 's marriage . It 's not too late yet to interfere . She must not be permitted to throw herself away . ’ ”
40894	40906	40907	40907	I	0	“ A most proper sentiment on the part of your husband , ”
40910	41014	40907	40907	I	0	“ I am so pleased to know you think that , for sometimes I have been afraid Mr. Perry was inclined to place his hopes too high , and that it would n't bring a blessing . You see , there 's a great deal said about not taking too much thought in the Bible , and — I daresay it is because I do n't understand very quickly — these new translations do explain a great many of those difficulties in the Gospels , they tell me — but sometimes I was frightened lest we should be asking too much for Lottie . ”
41081	41085	41086	41086	she	62	“ Dear me ! ”
41089	41184	41185	41185	she	62	“ how pleasant it is to have a little chat ! Though I do n't know that I ought to be so confidential with you , Mr. Hammond . Only , as I say , you 've always taken such a warm interest in our young people that I ca n't help feeling as if you were quite one of ourselves now . And then I always do think you can say things to a bachelor like you , you could n't say to another gentleman . And you 're older , you see , ”
41198	41239	41185	41185	she	62	“ I 'm sure I do n't know how I should have felt about leaving Charlotte alone the other night — particularly after what they told me afterwards — if I had not known you were there , Mr. Hammond . ”
41421	41427	41429	41429	she	62	“ WELL , you see , ”
41431	41514	41429	41429	she	62	“ what Mr. Perry felt was that Charlotte 's marriage did not explain itself . I should have thought if the young people loved each other that was explanation enough . I am sure when Mr. Perry and I were engaged , our friends took for granted that was explanation enough , and so did dear father and mother too . But things move on so fast nowadays , Mr. Hammond , I 'm sure I never quite know where I am — ”
41519	41542	41543	41543	I	0	“ You are not alone . The pace is hot , and the Time - Spirit leaves many of us somewhat breathless , ”
41599	41606	41607	41607	she	62	“ Yes , to be sure , ”
41610	41658	41607	41607	she	62	“ and Mr. Perry has kept on saying to me , ‘ We owe it to ourselves , Susan , and we owe it to Charlotte 's very charming and cultivated circle of acquaintance , to show a really solid reason , to show sufficient cause — ’ ”
41669	41726	41607	41607	she	62	“ For Mr. Perry always pointed out — though I never could quite understand why being clever should make so much difference — that in the case of such a talented girl as Charlotte , her friends would n't recognise affection as very much of a reason . It seems a pity , does n't it ? ”
41727	41736	41737	41737	I	0	“ So it does . Ten thousand pities , ”
41748	41851	41742	41744	The good woman	971	“ Dear me , with all your nice feelings — if it is n't too intimate to mention it — it does seem a loss you ai n't married , Mr. Hammond . There must be plenty of young ladies who would be so very willing , you know — indeed , I 've more than once thought — if it had n't been decided long ago — Mr. Perry and I — for there 's no one I 've seen for a long while I 've taken so to — but then it is all decided , you see — and — ”
41899	41905	41906	41906	I	0	“ It is all decided , ”
41909	41918	41906	41906	I	0	“ And so , as to these settlements ? ”
41919	42017	42047	42047	she	973	“ Ah yes,—I'm sure I shall always remember you as a very kind friend after to - day , Mr. Hammond . Well , when he 'd seen the will , Mr. Perry said to me directly — and I was rather nervous Constantine overheard , but then he 's very sensible , I do n't think he 's at all sensitive like some young men might be,—he said to me , ‘ It all lies here , Mamma , it all lies here ! Everyone will admit this really fine income explains Charlotte 's choice . ’ ”
42018	42031	42032	42032	I	0	“ Unquestionably wealth explains much to the mind of the modern world , ”
42035	42046	42047	42047	she	973	“ I am very pleased you agree with Mr. Perry , ”
42054	42097	42047	42047	she	973	“ I 'll tell him you think Charlotte 's friends will be satisfied ; and I ca n't help hoping that may make him less excited than he has been lately . He is so very tenacious about her friends being satisfied . ”
42297	42304	42305	42305	I	0	“ And they really are handsome ? ”
42308	42315	42316	42316	she	62	“ They seem so to me , ”
42319	42448	42316	42316	she	62	“ But then , Mr. Perry and I had n't much to begin on at first , Mr. Hammond . We were in a very small way . He used to repeat beautiful lines about love in a cottage , which afforded the greatest pleasure to dear mother and father . I 'm sure I can hear her kiss me now , upon my wedding - morning , just when she had done lacing my dress — it was very becoming to the figure , but a very inconvenient fashion , those day - dresses lacing up behind — and say to me,—‘Thank God , Susie , you will have that in your husband which is better than riches , for Joseph has a truly good heart . ’ ”
42602	42612	42588	42589	That man	988	“ it takes all sorts to make a world . ”
42613	42624	42625	42627	my innocent companion	989	“ But of course I was very different to Charlotte , ”
42630	42643	42644	42644	She	981	“ I had not her requirements . I did n't mind makeshifts — ”
42650	42793	42644	42644	She	981	“ Between ourselves , I do n't mind them much now . They make me feel easy . But they do n't make Charlotte easy ; they seem to mortify her , and she points things out to me — her standard of taste is very high . And I should be the last person to undervalue that , still sometimes I do find it a little tiring . You see , you never do quite get over the way you were brought up , Mr. Hammond . And I do seem to have so many things to remember , people never troubled about when I was young , that when I have got hold of one I am pretty sure to forget some other ; and , of course , I know that must be mortifying to Charlotte and her father . ”
42794	42810	42811	42811	I	0	“ Alas ! we must all pay the penalties of progress , my dear lady , ”
42821	42825	42811	42811	I	0	“ I suppose we must”—Mrs
42830	42894	42827	42827	Perry	65	“ Still , it 's a very troubling thing to feel what you do is a subject of mortification to others . Sometimes it makes me dreadfully low - spirited . I do try to feel it 's just the cross that is laid upon me , Mr. Hammond ; and to count the many undeserved blessings I have to set against it . ”
42899	42906	42907	42907	I	0	“ I am sure you do , ”
42916	42952	42907	42907	I	0	“ And among the blessings we are evidently to count these same settlements . Tell me about them , if it is not indiscreet to do so . I am profoundly curious in the matter . ”
42953	43156	42907	42907	I	0	“ Well , yes , I 'm sure you are ; and I do n't think it is indiscreet with you — at least , if it is , I believe I can trust you not to mention it , because I think you are one of those who really do like to give pleasure , and naturally you see it 's a great pleasure to me to have a little chat over it all . And , you know , I would n't say a single word for anything , but I had been told something , and , the consequence was , dear Charlotte and I did fall out a little yesterday . Mr. Perry took her away on the lake afterwards . I daresay he acted all for the best , but I felt rather hurt , you know . I daresay I had been over anxious . But she keeps it up — Charlotte does keep things up a little sometimes . She 's been distant with me this morning even , so that I have n't been able to have a nice comfortable gossip with her over it all as it would seem suitable I should have . ”
43157	43168	43169	43169	I	0	“ All that will come later , dear Mrs. Perry , ”
43172	43209	43169	43169	I	0	“ Just now your daughter is of necessity slightly self - absorbed , slightly distraite . Surely you can recall a kindred state of mind under kindred circumstances — on the eve of your own marriage ? ”
43210	43298	42907	42907	I	0	“ I 'm sure I do n't know . I am afraid I cried a great deal at leaving mother — though I would n't have given up Joseph — Mr. Perry , I mean — on any account . Charlotte does n't ever cry — she never has been given to crying since she was a child , you know . And I suppose I ought n't to want her to . But then Charlotte and I are very different . My tears always came easily . ”
43299	43310	43311	43311	I	0	“ Self - control is the order of the day , ”
43314	43328	43311	43311	I	0	“ And as to these settlements , if you will pardon my importunity ? ”
43329	43337	43338	43339	Mrs. Perry	62	“ I am afraid I do wander , ”
43343	43505	43338	43339	Mrs. Perry	62	“ They often tell me so . But , you see , I have had so much on my mind , and Mr. Perry has been very excitable,—really at times — let me see , he gives her — I mean Constantine does — a thousand a year for her separate use ; that does seem to me very handsome . I 'm sure I do n't know what she can find to spend it on . I said to her she ought to put away more than half against a rainy day . But Constantine laughed — he has a very free , pleasant laugh has Constantine . But I do n't feel quite easy about him . He looks very pulled and worn to me . I should n't like to think he 'd anything on his mind , Mr. Hammond ; but in those foreign places young men do lead very wild lives sometimes , I 'm afraid . ”
43506	43523	43524	43524	I	0	“ Take my word for it , Leversedge is a jewel of gold , Mrs. Perry , ”
43528	43723	43524	43524	I	0	“ Well , I am sure I have often wished to ask you , only it did n't seem a proper thing to do . But just now it popped out before I could help it . And , of course , one does hear very sad stories now and then . But I suppose it 's just his health then , the change , coming away from those very hot climates and everything . I think he wants care , and I am sure I should be very pleased to give it him . I often wish to make him nice little things to take , and look after his linen . If there 's anything that goes to my heart it 's that a young man should have to sew on his own tapes and buttons . But I am always afraid he might resent anything like that as a liberty . Of course , there 's so much a person of my age can do for a gentleman that would n't be suitable from a younger person . Perhaps when Charlotte 's married I may seem to get nearer to him . ”
43741	43755	43756	43756	she	62	“ It was a dreadful thing to lose our baby , Mr. Hammond , ”
43759	43856	43756	43756	she	62	“ I always wished for a son , and though I did pray to be kept from being rebellious , I am afraid I have been envious of other women when I saw them with nice little boys of their own . His dying seemed to leave me with a sort of emptiness ; and I have felt lately as if Constantine — or any husband Charlotte had , because , of course , she might have married otherwise — might come to fill it , if I could only get near him , you know . ”
44038	44085	44031	44033	good Mrs. Perry	62	“ — in case of his death — and I know it 's wicked , Mr. Hammond , but I do so dislike death;—‘I leave to my wife Charlotte , absolutely , all I die possessed of , ’ it said,—I mean , the will said . ”
44086	44093	44094	44094	I	0	“ Yes ! that is liberal , ”
44130	44135	44136	44137	Mrs. Perry	62	“ So it is , ”
44140	44300	44301	44301	I	0	“ I really do n't see how it could be more so . And there seems to be a great deal to leave in stocks and shares , and railways and land and mines , and so on . I did n't attempt to tot it up , for I felt a little overcome , you know ; but Mr. Perry ran through it all in no time — Joseph always has been very noted for rapid calculation — and , of course , I know his face so well , after all these years , I could tell in an instant . Too , he did say to me , ‘ princely , positively princely , ’ under his breath , so I knew it must be something quite above the average , and that we all had reason to be very thankful . Still , I do wish nothing had been said about death , Mr. Hammond . ”
44336	44342	44343	44344	Mrs. Perry	62	“ I suppose it has , ”
44347	44484	44343	44344	Mrs. Perry	62	“ All the same , it does seem a very shocking thing for a young man like Constantine to be occupied about just when he 's going to be married . Of course , it was very foolish , but it gave me a dreadful turn . It seemed somehow to bring back these last days when we lost our dear little boy ; I am sure I do n't know why , for Constantine is a grown man , and he was an infant . But I seemed to feel as if poor Charlotte was a widow before she was a wife , for the minute , if it is n't too familiar to say so , and that 's enough to give anybody a turn , Mr Hammond , do n't you think so ? ”
44558	44566	44584	44584	Perry	62	“ Mamma!—where is Mrs. Perry ? Mamma ! ”
44657	44687	44641	44641	he	1006	“ Pardon , mademoiselle , pray excuse me — mais avez vous vu Madame Perry ? Savez vous où elle est , où est , enfin , ma femme ? ”
44749	44756	44757	44757	she	484	“ Mais la voilà , monsieur , ”
44760	44768	44757	44757	she	484	“ La voilà avèc monsieur son ámi . ”
44769	44777	44779	44780	Mr. Perry	84	“ Ah ! ha ! I see , "
44783	44790	44779	44780	Mr. Perry	84	“ Mille fois merci , mademoiselle . ”
44810	44814	44815	44815	he	1006	“ I see , ”

45060	45156	45157	45157	he	84	“ She could not keep it to herself — The brimming pitcher sure will overflow , And spill the ruby liquor on the thirsty soil below . Well , well , I own there are excuses for a tendency to garrulity on the part of some of us this morning ! A difficult chapter in our family annals is happily concluded ; a period of anxiety is past ; a shadow is , as one may say , lifted from our parental hearts . But I trust , my love , you have not exaggerated ? ”
45167	45189	45157	45157	he	84	“ I would not have a false impression created . We must not make too much of it , Mr. Hammond . ”
45190	45207	45208	45208	I	0	“ Indeed , there appears to be a most agreeably heavy amount to make much of , ”

45220	45405	45407	45408	Mr. Perry	84	airily,—“an elegant competence . Our daughter will be in a position to gratify her literary and artistic tastes , to entertain her circle of friends in becoming style , and take that place in London society for which , as I at once proudly and gratefully asseverate , her talents so eminently fit her . This is the reward of my fostering care . I recognise it . Yes , yes , I own to - day you see in me a happy father , and a very nice thing that is to see , I 'm sure . But now to business — my love , I am on my way to the boat . I mentioned to Charlotte , and she agreed with me , that after the flattering sympathy — really most flattering to all of us as a family — which she has exhibited , it was only due to Mrs. Mertyns that she should be early acquainted with the rosy hue which now , as I may say , flushes our daughter 's future . There have been moments , ”
45416	45480	45208	45208	I	0	me,—“as our charming friend Mrs. Mertyns well knows — only yesterday — but let that pass . I will not dwell on fears once entertained . Hope has now taken their place.—Yes , Mr. Hammond , our dear children will enjoy a very pretty little fortune — Gold , much red gold , shall grace these nuptialsAnd cement the basis of domestic joys . ”
45481	45493	45494	45495	Mrs. Perry	62	“ Well , I am very willing Mrs. Mertyns should know , ”
45498	45527	45494	45495	Mrs. Perry	62	“ I thought of writing home myself to my cousins , and dear Aunt Trumbull at Brixton . They 've always been very true to me , and — ”
45528	45561	45568	45568	his	1018	“ Quite so , quite so , my dear — and therefore Charlotte has penned a brief note , and has commissioned me to be the bearer of it . I have it here”—he
45571	45667	45568	45568	his	1018	“ Yes , Mr. Hammond , without seeking to obtrude myself , I may just hint that practical experience has given me a not contemptible knowledge of such matters , and I have much pleasure in testifying to the excellent business capacity of our future son - in - law . Leversedge has done well , remarkably well , considering his age and opportunities . I could wish he had displayed less reticence regarding the amount of his income . Clear information under that head would have spared us many anxious hours,—wouldn't it , Mamma ? ”
45668	45674	45675	45675	I	0	“ Leversedge is admirably modest , ”
45707	45711	45712	45712	he	1018	“ Most true , ”
45715	45803	45712	45712	he	1018	“ I yield to no one in my appreciation of our dear boy Constantine — Mamma will bear me out in that . But , as one of our greatest poets observes , — Let not your modesty outrun discretionLest , falling from fair favour to contempt , You mask a greater by a lesser good . And there has been a touch of secretiveness , a hint , perhaps,—though far be it from me to be harsh,—of that pride which apes humility in Constantine 's attitude . ”
45804	45818	45820	45821	Mrs. Perry	62	“ To be sure , I never thought of him as proud now , ”
45823	45860	45820	45821	Mrs. Perry	62	“ Ah ! ah ! my love , public life , the rub of the world — eh , Mr. Hammond?—teaches us men to read men — yes , very shrewdly indeed , to read them . ”

45974	45979	45980	45980	he	84	“ Yes , yes , ”
45984	46088	45980	45980	he	84	“ With thee , my bark , I swiftly speedAcross the foaming brine — call on Mrs. Mertyns ; communicate the information , which I am convinced she will cordially welcome , and return here in time for the midday meal , unless she should ask me to remain . I do not think I could very well refuse , you know . I think we owe it to Mrs. Mertyns to accept any invitation of hers . You will not therefore feel anxious , my love , should my return be delayed . Make my apologies to our end of the table . ”
46113	46452	46454	46455	Mr. Perry	84	“ Oblige me by holding my umbrella , Mamma , while I reduce these offenders to order . New ? Yes , Mr. Hammond ; and they are a little wayward , a little , as I may say , recalcitrant . Patience , always patience — even the trivialities of existence call that godlike virtue into exercise at times.—Which reminds me of what I was saying to Constantine just now , and I am convinced you will endorse it . A fortune must not only be made , it must be guarded , be increased . Is there , indeed , any reason why it should not be doubled ? A wife , as I pointed out to him ( for it is only prudent to reckon with these little possible accidents beforehand ) , not infrequently implies a family . It is therefore his duty not to relax his efforts . Children are costly commodities in these days , extremely costly . Let him therefore look forward , and continue to apply himself to business . As I told him , neither Mrs. Perry nor myself would ever stand in his way , if the state of his affairs pointed to the desirability of his taking a three or six months ' trip to the southern confines of the Dark Continent . During his absence , his home should be ours . With perfect security he could leave his Charlotte under the protection of her natural guardians . Mamma and I would join her at her house in town at any moment . Ah , and that reminds me , we must consult you upon a knotty point,—a knotty point , Mr. Hammond ! In favour of which locality is your vote given ? Where shall they reside ? Mamma inclines to the north side of the park ; eh , my love ? But I maintain she is in error . A young ménage should be en evidence . So give me Mayfair or Belgravia , ”
46458	46464	46454	46455	Mr. Perry	84	“ for preference , Belgravia . ”
46465	46490	46491	46492	Mrs. Perry	62	“ Well , I always shall say people are much more neighbourly in the suburbs or out Bayswater way than down in the squares , ”
46501	46504	46510	46510	he	2008	“ Neighbourly ! ”
46518	46546	46510	46510	he	2008	“ My dear , there are social distinctions which I fear your mind will never — here , give me , if you please , my umbrella . ”

46575	46612	46510	46510	he	2008	added—“I must away . Remember , I may be detained . I may be unable to join you at déjeûner . Your kindest regards , I am sure , to our charming friends , Mr. Hammond . ”
46697	46707	46708	46708	she	62	“ You see , Mr. Perry is rather excited , ”
46711	46746	46747	46747	She	62	“ I suppose everybody forgets themselves sometimes under excitement , and of course he has been very troubled about Charlotte 's future , and now that everything 's so comfortably settled he feels the — ”

46762	46800	46801	46801	She	62	“ Yes , reaction . That 's just it , and thank you . And I am sure I shall always be grateful to you for our pleasant chat , and for letting me be so confidential . ”

I have been holding converse with Mrs. Perry — who , by the same token , is as dear and kind a soul as ever stepped — and I find you are very much the hero of the hour . But I have had no speech of you for two days . Descend , therefore , oh great man , from your pedestal , and account for yourself . Tell me how you are . ”
47947	47960	47961	47961	he	58	“ She told you about it all , and they 're pleased ? ”
47964	47978	47961	47961	he	58	“ That 's a good thing , anyhow . I 'm immensely glad . ”

48140	48223	48107	48107	his	58	“ But really I begin to forget . Was I ever well ? Is anybody ever well ? Is n't it all a matter of degrees , after all ? Some cheerful old johnny once declared the beginning of living was , rightly understood , merely the beginning of dying , did n't he ? And as you get older the process of dissolution merely gets more way on , I suppose . The pace quickens when you 're nearing the post . ”
48224	48259	48107	48107	his	58	“ But , my dear friend , at your age one by no means necessarily nears the post . There are ways and means . Something can and must be done to prevent it . ”

I am always seeing a picture , I once came across somewhere , of men and women frozen into a great sea of ice . I fancy it was an illustration of Dante,—mean , spiteful sort of thing it always struck me , to stick all the people who annoyed you into the wrong place like that , in a poem , for themselves and everybody else to read . I came down here , ”
48377	48423	48374	48374	he	58	“ to try to bake the shivers out of me . But it 's no good . This European sun of yours is a miserably one - horse concern . It gives out about as much heat as a square foot of looking - glass . ”

48579	48733	48575	48575	Leversedge	58	“ What it all is , and why it all is , I do n't know . I have gone back through everything , as far as I can remember , and my record,—it is n't perfectly clean ; whose is , after all , you know?—but it is not worse than most men 's . So I ca n't make out that I have done anything to bring this upon myself . I suppose it 's folly ever to try to go behind the fact . What is , is ; and there 's the beginning and end of it . And , as I told you , in that dead camp I saw the Thing - too - Much . Still , one would always like to know why . It occurs to one Somebody must be accountable , and one would be obliged if They 'd kindly explain,—that 's all . ”
48743	48750	48751	48751	he	58	“ But They do n't explain , ”
48754	48784	48751	48751	he	58	“ I do n't want to be blasphemous , but it occurs to one sometimes that perhaps They 're not so very much to blame,—perhaps They ca n't explain . ”

I was so absurdly tired,—that little bit of business with the Consul yesterday regularly knocked me up — I do n't know what I am coming to,—but I had n't the energy to get up and move about , so I lay still and let it lie .

Well , well , we must pardon them — ' Tis theirs to note the passing of the hour , Reclined at ease upon the low divan , But by the sunshine 's waxing , waning power , But by the opening , closing of the flower , The lute 's faint echo and the faltering fanAs sleep invades the drooping eyelids ' delicate span , ”

Even Mamma is vain . I am happy to say so — upon my word , I am proud to say so . For , that a woman should continue to desire to please after three decades of married life — though ' tis hardly fair on Mamma to let cats out of bags as to the lapse of time in this way , eh?—shows a marvellous freshness of sentiment , of what I may call a wholesomeness of disposition , does n't it , Mr. Hammond ? ”

Occasions such as that which brings us together this morning — and most happy I am , I 'm sure , to be brought together — inevitably carry us back in thought and unseal the fount of tender memories . Yes , I am glad to record my hearty conviction that I was not in error when I invited her , whom you now know as Susan Perry , to become the partner of my mortal course . And it 's not every husband who can say as much as that at the end of thirty years , Mr. Hammond . Little ups and downs , ”

Think of the delight of her brightness and depth of character ! The combination is extraordinary — ”

I think all my people would have liked to come . But I could not allow that . I know your Charlotte so well . I know and respect her instinctive shrinking from publicity . And so I said I would just slip away quietly with my husband . We would take a little Darby and Joan day 's holiday . We could efface ourselves immediately if it seemed better to do so . But I thought it possible Septimus might be useful , for I gathered from what Mr. Perry told me there were papers to be witnessed , and my husband is so utterly dependable and so accustomed — ah ! dear friend , ”
52890	52931	52876	52876	she	1152	“ Well , then , here 's Lottie at last ! And I 'm sure I 'm as thankful as possible , Mr. Hammond , for I was as nervous as could be something would happen to some of them . ”
53042	53048	53016	53017	Mrs. Mertyns	70	“ Dear , dear friend ! ”
53049	53058	53016	53017	Mrs. Mertyns	70	“ I have not done wrong in coming ? ”
53208	53212	53213	53213	he	1161	“ Delightful surprise ! ”
53216	53266	53268	53269	Mr. Perry	84	“ I am sure , most delightful . A display of sympathy , of spontaneous solicitude , altogether flattering to myself and my family ; adding one more to an already long list of charming acts of courtesy . We are in your debt , and how to pay , ”
53275	53303	53304	53304	he	84	“ passes me . I ransack the chambers of my brain , but they are empty of any suggestion of a possible means of payment . Yet , ”
53309	53349	53304	53304	he	84	“ who knows , a time may come , an opportunity may be granted me , and then — The faithful heart bound fast to thine by gracious friendly deeds , Will rouse to stalwart action interpreting thy needs . ”
53419	53427	53428	53428	he	119	“ Oh , here you all are , ”
53431	53455	53428	53428	he	119	“ How d'ye do , Mrs. Mertyns ? No , pray , do n't anybody move . I see you 're all settled . ”—Mrs
53475	53488	53492	53492	he	119	gangway.—“I can just as well find a place farther up the carriage . ”
53776	53792	53793	53793	he	119	“ Sometimes it strikes me we men are awful brutes when it comes to marriage , ”
53797	53817	53793	53793	he	119	“ We want so much . We must have everything . Nothing less than the whole will satisfy us . ”
53818	53833	53834	53834	I	0	“ Upon my word , I think we give a good deal in return , ”
53837	53941	53834	53834	I	0	“ The counter - demand is considerable , a matter by no means to be sneezed at — so considerable , in my estimation , that , as you see , I have never yet found myself equal to meeting it , and so remain , to the present hour , at once hugging and deploring my state of single blessedness . Oh , I 'm all on the man 's side , believe me , in marriage . In my eyes the bridegroom , the husband , is the leader of a forlorn hope — at once a noodle and a hero . ”
53942	53946	53947	53947	Leversedge	119	“ Thank you , ”
53950	53971	53947	53947	Leversedge	119	“ you are encouraging . But the truth is , you do n't understand , you 're out of it . ”
53999	54008	54009	54009	he	119	“ Yes , you 're out of it , ”
54012	54109	54009	54009	he	119	“ It 's not that you are unequal to meeting the demand . You 've never felt the thing . You 've never been knocked out of time by a woman . Bless me , you do n't stop to calculate the amount of giving and taking then ; you do n't weigh things ; you do n't speculate . When a man meets his fate , he meets it . The whole matter is outside argument . It is just so,—he may be a noodle , but he does n't stop to care about that . ”
54138	54162	54163	54163	he	119	“ No , the man does n't give much in proportion to the woman , to the girl , to the good woman , ”
54166	54257	54163	54163	he	119	“ For the man knows the ropes , after all ; he has a precious clear idea of what he is driving at . He knows what he wants quite well , shamelessly lessly well , in too many cases . But hers is an act of faith almost divine . God in heaven ! it seems to me there is no limit to the gratitude , to the reverence , Hammond , with which we should regard an innocent girl who is willing to marry any one of us . ”
54263	54431	54258	54258	He	119	“ I beg your pardon for prosing like this . But it 's borne in upon me to - day that I am a wretchedly selfish animal . And I suppose something of the cheap old superstition clings to me that in confessing your sins you rid yourself of them , to a certain extent at all events . A better man than I , under all the circumstances , would have talked less and done something practical . Old Perry 's income , such as it is , pretty well dies with him . And she ought to have money , she can use it — it is necessary to a woman with her gifts , and it is miserable to think of her wanting it , now or any when . A better man than I would have seen to all that , provided against any bother that way — and then set her free , given her up , whether she would or not . ”
54447	54453	54454	54454	he	119	“ But I ca n't , ”
54456	54497	54454	54454	he	119	huskily,—“I ca n't . Before God , I have tried ; but I have not the pluck . I want her . I must have her — for a little while — just for a little while — and then — ”
54650	54657	54658	54658	she	70	“ Do come , Mr. Hammond , ”
54664	54724	54658	54658	she	70	“ See , there is a place for you . Mr. Perry will kindly put my odds and ends on to the table . Yes — thanks , so.—I am just starting that delightful thinking game dear Hattie St. John taught us the other day after luncheon . And we want a sixth — we really must have you . ”
54776	54788	54789	54789	she	70	“ Mr. Perry quite surpassed himself , quite excelled in it , ”
54792	54822	54789	54789	she	70	“ He gave us the most interesting examples . And Charlotte must learn it . I am devoted to thinking games ; they fill in so many stray minutes when otherwise”—she
54825	54931	54789	54789	she	70	“ It will prevent our feeling this oppressive heat . Now , Mr. Hammond , you shall give us a subject — an event or a character in history or fiction ( really it is an excellent exercise of memory)—while I count twelve , do you see ? Then in twelve words describe it ; and then we have twelve guesses between us , in turn , you understand . And you answer in numbers as we get more or less near it . Twelve , of course , means game . Now , remember , we all have to speak as quick as possible . ”
55012	55017	55019	55020	Mr. Perry	84	“ A bloodstained deck , ”
55022	55031	55019	55020	Mr. Perry	84	“ One , two , three , four , ”
55036	55046	55047	55047	he	84	“ No — no , three , but three , ”
55050	55069	55047	55047	he	84	“ Blood - stained is one , only one , joined by the ever - welcome hyphen.—Torn canvas . ”

55080	55135	55077	55078	Mrs. Perry	62	“ I always have disliked shipwrecks . I suppose it 's the Princess Alice pleasure steamer — poor creatures , an acquaintance of Aunt Trumbull had relatives on board — going down in the river . I wish Mr. Perry would n't allude to such things , on a wedding - day , too . ”
55136	55141	55143	55144	Mrs. Mertyns	70	“ Four , five , ”
55146	55159	55143	55144	Mrs. Mertyns	70	“ Noble commander laid low,—my love , you are entirely mistaken,—in victory . ”

55889	55895	55896	55896	she	354	“ You go too far , ”
55899	55957	55958	55958	She	354	“ for I can not believe you are utterly heartless , and so you must be aware , in a measure , of all I am feeling.—Oh ! I know you are talking well — you usually do that . But , just now , that you should be agreeable is of very slight moment to me . ”
55972	55986	55987	55987	she	354	“ You remember they burnt people up there , once upon a time , ”
55990	56026	55987	55987	she	354	“ Well , I feel towards your talk much as those people must have felt towards the grasshoppers — listen to them now — singing gaily in the sunshine while the flames leapt up that — ”
56027	56037	56038	56038	I	0	“ No , no , no , pardon me , ”
56041	56092	56038	56038	I	0	“ It is you who go very much too far . For goodness ' sake do n't souse us thus suddenly in a sea of tragedy right up to the neck . Forgive my remarking that your illustration is a wild exaggeration , altogether beyond the facts of the case . ”
56093	56140	55987	55987	she	354	“ You know what I have done , you know why I have done it , and you make agreeable conversation . You have no word of recognition , of admission . Does not your sense of justice compel you to own my sincerity at last ? ”
56141	56153	56154	56154	I	0	“ Oh , quarrel with me as much as you like , ”
56157	56201	56154	56154	I	0	“ That is healthy enough . But do n't lose sight of the proportion of things , and indulge in distorted comparisons . It is unworthy of your intelligence to do so , to go thus madly beyond the facts of the case . ”
56230	56243	56244	56244	she	354	“ But can anything really go beyond the facts of the case ? ”
56290	56299	56300	56300	I	0	“ Yes , most emphatically many things can , ”
56303	56373	56300	56300	I	0	“ Does a man 's love carry so little weight with you that you dare speak as though to be the sole and supreme object of it was a dire misfortune ? Moreover , Leversedge comes to you with his hands by no means empty . He does not merely offer you the trivial matter of his whole heart , but the exceedingly substantial matter of his whole fortune . ”
56402	56412	56413	56413	she	354	“ You can not suppose money matters to me ? ”
56416	56419	56420	56420	I	0	“ Indeed , ”
56423	56512	56420	56420	I	0	“ I can very readily suppose it . Money matters vitally to every one of us who is in his , or her , sober senses . Miseries come whether one is rich or whether one is poor ; but , I own , I never encountered any form of misery yet which money could not do a good deal to alleviate . But that is not the main point ; the main point is your very limited appreciation of the affection of the man you are marrying . ”
56513	56524	56525	56526	my companion	394	“ Are you aware that you are simply scolding me ? ”
56530	56546	56547	56547	I	0	“ Yes , I am perfectly well aware of it , my dear young lady , ”
56551	56625	56547	56547	I	0	“ And unless you actually run away from me , or call for help , I am fully prepared to continue the process . I am not nearly through with the business yet ; and it is all for your good — all , believe me . See now , you have done me the honour to be very confidential with me . You have confided to me dreams of an ideal affection . ”
56684	56819	56820	56820	I	0	“ Bear with me while I point out to you that those dreams are but pale and ghostly fictions , beside the real , the very full - blooded , romance of Leversedge 's affection . All that you have vaguely imagined yourself feeling regarding some possible , conceivable , but non - existent being , he positively and actually feels regarding you . Do n't you understand , you are the last word of poetry , of art , of religion — even — to him . And is that nothing ? Is it a slight matter to be to a man the incarnation , the ultimate expression , of all enchantments , all delights — that in you he finds the realisation of his highest aspirations — finds it there or nowhere ? ”
57002	57128	57129	57130	The Carissima	83	“ My dear young lady , you have been bewitched by much talk , by much reading , by all manner of ingenious hair - splittings regarding the emotions , regarding the relation of men and women . Do come back out of all that , all those misleading generalisations and fanciful interpretations , and deal with the matter in hand . You have just married a man who adores you , to whom you — briefly — represent rapture ; well , lend yourself a little to the situation . It is not a contemptible one . For , to how many women do you suppose it happens , in their whole lifetime , ever to represent that to any member of our sex ? ”

57241	57356	57224	57224	she	83	“ He will do more than tell you — only give him time . Remember , Leversedge is one of those who live ballads , not one of those who merely sit at home and write them . Only do n't frighten him by narrow criticism , and quarrel with him because he does not conform altogether to fashionable standards . Give him room . Then he will not disappoint you . He has rather magnificent stuff in him . And he is yours to make or to break . Make him — believe me , he 's worth it — make him , and for you , also , life shall be sweet . ”
57362	57367	57368	57368	she	354	me.—“And that hideous hallucination ? ”
57371	57383	57384	57384	I	0	“ Will vanish into the nothingness out of which it came , ”
57423	57438	57439	57439	she	354	“ If I make him , will you believe in me , at last ? ”
57442	57486	57439	57439	she	354	“ Down to the ground . I will hail you as the dearest and most sacred thing on earth,—a clever and beautiful woman who is not above giving happiness , who is not ashamed of being something of an angel into the bargain — ”
57576	57581	57582	57582	he	0	“ Come , come , ”
57585	57697	57582	57582	he	0	“ ' tis time to move , though I regret to quit this interesting spot — to the student of literature , I 'm sure , most interesting . Not that the writings of the ‘ self - torturing sophist ’ have ever greatly appealed to me . No , no , as an Englishman , as a husband and father , I say — and must always say — give me something manly , give me something sound , give me , in short , sentiments which , without the most fugitive movement of apology , I can permit to lie open upon my wife 's drawing - room table . ”

57735	57797	57728	57729	Mr. Perry	84	“ for ' tis , no doubt , a reflection on my culture ; yet I own that the genius of the French , as a nation , is foreign to me . A want of grit , Mr. Hammond , a lack of the substantial . Too many kickshaws , eh ? just a trifle too many kickshaws and sauces . ”
57812	57815	57816	57816	she	354	“ Yes , ”
57819	57840	57816	57816	she	354	“ I am rather tired . To tell the truth , I dread the noise and dust of the train . ”
57872	57879	57880	57880	she	354	“ Shall we desert the others ? ”
57884	57911	57880	57880	she	354	“ Shall we leave them to encounter the miseries of the railway without us ? Will you go back with me — alone — by boat ? ”
58049	58053	58054	58054	he	58	“ Will I ? ”
58057	58069	58054	58054	he	58	“ Do you really mean it?—Will I — will I not ? ”
58090	58109	58110	58110	she	62	“ I suppose there 's no objection to their going off alone together like that , Mr. Hammond , ”
58113	58403	58110	58110	she	62	“ Mr. Perry made no objection , and , of course , we all know Joseph is very tenacious of appearances . But it does seem to me strange , only half married as they are . But then everything does seem strange to - day somehow ; and , you see , it is so very warm , and I get such giddy turns . Dear me , I 'm sure up at the Consul 's , when all those papers were signing , the room turned right round with me , and I thought I should have fallen , which made me dreadfully nervous , because , of course , it would have been most mortifying for Charlotte and Mr. Perry . But , you see , I ca n't help feeling a little upset somehow , with all the marrying twice over . I 'm sure none of my relations were ever married like that , nor any of Mr. Perry 's either . And I really do n't feel I know who Charlotte is for the rest of to - day . I 've been worrying about whether she is Mrs. Leversedge yet , or only our daughter , just as usual ; and I ca n't make out anyhow . I 've been thinking if anything was to happen before to - morrow — which I 'm sure I hope it won't — to make her name appear in the papers , whatever would they call her ? I do n't know . And it makes me quite nervous . It seems almost a scandalous thing not to be sure about your own daughter 's name , now does n't it , Mr. Hammond . ”

59808	59897	59796	59796	he	75	“ Dancing ? How superfluous ! You are very right to remain out here . The modern bourgeois ballroom — and this , I imagine , is pre - eminently bourgeois — is a revolting spectacle . Few sights , indeed , can be more repulsive than a herd of both sexes , underbred and perspiring , clasping each other 's waists , and revolving , with prolonged and boisterous fatuity , in time to some wholly imbecile tune such as offends my ear at the present moment . ”
59952	59959	59960	59960	he	75	“ An exhibition of untamed animality ! ”
59968	60009	59960	59960	he	75	“ I hold it proof of the skin - deep quality of our vaunted civilisation that performances of this description are countenanced , nay , encouraged — it is humiliating to think of — by really very decently educated people . ”
60010	60023	60024	60024	I	0	“ From the Perfectly Ordered State , then , dancing is excluded ? ”

60128	60154	60155	60155	He	75	“ Of course you knew it . It is the most abject of exploded fictions that a man can write a masterpiece without knowing it . ”
60171	60202	60155	60155	He	75	“ Yes ; I agree with you . I knew those articles had merit , and the best critics confirmed my judgment . I have been asked to reprint them . ”

60269	60435	60266	60266	he	75	“ That is the worst of journalism — really beautiful things are too often lost , forgotten along with the day that gave them birth . But , since you are interested in my visions , in the Perfectly Ordered State , which , as I devoutly trust , is equivalent to saying , in the Coming Civilisation , woman will resume her natural position , that from which the moral and intellectual barbarism of the last few centuries has ousted her with such deplorable results . In the Coming Civilisation there will be a very hard - and - fast line drawn between the public and the private life . For we have ceased most lamentably to appreciate the decencies of the high wall , the heavy curtain , the locked door . The Democratic Spirit , rightly understood , is disgustingly immodest . It has done its best to murder secrecy and concealment , which are necessary elements in all really exquisite living . ”

60492	60551	60489	60489	Gerrard	75	“ in the Perfect State , woman will again dance with all the grace of richly developed suggestion — behind closed doors — for the delectation of man , who will sit still and just watch her , lending her the emotional support of a profoundly sympathetic admiration , not the brutally material one of an encircling arm . ”

60580	60622	60623	60623	Gerrard	75	“ In many matters the Oriental has always continued true to the light that was in him . His mind has remained unconfused by those weak notions of abstract justice , which war against the life of sense and of society . ”
60661	60784	60785	60785	He	75	“ The pendulum has swung far enough now , in all conscience , in the western ‘ Hail Columbia ! ’ direction ; with unalloyed gladness I hail indications of the return , the eastern beat.—And that reminds me — talking of dancing , of course you know that most exquisite place , Palewell Friars ? I was down there at Whitsuntide this year . They like to have me . You remember the view from the cedar drawing - room ? That delightful Italian garden and the river flowing just below it , the lime avenues , and the broken ground in the deer - park studded with the old Spanish chestnuts , composes as entirely a lovely home scene as — ”

But Palewell always strikes me as unique , nothing jars , nothing obtrudes itself . Its charm is a solicitation , not a demand ; while there is the inimitable flavour of an intensely aristocratic atmosphere pervading the whole scene , the whole life . ”

60949	60953	60954	60954	he	75	“ It does , ”
60957	61005	60954	60954	he	75	“ you are perfectly right , it certainly does . I draw breath there with the emotion of perfect and natural well - being , with which , as I conceive , the Blest draw breath in the translucent air of Paradise — I am at home . ”
61011	61156	61006	61006	He	75	“ We all have intimations , at times , of that which is utterly in harmony with the best of our own being — a delicious satisfaction of both the religious and artistic instincts . I had attended mass one morning in that little gem of a chapel ; and later , in the richly toned and shadowed cedar drawing - room , while the sunlight yet caressed the grey stone mullions of that range of vast windows , Lady Clare danced to us.—You know her ? Petite but svelte , sherry - coloured eyes and hair , with a dark pencilling of eyelash and eyebrow . A skin like cream — yet that illustration hardly gratifies me . It is a little disgustingly suggestive of the cow , and the farm - girl , and a rude first - hand relation to nature . ”

Yes , I think that fairly renders the immediate sentiment of her appearance . It was all very beautiful . The magnificent room , the high - bred woman , her bare neck and arms braving the sunlight , on which those historic rubies — you know them?—glowed and shone as she passed from the voluptuous monotony of the Nautch to the frank gaminerie of the Café Chantant . ”
61283	61292	61293	61293	I	0	“ Innocent alike of the intention of either ? ”

61313	61407	61304	61304	he	75	“ But I hope so ; of course I hope so , for it would go far to carry out my cherished theory of woman.—And there were contrasts in the setting of the scene which , emotionally speaking , were wonderfully helpful . The other women present wore shirts and sailor hats , the men were in breeches and dirty shooting - boots . Pour comble de bonheur little Freddy Hellard lighted cigarettes , and no one chid him . Ah , I shall long remember that morning , it was big with — ”
62014	62018	62019	62019	he	75	“ Poor girl , ”
62022	62239	62019	62019	he	75	“ I have a regard for her . It is painful . She was worthy of a better fate than the embraces of that — . But let us turn to something pleasanter , Hammond . I felt very thankful during that scene at Palewell ; for I recognised that my prayers had been answered , and that I had not misread the signs of the times . I recognised that the reaction has set in , in very truth ; that the degrading fiction of the equality of the sexes is already exploded ; that education , doing its worst , has still failed to do any abiding injury , since the fin de siècle woman , true in instinct , though false in idea , mistakes the badge of her servitude for the brevet of her emancipation , and , to prove the completeness of her liberty , dances , like any slave - girl of the harem , for the entertainment of her hereditary masters . A cynic might sneer at this , as a last and crowning example of the illogic of the feminine mind . I can not sneer . To me the matter is solemnly glad from the bigness of its promise . ‘ Woman never civilises,’—thank God for that . ”
62338	62346	62347	62347	I	0	“ How about the suffrage , then , ”
62356	62387	62347	62347	I	0	“ to which , as a good Conservative , your organ — that is the technical term , I believe — your organ , has devoted so many eloquent pages ? ”
62388	62403	62404	62404	he	75	“ Assuredly , Hammond , you are not taken in by that little blague ? ”
62416	62497	62404	62404	he	75	“ We need it for the protection of our own property , of course , menaced as it is by the rapacity of the masses . Not one woman in a million is public - spirited — the vast majority have a savage rage for their own little possessions . We give it as the rope , the enough of rope , which will enable these dear foolish female creatures very effectually to hang themselves . Do n't you see ? ”
62498	62505	62506	62506	I	0	“ Most emphatically I do see , ”
62575	62580	62581	62581	he	75	“ By the way , ”
62584	62607	62581	62581	he	75	“ you know , I suppose , whether this story of Mrs. Mertyns ' is true about that lunatic Leversedge 's money ? ”
62608	62612	62613	62613	I	0	“ What story ? ”
62616	62640	62641	62641	I	0	“ Oh ! that there is really a great deal of it , and that he has left it unconditionally to his wife ? ”
62685	62694	62695	62695	he	75	“ You signed the will , I understand , ”
62698	62707	62695	62695	he	75	“ Of course you know all about it . ”
62708	62713	62714	62714	I	0	“ Upon my word , ”
62717	62747	62714	62714	I	0	“ I do not see — if you will excuse my saying so — that whatever I do know or do n't know is any particular concern of yours . ”
62777	62788	62789	62789	he	75	“ Oh ! of course I do n't want details , ”
62793	62912	62789	62789	he	75	“ Pray , do n't misunderstand my motives in asking . I have , as I told you just now , a regard for the poor girl . She is clever ; in good hands something might be made of her . I am aware , just as you are aware , and everybody else is aware , that the man she is marrying is insane . And I own , I should be glad to know that when her husband retires into the enforced seclusion which is already , in my humble opinion , so desirable for the comfort and safety of other people , she , poor thing , will at least be decently provided for . ”
62913	62920	62921	62921	I	0	“ Make your charitable mind easy , ”
62924	62934	62921	62921	I	0	“ Mrs. Leversedge will be by no means destitute . ”
62935	62951	62952	62952	Gerrard	75	“ So I understood . It is a relief to have you confirm the report . ”
62968	62973	62974	62974	he	75	“ Thanks , Hammond , ”
62977	62992	62974	62974	he	75	“ You are really very obliging . That is all I wanted to know . ”
63173	63177	63137	63138	queer people	1340	“ stopping over , ”
63920	63933	63934	63934	I	0	“ You here ? The gay and giddy dance is over then , ”
63949	63959	63960	63960	he	1369	“ Oh ! we 've had some splendid turns , ”
63963	63968	63960	63960	he	1369	“ Charlotte dances divinely . ”
63969	63978	63937	63937	Leversedge	171	“ Does she not do all things divinely ? ”
63979	63983	63984	63984	he	1369	“ Pretty nearly , ”
64038	64044	64045	64045	he	1369	“ Poor , silly fools , ”
64049	64060	64045	64045	he	1369	“ they 're a little too much of a parable . ”
64067	64072	64073	64073	I	0	“ My dear fellow , ”
64076	64125	64073	64073	I	0	“ they ‘ needs must love the highest when they see it , ’ like the rest of us . But the highest is perfectly safe in this case , and will not do them any injury . They ca n't singe themselves . The globes are sealed . ”
64151	64160	64161	64161	he	1369	“ No , they ca n't singe themselves , ”
64164	64182	64161	64161	he	1369	“ but they can bash their silly heads in , which will answer much the same purpose . ”
64189	64214	64184	64184	he	1369	courteously—“I beg your pardon , Hammond ; I am an ass , and like an ass I am a little bit out of temper . ”
64237	64242	64243	64243	he	1369	“ What 's that ? ”
64339	64351	64352	64352	Leversedge	171	“ Let us come round to the front of the house , ”
64358	64384	64352	64352	Leversedge	171	“ That set of Lancers must be over by now , I should think , and she told me to meet her at the steps . ”
64395	64471	64392	64392	he	1369	“ That greasy animal , Gerrard , has turned up again to - night . He insisted upon Charlotte 's sitting out this square dance with him , which bored her , and annoyed me rather . Of course I know , I 'm rather out of it , Hammond , from having been away so long ; but if that fellow 's not a bad lot , I never saw any man that was . ”
64472	64480	64481	64481	I	0	“ Briefly , he is a beast ! ”
64488	64495	64496	64496	he	1369	“ Thanks , I feel better , ”
64499	64548	64496	64496	he	1369	“ Charlotte does n't fancy him either , I know ; but she 's seen a good deal of him at Mrs. Mertyns ' , and she ca n't be uncivil , you see . As to this dance , she could n't civilly get out of it . ”
64592	64603	64604	64604	Leversedge	171	“ We shall get away from all these people tomorrow , ”
64607	64619	64604	64604	Leversedge	171	“ Till then I strive to possess my soul in patience . ”
64634	64644	64645	64645	he	1369	“ I 'm awfully grateful to you , Hammond , ”
64648	64674	64645	64645	he	1369	“ But for you I might not have dared go on . Thanks to you , the supreme good is near , is very near . ”
64742	64754	64755	64755	Leversedge	171	“ Oh ! hang it , they 've not done yet , ”
64779	64784	64785	64785	he	84	“ Ah , ha ! ”
64788	64894	64785	64785	he	84	“ I see , I see . Damon and Pythias , David and Jonathan — as usual , inseparable companions — Divorced for a brief spaceAnd then together flowing , impelled by friendship , As severed drops upon the petals of the dewy rose . Upon my word , I begin to suspect Charlotte has a rival in that naughty boy 's affections , eh , Mr. Hammond mond ? Ladies have been known before now to grow jealous of their husband 's friends . You must be nice to Charlotte , very , very nice to Charlotte , or who can tell — eh ? ”
64895	64902	64911	64911	his	1391	“ It 's a beautiful night , ”
64914	64940	64911	64911	his	1391	“ all the same , I do n't care to stand still here . Shall we take a turn , Hammond , and come back ? ”
64941	64946	64947	64947	I	0	“ By all means , ”
65021	65028	65030	65031	Mr. Perry	84	“ Yes , by all means , ”
65033	65039	65030	65031	Mr. Perry	84	“ I am with you . ”
65047	65126	65041	65041	he	84	“ A beautiful night , as you observe , Constantine , truly a beautiful night . Really , I may say , without exaggeration , a sublime night . I have just been calling my wife 's and our good friend , the doctor 's , attention to the expanse of the starry heavens as presented to us this evening — Worlds upon worlds displayedTo awe the human eye , In majesty arrayed , Go slowly rolling by . ”
65134	65343	65128	65129	Mr. Perry	84	“ If my youth had not been necessarily devoted to pursuits of a practical character , and if the virtue of patriotism had not become the master passion of my maturer years , I should certainly have been an astronomer . Most elevating branch of science , Mr. Hammond , I am sure,—most elevating . The silent night , the lonely observatory , the burnished brass tube turned in humble inquiry upon unnumbered universes ! Ah yes , ‘ the undevout astronomer is mad,’—must be , you know , ' tis perfectly obvious . Yet , as I often remind myself , the busy bee has its place in nature , its little duty to fulfil , as well as the soaring eagle . And I trust I do not neglect my own honey cells , as we may say , do not neglect them . I am proud to think our local branch of the Primrose League , for instance , owes much to my efforts and to those of Mamma — for we must never forget the gentle hand of women , which rocking the cradle still rules the world — ah ha ! rules us , and , therefore , of necessity , the world . ”
65467	65472	65473	65473	he	84	“ Yes , yes , ”
65476	65647	65473	65473	he	84	“ you heavenly bodies must indeed pursue your immemorial way without me ! Hearth and home , wife and child , man and brother , Church and State , our revered Queen , our glorious Constitution,—these , after all , Mr. Hammond , twine themselves more closely about the heart - strings of the true Briton than even the most august of scientific studies . he affections must be satisfied , must be so , ' tis absolutely necessary . Constantine is in a position to bear witness to that truth just now ; eh , Constantine ? — He left his booksFor ladies ' looks . Account - books , in the case of Constantine . Ledgers , yes , ledgers — and very well - kept ones , too , as I can testify . Most creditable entries in those ledgers.—Dear me , what 's this — what 's this ? Amid all our charming conversation and light musical gaiety the plaint of some inferior animal in pain ! ”
65698	65723	65688	65688	Leversedge	58	“ Let 's turn , Hammond . That dance must be over by now , and I do n't want to keep her waiting . ”
65724	65729	65731	65732	Mr. Perry	84	“ Right , right ! ”
65735	65858	65731	65732	Mr. Perry	84	“ I approve the sentiment . The Fair may sometimes delay us , but let us never delay the Fair . For ' tis the little foxes , the little foxes , that spoil the grapes . And how often the surface of domestic happiness is ruffled , and the peace of its depths endangered , I 'm sure I may say positively endangered , by the omission of small courtesies — Those trifling , trivial tributes of our love , Which still the heart 's complete devotion prove . These are too often ignored by us members of the sterner sex ; yet they are foundational , I protest foundational , as the basis of sweet agreement in the matrimonial state . ”
65869	65873	65874	65874	she	62	“ Dear me ! ”
65880	66028	65874	65874	she	62	“ I 'm sure it 's a very shocking thing we should be benefiting so by those poor black people 's bad habits , and I really do n't see how we do,—and I 'm sure it ought all to be put a stop to at once by the Queen , or the Parliament , or anybody in a position to do it.—Oh , well , here you all are ; the doctor here 's been explaining to me all about those poor Indians and the opium , and it does seem all very dreadful . And there 's been a dog howling so ; I 've just been asking him to go and see what is the matter with it . It always upsets me,—doesn't it you , Mr. Hammond?—to hear anything crying about like that when you do n't know what 's wrong with it . ”
66166	66183	66184	66184	he	75	“ Damn your impudence ! I should like to settle with you once and for all , ”
66190	66203	66187	66187	his	75	“ Yes , to be sure , there it is howling again , ”
66209	66256	66204	66205	Mrs. Perry	62	“ But , dear me , I do n't want the poor thing done away with altogether , if that 's what you mean , Constantine . I only want it turned out of the garden , you know , or taken back where it belongs . ”
66356	66364	66353	66353	Caminada	186	“ Ashes of love are as ashes of roses,”—and
66380	66383	66385	66386	Mr. Perry	84	“ APRÈS , ”
66393	66499	66503	66504	Mr. Perry	84	tones,—“après le bal ! Surely you young people stand in need of a little light refreshment ? A plan , a plan , I have a charming plan — eh , Mamma ? Let 's offer our friends here an al fresco entertainment , before we part at the close of this auspicious day , to meet again to - morrow morning . Ah yes , meet at the church door at half - past ten o'clock . I look for many friendly faces to be gathered at the church door , I 'm sure , quite a number of friendly faces.—But now to supper . ”
66984	66994	66995	66995	she	62	“ I 'm sure this is all very pleasant , ”
67004	67136	66995	66995	she	62	“ And no doubt it 's very right and proper of Dr. Moorcock to be so busy about the bad habits of those poor blacks . But hearing him talk seems to make you very anxious , you know . Of course I was always brought up to believe those in authority — governors and generals and Members of Parliament , and all those sort of gentlemen , did know best , so that one was n't called upon to trouble . And then , of course , when somebody like Dr. Moorcock comes and explains to you they 're always making dreadful mistakes , why , you ca n't help being very upset and uneasy , you know — you really do n't feel as if anything was safe anywhere . ”
67137	67142	67143	67143	I	0	“ My dear child , ”
67151	67173	67145	67145	Leversedge	58	“ if you 'd only tell me what 's gone wrong — half an hour ago everything seemed as right as — ”
67174	67188	67189	67190	Mrs. Perry	62	“ And then it 's so beautiful sitting out of doors like this , ”
67204	67378	67194	67194	her	62	“ Of course that was all very different , quite in a small private sort of way , you know ; but still it does remind me of the first year Mr. Perry and I were married . We had a house at Brixton — semi - detached , and a nice bow - window to the sitting - room,—I know Aunt Trumbull gave me red rep curtains for it and they never would quite meet , there was a mistake about half a breadth , somewhere — it was a disappointment , but I tried never to let them be drawn when she came in , for fear it should mortify her,—well , and there was a garden at the back . It had walls all round , and , of course , it was n't very much ; but there was a black - plum tree in one corner , and when Joseph used to come back from the office early , we would take our chairs out there and sit . ”
67387	67390	67391	67391	he	58	“ Oh , ”
67395	67411	67412	67412	He	58	“ if you would like the plans altered any way , there 's nothing easier . ”
67428	67473	67412	67412	He	58	“ The world 's before us where to choose , after all , you see . We 'll go where you like , and stay where you like . Whatever you like , I like — down to the ground , I like it . ”
67474	67482	67483	67484	Mrs. Perry	62	“ It was very close that summer , ”
67488	67537	67483	67484	Mrs. Perry	62	“ and — perhaps it 's not quite a thing to mention before a gentleman , but , you see , you do seem to be such an old friend now , Mr. Hammond — I felt the heat very much just then , not being quite strong — ”
67613	67626	67627	67628	Mrs. Perry	62	“ Poor thing , the doctor has n't caught it , then , ”
67689	67701	67702	67702	he	58	“ Whatever you please and wherever you please , my sweet , ”
67704	67724	67702	67702	he	58	softly,—“if only you will be pleased . Surely you know , you know , I just live for that ? ”
67725	67741	67743	67745	my excellent companion	1431	“ You see , it was just a few months before dear Lottie 's birth , ”
67748	67856	67857	67858	Meanwhile Leversedge	188	“ We were n't very well off at that time , Mr. Hammond , and I made all my own baby - linen . It 's very pretty work baby - linen , I always have thought that . And I used to sew as long as it was light , and then sometimes Mr. Perry would play to me . I am afraid the people next door objected rather , which seemed to me very illiberal , for I am sure I always found it sweetly pretty — Joseph used to practise quite a number of nice tunes , at that time , upon the flute . ”
67885	67962	67872	67872	he	1432	“ You know , Mr. Perry does n't quite care to hear me refer to that time ; he gets rather excited when I do , and says it 's not fair upon Charlotte to recall our early married life . And perhaps it is n't . Of course , it all was very obscure . But I never knew how obscure it was then ; and , you see , I was very happy somehow — ”
67967	68036	67963	67964	Mrs. Perry	62	“ I know it 's all much better now , and that Charlotte and Mr. Perry move in society much more suitable to them both ; but a woman 's thoughts will go back to the time she was very happy , even if she sees afterwards that it was all a mistake and that she ought n't to have been so , you know , Mr. Hammond . ”
68072	68079	68080	68080	she	272	“ Wait,—pray , pray , wait , ”
68083	68120	68080	68080	she	272	“ Presently , when my parents are gone — not now — I ca n't explain before them . Indeed , I hardly know my own thought yet . Wait — I implore you , wait . ”
68121	68135	68136	68136	Leversedge	188	“ The last thing I wish is to distress you , God knows , ”
68408	68412	68413	68413	he	188	“ Ah ha ! ”
68416	68504	68413	68413	he	188	“ I bring you varied cates — Each to his taste , enough alike for all . Coffee and ices for the slighter appetites ; champagne for the more solid , accompanied by a lobster mayonnaise . Mamma was ever partial to a salad composed of that somewhat deleterious crustacean — were n't you , Mamma?—Ici , put the things on the table , do n't you see , comme ça , garçon . Et maintenant ôtez le plateau , and you can go , allez,—vous comprenez . ”
68632	68640	68641	68641	he	1439	“ Lobster?—no , thank you . Champagne?—yes , ”
68654	68670	68641	68641	he	1439	Perry,—“that is , if it is dry ; I take for granted it 's dry . ”
68711	68723	68724	68724	he	75	“ Have you remarked the glow - worms to - night ? ”
68728	68742	68743	68743	He	75	“ Out there , upon the grass , they are really very wonderful . ”
68793	68803	68806	68807	Perry père	65	“ Fairylike?—yes , I 'm sure , positively fairylike , ”
68810	68840	68806	68807	Perry père	65	“ Titania and her frisky train are all abroad this evening . I have called my wife 's attention to their merry manœuvres already — haven't I , Mamma ? ”
68926	68949	68950	68950	He	75	“ You see them ? There must be some peculiar atmospheric conditions to account for the extreme brilliancy of those delicate jewels . ”
69054	69060	69062	69062	Gerrard	75	“ Ah ! how extraordinary ! ”
69065	69096	69062	69062	Gerrard	75	“ Look — look at those in the centre of the lawn , two discs of lambent living green . Singular ! They move together rapidly , and towards us . ”
69116	69125	69126	69126	she	83	“ No , no , not that way ! ”
69127	69144	69145	69145	Leversedge	188	cried,—“not that way ! I dare not . It is too wicked . I can not . ”
69190	69194	69195	69195	he	188	“ You lie , ”
69198	69210	69195	69195	he	188	“ and you know it . You lie,—so help me God . ”
69302	69339	69294	69294	his	75	“ You are insolent , Mr. Leversedge , and your language is gross ; but let that pass . I appeal to Miss Perry — to your wife . Ask her what she saw just now . ”
69668	69672	69674	69675	Mrs. Perry,—“oh	194	“ Oh dear ! ”
69675	69717	69674	69675	Mrs. Perry,—“oh	194	Perry,—“oh dear ! whatever is the matter ? Everything seems to have turned off so very dreadful all of a sudden . And , I'm sure I ca n't tell what it 's all about — can you , Mr. Hammond ? ”
69718	69724	69725	69725	I	0	“ About death and damnation ! ”
69741	69744	69745	69745	he	119	“ Charlotte , ”
69752	69766	69745	69745	he	119	“ tell me , did you see anything ? What did you see ? ”
69812	69815	69816	69816	she	83	“ Yes , ”
69819	69825	69816	69816	she	83	“ I did see something . ”
69843	69853	69837	69837	she	83	“ I did see something . I saw it . ”
69896	69912	69913	69913	she	83	“ Oh dear me ! I do n't understand,—won't anybody tell me?—I do n't understand , ”

70082	70103	70104	70104	he	119	said,—“not quite the end,—and with the end the rest of you have nothing to do . Go , you cur , ”
70110	70140	70141	70141	He	119	“ Just how much I owe you I do n't yet know , but be very sure I 'll do my best to pay you all I do owe . ”
70154	70164	70165	70165	he	119	“ Go away too , my dear good woman , ”
70170	70196	70165	70165	he	119	“ You have always been very kind to me ; but I am beyond the point now where kindness like yours is of much avail . ”
70197	70204	70207	70208	Perry père	60	“ I am at a loss , ”
70211	70243	70207	70208	Perry père	60	“ I protest , I am altogether at a loss — I am at sea , positively at sea . The wordy scene , the untasted refreshments — really , Constantine — ”
70244	70251	70253	70253	Leversedge	58	“ There , there , there , ”
70255	70274	70253	70253	Leversedge	58	“ You shall know the result all in good time , and that must be enough for you . ”
70275	70280	70282	70283	Mr. Perry	84	“ But my daughter , ”
70316	70321	70322	70322	she	65	“ Go , Papa , ”
70325	70354	70355	70355	she	65	“ I do not want you ; you ca n't help me , and you may make me ridiculous . I can play my own game . And , ”
70356	70375	70410	70410	she	65	added,—“and — you need n't be afraid . There will be a witness — Mr. Hammond shall stay . ”
70422	70428	70429	70429	she	65	“ I do n't understand , ”
70432	70480	70429	70429	she	65	“ and I was just growing so fond of Constantine , too . He seemed to recall our dear little boy to me so — though as he died quite an infant and Constantine 's a grown man , I 'm sure I do n't know why . ”
70725	70810	70722	70722	he	58	“ My sweet , this is bad — very bad . This is the one thing I have implored might n't happen ; that I have prayed against — by day when I was free , by night when I was cursed . I have fought against the terror of its happening as one fights for life itself . I could not think it could be allowed to be — I trusted God — whatever God is — to be more just than that . ”
70825	70832	70833	70833	he	58	“ As for that brute Gerrard , ”
70838	70858	70833	70833	he	58	“ I believe , as I told him , that he lied . But you — you — you , ”
70860	70865	70866	70866	He	58	Leversedge,—“you could n't lie . ”
70973	70976	70977	70977	Leversedge	58	“ See , ”
70980	71073	70977	70977	Leversedge	58	“ I have no words in which to tell you of my shame , of my self - loathing in having brought this horror on you . I have been hideously , damnably selfish in tying up your life to mine , with the possibility of that happening which has happened . But — but — oh ! I am a scoundrel to have let it come to this pass — you see , we 've gone too far to turn back — you see , we belong to each other now . ”
71124	71165	71166	71166	he	58	“ You see — it 's a vile thing to remind you of like this — but we are married . We ca n't cancel that except by death . And do n't , do n't want me to die , ”
71167	71328	71335	71335	his	58	cried,—“not yet , not just yet . I have cared so long , dreamed so long , waited so long for this — for our marriage — for what to - morrow brings . Oh ! my sweet , my sweet , try to put it out of your mind , try to forget what you saw . You may never see it again , it may never come back . Only be merciful , and try , just try . Give me a week , a month , just a little while , in which to be happy . And the torment will cease , the cloud will pass . I know it will . It must . I will compel it to — it must . And , listen — I will love you as never yet woman was loved ; for you will have done for me more than any woman ever yet did for any man . ”
71356	71360	71361	71361	he	58	“ Forgive me , ”
71367	71373	71361	71361	he	58	“ Forgive me,—try to forget . ”
71393	71420	71382	71382	I	0	“ Speak to him ! Say something , anything . God in heaven ! what are you made of ? Speak to him , I say . ”
71447	71461	71462	71462	she	354	“ You — you of all people in the world , Antony Hammond ! ”
71477	71492	71468	71468	Leversedge	58	“ Forgive me — and for a little while , try , only try . ”
71493	71498	71499	71499	she	354	“ I have tried , ”
71504	71514	71499	71499	she	354	“ You have been to me as an angel . ”
71515	71520	71521	71521	she	354	“ I have tried , ”
71530	71541	71542	71542	She	354	“ You can bear witness to that — who better ? ”
71552	71574	71575	71575	She	354	“ And I have failed , failed miserably and contemptibly . Just in the very moment of success I break down — ”
71599	71892	71578	71578	her	354	“ No , I do n't care what I admit . I have been mad to convince you , to prove to you that I was what I desire to be and am not . I thought I was sufficiently strong to carry it through long enough , at all events , to disprove your suspicions , to master you . I did n't care what came later . I should have won that which I wanted . But I am not sufficiently strong . You triumph , after all . You were right in your estimate of me . I am cheap , flimsy , insincere — an actress . My learning is mere cram , my talents mere imitation . I am a sham — colourless , characterless , a mere reflection of other people 's thoughts , fashions , affectations . Yes , you are right , you have been right all along . I am a fraud . But I hoped against hope . I thought if I played at being something else long enough , I might deceive even myself , and really become that which I simulated . And , remember , I gave you the chance to help me , not once , not twice . But you were relentless ; you forced me back on myself ; you dragged aside the veil with which I tried to conceal my nothingness . I gave you the chance to help , and you were too lazy , too selfish , too fine , to trouble to take it . Then I turned to someone else . Ah ! I am grateful to you — in very truth we have all cause to be grateful to you . ”
71989	72000	72001	72001	he	58	“ Charlotte , my poor child , my poor darling , ”
72004	72032	72001	72001	he	58	“ do n't go on like this , pray do n't . You 'll break my heart . I do n't know what to do for you . ”
72084	72087	72088	72088	she	1488	“ No , ”
72091	72146	72088	72088	she	1488	“ I will not come . It is useless to ask me . Do n't you understand , I break with you ? Ah ! how thick - witted you are ! Do n't you understand , what you offer me is n't enough , since — since — you yourself go with it ? ”
72210	72222	72223	72223	he	58	“ Is n't it a trifle late to think of that ? ”
72254	72261	72262	72263	the girl	354	“ I do not love you , ”
72287	72293	72294	72294	he	58	“ That is rather unfortunate , ”
72297	72306	72294	72294	he	58	“ for I love you — very much . ”
72341	72344	72345	72345	she	354	“ Stay , ”
72348	72386	72345	72345	she	354	“ stay — you're a poor enough creature , Mr. Hammond , but you shall stay . I demand that you do so . I refuse to be left alone here , unprotected , with this madman . ”
72401	72411	72412	72412	he	58	“ But — you — you saw it yourself , ”
72447	72492	72434	72434	her	65	“ I saw nothing , just now . Listen , attend to that which I tell you , I saw nothing but what I should see this moment , if I turned my head — nothing but the glow - worms in the grass . ”
72493	72498	72499	72499	Leversedge	58	“ But — but — ”
72503	72509	72510	72510	she	65	“ It was a plan , ”
72514	72532	72510	72510	she	65	“ a plot to rid myself of you — do you not understand?—to get rid of you . ”
72555	72559	72560	72560	she	65	“ Wake up , ”
72563	72638	72560	72560	she	65	“ Constantine Leversedge ; see things as they are , clearly , at last , though too late ; for I am utterly weary of this long comedy . You have worshipped a delusion . Know me at last as I am . Mr. Hammond will be delighted to draw out the points of the lesson . Learn of what I am capable . I lied to you — do you hear me?—I lied . ”
72794	72797	72798	72798	he	58	“ Thanks , ”
72801	72830	72798	72798	he	58	“ There 's nothing that I know of to wait for now . Perhaps we may as well go in , Hammond ; do n't you think so ? ”
72877	72890	72891	72891	Leversedge	58	“ I think I must have got a bit of a chill , ”
72894	72928	72891	72891	Leversedge	58	“ I expect there 's a lot of damp at night off the lake , and if you 've once had a touch of fever it 's likely to lay hold of you . ”
73037	73043	73044	73044	he	58	“ Candles ? Oh yes , ”
73047	73072	73044	73044	he	58	“ I always tell them to light a good many like that , now — it 's pleasanter , you know , at night . ”
73189	73193	73194	73194	he	58	“ My love ! ”
73197	73200	73194	73194	he	58	loud,—“my love ! ”
73225	73233	73234	73234	he	58	“ You 're extremely kind , Hammond , ”
73237	73319	73234	73234	he	58	“ and I believe you have always done your very best for me . Most likely I shall make use of your kindness again later ; but just now , for the present , I should be glad to be alone . I feel I am rather a poor companion , I have not much talk in me , and I have two or three little matters to attend to . I 'm awfully obliged to you — thanks — goodnight . ”
73451	73464	73446	73446	I	0	“ to the end of the world and looked over the wall , ”
74655	74659	74660	74660	he	1551	“ Mr. Hammond , ”
74664	74724	74660	74660	he	1551	“ I 'm awfully sorry to disturb you , but I ca n't very well help it . Something awful 's happened , and people ought to know . But I did not want to raise an alarm and frighten the ladies . And you and he were friends , I thought I 'd best let you know first . ”
74725	74729	74730	74730	I	0	“ Quite right , ”
74733	74739	74730	74730	I	0	“ And what has happened ? ”
74752	74758	74759	74759	he	1551	“ Why — Mr. Leversedge , ”
74763	74781	74782	74782	He	1551	“ I was going down to bathe , you see — and I came upon him suddenly . ”
74788	74800	74782	74782	He	1551	“ Just against the pier , in the water — dead . ”
74807	74843	74801	74801	His	1551	“ It 's awfully foolish , but I never saw anyone dead before , and I felt as if I did n't want it to be him . He was such a ripping good sort . ”
75037	75044	75045	75045	he	1552	“ Come here , Mr. Hammond , ”
75054	75062	75045	75045	he	1552	“ Look , you can see him . ”
75668	75746	75661	75661	Leversedge	119	“ I HAVE thought it all out , and this is the only way to meet the difficulty , so I take it . I do not blame her . She was pressed beyond endurance , and she was badly advised . She is safe against the future , moreover , so my main end is secured . Also , I am delivered , at last , and for ever , from the power of the dog . ”
75762	75770	75661	75661	Leversedge	119	“ To Antony Hammond , Esq . , ”
